        "text": "What’s driving the day in Westminster. Politics and policymaking in the UK capital.\n\nBy ALEX WICKHAM\n\nSend tips here | Subscribe for free | Listen to Playbook and view in your browser\n\nGood Friday morning.\n\nOUT THIS MORNING: Some good news to start the day: Your favorite political podcast is back from its summer holiday with a timely new episode. Season 3 of Jack Blanchard’s Westminster Insider kicks off with “Postcards from Afghanistan,” in which soldiers-turned-politicians Rory Stewart, Tom Tugendhat and Dan Jarvis reflect on the months and years they spent trying to secure and rebuild Afghanistan after the invasion, and their devastation at the events of the past few weeks. And the Times’ Larisa Brown discusses her long-running campaign to secure safe passage to Britain for many hundreds of Afghan interpreters who supported the British Army over the past 20 years. It’s an absolute must-listen after what has been a dramatic and intense week in Westminster and beyond.\n\nDRIVING THE DAY\n\nRAAB ON THE ROPES: Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab is fighting for his job this morning as a chorus of politicians from across Westminster demand his resignation. Speculation is rising that Raab could be moved at an upcoming reshuffle after he lost the confidence of senior staff at the Foreign Office and faced stern criticism from across Cabinet over his handling of the Afghanistan debacle. Britain’s beleaguered foreign minister was unrepentant yesterday as he told journalists he wouldn’t quit over claims he failed to make a call that might have saved Afghan interpreters because he was on holiday in Crete. Today brings fresh revelations that other senior government officials have failed to return to work during the crisis. And there are increasing concerns about the situation on the ground in Kabul, as fresh evidence emerges of human rights abuses by the new Taliban regime.\n\nOpen season: The Guardian’s Aubrey Allegretti and team have received briefings against Raab from far and wide across the government and Tory Party. A Whitehall source tells the paper the foreign secretary “refused to be contacted on basically anything” for more than a week while he was on holiday throughout the Taliban advance. The source claims “there was an incredibly high bar to getting him to look at anything while on holiday.” Ambassadors are also sticking the boot in. A senior diplomatic source tells the Guardian there had been frustrations about a lack of support from Raab for weeks, accusing him of failing to contact any of the key U.K. ambassadors in the region. They blasted: “You don’t need a team of staff to do that, you just need to be a decent human being to say, ‘How are you doing? It’s going to be a tough few weeks, how can I help?’”\n\nPersonality clash: This sort of remark has become a bit of a theme among Raab’s internal critics over the past few days. A Whitehall official tells Playbook Raab demonstrated a “coldness” that was inappropriate for the situation at hand, suggesting the role of foreign secretary would be better carried out by someone with a personality more suited to international diplomacy. An anonymous Tory MP tells the Guardian Raab’s position is “untenable” and that “not coming home was his biggest mistake.” Downing Street insisted it still had confidence in him last night.\n\nBad call: The Mail’s John Stevens moves the story on with another punchy splash this morning. On Thursday he reported Raab had delegated the key call about saving interpreters to Afghan Foreign Minister Mohammad Hanif Atmar to junior Foreign Minister Zac Goldsmith. Today he reveals the call was never made, raising further questions over whether the government could have done more to get the Afghans who have worked for Britain out.\n\nLife’s a beach: The Telegraph’s Harry Yorke, Ben Riley-Smith and Steve Bird have more tough reading for Raab. They report that he was in fact on holiday from August 6 — begging the question of why he organized a fairly long holiday for a time when he must have known the Americans were withdrawing from Afghanistan, and why he felt the need to stay out there rather than cut the break short.\n\nLook away now: The paper also has excruciating new claims from an eyewitness who saw Raab on the beach as Kabul fell to the Taliban: “I saw him on the beach on Sunday, from about 11.30am local time… We left the beach at 3.30pm and he was still there.” They said they saw Raab playing paddle ball, swimming, “running on the beach and washing the sand off his legs,” adding: “There was one point when I saw him using his mobile phone. It looked like he was checking messages or texts as he was sitting on his lounger. But I didn’t see him on the telephone talking.” The Foreign Office says this account is “wrong.”\n\nWhitehall away days: The Times’ Henry Zeffman, Larisa Brown and Steve Swinford have a cracker of a scoop revealing — almost unbelievably — that three of the country’s most senior civil servants responsible for overseeing the Afghan evacuation are *still* on holiday. Playbook cannot quite believe he is typing these words but Foreign Office Permanent Secretary Philip Barton, Home Office Permanent Secretary Matthew Rycroft and defense ministry Permanent Secretary David Williams are all away and have not come back despite the ongoing crisis. Makes you wonder what would have to happen to get anyone in the government to jump on a plane home. The Times story also quotes government sources saying hundreds more Afghans could have been helped to escape if the FCDO had done more to help rather than leave the evacuation to officials from the MoD.\n\nPushback 1: A senior government insider sought to defend Raab last night by insisting that even if he had picked up the phone to Atmar, it would have made little difference to the fate of the interpreters because the Afghan foreign minister was in the process of fleeing the country. Associated Press reported Atmar left Kabul on a Turkish Airlines flight to Istanbul on Monday, along with a host of other senior Afghan politicians.\n\nPushback 2: You won’t have missed the very serious action shots of Raab on the phone to his foreign counterparts yesterday. The message was presumably that the foreign secretary is indeed capable of using a phone. The Foreign Office last night released a statement from Raab outlining the results of his calls with G7 foreign ministers, calling for an “urgent need for the cessation of violence, respect for human rights including for women, children and minorities, inclusive negotiations about the future of Afghanistan, and the need for all parties to respect international humanitarian law.” That should do it.\n\nFCDO turns on Raab: If he gets past the flashpoint of the beach embarrassment and the row over his missed call, Raab’s main problem going forward is that he appears to have lost the confidence of staff at the Foreign Office. It has been the case for some time now that the FCDO civil servants have such low regard for their minister, they’ve leaked a slew of damaging stories about his running of the department to the press over the course of several months. A FCDO official told Playbook this week that the opinion of Raab among senior, mid-ranking and junior civil servants in his own department was “unanimous” and at “rock bottom.” As humiliating as the last few days have been, demonstrating he has a command of his staff may be the key factor in whether he keeps his job.\n\nJustice for Raab: The FT’s Jasmine Cameron-Chileshe and Seb Payne have the latest gossip on Boris Johnson’s plans for a Cabinet reshuffle. They quote an ally of the PM who says Raab is in the frame to be moved by the time the pack is shuffled: “He will have served two and a half years by that point and moving Dom opens up a much bigger shake-up of the government.” A member of the government tells the paper that Raab could replace Robert Buckland as justice secretary.\n\nLabour scents blood: Shadow Foreign Secretary Lisa Nandy — who is also calling for Raab to go — fired off a whopping 18 questions last night about his conduct. Highlights include: “Did you receive advice from officials on the advisability of leaving the country as the situation in Afghanistan deteriorated? In particular was the permanent under-secretary of the FCDO aware of your absence and did he provide advice on its timing and suitability given the circumstances?” … “Will you publish a full list of calls and meetings, including dates and times, that you conducted whilst out of the country on holiday? Did you speak to the prime minister while on holiday? If not, when did you first speak to him upon your return?” … and “When did detailed planning for the evacuation of British nationals and Afghans eligible for support begin? Did you receive, review or approve those plans at any stage?” Don’t expect an answer.\n\nOne more question: Sky’s Tamara Cohen and Tom Rayner report ministers ignored a warning eight months ago from the international relations and defense select committee in the House of Lords that the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan could undermine the Afghan government and result in civil war. The report submitted in January found the government had “shown little inclination to exert an independent voice on policy in Afghanistan” and “instead has followed the lead of the U.S. and has been too reticent in raising its distinctive voice.”\n\nRaab fan club assemble: By Playbook’s count there was one Tory MP willing to go out on the record to give a fulsome defense of the foreign secretary yesterday. Angela Richardson tweeted: “Thanks for everything you do. I know that you are working around the clock no matter where you are located and as Foreign Sec. that means any time zone, anywhere.” Almost brings a tear to your eye.\n\nLATEST FROM KABUL\n\nDOOR TO DOOR: Afghans who worked for the West are in imminent danger from Taliban reprisals as the situation on the ground deteriorates. A report from the RHIPTO Norwegian Center for Global Analyses, which provides intelligence to the U.N., has found Taliban militants are going door to door looking for people who worked for NATO and threatening their families — which obviously flies in the face of the group’s ridiculous PR charade this week (my POLITICO colleague Saim Saeed has a must-read on that topic). The story is leading the BBC this morning.\n\nBreaking overnight: A new report from Amnesty International has found Taliban fighters massacred nine ethnic Hazara men in the Ghazni province last month. Six of the men were shot and three were tortured to death. Amnesty says it has been on the ground in Afghanistan in the last few days and has verified the killings.\n\nJournalists under threat: Taliban fighters hunting a journalist who works for Germany’s Deutsche Welle have shot dead a member of his family and seriously injured another, DW reports. DW’s Director General Peter Limbourg said: “The killing of a close relative of one of our editors by the Taliban yesterday is inconceivably tragic, and testifies to the acute danger in which all our employees and their families in Afghanistan find themselves. It is evident that the Taliban are already carrying out organized searches for journalists, both in Kabul and in the provinces.”\n\nEvacuation latest: There are serious issues emerging with the U.S. evacuations from Kabul. The Pentagon last night admitted that U.S. Air Force C-17 flights are leaving the airport nearly half empty as the Americans struggle to get Afghans on board, on what seems like a shocking waste of times and resources given some estimates say there are just five days left to fly people out of the country. U.S. President Joe Biden will give an update on the evacuation efforts at 6 p.m. London time, the White House said overnight.\n\nUnbelievable: An absolute shocker of a story from my U.S. colleagues on POLITICO’s National Security Daily newsletter. They report: “Even though U.S. officials tell NatSec Daily and others that evacuation flights from Kabul will be free, people trying to catch a plane in the Afghan capital say differently. One person said State Department staff were seeking large payments — up to $2,000 — from American passengers and even more from non-U.S. citizens. When we relayed what this person told us to the State Department, a spokesperson didn’t deny that this is happening. ‘U.S. law requires that evacuation assistance to private U.S. citizens or third country nationals be provided ‘on a reimbursable basis to the maximum extent practicable.’ The situation is extremely fluid, and we are working to overcome obstacles as they arise,’ the spokesperson said.”\n\nIn other words: The Biden administration may request payments for evacuation flights.\n\nAnd a British shocker too: The Guardian’s Amelia Gentleman reports 125 British Embassy guards in Kabul have been told they are not eligible for evacuation, despite being under threat from the Taliban, because they were hired through an outsourced contractor. More than 100 guards doing the same job for the U.S. Embassy were evacuated by the American government. The Foreign Office will be under huge pressure today to resolve this issue.\n\nMore pressure on Biden: The U.S. president and his team were warned last month in a State Department memo that Kabul could fall to the Taliban soon after the American withdrawal, the Wall Street Journal is reporting. The paper says: “The classified cable represents the clearest evidence yet that the administration had been warned by its own officials on the ground that the Taliban’s advance was imminent and Afghanistan’s military may be unable to stop it.”\n\nYikes: If you need an indication of how bad relations are between the British government and the Biden administration, a U.K. government official last night sent Playbook a BBC story from 2012 on papers released from Osama bin Laden’s hideout, in which the Al-Qaeda leader ordered his militants to attempt to assassinate U.S. President Barack Obama, but told them not to target Joe Biden because, in bin Laden’s words, “Biden is totally unprepared for that post [of president], which will lead the U.S. into a crisis.” When the British are half-seriously agreeing with Osama bin Laden’s analysis of the U.S. president, you know things have gone badly wrong.\n\nTODAY IN WESTMINSTER\n\nPARLIAMENT: In recess until September 6.\n\nTRADE SCOOP: Labour has accused the government of “sitting on the fence” over calls to reform a decades-old global energy market agreement ahead of COP26, my POLITICO colleagues Emilio Casalicchio and Graham Lanktree report. Put together in the wake of the Cold War, the agreement allows private companies to sue governments if their future profits are hurt by new legislation, something that has hurt nations that have tried to restrict their fossil fuel industries. In a letter seen by POLITICO’s Morning Trade U.K. newsletter, Shadow Trade Secretary Emily Thornberry has called for her counterpart Liz Truss to lead the way by calling for the removal of protections for fossil fuel investments and use COP26 to bring other nations on board. More here for POLITICO Pro Trade subscribers.\n\nMASK WARS: Not since the old days have we had such an easily meme-able image of the Commons as Wednesday’s recall, when it was instantly noticeable that hardly any Conservatives were wearing masks whereas almost all Labour MPs were. Now, POLITICO’s Esther Webber has seen a letter from parliament’s trade unions to the speaker in which they say there’s been an “uptick” in COVID cases among security staff at Westminster. All security staff on duty in parliament this week have now been instructed to take a test and to wear face coverings at all times. The speaker has always maintained he cannot mandate mask-wearing, and a House of Commons spokesperson stresses parliament is “a COVID-secure workplace, meeting all government guidance.”\n\nWhat’s behind the divide? One Tory MP suggested Labour MPs were “virtue-signalling” with their insistence on masks. Another offered a slightly more nuanced take on why the Tories are eschewing mask-wearing: “Partly because Labour do, partly because it’s (sub-consciously?) in our interest to show the pandemic is over, and partly because of a genuine desire to see parliament up and running.” He added: “Let’s hope we don’t have the parliament variant followed by the conference variants.” Eek.\n\nName change: Highways England has changed its name to National Highways. Along with a new chief executive, the government says it marks a fresh start for the agency and reflects that it’s actually responsible for setting standards across the whole country. Here’s Transport Secretary Grant Shapps’ tweet announcing the change.\n\nMINISTERIAL MEMORIES: The IfG has released a new set of archive interviews with former ministers from the David Cameron, Theresa May and Boris Johnson governments detailing their experiences. Top lines include the former Health Secretary Andrew Lansley attacking his successors for being “obsessed” with NHS management, former Fire Service Minister Nick Hurd criticizing the government’s approach to tragedies like Grenfell, and former Scotland, Welsh and Northern Ireland Office Minister Alan Duncan claiming he never spoke to Boris Johnson or Theresa May about his role.\n\nFact check: Somewhat bizarrely, former Northern Ireland Minister Andrew Murrison is also in there moaning that “middle-aged males” are never given the “plum jobs” in government for “political reasons.” Twenty-one of 27 Cabinet posts in the current government — and three of the four great offices of state — are filled by men between the age of 40 and 60, more commonly referred to as middle-aged males.\n\nYESTERDAY’S UK COVID STATS: 36,572 new cases, ⬆️ 2,668 on Wednesday. In the last seven days there have been 214,736 positive cases, ⬆️ 15,530 on the previous week … 113 reported deaths within 28 days of a positive test, ⬆️ 2 on Wednesday. In the last seven days 674 deaths have been reported, ⬆️ 59 on the previous week. As of the latest data 6,379 COVID patients are in hospital.\n\nVAX STATS: A total 47,460,526 people or 87.3 percent of adults — now including 16 and 17 year olds — have received a first dose, ⬆️ 47,284. A total 41,157,069 people or 75.7 percent of adults have received a second dose, ⬆️ 169,223.\n\nBOOSTER NEWS: The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation is expected to decide imminently on its recommendation for booster vaccines, the Times’ Rhys Blakely reports. The Telegraph‘s Laura Donnelly says plans for boosters for all over-50s could be shelved.\n\nCURING LONG COVID: With millions around the globe estimated to have long COVID, the search for a treatment is ramping up. Scientists are investigating the efficacy of drugs such as anti-inflammatories, cardiovascular medicines and even a medicinal herb, reports POLITICO’s Carlo Martuscelli.\n\nSTATE OF THE UNION\n\nSNP/GREENS LATEST: The SNP and Scottish Greens look to have reached an agreement on a power-sharing deal at Holyrood, with the BBC reporting white smoke could emerge today. The parties have been negotiating over the small print of a cooperation agreement all summer, which will see Green MSPs given ministerial roles and a say in some policy areas in exchange for a formalization of the pro-independence majority in Holyrood. Nicola Sturgeon’s Cabinet will meet this morning, while Green members have been promised they will receive the wording of any agreement by August 20 — today.\n\nTHE BIG NEWS: Barring any truly monumental last-minute shocks, Alex Cole-Hamilton will be confirmed today as the new leader of the Scottish Liberal Democrats. Nominations close at 3 p.m, after which Cole-Hamilton — the only person to have put themselves forward — will be crowned as the successor to Willie Rennie.\n\nAlex Cole-Hamilton pen portrait: Born in England but living in Scotland since he was eight, Cole-Hamilton is the MSP for Edinburgh Western. Overcame unfavorable polls to hold the seat in May with a stonking majority of almost 10,000. The lifelong Lib Dem will need more of that spirit as he takes on a greatly depleted party with just four MSPs — not even enough to qualify as an official party in Holyrood. Good pals with Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar. Has said he is open to working with either Sarwar or Scottish Tory leader Douglas Ross to counter the nationalists in Holyrood. Apparently a keen surfer. Also rents out his shed to tourists on Airbnb for £49 a night, if you’re interested. Would hope to at least match his Airbnb 4.73 star rating as he takes on the Scottish Lib Dem leadership today.\n\nMEDIA ROUND\n\nArmed Forces Minister James Heappey broadcast round: Sky News (7.05 a.m.) … Today program (7.15 a.m.) … LBC (7.50 a.m.) … Times Radio breakfast (8.15 a.m.) … ITV GMB (8.30 a.m.).\n\nShadow Security Minister Conor McGinn broadcast round: Times Radio breakfast (7.20 a.m.) … Sky News (8.05 a.m.) … talkRADIO (8.20 a.m.).\n\nAlso on the Today program: Crossbench peer Jonathan Evans (7.50 a.m.).\n\nAlso on Good Morning Breakfast (ITV): Former army Colonel Ash Alexander Cooper (7.20 a.m.).\n\nAlso on Sky News breakfast: Former adviser to Boris Johnson Craig Dillon (7.30 a.m.) … Reader in Sociology Liza Schuster (7.30 a.m.).\n\nAlso on Nick Ferrari at Breakfast (LBC): Former British Chambers of Commerce Director John Longworth (9.05 a.m.).\n\nAlso on Times Radio breakfast: Aisha Khurram, a student in Kabul and a former Afghan youth rep to the U.N.
