The first stage of the proposed development will comprise the installation of two 250 MW/1,000 MWh ‚Äòsub facilities‚Äô featuring 656 #batteryenclosures, 164 #inverters and up to four 330/33kV #transformer units. ‚ÄúThe CBESS will connect via the existing Shotts Terminal to the South West Interconnected System (SWIS), the #electricitygrid that supplies power to Perth and more than one million homes and businesses between Geraldton and Esperance and east to Kalgoorlie.‚Äù ‚ÄúSynergy said the battery will help provide the state‚Äôs #powergrid with the capacity it needs to remain reliable and affordable as the state moves towards #emissionsfreepowergeneration in 2030.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe proposal is pivotal to Synergy‚Äôs energy transition program and represents a generational opportunity to support #carbonemissionsreduction and #secureenergysupply,‚Äù the application reads.‚Äù https://lnkd.in/exAJAWev?

With the increasing need to harness renewable energy and maintain grid stability, developers are actively seeking land near substations for new BESS projects. üîã Key Benefits for Landowners: - Substantial Income Potential: Leasing land for BESS offers a lucrative alternative source of revenue. - Strategic Locations: Proximity to substations or grid connection points enhances the attractiveness of the land and leads to competitive lease offers. BESS developments not only support sustainable energy but also provide a compelling financial opportunity for landowners. As the market expands, strategic land leases will play a crucial role in advancing our renewable energy infrastructure. List your land with Renewables Connect and discover its full potential. #RenewableEnergy #BatteryStorage #LandInvestment #BESS #RenewablesConnect\n\nCabinet approves the Scheme titled Viability Gap Funding for the development of BESS. Prime Minister approves the Scheme for Viability Gap Funding (VGF) for the development of Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS). The approved scheme envisages the development of 4,000 MWh of BESS projects by 2030-31, with financial support of up to 40% of the capital cost as budgetary support in the form of Viability Gap Funding (VGF). This move is a testament to a greener, more sustainable future. By reducing the cost of battery storage systems, we're paving the way for clean, reliable, and affordable electricity for all. The BESS Scheme is designed to tap into the vast potential of renewable energy sources like solar and wind power. It's all about providing clean and efficient power to our citizens. The initial outlay of Rs. 9,400 crore, including a budgetary support of Rs. 3,760 crore. To achieve a Levelized Cost of Storage (LCoS) ranging from Rs. 5.50-6.60/(kWh), making stored renewable energy a viable option to meet peak power demand across the nation. The VGF shall be disbursed in five tranches linked with the various stages of implementation of BESS projects. At least 85% of the BESS project capacity will be available to Distribution Companies (DISCOMs). This will optimize transmission networks and reduce the need for costly infrastructure upgrades. BESS developer selection will be through a transparent competitive bidding process, promoting a level playing field for both public and private sector entities. This encourages growth, investments, and opportunities. The Government of India is steadfast in its commitment to clean and green energy solutions. The BESS Scheme is a monumental step towards realizing this vision.\n\nU.S. energy storage developers installed a record amount of capacity in the third quarter, despite project delays, according to the American Clean Power Association and Wood Mackenzie. https://lnkd.in/gEAsRv8w Elevate Renewables‚Ñ¢ is actively developing a pipeline of utility-scale energy storage projects which are co-located at existing power generation facilities owned by Arclight Capital Partners throughout the US. Elevate is also active in energy markets throughout the US where the rapid growth of intermittent renewable energy, such as solar, wind and offshore wind, has created a need for flexible, dispatchable renewable energy which can uniquely be met by utility scale battery storage. The Company is focused on enhancing the resiliency, reliability, and efficiency of the nation‚Äôs aging and overtaxed power grids in a way that benefits the planet, their stakeholders, and the broader communities in which these facilities currently operate.

The flexible energy storage facility, set to be completed by the end of 2024, will be capable of providing the grid with a total 300MWh of flexible capacity as it can operate for two hours at a time. SSE Renewables‚Äô solar and battery director Richard Cave-Bigley said: ‚ÄúFerrybridge used to be a coal site; but today we‚Äôve evolved to building a 150MW flexible battery asset that can store the energy we need to help get to net-zero.‚Äù Among SSE Renewables‚Äô projects, Ferrybridge is the second battery storage project being built. A 50MW BESS site in Salisbury will be operational by the end of 2023. Planning consent has also been granted for battery storage projects at Fiddler‚Äôs Ferry (150MW) and Monk Fryston (320MW).

Notably, both projects are taking place in one of the country's richest oil provinces, Alberta, & will help enable fossil fuel companies to meet GHG emission reduction targets. The 101 MW Saddlebrook project is partially supported by $10M in funding from Emissions Reduction Alberta (ERA), through their BEST Challenge, to support the development of a hybrid solar generation facility combined with a flow battery energy storage system, the first of its kind in North America. Additionally, the 81 MW Scotford project is expected to contribute approximately $200,000 a year on a levelized basis to the Strathcona County local government & school system. #cleantech #cleanenergy #renewables #solarenergy #renewableenergy #climatetech #greentech #greenenergy #esg #sustainability\n\nToday‚Äôs CSIRO GenCost analysis has confirmed that open cycle gas power plants have the lowest capital costs, even lower than solar and wind, proving again that gas generation is the perfect partner for renewables ‚Äì but urgent reforms to the Capacity Investment Scheme are required for gas to be able to play its vital role. APGA chief executive Steve Davies says gas-powered power stations have the lowest capital costs and are the most dependable when it comes to delivery times ‚Äì but this vital firming remains outside the scope of the Capacity Investment Scheme. ‚ÄúOpen-cycle GPG has the lowest capital costs of all generation forms and clearly provides the best ‚Äòbang for the taxpayers‚Äô buck‚Äô as a firming partner to variable renewables such as solar and wind.‚Äù https://hubs.ly/Q02y3cdb0\n\nClearway Energy Group has secured US$700 million in construction financing for a solar and storage portfolio in California. This financing, supported by NORD/LB, Societe Generale, KeyBanc Capital Markets, DNB, and ANZ, will fund the Luna Valley Solar Project and Daggett Storage in Fresno and San Bernardino counties, respectively. The Luna Valley Solar Project boasts a 200MW capacity, while Daggett Storage offers an output of 113.5MW. Both projects, currently under construction by Blattner Energy, are set to begin operations in 2025. Clearway has already secured long-term #powerpurchaseagreements (PPAs) for these projects, including a 15-year hybrid PPA with San Diego Gas & Electric and a 20-year PPA with Southern California Edison (SCE) and Power & Water Resources Pooling Authority. According to Brooks Friedeman, VP of Capital Markets at Clearway, these projects are crucial steps towards a reliable, affordable, and clean electric grid in California. #solarenergy #renewableenergy #california #cleanenergy #energytransition #solarinstallation #solarproject"
