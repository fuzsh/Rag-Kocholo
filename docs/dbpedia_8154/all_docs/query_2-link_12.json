        "text": "What’s driving the day in London.\n\nBy ESTHER WEBBER\n\nSend tips here | Subscribe for free | Listen to Playbook and view in your browser\n\nTRAVEL UPDATE: After the disruption caused by yesterday’s train strikes, Tube workers are on strike today, with more industrial action on the trains tomorrow. Good luck out there.\n\nGood morning. This is Esther Webber. Annabelle Dickson will be back in the hot seat kicking off next week.\n\nDRIVING THE DAY\n\nLETTER FROM AMERICA: Liz Truss’ Downing Street would face an uphill battle in its relations with the White House, POLITICO’s U.S. team reports in an essential piece lifting the lid on how she’s viewed in Washington. A trip to New York for the U.N. General Assembly will be the first order of business on the world stage for the next PM, where they will get to set the tone on a number of foreign policy items relevant to the Americans’ interests.\n\nKeeping up appearances: POLITICO’s Ryan Heath and Ella Creamer have together spoken to 19 people who’ve worked with Truss, from the White House and Congress, federal agencies, think tanks and the British diplomatic ranks, and found things are not about to get any easier. A U.S. diplomat said the dynamic is “unlikely to change” at one level regardless of who takes over in Downing Street, because defense cooperation provides stability to the relationship. Territorial and economic challenges from China and Russia — in which Truss takes a keen interest — will help keep London and Washington broadly aligned.\n\nBut, but, but: Beyond that, Truss faces some pretty hefty challenges over the Northern Ireland protocol and a potential trade deal with the U.S. Mujtaba Rahman, Eurasia Group’s managing director for Europe, predicts that unless Truss addresses her poor relationship with the EU, the U.S.-U.K. relationship “is not going to flourish.” Meanwhile, she will need Republican support to have any hope of securing trade agreement under President Joe Biden. Even that might not be enough. “It will take a change in the White House to a pro-free trader president” for Truss to unlock a trade deal, says Luke Coffey, a former Conservative Party adviser now at the Hudson Institute.\n\nThrowing shade: More pointedly, Ryan and Ella hear that one of the topics of discussion in D.C. social circles is her intellectual capacity. One former British diplomat described Truss’ early ministerial forays to Washington as “a bit awkward in both group and one-to-one settings” and said she “didn’t leave much of an impression.”\n\nMore than meets the eye: Playbook notes that’s what a few people said privately about her here, too, before she became the one to beat, and those who’ve worked closely with Truss reject the criticisms. “She’s not stupid, not at all,” said one senior British diplomat. “Her public persona is dominated by being phenomenally pro-British, but there’s more to her than people sometimes assume. She’s not a right-wing reactionary.”\n\nWhat about the other one? Rishi Sunak’s foreign policy is not receiving as much attention — partly because Truss appears to be so consistently ahead, partly because he’s never served in an international-facing brief. But if you’re interested in what it might look like, here’s one we wrote earlier.\n\nNORTH BY NORTH WEST: Back on this side of the pond, Truss and Sunak are destined for Manchester, where GB News’ Alistair Stewart will chair the ninth hustings for party members. Ahead of the meeting, Truss is emphasizing she will make economic growth her “defining mission” with two new vocational institutions in the north and delivery of the original Northern Powerhouse Rail plan. Sunak is focusing on public services with a promise to improve access to dentists.\n\nThe guru speaks: Truss will head north bolstered by the prediction of legendary polling soothsayer John Curtice, who reckons she is bound to be the next prime minister unless she “fouls up in some spectacular fashion” in the final stages of the Tory leadership contest. He tells the Times’ Steven Swinford that there is only a 5 percent chance of victory for Sunak. It follows hot on the heels of a YouGov poll for Sky News, showing that Truss retains a 32-point lead over Sunak.\n\nOperation moonshot: Sunak’s allies insist this does not reflect what they’re seeing on the ground, after Sunak told ITV’s This Morning he still has a “shot” at Downing Street despite the indications to the contrary in successive polls.\n\nBerry boost: Northern Research Group chair and Truss backer Jake Berry is on the broadcast rounds this morning, and has penned an op-ed in the Express (not yet online) in which he says her “ambitious, growth-led vision for the North will deliver on leveling up.” To him this means “stronger regions, empowered to seek investment, centers of educational excellence and a commitment to more money remaining in people’s pockets will tackle regional inequality, in a Conservative way.”\n\nJob for Jake? One well-placed former Tory adviser suggested to Playbook that in the great tussle for jobs in a Truss Cabinet, she might be tempted to hand Berry the role of transport secretary, effectively saying: “Here, you sort it out.”\n\nThe north expects: A long-serving Conservative councillor from a Tory-held marginal in the north west told Playbook that Sunak holds greater electoral clout there, because he could appeal to “the voters we target in the center” in seats such as Cheadle and Hazel Grove (both previously held by the Lib Dems). At the same time “the message he’s been driving home that inflation doesn’t help any of us will resonate particularly in some of the seats where levels of deprivation are higher than in what you consider traditional Conservative seats,” this councillor said.\n\nHard act to follow: Another local Conservative councillor said seats such as Bury North and Heywood and Middleton had been won “because of Boris, no question about it” and that while Truss “is pandering to a certain wing of the party to get elected as the Boris continuity candidate, she’s not going to be able to deliver on it because she isn’t Boris Johnson.”\n\nGOING POSTAL: It’s not often that you get Tory leadership updates from trade union rallies, but attendees at the Enough is Enough campaign launch on Wednesday heard that the strike by the Communication Workers’ Union could cause issues for postal voting in the leadership contest. The first strike day takes place next Friday with another planned for August 31, two days before the deadline for voting.\n\nYou’ve (not) got mail: A Conservative Party source told Playbook they were getting lots of queries from members who had not received their ballot papers, while the central point of contact for the contest — [email protected] — has been “inundated” with similar complaints. CCHQ could not be reached for comment.\n\nBACK TO BLACK: TalkTV has unearthed a report co-written by Truss in 2009 in which she argued for cutting doctors’ pay by 10 percent, charging all patients to see their GP and cutting big military procurement projects. The document for the Reform think tank entitled “Back to Black” proposes cuts to the pensions, education and communities budgets as part of an ideological push to shrink the size of the state under the then Labour government. The Truss campaign told Talk TV’s News Desk: “Co-authoring a document does not mean that someone supports every proposal put forward.”\n\nWhat her opponents are saying: As Labour fumed that it shows her “true colors,” a Sunak campaign member quipped: “I think people should be more worried about her plan for the economy this autumn.”\n\nFARMERS’ FURY: While Truss leans into her NRG connections today, Sunak is courting the rural vote. He will attend an NFU hustings later as Truss gets slammed for “snubbing” farmers. Minette Batters, president of the NFU, told the Guardian’s Helena Horton that despite offering to meet Truss anywhere, even on Zoom, at a time of her choosing, she has refused to come to a farming hustings. Batters said it was a “shame” Truss did not want to attend the hustings, adding: “It doesn’t bode well — George Eustice has made his comments — you would think she would want to put her marker down.”\n\nClapback: Truss’ team said she “cannot turn up to everything” and was making an effort to speak to tens of thousands of Conservative members across the U.K. The NFU’s hustings for members will take place in private with Sunak this afternoon.\n\nAnother no-show: Neither of the candidates will attend a hustings organized by disabled Conservative members, the Disability News Service reports. Truss is sending Chloe Smith, minister for disabled people, to answer questions today, while Sunak will be sending Matt Hancock to speak for him on August 26 — both events having been set up by the Conservative Disability Group and the Conservative Mental Health Group.\n\nCAMPAIGN ROUNDUP\n\nNO MONEY LEFT: The i’s Hugo Gye and Arj Singh report the Office for Budget Responsibility could blow a hole in Truss’ economic plans when it issues an updated forecast next month. She has consistently argued her tax cuts are affordable because of £30 billion fiscal headroom, but the OBR is expected to cut that in half.\n\nReaganomics’ revenge: There’s a growing disquiet about where the foreign secretary will get the money for her plans, with neither candidate saying much about what they’d cut apart from the old “efficiency savings” chestnut. Danny Finkelstein’s Times column tells the story of Ronald Reagan’s economic adviser, David Stockman, and his collision with reality, concluding: “Most of the cabinet seem to have aligned themselves with the idea of cutting tax and the candidate who would do so, yet none have explained what the smaller state they are advocating might look like in their own area.”\n\nWinter is coming: Writing for the New Statesman, former Treasury Minister David Gauke adds more fuel to the speculation that Truss might want to adopt Labour’s energy price cap freeze. While it may be a blunt instrument, it is reversible, he points out, and “if the new prime minister cannot make proper use of the powers of the state to help people through the coming emergency, it is going to be a long, miserable winter.”\n\nGet back: The Labour Party has written to the prime minister and both leadership candidates demanding the recall of parliament on Monday in order to freeze energy bills before the new energy price cap rise announcement next Friday. Shadow Commons leader Thangam Debbonaire says in the letter: “Across Britain, people are having to make unthinkable choices about how to pay their bills,” and they deserve a government “ready to take the action needed now.” The Truss and Sunak campaigns declined to comment last night on the call by Labour.\n\nKen not keen: Former Chancellor Ken Clarke has weighed in on the race, accusing both candidates, as well as Keir Starmer, of offering “half-baked” ideas on the economy. He told The House magazine’s Sienna Rodgers they are all “guilty of trying to cheer up better-off pensioners” and “throwing money at the problem every day in their campaigning at the moment.” He also criticized their policies as regressive, saying: “The trouble with things like taking off the green levy, or abolishing VAT on power, or certainly cutting income tax, is that it helps absolutely everybody.”\n\nSTRIKE ACTION: Truss has renewed her commitment to crack down on trade unions, telling the Express’ Sam Lister and Michael Knowles she will stop them “holding the country to ransom.” She has promised to introduce new laws within a month of taking office to impose minimum rail service levels and raise ballot thresholds to make it harder for strike action to take place across all sectors.\n\nSOLAR EFFORT: Ahead of his audience with NFU members, Sunak has pledged that new solar panels must be installed on buildings rather than farmland. He’s shared his plans with the Telegraph’s Daniel Martin, though anyone who’s sat through as many hustings as Playbook has will know this is already one of Truss’ most popular applause lines.\n\nTooth to power: Sunak’s plans to “restore” NHS dentistry get widespread coverage today, with the Telegraph picking out his idea of sending dentists into schools to check on young children’s teeth. The former chancellor has also published a “plan for young people” on his website, bigging up his role in bringing about the Kickstart scheme.\n\nKeeping faith: Sunak visited a local temple in Watford ahead of the Hindu festival of Janmashtami. He said: “Faith is a really important part of my life … As prime minister I will be an active champion of religious freedom and faith in British national life.” The occasion gets a lot of pick-up — in the Indian press.\n\nThat’s a wrap: Less successful was Sunak’s visit to the This Morning sofa, where he spoke about his daughters ordering the breakfast wrap at McDonald’s — an item which was discontinued two years ago. A Sunak campaign source said: “Rishi has barely seen his kids in the last two-and-a-half years since he became chancellor so there has been almost no opportunity to share a McDonald’s with them.” Hat tip to the Times’ Geraldine Scott, who spotted the slip-up.\n\nCOFFEY ADDICT: In a Times column full of great snippets — including that Truss’ favorite song is “The Man” by Taylor Swift — Katy Balls writes that one charge thrown at her is that she will be “continuity Boris.” Her suggestion she would vote to scrap the Commons investigation into whether Johnson lied over Partygate certainly has some MPs worried that mistakes of the past could be repeated. But Balls hears there are some things she will do differently, having concluded that the No. 10 operation was too macho under Johnson. There are plans to appoint the first ever female Conservative chief whip. Thérèse Coffey, the politician to whom Truss is closest, is viewed as the prime candidate for the job.\n\n**During this change of power in the Tory party, POLITICO Pro helps you keep track of all policy developments.

First up, the Times’ Chris Smyth and Kat Lay have discovered that concern is mounting in government about the scale of staff shortages this winter, prompting Health Secretary Steve Barclay to argue for an overseas hiring spree to recruit thousands of nurses from countries such as India and the Philippines. There are currently 1.6 million staff in social care but more than 160,000 vacancies, with funding from local authorities squeezed.\n\nFace of a crisis: The Mirror’s Adam Aspinall and Martin Bagot have got an interview with the family of 87-year-old David Wakely, who faced a 15-hour wait for an ambulance after a fall, forcing his relatives to construct a makeshift tent to protect him where he lay. His son-in-law Trevor Crane tells the Mirror: “The system is just broken. As a family we know the NHS staff are great and trying their best but you have to ask how things like this keep happening?”\n\nLong tail of lockdown: The Department of Health has ordered an investigation into official statistics showing that around 1,000 more people than usual are currently dying each week from conditions other than COVID, the Telegraph’s Sarah Knapton reveals. The inquiry was prompted in part by concerns that the deaths are linked to delays to and deferment of treatment for conditions such as cancer, diabetes and heart disease.\n\nComing soon: The NHS will begin a new COVID vaccine booster campaign with jabs for care home residents and housebound people on September 5, ahead of a wider rollout from September 12. The booking system will open on September 5. The hope is that the rollout will curb and protect against the expected Omicron wave coming in the winter, with the oldest and most vulnerable set to be jabbed first.\n\nRAILROADED: Trade union bosses are warning of “indefinite” strikes, with new industrial action potentially being announced next week. RMT leader Mick Lynch vowed that his union “won’t be broken” and is prepared carry on with walkouts until its pay demands are met. Transport Secretary and Sunak backer Grant Shapps is on the morning round today.\n\nKeeping up Momentum: Sam Tarry, sacked from the Labour front bench for freelancing, was the guest of honor at a Momentum meeting last night — even though some of those present questioned where his real allegiances lie, given he was serving under Starmer until very recently. Labour MP Dawn Butler, also in attendance, told the gathering she is “embarrassed” by the shadow Cabinet’s position on strikes and called the current government “fascist,” Playbook hears.\n\nOuch: Several of the papers feature a picture of Jeremy Corbyn sporting a black eye on the picket line at Euston yesterday. Apparently it resulted from a confrontation with a tree root while jogging, rather than any political fisticuffs.\n\nLONG DARK KNIGHT OF THE SOUL: The i’s Arj Singh has a good follow on Playbook’s scoop that No. 10 comms chief Guto Harri could be in line for a knighthood. He’s spoken to former Standards Commissioner Alistair Graham, who says it would show Johnson’s “lack of judgment and proportionality.”\n\nCOMING ATTRACTION: Sky’s drama about No. 10’s handling of the first COVID wave is due out September 21. Any aides, former ministers or current leadership candidates reading can spot the portrayal’s of themselves in yesterday’s latest trailer, which featured Shri Patel as a decent likeness of Rishi Sunak and Simon Paisley Day as a not-quite-bald-enough Dominic Cummings. All of course joining Kenneth Branagh as the PM and Olivia Lovibond as Carrie. It looks like a lot of fun — trailer here.\n\nCRISIS OF CONFIDENCE: Consumer confidence has fallen to its lowest level since comparable records began almost 50 years ago, the FT’s Chris Giles reports. It’s more not-exactly-surprising-but-stark news, reflecting double-digit inflation, the largest drop in real wages for more than 20 years and mounting pressures across public services.\n\nBLOB LATEST: The Sun’s Jack Elsom has a readout of Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi’s call with Tory MPs, during which he tore into the Whitehall machine for “trying to shackle” long-term projects that would bring bills down. He warned that if civil servants did not get used to taking risks, “investment will think we are not serious and it will go elsewhere.” One option currently being explored by the Treasury is providing loans to energy suppliers who would in turn cut consumer costs.\n\nMAKING IT RAIN: Research by the Lib Dems out today shows water company bosses’ bonuses have risen by 20 percent over the last year despite the dumping of sewage in rivers and leaking pipes. The average annual bonus for a water company executive now stands at an eye-watering £670,000, they found. Their calculations make the front of the Metro and the Guardian.\n\nA-LEVELING DOWN: The Indy and Guardian both go big on regional divides in A-Level results. In their handy analysis, the BBC’s Hazel Shearing and Hannah Cox highlight that in London, 39 percent of A-levels this year were graded A* and A, compared with 30.8 percent of exam grades in the north east of England. Last year, it was 47.9 percent in London and 39.2 percent in the north east of England.\n\nGREEN LIGHT: Plans to put Drax Power Station at the center of efforts to boost renewable energy are set to be approved by the government, the Yorkshire Post’s Mason Boycott-Owen hears, in what could be a jobs boost for the area.\n\nNOTHING TO SEE HERE: Priti Patel has insisted Rwanda is a “safe” country after a judge ruled that some extracts from advice from the Foreign Commonwealth and Development Office to the Home Office on the plan could not be withheld from the public. One unnamed FCDO worker said torture and “even killings” are accepted in Rwanda. Sky News has more.\n\nSAFETY FIRST: A group of survivors and families affected by abuse on social media have written to the Tory leadership candidates to urge the next prime minister to prioritize the Online Safety Bill. It’s an interesting one as Truss has signaled she wants to revisit the legislation. The Indy’s Martyn Landi has a write-up.\n\nFERRIER GUILTY: Former SNP MP — and still-serving independent MP — Margaret Ferrier has pleaded guilty to breaching COVID rules by traveling despite knowing she had the virus. Back in September 2020, Ferrier earned universal condemnation when she admitted traveling to London from Glasgow by train while awaiting the results of a COVID test — and then after that test came back positive she decided to get the train back to Glasgow anyway. Her sentence will be announced next month. As the BBC’s Philip Sim points out, if the judge decides to confer a jail sentence on Ferrier she could be forced to resign and trigger a by-election in her Labour-SNP marginal seat.\n\nTODAY IN WALES: The first hosepipe ban to hit Wales for more than 30 years comes into force this morning, covering Pembrokeshire and parts of Carmarthenshire. BBC Wales has the duty.\n\nUKRAINE UPDATE: U.N. boss António Guterres has warned that fighting near the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in Ukraine is “suicide,” during a summit with Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Turkey’s Recep Tayyip Erdoğan in Lviv on Thursday. Zelenskyy asked Guterres to ensure the facility is protected. DW has more.\n\nUnderstanding Erdoğan: POLITICO’s Barbara Moens, Sarah Anne Arup and Paola Tamma had a useful curtain-raiser on the summit. “Of all the members of the NATO alliance, Erdoğan is easily the most slippery in terms of his allegiances,” they write.\n\nSaturday protest: Tomorrow, thousands of Afghans living in the U.K. will fly Afghan kites in an aerial protest at the treatment of their people as 50 percent of the population faces food poverty and starvation under Taliban rule.\n\nMEDIA ROUND\n\nGood Morning Britain: Shadow Commons leader Thangam Debbonaire (6.20 a.m.) … Transport Secretary Grant Shapps (8.30 a.m.).\n\nBBC Breakfast: Shadow Commons leader Thangam Debbonaire (6.50 a.m.) … Transport Secretary Grant Shapps (7.30 a.m.).\n\nKay Burley: Transport Secretary Grant Shapps (7.05 a.m.) … Shadow Commons leader Thangam Debbonaire (7.45 a.m.) … Nick Dent, TfL director of customer operations (8.05 a.m.) … Truss supporter Jake Berry (8.20 a.m.) … London Mayor Sadiq Khan (8.30 a.m.) … Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham (8.45 a.m.) … Sunak supporter Matt Hancock (9.15 a.m.).\n\nNick Ferrari at Breakfast (LBC): Former Energy U.K. CEO Angela Knight (7.05 a.m.) … Shadow Commons leader Thangam Debbonaire (7.10 a.m.) … TfL’s Nick Dent (7.20 a.m.) … Transport Secretary Grant Shapps (7.50 a.m.) … Former Defense Secretary Michael Portillo (9.20 a.m.).\n\nTimes Radio breakfast: Former Lib Dem leader Tim Farron (6.35 a.m.) … Transport Secretary Grant Shapps (7.20 a.m.) … NHS Confederation Chief Executive Matthew Taylor (8.07 a.m.) … Shadow Commons leader Thangam Debbonaire (8.35 a.m.) … Sunak supporter Matt Hancock (8.51 a.m.).\n\ntalkTV breakfast: The RMT’s Eddie Dempsey (7.05 a.m.) … Shadow Commons leader Thangam Debbonaire (7.20 a.m.) … Former Lib Dem leader Tim Farron (7.47 a.m.) … Truss supporter Jake Berry (8.32 a.m.) … Sunak supporter Matt Hancock (9.05 a.m.).\n\nReviewing the paper’s tonight: Sky News (10.30 and 11.30 p.m.): The Mirror’s Susie Boniface and the Telegraph’s Christopher Hope … Times Radio (10.30 p.m.): Almara Abgarian from Jam Press and Joe Mayes from Bloomberg.\n\nTODAY’S FRONT PAGES\n\n(Click on the publication’s name to see its front page.)\n\nDaily Express: Truss promises new laws to smash strike misery.\n\nDaily Mail: 43,00 scrambling for place at university.\n\nDaily Mirror: What has become of our country?\n\nDaily Star: Wish you weren’t here.\n\nFinancial Times: City watchdogs face big overhaul in Truss’s attack on ‘technocrats.’\n\ni: Truss to face ‘no money’ warning if she becomes PM.\n\nMetro: Feeling flush.\n\nPOLITICO UK: What Washington thinks about the next Queen Liz.\n\nPoliticsHome: Labour wants parliament recalled two weeks early to debate energy bill freeze.\n\nThe Daily Telegraph: Lockdown feared to be killing more than COVID.\n\nThe Guardian: Water bosses’ bonuses rose 20 percent amid pollution failings.\n\nThe Independent: A-levels show growing North-South divide.\n\nThe Sun: Queen’s grand-daughter works in garden centre.\n\nThe Times: Overseas hiring spree to rescue care homes.\n\nTHANK POD IT’S FRIDAY\n\nHow Westminster Works: Historians tell PolHome’s Alain Tolhurst the brutal secrets of parliament’s Westminster Hall.\n\nNewscast: The BBC’s Adam Fleming talks to the original voice of University Challenge, Roger Tilling.\n\nPolitics Weekly UK: The Guardian’s John Harris presents his summer reading list.\n\nRachel Johnson’s Difficult Women: Johnson interviews Children’s Commissioner Rachel de Souza.\n\nThe Bunker: Media journalist Helena Wadia joins Justin Quirk, Ahir Shah and Gavin Esler to discuss the threat social media poses to elections.\n\nThe Economist Asks: Jon Fasman asks Georgia State University law professor Eric Segall what’s next in the U.S. Supreme Court’s in-tray and whether reform is possible.\n\nLONDON CALLING\n\nWESTMINSTER WEATHER: ⛅️⛅️⛅️ Sunny in spells and breezy.
