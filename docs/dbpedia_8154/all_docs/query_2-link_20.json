        "text": "On 4th July, the All-Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) for Critical Minerals hosted Responsible Sourcing: Introduction to UK EITI. The event was an opportunity for stakeholders to come together to share their experiences of working with the EITI (Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative) and to discuss the value of transparency for sustainable growth. The UK Government was a prime mover in helping to establish the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) 20 years ago. The initiative remains an effective means of promoting greater understanding about natural resource management, strengthening public and corporate governance and accountability, and providing the data to inform policymaking and multi-stakeholder dialogue in the extractive sector. EITI now features 57 implementing nations, of which the UK is one. The event began with an introduction from the Vice Chair of the APPG, The Rt Hon the Baroness Lindsay Northover, and a video address from Sir Tony Blair. Baroness Northover then invited Tim Stern, Deputy Director of the FCDO-BEIS International Energy Unit, to deliver a presentation on UK EITI. Afterwards, Philipa Varris (Head of Sustainability, Horizonte Minerals Plc) and Jeff Geipel (Manager Director, Mining Shared Value, Engineers Without Borders Canada) were invited to share their experiences of working with EITI in developing nations such as Ghana. The two detailed the positive impacts that EITI implementation brought to local mining communities, as well as the value of multi-stakeholder dialogue in promoting transparency, democracy, and growth. Thank you to everyone who attended yesterday’s event, particularly Cherilyn Mackrory MP. We were delighted to welcome members of the EITI’s Secretariat and Multi-Stakeholder Group, as well as members of industry, academia, and UK government. We hope to see the UK continue to champion the EITI and the institution’s values of transparency and multi-stakeholder dialogue."
