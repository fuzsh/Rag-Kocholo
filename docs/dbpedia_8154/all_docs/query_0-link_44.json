A short clip from setting the scene for our recent online panel I chaired exploring the key issues surrounding the critical minerals race to net zero, including: 1 Looking at opportunities/risks for resource-rich African and Asia economies and the different approaches these countries are taking to develop mineral resources to stimulate investment into upgrading domestic value chains 2 The role critical minerals play in achieving a sustainable energy transition and the challenge of trying to solve climate change without exacerbating environmental degradation 3 How risk management practices are changing for mining companies and what that has meant for investment in the sector Many thanks to my excellent panelists who contributed their expertise to the discussion Silas Olang, Natural Resource Governance Institute Soad Chambazi, BENCHMARK MINERAL INTELLIGENCE LIMITED Fiona Blyth, Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office Olena Borodyna. ODI The whole event is available to watch here: https://lnkd.in/eWGCFS_T #criticalminerals #energytransition #geopolitics #riskmanagement #netzero\n\nAustralia's Critical Minerals Strategy promises to build \"genuine partnerships\" with First Nations people and host communities and “fairly share the benefits”. The strategy does not explain how this is to be achieved, or how the management of adverse risks or impacts should be handled, other than to defer to existing regulatory frameworks as “already fit for purpose”. Researcher Deanna Kemp et al in their new report concludes, 'without major reforms in policy and practice, the inequitable distribution of mining's impacts and benefits will persist.' 'Australia's critical minerals strategy is built on the idea that mining is a driver of equitable economic growth. However, many of the places that currently host large-scale mining operations still experience systemic and structural disadvantage. 'Without major reforms in government policy and industry practice, this situation will simply continue.' Read the new report, 'A socio-spatial analysis of Australia's critical minerals endowment and policy implications' authored by John Burton, Deanna Kemp, Rodger Barnes and Joni Parmenter in the link in the comments. #firstnations #aboriginal #torresstraitislander #indigenous #criticalminerals #transitionminerals #lithium #cobalt #nickel #copper #silicon Department of Industry, Science and Resources Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water #policy #regulation #mining #standards #fpic #investing #esg The University of Queensland Grateful for use of the photo Paul-Alain Hunt.\n\nIn a keynote address at the London Indaba today, Baroness Lindsay Northover member, House of Lords of the United Kingdom and vice chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Critical Minerals and ESG said that a case must be made for critical minerals – it must be about what the incoming UK government needs to do to work with African countries to promote responsible and resilient supply chains for critical minerals. “The first and most obvious thing is that the government should be taking action.” It took until 2022 to announce a critical minerals strategy, which featured in government’s 2023 refreshed integrated review. She said that a key concern is security of supply. There is a global recognition that there will be hugely increased demand for minerals like copper, lithium, rare earths, gold and more, for the transition the net zero. She said, “It matters what governments and international institutions do to help bridge the gap that exists for long lead, heavy capex projects, which are critical for short and long range national strategy.” She explained that a report that came out five days ago from the US Center for Strategic and International Affairs states that China has spent USD230-billion in supporting its EV sector alone, between 2009 and 2023. There is a determination in the West to establish independent, reliable and resilient supply chains. President Biden put in place the inflation Reduction Act, which authorizes almost USD400-billion for renewables. The EU has reacted with its critical raw materials act. Northover said, “The automotive industry in the UK has a turnover of almost 80 billion batteries for EVs which make up a large part of the cost of such vehicles, and we need to make those batteries onshore to meet the Rules of Origin requirements when selling to the EU; we need to make sure that we have our own supplies of the critical minerals that are required for the growth in green industries in the UK, but these must be sourced in a sustainable way.” She noted that opportunities of supply lie in Africa, but mining must now have the highest ESG standards to obtain the capital necessary to grow the industry – new investors that have traditionally not supported mining must be targeted, and government support is essential. She added that the UK’s potential new chancellor has made it clear that her overriding priority is to grow the economy, and recognizes that it is with the renewables that the future lies, she noted. #criticalminerals #LondonIndaba #mininginvestment #sustainablemining #netzero\n\nI'm grateful to have been able to provide feedback on British Columbia's Critical Minerals Strategy along with Jun Wei F. and Jason Currie. BC has tremendous potential to be a leader in the transition to sustainable energy. As a Canadian, I hope to be part of shaping BC's future in this transition. We identified the following key areas to be considered: - Research and Innovation: Investment in research areas, like modular processing plants, automation, and reclamation, is crucial for economic growth and talent attraction. - Connectivity: Fast internet is vital for remote mining communities, improving social inclusion, services, and operational efficiency. - Infrastructure and Transport: High-quality infrastructure supports efficient logistics, integrating rural communities with the region. - Benefit Distribution: Mining benefits should reach local communities and mining-adjacent sectors for the whole province. - Workforce and Immigration: Incentives, partnerships, and skilled immigrant integration are essential for a skilled labor force. - Inclusivity and Transparency: Inclusive development and supply chain transparency are vital for success. - Mine Permitting: Current regulations treat small-scale and large-scale mining operations equally, creating a disproportionate burden for small players.
