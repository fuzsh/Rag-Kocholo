        "text": "Social Affairs Editor Jackie Long is at an orchestra rehearsal in Welwyn Garden City, where musicians say they welcome the slight drop in inflation, but caution that costs of living still remain high.\n\nInflation falls from 1 per cent to 0.5 per cent, making a rise in interest rates even more unlikely.\n\nWhat cost of living crisis? That is the reality for Britain’s top bosses, who will have earned £27,000 in 2015 by the time they break for their tea and biscuits on Tuesday afternoon.\n\nChancellor George Osborne tells Channel 4 News voters have a choice between the government’s economic competence and the chaos of the alternatives of higher borrowing and higher taxation.\n\nSir Hugh Orde, head of the association of chief police officers, tells Channel 4 News that the latest round of cuts are the deepest he has ever known.\n\nAndrew Bailey, deputy governor of the Bank of England, tells Channel 4 News that a 45 per cent drop in oil prices is ‘likely to strengthen growth in the UK economy.’\n\nThe Russian rouble plunges further as it hits new lows, despite an emergency hike in interest rates to 17 per cent. As Russia’s economy appears to be heading for free-fall, should we care?\n\nWater bills for England and Wales will fall by an average of 5 per cent – not including inflation – over the next five years, the regulator Ofwat rules.\n\nFalling world oil prices bring some good news at the petrol pumps. But those revenues are also squeezing economies which are already under pressure.\n\nA bill that protects overseas aid today became law. Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg and Lib Dem Baroness Lindsay Northover discuss whether we can justify UK spending on aid.\n\nFrom empty spare rooms to community dog-sitting, Channel 4 News gets an exclusive look into a new report which suggests as much as a quarter of the UK population are part of the sharing economy.\n\nWhether you are a butcher, baker or candlestick maker, you can now find out who earns more than you and who is paid less.\n\nPrime Minister David Cameron gives a bleak assessment of the global economy and warns that the eurozone could be on the brink of recession.\n\nAfter outgoing Tesco Chairman Sir Richard Broadbent blanks questions on his leadership, new CEO Dave Lewis does agree to talk to Channel 4 News’ Economics Editor Paul Mason about the company’s woes."
