        "text": "Nick Clegg has turned down a job in Tim Farron's new Liberal Democrat shadow cabinet, while frontbench jobs have also been handed to people who lost their Commons seats at the election.\n\nThe former deputy prime minister was offered a post in Farron's new team but according to the party Clegg decided he wanted to take a \"quieter role\" on the backbenches.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNorman Lamb, the former coalition health minister who challenged Farron for the party leadership has been made health spokesman.\n\nLynne Featherstone, who lost her Hornsey and Wood Green seat in May, has been made energy and climate change spokesperson. And Lorely Burt, who lost her Solihull seat has been given the business brief.\n\nFeatherstone and Burt's appointments have triggered speculation they will soon be made members of the House of Lords.\n\nFarron said: \"I am delighted to be able to announce my team of party spokespeople. The team I am announcing today is the Liberal voice that Britain desperately needs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“It features some of the best campaigners that the party has, balanced with the experience and economic credibility that our party has developed over the last five years in government.\n\n“It was important to me to be able to call on the advice and experience of people at all levels of our party and I believe we have an excellent team to lead the Lib Dem fight back.\n\n“Together, we will take our ideas, our values and our liberal messages to every corner of Britain. We will make the case for housing, immigration, Europe, environmentalism and human rights.”\n\nIn May the Lib Dems were almost wiped out, losing all but eight of their 56 MPs. The Huffington Post understands Mark Williams, the only Lib Dem MP other than Clegg who has not been given a job today, will be handed a position soon.\n\nLib Dem spokesperson said: \"Tim will be announcing further appointments over the summer and I am sure Mark will be play a key role. Tim and Mark are good friends and I know that Tim will want to utilise Mark’s skills for the party in the months and years ahead.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLib Dem shadow cabinet in full:"
