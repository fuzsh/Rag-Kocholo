        "text": "A letter signed by more than 100 MPs and members of the House of Lords was today submitted to the UK Foreign Secretary, James Cleverly, to urge fresh approaches on the case of British-Egyptian pro-democracy writer Alaa Abd el-Fattah.\n\nIn their letter, the parliamentarians called on the government to take two particular actions directly under the Foreign Secretary’s control:\n\nFor the UK to lead on a joint statement at the UN Human Rights Council; and\n\nTo update the FCDO’s travel advice for British visitors to Egypt.\n\nIt has now been 18 months that the British embassy in Cairo has been prevented from visiting British national, Alaa Abd el-Fattah, in prison in Egypt. In February this year, FairSquare and the family of Alaa Abd el-Fattah submitted written evidence to Parliament’s Foreign Affairs Committee, urging the government to “end its sole reliance on a strategy of high-level lobbying” on the case.\n\nUpdate: on 3 August, a response was received from Lord Tariq Ahmad of Wimbledon, the Minister of State for the Middle East and North Africa. This can be read on the CAABU website.\n\nSubject: British national Alaa Abd el-Fattah and UK leadership role at the UN Human Rights Council\n\nDear Foreign Secretary,\n\nWe are writing to express our concern at the lack of progress on the case of Alaa Abd el-Fattah, six months on from the Prime Minister’s meeting with President Sisi in Sharm el-Sheikh. As a result, we are asking you to take the lead on a joint statement on Egypt at the UN Human Rights Council, and to update the UK’s travel advice for the country.\n\nYou are of course aware that while the two leaders were meeting, Alaa was perilously close to death, collapsing just days later. Since he chose to end his hunger and water strike, he has remained imprisoned in his cell and has still not received a single visit from a consular official, despite repeated commitments to Alaa’s family from British ministers and officials that they are doing everything they can.\n\nPrivate lobbying of the Egyptian government, even at the highest levels, is yet to deliver results. This calls for fresh approaches that draw on traditional British strengths of international diplomacy. The Human Rights Council presents a key opportunity for the UK to lead on a joint statement. The last collective expression of concern at the Council was in March 2021. In the months following this statement, the Egyptian authorities lifted the state of emergency and launched a new human rights strategy. While these largely cosmetic measures did not ultimately improve the dire human rights situation, they nonetheless indicate the attention the authorities pay to events at the Council.\n\nBritish leadership is necessary and critical. As a founding member of the Human Rights Council, which pledged when elected to “continue to hold to account all those responsible for the worst violations and abuses”, the UK has the assets and credibility to deliver a well-supported joint statement. We have no doubt that your partners and allies in the Council and beyond would stand ready to support such important efforts.\n\nWe also urge you, as a matter of priority, to update the FCDO’s travel advice to align with US travel advice on the situation for detained nationals in Egypt. The US government warns that “U.S. citizenship does not provide protection from detention or arrest by Egyptian authorities, and individuals detained may be subjected to prolonged interrogations and extended detention.” It also states that, “the Egyptian authorities do not automatically notify the U.S. Embassy when a dual national is detained, or provide information about their alleged crime”.\n\nIt is a matter of serious concern that British nationals do not have clear advice to rely on in this matter, which is vital for their personal security. The fact that the UK has been refused consular access to Alaa Abd el-Fattah suggests that the situation of British dual nationals is similar or even worse to that of Americans.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nRt Hon.
