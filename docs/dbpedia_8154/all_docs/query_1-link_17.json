I regret that I cannot learn, jumped into the water after him, and dived to the bottom, bringing up the lifeless body. He swam to the clubhouse with his burden, and, after a considerable time, Bonnell was resuscitated. * * * I am told that Mr. Wright can swim, but I have heard no reason for his action in sitting by while Bonnell was in danger of his life. He was the drowning man's guest, and, I be- lieve, occupied part of his room at the club- house. The affair caused considerable com- ment in Sausalito, and Mr. Wright's name is not mentioned with much respect. It is quite probable that he has an excellent explanation to give for the course he pursued, and I would like very much to hear it. There is another chapter to the story, but the details are meagre. My correspondent says Bonnell, becoming quite ill the evening after his escape, asked Wright to call assistance; Mr. Wright turned over and went to sleep again and was then ordered from the room. This is certainly all very sad, but there is something in the air of Sausalito that makes people do strange things. * * * 10 Cents : opportunity of disgracing the ermine; but I have so often called attention to the general > and particular unworth of some of them, that I despair of ever seeing a change made. The judges went to one of the hotels at the resort, took rooms, and sitting en banc with a limited number of female advisers, made Rome howl and gnash her teeth. Dr. R. Beverly Cole was one of the guests, and offered a large sum of money, cash down, for a gun with which to blow the legal heads from their resting places. * * * After driving soft-winged Morpheus from the hotel, the judiciary, accompanied by their companions, emerged from their rooms and wrung a few higher notes from their throats. The night clerk bade them be silent. \"You will arouse the neighborhood,\" he said. \" The neighborhood,\" cried Dr. Cole, who had apartments adjoining the scene of the re- suscitation of chaos, \"they'll arouse the in- habitants of Lone Mountain.\" When the proprietor of the hotel appeared, he threatened them with all kinds of punish- ments. \"That's all right,\" said the gentle judges ; \"we'll get chainsvenue, an' 'smiss the case.\" Boniface became enraged, took the men by the shoulders and threw them into the cold air, where they became sufficiently sober to lie on the ground without holding on. I do not deny the right of a judge to get as full as a boiled owl, nor would I restrict him in his dis- play of animal spirits, but because we are un- fortunate in living in a semi-civilized commu- nity, I would beg that he wear a mask, travel incog, and be a drunken ruffian under an as- sumed name. * * * It is with much regret that I have re- ceived the positive assurance of Grover Cleve- land that he would not come to the coast this summer. It had been so often asserted that the ex-President would pay us a visit that I had hopes of hearing him in San Francisco, but the following letter, written to one the directors of the Young Men's Democratic League settles the question : I am not contemplating a visit to California, though I should enjoy exceedingly such a trip. I know something of the Young Men's Democratic League, of San Francisco, and am of the opinion that I should feel quite at home with its members. I cer- tainly should be glad to be a recipient of their hospi- tality. The plan of work which the League has laid out is undoubtedly of the kind which brings about good re- sults, and if Tariff Reform is ever to fully triumph, it must be by the means which the League employs. Yours very truly, Grovkr Cleveland. * * * The foregoing communication was written in reply to an invitation to Mr. Cleveland to attend a banquet to be given in his honor by the Young Men's Democratic League. This organization is among the strongest political bodies in the State, and did good service in the last campaign. It is strongly in favor of tariff reform, and purposes fighting for Dem- ocracy on an educational platform. It strives to inculcate the principles of tariff reduction, and has made many converts to fair trade. Among its members are some of the brightest \" THE WAVE'S\" PORTRAIT ALBUM. This week I take pleasure in presenting the pictures of three of the best amateur tennis-players on the Coast. At .this time, when the tournament will at- tract so many people to San Rafael, the portraits of these gentlemen will have more than a passing interest. Will Taylor, the youngest of the trio, has held the championship for a number of years; Charley Hub- bard won the match games t the Olympic Club recently, after a hard struggle with Joe Tobin. It must be admitted that though being good racquet- wielders these young men have other claims on fame. SPLASHES. My sausalito correspondent, of whose general intelligence and perspicacity I have spoken before, sends me another story of a very interesting nature. Another man has been saved, an exhibition of what appears to be the utmost heartlessness has been given, and an unknown youth has performed a daring act, second only to that of Miss Mattie Gibbs, in rescuing from certain death Edward Horton. Al Bonnell was the victim of this second accident, and he would have lost his life had not an un-medaled boy jumped to his rescue, although I am told John Wright sat near him and watched his death struggles, without making any attempt to save him. * * * Mr. Bonnell was over at his clubhouse with some friends, among whom was Mr. Wright, and as the weather was hot suggested a swim. Nobody cared to indulge in aquatic pleasures, and Bonnell jumped in alone. After having been in the water for some time, he was seized with cramps and disappeared. I am told that Mr. Wright was sitting only a short distance from where the unfortunate man went down, but - made no effort to reach him. Bonnell came to the surface, and some people at a distance saw his struggles; before they could come to his assistance he had sunk a second and a third time. A young man, whose name Sausalito rings with the exploits of Werner Stauff. Jealous of the variegated reputation of the Coast Crichton — Joseph D. Redding — Mr. Stauff has entered the lists as competing for the honor. He already claims supremacy in all the mere manly sports, and expects soon to enter the domain of intellect, where, among chess players, billiardists, and such pursuers of athletics, the only Joseph is supposed to sit enthroned. Besides being an admirable pedestrian, having vanquished Jack Kilgariff with consummate ease, Mr. Stauff has money up that says he can run eight miles without stopping. On Saturday last he obliterated the shooting reputation of Charley Lang. He says that with two weeks' practice he can swim to Belvedere and his latest wager is that he will be the first man in Sausalito to shoot a bear. It is very evident that Mr. Stauff means business. One cannot, of course, expect to attain reputation and success at a bound. On Sun- day last Mr. Stauff's career was slightly blighted. It was in a tennis match with Mr. Kilgariff. Having demonstrated his suprem- acy in the matter of speed, Mr. Stauff con- cluded that in other phases of muscular effort Mr. Kilgariff must also be inferior. Some practice games ensued, wherein the former proved victorious, whereupon a formal challenge was presented, accepted, coin put up, and the game played last Sunday at the Sausalitan courts. The result — well, Mr. Stauff was not, even figuratively speaking, in it. His defeat was crushing and conclusive; and what magnums of iced champagne were consumed over the victory by festive friends of both. * * * I HAVE BEEN INFORMED of a singularly disagreeable ' scene at one of the resorts not a moon's distance from Santa Cruz, in which two of the city's judiciary took prominent parts. It is most unfortunate that there should be elected to the bench men who seek 2 THE WAV E . young men in town, and in future political struggles it will have an immense influence. Governor Markham, I regret to hear, does not intend visiting the Brigade Encampment at Santa Cruz. The death of his little (laugh- ter has been a severe blow to him, and he and his wife have gone to their home in Pasa- dena. Out of respect to their Chief the staff has changed its plans, and will not attend the encampment in its official capacity. All arrangements had been made, however, so the individual members with their families will go down, and, undoubtedly, will have a delightful time. Colonel Chadbourne has apportioned the work among the other Colonels, and each one will be host on a cer- tain day. * * * Colonel Chadbourne was at Sissons with Governor Markham when the news arrived of the critical condition of his little daughter. He immediately telegraphed to Sacramento, and Superintendent Jack Wright wired to Dunsmuir, ordering an engine to bring him to the State Capitol. Within an hour the Governor was on his way South, the engine flying along at an almost perilous rate of speed. He reached Sacramento at 6 a. m. only to learn that the little one had passed away at two hours earlier. The staff com- pletely filled with flowers the car \" Ventura,\" in which the Governor and his wife journeyed to Pasadena. I believe Governor Markham intends stopping some time in Southern California. Owing to the pressure of business during the recent session of the Legislature, together with the sickness in his family, his health has been much impaired, and he purposes recuperating before battling again with affairs of State. * * * Just what to ascribe the pedestrian fever at Sausalito to, I am unable to state. The latest contestants for honors in agility are Will Ashe and Jack Kilgarif, who still smarts under his recent disastrous defeat by Werner Stauff. There was some dispute the other evening be- tween the two. I believe Mr. Ashe insinu- ated that however excellent his friend might be at tennis, he was a complete failure on his feet. The result, a challenge. Mr. Ashe wagered a case of champagne that in a three- quarters-of-a-mile spin Mr. Kilgarif would not be in it. Accepted, details arranged, start made, course from wharf below Ashe's house to the border of the government reser- vation and back. * * * Just exactly how it occurred no one seems to know, but Will Ashe simply ran away from his rival. Whether the impetus of his weight carried him, for he is no sylph, or simply a natural agility that overcame the influence of adipose tissue, is not for me to decide. Mr. Kilgarif was simply \" not in it,\" and has since purveyed the wine which, I understand, is being carefully iced for Fourth of July consumption. * * * This is the season of drawn blinds and back- parlor life for those compelled to remain in town. If a single person \"in the swim \" were to give a ball or reception, their main effort would not be directed to entertaining their guests, but to imposing secrecy on them. Life in this city, when the beau monde is out of town, clearly is a confession of poverty, equivalent to admitting a small salary or a large overdraft. * * * In San Rafael this week life in the ab- stract has not been worth living. To the heat from a vicious sun old Tamalpais has added his quota. Forest fires have converted him into a species of Vesuvius, a pillar of cloud by day, flame by night. This has not effected the plans of sojourners, however. They are busy making all sorts and conditions of preparations for celebrating the Fourth, and at the cotillion the attendance will cer- tainly be extensive enough to satisfy the most aspiring of leaders. * * * Mrs. Oxnard purposes entertaining a party consisting of Miss Jolliffe and Mr. Al. Stetson Mrs. Pinckard has F. C Beazley and A. B. Williamson coming to her. At the Hotel Rafael the most recent arrivals are the mem- bers of Mrs. Chas- Holbrook's party, consist- ing of Miss Mary Holbrook, Miss Alice Hobart, Miss Nellie Hillyer and Mr. Harry Holbrook. Mrs. R. D. Girvin has almost recovered from her recent severe illness. She is conva- lescing at the residence of Colonel Eyre, at Menlo. * * * Mrs. Lyle and Mrs. Benham, of New York, the latter the sister-in-law of Mrs. Volney Spalding, arrived in the city a few days ago, and are enjoying Mrs. Spalding's hospitality at \"Heartsease,\" Belvedere. * * * Miss Henshaw, of Boston, a sister of Mrs. Hall McAllister, is on a visit from Boston and is stopping at the family residence in Ross Valley. She is a very pretty girl and will make her initial social appearance at the cotillion Saturday evening. * * * Quite a number of house parties are to be given on the Fourth. The Dimonds have asked a number of people to spend the holi- days with them at Menlo. * * * Mr. and Mrs. Louis B. Parrott entertained at dinner on Saturday last Miss Low, Miss Nevvlands, Mr. William Babcock and Mr. Hamilton. * * * On Tuesday evening last, Mr. and Mrs. Webster Jones and Mr. and Mrs. Henry E. Bothin entertained Mr. Henry Hastings, of New York, at dinner. Mr. Hastings will be remembered as a visitor here two years ago, when he attracted far more than the ordinary amount of attention accorded to visitors by the lavish manner he entertained. The series of theatre and dinner parties given him was unique. Mr. Hastings is in the shipping business, and is said to be very wealthy. * * * The dancing community is so dispersed over the country that gathering a crowd for any particular occasion is attended with consider- able difficulty. At the Hotel Rafael hop the attendance, though large, fell below anticipa- tion. In the prettily decorated ballroom there was accommodations for many more couples — an advantage, perhaps, considering the heat. Indeed, so sultry was the atmos- phere the incentive to exertion was meager. Even for the most enthusiastic devotees of Terpsichore, half a dozen turns proved ade- quate. I was surprised at the absence of familiar San Francisco faces. Mill Valley, I Larkspur, Ross Valley, and San Rafael proper were well represented, but of city damsels there were few, reserving themselves for the Flannel Cotillion to-morow night. * * * Among the married ladies present, Mrs. Webster Jones and Mrs. Mervyn Donahue, both in black, looked well. Miss Wallace, in a dainty white costume, was the prettiest girl present. Miss Struve, of Seattle, a tall, stately, striking-looking blonde, attracted a great deal of attention. Miss Huntsman and Miss Friedlander also appeared to advantage. The Macaroni band supplied harmony for the dancers, and after supper there was an im- promptu concert in which Mr. O'Sullivan, Miss Bessie Bowie and Mr. Hellman took part. The quality of harmony, though extensive and ambitious, could hardly be designated as artistic. * * * Madame and Miss Ziska have gone to Ben Lomond to spend a few weeks. Before re- turning to the city they will stay for a short time at Calistoga. * * * The Kitchen Party given by Mr. Green- way and Mr. Friendlander at the Hotel Rafael on Tuesday evening last was rather a relief to the stereotyped order of entertainments in vogue in summer resorts. A select delegation of Bohemians was invited over and at 10:30 supper time, the guests repaired to the Kitchen and there partook of terrapin, spare ribs and welsh rarebits prepared by a Daniel O'Connell, the descendant of several Irish Kings, Louis Sloss, Jr. and Rollo Peters. Mr. O'Connell is accused of adroitness in the preparation of this description of edible and the connoisseurs present said that the results of his efforts were adequate to his reputation. After all the edibles had been disposed of, which by the way took an inconceivably long time, music was indulged in. C. D. O'Sullivan led in song and found numerous assistants, so the atmosphere was per- meated with vocal harmonies which blended with the delicate aromas of the late edibles with an effect that a combination of gourmet and musical critic would pronounce charming. * * * Mr. and Mrs. J. B. Crockett, Mr. and Mrs. E- W. Hopkins, Mr. and Mrs. Fred Zeile, and Mr. and Mrs. Mountford Wilson leave this afternoon for Spoozer Creek, near Lake Tahoe, where they purpose spending the national holidays. General Russel Alger and family were entertained by Senator Felton at Menlo Park on Tuesday last. They were driven round to the various country houses, and were given an opportunity of seeing this lovely suberb at its best. * * * \"The season\" is on at Del Monte, and that charming resort presented this week the most animated appearance it has had this year. Not only has it given shelter to a large dele- gation of San Franciscans, but among the names on its register are those of people who have come from all parts of the world to en- joy the hospitality of this Queen of Watering Places. The weather has been delightful, and ,the hundreds who have been at Del Monte have spent their time in the open air. * * * The Saturday night hop, which is a feature of the life at the hotel, did not -draw many people to the Ballroom last week, as the tempting moonlight, balmy air, and delight- ful walks proved irresistible to the majority THE WAV K • of the young people. Nearly, everybody goes in swimming, and the beach presents a charm- ing appearance in the morning hours. A radical change is noticeable in the bathing costumes; last year the temerity of some of the fair nymphs, in the display of charms, was somewhat noticeable; this season the fashion has changed, and the bather's wardobe is much more extensive than was that of some of our maids and matrons at many of the social functions of the past. * * * The pleasures of the past few days have been almost all anticipatory. There is always a surfeit of fun at the Fourth of July, and a big crowd left for Del Monte yesterday and to- day to participate in the \" exercises.\" A ball will be given this evening, and in a hun- dred other ways the guests will enjoy the Nation's holiday. * * * A very jolly dance was given over at Gregg's Villa, last Saturday evening, under the direction of Vivian Waldeck. Quite a constellation of pretty girls were present, though, I believe, Miss Loryea was awarded the palm as belle. As the Misses Fleishacker, and-the Misses Steinhart, besides other hand- some damsels were present, this is saying a great deal. In spite of the intense heat danc- ing was vigorously indulged in, and everyone had an enjoyable time. * * * Napa Soda Springs is to be very gay this Fourth of July. Quite a large party of Sausalitans are going up. On the evening of the National holiday there's to be a dance, and fireworks, of course, galore. On Sunday there's to be a pigeon shoot in which Andrew Jackson, Fred Wooster, and Harry Kirkover, a young New Yorker, and a capital shot, will take part: also, I believe, a delegation of crack marksmen from Napa. Among others who will be at the Springs until Monday are Mr. and Mrs. Billy Hamilton, John Jackson and wife, Rudolph Herold, Mr. and Mrs. Fred Wooster, Werner Stauff, Ed. Danforth and wife, and many others. A delegation of prominent San Franciscans sojourns at the Klamath Hot Springs, ex- Mayor Pond among others. The other day word was passed around that Governor Mark- ham had decided to honor the establishment with his presence, and everyone gathered around to witness the meeting between victor and vanquished. Special efforts to add to their ordinary attractiveness were made by the ladies, and an ornate meal, prepared by the clever chef, graced the table. The great man came in a special conveyance, hastily alighted and marched through the assembled guests, his eyes fixed on the ground, then had dinner in his apartments, marched round the establishment with Manager Edson, and left the following morning without exchanging a word with a soul, or seeking to meet his erstwhile rival. Of course, everyone was bitterly disappointed. * * * The Roseleafs cruised around the bay Sun- day last and adventured forth nearly to the Heads. The tidings of Alec Hamilton's narrow escape from an undesirable dip, per- chance a watery grave, have not yet reached the public ear— the long one to which one naturally confides such episodes. This ways it occurred: On the \" Frolic \" the presence of Captain Zalinsky-was desired, : and passing the Presidio Mr! Hamilton volunteered to fetch the famous dynamiter from his lair. Jumping into the small boat he rowed ashore, the \" Frolic,\" meanwhile cruising around. Finally she tacked back, and going at a racing speed struck the waiting boat near the stern, twisting her around vehemently. Someone threw a rope to Hamilton which entangled his head or something. Just why he did not fall overboard, the Roseleafs even cannot de- cide, as, according to all natural laws on this subject, he should have; at all events he is still in the ring and did justice to the lunch spread in the shady cove of Angel Island where the R's picnic grounds are. This coming Fourth the brotherhood of Roseleafs spend on the Sacramento river, at a place named Antioch. Concerning the in- trinsic attractiveness of the locality, I have no means of pronouncing. There will they pass the Nation's birthday — some fifteen of them — accompanied by sundry refreshments of the order frequented by the classic band. The \"Frolic\" left yesterday under command of Commodore Peters, containing a section of the gallant contingent. The others will reach their destination by train. =fc 5jS ~¥ Fred Larkin, one of the few good-looking employees of the Southern Pacific Co., is repining a unique adventure in Sacramento last Sunday. With some friends he visited the State Capitol, and after taking in the sights, with the thermometer o/er 100 re- paired to bed. The name of the hotel is pre- served incognito. About eleven a series of startling noises in the yard awakened him. Two men were fighting feverishly. As they evinced no inclination to cease, Mr. Larkin calmly emptied over them a large bucket full of water. The effect was electrical. Silence was restored, but on descending to the office next morning an urbane clerk informed him that the downpour had escaped the combat- ants but had fallen all over a policeman who was just separating them. I believe Mr. Larkin has since concluded that as an aqueous peacemaker he is not a success. * * * One of the jolliest camping parties this sea- son was that of the Watsons, at Guerneville in the Redwoods. The camp was admirably appointed, equipped with everything for temporary convenience, and guests and mem- bers are all agreed it was a perfect success. Miss Watson knows perfectly how to do the honors, and she had a corps of pretty assist- ants skilled in the arts of making the time fly. The camp has now broken up and the party finished up their festivity with a tug ride round the bay on Saturday. * # * The Country Club shoot, last Saturday, will 'not live in the annals of the institution as a memorable event. The birds were few and hard, the heat was stifling, and the shooting sinfully bad. Thomas Ewing made the best score — 10 birds, which is a species of very bad best. The main topic of conversation just now is the Del Monte shoot — the decisive one of the year. Fred Webster's cup will be awarded to the successful marksman, and it is a trophy worth trying for. According to the score books, Bosqui is still one bird ahead of Woodward and Worden, who tie at 30. Tallant 29, and Murdock and Kittle 28, come next. One of them will surely win, as there is but one shoot between, and it can hardly affect materially any one's standing. . *■** R. B. Woodward won last year, and will make a brisk fight for the trophy, but Bosqui is in good trim and determined to win, if pos- sible. * # * I am told that the Country Club purposes purchasing shooting grounds of its own next season, somewhere in Ross Valley. There, in conjunction with the Gun Club, it will hold its monthly shoot. There is a great deal of dissatisfaction over the rather cava- lier manner in which the management of the Oakland track treats the Club. Last Saturday, for instance, the supply of birds was quite inadequate, while the California Club, the following day, had all that the members required. The grounds in view are admirably located. The erection of the necessary buildings will not involve a large expenditure, and it will be possible then to ask ladies to attend the shoots, which will certainly make them more attractive. * * * Editor Pixley's inconsistencies are so con- sistent that it is really a waste of time allud- ing to them. Anything more inexpressibly- humorous than his laudatory editorial on the Pope, it would be impossible to imagine. Here is a man who has actually made an in- come out of abusing the \"Pope's Irish,\" as he is pleased to call them, who, at the eleventh hour, turns round and discovers the ideal man, the greatest Statesman in the world, rules over the Roman Catholic Church. One cannot regret that the Argonaut has seen fit to modify its views, but it is a unique and unexplained abandonment of a position the journal has held for years, which, indeed, it has become identified with. The solitary ex- planation that the Editor's friends offer is that the Pixleycan brain is softening. It certainly seems as though some mental catastrophe had occurred. * * * Not content with her dainty little rhodo- montade on Del Monte, Mrs. Atherton last week descended on the Hotel Rafael, and lit- erally \"chewed up \" the unfortunate guests. She writes as though completely at war with the world, or under the sting of some terrific snubbing. Her literary mannerisms are those of a John L- Sullivan; her pen she wields as if it were a sledge hammer. For her victims there is no quarter. No one would venture to question the fertility of the Athertonian intelligence. The world, too, cannot but be interested in her reflections on Salvation Army lassies, and her efforts to imagine them in other capacities, but in writing about resorts, the authoress of \" Hermia Suydam\" should remember to preserve the Unities. * * * Of Philistinism, there is no more perfect proof than a tendency to be vulgarly abusive, and Mrs. Atherton in her lofty way writing about \" belly bands for babies,\" should re- member this. Like a certain poet of whom Ambrose Bierce wrote, she rarely writes a line that her worst enemy would wish erased. * * * One of The most ancient of our ancient notable citizens is old Uncle Joe Hoge, Judge of the Superior Court, Department No. 4. He has long been a monument to the healthful- ness of the glorious climate of San Francisco, and his contemporaries will probably point to him for many years to come as an evidence of what can be done with a good constitution and a temperate appetite in California. Uncle Joe has been called \"Colonel \" for ages. He was never in the army nor na\"y, nor did he ever even serve in the militia. Being an old 4 THE WAVE. time and faithful Democrat, his friends a few years ago thought a title would be a good thing, and so they called him \" Colonel.\" At least, that is the account he gives himself of the origin of his title. * * * Some days since I visited his court at the City Hall, and remained for some time contemplat- ing the old gentleman as he sat listening to two young attorneys, who were arguing a point of law before him. I observed that he ■had some difficulty in warding off a tendency to fall asleep, and occasionally when Morpheus got the better of him, he would give a violent nod and awake with a start. The point under discussion by the young attorneys was ex- ceedingly simple, and the old man had at- tempted several times to choke them off. Suddenly one of them opened a volume of \" Parsons on Contracts \" and began to read. Uncle Joe could stand it no longer. \"Young man,\" said he, sternly, \"if you have any re- gard for the safety of your client, close that book. In two minutes more I shall commit you and your client to jail for contempt ! \" \"Why, your honor \" spluttered the young attorney. \"Never mind,\" said Uncle Joe, \"I want this Court respected. I read ' Parsons on Con- tracts' before you were born, sir. I shall not permit any man to come here and assume that this Court is a rank idiot.\" * * * Of course, this was very funny, and the spectators laughed heartily, while the old gentleman, pretending to have been grossly insulted, bundled off the bench and into his chambers, where he took the nap he had been warding off so long. The incident, however, reminded me of another equally as funny. In 1879 Uncle Joe was President of the Constitutional Convention, that Temarkable body which framed the present organic law of the State. That con- vention was the most distinguished body of citizens that ever assembled in California. It was filled with Generals, Colonels — real ones who had smelled powder — ex-United States Senators, ex-Governors, and ex-Congress- men, besides many young men of ability who have since become famous in the councils of the State. * * * Uncle Joe was a model presiding officer. I have never seen a man, except Carlisle or Blaine, who discharged the functions of a presiding officer with more dignity and ability than he. On several occasions his distin- guished colleagues on the floor tried their level best to tangle him up in parliamentary law, but they were signally unsuccessful. One day a particularly abstruse point had been sprung, and for several hours Wilson, Barnes, Casserly, Hager, Edgerton, Terry, and others debated it hotly. Finally, Uncle Joe un- raveled the tangled points and rendered his decision. Of course it was not satisfactory to those who had been defeated, but the conven- tion adjourned immediately, and the members fell to debating it among themselves. As Uncle Joe descended from the rostrum of the President, Judge Hager hobbled up to him — himself a white-haired old man — and, in his querulous voice, said: \" Uncle Joe, you are all wrong in that de- cision, I \" Uncle Joe glared at him and snapped: \"Goto thunder, you old fool. I was in Congress when you were at college.\" * * * And that was literally true. The aged Judge was born in Ohio in 181 1. He is, therefore, eighty years old some time this year. He lived at Galena, Illinois, in 1842, and from there was elected to the Twenty- eighth and Twenty-ninth Congresses (1843- 47), Just think of it! That was nearly half a century ago. His colleagues in those two Congresses numbered three men who have been President of the United States, and many who have become famous in its history. John Quincy Adams, James Buchanan, and Andrew Johnson were members of the Twenty-eighth Congress, while Hamilton, Fish, Alexander H. Stephens, Stephen A. Douglas, Joshua Giddings, and John Slidell were among the smaller fry. In looking over the list, some days ago, of those celebrated intellectual giants who fought out the battles of the constitutional epoch of our history, I failed to find the name of a single man, except Uncle Joe, who is still alive! $ ♦ ♦ I noticed, with some curiosity, in poring over the ancient journals of the House of Representatives of those Congresses, that one of the greatest battles of Uncle Joe's Con- gressional experience was over the \" Wilmot Proviso.\" This was an amendment tacked to an appropriation bill in the Twenty-ninth Congress by David Wilmot, of Pennsylvania, prohibiting the introduction of slavery, or in- voluntary servitude into the new territory, then soon to be acquired from Mexico. It was, indeed, the old question of the extension of slavery. The ' ' proviso ' ' was adopted by the House in both Congresses, but was killed in the Senate. Uncle Joe voted for it both times. * * * Here is another curious circumstance. Uncle Joe has been a Democrat all his life. He is still as staunch in that faith as when a boy, but here he is on record as voting against the extension of negro slavery in 1844, when Webster, Douglas, and even Lincoln were in doubt whether that system were not actually ordained by God! If I had not shaken Uncle Joe's hand lately and did not know that he was real flesh and blood, I should incline to the belief, from his history, that he was a visitant from another world. Think of Ohio in 181 1 when he was born! A howling\" wilderness, infested with savages, where now are hundreds of teeming cities and thousands of hissing, sizzling loco- motives not then invented. * His life history literally spans the ancient and modern world. * * * I OBSERVE FROM THE NEWSPAPERS that a number of \"prominent Democrats\" have un- dertaken the task of \" reorganizing\" the local Democratic party. It is stated in one place that these gentlemen are disinterested patriots who merely seek the public weal, and in another they are referred to as persons who do not believe that the local Democracy is, as it was once described by ex-Supervisor McDon- ald, ' 'a mere merchantable commodity used to enrich two or three men.\" Among the names of those who are thus volunteering for the work, I read those of Thomas J. Shackleford, Edward McGetti- gan, Charles D. Wheat, Isador Gutte, Gavin McNab, Clitus Barbour, William Broderick, P. M. Wellin, Charlie Weller, James G. Maguire, James D. Phelan and August Marchebout. * * * Some of these gentlemen have held office under the Democratic party, others, perhaps, would like to; all of them know a little some- thing about politics, and all, perhaps, are smart and willing to learn more, but with the exception of Mr. Broderick I did not see the names of many practical politicians in the long list of \" reorganizes\" published by the Examiner the other day. Broderick is an old Tammany wire-puller, but he is naturally too much of a man to ever become a success- ful leader. The leader of any local party must be a low, disreputable, unscrupulous scoundrel — a man of brains with the tastes of a bummer. * * * That is all there is of it. You might write pages upon pages of argument and call a million witnesses to swear that this is not true, and yet you would not be able to dis- prove it. Men who assert that the boss of a political party — and no party ever succeeded without one — can triumph without being a scoundrel and a criminal, do not know what they are talking about. It may be said that the political boss is not compelled to buy votes or to commit other crimes against the elective franchise. That is true. But say that to a \" practical \" politician and what will be his reply? \" If I do not buy votes and stuff the boxes,\" he will say, \"the other side will, and we shall be defeated.\" * * * A few days ago I discussed this question with a gentleman who for two campaigns was a Republican boss in this city. Bill Higgins was the actual boss, but this gentleman con- trolled a faction in the party and brought Higgins to his terms. He was, therefore, for the moment chief manipulator. I asked him what qualifications were necessary to make a man a successful boss. \" He must be a liar, a scoundrel, and a bold and daring criminal,\" he said. \" He must not only be a drinking man, but he must be acquainted with all the drunken ruffians of the town and not be above going on a spree with them occasionally. Nothing is so calculated to make them trust him as to feel that he is as degraded as they. * * * \"When one of them gets into jail, or mur- ders, or steals he must help him out of the scrape, even if jury-fixing has to be resorted to to do it. The fact that a boss has per- formed a job of this kind causes his praises to 1 be sounded in every resort of thieves and bummers in the city. And, finally, a man must be the abject slave and tool of the gin- mill keepers of the town. There are 3500 whisky drinking places in San Francisco, and on election day they control, if unanimous, 10,000 voters. When I was in politics, I found that nothing could be done at the prim- ary elections or in the campaign afterward unless this element had been placated. The saloons run this as they do every other large city in the United States. When I discovered, as I finally did, that all bosses are subordinate to Boss Whisky, I quit politics.\" * * * I do not wish to say a word calculated to discourage the gentlemen who are engaged in reorganizing the Democratic party in this city. I hope they will succeed; the man who did not would be an ilbwisher of his species. But I may be pardoned the opinion that their attempt will be a flat failure, except on one condition. Need I indicate that condition ? Well, it is that they take Boss Buckley in and let him do the \" reorganizing.\" The \" Shorty \" Simpsons, \" Big \" Byrneses, Tom McCormicks, and other toughs and plug uglies, who break up club meetings and pack conventions vill look upon them with con- 5 tempt unless they accept \"Buck's\" leader- ship; and if they do not accept it, this element will work for Kelly and Crimmins as they did in the last campaign, and defeat the \" reor- ganized \" ticket at the polls. I wonder if the gentlemen who are \"reorganizing\" the Demo- cratic party have ever stopped to think of how they are going to carry the election after they are \" reorganized\" and have nominated a set of men to hold the offices ? * * * Suppose the goody-good y, stay-at-home voters they calculate on coming to their assist- ance do actually turn out in numbers? The Fire Department, numbering 500 men, the Police Department, numbering 600, the office- holders, Federal, State and City, numbering 1000, and the gin mills, mustering directly and indirectly 10,000 voters, will march on them in solid phalanx. It seems rather hard to ask the question, but what percentage of any one or all of the classes enumerated are in favor of decent government? * * * Business men are laughing in their sleeves over Warner Miller's appeal to California on behalf of the Nicaragua canal. Mr. Miller is a man of standing and fortune in his own State, and has been United States Senator. While he was at Washington he was smart enough to induce Congress to insert a provis- ion in the tariff, levying a prohibitive duty on wood-pulp, of which he was the chief maker in this country. He thus secured a monopoly of that valuable material for the manufacture of printing paper, and became exceedingly rich in consequence. Shortly after the expi- ration of his term as U. S. Senator he identi- fied himself with the scheme which finally crystallized as the Maritime Company of Nica- raga, and became president of the company. The success of this enterprise depended on its obtaining a subsidy from the government ; a vigorous, though unsuccessful, appeal for the subsidy was made to the Fiftieth and Fifty-first Congresses. Pending the appeal, Mr. Miller raised among his friends a sum of money, which he has stated at over four millions; with this work has been begun. * # # Mr. Miller's idea in coming here was to get another million from the people of this coast, and he exhorted them to subscribe with com- mendable energy. Unfortunately for him, Californians are perfectly familiar with the Nicaragua canal scheme. He said nothing to them which they did not know before. But strangely enough he did not tell them what kind of securities he proposed to give them in exchange for their money, and he ignored the rather serious question whether a Nicaragua canal would not take past San Francisco the Asiatic traffic which now comes here, and furnishes a good deal of business. Instead of demonstrating the fallacy of this apprehension, he concentrated his efforts on general eulogies of the canal, and on securing the support of newspapers, which are morally open to con- viction. * * * The meeting of financiers at the office of Mr. Schloss was a shallow device. Every- body sees through the subscriptions of ex-Senator Fair, and Mrs. Parrott, and Mr. Schloss, and Mr. Crocker, and the others. It has not transpired that any checks have been drawn to make good the subscriptions, and it is generally whispered that these public- spirited citizens merely put their names down pour encourager les antres. * * * Mr. Miller returned home in General Alger's car in a chastened spirit. He found Californians quite as well informed as he is on matters of finance. He realized that they un- derstand that private subscriptions can do lit- tle for the canal, and that money bestowed on him will neither return to its owners nor as- sist, to any appreciable extent, the completion of the interoceanic enterprise. * * * An original man is J. D. Peters, of Stock- ton, whose shrewd business methods and suc- cessful speculations have given him a financial prominence enjoyed by few men in the State. Mr. Peters is an argonaut, but has so many good qualities that he will be forgiven for that. He is a small, stout man, with a sharp face, a cold blue eye, and an unbounded confidence in his own efforts. I would not like to say how much he is worth; but he is President of the California Navigation and Improvement Company, is interested in docks and wharves, in Stockton's proposed theatre, and in nearly everything that is for the benefit of his home city, of which he speaks in the highest terms. Indeed, he almost convinced me that Stockton was a pleasant place in which to live, but a glance at some of the papers was a strong argument against him. * * * In the insurance world the tendency is against millionaires. Yet the average of comfortable incomes is higher than in any other profession — in proportion, of course, to the number engaged therein. It is rather better to be agent for a brace or so of good companies than to be a Supreme Court Judge, though an able lawyer's total receipts more than ten times exceed what the very brightest underwriter can attain to. No one who is not working for himself can hope ever to build up a fortune, whose substantial propor- tions command the respect of good men. The insurance agent, toil he ever so ardently, is still working for a corporation. Probably he derives for the execution of so much intelli- gent effort a comfortable salary and a quota of the profits, but not enough to make him wealthy. * S(! ♦ Had D. J. Staples, for instance, . exerted for his personal aggrandizement the energy and sagacity that have put the Fireman's Fund among the leading insurance corporations of the country, he probably would be a millionaire. He is very far from being one, however. His salary, $12,000 per annum, however large it may seem to a man making half that amount, is not an immense sum on which to sustain the dignity of the position. Perhaps the rich- est man in the business, however, is the pres- ident of the Home Mutual, General John F. Houghton. Besides owning half the stock of that company, he derives for his services as president a salary of $10,000 per annum. He is, besides, a very large landowner, not in San Francisco, but throughout the State. * * * But his fortune was not acquired in under- writing. During his term as Surveyor-Gen- eral, John F. Houghton acquired a thorough knowledge of the State, which he put to the best possible advantage in his investments. He owns a large ranch near San Bernardino, and is an extensive holder of Colusa and Fresno county property. He has a handsome residence in Oakland, but spends most of his time in San Francisco. General Houghton, if not a millionaire, is within a very few hun- dred thousands of it. George C. Boardman, by lucky investments in real estate and by an occasional indulgence in a safe speculation, has amassed a fortune of at least a quarter of a million dollars. He has real estate through- out the coast, having eschewed San Francisco investments with the exception of his hand- some residence on the corner of Sacramento and Franklin streets. Mr. Boardman is credited with receiving a salary of $10,000 per annum and five per cent of the net profits of this branch of the vEtna, an arrangement which those who know say nets him some $15,000 per annum. There is E- W. Carpenter, who as manager of the Royal and Norwich Union Insurance Companies, has a salary of $10,000 per annum. But he is inde- pendently wealthy, having been very lucky in some real estate and mining investments in Helena, Montana. He is commonly accused of being worth at least $200,000, and derives a larger income from his accumulations than he does from his business. C. F. Mullins is one of the prospective rich men, with an in- come from the Commercial Union averaging close on $20,000. He is a shrewd investor, and is on the road to the proud title of capitalist. He owns a very handsome residence, besides sundry lots. * * * Julius Jacobs, next to General Houghton, is the wealthiest man in the business. He is ambitious, energetic and sagacious, and his co-workers accuse him of having years ago passed the half-million-dollar mark. He is president of sundry investment companies, of the Vulcan Powder Works, is a director and large stockholder in the Inyo marble quarries, besides owning more or less real estate. For years the firm of Jacobs & Easton has been among the most prominent \" on the street.\" but recently Mr. Jacobs' outside interests de- manded so much of his time that he retired from active participation, though still retain- ing his interest. He is one of the few under- writers who indulge any artistic taste. Not only is he fond of pictures, but he actually buys them. In Mr. Jacobs' residence on Pine street hangs Nahl's famous painting, \" Dis- covery of Gold in California.\" Major George Easton does not claim to be as rich as his partner. His investments, however, have turned out well, and it would make little dif- ference to him if to-morrow the insurance bus- iness were to come to a full stop. Colonel C L- Taylor, as president of the Sun Insurance Company, is, by courtesy, an underwriter. He is a capitalist. His accu- mulations aggregate over a quarter of a mil- lion, it is said, and as he is good for years to come, he will doubtless end up higher still. But his fortune was made long ere the \"Sun\" came into existence. In shipping and com- missions, combined with practical investments in real estate, was his wealth acquired. Among other excellent properties, Captain Taylor owns a large ranch in Solano county. Ed. E. Potter, secretary of the \"Sun,\" is fairly indictable on a charge of prosperity. An active worker, though weak in health, besides attending to his insurance interests he administers the affairs of a large ranch up near Cloverdale. He is also a holder of a great deal of Oakland and Alameda property. Occasionally Mr. Potter buys a picture, and can afford to. * * * D. Hirschfeld, of the firm of Hirschfeld is Jacoby, representing the Prussian National, & worth something like $150,000. He, too, has nothing to be thankful to the insurance busi- ness for. This comfortable sum was made in 6 THE WAVE. the candy business, in partnership with Louis Saroni. Isidore Gutte has a fine income from his business, and has extensive interests in Central America. He is a director of the Electric Light Company, and owns gaslight, water and other safe securities, besides the \"Chispa.\" He is worth at least $150,000, and has earned the reputation of being the best smooth -water sailor in the State. W. J- Landers is in a fair way to wealth. He is an extensive landholder in Fresno, Merced, Sac. ramento and Alameda counties, and is inter- ested in the electric railways. With his uncle, John Landers, the well-known capital- ist, he is in several good-sized deals. As manager of the Sun and Guardian, he receives a salary of $10,000 per annum. Mr. Landers is a man of much ability and force of^char- acter. * * * Undoubtedly there are others of whom much might be written. W. J. Dutton, of the Fire- man's Fund, is not rich, but has some nice property, besides a large block of shares in the Inyo marble quarries. Robert Dickson has some nice city property, besides a ranch in Santa Clara county. Colin M. Boyd rumor accuses of being easily worth $100,000, while S. W. Levy, who pays large amounts in taxes, is an extensive holder of city real estate, and is really a very rich man, is a broker connected with the George Easton agency. If it were not that respect for the profession induces a desire to overrate the un- derwriting prosperity, it might be safe to con- clude that the profession does not make half a bad showing. Unfortunately, the capitalists are all thankful they took to insurance late in life. In thanking the San Francisco Poly- clinic, through the president and secretary, for the following resolutions, which put me greatly in the debt of that excellent institu- tion, I can but reiterate what I have said be- fore : That than it there is no more deserving charity in the country. Of the work it is doing among the poor and sick I cannot speak too highly; of the extraordinary efforts for its benefit that have been made by the ladies who have had the management, the warmest words of praise would lack much of justice. . I have hope of a fuller measure of success for the Polyclinic, and The Wave will still be foremost in work to that end. The patron- esses have sent me the following : At a meeting of the patronesses of the San Fran- cisco Polyclinic, held at 315 Ellis street, .San Fran- cisco, California, June 3, 1891, the following resolu- tions were unanimously adopted : Resolved, That the gratitude of the ladies be tendered Messrs. Cosgrave and Hume for their cordial further- ance of our recent entertainment, the File Champetrc, held at Sutro Heights, for the benefit of the San Francisco Polyclinic. Resolved, That the success of this excellent charity has been extensively aided by the kindness always accorded it by The Wave. Kate de Young, President. Georgie M. Davis, Secretary. * * * If I were only certain that the weather on Saturday would permit us to broil our steaks and roast our meats in the open air, I would say something that might appeal to the North Pacific Railroad. But there is nothing more uncertain than the temperature of San Francisco, and if I should ask this transporta- tion company to adopt some means of shading the passengers on the \"Ukiah'' from the blood- boiling rays of a heartless sun, Sol might not show himself, and the people might say that the demand was premature, childish, and un- warranted. Those who have traveled to and from Tiburon have spoken to me of the intoler- able discomfort of the upper deck, and have begged me to whisper into the managerial ear the suggestion that an awning would be a great improvement. But as I have always found cool comfort where they broiled, I did not be- lieve I could conscientiously ask for an awn- ing. But Sol is no respecter of persons, and the immunity I believed was mine has been withdrawn, and the awning is herewith re- quested. If it is not forthcoming, I shall invite Mr. Burgin to accompany me across the bay, and hold him on the coolest part of the deck until he is cooked so well that people who like underdone meat will not touch him; this will happen in about ten minutes. * * * One of the most elegantly and correctly appointed equipages in San Francisco is that of the proprietor ot the Grand Hotel bar. It is drawn by a dashing pair of perfectly matched bays. The coachman, colored, wears irreproachable livery, and the harness and trappings would commend themselves to a connoisseur. Another perfect turnout is the brougham of a person residing on Ellis street. This is really the swellest thing in town, and I am told its owner has sent to New York for an English coachman to drive it. If but a few of our millionaires would take example by these and model after them, the sins against the convenances of equipage would be fewer. As it is, there is hardly a carriage in town that does not betray its owner's ignorance of the veriest elementals. * * * Whoever has conceived a romantic idea of Junipero Serra, and desires to retain it, is hereby warned to abstain from visiting the statue at Monterey. It is quite the most cardinal of artistic sins, and is enclosed in a frame of thick raw yellow scantlings, strong enough to hold a bear. The Holy Father is entirely in granite, and apparently suffers from smallpox. He is represented stepping out of a boat and of the existence of one leg there is tangible evidence. The other is left to the imagination with the chances against its existence. Fancy having a $10,000 monu- ment sculptured by a San Jose tombstone artist. Under the circumstances the wonder is that Junipero Serra in granite is not more of an enormity than he is. * * * The imputation, \"Argus-eared,\" applied to the press, is, in many instances, undeserved. Here is a story in circulation several months past that has hitherto escaped type. On the veranda of the Hotel Rafael a group of ladies sat, whether employed in the manufacture of what Mrs. Atherton daintily alludes to as \" belly bands for babies,\" or not, I cannot decide. At least, they were all prominent, of exclusive tendencies, aristocratic inclinations, members by divine right of the Cotillion Club. The presumption is they were discus- sing the characteristics of their immediate friends who were not within hearing. How- ever, up the avenue, toward them, came a pleasant-faced, elderly woman, not brilliantly costumed — her dress, perhaps, a little shabby. Lorgnettes were raised, and sundry cool, lan- guid stares were directed towards her. * * * Apparently not disconcerted, the newcomer proceeded calmly along until right in front of the group. In its midst was a face she knew — that of a local Grande Dame, famed for for- tune rather than for antecedents or good man- ners. She stopped and said : \" Why, Mary, don't you remember me ?\" \"You are under a misapprehension, I think,\" replied the Grande Dame, in freezing tones. \" You must mistake me for some one else.\" \" Mistake my old school friend?\" said the shabby newcomer approaching nearer, \"Mary, how could one forget your face?\" \" Really, madame, you are in error,\" con- tinued the other, with aggravating coldness. By this time the attention and lorgnettes of the group were concentrated on them. \" Indeed, I am not. You must remember me. You are Mary , you came here from twelve years ago with your husband. There you went to school. Your father was in business,\" the newcomer continued, becoming disconcerted but still emphatic. Her recog- nition was evidently perfect. The Grande Dame, after a long, languid stare at her old friend, replied not a word, but, turning to the social light sitting beside her, observed, in tired, high-bred tones : \" These long memories are sometimes very inconvenient.\" The crushed newcomer passed slowly on- ward. * * * Mathew Gage is another man who has be- come rich by devotion to one idea. He has not been a great time in the State, but, in the few years of his residence here, has done more to develop California than almost any other one man in it. He is from the north of Ireland, if I am not in error, with all the Hibernian dash, and much of the Scotch per- severance. When he arrived in California he chose Riverside as the scene of operations, secured the water rights in that charming place, and began the construction of the Gage canal. The people viewed with concern the efforts of this stranger to bring water to a region that was almost a desert without it, and began proceedings to stop him. A big legal fight was the result, and the best talent in the State was employed to combat the title. The contest was a memorable one. * * * Gage employed Hall McAllister to assist him in the fight for his rights, and the at- torney went to the home of the litigant to study the case. There he spent a consider- able time, and a friendship grew between the men that only ceased when the lawyer died, before the case was decided. But Gage beat his opponents on every point; his title was declared valid, and he prosecuted his work to the end. Then he began a colonization scheme that has been more beneficial to Cal- ifornia than any other. He brought to the State a number of English families, well-to-do, sober, and industrious, and their ranches and vineyards have made the country around Riverside a great garden of plenty. A rather humorous feature of the law suit was a ban- quet given by Gage's opponents, after the case was decided against them, to the success- ful litigant, just before the arrival of the first crowd of colonists. Gage is a very wealthy man, and being still quite young, will be a power in the State. * * * James Brett Stokes has gone in enthusiasti- cally for physical culture. He delights in doing desperately athletic things, and is perpetually in training for anything, from a pedestrian tour to a swimming match. His last great feat was to ascend Mt. Tanialpais. Starting from the Hotel Rafael early last Sunday morning he reached the summit in a little less than two hours — an achievement of the first mag- nitude, considering the sweltering heat. He got home by 1:30 P.M. The exertion com- bined with the Turkish bath atmosphere of Marin county combined to reduce his weight THE WAV K . 7 ten pounds. Mr. Stokes exhibits a rare versa- tility. Having attained prominence in So- ciety he has now ambition to be noticeable as an athlete. His next trip will be to Mt. Shasta, though he intends waiting a change in the weather. Mt. Tamalpais is ablaze. * * * Arthur H. Barendt, who for a number of years has been special writer on the Chronicle staff, will leave in a few days for England on an extended leave of absence. Mr. Barendt is one of the best \"all round \" newspaper men in the city, and I suppose makes more money than nine-tenths of the working journalists of San Francisco. He was dramatic critic of my Republican contemporary for some time, and at present holds the position of railroad editor. He returns in October. On the tenth of this month W- E. Zander will assume the management of the Hotel Del Coronado. The proprietors of this famous resort, and the guests who gather there from all quarters of the world, are to be congratu- lated on the good fortune that places Mr. Zan- der in charge, as he is credited with being one of the most efficient and popular hotel men in the country -He fitted up and opened the Hotel Rafael, which is certainly a monument to his taste and judgment. If I am not in error he also prepared the popular Smith's Creek Hotel for occupancy. Mr. Zander was very popular at San Rafael, and the regret ex- pressed by the guests at his departure was sincere. I understand he is in the East now on behalf of the Del Coronado, but will re- turn in time to take charge on the date I have given. *fc ^ *fc Belvedere is the most charming resort in the State, and already San Francisco's best people have ' built beautiful country houses there. When the city was prostrated by the heat during the past week, the peninsula was fanned by cooling breezes; no hot winds annoyed the denizens; the temperature was just pleasantly warm, and boating, riding, and fishing were the occupations of the days and evenings. The beautiful vistas, the cool, country drives, its proximity to the city and its thousand and one advantages make Belvedere an ideal summer resort. A large number of prominent San Franciscans are there for the season, and are enjoying the pleasures of a trip to the seaside with all the comforts of home. * * * To one who had visited Belvedere at this time last year, the present appearance of the beautiful peninsula would be a great surprise. Handsome residences, triumphs of architectural art and artistic taste, crown every point; pretty boat-houses, gay with flags and musi- cal with pianos and mandolins; shady drive- ways, as smooth as any roads in the State; an excellent hotel, sheltering many of the promi- nent people of the State: These have all changed the Belvedere of last year, and made it the most popular Society haunt of the State. ♦ ♦ ♦ There are at present many vacant residences in San Francisco, whose windows are adorned with the plain white and black card \" To Let.\" The chief reason for this is hardly to be found in the fact that many people are going to the country. Indeed, the houses that are for rent are not of the kind inhabited by those who can afford to spend the summer at the fashionable resorts, but are rather the dwellings favored by the clerk, bookkeeper, and man with small family and meagre salary. People are moving from the centrally located ■ night.

For the time being, bowling, billiards, tenuis and music have been abandoned, and the whirr of wheels, breaking of bones, and laughter of the skaters fill the air. The tennis courts have been turned into skating rinks, and are crowded with contestants who find much en- joyment in the new amusement. I am told that a number of champions have been im- ported, and that some excellent races are seen. One night, a short time ago, a match was arranged between two young men, one the champion of America at his weight, 1143^ pounds; and the other champion at any weight. A purse of seven dollars was gotten up, Frank Johnson was made pool-seller, a starter was appointed, and the word \"go\" was given. * * * As the contestants \"dashed\" over the as- phalt the crowd became terribly excited, and a number of men bet with themselves on the result, and won easily.

No prizes are given the artists, but a large precentage of the canvases shown have been sold at good figures, and the painters are given a wide fame that is service- able in many ways. Among those who will send examples to Minneapolis are Keith, Joullin, Yelland, Lash, Narjot, Miss Chitlen and Mrs. Williams. * * * The exhibition at Morris & Kennedy's has attracted considerable attention during the past week. There are many notable works shown, and those who can afford the time should not fail to see them. S. & G. Gump show a number of excellent works of foreign and American painters, and Sanborn & Vail have many etchings and engravings in their gallery. * * * I was surprised to hear that J. C. Franks had been made Marshal of the Court of Ap- peals, but not disagreeably so. When Mr. Franks was United States Marshal he made many friends, and was a favorite with the newspaper men who haunted his office. Al- though they bored the life out of him, he was clever enough to accept that as a part of the punishment that came to him in his business, and treated them with great consideration. They will be glad to see that he has a posi- tion in which each can be serviceable to the other. I suppose Marshal Franks got the appointment through the influence of Justice Field. During the time that got its excite- ment from the incidents in the Terry affair, Justice Field showed his confidence in the Marshal, and it was not misplaced. When an opportunity came to be of service, Field did not hesitate to use his influence. * * * Besides being a worthy citizen, a com- plaisant parent and part proprietor of the Call-Bulleti7i, Loring Pickering is a philanthro- pist. Deeply interested in the laboring classes, he is insistent in support of the cause that lacks assistance. He is an upholder of the employee's side of strikes and has little use in his spicy journal for interviews with capitalists. I am grieved that this tale, so exquisite in its morals, has not before emerged into type, but, like other winsome stories, I presume it has lost nothing in repeated tellings. Struck by a desire to put his feet under the same table as the man he had so earnestly supported, Mr. Pickering decided to attend the Harrison banquet at the Palace Hotel. On his way down town, via the California street line, he found a car uncomfortably crowded with citizens in various stages of prominence. * * * Cooly collecting a dime from the interstices of his pocket with slender, taper fingers, he handed it to the conductor who returned him the habitual nickel. Then, proceeding round the car, the bell puncher completed his task and once again stood beside the aged capitalist. \" Why don't you give me my change ? \" he asked in those deep sepulchral tones of his. \" I gave you a dime, you have neglected to return me my money.\" Passion and sorrow toned his voice to depths of harshness, unsus- pected even in the Call office. \" But Mr. Pickering,\" said a gentleman sitting beside him, \" I distinctly saw the con- ductor return you a nickel.\" \"And so did I,\" from half a dozen others. The dignified old gentleman turned his dead fish eyes in a cold stare on the crowd, and continued : \" Sir, you are trying to cheat me. If you don't return me my nickel I'll get out at once and report vou. Yes, sir, stop this car.\" * * * The genial, generous old fellow was really becoming serious. All around the passengers seemed surprised. Finally the conductor said : \" You are a rich man and I'm poor, but if you insist, rather than be laid off a whole day and lose several dollars, I'll give you a nickel.\" Thereupon he tendered him the coin which the lover of laborers genially stuck in his pocket and subsided into silence. But the possible loss of the coin so upset him that he alighted from the car and returned home. Who after reading this little idyll will not agree that Coring Pickering is the jolliest and most intensely generous of men. * * * The San Josean celebrates its first anniver- sary, and says some pretty things of itself, which are quite true. I regret that I did not have the opportunity of saying them first. San Jose is, I hope, proud of its weekly. While speaking of the Garden City press, I cannot refrain from expressing my surprise, at the cat-like tenacity of life shown by Bettet Times. If that paper bad been good for any- thing it would have been dead long ago. Probably the frequent absences of J. J. Owen have had much to do with its continued dying. Opaline will remove wrinkles and blackheads, and will restore a complexion impaired by the constant use of injurious substances. There is nothing like it.

Entries to the Fourth Annual Lawn Tennis Cham- pionship Singles of the Pacific States closed on Tues- day last with twenty-two players entered. The clubs that are represented this year are the Lakeside, East Oakland, and Madison Clubs, of Oakland; Oakland High School, the Pastime Club, of Reno, Nev. ; Ala- meda Club, of Alameda; and the Olympic Club An- nex and California Tenuis Club, of San Francisco. With Yates out, the California Club does not seem to have such a \" cinch \" on first place as in former years, although Tobin, Gray and Tom Magee are cap- able of making things warm for Hubbard, who is considered a favorite. The Lakeside Club representatives, Haight and Hubbard, are in excellent form for the contests, and the former is considered by a great many as a most likely winner. John Phillips, of the Pastime Club, of Reno, is an unknown quantity, and may surprise the local cracks. Tom Magee has improved his play considerably, and plays a much harder and more accurate game than last year. Young Bates, of the East Oakland Club, has been practicing hard for this event, and should give an excellent account of him- self. Mr. Lindsay, the Secretary of the Southern Califor- nia Tennis Association, will be an interested spectator of to-day's games, and will, no doubt, have something to say on the chances of the Southern players with the local experts. Yates, the winner of the all-comers last year, will not be able to play this year, a fact much regretted by his many friends who had predicted another vic- tory for him. W. H. Taylor, the champion, has been practicing at San Rafael for a week past, and will, no doubt, defend his title successfully again this year. The final match of the all-comers will be decided this forenoon, and the winner will be called upon to play Mr. Taylor for the championship this afternoon. On the 8th fast Alec Wilberforce, who is at present in England, will endeavor to wrest the English cham- pionship from Hamilton, providing, of course, that he reaches the final round, which is not considered very likely. Robert Harrison may arrive in time to witness the finals at San Rafael. The fact that Tom Magee has been coached by F. H. Hovey, while in the East, has set many players thinking that he may win the year, which is possible, as he defeated Hub- bard last year, and played Yates in the final round. Will Taylor and Joe Daily have been practicing to- gether for the past few days, and the champion's form has been improved very much by the games with the professional. Mr. Daily is the best player on the Coast, and Mr. Taylor is the only man who has ever de- feated him, having won one match game from him. The Scorer. CLABROUGH, GOLCHER&CO.

CALIFORNIA 9 LIBRARY NOTES. \"ON newfound river.\" About \"On Newfound River\" there is a cer- tain tranquil charm, a calm evenness of motive and manner, a certain refinement of tone and color. Slight though the plot is, and superficial the character presentations, this delicacy of treatment produces a literary qual- ity that is distinct from mere style. Even the most supercilious would not deny the excel- lence of this light free-handed sketch of life in Virginia before the war. About the picture of Landon Hall in its wide tract of bottom land, governed by the imperious old Colonel, there is much that is admirable. Without any needless description or reiterated word-painting, one is given the spirit and atmosphere of the region, one can almost hear the group at Jones' Crossing discussing the character of young Bruce Landon, or comment- ing serenely on the queerness of the recluse, old Dr. Browne, who lives with his daughter across the river. The same serene charm pervades the court- ship episode. One realizes the loveliness of Margaret, as Bruce Landon did, \"overcome with the sudden sense of her beauty; her pliant figure, her white throat, the curves of her cheeks and chin, the delicate, rich mouth, the white teeth, the changing color, the large, lustrous, sweet eyes;\" and the scene between her and the Colonel, where she so proudly tells her lover's father she has no idea of marrying his son. In the wilderness of wild literary nonsense that burdens a reviewer's table, \"On Newfound River\" is an oasis — \"breathing of Flora and the country green,\" and one is the better for reading it. [Chas. Scribner's Sons publishers. For sale by Wm. Doxey.] \" TOURMALIN S TIME CHEQUES. Morals amuse one according to one's mood. I can imagine being in a condition so exuber- ant that \" Tourmalin's Time Cheques \" would seem the climax of the ludicrous. Under ordinary circumstances, however, it is a book comparatively well-written, indistinctly humor- ous, but positively inferior to \" Vice Versa \" or even \" A Tinted Venus.\" Founded on rather a funny idea — depositing the hours gained on a voyage from Sydney to Southhampton to one's credit in the \"Australian Joint Stock Time Bank, limited,\" drawing cheques on them afterward, which any clock honors. Some amusing complica- tions are secured. Mr. Tourmalin becomes involved in serious flirtations with sundry maidens, all on the strength and in the moments of his time balance. Just when the reader begins drawing long breaths, wonder- ing how Mr. Austry purposes extricating his hero from the series of serious predicaments he is in, the book winds up with the announce- ment— t'was all a dream. [Publishers, Chas. Sergei & Co. For sale by A. M. Robertson, 126 Post street.] \"HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS. The salient characteristic of Mr. Hasting's novel, \"His Royal Highness\" is serene vulgarity. The difference between this type and the virulent quality that leaps from the pages of such books as \" Mr. Barnes of New York \" is not cultivation. It must be ascribed merely to a lesser endowment of vitality. Give this author more nerve force, and Archie Gunter, who now wears the crown of mediocrity, would have to abdicate. If he would but die.

SNELtb, manager-. will undoubtedly attract a degree of attention 1 that it does not deserve. Its cover, chromoed with a presentation of some supreme ass in evening dress, can hardly fail to catch the eye, and after careful perusal I am convinced that this is the solitary reason for reading the book. I imagine the manuscript must have been purchased by weight as the style is as labored as a Pixley editiorial. [Edward Brandus & Co., publishers. For sale by A. M. Robertson, 126 Post street.] \" SANS FAMILLE.\" Simple stories in English vary only in de- grees of boresome prolixity. English story- telling is either intense or labored. With the French it is otherwise. Perhaps a purely simple tale is a finer result in French than the more tragic and complex efforts. The sim- plicity of style cultivated by all the better French novelists is brought to a point of per- fection, in keeping with the slighter subjects, but of a somewhat affected tone when carry- ing a complex and involved situation. It is hardly fair to say that the manner is every- thing, the matter nothing, but the immense labor involved in the cultivation of this fine polish has the effect of attenuating the motives and inducing artificiality. \" Sans Famille \" is a charming story, robust, yet rendered with a delicate flexibility as natural as the incidents are unstrained and freely imagined. This work of Hector Malot deserved its place with such a gem as La Mere an Diable. [For sale at Wm. Doxey's.] \"CONTES CHOISIS.\" Guy de Maupassant's stories have become so widely known through the Henry James translations in the Odd Number that the originals come a trifle late. The magnificent force and art of these tales make them mem- orable even in a literature where a tour de force in short stories is commonplace. Unc Vandetta and Apparition are not as well-known, and are equal to the standard of those already familiar. Three novelettes, Deux Artistes en Voyage, Le Chant de Blondcl and Les Deux Zephyrs, by Comte Alfred de Vervins are graceful and pointedly done without leaving a striking impression. [For sale by Wm.

If the Harrison administration can derive any campaign thunder from the Bering Sea fiasco, the public will be pleased to note it. Up to the present, the action of the \" Greatest Living Statesman,\" backed and supported by the man who believes in \" upholding our National dignity,\" has been the reverse of everything promised the people. Our actual foreign policy has daily given the falsehood to our pretensions. The campaign strut and braggadocio furnished our own citizens has yielded to the utmost complacency in dealing with foreign powers. The closed sea absurdity, on which Blaine exhausted his powers of rhetoric, pledging his country's honor and his own reputation to maintain it, is abandoned. * * * Lord Salisbury has quietly brushed the hum- bug aside, and our Government changes its position, acquiescing in the new order with the utmost docility. Oar citizens were to be protected in their contract for killing seals, the foreigners in their interest to be driven from the sea. But our people, instead, are forbidden to kill seals themselves, although purchasing the privilege at an enormous price. They are now placed on the same level as the seal pirates who stole what our own citizens bought. The Government has shown itself a big swashbuckler, ready to act the fool or coward with equal facility, and the obsequious ad- ministration organs, whose proprietors have been appointed to fat offices, will require much cunning to extract comfort from the situation. The San Francisco capitalists, who advanced money on National assurances to conduct the Bering Sea trade, will not be likely to shout with much vigor of lung the praises of Re- publican foreign policy. The question now is, on what will the bluster be raised for the next campaign ? How can the Grand Old Party of moral ideas excite the bitter prejudices A BAD PRACTICE. The practice of the police of appearing in disguise at midnight at the houses of respect- able citizens, calling them up, and attempting their assassination should be discouraged. Of course, The Wave recognizes the advan- tages of the police department in all contro- versies. Not being responsible to the people for its acts, being an independent perpetuity, it may deny the public the right of criticism, but it must remember that there is such a thing as carrying offensiveness too far. A patient and usually forbearing public, goaded to desperation, will sometimes find means of overcoming the law's defects, and correcting abuses. Now, although not wishing to offend any- thing so powerful as the Police Commission, I would suggest that rousing an inoffensive and law-abiding citizen from his bed in his own home in the middle of the night, and shoot- ing him in the back, is, to say the least, rather indelicate; and when his wife is brutally handled, and his son felled insensible with the butt of a pistol, and the whole party, including the wounded man, are after- ward dragged to prison, the unrefined and inconsiderate character of the proceeding, I think, might even touch the mind of a Police Commissioner. If the police force of this city is an organization of ruffians against whom our citizens must constantly be on guard, j let it be so understood, and the people will shortly find means of disposing of them, com- mission and all. >♦-' The protection-to- American-labor fraud goes bravely on. The Call declares editorially that those who hope to benefit by the Mc- Kinley tin-plate tax are now in England and Wales preparing to import the necessary labor; and next campaign the Call will shout vociferously that the home of the American workingman must be protected against pauper workmen of Europe. It is these same Republican manufacturers and mine- owners who have protected the American laborer by driving him out of the coke regions of Pennsylvania, and filling his place with the vilest sweepings of the worst regions of Europe. * * * The warm weather was a blessing to the humorists. It afforded them an opportunity of working off the same old jokes about the iceman and the crack in the sidewalk. * * * When the Fourth of July orator spreads his voice on the breeze, and tells how peace and happiness and tranquility were born when Republican institutions began, let him not omit to account for the gentle felicitations in Hayti, where the presidential dignity is not considered vindicated unless a hundred unof- fending men, women and children are butchered daily. And Balmaceda should not be forgotten ; the atrocities with which he is charged make the differences between the Czar and the Nihilists tame readiug. * * * Has anybody heard of Wales lately, the man whose baccarat record occupied the at- tention of the entire American press once upon a time ? I understood from the editorial chorus of hysterical old women that the , naughty Prince should never be King with their permission ; and that they would cut his acquaintance next time they met. From the journalistic ill favor into which royalty has fallen, of course the American minister will not be allowed to present any more people at court. * * * In the matter of the denial of the applica- tion of Jing Jim Hiug, the Chinese, for ad- mission to the City and County Hospital, I desire to say that the physicians on the Board of Health have my unqualified con- tempt. A Chinese tax-payer has, of course, no rights that a Board of Health should respect, but if the action of that body in re- fusing this man harbor in his sickness does not cost the City and County of San Francisco a round sum I'll stab myself to death with my own pen. * * * The attention of the Report is respectfully called to the fact that while gambling is practiced in Chinatown, nearly every cigar store on Kearny street has its poker room; and that where there is one disorderly house in the Mongolian quarter, two places of evil repute thrive in the business quarters of the city. Does the Report know that the principal thoroughfare to St. Mary's Church is worse than any alley its editor can name in China- town ? * * * Madame Blavatsky alleged that she was of the blood royal. Of course, that was be- fore the baccarat scandal. * * * The crop of bathing-suit jokes is ripening fast, and a hungry people is waiting. HAPPY IDEAS. \" This is a charming place,\" said the new boarder, mopping his brow vigorously. \" It is, but it's just a trifle hot.\" \" Yes, that's it; one meets so many warm friends here.\" \" This is the beginning and end of life,\" said the chicken, gazing gloomily at a small hatchet. \" What,\" cried the orator, in a paroxysm of lan- guage, \" what is the burning question of the day ? \" \"What's the time ?\" yelled a boy in the gallery, and the speaker took another drink of water. The man who asks, \" Is it hot enough for you ? \" should remember that there is a place that is still \"hotter.\" Young Crcesus. — May I marry your daughter, sir?

OPEN AIR MUSIC. ■ — \"CWl^p It is not given to jevery one to hear music under the bare canopy of heaven, so fretted, flamboyant and feathery as imagined by Disraeli, him of that \"gin inspired dream of a sensuous butler, \" Lothair. This prevaricating music is only hatched under the pen of the blazing falsifier, andjheard by the ears of the critic inane. The sublime and exquisite of open air music is partially extinct. The inspired fury of a French mob, whose hoarse, febrile voices hurl the \"Marseillaise\" upon the world, or the deep invincible ardor of German crowds rending the air with their \" Wacht am Rhine,\" are fervid terrors of a by-gone war time. No picturesque pomp celebrates events with the aid of splendid festal music nowadays. Great events |£are unknown in these times of peace and shop-keeping pros- perity. Public music has fallen upon evil, barren times. Perhaps if the newspapers take it up, and expend a trifle of that energy which goes to dishing up pages of prize fight and baccarat scandals, something imposing and worthy in the way of musical celebrations will attend these happenings. Many smaller and less rich cities than San Francisco are endowed with a better and more generous supply of street music. There seems to be an almost total suppression of those human fiascos, the Italian organ grinders, with their wise-like monkeys. Street players and singers are apparently sufficiently rare to give them the distinction of curiosities. The attitude of the public is somewhat that of the philosopher who replied to the barber's query as to how he preferred to be shaven with the laconic \"In silence.\" Generally speaking, the public, as a public, has a strong regard for silent music, judging from the rapid gait it takes past the venders of stale confections in sound. The people, evidently, have as much care for their ears, in avoiding bad sounds, as they have for their skins and limbs, in eschewing the useful dangers of the omnipresent cable cars. It's a cautious, careful, practical public, that of San Francisco, and blames only the un- successful in money-getting. As a \"busi- ness,\" music is bad, and the most successful musicians, even, are regarded as pawns, while the itinerants come under the wide margin of impossibles. Still, the large toleration which is inherent in the American public, permits the bending of noises, and the gathering in of unwary nickels and dimes, and the noises continue with a cold, calm, unruffled deviltry, quite as stoically borne. The bands, consisting of a harp, a violin, and a fearsome flute, so common elsewhere, do not maraud our streets dripping \"Ah che la Morte\" and \" Di Provinza il Mar\" with the paraphernalia of Italian opera offscourings, but the organs cracked and wheezing, and the strident street piano, with the octaves mostly ninths, and a general innocence of halftones, carry on a guerrilla warfare against peace. At night the amateurs wake up and indulge in sound, and a little, a very little music. Walking down the streets one hears the melancholy quack of the clarinet, the spank- ing snap of the cornet, and emasculate toot- ings of racking scales from a distraught flute. Pianos tinkle and twang with infinitesimal degrees of vigor and fury, and the vocalists emit every variety of smothered tone. Still, the itinerant music heard upon the streets is really limited, and most of it is either percus- sion or string. A street vocalist appeared THE GEYSERS l.iKliled Willi Electricity Ice Manufactured With Natural Power Round Trip Ticket AND .'. One Week's Board Only $23.50 TH-: CEYSERS, Sonoma Co., Cal. here with a real voice some years ago, and his success was pronounced. He declared he made more money than the variety theatres gave him. With the exception of a woman, who earned quite a reputation during last summer upon Van Ness avenue, there has been scarcely any street singing. The Salvation Army, its band and chorus, is familiar enough, and deserves a niche to itself. It is often hard to know which blasphemes most, the words, the tunes, or the performers. Sensitive souls mighty easily be eternally lost if listening to this noisesome music were an enforced penalty. The brass instruments are tortures which might be used to advantage as implements of death upon the brazen players. There should be a musical house of correction for the band and chorus, which might chasten both of their luxuriant musical vices. A player on a wooden dulcimer is, perhaps, the greatest of the curiosities of local music. This talented performer invariably takes a stand upon a corner where the noise of the traffic is loudest, so that virtually the sounds are lost, and it becomes silent, most agreeably silent music. The more incessant the traffic, the more energetic the playing, the more furious the tattoo with the hammers. If there happens to be a lull, an organized thumping and clacking devoid of tune emerges, which the passing cars swish out however, before one can recognize what it means. The player never ceases; the rattle only varies in intensity; it appears to be a tragic contest against time. .Sometimes on Geary and Stock- ton streets appears a virtuoso upon a hand organ, which shrills forth every manner of mode, Dorian, Lydian, Phrygian, and Hypo Phrygian. To hear \"Annie Rooney \" and \" Boulanger's March,\" with enharmonic pentatonic scales and variations, is as weird as going through Alice's \" Looking Glass.\" There is a violinist, too, who might instruct Messrs. Beel, Landsberger, and the rest of our virtuosi, in poetic close shakes and the delights of a beauteous technique. They will find him discoursing on Kearny and Post streets nightly.

With a number of other lovers of the drama, I witnessed Mr. Lewis Morrison's 2503d performance oi' Mephisto in Bayle Ber- nard's dramatization ot\" \" Faust,\" the other night. The California Theatre, notwithstand- ing the mercury's grand exhibition of ground and lofty tumbling, was well-filled, and the efforts of the mummers were rewarded from time to time with bursts of laughter and ripples ot applause. With Mr. Morrison's conception of Mephisto I am not in accord. Without denying that this entertainer is a clever portrayer of char- acter, I must demur from the methods he em- ploys in making us acquainted before our time with the person and characteristics of his Satanic Majesty. He is an exceedingly com- mon Devil, as Mr. Morrison presents him; a low, chuckling, sneering, shoulder-shrugging, ha-haing,I've-got-you-now Devil, a bung- ling, coarse, gallery-pleasing, obvious fiend, who hasn't enough diplomacy to lay a total wreck by the heels. Positively, I was terribly disappointed in his Devilship. One would naturally expect the Devil to be a polished, finger-kissing, genial, handsome fellow; a happy-go-lucky chap, with a here-goes-my-last- dollar and the-Devil-find-me-the-next-one air.
