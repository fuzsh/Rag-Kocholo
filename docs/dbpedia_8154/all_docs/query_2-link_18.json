        "text": "#newsalert CLIMATE CHANGE, UPSTREAM PETROLEUM RESOURCES BILLS: NCOP COMMITTEE CALLS FOR SUBMISSIONS The NCOP Committee on Land Reform, the Environment, Mineral Resources & Energy has issued separate notices calling for written submissions by 30 January 2024 on ‚ÄòB‚Äô versions of the Climate Change Bill and Upstream Petroleum Resources Development Bill. Passed by the National Assembly on 24 October 2023 and requiring NCOP concurrence, each Bill is likely to be the focus of more public hearings when Parliament reconvenes after its traditionally long festive season recess. Tabled in February 2022, the Climate Change Bill‚Äôs overarching objective is to create a framework for: * the development and implementation of ‚Äòan effective national climate change response‚Äô in the context of South Africa‚Äôs international obligations, and * facilitating the introduction of mitigation and adaptation measures intended to ensure the ‚Äòjust transition to a climate-resilient and lower-carbon economy and society‚Äô. Tabled in July 2021, the purpose of the Upstream Petroleum Resources Development Bill is to: * create an independent piece of legislation for the sector * provide for ‚Äòmuch-needed legislative and regulatory certainty‚Äô, and * facilitate the sector‚Äôs ‚Äòeconomic transformation‚Äô, among other things by ‚Äòenhancing‚Äô state participation. While being processed by the National Assembly, each Bill has already been subjected to nationwide public hearings. As section 76 pieces of legislation with implications for the provinces, they are likely to be the focus of more hearings under the auspices of each provincial legislature.

As wars rage and global tensions escalate, it's reassuring to have a safe haven for dialogue. This was an excellent conference hosted by the Swiss Government, the International Cooperation Forum, where I moderated a panel on 'commodities and peace'. There is a clear risk that changing patterns of natural resource use will aggravate conflict in the years ahead. Growing demand for 'critical minerals' due to the energy transition look set to heighten geopolitical tensions between the West and China. There are already endless local conflicts and divisions around specific natural resource assets. Meanwhile, the impending decline of the global fossil fuel economy could further destabilise the Middle East and other major hydrocarbon exporting regions. How to head off these risks? Can natural resources provide a basis for peace-building not just division and war? How to use them to unlock long-term sustainable development rather than corruption and elite enrichment? How can major producers, traders and consumers of natural resources tackle human rights and other abuses along their value chains? An excellent set of speakers and panellists for the session made this a rich discussion. Thanks to Ivo Germann, Cielo Magno, James Nicholson, Mark Robinson and Marc Ummel for their insightful contributions. Kaouthar Najim Lorenz Jakob A full video of the session is here: https://lnkd.in/eyPbH3EA\n\nWhat a surprise. Geopolitics complicating the move to Clean Energy? One could argue that Geopolitics are equally preventing Distributive Justice to be meted out, including an equal distribution of benefits and ills. It has taken 27 COP meetings to finally recognize and agree to compensation to recognize the externalities imposed by unbridled Northern developed nation emissions on the developing South. We still have to see what the Loss and Damage Fund will actually look like at COP 28. This investigative article on Indonesian Nickel suggests we are tragically increasing the imbalances, not remediating them. #unsustainabledevelopmentgoals #unsustainableleadership https://lnkd.in/g5EYPPdy\n\nNo one is ever sure what to do when China floods their market with heaps of state-subsidized products. First it was steel, then solar panels like the ones cited here, and now of course it's EVs. It's quite amazing the heaps of money China throws at these developing industries, which is quite inefficient but ultimately produces results. Even with more efficient subsidies, the West will have a hard time matching China simply due to the sheer size of Chinese state subsidies\n\nToday marks the third anniversary of the unjust imprisonment of Mr. Dang Dinh Bach, a climate leader and environmental justice lawyer in Vietnam. He is one of six prominent climate leaders, experts, and advocates who have been unfairly arrested for their work on environmental and energy issues in the country. ‚û°Ô∏è Vietnam heavily depends on coal and is one of Southeast Asia‚Äôs fastest-growing economies. As a result, it is one of the fastest-growing greenhouse gas emitters globally. At the same time, the country faces significant threats from the climate crisis, being among the five most vulnerable countries in the world to the impacts of climate change. Therefore, a transition to a sustainable energy system is crucial. ‚û°Ô∏è In 2022, the International Partners Group, including the European Union, the United Kingdom, the United States, and others, concluded a Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP) with Vietnam. The JETP is a financing mechanism aimed at accelerating a just energy transition in developing countries. Through this partnership, Vietnam receives financial support to shift away from its reliance on coal towards renewable energy sources. ‚û°Ô∏è However, no money should be channeled while these important climate experts are still in prison. The unjust imprisonment of climate activists like Bach calls into question the legitimacy of the JETP, as it highlights the difficulties faced by the civilian population in participating in the development of a just energy transition in Vietnam. The participation of civil society is essential for a just and effective energy transition. ‚ùóIn light of these circumstances, we demand the Vietnamese government to release Mr. Bach and all other climate and environmental defenders. ‚ùóWe call on European governments to urge Vietnam to release the unjustly arrested climate defenders and to enable meaningful participation of civil society and especially vulnerable groups in this process! ___ Find out more about the missing \"just\" in the \"just energy transition partnerships\" in the new report released by the #Vietnam #ClimateDefendersCoalition: https://lnkd.in/eeUvEtcN #JETP #FreeClimateLeaders #StandwithBach #FreeHong #FreeThemAll #StandUp4HumanRights #HumanRights #ClimateAction #JustTransition #CleanEnergy #Climate #EnvironmentalDefenders #DefendtheDefenders"
