Either you believe in democracy or you do not.\n\n\"I believe in democracy and I believe that we should proceed rapidly with this Bill without amendments.\"\n\nJeremy Corbyn came under fire this morning after a Labour lashed out at the party leader for failing to lead the fight against Brexit - blaming the party's \"debilitation\" for Britain's withdrawal from the EU.\n\nLord Liddle, a former special adviser on European matters to Tony Blair, said Mr Corbyn has failed to fight plans for a hard Brexit and instead marched his MPs through the division lobbies to vote for it."
