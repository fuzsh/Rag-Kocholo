HISTORICAL NEWS 144 ii The North Carolina Historical Review Volume XXIX JANUARY, 1952 Number 1 ADELAIDE LISETTA FRIES1 By Douglas LeTell Rights Adelaide Lisetta Fries, a native of Salem, North Carolina, was born November 12, 1871, in a town rich in tradition and, since its founding in 1766, well provided with cultural advantages. Her parents, John W. and Agnes Sophia de Schweinitz Fries, were prominent in the community and devoted members of the Moravian Church. Her family had long been among the leaders of the Unitas Fratrum, or Moravian Church, dating on the one side to Michael Jaeschke, a refugee who came from Bohemia to settle on the estate of Count Zinzendorf in the early eighteenth century, and on the other side to Count Nicholas von Zinzendorf himself, who has been called \"Father of the Renewed Moravian Church.\" Further mention should be made of the father, whose in- fluence was strong in the development of her professional interest and in determining the main direction of her talents. John W. Fries combined the qualifications of a businessman and a scholar. He was an industrial leader, manufacturer, banker, and churchman, but he found time also for scholarly pursuits and was a trustee of the University of North Carolina, Salem College, and other institutions. His encouragement and advice were welcome to the gifted daughter and she acknowledged her debt to him in the dedication of one of her volumes to \"My companion in the silent places of historical research.\" As John Henry Boner, the poet, described it, the Salem of his youth was A little town with grassy ways And shady streets where life hums low. 1 A paper read at the meeting of the Historical Society of North Carolina, Winston-Salem, October 20, 1950. [1] 2 The North Carolina Historical Review The community retained much of this atmosphere of tran- quillity in the youth of Adelaide Fries, with interests centered in church and school. She attended Salem Academy and grad- uated in 1888. Two years later she received the degree of Bachelor of Arts from Salem College. Early in life she became interested in historical research. Twice she visited Europe and on these tours abroad she spent considerable time studying the collection of valuable material in the Moravian archives at the ancient center of the renewed Moravian Church in Saxony. The first visit was in 1899 and the second in 1909. On September 26, 1911, she was appointed archivist for the Southern Province of the Moravian Church in America, and for nearly forty years she rendered excellent service in this position. Her appointment did not bring an easy task. The ancient records, beginning in North Carolina in 1752, were remarkable for their abundance, care in preparation, and scope of review, but they were scattered here and there and subject to abuse. Like the lost books of Livy, there was a gap in the records of a congregation dating from colonial days — a loss which, accord- ing to tradition, was caused by the pastor of an early period who used the missing pages for lighting his pipe. An original letter, signed by President George Washington and addressed with complimentary message to the inhabitants of the town of Salem, she discovered by chance tucked away in a pigeonhole of the desk of the church warden. With characteristic thorough- ness she assembled from offices, schools, pastors' studies, and other sources a great collection unrivalled in the state's com- munity histories. She established the first independent archives building and moved the collection there, and much later she superintended the preparation of another building suited for protection of material and for accommodation of students in their study, and here her final years of labor were passed. Her office was always open to those who sought information about Salem, or any other subject of historical nature. She had a passion for accuracy which characterizes a true archivist but she combined with this a desire to help anyone who was inter- ested in seeking information in the books and manuscripts that Adelaide Lisetta Fries 3 abounded in her collection. In her personal diary she recorded one day: \"There were four visitors at the archives today — two students engaged in research, one caller investigating a family tree, and a visitor who did not know when it was time to leave.\" An added difficulty appears in the archivist's office in Salem because the early records of the community for nearly a century, comprising perhaps 15,000 pages, were written in German, and the handwriting, often cramped and diminutive, was in script of the time. Although she had little knowledge of the language through study in school, Dr. Fries mastered the situation. Pains- takingly she studied the language and became proficient in trans- lation, as her numerous volumes and papers bear witness. As an author she achieved national recognition. In the library catalogue of the University of North Carolina-Duke University there are twenty-three card references. The first volume pub- lished by her was the history of Forsyth County, in 1898, and interestingly enough, the last was a volume edited by her with the assistance of five coeditors, entitled Forsyth, a County on the March. This last was written as the centennial history of Forsyth County and was awarded the silver cup for the best county history written in 1949. Among other publications were The Moravians in Georgia, Funeral Chorales of the Unitas Fratrum, The Town Builders, Some Moravian Heroes, and Moravian Customs — Our Inherit- ance. She edited Bishop Edward Rondthaler's Memorabilia of Fifty Years. In her last year she completed a booklet, Distinctive Customs and Practices of the Moravian Church. Numerous ar- ticles written by her were published in The North Carolina Historical Review, the Wachovia Moravian, the University of North Carolina Magazine, and other publications. Her monumental works were The Road to Salem, published by the University of North Carolina Press, and the Records of the Moravians in North Carolina, published by the North Caro- lina Historical Commission and later by the State Department of Archives and History. The former is an historical novel for which she was signally honored in 1944 by being awarded the Mayflower Cup, presented annually to the North Carolinian adjudged to have written the best book during the year. The latter work, consisting of seven published volumes and an eighth 4 The North Carolina Historical Review in process of completion, contains the English translation from the German records of the Moravian churches in North Caro- lina, beginning with the year 1752. Her abundant labors were not confined to the seclusion of the archives. She was the recipient of many honors. From 1905 to 1934 she was president of the Salem College Alumnae Asso- ciation. She helped organize and became president of the North Carolina Federation of Women's Clubs. She served as president of the North Carolina State Literary and Historical Association, and in 1947 she was elected president of the North Carolina Historical Society, which she helped reorganize. She was listed in Who's Who in America and in the Biographical Quarterly of London. In 1916 she was awarded the degree of Master of Arts at Salem College. Three times the honorary degree of Doctor of Letters was conferred on her : first in 1932 by Moravian College ; again in May, 1945, by Wake Forest College ; and the next month by the University of North Carolina, at which time she was pleased to wear the same academic gown worn by her father when he received a similar degree from the University. In addition to these honors she was a member of the American Association for State and Local History, the North Carolina Folklore Society, the North Carolina Society for the Preserva- tion of Antiquities, the National Genealogical Society, and the Institute of American Genealogy. She was a member of the board of directors of the Wachovia Historical Society, a former president of the Woman's Foreign Missionary Society of the Home Church, and an honorary member of the Winston-Salem Altrusa Club. Though she did not aspire to the distinction, she became a public speaker of acknowledged repute and was noted for her good sense, adaptability, felicity of expression, and inspiration, combined always with the voice of authority. It was ever a keen delight to her to engage in unraveling mysteries of an historical nature. As an example, in her last days she was engaged in solving the mystery of an old printing press. In the Wachovia Museum there is an ancient hand press with the notation that it was used to print proclamations of Lord Cornwallis in Hillsboro. Somehow Dr. Fries seized upon this statement and sensed that it was not correct. With the zeal Adelaide Lisetta Fries 5 of a sleuth of Scotland Yard she entered upon investigation. She made contacts with the University library, the State De- partment of Archives and History, the Library of Congress, Franklin Institute, and many other sources of authority, in- cluding the Public Record Office in London, England, which gave her assurance that Lord Cornwallis issued his proclamations at Hillsboro in handwriting. Death came before the mystery was solved, but she laid the groundwork that resulted in the identifi- cation of the printing press as a Ramage press, one of only seventeen early American presses known to be in existence in the country today. It was her privilege to be occupied with her accustomed duties until a few hours before her death. After a brief illness she fell peacefully asleep Tuesday morning, November 29, 1949. The memoir prepared by her pastor, in addition to listing her accomplishments as archivist and historian, included these state- ments : She loved flowers and her garden; she always had a story to tell to little children, and she possessed a sense of humor that was quite remarkable. As the years passed she was aware of her lessened physical strength but she never grew old in her outlook upon life or in her attitude toward her friends and acquaintances. When she was compelled to spend a number of weeks in the hospital several years ago, she never murmured or complained. She was only grateful for the care which was given her. She was a gracious and generous soul.

Pp. vii, 138.) A BOOK PEDLAR'S PROGRESS IN NORTH CAROLINA By James S. Purcell An interesting chapter in the Kulturgeschichte of early North Carolina recounts the activities of a colorful colporteur, the Reverend Mason Locke Weems, who for two decades travelled throughout the state. The journeys of this zealous bookselling parson, better known as the highly imaginative biographer of George Washington, can be traced in his letters,1 but the story becomes considerably more enlightening with the addition of notices in contemporary newspapers and comments in letters and diaries of North Carolinians with whom he had dealings. The Parson's interest in North Carolina as a book market first became evident in the closing years of the eighteenth century. The Virginia & North Carolina Almanac, For the Year of Our Lord 1800 . . . made its appearance, doubtless, in the fall of 1799.2 This bipartite almanac of thirty-seven pages was printed in Fredericksburg, Virginia, \"for the Rev. Mason L. Weems.\" It was obviously an economical bid by Weems for a part of the lucrative almanac monopoly enjoyed in the upper part of North Carolina by Abraham Hodge, editor of the North-Carolina Journal at Halifax. The title page was an almost exact reproduction of that of Weems's Virginia almanac; the text varied only in that the court calendar included the courts of North Carolina and Mary- land as well as those of Virginia. The reading matter \"designed for entertainment and instruction\" was the same — unsigned ex- cerpts from Weems's own Hymen's Recruiting Serjeant? But Weems's chief interest in North Carolina in the early years of the nineteenth century was in securing subscriptions to Chief Justice Marshall's monumental Life of Washington which had 1 Emily Ellsworth Skeel, Mason Locke. Weems, His Works and Ways (New York, 1929). This rare work was begun by Mrs. Skeel's brother, Paul Leicester Ford. There are three volumes; the letters, with copious notes, appear in the second and third volumes, of which only 300 copies were printed. Mason Locke Weems (October 11, 1759-May 23, 1825), Episcopal clergyman, book agent, publisher, and writer, was born in Anne Arundel County, Maryland. He was admitted to the Anglican priesthood, September 12, 1784, and served parishes in Maryland and Virginia, notably Pohick Church (and thus became \"Formerly Rector of Mt. Vernon Parish\"). For thirty-one years, from 1794 until his death in Beaufort, South Carolina, he was a zestful bookseller, chiefly as the agent of Mathew Carey of Philadelphia, wandering up and down the eastern seaboard but maintaining his family of ten children among his wife's people in Dumfries, Virginia. 2 Copy in library of the American Antiquarian Society, Worcester, Mass. 8 Hymen's Recruiting Serjeant, Weems's \"sweet persuasions to wedlock,\" was published in two parts, the first in 1799 and the second in 1800. This pamphlet, with The Drunkard's Looking Glass (1812) and God's Revenge Against Adultery (1815), appears in Mrs. Skeel's edition of Three Discourses by Mason Locke Weems (New York, 1929). [8] A Book Pedlar's Progress in North Carolina 9 been announced for publication by C. P. Wayne of Philadelphia. In the early fall of 1802 Wayne had advertised in a North Caro- lina newspaper : Life of General Washington The Subscriber Having purchased for publishing it by subscription. . . . The work will be handsomely printed, with a new type, on vellum paper, hot-pressed, to be comprised in four or five octavo volumes of from 450 to 500 pages each. . . . The price to subscribers will be three Dollars each Volume in Boards; and the Price of one Volume to be paid in advance, on subscribing ; this advance to be continued with each Volume, until the work is completed. . . .4 To this notice Wayne added a note : \"The Publisher intending to visit many of the large towns of the United States, for the pur- pose of obtaining Subscribers, declines at present employing Agents for that purpose.\" Weems's persuasive powers must have worked, however, for he was soon the southern representa- tive of Wayne and about a year later appeared in North Caro- lina.5 On January 28, 1804, he wrote to Wayne from Fayetteville, where he found himself engaged in supplementing the subscrip- tions already obtained by the local bookseller: I came to this town 11 o'clock this morning, — found that a Mr. McRae (Post Master) had obtained 15 subs. This dum- f ounded me somewhat — but, rallying, I fell to work, and greatly to my surprise, obtain'd 22 more. Mr. Grove (Member of Con- gress, last session) says I may obtain a vast many more, if I can but attend at the Superior Court here 23 of April. . . .6 Weems prided himself on knowing what his buyers wanted — \"feeling the pulse\" was his phrase. He insisted that fine bindings be sent to this territory. Recognizing the turbulent political situation in North Carolina in the early 1800's, he wrote: 4 Raleigh Register, October 19, 1802. 5 From his letters it would be thought that Weems travelled south of Virginia for the first time in 1804. But it is likely that he was in Georgia as early as 1797. The Augusta Chronicle, June 13, 1797, states that the Rev. M. L. Weems married a couple in Burke County, Georgia, on May 28, 1797. 6 Skeel, Weems, II, 290. Duncan MacRae, long-time postmaster, bookseller, and general merchant of Fayetteville, advertised books for sale in the Raleigh Minerva, August 13, 1804, and the Fayetteville North Carolina Intelligencer, October 11, 1806. Records of his trans- actions with Mathew Carey, Philadelphia publisher and bookseller, from 1812 until 1818 can be seen in the collection of the Mathew Carey accounts at the American Antiquarian Society, Worcester, Mass. Before the State Assembly of 1806 enacted a law creating a superior court in each county, Fayetteville was one of the eight towns in the state where superior court sessions were held twice a year. William Barry Grove was the leading Federalist of the Fayetteville area; he was a member of Congress from 1791 until 1803. 10 The North Carolina Historical Review \"Nothing, nothing will do either Feds or Denis but Calf binding.\" Again he warned Wayne from Fayetteville : \"Take notice, No- body will subscribe for the work in boards.\" And from Halifax he was asking for \"cataracts of Books — Gilt and all Gilt.\"7 Although he was chiefly concerned with getting subscriptions to Marshall's Life of Washington, Weems had other irons in the fire. From Fayetteville he reported to Wayne: \"I have taken a light carriage with a driver to vend some little Books while I shd be, (for my own sake) employ d in getting Subs to Washing- ton.\"8 Meanwhile, he was also selling books for Mathew Carey, the Philadelphia bookseller with whom he maintained an oft- strained connection for more than twenty years. After a week in Fayetteville he left for Wilmington and wrote Carey from there : \"As I have your little stage with me (having parted with my own . . .) I shall be willing that Mrs. Weems' brother, who drives me, shall try to vend some Bibles for you.\"9 He requested that a box of assorted books be sent him \"also my 4 [00] or 500 Hymen recruitg Serjeant no. 2, I mean the 'Nest of Love/ In these warm latitudes there is a great call for both Nos but the 1st is unfortunately run out.\" Weems, with his fiddle, continued his journey south, can- vassed parts of South Carolina and Georgia, and in June re- turned northward through piedmont North Carolina. At Salisbury he presented a letter of introduction from John Chest- nut of Camden, South Carolina, to General John Steele, former Comptroller of the United States. Chestnut wrote : The Revd Mr. Weems is on his way northward, and purposes taking Salisbury on his way, and being a Stranger in that town, I take the liberty to recommend him to your civilities & attention. He is procuring Subscriptions for the Life of General Wash- ington wch will soon be published — and I presume the life of that great & worthy man — Written by Judge Marshall, will be eagerly sought for by every enlightened American. . . .10 The results of the Weems-Steele association will be told later. 7 Weems to Wayne, Halifax, N. C, February 9, 1805, Skeel, Weems, II, 313. 8 Skeel, Weems, II, 291. 9 Skeel, Weems, II, 292. Carey's Family Bible was an exceedingly popular item; it was frequently advertised in North Carolina newspapers. Weems once wrote Carey: \"I could make a good living by the Bible & Washington [Weems's . . . Washington] alone.\" Skeel Weems, III, 73. 10 Chestnut to Steele, Camden, S. C, June 17, 1804, H. M.

A Book Pedlar's Progress in North Carolina 11 From Chapel Hill, Weems complained again to Wayne of a matter that he had met with at Fayetteville — that he was forced to compete with the local booksellers. Consequently he advised his employer: ... I beg you not to send any books to any town for my Sub- scribers. You wd also very seriously oblige me if you were to furnish to your Post Masters, Book venders &c &c who have taken subs, no more copies than for their subscribers. I.E., I shd be glad to see this business confin'd (if possible) to Mr. Ormond and myself. By chipping & frittering it away among a thousand little whippers in, you will make it uninteresting to us, and hence must ensue a languor dangerous to the whole enterprize.11 He also told Wayne of his plans to take New Bern on his way to the South — \"Reports of well-informed Persons make that place worth 80 or 100 copies\" — and begged him not to send any books to the booksellers there. The beginning of the following year, 1805, saw Weems again in North Carolina, writing to Wayne from Halifax for \"cataracts of Books\" and promising to remit three or four hundred dollars from Warrenton.12 A few days later he was in Warrenton calling for more books : \"I shall want a host of books this campaign.\"13 From Tarboro, ten days later, he tallied up his remittances and remarked: \"Well 3000$ in 10 weeks is not quite so bad — and hardly any books to boot ! ! ! What might I not do, well kept in blast [ballast?] ? O think of that and reform!\"14 Weems was having other troubles too. The first edition of the volumes he had promised to the subscribers — volumes one and two — was exhausted and he was having to deliver the second edition, which was received with bad grace. When he was calling for books, Weems had repeatedly pleaded with Wayne, \"for your own sake, all of edit. No. 1.\" From Tarboro he tried another ap- proach: \"Wou'd God you cou'd send the 2d edit, to Ormond & the Puritans of the North. 'Tis their profession to bear & for- bear and to do good for evil. The people in the South are Infidels. They will run horn mad if you vex 'em in the Life of Wash.\"15 \" Weems to Wayne, Chapel Hill, N. C, July 11, 1804, Skeel, Weems, II, 300. John Ormond was Weems's less colorful counterpart in the northern states. 12 Weems to Wayne, Halifax, N. C, February 9, 1805, Skeel, Weems, II, 313. 13 \"Weems to Wayne, Warrenton, N.

According to Weems the paper of the second edition was \"so thin as to make the volume but half as thick as the former.\" 12 The North Carolina Historical Review Several weeks later, in New Bern he reiterated this theme : \"The people there [in the North] are more religious than they are here, and wd not curse & swear so sadly under what they might deem ill treatment.\"16 On this 1805 jaunt the Parson evidently was alone in his travels. From New Bern he wrote Wayne that he was returning \"some little miscellaneous books which I had planned and meant to vend for mutual benefit.\" He had nobody with him to attend to \"this Tom Thumb Merchandize.', He must devote all his time and efforts to the Washington and found that \"the sale of this trumpery wd prove a most serious hindrance to the Great Work.\"17 The Raleigh area was evidently missed in the 1805 journey. The persons in the environs of the capital of the state who had placed their subscriptions with one of the two local booksellers had received their two volumes in November, 1804, and in March, 1805, had promise of the third.18 Joseph Gales, the editor of the Raleigh Register, who with his wife, Winifred, had a flourishing book business, doubtless took pleasure in inserting this item into his local news column : A Subscriber wishes published the following QUERY How will those persons who subscribed with Mr. Weems for the Life of Washington, find where he is or when he means to deliver them their books, or how are they to get either the books or the money?19 This restive spirit in the vicinity of the capital did not inter- fere with the success of the bookselling Parson in other sections of the state. The subscription canvass of 1806 took him to the seaboard towns for a stay of almost three months, and profitable months they were. He reported to Wayne on his collections : Since March (the beginning of) I have sent you, as follows from w Weems to Wayne, New Bern, N.

This amount, while it bespeaks a literary interest in the state, also bears out Weems's modest statement about his abilities: \"The world is pleased to say that I have talents at the subscription business.\"21 The fifth and final volume of Marshall's Life of Washington, excepting the promised atlas, was published in 1807. But Weems's work with the book in North Carolina was far from done. Many of his customers were complaining of non-delivery; Weems did \"vex 'em in the Life of Wash.\" and they were running horn mad. In Edenton the Parson's defection was proclaimed in the news- paper. Mr. Editor, Can you inform us what has become of a certain Parson Weems, who passed through this State some time ago fiddling and hawking the Life of Gen. Washington, written by Judge Marshall, that same Judge who is now presiding on the trial of Aaron Burr, and who wanted to give judgment for half of North Carolina in favour of the Earl of Granville's heirs? Now if the said Weems does not shortly let us hear from him, and appoint time and place when and where he will deliver the bal- ance of the work, or return the money he has pocketed from the subscribers, we shall as soon as the trial of said Burr is over, lay the matter bef ore the Judge himself. . . ,22 Evidence of collective exhaustion of patience in Tarboro came to Wayne himself. \"Sundry Inhabitants of Tarboro, N. C.\" — four- teen in number — signed the following letter of grievance : 20 Weems to Wayne, Charleston, S. C, June 5, 1806, Skeel, Weems, II, 335. For some rea. son or other Weems, later in his letter, reported thus unflatteringly about a North Carolina town: \"That Louisburg is a Devil of a place. This is the 2d time that I've been in the frights about it.\" 21 Weems to Wayne, Norfolk, Va., January 25, 1805, \"A Weems Letter,\" American His- torical Record, II (February, 1873), 82. 22 Edenton Gazette, October 15, 1807. 14 The North Carolina Historical Review We the undersigned beg leave to represent to Mr. C. P. Wayne — that we became Subscribers to the \"Life of Washing- ton\" & paid Mr. Weems $12 — upon receipt of the 1st and 2d volumes of the work — that in April 1806 we received from Mr. Weems the 4th volume & paid him $8 the balance of the sub- scription money — since which time, altho' we have repeatedly, through Genl. Thos. Blount made application to Mr. Weams [sic'] for the remaining volumes — promises to deliver them are all we have been able to procure. We therefore desire to know of Mr. Wayne whether we are to rely on Mr. Weams [sic] for the volumes still wanting (in which case we must abandon all expectation of receiving them) or whether he Mr. Wayne will deliver them. If the latter Dr. Battle will receive & forward them to us. . . .23 When Wayne relayed these complaints to his southern represent- ative, Weems answered : It grieves me that you should credit the \"distressing accounts'' as you call them, that are sent to you. . . . Certainly Mr. Wayne you must know that the communications are from some Malig- nant Rascals or other — So help me God, I have separated myself from a most affect wife & family for 24 months & about two thirds of that time were spent in plying between Augusta, Wash- ington, Louisville, &c &c to distribute the books & receive monies for you ! Was I not at Georgetown 8 days — at Newbern 8 days — at Wilmington 6 days — with the 1.2d.3d. & 4th vols distributed to all who wd receive — for many swore they wou'd not receive till they cou'd see the last Vols & Atlass. At Fayette [ville] I had but a few Subs, and I beggd McCrae [MacRae] to distribute to them he having tendered his services thereto. . . ,24 The conclusion of the whole matter of Weems and Marshall's Life of Washington was heard in the notice in the columns of an Edenton newspaper, September 24, 1811, nearly four years after the publication of the final volume: We are desired by the Rev. M. L. Weems, to inform the sub- scribers to the life of Washington, that their Books, elegantly finished, will be ready for delivery at our Superior Court on Monday next.25 On the same day from Warrenton, Weems wrote to Mathew Carey, the Philadelphian for whom he was to work full time, as Thomas Blount Hudson et al. to Wayne, Tarboro, N. C, May 30, 1808, Skeel, Weems, II, 377. 24 Weems to Wayne, Dumfries, Va., June 20, 1808, Skeel, Weems, II, 380. 25 Edenton Gazette, September 24, 1811.

During the years 1809 and 1810 he sold $24,000 worth of books for him in the South.27 Ever zealous in his plans for Carey and himself, the Parson wrote to his new employer : \"I pray you to spend no more paper, ink, nor time nor argument to persuade me to exertion and Perseverance in circulating Valuable Books, I am chockfull of Zeal burning with the Book fever and so are you.\"28 Weems asked Carey — \"10000 times begg'd\" him — for permission \"to go through 1000 neighbourhoods feeling the pulse of Preachers, Schoolmasters\" and suiting a book assortment to the taste of the \"Religion, Politics, and general reading of the people.\"29 He told Carey what he desired of him — \"supply me plenty of books and let me choose the Books & allow some reasonable seed time\" — and expected to establish for the Philadelphia bookseller \"from 2 [00] to 300 illuminating, moralizing book stores.\"30 In 1808 Weems was making some progress in North Carolina with his grandiose plans. He ignored the seaboard towns but recognized the possibilities of the piedmont area31 — \"the middle and western counties, villages, &c &c be my range.\" He wrote enthusiastically to Carey: \"I shall want in toto pro tempore presenti . . . 1000, Peter Davis Warrenton, N. Carolina — 1000, Colo. Vaughan Mercht. Williamsboro No. Carolina — 2000 to Genl Steel (former Comptroller Genl U. S.) Salisbury, N. Caro- lina.\"32 26 Weems to Carey, Warrenton, N.

As early as May 22, 1806, writing to Carey from Wilmington, Weems had suggested the chain of bookstores: \"Let me, or any other Person, establish 1, 2, or 300 very safe & judicious Little Book stores throughout these Southern States. These 1, 2, or 300 very safe, because well chosen, Gentlemen may be vending books & remitting monies at the same time. Under proper management, i e of Books well selected, and store keepers well chosen, I am very sure that immense Good may be done to the Country & immense profit may accrue to yourself.\" Skeel, Weems, II, 334. In the fall of 1811, Weems at least regarded the matter as a fait accompli: \"3 weeks more & I shall enter on the cordon of your book stores established 2 years ago.\" Weems to Carey, Warrenton, N. C, September 24, 1811, Skeel, Weems, III, 54. 31 The Parson believed heartily in the idea of cheap books for all: \"It is but rare that I want to see an Author that stands higher than a dollar.\" Weems to Carey, Dumfries, Va., March 25, 1809, Skeel, Weems, II, 398. 32 Weems to Carey, n. p., September 29, 1818, Skeel, Weems, II, 380. Peter R. Davis was postmaster at Warrenton from 1805 until 1807; Colonel James Vaughan was a planter near Williamsboro, Granville County; and General John Steele, after retiring as Comptroller General in 1802, was regarded as the \"most conspicuous member of the Federalist party in North Carolina.\" 16 The North Carolina Historical Review In the case of General Steele, one of early North Carolina's favored sons, Weems's enthusiasm for bookselling seems to have exceeded the bounds of accepted decorum. The Parson had been recommended to the \"civilities & attention\" of the General back in the Life of Washington canvass days of 1804. Weems, who was no respector of persons, evidently presumed too much as this apologetic letter from Carey to Steele explains: Your favor of the 14th. which I read yesterday, has astonished me inexpressibly, & affords an additional proof of the extreme incorrectness of Mr. Weems's conduct, which has produced the most serious inconvenience & injury to me. He gave me clearly & explicitly to understand that you were zealously disposed, & even eager to cooperate with him & myself in the sale of Books — else> Sir, be assured I should never have troubled you with a Book, or with my correspondence. I had no idea that your agency in the business was to be merely \"to request one of the Store- keepers to receive them\" ; I assuredly believed you were to dis- pose of them yourself, & conceived you were a Storekeeper, or merchant — not a planter. Should the Books arrive, I request Sir, you will have them stored somewhere till I take the necessary steps to dispose of them. By no means deliver them to any Store- keeper for sale. . . ,33 For his part Weems blamed Carey. In a later recital of his grievances to his employer he included this: \"Nor would Genl. Steele of Salisbury have anything to do with three boxes sent to Petersburg for him, on getting your uncivil letters to him ! !\"34 Despite such rebuffs Weems maintained that his zeal was \"equal to that of any Adventurer in this Great Work of circu- lating good books & useful knowledge.\"35 He complained, how- ever, that his plan for selling had \"never yet had a fair trial.\" Carey would not let him \"go forward & choose books for the places\" but insisted on \"pushing on the books at random\" and consequently committed \"errors equal to those of sending 'fiddles to Methodist meetinghouses.' \"36 But the Parson persevered ; during the summer of 1811 he was in the north central part of the state. Here he had more success in his dealings with his local 33 Carey to John Steele, Philadelphia, Pa., January 24, 1810, Steele Papers, North Carolina Historical Society, Chapel Hill, N. C. H. M. Wagstaff, ed., The Papers of John Steele, 620, published this letter but erroneously read \"Weaver's for \"Weems.\" The word is clearly \"Weems's.\" Carey need not have been quite so abject. In his youth, Steele had engaged in \"practicing merchandising\"; after his death in 1815 his widow kept the famous Steele's Tavern in Salisbury. 34 Weems to Carey, Richmond, Va., November 21, 1811, Skeel, Weems, III, 56. 35 Weems to Carey, Dumfries, Va., November 23, 1811, Skeel, Weems, III, 57. 36 \"Weems to Carey, Lexington, Va., March 15, 1811, Skeel, Weems, III, 41.

The recently built local academy was also to be furnished with books, at six cents above the Philadelphia prices.37 On this journey Weems went again to Louisburg, that \"Devil of a place.\" His letter from there suggests the literary tastes of some North Carolinians in 1811 : I was much importuned for the following books. ... 6 Salma- gundi— 6 Yankee in London, and some of the latest & best treatises on the Military Art. And some of the newest & most popular pamphlets, & some droll, dashing pieces in the way of Biography, pictures of living manners. Wit, humor. . . .38 The following year the beginning of the War of 1812 curtailed somewhat Weems's bookselling activities in the state. Carey wrote him: \"The declaration of war deranges all our plans. I must not send goods to N. or South Carolina or Georgia as no insurance can be made on them.\"39 Weems continued with his plans for a trip to North Carolina to look after the books that had already been distributed there. The \"sickly season\" of the sum- mer of 1812 he spent in the \"upper & healthy parts\" of the state, progressing from court session to court session, selling books and collecting old debts.40 The next spring, accompanied by his nephew, Elijah Weems, he was again hawking books at the court gatherings in the northern section. Two weeks later Elijah was left to work the court crowd at Northampton while the Parson went to Petersburg, Virginia, to replenish his stock, preparatory to assaulting Halifax.41 37 Weems to Carey, Red House, N.

Elijah Weems was for a short time a resident of North Carolina. Early in 1815 he opened 18 The North Carolina Historical Review There are no extant records to indicate that Parson Weems was in North Carolina in the years between his 1813 visit and the early summer of 1821, when he was busy in the seaboard area of the state.42 In the winter of 1821-1822 he was in the piedmont section, appearing with his boxes of books in Halifax, Murfreesboro, Greensboro, Raleigh, Chapel Hill, and Hillsboro.43 Surely he must have included some section of the state in his fate- ful itinerary to South Carolina, where he died on May 23, 1825. The obituary that appeared in the Warrenton Reporter, July 8, 1825, is one of the standard sources of information about his life.44 In the Raleigh Register, July 12, 1825, Joseph Gales wrote feelingly of the deceased Parson \"as the author of the Life of Washington, and various other popular works, which have passed through numerous editions, and have had a most extensive circu- lation\" ; he described him as \"a man of very considerable attain- ment both as a scholar, a physician and divine\"; but he dwelt most on his lifetime of bookselling: [He] voluntarily commenced a career of incessant bodily toil, to disseminate moral and religious books in various remote and destitute portions of the country. From Pennsylvania to the frontiers of Georgia was the principal theatre of his indefati- gable labors, and it is supposed on good authority, that in the course of his life he has been instrumental in circulating nearly a million copies of the scriptures and other valuable works. That in this laborious calling he was principally actuated by an ex- panded philanthropy, is proved by his entire neglect of the means of accumulating a large fortune and dying in compara- tive poverty. . . . He finally fell a martyr to his arduous exertions to do good. . . . The influence of Parson Weems on the reading habits of North Carolinians in the early 1800's was not limited to his bookselling activities, telling as they were. Weems's own moralizing works, many of them published by Carey, were popular, some of them a bookstore in Raleigh, making three in the town of less than two thousand inhabitants, one-third of which were slaves. Several months later he married a Raleigh girl, Miss Mary Shaw (Raleigh Register, November 17, 1815), but shortly was selling his stock at cost, \"ex- pecting to move to the North.\" Raleigh Register, January 26, 1816. 42 Carolina Centinel (New Bern, N.

Why were not Elegant Advertisements of this work, with letters critical & commendatory by Lee &c &c printed on colour'd paper, sent in the box?\"49 The Parson's Washington had already been publicized somewhat in Raleigh. In the Minerva of October 7, 1805, Boylan's North Carolina Almanack for 1806 was advertised as containing \"Extracts from the Rev. M. L. Weems History of the Life of George Washington.\" The Parson believed strongly in the moralizing influence of books. But he sagely advised Carey : \"Let the Moral and Religious be as highly dulcified as possible.\"50 To this end Weems wrote several palliatives — \"my little Serio comical mello dramatical pamphlets,\" he called them. These he circulated in North Carolina as well as the other southern states. One hundred and fifty copies of the one he referred to as \"my Mary Findley\" were sent to Raleigh in the fall of 1808.51 This account of wife murder in 45 On July 25, 1813, Weems, with evident petulance, wrote Carey from Dumfries, Virginia: \"All the books that I shall ever want of yours, will be the Family Bible & Washington [Weems's]. These with some heavy subscription book & my pamphlets, will serve my turn.\" Skeel, Weems, III, 97. 46 The title of the original work, published about 1800, was The Life and Memorable Actions of George Washington. Astute appraiser of humanity that he was, Weems must have noted the limited appeal of Marshall's ponderous Washington and pushed his own ancedotal account as being more suitable for reaching the really wide market of the masses — his aim in bookselling.

At this time Weems's book was selling phenomenally. On January 7, 1809, Weems had written Carey about the printing of five thousand copies \"of your spring edition of the Life of Washington for Petersburg, Norfolk, Halifax, Edinton — Tarboro, Washington [N.

In one of their periodic fits of mutual resentment he taunted Carey: \"And let me tell you, once for all, that if you are tired of the connexion I shall not use argument to bind you to it.

When this pamphlet was republished in 1809 with a slight change of title, it was noted to this extent in the Raleigh Star's column of brief book notices called \"Literary Intelligence\" : The Rev. Mason L. Weems, well known in the Southern States as agent for procuring subscribers for the Life of Washington, author of \"Hymen's Recruiting Serjeant or a Matrimonial Tattoo for the Bachelors,\" and several other whimsical and amusing publications, has lately published \"The Drown'd Wife, being a faithful history of the beautiful, but unfortunate Miss Polly Middleton, who, after bestowing herself with a fortune of four thousand dollars on a young husband, Mr. Edward Findley, was barbarously drowned by him in the eighth week after marriage.\" Doctor Ramsay gives the following character of the work: \"No man can read this pamphlet without having his risible faculties often excited — no man can read it without having his horror for vice and his respect for Virtue increased. The Writer has the art of blending instruction with amusement. While he keeps his readers in high humor by the frolicsomeness of his manner, he is inculcating upon them important moral and reli- gious truths, conducive to their present and future happiness.\"52 Two other pamphlets in the Revenge series were more closely connected with North Carolina. God's Revenge Against Adultery Aivfully Exemplified in the Following Cases of American Crime . . . (1815) included as one of its deterrents the case of \"The Elegant James ONeale, Esq. (North Carolina,) who, for Se- ducing the Beautiful Miss Matilda Lestrange, Was Killed by Her Brother.\" This twenty-three-page story in the seduction tradition was based on a tragic incident, doubtless related to Weems in his travels, that took place in the Wilmington area around 1790. Weems, and perhaps the actual circumstances, made sure that seduction was the capital crime; the avenging brother was im- prisoned for manslaughter, but as womankind's hero (soon to be pardoned by Governor Alexander Martin) in a perfumed and 52 Star, February 9, 1809. Some of the North Carolina newspaper editors tried to keep their readers informed of Weems's activities. Gales's Raleigh Register, August 4, 1806, reported: \"Mr. M. L. Weems, now at Charleston, S. C. has published in the Times, two columns of commendatory matter upon the character of the late venerable, and justly lamented George Wythe, Chancellor of Virginia.\" A Book Pedlar's Progress in North Carolina 21 beflowered cell.53 The other North Carolinian that Weems used in his crime-does-not-pay series was not written up so extensively. In God's Revenge against Gambling Exemplified in the Miserable Lives and Untimely Deaths of a Number of Persons of Both Sexes . . . (1810), the three-page account of \"T. Alston, Esq. (N. C.) who, from Gambling was shot by Capt. Johnson\" was only one of six examples of gamesters. Not only did Thomas Alston of Halifax have to compete with gentlemen from Virginia and Maryland but also with such worthies as Marie Antoinette and Fanny Braddock, sister of General Braddock. Another moralistic pamphlet of his own composition that Weems sold in North Carolina was The Drunkard's Looking- Glass Reflecting a Faithful Likeness of the Drunkard . . . (1812) . In the fall of the year of publication the author was at his home in Dumfries, Virginia, awaiting the arrival of a shipment of his pamphlet with which he \"wd set off immediately to N. Caro- lina/'54 Three weeks later, still waiting, he wrote exasperatedly to Carey : \"But for the faint hope it may do some good to Youth I coud almost wish I had never written that illfated pamphlet — tho' it outsells anything I have lately written.\"55 Two of Weems's pieces written primarily for the South Caro- lina market circulated to a limited extent in North Carolina. In 1808, one hundred and fifty copies of his little pamphlet on Francis Marion, the genesis of his The Life of Francis Marion (1810) , were sent to Gales's bookstore in Raleigh.56 Several years later, the Parson's account of an occurrence in the religious life of contemporary South Carolina was advertised regularly for nearly six months in a New Bern newspaper : Just Received and for Sale at S.

Hugh Blair's Sermons . . . , \"Reprinted for the Rev. M. L. Weems,\" by Samuel and John Adams in Baltimore, 1793. Weems's edition of Blair was offered for sale in Wilmington in 1803.58 The Parson attested to its popularity in the South when he wrote Wayne : \"I beg you to send no more Blair's to any place North of North Carolina.\"59 One hundred copies of this edition of the Scottish divine were sent to Edenton early in 1812 along with \"a cargo of valuable books\" consigned by Carey. Weems was responsible for yet another religious book, Sermons on Im- portant Subject by the Late Reverend and Pious Samuel Davies . . . , \"Printed for Mason L. Weems,\" in Baltimore in 1816. Weems's edition was doubtless the result of an observation he once made to Carey regarding the sermons of \"the Pulpit Henry of Virginia\" : \"This is a book in great demand in all these S. States.\"60 It was quite possible that at one time Weems was toying with the idea of publishing the work of a North Carolinian, General William R. Davie's \"Notes on the Revolution.\" The copy of this manuscript in the North Carolina Historical Society in Chapel Hill has this note, dated January 7, 1810, attached : If Genl Davie will please to have transcribed in a round legible hand the f ollowg valuable documents, and forward them to me to care of Doct.

A Book Pedlar's Progress in North Carolina 23 same fashion that he did General Peter Horry's account of Francis Marion. Because of his manifold activities Parson Weems had an in- estimable influence upon the cultural life of North Carolina in the first quarter of the nineteenth century. His bookselling was perhaps the most telling feature. In this respect his zeal was unbounded ; even his preaching was subordinate to it. As Bishop Meade observed somewhat sourly : \"He preached in every pulpit to which he could gain access, and where he could recommend his books.\"61 His enthusiasm must have lured many a laggard to literacy and his wit persuaded many a purchaser. His appeal was to all classes — from those to whom he sold^the expensive calfskin-bound Marshall's Washington to the half-educated rank and file at whom he aimed his own sketch of Washington. This gifted vagabond with his fiddle and ready tongue was a familiar figure to North Carolinians of the era, \"an object of amusement to many, and of profit to Mr. Carey\"62 as well as of benefit to the state as a whole. 61 Bishop [William] Meade, Old Churches, Ministers and Families of Virginia (Philadel- phia, 1900), II, 233. Evidently the Parson was a match for the Bishop; see Meade's own account: \"I once . . . found Mr. Weems with a bookcaseful [of books] for sale, in the portico of the tavern. On looking at them I saw Paine's 'Age of Reason,' and, taking it into my hand, turned to him, and asked if it were possible that he could sell such a book. He immediately took out the Bishop of Llandaff's answer, and said, 'Behold the antidote. The bane and antidote are both before you,' \" Meade, Old Churches, II, 235. 62 Meade, Old Churches, II, 233. HENRY McCULLOH : PROGENITOR OF THE STAMP ACT By James High The Stamp Act of 1765 was the starting point of the ten-year period that culminated in the American Revolution. The man who drafted the law, a forgotten clerk in a great office, believed that it could have worked had his recommendations been fol- lowed. The British ministers of state have had to bear the blame for losing the American colonies. Henry McCulloh has never been given any credit for his advice and foreknowledge of the crisis precipitated by the Stamp Act. That act caused George Grenville's ministry to fall. It was the first time an American issue had retired an English government.1 Henry McCulloh gave the idea of an American stamp duty its first written form, which he handed, unsolicited, to the Earl of Bute, first minister in 1761.2 It was examined and endorsed by Bute, Newcastle, Pelham, Halifax, and Grenville and was finally accepted by the latter as the basis for his infamous revenue measure of 1765.3 McCulloh produced the idea in 1761 and was 1 Technically, Grenville fell on the Regency Bill, but Rockingham formed the next ministry with Pitt in order to repeal the Stamp Act. George Grenville (1712-1770), British politician, famous for prosecuting Wilkes and instituting the Stamp Act. He is often identified with the \"King's Friends.\" One of his sons, George Nugent Temple Grenville, first Marquis of Buckingham (1753-1813), cousin of William Pitt, opposed Lord North. Another son, William Wyndham Grenville, first Baron Grenville (1759-1834), became Pitt's foreign secretary and formed the \"Ministry of All the Talents\" in 1806, when the slave trade was abolished. One may search almost in vain for the most trifling mention of American affairs in the published papers of George Grenville, and his official and secret correspondence while he headed the British ministry is preoccupied with European affairs to the complete exclusion of the colonies. He hardly thought of America, and when he did, it was as an appanage of the mercantile system of England. See Stowe Manuscripts (Henry E. Huntington Library and Art Gallery, San Marino, California), 6, for information con- cerning the assistance Grenville gave the Earl of Bute in getting rid of William Pitt in 1761. Lady Hester Pitt was made a baroness, and her husband was granted an annuity of £3,000, to give up the ministry and make peace. Stowe Manuscripts III, 1-2. Stowe Manuscripts, 7, cover the period of Grenville's administration, including his retirement from office without any mention of America. 2 Miscellaneous Representations relative to Our Concerns in America submitted in 1761 to the Karl of Bute, by Henry M'Culloh, . . . edited by William A. Shaw (London, n. d., 1905), 12. John Stuart, third Earl of Bute (1713-1792), was a Scottish noble often elected as representative peer to sit in the English Parliament. He was the first Scottish nobleman to head a British ministry. He married a daughter of Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, thus becoming very wealthy. He was very friendly with the young George III and his widowed mother, especially the latter. He helped the princess instill into the young prince the ideas of Bolingbroke on the nature cf the duties of a prince. He was also on intimate terms with another Scottish peer who had experienced trouble with Americans, John Campbell, fourth Earl of Loudoun. Loudoun Papers (Henry E. Huntington Library and Art Gallery), 9441- 9458. In 1769 he considered himself ignorant of English affairs and went to Lisbon for his health. Bute to Loudoun, August 19, 1769, LO 9443. Bute voted in 1766, against repeal of the Stamp Act, as he said, \"entirely from the private conviction ... of its very bad and dangerous consequences both to this country and our colonys.\" Caldwell Papers, Maitland Club (1854), II, pt. ii, 82. See Historical Manuscripts Commission, 9th Report, Appendix iii, 22. 8 Edmund S. Morgan, \"Postponement of the Stamp Act., William and Mary Quarterly, VII (July, 1950), 353-392, discusses the delay in putting through the act, partly to allow American discussion and partly because of indifference. [24] Henry McCulloh : Progenitor of the Stamp Act 25 hired to write the law in 1764. Had more attention been paid to McCulloh's provisions, and had items \"Exceptionable,\" as he put it, to the colonists not been included, American resistance to the Stamp Act would possibly have been less. It would, at least, have been on different grounds.4 McCulloh had been in the Plantation Office and the Colonial Office, had served as a crown officer in North and South Carolina, and had been in the naval expedition along with the Massachusetts men at the reduction of Louis- bourg. He was, therefore, in a position to understand Americans as well as anyone in the British government — better than any of the ministers. His law, altered in essential detail, was en- acted by Parliament in February, 1765.5 The changes, though seemingly slight, put a workable plan into a \"dress of Horror\" for Americans.6 They reacted against it immediately and violently.7 It is facile to say that George Grenville should have \"known better.\" It is equally easy to say the same of such a man as William Knox, one of the principal advisers of the Board of Trade on colonial affairs. Knox wrote many books on America and its administration, but he had spent little time in the colonies, and he could only think of the colonists as Englishmen 4 Sir Francis Bernard to the Earl of Halifax, November 10, 1764, Huntington Manuscripts (Henry E. Huntington Library and Art Gallery), 2586. Bernard was governor of Massa- chusetts during the Stamp Act controversy. He had never been firm in his belief that Parliament should impose taxes on the colonies. Typical of his attitude was his letter to Halifax, in which he said that \". . . the Trade of America is really the Trade of Great Britain and the opening and encouraging it is the most Effectual way for Great Britain to draw Money from America.\" See Select Letters on the Trade and Government of America by Governor Bernard (London, 1774). Daniel Dulany, Considerations on the Propriety of Imposing Taxes in the British Colonies, for the Purpose of Raising a Revenue by Act of Parliament (Annapolis, 1765), gave classic form to the American resistance to Parliamentary control based on resistance to the particular act. Without the Stamp Act, it would have had to take another form.

Stella F. Duff, \"The Case Against the King: The Virginia Gazettes Indict George III,\" William and Mary Quarterly, VI (July, 1949), shows the mounting rancor against England that grew from the Stamp Act. Even the English magazines in 1765 were not unfriendly to the American point of view: as an example, see Gentleman's Magazine, XXXV (October, 1765), 473: \"The Stamp Act has produced a spirit of opposition, in that remote part of the world, that was not perhaps foreseen by the advisers of that measure. The news of the late change in the ministry was received in America with bonfires, ringing of bells, and every public demonstration of joy.\" Effigies of Grenville were burned in all the colonies. 26 The North Carolina Historical Review abroad.8 Many Englishmen missed the significance of the colonial use of \"foreigner\" to include them.9 Looking back, the mistakes are evident, but in 1765, only a man with real interest and experience in America could see the colonists' point of view and yet perceive Parliamentary sovereignty as the supreme force in the empire.10 Who was this man who advised and influenced ministers, but could not convince them? He suggested the idea of the Stamp Act.11 He worked out the plan of taxation in detail.12 He wrote the first draft of the law.13 He then pointed out the reasons for its potential failure as it finally passed Parliament.14 He discerned that Englishmen who were chiefly interested in colonial trade would oppose such a measure, but that Englishmen on both sides of the Atlantic who found their main interest in land and the unification of the empire, would agree to the principal, and yet oppose the terms of the specific act. McCulloh, furthermore, devised a currency scheme, without which no American revenue law would work.15 Who was Henry McCulloh, and why has he been forgotten? Why he has been forgotten is simple. He was only a clerk in a great office. He soon drifted into that limbo of vague eighteenth century names, without birth or death dates — without recog- nition. 8 William Knox (1732-1810), permanent employee of the Board of Trade as an expert on American affairs wrote several books on American politics and administration, such as The Controversy between Great Britain and her Colonies Reviewed (London, Dublin, Boston, 1769). He thought that the Americans wanted to remove all imperial restrictions: \"When they shall have carried these several points, one after another, they will probably be content, whatever the people of England may be.\" 9 William Knox, Controversy .... 108-109 (London edition), gives Benjamin Franklin's opinion that British interference in the French and Indian war was not needed. The Americans drove out the French without \"foreign\" help. Gentlemen's Magazine, XXXV (April, 1765), 189ff., reviews a book, Objections to the Taxation of the American Colonies &c. considered, which held that the Americans were treated \". . . as aliens and slaves,\" by foreign rulers.

On the basis of one of Henry McCulloh's tracts, A Miscellaneous Essay concerning the Course pursued by Great Britain in the Affairs of her Colonies (London, 1755), this author has lumped him and William Knox and Thomas Whately into one category: they should have \"known better\" than attempt the Stamp Act. 10 The classic American point of view on the history of the Stamp Act was expressed early by George Bancroft, History of the United States of America, III (New York, 1888), 149JJ., that right in the form of American sovereignty was bound to triumph.

In English records he first appears as a minor official in the Plantation Office in 1733.16 The next notice of his existence was in 1738, when he presented two memorials to the Treasury Board concerning the improvement of quitrent collection in the Carolinas. He attempted to expose an alleged land fraud in the newly made crown colonies.17 The next year he was made \"Inspector for improving quit rents in North and South Carolina.\"18 Apparently he failed to collect enough to pay his own salary, because the North Carolina Assembly refused his petition for back pay in 1741.19 He styled himself at that time, \"Commissioner for supervising, inspecting, and controlling His Majesty's revenues and grants of lands in the province of North Carolina.\"20 His name next appears in 1744, when the Treasury Board in England refused to appropriate his still unpaid arrears out of the \"4% P cent duty\" on the West Indian trade.21 In financial desperation, McCulloh returned to England in 1745, to seek a commission in the navy. In his request to the Duke of Newcastle for letters of recommendation to Governor William Shirley of Massachusetts, he wrote: \"I rely wholly upon your friendship for my support,\" and expressed intention to board the \"Foulston man-of-war\" for Virginia, and so to Cape Breton.22 He remained in the garrison of Fort Louisbourg until it was returned to France by treaty at Aix-la-Chapelle.23 If McCulloh's life in England was quite prosaic, his American activities were spectacular. He entered colonial records with a grand flourish in 1737, as Henry McCulloh of Chiswick Parish, Middlesex, England, grantee of 1,200,000 acres of land in North Carolina.24 The terms of this princely grant required him to !6 Public Record Office, Treasury Board Papers, CCXCVIII, Number 38. 17 Public Record Office, Colonial Office 5, Plantations General, Number 30 (old style cita- tion, before the program of Project A was started).

Saunders ( 10 vols. Raleigh, 1886-1890), VI, 533, hereafter cited as Colonial Records. 28 The North Carolina Historical Review settle on it \"6,000 Protestants\" within ten years.25 The scheme he had to \"improve his Majesty's quit rents was to sub-grant his land in great seignories, collecting annually four shillings for each one hundred acres. The promoter was to keep half of the proceeds for his trouble.26 The plan was a failure, and within three years McCulloh was in sharp conflict with the colonial Assembly over the question of local sovereignty versus Parlia- mentary supremacy. They would neither pay his royal salary, nor would they admit that the king had any right to grant away great tracts of their colony.27 This land speculator and servant of the crown was learning the mettle of the Americans, and why they spoke of Englishmen as \"foreigners.\" By 1745, McCulloh had almost despaired of turning his land speculation to much account, but he still held his claims in North Carolina, now in conjunction with a group of Dublin entre- preneurs including Arthur Dobbs.28 Dobbs later became royal governor of the colony, and by 1761, had succeeded in wresting from his former friend the whole vast acreage.29 McCulloh, however, acquired a smaller tract on the Cape Fear River in 1745. It was only 71,160 acres: a pocketful as compared to the fabulous grant of 1737. During his absence from North Carolina (for now he spoke of it as his home), he delegated a relative, Alexander McCulloh, to sell outright this land.30 By that time he had less personal interest in the king's revenues. It is not apparent that he made any profit from this venture either, because in 1753 he petitioned the Duke of Newcastle for relief.31 He had been out of a job for five years, since the term- ination of his service at Louisbourg. 25 Colonial Records, V, xxxii, 769.

This grant was tied up with Governor Johnston's quarrel with the Assembly over the right to issue land patents. The Assembly held that they had the sole jurisdiction over the lands of the former proprietors of the colony. The dispute was ended only by the American Revolution. 31 McCulloh to Newcastle, June 22, 1753, British Museum, Additional Manuscripts, 32732:86. Thomas Pelham-Holles (1693-1768) was made Viscount Haughton and Earl of Clare and Suffolk upon the accession of George I and Duke of Newcastle-upon-Tyne two years later in 1715. He and his brother, Henry Pelham, figured in English politics until 1768. One or the other headed or was prominent in every ministry after 1717 until the end of the Seven Years' War. Henry McCulloh : Progenitor of the Stamp Act 29 For the next four years McCulloh besieged the duke for a position. He wanted especially the royal secretaryship of North Carolina.32 With that job he could collect a salary from the crown, and still be in a position to exploit his land grant which had been extended for ten more years in 1748.33 He kept track of the health of the incumbent secretary, and informed New- castle of developments: \". . . there is a further account of Mr. Rice's death, who was given over by the physicians, when the last ship came thence, . . . with the gout in his bowels and stomack.\"34 Secretary Rice failed the new aspirant and lived until 1756.35 In 1753 McCulloh, in hard financial straits, had to beg \". . . Mr. Pelham that he will pleased to grant me a small sum of money for a present relief untill I succeed, which is the only means of hope I now have left to preserve my little family and self from utter ruin.\"36 Failing to get the position in North Carolina, he applied for one in the Naval Office of the Lower District of the James River in Virginia; and subsequently for his old clerkship at the Board of Trade. He reported to his patron that the Earl of Halifax had rebuked him for his im- portunity, and wrote \". . . that I kept running teasing your Grace so . . . and that I asked everything, and that he supposed I wanted twenty places, and that I was one of those sort of people that could never be contented.\"37 Finally, in 1756, his name appears as Secretary and Clerk of the Crown of North Carolina. He retained the position until 1761, when he was reinstated in the Plantation Office.38 At the same time he finally lost all claim to his great grant of land in America; but an entry in colonial records shows Henry Eustare McCulloh, son of \"Henry McCulloh, late of Soracty in North Carolina,\" attempting to exploit 475,000 acres in \"Lord Gran- ville's tract.\"39 32 McCulloh to Newcastle, April 6, 1753, British Museum, Additional Manuscripts, 32731:338. 33 Petition of Henry McCulloh, May 16, 1739, Colonial Records, V, 488, 628-629. 34 McCulloh to Newcastle, March 26, 1753, British Museum, Additional Manuscripts, 32731:410. 30 Court and City Register, 1756.

His interest, sympathy, and intelligence prompted him to translate this experience into imperial policy when he had the chance. He almost succeeded. Just before the Stamp Act was finally drafted in 1764, the Treasury Board recorded \"Minutes and observations taken in conference with Mr. M'Culloh.\"41 This included a \". . . state of the several articles proposed by Mr. M'Culloh to be stamped, and the duties thereon; likewise a state of all the different articles which are now stamped in Great Britain, in order to fix upon the articles which are to be inserted in the law intended for imposing Stamp duties in America and the West Indies.\"42 The manuscript carries the following endorsement on the back of the last sheet: \"10th October 1763, was presented to Mr. Green vill, who approved it.\" Sometime during the following year the measure was expanded to include the \"duties intended by the Treasury,\" and McCulloh's scheme to stabilize colonial currency was eliminated.43 He was sure that this would \"defeat the whole of what is proposed.\"44 Henry McCulloh, co-author of the Stamp Act, knew in advance that it was foredoomed, because, as he wrote, \". . . there are several clauses inserted therein which are very Exceptionable, 40 Henry McCulloh, Miscellaneous Representations . . . , introduction. 41 Minutes and Observations taken in conference with Mr. McCulloh . . . , British Museum, Additional Manuscripts, 30226:357. 42 British Museum, Additional Manuscripts, 35910:137. Edmund S. Morgan, \"Postponement of the Stamp Act,\" 353#., points out that Grenville was not decided on the matter of a stamp duty in America until 1764, and then he allowed himself to be persuaded to substitute the Sugar Act. He is supposed to have deferred action on an internal tax until the Americans had been given a chance to perfect a plan of their own choosing. The manuscript, including \"duties intended by the Treasury,\" and endorsed by Grenville on October 10, 1763, tends to undermine this point of view. It is further weakened by the fact that such men as Benjamin Franklin, Jared Ingersoll, Charles Garth, and the rest of the colonial agents found no fault with the Stamp Act until after the Stamp Act Congress held in New York in October, 1765. See Verner W. Crane, Benjamin Franklin's Letters to the Press, 1758 to 1775 (Chapel Hill, 1950), 35-75 (on repeal, 25, 54-57). See also Jared Ingersoll, Ingersoll Stamp Act Correspondence (n. p., 1776), 26. 43 Benjamin Franklin's land bank scheme for supporting a colonial currency was turned down at the same time. Parliament was dominated by men interested in trade, and steeped in the beliefs of mercantilism. It was very difficult for them to envisage America as anything but an appanage of British trade. They failed generally to perceive the sovereign aspirations of the colonists. The fact was that the mercantile system was toppling of its own cumbersome weight. The Earl of Hillsborough, Secretary of State, wrote to Governor Horatio Sharpe of Maryland, that trade was being \". . . diverted from its natural course,\" which was from colony to mother country. He was bewildered, and he probably represented the majority of his contemporaries.

Henry McCulloh : Progenitor of the Stamp Act 31 and have . . . passed upon wrong Information.\"45 He even proposed that \". . . the Ladies in America\" had emulated the plan of Lysistrata, and \"that they have formed a kind of Con- federacy in all the Colonies, not to Permit any Officer concerned in the Stamp Duties to Visit them, or be Entertained at their Houses.\"46 The main points of potential failure that he brought up were : (1) interference in the American ecclesiastical arrangements; (2) the threat to local courts and the constitutional right of habeas corpus; (3) the lack of any reform in the circulation of specie; and (4) the mistaken concept of colonial unification and the need for mutual understanding of the sovereignty of Parliament. The manuscript which contains these \"General Thoughts . . . with respect to the late America Stamp Duty Bill . . .\" was presented for the \"Consideration of the Honourable Thomas Townsend by Henry McCulloh\" in 1765.47 If Townsend or anyone else ever considered it, no knowledge of the matter has come down to the present. The manuscript has remained unnoticed for one hundred and eighty-five years. It is a significant illustra- tion of the bumbling administration of the English colonies in the eighteenth century, and it shows that it was possible in 1765 for an Englishman to understand the quality of feeling in America. He must, however, have had a deep interest in the New World and long experience among its inhabitants. McCulloh touched the core of the constitutional struggle that was to develop between America and the mother country when he wrote concerning the application of stamps to wills and other documents of \"Courts Exercising Ecclesiastical jurisdic- tion: There is not in America any Ecclesiastical Courts, but the people Settled there, who are mostly Dissenters or Sectarys of various other Denominations, look upon [the Stamp Act] . . . as a prelude to the Establishment of such Courts; and many of them would sooner fforfeit their lives than pay 45 McCulloh, \"General Thoughts . . . ,\" Huntington Manuscripts, 1480. 48 McCulloh, \"General Thoughts . . . ,\" 12, Huntington Manuscripts, 1480. 47 Thomas Townshend was a member of the Board of Trade, related to the more famous and more inept Charles Townshend (1725-1767), who as Chancellor of the Exchequer tried to enforce import duties on glass, tea, lead, paint, etc., in America with as little success as Grenville had. Thomas Townshend usually voted on the Board of Trade as Soame Jenyns did. Jenyns gave classic form to the idea that no one would willingly tax himself and that therefore Parliament had the right to perform that function for all British subjects. 32 The North Carolina Historical Review Obedience to such Establishment.\"48 His experience as an of- ficer in the British navy in Massachusetts would have taught him that, when he sailed with the force under Sir William Pepperell. He continued: \"Their Teachers are likewise very Active in inflaming the Minds of the People, and will, from their dislike to the above Clause, give as much Opposition to the Stamp Duty Bill as if there was a Clause in it for Establishing a Court of Inquisition amongst them.\"49 He pointed out that the Church of England had failed to transport to America its prerogative in the probate of wills and issuance of marriage licenses. The bishop failed to migrate to the New World, and as McCulloh knew, \"The Governors in most of the Colonies act as Ordinary, in the probate of Wills: and in . . . Such Colonies where the Governors do not Exercise this power it is left to the County Courts.\"50 He touched the canker of resentment again when he com- mented on the provision of the Stamp Act that \"When any Suit of prosecution shall be Commenced in the Courts of Admiralty or Vice Admiralty, the said courts are . . . Authorized and required to proceed, hear and determine the same, at the Election of the Enformer or Prosecutor.\" This seemed to impinge on the ancient right of habeas corpus. \"The Colonies insist, that by the above Clause, they are denied the Privileges they are Intitled to as ffree born Subjects of the Mother Country; That they, as Colonists, are Intitled to the benefits of the Common Law of England, and to the Privileges Granted by Magna Charta, and that even admitting that our Parliament has a Right to Tax them, It cannot be inferred from thence that the Parliament has a Right to Disfranchise them, and bar them fr"
