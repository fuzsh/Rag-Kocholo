        "text": "At the Spring conference we will debate a topic which has spanned my whole political lifetime. We will be debating a motion on increasing the diversity among our future MPs.\n\nIn that election night in May 2015 we not only lost wonderful male MPs, we also lost all of our wonderful women MPs.\n\nOne of the things we must do as we rebuild our Party is to ensure that we have a more diverse group of MPs. Like the other major parties in Britain.\n\nI joined the SDP, new to politics, back in 1981. I was excited by the new party, the realignment of politics – but especially its emphasis on women being as prominent in the party as men. How could it not do so, with one leader being my beloved Shirley Williams? Its equivalent of the Federal Executive was gender balanced – each region elected one man and one woman. We were the first political party in the UK to insist that women must be included on parliamentary shortlists. I was selected from such a shortlist to fight Welwyn Hatfield in 1983 and 1987. (The more winnable seats close by – Stevenage and St Albans – were of course fought by men.)\n\nAnd what we found, in 1983 and 1987, is that men were indeed securing the most winnable seats. Having women on shortlists did not change things. It did not change our parliamentary group. I did better than my male colleagues in terms of increasing my share of the vote – being a woman did not lose votes, but we weren’t in seats that won.\n\nAt merger (I was on the negotiation committee), gender balance was a hotly debated topic – should we include the SDP’s affirmative action? Hard fought for, we did, though it was weaker than in the SDP. By this stage I was Chair of the Parliamentary Candidates Committee. We had able women a-plenty in the organisation. But they weren’t getting selected for our best seats. Mentoring, training – that must be the key, people said. All very helpful. But it did not make the difference. (I had done my PhD in the States and there I saw the positive action that got black students into universities, and the difference it made to their lives, and the USA. It worked.)\n\nBy the time of the 1992 election I was working full time, but now with two small children. (I was struck when I was a Minister that the vast majority of my male counterparts had partners and children, whereas this was rarely true for my female colleagues. So much for equal opportunities.) My main aim was to keep my head above water and not allow the Conference Committee, of which I was a member, to cancel the conference crèche because the party was in financial crisis as we were at 6% in the polls after the bloody battles of merger….\n\nI produced another infant, this time a girl, appropriate under the circumstances as I was now Chair of Women Liberal Democrats (WLD). Whereas my first infant had wailed through an FE meeting (my colleagues were fairly patient), this one aged 10 days wet Paddy Ashdown’s floor. I escaped quickly, but hereby confess now. Now she and her brothers are adult. Time has run on, but things have not changed.\n\nOne of Paddy’s assistants, Claire, Conway, now Claire Wright, thought our party needed to be dragged into the modern era. She was determined that we should change things. And so was born the Campaign for Women, chaired by Sally Hamwee. Backed by the leader, and some money, people worked their socks off with much training and mentoring.\n\nIn the 1994 Euro elections, where I was vice chair of the campaign (put in there hurriedly when it was noticed that the whole election team was male), we realised that in our 10 potentially winnable seats, 8 had already selected men.\n\nSo I with other members of WLD and the Campaign for Women called every single member in the next key Euro constituency selecting, and said you are selecting not just for this constituency, but for our national team. There are able women on the shortlist, please consider a woman. “Oh” they said, “I didn’t know. Of course we will consider that.” No push-back at all, open-minded. And an able young woman was selected.\n\nNeedless to say we won only the top two seats – and two wonderful but completely male MEPs were duly elected. Graham and Robin. Our labour-intensive efforts had come to nought.\n\nAnd after a few years, the Campaign for Women was quietly abandoned – it merged with WLD.\n\nAs we moved towards 1997, and Labour came up with the wonderful proposal of half their seats having women-only shortlists, and there was blood on their carpet, I envied the fact that they had managed to get that through.\n\nI then saw the difference the new Labour women made to the Commons. They started to transform the place. What is more, they brought change not only through better gender balance, but also a far wider diversity among all candidates – BAME, LGBT, those with disabilities. And then they dragged the Tories after them. The Tories, now way ahead of us in diversity.\n\nSo when we had PR for Europe, and it was pointed out we could have zipping – one region headed by a woman, one by a man, and so on down the list, I was extremely keen that we did that. There was great resistance, as well as key people who helped. We had one lot of legal advice that said we couldn’t, but we went out and got legal advice from Cherie Booth, and she showed that we could. And we did. (Later the Equality Act of 2010 has made all of this not only easier, but opens us to legal challenge if we are not addressing equality in a more effective manner. Bear that in mind.)\n\nThe result in those Euro elections of 1999 was for me a total joy. We elected 10 MEPs, five women, and five men.\n\nFinally we had broken through.\n\nSo in the early 2000s, we had that debate at conference about all women shortlists for Westminster. And on one side was Shirley Williams saying we simply must do this, saying she had fought for equal participation throughout her life, and it had not been achieved, here or round the world. And on the other side was Jo Swinson, in a pink t-shirt, saying she was not going to be a token woman.\n\nWhen that motion went down, I along with many others felt distraught. It certainly seemed a terrible lost opportunity. And of course for our current 8 MPs, half were elected after this vote.\n\nAnd what people said was we need to mentor, train etc, and then we will change things. And Jo found herself heading the new organisation, Campaign for Gender Balance. And she and others worked their socks off, training, mentoring, and seeking to get women selected.\n\nBut it did not change our party, and in due course the Campaign for Gender Balance merged with WLD to form Lib Dem Women, which was determined that we would finally break through….\n\nAnd in the last Parliament, the Leadership Programme was set up, and people worked their socks off, training, mentoring, and getting women into seats where MPs were standing down.\n\nBut after that, of course, most of the parliamentary party was swept away, and we have just eight white male MPs.\n\nSo here am I, yet again. I who joined a new party all those years ago partly because it stood for equal participation of both women and men, who stood for parliament hoping that I could make a difference, who then balanced full time work and three small children, and now see those three children grown up. And when the tide was low in our party’s fortunes, because we had not made sure that at every level we had women candidates, we ended up with no women at all.\n\nWhich is why the decision in Scotland that they are changing the way they will do things in the future – passed by 75:25 – makes me proud once again to be a Lib Dem. And I hugely commend Jo for her bravery in changing her mind, explaining why she now supports All Women Shortlists.\n\nPerhaps then I have should have some hope that finally, finally we will actually do something that helps to flatten that playing field and really ensure that it is merit that gets people elected. After all it is clear that merit is simply not prevailing: I am sure none in our party would maintain that half the population does not have that merit, or that BAME people don’t, or that LGBT people don’t, or that those with disabilities don’t. And if we accept that merit alone is insufficient – and it surely can’t be if our Commons party is white men only – then we have to take action which makes the difference.\n\nI will wait until the vote has gone through conference, and then I tear down to London, and I will fly to New York, to attend as a British Parliamentarian the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women. I hope that I will carry with me the wonderful warm glow that we have at last done something to improve the status of women and all those who have thus far been disadvantaged in the Lib Dems.\n\n* Lindsay Northover was Parliamentary Under Secretary of State at the Department for International Development, 2014-15, and is Liberal Democrats Spokesperson on International Development in the House of Lords."
