Buildings and addresses

There is an active proposal to import Cadastre buildings and addresses.

Street names

Almost completed in 2013 using Cadastre data. There is a project to verify street names in OSM, checking that they all have a name and that it is correct. Collect information on the ground and tag your changesets with the comment "#1calle1nombre <name of the place>".

It is necessary to collect information from some municipalities. In the pages of the municipalities where the import of buildings will start, you will find additional information.
