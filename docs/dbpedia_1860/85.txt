Street names

Almost completed in 2013 using Cadastre and on the ground data. There is a project to verify street names in OSM, checking that they all have a name and that it is correct. Collect information on the ground and tag your changesets with the comment "#1calle1nombre <name of the place>".

It is necessary to collect information from the areas where the import of addresses will begin soon.
