        "text": "By the time I reached the southernmost destination on my railroad trip through Portugal, I was an expert on the country’s trains and train stations. Hence, I intended to guide myself through this glorious city of Lisbon along the route of the legendary tram No 28.\n\nArrival in Lisbon\n\nBeing such a flatlander from Hamburg, I wasn’t really prepared for Portuguese cities to be so very hilly. That makes them beautiful and grants their visitors stunning views. However, for the arriving passenger, it’s quite a challenge.\n\nArriving from Coimbra at Lisbon’s Santa Apolónia station, I checked google maps for the way to my accommodation. I got the information it was a bit over a kilometer, less than a mile. Hence, no problem, I would walk this short distance.\n\nWhat the app withheld was that it was a bit over a kilometer uphill. Partly on steep cobblestone alleys, partly on stairs. Even less than a mile uphill on alleys and stairs becomes pretty far. Especially if you are dragging a suitcase on far too small wheels behind.\n\nSo I was a heavily sweating mess as I arrived at the apartment and knocked at the neighbor’s door for the key.\n\nYes, correct, I stayed at an apartment. Nope, not the Airbnb kind. It was a small room on street level. I technically lived on the alley.\n\nModest Shelter\n\nHowever, it was equipped with most things a visitor might need. Obviously, there was a bed – from IKEA, foldable. Also a table and three chairs – not IKEA, but still foldable. A kitchenette, consisting of two hot plates, a microwave, a sink, and all the necessary accessories. There was even a washing machine, which was irritating since there was no closet. I wonder why they rather put a washing machine in such a small room than a closet. Especially since there was hardly space to hang your freshly washed laundry.\n\nMaybe washing machines were on sale.\n\nThere was no TV. I didn’t need a TV, but since there was no internet access, either. However, people without a good old-fashioned book might get pretty bored.\n\nOr they’ll entertain each other by fighting.\n\nIf I had stayed there with another person, we probably would have fought. It was a small room with not much to do, after all.\n\nLocation Location Location\n\nNevertheless, the apartment was in an incredible location: In a narrow alley within the castle wall!\n\nTourists were passing right in front of my cobblestone alley-level door. There was neither an aircon nor a fan in the room. And since I left the door window open for fresh air, every single one of those tourists peeped into my room.\n\nI didn’t blame them, that’s something you automatically do. They probably took me for a Portuguese bohemian.\n\nI bet some of them were pretty jealous because of my million-dollar location.\n\nI was staying right next to the castle, after all!\n\nWithin the castle walls!\n\nDid I feel like a queen?\n\nNope, not on twenty square meters without a TV and without Wifi.\n\nRather like the queen’s washing woman living close by to be available at any time; I had a washing machine, after all.\n\nDid I like staying at the posh, comfortable places in Porto and Figueira da Foz?\n\nYes.\n\nDid I like staying at a rather run-down one-room apartment at the Castelo, doing my own grocery shopping feeling like a true-born Portuguese?\n\nYES!\n\nShowing You Around in Lisbon\n\nIt’s like they say: Home is where the heart is. And I know that Lisbon occupies a big piece of my heart now. Actually, it’s definitely my second favorite city in Europe. The all-time favorite is Venice, just so you know.\n\nSince according to this charming saying this is sort of my home now, let me show you around a bit. This way, you’ll understand why it took Lisbon less than 24 hours to make it to my all-time favorite list of cities.\n\nTram No 28\n\nGuys, I’m sorry, I know I’m not original in guiding you through Lisbon along the iconic line of tram No 28. However, this route is just too perfect.\n\nIt would be more original and unique to send you to Lisbon’s satellite town and impoverished outskirts. Or to the business district around Parque das Nações. But those look like any other business district around the globe – besides the really cool Oceanário, the aquarium.\n\nStill, the nicest places and most interesting attractions are located along the #28’s route and that’s how we travel. Nevertheless, I promise you some additional detours.\n\nAlthough a major touristy means of transport – and a tourist attraction in itself – the tram #28 still is a public cable car in Lisbon. Only that hardly any locals take it since it’s always packed and infamous for attracting pickpockets.\n\nSo if you take it, look a bit after your belongings. Also, try to hop on at one of the final stops which are either Martim Moniz downtown or Campo Ourique in the west to get the best seats. Or seats at all.\n\nTake A Seat\n\nHowever, I have to warn you: You will keep your nice seat only if you stay on the tram during the entire tour. If you use it as a hop-on-hop-off option, you probably have to stand from the first time you come back on board. The train fills up pretty quickly and seats are very limited.\n\nIf you have a ticket for the day – either the 24-hour metro ticket or the LisboaCard – I’d suggest you do the entire route once without getting off and do the hop-on-hop-off thing another time, e.g. on your way back.\n\nPraça Dom Pedro IV – Rossio\n\nBefore getting on the train, let’s look around the Praça Dom Pedro IV a bit, aka Rossio. In the northwest corner is the grandiose building housing the Rossio train station where the trains to Sintra are leaving from.\n\nThe station was built in the late 19th century in a Neo-Manueline style. I find it’s one of the most striking buildings in Lisbon.\n\nNext to the station on the northern side of the Dom Pedro IV square is the Teatro Nacional Dona Maria II – adjacent to the Largo São Domingos.\n\nSão Domingo\n\nHere, the São Domingos church is worth a visit. This house of worship was built mid of the 13th century, but that’s not the reason why it deems a bit windblown. Actually, it should be called the Phoenix church since it resurrected from various damages caused by both nature and men – such as earthquakes and fires.\n\nAt the end of the Travessa Nova de São Domingos turn left into the Rua da Palma where you can get on tram #28.\n\nAlfama\n\nIt carries you around the Graça neighborhood and takes you to the Alfama district overlooking the Rio Tejo. Alfama – architectonically influenced by the Moorish – is the home of ordinary folks, very colorful and charming with lots of narrow alleys – and due to its elevated location, it grants grandiose views of the city and the river alike.\n\nSão Vicente\n\nSoon, the tram stops at the Praça de São Vicente. Here you cannot only see the Monastery of São Vicente de Fora, but you also enjoy some of the best views of Lisbon and the river Tejo.\n\nIf you feel like walking – to be precise: climbing – you can walk up the Rua de São Vicente up to Largo Rodrigues Freitas and enter one of Lisbon’s most visited attractions, the Castelo de São Jorge.\n\nSão Jorge\n\nThe Castelo de São Jorge complex is a medieval citadel, consisting of the castle, ruins of the former Royal Palace, and the adjacent former elite’s neighborhood. Built by the Moors in the 11th century, it functioned as a defensive stronghold for the citadel’s inhabitants such as the Moorish governor and his entourage.\n\nThe fort can be visited daily from 9 a. m. to 6 p. m. from November to February and from 9 a. m. to 9 p. m. from March to October. Tickets are €uro 8,50 resp. €uro 5 for students under 25 and €uro 20 for families.\n\nI suggest you don’t visit only the Castelo itself, but venture a little bit through the adjacent alleys to get a feel for the true Portuguese life.\n\nTo continue our tour, you don’t need to take the tram to the next stop since it’s only one block down – literally down, so be a bit careful not to slip.\n\nSanta Luzia\n\nOne of the most famous Miradouros, Lisbon’s many outlooks, is the square in front of the Igreja de Santa Luzia. I’m afraid that hardly anyone visits the church, that, after all, dates back to the 12th century – everybody is too distracted by the views from the courtyard.\n\nAcross from the church is Lisbon’s arts and crafts museum, the Museu de Artes Decorativas. It houses paintings, textiles, ceramics, and more from the 15th to the 20th century.\n\nIf you aren’t a total aficionado, you get to see so many of these all over Lisbon – and all of Portugal – that I’m not sure if it’s worth visiting this museum. But if you choose to go, here are the details:\n\nMuseu de Artes Decorativas Portuguesas\n\nRua de S. Tomé 90\n\n1100-564 Lisboa\n\nPhone: + 351 – 21 881 46 00\n\nEmail: geral@fress.pt\n\nBaixa\n\nNow you should definitely get back on the train since from here to the next stop, it’s a crazy ride downhill. The tram gets so close to the houses that you might touch them – but don’t, it’s not safe to stick your head or arms out of the windows.\n\nAt the Sé de Lisboa, the Lisbon Cathedral, the tram turns with squealing wheels ’round the corner.\n\nHere you can visit Lisbon’s oldest church which houses also the see of the Archdiocese. Since its foundation in the year 1147, the building has been modified several times so that it flashes a mix of Romanesque, Gothic, and Baroque architectural elements.\n\nSanto António\n\nOne block down from the Cathedral stands the beautiful Baroque Igreja de Santo António, built in the 18th century; in comparison with all the other medieval churches in Portugal, it’s practically a hyper-modern building. It’s said that the Santo António Church marks Saint Anthony’s birthplace.\n\nAfter the tram crosses a couple of commercial streets, it reaches Lisbon’s most important square, the Praça do Comércio.\n\nPraça do Comércio\n\nThis square was remodeled after the big earthquake in the 18th century. Designed as a rectangular square, it opens in the shape of a U towards the river Tejo. One of its most impressive buildings is the Arco da Rua Augusta, an arch that was finished only in the 19th century. It opens to the Rua Augusta shopping street.\n\nMake an investment of 2,50 €uro and you won’t regret it – I find the monument’s terrace grants Lisbon’s best views.\n\nNot only for the view from the arch, but also for the views of the arch, i. e. the statues on the top, I recommend getting up there. Don’t worry, you don’t have to climb, there is a lift.\n\nRua Augusta\n\nA stroll along the Rua Augusta is…basically like a stroll along any shopping street in Europe.\n\nIt’s still worth it, if only for the Elevador de Santa Justa, aka Elevador do Carmo. This elevator connects the Baixa neighborhood with the bohemian Chiado. This lift, that – you guessed so: lifts passengers 8 meters up, was built at the turn of the 20th century according to the design of Raoul Mesnier de Ponsard, a scholar of Gustave Eiffel.\n\nChiado\n\nThe Elevador de Santa Justa is one of the possibilities to get up to the bohemian and hip Chiado neighborhood – and it’s the most crowded one, people wait up to an hour.\n\nObviously, you can also climb streets’n’stairs. Or you hop back on the tram and let it carry you up there. For instance, to the Museu do Chiado. I will not lie to you: This gallery is more interesting because of its architecture by Jean-Michel Wilmotte. This French architect remodeled the former São Francisco da Cidade monastery in a very plain and minimalist style.\n\nMuseu Nacional de Arte Contemporânea do Chiado\n\nRua Serpa Pinto 4 | Rua Capelo 13\n\n1200-444 Lisbon\n\nPhone: + 351 – 213 432 148\n\nEmail: museuchiado@mnac.dgpc.pt\n\nOpening hours are Tuesday to Sunday from 10 a. m. to 6 p. m.\n\nEspecially here in hilly Chiado, you’ll be grateful that you don’t have to walk but that the #28 carries you comfortably to the most scenic places – like e. g. the Largo do Chiado, a busy yet very beautiful square with lots of cafés and snack bars, the Teatro São Carlos – and literally three churches.\n\nLargo do Chiado\n\nI’m not sure, but I have the impression that Portugal has the highest number of churches I’ve ever seen:\n\nAround the Largo do Chiado, you’ll find the Igreja de Nossa Senhora do Loreto aka Igreja dos Italianos in the north, the Igreja de Nossa Senhora da Encarnação across the square in the south, and one block further east the Basílica de Nossa Senhora dos Mártires – all three of them built in the 18th century in Baroque style.\n\nThree blocks farther, don’t miss to look left towards the river: You’ll see the steep Rua da Bica de Duarte Belcio. On this street, the Elevador da Bica runs over 260 meters, connecting the Rua de São Paulo and the Largo do Calhariz. This funicular was constructed by Portuguese Raoul Mesnier du Ponsard and inaugurated in 1892.\n\nAbout one kilometer further west, to your right you spot the Palácio de São Bento, the Palace of Saint Benedict which is home to the National Assembly, i. e. the Portuguese parliament. Adjacent to it is the official residence of Portugal’s Prime Minister – basically Rua Downing 10….\n\nEstrela\n\nOnly about four blocks further is the Basilica da Estrela – of course, Baroque, but also a bit Neo-Classicist – to your left and the Jardim da Estrela to your right. This is my favorite park in Lisbon since it’s just so pretty and serene. They have a nice café there, too, so it’s the perfect place to just relax from all that sightseeing.\n\nSo, you guys, we’ve almost reached the final stop – which ironically is a cemetery. Before we get to the station Campo de Orique – or Prazeres, which is the graveyard’s name – I’d like to point out the Igreja do Santo Condestável, the Church of the Holy Constable, which was built in a Neo-Gothic style.\n\nPrazeres\n\nOnce you get to the Prazeres cemetery, by the way, Prazeres means pleasure – I have no clue who came up with this cute name for a graveyard, you have to get off the tram even if you want to take the same train back. Everybody has to get off and then stand in line about twenty feet further to get on again.\n\nSince you have to get off, anyway, you might want to take a stroll through the cemetery and look at some of these beautifully carved tombstones.\n\nSo now would be the moment to take the tram back downtown – either for a joy ride just watching beautiful Lisbon passing by – or adding a couple of stops at some of the most alluring places.\n\nSo riding the tram #28 is cute and fun and not exclusively touristy – and since at the last stop, everybody has to get off – to possibly get on again about five steps further and five minutes later, they mix things up a little and everybody has a new chance getting a good seat.\n\nAmoreiras\n\nWhat you can also do is either walk up north to the Amoreiras neighborhood – which would be about 1.5 kilometers – or go there by bus #774 – five stops towards Gomes Freire, getting off at Amoreiras.\n\nAs you get off in front of the Amoreiras Shopping Center, you might want to get up to the open-air platform on the roof to enjoy a 360°-view of Lisbon.\n\nA ten-minute walk east of the mall is another nice and peaceful park, the Parque das Amoreiras, named after the mulberry trees that Marquês de Pombal planted here. Apart from the mulberries, there are also many other trees like even ginkgo and banana trees.\n\nMãe d’Água das Amoreiras\n\nBeneath one of the arches of the aqueducts close to the Mãe d’Água das Amoreiras reservoir stands the Capela de Nossa Senhora de Monserrate. And once you’re here: The Mãe d’Água das Amoreiras reservoir is totally worth a visit.\n\nReservatório da Mãe d’Água das Amoreiras\n\nPraça das Amoreiras 10\n\n1250-020 Lisboa\n\nPhone: + 351 – 21 – 810 02 62\n\nOpening hours are Tuesday to Saturday from 10 a. m. to 12.30 p. m. and 1.30 p. m. to 5.30 p. m.\n\nNot only did Mr. Marquês de Pombal plant mulberry trees, he also was an important statesman in the 18th century, hence they named a square after him, the Praça Marquês de Pombal. From here you can either walk back south towards the city center or choose to go north to the Parque Eduardo VII, Lisbon’s largest and most manicured public garden.\n\nRigo\n\nTo get to the last stop of this extended city tour, you can take the metro on the east side of the park, cleverly called Parque. From there, continue to Praça de Espanha station. Now it’s just a very short walk to the Museu Calouste Gulbenkian and Centro de Arte Moderna complex.\n\nMr. Calouste Gulbenkian was born in 1869 in Constantinople, hence, today’s Istanbul, and educated in Marseille, London, and Baku. He was a clever and successful businessman, active not only in Europe, but also i. a. in Iraq, South Africa, and Australia. He acquired British citizenship, lived in Paris, and finally moved to Lisbon where he died in 1955 leaving an incredible fortune – both in France and Portugal. Therefore long negotiations took place before all the personal art treasures could be sent to Portugal and are now on display at the museum’s Founder’s Collection.\n\nCalouste Gulbenkian Museum\n\nAvenida de Berna 45A\n\n1067-001 Lisbon\n\nPhone: + 351 – 217 – 823 000\n\nEmail: info@gulbenkian.pt\n\nOpening hours are Wednesday to Monday 10 a. m. to 6 p. m.\n\nPractical Information\n\nHow to Get There\n\nBy Plane\n\nUnlike many other European capital cities, Lisbon has only one airport. Therefore, it is served by regular and low-cost airlines alike. The airport is conveniently located 7 short kilometers north of Lisbon’s center.\n\nTo get downtown, you can take Aerobus Line 1 straight to Rossio station.\n\nHowever, if you are planning on using public transportation the same day, you better get the Via Viagem for € 6,60. Then you can take the metro from the airport to Alameda station. There you change to the green line down to Rossio station.\n\nBy Train\n\nThere are three major train stations in Lisbon.\n\nFirstly, Santa Apolónia, the oldest railway station, but the most important train station for long-distance travel. Secondly, Estação de Caminhos de Ferro do Rossio – short Rossio. This is the most centrally located one. From here, trains are leaving for instance to Sintra.\n\nGoing by train up the Atlantic coast to Estoril, Cascais, or only to Belém, you hop on the train at the train station Cais do Sodré, west of the city center.\n\nBy Bus\n\nIf you travel by long-distance bus Rede Expressos or one of its subsidiaries, you’ll arrive in Lisbon at the terminal Sete Rios about 4 kilometers north from the historic city center. From here, you can take the blue metro line.\n\nHowever, all other intercity and international buses depart from the Estação do Oriente.\n\nHow to Get Around\n\nIf you need just a ticket without any further perks, the Via Viagem card is your best option. For 24 hours of unlimited rides on public transport – the airport is included – you pay only € 6,60.\n\nA day ticket that takes you all the way to Sintra and Cascais, sets you back € 10,70.\n\nAn even better deal is the LisboaCard that does not only grant you free travel on public transport – even all the way to Sintra and Cascais. There are also many discounts and even free entries to museums, attractions, shops, restaurants, and much more included.\n\nYou can order the LisboaCard online: You get a voucher that you exchange upon arrival e.g. at the airport or the tourist office.\n\nSince ordering the card online is a bit more pricey (although it’s less than a €uro) and you cannot use the voucher but have to exchange it first, I really don’t see the point in buying the card online.\n\nWhere to Sleep\n\nObviously, there are many accommodations to choose from. Since my experience with booking.com* has always been pleasant, you might want to pick one of their offers:\n\nBooking.com\n\nWhere to Eat\n\nObviously, there are all sorts of eateries all over Lisbon. You won’t be starving.\n\nHowever, I’d like to introduce two of my favorite restaurants that are a bit different.\n\nPadaria do Povo\n\nFirstly, there is the really original, bohemian place, the Padaria do Povo.\n\nIn 1904, the Padaria do Povo – which translates to People’s Bakery – was founded to offer cheaper bread in the parishes of Santa Isabel and Campolide.\n\nThen, in 1919, António Ferreira de Macedo and Bento de Jesus Caraça founded the Universidade Popular Portuguesa, an institution of public education. The University became a tenant of the Bakery.\n\nToday, this traditional institution is a mix of a community center, a cultural center, a coffee bar, and a restaurant.\n\nAlbeit, it’s no bakery anymore.\n\nSo, anyway, if you are keen to experience an eatery totally off the beaten tourist tracks, treat yourself to a meal and a drink – and maybe some new Portuguese friends.\n\nPadaria do Povo\n\nRua Luís Derouet, 20-A\n\n1250-153 Lisboa\n\nPhone: + 351 – 21 – 362 04 64\n\nThe Padaria is open Monday to Friday from 12 p. m. to 1 a. m. (Friday 2 a. m.), Weekends 3 p. m. to 1 a. m. (Sunday 2 a. m.)\n\nLoja das Conservas\n\nThe other place I’m recommending is right in the city center. It’s a place where you can enjoy really good food and maybe stock up on some cute souvenirs.\n\nWhat I like about their restaurant is the love for details. They serve their artisan food – Portuguese with a creative crossover twist – on beautifully decorated dishes. Everything is just a little…special.\n\nAnother great thing is that there is a shop connected right to this really fine restaurant. So, with your full stomach, you can pick out some delicious gifts for your loved ones back home who didn’t have the privilege to visit Lisbon.\n\nLoja das Conservas\n\nRua Assunção 83\n\n1100-043 Lisboa\n\nPhone: + 351 – 913 552 984\n\nOpen Monday to Saturday from noon.\n\nWhat to See\n\nI’m an avid solo-travelling woman. Since solo-travel doesn’t equal solitude, I love to join organized tours here and there. Also, to make the most of your trip to Lisbon especially if you have a limited amount of time, you might want to make some reservations ahead. So here are some ideas of what to do and how to visit Lisbon in a safe and easy way*:\n\nMoney\n\nUntil now, 20 European countries replaced their former local currency with the €uro starting in 2002. Obviously, Portugal is one of them. The exchange rate is 1 US$ = 0.94 EUR as of June 2023. However, you can check today’s conversion rate on this page.\n\nCards are accepted basically everywhere. Except, of course, at the small stands on the streets and at the market.\n\nLanguage\n\nActually, many Portuguese have a great command of the English language. However, it’s always nice to be able to say at least some pleasantries in the local language so you might want to pick up some words e. g. online with babbel.com.\n\nThe first lesson, which already covers all the hellos and thank yous, is even free.\n\nLisbon was only the last of many beautiful places I’ve visited in Portugal. To read about the others, go to the main post and take your pick! There you’ll also find valuable general information that will make your trip smoother.\n\nPinnable Pictures\n\nIf you choose to pin this post for later, please use one of these pictures:\n\nNote: I’m completing, editing, and updating this post regularly – last in June 2023.\n\nDid You Enjoy This Post?
