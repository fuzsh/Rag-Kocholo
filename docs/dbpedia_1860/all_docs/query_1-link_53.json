        "text": "Situated on the Iberian Peninsula of Europe, Spain has GPS coordinates of 40.4637° N and 3.7492° W. As a country in the northern hemisphere, Spain is north of the equator. Spain is also in the western hemisphere.\n\nSpain’s Most Extreme Points\n\nSpain’s northernmost point has a latitudinal coordinate of 43º47' N. This point is in the Spanish community of Galicia on the Iberian Peninsula. This point is the exact location of Punta de Estaca de Bares, which is an area in Spain that also happens to be the northernmost point of the entire Iberian Peninsula.\n\nWhen it comes to the most extreme point of Spain to the south, there are two possible answers. It depends on whether smaller surrounding islands are being taken into consideration. Looking solely at the mainland of Spain, the southernmost point of Spain is situated at a latitude of 36°00' N. This point is located in Punta de Tarifa, in the Spanish province, Cádiz. Offshore, the most southern part of Spain is located in the Canary Islands. The capital city of El Hierro Island is Santa Cruz de Tenerife, and with a coordinate of 27°38' N, it is the most extreme point of Spain, islands and all.\n\nThe easternmost point of Spain is similar to the southernmost point in that there are two different points of extremity in the south. With a longitude of 3°19' E, the point of extremity on the mainland is on the peninsula of Cap de Creus. The offshore point of extremity in the south of Spain is on the island of La Mola. With a longitude of 4°19' E, this southern point is in the Mahón municipality.\n\nThere are two westernmost points of Spain as well. Off the coast of Spain’s mainland, the country extends as far as 18°09' W. This coordinate is situated on the island of Punta de la Orchilla, which is part of a larger archipelago known as the Canary Islands. On the mainland, Spain’s furthest point in the west is a peninsula by the name of Cabo Touriñán. This locale has a longitude of 9°18' W.\n\nArea, Population, and Density Values\n\nSpain’s population is currently hovering around 46,418,510 people. Spain has seen a sudden drop in population over the past decade. In 2015 and 2016, the country experienced a decline in the overall population. It wasn’t until 2017 that more and more people moved to Spain, but even then, the population was lower than it had been in 2013."
