We have no information as to whether it is valid and what flights it receives or sends.\n\nSanta Cruz De Tenerife: weather forecast\n\nThe weather forecast is shown in local time in Santa Cruz De Tenerife\n\nTODAY\n\n19:00\n\n27.5°C\n\n20km/h\n\nfeels like 28.7°C, Clouds (scattered clouds: 25-50%)\n\nhumidity: 60%, clouds: 33%\n\n22:00\n\n24.8°C\n\n15km/h\n\nfeels like 25.0°C, Clouds (scattered clouds: 25-50%)\n\nhumidity: 67%, clouds: 28%\n\nAUGUST 12\n\n01:00\n\n24.9°C\n\n18km/h\n\nfeels like 25.2°C, Clouds (scattered clouds: 25-50%)\n\nhumidity: 66%, clouds: 32%\n\n04:00\n\n24.8°C\n\n19km/h\n\nfeels like 25.1°C, Clouds (few clouds: 11-25%)\n\nhumidity: 65%, clouds: 20%\n\n07:00\n\n25.2°C\n\n18km/h\n\nfeels like 25.3°C, Clouds (few clouds: 11-25%)\n\nhumidity: 56%, clouds: 17%\n\n10:00\n\n27.6°C\n\n22km/h\n\nfeels like 28.4°C, Clouds (scattered clouds: 25-50%)\n\nhumidity: 54%, clouds: 36%\n\n13:00\n\n29.5°C\n\n25km/h\n\nfeels like 31.0°C, Clouds (scattered clouds: 25-50%)\n\nhumidity: 55%, clouds: 46%\n\n16:00\n\n29.1°C\n\n25km/h\n\nfeels like 30.7°C, Clouds (broken clouds: 51-84%)\n\nhumidity: 57%, clouds: 61%\n\n19:00\n\n28.4°C\n\n21km/h\n\nfeels like 29.6°C, Clouds (broken clouds: 51-84%)\n\nhumidity: 57%, clouds: 78%\n\n22:00\n\n26.6°C\n\n20km/h\n\nfeels like 26.6°C, Clouds (broken clouds: 51-84%)\n\nhumidity: 59%, clouds: 67%\n\nAUGUST 13\n\n01:00\n\n26.3°C\n\n20km/h\n\nfeels like 26.3°C, Clouds (scattered clouds: 25-50%)\n\nhumidity: 59%, clouds: 39%\n\n04:00\n\n25.8°C\n\n19km/h\n\nfeels like 26.0°C, Clouds (few clouds: 11-25%)\n\nhumidity: 60%, clouds: 12%\n\n07:00\n\n25.5°C\n\n16km/h\n\nfeels like 25.6°C, Clouds (few clouds: 11-25%)\n\nhumidity: 58%, clouds: 16%\n\n10:00\n\n27.5°C\n\n21km/h\n\nfeels like 28.2°C, Clear (clear sky)\n\nhumidity: 54%, clouds: 8%\n\n13:00\n\n29.9°C\n\n26km/h\n\nfeels like 30.7°C, Clouds (scattered clouds: 25-50%)\n\nhumidity: 49%, clouds: 27%\n\n16:00\n\n29.2°C\n\n28km/h\n\nfeels like 30.6°C, Clouds (broken clouds: 51-84%)\n\nhumidity: 55%, clouds: 78%\n\n19:00\n\n28.4°C\n\n22km/h\n\nfeels like 29.2°C, Clouds (broken clouds: 51-84%)\n\nhumidity: 53%, clouds: 65%\n\n22:00\n\n26.5°C\n\n20km/h\n\nfeels like 26.5°C, Clouds (few clouds: 11-25%)\n\nhumidity: 59%, clouds: 17%\n\nAUGUST 14\n\n01:00\n\n25.7°C\n\n22km/h\n\nfeels like 25.9°C, Clouds (few clouds: 11-25%)\n\nhumidity: 62%, clouds: 16%\n\n04:00\n\n25.4°C\n\n23km/h\n\nfeels like 25.7°C, Clouds (few clouds: 11-25%)\n\nhumidity: 62%, clouds: 13%\n\n07:00\n\n24.7°C\n\n21km/h\n\nfeels like 24.9°C, Clouds (few clouds: 11-25%)\n\nhumidity: 63%, clouds: 12%\n\n10:00\n\n26.4°C\n\n23km/h\n\nfeels like 26.4°C, Clear (clear sky)\n\nhumidity: 59%, clouds: 8%\n\n13:00\n\n28.0°C\n\n27km/h\n\nfeels like 29.0°C, Clear (clear sky)\n\nhumidity: 55%, clouds: 7%\n\n16:00\n\n27.2°C\n\n32km/h\n\nfeels like 28.3°C, Clear (clear sky)\n\nhumidity: 59%, clouds: 10%\n\n19:00\n\n26.2°C\n\n27km/h\n\nfeels like 26.2°C, Clouds (few clouds: 11-25%)\n\nhumidity: 64%, clouds: 11%\n\n22:00\n\n24.0°C\n\n20km/h\n\nfeels like 24.2°C, Clear (clear sky)\n\nhumidity: 69%, clouds: 10%\n\nAUGUST 15\n\n01:00\n\n23.8°C\n\n21km/h\n\nfeels like 23.8°C, Clear (clear sky)\n\nhumidity: 60%, clouds: 7%\n\n04:00\n\n22.6°C\n\n22km/h\n\nfeels like 23.1°C, Clouds (scattered clouds: 25-50%)\n\nhumidity: 84%, clouds: 30%\n\n07:00\n\n22.4°C\n\n23km/h\n\nfeels like 22.8°C, Clouds (scattered clouds: 25-50%)\n\nhumidity: 77%, clouds: 30%\n\n10:00\n\n25.3°C\n\n22km/h\n\nfeels like 25.3°C, Clouds (few clouds: 11-25%)\n\nhumidity: 56%, clouds: 21%\n\n13:00\n\n26.6°C\n\n29km/h\n\nfeels like 26.6°C, Clouds (scattered clouds: 25-50%)\n\nhumidity: 57%, clouds: 29%\n\n16:00\n\n27.0°C\n\n29km/h\n\nfeels like 27.8°C, Clouds (scattered clouds: 25-50%)\n\nhumidity: 56%, clouds: 37%\n\n19:00\n\n25.7°C\n\n27km/h\n\nfeels like 25.8°C, Clouds (scattered clouds: 25-50%)\n\nhumidity: 57%, clouds: 36%\n\n22:00\n\n23.8°C\n\n17km/h\n\nfeels like 23.9°C, Clouds (scattered clouds: 25-50%)\n\nhumidity: 63%, clouds: 32%\n\nAUGUST 16\n\n01:00\n\n23.7°C\n\n19km/h\n\nfeels like 23.6°C, Clouds (scattered clouds: 25-50%)\n\nhumidity: 57%, clouds: 28%\n\n04:00\n\n22.9°C\n\n17km/h\n\nfeels like 22.9°C, Clouds (scattered clouds: 25-50%)\n\nhumidity: 60%, clouds: 34%\n\nPuntillo del Sol, Spain | © Heinz Penzendorfer\n\nFind out the temperature of sea water in more than 12000 cities and resorts around the world. Water surface temperature values are available in real time. There is a forecast of water temperature changes for the next few days, as well as historical data of sea surface temperature are available for all days of the last years.\n\nWe use data from various sources, including National Centers for Environmental Information (NOAA), meteorological services of different countries, data received from more than a thousand buoys around the world, satellite systems for scanning the surface of the oceans and seas.\n\nAll supported languages:"
