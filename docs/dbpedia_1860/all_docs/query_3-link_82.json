        "meta_description": "Abstract This study examines 30 years of atmospheric extinction, τ, obtained from both stellar and solar telescope measurements, at ~2.4 km MSL, from the North Atlantic Canary Archipelago—an island chain located at approximately 28°N, around 100 km from the west coast of Africa. Data from three AERONET monitors, located at varying heights on one of the main islands, were also used, although these are only available over a shorter (<10 yr) period. The Canary Archipelago is regularly affected by dust intrusions into the local atmosphere as they intersect one of the primary export pathways of mineral dust from the Sahara. The τ of “baseline” and “dust influenced” conditions were statistically distinguished by fitting normal-gamma mixture distributions to the observations using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, and then the seasonal and long-term characteristics of these data were examined. The telescope data show that baseline conditions are usually stable at τ < 0.1 (except during periods influenced by volcanic aerosols) and indicate the existence of a low-amplitude () seasonal variation. During dust-influenced conditions, τ regularly reaches values of a factor of 2–6 times higher than normal. The majority of dust intrusions take place during the months of July and August, when they may occur 44 ± 15% of the time, predominantly at high altitudes (with ~94.3 ± 1.6% of intrusions occurring ≥ 2.4 km), whereas during the months of November–May, dust intrusions occur far less frequently (~19 ± 7%) and are more common at lower altitudes—with intrusions at <2.4 km comprising ~ 79.5 ± 3.2% of all outbreaks. Year-to-year variations in the frequency of dust-influenced conditions (of ~9%) were found but no long-term trend over the observed 30-yr period.",

        "text": "b. Mark-1 instrument\n\nThe Mark-1 instrument (a resonant scattering solar spectrophotometer) was designed to measure the radial velocity of the sun (Brookes et al. 1978). It uses monochromatic measurements of the intensity of sunlight at the blue and red wings of the neutral potassium (K I) line at 769.9 nm; further details can be found in Pallé et al. (1986) and Cortés and Pallé (2014) (data are available from http://www.spaceinn.eu/data-access/mark-i-data-archive/). Intensity is calculated via two distinct methods—using transmitted and scattered light; a value of τ may be derived from these data in the manner outlined below, which we illustrate with examples from 21 June 2001 (a boreal solstice date).\n\nDuring clear-sky daylight hours, intensity values of the sun (magnitude m) are recorded from both transmitted and scattered light. The average (μ) and standard deviation (σ) intensity values over 40-s time windows are recorded, along with the time of the observation and positional information of the sun (i.e., declination and ascension).\n\nBased on the coordinates of the observatory, the time of observation, and the positional information of the sun, the amount of atmosphere that the sunlight traveled through to reach the telescope is calculated [air mass (am)] from the formula of Hardie (1962)—the lowest airmass values are when the sun is at zenith. We have plotted the air mass along with the normalized magnitude of transmitted and scattered light for 21 June 2001 in Fig. 1.\n\nData are categorized into premeridian and postmeridian times: that is, the time during which the sun is rising, and the light passing through the atmosphere to the east of the Canary Islands (i.e., over the western Sahara) is separated from the time the sun is setting and passing through atmosphere to the west of the islands (i.e., over the North Atlantic Ocean).\n\nA linear regression is calculated from the am vs. μ intensity, weighted by the σ of the intensity values, for the premeridian and postmeridian data (Fig. 2).\n\nThe slope term of each linear regression ( ) is equivalent to τ. We note that these units may be converted to optical depth using a factor of (e.g., as in Finkbeiner 2003; Krügel 2009). We also calculate the standard error of the mean (SEM), , where N is the sample size of each premeridian and postmeridian group of intensity values. The SEM is used as a measure of the uncertainty for each τ value throughout this work.\n\nThere are several particulars of the data reduction that require further elaboration. The relationship between time and intensity is logarithmic, whereas the relationship between air mass and intensity is linear. Consequently, the majority of observations are made at low-airmass values (e.g., as seen for our examples of 21 June 2001, shown in Fig. 3). However, there are some points to consider regarding the processing of low-airmass data for our purposes (i.e., the creation of a consistent time series of τ). For measurements in scattered light, a bias exists in the data points at airmass values, am < 1.25. This is visible in Fig. 1 as a deviation in the behavior of the scattered data from the transmitted values at low am values; the reason for this is explained in Cortés and Pallé (2014). However, for our purposes, low-airmass values are relatively unimportant as it is light that has traveled along longer paths and that has had greater opportunity to encounter absorbing and scattering aerosols that can give us the most information about the earth’s atmosphere. Ironically, this is the opposite of the requirements of astrophysicists, who would seek to discard data at high-airmass values for the very reason of atmospheric interference. In addition to the bias at low am values in scattered light, there is further consideration: the lowest am values change seasonally (Fig. 4)—this seasonality results from the change in the sun’s zenith angle—which could produce an artificial seasonality in the τ values. Consequently, the lowest am values we use to calculate daily τ values are above the seasonal variation, am >1.62 (this is the reason for the removal of lower am values, apparent in Fig. 2).\n\nc. AERONET\n\nThe aerosol optical depth ( ), the degree to which aerosols prevent the transmission of light, of a specified wavelength, along a given path by the absorption and scattering, is a quantity calculated from the sun photometer data of AERONET. They measure a range of wavelengths that have been shown to be sensitive to mineral dust intrusions (e.g., Müller et al. 2003). Although consistent AERONET data are only available for the Canary Islands since 2004 (specifically the island of Tenerife), the short records they provide are useful as an independent verification to the telescope measurements. Additionally, because of the different altitudes of the AERONET stations, these data may also provide some indications regarding the characteristics of the altitude of mineral dust events—a factor known to be important in controlling the vertical heating of the local atmosphere (Westphal et al. 1987).\n\nThere are three AERONET instruments on the island of Tenerife, closely located horizontally, but with large differences in altitude. Specifically, the three sites are at Santa Cruz (28.473°N, −16.247°E; 52 m MSL; available since 18 July 2005), La Laguna (28.482°N, −16.321°E; 568 m MSL; available since 16 July 2006), and Mt. Teide (28.309°N, −16.499°E; 2391 m MSL; available since 26 June 2004). For this work we have used the level 2.0, daily summary, quality-assured data, at the 675-nm wavelength.\n\nThese stations require clear-sky conditions to operate. Because of the influences of topography and prevailing winds, there are strong microclimates over the island of Tenerife; consequently, there are large variations in the average number of observed (clear sky) days at each of the three AERONET sites as follows: Santa Cruz, 21.6 ± 0.8 days month−1; La Laguna, 18.9 ± 0.8 days month−1; and Mt. Teide, 24.1 ± 0.6 days month−1.\n\nThe relevance of satellite data\n\nSatellite data are highly useful in characterizing atmospheric mineral dust aerosols, particularly for the identification of key locations of mineral dust entrainment and large-scale dynamics (e.g., Moulin et al. 1998; Evan and Mukhopadhyay 2010). These data are invaluable as regions of key importance to mineral dust tend to be areas with limited surface-based measurements (Knippertz and Todd 2012). For many locations across the globe, such as deserts and ocean regions, satellites are the only reliable source of long-term (~30 yr) data. However, these data have significant limitations, particularly with respect to their long-term homogeneity. There are also significant limitations to the temporal and spatial sampling available, whereby the high-spatial resolution of polar-orbiting satellites is accompanied by a poor-temporal resolution (and vice versa for geostationary satellite instruments). As a result of these and additional issues—such as distinct view angles from ground-based instruments—a direct comparison between satellite measurements and the ground-based telescope data presented in this work is problematic.\n\nIndeed, poor agreement between in situ optical depth observations and satellite data have been reported in comparisons of atmospheric extinction from telescopes of the Canary Islands to corresponding satellite data from both the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI), and the Terra/Aqua Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) (Varela et al. 2008). The study found that the satellite data showed no linear agreement between the telescope and satellite data, but weak correlations were found during summertime measurements. Varela et al. (2008) concluded that this disagreement was largely due to the different viewing perspectives of the instruments. The authors also noted that local-scale climate factors played an important role in producing conditions at the observation site that were distinct from those of the wider area (estimated by the satellite instrument). Consequently, while satellite-based analysis of mineral dust aerosols is a critical avenue for advancement in our understanding of aerosols, these data are significantly distinct from the in situ observations presented in this work; hence, we have not utilized satellite data in this study.\n\na. Individual datasets from telescope sources\n\nWe have six distinct time series of τ from the telescope data: two from stellar observations of the CMT covering different time periods (with much reduced error in the later measurements) and two (simultaneous) series—in transmission and scattering—during morning and afternoon, from the Mark-1 instrument. Unfortunately, the transmission data end in late 2005 due to instrumental failure. All of these individual time series are plotted together in Figs. 5a–c. Prior to their use, the CMT data were corrected to the equivalent wavelength of the Mark-1 instrument (769.9 nm) using the correction values of King (1985). From initial examination, these data show good agreement, indicating that conditions are usually stable at τ < 0.1 all year at the height of the observatories, with the exception of sporadic high-magnitude variations clustered around summer months, during which time τ regularly reaches values that are a factor of 2–6 times higher than normal.\n\nThese data are also displayed as density plots (Figs. 6a–c), which indicate the proportion of the values (%) that fall within a given range of τ values. There are several features that should be noted in the density plots: First, these data are made up of a normally distributed component centered around low (τ < 0.1) values and a long positive tail (gamma distribution). The normally distributed component (which we shall also refer to in this work as “baseline conditions”) results from the regular state of the local atmosphere around the Canary Islands (i.e., conditions in the absence of a mineral-dust-loaded atmosphere), whereas the long positive tail results from the influence of mineral dust suspended in the local atmosphere. The idea that baseline and dust-influenced τ values may be statistically separated has been explored by several authors (e.g., Guerrero et al. 1998; Jiménez et al. 1998; Siher et al. 2004; García-Gil et al. 2010); although, these studies were limited as they did not consider long-term changes in baseline τ conditions (Laken et al. 2014).\n\nThe second feature of interest in the density plots is a comparison of the changing distribution identified at different times of day and with different measurement methods (Fig. 6). We find that the broadest distribution is that of the early CMT measurements, which used a silicone strip detector (SSD)-based instrument. We also note that these measurements have low sensitivity, leading to the coarse categorization of τ values, whereas the later, more sophisticated, CMT CCD measurements are in better agreement with the Mark-1 data. The median values of the distributions are 0.047 ± 0.005 τ. Interestingly, the Mark-1 afternoon distributions show slightly lower (and less peaked) modal values than their morning counterparts, with afternoon values being 0.052 and 0.044 τ versus 0.053 and 0.046 τ in the morning (for transmission and scattering, respectively); the nightly extinction values from the CMT lie between these values. This result is likely due to a physical difference in the baseline aerosol conditions of local atmosphere, as the light of the morning extinction data travels over the atmosphere overlying North Africa, whereas afternoon light travels through atmosphere overlying the North Atlantic. Consequently, the mornings have a higher and more consistent dust loading than the afternoons (and thus both a higher and more peaked modal value).\n\nb. Population fitting method\n\nA normal-gamma mixture distribution is used to model the population of the extinction values. We fit the theoretical distribution to the observed atmospheric extinction values over a specified interval (e.g., the whole population, or a 100-day moving window) by using a Bayesian approach, computing the posterior probability distributions for the mixture distribution parameters using a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) procedure.\n\nThe distribution is a linear combination of a normal distribution (modeling the extinction variability of regular atmospheric conditions), combined with a gamma distribution (to model the long positive tail caused by the mineral dust conditions). Namely, the mixture distribution for τ is P(τ; μ, σ, , , , c), where μ and σ are the mean and standard deviation of the normal distribution, respectively; , , and are the origin, shape, and width of the gamma distribution, respectively; and c is the mixing factor. An example of this fitting procedure is given in Fig. 7 for the CMT CCD data, with the 50th and 99.9th percentile values of the normal distribution highlighted.\n\nUninformative constant priors are used on all the distribution parameters, and the likelihood is expressed directly as the product of the probabilities for obtaining each τ value from the composite distribution. Based on the μ and σ posteriors of the normal component of the composite distribution, we may identify key features of the populations. For example, in Fig. 8 we have used this method to plot the 50th percentile probability (i.e., modal) values of the normal component of the distribution. In a following section, we will use the distributions to construct a high-pass filter (HPF) to identify the 99.9th percentile probability value of the normal distribution as the point at which we consider all higher values to be outside the range of baseline variability, and thus indicate a day where mineral dust was present in the local atmosphere. Using the MCMC fitting technique, we find that the 99.9th percentile values of the normally distributed components within the six density plots of Fig. 6 are 0.083 ± 0.013 τ (we note these data cover the entire available observation period excluding volcanic years and are calculated from intensity at 769.9 nm). Generally, values beyond this threshold can be considered to be influenced by the suspended mineral dust; however, we note that this threshold is sensitive to change over time with baseline τ conditions (particularly as a result of the influence of volcanic stratospheric aerosol influence).\n\na. Accumulated time series\n\nEach of the six time series of Fig. 5 has benefits and limitations. In addition to the differing performance of both the measurement methods of the CMT and Mark-1, extinctions calculated from different positions, observing different directions of the sky, and at different times of the day may result in a range of distinct biases (as noted in section 3). Additionally, artificial biases related to errors in the fitting of air mass to the apparent brightness of an object may also be a factor influencing τ calculated at distinct periods of the day (e.g., Cachorro et al. 2004, 2008). Consequently, we have combined the individual time series together to create a more robust dataset, shown in Fig. 8, that represents the τ and error over the region of the Canary Islands during a period of approximately 24 h. This was accomplished by averaging the available τ values over a calendar day and accumulating the RMSE. To these data, we have used the MCMC fitting procedure previously described to fit the 50th and 99.9th percentile values of the normally distributed data component, over a 100-day moving window (as explained in section 3). We consider any value that exceeds the 99.9th percentile value across the accumulated data to indicate dust-influenced conditions.\n\nA clear benefit of accumulating the data is also the data coverage achieved. Individually, the telescope observations are restricted to certain times of day and have varying coverage over the observation period; accumulating the data achieves a nearly full coverage over the 1984–2014 period (with a monthly average of 30.04 ± 0.18 days month−1). An initial analysis of the accumulated τ data shows a number of prominent features:\n\nThe most common extinction values are low (τ < 0.1) and demonstrate possible seasonal variability, yet are stable over long (>1 yr) time scales. The data points are readily distinguishable from the considerably higher τ values associated with mineral dust events centered around summer months.\n\nThe impact of stratospheric aerosols from the Mt. Pinatubo volcanic eruption in 1991 is evident as a strong increase in the normally distributed (nondust related) τ component, over a period of roughly 3 yr, increasing extinction by —approximately doubling baseline values. It is also probable that the eruption of El Chichón in 1982 also influenced the start of the records as τ values were initially anomalously high (both features have been previously noted from telescope data of La Palma; e.g., Guerrero et al. 1998; García-Gil et al. 2010).\n\nTo explore the seasonal behavior of the accumulated data, we have plotted the daily τ values of the 1984–2014 period by their day-of-year (DOY) occurrence (Fig. 9a)—the years associated with the El Chichón and Mt. Pinatubo eruptions were excluded. These data show that the influence of mineral dust outbreaks on the local atmosphere of the Canary Islands is largely confined to the June–October period, during which time τ values from ~0.1–0.7 may occur. Prior to this, a less-frequent and less-intense period of outbreaks also occurs during the months of February–April.\n\nStrong seasonal variations in the latitudinal export of mineral dust from the Sahara are well known (e.g., Janowiak 1988; Swap et al. 1996; Moulin et al. 1997; Goudie and Middleton 2001). However, regarding the seasonality of the dust outbreaks, there is an important point to consider: qualitative observations and local experience suggest that dust outbreaks occur below the height of the telescopes, and consequently are not observed (Varela et al. 2008). If the height of the dust outbreaks varies with a seasonal component, then this would introduce a bias in the data. This is likely as during summer dust outbreaks tend to occur in the free troposphere (Cuesta et al. 2009), whereas in winter outbreaks more frequently occur in the marine boundary layer (MBL) as a result of anticyclonic activity (Viana et al. 2002; Alonso-Pérez et al. 2011). Consequently, it is likely that at least some of the seasonality observed in the dust outbreaks from telescopes is due to measurement bias (we will consider this further shortly).\n\nTwo further limitations to both the telescope and AERONET measurements with regard to identifying dust outbreaks should also be mentioned. First, even if the dust outbreaks are of a sufficiently high altitude to be observed by the telescopes, they can also be of a highly localized nature, having a clearly defined boundary (e.g., Cana 2002). Consequently, telescopes may miss dust outbreaks if they fail to intersect the path of light that the telescopes are observing (e.g., Varela et al. 2008). Second, dust outbreaks in the marine boundary layer have also been noted in association with anticyclonic conditions (e.g., Varela et al. 2008; Alonso-Pérez et al. 2011): in cases where the mineral dust aerosols are underlying (or mixed with) cloud cover above the height of the instruments, no observations are made.\n\nAlthough the properties of the dust outbreaks are readily apparent in Fig. 9a, the baseline conditions appear to be homogenous. We have further examined the baseline conditions by plotting the DOY 1 SEM τ values of the 50th and 99.9th percentile MCMC fits (i.e., the solid and dashed red lines, respectively, in Fig. 8). These data are presented in Fig. 9b and essentially show the long-term (100-day smoothed) behavior of the baseline conditions from the accumulated data. From these data, we find that a small rise in τ occurs from winter to summer, of 0.042 ± 0.001 to 0.056 ± 0.0018 for the 50th percentile values. It is unlikely that this variation is physical, but instead it is likely to be a residual artifact from low-airmass bias in summer; that is, despite our attempt to homogenize the data, some summertime low-airmass bias likely remains, resulting in elevated τ values (of around 0.01). We also observe the DOY variation is not smooth, particularly for the 99.9th percentile values, with small discontinuities of frequently occurring. These small differences are caused by instances where the MCMC fitting procedure has slightly overestimated the size of the normal distribution; this overestimation relates to our conservative threshold (the 99.9th percentile) and the consequent amount of overlap between the dust-free, dust-influenced populations. By selecting a conservative threshold, we are biased toward type 1 errors—that is, we more frequently consider a dust-influenced day as a dust-free day than vice versa—as the weakest dust events will be included within the normal distribution (as shown in Fig. 8).\n\nb. AERONET analysis\n\nAs described in section 2, we use data from three available AERONET monitors on the island of Tenerife, located closely in horizontal space yet with large differences in vertical position above mean sea level. Time series from the three sites are plotted in Fig. 10, for Mt. Teide, 2391 m, green points (Fig. 10a); La Laguna, 568 m, red points (Fig. 10b); and Santa Cruz, 52 m, blue points (the relationship between the colors used and the specific stations are maintained throughout all subsequent figures; Fig. 10c). We have overplotted the 50th percentile fits (black lines). These data are also presented in Fig. 11, plotted by their DOY occurrence as both the individual values (Fig. 11a) and the 50th and 99.9th percentile fits (Fig. 11b).\n\nThese data show three features of interest. First, a decrease in the baseline values with increasing altitude, from 0.067 ± 2.3 × 10–4 to 0.058 ± 2.5 × 10–4 to 0.017 ± 6.8 × 10–5. This decrease is expected, as the Mt. Teide monitor is situated above the boundary layer, whereas the La Laguna and Santa Cruz sites are within the boundary layer and are also located in urban centers, and thus they should measure significantly higher aerosol concentrations. These differences are most readily apparent in Fig. 11b, with the Mt. Teide DOY 99.9th percentile values appearing below even the 50th percentiles of the La Laguna and Santa Cruz station baseline values for the majority of the year. Second, we find the baseline conditions of the AERONET sites lack the artificial seasonality identified in the telescope (in Fig. 9b). Third, despite only 6–10 yr of data being available, there is an apparent difference between the seasonal confinement of mineral dust events between the stations: that is, while the Mt. Teide monitor agrees with the telescope observations, in that virtually no dust events occur during wintertime, the low-altitude stations (La Laguna and Santa Cruz) show numerous events occurring in wintertime. This supports the hypothesis that part of the seasonality detected in the telescope data is due to a seasonal change in the altitude of mineral dust intrusions, an idea that we will test in the following section.\n\nc. Dust outbreak height and seasonality\n\nWe wish to consider how the occurrence of dust events changes both seasonally and over long (>1 yr) time scales. To understand this property, we have examined the frequency of dust events per month (a statistic we refer to as ). The is calculated from the accumulated data series shown in Fig. 8, by summing the number of days per month where τ exceeded the 99.9th percentile MCMC fit over the time series and then dividing this count by the days per calendar month to create a fraction from 0 to 1; that is, , where is the number of days per calendar month, where τ (or ) were found to be above or equal to the MCMC fit to the 99.9th percentile baseline value, and where is equal to the number of days per calendar month. Consequently, shows the proportion of a given calendar month where dust-influenced conditions are observed.\n\nA seasonal climatology of the statistic is plotted showing data from the accumulated telescopes from 1983 to 2014 (Fig. 12a) and from the accumulated telescope and AERONET where available over their overlapping observation period of 2004–14 (Fig. 12b).\n\nFrom an examination of the accumulated telescope data over the entire observed period, we observe a strong peak in during the months of July and August of 0.46 ± 0.08 (Fig. 12a). Either side of this peak, the rapidly decreases over a 1–2-month period to ~0.05 ± 0.02. However, examinations of the same data from AERONET show that the period decrease (either side of July and August) is longer, and that the wintertime is higher and more complicated than the telescope data initially reveals (Fig. 12b).\n\nWe find that the values of all data points only correspond within a ±1 SEM range during the months of July–September. Although the AERONET observation period is relativity limited, and uncertainty exists in the results from the stations due to differences in the amount of observed days per month, these result suggests that the dust outbreaks frequently occur at high altitudes (approximately >2.4 km) during summer months, although lower-altitude outbreaks also occur (when combined they may occur with a of 0.44 ± 0.15). Furthermore, low-altitude events are persistent throughout the year.\n\nWe present this result in a slightly different manner in Fig. 13: this figure shows the μ and (and upper limit) both above and below a height of approximately 2.4 km MSL. The figure shows that during the peak summer months (July–August), the vast majority (94.3 ± 1.6%) of outbreaks are at high altitudes (≥2.4 km), whereas during the months of November–May, dust outbreaks occur predominately (79.5 ± 3.1%) at low altitudes (<2.4 km), although with far less frequency than in the summer months ( )."
