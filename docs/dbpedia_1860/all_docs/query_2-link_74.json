        "text": "Wonderful climb, though done from just off the main road near the airport. Then you skip the route right through the city. By the way, on the other side of town into the Anaga nature reserve is also highly recommended.\n\nBack to this climb. The first kilometres from the airport go back and forth through a beautiful forest. I was there first week of January and the traffic wasn't too bad. As soon as you exit the forest, you get a beautiful view of the top of the volcano and, in the same view, the ocean. Bizarre and beautiful at the same time. The landscape gets more and more volcanic all the way to the summit.\n\nHighly recommended."
