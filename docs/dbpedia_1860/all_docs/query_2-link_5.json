        "text": "The Port Authority of Santa Cruz de Tenerife organized a significant plaque exchange ceremony with the hospital ship Global Mercy on Wednesday, July 11, 2024. The ship docked for the first time at the south dock of the port of Santa Cruz de Tenerife. The event was attended by prominent authorities and institutional representatives, who recognized the important humanitarian work carried out by this ship.\n\nDuring the ceremony, the President of the Port Authority, Pedro José Suárez López de Vergara, presented the plaque to Captain Perez Taylor of the Global Mercy. The event was very emotional and concluded with a tour of the ship’s facilities, where attendees signed the guest book. This activity allowed the authorities to see firsthand the impressive humanitarian work performed by the Global Mercy, carried out by a dedicated team of volunteers.\n\nAmong the attendees were Ilma. Sra. Dña. Esther María Monzón Monzón, Minister of Health of the Government of the Canary Islands; Ilma. Sra. Dña. Águeda Fumero Roque, Insular Minister for Social Action, Inclusion, and Volunteering of the Tenerife Island Council; Ilma. Sra. Dña. Gladis de León León, Second Deputy Mayor and President of the Tagoror of the Anaga District of the Santa Cruz de Tenerife City Council; Ilmo. Sr. D. Celso David Mendoza Negrín, Director General of Diversity of the Government of the Canary Islands; and Sra. Dña. Rosa Gloria Suárez López de Vergara, President of UNICEF in the Canary Islands. Also in attendance were Sr. D. Pino Hernández Camón, Secretary of the Cabinet of the Minister of Health, and Sr. D. Miguel Ángel Pérez Delgado, Secretary of the Councilor-President of the Tagoror of the Anaga District.\n\nLuz Marina Espiau, Head of the Commercial and Business Development Division of the Port Authority, highlighted during her speech an unprecedented event in a European port: the installation of solidarity tents with the ship present in the port. This event, which will take place from July 19 to 28 in Santa Cruz de Tenerife, will allow the dissemination of the Global Mercy’s work, seek donations, and recruit volunteers. It promises to be an excellent opportunity for the community to get involved and support this noble cause.\n\nPedro José Suárez López de Vergara, President of the Port Authority of Santa Cruz de Tenerife, expressed his gratitude and emphasized the importance of this collaboration: “These types of experiences remind us of the importance of international collaboration and solidarity in difficult times. The dedication of the volunteers and the mission of the Global Mercy are truly inspiring and motivate us to continue working with enthusiasm and commitment.”\n\nGerardo Vangioni, President of Mercy Ships in Spain, highlighted: “When all the ports in the world were closing during the COVID pandemic, the ports of Tenerife allowed us to dock in Granadilla,” also acknowledging the Director of Operations, Daniel Lauermann, “that the Port Authority has opened its doors so that we can bring hope and health to our African neighbors.” It is worth noting that in previous years, the base port of the Global Mercy was our port in Granadilla.\n\nThe event also featured words of gratitude from the President of the Ports of Tenerife to Mercy Ships, highlighting the commendable work they do in developing countries and stating that “the port of Tenerife is and will be their home.”\n\nThe Port Authority of Santa Cruz de Tenerife is proud to have been part of this event and looks forward to continuing to collaborate with Mercy Ships in the future, ensuring that the port remains a key point in humanitarian aid and community development."
