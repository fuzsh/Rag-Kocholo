You can check the flight distance between airports, or measure the driving distance from an airport to the local city. If you're booking a long flight, check the flight duration from one airport to another, or look up the local time zone at any major international airport. We also have a list of smaller local airports for pilots of smaller airplanes and helicopters. Let us know if your local airport needs to be added or updated, or if you see an airport distance that is missing."
