Lower dew points feel drier and higher dew points feel more humid. Unlike temperature, which typically varies significantly between night and day, dew point tends to change more slowly, so while the temperature may drop at night, a muggy day is typically followed by a muggy night.\n\nThe chance that a given day will be muggy in Santa Cruz de Tenerife is essentially constant during the winter, remaining within 1% of 1% throughout.\n\nThe lowest chance of a muggy day during the winter is 0% on January 14.\n\nFor reference, on August 28, the muggiest day of the year, there are muggy conditions 40% of the time, while on January 13, the least muggy day of the year, there are muggy conditions 0% of the time.\n\nHumidity Comfort Levels in the Winter in Santa Cruz de Tenerife\n\nHumidity Comfort Levels in the Winter in Santa Cruz de TenerifeDecJanFeb0%0%10%10%20%20%30%30%40%40%50%50%60%60%70%70%80%80%90%90%100%100%FallSpringJan 140%Jan 140%Dec 12%Dec 12%Feb 280%Feb 280%Jan 10%Jan 10%Feb 10%Feb 10%humidhumidcomfortablecomfortabledrydrymuggymuggy\n\ndry 55Â°F comfortable 60Â°F humid 65Â°F muggy 70Â°F oppressive 75Â°F miserable\n\nWind\n\nThis section discusses the wide-area hourly average wind vector (speed and direction) at 10 meters above the ground. The wind experienced at any given location is highly dependent on local topography and other factors, and instantaneous wind speed and direction vary more widely than hourly averages.\n\nThe average hourly wind speed in Santa Cruz de Tenerife is increasing during the winter, increasing from 11.7 miles per hour to 12.8 miles per hour over the course of the season.\n\nFor reference, on July 16, the windiest day of the year, the daily average wind speed is 15.0 miles per hour, while on October 6, the calmest day of the year, the daily average wind speed is 10.2 miles per hour.\n\nAverage Wind Speed in the Winter in Santa Cruz de Tenerife\n\nAverage Wind Speed in the Winter in Santa Cruz de TenerifeDecJanFeb0 mph0 mph5 mph5 mph10 mph10 mph15 mph15 mph20 mph20 mphFallSpringDec 111.7 mphDec 111.7 mphFeb 2812.8 mphFeb 2812.8 mphJan 112.1 mphJan 112.1 mphFeb 112.4 mphFeb 112.4 mph\n\nThe wind direction in Santa Cruz de Tenerife during the winter is predominantly out of the east from December 1 to January 26 and the north from January 26 to February 28.\n\nWind Direction in the Winter in Santa Cruz de Tenerife\n\nWind Direction in the Winter in Santa Cruz de TenerifeNENDecJanFeb0%100%20%80%40%60%60%40%80%20%100%0%FallSpringeastnorthwestsouth\n\nnortheastsouthwest\n\nWater Temperature\n\nSanta Cruz de Tenerife is located near a large body of water (e.g., ocean, sea, or large lake). This section reports on the wide-area average surface temperature of that water.\n\nThe average surface water temperature in Santa Cruz de Tenerife is decreasing during the winter, falling by 5Â°F, from 70Â°F to 66Â°F, over the course of the season.\n\nAverage Water Temperature in the Winter in Santa Cruz de Tenerife\n\nAverage Water Temperature in the Winter in Santa Cruz de TenerifeDecJanFeb64Â°F64Â°F66Â°F66Â°F68Â°F68Â°F70Â°F70Â°F72Â°F72Â°F74Â°F74Â°F76Â°F76Â°FFallSpringDec 170Â°FDec 170Â°FFeb 2866Â°FFeb 2866Â°FJan 168Â°FJan 168Â°FFeb 166Â°FFeb 166Â°F\n\nGrowing Season\n\nDefinitions of the growing season vary throughout the world, but for the purposes of this report, we define it as the longest continuous period of non-freezing temperatures (≥ 32Â°F) in the year (the calendar year in the Northern Hemisphere, or from July 1 until June 30 in the Southern Hemisphere).\n\nTemperatures in Santa Cruz de Tenerife are sufficiently warm year round that it is not entirely meaningful to discuss the growing season in these terms. We nevertheless include the chart below as an illustration of the distribution of temperatures experienced throughout the year.\n\nTime Spent in Various Temperature Bands and the Growing Season in the Winter in Santa Cruz de Tenerife\n\nTime Spent in Various Temperature Bands and the Growing Season in the Winter in Santa Cruz de TenerifeDecJanFeb0%100%10%90%20%80%30%70%40%60%50%50%60%40%70%30%80%20%90%10%100%0%FallSpring100%Jan 15100%Jan 15coolcomfortablewarm\n\nfrigid 15Â°F freezing 32Â°F very cold 45Â°F cold 55Â°F cool 65Â°F comfortable 75Â°F warm 85Â°F hot 95Â°F sweltering\n\nGrowing degree days are a measure of yearly heat accumulation used to predict plant and animal development, and defined as the integral of warmth above a base temperature, discarding any excess above a maximum temperature. In this report, we use a base of 50Â°F and a cap of 86Â°F.\n\nThe average accumulated growing degree days in Santa Cruz de Tenerife are very rapidly decreasing during the winter, decreasing by 5,762Â°F, from 6,556Â°F to 794Â°F, over the course of the season.\n\nGrowing Degree Days in the Winter in Santa Cruz de Tenerife\n\nGrowing Degree Days in the Winter in Santa Cruz de TenerifeDecJanFeb1,000Â°F1,000Â°F2,000Â°F2,000Â°F3,000Â°F3,000Â°F4,000Â°F4,000Â°F5,000Â°F5,000Â°F6,000Â°F6,000Â°F7,000Â°F7,000Â°FFallSpringDec 16,556Â°FDec 16,556Â°FFeb 28794Â°FFeb 28794Â°F\n\nSolar Energy\n\nThis section discusses the total daily incident shortwave solar energy reaching the surface of the ground over a wide area, taking full account of seasonal variations in the length of the day, the elevation of the Sun above the horizon, and absorption by clouds and other atmospheric constituents. Shortwave radiation includes visible light and ultraviolet radiation.\n\nThe average daily incident shortwave solar energy in Santa Cruz de Tenerife is rapidly increasing during the winter, rising by 1.7 kWh, from 3.5 kWh to 5.1 kWh, over the course of the season.\n\nThe lowest average daily incident shortwave solar energy during the winter is 3.3 kWh on December 16.\n\nAverage Daily Incident Shortwave Solar Energy in the Winter in Santa Cruz de Tenerife\n\nAverage Daily Incident Shortwave Solar Energy in the Winter in Santa Cruz de TenerifeDecJanFeb0 kWh0 kWh1 kWh1 kWh2 kWh2 kWh3 kWh3 kWh4 kWh4 kWh5 kWh5 kWh6 kWh6 kWh7 kWh7 kWhFallSpringDec 163.3 kWhDec 163.3 kWhFeb 285.1 kWhFeb 285.1 kWhJan 13.4 kWhJan 13.4 kWhFeb 14.1 kWhFeb 14.1 kWh\n\nTopography\n\nFor the purposes of this report, the geographical coordinates of Santa Cruz de Tenerife are 28.468 deg latitude, -16.255 deg longitude, and 180 ft elevation.\n\nThe topography within 2 miles of Santa Cruz de Tenerife contains very significant variations in elevation, with a maximum elevation change of 1,781 feet and an average elevation above sea level of 365 feet. Within 10 miles contains very significant variations in elevation (4,954 feet). Within 50 miles also contains extreme variations in elevation (12,152 feet).\n\nThe area within 2 miles of Santa Cruz de Tenerife is covered by water (42%), artificial surfaces (38%), and shrubs (15%), within 10 miles by water (56%) and shrubs (22%), and within 50 miles by water (88%).\n\nData Sources\n\nThis report illustrates the typical weather in Santa Cruz de Tenerife, based on a statistical analysis of historical hourly weather reports and model reconstructions from January 1, 1980 to December 31, 2016.\n\nTemperature and Dew Point\n\nThere are 2 weather stations near enough to contribute to our estimation of the temperature and dew point in Santa Cruz de Tenerife.\n\nFor each station, the records are corrected for the elevation difference between that station and Santa Cruz de Tenerife according to the International Standard Atmosphere , and by the relative change present in the MERRA-2 satellite-era reanalysis between the two locations.\n\nThe estimated value at Santa Cruz de Tenerife is computed as the weighted average of the individual contributions from each station, with weights proportional to the inverse of the distance between Santa Cruz de Tenerife and a given station.\n\nThe stations contributing to this reconstruction are:\n\nTenerife South Airport (GCTS, 71%, 35 mi, southwest, 26 ft elevation change)\n\nGran Canaria Airport (GCLP, 29%, 65 mi, southeast, -105 ft elevation change)\n\nTo get a sense of how much these sources agree with each other, you can view a comparison of Santa Cruz de Tenerife and the stations that contribute to our estimates of its temperature history and climate. Please note that each source's contribution is adjusted for elevation and the relative change present in the MERRA-2 data.\n\nOther Data\n\nAll data relating to the Sun's position (e.g., sunrise and sunset) are computed using astronomical formulas from the book, Astronomical Algorithms 2nd Edition , by Jean Meeus.\n\nAll other weather data, including cloud cover, precipitation, wind speed and direction, and solar flux, come from NASA's MERRA-2 Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis . This reanalysis combines a variety of wide-area measurements in a state-of-the-art global meteorological model to reconstruct the hourly history of weather throughout the world on a 50-kilometer grid.\n\nLand Use data comes from the Global Land Cover SHARE database , published by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.\n\nElevation data comes from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) , published by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\n\nNames, locations, and time zones of places and some airports come from the GeoNames Geographical Database .\n\nTime zones for airports and weather stations are provided by AskGeo.com .\n\nMaps are © OpenStreetMap contributors.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe information on this site is provided as is, without any assurances as to its accuracy or suitability for any purpose. Weather data is prone to errors, outages, and other defects. We assume no responsibility for any decisions made on the basis of the content presented on this site.\n\nWe draw particular cautious attention to our reliance on the MERRA-2 model-based reconstructions for a number of important data series. While having the tremendous advantages of temporal and spatial completeness, these reconstructions: (1) are based on computer models that may have model-based errors, (2) are coarsely sampled on a 50 km grid and are therefore unable to reconstruct the local variations of many microclimates, and (3) have particular difficulty with the weather in some coastal areas, especially small islands.\n\nWe further caution that our travel scores are only as good as the data that underpin them, that weather conditions at any given location and time are unpredictable and variable, and that the definition of the scores reflects a particular set of preferences that may not agree with those of any particular reader.\n\nPlease review our full terms contained on our Terms of Service page."
