        "text": "For the province, see Santa Cruz de Tenerife (province). For other places named Santa Cruz, see Santa Cruz (disambiguation).\n\nMunicipality in Canary Islands, Spain\n\nSanta Cruz de Tenerife (Spanish: [ˈsanta ˈkɾuθ ðe teneˈɾife] ⓘ; locally [ˈsanta ˈkɾus ðe teneˈɾife]), commonly abbreviated as Santa Cruz, is a city, the capital of the island of Tenerife, Province of Santa Cruz de Tenerife, and one of the capitals of the Canary Islands, along with Las Palmas. Santa Cruz has a population of 206,593 (2013) within its administrative limits.[6] The urban zone of Santa Cruz extends beyond the city limits with a population of 507,306[7] and 538,000[3] within urban area. It is the second largest city in the Canary Islands and the main city on the island of Tenerife, with nearly half of the island's population living in or around it.\n\nSanta Cruz is located in the northeast quadrant of Tenerife, 210 kilometres (130 mi) off the north-western coast of Africa within the Atlantic Ocean. The distance to the nearest point of mainland Spain is 1,300 kilometres (810 mi). Between the 1833 territorial division of Spain and 1927, Santa Cruz de Tenerife was the sole capital of the Canary Islands, until 1927 when the archipelago was split into the current two provinces.[8][9] The port is of great importance and is the communications hub between Europe, Africa and Americas, with cruise ships arriving from many nations. The city is the focus for domestic and inter-island communications in the Canary Islands.[10]\n\nThe city is home to the Parliament of the Canary Islands, the Audience of Accounts of the Canary Islands, the Captaincy General of the Canary Islands,[11] the Canarias Ministry of the Presidency (shared on a four-year cycle with Las Palmas), one half of the Ministries and Boards of the Canarias Government, (the other half being located in Gran Canaria), the Tenerife Provincial Courts and two courts of the Superior Court of Justice of the Canary Islands. There are several faculties of the La Laguna University in Santa Cruz, including the Fine Arts School and the Naval Sciences Faculty. Its harbour is one of Spain's busiest. It is important for commercial and passenger traffic as well as for being a major stopover for cruisers en route from Europe to the Caribbean. The city also has one of the world's largest carnivals. The Carnival of Santa Cruz de Tenerife now aspires to become a World Heritage Site, and is the second largest in the world.[12]\n\nThe varied architecture of the city stands out, highlighting the Auditorio de Tenerife (Auditorium of Tenerife), which is considered one of the greatest exponents of contemporary architecture. In the panoramic view of the city, the Torres de Santa Cruz (Santa Cruz Towers) also stand out, with the tallest twin towers in Spain at 120 meters (390 ft) high. Other outstanding places are the Plaza de España (Spain Square), which is the nerve center of the city, and the Parque García Sanabria (García Sanabria Park), a large urban park located in the center of the city. Outside the city but in its municipal district, Playa de Las Teresitas (Las Teresitas) and a large part of the Macizo de Anaga (Anaga Massif) stand out, declared a Biosphere Reserve by UNESCO in 2015. Santa Cruz de Tenerife hosts the first headquarters of the Center UNESCO in the Canary Islands. In recent years the city of Santa Cruz de Tenerife has seen the construction of a significant number of modern structures and the city's skyline is the sixth in height across the country, behind Madrid, Benidorm, Barcelona, Valencia and Bilbao.[13]\n\nIn 2012, the British newspaper The Guardian included Santa Cruz de Tenerife in the list of the five best places in the world to live, next to the Cihangir district, in Istanbul; the district of Sankt Pauli, in Hamburg, the north coast of Maui, in Hawaii and Portland, in Oregon.[14] The 82% of the municipal territory of Santa Cruz de Tenerife is considered a natural area, this is due in large part to the presence of the Anaga Rural Park. This fact makes Santa Cruz the third largest municipality in Spain with the highest percentage of natural territory, after Cuenca (87%) and Cáceres (83%).[15]\n\nEtymology\n\n[edit]\n\nThe area where Santa Cruz currently lies belonged to Menceyato Guanche Anaga, which was the most easterly of the island. The city that is now Santa Cruz had a few names throughout its history: Añazo or Añaza (Guanche name), Puerto de Santiago Santa Cruz de Tenerife, Santa Cruz de Santiago de Tenerife,[16] and Santa Cruz de Tenerife (current), which means: \"holy cross of Tenerife,\" in memory of the foundation of the city, when a Christian cross was planted in the place that is now the center of town.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nGuanche period, conquest and Castilian colonization\n\n[edit]\n\nThe area on which now stands the city and the municipality of Santa Cruz de Tenerife has been the subject of human occupation since the time of the Guanches, approximately 2000 years ago, as attested by the archaeological sites found. The area was known to the Guanches, the first inhabitants of the island, as Añazo or Añaza. The famous Mummy of San Andrés is one of the most important archaeological remains of the aboriginal past of the region. Besides caves with some remains of mummified animals and stones with engravings ruprestres. This area belonged to the Menceyato de Anaga (aboriginal Guanche kingdom of Anaga), one of nine in which the island was divided.\n\nOn 3 May 1494 Castilian troops under the control of the conqueror Alonso Fernández de Lugo disembarked on the beaches of the present city and founded a military camp that would eventually develop into the city.[17] From this place began the conquest of the island of Tenerife. During the foundation, Alonso Fernández de Lugo placed a large wooden cross in reference to the day of disembarkation, during the Catholic festivity of the Invention of the Cross (3 May). After the conquest and defeat of the Guanche aborigines, the capital of the island was initially established in the city of San Cristóbal de La Laguna, which was founded in the same year of the conquest of the island in 1496.[17]\n\nOld Regime and Modern Stage\n\n[edit]\n\nLater, it became one of the most important ports of the Atlantic, a status it retains to this day. This former fishermen's village rose to prominence after a Volcano destroyed the port of Garachico in the 18th century. Santa Cruz became the major port on the Island. It first won its independence from La Laguna and, in the 19th century, was awarded the status of Capital of the Province of Canary Islands by King Ferdinand VII.\n\nBetween 1833 and 1927 Santa Cruz de Tenerife was the sole capital of the Canary Islands. In 1927 a Royal decree ordered that the status of capital city of the Canary Islands would be shared with Las Palmas in Gran Canaria. This arrangement remains in place today.[8][9]\n\nIn 1893 an outbreak of cholera-morbid spread throughout the city and neighboring municipalities. The disease was brought by an Italian ship returning from Brazil. There were 382 dead.[18]\n\nBetween 1936 and 1939, during the Spanish Civil War, the Canary Islands were in the rear of General Francisco Franco's side. In this context, in 1936 the republican mayor of Santa Cruz de Tenerife, José Carlos Schwartz Hernández, was arrested and murdered. After the war, years of great economic difficulties followed.\n\nFrom 1978, with the new Spanish Constitution and the Statute of Autonomy of the Canary Islands, a new stage began, always with democratically elected mayors.\n\nIn the 80s and 90s of the 20th century, the city experiences a great economic boom. The expansion of the city towards the south begins gaining ground to the Santa Cruz de Tenerife Refinery and creating new residential and urbanizable areas such as Cabo-Llanos. Since then, this area of the city is immersed in a major construction boom that has been nicknamed \"Manhattanization\",[19] due to the presence of tall buildings and the layout of the streets that mimics that of American cities.\n\nCurrent era: 21st century\n\n[edit]\n\nSanta Cruz inaugurated the 21st century with a great expansionary and commercial boom that is especially manifested in architecture with the construction of emblematic buildings such as the Auditorio de Tenerife, the work of Santiago Calatrava or the remodeling of the Plaza de España according to the design of Swiss architects Herzog & de Meuron.\n\nA torrential flood took place on 31st March 2002. This was caused by a phenomenon of cold drop characterized by the repeated fall of torrential rain accompanied by lightning, which affected the metropolitan area of Santa Cruz de Tenerife. The flooding caused 8 dead, 12 missing and dozens injured.[20]\n\nIn recent years, it has become clear that there exists a de facto union with neighbouring city San Cristóbal de La Laguna (141,627 inhabitants as in 2005 census) due to the rapid population growth and reduction in undeveloped space between the cities, as their suburbs merged, forming a metropolitan area with 420,198 inhabitants (including the nearby municipalities of Tegueste, Candelaria and El Rosario). Regarding this situation, the mayor of Santa Cruz, Miguel Zerolo Aguilar and his La Laguna counterpart, Ana María Oramas Moro, both belonging to the Canarian Coalition, stated several times to local media that they shared a willingness to proceed to a full political union between their municipalities, even though the decision was postponed to a date after the local elections in 2007. As of 2012 the merger is no longer part of the political agenda.[21]\n\nThe financial crisis of 2008 would paralyze the development of the city for more than a decade.[citation needed]\n\nIn June 2018, the dismantling of the Santa Cruz de Tenerife Refinery was announced, which will allow the expansion of the city to the south.[22]\n\nAdministrative divisions\n\n[edit]\n\nSanta Cruz is divided administratively into five districts, which in turn are subdivided into districts, not necessarily consistent with the traditional neighborhoods.\n\nNo District Population[23] 1 Anaga 14,135 2 Centro-Ifara 53,652 3 La Salud-La Salle 70,120 4 Ofra-Costa Sur 47,977 5 Distrito Suroeste 41,136\n\nDemographics\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1990, the population peaked above the 200,000 mark. Santa Cruz de Tenerife and the city of San Cristóbal de La Laguna form a continuous urban area, with a combined population of over 380,000 inhabitants.[24][25]\n\nEthnically, the population is mainly of European origin, primarily from the Iberian Península, both Spain and Portugal, with some mix of the island's original inhabitants, the Guanches. There has been some Latin American immigration (especially from Cuba and Venezuela) as well as from both Northern and Sub-Sahara Africa. There are also important historical minorities such as Indians (Sindhi), Koreans (see Koreans in Spain) and, more recently, Russians.[citation needed] The majority of the population professes the Catholic religion, but there are also small communities of Hindus and Muslims. In Santa Cruz de Tenerife, crime has decreased in recent years and the city has gained a reputation for tolerance among its inhabitants. In fact, Santa Cruz de Tenerife was the first city of the Canary Islands to display the rainbow flag alongside the flag of the City Council, in June 2008.[26]\n\nIn comparison with the nearby city of San Cristóbal de La Laguna, which is the seat of Bishopric of Tenerife, traditionally the city of Santa Cruz de Tenerife has had a much more secular character. This fact brought about in the city institutions of deep secular tradition such as the Masonic Temple of Santa Cruz de Tenerife that was one of the largest masonic centers in Spain.[27]\n\nAccording to a study by the National Statistics Institute of Spain (INE), among the two Canarian capitals, Santa Cruz de Tenerife is the one with the highest life expectancy at 81 years. Just behind Santa Cruz is Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, with 80.9 years.[15]\n\nYear Population 1991 200,172 1996 203,787 2001 188,477 2002 217,414 2003 220,022 2004 219,466 2006 221,956 2007 220,902 2008 226,232 2013 206,593\n\nLargest groups of foreign born people in 2018 :[citation needed]\n\nVenezuela 9,608 Cuba 3,940 Argentina 1,659 Bolivia 1,569 Colombia 1,558 Italy 1,097 Morocco 702 Ecuador 655 Uruguay 627 China 558\n\nMetropolitan area\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Santa Cruz de Tenerife-La Laguna Metropolitan Area forms the second largest city and metropolitan area of the European Union outside Europe.

However, the municipal area includes also most of the Anaga Massif, which features 3 additional climate types: Semi-arid climate (BSk), Hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Csa), and Warm-summer Mediterranean climate (Csb). It has influences of a tropical climate, as the average temperature in the coldest month is above 18 °C (64 °F), although it cannot be classified as a tropical climate, because aridity levels prevail.[38] The city's average annual temperature is 25 °C (77 °F) during the day and 18 °C (64 °F) at night. In the coolest month – January, the typical day temperature ranges from 19–23 °C (66–73 °F), to around 15–16 °C (59–61 °F) at night, the average sea temperature is 20 °C (68 °F).

In this city the Añaza Lodge (Logia Añaza) was founded in 1895, which was one of the most important Masonic workshops in Spain in the 20th century and helped consolidate Freemasonry in the Canary Islands and spread the culture and ideas of progress in the Canarian society of the time.[52] Under its auspices the Masonic Temple of Santa Cruz de Tenerife will be built, located on Calle San Lucas and which was the largest Masonic center in Spain until the military occupation of the Franco regime.\n\nThe influence of Masonic symbolism on the architecture and urban planning of the city has been the subject of various academic studies, from the works of Professor Sebastián Hernández Gutiérrez of the University of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria,[53] through the studies of Professor David Martín López from the University of Granada.[54][55][56] More recently those of the architect Carlos Pallés, curator of the exhibitions \"Rostros de La Logia Añaza\" and \"Masonería y Sociedad\" held in 2014.\n\nMelchor Padilla, professor of Geography and History at the University of La Laguna, maintains that by joining some of the buildings and enclaves with Masonic symbols of the city, they form a pentacle or five-pointed star that would extend through the center of the city and whose center would be the García Sanabria Park.\n\nIn 2016 an international Masonic congress was held in Santa Cruz de Tenerife in which 17 regular supreme councils from different countries of the world participated, around 300 people participated in the congress.[57][58] At present there are several tourist routes with a Masonic theme that are organized in the city.[59][60]\n\nSome of the buildings and places with Masonic symbols in the city are:[61]\n\nPalacio Insular de Tenerife\n\nChamber of Commerce building\n\nParque García Sanabria\n\nCemetery of San Rafael and San Roque\n\nMuseo Municipal de Bellas Artes de Santa Cruz de Tenerife\n\nMasonic Temple of Santa Cruz de Tenerife\n\nSites of interest\n\n[edit]\n\nAttractions\n\n[edit]\n\nCalle de la Noria\n\nPalmetum of Santa Cruz de Tenerife\n\nMuseo de la Naturaleza y el Hombre\n\nParque Marítimo César Manrique\n\nPlaya de Las Teresitas\n\nAuditorio de Tenerife\n\nTeatro Guimerá\n\nMuseo Municipal de Bellas Artes de Santa Cruz de Tenerife\n\nPalacio Insular de Tenerife\n\nCasa del Carnaval (Carnival House of Santa Cruz de Tenerife)\n\nMasonic Temple of Santa Cruz de Tenerife\n\nIn the environs:\n\nMacizo de Anaga\n\nIgueste de San Andrés\n\nTaganana\n\nSan Andrés\n\nSkyscrapers\n\n[edit]\n\nTorres de Santa Cruz\n\nRascacielos de la avenida Tres de Mayo\n\nEdificio Olimpo\n\nEdificio Juan Amador\n\nParks and squares\n\n[edit]\n\nParque García Sanabria\n\nParque de La Granja\n\nPlaza de 25 de julio (de los Patos)\n\nPlaza de España\n\nPlaza de la Candelaria\n\nPlaza del Príncipe\n\nPlaza de Weyler\n\nPlaza del Chicharro\n\nChurches and historical monuments\n\n[edit]\n\nIglesia de La Concepción (church)\n\nIglesia de San Francisco de Asís (church)\n\nIglesia de Nuestra Señora del Pilar (church)\n\nIglesia de San José (church)\n\nCabildo Insular de Tenerife (governing body of the island)\n\nCastle of St John the Baptist or Castillo Negro\n\nCastle of San Cristóbal\n\nCastle of San Andrés\n\nParlamento de Canarias (Parliament of the Canary Islands)\n\nMasonic Temple of Santa Cruz de Tenerife\n\nCommercial areas\n\n[edit]\n\nSanta Cruz is popular for its wide commercial offerings, including zona Centro (Central part) – Pedestrian calle Castillo, San José, del Pilar, Viera y Clavijo Zona Rambla (Rambla area) or Rambla de Pulido, calle Ramón y Cajal, and the big shopping centres and department stores in Avenida de 3 Mayo, plus the big malls in Añaza on the southern suburbs. The most upmarket and high street shopping is located along Calle del Pilar and nearby Parque Bulevar Shopping Centre, where many designer shops can be found. International and local brands of shops and restaurants are much present on the island. Not only the wide range of shops makes the city attractive but the lower prices found in many items, such as tobacco, alcohol, electronic devices, beauty products, sunglasses or even food or coffee. They are indeed much lower than in most cities of Western Europe including Spain, due to the very special and much lighter taxation on goods enjoyed on the Canary Islands.\n\nSports\n\n[edit]\n\nCD Tenerife: Founded in 1912, it currently plays in Segunda División, holding home matches at the Estadio Heliodoro Rodríguez López, with a 22,824-seat capacity.\n\nHonours: In 1991, Argentine Jorge Valdano took charge of the club as manager, and would help rob former side Real Madrid of two consecutive league titles in the last round, to the benefit of FC Barcelona; in the first season, the Canary Islands outfit barely avoided relegation, but would finish in a best-ever fifth position in the following year, eventually reaching the round of 16 in the subsequent UEFA Cup, losing to Juventus 2–4 on aggregate.
