        "text": "We attended the major international meeting held in Dubai to explain our road map that’s already in place and aims to reduce the carbon footprint of the Canary Islands tourism sector. To do this we’ve created “Journey to Decarbonisation”, the free digital tool for Canary Islands tourism companies to measure and reduce their emissions. We’ve led the way in addressing the commitments established in Glasgow for Net Zero by 2050, setting up measures to support the Canary Islands tourism industry and promote the objectives of the Declaration among tourism professionals, tourists and the people of the region.\n\nIn addition to being the only Spanish tourism destination present at the 28th United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP28), the Canary Islands are also the only Spanish region with a Climate Action Plan in place to reduce CO2 emissions in compliance with the Glasgow Declaration.\n\nAttending the world's leading climate conference allowed us to share our experiences and take part in a global action plan to work on specific solutions intended to achieve a decarbonised world. It also gave us the chance to learn more about the climate action plans of other Glasgow Declaration signatories and provide first-hand information to destinations around the world that are interested in signing.\n\nWe learned about the experience of tourism companies that are successfully reducing their carbon emissions, including a cruise company that operates in the Canary Islands and is aiming to have its first Net Zero ship by 2030, hotels designed to achieve climate neutrality right from their construction, and the artificial intelligence app for reducing food waste in tourism that’s already in place in the Islands.\n\nTurismo de Islas Canarias explained in Dubai the free “Journey to Decarbonisation” digital solution that provides companies with a carbon footprint calculator.\n\nIn Dubai we had the chance to explain “Journey to Decarbonisation”, the new digital solution now available to Canary Islands tourism companies, providing them with a free carbon footprint calculator, a self-diagnosis questionnaire, personalised recommendations, and downloadable resources to activate a climate action plan. Currently under production, the tool is available at sostenibilidad.canariasdestino.com.\n\nTo support small and medium size enterprises throughout the process, we’ve set up the Sustainability Office to provide specialist advice and answer queries about the tool through a webchat at sostenibilidad@canariasdestino.com. Training sessions will be available on environmental sustainability and the use of the tool, mainly for SMEs that have never measured their carbon footprint.\n\nCOP28\n\nThe United Nations Climate Change Conference was held at Expo City Dubai from 30 November to 12 December, and included the participation of the Canary Islands on 8, 10 and 11 December, with the presence of the Regional Ministry of Ecological Transition and Energy and the Regional Ministry of Tourism and Employment.\n\nUnder the umbrella of the World Tourism Organization (WTO), the Canary Islands attended alongside other signatories of the Glasgow Declaration, who now total 857 globally, although only 261 of these have a climate action plan, among them the Canary Islands."
