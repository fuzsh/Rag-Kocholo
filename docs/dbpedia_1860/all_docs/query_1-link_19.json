This page also provides access to the raw APRS packets and various other APRS related tools.\n\nRecent observations from this weather station can be downloaded as a CSV file suitable for importing into various spreadsheet programs: last 7 days, last 14 days, last 28 days, last 56 days. This data can also be linked directly from Excel using a Web Query. The main link goes to the page with the data on it, and the IQY link is the Web Query that will access it: last 7 days (IQY: last 7 days), last 14 days (IQY: last 14 days), last 28 days (IQY: last 28 days), last 56 days (IQY: last 56 days).\n\nAll the means and standard deviations shown below are from the last 28 days. Change analysis period to Last 3 days Last 7 days Last 14 days Last 8 weeks Last 13 weeks Last 26 weeks Last 39 weeks Last 52 weeks\n\nBy default, the longer analysis periods display graphs that show the long term performance of this station. The graphs show the mean error over time, and include error bars which are one standard deviation long. This provides an easy way to see if there are any underlying trends in the data. Note that a 'step' in your data does not (necessarily) mean that something happened to your station. It could mean that another station came online in the local area, and they are changing the analysis.\n\nThe analysis is performed by MADIS. This web page just provides visualization of the data that MADIS produces. There are a number of very knowledgeable people who participate on the WXQC Mailing List who do understand exactly how MADIS works and can resolve issues when the analysis seems to be broken. However, in most cases, the station readings are at fault, or the software that is transmitting the data to CWOP. Please check those paths first.\n\nYou can also see how this station compares with other stations.\n\nTemperature\n\n24 hoursAverage temperature error-Error standard deviation-\n\nNOTE: If the error above is POSITIVE, then it means that the analysis temperature is HIGHER than the reported temperature. This means that your sensor is reading COLDER than expected.\n\nMADIS\n\nrating\n\nLatest daily graph:\n\nNot enough data has been received to perform a day / night analysis to check for various types of shielding problems. Please wait a few days, and then try again.\n\nWind Vector\n\nThe wind vector is the average wind over the relevant period. Note that if the wind blows North for half the time at 2 knots, and then blows South for the other half of the time at 2 knots, then the result is zero -- i.e. North wind and South wind will cancel out. Over time, the direction of the wind and of the analysis should match pretty well. If the lengths of the vector are different, then it could mean either that your anemometer reads high or low, or that you are in a more shielded or more open space. MADIS\n\nrating\n\nTodayLast 7 days\n\nNeighboring Stations\n\nThis is a list of stations that are close to this station. Note that this is not the list of stations that are used in the data analysis. That list of stations is known only to MADIS. You can see all the stations at MADIS Data Display. Your station should be in the middle of the display. If you think that the analysis is incorrect, then maybe one of the close stations has failed.\n\nYou can look at those for comparison purposes. The average difference between your station and each station below is listed as well. This may allow you to detect local stations which are erroneous. You can also use these numbers to adjust your instruments -- especially if a number of ASOS stations have similar differences to your station. Also, try increasing the analysis period to more than the default 28 days. The difference is only given if both stations report reasonably often during each day. Some stations only report every 6 hours, and this makes the average of less interest. In this case, the average is not displayed. The values reported are the differences between this station and the neighboring station. I.e. if the difference is positive, then this station is reading higher than the neighboring station. Since this station has not been reporting continuously during the analysis period (it missed 1 days out of 28), the offsets below may not be accurate.\n\nYou can also subscribe to an RSS feed to tell you when new stations come online in this area.

The green check mark and red cross are chosen based on the average performance during the analysis period (which is selectable above). The red cross can appear even if MADIS reports that all observations pass the MADIS QC checks.\n\nThe 'MADIS rating' reports on the percentage of observations that pass the MADIS checks. You should aim for two thumbs up!\n\nLocation Formats\n\nThe location is shown in three different formats.
