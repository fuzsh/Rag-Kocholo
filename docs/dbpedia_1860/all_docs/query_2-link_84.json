        "text": "Boarding with some sense and communication. It was a total free-for-all everyone coming all at once, no organisation of row numbers or priority.\n\nHorrible, flight cancelled and had to come back the next day\n\nTerrible. For clarity - this was the Level flight to Boston. Not Vueling. Would urge customers to avoid this airline. Gate agent was singularly unhelpful. He was argumentative, rude and went out of his way to ensure that every penny was collected for the baggage (which we realized given how early we were for flight we could have saved hundreds of dollars if we checked in on app). No onboard entertainment or WiFi. Half of the front section was empty because the seats did not work! Plane was falling apart.\n\nNo complimentary snacks, but I think that‚Äôs a standard in the USA. There were loud drunk Germans sitting in front of us.\n\nGood standard flight the plan was clean could not complain the only thing is checking in the pushchair was very slow only 3 people at the counter.\n\nThe flight was delayed and nobody was able to inform me about the new scheduled time and gate\n\nIt is just fine but I am okat withi it is because for a 30$ flight I didn't expect anything more.\n\nThe whole flight was coughing and farting all the way. It was impossible to breathe. If people are traveling sick they should either not be allowed to fly or made wear masks\n\nJ'ai perdu le billet üéü faute de visa j'ai pas eu de remboursement. J voulais prendre un autre Est-ce que yaura une solution\n\nI will never fly vueling. 1h30 delayed, connexion missed with the crew closing the boarding in front of us. 40 people missed the Barcelona-Orly connexion. hours waiting for rebooking and hotel.. inadmissible\n\nAffordable and plenty of leg room. Left seat assignment up to airline for the benefit of reduction in cost. They split my family of four up into different rows, leaving a minor on her own. Grateful for cabin staff asking someone to move to allow daughter to sit with my wife.\n\nOn time and reasonably comfortable. These airlines need to find a way of sitting their passengers in queues whilst waiting to board\n\nDelayed flight. Received notice from ryanair by email and via app but no such timely information available at airport from monitors or staff\n\nThe worst experience ever, really. First we had booked a flight at noon with about 6 months in advance. A month before the flight they cancelled it and rescheduled us on a flight a 21:00 hs which would ruin our day completely. Nevertheless, we had no option but to accept as any other option was economically unviable with so short notice. We arrived on time as requested to the airpor. Actually arrived 3 hours earlier. We waited there and it started to be delayed a few minutes, then an hour and a half and so son. Flight ended up boarding at 23:15. Once the doors were closed, the captain announced 1:30 more hours delay to start our trip. Also, as per ‚Äúinternational rules‚Äù they said they couldn‚Äôt offer water or anything alike. After about 30 minutes, and against those rules, they started SELLING WATER BOTTLES FOR 3‚Ç¨ each. 500ml bottles. Flight departed at about 01:44 am and after a go around in Bergamo because he was at about 700 feet AGL and still not stable, the pilot performed a go around, landing at the same runway minutes later. Crew, both pilots and flight attendants, were professional and I told them I feel sorry for them having to deal with this everyday as it‚Äôs not their fault, but they‚Äôre the visible side of the airline to the passengers. Bags arrived promptly but we took our Uber at 03:55 am. Ryanair, never again! (It could be their slogan, but it‚Äôs probably too good for them).\n\nFlight delayed. Sat for more than 30 min with no air conditioning on a very hot day.\n\nFull flight but no issues. Had priority boarding and everything was fine\n\nThis was yet another excellent experience thanks to Ryanair, it's ground crew, cabin crew and air crew. Although our flight was delayed by about 15 minutes due to the late arrival of the inbound flight, the crew did their best to successfully minimise the delay with courtesy and efficiency. I also commend Ryanair for its choice of destination airport in this instance: Seve Ballesteros Airport in Santander is a modern, compact, well-kep and well-organised airport, where passing through security and passport control was a doodle thanks to its friendly and efficient staff. So take a bow, Ryanair - and keep it up!\n\nWorse situation ever. Arriving at 4 am with 7 Hours of delay\n\nBooked extra legroom seats but as plane had changed we ended up with normal seats. Very little attempt from staff to sort it out\n\nThe flight departed and arrived on time. A member of the staff at the gate was awful. She asked me to get the duty free purchases out of the hand luggage to see if it would fit inside their box, which it did. It was the embarrassment in front of the other passengers and the hassle of getting my stuff out of the bag and back in again that was totally unnecessary. They try to squeeze every single euro they can get out of their passengers. The seats were uncomfortable with little space in between them. The flight was quite noisy with lots of announcements trying to sell food, drinks, gifts and souvenirs etc."
