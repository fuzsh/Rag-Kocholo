        "text": "Santa Cruz de Tenerife Guide\n\nLocated on the Spanish island of Tenerife, one of the Canary Islands, the city of Santa Cruz de Tenerife is the joint capital of the Canary Islands, along with Las Palmas. The city is usually just called Santa Cruz and is located in the north east of Tenerife, around 210 km off the north western coast of Africa. Located in the city is the Parliament of the Canary Islands, the Canarian Ministry of the Presidency, which is shared on a 4 year term with Las Palmas, half of the Ministries and Boards of the Canarian Government (the other half is in Gran Canaria), the Tenerife Provincial Courts and two courts of the Superior Court of Justice of the Canary Islands.\n\nThe city's port plays an important role in trade between Europe, Africa and the Americas. The city is the focus for domestic and inter-island communications in the Canary Islands. Ferry services from the port depart to mainland Spain, the rest of the Canary Islands and beyond.\n\nLas Palmas Guide\n\nThe Spanish city of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria is the capital of the island of Gran Canaria, in the Canary Islands. The city lies in the north eastern part of the island and sits across two bays and a number of lovely beaches. The city was founded in 1478 and has an important cultural and historical heritage which seems to be centred in the district of Vegueta which is the oldest part of the city and was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1990. The city is also home to one of the most important ports, Puerto de la Luz, in Europe which helps to give the city a lovely cosmopolitan feel. There are many things to see and do in the city but a short distance away from the city's centre visitors will find lovely beaches and crystal clear waters.\n\nFrom the city's port ferry services provide connections to several islands (Fuerteventura, Lanzarote, La Palma, Tenerife) and also the south of Spain (Huelva and Cadiz)."
