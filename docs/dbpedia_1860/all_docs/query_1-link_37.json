        "text": "About the map series\n\nThe MTN50 (Mapa Topográfico Nacional) series from CNIG (The Centro Nacional de Información Geografica) provide topographic coverage of mainland Spain at 1:50,000 – the Spanish equivalent of the Ordnance Survey Landranger series.\n\nEach map covers approximately 29x18 km. The maps have a 1-km UTM grid, plus margin ticks for latitude and longitude at 1' intervals. The map legend is in Spanish only.\n\nCNIG also produce a series of maps covering the country at 1:25,000 scale which can be found here\n\nHow to find the right map\n\nUse the 50k map index below to find the number(s) you are after. Once found, either use our search at the top of the page or follow these links to the relevant subset of map numbers\n\n0001-0100, 0101-0200, 0201-0300, 0301-0400, 0401-0500, 0501-0600, 0601-0700, 0701-0800, 0801-0900, 0901-1000, 1000-1111\n\nWe recognise that this isn’t as intuitive as we would like so if you do find yourself struggling, please do get in contact or give us a call on +44(0)1380 72 72 28\n\nMap index\n\nClick on the map below and an index of that zone will open in a new window.\n\nDelivery\n\nAll items that are in stock will show a delivery timescale of 1-3 working days. If your order consists solely of these items, then dispatch is within 1 working day of purchase with the exception of framed and customised items which may take up to 14 days.\n\nIf your order is a non-stock item, the delivery timescale on that item will show as 3-10 working days on the product details. In these instances, dispatch is usually 3-7 working days with delivery in 5-10 working days. If your item is delayed for any reason, we will update your order to provide an explanation of the delay, although it is not always possible to say how long the delay will be. The item will be kept on order for up to three months and supplied to you when it becomes available. After 3 months, we will cancel the order or the remainder of the order unless you ask us to keep it on back order for longer. Incomplete orders will be held until the remaining items come into stock, unless we anticipate a long delay. At our discretion, incomplete orders may be sent out as partial shipments if we anticipate that an item may take some time coming in to stock.\n\nEU customers - IMPORTANT: You will be required to pay import VAT (tax) at your local rate to your postal delivery service before any goods are delivered. Since 2021 you have not been charged British VAT (at 20%) on any purchases or P&P charges, however, with effect from 1 January 2022, the rules regarding importing from outside the EU changed and import VAT is now payable on any value of goods imported into the EU. This is separate to any tariff which may or may not be chargeable on the goods due to their country of origin. Please also note that we are legally required to declare the correct value of your purchase which is used to calculate the tax and any tariff duty. Failure to pay the import charges will result in the goods being returned to the UK. Our terms and conditions have been updated to reflect this situation.\n\nSee full details of our Delivery Details here\n\nCancellations - non personalised/bespoke items\n\nThe Consumer Contracts (Information, Cancellation and Additional Charges) Regulations 2013 (formerly the Distance Selling Regulations) provide consumers with the right to a 'cooling-off' period to allow you to change your mind. Under these regulations, you have the right to cancel your order, without explanation, within 14 days of delivery (starting the day after you receive the goods) and to return the goods for a refund within a further 14 days (28 days in total). The Distance Selling Regulations do not apply to businesses nor to individuals who are trading or acting as a trader (buying goods to re-sell for profit) because no-one is the 'Consumer'. This means there is no 'cooling-off' period and the order cannot be cancelled once processed.\n\nSee full details of our Returns Information here\n\nCancellations - personalised/bespoke items\n\nWhere an order is placed for an item which is to be personalised or is bespoke, cancellation is not possible once production has started and these are expressly excluded from The Consumer Contracts (Information, Cancellation and Additional Charges) Regulations 2013 (formerly the Distance Selling Regulations).\n\nAll transaction information passed between Guy's Magnets Ltd T/A MapsWorldwide and Sage Pay’s systems is encrypted using 128-bit SSL certificates. No cardholder information is ever passed un-encrypted and any messages sent to our servers from Sage Pay are signed using MD5 hashing to prevent tampering. You can be completely assured that nothing we pass to Sage Pay’s servers can be examined, used or modified by any third parties attempting to gain access to sensitive information.\n\nOnce the information is in Sage Pay's systems, all sensitive data is secured using the same internationally recognised 256-bit encryption standards used by, among others, the US Government.

The data we hold is extremely secure and we are regularly audited by the banks and banking authorities to ensure it remains so.\n\nSage Pay’s systems are scanned quarterly by Trustwave which are an independent Qualified Security Assessor (QSA) and an Approved Scanning Vendor (ASV) for the payment card brands.
