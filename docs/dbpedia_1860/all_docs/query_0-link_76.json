        "text": "Although the island of Tenerife is part of Spain, it is situated west of Africa in the Atlantic Ocean and many kilometres from the capital Madrid. The Canary Islands, which consist of the main islands of Fuerteventura, Gran Canaria, Lanzarote, La Palma, La Gomera, El Hierro and, of course, Tenerife, are located approximately on the latitude where Morocco borders the territory of the Western Sahara. The latter is the largest and most populous island in the world and has great differences between north and south. This can be an advantage for visitors as well as anyone who is planning to spend a holiday in Tenerife because different activities are possible all year round. Many of these are presented in more detail in this article. If you are still looking for a suitable holiday accommodation, take a look at this selection of apartments.\n\nIt is most usual for visitors to travel to Tenerife by plane because the island has two international airports, one in the north and one in the south. Tenerife South Airport is the largest of them. However, it is also possible to arrive by ferry. Although, from the Spanish mainland, the crossing takes almost two days.\n\nWeather in Tenerife\n\nIn Tenerife, there is a pleasant and warm climate all year round due to the trade winds and the Canary Stream. In fact, nowhere in the world is the difference so small between summer and winter temperatures, which is an average of 24 and 15 degrees, respectively. This is why Tenerife is often referred to as the island of eternal spring. It is also subdivided into two distinct climatic zones by the mountain Pico del Teide, the highest elevation in Spain at 3,718 metres. The warmest is usually in the south and west, while the east and north are somewhat windier.\n\nWeather: Tenerife South\n\nThe south is more sunny, dryer and warmer than the north, which is why most holidaymakers opt for this part of the island. However, rainfall can also occur there, as the microclimate is still very different in the south.\n\nWeather: Tenerife North\n\nIn contrast to the partially desert-based south, the north of the island is generally greener and more often cloudy. In addition to the more frequent rainfall, especially the strong winds are characteristic for the north.\n\nTenerife Beach Holidays\n\nThe island has numerous idyllic beaches with various types of sand, most of which is dark and volcanic in origin. On the beautiful beaches you can surf, dive, whale and dolphin watch and much more. The warm and calm water is, of course, also ideal for swimming. Most of the beaches are close to the tourist resorts and are characterised by the cleanliness and good supply of toilets, showers, sun beds and umbrellas.\n\nTenerife South\n\nOn the south coast of Tenerife are the two most famous resorts: Playa de las Américas and Los Cristianos. A lot of bathing enthusiasts choose their beaches, which is why there is an extremely wide range of leisure activities. Playa de las Américas leads to the town of Arona. Here, there is a white sandy beach, which is one of the safest on the island and is, therefore, ideal for children. In addition, there is, of course, a wide selection of dining options.\n\nTenerife North\n\nIt is not just the south which boasts fantastic beaches, as the north also has a lot to offer. One of the most popular is Playa de las Teresitas in the region around the capital Santa Cruz. The El Bollullo beach in La Orotava is considered one of the most peaceful on the island. The dark sand stretches far in the protected bay of Playa San Marcos in Icod de Los Vinos. In the holiday centre of Puerto de la Cruz is the beach Playa Jardín, surrounded by colourful gardens, palm trees and a great water park.\n\nEast Coast\n\nTo the east is the beautiful beach area of El Médano, where the world championship in kitesurfing took place. The fantastic waves, which are ideal for daring jumps and tricks, attract many other water sports enthusiasts from all over the world. The beach of the capital Santa Cruz de Tenerife was rebuilt in 1973 to make it safer. Originally, the sand was actually black, but today it is almost completely white. If it gets too hot in the sun, you can make yourself comfortable in the shade of a palm tree. Although the wind in Santa Cruz is often very strong, the beach is one of the most visited on the island. The water usually remains calm and is, therefore, suitable for swimming.\n\nWest Coast\n\nThe pristine beaches of Costa Adeje are among the best on the island and contribute to their reputation as an impressive holiday destination. Playa de Fanabe offers a fine sandy beach stretching 700 metres. There is a 2-level beach promenade, which invites you to relax within numerous bars and restaurants.\n\nAt the foot of the Teno Mountains, in the north-west of Tenerife, lies the picturesque village of Masca, surrounded by a beautiful landscape dominated by the Masca Gorge. At the northern end of this canyon is Buenavista del Norte, with a 400-metre long and 15-metre wide hidden beach with black sand and calm water. The beach can only be reached after a 4-kilometre hike or by boat.\n\nTo the south of Masca lie the towns of Acantilado de Los Gigantes and Playa de la Arena, famous for their steep coastlines and their excellent sandy beach.\n\nConnection to the other Canary Islands\n\nLos Cristianos, a lively place with beautiful beaches and a busy port, can be reached from the south of the island of Tenerife, where you can take trips and various excursions. There is also a ferry which takes you to the neighbouring island of La Gomera. The ferry is located in the main port of San Sebastián de La Gomera. Alternatively, you can take a longer crossing to the smallest of the seven large Canary Islands, El Hierro, and after about two and a half to three hours to Puerto de la Estaca.\n\nIn the north-west of the Canary Islands is La Palma, the most wooded of the islands. Of the almost 90,000 inhabitants, about 17,000 live in the capital Santa Cruz de La Palma. From there, you can travel to Gran Canaria.\n\nThe probably most famous of the Canary Islands impresses visitors with an incredibly diverse landscape, which is often described as a continent in the miniature format. On the island, tourists will find everything from vibrant nightlife in Las Palmas de Gran Canaria to tropical forests to fascinating beaches. In the north-west of the island is the village of Agaete, which impresses with its many white houses, which are a strong contrast to the dark sand.\n\nLocated in the north-east of the Canary Islands, Lanzarote can be reached via the international airport south of the capital Arrecife or by ferry from Cádiz or from the other islands of Gran Canaria and Fuerteventura. The latter offers a fascinating combination of the volcanic and desert landscape. In addition, especially the north around Puerto del Rosario is a true paradise for surfers."
