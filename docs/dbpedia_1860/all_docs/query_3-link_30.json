        "text": "In the vibrant archipelago of the Spanish Canary Islands stands the mighty Teide National Park (PNT), home to the highest volcano in Spain and one of the largest in the world. This unique enclave, declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is a living canvas showcasing the powerful volcanic activity that shaped the island of Tenerife. Through this article, we invite you to immerse yourself in the natural and cultural richness that defines Teide, a place where science, history, and traditions converge in an environment of incomparable beauty.\n\nFacts about Teide National Park\n\nBrief History of Teide National Park\n\nTeide National Park, located on the island of Tenerife, Canary Islands, has profound historical and cultural value. For the island’s ancient inhabitants, the Guanches, this place had significant spiritual importance, being even fundamental for their subsistence at certain times of the year. During the summers, herding and livestock concentration in the area were abundant, demonstrating the relevance that Teide had in the lives of these people.\n\nThe archaeological sites found in the park are testimonies of ancient human presence in the area, revealing the importance that Teide had in Guanche mythology. For them, Teide was known as \"Echeyde,\" the abode of Guayota, the Evil One, according to legend. It is said that Guayota kidnapped the god of the Sun, plunging the island into darkness until Achamán, the supreme sky god, managed to defeat him and free the Sun, sealing the volcano’s mouth with Guayota inside.\n\nTeide’s volcanic history is also impressive. The last major eruption in 1798, which formed the Narices del Teide, spewed millions of cubic meters of lava for three months from Pico Viejo, leaving a towering mark on the landscape.\n\nIn terms of conservation and international recognition, the PNT has reached significant milestones. From its reclassification in 1981 and the awarding of the European Diploma in 1989 to its designation as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2007, this park has received special attention and care. Its area has increased over time, reaching its current size of 18,900 hectares in 1999.\n\nAdditionally, it has been recognized as one of the 12 national parks of Spain since late 2007. Its Atmospheric Research Center in Izaña records remarkable figures, being the place with the most hours of sunshine in Spain in 2007 and also where the lowest average temperature was recorded.\n\nLocation of Teide in the Canary Islands (Tenerife, Spain)\n\nTeide National Park is located on the island of Tenerife, which is part of the Canary Islands, an autonomous community of Spain. More specifically, it is situated in the province of Santa Cruz de Tenerife, at the geographical coordinates: Latitude: 28° 20′ 42″ N, 16° 43′ 49″ W and Longitude: 28° 11′ 23″ N, 16° 28′ 55″ W.\n\nThe geographical coordinates of the park are 28°15′00″N latitude and 16°37′00″W longitude.\n\nEstablishment of the National Park\n\nUnder the joint administration of the Government of Spain and the Government of the Canary Islands. It holds a level of protection as a national park and was created on January 22, 1954. A total of 41 years before other Spanish parks like the Sierra de las Nieves National Park, the latter located on the Iberian Peninsula.\n\nThe park covers an area of 189.9 square kilometers and comprises territory belonging to 13 municipalities.\n\nIn 2018, the park received 4,330,994 visitors.\n\nTotal Protected Area\n\nTotal area: 18,990.00 ha.\n\nProtection zone: 7,374.32 ha.\n\nSocioeconomic influence area: 127,958.28 ha.\n\nRecognition of Teide as a UNESCO World Heritage Site\n\nTeide National Park has been recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. In 2007, it was inscribed on the World Heritage List during the 31st session of UNESCO. This recognition is granted due to its exceptional natural values, meeting UNESCO criteria VII and VIII.\n\nThe region to which it belongs, according to UNESCO, is Europe and North Africa. Its identification as a World Heritage Site carries the number 1258.\n\nThe Most Visited Spanish Destination Annually\n\nTeide National Park is the most visited destination in Spain, attracting a large number of visitors each year. For accommodation, it features the Parador de Turismo de Las Cañadas del Teide. According to 2004 data, with 3.5 million annual visits, it is the most visited volcanic site in the world, only surpassed by Mount Fuji in Japan.\n\nIn terms of volcanic landscape, Teide complements Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, as both represent volcanic structures and forms from the least evolved magmas (Hawaii) to the most differentiated and evolved (Teide). On the other hand, landscape-wise, it shares similarities with the Grand Canyon National Park in Arizona, United States.\n\nSpace Research in Teide National Park in Tenerife\n\nTeide has become a notable scientific interest due to the similarities it presents with the environmental and geological conditions of the planet Mars. These analogies have led to this volcanic enclave being used as a reference in studies related to the red planet.\n\nThe conditions found in some areas of Tenerife, reminiscent of those on the planet Mars, make the island an ideal place to carry out tests of instruments to be sent to Mars on space missions. A notable example was in 2010, when a research team tested the Raman instrument in Las Cañadas del Teide, which would be sent on the next expedition to the red planet, the ESA-NASA Exomars mission, which took place between 2016 and 2018.\n\nIn 2011, another team of researchers from the United Kingdom visited the national park in June to test a method for searching for life on Mars. Their goal was to find suitable places to test new robotic vehicles in 2012. This connection between the park and space research highlights the importance and scientific value of this unique environment.\n\nAwards and Certifications of the Park\n\nTeide National Park has received numerous awards and certifications throughout its history. Among the most notable recent distinctions are:\n\n1989: Council of Europe Diploma for Conservation, renewed in 1994, 1999, and 2004.\n\n1995: Environmental Award, in the Institutions category, awarded by the Island Council of Tenerife.\n\n1996: Decoration of Tourist Merit by the Ministry of Commerce and Tourism.\n\n1999: Amables del Turismo y Convivencia Ciudadana Award, awarded by the Center for Initiatives and Tourism of Santa Cruz de Tenerife.\n\n2005: ISO 14001 Environmental Certification.\n\n2006: Implementation of the Community Eco-Management and Audit Scheme (EMAS).\n\n2007: Designation as a World Heritage Site and inclusion in the Natura 2000 Network.\n\nInternational Collaborations with Other National Parks Worldwide\n\nThe park’s administration actively participates in various international advisory and exchange programs with other national parks around the world, especially in Central and South America. Through the EUROPARC-Spain Federation, it also collaborates with other national parks in Europe. In terms of international cooperation, Teide National Park has provided technical support to Souss-Massa National Park, located in southwestern Morocco.\n\nGeography and Geology of Teide\n\nGeomorphologically, Teide National Park consists of two large depressions crowned by the towering Teide volcano, which rises mightily to 3715 meters above sea level. This landscape is marked by numerous lava flows from various volcanic eruptions, intermingling with mountains and volcanoes scattered throughout the park, creating a unique and characteristic panorama. Emblematic points such as Alto de Guajara, Llano de Ucanca, Las Siete Cañadas, La Fortaleza, Los Roques de García, and Pico Viejo (also known as Chahorra) stand out, contributing to the natural beauty of this place.\n\nThe park’s flora has been studied by renowned scientists such as Alexander von Humboldt and Eric R. Sventenius. It hosts endemic species of insular, regional, and local character, and houses 11 habitats of community interest, occupying approximately 75% of its surface. Additionally, the importance of its invertebrate fauna stands out, both in terms of the number of species and exclusivity.\n\nIn terms of volcanic landscape, Teide National Park complements Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, as both represent volcanic structures and forms from the least evolved magmas (Hawaii) to the most differentiated and evolved (Teide). On the other hand, landscape-wise, it shares similarities with the Grand Canyon National Park in Arizona, United States.\n\nTeide Volcano: Lava Flows and Highest Peak in Spain\n\nTeide National Park presents a surreal volcanic landscape, with rock formations that tell the geological story of millions of years. The diversity of textures and colors is a testament to the dynamic nature of the earth.\n\nTeide, at 3,718 meters, dominates the landscape of Tenerife, being the highest peak in Spain. Its formation is the result of intense volcanic activities that have sculpted the surrounding landscape, creating a unique environment, which is why this area is maintained with the highest protection in the country.\n\nThe Crater of Teide\n\nThe crater of Teide is an 80-meter diameter cone that rises to 3,718 meters, making the volcano the highest mountain in Spain and the Atlantic archipelagos.\n\nThe most recent eruption on the island of Tenerife occurred in 1909, outside the National Park. Although the Teide volcano has shown activity on various occasions, it currently appears to be in a state of dormancy, as indicated by the fumaroles emerging from the crater. These fumaroles are gas emissions that can reach temperatures of up to 100ºC. Their composition is dominated by water vapor and carbon dioxide, along with certain sulfur compounds that, upon crystallizing, give the gas emission areas a characteristic yellow-green color where they are deposited.\n\nThe fumaroles and sulfur cover the crater of Teide and can be observed closely when ascending to the summit. From the mid-16th century to the early 20th century, sulfur and ice were extracted from the summit of Teide when it snowed.\n\nOther Geological Features of Interest\n\nIn addition to Teide, the park hosts a variety of geological structures, including lava fields, volcanic cones, and lava tubes, providing an invaluable window into the geological processes of our planet.\n\nBiodiversity in Teide\n\nEndemic Flora of Teide\n\nTeide National Park is a sanctuary for endemic flora, with species adapted to the extreme conditions of its volcanic environment, many of which are found nowhere else in the world.\n\nThe park’s flora has been studied by renowned scientists such as Alexander von Humboldt and Eric R. Sventenius. It hosts endemic species of insular, regional, and local character, and contains 11 habitats of community interest, occupying approximately 75% of its surface. Additionally, the importance of its invertebrate fauna stands out, both in terms of the number of species and exclusivity.\n\nA total of 194 species of higher plants have been recorded in the protected area of Teide. Of these, 58 are considered endemic to the Canary Islands. According to the National Catalog of Endangered Species, three plant species are endangered, while another twelve are in a vulnerable situation.\n\nMany of these endemisms find refuge in the walls and cavities formed by the stones of Las Cañadas, contributing to their conservation. Notable species include the red tajinaste (Echium wildpretii), the jara of Las Cañadas (Cistus osbeckifolius), the Guanche rose, the Teide wallflower (Erysimum scoparium), the hierba pajonera (Descurainia bourgaeana), the Teide broom (Cytisus supranubius), and the rare Helianthemum juliae. Above 2400 meters of altitude grows the Teide violet (Viola cheiranthyfolia), a fragile and delicate plant that is part of the group of plants that bloom at the highest altitude in the entire national territory.\n\nFauna in Teide: Birds, Insects, Reptiles, and Other Wildlife\n\nThe fauna of Teide, although less visible, plays a crucial role in the park’s ecosystem. Birds such as the kestrel, unique insects, and reptiles like the Tenerife lizard coexist in this otherworldly landscape.\n\nBeing a volcanic site, the great diversity of animal species is surprising, some of which inhabit there temporarily or permanently throughout the year. Among these species are the hoopoe, the great grey shrike, the Canary Islands pipit, the long-eared owl, the canary, the common kestrel, rabbits, crows, the Sardinian warbler, the spectacled warbler, sparrowhawks, the blue tit, the Tenerife lizard, the grey wagtail, blackbirds, chiffchaffs, the Canary long-eared bat, the rock dove, the Barbary partridge, the Delalande’s gecko, the robin, the blue chaffinch, mice, turtledoves, the plain swift, the mouflon, the North African hedgehog, the Teide pimelia beetle, and the feral cat.\n\nAdaptations to the Volcanic Environment\n\nLife on Teide has developed fascinating adaptations to survive, from deep roots seeking nutrients beneath the volcanic surface to specialized reproductive strategies to cope with the extreme climate.\n\nClimate in Teide and on the Island of Tenerife Where It Is Located\n\nThe climate of the National Park is determined by the extreme altitude conditions, intense sun exposure, and significant temperature variations.\n\nThe climate in Teide National Park varies drastically with altitude, offering arid zones to alpine conditions at the highest peaks, characterizing it as a continental subalpine climate, very different from the predominant climate in the low and mid zones of the island.\n\nCovering the slopes of Teide with clouds, both in winter and summer, rainfall in the park is scarce, barely around 400 mm per year, with snowfalls occurring approximately for fifteen days annually. These snowfalls, along with low temperatures and intense nighttime frosts, keep the National Park covered in snow for several months a year. This lack of precipitation indicates pronounced dryness.\n\nOn the hottest days, temperatures can reach 34°C, while at night, especially in winter, they can drop drastically to -16°C. Additionally, there are large daily temperature fluctuations, which can reach up to 12°C. These extreme conditions, along with the numerous frosty days that can be up to 100 a year, can be partly attributed to the intense solar radiation in such a clear atmosphere. The average monthly temperatures range from 4.6°C in January to 18.3°C in August, with an annual average of 10.9°C.\n\nAdding to these conditions are the strong and fast winds that sometimes hit the peaks at speeds of up to 200 km/h, making survival difficult for any form of life in these inhospitable yet beautiful landscapes.\n\nDuring the cold season, it is common to encounter a peculiar phenomenon known as \"cencellada,\" consisting of large ice crystals, up to 15 centimeters, that cover the leaves of the plants.\n\nWhat to See and Do in Teide: Activities and Tourist Attractions\n\nAscent to Pico del Teide by Cable Car\n\nOne of the most exciting experiences awaiting you in the National Park is riding the cable car. The base station is at an altitude of 2,356m, and the upper station is at 3,555m. The transit between stations lasts about 8 minutes, and the sensation is electrifying. Once the ride is over, you will enjoy extraordinary views from the viewpoint.\n\nEven if you take the cable car to the upper station, you cannot yet say that you have been to the highest point in Spain. From here, a trail starts to ascend to the crater on foot. It takes about 40 minutes and is quite challenging, but you will be able to boast to your friends that you reached the roof of the country on foot. If you are lucky enough to find a clear day, you can marvel at the view of up to four islands from the top of this impressive massif: Gran Canaria, La Palma, El Hierro, and La Gomera, in addition to the island of Tenerife itself, which will be proudly displayed at your feet.\n\nTo enjoy this unforgettable experience, you need to obtain a special permit, which can be requested on the website www.reservasparquesnacionales.es.\n\nIt is advisable to book one or two months in advance, depending on the time of year. The permit is free and only valid for the selected date. If the visit cannot be made due to weather conditions or other reasons, the permit expires. If you spend the night at the Altavista Refuge, you will not need to obtain the access permit to Pico del Teide to see the sunrise. However, you must have left the trail before nine in the morning. That is, get up early, go up, and come down as soon as possible! We assure you it is worth it.\n\nThe ascent on foot starting from Montaña Blanca. This route has a total length of about 9 kilometers and can take between 6 and 7 hours to complete.\n\nInstituto de Astrofísica de Canarias\n\nIn few places in the world can you find an extraordinary landscape that also hosts top-tier scientific facilities. The Instituto de Astrofísica de Canarias (IAC) has some of the most important facilities worldwide. If you are interested in exploring the secrets of the Universe, you can visit these facilities and get to know them up close. The company Volcano Life offers guided tours in Spanish, English, and German, by reservation through the phone number 637 365 429 or the email [email protected]. If you were already amazed by the magnificence of Teide National Park, delving into the mysteries of the cosmos will make you understand our true insignificance in the universe.\n\nThe Observatory is located in Tenerife because, along with La Palma, Chile, and Hawaii, it has one of the best skies in the world for astronomical observation. An autonomous law, known as the Sky Law, regulates light pollution and preserves for the inhabitants of Tenerife one of the most wonderful small natural pleasures: gazing at the starry sky. Additionally, the island has the international certification as a Starlight destination. There are institutions and companies specialized in \"star tourism\" that offer information and guided routes for those who wish to explore this fascinating facet of Tenerife. In the Star Observation section, you will find more detailed information on this topic.\n\nThanks to its clear and clean skies, Teide is a privileged destination for stargazing, with activities ranging from night tours to visits to the Teide Observatory.\n\nTrails and Trekking Routes\n\nThe park offers an extensive network of trails that allow visitors to explore its natural richness on foot, with routes varying in difficulty and offering spectacular views of the volcano and beyond.\n\nIn Teide National Park, maintaining close contact with its wild nature is possible thanks to a wide Trail Network that allows you to explore the area through self-guided routes or with the assistance of official guides. These routes are available every day of the year, except January 1 and 6 and December 25. The trails vary in length, duration, and difficulty, so you can choose the one that best suits your preferences and abilities.\n\nIf you opt for a guided route, you must request it at the National Park office from Monday to Friday, from 9:00 to 14:00 hours, by calling 922 92 23 71, sending an email to [email protected], or visiting the National Park Visitor Centers.\n\nFrom the Portillo Office, located in the park area, several guided routes depart, such as Arenas Negras, La Fortaleza, and Risco Verde, with different durations and departure times.\n\nAt the Cañada Blanca Visitor Center, guided routes also depart to places such as Roques de García, Degollada de Guajara, and Guajara, with specific departure times.\n\nAdditionally, from both the Portillo Office and the Cañada Blanca Visitor Center, the guided route of Siete Cañadas is offered in one direction only.\n\nIf you prefer to explore the Park at your own pace, enjoying the silence and grandeur that surrounds you, the trails are perfectly marked so you can navigate them autonomously. In any case, in the office and visitor centers, you will always find additional information that may be of interest to you.\n\nJardín Botánico de Tenerife\n\nLocated near the El Portillo Visitor Center, the Botanical Garden offers the opportunity to admire a variety of plant species native to the high mountains of the Canary Islands, some of which are difficult to find in their natural habitat. Many of these plants are endemic to the Canary Islands or the island of Tenerife.\n\nSpending the Night at the Altavista Refuge and Climbing Pico del Teide for 10€\n\nIf you want to immerse yourself even more in the environment of Teide National Park, we recommend staying at the Altavista Refuge. Situated at an altitude of 3,270 meters, spending the night here is quite an experience, although only one night of stay is allowed. Many visitors choose to spend the night in this refuge to be able to access the crater early without needing a permit and thus witness a truly memorable sunrise from the summit. Upon arrival at the refuge, guests receive bedding and have access to a kitchen where they can heat liquid foods. Rates vary between 10 and 20 euros.\n\nBy spending the night at the Altavista Refuge, you do not need to request an access permit to Pico del Teide to witness the sunrise. However, you must leave the trail before nine in the morning. In summary, get up early, go up, and come down as soon as possible! We guarantee that the experience is worth it.\n\nEl Portillo Visitor Center\n\nThe El Portillo Visitor Center, located 11.1 km from the Teide Cable Car, offers a unique opportunity to delve into the history of Teide National Park from the dawn of the formation of the Canary Islands.\n\nThis center has an exhibition hall that allows visitors to explore various aspects of the park, as well as a corridor that simulates a volcanic tube, providing an immersive experience in the region’s geology. Additionally, it features a large model that represents the island of Tenerife in detail.\n\nA notable feature of the El Portillo Visitor Center is its seamless integration with the surrounding volcanic landscape. Moreover, it houses a Botanical Garden where more than 75% of the plant species present in the park, including the iconic tajinastes, can be admired.\n\nRoques de García\n\nThe Roques de García, located 4.5 km from the Teide Cable Car, are one of the park’s most emblematic attractions. These rock formations are widely known and photographed for their unique beauty and are situated in front of the Parador de Turismo, attracting numerous visitors with the impressive views they offer of the volcano.\n\nLocated in Llano de Ucanca, the Roques de García offer several trails to explore their splendor from different perspectives. Among the most notable formations are La Catedral and La Cascada, but the most famous of all is Roque Cinchado, immortalized by its appearance on the 1,000 peseta bill featuring Benito Pérez Galdós.\n\nArenas Negras\n\nArenas Negras is a trail located 11.1 km from the Teide Cable Car, starting at the El Portillo Visitor Center. This trail ascends the Montaña del Cerrillar among brooms, offering hikers the opportunity to enjoy a beautiful panoramic view of the park and Llano de Maja. On clear days, it is possible to glimpse the silhouette of La Palma in the distance. It is an excellent option for those wondering what to see near Teide, as from this point it is likely to see the sea of clouds commonly formed in the north of the island.\n\nTeide National Park Viewpoints\n\nGiven the towering presence of the volcano, it is natural to include the most prominent viewpoints located in different parts of the National Park in the list of places to visit near Teide.\n\nNarices Viewpoint\n\nThe Mirador de las Narices del Teide is a must-stop if you are visiting Tenerife. The term \"Narices del Teide\" refers to the two mouths through which the 1798 eruption occurred, leaving a landscape marked by lava extending to Chavao.\n\nThis viewpoint, located within the protected area, offers spectacular views of Pico Viejo and is especially recommended for watching both sunrises and sunsets, particularly during the autumn and winter months.\n\nTo reach the Mirador de las Narices, you must take the TF-38 road. If you are heading from Vilaflor, one of the attractions in southern Tenerife, this viewpoint is located after the Boca Tauce viewpoint, which I will discuss next.\n\nZapatilla de la Reina Viewpoint\n\n8.4 km from the Teide Cable Car.\n\nThis viewpoint, the result of millennia of erosion, presents a peculiar formation that resembles a high-heeled shoe (or at least that is how popular imagination interprets it). Located in the southern part of the National Park, it offers a unique perspective of the volcanic cone.\n\nBoca Tauce Viewpoint\n\nLocated a bit farther away, 10.8 km from Teide, this viewpoint is situated at the intersection of two roads: one leading to Vilaflor and the other to Chío. From here, you can observe the impressive volcanic flows generated by the last eruption of the Pico Viejo volcano in 1798.\n\nPico Viejo Viewpoint\n\nThis viewpoint is located on the slope of the Teide volcano, offering a privileged view of the mighty Pico Viejo, the second-highest volcano in Tenerife, with an altitude of 3,100 meters.\n\nLlano de Ucanca Viewpoint\n\nLocated 6.4 km from the cable car, the Llano de Ucanca viewpoint is situated in one of the largest plains in Teide National Park. From here, you can see the two highest volcanoes in the area and the iconic Roques de García. In winter, when it snows, the landscape takes on a special beauty with the contrast between the white snow and the blue sky.\n\nRoques de García Viewpoint\n\nLocated 4.5 km from the cable car, this viewpoint offers a privileged view of the impressive rock formations rising at one end of Llano de Ucanca. It is a must-stop to enjoy the beauty of the landscape, where the volcano stands out on the horizon. Besides the main panorama, there is another viewpoint, known as Mirador de la Ruleta, from where you can see the plain and La Catedral, a particularly interesting rock formation to explore up close.\n\nTabonal Negro Viewpoint\n\nThis viewpoint offers an excellent panoramic view of the Siete Cañadas and is especially recommended for observing the blooming tajinastes in spring. Located 2.1 km from the Teide cable car.\n\nThe name \"Tabonal Negro\" comes from a sharp stone called \"tabona,\" which has a characteristic dark color and was used by the Guanches to make cutting tools.\n\nMirador Minas de San José\n\nThis viewpoint owes its name to the old mineral extraction facilities that once existed in the area, 4.9 km from the cable car. The highlight here is the stunning aridity of the surrounding volcanic landscape, which sometimes resembles a Martian scene.\n\nCultural and Social Impact of Teide National Park\n\nLocal Culture: The Guanche Legacy of Teide National Park\n\nTeide and Las Cañadas had a profound spiritual significance for the Guanches, the island’s ancient inhabitants. This area was vital for their survival, especially during the summer when herders and shepherds from all over the island gathered in the high mountain pastures. Additionally, the Guanches utilized the natural resources of the area, such as obsidian, a stone found only at these heights, which they used to make tools.\n\nThe remains of Guanche huts in Las Cañadas offer valuable testimony to this pastoral past and are an important record of the history of Tenerife’s first inhabitants due to the abundance of archaeological sites in the area.\n\nThe Guanches referred to Teide as \"Echeyde\" and revered it as a sacred mountain. For them, the volcano was the path to the center of the earth, associated with the native deity Guayota. In 1798, the last major eruption occurred within the current boundaries of the National Park, forming the well-known \"Narices del Teide,\" an eruption on the slopes of Pico Viejo that emitted millions of cubic meters of lava over three months.\n\nThe conquest of Tenerife by the Kingdom of Castile in 1496 marked the end of the Guanche resistance after numerous battles. Since the 16th century, Teide has attracted notable naturalists and scientists, such as Alexander von Humboldt, who was one of the first to study the flora of the National Park.\n\nEl Teide en la Cultura Popular: Un Icono Cinematográfico\n\nTeide National Park has left a significant mark on popular culture, serving as the setting for various film productions and notable events:\n\nIn 1966, the movie \"One Million Years B.C.\" was filmed in the park, starring actress Raquel Welch.\n\nMike Oldfield included the song \"Mount Teide\" in his compilation album \"The Complete,\" released in 1985, as a tribute to the Tenerife volcano.\n\nThe movies \"Clash of the Titans\" (2010) and \"Wrath of the Titans\" (2012) filmed most of their scenes in Teide National Park.\n\nEnglish musician Brian May studied astronomical phenomena from Izaña, in Las Cañadas del Teide, and wrote the song \"Tie Your Mother Down\" in this environment.\n\nTripAdvisor ranked Teide as the second most impressive volcano in Europe, after Etna.\n\nIn 2008, the Israeli flag was raised at the foot of Teide by the initiative of the Jewish community of the Canary Islands.\n\nIn 2010, Teide National Park was the most visited park in Europe and the second most visited in the world.\n\nThe Hermitage of the Virgen de las Nieves, located next to the Parador de Turismo de Las Cañadas, is the highest-altitude Christian temple in Spain.\n\nThe music video for the song \"The Island – Pt. 1 Dawn\" by Pendulum was entirely filmed in the national park.\n\nThe founder of the Church of Scientology, L. Ron Hubbard, collected OT-III materials in Tenerife, including Teide as one of the volcanoes mentioned in the doctrine.\n\nIn 1989, a \"UFO Alert\" was held in the park, organized by the radio program Espacio en Blanco.\n\nIn 1998, members of a sect led by Heide Fittkau Garthe were detained for attempting to perform a ritual suicide at Teide.\n\nCanarian composer Benito Cabrera was inspired by the Teide landscape to compose the song \"Nube de Hielo\".\n\nTeide was the main setting for the sixth installment of the \"Fast and Furious\" saga, starring Vin Diesel.\n\nIn 2017, Teide National Park was the eighth most searched place on Google Street View, with a total of 8.6 million visits.\n\nIn 2018, the park’s surroundings hosted part of the filming of the American movie \"Rambo V: Last Blood,\" starring Sylvester Stallone and Paz Vega, among others.\n\nAcceso y Recomendaciones para la visita\n\nCómo llegar al Parque Nacional del Teide\n\nAccessing Teide is possible through various routes, with options including car, bus, or guided tours, making it easy to visit from any point on the island.\n\nEn coche\n\nIf you decide to drive to Teide, you have three road options:\n\nFrom the north, you can take the TF-21 road, which passes through La Orotava-Granadilla and connects with the TF-24 in La Laguna-Portillo.\n\nThe TF-21 also takes you to the southern side of Teide, so you can access from both sides via this route.\n\nAnother route is from the west, via the TF-38 road that passes through Boca Tauce-Chío and connects with the TF-21 in the south.\n\nTransporte público\n\nIn addition to driving, you can also reach Teide using public transportation. There are two bus lines, known as guaguas on the island:\n\nFrom the northern coast of Tenerife, specifically from Puerto de la Cruz, you can take line 348 that will take you to Teide National Park.\n\nFrom Costa Adeje, on the southern coast of the island, line 342 will take you to the same destination.\n\nEn avión a Tenerife\n\nTo reach Teide by plane, you must first fly to either Tenerife North Airport (Los Rodeos Airport) or Tenerife South Airport (Reina Sofía Airport), depending on your point of origin and the availability of direct flights. These two airports are the main ones on the island and receive both national and international flights.\n\nOnce you arrive at one of these airports, you have several options to get to Teide National Park:\n\nCar rental: You can rent a car at the airport and drive to Teide. Both airports have numerous car rental companies offering a wide variety of options.\n\nPublic transportation: From Tenerife North Airport, you can take a bus to the bus station (guaguas) in Santa Cruz de Tenerife, and from there connect with one of the lines that go to Teide.

Carrying water, sun protection, and appropriate clothing is crucial.\n\n¿Qué ropa llevar?\n\nWhen venturing into the high mountains, it is crucial to pace your energy, as any prolonged effort can be exhausting. Therefore, ensure you bring water or isotonic drinks to stay hydrated, along with energy-boosting foods like fruits or nuts. It is essential to wear suitable footwear for the loose and rocky terrain of the mountain. During winter, take extra precautions, especially after snowfalls, and in summer, be mindful of the intense solar radiation that can cause severe burns. Therefore, it is advisable to use sunscreen and wear a hat. Additionally, regardless of the season, carry warm clothing and a rain jacket, as the weather in the mountains can change rapidly. Lastly, do not forget to carry your mobile phone in your backpack for any emergency.\n\n¿Qué no hay que llevar?\n\nIt is important to remember that taking stones from the environment is strictly prohibited, no matter how tempting it may be to collect some of strange shapes. This act not only negatively affects the landscape but is also harmful to the ecosystem. Remember that the best memory you can take with you is the experience lived, not a physical object.\n\nSee also"
