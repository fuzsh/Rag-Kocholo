        "text": "Santa Cruz de Tenerife is the second most populated city in the Canary Islands, with more than two hundred thousand inhabitants. It is the capital of the province of the same name and the main city of the Tenerife.\n\nThe area that today is Santa Cruz de Tenerife was inhabited since ancient times by the aboriginal Guanches, until the arrival of the Spanish conquistadors in 1494. Fern치ndez de Lugo, at the head of the expedition, planted a cross, which is still preserved in the Iglesia Matriz de la Concepci칩n and gave the city its name. In the following centuries, the port of Santa Cruz acquired an increasing importance in maritime traffic, thanks to the new trade routes to America.\n\nToday, the port has become one of the most important in the Canary Islands and in Spain, both in commercial traffic and in cruise and passenger tourism by ferry from the mainland and between the Canary Islands themselves.\n\n游뚹 Departures from Santa Cruz de Tenerife are operated by the companies Naviera Armas and Fred Olsen, which offer departures to the mainland ports of Huelva and Cadiz and regular connections with the islands of Lanzarote, Fuerteventura, Gran Canaria and Santa Cruz de La Palma.\n\nThe maritime station of Santa Cruz de Tenerife offers various facilities for the use of passengers in transit, such as information offices, bars, cafeterias, ATMs, stores, car rental and toilets.\n\nSanta Cruz de Tenerife is dotted with buildings and places that tell its long history. Near the port is the church of Nuestra Se침ora de la Concepci칩n, from 1500, the only one with five naves in the Canary Islands, which has the highest bell tower in the city.\n\nAlso near the docks, you can visit the Castillo de San Crist칩bal, a 16th century fortification, whose original walls can be seen in a subway museum. Access to the museum is in the central Plaza de Espa침a, seat of the Cabildo of Tenerife and beating heart of the social life of Santa Cruz.\n\nAlong the promenade, south of the port, you will find the Parque Mar칤timo C칠sar Manrique, a complex of three saltwater pools, with stores, restaurants, gyms, and decorated with natural elements and volcanic rocks that recall the characteristics of the island's territory. From here you can also admire the sensational architectural structure of the Auditorium, designed by Santiago Calatrava.\n\nNext to the park, again with a style inspired by the wild nature of the place, you can visit the Palmeto de Santa Cruz, a wonderful botanical garden with the best sample of palm trees in Europe, as well as all kinds of flowers and fruits.\n\nBut, apart from the port area, the whole city is worth a visit: between lush urban green spaces, historic squares and palaces of all architectural styles, you just have to choose what to see in SC de Tenerife!\n\nHow to reach the boardings\n\nAddress: Puerto S/C de Tenerife, Muelle Ribera, 38010 SC de Tenerife, Spagna\n\nGPS Coordinates: 28춿28'38.2\"N 16춿14'30.4\"W\n\nThe city of Santa Cruz is well connected to the freeway network and can be reached by car via the Autopista del Sur and Autopista del Norte.
