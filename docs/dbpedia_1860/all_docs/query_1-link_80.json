In Santa Cruz de Tenerife, the chance of a wet day over the course of April is gradually decreasing, starting the month at 6% and ending it at 3%.\n\nFor reference, the year's highest daily chance of a wet day is 13% on December 12, and its lowest chance is 0% on July 9.\n\nRainfall\n\nTo show variation within the month and not just the monthly total, we show the rainfall accumulated over a sliding 31-day period centered around each day.\n\nThe average sliding 31-day rainfall during April in Santa Cruz de Tenerife is essentially constant, remaining about 0.2 inches throughout, and rarely exceeding 0.9 inches or falling below -0.0 inches.\n\nAverage Monthly Rainfall in April in Santa Cruz de Tenerife\n\nSun\n\nOver the course of April in Santa Cruz de Tenerife, the length of the day is increasing. From the start to the end of the month, the length of the day increases by 46 minutes, implying an average daily increase of 1 minute, 36 seconds, and weekly increase of 11 minutes, 9 seconds.\n\nThe shortest day of the month is April 1, with 12 hours, 29 minutes of daylight and the longest day is April 30, with 13 hours, 15 minutes of daylight.\n\nThe latest sunrise of the month in Santa Cruz de Tenerife is 7:54 AM on April 1 and the earliest sunrise is 30 minutes earlier at 7:24 AM on April 30.\n\nThe earliest sunset is 8:23 PM on April 1 and the latest sunset is 17 minutes later at 8:39 PM on April 30.\n\nDaylight saving time is observed in Santa Cruz de Tenerife during 2024, but it neither starts nor ends during April, so the entire month is in standard time.\n\nFor reference, on June 20, the longest day of the year, the Sun rises at 7:08 AM and sets 13 hours, 57 minutes later, at 9:05 PM, while on December 21, the shortest day of the year, it rises at 7:53 AM and sets 10 hours, 20 minutes later, at 6:13 PM.\n\nThe figure below presents a compact representation of the sun's elevation (the angle of the sun above the horizon) and azimuth (its compass bearing) for every hour of every day in the reporting period. The horizontal axis is the day of the year and the vertical axis is the hour of the day. For a given day and hour of that day, the background color indicates the azimuth of the sun at that moment.

Lower dew points feel drier and higher dew points feel more humid. Unlike temperature, which typically varies significantly between night and day, dew point tends to change more slowly, so while the temperature may drop at night, a muggy day is typically followed by a muggy night.\n\nThe chance that a given day will be muggy in Santa Cruz de Tenerife is essentially constant during April, remaining around 0% throughout.\n\nFor reference, on August 28, the muggiest day of the year, there are muggy conditions 40% of the time, while on January 13, the least muggy day of the year, there are muggy conditions 0% of the time.\n\nHumidity Comfort Levels in April in Santa Cruz de Tenerife\n\ndry 55Â°F comfortable 60Â°F humid 65Â°F muggy 70Â°F oppressive 75Â°F miserable\n\nWind\n\nThis section discusses the wide-area hourly average wind vector (speed and direction) at 10 meters above the ground. The wind experienced at any given location is highly dependent on local topography and other factors, and instantaneous wind speed and direction vary more widely than hourly averages.\n\nThe average hourly wind speed in Santa Cruz de Tenerife is essentially constant during April, remaining within 0.2 miles per hour of 12.4 miles per hour throughout.\n\nFor reference, on July 16, the windiest day of the year, the daily average wind speed is 15.0 miles per hour, while on October 6, the calmest day of the year, the daily average wind speed is 10.2 miles per hour.\n\nThe hourly average wind direction in Santa Cruz de Tenerife throughout April is predominantly from the north, with a peak proportion of 79% on April 30.\n\nWater Temperature\n\nSanta Cruz de Tenerife is located near a large body of water (e.g., ocean, sea, or large lake). This section reports on the wide-area average surface temperature of that water.\n\nThe average surface water temperature in Santa Cruz de Tenerife is essentially constant during April, remaining within 1Â°F of 67Â°F throughout.\n\nGrowing Season\n\nDefinitions of the growing season vary throughout the world, but for the purposes of this report, we define it as the longest continuous period of non-freezing temperatures (≥ 32Â°F) in the year (the calendar year in the Northern Hemisphere, or from July 1 until June 30 in the Southern Hemisphere).\n\nTemperatures in Santa Cruz de Tenerife are sufficiently warm year round that it is not entirely meaningful to discuss the growing season in these terms. We nevertheless include the chart below as an illustration of the distribution of temperatures experienced throughout the year.\n\nTime Spent in Various Temperature Bands and the Growing Season in April in Santa Cruz de Tenerife\n\nTime Spent in Various Temperature Bands and the Growing Season in April in Santa Cruz de TenerifeApr1122334455667788991010111112121313141415151616171718181919202021212222232324242525262627272828292930300%100%10%90%20%80%30%70%40%60%50%50%60%40%70%30%80%20%90%10%100%0%MarMay100%Apr 16100%Apr 16coolcomfortablewarm\n\nfrigid 15Â°F freezing 32Â°F very cold 45Â°F cold 55Â°F cool 65Â°F comfortable 75Â°F warm 85Â°F hot 95Â°F sweltering\n\nGrowing degree days are a measure of yearly heat accumulation used to predict plant and animal development, and defined as the integral of warmth above a base temperature, discarding any excess above a maximum temperature. In this report, we use a base of 50Â°F and a cap of 86Â°F.\n\nThe average accumulated growing degree days in Santa Cruz de Tenerife are rapidly increasing during April, increasing by 469Â°F, from 1,288Â°F to 1,757Â°F, over the course of the month.\n\nSolar Energy\n\nThis section discusses the total daily incident shortwave solar energy reaching the surface of the ground over a wide area, taking full account of seasonal variations in the length of the day, the elevation of the Sun above the horizon, and absorption by clouds and other atmospheric constituents. Shortwave radiation includes visible light and ultraviolet radiation.\n\nThe average daily incident shortwave solar energy in Santa Cruz de Tenerife is gradually increasing during April, rising by 0.7 kWh, from 6.5 kWh to 7.3 kWh, over the course of the month.\n\nAverage Daily Incident Shortwave Solar Energy in April in Santa Cruz de Tenerife\n\nTopography\n\nFor the purposes of this report, the geographical coordinates of Santa Cruz de Tenerife are 28.468 deg latitude, -16.255 deg longitude, and 180 ft elevation.\n\nThe topography within 2 miles of Santa Cruz de Tenerife contains very significant variations in elevation, with a maximum elevation change of 1,781 feet and an average elevation above sea level of 365 feet. Within 10 miles contains very significant variations in elevation (4,954 feet). Within 50 miles also contains extreme variations in elevation (12,152 feet).\n\nThe area within 2 miles of Santa Cruz de Tenerife is covered by water (42%), artificial surfaces (38%), and shrubs (15%), within 10 miles by water (56%) and shrubs (22%), and within 50 miles by water (88%).\n\nData Sources\n\nThis report illustrates the typical weather in Santa Cruz de Tenerife, based on a statistical analysis of historical hourly weather reports and model reconstructions from January 1, 1980 to December 31, 2016.\n\nTemperature and Dew Point\n\nThere are 2 weather stations near enough to contribute to our estimation of the temperature and dew point in Santa Cruz de Tenerife.\n\nFor each station, the records are corrected for the elevation difference between that station and Santa Cruz de Tenerife according to the International Standard Atmosphere , and by the relative change present in the MERRA-2 satellite-era reanalysis between the two locations.\n\nThe estimated value at Santa Cruz de Tenerife is computed as the weighted average of the individual contributions from each station, with weights proportional to the inverse of the distance between Santa Cruz de Tenerife and a given station.\n\nThe stations contributing to this reconstruction are:\n\nTenerife South Airport (GCTS, 71%, 35 mi, southwest, 26 ft elevation change)\n\nGran Canaria Airport (GCLP, 29%, 65 mi, southeast, -105 ft elevation change)\n\nTo get a sense of how much these sources agree with each other, you can view a comparison of Santa Cruz de Tenerife and the stations that contribute to our estimates of its temperature history and climate. Please note that each source's contribution is adjusted for elevation and the relative change present in the MERRA-2 data.\n\nOther Data\n\nAll data relating to the Sun's position (e.g., sunrise and sunset) are computed using astronomical formulas from the book, Astronomical Algorithms 2nd Edition , by Jean Meeus.\n\nAll other weather data, including cloud cover, precipitation, wind speed and direction, and solar flux, come from NASA's MERRA-2 Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis . This reanalysis combines a variety of wide-area measurements in a state-of-the-art global meteorological model to reconstruct the hourly history of weather throughout the world on a 50-kilometer grid.\n\nLand Use data comes from the Global Land Cover SHARE database , published by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.\n\nElevation data comes from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) , published by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\n\nNames, locations, and time zones of places and some airports come from the GeoNames Geographical Database .\n\nTime zones for airports and weather stations are provided by AskGeo.com .\n\nMaps are © OpenStreetMap contributors.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe information on this site is provided as is, without any assurances as to its accuracy or suitability for any purpose. Weather data is prone to errors, outages, and other defects. We assume no responsibility for any decisions made on the basis of the content presented on this site.\n\nWe draw particular cautious attention to our reliance on the MERRA-2 model-based reconstructions for a number of important data series. While having the tremendous advantages of temporal and spatial completeness, these reconstructions: (1) are based on computer models that may have model-based errors, (2) are coarsely sampled on a 50 km grid and are therefore unable to reconstruct the local variations of many microclimates, and (3) have particular difficulty with the weather in some coastal areas, especially small islands.\n\nWe further caution that our travel scores are only as good as the data that underpin them, that weather conditions at any given location and time are unpredictable and variable, and that the definition of the scores reflects a particular set of preferences that may not agree with those of any particular reader.\n\nPlease review our full terms contained on our Terms of Service page."
