        "text": "From 1957, this is a real treat. I want to thank all who recommended this book. Eric Frank Russell's SINISTER BARRIER I had heard about, because of its Fortean themes and I would likely have read it at some point, but his later book WASP would have been just another title in a long row of science fiction books. \"The Terran agitator was the sting to cripple the invincibility of the Sirian empire\", hmm doesn't look like anything special, I would have mistakenly thought.\n\n(As an aside, I picked up a copy of the slightly abridged 1971 Bantam edition because, hey there it was, and if I waited to find the longer version, I might never get to read it. As it is, my stack of books to be read is taller than I am at this point.)\n\nThe essential theme of the book is presented in having a tiny wasp, less than half an ounce in weight, sting at just the right moment. \"Neverthless, that wasp killed four big men and converted a large, powerful car into a heap of scrap.\" In a similar way, a single clever agent provocateur with a plan can start the downfall of a military regime. So the agent is called a wasp, and wasp imagery is repeatedly used to reinforce the point.\n\nWASP is not a book that necessarily has to be science fiction or fantasy by its basic premise, as say DONOVAN'S BRAIN or DARKER THAN YOU THINK are. It would only take an editor a short time to change a detail here and there to make this a plausible spy story taking place in modern times.\n\nReportedly, the book had its origin while Russell was working on ways that a saboteur could undermine the Japanese empire during World War II (he was in the RAF for four years), and the resemblance of the story to an English agent infiltrating Japan is overwhelming (the Kaitempi, or Sirian secret police, is so close to the historical Kempetai as to seem like a punchline). In fact, the Sirian word for \"yes\" is \"hi\", so close to \"hai\" that I inevitably began picturing scenes as taking place in wartime Japan. The idea that, although the Sirians have great numerical superiority, their technology is crude compared to the Terrans, means that Russell is showing a society essentially identical to mid20th century Earth's. Taxis, phones, newspapers, trucks...the few advanced gadgets shown are not essential to the story and could be disregarded.\n\nWe follow the mission of James Mowry, who has been slightly altered with purple skin to look like a Sirian and dropped on the planet Jaimec. Mowry has some equipment, disguises and supplies with him, most notably a huge amount of counterfeit money, but what he chiefly relies on is a devious and cunning mind. Over the following weeks, by putting up stickers and graffiti all over the city, the wasp creates the illusion of a vast underground resistance movement aimed at ending the war with Earth. This fictional D.A.G. (the Dirac Angestun Gesept, a wonderful item for a science fiction trivia quiz) shortly has the secret police in an uproar especially after a few select assassinations which Mowry executes or arranges are credited to the D.A.G. The more furious and frantic he makes the Sirian auhorities, the less manpower and attention they have to expend on the war itself.\n\nAs amusing and alarming Mowry's tactics are, the story is always enjoyable in itself. The agent steadily heat things up and places himself in increasingly dangerous spots. The more successful Mowry is, the less safe he becomes. Although he's usually shown as competent and professional, the wasp has JUST enough of a clear personality to make him interesting. He never quite disappears under the plot.\n\nRussell's writing has that effortless clarity that seems to have a journalistic effect. Even in tense or hectic moments, there is often a satiric undertone that keeps the story from being too grim. (Although I thought the heavily ironic ending fell a bit flat.) One phrase impressed me so much that I wrote it down as an example of how, in our own world`s real history, governments and the military have always tried to put a positive spin on dismal events: \"For months we have been making triumphant retreats before a demoralized enemy who is advancing in utter disorder.\" What's unnerving is that an official spokesman could say that on the evening news and most people would just nod and accept it."
