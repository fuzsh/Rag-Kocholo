        "text": "Not long after landing, the ship is attacked by an army of machines that range from the size of dogs to the size of railway cars, all of them bristling with pincer arms and tentacles. The narrator and company put up a spirited resistance with energy pistols (\"needle-ray guns\"), grenades (\"one of those eggs known as a pocket A-bomb\") and an automatic cannon (an eight-barreled \"pom-pom\") but all the Terrans are seized and carried off; the Martians manage to escape.\n\nIn captivity, the humans and Jay Score meet some lobster-people who can communicate telepathically. The lobsetermen are natives of this star system, and explain that their water-covered planet is at war with this machine-dominated planet, because the machines, who share a communal intelligence, are mystified by the individualism of flesh-and-blood creatures, and dissect all they can get their hands on in hopes of learning the secret of individuality.\n\nThe Martians rescue their Terran shipmates, an operation facilitated by the fact that one of the rules of the war between the machines and the lobstermen is a prohibition on escape attempts--both lobstermen and machines are taken aback at the Solarian determination to break out of the clink. The lobstermen don't just refuse to accompany our heroes to freedom, they even upbraid them for their disgraceful behavior! The Marathon returns to our solar system laden with samples from the world of machines.\n\nI like violent adventure stories and I like the individualism vs collectivism theme, but \"Mechanistria\" didn't do much for me. Russell fails to imbue any of the fight scenes or horror scenes with any human feeling, there is no thrill during the fights, no dismay when the narrator comes upon evidence that one of his comrades has been cut to pieces without benefit of anesthesia, no relief when the survivors make their getaway. One problem is that these Jay Score stories are all written in a jocular, smart-alecky style that keeps you from taking anything seriously. Another problem is the characters--they are all flat and uninteresting, each equipped with a single wacky personality trait that does nothing to drive the plot but just serves to present opportunities for (weak) comedy--one human who goes unnamed in \"Mechanistria\" always has his beloved wrench (or, as Russell calls it, \"spanner,\") with him; one Martian loves to take naps. Successful stories are often built around the personality and decisions of a compelling character--things happen in The Iliad, Moby Dick and Watamote because of the remarkable psychologies of Achilles, Ahab, and Tomoko Kuroki, psychologies which drive them to make decisions that have tragic consequences. But in \"Mechanistria\" the characters' personalities and decisions don't drive the plot, the people are just along for the ride and do not elicit the sympathy or interest of the reader.\n\nThe optimistic theme I detected in \"Jay Score\" of diverse crewmembers' different skills complementing each other seems too have degenerated in \"Mechanistria\" into a lame depiction of humans as goofballs who need superior beings--the Martians and a robot--to pull their bacon out of the fire.\n\nBarely acceptable.\n\n\"Mechanistra\" first appeared in Astounding, where it was adorned with illustrations by William Augstin Kolliker; Kolliker's depiction of the pom-pom appears to be directly based on photos of the 2-pounder anti-aircraft guns mounted on British warships during World War II. The story has been widely reprinted, including in several German magazines and books.\n\n\"Symbiotica\" (1943)\n\n\"Symbiotica\" made its debut in an issue of Astounding full of stories by people we care about (sometimes against our better judgement!) here at MPorcius Fiction Log, like A. E. van Vogt, Raymond F. Jones, Fredric Brown, Henry Kuttner and Frank Belknap Long. Of the stories by this gallery of fascinating figures in the issue I have only written about Kuttner's \"The Proud Robot,\" so maybe I should make time to give the October 1943 Astounding a thorough going over. Well, today we can make a start to such a project with our examination of \"Symbiotica.\" \"Symbiotica\" has appeared in such important anthologies as Raymond J. Healy and J. Francis McComas's Adventures in Time and Space and Isaac Asimov and Martin H. Greenberg's The Great SF Stories: Volume 5, and I certainly hope I like it as much as did those four editors.\n\nAh, as so often happens in life, hopes are dashed. \"Symbiotica\" is long (50 pages, over twice as long as \"Jay Score\") and tedious, with a routine and repetitive plot. All my criticisms of \"Mechanistria\" hold for \"Symbiotica:\" the total lack of interesting characters means the story has no hold on the reader, and Russell's jocular tone and incessant supply of low key jokes undermines the effect of the many scenes of violence and gore.\n\nThe plot: The Marathon lands on a planet inhabited by primitive green-hued people who have a symbiotic relationship with plants, most prominently huge trees of various sorts. Irresponsible humans, despite the best efforts of Jay Score the robot, piss off the natives and a fight breaks out. Ray guns and grenades only barely prove a match for the various plants, who can fling volleys of poison darts at you or knock you out with gas or dissolve you with acid, and we readers are treated to many pages during which the narrator and other boring people are held captive by the aliens. The narrator does almost nothing besides getting knocked out and getting captured. The robot and the Martians rescue most of the humans and the ship returns to Earth.\n\n\"Symbiotica\" feels like a shaggy dog story, a story with no climax in which the characters accomplish nothing. Barely acceptable. Maybe Healy and McComas in the 1940s and Asimov and Greenberg over thirty years later chose it for anthologies because it has a little speculative biology in it and they hoped to present SF as a literature that was about science and considered entertainment value of secondary importance in their selections?\n\n\"Mesmerica\" (1955)\n\n\"Mesmerica\" made its debut in this book, Men, Martians and Machines, and has only appeared in one anthology, a German one that reuses Richard Powers' cover of the edition of Edmond Hamilton's The Star of Life that I own. (I blogged about The Star of Life back in 2018, and if you want to read me gush about how much I love Hamilton and Powers just click the link. TLDR: Hamilton does all the things in The Star of Life that I have been bitching Russell fails to do in these Marathon stories: produce an adventure story that has human drama and features characters who have compelling personalities and whose decisions drive the plot.)\n\n\"Mesmerica\" follows the same template as \"Mechanistria\" and \"Symbiotica.\" The Marathon lands on a planet, and a fight with the natives erupts, and some Terrans get captured, and Jay Score the robot and the Martians use their special powers to resolve the whole issue and then the Marathon leaves the planet with a sample of the native life. (Lots of SF is about paradigm shifts or revolutions--The Star of Life by Edmond Hamilton depicts such a radical change--but in Russell's Marathon stories contact with Solarians does not wreak any change on the various natives.) In this case the natives have mental abilities that allow them to make humans see things that are not there, and to even affect human thinking, making humans squabble among themselves, for example. \"Mesmerica\" is probably a little better than the two proceeding stories, as it feels a little shorter and the narrator is more active, but it only rises above them to the level of \"acceptable.\"\n\n**********\n\n\"Barely acceptable\" has to be my verdict for this collection as a whole; I don't think I can recommend Men, Martians and Machines to anyone beyond those with some sort of deep interest in Russell's career or World War II-era Astounding. I certainly can't recommend it to casual readers looking for an entertaining or emotionally moving or intellectually stimulating read."
