Slight wear to spine, covers, corners & dustjacket. ; GPT\"The Great Explosion\" is a science fiction novel by Eric Frank Russell, blending humor and satire to explore themes of freedom, government, and human nature. The story unfolds four centuries after Earth has sent out colony ships to distant planets, many of which have developed societies with unique governance systems or lack thereof. The narrative centers around a bureaucratic and militaristic Earth government's attempt to reassert control over these far-flung colonies. A ship, the Bureaucrat, embarks on a mission to bring these independent worlds back under Earth's authority. However, the crew encounters a variety of societies that challenge their preconceptions about governance and human organization. The most memorable of these is the planet of anarchists, who live in a state of organized chaos that surprisingly functions quite well. Through these encounters, Russell critiques authoritarianism and advocates for individual freedom and self-reliance. The novel is celebrated for its witty examination of societal structures and the innate human drive for autonomy. ; 19 x 13 x 1.7 cms; 203 pages.\n\nCondition: Good. SHIPS FROM USA.
