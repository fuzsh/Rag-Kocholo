It will thrill and chill the blood of those among us whose curiosity knows no restraint; and the others who are magnetically drawn by the dreadful...\"\n\nThe Sin of Hyacinth Peutch\n\nWith a Blunt Instrument\n\nA Matter of Instinct\n\nI’m a Stranger Here Myself\n\nThis One’s On Me\n\nI Hear You Calling\n\nWisel\n\nThe Ponderer\n\nSole Solution\n\nRhythm of the Rats\n\nMe and My Shadow\n\nBitter End\n\n'With a Blunt Instrument'\n\nMrs. Bunstead wants to bump off hubby for the insurance money. Her sister got away with it, so why can’t she? She visits Digger Kelly who is running a profitable little operation - he gets rid of unwanted spouses using an Australian killing bone then enjoys half the insurance. To actually do the dirty deed Kelly employs a black dwarf:\n\n“The dwarf was squat, pot-bellied, black-skinned, and he wore a suit of sloppy clothes as if reluctantly conforming to an insane custom...”\n\nAll is going well until Dan Fletcher from the insurance company starts to look at the statistics and becomes suspicious of so many apparently natural deaths...\n\n'A Matter of Instinct'\n\nThis appears as ‘Impulse’ in Groff Conklin’s “Twisted” anthology. Wonder why he changed the title...\n\nA good pulpy story about Dr. Blaine, alone in his surgery one evening when a man arrives. The man turns out to be an animated corpse, possessed by sub microscopic thought reading aliens who crashed to Earth the night before. Their purpose is to find a new host body, the one they are using was already dead when they stole it, they want a living one. They need Dr. Blaine’s help because if they take over a conscious person they become instantly insane, they want the doctor to drug someone to make the possession smoother. Then into the surgery walks a young girl...\n\nJust as enjoyable the second time around. It’s got a ‘Quatermass’ feel to it I thought.\n\n'I'm A Stranger Here Myself'\n\nMrs. Enderby visits Dr. Wilson with worries about her 15 year old son John - she says his personality is changing, he’s making strange and enigmatic remarks about his origin.\n\nWhen he talks to John it seems the boy and some of his friends have become ‘cosmos-conscious’, claims he has no memory prior to being 4 years old. He believes himself to be non-human and the victim of a conspiracy to keep the truth hidden...\n\n'This One's On Me'\n\nPushy newspaperman Jensen gets more than he bargained for when he visits a shop advertising ‘Mutants For Sale’. The shop owner is polite, even when Jensen is rude and threatening to expose him to the police. He demands to see a mutant. He will do…\n\n'I Hear you Calling'\n\nPoor Widgey Bullock. He’s a sailor on shore leave, all he wants to do is get drunk and get laid, without attracting any unwanted official attention. The bar he goes to is empty, the nervous barman tells him people don’t come out at night. He also tells him about the bodies emptied dry of blood, mostly the bodies of strangers to the town. Scornful and a little intoxicated the sailor heads back to his hotel. From his room window he sees a likely looking woman and calls to her to come up to him…\n\n'Wisel'\n\nThe passengers in the old train compartment are fascinated by Mr. Wisel – even more so by his bag with it’s unusual and brightly coloured sticker. He’s happy to tell them it’s from the Red Range Hotel on Mars, knowing that no-one believes him. An ideal situation for a visitor…\n\n'Dark Tides' seems to fall within that grey area between sci fi and the 'weird tale'. My sci fi threshold is quite low but I'm enjoying these stories and Russell is an entertaining writer, there seems to be a bit of a noir detective thing going on in some of the stories, particularly in the dialogue between characters, laced with a few shots of humour. I've a feeling I've explained that really badly... thats why I'm a reader and not a writer\n\nHe describes the shop keeper in 'This One's On Me' as:\n\nHe had a white mane, watery eyes, a crimson nose and a perpetual sniffle. If he had any brothers they were hanging around Snow White\"\n\nCalenture\n\nSlime Beast\n\nPosts: 943\n\nPost by Calenture on\n\nPossibly Justin will know who painted the cover for this 1964 Panther edition?\n\nThis is a lovely collection, Andy. Other collections that I have include Somewhere a Voice (Penguin, 1968), and Far Stars (Panther, 1964). Interestingly Panther list Dark Tides as horror rather than SF. I was about to start waffling about how this writer probably did more than any other to mix up my ideas of horror and SF. But I found a site where it was put more knowledgeably. This is about a later collection, Darker Tides:\n\n\"The name of Eric Frank Russell is synonymous with the \"Golden Age of Science Fiction\". From his first published tale in 1937 to the middle of the 1960s, Eric Frank Russell was one of the most highly-acclaimed authors in the genre. As such, much of his best science fiction remains in print today. However, there was another side to the great writer, that of being one of the modern masters of the weird tale. As an admirer of the work of Charles Fort, Eric Frank Russell was also keenly interested in the supernatural or unexplainable. His novel Sinister Barrier was credited with inspiring John W. Campbell to launch Unknown so that stories of this type would have a home. Over the next two decades, Eric Frank Russell wrote more stories that are more in the realm of the \"weird tale\" than the more logical world of science fiction. Several of these tales were collected over thirty years ago in a fabulously rare volume entitled Dark Tides. This new collection contains all of these elusive tales and doubles their number with a selection of similar stories from sources such as Weird Tales, Fantastic, Strange Stories, and Science Fantasy. Whether you come to this book as an Eric Frank Russell fan seeking out his rare stories or come as a devotee of the weird tale, we are certain that you'll find much here to enjoy!\n\nWith introductions by the late author and a new preface by John Pelan and a striking cover by Allen Koszowski this edition is limited to just 500 copies.\n\nConsidering that Mr. Russell's collection from NESFA is now in a third printing, we strongly suggest advance orders to avoid possible disappointment.\n\nContents:\n\nThe Sin of Hyacinth Peuch\n\nThe Ponderer\n\nMe and My Shadow\n\nVampire from the Void\n\nThe Big Shot\n\nTake a Seat\n\nDown, Rover, Down (The Case for Earth)\n\nA Divvil with the Women (Heart's Desire)\n\nI Hear You Calling\n\nMatter of Instinct (Impulse)\n\nPoor Dead Fool\n\nSole Solution\n\nWith a Blunt Instrument\n\nThe Rhythm of the Rats\n\nDisplaced Person\n\nHell's Bells\n\nAppointment at Noon\n\nBitter End\n\nI'm A Stranger Here Myself\n\nIt's in the Blood\n\nSeat of Oblivion\n\nStorm Warning\n\nThis One's on Me\n\nWisel\"\n\nDarker Tides at Bloodletting Books\n\nCraig Herbertson wrote:\n\nThe great thing about the Vault is seeing stuff like this. I have been a bit of a fan of Russell's SF and despite collecting books for years I have seen neither of these editions.\n\nSomething to look forward to ."
