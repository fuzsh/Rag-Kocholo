        "text": "Wasp is a 1957 science fiction novel by English author Eric Frank Russell. Wasp is generally considered Russell's best novel. The title of Wasp comes from the idea that the main character's actions and central purpose mimic that particular insect; just as something as small as a wasp can terrorize a much larger creature in control of a car to the point of causing a crash and killing the occupants, so the defeat of an enemy may be wrought via psychological and guerrilla warfare by a small, but deadly, protagonist in their midst."
