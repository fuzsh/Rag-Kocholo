        "text": "Which books/covers/authors intrigue you? Which have you read? Disliked? Enjoyed?\n\n1. Somewhere A Voice, Eric Frank Russell (1965)\n\nFrom the back cover: “A band of shipwrecked spacemen making their way across a world so fierce that all Earth’s jungles tame by comparison…\n\nA future euthanasia agency with a double-barreled scientific secret…\n\nThe unexpected problem of a lone astronaut with an entire ocean world to himself…\n\nThese are some of the science-fiction premises that Eric Frank Russell has cooked up in this new collection of novelettes and stories. SOMEWHERE A VOICE is a book worthy of the brilliant talents of the author of THE SPACE WILLIES and SENTINELS FROM SPACE.”\n\nContents: “Somewhere a Voice” (1953), “U-Turn” (1950), “Seat of Oblivion” (1941), “Tieline” (1955), “Displaced Person” (1948), “Dear Devil” (1950), “I Am Nothing” (1952).\n\nInitial Thoughts: One of many 50s authors whom I have not explored sufficiently at this point in my SF reading career. I’ve only read and reviewed The Great Explosion (1962). Any goodies in this collection?\n\n2. Manalone, Colin Kapp (1977)\n\nFrom the back cover: “Tomorrow’s Future Shock\n\nWHY\n\nis the government deliberately destroying all trace of Man’s past?\n\nWHE\n\nare the laws of gravity and momentum strangely altered?\n\nWHY\n\nhas the world’s population continually increased without the predicted eco-crisis taking place?\n\nWHY\n\nis there an international conspiracy to conceal the future of the human race?\n\nThese are just some of the reality-shattering questions that face Manalone, a brilliant computer scientist, when he tries to find out exactly what has happened to humanity. Manalone, outcast from society, must fight the entire machinery of a ruthless police state to discover the truth. And the truth is an awful, chilling one, that sounds only too real in today’s world.”\n\nInitial Thoughts: I’m not sure why I bought this one. Kapp’s “Hunger Over Sweet Waters” (1965) and “The Pen and the Dark” (1966) represent the threads of hard-SF that bounce off me (and the rest of the stories in the linked-collection The Unorthodox Engineers (1979) that I never managed to review). Sometimes I make bad decisions.\n\n3. Xorandor, Christine Brooke-Rose (1986)\n\nFrom the back cover: “‘THE FIRST TIME WE CAME ACROSS XORANDOR WE WERE SITTING ON HIM!’\n\nAnd no wonder! For Xorandor is a rock (actually, a Martian computeroid creature) who befriends computer whiz kids Jip and Zab. Xorandor has a message: He and his offspring, feeding on radioactive wastes, may have eaten a warhead. Now, the world is interested: Are brainy stones the answer to nuclear waste disposal? can they stop the arms race? And what are the stones really about? Jib and Zab know. But no one will listen.. and disaster seems inevitable.”\n\nInitial Thoughts: Christine Brooke-Rose remains best known for her experimental SF novels Out (1964) and Such (1966). I haven’t been able to find copies, yet. As I often dabble a bit around the edges of an authors works first, I decided to instead track down one of her later novels “ostensibly” for children: Xorandor (1986). If you want to read more about her fascinating background and work, check out her SF Encyclopedia entry.\n\n4. The Book of Mars: Tales of Mars, Men and Martians (variant title: Mars, We Love You), ed. Jane Hipolito and Willis E. McNelly (1971)\n\nFrom the back cover: “Canals, dying civilizations, hurtling moons, desiccated polar caps, dust storms, unending vistas of red sand…\n\nAsimov, Heinlein, Ray Bradbury, Frank Herbert, Arthur C. Clarke, Edgar Rice Burroughs, Harlan Ellison…\n\nThese are just a few of the ideas and authors featured in this anthology which brings together the very best writings about the Red Planet–H. G. Well’s [sic] classic War of the Worlds to recent SF stories by Harry Harrison and Barry Malzberg.”\n\nContents (including non-fiction): Giovanni Schiaparelli’s “Report on Canali” (1877), Percival Lowell’s “Mas as the Abode of Life” (1908), H. G. Wells’ The War of the Worlds (1898) (excerpt), Edgar Rice Burroughs’ A Princess of Mars (1912) (excerpt), Stanley G. Weinbaum’s “A Martian Odyssey” (1934), Donald A. Wollheim’s “The Embassy” (1942), Lester del Rey’s “Dark Mission” (1940), George O. Smith’s “Lost Art” (1943), P. Schuyler Miller’s “The Cave” (1943), Anthony Boucher’s “Expedition” (1943), Arthur C. Clarke’s “Loophole” (1946), Damon Knight’s “Catch That Martian” (1952), H. Beam Piper’s “Omnilingual” (1957), Ray Bradbury’s “The Lost City of Mars” (1966), Harry Harrison’s “One Step from Earth” (1970), Frank Herbert’s “Carthage: Reflections on a Martian” (1971) (poem), William Fox’s “Soft Landing” (1971) (poem), Irene Jackson’s “Earthbound” (1971) (poem), Harlan Ellison’s “In Lonely Lands” (1959), Bruce McAllister’s “World of the Wars” (1971), Barry N. Malzberg’s “Exploration” (1971), Robert A. Heinlein’s Double Star (1956) (excerpt), Willis E. McNelly’s “Linguistic Relativity in Middle High Martian” (1970) (essay)\n\nInitial Thoughts: I enjoy themed-anthologies. This one reminds me of a reader as it contains excepts from various longer novels on the topic and non-fiction.\n\nFor book reviews consult the INDEX\n\nFor cover art posts consult the INDEX"
