        "text": "It is time to get our freaks on with Englishman Eric Frank Russell. In 1962 Russell's countrymen published a hardcover collection of his weird-type stories, Dark Tides. A 1963 paperback, green with a black figure with red eyes, followed, and then in 1964 a blue paperback, a copy of which I acquired recently in Maryland. (I've heard English people on TV pronounce that \"Merry-land,\" and, as someone who has lived in the state famous for crabs and Harm City, I am equipped to provide today to those who might benefit from it a service in the form of a pronunciation guide: we say \"Mare-uh-lund,\" guvnah.)\n\nWe've already read three stories from Dark Tides, and today will read three more. Today's stories are quite short--the three of them together take up only 20 pages of Dark Tides--and first appeared in the early 1950s in SF magazines, two British, one American.\n\n\"I'm a Stranger Here Myself\" (1952)\n\nFirst the American magazine, Other Worlds, edited by Ray Palmer, in which Russell's \"I'm a Stranger Here Myself\" debuts alongside a story by Mack Reynolds. \"I'm a Stranger Here Myself\" is a \"meta\" twist-ending story, a sort of in-group joke for SF fans. I find this kind of thing tiresome.\n\nA teenager is brought to a therapist because he is always asking difficult questions and seems to doubt his parents are his real father and mother. This kid reads SF, and has met other SF readers, and they have all come to the conclusion that they are not really human, that they are being deceived about their true nature. The kid and the shrink engage in a logical and philosophical debate, and when the shrink is unable to convince the teen that he is truly human and the SF kids' theory is nonsense, he whips out a gun to kill the kid because the kid has stumbled on the truth. The second layer of the twist ending is the revelation that the kid has outwitted the shrink with his special powers and the doctor cannot dispose of him so easily.\n\nLame filler, a waste of time, thumbs down!\n\nA translation of \"I'm a Stranger Here Myself\" would be included in a 1969 Dutch Russell collection which does not have the book title or author's name on its front cover, just a big eye, the artist's signature, and the identifier \"SF.\"\n\nLEFT: 1969's Dutch Russell collection Ik ben hier zelf ook vreemd\n\nRIGHT: 1973 French anthology edited by Henry-Luc Planchat\n\n\"This One's On Me\" (1953)\n\nThis one was apparently a hit; quite a few editors have reprinted it after its initial airing in Nebula Science Fiction, among them serial anthologists Groff Conklin, Peter Haining and Henry-Luc Planchat.\n\nA newspaper columnist sees a sign in the window of a small shop: \"MUTANTS FOR SALE.\" Smelling a story, he goes in to have an antagonistic smart-alecky conversation with the proprietor who claims he has the ability to tailor-make life forms to order. He also has a standard bargain line of off-the-shelf mutants, like a dog who can speak English. The journalo doesn't believe the shopkeeper, thinking the talking dog is a ventriloquist's trick and the shop is really a front for a business selling drugs or bootleg booze. As part of his investigation he snatches a vial of some unidentifiable liquid and drinks it, and it turns him into a monster, one he jocularly described earlier when sarcastically making up a hypothetical custom-job order for the mutant-maker; this fantastical animal is also described on the back of the paperback editions of Dark Tides.\n\nMere filler, I suppose acceptable."
