Nothing else. Every child knows that play is nobler than work. He knows too that the worth or merit of a game is not inherent in the game itself but rather in the value of that which is put at hazard. Games of chance require a wager to have meaning at all. Games of sport involve the skill and strength of the opponents and the humiliation of defeat and the pride of victory are in themselves sufficient stake because they inhere in the worth of the principals and define them. But the trial of chance or trial of worth all games aspire to the condition of war for here that which is wagered swallows up game, player, all. [...] This is the nature of war, whose stake is at once the game and the authority and the justification. Seen so, war is the truest form of divination. It is the testing of one's will and the will of another within that larger will which because it binds them is therefore forced to select. War is the ultimate game because war is at last a forcing of the unity of existence. War is god. „ ~ Judge Holden philosophizing his views on war.\n\nJudge Holden, commonly known as The Judge is the main antagonist of the late Cormac McCarthy's 1985 horror/thriller crime and anti-Western epic novel Blood Meridian.\n\nHe is an enigmatic polymath who joins a cowboy gang in order to 'help them', only for it to be revealed he is a deranged serial killer and child molester, who enjoys causing as much suffering as he can.\n\nHolden holds both a sinister side and a curious side. He enjoys harming and raping people but also has a fondness for geography, mathematics, reading, shooting, horses, and (his personal favorite) technical drawing. Holden is theorized to be a demon by most of fans, due to his almost monstrous appearance and hatred of religion, which is shown when he manages to convince a peaceful town to brutalize their local preacher for no reason. Holden also holds some form of enigmatic power over the people around him, as everybody wishes to shoot him but somehow find themselves compelled to not do so. In the end, Holden's goals are truly unknown, but his survival in the novel's ending indicates he plans to continue killing for the rest of eternity.\n\nQuick Answers\n\nWhat is the role of Judge Holden in Cormac McCarthy's 'Blood Meridian'?\n\nJudge Holden, often referred to as 'The Judge', is the main antagonist in Cormac McCarthy's anti-Western epic novel 'Blood Meridian'. He is a mercenary with a genius-level intellect and extraordinary knowledge in a multitude of areas. The Judge is known for his super strength and marksmanship, making him a formidable foe. He is also depicted as an enigmatic figure who never sleeps and claims he will never die. His role in the novel is marked by his atrocities and his philosophical musings on war and existence, making him a complex and chilling character.\n\nProvided by: Fandom\n\nWhat real-life figure inspired the character of Judge Holden in 'Blood Meridian'?\n\nThe character of Judge Holden in 'Blood Meridian' is inspired by a real-life figure who allegedly committed heinous acts similar to those portrayed in the novel. This individual, like Holden, was known for his atrocities and distinctive hat. The novel, however, leaves the origins and details of Judge Holden's character intentionally vague, adding to his mystique and the overall horror and anti-Western themes of the story.\n\nProvided by: Fandom\n\nWhat is known about the origins of Judge Holden in 'Blood Meridian'?\n\nJudge Holden, often referred to as 'The Judge' or 'The Devil', is a fascinating character from Cormac McCarthy's 1985 horror/thriller, crime and anti-Western epic novel, 'Blood Meridian'. The novel keeps the origins of the Judge quite mysterious, adding to his enigmatic persona. He is depicted as a mercenary with exceptional skills in marksmanship, super strength, and genius-level intelligence. He is also extraordinarily knowledgeable in a wide range of subjects. The character of Judge Holden is said to be inspired by a real-life individual who committed similar atrocities and was known for his hat. A unique aspect of the Judge is his claim of immortality, stating that he will never die, which adds another layer of intrigue to his character.\n\nProvided by: Fandom\n\nWhere is Judge Holden active in the novel 'Blood Meridian'?\n\nJudge Holden, the main antagonist in Cormac McCarthy's epic novel 'Blood Meridian', is active throughout the anti-Western landscape. Known for his extraordinary knowledge and genius-level intelligence, he is a mercenary who commits horrific acts. He's an enigmatic figure who seems to be everywhere, from the fireside telling stories to the Glanton gang, to the final chapter where he declares his immortality while dancing. His activities are not confined to a specific location, making his presence a constant and menacing force in the novel.\n\nProvided by: Fandom\n\nIs Judge Holden portrayed as the devil in 'Blood Meridian'?\n\nYes, in Cormac McCarthy's 'Blood Meridian', Judge Holden is often interpreted as a representation of the devil. His character is shrouded in mystery and he possesses extraordinary knowledge and skills, which give him an almost supernatural aura. He is also depicted as being evil, committing numerous atrocities throughout the novel. Furthermore, his claim that he will never die and his constant dancing, even in the face of death, lend to the interpretation of him as a devilish figure. However, the novel leaves much to interpretation, so while many readers see him as a devil figure, others may have different interpretations.\n\nProvided by: Fandom\n\nPersonality[]\n\nJudge Holden is an extremely ruthless, callous, depraved, and remorseless psychopath, but also a very intelligent and knowledgeable individual. He often teaches lessons about the world to his fellow mercenaries and philosophizes with them. He tends to avoid personal confrontation but is perfectly willing to murder or rape people in the most brutal ways imaginable if they are his enemies. The Judge is perennially calm and rarely loses his cool throughout the novel.\n\nHe is an immensely cruel and vile being, demonstrating his penchant for sadism on multiple occasions, such as buying two puppies just so he could toss them off a bridge to drown in a river (before the two puppies were shot and killed by the Vandiemenlander). The Judge is also known to be an abusive pervert given his additional status as a murderous child molester who habitually lures children into his clutches with sweets. A child goes missing in nearly every town that he visits, and he is, on several occasions, seen with a naked child in his room.\n\nAppearance[]\n\nThe Judge is a man of strange appearance. He has an enormous frame, being both immensely muscular and close to 7 feet in height. His skin is extremely pale, to the point of being described as fluorescent and purely white in coloration; his lack of pigmentation is possibly the result of albinism, as exposure to direct sunlight is painful to him, as evidenced by how desperate he was to purchase a hat from Toadvine to protect himself from the harsh sunlight of the desert. According to Tobin, he weighs 150kg.\n\nHe lacks any hair, including his head, facial hair, and body hair, raising the possibility that he suffers from an autoimmune disorder such as alopecia universalis. In contrast to his apparent age and strong features, the Judge has a strangely childlike element to his appearance, having hands and feet that are small in proportion to the rest of his body and possessing a childish aspect to his face.\n\nThe Judge is often partially or entirely nude, but (when clothed) will tend to wear clothing typical of his era, such as long coats, linen shirts, boots, and wide-brimmed hats. Often, the Judge can be seen smoking a cigarillo.\n\nIn Samuel Chamberlain's autobiography, My Confession: Recollections of a Rogue, Holden's appearance is described almost identically to that of his fictional counterpart, though he has a head of hair.\n\nHe stood six foot six in his moccasins, had a large, fleshy frame, a dull, tallow-colored face destitute of hair, and all expression, always cool and collected.\n\nBiography[]\n\nPast[]\n\nThe novel is vague about the origins of the Judge to the point where there is almost nothing known about him. The narrator states that Judge is something \"wholly other than their sum, nor was there system by which to divide him back into his origins for he would not go\" and that he has no beginning or end.\n\nBlood Meridian[]\n\nIt is known that the Judge was active around the Mexico-United States border in the 19th century and seems to be a possibly middle-aged man. He is first seen entering a revival to falsely accuse a priest of being an imposter, as well as an illiterate, zoophilic criminal wanted for pedophilia, agitating the people in attendance of his service to the point where they try to kill the priest on the spot.\n\nThe Judge later met a group of nomadic mercenary scalp hunters who were out of gunpowder and at risk of being overtaken by a group of Apaches. They encountered Holden sitting on an enormous boulder in the middle of the desert as if he had been waiting for them, even though there was no way he could have known that they were coming.\n\nThe Judge climbed a mountain with them, extracting potassium nitrate (referred to as nitre in the novel) from bat guano and manufacturing charcoal while he was there, amongst other scientific pursuits. The Judge later led them to a small area of volcanic activity, while Apaches were following them closely. When they arrived, he collected native sulfur and mixed it with the charcoal, potassium nitrate and urine, producing a crude gunpowder. The Judge then staged a false surrender against the Apaches. However, when the natives approached the mercenaries, Holden and his fellow men brutally gunned all of them down. Shortly after, the Judge formed a partnership with the captain of the gang, a small, dark-haired man named John Joel Glanton.\n\nThe Judge was involved in several more conflicts with natives, including a raid that resulted in the slaughtering of multiple babies and defenseless non-combatants. After a year, Glanton and most of his gang were slaughtered in a conflict with Yumas Native Americans. Holden was one of the few that managed to survive. The other four remaining members of the Glanton Gang (the Kid, Benjamin Tobin, David Brown, and Louis Toadvine) encounter the Judge and the Idiot after the Glanton Massacre. After Davy Brown and Toadvine leave, Holden suddenly attacks Tobin and the Kid, stalking them across a field before the duo is forced into hiding to escape him. The duo manages to get into San Francisco, but Tobin goes missing. His ultimate fate remains unknown.\n\nThe Kid encounters Holden decades later in a saloon, although the Judge has not aged at all. Holden describes the Kid as a disappointment, stating that he held in his heart \"clemency for the heathen.\" He then follows the Kid into an outhouse, dragging him into a stall with a little girl who was also present in the saloon. After this event, two men approach the outhouse, and another man walking back to the saloons tells them that they should not go near the place. They open the door and are confused and horrified by what they see.\n\nWhat happens to the Kid is unknown. One theory is that Holden rapes and kills the Kid. Another is that the Kid is tempted by Holden to rape the girl. The latter is supported by the fact that an unknown man was walking away from the outhouse and told the other men not to approach. This may have been the Kid walking away from his actions. The Judge has attempted to corrupt the Kid throughout their acquaintance and make him commit acts of evil. However, the Kid already committed many sins and killed a 15-year-old boy in the previous chapter (albeit in self-defense), so the Judge may have simply come to end his life.\n\nThe Judge is last seen dancing in the dance hall attached to the saloon. He is completely naked and has enchanted the crowd. He says that he never sleeps, and he claims that he will never die.\n\nPowers & Abilities[]\n\nThe Judge is extraordinarily strong and durable. He can hold a heavy howitzer under one arm, break an arm with ease, and crush a man's head between his hands with such force that he bleed from his ears. Holden also has incredible stamina, being capable of walking vast stretches of desert without ill effect. His large size betrays his capacity for stealth, and he often appears and disappears like a phantom without anyone noticing. It is these traits that suggest the judge is not, in fact, human but a demon of some sort.\n\nThe Judge is an appointed judge of law and enjoys all the privileges that come with such a position, including the ability to negotiate for the pardoning of criminals. While his jurisdiction is not known, he can cite the words of the law from several jurisdictions from memory. He is a genius polymath with an exceptional level of intelligence and has extensive knowledge of many branches of science, including geology, botany, history, chemistry, and archaeology, and also can draw lifelike portraits of objects.\n\nHe is skilled at hiding his atrocities and never leaves behind any evidence. He can speak several secondary languages, including Spanish and Dutch. He possesses great strategic and tactical prowess, so much so that it causes Tobin to believe he cannot be overcome in battle.\n\nQuotes[]\n\n[]\n\nJudge Holden on the Pure Evil Wiki\n\nJudge Holden on the Wikipedia\n\nJudge Holden on the VS Battles Wiki"
