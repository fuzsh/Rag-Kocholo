        "text": "Advance review copies of my forthcoming novel BATTLE OF THE LINGUIST MAGES went out to reviewers and booksellers a little while ago in these shiny envelopes that match the cover, enabling one bookseller (Kelecto the Ninth on Twitter) to make the book appear to glow via some fancy photographic trickery or some such. (Something to do with light, probably? It's a mystery.) You can learn more about the book by visiting scenic Scottoweb. Pre-ordering is super helpful if you think you'll want to pick it up!\n\nI'm frequently asked (as in, it happened more than one time) if the ebook or the hardcover is better for me in some way. The answer is: not meaningfully, so you should get whichever version you are most likely to enjoy reading.\n\nMy novella, YOUR FAVORITE BAND CANNOT SAVE YOU, was recently included in a list of books in which music plays a prominent role. The squee factor is appearing on this list right after THE WICKED + THE DIVINE, a comic series by Keiron Gillen and Jamie McKelvie that was so influential to me that I did cosplay as a series villain at Emerald City Comic Con one year. When the novella came out, unbeknownst to me, my publisher asked Kieron Gillen to read it and provide a pullquote, which he did (comparing it to Ziggy Stardust), resulting in a Twitter exchange between us in which I got to show him a photo of me dressed up as his villain. Layers of meta-squee happening here. I will not be sharing that photo at this time.\n\nI'm on Pinterest a lot lately, and I've noticed its algorithm is very responsive. Two of the major topics I explore there are DJ culture and fashion photography. I'm pretty sure the algorithm cleverly attempted to crosspollinate those topics, and when I detected the resulting pattern in my feed I leapt into action, so now I have a new Tumblr blog called Fuck Yeah Posing With Disco Balls. It's unclear to me how seriously I'm taking this. If you need to know how it works, check out the rules.\n\n\"Interesting Ball\" (2014) - Probably the most singularly batshit nutso short film I've seen in recent history. Short description: \"A red ball bounces past a cafe and a couple folks’ houses and then goes to the beach.\" This synopsis, while technically accurate, is exquisitely underplayed, and I might've already said too much myself. Brought to you by the writing/directing duo DANIELS, who appear in one of the film's several vignettes as well; this team has also directed an impressive list of excellent music videos for the likes of Foster The People, The Shins, Passion Pit, \"and more!\" This is the most ambitious of their roster of short films, in which increasingly ludicrous action somehow earns a surprisingly moving conclusion.\n\n\"Cry Like A Ghost\" by Passion Pit (2013) - As long as we're on the topic of DANIELS, here's my favorite music video they've directed. It's an intense whirlwind of a dance piece set in a forest, in which a woman named Sylvia relives highs and lows from her past relationships, always swinging like a pendulum back to a lonely place. The choreography is intricately woven throughout the bars and bedrooms and phone booths that frequently emerge out of nowhere and then disappear back into the trees, and the film frequently rewinds and runs in reverse, as though Sylvia is reluctant to sink into certain memories. The music is bursting at the seams with compassion for her, though, and the track made me a fan of the band. (The video's closing slate teases an extended cut of the video; it features a one-minute intro sequence, but unfortunately it has disappeared from public view.)\n\n\"Exposed\" (2021) - Directed by Anna Fredrikke Bjerke. Synopsis: \"Ingrid, a young drama student, finds herself in the middle of an increasingly uncomfortable situation, as her ensemble and the play’s director discuss whether she should be performing a full-frontal nude scene.\" The discussion is incisive and the film is crisp and a little unsettling. \"Sacrifice everything for your art\" is a philosophical engine that will carry you places for sure, but here it clashes (rightfully) with a critique about the subjective value of this particular artistic choice in this particular cultural moment.\n\n\"Pile\" (2019) - Directed and \"computered\" by Toby Auberg. Synopsis: \"Water then food. Agriculture then industry. Old then new. Critical then extra. Simple to complex. Concrete to abstract. Dirt to clouds. Real to unreal.\" This three and a half minute animated tour de force takes you from the earliest stages of humanity all the way through to our hypothetical ascension into a technological singularity, using the conceit of the \"pile,\" a mountain where each layer of history is piled on top of the previous. This was Auberg's MA graduation film from the Royal College of Art.\n\n\"Rosewood\" and \"Tides\" by Bonobo (2021) - Hey look, Bonobo is back! The vids for the first two singles from his new record, Fragments, are pleasingly psychedelic eye candy.\n\n\"Next To Me\" by RÜFÜS DU SOL (2021) - Directed by Osk and billed as \"an artificially intelligent music video.\" How it worked: \"Osk trained their A.I. on hundreds of thousands of images of landscapes, architecture and cityscapes. As it learned, the A.I. developed a neural model of our natural and built environments. Once this process was complete, Osk then 'flew' through the multidimensional latent space of the A.I.'s neural model, traveling across the seamless, fluid terrain.\" Creating music videos with machine learning is still a relatively new technique, but here Osk pushes this whole visual subgenre forward quite a bit. It's especially pretty in the back half of the video when cityscapes come into focus.\n\n\"Little Runmo\" (2019) - An animated short produced by Gooseworx, in which an adorable character in a side-scrolling video game learns the meaning of life. Chilling stuff, really.\n\n\"Barbie Girl\" by Netta (2018) - The Israeli singer Netta won the Eurovision Song Contest in 2018, and on her way to that victory, she performed a cover of the classic Aqua track \"Barbie Girl\" on an Israeli singing show called \"The Next Star.\" In this performance, she beatboxes, loops, and sings the hell out of this song, her excellent voice tearing right through the absurd amount of autotune she's using. After you watch, you might want to hear a clean audio version without the commentary from the TV hosts.\n\n\"The Denial Twist\" by The White Stripes (2009) - I recently did a deep dive into the music videos of director Michel Gondry, and came across this for the first time. In 2009, I doubt I could tell you who The White Stripes even were, but uh I'm caught up now; they collaborated with Gondry several times. Before you watch this video, watch this brief clip of the band being interviewed by Conan O'Brien in 2003. Then watch the video, then if you're inclined, watch the making of the video, which reveals the brilliance of Gondry's shooting techniques."
