        "text": "Best Reads 2012\n\nBest Reads 2013\n\nBest Reads 2014\n\nBest Reads 2015\n\nBest Reads 2016\n\nBest Reads 2017\n\nBest Reads 2018\n\nBest Reads 2019\n\n2020.\n\nJust saying that is enough to make you go “fuck that”, and we’re all in the same boat, share the same feelings when we think back on the past months – it was a shitty year, for some the worst year of their lives, and we all want to move on, chuck it in the backlog, never to gaze upon it again.\n\nBut I’m sure someone out there, and I do hope more of you had something good happen to them, something they can remember this year by and look back and think, it was not all shitty, it was not bad all the time.\n\nI do these best reads lists each year, and sometimes I feel like I’ve run out of books to include. Not all books I read are the best books, not all books I read are new ones – sometimes I re-read old books, ones I’ve owned for years, ones I’ve carefully arranged on my shelf and reach out to when I need them.\n\nSo instead of doing a strictly best reads list I decided to do a list of books or scripts, or audiobooks I enjoyed throughout the year.\n\nAUDIOBOOKS\n\nThe Audible Sandman by Neil Gaiman & Dirk Maggs\n\nIs it going to be a selling point for you to say that The Sandman was the best audio drama adaptation of a comic book series in 2020? Because it was!\n\nIf you’re familiar with Neil Gaiman’s brilliant series The Sandman, then you know how vast that story and that world is. The characters inhabiting The Sandman world or rather universe are so complex, so personality driven, so colorful that it seems impossible to translate them into living and talking beings. Yet a group of vastly talented people got together and did just that – multi-talented Dirk Maggs helmed the project as its director, and the cast included James McAvoy as Morpheus, the Dream lord, the Sandman, Kat Dennings as Death, Taron Egerton as John Constantine, Michael Sheen as Lucifer and so, so many more names giving life to outstanding characters.\n\nThe Audible Sandman is by far one of the best audiobooks I’ve listened to. It kept me company in the early hours while going to work and in the tired evenings coming back from work, and invaded my mind in the hours between each listen with its haunting and rich orchestral composition, its brilliant cast, and its perfectly translated story from paper to audio.\n\nNow I don’t want to spoil anything for people that are just getting introduced with The Sandman, but I’ll give you this: you will not regret listening to it, you will not take back any second of it, not any section of it. You will dive straight into the echoing land of Dream and hear him whisper about dreams and you’ll love it.\n\nPODCASTS\n\nI don’t know about you, but I do enjoy my Spotify podcasts – from the spine tingling and mind boggling world of conspiracy theories of a desert mystery town in Welcome to Night Vale, through the howling mines and ancient mountains, where ghost stories burn in the old fires and come to life in the Old Gods of Appalachia, across the bizzareness of Within the Wires, all the way to the land of Mythical Monsters , I’ve enjoyed a multitude of episodes on train rides, while doing some shopping, while cooking, and I always wanted more, I wanted countless of hours of stories. This took me back to my childhood where I used to have these cassettes of fairytale stories and I used to bring my old Walkman with me and listen to them in the car – I remember vividly the headphones pressed to my ears and the volume maxed as Wilhelm Hauff’s Heart of Stone reached its culmination.\n\nBut as I’m a big movie buff too, and I do make my own short mobile films, I’ve discovered with great pleasure a few fantastic podcasts dedicated to the art of filmmaking, but also delving deep into the whole process of movie making. By far my favorite one is The Film Riot Podcastwhich paired with their YouTube channel is a treasure trove of information and insight into the business and dream of being a filmmaker. And since I’m so into mobile filmmaking, The Voice of Mobile Filmor Susan Botello’s Mobile Filmmaking Podcast comes second best with outstanding guests, tips, tricks, insights and so much more!\n\nNOVELS\n\nTrue Crime\n\nI’ll Be Gone in the Dark by Michelle McNamara\n\nRecently I finished reading Michelle McNamara’s “I’ll Be Gone in the Dark”. It’s a true crime book investigating the persona of the Golden State Killer. I’m a sucker for a good crime book with my fascination on serial killers and how they think, and this book is such an amazing example of a gripping, well-paced, well-researched book that reaches that chilling the blood edge.\n\nBut more than that it’s a heart-wrenching book, and quite possibly the only one that made me shiver, and that made me sit in the dark and think of what I’d do if I was to see the shadow of a man standing at the end of my bed. It’s so freakishly real, though distant in time, as all the atrocities the Golden State Killer also known as EAR-ONS did were in the 70’s and 80’s in California. But the way Michelle introduced this monster to the public was so exceptionally detailed, so vivid, that he became very, very real to each person reading “I’ll Be Gone in the Dark” no matter where you live.\n\nAnd the personal aspects of it, those of Michelle McNamara’s own life transform this book into something special, something that explores one’s own demons in diving head first into this monster of a case, this impossible to catch killer. And the ultimate price she pays for that.\n\nI do think the book, and more so the HBO Documentary that serves as its adaptation, but also its continuation and climax, will quite possibly break your walls somewhat and shake you. If you are seeking out journalistic investigations that break the barrier, and go the extra mile, and if you’re interested in how DNA analysis work, how basically killers are caught today, and how much it cost people to have these killers escape justice, this is the book for you.\n\n“I love reading true crime, but I’ve always been aware of the fact that, as a reader, I am actively choosing to be a consumer of someone else’s tragedy. So like any responsible consumer, I try to be careful in the choices I make. I read only the best: writers who are dogged, insightful, and humane.”\n\n― Michelle McNamara, I’ll Be Gone in the Dark: One Woman’s Obsessive Search for the Golden State Killer\n\nHORROR\n\nI got my hands on a nice bundle of books from a contest I won, which was great because I familiarized myself with new writers – Gary Fry with What They Find in the Woods, Simon Bestwick and A Love Like Blood, Paul M Feeney’s Kids to name a few. Fantastic books for an afternoon read! Very creepy as well.\n\nI think the most freaky of all is Gary Fry’s What They Find in the Woods, but maybe that’s because I love me some ritualistic stories, with ancient evils lurking in dark woods.\n\nI’ve recently started reading “The House on the Borderlands”, something that has been in my to-read list since 2010 maybe, but I received a beautiful edition that I’m enjoying quite a lot, so perhaps this will be something included into the best reads list of 2021.\n\nSCRIPTS\n\nDoes this sound weird to you? Script reading?\n\nBut who knew that some movie scripts are written so detailed, so rich, that they basically read as short novels?\n\nBy far my most favorite is “The Witch” written by Robert Eggers.\n\nI’m a big fan of his works, with “The Lighthouse” being the most recent one – yet another masterpiece of a script – but something about The Witch just grabs you from the get go and stays with you as you go through each scene and mouth the dialogue as you read along. You can practically hear those haunting sounds setting the atmosphere of the movie.\n\nAs a major Whovian, I’ve been going through some of Doctor Who’s past episodes, and naturally went to read their scripts, mainly focusing on brilliant episodes such as “Heaven Sent”, season 9’s episode 11, a very huge episode for Peter Capaldi’s Doctor. Say what you will about Moffat, but his writing for this episode is so on point, the pages scream with power, and anger, sadness, lament. It’s just a rollercoaster of emotions which roll off the page and translate beautifully on screen.\n\nWell this has been a pleasure as always and I hope to see you next year. Bring your favorite books in the comments if you feel like it, I’m always open to a nice conversation about books!\n\nStay safe, stay healthy, and keep on reading!\n\nBest Reads 2012\n\nBest Reads 2013\n\nBest Reads 2014\n\nBest Reads 2015\n\nBest Reads 2016\n\nBest Reads 2017\n\nBest Reads 2018\n\nI’ve been at this since 2012 I think. That’s 8 years of reading choices. For the most part each book was carefully chosen, because it had inspired and thought-provoked me in one way or another. Or had just made me laugh, or fear, or cry. If I were to go back now through each list I’d be able to tell you a story connected to this or that book and it would make it a tiny bit more personal from me to you. I tried doing that in the small reviews which accompany each book.\n\nThis year the list is shorter, but short is sweet, no? I still hope you might find something new or remember something old through this list. And if you’re feeling particularly lonely or nostalgic towards some year of this passing decade, click on the link, browse some. You might catch a memory, might remember a story or discover a new one. Who knows. As always: feel free to leave comments with your favorite books. I’m open to suggestions to kick off the new year with.\n\nCRIME\n\nThe Trespasser by Tana French\n\nWas not in the market for procedural crime novels, but holy fuck I’m glad I picked this one up.\n\nA lover’s quarrel ends up bloody. A pretty girl is dead and they call it a domestic. One of the predictable ones. The how and why seem pretty obvious. Until they aren’t and things get shifty. Nothing really fits, the bits and pieces discovered don’t make up the puzzle whole. The story leans at odd angles which is what I loved about it. At the beginning there’s almost this unsettling, unnatural feeling about the world, the case and it mainly comes from the perspective of the main character – it gets you rubbing your hands to keep warm, makes you eye the trees from the corner of your eye lest they bend too low and block out the weak sun in that gunmetal sky.\n\nThe lead character, one Detective Antoinette Conway is super though and merciless – she doesn’t take shit from anyone and in her case, a lead detective in the Murder Squad in good ol’ Dublin, there’s a lot of shit to take from her colleagues. She’s on edge, tip-toeing with razor sharp precision around other detectives attached to this case, which keeps getting more convoluted by the minute. Her theories and those of her partner spiral them both down a hole they’d rather not slide into.\n\nI absolutely loved Detective Conway – her brutal approach towards the harassment she receives on a daily basis is honest and her way of navigating through this world is very forward, very fast-paced. She’s learned how to deal with assholes, but that doesn’t make it any easier. Her voice, god bless Tana French, is what I’d been wanting to hear in my head. She’s the type of character I love to spend time with – although she’s very heavy-minded, there’s an aura of death and darkness around her, she’s a delight to listen to, to hear her honest opinion on the world, the people, life. She’s the loner, the late-night drinker and thinker. She’s calculative. And no, you won’t read big action scenes in this book, you won’t get to experience the peril the main character faces. You’ll sit in interview rooms and listen to murder suspects get manipulated into the truth by experienced detectives. You’ll see the roles they play and how they use them to get out the truth. And you’ll want more. Thankfully there’s a whole series based around the Dublin Murder Squad with different characters taking the lead. Go check it out if you’re in the market for some crime!\n\nSCI-FI\n\nBorne by Jeff VanderMeer\n\nI’ll be honest – I don’t even know where to begin with this one. Is it sci-fi? Sure. Is it fantasy? Absolutely. Is it very unusual – a post-apocalyptic world, so dystopian, right? But the world we get to experience in the novel has been destroyed by a gigantic, flying, yes flying bear named Mord. Yep, you heard that right. The Company, the big Evil, a biotech company now lies in ruins mostly – and serves it right for creating monsters and torturing them until they go insane, learn to fly and burst out through the roof. Yes, we’re talking about Mord again. I mean as scary as it is, can you imagine an enormous flying bear? Would it be a black bear or a brown bear? Sorry, I got carried away…Anyways…\n\nSo we’re far into the future and society as we know it is no longer. To get by, Rachel, our main character lives as a scavenger and her loot is often entangled in the fur of Mord. Her partner, no wait, lover, Wick often uses what she’s found and what he’s found as genetic material for the freaky drugs he makes and sells (they create happy memories out of our own minds or depends on how they’ve been manufactured, you get to experience someone else’s happier days from the past. Also they look like tiny creatures, so…there’s that). One day though Rachel discovers an odd creature stuck there in Mord’s fur and she takes it to her sanctuary. She names the creature Borne.\n\nBorne is not something easily describable. It alters for us readers as it does for Rachel and it creates a bond with her that we’re eager to de-mystify, because it makes no sense, it has no source, no back story. At first.\n\nVanderMeer throws biotech, magic, monsters, drugs, visions, ruins, weapons, everything at you in the form of a very neatly written story, easily dived into. It’s fun to explore, it’s very refreshing in the genre, and the narrative feels like it knows where its going, knows what to offer you at each stage. So you’re not in over your head with that many names, or entities at first. You understand the basics of the world, but the story slowly unwraps more and more of it. 10/10.\n\nHORROR\n\nCoraline by Neil Gaiman\n\nYes, I’ve put Coraline into the Horror section of this list, because as much as it is a children’s story, it’s strange and far darker than you’d imagine. (Well done Neil Gaiman, you’ve managed to make buttons scary.) I love the screen adaptation and wanted for a long time to read the story raw, page by page. Oh boy.\n\nIt’s a story to finish in one sitting with it being something like 150 pages long, but don’t get fooled. Short is sweet, but also scary. Preoccupied with work parents and a desire for exploration and adventure lead Coraline through a door into a world matching her own like a mirror – only difference is, her (other) mother and (other) father grace her with their attention and affection. They offer unconditional love, delicious food, games and songs and not a trouble in the world – all things Coraline terribly desires – for only a small price – that Coraline stay with them forever. And that she replace her eyes with buttons. To match mammy and daddy of course.\n\nCoraline is a clever novel as I’ve found all Neil Gaiman stories are – it’s funny, charming, haunting, scary, hopeful, sad. I particularly like my edition of it, because it has illustrations done by Dave McKean, who I respect and love for his Sandman cover art. His depiction of the other-mother will haunt my dreams for years to come!\n\nIf you want a short novel to read wrapped in a blanket on a wintery night, but also want some spooks and you have a door in your house you’ve never opened, but are curious about, this is definitely for you.\n\nPHILOSOPHICAL\n\nThe Sailor Who Fell from Grace With the Sea by Yukio Mishima\n\nThere’s a long, more extensive review of the book I did some months ago which you can check out HERE, so I might be repeating myself now.\n\nThis story is fascinating.\n\nIt’s about cosmic superiority, existence in a reality bordering on social chaos but also constructed of perfection. It’s about the sea and how it looks from the window; it’s about ships and how they sound in the night; it’s about a stranger who seems larger than life and comes with stories which sound heroic and he, the hero of them; it’s about a stranger who comes to visit and decides to stay; it’s about love or the lack of it, about disappointment, and about understanding how one sits in the world between those two feelings. It’s magnificent, thick with poetry, rich in language and bound to either enchant you or leave you somewhat hollow. Me, it left with wonder and awe, of the parallels it drew, the colors it shifted.\n\nIf you haven’t had the chance to introduce yourself to Mishima, do it through “The Sailor Who Fell from Grace With the Sea”. I highly recommend it.\n\nBIOGRAPHY\n\nElon Musk Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic Future by Ashlee Vance\n\nIf you’re even a bit interested in the life and person of Elon Musk, this is the book you need on your shelf for those moments when you’re feeling especially entrepreneur-ish or Musk has tweeted something nerdy and you want to know who does that personality trait of his have anything to do with sending rockets into space or running a multi-billion dollar company for electrical vehicles. It’s a journalistic investigation into his life created via interviews, facts, memories, stories. It doesn’t paint him neither black, nor white. So it keeps honest to who Musk is and why he’s that person.\n\nIf you feel like getting to know the real-life Tony Stark, this is your guide book to his quirkiness, to his insane workaholic lifestyle, to his business, his inspiration, his desire.\n\nHISTORY\n\nNorse Mythology by Neil Gaiman\n\nWhy do I feel the title and the author should be reason enough to buy and read this? No review, just straight up get that on your kindle or better yet, get the hardcover (it’s gorgeous) and have a mead while you’re reading some of the best norse myths re-told by Neil Gaiman in his masterful way of telling stories and bringing characters to life.\n\nWhat seeps through this book is Neil’s own love for mythology. You can see a lot of it in his own work, so this is also an homage to the source material. He’s managed to rekindle my love for reading myths by taking these much known characters – Odin, Thor, Loki to name a few – and making them very vivid, very alive. They emerge from the pages with all their glory and all their faults, wise and not so wise, cunning and then again played for a fool, angry and happy and immortal.\n\nIt’s a fresh breath of air for mythology.\n\nI’ll inject an honorable mention right here, because it’s related. Zeus Grants Stupid Wishes: A No-Bullshit Guide to World Mythology by Cory O’Brien is also I think a very neat way of getting people into reading mythology. This compilation of myths from all corners of the world is hilarious and full of profanity. In a good way. Compared to Gaiman’s Norse Mythology, there is nothing to compare – the epic tales told with Gaiman’s masterful prose are one, and this here explores the crazy side of myths, which is also fun in my opinion.\n\nGRAPHIC NOVELS & MANGA\n\nAscender by Jeff Lemire, Dustin Nguyen\n\nDo ya’ll remember Descender? The beautifully drawn, pastel sci-fi comics about a boy bot, his robot dog and the fate of the universe? If yes, good for you, well done, you’ve had fun reading it!\n\nIf not, go check it out – it’s a beautiful blend between that old sci-fi feel with a fresh plot and great characters.\n\nNow “Ascender” itself takes places some 10+ years after the events in the first series and whilst the original storyline dealt with dehumanization, the uprising of robots and the civil dispute and war between the two factions (this being the spoiler free, short version of all the events that transpire. Spoiler warning: there are giant, cosmic robots), this time around the story focuses on the re-discovery of magic, pure and latent, now stirred free from the nether of the universe. Of course the story keeps with its fast paced sci-fi narrative, only this time it follows the daughter of one of the main characters from “Descender”.\n\nI highly recommend this graphic novel, because the story is very refreshing and again it has breathtaking art.\n\nFragments of Horror by Junji Itto\n\nOkay, this one I’ve been meaning to dig into for quite a while. At the Aniventure ComicCon this year there was an entire section dedicated to Junji Itto and I spent a good chunk of time staring at titles that meant nothing to me, trying to pick up a good manga to start off with. So I did a little research, a little sneak peak into the comment section in GoodReads and decided to dive straight into Itto with the help of “Fragments of Horror”.\n\nYou can see just by the cover art that it’s a worthy purchase – I love “Skrik” by Edvard Munch, so maybe that helped with the choice, but other than that and a nice rating online, I knew nothing about the stories compiled inside these 230 pages.\n\nThe anthology does not disappoint. I’m not a big fan of manga mainly because there weren’t any available for buying back when I was really into anime too. But I’m a fan of horror so introducing myself more in depth with Junji Itto felt like a nice starting point for my manga reading experience.\n\nThe collection consists of 8 macabre tales which range from strange to stranger still, because whilst being dipped into the horror genre, they have a nice range of subgenres woven into them – some are funny, some carry a heavy dose of eroticism, some are downright freaky and eew! inspiring. Visualizing each story for the page must have been so much fun- Itto has a very specific style of drawing, I’m sure you’ve come across some of his pieces online one way or another. Here’s a memory jogger:\n\nYeah, you’ve seen something similar to that.\n\nI had a lot of fun reading this anthology and can now proudly call myself a fan of Junji Itto. So I’ll be looking forward to more of his stories, more of his art, because they do give a good unsettling spook. Too good…\n\nAnd that’s it! I doubt that all the best reads of the decade have gone into these lists uploaded here, but some of the good stuff are definitely here – for me at least. So join in, share a book or two or three, heck there’s no limiter on sharing good books. Here’s to another 10, hopefully!\n\nLists from previous years:\n\nBest Reads 2012\n\nBest Reads 2013\n\nBest Reads 2014\n\nBest Reads 2015\n\nBest Reads 2016\n\nBest Reads 2017\n\n2018 rolled by bizarrely fast but if you managed to squeeze in some good reads (or even bad ones) and they made you shriek or cry or laugh or had any impressive impact on you – then it was a good year!

Book suggestions are always welcomed.\n\nCRIME\n\nMindhunter: Inside the FBI’s Elite Serial Crime Unit by John Edward Douglas\n\nWhen Mindhunter came out on TV at the end of last year my Twitter feed was full of constant feedback on how amazing the show is, how chillingly creepy and precise it is, and true enough the show was phenomenal! But in all the back and forth talk hardly anyone mentioned the source of it, but nevertheless a quick Google search gave the desired results – a spectacular true crime novel that delves deep into the brutal realism of some of the most sadistic criminals of our time.\n\nObviously the book isn’t up to anyone’s taste – it does get graphic and even without photographic leads it is descriptive enough to allow a very detailed reconstruction to appear in one’s head if one’s imagination is… vivid enough I should say. John Douglas being the special agent who was central in implementing behavioral science and criminal profiling in the FBI’s work process propelling it to a new age of crime fighting has a surprisingly solid storytelling skills – no wonder he was I believe the model for Jack Crawford in Thomas Harris works.\n\nIn this nearly 400-page novel the reader gets to not only follow through on more notorious serial crime cases in the US, but more importantly it allows a frightening gaze into a vast reasearch spanning multiple interviews and “confrontations” with serial killers of various capacities. In that sense “Mindhunter” is a remarkable study that aims to understand their motives, to showcase them to the general public – us the readers. If you are in any way interested into these behavioral patterns in subjects such as Ed Kemper, Richard Speck and even Manson, I highly recommend this book as a starting point. It gets real.\n\nFANTASY/SCI-FI/HORROR/HUMOR\n\nWelcome to Night Vale by Joseph Fink & Jeffrey Cranor\n\n*swirls wine in glass, takes a sip, smacks lips loudly.* “The strange lights in the sky over the desert are mysterious in their bluish glow. What strange lights? I see no lights and therefore I am undisturbed.”\n\nAnd what a strange introduction. But this is charm in the “Welcome to Night Vale” fashion. It’s without question a novel worth reviewing and a podcast worth listening to, or vice versa. However you feel like. But it’s worth your time, your mental state and your erm…dreams and questioning of life and reality and all.\n\nIt’s a novel rich in characters, healthy on the weird and scary and chockfull of delicious mindbending scenarios all of which are wrapped in a bubble about to burst, written in a delightful easy-going language that tickles you in places you like but feel weird about. It’s damned good!\n\nBe not mistaken – the novel has a plot that concerns two very special, very different and yet somehow similar women – Jackie Fierro and Diane Crayton. Between the two of them is…well its a very unending desert which has no name but in which Night Vale, a small town of weird proportions and happenings is situated. Between its streets and walls are angels called Erika, some aliens with their strange night lights, a pinch of ghosts, some overly creepy librarians and a shit ton of government conspiracies. Those are everyday normal things that occur and exist. What is not normal is another place called King City and a piece of paper that you just can’t seem to get rid of no matter what you do. Oh and time-bending, reality-reshaping plastic flamingoes. Oh boy.\n\n“Welcome to Night Vale” is unlike any novel I’ve ever read which is both disappointing and not, because otherwise I believe I wouldn’t have been so amazed by it instantly. I easily took it to heart, embraced all the ‘what the heck’ moments and plot twists and radio intrusions into the narrative by Cecil, the voice of Night Vale. For me it was insanely refreshing being well-humored but also weird and dark where it needed to be. The added fantasy and sci-fi elements mainly concerning time-travel and reality reshaping were an absolute joy. There are even many great quotes that stand out and can be taken out of context and applied to life and such:\n\n“Remember that misuse of language can lead to miscommunication, and that miscommunication leads to everything that has ever happened in the whole of the world.”\n\n“Comfort was the answer to all life’s problems. It didn’t solve them, but it made them more distant for a bit as they quietly worsened.”\n\n“It was a fair question, although the problem with fair questions is that they are asked about an unfair world.”\n\nAnd just so you could get a snipped of how wording goes in Night Vale:\n\n“Librarians are hideous creatures of unimaginable power. And even if you could imagine their power, it would be illegal. It is absolutely illegal to even try to picture what such a being would be like.”\n\nMy recommendation: go check out the podcasts and read the novel. You’ll get a weird sensation. But it spreads warmth, I promise.\n\n*All quotes belong to Joseph Fink\n\nCOMICS/GRAPHIC NOVELS\n\nThe Arrival (2007) By Shaun Tan\n\nBack in May I did a more detailed review of “The Arrival” and without a doubt it scores a place in this year’s Best Reads list without actually having any written words inside its pages.\n\n“The Arrival” explores the struggles of immigration through the heartbreaking story of a man parting from his wife and daughter as he boards a steamship across the ocean to find a better future for the three of them.\n\nVery intimately through Shaun Tan’s brilliant imagination and gorgeous pencil art we are invited to observe the man’s exploration, his experience and struggles as he arrives in an unknown land of impossible proportions and architecture without the knowledge of the language and understanding of the local customs.\n\nAnd the protagonist cannot communicate with the symbol language of the megalopolis, so can’t we as the reader. We are forbidden that luxury and so understand the isolation that builds for the man so far away from home. We begin learning with him, growing in this world and slowly becoming part of it. We are left with wordless art that speaks volumes.\n\nYou can read the full review of “The Arrival” and get quick access to some useful links and to Shaun Tan’s website here.\n\nDescender (2015 – 2018) By Jeff Lemire & Dustin Nguyen\n\nDescender invites you to enter a universe where androids are a common element in people’s daily lives, from companions to worker bots and so on. Of nine core planets that are under the rule of the United Galactic Council or UGC for short our attention is placed on Niyarata, the technological and cultural hub of the UGC, populated with over 5 billion people. Then, right from the get go an attack of colossal proportions takes place – a space invasion from gigantic robots called Harvesters, an unknown and unpredictable force.\n\nNaturally people blame the androids for the death, destruction and anihilation that follows the massive attack. There’s an open hunting invitation for all humans against the remaining numbers of robots. A young boy bot companion called TIM-21 is far away from the troubles of the planets. He has been asleep for the past 10 years on a small mining colony. And once he wakes up only to find everyone dead and the mines abandoned, the journey begins.\n\nThe art style is fucking amazing – the watercolor layer makes everything pop out and is really gorgeous to look at; the character models and world building, these huge, desolate landscapes and vast patches of space are simply beautiful – Dustin Nguyen has done and is doing an outstanding job of bringing to life visually pleasing faces and places in a kind of old school way, it often just reminds me of older SF comics.\n\nI highly recommend Descender. It is as I said a refreshing and of the times SF story inhabited by wonderful characters via a strong storytelling and a mystery still unfolding plus the cherry on top – its gorgeous to look at.\n\nFor my full review click here\n\nThe Books of Magic 1-4 (1990-1991) By Neil Gaiman\n\nThe Books of Magic give the starting point to Timothy Hunter’s adventure in becoming, if he choses so, one of the greatest if not the greatest magician of his generation. As he is quite young and unaware of that possibility, four practitioners of magic take it upon themselves to introduce Tim to the capabilities, promises, dangers, opportunities and costs of magic.\n\nIf you are keen on magic but in its philosophical, transcendental, esoteric, ancient, powerful and dark visage and admire smart and elegant and through and through brilliant writing that’s syphoning life-lessons on the backdrop of angels cascading flaming to earth, or Atlantis crumbling in the distance, or the universe and the stars being birthed, led by hierophant’s and jackasses and occult figures without true names, then this is absolutely the mini-series for you. You even get Death telling you about that appointment in Samara. Well not with so many words. You know the one, right? There was a merchant in Bagdad…\n\nRead the full review here!\n\nSandman Overture by Neil Gaiman & J.H. Williams III\n\nFor some people it has been twenty-five years since The Sandman first altered in ground breaking proportions the bone structure, the cosmic essence, the reality of modern comics. For others time has been more forgiving and the wait a lot shorter, but nevertheless, the mystery behind Dream’s capture in Prelude & Nocturness is finally revealed between the pages of six gorgeous chapters.\n\nNow a quick note: if you go back through the lists linked above you’ll notice hardly a year goes by without some Gaiman in it, and it’s painfully obvious I’m a huge fan. So, the reason behind me putting “The Sandman Overture” in this year’s list is because I had some catching up to do with the original series and all the extra volumes, special editions, spinoff’s before I could allow myself to read this wonderful beginning, original story, called it whatever you will.\n\nMy wait has been totally worth it! Not only is the art spectacular – the mix in artstyles, the cosmic explosion of colors and clever implementation of the chapter titles within the environment are just some of the aspects worth mentioning simply because they define the storytelling, the character’s individual experiences, moods, thoughts so much it’s incredible! The new illustrator J.H.Williams III together with Dave Stewart did an outstanding job in bringing to life a complex world by adding so much more life into it than it already had. Gaiman goes back to his Sandman roots with the easy step of a ballet dancer but with the same heavy decision-making and fate-bearing flawed Dream we know and love since 89′. Although we have a glance at him before the events that lead to his *SPOILER* incarceration, we are allowed the special peek behind the curtain that semi-explains why Dream is who he is or what he is as we get to meet the Mother and Father of the Endless in their stripped of mortal affection relationship to each other and their children.\n\nIf you haven’t read the original Sandman series I believe you should before even coming close to Overture – sure, it does kickstart Dream’s journey, but it might tangle you in characters, behavioral patterns and world-view that would make your head spin. So take the long way round, read the original first, come to love or hate or both Dream and the Endless and then when your heart is possibly broken and you’ve attended a funeral or two and have invested yourself into the story so deeply it hurts, then gently crack open the hard covers of “Sandman Overture“ and bask in its beauty!\n\nHonorable mentiones: Naomi’s Room by Jonathan Aycliffe; Plutona By Jeff Lemire & Emi Lenox ; Signal to Noise by Neil Gaiman & Dave McKean\n\nThis does it for this years BestReads2018 list! I hope you got something new from it or remembered something old. Let me know what you read this year! Stay safe xx\n\nLists from previous years:\n\nBest Reads 2012\n\nBest Reads 2013\n\nBest Reads 2014\n\nBest Reads 2015\n\n* * *\n\nIt’s the time of the year again when we sit down and gather our best reads from the past year, the books and stories that made us laugh or cry or dance, dream and think beyond our lives or about our lives in different nuances. It’s the last days of 2016 so as a tradition on this blog as is on many other blogs, it’s time to look back and share which novels made an impact on me.\n\nLast year I went on something close to a rant about myself and my inability to finish bigger works of fiction or non-fiction during 2015. I put my faith in short-story collections and then tried to apologise that the majority of my best reads list consisted of short-story collections. That was 99% stupidity. The Best Reads lists make themselves in our heads as we flip page after page, read book after book and gasp in awe at comic book after comic book.\n\nShort-story collections are one of the best things to exist. They have been my guide, my encyclopedia through fiction. They have been a constant fuel and inspiration. If one genre tops your Best reads list it means it sucked you in, it transformed you and inspired you. It made you think, it made you love. It sat with you through gloom and sunshine, a blanket of words and pictures tightly wrapped around your arms.\n\nBest Reads lists should show all that. I’m ever glad they exist and that we as avid readers can share what stories we fell in love with, what stories moved us. It’s a fitting way to say goodbye, farewell to a passing year because these stories reflect our view of 2016, they mirror what we felt, where we were, who we were. In a way, at least.\n\nHere’s my Best Reads 2016 list!\n\n* * *\n\nFANTASY\n\nA Song of Ice and Fire series: A Game of Thrones, A Clash of Kings, A Storm of Swords 1 by George R.R. Martin\n\nFive years ago I bought the first book of the series “A Game of Thrones” and didn’t read a single page from it until this past summer. It would sound like a bad excuse but the tv adaptation “Game of Thrones” is to blame for that.\n\nBut I’m ever glad I finally started the series especially with the huge hiatus between season 6 and 7 of the tv show. I have plenty of time to catch up on the source material.\n\nA lot of people joke about how much banner talk (I nearly wrote bathroom talk, smh) there is in these books. They aren’t wrong. I’ve lost track of the number of houses, banners, sigils and names George R.R. Martin has come up with. The heraldry in the series is insane. And unlike the people who find that a snore fest I quite enjoy the long paragraphs introducing an endless array of cousins and nieces and houses.\n\nI found an interesting thing when reading the books. They set a very steady rhythm with me. I can read for hours and never the voice in my head drifts off. I don’t know whether it’s because each chapter is told through the POV of different characters or simply because Martin has a way with words that even monologues roll of your tongue with ease and they are quite poetic and sing-song like often times. I hadn’t read much fantasy in the past years so the fact that “A Song of Ice and Fire” clicked with me with ease is the best thing. I can’t talk about the plot of the series, that just feels wrong because it’s just this huge, huge thing today that even if you are not a fan you know the basic premise – a war, a family torn apart, lots of death, lots of Machiavellian mischief and dragons of course.\n\nWhat I love about the series is the vast diversity in its territories. The transitions are easy to set the mood appropriately for the desert, for lost cities, for rain and mud, snow and frost, lavish fields, and barren castles. Each land just by its description creates a legend – there are a great many legends of the world on their own, but the things Martin doesn’t write but hints at are what makes this story so grand for me.\n\nI won’t stop to talk about the characters because there are so many fantastic personages. I’ll tell you however who one of my favorite characters in the series is – Littlefinger.\n\nHORROR\n\nThe Loney by Andrew Michael Hurley\n\nThis is the type of novel I finish and can just say “Oooh”. The Guardian called the novel “a gothic masterpiece” set on the northwest English coastline, two things that quickly made me want to read “The Loney” – a mystery near the bleak, bleak sea. I was looking at reviews the other day and found a surprising amount of 2 star reviews and mentions how the novel did not live up to the hype and how it left much unfinished and unexplained. But the novel is a lie in a way, news you receive at the last page so you go back to the beginning and wonder how much you trusted it when you started reading and how much you trust its narrative now that you’ve finished it. I don’t know. I trust the uncanny, the unexplained, the pagan, mystic, horrible part of it but I also entertain the other possibility. It’s open to interpretations.\n\nThe story carries us on a deeply religious pilgrimage that bares the hope that a mute and institutionalised boy, will be cured of his affliction through the ancient powers of a shrine belonging to a desolate, dank, foreboding land giving way to grey sea. Whether a healing process occurs I will not say. The novel dabbles in surreal horror and each character carries a sense of spiritual crisis, a downfall of faith through faith. They seek redemption and we see their nuanced experiences into reaching one or failing to do so. The story battles with the unquestioned love for a past sadistic Father and the mistrust of his successor who interprets faith in a different way.\n\nI vastly enjoyed the novel and it became my train read on late nights coming back from uni. If anything tickled your interest, go see for yourself. If its blank, it’ll show right away.\n\n***\n\nWhitstable by Stephen Volk\n\n“1971. A middle-aged man, wracked with grief, walks along the beach at Whitstable in Kent.\n\nA boy walks approaches him and, taking him for the famous vampire-hunter Doctor Van Helsing from the Hammer movies, asks for his help. Because he believes his stepfather really is a vampire…”\n\n– from Goodreads\n\nWhitstable is probably my favorite read from this year. I put the description here on purpose because if you haven’t figured out who this novella is about or dedicated to just by reading it…well I’ll tell you.\n\nIt’s about Peter Cushing.\n\nI don’t want to sound like one of those fans but my first introduction to him was through Star Wars: Episode IV as Grand Moff Tarkin. Of course when I watched it I had no idea who he was. I was a wee child! And much later on becoming better versed in the classic horror movies I recognized him and saw him in a different light – as the hero. As Doctor Van Helsing.\n\nWhitstable is a crushingly poignant story exploring in frightening depths the darkness inside us. It’s a story mixing fact and fiction but Stephen Volk balances that masterfully. His language is rich and detailed in his rebuilding of Cushing’s world of grief and solitude after the death of his wife Helen.\n\nThe story true in its main character and his difficult period in life, fictionalized an event which awakes Cushing from his peripheral, private existence and asks of him to be brave again, to step into the shoes of the actor but do so in a new role that begs of him to be cunning and fight a much more real monster of flesh and bones, but not with stakes and sunlight – with compassion, with understanding.\n\nI urge you to read this novella. It’s equal parts sad and uplifting. You don’t have to be acquainted with Peter Cushing or his career to enjoy this. Just know that whilst fiction in the sense of the narrative, it’s also a true to life story. It’s a very human story.\n\nThe Wendigo by Algernon Blackwood\n\nBlackwood became a favorite with “The Willows” which I read for #NaNoReMo ( a.k.a The National Novel Reading Month) in 2015. I scared me beyond words and its howling winds are still audible in my nights. But when I saw there was a novella called “The Wendigo” I got over excited. Wendigos are one of my favorite creatures in folklore by far surpassing werewolves. I believe some areas in Canada still see practiced the wendigo taboo ceremony. It was performed in times of famine when the human soul was thought to become greedy and the human flesh a craving. Thus the evil spirit was awoken and it took over the human transforming or possessing him with the Wendigo spirit.\n\nIt was really cool to learn that Blackwood’s Wendigo is considered to be the first appearance of the creature in literature. And although it vastly differs from its folklore description – a cannibalistic monster, an evil spirit – Blackwood’s monster of the wilderness is a force to be reckoned with.\n\nI’ve watched a lot of movies and tv shows featuring a Wendigo – namely Supernatural, Hannibal even games like Until Dawn (where the story was set in Blackwood Mountain). So I was aware of what a Wendigo looked like, how it behaved, what it wanted. Algernon Blackwood surprised me with his vision of the spirit of the wild. It befalls at first two men camping in the Canadian wilderness during their moose-hunting trip. Again as with The Willows though not as rich in details, the novella carries with sounds, night noises that are outside of the world the characters inhabit, unnatural and provoking the telling of legends and spirits, that of the Wendigo. When divinity student Simpson sees his guide Defago run out of their tent seemingly called by a voice high above the trees, he panics and follows only to discover two sets of footprints – one of unnatural proportions and one human, oddly transforming with each stride until they too become unnatural, belonging to some entity of giant proportions.\n\nThe brave but delirious student Simpson finds his way to the main camp and calls for reinforcements. Alas Algernon Blackwood is unforgiving and his characters cannot brave the sights they see, the scents they smell – if you’ve ever wondered how a Wendigo smells, its odor is that of lions in a cage – the voices and words they hear. Wendigos have their feet on fire. The heroes fall in deep beliwderment and as they recollect the events frightening images of the dark depths of the Canadian wilderness form.\n\nCRIME\n\nWhen Will There Be Good News? (Jackson Brodie #3) by Kate Atkinson\n\nI approached this novel series from the middle but that’s because I couldn’t find the other books at the time. I assured myself it wouldn’t be that much of a problem since I was familiar with Case Histories, the tv series based on Atkinson’s famous PI Jackson Brodie (quality drama!).\n\nI used to love reading crime novels. There were plenty of books at home, noir, mafia novels, lots of Puzo, Chandler, Greene and others more diverse it seemed to me with elements of sci-fi and horror. So I always had a crime to solve in the face of a novel or a short story and still do.\n\nThis novel is a train wreck both in its narrative where a train literally crashes and in terms of the lives of its characters. People deceive, people lie and people’s destinies lay on the same path. Junctures lead to a highway of sadness, memories, passion, friendship, love and family. And of course mystery. Jackson Brodie is a pretty neat character – he’s cheeky, smart, determined, loyal to his work as a private investigator. And somewhat unfortunate as he always gets tangled so deeply in people’s lives that the ordeal often threatens his own life. I grew fond of him via the tv series and whilst reading this novel couldn’t help but blend the episode based on it with the written word. I was actually quite pleased with how they had approached the episode. The novel has buckets and buckets of dark humour in the midst of all the drama which sets the pace quite nicely and the novels becomes easily gripping. One can only hurry to finish it as the story doesn’t allow you to catch your breath. There’s a healthy dose of Scotland as the events unfold there. What’s not to love?\n\nSHORT-STORY COLLECTIONS\n\nTrigger Warning by Neil Gaiman\n\nI would betray myself and the tradition of creating these lists if Neil Gaiman isn’t included. This year he is more than present not only with this collection but with a few graphic novels. Right off the start I want to say how gorgeous this William Morrow paperback edition is. I love the cover and the print is fantastic as well.\n\nGaiman’s short-story collections have always been amongst my favorites starting with Fragile Things, my first introduction to him. I mention Fragile Things because it surprised readers with an additional novella – “The Monarch of the Glen” – about Shadow Moon, the protagonist from Gaiman’s most celebrated novel “American Gods”. Trigger Warning repeated that gesture with another novella about Shadow set again after the events in “American Gods” called “Black Dog”.\n\nI remember there was some controversy surrounding the title as people didn’t consider the stories and poems published in this body of work to fit the meaning behind a “trigger warning”. If my memory serves me right there was a backlash of sorts and people were genuinely offended.\n\nThis is an excerpt from the introduction of “Trigger Warning”. You can read the full piece here.\n\n“There are things that upset us. That’s not quite what we’re talking about here, though. I’m thinking about those images or words or ideas that drop like trapdoors beneath us, throwing us out of our safe, sane world into a place much more dark and less welcoming. Our hearts skip a ratatat drumbeat in our chests, and we fight for breath. Blood retreats from our faces and our fingers, leaving us pale and gasping and shocked.\n\nAnd what we learn about ourselves in those moments, where the trigger has been squeezed, is this: the past is not dead…..”\n\n“We build the stories in our heads. We take words, and we give them power, and we look out through other eyes, and we see, and experience, what they see. I wonder, Are fictions safe places? And then I ask myself, Should they be safe places?”\n\nI urge you to read the full introduction even if you are not interested in the collection itself. It discusses a topic considering creators of content from movies to books to art everywhere and Gaiman’s opinion or theory is a solid one that I too share.\n\nI’ve talked about Neil Gaiman many, many times on this blog. His stories are worth your time. In this short-story collection they come from distant places, they are different from one another controversial to the traditional way short-story collections are constructed. So you go near and far within the span of a few pages. You travel light and never land in the same narrative.\n\nYou get to visit a tribute to Bowie, run alongside the 11th Doctor in a nightmarish scenario. You journey to caves withholding gold for a price. I love how Gaiman says that this short-story collection fails the consistency test but that’s why I quite love it. It’s hazardous and in that unknown between each story hide other smaller trigger warnings. I like to do this thing that after I’ve read a story or two I go back to the beginning of the book at the behind the scenes of each story. Beforehand I try to figure out where Gaiman might have written it, for whom, why. I never guess correctly but am always surprised at the reveal.\n\nI had many favorite stories here so I’ll just point out a few that gave me a fright at night or rattled my bones. You’ll have to discover what hides behind these titles on your own: The Thing About Cassandra (which I looked for, for ages even convincing myself at one point Gaiman hadn’t even written), Down to a Sunless Sea (which you can read here), The Case of Death and Honey, Jerusalem, The Man Who Forgot Ray Bradbury, Observing the Formalities, In Relig Odhrain and Black Dog.\n\nGRAPHIC NOVELS\n\nThe Sandman – Issues 40 to 75 by Neil Gaiman\n\nAfter so many years I finally had the chance to finish my favorite comic book series. The unraveling of its protagonist Dream of the Endless, Morpehus, Lord of Dreams ending with him becoming a tragic hero is a one of a kind journey from the dimmest corners of dark horror through the multilayered fantasy LSD trip incorporated with classical and contemporary mythology ending with the masterful artwork of Michael Zulli.\n\nI actually don’t know what to write here. This comic book series was the highlight this year as it was with its first 39 issues years back when I first discovered it. It combines everything I love in fiction ticking off genre after genre – urban fantasy, epic fantasy, occult, superhero, mythology, history. I couldn’t summarize it in such a short space here, this legend of the late 80’s and titan by the time it ended its original run in 1996.\n\nDream of the Endless is perhaps my all times favorite character. I’ve always thought there’s a hint of Gaiman himself in his visual.\n\nI was trying to pick an issue or issues that I really loved but it’s very hard. Worlds’ End is amongst them in which travelers from different universal plains or realms are stuck in an endless inn called “Worlds’ End” whilst a reality storm roams outside. They tell stories to pass the time and each story is narrated by a different character. “A Tale of Two Cities” is told by a city dweller who one day finds himself in what he thinks to be a dream or opposite version of the city in which he lives, but then he meets an old man stuck there who explains his fear that the cities will someday awaken because they too sleep and are aware of wandering people through them. “Cerements” the fifth story is told by a ‘prentice’ from the necropolis Litharge which is basically a city devoted to the processes of multicultural burial. During these storytelling sessions a funeral procession crosses the sky and that perhaps is one of the most frightening things I’ve seen drawn on paper. It’s also a neat foreshadowing.\n\nThe Sandman: Overture has been sitting on my shelf since last bloody Christmas and I’m really excited to be able to finally read it because I didn’t want to start it before The Sandman was done.\n\nIf you haven’t by this day and age read any Sandman please, please do so especially if you enjoy the genres it combines. You will not regret it.\n\n***\n\nThe Dark Night: A True Batman Story by Paul Dini\n\nI actually did an extended review on this autobiographical graphic novel some weeks ago. You can check it out here. It includes some additional thoughts and memories about Batman, some personal aspects regarding the idea behind the Caped Crusader and is filled with links to cool blogs and videos.\n\nI will shamelessly pull out a paragraph from that review and paste it here!\n\nDini, a lifelong Batman fan is a lucky man as he is writing stories for his idol. Alas he isn’t a happy man. In the first pages of the graphic novel Dini tells the story of a loner, battling low self-esteem and fighting to float above but always drowning in his self-manufactured misery that generates from falling for shallow women mistaking him with a BFF ticket to a Hollywood success. Then one night, in 1993, as he is taking a long walk home Dini gets attacked, mugged and brutally beaten. He survives the attack but spirals down a cycle of self-pity, self-harm, alcohol and abstinence from Batman.\n\n“So…I got beat up.”\n\nThat’s how the autobiographical story opens and throughout it we as readers get to experience a painful yet oddly humorous transition from the pretend happiness of a loner to the downright scary self-harming psychological daymare infested with Batman’s cast pouring criticism and bullying Dini into submission or opposition.\n\nI really enjoyed it not knowing what exactly I was getting myself into and after I read it I was confused for a while until my brain processed the brutal impact this story delivers and how true it speaks for the darkness lurking inside of us in moments of vulnerability. I highly recommend it.\n\n***\n\nThe Nikopol Trilogy by Enki Bilal\n\nBy far the weirdest thing I read this year. I remembered the movie Immortel (ad vitam) which was really bizarre to me and I got the vague notion that it was based on a graphic novel. Truly it is, written in French by Yugoslavian born Enki Bilal between 1980 and 1992.\n\nSo, check this out. The central plot of the science fiction trilogy, set in a dystopian, technopolis 2023 Paris, follows one Alcide Nikopol, a man returning, more like crashing to Earth after a 30-year sentence spent orbiting our planet in a cryopreservation chamber/capsule. He finds himself in France under fascist rule following two nuclear wars. Also there’s an Egyptian pyramid doubling as airship hovering above the capital. Le immortel gods are stuck there because they don’t have fuel and the government doesn’t want to give them any. Also they want to revive their rule over humanity. Can you imagine a pyramid hovering above Trump tower demanding fuel or promising destruction? I can.\n\nAlas, Horus isn’t having any of that, so he hopes down to Paris and possesses crashed Nikopol’s body sharing his immortality with the fragile human. Together they concoct a conspiracy that would overthrow the regime and screw the ancient gods plans.\n\nIf any of this doesn’t grab your attention here is a snapshot.\n\nHellblazer, book 2: The Devil You Know & book 3: The Fear Machine by Jamie Delano\n\nI guess Hellblazer will always have a place on my Best Reads lists until the day I finish all issues and all spin-offs. I’m madly in love with it. Book 1 was rightfully included in my 2015 list and back then I said how much I loved Constantine as a character. He is right there with Morpehus from The Sandman, an equally complex character though vastly more nuanced. He’s only human after all, though he dabbles in inhuman practices.\n\nOnce more I can only urge you to introduce yourself with the multidimensional, dark and oft gory universe of Hellblazer, the charming John Constantine battling demon after demon. It’s quite political at times as well, so mind that.\n\n***\n\nHONORABLE MENTIONS\n\nDeath: The High Cost of Living by Neil Gaiman\n\nDeath of the Endless is my second favorite character in the Sandman universe. I really wanted to go as her this Halloween but couldn’t muster the courage. She is a complex character as Death should be and when I saw that there was a separate story involving her as the protagonist I had to read it.\n\nSimply put one day in every century, Death has a tradition to walk the Earth in order to better understand people, those to whom she takes the hand last. She becomes a young mortal girl named Didi.\n\nDidi befriends Sexton, a teenager typing his death note on the computer one afternoon. It isn’t a suicide note to say. It’s a way to say he’s tired. It’s all pointless.\n\nBut after accidentally meeting Didi he spends the most remarkable time in his life in her company and together they help a 250-year old homeless woman find her missing heart.\n\nIt’s a heartwarming story of life, love, ones place in the world and of course Death. She as a character both mortal and immortal is enigmatic and comforting as she lays her pale hand on your shoulder and gently guides you away without fear, without concerns. Reading the three issues was a pleasing adventure offering a different mindset.\n\n***\n\nThe City of Shifting Waters (Valérian, 1) by Pierre Christin\n\nThis was a pleasant surprise. I kept hearing about the movie and how faithful it would stay to the comics. Now I’m a sucker for comics and for the original source, so naturally I had to see what the fuss was about. It turned out to be a very neat sci-fi comics with charismatic protagonists Valerian and Laureline, two Spatio-Temporal agents jumping from adventure to adventure in time.\n\nThe comic carries that 70’s style of talk and walk. It’s comical and bright in the best possible way with all the crazy sci-fi talk you’d expect.\n\n* * *\n\nSo there you have it – my #BestReadsList of 2016. Why can’t I never keep this thing short and simple? I’ll try to behave in 2017.\n\nI’ve got my hands on Foundation by Asimov, Red Rising, some Hunter S. Thompson with his Hell’s Angels memoir and an array of horror novels like Let the Right one In, The Ritual and many, many more. I’m looking forward to a diverse list for next year – classics meeting new age fiction. And a Gaiman story. Otherwise I’ll break my tradition. It’s like that House Stark saying that there must always be a Stark in Winterfell. There must always be a Gaiman in my Best Reads Lists. Funny thing that.\n\nWhat did you read this year? What made you excited about reading and about literature? Share your lists! This is the best way to exchange books!\n\nI also want to wish you a Happy New Year! I hope you will be the best you in 2017, that you will love and be loved, share happiness and comfort and you will be patient and understanding. I hope you read the best books and write the cleverest stories. Cheers guys! Xx\n\nJohn Wiswell has gathered around all the #BestReads2015 lists, so you can go and check many, many other readers/writers and the many awesome books they recommend! I’m sure you’ll find something new and exceptional amongst their favorite reads.\n\n****\n\nI messed up reading this year and I didn’t even think you can do wrong with reading and books. Apparently you can and that happens by neglecting the pile of books that you’ve started in 2015 – albeit there were a lot of BA thesis themed books that needed reading, there’s no real excuse. This might be the shortest list of books I’ve posted since doing Best Reads.\n\nAnother thing I did ( I thought wrong again) was read more short-story collections than actual novels and I beat myself up about that for quite some time but then “Trigger Warning” came in my mail much earlier than expected, and although I haven’t started it yet (ruining my Neil Gaiman dogma) there was something in the introduction pages that Gaiman wrote which made me remember something. I’ll allow myself to quote it here word by word.\n\n“I grew up loving and respecting short stories. They seemed to me to be the purest and most perfect things people could make: not a word wasted, in the best of them. An author would wave her hand and suddenly there was a world, and people in it, and ideas. A beginning and a middle and an end that would take you across the universe and bring you back. I loved all kinds of short-story collections, from the anthologies of ghosts and horror stories I’d pick up as a boy, to the single-author collections that would reshape the inside of my head.…..Still, for me, the short stories are the places where I get to fly, to experiment, to play.”\n\nAnd he’s right – there is something very special in short-story collections that offers a very different experience. I scout for interesting collections all the time, sometimes there’s a good one, sometimes there’s a bad one, but I’m always happy to have one around to come back to and be surprised every time – meet new faces, hear new stories. Perhaps in a way this year was a really good rekindling of a past love, because back in school I mostly read sci-fi and horror short-story collections, and weirdly enough my first Gaiman book was a short-story collection – “Fragile Things”, which did wonders for me and boosted my confidence in writing as well.\n\nI’m stalling – here’s the shortest of the short Best Reads 2015 lists.\n\nComics and Graphic novels\n\n“Hellblazer 1988–1991” by Jamie Delano\n\n“On the doorstep I remember I lost my key; In Patagonia. For some reason this depresses me immensely.”\n\n“Who is it?”\n\n“It’s me…John.”\n\n“John Constantine.” – from issue 1 “Original Sins”\n\nI got through the first volume of Hellblazer, I think that’s 88’ through to 91’ when Jamie Delano wrote it in his first long run– remember the political references? – and that only skyrocketed my preexisting love of Constantine. I’d met him way before in one issue of Sandman and had just a basic knowledge of his character, but instantly grew to love him for his short appearance. I did go through some other graphic novels but nothing clicked with me as much as Hellblazer did.\n\nThere are a great many things to praise in this story beginning with Constantine the cheeky, charming occultist detective to the complex, dark, gritty and dirty world he inhabits, but also in terms of writing the language Delano used and the story arcs themselves which in those first issues see the very essence of Constantine’s torment, Astrid and the happening in Newcastle.\n\nI feel I shouldn’t be talking much about Hellblazer as it’s widely popular and there are so many fans of the series out there. One should only know that it’s an incredible story that is multidimensional, it’s both dark and scary, magical and experimental and very smart and sharp too.\n\nSci-fi\n\n“The Planet of the Apes” by Pierre Boulle\n\nI actually like the book better than any of the movie adaptations and surprisingly knowing the end didn’t ruin it in any way, it was like finally getting the best version.\n\nIt’s an interesting concept and of course a frightful one, not how the apes have evolved into what we essentially are as beings, and adapting our social structure in a way, but that idea of humanity fading away during its own stride to perfect and experiment, testing supremacy and probing, always pushing the limits, curious and careless and smug. It’s a common dystopian notion that humanity fails, but Boulle managed to capture something very lonely and desolate in vast proportions with his protagonist Ulysse. It’s always believed that no matter what humans will always prevail and their intelligence will be their continuous rise until there’s nothing left to colonize, or understand or grow by, in a way making them complete, fulfilled in every sense, but as the saying goes, you are too smart for your own good and intelligence backfires unexpectedly.\n\nI feel that (SPOILERS) seeing that much of a distant future and a distant planet basically showing an absolute end of the human civilization is scarier than returning home, although technically it also shows the future to find out that the same happening has plagued your home, Earth. For me there was always a feeling in that final moment after Ulysse returns from Soror that he is the most hopeless man in history having seen the spread of ape power in the galaxy, having seen humanity’s inevitable future and at the same time returning again to a future that if it weren’t for the expedition wasn’t going to be his, and still finding himself on the path of the annihilation of his species. That’s what I call being stuck in a timeline that just sucks.\n\nHorror/ Contemporary horror in short-story collections\n\n“In The Court of the Yellow King” – anthology\n\nThe first anthology short-story collection I grew to love was “In the Court of the Yellow King”. The stories explore the King in Yellow mythos in different scenarios and if one’s not so familiar with the name, Ambrose Bierce and Richard W. Chambers both wrote about this alien, god-like entity hailing from the distant, barren land of Carcosa. In “An Inhabitant of Carcosa”, a short story written by Bierce is when the ancient city of Carcosa and the King are first mentioned; from then Chambers borrowed that and developed the mythos of that land, fitting it into the narrative of a cursed fictional play called “The King in Yellow”.\n\nThemes from that story went on to be a part of some stories from the Cthulhu Mythos. Because neither Chambers nor Bierce before that linger too much or are too detailed on the King himself, this anthology of brilliant and weird short-stories tries to expand his character and his world, his kingdom (which might be near Aldebaran). If you enjoy Lovecraft, and Chambers or Bierce, you’ll probably like the anthology. It pays great homage to the mythos and their respective works. I think ‘Who Killed the King of Rock and Roll?’ by Edward Morris might be one of my favorite stories in that collection, if not the favorite, it’s very swamp-like, very “True Detective”, old and dusty. It’s Elvis man.\n\nBut yes, it’s a very versatile collection as there are Vikings and then hovercars. Also the Carcosa Vikings were terrifying in their soundless and alien-like arrival to pillage and shed blood!\n\n“Machine of Death: A Collection of Stories About People Who Know How They Will Die” – anthology\n\nShort-story collection number 2 was ‘Machine of Death: A Collection of Stories About People Who Know How They Will Die”, again an anthology which I found on Goodreads. It’s essentially filled with stories about a machine which predicts death via one word written on a piece of paper – you put money in it, or whatever it wants, it takes a few seconds then spits out a tiny white paper which say, has written on it “Bubble gum” – how you die by that bubble gum is a question worth your life and sanity.\n\nAll the stories pose a set of moral dilemmas – would you want to know how you’ll die, but also understand that you wouldn’t be able to prevent it? Would you spend the rest of your life trying to avoid apples, because that’s what the paper said? It doesn’t specify how or when you’ll die.\n\nWould it be a relief knowing and just await death while you live reinvigorated by the concrete certainty of your predicted demise – take the best of life and make it last? How would one society where everyone knows how they’ll die function? Which persons are going to shatter at the weight of that information, and which are going to use it to their advantage?\n\nIt’s an interesting anthology and a funny one – there are a lot of chuckles in it and I love dark humor. It explores different reactions and interactions with the machine. Each story just goes to show how peculiar we people react to news with such gravitas. I recommend it. Also there’s a second collection titled “This is How You Die: Stories of the Inscrutable, Infallible, Inescapable Machine of Death”.\n\n“Books of Blood” vol.1 & 2 by Clive Barker\n\nI started reading Clive Barker’s ‘Books of Blood’ and have gone through vol. 1 and 2 thus far, and I have to say, the stories are phenomenal. I don’t know what took me so long to start reading Barker. I fell in love two pages in.\n\nThe sense of, I don’t know, madness and hopelessness is intriguingly charming; they are very solid feelings, very real in the sense of the narrative. I feel really calm when I read Barker, though its humanity’s demise and the individual persons torment that he explores but the stories are just so out there and monstrously huge, oozing weirdness and impossibilities and psychopaths. They are beautiful. I think ‘Pig Blood Blues’ is my favorite from vol. 1 and ‘Hell’s Event’ & ‘The Skins of the Fathers’ from vol. 2\n\n“The Willows” by Algernon Blackwood\n\n‘The Willows’, which I did for NaNoReMo (the National Novel Reading Month) as harmless of a story as it is in its beginning, is actually a mind-boggling, stressful experience which very much deprives you of your common sense. As vivid as it is in the sense of its narrative, it’s like staring into pitch black the entire time you’re reading it.\n\nIt positions the reader into an impossible situation resulting from a very natural phenomenon, and it goes to show how frail and how susceptible our mind is to its own tricks and horrors.\n\nI talked a lot about it in updates on the reading process and I don’t want to repeat myself, but ‘The Willows’ will most definitely remain one of the most emblematic pieces I’ve read this year. Blackwood created for me the noisiest, most atmospheric horror which in my mind crisscrossed with Bierce and Chambers and created a cacophony of monsters and voodoo and rituals.\n\nYA/Gothic Horror\n\n“The Monstrumologist” by Rick Yancey\n\nA long, long time ago I used a quote from a book written by Rick Yancey called “The Monstrumologist”. Adequately I put it on a story about Monsters. Years later I found Yancey’s book re-priced in Costco and wondered for a long time where have I heard the title when it hit me – it was an instant purchase, just based on that one quote – “Yes, my dear child, he would undoubtedly tell a terrified toddler tremulously seeking succor, monsters are real. I happen to have one hanging in my basement.”\n\nThe novel I have is the first of four and it’s set in town New Jerusalem in 1888 where a Monstrumologist – a monster-hunting in this case doctor and his assistant a boy of 12 unravel a mystery, a case involving the sudden appearance of the mythological species Anthropophagi brought from Africa (Echoes to Eco’s “Baudolino” and many more explorer’s guides) who have infested in a very brutal manner the small town. They are not wonders or curiosities to admire, they are ruthless hunters, nesting babes in dead bodies, eating raw human flesh, towering at 7 ft. high and jumping twice their size.\n\nAlthough the story is told from the perspective of the boy, Will Henry, the peculiar character is the doctor- Pellinore Warthrop. If any of you have read or remember from last year’s list V.E. Schwab’s “Vicious” and its main protagonist Victor Vale, Warthrop is a very similar character to Victor in his cold demeanor, his meticulousness, and maybe he even cranks up the cold, cool, collected level a bit more than Vale. He’s very cold and apathetic, even ruthless towards Will Henry or mundane human emotions and reactions. He has a big case of egomania, and his ambition doesn’t allow him to show empathy even if he feels it, but the scary part about him is his drive to achieve whatever his goal is no matter the cost, the people hurt, the people dead.\n\nI love characters like him, I love very intelligent protagonists who conduct from reason, data, facts and know how to handle themselves. It’s quite interesting because for characters like him there’s never truly a backstory, a pre-dating reason for their behavior and loneliness. I find it very easy to connect to characters like that and when they aren’t at the very center of the story they are just a wonderful subject to observe and deduce even. Victor Frankenstein had that offed charisma about him, Erik aka The Phantom (of the Opera) had that aura about him. Get what I mean?\n\nThe Monstrumologist is a very interesting read; it has a wonderful setting that is true to the nature of its story and to its respected time. The monsters are scary and very different from what one can usually find in a YA/ Gothic Horror novel ( I think it fits the Gothic Horror genre more, but it could be balancing in the middle, I don’t know).\n\nThe other 3 novels from the series greet with more monsters both mythological and not – the second one has a Wendigo in it, and I love Wendigos! Do you love Wendigos?\n\nNon-fiction/ Autobiography\n\n“The Disaster Artist: My Life Inside The Room, the Greatest Bad Movie Ever Made” by Greg Sestero\n\nSomething non-fictional that caught my interest was ‘The Disaster Artist: My Life Inside The Room, the Greatest Bad Movie Ever Made’, which as the title suggests is an inside look into the birth and making of the movie “The Room”. If you don’t know what that is, check it out on YouTube, be awed, dumbstruck, frightened, curious, sleepless and then read the book to salvage your soul.\n\nIt’s worth it as it strips naked the weird story behind the bizarre filming of “The Room” and of Tommy Wiseau (you know him, don’t you?) and it’s a very honest and direct book written by non-other than Greg Sestero the guy who plays the protagonists best friend/ enemy Mark (the protagonist is Tommy Wiseau who also produced, directed, wrote and God knows what else the movie). James and Dave Franco are filming a movies based on the book and that should be hilarious.\n\n***\n\nI was a poor child this year and I was to blame for that, since I robbed myself of the pleasure of reading all the “to be finished” books. It feels like cheating to add some 50-70% finished books to the Best Reads list, though I’ve done that last year I think, so instead of doing that, alongside the tiny Best Reads list I decided to post a To Finish List… of all the books that were started throughout 2015, but were not finished out of my own stupidity. In a way it’s a New Year’s resolution.\n\nThis list, which is to be completed at the very start of 2016, includes:\n\nAnno Dracula by Kim Newman – 44% in\n\nElric of Melnibone Book 1 by Michael Moorcock – 52% in\n\nLast Rituals by Yrsa Sigurdardottir – 20% in\n\nThe Lies of Locke Lamora Book 1 by Scott Lynch – 20% in\n\nThe Loney by Andrew Michael Hurley – 11% in\n\nWhitstable by Stephen Volk – 20% in\n\n1Q84 Book 2 by Haruki Murakami – 10% in\n\nTrigger Warning by Neil Gaiman – 5% in\n\nBlack House by Peter Straub & Stephen King – 45-50% in\n\nWhat did you read throughout the year?\n\nBetter late than never! This week, all the way through New Year we’re celebrating Best Reads 2014! Guys, the rules are simple: list up your favorite books that you read for the first time this year, and write about them however you like – mostly share what you loved about them, and what about them moved you so that they became a favorite read. Now behold – the #bestreads2014 book lovers list (so far!):\n\nJohn Wiswell\n\nKatherine Hajer\n\nSonia Lal\n\nMargit Sage\n\nIf you too have blogged about it, leave a comment below and I’ll add you to the list. If you don’t have anywhere to write about it, be mostly welcome to just post your list in the comments.\n\nMy only regret is I didn’t read any Sci-fi novels. Well, there’s always next year and I’m open to suggestions from your lists!\n\nHere are my picks for this year:\n\nFiction / Fantasy\n\n“Vicious” by V.E. Schwab\n\nVicious was a big surprise! I wasn’t familiar with author V.E. Schwab, and I usually don’t often get books with unfamiliar authors to me, but I’m so glad I did this time. It’s such a fast paced, enthralling story about superheroes and supervillains and how we can’t always say which is which. It’s about two friends and their ambitions, and madness for something forbidden; its a story of greed and jealousy, of friendship and betrayal and powers that come with the messed up cold curiosity to test the human limits, to go beyond and discover if EOs – Extra- Ordinary people, exist. And they do and It’s like X-men (sort of)!\n\nIt’s amazing how tight this story feels and what a comfortable, though intense, universe it inhabits – all characters have their own problems and it was easy enough for me to get involved in them all. It’s strict, collected, not only in the way it is written, but in the way it guides the reader along; it also never flatters an outside world, suggesting of a pantheon of self-made superheroes. No, it stays put bouncing the reader between two timelines, two pinpointed happenings unfolding in grand, scary scenes. And it shines a big, bright light on humanity.\n\nThe story goes back and forth between the present and ten years ago. In the present protagonist (for me) Victor Vale (who’s also a character in my liking with his cool demeanour, pale face and black clothing) is an escaped convict, determined to find his old friend, now enemy Eli Ever, who although I list as antagonist for some may be the hero and not the villain; on a side not that’s the beauty of this book; I think the other novel I had this side-choosing feeling with was Mary Shelley’s “Frankenstein”. Victor and Eli are strange personages who made me endure both their jealousy and admiration for one another; theirs is a complex friendship, and it’s one that burns only with hateful and obsessive emotions – ten years ago I found them to be two bright college students, with somewhat unorthodox ideas, one being the idea to discover whether EOs exist and whether going through a NDE, near – death experience may grant them supernatural abilities. And boy does that insane experiment go wrong…\n\nIt’s a rare privilege to find a book such as Vicious that captivates through and through, with both plot and characters – I carry them in my mind when I go mental in a story. Thanks V.E. Schwab!\n\n“Horns” by Joe Hill\n\nI’ve developed an even stronger taste for uncomfortable tales; the more uncomfortable the events, the happier I am. And I still love supernatural suspense. It drives around in my head at night, horrible and exciting. Can’t help but follow.\n\nEver since NOS4A2 I’m a fan of Joe Hill and to admit with all the fuss going about the movie adaptation of Horns I had to know beforehand the story and months before the movie came out I picked this beauty. It’s a rough one full of perversions so beautifully written they beg for admiration rather than redemption. See what I mean? Uncomfortable tales. It’s also emotionally compelling and painful to read at places – it gets you hooked fast, then kills you in small dozes of negativism. But I handled that, and pushed forth.\n\nI debated whether Horns should have a place in the list, but after some consideration I think it does – if it kept me up at night and reading, if it evoked vivid images and made me churn or grin, I think it does belong here. I read somewhere that the supernatural element wasn’t as scary, but I ask does it have to be, and what does scary supernatural actually look like? At least for me a majority of people, trusted, loved ones who compelled by said infamous horns admit things no one would want to hear is the truly scary part.\n\nHorns is an ambivalent story, both in character development and scenery development; as Ignatius Perrish aka Iggy goes from a good child from a good family with high ambitions and a lovely girlfriend to a grotesque representation of himself, and I quote “Ignatius Perrish spent the night drunk and doing terrible things. He woke up the next morning with a thunderous hangover, a raging headache . . . and a pair of horns growing from his temples.” so does his world and viewpoint.\n\nI’m glad I chose book over movie – the movie felt like skipping stones on a lake with every gap between the stone touching surface a missed something. I also loved the hand in hand with the Devil which takes on a quest to find through ill spoken words, cruel thoughts and love-less, the truth about who killed Merrin. I recommend it – it’s bizarre, perhaps offensive, perhaps tiring or emotionally draining, but exciting and it does evoke an ache to find out everything. It makes you slightly suspicious too…\n\n“1977” by David Peace\n\nYes. This is one of those reads too – grim, cynic, villanous, utterly compelling and unpleasant cover to cover. It’s a British cop-novel, one of four, second in the Red Riding Quartet, a story of brutal murders and missing children and rotten cops and hookers.\n\nInteresting about this dark, violent and vicious novel is that it reads like a written nightmare – it’s a rampage through self-doubt, unhealthy obsessions and surreal nightmares narrated by one sergeant Bob Fraser and a veteran reporter named Jack Whitehead. The story develops in the seventies in a time in which in the North of England a very particular monster ravaged – the Yorkshire Ripper.\n\nIt’s a bit difficult to explain as the story follows events from the first book which I adored, but lost when my original mobi was corrupted – I never read the end of it. But without confusing a whole lot to you – 1977 is a harsh story. It talks through the cynical, often lyrical and poetic voices of its two tormented characters – Jack living with his visions of murdered women in his room, a sweaty reality vs dreams, struggles and fought battles, and Bob with his obsession with a prostitute whose life might be in danger, and who’s his silent sin. It’s a story of police brutality and corruption, torture investigations, fear, piss, demons, darkness, depravity, self-pity, self-destruction, fucked up humanity (pardon my language). If one is looking for something different and challenging, this book in a series be the one.\n\nYA Fantasy\n\n“Miss Peregrine’s Home for Peculiar Children” by Ransom Riggs\n\nThis book got me very excited when I learned it mixes very rare and peculiar (har har) vintage photography with fiction. I began reading expecting ghosts to be honest, because look at the cover – a creepy little girl floating!, but it turned out to be an adventure book, although at first creepy, a light one in terms of reading and experiencing, which entertained without a problem my stormy nights in bed. I know it was originally intended to be just an almanac of these vintage photos, in their edited or original state, but I’m actually glad it was turned upon suggestion into a book. I think it offers some interesting concepts to the YA genre – there are time loops, tentacle monsters called hollows who raid loops and attack peculiar children and their protectors called ymbrynes, in order to eat them and become wight, the full scary white-eyed monsters. The peculiar children belonging to different time zones have amazing abilities – the sad part is how they need to stay hidden inside those time loops, forever, some repeating the same day over and over again, never aging, never leaving unless they want to age forward and crumble in ashes.\n\nThe story opens with Jacob, who is an ordinary American boy surviving through the untimely death of his grandfather and the nightmares evoked by the glance at something supernatural. In order to battle his demons, Jacob goes to a remote island off the coast of Wales, a place his grandfather has often told young Jacob about, a place he calls home with people he calls family. That’s Miss Peregrine’s Home for Peculiar Children which I admit had me thinking ghosts even more with its crumbling facade, empty bedrooms and echoing hallways; it’s a bombed home in the middle of a misty bog covered island, still keeping remnants in both looks and atmosphere of 1941. The giggle of children and the footsteps though turn out to be something else – a group of peculiar children who still live in 1941, in the day the bomb on their home fell. And Jacob goes with them on a journey to save their kind.\n\nThe photos work great for the story, although the story is written around them, but then again some fail in a way – it feels as if they try too much to fit where they don’t belong. Don’t understand me wrong, it’s still a good adventure book through mist and bogs, with nightmarish monsters following closely, and I enjoyed it, in fact I’m currently reading through the second part called “Hollow City”.\n\nIf you’re feeling like something peculiar I say try this.\n\nAlternate history\n\n“1Q84” by Haruki Murakami , Part I\n\nComplex and intriguing characters. Whoever said this book is a slow read forgot to look around and see how much it resembles our lives – slow, get-to-know, mysterious. Murakami has a divine interaction with the world – he has the ability to demonstrate how a very common object, or a conversation might be disguised to prevent us from seeing its true purpose.\n\nI stood in a bookstore for about an hour choosing my next read and had the trilogy 1Q84 in hand the whole time. I ended up buying it, remembering a good review a friend had given some time ago. I wasn’t disappointed. I was amazed at how different from my general reading list this book was.\n\n1Q84 is a strange book. It’s full of parallels and surrealism. I’ll allow myself to paraphrase a sentence from some Goodreads review I memorized. It said reading Murakami is like diving into the ocean only to find out you’ve always been a fish – it somehow makes sense, all of it, everything, but not in a way you can explain to others. Such weird power. The story with its timid development happens in the real world, no doubt about that, but in that real world there are things that shouldn’t be there, or explainable – there are two moons in the sky. Tengo and Aomame guide, each with his own chapter, through their lives, which in many ways are intertwined. Something dangerous is happening, changes are made and no one has noticed, and a strange girl called Fuka-Eri, who asks her questions without the proper intonation and speaks only when she finds need to do so, comes to Tengo – a teacher inspired to be a writer. He is offered to rewrite her oddly written, but winning submission manuscript Air Chrysalis. She grants him that and the birth of her strange world, and afterwards Tengo goes on to find through her guardian, the story of her family disappearing in a commune. Aomame, the female protagonist, is a gym instructor by day and an assassin for sexual abusers at night; she names her world 1Q84 for all the differences from 1984, where in her private, solemn life and history changes appear.\n\nLike floating, this book, this first part. I often recommend it to friends who talk to me about wanting to write books with parallels and rebirth and sense of moments in life that are special. It helps, I guess. It’s like a guide in a way.\n\nI love how I still am not quite sure of that world – I know it real, but can it be? Weird.\n\nShort story collection\n\n“Blind Willow, Sleeping Woman” by Haruki Murakami\n\nMurakami appears twice in my list and it’s for a reason. I suppose it’s good I became curious with his work that I ended up having this collection of 24 stories which offer a great range of emotions and interpretations. Again I admire his ability to write fiction about how the surreal finds itself in our ordinary lives as a natural presence.\n\nReading each story takes time, or rather makes you take your time; it’s no rush. They are like dreams, that are being described, but not explained, beginning here and ending there, maybe with no relation between the two points, maybe a story within a story. It delves into sickness, death, society, loneliness, family, marriage, sex, love, guilt, dreams – a wonderful plethora that anyone can corresponded with. I did. I took ideas and insinuations, I took atmosphere and a viewpoint to charge up a lonely work in progress, grant it with that sense of surreal in ordinary. I trusted what I learned from Murakami’s many curious and willing to share protagonists.\n\nThe story collection is both like life and like dreams; it mostly makes sense, but it’s satisfactory and offers a different view-point and grasp if reality. It breaks into pieces emotions and tries to understand them. It does what Ligotti has also spoken about – it tries to portray a world were things happening cannot be explained.\n\nIf I have to choose one story that stood out and to this day feels close that’ll be the title one, Blind Willow, Sleeping Woman. It tells of a 25-year old man returning to his hometown after a five-year absence. He accompanies his 14-year-old cousin to the hospital, where a new ear specialist will perform a procedure on the boy’s ear – the cousin’s hearing has been ruined and this procedure offers a new hope for the damage to be removed.\n\nNow I sat at a similarly described hospital cafeteria waiting on an ear inspection of my little sister and watched the sunlight play through the jungle illustrated windows. It was as surreal and dreamlike as in the story. And I hadn’t even met with Murakami then.\n\n“Smoke and Mirrors” by Neil Gaiman\n\nIt wouldn’t be a list if there’s no Neil Gaiman in it!\n\nI adore Gaiman’s short story collections – “Fragile Things” was a brilliant read that introduced fables and myths in a modern way, almost presented as a gift to fit the generation, to fit the times, and I loved every bit of it. Smoke and Mirrors is the previous one, and it was published in 1998. If I was to make a comparison between the two, it’s without a doubt that Smoke has the bolder approach, the more violent and sexual representation of myths and fables and folklore. But in any other aspect it’s pure Gaiman in his fabulous imagination and gripping story-telling.\n\nIt was hard finding the book in its original English print, and after years I finally came across it and it has come into my hands through someone else who was generous, or bored, or desperate, or happy, or whatever enough to give it away. Anyways I spotted it in a bookstore bringing in English second-hand literature of all kinds, and I quickly gave the book a second life – it sits on my desk even now.\n\nThe collection is diverse and it includes stories influenced by Lovecraft and Moorcock; there is a writer struggling through a screenplay whilst in LA in a story about Hollywood old and the new movie studios titled The Goldfish Pool and Other Stories which I loved so dearly; there is a folklore tale of a man-eating fox in disguise, a story of a lonely man spending his life Looking for the Girl, who is always 19, even in the distant future; there is a story about sex changes due to a disease curing drug; there is the charming Innsmouth visited by a backpacker and Lawrence Talbot, the werewolf investigating sea creatures; there are angels and demons and trolls and knights seeking the Grail from an elderly lady. It’s quite the experience, a shivery and jittery and futuristic and mythical experience. To those who know how much I respect and admire Neil Gaiman I needn’t say more – I’m in awe, completely swooped away by his stories. And get this – there’s even a hidden story in the introduction. Never skip that when reading Gaiman!\n\nHorror\n\n“The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde” by Robert Louis Stevenson\n\nMy NaNoReMo choice definitely deserves a place here! The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is a remarkable story that left its marks on me and ever since the beginning of the year I’ve thought back to it.\n\nI enjoyed the traumatizing experience of a very sensible man chased by very real and agonizing doubts about his dear friend and an upcoming peril, and I undoubtedly loved the carefully sewn bizarreness of this misshapen and unearthly personage that is Hyde, and the ungodly secret that unfolds by the words and the witness of a friend, and friendship is a mighty powerful thing. I was and am excited about the novella. I dramatize over it still, long after that unsettled feeling of uncertainty and unsure horror that filled the atmosphere and brought the scenes a-live. Even when Henry Jekyll was himself, that was a brief occurrence, rapidly pushed aside by a new attack of solitude and nightly weeping and I love that, because even with the few let-us-know paragraphs of Jekyll’s usual nature and connection to other parties, it was still enough for me to get the idea in my head that whatever is happening to this man is brutal and disturbing in every possible way and it should seek solution, which I as the reader want as well. Or not, because oddly I devoured those scenes of changing and studied them closely. Hyde is spectacular, for he is in pain whenever and he is in suffering. If you’re looking for a NaNoReMo choice for 2015, I highly recommend, no I insist this novella to be chosen!\n\nAutobiography\n\n“On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft” by Stephen King\n\nI’ll keep this short – I felt a bit scolded and I felt a bit overwhelmed. I took a lot in and worked on it and stared out the window of the train angry at myself, then angry again for being angry at something I can fix, something I can learn from and change. And I took mental notes. They helped. I paid attention. I agree, it’s a must read for people writing. It’s frank and practical and doesn’t lose time pretending with banal rules. Its honest – King tried and truly gave pieces of advice that work, that have been tested. Those adverbs! You know what I mean….\n\nBut I greatly enjoyed the get- to -know Stephen King better, and I’ve always wanted to do that. Why did I wait so long?\n\nI’m ever thankful Stephen King wrote this book, which I put into my autobiography shelf, because to me in a way it is; his memory and his life have flown into mine and I have imprinted in my head these flashbacks of his childhood, and family, and meeting his wife, that he constructed vividly and told honestly. Having an inside look into his life and the stories behind creating some of his most famous works was a remarkable experience – take Carrie for instance. King worked as a janitor at a high school. Cleaning the girls’ locker room he noticed a little metal dispenser box and upon asking what was that the other janitor told him – it was for “pussy pluggers.” Research and that information granted, the opening pages of Carrie were written.\n\nThe King I had in my head suddenly became a very real person who not only build up rules and pointed out mistakes and wrote DO NOT DO examples, but he offered his personal story. It amused me King saying how he hated it, writing it, thinking it. It amused me how much I didn’t know about him and his addiction and his family and how he pinned those rejection letters on a nail.\n\nThis book is a good friend and a worthy traveling companion.\n\n“The Art of Asking” by Amanda Palmer\n\nI have a hard time asking for help, or advice, especially regarding my writing. I’ve hardly spoken about how dear to me writing is with family or friends – they know I sometimes do it. And what it is, no one asks. And I never ask to be asked. See what a loop I’ve created? Anyhow…\n\nThe Art of Asking found its place in my list very quickly and I’m still going through it. I know, I overstep the rules, but since the hype around it is still warm and what is written inside it is warm in my heart right now, I decided to add it.\n\nIt’s a very honest book, a raw written story about art and living with the passion for it. It’s a book about how to ask for all those things we find not worthy of having, or asking for, all those things that makes us feel like we’re begging, rather than emanating a cry for help. We expect rejection and fear other people. We try not to embarrass ourselves. And all along help might have been there. But trust wasn’t. Pride and shame were.\n\nIt can either make you laugh or cry, sometimes both. Every page is as honest as it can get, Amanda Palmer describing her time as a living statue, her interaction with people, her greatest success, worst fears, bad boyfriends, good boyfriends, her songwriting, her marriage (to Neil Gaiman, but that’s not the reason I bought the book – I know of Amanda Palmer long before she and Neil Gaiman knew each other – I was and still am a fan of her band The Dresden Dolls). It’s a very human book if I can say so, very messy and lovable, and heartbreaking a bit, because it contains a soul that explodes in those pages, and if you trust it like I did it may give you something very precious. Maybe a way to ask. Maybe a journey.\n\nGraphic novels/ comic books\n\n“Preacher” by Garth Ennis and Steve Dillon\n\nThe late 1990s were great! Look what they gave birth to and nourished – a very graphic and violent comics about the American skies, gasoline stained roads and gory VIP parties that load on craziness and drugs; but it’s also about the meaning of life, the price of death, the price of love and redemption; it also comes along with lots of sex, booze, blood, firearms, Nirvana, demons, angels, vampires, ghosts, God, and other freaks and psychos, and perverts.\n\nReverend Jesse Custer isn’t your typical holy character – he rolls up a cigarette and goes fist first through all the above crap. All the more he has a special monster inside of him called Genesis – the power of “the Word” aka that of God; his will is a command, his command often ends up someone self-harming themselves. The small-town minister is a very badass character and his crusade is a violent and riotous one – he seeks an answer from God, but the deity is nowhere to be found.\n\nWhat I really loved about Preacher is that it allowed itself a lot of things and they work really fine for the story – all the weirdness was justifiable and I wasn’t bored even once in all 66 issues, 5 specials and 4 issue mini-series. Bring it gory! Most importantly it has a solid story, an even with road diversions it keeps going, keeps adding elements that bring a closer closure. It’s a holy wow, and if the movie manages to bring at least a little of the essence of the comics, that’ll be great…\n\n“The Wake” by Scott Snyder and Sean Murphy\n\nAs a lover of sea tales and sea creatures taking over and transforming the land into whirlpools – I loved every bit of this 10 part story. I enjoyed the ending which most people call weak, because hints throughout weren’t explained and a great deal was left to self- interpretation, but I expect such a plot development and appreciate the open to interpretations end; I think its transcendental and begs for a speculation whether it wasn’t all an insinuated dream, or an alternate dimension. I’m down with all! Also the art is great, equally dark and beautiful – I especially loved the colors in the first part.\n\nWe have a very quick beginning when Marine Biologist Lee Archer is summoned by the Department of Homeland Security to help with a new threat. Her declines fall deaf and she plunges herself into the depths of the Arctic Circle where a very badass oil rig awaits, and inside it a discovery that would change history forever; heck a discovery that would alter the future. After short things go wrong and what was caught gets loose.\n\nPart two takes us some two hundred years in the future, where the world is sunken, people trade and killing the creatures who inhabit the waters and drive people to extinction is a forbidden black market stock. The new protagonist is called Leeward- a blue-haired woman able to communicate with her pet dolphin Dash. Leeward hears a radio transmission of Dr. Archer last words as their escape shuttle is destroyed. Finding a way to preserve mankind, or to heal Earth is suddenly all based on small hopes heard in a transmission two "
