        "text": "Next Article\n\nNeil Gaiman is a prolific writer, whose fan base includes young children, teenagers, and adults.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNeil’s work includes novels, comics, and short stories, but he has also worked as a journalist and has directed two films. His most famous works include Coraline, American Gods, Good Omens, Stardust, The Graveyard Book, and Sandman, many of which have been adapted into films and/or TV series. The Ocean at the End of the Lane is the first major stage adaptation of Neil’s work.\n\nTo explore more of Neil Gaiman’s work, go to: neilgaiman.com\n\nIn many of your interviews, you talk about making mistakes. In one interview about The Ocean at the End of the Lane, you said your first thought was ‘I appear to have written a novel!’ when you finished it. Why are mistakes important?\n\nThe Ocean at the End of the Lane was meant to have been a short story. As far as I was concerned, I had a short story’s worth of plot in my head. I was just going to begin and write my short story when the story wanted to keep going and I kept going with it. You have to be willing to swim into it and make mistakes. If what you were writing was perfect writing, it wouldn’t be interesting.\n\nDon’t avoid making mistakes or be scared of it. My advice would be to make the thing you want to make anyway. There are two alternatives: One is to do the thing and make mistakes; the alternative is not to do the thing and then there are no mistakes. But it’s not fixable if you don’t do it. You’d hand in a blank piece of paper, and there’s no examiner in the world who will look at a blank sheet of paper and give it full marks.\n\nWhat can you tell us about the setting of The Ocean at the End of the Lane?\n\nI wrote the story for my wife. I wrote the story because I couldn’t take her to Sussex and show her the places where I grew up. Many of the houses have been demolished now, and the places I grew up now have houses built on them. I also used a house halfway down the real lane for where the Hempstocks live but moved it to the end of the lane in my story because it felt better. However, I completely invented a lot of stuff in the story. I took a lot of places that I knew very well, but then added a lot of fictional detail. I wanted this to be a work of invention.\n\nFood features very heavily in this story. Can you tell us more about how you write about food, and why it’s significant?\n\nFood can signal hospitality, and it can signal love. For me, if love through food is anywhere, it’s at the Hempstock house. It’s an idealised version of what I wished my grandmothers’ houses could have been.\n\nThe burnt toast that the Boy eats every morning is well intentioned, but it’s moving towards food as punishment rather than love. He then goes from his own house to the Hempstocks’ house, where the food is fabulous. Kids respond to food in a more primal way than adults do. As an adult you have more power. If you are served awful food in a restaurant, you can say it’s awful. No one is going to stand over you and say that you need to finish the food and you will stay there until you do. I remember nightmares of being forced to do that at school. Here is the Wednesday afternoon salad consisting of half an egg, a lettuce, a sad tomato with a thumb print in it and some sliced, pickled beetroot. I knew that I was not allowed to leave that table until all of that pickled beetroot was consumed. I eventually discovered that if you cut it up really small and you washed each bit of beetroot down with enough water that you couldn’t really taste it. Just sort of swallowing it like pills. You could get it down.\n\nContrast this with something like my grandparents’ house where you were welcomed: here is the soup, here is the cake. Here is what they’re having for breakfast and the golden marmalade, and now they’re going out into the garden picking blackberries, filling jam jars with blackberries – a layer of blackberry and a layer of sugar and a layer of blackberry and a layer of sugar – and then putting them aside. And then that is going to appear in various forms – then they’ll strain it and you’ll have this amazing blackberry juice. That’s food as love. It heightens the fact that when you are writing about children, for me you are writing about a lack of power. You’re writing about the efforts to claim autonomy. Ocean is a story about how to survive.\n\nDo you think the way you write about food is influenced by other writers whose work you read as a child?\n\nSome writers, yes. In The Wind in the Willows, there’s a list of food that Ratty packs to take on their journey, and there are lists of food that’s eaten all the way through the story. I also feel that the food that’s part of the plot in The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is well written. For 70 years, children have been fooled into wanting Turkish Delight. Then they try it and can’t understand why Edmund sold his soul to the devil. But the story is set in war time when there was food rationing, so it was probably more because of the sugar. A lot of people are disappointed when they taste Turkish Delight for themselves.\n\nIn The Ocean at the End of the Lane, you explore the tensions between children and adults. Can you explain more about that?\n\nChildhood is much too big to write a book about. But if you’re writing a book about a moment of childhood it seems to me that you are also trying to write about what it was like living in that world.\n\nI remember as a kid reading children’s books that felt like they were written by people who had been mindwiped – somebody is obviously writing a children’s book and they appear to have no memory of what it was like to be a child, because I’m a child, and I know it’s not like that! There was definitely a sort of promise to myself that I wouldn’t forget.\n\nI think there’s a level on which, as I enter my sixth decade, I forget more about childhood and I’m sure that that will continue. But I did find it very interesting writing about childhood as I wrote Ocean and more of that time period felt like it was opening up.\n\nThe experience of writing The Ocean at the End of the Lane was much more like when you go back to somewhere that you haven’t been for five years, and you realise that you don’t actually remember where all the roads are and where they lead. Then, because you are back there, you start to remember because you just haven’t used that stuff –and that was how writing Ocean felt. It felt like I was living partly in Florida in 2012 and partly in Sussex in 1967.\n\nIn your writing, how do you balance realism with fantasy?\n\nIt’s always a matter of making things feel so real at the beginning that when you start letting the magic happen, the strangeness happen, the fantasy happen, the reader will go with you. You know you’ve said to the reader, hold my hand we’re going to walk together and you can trust me. By the time they realise that they can’t trust you and that you let go of their hand a long time ago, it’s too late.\n\nHow did Katy Rudd (Director) and Joel Horwood (Adaptor) pitch their idea to you for a production of The Ocean at the End of the Lane?\n\nThey didn’t really have a pitch other than ‘we love it and we want to make it into a play and we have this idea for Ursula as this huge puppet. We want to use a giant raggedy puppet that you can’t really tell what the shape of it is.’ So for the next three years, there were read throughs and I’d be in London and they’d have a new draft of the script and I’d sit down and they’d read me the new draft of the script.\n\nI really enjoyed reading them but I would always have a lot of notes. A lot of them were ‘I think you’ve gone too far in this direction’. Or you know, a lot of the time the notes were ‘This is working, don’t change this’.\n\nOld Mrs Hempstock was the first thing they got right. That was great, and I said, ‘Don’t change her, you’ve got her.’\n\nThe first draft was really big on boxing, putting the Boy in boxing gloves and stuff and now it’s a little thing that happens on the stage: it’s tiny, a breath. In the first draft, the boxing gloves seemed huge and the father’s ambition for the son to be a boxer, it was just like ‘Yeah, can we dial that way, way down because that one doesn’t land for me’.\n\nIt was a process of giving notes and a process of really not knowing whether or not this thing was going to work and being okay with that. I had to be willing to let Joel and Katy get there on their own steam. And yes, I could give them notes; yes, I could guide them. But it was their journey.\n\nHow do you feel about people coming to your work via adaptations, rather than reading your work first?\n\nI don’t think there’s a wrong way to discover something that you love. I don’t think there’s a wrong path to come to things. I love P L Travers’ Mary Poppins series. I think she was a genius and the stories are deeper, better and wiser than they are given credit for. I think the Disney movie does not catch the spirit of what makes the story so brilliant. I was taken to the Disney movie when I was three and loved it, and bought my copy of Mary Poppins when I was five or six because it had a photograph of Julie Andrews on the cover. There’s no wrong way. It wasn’t like I came to it the wrong way. If that film hadn’t existed, I might never have heard of Mary Poppins.\n\nDo you have a favourite moment in the production?\n\nI think my favourite moment in the theatre is probably the doors. It’s Ursula and the doors. What I love about that is that it messes with my sense of what’s real. It sort of undoes everything.\n\nI hope it does to the person sitting in the audience what my prose does to them reading, that moment where you go, ‘Oh, I am willing to believe this. If this can happen anything can happen.’"
