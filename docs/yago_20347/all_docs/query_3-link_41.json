        "text": "Re: Dear Neil Gaiman, please stop letting people make films out of your books. Thank\n\nWhat I particularly dislike is when a story that has been successfully adapted time and time again without major changes, suddenly falls into the hands of screenwriters who think they can do better than the original. Changes are sometimes necessary, but when it's already been proven that they aren't needed for a particular story, I am annoyed by the presumption of those who feel they can improve on a classic.\n\nYes, this is what rankles the most.\n\nRe: Dear Neil Gaiman, please stop letting people make films out of your books. Thank\n\nThe difficulty in creating a film out of a book is multifaceted. First, in general, the books contain a lot of information that is difficult to translate into a visual medium (monsters, people's inner thoughts, perspective). Second, books are also in general longer in scope than a 2 hour movie can contain (see LOTR). And the most important difficulty filmmakers face when creating a movie out of a beloved book is one of the reasons that books are so delicious - they are different for each person.\n\nWhile most people can agree on the high points and low points in general of a certain book, they can then haggle indefinitely on the minor points and how something 'looks' because their own imagination has created it. Like snowflakes, I'd imagine that everyone's imagination is quite unique.\n\nI try to go in with an open mind. I figure, they'll make PC changes (Jurassic Park), they'll take shortcuts (Harry Potter) and they will try to make the story even more action/sex/cars/guns/exploding things packed because they consider those to be the big draws. Their focus is the bottom line, not pleasing the story's original fans. So while I still go to see them because I enjoyed the story, I know that there will be changes. Most often those changes aren't to my liking but I get surprised now and again. Quite often they are so far off the mark they've made a whole new story - I watched one of the early versions of Robert Ludlum's The Bourne Identity where the ending was nearly the complete opposite. I think that was when I decided to just judge movies on their own merits - did it entertain me? And not on the original story's merits - did they destroy the original story?\n\nRe: Dear Neil Gaiman, please stop letting people make films out of your books. Thank\n\ngotta say i absolutely loved the Film of Stardust. But was BORED TO TEARS with the meandering, plodding, lack of anything resembling a coherant plot in the book. the Film is one that i often recommend to people i like. and everyone i suggest it to, at the least enjoys it, and at most loves it as much or more than i do. i also, always warn them to NOT read the book, since its one of gaiman's earliest ones, if not his earliest in the Fantasy genre, and it reflects badly upon his later works. Robert de Niro's character (in the film at least) was supposed to be a ham... he was brilliant. of course Michelle Pfieffer steals every scene she's in. Charlie Cox was the perfect Tristan. Throw in a bunch of other beautiful people, and some great character actors, and theres little to fault with Stardust.\n\nMirrormask was brilliant!!! nothing more need be said. it was simply brilliant. And to think, i only randomly selected it to watch. had no idea about it other that it was a Gaiman book, adapted into a movie.\n\nRe: Dear Neil Gaiman, please stop letting people make films out of your books. Thank\n\nHmm... Ok I'll try to watch Coraline again at some point and give it another chance... But only cause it's you! And yes, De Niro was the straw that broke the Rachael's back when it comes to Stardust.\n\nI am quite fussy when it comes to what I see as things they changed for no good reason. I understand books have to be altered and bits have to be cut out for films but when they change stuff when I can't see why (eg Door has red hair, stupid BBC people!), that sort of thing really does annoy me.\n\nJust a point about the BBC messing with Neverwhere. The series came before the book so therefore it was Gaiman changing things rather than the other way around.\n\nAs for the adaptions, I've not seen anything I've disliked. Stardust was one of my favourite movies in a while, even if it was different to the book it stood out on its own merits.\n\nAnd Coraline was a wonderful film with little actual changes made, some of which I suspect may have been to dampen the terror for younger viewers (I'm thinking of how the Other Father ends up in the basement as an example.)\n\nRe: Dear Neil Gaiman, please stop letting people make films out of your books. Thank\n\ng i also, always warn them to NOT read the book, since its one of gaiman's earliest ones, if not his earliest in the Fantasy genre, and it reflects badly upon his later works.\n\nI'm not sure how much validity this statement has. Stardust was originally released as a prestige 4-issue mini-series from Vertigo, in 1997-98, when he'd already done things like Books Of Magic, The Tragical History or Comical Tragedy Of Mr. Punch and of course what continues to be his finest fantasy creation ever, Sandman.\n\nAlso, Stardust is a work that partakes of the Victorian fairy tale tradition, and I think it does a wonderful job of adding a new leaf to that particular tree of stories. Certainly, the world in that book is vivid and vital enough that Susanna Clarke was able to set a wonderful short story, The Duke Of Wellington Misplaces His Horse, in the village of Wall.\n\nRe: Dear Neil Gaiman, please stop letting people make films out of your books. Thank\n\nI'm afraid I'm deep in the 'I liked em!' camp, Bunnypeaches. I'm not sure Beowulf can be counted at all, given he was, how to say, the adaptER rather than adaptEE\n\nWhile I enjoyed them, I'm also mixed on seeing good books converted, not because I think Hollywood ruins them, but rather the transition is painful. The difficult thing to remember sometimes is that what makes a good book is not what makes a good film, which is a bitter pill when the book is one you loved. To make a good film, the book you love must be vivisected, inspected, put back together sometimes in a different order, hunks left out, mysterious insertions made, characters rewritten to fit the flow and form.\n\nThe end result is like watching a mad genius butcher your dog. You don't care if the end result is an all powerful cyborg puppy capable of ending world hunger and harnessing the fusion of the sun's core to provide infinate clean free energy - what did he do to Fluffy?!"
