        "text": "Here is the complete list of books published by Neil Gaiman, an English author of films, audio theatre, nonfiction, graphic novels, comic books, novels, and short fiction.\n\nGaiman is well-known for being one of the creators of modern comics. For his work, The Graveyard Book, he became the first author to win both Carnegie and Newbery Medals for the same novel.\n\nWho Is Neil Gaiman?\n\nBorn on November 10, 1960, in the UK, Gaiman described himself as a “feral child who was raised in libraries.” He said that it was the librarians he grew up with whom he credited his love and passion for books.\n\nHe said, “I wouldn’t be who I am without libraries. I was the sort of kid who devoured books, and my happiest times as a boy were when I persuaded my parents to drop me off in the local library on their way to work, and I spent the day there. I discovered that librarians actually want to help you: they taught me about interlibrary loans.”\n\nGaiman started his writing career as a journalist with a Duran Duran biography book as his first published work. Since then, he has collaborated with other distinguished authors and produced several significant works, such as Violent Cases and Black Orchid, published by DC Comics.\n\nOne of his highly celebrated works, Sandman, became the first comic to win the 1991 World Fantasy Award for Best Short Story. It also gathered a lot of other awards in the US in its 75 issue run, including three Harvey Awards, and nine Will Eisner Comic Industry Awards.\n\nGaiman is also known for writing for film and television series. He wrote the screenplay for the original BBC TV series of Neverwhere in 1996, and a 2011 episode of Doctor Who.\n\nHe also directed two films: A Short Film About John Bolton (2002) and Sky Television’s Statuesque (2009).\n\nNeil Gaiman is living with his wife, musician Amanda Palmer, along with their son, Anthony."
