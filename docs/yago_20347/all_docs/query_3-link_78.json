        "text": "Holly Jacobson is an ambitious director. She has three films under her belt, a modern adaptation of Hansel and Gretel in the works, and she's also only 13 years old.\n\nAfter saving money from every holiday since she was 9 (so impressive!) in order to finance her latest project Harry and Grace, things were looking like a fairytale for Holly, until a set fire blew through her budget. When the fire destroyed her custom-made fairytale cottage set, Holly was forced to turn to the internet for help by asking for donations on Indiegogo.\n\n\"The guys on site saved our props, but the fire has melted all of their power tools. The roof needs completely rebuilding,” Holly said on Indiegogo. “A lot of props that were hired are in too poor a condition and so we will need to pay for those.\"\n\nA devastating set fire is enough to shake a seasoned director, but Holly is no newbie, and when things went wrong, she stayed positive.\n\n\"Whatever happens, this film will be finished and nothing, not even a fire, will be allowed to negatively impact how the final film looks,” she said on the Indiegogo page. “I promise that this film will be finished and it will be perfect. We’ve come too far to throw in the towel now.\"\n\nSure enough, word spread fast about the project, in part because of one of Holly’s supporters — famous author Neil Gaiman.\n\n\"A fire on set means 13 year old director Holly's dream film is falling apart,\" tweeted Gaiman. \"Can you donate and help her save it?\"\n\nWith Neil and almost 100 others helping her out, Holly was able to raise the funds in a single night.\n\n\"The target was smashed just before midnight and I am so relieved. I have already gotten a new filming date agreed with the cast and I will be booking in the crew again soon,” said Holly. “It’s back on track and it’s down to you guys. Thank you so much\""
