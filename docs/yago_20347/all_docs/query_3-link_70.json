        "text": "When not adapting his own sprawling mythologies, Neil Gaiman is known for dabbling in others –– Norse, for example. For a new film project, he's collaborating with Graphic India and The Legend Of Hanuman's Sharad Devarajan on Cinnamon, a new animated adventure.\n\nCo-written by Gaiman and Devarajan, with filmmaker Jeevan J. Kang in the director's chair, Cinnamon feels like the ideal blend of a Gaiman story with Indian narrative. Here's the synopsis: \"Born with pearl eyes that render her blind to the physical world, Cinnamon’s destiny is shaped forever when a mysterious talking tiger appears. Offering to lead her through the wonders and trials of the wild, Cinnamon begins a perilous adventure that will shape her path and test her resolve. She enters a hidden realm where the line between the mundane and the mystical is as thin as a whisper and where the ancient wisdom of India breathes life into a jungle thrumming with secrets.\"\n\n\"I am thrilled to be collaborating with Sharad Devarajan and his exceptional team on Cinnamon,\" Gaiman says in a statement carried by Deadline. \"Sharad’s passion for storytelling and his deep understanding of Indian culture and mythology makes him the perfect partner to bring this tale to life. Together, we are crafting a film that will transport audiences to a world of magic, wonder, and eternal truths, a story that celebrates the transformative power of compassion and the resilience of the human spirit. I cannot wait to share this incredible journey with animation fans around the world, old and new.\"\n\n\"Neil Gaiman is one of the greatest storytellers of our time, if not all time,\" Devarajan offered. \"I am honored to bring his enchanting story of Cinnamon to audiences around the world. Inspired by Indian fables, Cinnamon weaves together the timeless theme of dharma as a young princess embarks on a journey of courage and self-discovery. At its core, it explores the universal human experience of the eternal struggle between light and darkness.\""
