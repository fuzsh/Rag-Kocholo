        "text": "A man in London encounters an injured young woman, and instantly exists only to those in London Below. As he helps the woman escape from assassins, he must try to find his way back to London Above.\n\nIt is the Brakiri Day of the Dead. They purchase a large section of the station for their holiday. That night everyone in that sector meets with people who have passed away. Most of the inhabitants of the sector are happy to see their loved ones, but Lennier's encounter leaves him with troubling news about his future.\n\nIn a fantasy world of opposing kingdoms, a fifteen-year-old girl must find the fabled MirrorMask in order to save the kingdom and get home.\n\nIn a countryside town bordering on a magical land, a young man makes a promise to his beloved that he'll retrieve a fallen star by venturing into the magical realm.\n\nWandering her rambling old house in her boring new town, an 11-year-old Coraline discovers a hidden door to a strangely idealized version of her life. In order to stay in the fantasy, she must make a frighteningly real sacrifice.\n\nThe Doctor is lured to a sentient asteroid outside of the Universe by a Time Lord distress signal and soon realises his TARDIS is in grave danger.\n\nThe Doctor takes Clara and the children she babysits to a rundown amusement park in space where Cybermen are hiding, and ready to invade the most precious place in the universe, The Doctor's mind.\n\nLucifer Morningstar has decided he's had enough of being the dutiful servant in Hell and decides to spend some time on Earth to better understand humanity. He settles in Los Angeles - the City of Angels.\n\nAn alien touring the galaxy breaks away from her group and meets two young inhabitants of the most dangerous place in the universe: the London borough of Croydon.\n\nA recently released ex-convict named Shadow meets a mysterious man who calls himself \"Wednesday\" and who knows more than he first seems to about Shadow's life and past.\n\nThe End of the World is coming, which means a fussy Angel and a loose-living Demon who've become overly fond of life on Earth are forced to form an unlikely alliance to stop Armageddon."
