        "text": "Director Henry Selick has revealed he is reuniting with Neil Gaiman for a film adaptation of The Ocean at the End of the Lane, which he describes as \"almost a sequel\" to their 2008 hit Coraline.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe fantasy novel, which was turned into a stage show at London's Noël Coward Theatre, follows a middle-aged man who returns to his hometown for a funeral, and begins to recall an eerie sequence of events that occurred during his childhood.\n\nAccording to Variety, Selick and Gaiman are currently working to get their screen adaptation funded, with a 35-page script and reams of concept art hoped to entice interest from the likes of ShadowMachine (Pinocchio) and Laika (ParaNorman).\n\nWhile not narratively linked, Selick sees a thematic connection between The Ocean at the End of the Lane and Coraline.\n\nHe explained: \"Instead of a child going to this other world with a monstrous mother, it’s a monstrous mother who comes into our world to wreak havoc on a kid’s life.\"\n\nMore like this\n\nGet exclusive film newsletters from our award-winning editorial team\n\nSign up to get alerts for movie news, reviews and recommendations\n\nEmail address\n\nBy entering your details, you are agreeing to our terms and conditions and privacy policy.

[Stop-motion] is based on the first trick photography and the original movie magic.\n\n\"[The format] can’t grow old, because it’s already old, but that doesn’t mean it’s musty and should be locked away in the attic. That just means it’s connected to something deeper and more historic.\n\n\"Our films have always had a smaller market. But they last longer, and will have a much longer life… The best stop-motion films aren’t just of this moment. They’re for all time.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCheck out more of our Film coverage or visit our TV Guide and Streaming Guide to find out what's on.
