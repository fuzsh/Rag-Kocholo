        "text": "This page is about the Great House. For the short, see: House Arryn (short)\n\nHouse Arryn[1] of the Eyrie is one of the Great Houses of Westeros. It has ruled over the Vale of Arryn for millennia, originally as the Kings of the Mountain and the Vale and more recently as Defenders of the Vale and Wardens of the East under the Targaryen, Baratheon, and Lannister dynasties. The nominal head of House Arryn is Robin Arryn with Yohn Royce holding actual power over the house.\n\nTheir lands are in the central-eastern region of the continent. Their seat is the Eyrie, a castle on a shoulder of the Giant's Lance. House Arryn's sigil is a white crescent moon and falcon on a blue field. Their house words are \"As High as Honor.\"[2]\n\nHistory\n\nBackground\n\nAccording to legend, the house was founded by Ser Artys Arryn, the Winged Knight. He is said to have flown atop a giant falcon, landing on the topmost mountain of the Vale, and defeated the Griffin King, the last of the First Men Mountain Kings. Afterward, he took the Eyrie and became the first King of the Mountain and the Vale. His descendants continued to rule the Vale ever since. The Eyrie has never fallen to invaders. During Aegon's Conquest, House Arryn repulsed a Targaryen invasion at Gulltown with Braavosi aid, but ultimately bent the knee peacefully to Queen Visenya after young boy-king Ronnel yielded the crown and Queen Regent Sharra ordered the Vale's army to stand down, for which Ronnel was allowed to ride Vhagar with the Queen.. By submitting peacefully instead of being conquered, they were allowed to continue to rule as Lords Paramount of the Vale and Wardens of the East in the name of the Iron Throne.[3][4] The Eyrie is considered impregnable and defends House Arryn from the violent Hill tribes of the Mountains of the Moon.[4]\n\nJon Arryn is the most recent head of House Arryn, Warden of the East and Defender of the Vale. He was a respected nobleman and both Eddard Stark and Robert Baratheon fostered with him.[5] The Mad King condoned the kidnap of Eddard's sister and Robert's betrothed, Lyanna Stark.[6] The Mad King had Eddard's father and brother killed for protesting against the kidnapping.[7] When he then demanded that Eddard be turned over to the King's justice, Lord Arryn rebelled, calling his banners to war. House Stark and House Baratheon followed suit. The rebels forged an alliance with House Tully through marriage, with Eddard married to Catelyn Tully and the then-elderly Jon to the young Lysa.[5][6]\n\nAfter the rebel victory in the war, Robert became King and appointed Jon as his Hand. Jon served the realm well for many years as Hand of the King. He died immediately prior to the events of the series, sparking King Robert's search for a replacement. Jon is survived by his wife Lysa and their six-year-old son, Robin.[6] Jon was investigating the legitimacy of the children of Cersei when he died. He found that they were not Robert's offspring by comparing their appearance to Robert's bastards based on the genetic preponderance for dark hair in House Baratheon.[8]\n\nGame of Thrones: Season 1\n\nLysa Arryn writes to Catelyn, falsely claiming that House Lannister were behind Jon's death. Lysa flees King's Landing with her son seeking the refuge of the Eyrie. Robert Baratheon arrives at Winterfell, and asks Eddard to replace Jon as Hand of the King.[6] Eddard accepts and begins an investigation into Jon's death.[7] He learns that Jon may have been poisoned,[9] and uncovers Jon's findings about Cersei's infidelity and Robert's lack of a trueborn heir.[8]\n\nCatelyn arrests Tyrion,[9] and brings him to the Eyrie. Lysa is attempting to isolate Robin from the rest of the Kingdom and use her role as regent to have the Vale lords protect him.[10] Tyrion tricks Lysa and is set free.[8]\n\nFollowing King Robert's death and Eddard's arrest, Catelyn implores Lysa to lend her armies to march on King's Landing along with the forces of House Stark, but Lysa refuses.[11]\n\nGame of Thrones: Season 2\n\nHouse Arryn remains neutral in the War of the Five Kings. Lysa continues to withhold her armies from leaving the Vale to aid Houses Stark and Tully.[4]\n\nGame of Thrones: Season 3\n\nTywin sends Littlefinger to marry Lysa, so that the Iron Throne can acquire the support of the Vale.[12]\n\nGame of Thrones: Season 4\n\nAfter privately admitting her role in the death of her husband, Lysa marries Littlefinger. Later, she attempts to kill Sansa, but is killed by Littlefinger.[13] Littlefinger convinces the lords of the Vale that Lysa committed suicide, and becomes Lord Protector of the Vale until Robin comes of age.[14]\n\nGame of Thrones: Season 5\n\nBaelish leaves Robin to be fostered at Runestone under the tutelage of Lord Yohn Royce.[15] In King's Landing, Baelish gains House Lannister's blessings for a plan to use the Knights of the Vale to invade the North and reclaim it for the Iron Throne.[16]\n\nGame of Thrones: Season 6\n\nLittlefinger convinces Robin to use the Knights of the Vale to help Sansa.[17] The Arryn troops camp at Moat Cailin, while Baelish travels north to offer his assistance to Sansa.[18] Though she initially denies his help, she later requests the support of the Arryn soldiers.[19]\n\nWhen the Stark army seems to be on the verge of absolute annihilation at the Battle of the Bastards, the Knights of the Vale arrive at the command of Littlefinger and Sansa, wiping out the Bolton troops, helping the Starks retake Winterfell.[20] Littlefinger subsequently declares House Arryn's support for House Stark, and the Vale lords join the Northern lords in declaring Jon Snow the King in the North. This officially brings to an end the policy of neutrality that House Arryn has held during the War of the Five Kings.[21]\n\nGame of Thrones: Season 7\n\nLord Royce and Littlefinger remain in Winterfell as representatives of House Arryn to House Stark.[22]\n\nSansa finally learns about Littlefinger's crimes against Houses Stark and Arryn, putting him on a surprise trial in which he is charged of murdering both Jon and Lysa Arryn and betraying Eddard Stark, and executed. With Littlefinger dead, and Jon pledging the North to Daenerys Targaryen, House Arryn has also become a vassal for House Targaryen.[23]\n\nGame of Thrones: Season 8\n\nLord Royce continues to represent the interests of House Arryn and the Vale in the North, serving as a prominent adviser to Sansa. The Knights of the Vale work with the Starks and their allies in preparing the defenses of Winterfell against the marching Army of the Dead.[24][25]\n\nThe knights of the Vale fight in the Battle of Winterfell. They suffer losses,[26] but House Arryn still has a formidable military in the Vale.[27]\n\nThe remaining Knights of the Vale fight alongside the Northern armies at the Battle of King's Landing.[28]\n\nAt a Great Council in the Dragonpit, Robin Arryn and Yohn Royce agree to Bran Stark's election, bringing the Vale back under the realm.[29]\n\nRelationships\n\nMembers\n\nAncestors\n\nKing Artys I Arryn, the founder of House Arryn, the Falcon Knight.

Killed by the sellsword Bronn during the first trial by combat of Tyrion Lannister.\n\nMord, a gaoler and turnkey overseeing the Eyrie's sky cells.\n\nSer Samwell Stone, a knight of the Vale in service to House Royce as the master-at-arms of Runestone.\n\nSymbolism\n\nThe banner of House Arryn (see above) is blue, the color of the sky, and features a falcon and the moon. All of these things signify that the house is high up, in this case, in the mountains. To further this point, in \"Mockingbird\", after Sansa Stark builds a snow model of Winterfell, Robin Arryn finds it and inquires whether Winterfell has a moon door. When Sansa tells him it is not in the mountains so no, he worries that must be very dangerous.\n\nThe house motto is \"As High as Honor\", signifying that like House Stark, they believe in upholding honor. However, unlike House Stark, they believe in \"talking the talk\" as opposed to 'walking the walk\", which is suggested by House Stark's motto \"Winter Is Coming\". When Tyrion Lannister calls for a trial by combat in \"A Golden Crown and Bronn therefore fights for him, Bronn implements many clever moves, something that is ultimately the downfall of Ser Vardis Egen, the champion selected by Lysa Arryn. After Bronn pushed Egen out of the Moon Door, Lysa Arryn furiously claims he \"fought without honor\" to which Bronn replies \"no, he did\" and points out of the Moon Door. Unfortunately, it can be seen that House Arryn lost their honor and pride during the War of the Five Kings under the corrupt leadership of Lysa Arryn.\n\nMilitary strength\n\nDuring the War of the Five Kings, House Arryn, as a Great House, commands formidable and capable forces but remain largely unscathed, since the Arryns never partake in the war until the Battle of the Bastards, where they arrive late in battle, thus not taking significant losses. During the Great War, House Arryn forces participate in the Battle of Winterfell and suffer large casualties (half the forces that the Vale sent to Winterfell are obliterated). Despite their losses, they later participate in the Battle of King's Landing, supporting Daenerys Targaryen.\n\nArryn soldiers equip themselves much like the rest of the Valemen, with steel cuirasses, chainmail, and simple helmets, while their rounded shields represent the moon-and-falcon sigil. Their armor lacks ornamentation, in comparison with the Lannisters or the Tyrells, but is more functional than the Northmen's and the Rivermen's armor. Knights sworn to House Arryn, however, like Ser Vardis Egen, can afford more plate armor parts than a regular soldier, like arm and leg protection, and can have their armor ornamented.\n\nFamily tree\n\nJasper\n\nArryn\n\nDeceased Lady\n\nArryn\n\nDeceased Jon\n\nArryn\n\nDeceased Lysa Arryn\n\nnée Tully\n\nDeceased Petyr\n\nBaelish\n\nDeceased Alys\n\nArryn\n\nDeceased Ronnel\n\nArryn\n\nDeceased Wife\n\nDeceased Robin\n\nArryn\n\nElbert\n\nArryn[e]\n\nDeceased\n\nIn the books\n\nIn the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, House Arryn is the oldest and purest line of Andal nobility. According to tradition, the Andals landed on the Fingers, an area of peninsulas, hills, and rivers on Westeros's eastern coast, six thousand years ago and helped conquer the Vale. Ser Artys Arryn's duel with the Griffin King is said to have taken place on the shoulder of the Giant's Lance where the Arryns later built the Eyrie.\n\nDuring Aegon's Conquest, the Arryns planned to make a stand at the Bloody Gate, the only major pass into the Vale, and gathered their armies there while the king of the Vale (a young boy at this time) and his mother, the regent, took refuge in the Eyrie. Rather than risking a bloody battle, Visenya Targaryen simply flew her dragon Vhagar to the Vale and landed in the courtyard of the Eyrie while the young king was at play. He agreed to swear fealty to Aegon the Conqueror if Visenya allowed him to ride on Vhagar. Visenya agreed, the bargain was upheld, and the Arryns and their vassals became loyal subjects of the Targaryens.[30]\n\nHouse Arryn also boasts the distinction of three times being deemed worthy of marriage into House Targaryen (who usually opted for the Valyrian tradition of incestuous marriage to keep their bloodlines pure). Perhaps the most famous example was Aemma Arryn, the first wife of King Viserys I and the mother of Rhaenyra. In a tribute to her mother, Rhaenyra even created her own unique heraldry that incorporated the Arryn sigil.\n\nDuring the summer they rule over the Vale from the Eyrie, but during the winter they descend to the Gates of the Moon, a castle at the foot of the mountain. The Gates of the Moon have not appeared in the television adaptation and the House Arryn is depicted residing at the Eyrie in winter.\n\nJon Arryn and Lysa Tully's son is called \"Robert\", not \"Robin\", in the books. This change was made to prevent confusion with Robert Baratheon or Robb Stark. George R.R. Martin approved this change, noting that Robert Arryn's nickname in the books, \"Sweetrobin\", remains intact.\n\nIn the books, the heraldry of House Arryn is specifically sky blue (bleu celeste), but in the TV series it is simply blue (azure), like House Tully's heraldry. The coat of arms is also a little different: a sky-blue falcon soaring against a white moon, on a sky-blue field.\n\nKnown members\n\nLord {Jon Arryn}, the former head of the family.
