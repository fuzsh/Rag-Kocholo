        "text": "Time I suppose to see\n\njust what Ive been doing\n\nwriting poemslost, in the\n\nmiddle of a dark wood\n\nor whateverat any rate fifty,\n\nand enrolled, for this degree. (For why?\n\nyou ask, as in fact I ask myself.) I know\n\nwhat I think Ive been doing\n\nbut these things will have\n\nchanged, over time. Changes I sometimes\n\nwill have noticed merely,\n\nother times willed. But sometimes\n\nI will have noticed nothing\n\nor stopped, after a time, noticing.\n\nAnd I will have changedmy ideas\n\n(though ideas were not important to me\n\nin the sense of themes to pursue'\n\nonly that there should be some), my\n\nstyle and conception of formas\n\none gambit after another\n\nruled itself out, through repetition,\n\nor my glands and reflexes grew (I'm not sure what I mean here\n\ngaining wisdom and sclerosis. or how best to say it:\n\nthe ideas seemed extra-literary:\n\nthat is, good ideas\n\nwere better than bad\n\nThose things together and made the poem better\n\nconstituting change, development but the test of them as ideas was not literary.)\n\nor something more in the nature\n\nof contradictiondiscrepancies to be\n\nexplained, or shrugged away,\n\nconcerns or habits that like\n\na shirt have worked their way\n\nlow in the drawer and you say Oh,\n\nI dont wear that anymore\n\nits hard to say why.\n\nOr its obvious.\n\nThe process poem, for example, 1\n\nthat strikes me as such a seventies thing:\n\n This coffee shopI wont eat here again!\n\nThough in fact I will, despite the\n\nfluctuating price, the mathematical\n\ninadvertance that accompanies\n\nlunch each daythe sensitivity\n\nof the teenage girl who administers it\n\nprecluding objection.\n\nNot that she is aware of this.\n\nI have only ever used the conventions\n\nof that sort of poem, not been bound\n\nby them as rigor: a device\n\nfor changing the subject. Though subjects,\n\nlike ideas, were not the point exactly\n\nor were the point of the self that\n\nentertained them, were just the figure or\n\ntheme on the other hand\n\nof the one writing the poem\n\nand you were both these people, and you\n\nmight not have to decide between them\n\nunless the power of one called\n\nfor its being overruled and\n\neven then it may have been a matter\n\nof ceding ground, regrouping\n\nredefining the goal or conception,\n\nthe ambition or gestalt:\n\ntwo people\n\nendlessly moving the goalposts\n\nto gain advantage.\n\nOr an impossible coalition\n\nsay, the Labor Caucus.\n\n(Prospective Content\n\nand Vague Form, aligned\n\nprovisionally.\n\nThough conceptually\n\nthey are of different order:\n\nmore Incommensurable than Opposed\n\n incommensurable and opposed? \n\nand, really,\n\nfictive entities.)\n\nThe Labor Caucus.\n\n(Or something more cooperative.) In\n\nany case the tension between the two\n\nform and contentbeing productive,\n\nand the poem side brought off best with no\n\none pole too long dominant. Though this\n\nis to offer a generalization, not a memory.\n\nWhat poem do I remember this way? Well,\n\nA Terrible Attitude, Based on Mourning might 2\n\nbe a candidate is one,\n\nso perhaps there were others.\n\nHaving something that must be satisfied,\n\nthat might even drive the poembesides art\n\nwas necessary. An impulse or orientation\n\nI think of as Protestant or Puritanthough\n\nwhat thing Catholicif that is its opposite\n\nis it distinguished from, the Baroque?\n\n(Why did I say I wouldnt eat here, any more\n\nand then admit I would?\n\nThe effect is to change the subject\n\nbut, more interestinglysince or if or\n\nto the degree that subjects\n\nare not the pointa level of sincerity\n\nis introduced, or introduced\n\ncritically:\n\nan earnest of it\n\na markerintroduced\n\nas, simultaneously,\n\nit is undermined\n\na promise\n\nof unreliability\n\nand a foregrounding of artifice\n\nor, more correctly, of the form\n\nof some sort of\n\nbond with the reader. I hope it did all that\n\nbecause as illustration of\n\na worn out formthe shirt\n\nnever to be worn again\n\nit backfires: there I am\n\nusing it/wearing it.\n\nThe failure\n\nset up here, maybe 'demonstrates'\n\ncontinuity?\n\nOr is this a moved\n\ngoal-post?\n\nIn some ways good if it is.\n\nThe Baroque I have some tolerance for\n\nand it would mean in this context\n\nthe excessively, or entertainingly conventional\n\nand artificial. Certain kinds of\n\npostmodernism favor it. I like it\n\nwhere it is comedic\n\nbut find it tiresome otherwise, time-\n\nwasting, fake, not credible. I guess\n\nthe rigor of some higher aim\n\n(by the logic of the binaries\n\nI seem to think in, shuffle between)\n\nthat eschews the Baroque and the\n\nconventionsI associate\n\nwith Modernism (which seems to me\n\nProtestant, puritan, functional\n\nwhere ornament is crime 3\n\nAdolf Loos, where function is ethical\n\nReyner Banham, where form 4\n\nfollows function (though I cant think\n\nwho said thatGropius, Mies\n\nvan der Rohe? Or was it Olson?). 5\n\nBeing virtuous, chaste even,\n\nI associate with Creeley\n\nand dont like it, much, in him\n\nthough where he has a virtue\n\nthat is it, often. Though I dont\n\nwish, often, to concede it. Well,\n\nthere was The Purity Of Diction\n\nIn English Verse, 7\n\nwhich I liked too\n\nwithout liking, much,\n\nthe contemporary poems\n\nit spoke to. Or liking them\n\nbut not feeling them contemporary.\n\nI mean Davie and Larkin. 'Chastity' in verse\n\nwas a concept I might have first\n\nmet here. I had\n\nbetter ideasI thoughtenthusiasms\n\nthan being virtuous:\n\nthe more positively exhilarating pleasures\n\nof Thought-that-moved-swiftly and was not poetic\n\nthat was amusing, that had the formal excitement\n\nof collage, its disjunctions: Ted Berrigan, OHara.\n\nWhere I liked, or employed, conventions\n\nI wanted them laid bare.\n\n#\n\nThere seems so much to say\n\nabout the early poems. I cared\n\nabout them at the time. But what\n\nthey didnt do\n\nmeant so much more\n\nthan what they did: a series\n\nor simple instances of\n\nexemplary avoidances\n\nof what I considered then\n\nto be error\n\nand which added up\n\nto a style of subtractions. I guess\n\ncool is always a matter of less\n\nis more. Maybe I thought the poems\n\nexciting in their severity? The audience\n\nwhippedand a little shocked\n\nbut liking it, or lapping it up?\n\nMaybe I didnt think this\n\nas I read mostly to friends, the\n\nlike-minded or moderately rivalrous peers\n\nof similar or different persuasion.\n\n#\n\nLearn To Stutter  Scenes\n\nFrom Damaged Life!\n\nIs that the true title\n\nof this apologia?!\n\nA traditional path\n\nto aesthetic\n\nseriousness\n\nhas been\n\n\"the pursuit\n\nof the direct and the difficult\" 59\n\n(Lucy Lippard). As\n\nwriter and art critic\n\nGary Catalano once said\n\nof artist Ken Whisson\n\n(that) (he) \"resists\n\nall facility\".\n\n\"Risible?

(The Spade character 63\n\nIn the case of Poetry \"utters these lines\" in\n\nthe answer is, maybe, The Maltese Falcon.)\n\nYes. One of the kinds\n\nof resistance\n\nI want to posit\n\nhave I posited it already\n\nif not, maybe, discuss\n\nis the resistance\n\nto a too easy rhetoric,\n\nat least when spoken\n\nfrom a subject-position\n\nthat can be construed\n\nas the poet's.\n\nBut I\n\nwill discuss it!

They have\n\nthe same job description:\n\n'Intellectual-\n\nWithout-Portfolio'.\n\n(\"(D)efeat\"that is, as in Harold Bloom,\n\nThe Anxiety Of Influence.) 66\n\nAnd maybe we don't\n\nhave to defeat it.\n\nBack to the poems!\n\nTime for a coffee?\n\nYoikstime for work!\n\n#\n\nSo\n\nNotes For Poems (early 80s)\n\nwas a deliberate choice\n\nof a more flowery diction\n\nand an alternately hysterical and\n\nrhapsodic discursive manner.\n\nCapital 'P' poetry. Chosen\n\nas a way out of the dead-end\n\nthat degree zero and the process poem 67\n\nhadtemporarily? permanently?\n\nnecessarily?brought me to.\n\nUS poet Tony Towle\n\nwas probably the main influence,\n\nthough the poem bears little resemblance\n\nto his productions. (Actually\n\nNotes For Poems took off\n\nfrom the opening paragraph of\n\nsome old-fashioned Guide\n\nTo Classical Music I had found.\n\nI think it had the phrase\n\n\"species of fine frenzy\n\ndescend from the sky\"and I was away.)\n\nThe signs of Towle's presence 68\n\nare apparent to me though\n\nin the deliberate artificiality,\n\nthe persona (to a degree),\n\nthe linked, extended, 'classical' similes, metaphors,\n\nand rhetorical patterns or schema,\n\nthe great show of their 'deployment'.\n\nAt various times I wrote poems as letters\n\n(instead of letters even\n\nin most cases) and the first published of them\n\nI think were three from France and Italy\n\n(appearing in Untimely Meditations).\n\nThese allow an intimacy of address and tone\n\nand make plausible a greater freedom of association.\n\nI suppose they also involve\n\na degree of self-representation and\n\nrepresentation of the addressee (their\n\nexpectations, background, opinions). A kind of\n\nnegotiated relationship.\n\nTheir attraction for me\n\nas letters or surrogates for letters\n\nwas that they gave me\n\naccess I normally don't have\n\nwhen writing letters\n\nto areas of free association.\n\nOne should have access\n\nto this in letter writing\n\nbut I don't normally seem to.\n\nAlmost none of these poems\n\ndid I conceive of\n\nin the terms I have used. I conceived of them\n\npretty much wordlessly and intuitively.\n\nInvolving a recognition\n\nperhaps readied by these kinds of thinking.\n\nBut its not really all that difficult a notion. Is it?\n\n#\n\n(As to the letter poems' making plausible\n\n\"greater freedom of association\")\n\n\"Make more plausible\"? I mean\n\nthat they are\n\nconventionally more plausible\n\nor expectedbecause they are poetry\n\nand have less of the utilitarian tone\n\nof contemporary, debased, truncated, not-very-well-mannered\n\ncommunications. The poems\n\nsignal that they are Poetry\n\nby convention\n\nand that their humor\n\nconsists partly of the ill fit\n\nof their notions (the notions they express\n\nthereby) with 'Poetry'.\n\n(Not that these poems set up to demolish\n\nthat idea of Poetryconsidering it demolished already\n\nbut invoke it to bounce off,\n\nan orientating straw man,\n\nthe only fixture standing in the wide, open field\n\nmodernism has laid waste.)\n\n& I should have said (?)\n\nbounce off of.)\n\nWhat sort of ill-fit? The usual: the everyday, but also\n\nthe more abrasive and, if not shocking, impolite:\n\nwatching a big Frenchman's little dog\n\ncower under his chair, small, leonine and cowardly;\n\nwatching cars park; remarks on the disappeared\n\nmosques of the Jewish Quarter; jokes about Australian\n\nWar artists; anti-clerical sentiments;\n\nquick artistic judgements on the French Baroque's\n\ntaste in Italian art; a drawing of the Siena square\n\ndone as if lying drunk in the middle of it. And so on.\n\nThese things fill out the 'letter poems'.\n\n#\n\nOn this tour of the various formal gambits,\n\nor moves, I've made\"formal/attitudinal\"\n\nmight have been the more\n\ncircumspect phrasing there\n\ntheir motivations, their characteristics,\n\nI'm left with a small bunch of poems\n\nwith traditional form: some sestinas\n\nand a moderately long poem called\n\nTraffic Noises, Cups, Voices.\n\nAnd with the fact that I've written\n\na lot of poems in unrhymed couplets and triplets\n\nsince the mid 80s I think. I think the latter\n\nwere an attempt\n\nat a less obtrusively (\"ostensively\" used to be\n\nDonald Brook's great phraseas in\n\n\"look there\", \"it's obvious\")um,\n\nless obtrusively apparent Subjectivity\n\nthrough a greater regularity of look,\n\nbut also (as it transpired, but not\n\nof necessity) greater regularity of toneand argument.\n\nNot really a category, these, as the manner\n\nis adopted in works already categorized: Dazed for example.\n\nThe sestinas were written mostly\n\nin the 80s when I finally realized\n\nthat some poems I liked had that form\n\nand that it explained part of their mystery\n\nand appeal. (Ashbery's Faust 71\n\nbeing one. It recalls mostly the Claude Raines Tennis Court Oath 47\n\nPhantom Of The Opera movie of the 40s.)\n\nI used them in the spirit\n\nof the Ou Li Po (of whom 72\n\nI knew nothing at the time)\n\nas productively restrictive form.\n\nThe sestina formula\n\nwas a machine you strapped to your brain\n\nand the product was something\n\nyou could not have produced\n\notherwise. Bunny Melody\n\nis one I think is successful. My first, Funny Ideas, Sestina Centre Brain 1\n\nI began by choosing the amusingly nutty blurb\n\nfrom The Fontana Dictionary Of\n\nModern Knowledge and making it\n\nthe middle stanza of the six\n\nand plotting the determining end-words\n\nfor the other stanzas\n\nfrom that mid-pointand 'writing'.\n\nLimited returns set in, I've found,\n\nafter a time\n\nand I don't revisit the form very often.\n\nThe other poem Traffic Noises \n\nbut that is to jump ahead, to poems that are 'current'\n\nthe destination in a way\n\nof this whole exercise. We must be nearly there.\n\nWord Count could tell me\n\nexactly how far away it is.\n\nExciting? And just\n\nas I've got the hang of this\n\ngot it, lost it a few times,\n\nbut basically\n\nSo, later.\n\nFinally,\n\nI've done more in the collage line, too.\n\nNot so muchand this time not because\n\nDiminishing Returns threatened,\n\nbut because I feared\n\nthat the more purely 'aesthetic' determination\n\naestheticist even\n\nwould come to govern,\n\nthat I would have to think of myself\n\nproducing 'confections',\n\nthe verbal equivalent\n\nof the Lyrical Abstraction paintings that,\n\nthough I could like them, seemed to trade\n\non the look of daring abstraction\n\n(daring accident, risk and etcetera), and which\n\ncontrolled that look pretty perfectly,\n\norchestrated their colors, their\n\nrandomness, their accident\n\ntoo conveniently, whose daring was in fact\n\nalready and long ago acceptable.\n\nSo, to avoid this embarrassment.\n\nAs well I had mostly turned this process\n\nupon a quite large mass of well digested\n\nand abandoned material, usually a good while\n\nabandoned. I was producing less of this\n\n(fewer fragments of unfinished poems)\n\nwas less of a bower bird of others' fragments\n\nor of 'fragments' of my own. The discursive and flat manner\n\nI had been maintaining\n\ndid not generate these nuggets. So,\n\nfew examples: Blazing Shoes,\n\nAugust 6th. The latter, because it is later,\n\nshows the effects I have been describing.\n\nIt is made up\n\nmuch less of small verbal, linguistic\n\nunits. It is itself (consequently?) larger\n\nand cloudierwhole discursive chains are set up\n\nand run for a page, or pages.\n\nI like the poem very much\n\nbut it is commodious, capacious\n\nand stands at different sorts of angle to\n\ndifferent sorts of distance from\n\nits material. It is their voice\n\nmore often: more often close\n\nto first person Subject-position\n\nthough it is more openly and more quizzically\n\nironic about the voices it mimics, voices it quotes and 'affects'.\n\nBut voice and subject\n\nare a more determining principle\n\nwith it than with Terrific Days\n\nwhich could be regarded\n\nas having no Subject position. So,\n\na difference.\n\nThere are a few shorter poems\n\ndone this way: Italian Drink,\n\nLife Your Weightand a number of poems\n\nthat begin with the method or incorporate it\n\nat some stage (Double Trouble, How I'm Feeling)\n\nand maybe it is almost a habit of thought\n\nor attention I now bring to writing. This, though,\n\nwould be less 'collage'\n\nthan free association. (\"Free\", what a nutty idea.)\n\n#\n\n(I think we're there.)\n\n#\n\nWell here I am,\n\nin The Flash Café, having\n\nshocked the woman behind the counter\n\nby ordering tea:\n\nshe likes to guess, long black?\n\nlatté? But my throat is sore\n\ncoffee would hurt.\n\nI'm about to embark now\n\non the exegesis\n\nof the new poems\n\nthat have been collecting under the title\n\nAt The Flash & At The Baci\n\npoems written here, written\n\nor revised here. Or at the Baci\n\ndown the street. A few weren't.\n\nOr, if they were, I associate them\n\nwith the desk at home: one of\n\nthe John Forbes poems\n\n(the second, Hi, John the title)\n\nlooks out that window\n\nat a plant outside\n\nand another was written\n\nlate at night\n\n(\"People Passing Time\")\n\nand depended on pictures I had\n\ntaped or blu-tacked to the wall.\n\nSimilarly the poem for Kurt:\n\n(\"Catching Up With Kurt Brereton\")\n\nI was doing a drawing or had\n\njust done. A few others\n\nthe 'Manet' oneI was with (A Picture is the title)\n\nAnna and Cath, another I was\n\nwatching television while Anna slept\n\nin front of it orno I wasn't\n\nI wrote it the next night\n\nwhile alonewatching Mouchette.\n\n(The poem is Amaze Your Friends\n\nMouchette is a 60s French film.) 73\n\nBecause I'm writing this here\n\nat The Flash in a poem with\n\nthe waitress in itlooking at\n\npoems I wrote here toowill she\n\nbe able to see themby some\n\nweird sort of Being John Malkovich logic? 74\n\nIf she could\n\nshe would like her appearances\n\nI hopethough I can imagine\n\nWhadya mean 'Gothic'? 75\n\nAnd who's this stylish bitch\n\nyou work with that knows so much?\n\nWould she like the poemsum\n\non 'purely aesthetic grounds'?\n\nNo one else doesha ha ha.\n\nThe best poems in the book\n\nare not necessarily the ones to talk about\n\nI guess, though it might turn out\n\nthey get covered. The newest poems\n\nat the back\n\nare to do with Italy, in part,\n\nwhere I was last year (in the first half of 2000)\n\nand the coffee shops\n\nFlash and Baci\n\nare Italianthe poems\n\nconsider frameworks, locales\n\nperspectives\n\nfrom which experiences can be seen\n\nor my thinking can.\n\nNervously relative. In fact my\n\ntrip to Italy to another perspective\n\nwas the seemingly longed-for,\n\nor wondered-at, coming true\n\ndisconcertingly, as\n\nmight be expected.\n\nAnyway, I am not\n\na markedly 'centered' poet\n\nthough I live with that\n\nhappily enough: tethered\n\nherebut lightly, barely.\n\nThe constants might be friends,\n\nrelationshipsand a mix of\n\nculture, in which I'm at home,\n\n(though it's partial, not 'adequate',\n\nin various waysbut then I'd\n\n'have all the answers' if it were,\n\nwhich would be boring\n\nor boring because 'not me'. Who knows?)\n\n(Who knows? a recurrent phrase,\n\nsomebody once said,\n\nin my poems.)\n\nI seem\n\nTo have talked myself\n\ninto a curious mood. Maybe\n\nI should write a real poem\n\ninstead of 'this' then? (A\n\njoke I like, which I've made\n\na number of times\n\nnot being sure what its import is\n\nor caring to decide.)\n\nThe whole relativism 'thing'\n\nI would like to bracket out\n\nlike my ideasas non literary.\n\nIt's not a conscious theme, or\n\nand this is literary, I guess\n\nis boring for its repetition\n\nand embarrassing: like\n\nsome other themesWho wants\n\nto seem this sook though one is\n\nwho always needs his friends? and does\n\nSimilarly poems looking out\n\na window, or up late at night\n\nthinking. 'Thinking'?\n\n\"Thinkingbut never making up\n\nhis mind!\"\n\nNot\n\nthat I mind repetition\n\nin the poets I admire.\n\n(But I'm not one of them.)\n\nSo what's in this putative book then\n\napart from the issues above\n\nwhich indicate 'more of the same'\n\nanything good?\n\nThe first poem in the book,\n\nHome Town, is okay.\n\nIt could be characterized\n\nas an 'I-do-this, I-do-that' poem\n\nJames Schuyler-style.\n\nI do this I do that\n\nis associated with particular\n\nO'Hara poems. If it's James\n\nSchuylery it is in being,\n\ninitially, a narrow column\n\nand in being less jumpy\n\nin the ordering and kind\n\nof events and ideas, than F. O'H.\n\nNot that this is 'true' exactly\n\nor that I thought about it\n\nthat way then. But as shorthand.\n\nThe poem breaks up into\n\nstaggered lines after a while\n\nas concepts and moods\n\nbegin to dictate its pace\n\nrather than the more ('telegraphic'?)\n\nactions and events. It begins\n\nDriving into work while\n\nCath reads about driving around London\n\n& wondering when will I next write a poem\n\nor whether to just work on Gwendolyn\n\na poem of John's & mine & maybe I should\n\nit is half mine, I drop Cath off, do a\n\nU-turn & scoot down to the EAF, park, go inside\n\ncheck the mail empty my bag a little\n\nlock up again & set off for the coffee shop\n\nwhere I'll read or write a poem or a\n\nreviewor work on Gwendolyn, I suppose, is\n\na possibility . . .\n\nand later goes on\n\nto become a series of thoughts\n\nabout my 'place' in the world\n\nhow it feels etc and the insubstantiality\n\nevanescence\n\nof the terms\n\nin which I think these things.\n\nThe poem affects a wistfulness\n\nthat it mocksthough to which\n\nit resigns itself finally (if\n\n'formally' only) at the end\n\nin ruefully examining the lines\n\non O'Hara John Forbes communicated\n\nto me: about timing, grace.\n\n\"Frank O'Hara never went skating\n\nbut he liked to dance,\" Forbes tells me\n\nin Thin Ice, finding O'Hara\n\nan acceptable link between us. 76\n\nTwo other poems early in the MS\n\nwould seem comparableWalk\n\nOn The Wild Side and poem (walking\n\ndown from the Star Grocery).\n\nBoth feature walking, obviously,\n\nas does much of Home Town\n\nbut actually Wild Side contemplates\n\nfuture daily events\n\n\"Tomorrow:\n\nshop, bank, wash hair\" \n\nand, still more banal, \"put prices\n\non books arrived at the EAF\"\n\n(my job) \"have coffee\".\n\n\"An eventful day?\" the poem asks.\n\nThe poem then goes on\n\nto calibrate loyalties\n\nto various 'heroes'\n\nLittle Walter, Lou Reed\n\nJames Schuylerthen ponders\n\nfurther nebulous things\n\npleased to be making no\n\nfirm decisions. It is\n\na far more measured poem\n\nthan Home Town, biting off\n\nalmost less than it can chew.\n\nHome Town takes a number\n\nof big bites. The\n\n'Star Grocery' poem\n\nhas some of the same\n\nmeasured quality and is\n\nin relatively grave\n\nthree-line stanzas.\n\nBut it is midway between,\n\nor somewhere betweenor\n\na provisional plural\n\n\"somewhere(s) between\"?\n\nIs it a literary convention,\n\nor realism, that academic jokes are dull?\n\nbetween\n\nthe contentedeness of Wild Side\n\n(the contrast with its title\n\nis its joke) and the anxiety\n\nof Home Town. Star Grocery (Walking Down from the Star\n\nruns unfavorable or slightly down Grocery is its full title.)\n\nand crestfallen comparisons\n\nof oneself (me, not you)\n\nwith the major players of\n\ncosmopolitan centres\n\nand sort of decides to take them\n\non the chin which it 'bravely'\n\nholds up in its\n\nlast linescontemplating\n\ntotal annihilation. In fact. (!)\n\nA bit histrionic. (Just 'Death'.)\n\nOther poems in the book\n\ntreat 'the street'\n\nthis same street, Hindley Street.\n\nMostly Hindley Street does so\n\nbut more in the framework\n\nof the process poem: cursorily\n\ndiaristic, sketching shops and sites\n\nand characters of the street\n\nand thoughts produced that way.\n\nIt happens upon\n\na kind of thesis or question\n\nIs my 'compass' any broader than\n\nThomas Gray'swhom I rather thoughtlessly\n\nderide. Halogen Pam is a more circumspect\n\naccount of my life in urban Adelaide\n\ncontrasting it with those of friends\n\ncontrasting their imagined attitudes, too,\n\nto mine. It is in three-line stanzas\n\nand does a fair bit of thinking. Is its tone\n\ntoo heavy? Unrelieved? Later poems,\n\nlike Hindley Street (with\n\na prospect of Michael Grimm) and\n\nAmaze Your Friends, seem not similar.\n\nTheir mood is less self-critical.\n\nAmaze Your Friends, anyway, is not\n\nabout the street but was simply written\n\nabout the same time. Prospect begins\n\nin emulation of some lines and the feel\n\nof Ted Berrigan, his poems like\n\nAnn Arbor Elegy or (particularly) Peace. 77\n\nBut readers won't notice. And it\n\ndoesn't matterit got me started\n\nand its or similarrepetitions\n\nare what Prospect seeks for, overreach\n\nbeing its intent though hoping to 'save'\n\nor 'recoup' it.\n\nInteresting, I hope, is a satirical poem\n\nGiles Auty Furioso which\n\nstarts sort of scrappily\n\nlike a comedian at half pace,\n\n(maybe rehearsing a show,\n\nit occurs to me now)then clicks\n\ninto gear: the supposed\n\nvoice of mad Giles Auty\n\nbemoaning the state\n\nof Australian Art Today, of\n\nart today generally. It's\n\nfunny, if it is funny,\n\nbecause of the extremity\n\nof its viewsbut also\n\nbecause of their similarity to his.\n\nIn my view, at any rate.\n\nThe notes to the poem\n\nare amusing in something like\n\nthe same way, if maybe\n\nmore slyly.\n\nA poem called A Picture but which\n\nI think of usually as\n\nThe 'Manet' poem is I suppose\n\n'ekphrasis' which, if\n\nthis weren't a process poem\n\nand I was going to revise even a line,\n\nis a word I'd drop (usually\n\nI cannot remember itit\n\nseems to mask the ordinariness\n\nof an ordinary enough\n\nconcept). Describing a picture.\n\nThis poem describes a painting\n\nby Manet that, it becomes apparent\n\nquickly enough, is imaginary.\n\nMy partner Cath, her daughter Anna\n\nand I are in it, sitting in bed\n\nreadingthey are, and I am\n\nor I might almost be\n\nbut I'm writing the poem in question.\n\nI describe our respective books\n\nand the appearance of mother and\n\ndaughter. Cath's description is mediated\n\nthrough characterizations of\n\nMonet and Berthe Morisot\n\nand a bit of pondering\n\non Manet's likely attitude\n\nto detailthat is, is the anachronistic\n\nwrist-watch I'm wearing\n\nlikely to show up in the painting\n\nrecognisably? We all look up\n\nfor the last line of the poem\n\nand say 'Hi'a reason why\n\nfor a long while I used to toy\n\nwith the idea of calling it\n\nPolaroid. The poem is moderately\n\ncolumnar, ranged from\n\nthe left margin in one version\n\nin another in longer-lined couplets.\n\nThis last gives more control\n\nbut slows the overall poem.\n\nA nice poembut with\n\nvery much the air of a set piece.\n\nA nice poem I don't care about.\n\nFar more interestingbut\n\ndoes it work?the poem\n\nDouble Portrait. Not conceived\n\nas 'ekphrasis'. It's a kind of\n\ndoubled sestina, linking a second\n\nto the firstat the 'copula'\n\nto call it that, of\n\nthe first envoi or\n\nfinal three lines (that is,\n\nthe envoi that would end\n\nbe the final three lines of\n\nan ordinary sestina). (Thats where\n\nI make the join.) It's\n\nthe product of fabulous New York:\n\nthe sight of a New York artistportraitist\n\nmainlyone whom I've never liked\n\n(Chuck Close: he was\n\nsometimes included\n\nunder the rubric 'Pop Art' and also\n\nas a New Photographic Realist,\n\nthough their subject matter (not his)\n\nwas usually pick-up trucks and\n\nchrome-and-glass Americana.\n\nThese latter artists\n\nhave now mostly been forgotten.\n\nClose's paintings are enormous.\n\nHe has lately been\n\nconfined to a wheelchair\n\nand with very little motor control\n\nof his muscles\n\nyet has devised a way to continue.)\n\n\" one whom I've never liked\"\n\nor thought much of. He is contrasted\n\nin all his art-world success (a\n\nsecond-stringer's degree of it)\n\nwith the comparative and undeserved obscurity\n\nof poet Tony Towlewhose\n\nwork I like. I discuss\n\na Chuck Close self-portrait\n\nand a series\n\nof photographic portraits\n\nof Towle. My ambivalence\n\nabout Closewho has\n\nrisen above adversity\n\nin recent yearsand about\n\nmy opinion of him, and of\n\nother artists, is discussed.\n\nIt's all complicated enough\n\nand I like it as a kind of\n\nruminative thinking that\n\nmight belong in an essay\n\nin some people's view but\n\nis less usual and stronger too\n\nin a poem. The form\n\nmight be the fault in the poem, or\n\ncause of its faults, but\n\nit also gives the ideas' expression\n\nsome strength. It was absorbing fun\n\nto write a seriousseriously toned i.e., the other sestinas were comic:\n\npoem in the sestina form. there is one of these in\n\nWhich the book tooProspect\n\nlinks it, though at some months' remove, of the Young KB\n\nwith Traffic Noises, Cups, Voices. As A Critic\n\nThis poem, too, and unusually for me,\n\ntakes a 'tight' formthe\n\nstanza pattern of FT Prince's poem\n\nMemoirs in Oxford. These few 78\n\nmonths' removal is not much,\n\nDouble Portrait being examined\n\ntwo or three times a week most weeks\n\nfor the next three or four months, given a rest\n\nand subjected to it all again\n\nminor revisions being made\n\nor visited upon it, the poem\n\ngradually obscured, cleared\n\nand obscured again but fixed\n\nI think finally: over\n\nlonger and longer periods left\n\nin the dark (to be read\n\nfreshly). I decided\n\nit was complete\n\nabout the time I finished\n\nTraffic Noises.\n\nIt is a more serious or\n\nheavier-toned poem than Traffic.\n\nAnd interesting, more interesting\n\nif in fact it retains the reader's\n\nattention: it is less comfortable\n\nwith its own thoughtstheir status\n\nas reasonable opinion, mere opinion\n\ncapricious opinion, unjust even.\n\nAs well, I like Double Portrait\n\nfor the manner\n\nof its thinking about artwhich is\n\nusually done with an eye to History.\n\nIn fact poems usually discuss work whose\n\nstatus is, or seems, decided.\n\nPortrait discusses mere taste and\n\nfallible judgementand errors giving\n\nsome works a special longevity\n\nfor me.\n\n(That is, a kind of 'critic's guilt'\n\nat having got the work wrong:\n\nthere are subsequently\n\nworks I remember especially\n\nand disproportionately\n\nhaving originally underestimated them.)\n\nTraffic Noises is much\n\nlighter in tone. It anticipates\n\na trip to Rome, bemused\n\nto run through its file of information:\n\nknowledge of Rome generally, of\n\nthe studio in which I would be staying\n\netcthe point / points being\n\ncontrasts of notional Italy\n\nand the 'Italian' coffee shop in\n\nwhich I writeand Adelaide.\n\nThe poem is 'a bit civilized'\n\nin my judgement'polite'\n\nin a way I find diminishes any\n\nurgency or immediacy into an\n\nentertainment.\n\nBut still,\n\nsomething to have done.\n\nMaybe\n\neach poem is calisthenics, training\n\nfor the next, or 'a' next. The same moves\n\nget made in more pressing contexts\n\nor avoided, topped. Modified\n\nas they approach again. Like\n\nphilosophy, I think. (Would like\n\nto think.) Or do I mean\n\nthinking rather than philosophy?\n\nThe three poems for John Forbes\n\nare a response to his death\n\nand explain themselves that way:\n\nin summary, they recount\n\nthe following: that John\n\nwas a kind of point-of-reference\n\na constant in my thinking\n\nintermittently invoked for\n\npurposes of comparison (my writing,\n\nmy life, attitudes\n\ncompared to his) and as\n\na kind of bench-mark\n\nI could apply. He had\n\nstayed with us shortly before\n\nhis deathnot in good health\n\nbut maybe prepared\n\nto 'look after' himself. In\n\nthe second poem I reprise\n\nmuch of this.\n\nBoth poems begin with,\n\nand mix in, everyday occurrences\n\nand return to John. The third\n\nis less anchored to the everyday\n\npartly it is that it is written at night\n\nin a 'study'work roomso that\n\nintrusions are less random, more\n\nchosen, and partake more of the subjective\n\nmaybe it is somatic, too (the\n\nbody late at night): the poem\n\nas it turns out is a bit more\n\n'about' death as well as being\n\nwell, mostlyabout John.\n\nIt looks at three images\n\non my walls as I wrote\n\na large A3 photocopy photograph\n\nof Muddy Waters playing cards 79\n\nbetween sets, a photo\n\n(photocopy again) of New York migrant kids,\n\ngirls mostly (or all)\n\nby Weegee from the 40s,\n\nand a photocopy reproduction\n\nof a Philip Guston painting\n\nSmoking I.\n\nThis last I have had on my walls\n\nfor yearsa photocopy actually\n\nof the picture torn from a page\n\nof newspaper so it consists\n\nof the rectangular image, the titling\n\nunderneath and a triangular fragment\n\nof newspaper type still further below.\n\nI like it as black and white graphic\n\nmore than as colored painting, I think.\n\nI can kick on with it all night\n\nto any accompanimentVelvet Underground,\n\njazz, anything. It is 'about'\n\nstaying up late. Though for Guston\n\nI know thisit is\n\nalso about insomnia, its\n\nworries and bad conscience and hopelessness.\n\nThis is the reason it reminds me\n\nof John. As the poem/s say or said\n\nwe had John resting down the back\n\nexactly like that, a waking, un-\n\nblinking head contemplating\n\nthe warnings he had received\n\nabout his health. Plainly\n\nI didn't know what was going on.\n\nMaybe he did. (Maybe not.)\n\nHe was frightened, surely,\n\nto a degree.\n\nAnyway,\n\nthe poem considers the images:\n\nthe young girls, shown together\n\nwatching a movie, a crowded\n\nafternoon matinee session with\n\nother kidsall now, probably, aged\n\nor dead; Muddy (in\n\nthe pic John had liked and\n\nwrote about a few years before\n\nwhen he'd stayed another time and seen it on my wall)\n\ndead too; Philip Guston, dead.\n\nAnd maybe I was listening to Joe Turner\n\n(deaddo I say that, in the poem?)\n\nor was it just the repetitions\n\nreminded me of him (On My Way\n\nTo DenverIt's too late\n\ntoo late, too late, too late:\n\nToo late, too late too late, too late.\n\nSays the woman, whose speech Joe reports in the song:\n\nshe's on my way to Denvertomorrow\n\nIt will be too late.\n\nShe is dying of TB.\n\nAnyway, for an overdetermined number of\n\nreasons, given my aurally spurred\n\nmemory, I mention Joe Turner.\n\nThe poem says John's dead\n\nand I'm alive, and doesn't know\n\nwhat to say or 'know' further.\n\nSome elementsmy doing a drawing,\n\nfriend Micky Allan, just things\n\n'on my desk' (pencils, jars, the\n\ncurtain closing out the window I face)\n\nare allowed in, partly because\n\nthe curve of the poem is so powerful\n\nit will bend anything to its purpose,\n\nthe concentration on its theme.\n\nTechnicallythough as O'Hara says,\n\n\"you just go on your nerve\", 80\n\n(that caveat)I guess the poems\n\ndo the 'I do this / I do that'\n\nthing, but also allow themselves\n\nor the third poem does\n\nthe freedom of the collage style\n\n(not collage, but similar randomness).\n\nAnd I think they shift gears\n\noften enough in terms of\n\ndifferent registers of cultural reference,\n\ntones and dictions. Not that,\n\nin this circumstance, this was planned.\n\nTraining, you see. Habit.\n\nIs this the place to say:\n\nJohn was notin terms\n\nof style or technique\n\nan influence for me:\n\ntoo different temperamentally,\n\ntoo big in the front brain department,\n\nmore interested in compression\n\nthan I am.\n\nBut he represented a position\n\nI spoke to occasionally,\n\naddressed explicitly, or\n\nundisclosedly on occasion,\n\nand he represented a finger-wagging\n\ncritical presencein my imagination\n\nthough amusing, a kind of\n\ncomic 'ravishing super-ego'.\n\nAlso influences, in\n\nvariations of the same way,\n\nwere Pam Brown and Laurie Duggan. 81\n\nLess comically different\n\nfrom me, but different enough.\n\nJohn's early death\n\nhas made him more central\n\nto my poems recently. I don't know\n\nwhether permanently or as\n\na blip. A spike? John was\n\na friendly acquaintance.\n\nLaurie & Pam are friends.\n\nTheir styles areif not\n\nmore within my reach, then\n\ntempting because temperamentally\n\ncompatible or near to me.\n\nLevels of irony (kinds even)\n\n& pointed, drier intelligence(s)\n\nseparate us: but they are\n\ninfluencesits a gulf I try to\n\nbridge or cross often enough.\n\nBe like Pam!\n\nBe like Laurie!\n\nThe Italian poemsTraffic Noises\n\nwas one in anticipation,\n\nand we've dealt with it (on other grounds\n\nnot as anticipation, but\n\nbecause it was in a somehow\n\n'fixed' form, a\n\nstanza pattern)what to say of them?\n\nThere were three basically: Rumori,\n\nLong Distance Information,\n\nand Tiepolo. Tiepolo is\n\nvery much, and inevitably, in the shadow\n\nof John Forbes's On Tiepolo's\n\nBanquet of Antony & Cleopatra\n\nwhich is a better poem\n\nthough about a painting I\n\ndon't much like. I've liked\n\nTiepolo foreverbought prints\n\nof his drawings from Rowe Street\n\nArt Shop when I was\n\nfirst a student (finding out\n\nyears later that it had once been\n\nimportantly a connection with Europe\n\nfor Sydney artists. By the time\n\nI happened upon it it was genteel\n\nand faded). I've always preferred\n\nTiepolo's brushier, less formal compositions.\n\nI describe one I saw in Venice,\n\nbeginning with a potted history\n\nIn the 14, 15th &\n\n16th centuries it was\n\nall happening in Italy\n\nartistically though by the 17th\n\nother countries had joined in.\n\nBy the 18th\n\nItaly was definitely off the pace.\n\nStill, I happen to think Tiepolo\n\nwas a major artist\n\nand an account of Tiepolo's isolation\n\nwithin the Fine Arts course\n\nat Sydney Unitoo important (that is,\n\nnot to be included, not central enough Tiepolo wouldnt feature\n\nto fool the students. Forbes's influence in the exam)\n\nI think is in the comparison of\n\nthe begging saint-figure\n\nwith a lonely guy at a disco\n\na comparison John might have made\n\nand would have liked, might even\n\nhave identified with.\n\nThe poem is something of a 'set piece'\n\nlike the Manet poemand\n\nfor that reason I dislike it.\n\nMaybe poems about pictures\n\nare not my thingor not\n\nwhere 'Art History' has\n\nalready entered its verdict.\n\nRumori\n\nis a long poem about daily life in Rome\n\nand my preoccupations there\n\nwith 'Australian artistic identity':\n\nAustralians' looking to the Larger World\n\nthough there are only powerful centres\n\nthat seem to constitute itthis larger world:\n\nLondon, Rome. (New York.) The loss of nerve\n\nand failure of certain Australian art and careers\n\nSlessor, Crowleyand the pathos\n\nthat attacheswere difficult in the poem\n\nto verbalize, or prove. It felt true\n\nfelt true more than it seemed it\n\nand seemed and felt hysterical, projection.\n\nThis reduces the poem, I think,\n\nto reiteration and shrinking from\n\nconclusion. Rome's own independence\n\nfrom these pressures (at least\n\nas a context or working space) is made\n\nabsolve the feeling.\n\nBut not logically.\n\nIt might as easily be seen\n\nthat Rome (cf the Tiepolo poem's\n\npotted history) was no longer competitive.\n\nLike Sydneyor Slessor's Sydney.\n\nWell, there are good things in\n\nItbut propositionally the poem\n\nis weak and uncertain.\n\nWritten\n\nat the same time is a 'letter poem'\n\nto a friend in Adelaide, Long\n\nDistance Information. The phrase\n\nis from Chuck Berry and\n\nLong Distance Call, the Muddy Waters song,\n\nmight be hipper as a title (as\n\na reference, surely) but there\n\nyou go: it does purport\n\nto give informationto a friend\n\nback home. Some of it\n\nis fanciful and some of it is true\n\nand most of it is humorous. Good\n\nfun, but no morein terms\n\nof author satisfaction.\n\nNo fun\n\nwriting poems is it? I enjoyed it\n\nat the time and I don't hate the poem.\n\nBut it was not the big pay-off\n\nand never was going to be.\n\nSimilarly\n\nAmaze Your Friends, Hindley Street\n\nwith Michael Grimm and\n\nMy Considered Opinionall\n\nlikeable. Opinion deals notably\n\nthough was that its point?\n\nwith Asian students; Amaze\n\nwith sitting up at night, with rock clips, our\n\ndaughter Anna (have I mentioned this?)\n\nand Michael Grimm is another\n\nportrait of Hindley Street\n\nfrom The Flashall in stepped,\n\nscattered lines. I have\n\ntalked about this.\n\nSome poems that link with Rumori\n\nits themes of art-making and identity\n\nare Horizon, American Friends\n\nand Catching Up With Kurt Brereton. The last\n\nfits in perhaps because it was\n\nof that timeand it celebrates\n\na Sydney aestheticmostly pretending\n\nmy friends and I are having a reunion\n\naged 50but 50 years ago,\n\nin the Sydney of then.\n\nAmerican Friends wonders where\n\nmy writer friends are. (I'm on\n\nholiday as I write it myself.)\n\nThe poem expresses ambivalence\n\nas to the effect of O'Hara et al\n\non those so far away. (The movie,\n\nfrom a Ripley novel, is about\n\ninadvertent betrayal\n\nof a German by an American.) film title: The American Friend\n\nBut those so far away?\n\nIs this a class action Im proposing\n\nthough I seem, conspicuously, the only victim?\n\nUS Imperials\n\nNew York blend\n\nit said on the pack\n\nso I knew what I was doing.\n\nHorizon summarizes as similar\n\nbut is higher toned and more\n\npoetically obscure: it too begins with\n\nquotes from O'Hara\n\nchosen almost at random\n\nbut to fit my situation\n\nof looking out a country window.\n\nI do this and think of\n\nwhat my friends are doing\n\nit is Xmas time\n\nand wonder at the country / city divide,\n\nthe Australian landscape tradition,\n\nAustraliawhich, I would like, or\n\nhad wanted, to think of\n\nas modernin this post-modern\n\n'age' is 'post-colonial', is it (?):\n\nhow diminishing that is.\n\nThe poem\n\nconsiders Meaghan Morris's contrast (Morris, On The Beach, Too\n\nof Les Murray's Late Too Soon)\n\n\"ordinary man with an icecream\"\n\n(Les's, or Donald Horne's?) 82\n\nand John Forbes'\n\ndifferent take on things. I think\n\nthe poem addresses John again\n\nnear the end. The poem concludes\n\nbut is not conclusive.\n\nIt's good,\n\nI thinkand was different for me\n\nin its mannerof looking for a\n\nnew piece of text to push off from\n\nwhenever it stalled. I chose\n\nfragments from the less well-thumbed\n\nO'Hara poemsnot always signalling this\n\nwith quote marksand kicking off\n\nfrom them. Choosing O'Hara,\n\nwhile contemplating the Australian countryside,\n\nwas a deliberate or perverse ploy, a\n\nself-incrimination, since the poem\n\nis about cultural imperialism\n\nto some extent.\n\nThe poem affixes my\n\nusual declarative style\n\nto a structure jointed at\n\nor powered from (in part)\n\nimages, passages that are\n\nless 'transparent' than that style\n\nbut are poetically weighted or resonant.\n\nThese are the O'Hara lines\n\nquoted before the poem and, italicized,\n\nat its beginning\n\nand again some pages further in, more\n\n(italicized: \"not to be / inimitably\n\nweak & picturesque myself /\n\nbut standing forth a subject\n\nnot a spectacle\");\n\nlater, un-marked:\n\n\"as the brave must always ascend,\n\nalways the musts\" and\n\n\"which strolls now & then\n\ninto a field / & sits down like\n\na forgotten rock\".\n\nThe next O'Hara quote is signalled\n\n(by quote marks)\n\nand is from memory and\n\nmeant to be recognized: \"I live\n\nabove a / dyke bar & I'm happy\".\n\n\"I might too, for all I know. /\n\nAm I?\" the poem asks.\n\nI have\n\na more detailed and critical\n\nview of O'Hara than I did\n\nin the 70s. I didn't read him\n\na lot in the 80sand use him now\n\npartly as emblematicnot just\n\nout of enthusiasm. (\"Emblematic\":\n\n'my' Americaor\n\nan early, important\n\nenthusiasm.) I still 83\n\nlike his work immensely,\n\nbut see it more clearly. (Does this\n\nsound like 'knowledge'? Then\n\nI mean \"clear-eyed\".) (And it may be\n\nthat I see it\n\nno more accurately.)\n\nNot that\n\nI think the story of my poetry\n\nis of a relation to O'Hara's poetry\n\nis it?! Is Dick Watkins\n\nabout Picasso? Or Tuckson\n\nabout Pollock? Should they\n\nnot be? Anyway, if it were so\n\nthat it could be seen that way\n\nit would be news to me.\n\nA possibility of course.\n\nOr is it not news:\n\nexactly what I expect?\n\nThe smart thing for this book\n\nwould be a blurb that directs attention\n\nthis waysince it will be inevitable\n\nand seeks to control it. Something along the lines of\n\n\"re-examines the place of O'Hara and others\n\nin an Australian poetic.\"\n\nIf it does, still, that\n\nis not my point at all.\n\nThinking is, then?\n\nor poetry\n\n(form, art,\n\nthe aesthetic)?\n\nPoet considers a shirt he used to wear\n\nwhy did he do it? how could he? would\n\nhe do it again? Should this shirt be destroyed\n\nforeveris it a museum piece, tragic\n\nor empoweringhandy for someone else? Is this, in fact,\n\nthe same shirt?\n\nThe Op Shop of the poetic heart:\n\nWhat a lovely shirt.

Typically such poems refer to passing time, the place of the writing/thinking situation and its self-reflexivity. These poems tend to run to some length.\n\n2 The correct title ends Based On Suffering. (Ken Bolton, A Terrible Attitude, Based On Suffering. Selected Poems, 1975 - 1990.

London: Architect Press, 1966.\n\n5 Ludwig Mies Van Der Rohe (1886 - 1969) and Hans Gropius (1883 - 1969) were German Bauhaus architects, later working in the US. Mies said less is more and Gropius said form follows functionamong many other dicta.\n\n6 Charles Olson proposed most clearly in his essays on Projective verse a kind of kinetic/organic theory relating the poems form to interconnected impulses of thought, breath and emotion.

To become a member one has to invent a new form with strict rules. Some simple ones are Perecs novel without the letter e, La Disparation, Harry Mathews stories written using only the vocabulary of a particular, simple text. Restrictive form is held to be liberating and productive, hence the Ou Li Pos liking for the sestina and forms like it.

I do not think we have been much influence on each other's solo work: our ideas and interests are antithetical. The poems we write together come mostly out of our amusement at this: many of them are dialogic. Most of them neither of us would work up the volition to write alone.\n\nLaurie Duggan's poetry I find extraordinarily impressive. Under The Weather, which has in parts lost some of its charm for me, I was very impressed with at the time of its writing, for its form and its ellipses, its overall musicality, and for being a poem of that kind: where else was there one? (There were many, probably, stemming from Bunting, Pound and maybe Olson, in the US and the UK. I didn't see many though, and liked fewer.) I read Under The Weather as it was being written. Laurie's next books were very good (The Great Dividewith poems in it like The New England Odeand Adventures In Paradise which I published).\n\nBlue Notes was a miscellany, with very good things in it. The Ash Range was so much less personable and was different. It was not what I wanted to write though impressive and ambitious. I published Laurie's Memorialswhich I like immensely. If some of my more scattered, staggered, processual (!) poems approach this I would be very happy. Laurie's work pointed me to Philip Whalen'sif I needed another source and originating personality and temperament for writing like this.\n\nLaurie and Pam are both readers whom I imagine writing my work for. So their respective writings temper my work. Not that they are severe as people, but that what they see as bullshit counts.\n\nI wrote numerous letters to the addresses given in Pam Brown's early books. To no avail for yearsshe had always already moved on. Her work interested me from the mid 1970s onwards, at first intermittently. It was very different from my own. Since meeting in the late 70s our work has grown closerwhat a phraseand apart again, in various ways (formally). But we share a great many attitudes. I think her influences are less narrow than mine, but we want our poetry to do many of the same things. My work sometimes takes off from lines of hers, often takes off from the imagined attitude 'Pam Brown' would evince.\n\nJohn Tranter has been for me impressive without his work having any siren pull. I was fascinated by early versions of Rimbaud and the Pursuit of the Modernist Heresy, I remember, in the mid 1970s. I read him mostly in magazines then. His early books, Parallax and Red Movie, already seemed old compared to his current work.\n\nI suppose I should acknowledge that my influences are mostly male. But then they are also fairly fewamongst contemporary Australians they are three, of whom one, of course, is a woman. I lived with writers, Anna Couani and later Sal Brereton. Both are prose writers and I think for that reason less influential.\n\nThe US anthologies and movements we encountered as young writers were pretty exclusively male: One woman (Bernadette Mayer) in the NY School anthology, two or three in Donald Allen's effort (Helen Adam, Denise Levertov, Barbara Guest). Guest seems alternately inert and diaphanous-and-wafty to me. Her critical rehabilitation is being organized but I am not a subscriber. Bernadette Mayer I've read a fair bit of and liked. Anne Waldman; I liked only her first book, Giant Night. Adrienne Rich's later, 1980s work I read in the mid and late 80s and liked, but aside from its seriousness, its 'techniques' were those I already used. (I had read her Diving Into The Wreck in the 70s.)\n\nI now read Eileen Myles and some Alice Notley, also Susan Schultz. The Howes, Hejinian, I read a little of. I find the former solemn. Lyn Hejinian I'll read with interest.\n\nSo, I liked only a small percentage of what was available. Should I explain why I ignored so many male writers? Influence is a matter of enthusiasms and compatibilitiesand timing and availability. Within the narrowness of my tastes I don't think I was culpably blind to others' talents, male or female. Still, I doubt that my social attitudes were way ahead of their time either.\n\n82 Meaghan Morris. On The Beach. Too Soon Too Late. Bloomington: Indiana UP, 1998."
