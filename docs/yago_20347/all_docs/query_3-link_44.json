        "text": "No, there is currently no publicized plan to make a movie of this novel. Gaiman was quoted as saying:\n\nI'm currently keeping them off the market, which my agent may find a little frustrating.\n\nhttp://www.the-trades.com/ article\n\nAlbeit this quote is from 2002, but so far he seems to be sticking to his word, I follow his work pretty closely and have not seen anything to seems to change this.\n\nHBO Adapting Neil Gaiman’s AMERICAN GODS April 15, 2011 9:57 am\n\nJust days before HBO unveils their adaptation of George RR Martin’s novel Game of Thrones on Sunday which they translated into an epic-sized production, comes news from Deadline that attention has turned to Neil Gaiman’s American Gods.\n\nAuthor Neil Gaiman answered some questions on Reddit in 2013, one of which was related to American Gods. According to Gaiman, a series based on the book is still in the works, but it’s no longer being developed at HBO. Continue below to read his quote.\n\nWhen asked the question “I always hear things about an American Gods HBO Series, pilots and greenlights and all sorts of things. Whats the truth?” Gaiman answered:\n\n“There is an American Gods TV series in the works. It’s no longer with HBO. The moment that things are ready to be announced I am sure they will be, either legitimately or via a leak in a big Hollywood Agency mailroom.”\n\nUpdate\n\nNow American Gods has found a new home. It’s been announced that FreemantleMedia has acquired the rights to the project, though it’s not yet known what channel you can expect to see the show on yet.\n\n“A few people have asked for more background on this: HBO had an option on American Gods for several years. It went through three different pilot scripts. HBO has a limited number of slots and, after a while, passed it to Cinemax, who are in the HBO family, who decided eventually they didn’t want to do it, and the option expired, which unfortunately meant we couldn’t work with Tom Hanks’ production company Playtone any longer, as they are exclusive to HBO. However, Stefanie Berk, who had been one of the brightest stars at Playtone, had recently moved to Freemantle, and was as determined as she had been when she was at Playtone to bring American Gods to the screen. And I was impressed by her determination.”\n\n“There is an American Gods TV series in the works,” Gaiman wrote in the AMA. “It’s no longer with HBO.\n\nExtra Information from Neil's blog\n\nWhile it wasn't made as a movie, and the HBO/Playtone series fell through, it is a television series on the Starz network, and produced by Freemantle. The showrunners for the first season were Bryan Fuller (Hannibal, Pushing Daisies, Wonderfalls) and Michael Green (Kings). Neil Gaiman is an executive producer.\n\nThe first season premiered on April 30, 2017, 9pm EST and consisted of eight one-hour episodes. * David Slade (Hannibal) directed the first three episodes. See also the IMDb listing for the series. Principal cast included Ricky Whittle as Shadow Moon, Emily Browning as Laura Moon, and Ian McShane as Mr. Wednesday, and Gillian Anderson as Media.\n\nThe second series of American Gods airs on Starz on March 10, 2019 8pm EST, and is eight episodes. However, Fuller and Green are no longer the showrunners, nor is their replacement, Jesse Alexander. This has also apparently led to Gillian Anderson leaving the cast; they have created a new character, New Media (played by Kahyun Kim), to take the place of Media. Neil Gaiman is still involved, but is busy showrunning Good Omens for Amazon Prime."
