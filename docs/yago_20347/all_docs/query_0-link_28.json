He did not reveal the project's name or any further details.\n\nHe wrote: \"Very quick one just to say I'm in the offices of a film company in London, spending two days interviewing editors, production designers, costume people and the like....\n\n\"I can't tell you much more about it yet. It stars, er, a star, and another, different, star. I had the idea for it half way through the HousingWorks benefit Amanda [Palmer] and I did in [June] and pulled out my notebook and wrote it down.\"\n\nGaimanâ€™s A Short Film About John Bolton was released in 2003."
