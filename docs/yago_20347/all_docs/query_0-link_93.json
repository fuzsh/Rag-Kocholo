        "text": "Here is my clearest evidence yet that Neil Gaiman is becoming ubiquitous. Several days before Christmas, I was riding in a subway train, reading Gaiman's children's book Coraline. I looked up, and saw sitting directly across from me a woman who was absorbed in reading a copy of Gaiman's novel American Gods, complete with a photo of the author on the back cover, staring reproachfully at me, as if to say, \"You're only just now getting around to reading Coraline?\" This is disquieting.\n\nAnd he keeps turning up! Last December 5th the New York Times Sunday Book Review ran his review of The Annotated Brothers Grimm. Later that month, Gaiman was quoted in the Times article about the author of a new annotated edition of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes stories. (I was struck by the contrast between the Times writer's respect for this authority on Holmesian arcana and the comics industry's attitude towards its own annotators/historians and the worth of what they do. In other words, I've been knocking my head against the wall again, and I'm beginning to make a dent in the plaster.)\n\nFurther evidence of Gaiman's growing fame is Docurama's new release on DVD of the short subject that marks his debut as a film director. As I write this I have placed the Gaiman DVD next to the box for MGM Home Video's DVD of Ingmar Bergman's Persona: the title and Bergman's name are printed in the same size letters. However, the Gaiman DVD box's cover proclaims its title as NEIL GAIMAN'S (in very big letters) A Short Film about (in letters about a quarter of the size of Gaiman's name) John Bolton (in letters half the size of Gaiman's name).\" This is a rapid rise to auteurist fame, indeed. (Coincidentally, the Persona cover art features a rather more discreet image of female vampirism than does the Bolton DVD cover art.)\n\nI've already written about having seen A Short Film about Neil Gaiman at the 2003 San Diego Comic-Con (way back in \"Comics in Context\" #5: \"San Diego Con 2003: Day One\"), when Gaiman warned the audience not to give away the film's surprises. On this second viewing, I thought further about the short's themes, which I think I can say something about without revealing too much about the plot.\n\nThis Short Film takes the form of a documentary being filmed for an arts program on British television, but with an ironic edge. The John Bolton of the film is a portrait of the creative artist as a withdrawn, inarticulate feature, at ease in his studio but not in the world at large, and capable of expressing his deep passions only through his art.\n\nThe film's other leading character is a British TV host, or \"presenter,\" who, I suspect, may be a depiction of not simply a certain kind of journalist, but a certain sort of critic, scholar, or simply a fan. Not a creative artist himself, the presenter is intrigued by Bolton's art, a series of paintings of vampiresses, and naively asks the standard fan/journalist question, where do you get your ideas from? Like a critic, the presenter has a mind that works along more rational lines than the creative artist, or at least ones like the film's Bolton. The movie's Bolton claims to paint what he sees, as if images just come to him directly from his subconscious, intuitively, without any need for rational analysis.\n\nCurious about the sources of Bolton's work, the presenter naively tries to peer into the abyss that the artist portrays, at considerable risk. See Rorschach and his sessions with his psychiatrist in Alan Moore's Watchmen for a similar situation, albeit without Bolton's black comedy, or Q & A sessions with Dr. Hannibal Lecter.\n\nThere is also a cat in this movie, though it is not a black cat, and literally has only a walk-on role. This may seem to you to be a detail of little importance, but just wait.\n\nThe DVD features \"over 2 hours of additional material,\" which is roughly four times longer than the Bolton film itself. There's a video interview with Gaiman by Marcus Brigstocke, the actor who plays the presenter, and they both speak on Bolton's commentary track. Both features are entertaining and insightful, pointing to some nuances in the film that I might otherwise have missed. They do tend to speak as if only other Brits would be watching this film: I know who Jonathan Ross, who plays a part in the film, is, but ninety-nine percent of this DVD's American audience won't, nor will many of them be familiar with the style of British arts programs (I'm sorry: programmes).\n\nThe great majority of the \"additional material\" takes the form of Live from the Apollo, a documentary recording Gaiman's performance reading some of his own works at a theater in Portland, Oregon in 2000. This was from the last of Gaiman's tours to benefit that worthy charity, the Comic Book Legal Defense Fund, so it's good that one of these performances was preserved on video. I've never been to Portland, and the video doesn't give much sense of the city, but I was amused to see my old friend, Dark Horse editor Diana Schutz, popping up, unidentified, at the beginning and end, visibly pleased to be there.\n\nI've attended some of Gaiman's readings in the past, one in New York and another in Chicago. I think I detect an evolution in his stage/video persona. Originally, there was his familiar rock star look – leather jacket, dark glasses – which is something very, very few comics writers, or writers of any sort, really, can pull off, but which he did. The young audience at the Portland reading acted at times as if they were at a rock concert, with enthusiastic whoops of joy.\n\nNo shades in Portland, though. Here for much of the program Gaiman played the role of humorist. (Perhaps the real reason he lives in the Twin Cities area is to offer a hipper alternative to Garrison Keillor.) The first three pieces he read were comedic. In the first, a short story called Chivalry, an old British woman finds the Holy Grail amid a store's bric-a-brac, takes it home, and refuses to give it up when Sir Galahad comes knocking at her door. It struck me that this could be the premise of a routine by Monty Python, which famously made its own use of the Grail. Gaiman uses a dry, understated manner, whereas the Pythons would have the old women played by screeching men in drag, but Gaiman, like the Pythons, is here drawing humor from an ironic juxtaposition of the exalted and the mundane. In another comedic piece that Gaiman read, the narrator examines his reactions as he becomes steadily more drunk: this clearly provides acting opportunities, which Gaiman fulfilled both subtly and effectively. From this vantage point in time, I can see Gaiman in this video moving towards the stage persona he was using at the 2003 San Diego Con, in which, despite his denial, he exhibited much of the same performance style as a stand-up comedian, complete with doing funny impressions of people as he recounted anecdotes (see \"Comics in Context\" #8: \"San Diego 2003: Day Three: Gaiman, Groening and Bradbury\").\n\nThe comedic readings in Portland were followed by a segment in which Gaiman answers questions submitted on cards from the audience. One if these inquired as to how he feels about being termed a \"postmodern\" writer; having tried to figure out a definition of \"postmodern\" comics in this column (see see \"Comics in Context\" #56: \"Mind over Meta\"), I was amused that Gaiman confessed to not having any idea what being a \"postmodern writer\" meant.\n\nAfterwards, in a much more somber mode, Gaiman read The Price, which is not Arthur Miller's play of the same name, but his own eerie tale about a black cat. More on this later.\n\nEvery time I encounter comics writer/artist Colleen Doran, she looks somewhat different, primarily due to alterations in her hair's style, length and color. Neil Gaiman also appears to be experimenting with self-metamorphosis. In the video interview on the Bolton DVD, he appears with a thick beard, which, he explains, he hoped would give him more of an air of authority while directing the Bolton film. To my mind, this beard instead makes him look the part of the typically shaggy, nonconformist creative artist, which perhaps thereby allowed him to fit more snugly into the independent film community. (For one thing, the beard would provide welcome warmth amid the frigid temperatures at the Sundance Film Festival.)\n\nAnd then there were the two weeks last October when Gaiman was omnipresent as the host of the Fox Movie Channel's 13 Nights of Horror. Although the 13 Nights included a few genuinely excellent films (such as Edward Scissorhands), most of the movies I sampled were schlock, making me wish that TCM would hire Gaiman to host their considerably superior collection of Halloween movies the next year.\n\nNow, I have two favorite models for TV horror hosts: one is the Crypt-Keeper from HBO's Tales from the Crypt, adapted from the infamous EC horror comics, known for cackling bad puns, and the other is Elvira, known for displaying her d¿colletage. (Though Elvira currently appears in her own commendable comics series from Claypool, she used to star in DC Comics's Elvira's House of Mystery. Hence Elvira and Gaiman have something in common, having both been edited by Karen Berger, odd as this seems.) The Fox Movie Channel decided to split these hosting functions between Gaiman, who spoke with a welcome lack of bad puns and cackling, and a lady named Malena, portraying Gaiman's assistant, who remained silent but demonstrated visual attributes rivaling Elvira's. In fact, she could be one of the Bolton paintings from the movie come to life. The cavernous, macabre setting was meant to represent Gaiman's office, which looked much as I'd imagined it, though with not quite so many video screens. His assistant also looked much as I'd imagined her, though I assume his real assistant will take many more months, if not years, to live this down.\n\nFor this new role Gaiman metamorphosed yet again, and explained on his blog that \"I thought about my favourite horror hosts, Cain and Abel, and realized that what both of them had in common was dodgy facial hair. And that seemed like a look I could pull off: a sinister beard.. . And for filming I wore my coat instead of a leather jacket and little serial-killer glasses, and felt like a horror host on the inside. . . .\" But I have a short beard and small, rimless glasses; does that mean I look like a serial killer? Wait a moment. Let me think about this; I'll get back to you. Hmm. Maybe this explains a lot about my life.\n\nIn any event, I thought that the persona that Gaiman conveyed in his movie introductions was actually that of a soft-spoken, polite, British gent who was strangely unperturbed by the macabre environment in which he found himself (by which I mean the horror host set, not the Fox media empire), taking even the hovering, crypto-vampiric presence of the voluptuous Ms. Malena in stride.\n\nThe piece de resistance in the Fox Movie Channel's 13 Nights of Horror was Ridley Scott's Alien, in which one of the only two survivors of the bloodbath is the heroine's cat, whom I still suspect of having worked out a non-aggression pact with the title character. And this leads me back to this column's true subject: cats.\n\nJust before Christmas, Dark Horse Books released Gaiman's Creatures of the Night, a volume comprised of comics adaptations of two of Gaiman's prose short stories, The Price (which he reads on the Bolton DVD) and The Daughter of Owls, both illustrated by Michael Zulli.\n\nThe Price centers on an enigmatic feline known only as the Black Cat, who is adopted by an English writer who is not unlike Gaiman himself. I recall that Walt Kelly once did a sequence in Pogo exploring the question of just what a cat sees when it sits, seemingly staring into space. In The Price the reader finds out. The narrator of the tale, the aforementioned writer, is puzzled by the severe injuries that the Black Cat suffers at night. For the Cat's own good, the narrator shuts him in the basement at night to recover in peace. Yet while the Black Cat is thus confined, a series of misfortunes befall the writer and his family. The narrator releases the Black Cat, and uses a pair of night vision binoculars to watch what happens to the Cat at night. \"I found myself horrified by the number of swarming insects I could see in the night air,\" reports the narrator; \"it was as if the night world were some kind of nightmarish soup, swimming with life.\" More than that, the binoculars enable the narrator to see into another level of reality, beyond that of the material world. I will not tell you what it is that the narrator sees, but it is an opponent with whom the Black Cat does battle at night, thereby protecting the family that has adopted the Cat – or, more to the point, that the Cat has adopted – from the evils that the intruder brings.\n\nThe Black Cat of the story is a new version of an ancient archetype. I think of the statues of guardian figures in ancient China or medieval Europe, that often take the form of lions – cats, in other words. Then there are their modern equivalents: the famous lion statues, Patience and Fortitude, that stand outside the entrance to the main building of the New York Public Library; a similar pair that guard the front of the Art Institute of Chicago; and Sir Edwin Landseer's quartet of immense lions surrounding Nelson's Column in Trafalgar Square. Or consider the case of a human being who lives on the outskirts of a great city, and who dresses as a bat in order to combat the demonically grotesque criminals who menace that city. Or the case of a sorcerer, Dr. Stephen Strange, who lives in a townhouse of another, very similar city, who defends the threshold between Earth and demonic realms. Or the Justice League in their Watchtower in outer space, guarding the planet Earth. Or even the traditional role of an army, defending the frontiers, safeguarding the peaceful citizenry of their country. Animals or humans, super-powered or not, they are, one and all, threshold guardians standing between us and chaos.\n\nAt the end of The Price the narrator wonders who sent the Black Cat to him and his family, \"what we did to deserve the Black Cat,\" and how much longer he can protect them. The words conjure a sense of the fragility of life, happiness, and security, all of which could vanish overnight. They also pose the question of why some of us escape great suffering, while others fall victim to it (as we have just seen in the recent tsumani disaster), whether those who escape are any more worthy than those who did not, and how much longer God, fortune, or whatever other mysterious force will continue to protect us.\n\nThough Michael Zulli creates an appropriately eerie visual image for the sinister intruder, what most makes this adaptation work for me in comics form is his depiction of the Black Cat. I have a friend who owns a black cat (or who is owned by the cat) who looks almost exactly like the one that Zulli draws. (That's why I sent her – my friend, not the cat – a copy of Creatures of the Night as her Christmas present.) Zulli captures the look of mysterious, but inscrutable intelligence and severe emotion in such a cat's eyes: the cat seems to be thinking, but what exactly? Gaiman's story draws on this mystery about the consciousness of cats. Zulli also does wonders in his depiction of the narrator's other cats, giving them distinct personalities, but steering clear of anthropomorphizing any of the cats in this story. In doing so, Zulli further emphasizes the gravitas and mysterious intelligence of the Black Cat, which sets him apart from the other cats.\n\nWhile The Price is presented as an account direct from its narrator's lips, the second story, The Daughter of Owls, has a host of implicit framing devices: it purports to be an old legend, presumably conveyed orally through the centuries, told by the member of a Victorian gentleman's club to a colleague, who set it down in writing a century or more ago. This gives the tale the familiar aura of a fairy tale that took place long ago and far away, emphasizes its mythic tone, and even prepares the reader not to expect it to be realistic.\n\nThis is the story of an infant girl, believed to be the \"daughter of owls,\" who is confined to an abandoned convent for life. As she grows into her teens, her only human contact is with the person who brings her food; the girl never even learns to speak.\n\nNow, in this story I'm delighted by Zulli's characterful drawings of the Victorian gentlemen in the framing device, and his ominous owls are wonderful. But to my taste perhaps the girl is better left to the eye of the imagination. Pictured here, she is demure, clean, and wears a dress, and I kept wondering whether she should not be more of a feral creature, having had no human upbringing. Yet it is important for the story that she be the pure and innocent victim of cruel townspeople, and that then her, shall we say, animalistic side surfaces to take its vengeance. I shall not go into further detail for those of who have not yet read the story.\n\nAgain, though, Gaiman is constructing a new guise for a familiar archetype, the same that underlies the mythic figure of the werewolf. In this archetype, the human personality is divided into two: the vulnerable human, and the dark, hidden, potentially aggressive, violent, and even animalistic side: the Jungian shadow. Again, the archetype resurfaces in the superhero genre, as well, with the contrasts between the mild-mannered reporter and the Man of Steel; Logan the would-be samurai and his Wolverine self, prey to berserker rages; and again, the peaceful citizens like Peter Parker and Bruce Wayne who dress as animals in their costumed warrior personae.\n\nInterestingly, Gaiman wreaks a reversal with his heroine's tormentors: their outward human forms are the cruel aggressors, but their vulnerable sides are represented as animals.\n\nThe first story, The Price, is stronger than the second. I also like The Price better because it is a positive story of heroism, whereas The Daughter of Owls, however elegantly scripted and illustrated, is nonetheless a bleak revenge fantasy. The narrator concludes by calling Daughter of Owls \"a merry story,\" which should lead the reader to wonder what kind of person would find this dark tale humorous.\n\nTaking two years to get around to reading Coraline, Gaiman's children's book from HarperCollins, has had one advantage. Reading it back to back with Creatures of the Night emphasizes Gaiman's fascination with cats, especially black cats, for there is a black cat prominently featured in Coraline as well. Come to think of it, Morpheus appeared as a mysterious black cat in the Sandman story \"The Dream of a Thousand Cats.\" I begin to suspect that Mr. Gaiman has a real black cat in his life who has served to inspire him. \"There was also a haughty black cat, who sat on walls and tree stumps and watched her but slipped away if ever she went over to try to play with it,\" Gaiman writes early in Coraline. Yep, sounds like the black cat I know.\n\nOne of the blurbs in the paperback edition of Coraline asserts that \"I think this book will nudge Alice in Wonderland out of its niche at last.\" All right, Coraline is certainly good, but of course it's not that good! Much as I admire his work, Neil Gaiman isn't the equal of Lewis Carroll (and probably not as good a mathematician either, though I guess his emerging filmmaking abilities might eventually challenge Dr. Dodgson's skills at photography). But having said that, I am nonetheless amazed at how the initial colloquy between Gaiman's heroine Coraline and her talking black cat captures the tone and style of Alice's conversation with the Cheshire Cat. Pointing to feline body language that matches the sardonic comments of Coraline's cat, Gaiman also made me realize just how much what the Cheshire Cat says reflects Lewis Carroll's own insight into self-absorbed feline attitudes. It's no surprise that in this early scene Coraline's cat seemingly disappears and reappears, in an homage to the Cheshire Cat.\n\nMore unexpected is Coraline's cat's disdain for names: \"We know who we are, so we don't need names.\" Is Gaiman consciously paraphrasing the Impossible Man's celebrated line from Fantastic Four#11?\n\nThis black cat, though, proves to be considerably more helpful than the trickster Cheshire Cat (who, in Disney's version, prankishly even seeks to bring about Alice's beheading). Coraline's cat is the helpful animal companion of fairy tales, perhaps a symbol of Coraline's natural instincts. Like the Black Cat of The Price, Coraline's cat also wages battle against the principal menace. (In another parallel with The Price, a dog in Coraline is injured while secretly battling the \"other mother\" and is commended as a \"brave little soldier.\") Significantly, as Coraline becomes more heroic and self-reliant in the later part of the book, she protects and saves her cat, not the other way around.\n\nIn another parallel with The Price, Coraline is given a stone with a hole in it: peering through the stone enables her to perceive the souls of others. This is not unlike the binoculars in The Price, which allowed the narrator to see a spiritual being of another sort. Again, there is the idea of another level of reality to which we are blind in our daily lives.\n\nCoraline also parallels the Alice books in other ways. Coraline, the young heroine, considers herself an \"explorer,\" longing for excitement in what she considers a mundane life, and Alice, who eagerly follows talking rabbits into their otherdimensional burrows, fits the same description. Moreover, Coraline travels into what is even more clearly a mirror world than the one Alice finds Through the Looking Glass. True, Coraline travels through a door, rather than through a mirror, though she becomes trapped within a mirror later in the story, and there is no backwards writing in Coraline's alternate universe. But what Coraline finds is a duplicate of her own home and the people within it, as if it were a three-dimensional reflection, which initially seems superior to the real thing but soon proves to be a dangerous distortion of reality.\n\nYet another parallel is that Coraline, like the Sandman story \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\" (recently analyzed in see \"Comics in Context\" #65: \"Artists Alone\"), deals with the theme of a child who feels ignored by his or her parent. In the Sandman series William Shakespeare ends up unable to forgive himself for neglecting his son Hamnet, and is tormented by the possibility that he could have prevented Hamnet's early death. Coraline takes a very different approach: she feels that her parents, consumed by working at their computers in their home offices, don't pay sufficient attention to her. So Coraline is initially tempted by the \"other mother\" and \"other father\" whom she finds in the mirror world, who focus their full attention on her and at first seem perfect. But that perfection is, as in The Stepford Wives, a deceptive surface for a dreadful reality.\n\n\"It was true: the other mother loved her,\" Coraline comes to realize. \"But she loved Coraline as a miser loves money, or a dragon loves its gold. In the other mother's button eyes, Coraline knew that she was a possession, nothing more.\" The reference to dragons like Wagner's Fafnir is further evidence that Gaiman is aware that he is working with mythic themes and archetypes here.\n\nIn encouraging Coraline to amuse herself, her busy parents were, perhaps inadvertently, also encouraging her to act on her own, to discover and develop her individuality. In contrast, the \"other mother\" and \"other father\" are so possessive that they would smother Coraline's individuality, and, as we learn, literally steal her soul.\n\nCoraline doesn't just resemble Lewis Carroll's Alice, but also L. Frank Baum's Dorothy. (In the famous 1938 film of The Wizard of Oz, Oz too is a mirror world with \"reflections\" of real people.) In her exploits in the \"other\" world, Coraline gains a greater appreciation of her real parents, notably through her reminiscences of a time when her father saved her from a swarm of angry wasps by sacrificing himself, allowing them to sting him instead. In Gaiman's \"Midsummer Night's Dream\" Shakespeare was not in touch with his own buried emotions towards his son, but Coraline's father clearly is. Towards the end of the book, looking about the real world, Coraline realizes that \"Nothing. . .had ever been so interesting\": her eyes have been opened to its true virtues. Or, as Dorothy says in the film, \"There's no place like home.\"\n\nIt's important that Coraline's story is not done when she first escapes from the \"other\" world. Demonstrating her newfound appreciation of her parents, she must return on a quest to save them from captivity in the mirror world: this becomes a symbolic descent into the underworld, a land of death, like Orpheus's seeking to rescue Eurydice. Coraline also becomes a liberator, an enemy of tyranny, freeing other children who were held captive there. As in traditional fairy tales about child heroes, Coraline matures spiritually and grows more capable as an individual through her adventures, demonstrating that she has, as she is told, \"good fortune and wisdom and courage.\"\n\nGaiman has stated more than once that adults find Coraline, with its eerie imagery, disturbing but children do not. Perhaps this is because adults have more understanding of the concept of mortality. But beneath the macabre elements, Coraline is, as I have pointed out, an uplifting adventure story. And it's funny, too. At one point in the story, an actress is performing a scene from Shakespeare's Macbeth for an audience of talking dogs. \"'Is this a dagger that I see before me?' she asked. 'Yes!' shouted all the little dogs. 'It is!'\" Until I read that, I had not realized that it was way past time that somebody had finally answered that question.\n\nMISTAKEN IDENTITY\n\nIdentity Crisis #7 is my favorite issue of the series because it is the last one and there will be no more. I've already reviewed all the previous issues (in see \"Comics in Context\" #57: \"As Grim as It Gets,\", #58: \"Crisis of Conscience,\", and #63: \"Superfolks, Syndrome, Sharks and Spinach\"), and I had hoped that the final issue would provide some unexpected plot twist that would somehow redeem the series, justifying the ugliness of its treatment of various longrunning DC characters. But no, the seventh issue makes matters even worse. If you haven't read it yet and want to be surprised, stop reading this review here.\n\nOne of the underappreciated virtues of the great Silver Age DC comics edited by the late Julius Schwartz was their treatment of women.\n\nIn the late 1950s and early 1960s, before the feminist revolution, Schwartz's leading ladies included a reporter (Iris West in The Flash), a lawyer (Jean Loring in The Atom), and even the head of an aircraft company (Carol Ferris in Green Lantern). Shiera Hall was merely a secretary at the Midway City Museum, but as Hawkgirl she was a police officer on her native planet Thanagar and an equal partner to her husband Hawkman (Carter Hall) in their superheroic exploits. Then there was Zatanna, bravely traversing the dimensions in her search for her missing father (as chronicled in the recent DC trade paperback Zatanna's Quest). Barbara Gordon initially conformed to hackneyed stereotypes as a dowdy librarian, but her transformation into Batgirl could be seen in retrospect as a symbol of the emerging female empowerment movement of the 1960s. (Moreover, by the 1970s Barbara had given herself a makeover even in her \"civilian identity\" and ran for Congress.)\n\nThe wealthy Sue Dibny, the wife of Ralph Dibny, the Elongated Man, was not a career woman, but she proved to be a role model in a different way. Hawkman, Hawkgirl and the Elongated Man were the first married superheroes, and Schwartz and writer Gardner Fox portrayed the Dibnys and the Halls' marriages in a positive light. This was unusual in the comics of that time. Lois Lane, Lana Lang, and Vicki Vale (in Batman) were nuisances, attempting to expose the heroes' secret identities. Most superhero series subliminally conveyed the message that men should keep free of romantic entanglements and that women could not be trusted. Presumably, since superhero comics then were aimed at children, editors and writers thought that young boys wouldn't want to read about married couples, who might remind them of their parents. Through the Halls and the Dibnys, Schwartz and Fox countered the implicit misogyny of these early superhero series and helped the genre grow up.\n\nSo, now in Identity Crisis #7 comes the grand revelation that the murderer of one Schwartz heroine, Sue Dibny, is none other than another Schwartz heroine, Jean Loring. In the past I've heard comedians joke that the typically obtuse male reaction when a guy and his girlfriend break up is that \"She went nuts!\" So, many years ago Jean had married Ray Palmer, the Atom, and subsequently it was decided to have them divorce. Now, in Identity Crisis, it turns out that Jean is insane. Having decided she wants Ray back, Jean decided to endanger Sue so that all the superheroes, including Ray, would react by drawing closer to their loved ones. It's like one of Lois Lane's harebrained schemes from the 1950s and early 1960s, when she often seemed like Lucy Ricardo transplanted into Metropolis, gone horribly wrong. (Jean's plot entailed using the Atom's costume to shrink herself to microscopic size. This might confuse old-time readers, who will recall that in the Silver Age if Ray Palmer tried to use the white dwarf star matter to shrink and re-enlarge anything but himself, the thing would blow up.) Jean claims that she didn't intend for Sue to die, or, for that matter, the father of Tim Drake, the current Robin: this seems an odd argument for a highly accomplished lawyer to make. Just how did the rational Ms. Loring come to lose her mind? There is no explanation.\n\nIt gets still worse. Jean is incarcerated in Arkham Asylum. Now, this Grand Guignol house of horrors may seem dramatically appropriate for many of Batman's recurring adversaries, who are hardly realistic characters. But Jean Loring is a \"real\" person in a world of superheroes. If she is mentally disturbed, then she should receive real psychiatric help, and not be locked away in this anachronistic dungeon. Identity Crisis shows us a tabloid headline: \"Atom's Wife Tortured by Inmates.\" Torture should not even happen to cold-blooded killers. Is the headline meant to be true? If so, does anyone – like the Atom or other superheroes – try to stop the torture? It appears not.\n\nThus, in one fell swoop, Identity Crisis manages to degrade two of Schwartz's heroines. But wait, it actually assaults three of them, because even though a number of Justice Leaguers agreed to brainwash various people – including Batman! – it was Zatanna who actually did the deeds. Not only that, but she did it incompetently, damaging Dr. Light's mind.\n\nOther Schwartz Silver Age heroines are lucky they weren't in this series. Then again, Iris West and Adam Strange's \"sweetheart\" Alanna have both been killed off and resurrected in times past, the Silver Age Hawkgirl doesn't really exist in the present revised continuity, and Barbara Gordon was permanently crippled. This is not a good track record for DC.\n\nWell, then, do the Justice Leaguers – mostly male – who agreed to the brainwashing face any sort of moral reckoning? No. They get off scott free. And doesn't it seem strange that Oliver Queen, the original Green Arrow, so memorably portrayed by Denny O'Neil as a committed liberal idealist, would become an apologist for the brainwashing? Isn't this out of character?\n\nConsidering all the talk about the many resurrections in the DC Universe in previous issues of \"Identity Crisis,\" I wondered if there would be some sort of payoff in the final issue. But no, Sue's still dead. It's mostly guys, like Superman and Green Arrow, who get to come back.\n\nIdentity Crisis has been accused of misogyny. In my past reviews of the series, I've been willing to give it the benefit of the doubt. But now it's clear that, intentionally or not, \"Identity Crisis\" is indeed disturbingly misogynistic.\n\nIs it possible, though, that with Identity Crisis, the Grim and Gritty school of comics has finally hit bottom? Is the pendulum finally swinging in the opposite direction?\n\nIt's a pleasure to see how in Green Lantern: Rebirth #3 Geoff Johns is cleverly explaining away how the Silver Age GL, Hal Jordan, turned into an insane mass murderer. It turns out that he was possessed by an evil cosmic being called Parallax. This is reminiscent of X-Men's Dark Phoenix Saga, but the echo effect is fine with me if it clears Hal's name. Johns resurrects Sinestro, finds a way to bring back Hal's \"dead\" body, hints at bringing back Carol Ferris and Coast City from the dead, and even explains away Hal's streaks of white hair (from DC's misconceived decision to make him middle-aged). It looks as if Johns will explain everything away except for the conundrum of why DC had inflicted all this damage on the Hal Jordan character in the first place. For years many of us have been hoping for this to happen, while DC stuck to its guns and even complicated matters further, as in turning Hal into the Spectre. Now, finally, the character of Hal Jordan will be restored to what he is supposed to be. Maybe if we wait long enough, the damage to Sue and Jean will be undone as well.\n\nAn even clearer sign that the pendulum is swinging back is the announcement in the new issue of Wizard about DC's new All-Stars line: these new comics, starting with All-Stars versions of Superman and Batman and Robin, are said to present \"timeless, iconic, Pre-Crisis on Infinite Earths versions of the characters.\" If that's true, then these will be versions of the characters that are true to Silver Age continuity.\n\nIn the Wizard article, DC executive Dan DiDeo even cites Alan Moore's \"Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow?\", the last Superman story in the old continuity, as an example of what the All-Stars books will be like. Reading that startled me, because I had already identified \"Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow\" as the first \"Neo-Silver\" story (back in see \"Comics in Context\" ##33: \"A Boatload of Monsters and Miracles\").\n\nSo it appears I have been correct in perceiving a \"Neo-Silver\" movement in comics, which seeks to revive the traditional, positive, genuinely heroic spirit of the \"Silver Age\" superhero stories within a contemporary context. Will the All-Star books mark the triumph of this movement? How many of today's writers can really recapture that spirit? Last year's DC Comics Presents tribute comics to Julius Schwartz almost all failed to create contemporary stories that were both in his mold and met today's standards for literary sophistication. The significant exception was the DC Comics Presents: Hawkman comic with wonderful stories by Cary Bates and Kurt Busiek and striking artwork by John Byrne and Walter Simonson, all of whom understand the Silver Age tradition. Grant Morrison will be writing the All-Stars Superman title; thinking back to his cold, revisionist Doom Patrol, I wonder if he really will write in \"Neo-Silver\" style. I also wonder if DC's strategy is to do these All-Star books for the older, traditionalist readers, in the hope that then they won't complain so loudly the next time some longrunning character is killed or otherwise mishandled in the main continuity.\n\nIdentity Crisis was such a best seller and garnered so much publicity that surely DC and Marvel will both try to duplicate its success through inflicting more shocking fates upon their classic characters. Will the neo-Silver books prove to be as popular? DC's \"grim and gritty\" treatment of its characters began in earnest with the deaths of Supergirl and the Silver Age Flash in Crisis on Infinite Earths, nearly twenty years ago. Crisis also eliminated DC's parallel Earths, notably Earth-2, the alternate world where the superheroes of comics' \"Golden Age\" of the 1940s dwelled, as featured in such series as All-Star Comics and Roy Thomas's All-Star Squadron. Will the All-Stars line will DC ironically be creating a new \"Earth-2,\" in which the versions of DC's superheroes from the mid-1950s through the mid-1980s live on?\n\nI certainly hope DC will present an alternative to the treatment of its classic heroes in Identity Crisis. Otherwise the cover illustration for the final issue will be all too appropriate; just a collection of empty costumes.\n\nADVERTISEMENTS FOR MYSELF\n\nThis spring I'm teaching another semester of my course, \"Comics as Literature\" (X02.9288) at New York University's School of Continuing and Professional Studies. This spring's syllabus includes Chris Claremont and John Byrne's \"The Dark Phoenix Saga,\" various 1960s underground stories by R. Crumb, Will Eisner's A Life Force, Marjane Satrapi's Persepolis, Frank Miller and Bill Sienkiewicz's Elektra: Assassin, Alan Moore and David Lloyd's V for Vendetta, and another volume of Neil Gaiman's Sandman. The class begins Wednesday evening, March 2, but registration is open right now.\n\nI will be interviewing Bill Sienkiewicz and other some comics luminaries onstage at the Big Apple Convention at the Penn Plaza Pavilion, at 7th Ave. and 33rd St., in Manhattan, on Saturday, January 22 and Sunday, January 23.\n\nAlso, I'm one of the pundits who took part in Heidi MacDonald's Annual Beat Survey\" about the biggest stories in comics in 2004 and 2005. You can check it out here.\n\nNOTE: I was already two thirds of the way through writing this week's column when I learned of the passing of comics pioneer Will Eisner. His career will be the subject of next week's column.\n\nCopyright 2005 Peter Sanderson"
