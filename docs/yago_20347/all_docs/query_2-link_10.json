        "text": "\"The Dish\": Fact versus Fiction — a quick comparison\n\n(Refer to \"Parkes: 30 Years of Radio Astronomy\" available through Visitors Centre, $30).\n\nSeveral true things in the film:\n\nwe did point at the Moon, and, as arranged, did take signals, and successfully, for the moonwalks\n\nwe normally park our dish at 35km/hr. On the day of the moonwalk it was gusting 100km/hr.\n\nGoldstone (USA) signals did \"disappear into the ground\" on the day\n\nthere is a visitors centre nearby\n\nstaff do take \"hayrides\" as one means to get equipment up onto the dish\n\nParkes did use an \"off-axis\" feed to acquire signals of the first few minutes\n\nthe astronauts did go outside ahead of schedule\n\nwe do have a UPS and backup diesel generator\n\nNASA did get coordinates wrong occasionally on very early missions\n\nthe control room set and operation of the dish was very realistic representation of 1969\n\nPure fictions (to make a good story)\n\nthere was no power failure\n\nthere was no animosity with Americans; we are accustomed to sharing expertise both ways\n\nthe Prime Minister visited Honeysuckle Creek, not Parkes\n\nstaff names and personas: Director, John Bolton died in 1993. Letty Bolton lives in Queensland and visits occasionally\n\nthere are no tours of the telescope for visitors\n\nUnderstated/overlooked aspects\n\nthe first few minutes of the televised broadcast originated from Honeysuckle Creek, near Canberra\n\nmore NASA staff and OTC (Telecom) staff were present; it was a larger team effort\n\nthe congratulatory telegram included a lot more players than just Parkes\n\nquality control and foresight at Parkes were much greater than as portrayed. The Director had actually calculated how fast for teams of men to wind the electric motors in the event of a total power failure.\n\nit was quite normal to scan side to side to find a source and strongest signal\n\nthe wind kept blowing a gale during the moonwalks\n\nour then-Director, John G Bolton, made the decision to keep pointing in the wind. In this universe he got away with it!\n\nParkes Radio Telescope is a valuable astronomical instrument, ten thousand times more sensitive than when first commissioned in 1961. No time is wasted on the dish, one the the best radio telescopes in the world.\n\nPuzzling aspects\n\nPrime Ministerial ignorance (we were well known — half the construction funds were from Commonwealth Government)\n\nas big as a football field. (it's big, but not that big; what footy field is that small?)\n\nCricket on the Dish"
