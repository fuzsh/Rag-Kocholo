        "text": "Jimmy Palmiotti is a multi-hyphenate, with creative talent bursting out in multiple areas within comics. He started out inking, and eventually moved to writing and creating his own independent comics through his Paperfilms company. Along with his wife Amanda Conner (who is an illustrator and writer extraordinaire), he penned the comic book Harley Quinn for DC and brought the character completely into the mainstream. He has also been a writer and game changer on comic book titles like like Jonah Hex (with his amazing co-writer Justin Gray), Denver (also with Justin Gray), Painkiller Jane, Power Girl, Starfire (with Amanda Conner), The Avengers Vs. X-Men and so many more. JImmy is also a true powerhouse of creativity in TV, Film, Gaming and World Building! ___________________________________________\n\n\"Hans Karl's tracks drag you from the grungiest underbellies of music through garden parties and jungles and cocktail lounges, sometimes all at once. He's his own man, and his music is there for you to use.\" - Neil Gaiman.\n\nNeil Gaiman is an English author of short fiction, novels, comic books, graphic novels, nonfiction, audio theatre, and films. His works include the comic book series The Sandman and novels Stardust, American Gods, Coraline, and The Graveyard Book. Neil Gaiman's work has been honoured with many awards internationally, including the Newbery and Carnegie Medals.\n\nHe has written and directed two films: A Short Film About John Bolton (2002) and Sky Television's Statuesque (2009) starring Bill Nighy and Amanda Palmer.\n\nAn animated feature film based on Gaiman's Coraline, directed by Henry Selick and released in early 2009, secured a BAFTA for Best Animated Film and was nominated for an Oscar in the same category.\n\nMost recently, Gaiman was the executive producer for the television adapation of his groundbreaking The Sandman comic book, which was produced by Warner Bros and released by Netflix to much critical acclaim.\n\n___________________________________________\n\nShag is a painter, designer and illustrator working in Southern California. His distinctive artistic style draws from commercial illustration from the past five decades, but the work is imbued with an attitude and sly sense of humor which is unmistakably of our time. Solo exhibitions of Shag's work have been held in the United States, Europe, Japan, Australia and South America.\n\nThe paintings themselves celebrate consumerism and consumption on vividly colored sharply rendered panels; the characters drink, smoke and eat in lavish, stylish surroundings. But Shag sees the visuals of his work as window-dressing or stage scenery. He's more concerned with the themes and narratives in the paintings, and the meanings a viewer might find when he looks at a piece of Shag art.\n\nShag lives with his wife and children in a mid-century home overlooking a peaceful wooded valley, much like homes he paints in his art. He considers Palm Springs, California his second home and is an enthusiastic booster for the city. In 2009 The Shag Store opened in Palm Springs. It is the world's first retail boutique and gallery dedicated solely to his art, prints and merchandise, and has quickly become a must-see destination for people visiting the city.\n\n___________________________________________\n\n\"You definitely have the chops Hans. You have both a tremendous sense of groove and melody and your compositions are quite evocative and cinematic. Do stay in touch and keep making that sweet music!\" - Louie Del Carmen.\n\nLOUIE DEL CARMEN is a writer-director, artist and creator with a career in the animation industry spanning two and a half decades and counting\n\nCurrently with SKYDANCE ANIMATION and based in Los Angeles, United States, he has worked for Walt Disney Animation, Sony Pictures Animation, Dreamworks, Nickelodeon, Cartoon Network and others.
