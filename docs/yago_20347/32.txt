The talented Ilan Sheady (he does fantastic bluray covers) told me there was a short faux-doc about John Bolton, directed by Neil Gaiman. So after some quick internet searching I found the film on YouTube.

Solid film. It's very dry and to those unfamiliar with John Bolton, it may be a bit of a slog. I'm definitely a fan of Bolton's art, but still found it hard to become immersed in this faux reality.

I love where the film goes,â€¦
