Comic writer and filmmaker Neil Gaiman directed this documentary profile of artist John Bolton. Bolton has earned both praise and controversy for his paintings, which usually depict nude female vampires in settings which seem both seductive and dangerous. This portrait of the artist takes a look at the quiet man behind the menacing images, and tries to answer the question of where he gets his ideas.
