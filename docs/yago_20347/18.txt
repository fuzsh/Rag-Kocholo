Writer Neil Gaiman is to direct a short silent film he has penned.

The Sandman author revealed on his blog that he will begin directing the production in two weeks.

The film - Gaiman's second - will be part of a series of silent films broadcast in the UK in December. He did not reveal the project's name or any further details.

He wrote: "Very quick one just to say I'm in the offices of a film company in London, spending two days interviewing editors, production designers, costume people and the like....

"I can't tell you much more about it yet. It stars, er, a star, and another, different, star. I had the idea for it half way through the HousingWorks benefit Amanda [Palmer] and I did in [June] and pulled out my notebook and wrote it down."

Gaimanâ€™s A Short Film About John Bolton was released in 2003.
