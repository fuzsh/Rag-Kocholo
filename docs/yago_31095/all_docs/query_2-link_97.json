        "text": "It is with joy and sadness that we announce the passing of our beloved Mother just 47 days before her 100th birthday.\n\nMom was born in Juniata, Sask. and was raised in rural Saskatchewan, the baby of a family of 7. Her father died when she was 9 and she and her mother supported themselves by hard work and determination.\n\nWhen she was 19 she married Ron Sommerfeld, and they celebrated 70 years of marriage before Dad passed in 2009. Mom and Dad had three children: Gwen (Bill Shaw deceased) Gloria (Art Hitchings) and son, Garth Sommerfeld. (Debbie). There are many children, grandchildren, nieces and nephews who will miss her smile and caring disposition, far too many to name but she loved them all and was very proud of each and every one. She loved and appreciated her son’s in-law and daughter-in-law. She only has one sister-in-law left, Dad’s sister, Mid Novak (nee Sommerfeld). She loved to see Aunt Mid when she could manage, and they had a long and loving relationship.\n\nMom and Dad lived and worked in Saskatoon until retirement when they moved to the Okanagan. They enjoyed many happy years there and made lifelong friends. Many family and friends travelled to see them, and Mom always enjoyed that so much! They moved to Lethbridge when Dad’s health started to fail, in February 2009. The family in Lethbridge {Gwen’s} and in Saskatchewan, {Garth’s and Gloria’s} gathered around them to make their life here fulfilling and Mom spent her last years here. One of her proudest moments was when she became the matriarch of 6 generations of females! This is very rare and was reported in Germany, London England, as well as many domestic papers. Life was far from easy, but Mom could always find a way to feed a few extras. She was known for her love of entertaining and partying. She never missed a birthday in the family until her last few years. She made a true effort to stay in touch with nieces and nephews on both sides of the family, many of whom had lived with her and Dad at times!\n\nMom had a long and healthy life! In recent months, as her health declined, she told us she wanted to go. She was looking forward to a reunion with her sister Sybil, whom she was very close to, and husband Ron. She was much loved and will be missed by all who knew her.\n\nIn lieu of flowers a donation to St. Michael’s Palliative Care unit in Lethbridge and/or a charity of your choice would be appreciated.\n\nVera’s Descendants;\n\nGwen Shaw (Bill deceased), Grace Couturier (Duane), Amanda Dunn (Shaun), Alisa Marsh (Logan), Callie Marsh, Cooper Marsh, Hunter Peterson, James Couturier, Gord Shaw (Dianne), Candace Shaw, Billy Shaw, Ashley Shaw, Keya, Keagan, Starla, Kansan\n\nGlenna Hemsley (Dale), Jason Hemsley, Colton, Saveya, Charlene Kitt (Trevor), Ethan, Liam, Harley, Gail Shaw (Donnie Buttazzoni), Michael\n\nB.J.
