        "text": "Did You Know...?\n\nI got tons of letters from people requesting that I post trivia for AMC and OLTL as I did for GH last week. Ask and you shall receive!\n\nFollowing that thought (asking and receiving), I sincerely hope that you will all contribute generously to the Eye on Soaps expense fund this month. This is the week that our site expenses are due and as always, we fully depend on the generosity of our fans to remain on the internet. No EOS means no Sage, baby! Click HERE to help!Without you, Eye on Soaps goes away!\n\nAll My Children\n\nRebecca Budig (Greenlee) comes from a large family. She has seven older siblings.\n\nMarch Walker (Liza) left AMC in 1984 fearing she would be typecast. She returned to the part a decade later.\n\nEven with a perfect body, Esta TerBlanche (Gillian) wore a boned corset to get a more perfect curved shape for Ryan and Gillian's second wedding.\n\nAmanda Bearse, best known as neighbor to the Bundys, Marcy Rhodes D'Arcy, played Amanda Cousins on AMC from 1982-1984. Bearse went on to direct many episodes of \"Married With Children,\" as well as several other prime time shows.\n\nSusan Lucci (Erica) is an active supporter of The March of Dimes, resulting from health complications her son, Andreas, experienced at birth (he is fine and healthy now).\n\nWhen Josh Duhamel was cast as Leo, he wanted to completely immerse himself in the character. To that end, he developed an entire back story for the character, much of which was actually used on the show.\n\nMeg Mundy, who played Gillian's grandmother, Eugenia, also appeared on The Doctors and Loving.\n\nAlthough raised in England,\n\nFinola Hughes (ex-Alex/Anna) is actually of Irish descent.\n\nWhen she met older man Helmut Huber, Susan Lucci (Erica) was a young and engaged ingénue. Eventually she and her fiancé parted ways and her heart led her to Helmut, her husband of thirty-six years and counting.\n\nJ. Eddie Peck (ex-Jake) paid his way through college by hosting a Country and Western radio show in Missouri.\n\nFormer ER star Julianna Margulies auditioned for the role of Dr. Maria Santos, which eventually went to Eva LaRue.\n\nBrendan Fraser of Encino Man fame read for the part of Brian Bodine, Hayley's first love.\n\nJulia Roberts, auditioned for the role of Cliff Warner's sister Linda.\n\nHandsome Vincent Irizarry's (David) has quite a diverse ethnicity. His family is Italian, Puerto Rican, and Ukrainian.\n\nMarj Dusay (Vanessa) has quite a history on classic TV shows. She played Blair's mom on Facts of Life and stole Spock's brain on the original Star Trek, to name two.\n\nDavid Canary (Adam/Stuart) may play twins on AMC, but his father is a twin in real life!\n\nDavid Canary (Adam/Stuart) won a scholarship to the University of Cincinnati for football.\n\nWatch the 1999 teen smash American Pie and you'll spy Eden Riegel (ex-Bianca)\n\nJerry McGuire actress Renee Zellweger used to have a crush on Pine Valley's own Tad the cad! Renee was hooked on AMC as a teen.\n\nCameron Mathison has a thing for KISS. By his own admission, he loves Gene Simmons.\n\nWhen Jill Larson (Opal) lived in Paris she took up the modeling profession. The statuesque red-head graced the pages of such magazines as Mademoiselle and Marie Claire.\n\nJohn Callahan (ex-Edmund) was once pre-law at the University of California.\n\nDavid Canary (Adam/Stuart) studied karate under Chuck Norris.\n\nRebecca Budig (Greenlee) played Natalie Wood in 1997's \"James Dean: Race with Destiny.\" She also made an appearance in 1995's \"Batman Forever.\"\n\nIn the initial rough draft for All My Children, Agnes Nixon gave her young vixen the name of Susan. By the time that a fresh-faced actress named Susan Lucci auditioned for the role, Agnes had decided to name the character Erica.\n\nHere is a dramatic case of life imitating art, or perhaps art imitating life. When Susan Lucci was a young woman, she was involved in a car accident in which her face was damaged. Luckily she was able to afford medication attention and the doctors restored her beautiful face. When Agnes penned the story of Erica’s car accident and subsequent facial disfigurement, she had no idea of Susan’s own experience.\n\nGillian Spencer (ex-Daisy) is now an accomplished soap writer, having penned scripts for OLTL, DOOL, AMC, ATWT and AW.\n\nIn 1996, AMC became the first soap to begin with a recap of the previous day’s events and to end with a teaser. OLTL and GH followed suit a few months later.\n\nDavid Canary (Adam/Stuart) and brother John are descended from the legendary cowgirl Calamity Jane (aka Martha Jane Canary).\n\nElizabeth Taylor began watching AMC while living in Washington DC as the wife of Senator John Warner. She did a guest spot on the show as a surprise for friend and fellow guest Carol Burnett (playing Verla). Burnett was so surprised to see Taylor that she let out an expletive, forcing the scene to be re-shot.\n\nMark Consuelos (ex- Mateo), born in Spain, learned to speak English partly by watching American soaps, including AMC.\n\nChristopher Lawford (ex-Charlie Brent), is a Kennedy clan member. His father, British actor Peter Lawford, married JFK’s sister Patricia in 1954.\n\nKelly Ripa and Mark Consuelos (Hayley and Mateo) picked on-screen sister Eva LaRue Callahan (Maria) to be the godmother to their son Michael. When Consuelos first joined AMC, it was Eva, not Kelly, to whom he gravitated.\n\nMaurice Benard (ex-Nico, now Sonny Corinthos on GH) changed his name from Mauricio Morales because he felt that he was continually being typecast. Benard was his grandmother’s maiden name.\n\nCady McClain (ex-Dixie) didn’t get her driver’s license until she needed it for a scene in which Dixie hits Billy Clyde Tuggle with her car.\n\nIn 1994, the Martin house was destroyed by an on-screen tornado. A giant engine was used to generate seventy-five mph winds for the scene, which also required ten cameras instead of the usual three. Until it’s destruction in those scenes, the Martin house was AMC’s oldest set still in use.\n\nMichael E. Knight (Tad) is married to Catherine Hickland (currently Lindsay on OLTL).\n\nJames Patrick Stuart (ex-Will Cortlandt) is the son of Chad Stuart, who found fame as half of Chad and Jeremy in the 1960’s.\n\nLike Phoebe Tyler Wallingford, the late Ruth Warrick (Phoebe) can trace her ancestry back to the Mayflower. She also has legendary frontiersman Daniel Boone in her family history.\n\nPine Valley is located near Llanview (home of One Life to Live), in Pennsylvania. Most of the outside scenes for All My Children, though, were shot in Connecticut. Cortlandt Manor is actually the Waveny Mansion in New Canaan, and deceased Martins are “buried” in a small Connecticut cemetery. Seldom seen anymore, Pine Valley University exteriors were shot on the Princeton University campus, in New Jersey. In 1978, AMC became the first soap to film outside the United States, when Erica and Tom Cudahy went to Saint Croix for their honeymoon.\n\nErica has been married ten times: Jeff Martin, Phil Brent, Tom Cudahy, Adam Chandler, Mike Roy, Travis Montgomery, Travis again, Adam, and Dimitri Marick (twice). Not all these have been legal marriages, but we’ll ignore that for the time being.\n\nAdam has been married eight times: Althea Chandler, Erica Kane, Brooke English, Dixie Cooney, Natalie Hunter, Erica again, Gloria Marsh and Liza Colby. Brooke, Dixie and Natalie don’t count, though, as he was still married to Erica at the time (same reason her ten trips down the aisle don’t all count).\n\nPalmer Cortlandt is no slouch in the marriage department, either. While Adam has made more total trips down the aisle, at least all of Palmer’s seven weddings were legitimate: Daisy Cortlandt, Donna Beck, Daisy again, Cynthia Preston, Natalie Hunter, Opal Gardner Purdy and Vanessa Bennett.\n\nTom Cudahy was also a busy guy during his AMC time. For a devout Catholic who at one time had been considering the priesthood, Tom is pretty familiar with the sacrament of matrimony: Erica Kane, Brooke English, Skye Chandler, Barbara Montgomery, and Livia Frye.\n\nSpeaking of marriages: Jill Larson, who plays Opal Cortlandt, is legally ordained to perform wedding ceremonies.\n\nWhat really happened to Bobby Martin? Bobby, played (albeit briefly) by Mike Bersell, did not go upstairs to polish his skis, never to be seen again. He in fact went off to summer camp, where he apparently slipped everyone’s mind forever after. Almost twenty years later, the writers did get a little comedy mileage out of the situation, though: Opal Purdy, who was staying with the Martins for a while, accidentally got locked in the attic. While rooting around up there, she stumbled over a skeleton sitting next to a pair of skis, on its head a baseball cap with the name Bobby on it.\n\nOne Life to Live\n\nDarlene Vogel (ex-Melanie) played Danny Tanner’s sister on \"Full House.\"\n\nErika Slezak (Viki) was one of the youngest students ever accepted to the prestigious Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts in London at age 17.\n\nKamar de los Reyes (Antonio) comes from a musical family. His brothers Daniel and Walfredo Jr., as well as his father Walfredo Sr (a famed percussionist), appeared on OLTL in 1997. Also a percussionist, Daniel has worked with such artists as Don Henley, Jennifer Lopez, Stevie Nicks, Chris Isaak, Sheryl Crow, and former soap star Ricky Martin (ex-Miguel GH). You may have caught Kamar in a Spanish-themed Toni Braxton music video recently.\n\nAdmirers of the dress that Viki (Erika Slezak) wore to her wedding to Ben will be interested to hear that all of its embroidery was custom done.\n\nThom Christopher (ex-Carlo/Mortimer) is the only actor to receive two separate Emmy nominations for two roles on the same show. He was nominated for his role as Mortimer in 1993 and won in 1992 for Carlo Hesser.\n\nFormer head writer Michael Malone gave the name \"Todd\" to his new villain because it was very strong and it sounded like the German word for death.\n\nAccording to her husband (AMC's Michael E. Knight - Tad), Catherine Hickland (Lindsay) has vast soap opera experience. Not only has she been on six soaps herself, she has watched them since she was eighteen.\n\nJames DePaiva (ex-Max) has a black belt in Kung Fu. He was also a professional musician for eight years after high school.\n\nEver wonder what the \"S\" in Robert S. Woods (Bo) stands for? That would be Sosebee. As for the \"B\" in Hillary B. Smith (Nora), that would be Bailey, her maiden name.\n\nKassie DePaiva's (Blair) first CD, entitled Naked, includes songs penned by Patty Smyth, k.d. lang, Oleta Adams, and Janis Ian.\n\nThe working title for One Life to Live was \"Between Heaven and Hell.\" Ironically enough, the show has broached the heaven subject several times during its tenure and even went to hell once!\n\nDid you know that Robin Strasser's (Dorian) full name is Robin Victory In Europe Strasser?\n\nWhose last name was originally DiCrisoforo? That's Robin Christopher (ex-Skye). Her great-grandfather decided a change was in order when he set foot in the US from Southern Italy.\n\nFans of Aerosmith and OLTL take note! Jason-Shane Scott (ex-Will) appears in two of their videos - for \"Hole In My Soul\" and \"Falling In Love (Is Hard On The Knees)\".\n\nLinda Dano's (ex-Rae) never lies out of fear that it might come true. (Then I recommend lying \"up\" and making sure your lies are something you actually want to happen!)\n\nIn 1997, People magazine declared Kamar de los Reyes to be one of the world's 50 most beautiful people.\n\nWhile still living in Cuba as a child, David Fumero (ex-Cristian) held a special place in his heart for one chicken. Sadly his beloved pet became the main course one night and David decided to go hungry in mourning.\n\nActor Tommy Lee Jones (Men in Black, Double Jeopardy) once indulged in an illicit affair with none other than intern Dorian Lord (then played by Nancy Pinkerton) in the persona of Dr. Mark Toland.\n\nActors James and Kassie DePavia (Max and Blair) are active in the fundraising for advancement of medical breakthroughs to help deaf children hear again. Their son James Quentin has a hearing disability and underwent a cochlear implant operation.\n\nActor Gerald Anthony (Marco Dane) appeared on General Hospital as the same character for a few episodes.\n\nThe role of Todd Manning was intended to be a temporary bit part.\n\nThe set of Eternia, the underground city from the 80's, is the largest set ever constructed for a daytime drama.\n\nLinda Dano (ex-Rae) was the first actor in soap history to cross over to four different daytime dramas as the same character. She originated the character of Gretel Rae Cummings in 1978. The middle name of Rae is actually Linda’s – she suggested to the producers that Gretel go by Rae upon her return to Llanview.\n\nTodd Manning is not the only frat boy in Roger Howarth’s repertoire. He briefly played Kent on the defunct ABC soap Loving.\n\nRoger Howarth (ex-Todd) has several tattoos, which the make-up staff must camouflage. The same goes for Don Jeffcoat’s (ex-Joey) large dragon tattoo on his shoulder\n\nFive-time Emmy winner Erika Slezak is not the original Victoria Lord. She replaced Gillian Spencer, who held the role from the show’s inception to about a year later. Gillian would then go on to play Daisy on AMC and write scripts for OLTL, DOOL, AMC, ATWT and AW.\n\nWith her five Emmy wins, Erika is the most decorated actress in daytime.\n\nI hope you enjoyed the trivia on all three shows that has been provided this week and last.\n\nSee you next week!"
