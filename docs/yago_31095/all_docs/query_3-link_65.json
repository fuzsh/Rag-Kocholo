She served on the Town of Dickinson and School Election Boards for many years, was the President of the Missionary Society at the Dickinson Center Baptist Church where she also served as Church Clerk and taught Sunday school, volunteered at the St. Regis Falls Head start for several years, and served as the Town Historian.\n\nHer most favorite role was loving caregiver and supporter of family and friends.\n\nBetty is survived by her son, Laurence Wood and his wife Jeannie of Dickinson Center, daughter Diane Leslie and her fiancé Phil Ashley of Massena, daughter Cynthia Wood of Plattsburgh; 6 grandchildren: Nicole (Travis) Gillis, Tyler Leslie, Jacob (Brianah) Wood, Ian (Abby) Wood, Debbie Leslie, Trevor Cronce; great- granddaughter Rigby James Gillis; brother and sister-in-law, Bruce and Fran Marsh of Blounts Creek, NC.; sisters: Nancy Greguire, and Darlene (John) Langdon, both of Dickinson Center; and several nieces and nephews.\n\nAlways close to her heart is the memory of those who predeceased her. Besides her husband were brothers, L.
