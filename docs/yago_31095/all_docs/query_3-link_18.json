        "text": "Gloria J. Marsh was born in Greeley, Colorado on December 4, 1928. Gloria was the only child of Lola (Walter) and Alexander Kobobel. Gloria was a first generation American born of German immigrants.\n\nGloria met Allen, the love of her life, in 1953. Allen had returned from the Korean War and lived with his sister Sarah. Sarah asked her boyfriend named Gordon (later husband) to set up her big brother Allen on a blind date or she would not go out with Gordon. Gordon asked a pretty young lady in the secretary pool if she would go on a blind date with his brother-in-law to be, Allen. It was love at first sight. Two weeks later, Allen and Gloria were engaged. Allen and Gloria remained married for 63 years until Allen’s death.\n\nGloria was preceded in death by her daughter Carla Jo Marsh-Keller and her husband Allen E. Marsh.\n\nGloria is survived by her son Mark A. Marsh (Marta) of Carson City. Gloria also has four grandchildren Allen A. Avant, Eric Mark Allen Smith (Jennifer), Nikolaus Allen Marsh, and Christian C. Allen Marsh (Nycole). She also has two great-granddaughters: Natalie Jo Smith and Olivia Noel Smith.\n\nGloria gave our family the gift of compassion, the gift of love and the gift of a never ending hope in our future. Gloria had the kindest heart, loved her family unconditionally, and forgave our faults. My mother Gloria gave us so many gifts.\n\nA Memorial Service will be held at St. Paul’s Lutheran Family Church on Friday, July 14, 2017 at 11:00 a.m. in Carson City.\n\nFitzHenry’s Funeral Home in Carson City is in charge of arrangements."
