        "text": "Gloria Marlene (York) Ailor\n\nGloria Marlene (York) Ailor went to her eternal home to be with Jesus Christ, her Lord and Savior, on Monday, March 18, 2024.\n\nGloria was born in Kokomo, Indiana on January 18, 1939, to Marble F. and Flossie E. Cottingham. She graduated from Kokomo High School in 1956. On March 11, 1960, she married Roy Jackson York. Their love, respect, and friendship for each other lasted until Roy’s passing on September 13, 2001. During this time, they lovingly raised three children. In 1991 Gloria married James Ailor who preceded her in death in 2019.\n\nGloria was a hard worker, giving her all and at times working two jobs. When given a task she went above and beyond what was needed. For the majority of her life, she worked in the banking industry at First National Bank. She also worked at Johnson-Wert Title and Wal-Mart in the accounting office.\n\nGloria had energy, spunk, the need to help, a strong desire to be with people, and a good-natured, competitive spirit. Her love for Jesus, her family, and people endured to the very end. She found happiness in talking to, laughing with, and providing joy to others with her infectious smile. If you knew Gloria you knew happiness radiated from her; it would be common to hear her say, “I am good, my God takes care of me,” followed by her characteristic hugs or smile. Because of this need to be around others and to share the love she has for Jesus she chose to volunteer at various places.\n\nUpon retirement she volunteered at Community Howard as a runner, and she took this job literally, most could not keep up with her. She also worked as a volunteer in the Oncology department where she met and enjoyed working alongside an amazing team of caregivers; some of the same caregivers who would eventually become her care team. From that department, the family would like to thank Dr. Moore and her staff for the exceptional love, support, and care they provided from the beginning. She loved you all and her family appreciates each of you. The family would also like to thank the ER Department and second floor team of nurses at Community Howard for the care, compassion, and support you provided to the family during her final earthly days.\n\nIn addition to the hospital, Gloria volunteered at Abundant Life Church Kokomo where she enjoyed being a greeter, smiling and hugging everyone who walked through the door. Gloria was also drawn to the kitchen where she would help with Get-to-Know-You luncheons and funeral dinners. She especially enjoyed the clean up after. No mess went unnoticed. If there was laundry or dishes, you can bet they would be done earnestly and graciously.\n\nGloria also found delight in cooking for others; if you ever received one of her Sugar Cream Pies or Pecan Pies, you could taste the love. She would cook any food at any time when her family requested, it was never a burden, and always a joy for her--If her family was happy, she was happy.\n\nGloria is survived by three children: Randy (Amy) York, Defiance OH; Lisa (Brad) Moore, Kokomo, IN; Lanell (Ken) Thomas, Kokomo, IN. Seven grandchildren: Brandi (Jacob) Kinney; Joshua York; Brandon Pope; Stephanie York; Devin (Sarah) Pope; Trevor York; and Nathaniel Moore. Ten Great-Grandchildren: Ethan Vawter; Hannah Vawter; Abigail Vawter; Connor Pope; Gracie Sisneros; Haley Pope; Ava Pope; Ivy York; Kinley Pope; Lily York. Three stepchildren: James Ailor, Sharpsville, IN; Amy Reed, Indianapolis, IN; and Erin (Ray) Smith, Titusville, FL.\n\nGloria is survived by four siblings: Norma Wheeler, Lois Shuck, Betty Flook, and Paul Cottingham, and one sister-in-law, Linda Cottingham, as well as many nieces, nephews, and cousins. All loved her dearly, and they were dearly loved.\n\nGloria was preceded in death by two grandchildren whom she met for the first time in Heaven, six brothers, one sister and one stepdaughter.\n\nFuneral arrangements have been entrusted with Eller’s Mortuary and Cremation Center. There will be a time of visitation on Thursday, March 21, 2024, from 4:00 PM to 7:00 PM and from 10:00 AM to 11:00 AM Friday, March 22, 2024, with funeral service beginning at 11:00 AM. 3400 S Webster St, Kokomo, IN 46902\n\nIn lieu of flowers memorials can be made to St. Jude Children’s Hospital or Abundant Life Church.\n\nGloria will be laid to rest in Crown Point Cemetery, 1101 E Sycamore St, Kokomo, Indiana 46901-4918.\n\nElizabeth “Sheila” McKay\n\nElizabeth “Sheila” McKay, 84, of Kokomo, passed away at 11:02 p.m. on Sunday, March 17, 2024, at Community Howard Regional Health. She was born March 26, 1939, in Corpus Christi, Texas, to Melquides H. and Felipa (Faz) Diaz, and grew up in Lansing, Michigan.\n\nSheila graduated from J.W. Sexton High School, in Lansing, Michigan, in 1958, and attended college at Pasadena Community College. She worked at Delco Electronics/GM for 30 years before retiring in 2002. Sheila was an avid fan of the Kokomo Wildkats and Kokomo Bobkats and had missed only a handful of Wildkats basketball games in the past 40 years. She was also very patriotic and enjoyed working the voting polls each year. Some of her favorite pastimes were going to Beef & Boards, traveling, and watching her grandkids play sports and cheerlead. She was a member of First Assembly of God, now known as Reach Church, since 1982, where she enjoyed serving in the children’s ministry, and was also a member of the Delco Retiree Hobby Club, UAW Card Club, and UAW Local 292.\n\nSurvivors include her daughters, Caroline (David) Jewell and Michelle (David) Goehst; grandchildren, Kevin (Courtney) Jewell, Allyson (Joseph) Parker, Jordan Best, and Cody Best; great-grandchildren, Michael Jewell, Andrew Parker, Jacob Parker, Gannon Best, Milayna Best, and Hudson Best; sisters, Abi (Wayne) Ames and Dinah Diaz; brother-in-law, Scott Miller; several nieces and nephews; and many, many close friends.\n\nShe was preceded in death by her parents; siblings, Elias “Bill” Diaz, Anna Handley, Ida Miller, and Marylou Diaz; three nephews and a niece.\n\nFuneral services will be held at 12 p.m. on Saturday, March 23, 2024, at Shirley & Stout Funeral Home, 1315 W. Lincoln Rd., Kokomo, with Pastor Mark Malin officiating. Entombment will follow in Sunset Memory Garden Cemetery. Friends are invited to visit with the family from 10 to 12 p.m. on Saturday at the funeral home. Sheila would enjoy it if you wanted to come Saturday in your Wildkats or Bobkats shirt. Contributions may be made in Sheila’s memory to the Kokomo Athletics Department. Messages of condolence may be left online at www.shirleyandstout.com.\n\nSue Ellen Spence\n\nSue Ellen Spence was born on August 12, 1947, the first child of Harold Nathan and Wilma Bernice (Bullock) Smith near Galveston, Indiana. Later, her sister, Carol (Shoaff) and brother Craig were born, completing the family. Growing up on the farm, she loved the country, animals, and hard work. She graduated from Lewis Cass High School in 1965 and Ball State University in 1969 with a degree in teaching. After teaching Home Economics at Lewis Cass one year, she married Kent Spence on November 21, 1970, in the First Baptist Church of Bunker Hill, Indiana. Following the wedding, Sue moved to Bamberg, Germany, with her husband, where he was stationed in the U.S. Army.\n\nIn September 1971 Sue and her husband moved to Okmulgee, Oklahoma, where his job awaited. She made friends and memories there, but the best thing that happened to her was the birth of her daughter, Janna Renee (Lynas). In 1973 a job transfer moved them to Mt Zion, Illinois. Soon after the move, she gave birth to her first son, Evan Scott. She dedicated herself to her highest priority, caring for two toddlers, while forming a friendship that would last a lifetime. In 1976 her second son arrived, Aaron Christopher, and life got even more interesting – and busy.\n\nIn 1977 Sue and her husband decided to return home to Cass County, Indiana. Settling near Grissom Air Base, Sue focused on what she loved - raising her three children, working in her garden, cooking delicious meals from scratch, and making the best home for the family that God had given her. And when the family needed it, she taught in the Title 1 program at Maconaquah Elementary, helping other children. During the 42 years she lived in that home, she blessed the marriages of Janna to Derek Lynas, Evan to Karina Sawaguchi, and Aaron to Melinda Smith. She was blessed with grandchildren Amelia, Hope, Mac, and Mesfin (Lynas), Rebecca and Jacob (Spence) and Cleo (Bellaw). Sue loved family times with all her family near her, and especially one-on-one times with grandchildren.\n\nApplying her gifts of teaching and cooking, she taught for years in children’s Sunday School, Junior Church, Toddlers, and helped with many funeral dinners at church. She also worked with girls as a 4-H leader at one time. She sought a place where God could use her and gave her best.\n\nWith a bird book always close-by, Sue loved to watch and identify local birds. She also loved quilts, and with determination and patience, finished one her mother had started years before. That was her last big project.\n\nDiagnosed with a progressive neurological disease in 2018, Sue and her husband moved to Noblesville in 2020, to downsize, live on one level, and be near family. On March 16, 2024, Sue passed into Jesus’ arms and experienced the best day of her life, with an eternity of them to come. We will miss her for now – her sense of humor, her counsel, her common sense - but we won’t forget the blessing of being loved by her.\n\nPrivate family services and burial will take place at a later date.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, memorial contributions may be made to Bible Baptist Church, 2635 S. Dixon Rd., Kokomo, IN 46902 in Sue's memory.\n\nJeanne Roselle Cooper\n\nJeanne Roselle Cooper, age 95, of Greentown, Indiana passed away on Monday, March 18, 2024.\n\nServices will remain private.\n\nFloyd “Buck” Lee Griffin\n\nFloyd “Buck” Lee Griffin, 79, of Kokomo, passed away at 6:03 am on Monday, March 18, 2024, at his home. He was born on January 28, 1945, in Marion, the son of the late Glen and Hilda (Hasty) Griffin. Buck married Carolyn Montgomery, and she survives.\n\nBuck retired from Marsh after 48 years working his way up to manager from a stock boy. He enjoyed playing lottery tickets, golfing, boating, fishing at Shamrock Lakes, and IU basketball. Buck cherished spending time with his family, and split time with his sister at the family cottage on Little Chapman for 15 years. He loved going to the casinos on Wednesday and was a perfectionist when it came to yardwork. Buck was an active member for 10 years in the Masonic Lodge.\n\nAlong with his wife, Carolyn, Buck is survived by his daughter, Shelley Kemp; grandchildren, Daniel (Kristine) Griffin, Eric (Jessica) Griffin, and Kayla (Andrew) Tavares; great-grandchildren, Griffin Tavares, Gavin Tavares, Ganon Tavares, Gage Tavares, Bella Griffin, E.J. Griffin, Maddison Griffin, Mason Griffin, and Braiden Griffin; siblings, Joanne Riggs, Phyllis Persinger, and Mary Lou James; and several nieces, nephews, and in-laws.\n\nBuck was preceded in death by his parents, son, Jeff Griffin; son-in-law, Ron Kemp; siblings, Jean Mullinex, and Doris Scott, and one brother-in-law."
