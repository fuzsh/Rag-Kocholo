        "text": "Kathleen Janet Marsh passed from her earthly life to her eternal life of peace on March 23, 2020 at Stilwell Nursing Home.\n\nShe was born on December 25, 1929. She was 90 years of age.\n\nKathleen attended Berryhill School, Berryhill, OK. After leaving school, she began working as a nurse’s aide in Tulsa, OK.\n\nShe was preceded in death by her parents, Samuel W. Maxwell and Marzena (Hollan) Maxwell, her husband of 38 years; Billy Joe (Bill) Marsh, son, Kenneth Roy (Kenny) Marsh, daughter, Wanda Jean Brown; brothers: James N. (Jimmy) Maxwell and his wife Lowee (Gibson) Maxwell, Carl Maxwell and Sam Junior (Slim) Maxwell and a brother who died at 2 years of age.\n\nKathleen and Bill met when he was a patient at the hospital while she was working. He started asking her to date him and after 2 months they went on their first date. Two years later, they were married. Their lives together were blessed with the births of three children: Karen, Kenny, and Wanda.\n\nShe is survived by her daughter, Karen Rene’ Hooper and husband AJ of Stilwell, OK, sister-in-law, Sue Maxwell and husband Carl of Gurdon, AR, 7 grandchildren: Kevin Hooper and wife Tammy of Westville, OK, Jerry Hooper and wife Anesa of Park Hill, OK, Melissa Carlson and husband Dennis of Marion, IA, Christopher Marsh of Tulsa, OK, David Choate and wife Jennifer of Tulsa, Jeremy Marsh of Tulsa, Billy Marsh of Tulsa, great grandchildren: Sydney (Hooper) Kimble and husband Matt, Kelsey Hooper, Kade Hooper, Koby Hooper, Jenna Hooper, Gloria Marsh, Victoria Marsh, great-great grandchildren: Navaeh, Ameera, Heaven and Camron. She is also survived by numerous cousins, nieces, nephews, friends and her very special fur baby, Chi-Chi, her chihuahua.\n\nKathleen was always telling people “Me & God got a good thing going.”\n\nShe always wanted to share the many times God healed her and brought her back from near death. She also had a few other favorite sayings that she kept hanging on the wall in her room.\n\n“Everyone’s entitled to my opinion” and “Don’t ruffle my feathers.” It was well known by her close family and friends; she was known for speaking her mind. She was always ready for an adventure. She loved to fish, garden, visit with friends and going out to eat. When her health began to limit her activities, she began embroidery and made many, many tea towels, and pillowcases as lasting treasures. She also enjoyed playing bingo at the nursing home. When Kathleen retired from St. Francis Hospital after 16 years, she fulfilled her life goal of moving to Lake Tenkiller, Cookson, OK. She attended church faithfully at Cookson Baptist Church and then Cookson Methodist Church. When she moved closer to Stilwell, OK, she attended church faithfully with her daughter, Karen, at Christian Worship Center, as long as her health permitted. She later looked forward to CWC’s monthly meetings at the nursing home. Everywhere Kathleen went, she made friends. There are many special friendships that she treasured; Jody Robertson, Quilita Quinton, Mary Burgess, Wilma Means, Jewell Hummingbird, Jane Eubanks and Mary Stilwell are just a few.\n\nKathleen will be remembered as enjoying life and will be greatly missed by all who knew and loved her."
