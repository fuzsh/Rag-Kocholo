        "text": "HARVEY, Gloria (nee Marsh)\n\n1928 - 2022\n\nWith heavy hearts we announce the passing of our mother Gloria on November 24, 2022, at the age of 94. Every day was a gift. Born and raised in the village of King's Somborne, England, she married Raymond Harvey of Dundee Scotland. They emigrated to Canada in 1948, settled in St. Clair Beach, later Riverside, to raise their family. Predeceased by her parents Ina and Charles Marsh, husband Raymond (1976), partner John Welsh (2015), sister Ina (2022). Survived by sister Elizabeth in England as well as nieces and nephews. Treasured mother to Elizabeth (Richard), Paul (Suzanne), and lan (Cheryl). Loving 'gran' to Stephen (Laura), Brandon (Helen), Lisa (Christopher), Clifford (Michelle), Brian (Jennifer), extended family Mary (Darryl) and Jon. Gloria cherished her 11 great-grandchildren and was anticipating the imminent arrival of her first great-great-grandchild. Gloria retired from the Continuing Education Dept. of St. Clair College in 1993. She was a talented seamstress, gardener, artist - known for her beautiful needlework, hand knit sweaters, blankets, oil and watercolour paintings. Gloria loved tending her hybrid roses and English garden, being in the company of friends, family, or her beloved cats. In bygone years she loved sailing on Lake St. Clair. She was devoted to her family, and nothing made her prouder than their accomplishments. Gloria had a soft voice, beautiful smile, a sweet disposition, and an endearing sense of humour. The void left in our hearts by her passing will never be filled. Special thanks to staff at Southgate Retirement Home, Royal Oak Chartwell LTC, in Kingsville, and recently Erie Shores Hospital and Erie Shores Hospice in Leamington for their compassion and attentive care. Special thanks to Jean Pontich and Janet Baltzer for their assistance and kindness. Cremation has taken place. A private family service and celebration of life will be held at a later date. Arrangements entrusted to Victoria Greenlawn Funeral Home. Online condolences may be shared at . In lieu of flowers, donations in memory of Gloria to The Hospice of Windsor and Essex County Inc. would be appreciated."
