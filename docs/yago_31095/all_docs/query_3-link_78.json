        "text": "Helen E. Marsh, 88, Dickinson, died Sunday, February 18, 2018 at St. Benedict’s Health Center, Dickinson. Helen’s Mass of Christian Burial will be at 10 a.m., Friday, February 23, 2018 at St. Wenceslaus Catholic Church, Dickinson, with Fr. Jordan Dosch as the celebrant. Interment will follow at the North Dakota Veterans Cemetery, Mandan. Visitation will be Thursday, from 3 p.m. to 6 p.m. at Ladbury Funeral Service with a rosary and vigil at 6 p.m. with Deacon Bob Zent presiding. Visitation will continue one hour prior to services at the church.\n\nHelen Magelky was born August 16, 1929 in Dickinson, the second of four daughters to Peter and Anna (Bernhardt) Magelky. They lived on a farm north of Taylor until 1944 when the family moved to Dickinson. Helen graduated from Dickinson High School in 1948.\n\nHelen married Silvan “Sam” A. Marsh on April 10, 1951, at Camp Rucker, Alabama. Silvan was on active duty as a member of the North Dakota National Guard, 164th Infantry Division and this is where Helen learned to play bridge, and developed a life-long love of the game.\n\nHelen worked at many places over her career: MDU, Liberty Bank, Stevenson’s clothing store, The Fad and finally retiring from Blue Cross and Blue Shield in June of 1995. She was a member of the Dickinson Elk’s, NARFE and a lifetime member of Catholic Daughters and St. Ann’s Altar Society. She had many interests and hobbies including shopping, playing bridge, reading, traveling, visiting friends, family and the casino. Most of all, she loved spending time with her grandson, Brian. Until her health declined, they were Saturday night Mass and dinner buddies.\n\nHelen loved the Lord, her family and friends and will be deeply missed. Even through her declining health, she was a fighter with an optimist attitude. We are deeply indebted to her caregivers on Unit 3 at St. Benedict’s. She loved you all and looked forward to seeing each of you every day.\n\nHelen is survived by her daughter and son-in-law, Sue (Arnie) Kopp, one grandson, Brian Kopp, Dickinson; one sister, Alice Paulson, Colorado Springs, Colo.; numerous nieces and nephews; and special friends Eleanor Weber and RoseMary Vranna, Dickinson.\n\nShe was preceded in death by her husband, Sam, on December 21, 2000; her parents; two sisters, Mildred Hoff and Elsie Monson; and niece, Gloria Schmidt.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, the family prefers memorials to The God’s Child Project, Bismarck or St. Benedict’s Health Care Foundation, Dickinson."
