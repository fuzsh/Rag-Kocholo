MAJOR SPOILER alert - If you don't want to know the name of person poisoning Palmer, DON'T READ THIS SYNOPSIS.\n\nIn 1991, someone was drugging Palmer Cortlandt. Was Opal the culprit? She was practically forcing the poisoned health drink down her husband's throat. And to make matters worse, a vial of drugs fell out of her coat! Was it Will Cortlandt, the nephew seeking an easy road to the top of the Cortlandt corporate ladder? It turned out that Palmer's right-hand man, Stan Ulitowski was the guilty party who was seeking revenge because Palmer stole his would be 'fiancee' Opal, away from him. Stan eluded capture when, trapped in a plane by Officers' Derek Frye and Mimi Reed, he jumped out the door. \"Mr. U's\" body was never recovered.\n\nMeanwhile, all-American Craig Lawson came to town claiming to be a friend of Tad's. Craig was a source of strength for Dixie, but butted heads with her brother Will who saw him as an opportunist. Palmer sided with Craig and fired Will!\n\nMeanwhile, Craig eloped with Dixie, and his plan to bilk the rich widow derailed when his former fiancee, Gloria Marsh, took a job at Pine Valley Hospital. She caught wind of her old frame's scheme, and blackmailed him into resuming their old affair. As the year wore on, Jackson Montgomery grew more impatient with Erica's ongoing sham marriage to Travis. Jack's fury reached a peak when Bianca innocently blurted out that her mommy and daddy were sleeping in the same bed. Later, when Travis caught Erica and Jack in bed together, the arrangement with Erica was over.\n\n''My wife... and my brother!\" Travis bitterly exclaimed, taking in the sight of the bedded lovers. There was no explaining; Travis wanted sole custody of Bianca. During the hearing, Erica begged Jack to testify that they were not having an ongoing affair. She wanted him to lie. Jack could not do it. Dumped by Erica for simply telling the truth, Jack took up with Brooke, who always seemed to feast on Erica's leftovers. By now, Brooke had given birth to Jamie, her son by Tad. Brooke nearly lost the child in a violent collision with a car driven by alcoholic Arlene Vaughan and her passenger, Hayley.\n\nAfter a bitter custody battle, Erica lost her precious Bianca to Travis, who took their daughter away to his new home in Seattle. In time, Travis married Barbara, who gave birth to their new daughter, whose bone marrow saved the life of little Molly.\n\nIn defeat, Erica turned her attentions to Charlie Brent. Charlie's grandfather, Nick, arrived in town in an attempt to sway Erica before she took the marital plunge with the much-younger Charlie. Nick's words hit home. Erica called off the wedding and gave Charlie a gentle send-off. Joey Martin's marriage disintegrated when his bride, Emily Ann, went insane and in her demented jealousy, tried to kill Mary and Dan's sweet Katie Kennicott, who had only recently arrived in Pine Valley.\n\nDetermined to keep gold-digging Ceara Connor from marrying his son David, Jeremy seduced Ceara, but fell in love with her. David was incensed to discover his father's scheme, but came to accept Ceara and Jeremy's love. In time, David found his way back to Lanie, and they married before leaving Pine Valley. Jeremy helped Ceara come to grips with the fact that she had been an abused child, and on New Years Eve, one year to the day after their first, loveless kiss, Jeremy and Ceara married.\n\nLeave it to Adam to come up with a scheme to win back Erica. Having divorced Natalie, and realizing that he had lost Brooke, thoughts of his 1984 marriage to Erica began haunting Adam. He wanted her back and told her the shocking truth.\n\nWe were never divorced, my dear.\" Horrified, Erica listened as Adam explained how he had sent Stuart to impersonate him to get their quickie Caribbean divorce all those years ago. To keep the scandal quiet, Erica had no choice but to publicly marry Adam again. But in a masterful maneuver, Erica hired a phony minister to preside at their uncivil ceremony. Leave it to Erica to out-Adam Adam.\n\nSporting a mane of jet-black hair, spiked bangs and a pugnacious personality, Hayley Vaughan blew into Pine Valley like a hurricane! Having run away from her alcoholic mother, Arlene, Hayley came to town to live with her Uncle Trevor. On a mission to Pine Valley to drag her daughter back to Chicago, Arlene Dillon Vaughan was shocked to encounter Adam Chandler, her long-ago lover and Hayley's real father.\n\nThe news came as quite a shock to the resentful Hayley, who had always believed that the recently deceased Harry Vaughan was her father. Incensed as first, Hayley came to love her newfound daddy. Soon, Hayley met sweet, straight arrow, Brian Bodine.\n\nIn 1991, Natalie's downright weird sister, Janet Green, arrived in town. Janet set out to seduce Trevor, failing miserably at every try. Not about to let Natalie win out again, Janet transformed herself from ugly and fat into a clone of her glamorous sister. Perfecting a perfect imitation of Natalie, Janet set her plan into motion. Throwing Natalie into a well on the grounds of Dimitri Marick's sprawling estate, Janet stole Natalie's life -- and her fiance, Trevor Dillon.\n\nAs the real Natalie languished in her dark and dank prison, Janet married Trevor, and finally found her way into his bed. Weeks passed, and handsome Dimitri Marick rescued Natalie. Only when he took her back to his mansion, Wildwind, and nursed her through her horrible bouts with claustrophobia and nightmares, did it finally dawn on Natalie that she was free! Janet's masquerade came to end, but not before, she crazily kidnapped Hayley and shot young Brian."
