        "text": "The name of Gloria Marsh is known throughout Swanage.\n\nA life president of the town’s RNLI, a councillor, a school governor and so much more – Mrs Marsh did everything in her power to make the coastal town a better place for all.\n\nGloria Marsh was born in Swindon in 1936. At a young age, she moved to Branksome with her parents and sister before moving on to Swanage where her relatives ran the Railway Hotel.\n\nAs a student, Gloria was a keen county hurdler and ballet dancer who thoroughly enjoyed playing her part in local variety shows. It’s no wonder she ended up catching the eye of a “local lad” named Vic.\n\nGloria met Vic Marsh in Swanage and they were married soon after in 1954. The couple had five children – Michael, Ian, Karina, Belinda and Rebecca.\n\nBefore turning her attention to local government, Gloria worked in the town’s hospitality trade first as a cook, then a housekeeper, before she and Vic ran the Quay Cafe on the Parade.\n\nHer husband Vic eventually joined the Swanage Lifeboat Crew as a Coxswain Mechanic and would stay associated with the station for a total of 36 years. According to their daughter Karina, Gloria “wholeheartedly supported him in this. She would ring the crew to muster at the station (before pagers) whilst Vic fired the maroons\".\n\nGloria would often be at the boathouse, keeping the troops happy by making tea and bacon sandwiches as well as her famous bread pudding. Gloria herself then joined the lifeboat supporters' guild, selling souvenirs from the boathouse and at fundraising events.\n\nYears later, Gloria was honoured to be made life president of Swanage RNLI.\n\nA Swanage Lifeboat Station spokesperson said: “It was remarked in many of the rescue write-ups that Gloria would be at the station to provide refreshments for the crew when they arrived back from rescues, often in the early hours of the morning.\n\n“Gloria’s son-in-law Martin Steeden was also a former coxswain of the Swanage lifeboat, serving over 40 years on the crew, and her grandsons Gavin and Matt serve on the crew today.\n\n“After the passing of Victor, Gloria continued her strong affiliation with the RNLI and was elected President of the Swanage RNLI in 2009, a role she held to the present day.”\n\nShe went on to be a Swanage town councillor and was elected mayor during this time. She later added roles on Purbeck Council, Weymouth Port Health Authority, and as chairman of the Purbeck Task Group to her impressive portfolio.\n\nShe was also a governor of Swanage First School, an elder of Swanage United Reformed Church, president of the Ladies Guild and carried out many more public duties.\n\nGloria’s professional life culminated in 2013 when she was awarded an MBE in the Queen’s Birthday Honours for her work in the environment and for services to local government.\n\nSpeaking at the time, Gloria said: “It’s been very exciting. I was extremely proud when I first got the letter.\n\n“It’s been a great honour to be able to work for the people of Swanage and Purbeck.”\n\nHaving served tirelessly for almost 30 years, Gloria retired from council work and was proud to be awarded the style rank and title of Honoured Citizen of Swanage.\n\nGloria died peacefully in Poole Hospital on Saturday October 23. She was 85 years old.\n\nDaughter Karina said: “Mum promoted the town she loved at every opportunity. She was a loving and caring mum, very proud of all her children, grandchildren and great grandchildren.\n\n“She loved time spent with her family and we have many precious memories of her.”\n\nGloria is survived by her sister Avris, her two sons and three daughters, grandchildren, and great grandchildren.\n\nHer funeral will be held on Monday, November 15 at Swanage United Reformed Church with committal at Godlingston Cemetery."
