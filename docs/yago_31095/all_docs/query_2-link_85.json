        "text": "Making Hay While the Sun Shines\n\nSteve continued to work at his father’s side throughout his school years, and although Noble didn’t believe in paying his son, he did give Steve the tools to earn his own money. Noble taught Steve how to bid on cattle, which started a decades-long business of purchasing spring calves, fattening them up and re-selling them for profit. Noble also provided Steve with his first baling equipment, which Steve, together with cousins Mike and Marz used to create their own after-school, hay baling business. By the time he was in high school Steve had earned enough money from his various before and after school farming ventures to buy a 1965 Corvette Stingray. As he neared graduation, it was clear that he was different than most kids his age; Steve already knew what it was to have his own business and make his own money, he knew he did not want to go to college. Most importantly, Steve knew the future was his to make.\n\nConcerned that farming was being phased out in Sonoma Valley in favor of rapid development, Noble encouraged his son to pursue a career in construction. Steve respected his father’s advice, and while he was not prepared to give up his various farming endeavors, he did agree to pursue a “day job” in the building industry. After two years apprenticing with Frontier Electric he took a job taping drywall for Associated Specialties. Like his grandfather Barker, Steve’s big break came when he seized an opportunity to impress his employers with his initiative. The year was 1973, Steve was assisting a drywall journeyman named Denny Roper, who had convinced their boss that the relatively inexperienced Steve could cover his workload while he went on vacation. On the first day of Denny’s vacation, Steve was presented with a job list double Denny’s usual output. Never one to back away from a challenge, Steve worked day and night managed to finish all the houses. Needless to say, he had made an impression.\n\nUnfortunately the result of his zeal was an offer to take over Denny’s position. Only 21 years old, married since right after high school to Michele and already the father of four-year-old Mike and one-year-old Tonja, Steve was tempted by the promotion and raise–but not at the expense of his friend Denny.\n\nNo Guts, No Glory\n\nTogether, Steve and Denny left Associated Specialties to start their own business, Northwestern Drywall, using Denny’s state license. Their first break came almost immediately when Oakmont Properties, a former client of Associated Specialties who knew the quality of Steve’s work, hired them for a new housing development. Timing was on their side, the housing boom was in full swing and within two years Steve had 100 employees and had opened a second non-union branch to handle public works and government contracts. Steve hired his sister Nancy’s husband John Salerno to run the new operation, which was named Northeastern Drywall, in recognition of John’s east coast roots. In addition, Steve maintained his daily involvement in the ranches he worked with Noble, rising at 4 am each day to log a couple of hours before heading off to the job site.\n\nIn 1975 a local contractor named Wayne Elzey came to Steve with an offer that would catapult Ledson from contractor to developer. Elzey had pre-sold a number of homes, but did not have the capital to build them. Between his ongoing cattle, hay, and contracting businesses, Steve had the money to invest and together they became Elzey and Ledson Construction. Those initial houses led to subdivisions and before long the two had projects scattered from the Bay Area to the Oregon border.\n\nBut once again it was the Ledson family tradition for tackling the impossible that marked Steve’s greatest construction success. It was the late seventies and a 76-house development in Covelo, Ca. had come to a screeching halt after only 20 homes had been framed – the drywall contractor had been fired for poor work and a severe dry-wall shortage prevented anyone from being able to finish the job on schedule. Steve knew he could find the drywall and complete the job on time but felt that with everything else on his plate – by now he had purchased and was farming over 2,500 acres in Mendocino–the project was too big. He submitted a bid for an amount that would make it worth his while and assumed it would be too high to be accepted. But the developers were up against a deadline and they had no choice but to award the project to the only person who could pull it off. It was a huge financial boon, and was followed by a series of successful gambles that provided both partners with the financial capital to pursue their separate endeavors.\n\nBuilding the Family Business\n\nIn 1977 Ledson Construction was born. By this time Steve’s two children were just starting school and his wife Michele, who had been managing the books for Steve, was able to devote more time to the business; taking an active role designing the interiors for new Ledson projects. Steve, together with his father Noble and son Mike continued to manage and work their various family ranches and farms. His sister Nancy and her family lived nearby as did his uncles Whitby and Winslow and numerous cousins. Most importantly Steve was in a position to do what his grandfather Barker had done so many years before, share his success by creating jobs for an ever-increasing number of family members. Steve gave Northeastern Drywall to brother in law John Salerno and brought his cousin Leonard (Whitby’s son) down from Oregon to run Northwestern Drywall where both his son Mike and nephew Andy were also employed.\n\nBy the late 1980s Steve Ledson was financially secure, professionally respected, and surrounded by family, including newest member, daughter Kristina, born in 1987. Only in his thirties, he had achieved more than most, but not as much as he wanted. Although he had never given up his various agrarian pursuits, over the years, working the land had taken a backseat to building houses. It was time to change focus: to follow his passion and restore the family’s farming business. In particular, Steve wanted to grow grapes, something his great grandfather, his father, and his uncle before him had done. As usual, the opportunity presented itself at just the right time.\n\nThe Castle Becomes a Club House\n\nPerhaps the best example of Steve’s commitment to building the Ledson “family” is the winery’s Wine Club, or more accurately–wine clubs–as there are now nine different clubs to choose from, catering to the wide range of tastes and price point preferences of the over 15,000 members and over 50,000 customers who buy every year.\n\nContrary to most wineries, Ledson sells 100% of their wines direct to customers – no middlemen, no brokers. Typically wineries consider this type of “hand selling” too time consuming and resource intensive, but for Steve it’s the personal interaction and feedback that energizes him. He thrives on the enthusiasm his customers have for wine, both his and others, and enjoys creating the opportunities–whether winery events or informal get-togethers–to hear back from his customers. For a small town boy who came of age in an era when your customers were your friends, it’s simply the only way Steve can imagine doing business.\n\nIn fact, it was Steve’s enthusiasm for doing whatever it takes to make a customer happy that led to the original Ledson Wine Club. The year was 1997, and wine lovers Jan and Dave Holcomb were visiting Sonoma Valley from their home in Denver, Colorado. While driving along Highway 12, they passed a beautiful castle under construction and noticed a sign out front reading “wine tasting”. They drove through the gate and noted that the construction crews were still at work so they pulled up to a double-wide portable building. Inside they met Michael Ledson, who told them that the castle had originally been intended as his dad’s home, but was being converted into the winery’s tasting room. After being poured Ledson’s ’95 Estate Merlot, Jan asked if there was a wine club they could join. Michael said he didn’t think so and called Steve, who enthusiastically replied, “No, but start one!” That’s how Jan and Dave Holcomb became Ledson Winery’s first wine club members, and they’re still members today. More importantly they’re great friends of Steve’s, as are many in the wine club, sharing family vacations, visiting each other’s homes and routinely getting together over dinner to taste the newest wine releases.\n\nIt was over a new release that Steve met another of Ledson’s long time wine club members, Tom Birt. The two became fast friends after finding themselves in a debate over the merits of the 2001 vintage versus 2002 vintage of Ledson Ancient Vines Zinfandel at one of the winery’s barrel tastings. Steve appreciated Tom’s palate and thirst for wine knowledge and Tom was drawn in by what he describes as “a dynamic force of nature with an infectious passion for wine, friends and fun”. Like many who become part of the Ledson Wine Club, Tom has invited his friends to join as well. Unlike most, however, Tom seems to have an endless supply of friends, personally adding more than 100 new members to the club in just six years! Tom has been working weekends with Steve for the last five years and uses his vacations to assist with every harvest.\n\nFor Steve, having a family winery means more than building a winery for his family; it also means building a family for his winery – and between friends, employees and Wine Club members, he has done just that."
