        "text": "Success! Freedom! Fulfillment! That is my life. I am Alger Marsh. I was married for 58 years to my heart’s delight, Gloria. Our marriage got better every year! We used the tools we learned in life, and planed to continue learning more ways to grow our relationship. Instead, on October 7, 2023, our loving Father escorted her to heaven. It was very sudden and unexpected. So she did not have much pain to deal with before entering heaven’s gates. God answered the prayers of many for me as he carried me, like the poem Footprints in the Sand describes. His joy and peace mingled with my times of tears in a beautiful way. Now that I am past that mourning time, I miss her, but mourning is not part of the equation.\n\nOne of our workshops, HeartsTogether, is specifically aimed at helping others learn to use the tools we used in their marriages. Of course, many of the tools can be applied to other relationships, too. It is a joy to see other people begin to use these tools. I believe that as my relationship with God improves, He helps me have a better self-image as well as become a better friend.\n\nI spent three years as a Manager for Safeway’s 440 stores in the Oregon district doing purchasing and quality control for the egg department. Following that, I had three years as a church’s Youth Pastor and Christian Education Director. Eleven years with Wycliffe Bible Translators was next, eight of those years in Papua New Guinea. Gloria and I formed House of Myrrh Ministries in 1985. We learned many tools that helped provide the victories I now experience with the people in my life.\n\nSome activities I have greatly enjoyed include sky diving, hang gliding, flying in an airplane glider, scuba diving, riding horses, solving Sudoku puzzles and driving around the countryside. I also enjoy reading a variety of categories of literature. I plan to continue enjoying a life of adventure along with fulfilling relationships as I assist many people gain an exciting, rewarding life.\n\nI have found that a balanced combination of sleep, nutrition and exercise bring about health and energy. I don’t use alarm clocks or other mechanisms to awaken me; instead, I allow my body to bring me awake when it is satisfied with the rest and refreshment it needs. I have searched for and found nutrients that lengthen my telomeres, increase my resistance to common diseases, and promote energy. PraiseMoves.com provides an excellent pattern of exercise to keep me agile and fit.\n\nMy greatest joys, however, have come from being able to participate in bringing people into life-changing freedom and victory in their lives. The Heart Workshops (listed at www.heartchange.org), include scores of tools such as HeartRecovery, the Five R’s (Repent, Receive, Release, Renounce and Replace) and proxy, that have been used by God to restore hope, bring freedom from fear and instill confidence resulting in victorious living for many of the participants and staff of those workshops. A special treat is when someone who has believed they have nothing to offer to help other people have become ecstatic when God uses them powerfully as they connect others to God and enable them to gain freedom and peace through the processes of the workshops.\n\nI plan to continue working with HOMM. Other people have learned to do what we have set up. At this time, I believe God is leading me to launch a fourth department for HOMM. It will be a training center. Camp Aijalon (see Joshua 10:12-13) is to be a place of many miracles! I look forward to seeing what God will do next.\n\nJoin me in pursuing goals of being healthy, benefiting mankind and preparing for eternity while thoroughly enjoying this life."
