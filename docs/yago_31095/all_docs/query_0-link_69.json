        "text": "Scott Ritter was a US intelligence officer, and then a UN weapons inspector. Scott correctly identified that Saddam Hussein did not have weapons of mass destruction, before the illegal US invasion of Iraq whose justification was based purely on this incorrect fabricated premise that Saddam did have weapons of mass destruction.\n\nScott gives an excellent anaysis of the current Ukraine situation and geopolitics surrounding it. No doubt wikipedia will soon be amending their propaganda to call him a conspiracy theorist… [3]\n\nMy only criticism would be that his analysis is done on the basis of countries rather than from the higher standpoint of the puppetmasters pulling the strings behind the scenes.\n\nOn the basis of country analysis then the suicide of the US and western financial system makes no sense, whereas it does if it is a satanic globalist takedown of the system, a new world order to be rebuilt from the chaos by the satanic phoenix after a significant depopulation.\n\nHowever on the basis on traditional geopolitical analysis Scott Ritter does an admirable takedown of the myths and propaganda that the West likes to promulgate and gives a fair assessment of the situation in Ukraine.\n\nThe video below is a bitchute video, which will open in a new tab.

Biden Crime Family https://foxyfox.substack.com/p/biden-crime-family?s=w\n\nTranscript\n\n0:00an american regiment you know and the point i’m trying to make is you know war is a bloody vicious thing\n\n0:08and when you fight a competent military competent militaries tend to perform competently and what i mean by that is\n\n0:14you’ve given the opportunity to beat you up they’re going to beat you up no one should ever think for a second\n\n0:20that the ukrainian military is not one of the most competent militaries in the world today i mean they’ve been since\n\n0:272015 they’ve been on the receiving end of billions of dollars of nato training\n\n0:33and equipment um this isn’t you know your your old soviet style conscript military this is\n\n0:39a military that is trained to nato standards meaning that a ukrainian battalion that has been trained by nato\n\n0:46is interoperable with nato you can literally plug out you know a german\n\n0:52plug in a ukrainian battalion and they should be able to operate uh with with everybody else these are highly skilled\n\n0:59people well-equipped well-led and well-motivated\n\n1:04uh they’re a formidable force and there’s a lot of them um you know there there’s two hundred\n\n1:10and 000 regular forces uh there’s another\n\n1:16310 000 reserves um plus then you have the intelligence forces the border guards and other\n\n1:22security forces you’re looking around 600 000 well-armed well-led highly motivated\n\n1:30competent ukrainian defenders now in in war um you know this is just standard\n\n1:37military math uh the people going on the offense want to have a three to one advantage at\n\n1:43least you’d like to have four you’d like to have five but at a minimum you don’t even consider initiating offensive\n\n1:48operations unless you have a three to one advantage now if you’re going up against six hundred thousand ukrainians\n\n1:55that means you need one million eight hundred thousand men before you could even think about beginning\n\n2:01offensive operations the russians are coming in with around two hundred thousand basically they flip the flip the grid on\n\n2:08this one they’re coming in with a three to one disadvantage which no sane person would ever\n\n2:13recommend when it comes to offensive operations because most of the time when we’re thinking offensive operations\n\n2:18we’re thinking about the conquering of territory the seizing of ground\n\n2:25but russia made it clear from the beginning they are not there to occupy ukraine\n\n2:31they’re there to accomplish two things one denotification\n\n2:36that means they’re going to hunt down and they’re going to destroy every azov or azov like unit in ukrainian military\n\n2:42there will be no mercy shown and no mercy is being shown two is the demilitarization what they\n\n2:48mean by that is because ukraine opted to become a proxy of nato even though they’re not a nato member their military\n\n2:55behaves as as if it is a nato member it acts as a nato member it trains with\n\n3:01nato it deploys with nato so it’s you know everything but you know being\n\n3:07stamped we are nato russia will not allow this situation to exist so it’s\n\n3:12going to demilitarize it gave the ukrainians an opportunity stay in your barracks we’re going to come in and\n\n3:18we’re going to dismantle this nato machinery um and we’re not going to kill anybody we don’t want to kill anybody\n\n3:23we’re going to we just want to get rid of this nato machinery so that whatever emerges after this\n\n3:28is not going to be a nato proxy and these two military objectives were attached to a political objective which\n\n3:34is ukrainian neutrality that ukraine can never be a member of\n\n3:40nato so this is the military operation that russia is doing so its goal isn’t\n\n3:45to give its goal isn’t to capture karkov its goal isn’t to capture capture odessa\n\n3:52its goal is to destroy the ukrainian military and in the process destroy these neo-nazi-affiliated\n\n3:59military organizations that were absorbed by the military and it’s doing just that\n\n4:05uh in in the east you have the militias which are basically russian military proxies they’re equipped by russians\n\n4:12uh they’re they probably have a lot of russian officers and ncos mixed in there um and they’re trained to russian\n\n4:18standards their job in military terms is to fix the enemy that means that i’ve\n\n4:23got 120 000 of ukraine’s best forces in the east and one of the reasons you have\n\n4:28to ask yourself why did ukrainians put so many people that far east the russians claimed because they were getting ready to launch an offensive\n\n4:34operation of their own um i don’t know i haven’t seen the russian paperwork and as you know as we\n\n4:40all know in war the truth is the first casualty so i’m not going to believe anything until\n\n4:45i see it what i do know is that the donetsk and lugansk people’s militia\n\n4:51reached out and grabbed on to the ukrainians and they’re not letting oh and those you could they shake them they\n\n4:57fight casualties on both sides but when ukrainians try to withdraw they reach out they grab them again and they’re\n\n5:03fixing them in place meanwhile the russians are doing classic pincer movements\n\n5:08now they’re not doing it as rapidly as you might want to think because the goal isn’t just to do the pincer the goal is\n\n5:15to destroy ukrainian military formations as you encounter them and that’s what they’re doing they’re\n\n5:21grinding through the ukrainian military they’re gonna meet outside the the the the ukrainian city of nepal\n\n5:28nepal petrovsk and they’re going to trap 60 to 120 000 ukrainian uh military the\n\n5:34best in the in the ukraine military trap them in the east when that happens it’s all over they’ll they’ll they’ll surrender or die\n\n5:41they’re doing the same around kiev they’re just grinding by by approaching kiev\n\n5:46they’ve compelled ukrainians to split their logistics they now have to support a major\n\n5:52military defense around kiev as well as try and support the east and\n\n5:57it’s hard to do logistics war is all about logistics i mean you can have all the tanks you\n\n6:03want in the world but if they don’t have gas you’ve got nothing and uh\n\n6:08or i’m sure yeah i’m sure as well a myriad of other little pieces and parts that have to go with it and well the\n\n6:15maintenance is an issue too but let’s just assume that everybody has well-maintained tanks when you run out of gas it doesn’t matter the tank\n\n6:21becomes useless artillery you know the an interesting thing you know you’ve seen these videos\n\n6:27of the multiple uh rocket launch systems mrls where you know um okay that’s cool looks pretty very\n\n6:35destructive on the other end but once you fire that off you got a useless piece of junk you got a vehicle with a bunch of tubes in it until you put more\n\n6:42rockets in it those rockets have to be come in a truck that truck has to drive forward and you\n\n6:48need a bunch of those trucks if you’re going to launch a big thing no one told me that in order for a 1 mlrs battalion\n\n6:54to be resupplied it takes 90 trucks okay now that’s applies to the russians\n\n7:00and that applies to ukrainians the russians have been blowing up all the fuel depots they can find the\n\n7:06russians have been blowing up all the ammunition depots you got you got artillery wonderful you’re highly\n\n7:11trained in its use great you run out of ammunition you got nothing you got the best trained men in the world run out of\n\n7:18food they run out of water they’re just hungry and thirsty and waiting to give up and this is what’s happening to\n\n7:23ukrainians the russians are grinding them and ukrainians are grinding back i mean you know they’re they’re they’re\n\n7:30winning tactical victories but operationally the russians are just pushing them and pushing them and\n\n7:35pushing them they’re controlling the operational tempo and they’re succeeding in grinding the ukrainian ability to\n\n7:42wage cohesive warfare down to nothing but now i i really want to know when was\n\n7:48the last time a major ukrainian unit had a had a resupply\n\n7:55and the answer probably is not recently because if you move you’re getting killed the russians are blowing you up\n\n8:00um so they’re you know at some point in time the ukrainian military is going to cease being a cohesive coherent fighting\n\n8:08force no matter how brave they are no matter how well equipped they are but the russians are grinding them down and\n\n8:14they’re doing it with flipped math 200 000 guys are grinding down 600 000\n\n8:22guys it’s one of the most amazing things when this story is finally told people are\n\n8:27going to be studying forever all these people right now are saying oh the russians are doing so poorly the russians this\n\n8:33maybe they are maybe i’m getting this all wrong but you know i i’ve studied military history i think i\n\n8:39know how to read a map i think i know how to look at you know balance of forces i think i know how to study\n\n8:45logistics and and stuff i think i’m reading this right and i’m pretty sure\n\n8:50um the ukrainians know i’m reading this right and i’m pretty sure the russians know i’m reading this right uh this war\n\n8:56is closer to being over uh than than many people think so what about all this\n\n9:02talk of sending in aid and lethal weaponry and uh and these so-called\n\n9:08kamikaze drones well let’s let’s be clear the the\n\n9:14javelin missile has turned out to be one of the greatest assets the\n\n9:19ukrainians have in addition to the to the the bravery of their troops again i will never denigrate you the courage and\n\n9:26the tenacity and the skill of a ukrainian soldier i mean from a military perspective\n\n9:31they deserve everybody’s admiration these guys are putting up a heck of a fight and we’ve given them some great\n\n9:37tools these javelins are killers uh in the russians i don’t think when this first started i don’t think the\n\n9:43russians appreciated just how dangerous these javelins were i think the russians are learning they’re adapting their\n\n9:48tactics and they’re making it more difficult for the ukrainians to employ the same thing with the stinger um now\n\n9:54they’re going to have a new weapon there’s these uh i forget the name of the of the drones there’s a stingers or something like\n\n10:00that uh it’s fire like a mortar\n\n10:07it looks like a mortar and it fires it up and then it goes out and it’s autonomous you fire it and it’s done it\n\n10:13goes over and it’s looking and it finds something if it matches the database\n\n10:18that it has it goes down and it and it hits it um you know\n\n10:23but you know the thing about every system like that you know they’re going to fire a bunch they might get\n\n10:2920 30 40 russian vehicles because they’re going to kill a lot of russians using this stuff and that’s one thing\n\n10:36we’ll get back to in a minute um but every system has its vulnerability and the russians are going to figure it\n\n10:41out and uh they’re going to do something they’re going to jam it they’re going to figure out\n\n10:47how to detect it how to shoot it down how to defend against it depending on its warhead\n\n10:54maybe the application of some chicken wire overhead might stop it i don’t know but you know the russians will adapt the\n\n11:00thing is this will not change the course of the battle this will allow the ukrainians to win\n\n11:06tactical victories but it won’t change the operational and strategic reality of a ukrainian defeat\n\n11:13what it is doing is killing russians and let’s let’s put on our american hats\n\n11:18for a minute remember how glad everybody was that uh bassim suleimani was killed\n\n11:24i mean because that sob was responsible for killing 600 americans in iraq\n\n11:29that son of a gun was giving them ieds and directed and they were killing americans and we hate them well guess\n\n11:36what we’re doing the russians right now we’re killing russians and if you think the russians aren’t\n\n11:42getting really really mad at us right now think again they are furious\n\n11:48they are so angry it’s not even funny and then someday there will be hell to pay there will be\n\n11:54a price because um i’ve learned anything about the russians uh they’re very they’re great people\n\n12:01but um they don’t forgive very easily i can imagine not\n\n12:07i want to uh scale back a little bit here to just before all of this started you made\n\n12:13an excellent point and it reminded me of well i i know somebody who likes to\n\n12:19drink uh mainstream media kool-aid so to speak and they’re they’re all in on uh\n\n12:26ukraine and ghosts of kiev that every propaganda bit that has come out about it but he’s\n\n12:32he’s saying oh nate nato doesn’t want russia or nato\n\n12:38doesn’t want ukraine in there at all and that they’ve declined it but you make the point that uh\n\n12:46they were more like a proxy state of nato i mean what would you say to somebody who’s\n\n12:51like oh well that would never happen they would never be in nato but why is nato taking such a fancy to ukraine i\n\n12:57guess would be a better way of putting it one of the great benefits of being in nato in fact is the only benefit of me\n\n13:04you know formally is article five um the the the you know uh attack against one is attacking install it’s\n\n13:10never really been tested by the way uh and if you read the article it’s it’s there’s no guarantee first of all it\n\n13:17says an attack against one should be an attack against all but every nation gets to consider on an individual basis what\n\n13:23it’s going to do in response and the response doesn’t necessarily have to be military innate\n\n13:28we fooled ourselves into believing that article 5 means everybody gets involved because during the cold war we front\n\n13:34loaded article five that nato army that i was talking about what you know 250\n\n13:39000 americans 100 000 brits a whole bunch of germans all working together it\n\n13:44was front loaded we everybody deployed everybody up front ready to meet the russians if they came across there\n\n13:49wasn’t going to be any mobilization any meeting of the mines they were on automatic war footing that doesn’t exist\n\n13:56today today all that military capacity has been dismantled and withdrawn um in\n\n14:02order to reconstitute it um you know nations are going to have to come together order mobilization uh and\n\n14:09it’s gonna have serious economic costs and uh it’s just not automatic uh the\n\n14:15the notion that nato will automatically respond is absurd uh you know especially\n\n14:20depending on what’s going on i would imagine that if russia out of the blue attacked poland that nato might be\n\n14:26motivated enough to come together and defend poland but if poland was involved in regime change operations in belarus\n\n14:32and got got engaged in belarus uh let’s say under an article four\n\n14:39um engagement in article four is the really dangerous aspect of nato because article 4\n\n14:45is the consultation aspect where article 4 has been used unlike article 5\n\n14:50which was done one time right after 9 11 to put some awax aircraft over american airspace totally symbolic put some ships\n\n14:57out in the mediterranean totally symbolic it’s never been used in a true combat environment article 4 on the\n\n15:03other hand was invoked to help dismantle the former yugoslavia article 4 was\n\n15:09invoked to bomb the capital of serbia for 78 days article 4 was used to dispatch nato\n\n15:16troops to afghanistan article 4 was used to remove muammar gaddafi from power in libya article 4 has some teeth it’s\n\n15:23operational it’s been used in offensive operations and it’s been used for regime change in serbia for sloven milosevic\n\n15:30uh in afghanistan for the taliban and in libya from muammar gaddafi it was also\n\n15:36used to send a nato training mission even though nato didn’t participate in the 2003 invasion a nato training\n\n15:41mission went to iraq in 2004 thereby providing legitimacy to what was\n\n15:47a massive violation of international law so you know article 4 is the um is is\n\n15:54the is the risk and right now we have article four has been activated uh poland and the three baltic nations have\n\n16:00have convened an article for consultation about the situation in in ukraine um and this is a dangerous thing\n\n16:07in fact next week they’re going to have an emergency meeting we’re going to talk about what can nato do uh about this let’s get back to ukraine\n\n16:14um first of all ukraine was never going to be a member of nato not as it’s currently constant\n\n16:20um one of the things about nato is you can’t allow a nation in if it’s got ongoing territorial disputes\n\n16:27because uh by doing that under article five you are automatically\n\n16:32going to war and so nato says you have to be free of territorial disputes you have to come in\n\n16:38clean so that when we absorb you we know what we’re getting we’re not bringing in some conflict on its own and\n\n16:45ukraine because of crimea has an ongoing territorial dispute now there was some talk a while back and russia even said\n\n16:51before before um you know the current situation the russians said look\n\n16:57our red line isn’t ukraine going in nato per se if\n\n17:05you detach crimea and the donbass from article 5. that\n\n17:10means if you allow ukraine in with the going in assumption that crimea and\n\n17:16dombas will never be considered article 5 issues um then you know we would not be happy\n\n17:22about this but we wouldn’t do anything about it that that has changed obviously that\n\n17:27that criteria changed and they they weren’t happy about uh ukraine but the other thing is ukraine\n\n17:34is and this is what people tend to forget ukraine is the most corrupt country in europe\n\n17:41i mean we’ve lionized zielinski as if you know he’s somehow the modern-day incarnation of of churchill we forget\n\n17:48that this guy arrested his political opposition shut down opposition media and made a\n\n17:54close alliance with neo-nazis well ariel but he’s jewish he would never do that really then why is he\n\n18:00handing out heroes of ukraine medals to these guys why is he glorifying step on bandera no\n\n18:06he has made a deal with the devil in terms of the as of battalion guys um\n\n18:11but this is why they would never be allowed into nato nato is a consensus-driven organization there’s 30 nations that have to agree one nation\n\n18:18objects ukraine’s not a member and there’s a lot of nations that object to ukraine being a member but ukraine’s\n\n18:24utility was never as a member ukraine’s utility was as a thorn in\n\n18:29russia’s side rand corporation in 2019 published a study a study that was ordered by the\n\n18:35department of defense they didn’t just make it up on their own it was how do we trip up russia what can we do to\n\n18:41destabilize russia down the road the number one thing was you suck russia into a conflict in ukraine\n\n18:48and you say wait a minute so you’re stating right up front that’s our goal to suck russia in meanwhile sending\n\n18:54we’ve built a permanent american training facility in ukraine where the united states\n\n19:00trains five battalions a year to nato standards for the sole purpose\n\n19:05and i’m not making this up there’s a department of defense slide that shows us we train five battalions a year to\n\n19:10send them to the donbass so they can kill russians so we’re creating the conditions for a\n\n19:18military conflict and that’s the utility of ukraine it’s it’s exists um\n\n19:24in the minds of nato in the in the united states uh solely to destabilize russia that’s all\n\n19:32that so would it be accurate to say that this is a\n\n19:38buffer state war so they’re fighting over this this buffer zone basically\n\n19:43is that it’s bigger than that because um russia has made it clear that um they’re\n\n19:48all in on the concept of redefining european security framework uh that you know the the the old you\n\n19:55know nato gets to expand any way it wants to and deploy its forces inside the nato uh you know nato territory and\n\n20:01the way those days are done russia said no that’s over uh we’re not going to be satisfied\n\n20:07until you withdraw non-national forces meaning that if you’re a polish army guy you stay in\n\n20:12poland but if you’re not polish you don’t get to go to poland you have to go back to\n\n20:181997 lines meaning any expansion that took place prior to 1997 is okay that means unification to\n\n20:25germany but you can’t go into the baltics you can’t go into romania bulgaria you can’t go\n\n20:32into hungary you can’t go into poland um that those are basically nato free zones\n\n20:37meaning no non-national forces to be deployed you have to dismantle the two anti-ballistic missile systems that are\n\n20:43in poland and romania and if you do this then russia will say\n\n20:48okay we can live with that now nato has said that will never happen i’m telling you right now it’s going to happen\n\n20:54it’s going to happen because russia is going to win this war and then russia has done something in belarus that a lot\n\n21:00of people aren’t picking up on the permanent redeployment of major russian military formations offensive military\n\n21:07formations combined with the deployment of russian nuclear forces they haven’t done it yet but they’re going to has\n\n21:13changed everything in terms of the dynamic of nato and now nato’s question is going to be how do we\n\n21:20reverse that and the only way you’re going to reverse that is to pull your troops back 1997.\n\n21:25now there will be a cold war for a while but it’s going to be too expensive i mean europe can’t afford to spend the\n\n21:31hundreds of billions of dollars necessary to get their military up to the point where they can actually\n\n21:37have a a a a cold war-like military formation facing off against russia over\n\n21:43the belarus border so um no this this is uh ukraine’s just the the first initial\n\n21:50movement of the of the chess pieces on a big chess board playing a game that putin understands but i don’t think the\n\n21:57west does yet we’re looking at a uh an economic war here as well though the the us nato\n\n22:05canada we’re we are in a sense at war already with\n\n22:10russia because of these economic sanctions and other measures that have been taken how effective are those and how do you see\n\n22:17that affecting things overall well that’s why we’ll just look at history the history of sanctions has not\n\n22:23been a good history but they don’t work um you know we put uh you know\n\n22:30what was the term that we used uh on on on iran the uh i don’t know i forget the\n\n22:37ultimate sanctions or something of that but basically we we we hit iran with everything we got and they shrugged it\n\n22:42off and said we don’t care they do care look let’s not pretend that sanctions don’t hurt they do they do\n\n22:49they don’t change policy all they do is actually make uh what could have been an inherently unpopular government very\n\n22:56popular with their people because the people rally around the government uh and oppose those who are bringing the\n\n23:02harm to them they don’t blame the government for the harm they blame the ones sanctioning them no sanctions have\n\n23:07they failed i saw this firsthand in iraq you know saddam in 1991 was a man who was about you know\n\n23:15three months away from getting the 75 cent solution applied to him that’s the cost of a nine millimeter bullet that was going to be put in the back of his\n\n23:21head by one of his generals because he lost a war his economy was garbage everything but\n\n23:26we sanctioned him and saddam was able to do one of the greatest transformations he went from being a defeated leader to the great\n\n23:32hero of the iraqi people the iraqi people rallied around him and he uh he grew in power uh domestically um\n\n23:39sanctions don’t work you know putin went into this war already pretty popular 68 percent 71\n\n23:46percent uh his popularity rating is going to shoot up in the 80s if it’s not already there um\n\n23:51the other thing is the the the program of sanctions that we’ve applied\n\n23:57only generate the outcome we want if russia wants to be part of the west\n\n24:05now the interesting thing about putin is that he always wanted to be part of the west he he he\n\n24:10early on in his in his in his uh tenure as president he said you know i i practice he he said the other day in the\n\n24:16speech he said you know i i went to bill clinton and said look if you guys want to expand nato why you just bring us in\n\n24:22and then it’ll be one big happy family and we’ll just that of course wasn’t the american objective because our goal isn’t to uh empower russia our goal is\n\n24:29to weaken russia and weaken russia by expanding up and exploiting their economy the west is responsible for the rise of\n\n24:35the oligarch class in russia we did that in 1990s by bringing in carpetbaggers who facilitated the theft\n\n24:42of state-owned property in the hands of a handful of people were responsible for the suffering any russian that lived\n\n24:48through the 1990s will tell you it was the worst decade imaginable humiliation\n\n24:53galore they they suffered tremendously because of the policies imposed by the united\n\n24:59states through boris yeltsin their compliant little astute uh boris yeltsin you know we support democracy so much so\n\n25:06we had to buy an election in 1996 to keep him in power um the national security archives\n\n25:12released recently uh transcript of the conversations between yeltsin and uh\n\n25:17and clinton and uh it’s some of the most humiliating thing in the world to read you see yeltsin literally basing himself\n\n25:24on you know begging for clinton to throw him a bone please don’t go into serbia it’s going to cause problems please\n\n25:30don’t expand nato please don’t do this and clinton ignored him the last two years there’s a name on the list of\n\n25:36russians who were listening in vladimir putin putin listened in now his president\n\n25:41humiliated himself before an american president as the americans turned their back on russia dragged their face to the\n\n25:47mud ground their face into the dirt and putin came in and said never again that’s just not going to happen again\n\n25:53i’m going to turn this around putin doesn’t want to reconstitute the soviet union one of the greatest misquotes of\n\n25:58all times is when putin you know they keep saying that you know vladimir putin said that um the greatest you know\n\n26:05political uh catastrophe in modern history or in the last century was the dissolution of\n\n26:11the soviet union and then they stopped right there as if putin is bemoaning the\n\n26:16end of this route is glad the soviet union’s gone he recognizes it for what it was a failed economic and political\n\n26:23system get a link to the rest of it because it made\n\n26:28tens of millions of russians homeless overnight trapped in what used to be\n\n26:34their home but is now a foreign land with no one to take care of them russia abandoned their own people that’s the\n\n26:42tragedy and putin has said that will never happen again i am going to take care of\n\n26:47the russian people and he has moved forward uh to do this um\n\n26:53and but one of the things he found out first of all he inherited the oligarch class you know study what putin did early on\n\n26:59he brought the oligarchs together and he gave him a choice get out of politics and you can keep your your money\n\n27:06play politics and you’ll lose everything and the ones that didn’t believe them\n\n27:12currently live in uh in london the ones that did believe them you know have still reside there but they’re\n\n27:19billionaires and you know and putin has tried to work with them from the economy standpoint you know\n\n27:25but he’s not a fan of the oligarchs um necessary evil he recently came out and\n\n27:31said uh they’re a bunch of traitors well they are traitors there’s no doubt about it but here’s why he couldn’t move on\n\n27:36them you know boot is not a dictator people need to understand that he’s a\n\n27:42democratically elected president he can lose an election it’s very possible for him to lose it’s\n\n27:47not a guaranteed outcome especially early on you know he won his first elections by like 53\n\n27:5354 um that’s you know that’s not a lot and the in the buffer is this middle class\n\n28:01about 20 of the vote are these apolitical middle class people whose economic well-being is intermeshed\n\n28:09with the west with all these western companies that came in uh they they you know they use\n\n28:14their iphones they use paypal they it’s all there and putin recognized around 2005 2006\n\n28:23that this economic dependence was a problem for for russia that the\n\n28:30west wasn’t playing straight west was using this economic infiltration of russia\n\n28:36to destabilize russia they were coming in with these non-governmental organizations that were funneling money in to do nefarious deeds\n\n28:43i mean anytime you have to buy a political party which is what the west was doing\n\n28:50that means it doesn’t really have a connection with the domestic so navalny and company\n\n28:56no they’re purely paid for by by foreign interests but you know putin wasn’t able\n\n29:02to divorce from the west because any move he made to disconnect with those 20\n\n29:08of a political people would now become very political and he could lose the election\n\n29:14so he had to proceed very carefully the west just did putin the greatest favor in the world and they don’t even realize\n\n29:20how stupid they were in this the west divorced itself from russia\n\n29:25and putin went thank you thank you very much now i get to do what i always needed to do because now you\n\n29:32see the russians saying never again will we allow ourselves to be so beholden to the west\n\n29:38that they can cause a strategic economic harm russia is decoupling from the west\n\n29:44not only the west the oligarchs putin is overjoyed that the west is\n\n29:50targeting the oligarchs he’s thrilled that they’re seizing their wealth he’s just\n\n29:56gay with joy that the oligarchs are being disenfranchised in russia because\n\n30:01this purifies russia from the standpoint of western tank and now putin people should also pay\n\n30:08attention when he met with zing zi jing ping in um beijing on\n\n30:14rhymes on on february 4th right before the olympics um you know they issued a 5 000\n\n30:21word joint statement uh and everybody’s focused on certain things like uh you know our friendship\n\n30:27is better than an alliance but what they should have focused on was that\n\n30:33both the russian leader and the chinese leader said we are done with the rules-based international order\n\n30:40that of course is the cornerstone of american foreign policy nato for the rules-based international order which is\n\n30:46the institutions and and rules that were put in place after the end of world war\n\n30:51ii by the united states to control the global economy uh it put america at the\n\n30:58top of the pyramid and was designed to keep america at the top of the pyramid um russia and china said no we’re now\n\n31:04part of the law-based international order and we are leaning more towards the united\n\n31:09nations charter and the concept of a multi-polar world um\n\n31:15and everyone okay yeah but that’s just rhetoric but then they said we are looking to create\n\n31:22a trans-eurasian economic union that will unite russia china india iran\n\n31:29pakistan the central asian nations with connectivity to africa to parts of europe to south america a global\n\n31:37economic union that will create a internal\n\n31:42economic system independent of the united states and europe meaning they don’t need them anymore\n\n31:49um this is the reality of the world we live in and it was only made possible by\n\n31:54the sanctions that the united states uh sought to put on russia this is a double restored it’s hurting russia but it’s\n\n32:01going to kill the west yeah because this also puts the uh us dollar at risk right as the world’s\n\n32:08reserve currency and if that happens uh i would think that we’re in a lot of trouble we’re in a world of hurt if that\n\n32:15if that happens you know i’m not an economist so i have to really tread carefully here um\n\n32:20but i i will say that you know there’s there’s two things there’s the the world reserve currency\n\n32:26then related to that is the petro dollar because it’s you know because the whole world depends on oil everything is sold\n\n32:33in you know in dollars that’s how transactions are done um when the united states explain to people\n\n32:39that happened in 1974 when nixon took the us off the gold standard and\n\n32:47saudi arabia required that all oil be purchased in u.s dollars so all oil that is sold is\n\n32:54done is sold traded in in u.s dollars but if that changes that reduces demand for the u.s dollar\n\n33:01and we’ve got all this money printed now you have an oversupply and the the\n\n33:06currency could collapse look\n\n33:11you know right now india china and russia are engaged and i forget the number i\n\n33:18think it’s 30 billion dollar deal um that will only be done in rubles and\n\n33:24rupees they’ve already said we’re not doing the dollar anymore uh you know and one of the reasons that\n\n33:31the united states again you know we’re so we’re so short-minded and biden was\n\n33:36chuckling well russia built up this 650 war chest\n\n33:41well we just seized 300 billion of it they can’t get access to it\n\n33:47and russia’s going okay you know well you know what what russia might do i i heard is if uh if if\n\n33:54somebody’s got you know 100 billion dollars a u.s of russian-owned u.s currency stashed away and the u.s is\n\n34:00saying you can’t get access to it russia may unilaterally pass legislation that automatically converts that holding into\n\n34:08pulled back rubles that appear in a russian bank and russia says we don’t care about that money anymore it’s\n\n34:13valueless it has no value we don’t care the money is now here and if enough of the world recognizes that as legitimate\n\n34:21now somebody has a 100 100 billion dollars worth of u.s currency it’s backed by nothing it’s just\n\n34:27paper um and this could happen over and over and over again there’s already talk about saudi\n\n34:34arabia uh selling all oil with china through the yuan the the the chinese currency so this is the beginning of the\n\n34:41end and look as an american i’m not happy about this i mean you know\n\n34:47if if the dollar loses value how am i going to pay my mortgage how am i going to pay you know my daughter’s college\n\n34:54loans how are we going to pay for anything um it will be a just absolute nightmare but\n\n35:00you know i live in a country that’s committing economic suicide i mean that that’s\n\n35:05literally what’s happening right now and they’re doing it because of the most narrow-minded policy posture imaginable\n\n35:12this this russophobic um demonization of an entire nation in the\n\n35:18personality of one man vladimir putin we’ve turned him into a cartoon figure bad guy uh all the people that sit there\n\n35:25and speak down they don’t even know the guy if you actually took i mean the other thing about putin\n\n35:31is being he’s been around for five american presidents and i make this the following challenge\n\n35:37take the inaugural address or any state of the union address of any\n\n35:42president because those are the premier speech you know written speeches those are the ones those are the big dollar\n\n35:48speeches the ones that are supposed to have the lines that we remember forever um take any one of those\n\n35:55and compare to your average vladimir putin’s speech\n\n36:00given off the cuff no script just speaking go to the valdai uh conferences that he\n\n36:07holds in sochi and listen to this man talk he is articulate he is intelligent he has\n\n36:15facts at his fingertips um he’s witty he’s humorous uh\n\n36:20this this guy is literally one of the most intelligent politicians in the world that doesn’t mean that i worship\n\n36:26and it doesn’t mean that i think that you know his breath doesn’t stink or whatever um you\n\n36:33know i know he puts his pants on one leg at a time just yeah everybody else all i’m saying is what do you agree with\n\n36:39them or disagree with them you have to respect the fact that this guy is good at what he does\n\n36:45and so when i watch these amateur tv analysts sit there and turn him into a\n\n36:51cartoon figure all i’m saying is all i’m thinking is you guys are slitting your own throat because if you don’t know\n\n36:57your enemy your enemy is going to crush you and if you’re viewing vladimir putin as a problem you have to define the\n\n37:03problem accurately before you can come up with a solution because if you’re trying to solve a problem without accurately defining what it is you’re\n\n37:09solving nothing and that’s what’s going on right now america is implementing policy after policy after policy that is\n\n37:16solving nothing because we haven’t defined the problem properly that seems to me to be extremely\n\n37:22dangerous given that we’re dealing with a nuclear power\n\n37:28yeah uh you know that they don’t need a lot about this but i mean this is you know the i think\n\n37:34it’s the american federation of scientists or um that that have the doomsday clock\n\n37:40or the union of concerned scientists or something like that you know and they keep playing with the time\n\n37:46you know to make to make point i understand why they do it but if you want to be the just be honest about it\n\n37:51put it at one second at midnight because that’s where we are perpetually because it doesn’t matter what’s going\n\n37:57on all you need is one second of a mistake\n\n38:03one second the second before someone issues the order to launch a nuclear weapon and it’s all over the world ends\n\n38:10this isn’t happening anymore um and we’re at one second at midnight\n\n38:16every single day of the year so long as the united states and russia\n\n38:21have the nuclear arsenals that they have uh and it gets even more likely for an accident when you have\n\n38:27lunacy such as taking place in ukraine or even in syria remember when hillary clinton was talking about imposing a\n\n38:32no-fly zone over syria and just was lashing off the concept of of shooting down russian airplanes\n\n38:38i mean you know it’s just it’s ludicrous people need to understand that these nuclear weapons\n\n38:44are real and the you know back in the 1980s when i when i was in high school i lived in a\n\n38:51town called marnheim and right next to martinheim was a little army base called wirehoff the wirehoff was a housing area\n\n38:57for military personnel who were guarding the largest nuclear weapons depot in\n\n39:04europe which meant that the balloon went up we were all going to die in a flash because that was going to be the first\n\n39:10place hit by a russian nuke they were going to take out all our nukes before we could get them into the field and we\n\n39:15joked about it and that you know we won’t even know what happened we’ll be asleep and it’s it’s done um and my\n\n39:21father was in the military and every once while he would disappear into the bunker when tensions got high\n\n39:27and you know imagine being a kid knowing that you live next to the principal nuclear target for the soviets and your\n\n39:32dad’s now in a bunker because there might be a war with the soviets we took nuclear war seriously this is\n\n39:38why i was such a believer in the inf treaty getting rid of those missiles was the best thing we could do for humanity\n\n39:45at the time and yet the united states is backed out of every single major arms control agreement\n\n39:51um that that had any meaning we’re still involved in a new start but we don’t take it seriously we cheat on that\n\n39:57continuously um and we’re now talking about sending back to europe\n\n40:03intermediate nuclear forces nuclear uh for uh missiles uh\n\n40:09the situation that existed in the 1980s what kind of insanity is this i mean\n\n40:15and the american people don’t care literally i’m looking at these i’m sorry my fellow americans but you’re\n\n40:21idiots you are literally the dumbest people in the world the most ignorant people in the world about the world you live in i challenge your your average\n\n40:28american to pass a geography that’s a world history test they can’t they don’t know how they have no\n\n40:34perspective on what’s going on in their name and the dangers that are attached to them at least in the 1980s we all\n\n40:41knew why we were going to die your average american has no clue why they’re about to die\n\n40:46you should see some of the politicians we have in canada maybe me and rick had said this before that uh\n\n40:53i think what the wild card in this situation is we have a president like joe biden a prime minister like uh uh\n\n41:00pierre trudeau uh uh yex justin trudeau not enough coffee this\n\n41:07afternoon by the way uh justin trudeau we got boris johnson in uk um we’re\n\n41:13nobody is too happy about these people and their competency does not seem to be too great uh how\n\n41:19how worried should we be about these individuals maybe starting nuclear war before maybe\n\n41:25putin ever would well again i don’t think a nuclear war is going to happen on purpose\n\n41:32i think it’s going to happen by accident um i will say this for the biden administration\n\n41:37that so far they’re saying the right things when it comes to a no-fly zone so far they are\n\n41:43but it’s you know joe biden is a political animal and every week that goes by\n\n41:48you see people creating more and more justification for a no-fly zone next week we have an emergency meeting of\n\n41:55nato what are they going to be talking about no-fly zone uh probably not because everybody said\n\n42:01no what they could be talking about is the creation of a humanitarian corridor inside ukraine to handle the 10 million\n\n42:09refugees are going to be coming across the border producing they’re already the 2 million and they’re saturated they can’t take anymore but what happens when\n\n42:17the russians start closing the deal on some of these military operations and\n\n42:23the ukrainians wake up to the fact that it’s over and they start all of them start running um\n\n42:29you’re going to have a nightmare at the border and nato is going to say well we have to go in and we have to secure that\n\n42:35we have to we have to provide the humanitarian assistance there so they don’t come here\n\n42:41how do you do that our projection without the russians thinking that you’re\n\n42:47interfering with their operation very dangerous situation so there’s a lot of room for\n\n42:52miscalculation and none of these guys give me confidence\n\n42:58because they all say stupid things joe biden who is a war criminal\n\n43:03no he’s not do you even know what a war crime is i mean you should because you’ve committed several yourself but you know\n\n43:10you know let’s make the case before you pass sentence uh let’s find out if the russians did\n\n43:16everything they’ve been accused of my understanding is the russians have come in as soft as possible early on um they\n\n43:23have not used all the military power that they could have they’ve suffered tremendous casualties as a result\n\n43:29and i’ll give you again i talk about military math all the time because you know the one thing about\n\n43:34when you do things over and over and over again patterns develop and in modern times uh we’ve noticed\n\n43:41that in major wars uh that are fought in um in areas where\n\n43:46civilian populations live that the the the the ratio of death is usually one to one the fifty percent of\n\n43:53the of the overall casualties uh that are suffered are gonna be civilian casualties you have to participate will\n\n43:58be military casualties let’s just assume for so right now the united nations says that somewhere around 800 civilians have\n\n44:05died that’s 800 too many i’m not minimizing any of this my heart bleeds for the the innocents caught in this war\n\n44:11um 800. i think you could i think there’s\n\n44:17conservative you could say that the russians have lost between one and four thousand guys\n\n44:24depending on where you’re going and this ten thousand numbers ridiculous ukrainians have lost\n\n44:30between six and ten thousand they’re getting slaughtered um let’s let’s go with the conservative thing let’s say 1\n\n44:36000 dead russians 6 000 dead ukrainians that’s 7 000 dead soldiers 800 dead\n\n44:41civilians that’s not even close to a one-to-one correlation you can even come up and say well they’ve killed two thousand\n\n44:47civilians okay that’s a 3.2 to 1. um\n\n44:53the point i’m trying to get at is that if the russians were just playing normal rules of the game i’m not saying war\n\n44:59crimes i’m just saying the normal rules of the game there should be 8 000 dead civilians\n\n45:06there’s not why because the russians are going out of their way where civilians are dying\n\n45:13because ukrainians have dug in into urban areas and therefore the russians have no\n\n45:19choice but to launch artillery strikes and everything to prepare the battle for the for the fight and civilians are\n\n45:25dying there russians are going out of their way to kill civilians is ludicrous\n\n45:30insane it’s just the opposite the russians are putting themselves at risk\n\n45:35uh on purpose so as to not needlessly put ukrainian civilian lives\n\n45:41at risk yes people are dying yes it’s horrible yes mistakes are made\n\n45:46but no russia’s not sitting there saying how many civilians can i kill today because believe me if they were saying\n\n45:52that the numbers would be horrific yeah yeah would you um there’s been a whole lot of talk about uh the maternity\n\n45:59hospital and stuff like that um but there’s conflicting information on the internet how likely do you think it\n\n46:06is that um these locations were restoring uh\n\n46:12whether it be uh military personnel or supplies that sort of thing\n\n46:18how likely do you think that these places were actually military targets as opposed to\n\n46:23like a hospital or something i don’t know i mean um you know this is\n\n46:29one of those areas where i don’t know that what i can say is this if that was an air delivered munition\n\n46:35we know that nato tracks every russian airplane flying over ukraine now the russians have said that no\n\n46:41airplanes flew over um the the maternity hospital on the day that it was bombed\n\n46:47okay there’s a there’s a nice little fact point uh nato if you’re accusing the russians of a war crime\n\n46:54show me the radar track tell me what airplane took off from where flew over mario pole at what time and then i could\n\n47:01say aha russia you lied we actually have an su-34 capable of\n\n47:07dropping a 500 pound bomb flying over mario about the time of the impact\n\n47:12so now do you want to reconsider your statement uh we can do that or we can say there was no airplane flying over so now\n\n47:18we have to ask the question what happened now the russians could change you know\n\n47:24provide the intelligence during the gulf war one of my jobs was um\n\n47:30targeting um and i i you know i helped prepare target folders and then i would do the battle\n\n47:36damage assessment of them afterwards but every target had to be\n\n47:41checked for legitimacy under international humanitarian law under laws of war uh is\n\n47:47this a legitimate target or you know what are the chances civilians and one of the great targets that we hit that\n\n47:53when i say great in terms of notoriety was the armoria bomb shelter\n\n47:58uh over 400 iraqi civilians died because of that attack\n\n48:04uh and people have been calling the united states war crimes well i was involved in that i’m here to tell you right now that we\n\n48:10scrubbed that site we believe we’re hitting a legitimate target we thought that there was a military can we had very good reason i\n\n48:17can’t go into right now unless they’ve declassified it but very good reason that there were presidential level communications emanating from\n\n48:23that that structure and that that was being used by high-level iraqi command and control at a time when eliminating\n\n48:30high-level command and control for the iraqis was one of our top priorities uh we had no reason to believe that that\n\n48:35place was filled with civilians uh none what if they were let’s say saddam himself himself was down there but\n\n48:43someone said there’s 400 civilians we would not have bombed it because we can’t justify the military\n\n48:49gain with the with the loss of the russians operate using the same\n\n48:54methodology i know these russian officers they’re some of the most highly trained highly moral people you’ll ever\n\n49:02meet these are not amateurs these are not you know conan the barbarian these\n\n49:07are these are professionals who understand the laws of war and they prepare the same target packages so if\n\n49:15they drop the bomb as ask yourself why did the bomb land in the middle\n\n49:21of the square because maybe what they were trying to get are\n\n49:28the armored vehicles that the ukrainians tended to park in the periphery the russians said days before this that the\n\n49:35hospital had been um emptied and that the uh the the as of people\n\n49:40were using it as a as a military site i’d like to see the russian intelligence on this i’d like them to provide the\n\n49:46target folder i’d like them to provide the intelligence the photographs whatever they use to sustain this um\n\n49:52until they do so you know that all we can say about this is we don’t know we\n\n49:58don’t know we don’t know what happened the same thing with this theater i mean you know you got the very\n\n50:03dramatic you know children yet okay great and the russians said we know it’s there we know it says the russians\n\n50:10on this one are even there there’s no ambiguity here we knew this target was there we actually put a big\n\n50:16do not bomb sign on it uh so anybody coming over there would not even drop anywhere near there\n\n50:22we also are telling you that as uh people put explosives in the roof and they’re gonna wait for an airplane to come over and then it blow it up no\n\n50:29airplane flew over mario pole the day that went off that’s the russian saying again if nato has the track\n\n50:35joe me no no no no no there was an su-24 that took off from you know rostov and uh\n\n50:41flew over and it was over there right about the time it went boom okay now we turn to the russians say you have a lot to answer for but\n\n50:48on this one i actually tend to believe because the russians aren’t stupid why commit to a fact set that can be readily\n\n50:55um discount why say no planes flew over if nato can\n\n51:01provide radar tracks to show a plane flew over uh and and i i feel that way very strongly about the theater\n\n51:08less so about the um maternity war because lavrov has has changed his uh\n\n51:13his story a couple times the first time he said no under no circumstance did we drop a bomb later on he said uh if it\n\n51:20was attacked it was because there was military forces in the area well it’s one or the other buddy you either didn’t drop a bomb or you did make up your mind\n\n51:26stick to the story and then we can evaluate it but on the theater um i’m taking the russian side right now\n\n51:32because that’s what the fact set suggests and i guess we’re looking at\n\n51:38a situation where the ukrainians maybe the asia battalion\n\n51:44they’re doing some of these things blowing some of their own stuff up for for uh\n\n51:49propaganda purposes yeah well uh absolutely look they’ve lost the battle of mara i mean that that city’s\n\n51:57gone uh all they can do right now is turn it into a um a pyrrhic victory for the\n\n52:02russians both in terms of manpower losses but also more importantly um\n\n52:08the the political uh casualty um and truth is\n\n52:14you know one of the first uh casualties of war the the azar battalion is trying to sustain the notion of russia as a as\n\n52:21a war criminal state um uh to generate more outrage more support\n\n52:27etc um the russians need to do a better job to be honest i mean i i don’t know whoever\n\n52:33is coming up with their pr but um do a better job man because right now\n\n52:38you’ve lost the pr war there’s that old joke about the the two russian soldiers soviet soldiers in berlin at the at the\n\n52:44fall of the berlin they got the russian the soviet flag over the reichstag and the guy’s going\n\n52:49well we won the battle for berlin but we lost the the information war meaning you know everybody thinks you lost the\n\n52:55battle but you want it uh the russians right now are winning the battle on the ground but they’re losing the pr fight\n\n53:00around the world and i don’t think russia took this aspect of this this conflict that seriously i don’t\n\n53:06think they understood uh the extent to which there was going to be this\n\n53:12sophisticated information warfare being waged not just by ukraine but on behalf of ukraine\n\n53:18uh by the cia by mi6 by state department by you know the the the british foreign\n\n53:25ministry um you know if you think for a second that zielinski’s um writing his own scripts think again\n\n53:31these are these are scripts when he spoke before the british parliament i can guarantee there was an mi6 agent\n\n53:37someplace there uh you know quoting henry v and quoting uh winston churchill\n\n53:42when he spoke to the american congress there’s a cia agent somewhere uh scripting you know his references to\n\n53:49martin luther king and everybody else he quoted in that in that uh speech you know this is this is information warfare\n\n53:56uh it’s a reality of the of the modern uh the the age we live in and russia’s not\n\n54:01doing a very good job at it everybody talks about the prowess of russian information war i mean come on they you\n\n54:06know they convinced every american to vote for donald trump apparently um you know so you know apparently these guys\n\n54:12are supposed to be the best information warriors in the world well they suck right now they’re not doing a\n\n54:17good job yeah they were supposed to be behind the trucker’s convoy in canada too but and uh\n\n54:23they fabricated hunter biden’s laptop i thought they did new york times finally admitted that they didn’t\n\n54:31so are we should we expect to see the uh the russians\n\n54:36come in harder now and escalate more to try to bring bring this to some sort of conclusion\n\n54:43now that they’ve kind of given them warning after warning and that they’re not surrendering the peace talks don’t\n\n54:49seem to be going where they need to go well remember for the russians the the peace talks\n\n54:57they don’t care i mean they’re not there to negotiate they’re there to accept surrender\n\n55:03the russians have set out some terms and the terms are stark uh and and the and the ukrainians have\n\n55:09to abide by these terms and right now ukraine’s not there so the war will continue you know but there’s this misperception again\n\n55:16yeah i keep hearing you know on on on cable news um the russian offensive has stalled\n\n55:22outside of kiev really how do you how do you know that well\n\n55:27they’re because they haven’t taken kiev yet do you really think that russia wants to get involved street to street fighting\n\n55:33in a in a city the size of kiev with three million residents are you high um you know that would require 800 900\n\n55:41000 1 million troops russia came into all of ukraine with 200 000 so the russians aren’t stalled the\n\n55:48russians are doing exactly what the kiev operation is a strategic uh fixing operation in the similar way\n\n55:55that i talked about the don yeskin lugansk militias fixing 120 000 uh\n\n56:00ukrainian forces down there by moving on kiev the way they did they have sucked in a huge amount of ukrainian forces to\n\n56:07defend kiev and now they’ve fixed them there and these forces have to be sustained\n\n56:12and that means that all that fuel and ammunition that could be going down here to eastern ukraine ain’t going down to\n\n56:17eastern ukraine anymore it’s going into kiev and all russia has to do is maintain its presence keep a little bit\n\n56:24of pressure going on the east and the west flank punch a little bit here punch a little bit there\n\n56:29and they’re winning they’re not going to take care of they don’t need cab they don’t want kipp they can’t take you up i\n\n56:35mean they don’t have enough people to take care of what they want is zolinsky to surrender\n\n56:40and here’s the important thing that people need to understand zielinski is the critical\n\n56:46factor in this he needs to surrender why because he has been and this again is where the west\n\n56:52made a strategic mistake by letting zielinski speak to the british parliament the american congress\n\n56:57the german parliament they have certified him as the\n\n57:02legitimate leader of ukraine what zielinski wants is okay by us\n\n57:08so if zolensky says i surrender i accept you uh crimea to be permanent part of\n\n57:13russia i accept the independence of lagansky and donetsk and i accept neutrality and you know in perpetuity\n\n57:19the world can’t say oh you don’t have a right to do that you’re not the legitimate leader of ukraine um he is if\n\n57:26they kill zelensky or he somehow has made a casualty um there will be a provisional\n\n57:31government set up in warsaw with a leader picked by nato who is going to forever say from the safety of\n\n57:37warsaw that we don’t accept anything the russians did and therefore russia is going to be\n\n57:42living in a permanent nightmare russia needs zielinski so lenski is the key so\n\n57:49they’re not going to take kiev they’re not going to kill zielinski they’re going to grind his military down to\n\n57:54nothing um and then they’re going to compel him at some point in time to say i have no\n\n57:59choice but to accept these terms and when he accepts those terms those terms have to be accepted by the united states\n\n58:06and and europe as well so that’s why they sorry i yeah it’s got to be absent i mean um\n\n58:15how serious is this guy really about any type of peace talks then if he’s going to every parliament around the world and\n\n58:21every every government around the world begging for a no-fly zone it’s kind of an oxymoron or it’s ironic\n\n58:29i think i the way i view the no-fly zone from the ukrainian perspective first of all i\n\n58:34respect that zielinski’s not a [ __ ] all right um i’m not going to sit here and do it i\n\n58:40i think that that man is far smarter for instance than boris johnson i think he’s far smarter than justin trudeau i think\n\n58:46he’s heads over hill smarter than joe he’s a smart guy he’s in a horrible situation\n\n58:53he’s also a guy who’s very vulnerable at home to neo-nazis to these these right-wingers if he goes out and\n\n58:59surrenders off the cuff as the neo-nazis have said he’ll be hanging from the neck until dead on a\n\n59:05ukrainian on a kiev street they’ve threatened him with that so he has to be careful by continuously\n\n59:12pounding about the no-fly zone he’s creating the artificial notion that had\n\n59:18ukraine been provided no-fly support they could have won the\n\n59:24war he’s creating the conditions of his surrender though he can say we fought to\n\n59:30the last man we fought to the bitter end but we were betrayed by nato and you\n\n59:35already hear this coming out from him where he’s saying that you know nato is not here for us nato’s not here to back\n\n59:40us this is going to become the political cover he needs\n\n59:46to do the surrender that must eventually happen sadly it’s going to require the\n\n59:51sacrifice of thousands of his citizens and that’s the tragedy of it all because\n\n59:58ultimately all of this could have been avoided had he just accepted the terms up front when russia before russia went\n\n1:00:04in uh all russia wanted was neutrality no more nato in your in your soil\n\n1:00:11recognized crimea and they didn’t even want independence for lagos and yet they just wanted the minsk accords to be uh\n\n1:00:18implemented so that these territories remain part of ukraine but have a special autonomy status um that’s gone\n\n1:00:25they’re independent now they’re probably and i’ve i’ve said this from the beginning that they’re just making\n\n1:00:32things worse for themselves by uh and zielinski’s making it worse for for the country he’s in the end he’s\n\n1:00:39going to lose and he won’t have any bargaining power at all no leverage to negotiate anything\n\n1:00:44you’ll just have to accept whatever is imposed no that and that that’s true i think but first of all understand that um\n\n1:00:51that was always going to be the case he never had a bargaining position if you know anything about\n\n1:00:58russia and russian leadership they don’t back down they don’t buff\n\n1:01:05they very rarely take maximalist position going in because they don’t want to trap themselves in um\n\n1:01:11in in you know with no leeway here they came in with a\n\n1:01:16maximalist position because they had spent the past seven years getting backed into a corner by the expansion of\n\n1:01:23nato by the training of uh the ukrainian military they had no choice the conditions they put down\n\n1:01:29um in december were conditions that were not flexible uh they they weren’t gonna yield on any\n\n1:01:36of this and once russia made the decision to cross the border and sacrifice russian troops\n\n1:01:42in support of this operation there will be no yielding russia doesn’t quit\n\n1:01:48um you know now if this thing dragged on for 10 years like the soviet experience in\n\n1:01:54afghanistan yeah you could get a a strategic defeat of that nation but\n\n1:02:00russia’s not here to occupy ukraine there will be no permanent presence of russian forces in ukraine what this has\n\n1:02:06done there might be a redrawing of the border i’m here to say that i don’t think mariopol will be\n\n1:02:12a ukrainian city ever again once the russians get it i think putin will say you have forfeited your\n\n1:02:19right to the city because of what you forced the russian-speaking population to go through through the presence of\n\n1:02:24the assad battalion and their insistence on destroying the city but you know the the bottom line is\n\n1:02:31zielinski will accept the terms that russia is putting forward because he has no choice he will have no choice in the\n\n1:02:37end interesting now um\n\n1:02:44i’ve been kind of worried about uh about this particular issue and i i\n\n1:02:49think you’re probably the best person to ask it to i have asked other veterans that we’ve had on the show um but what\n\n1:02:55do you think of these weekend warriors going to going out to ukraine\n\n1:03:01and joining up with their forces so i mean we have canadian citizens and there\n\n1:03:06is english citizens and i’m not sure about americans i haven’t seen too much of that but i’m sure it’s\n\n1:03:11happening where they’re going over there um yeah what are your thoughts on that and\n\n1:03:17could it be disastrous on the international stage if uh putin has uh a bunch of foreign\n\n1:03:23nationals in his possession well just start off with\n\n1:03:29who these people are and i don’t mean as individuals i’m talking about as a class are they for instance a reincarnation of\n\n1:03:36the lincoln brigade you know those starry-eyed um uh do-gooders who rallied behind uh you\n\n1:03:43know the the the the cause of uh of spaniards opposing fascism uh they\n\n1:03:48fought alongside you know the communists uh to take on adolf hitler um and and\n\n1:03:54that nature our our is that what we’re talking about are we talking you know because you’re here you know um this is\n\n1:03:59the international brigade this is the internet this is the foreign legion of the ukraine’s i mean romantic terms okay\n\n1:04:06but that’s not who’s going over there i mean if that was the case i’d expect to see a bunch of uh college kids and uh\n\n1:04:13and hippies um you know really liberal um you know you know mountain bikers and guys who\n\n1:04:20hiking enough fit people who are really concerned about the world legitimately so i’m not mocking them i’m saying there\n\n1:04:25there’s a certain class of people that went to fight for the lincoln brigade workers\n\n1:04:30you know things of that nature people who are politically aligned with the movement um i don’t see that at all i see people\n\n1:04:38saying they’re oh we’re here for ukraine no you’re not you’re here because you somehow think war is glorious you’re here because you\n\n1:04:45want to make money that makes you a mercenary the lowest form of scum on the earth is the mercenary and i say that as\n\n1:04:50a former professional soldier all right if you’re going to kill people\n\n1:04:56you better have the damn flag of your country sewn on this on the shoulder uniform and you’re better taking an oath\n\n1:05:01to your country because that’s the only legitimacy you can have going forth to take human life that’s it if you’re\n\n1:05:08going out there as a mercenary you’re a criminal you are a criminal class and i don’t care if you’re a private\n\n1:05:14military contractor a professional military you know pmi pmc whatever you want to call them\n\n1:05:20you’re a mercenary you’re taking money to do a job that’s normally done by\n\n1:05:25professional soldiers so you’re scum right off the bat i have no use for any of you um but that you know let’s just\n\n1:05:32say for a second that there was this professional mercenary class guys who woke up every morning lifted weights\n\n1:05:38went for 10 mile hikes with the 60 pound pack on their back uh practice shooting every every day at lunch so they were\n\n1:05:44proficient in their weapons and they were going over there you know they’re still scum but at least they’re well trained skunk meaning they can fight\n\n1:05:51we’re not getting that where we’re getting is a bunch of you know late 20 early 30s who guys who 10 years ago went\n\n1:05:58to iraq or afghanistan and got all pumped up on the notion of kicking down a door and terrorizing villagers uh\n\n1:06:05doing raids on goat herders you know thing and thinking that that was a war thinking that this one-sided thing that\n\n1:06:12was happening in iraq and afghanistan somehow constituted real war and they’ve gone home they’ve gotten soft uh in\n\n1:06:19their closets they have their uniforms and they have gear that they bought the army navy store and um suddenly\n\n1:06:25there’s this notion they can go kill russians because apparently killing russians is easy i mean it’s it’s not a\n\n1:06:31problem he’s rushing nobody and so i’ve had no problem\n\n1:06:36not or the 13 guys on on snake island um but so they they they head over there\n\n1:06:43and these guys are out of shape um they’re they’re they don’t have a skill set\n\n1:06:48they they haven’t even trained with one another i mean let’s say they were all really good\n\n1:06:54soldiers if you put them together and they’ve never trained with another they’re going to die instantly because the military isn’t about the individual\n\n1:07:00the military is about the team how well the team functions um these guys aren’t a team they’re going over there they’re\n\n1:07:06fat they’re out of shape they have no skill set and then they’re put together into a a unit that has no cohesiveness and\n\n1:07:13they’re put into a frontline situation and the outcome is always the same they get annihilated because they don’t know\n\n1:07:21how to fight and they aren’t even prepared for the fight they’re getting into uh you know the stories about you\n\n1:07:26oh my god we’re being hit by artillery all the time yeah welcome to modern warfare oh my god there’s heavy fire\n\n1:07:32coming in all the time yep that’s modern warfare too this ain’t the taliban this isn’t iraqi insurgent this isn’t isis\n\n1:07:39these are russians they’re going to kill you and now we go to the russian side of the story because this is the most\n\n1:07:44important aspect of it the russians have no tolerance for these people none whatsoever\n\n1:07:51when the russian military spokesperson said the best thing that’s going to happen to you the best thing\n\n1:07:57is that you’re going to be treated like a criminal prosecutor that’s the best you can hope for you\n\n1:08:03they have no rights they will not be treated as prisoner of war because they have no prisoner war status they have no status\n\n1:08:10these are people that literally um if i were a russian officer and i captured them um i would put them up\n\n1:08:16against the wall i would look at their paperwork ascertain that they don’t represent ukrainian military forces in\n\n1:08:22any legal capacity and i would shoot them and nobody could do anything about it because that’s what i am allowed to do\n\n1:08:30execute them in summary fashion and that’s but even then\n\n1:08:35they’re not going to get that what these guys are going to get is what they’re getting which is to be blown up in their\n\n1:08:40sleep or to be gunned down and their last moments will be in some ukrainian field trying to stuff their guts back into\n\n1:08:47their belly because they got split open crying for their mommy um trying to get on their cell phone to call their\n\n1:08:52girlfriend to tell them how they how they’re screaming and suffering that’s it that’s what you’re gonna get\n\n1:08:57hopefully you die instantly so there won’t be any suffering but that’s not how war works man you’re gonna lose a limb you’re gonna bleed out you’re gonna\n\n1:09:04you’re gonna get paralyzed your brain’s gonna work while your body doesn’t function while a tank runs over you this is what’s gonna happen so anyone of you\n\n1:09:11would be mercenaries listen to this don’t go because it won’t end well for you it won’t end well at all you’re gonna die\n\n1:09:18you’re going to rot in a russian prison which is worse than death or you’re going to be humiliated and\n\n1:09:24sent packing back home where you’re going to have to go to a bar and explain to everybody how you got your butt kicked in kiev\n\n1:09:32yeah i think that last one there was probably a uh most uh least likely scenario\n\n1:09:38um i think some of these individuals have great capacity to be used as\n\n1:09:43international pawns in the bigger scheme of things like we see it all the time\n\n1:09:49uh china currently has canadian citizens in their possessions and they say oh well they committed a crime and this\n\n1:09:54that and the other thing right so um i believe america has a a women’s basketball player that that’s currently\n\n1:10:01in their possession and whatever she was arrested for like god knows um\n\n1:10:09cannabis oil it creates a big problem right right but they’re but see\n\n1:10:15these people have rights yeah i mean even even though they’re held by chinese and they they were given\n\n1:10:21due process they were afforded a trial they were given a hearing\n\n1:10:28these mercenaries aren’t going to be given any of that i mean they’re they have no rights none\n\n1:10:34there it’s there’s going to be no trial they’re going to be basically taken and thrown into a gulag and believe me\n\n1:10:41the hardest place in the world is the russian gulag um you know those stories you see about\n\n1:10:46the mafioso guys with their prison tattoos and all that so it’s real these are really tough guys and if you\n\n1:10:52take a would-be fat soft around the middle mercenary and throw him into a russian prison and tell\n\n1:10:59the russian prisoners i’ve had it boys it’s all she wrote there won’t be any\n\n1:11:04you know bargaining chip or nothing there’s no mercy a bargaining chip is when somebody has value you view them as\n\n1:11:11a human you can trade them these mercenaries have no value they’re going to die\n\n1:11:17that’s it the russians don’t view them as human beings\n\n1:11:22so this week we saw zelensky address canadian parliament he addressed congress\n\n1:11:30asked for more help do you think that is a factor in the way things are going\n\n1:11:35to play out and it seems to me that continuing to send\n\n1:11:41lethal aid weapons money to buy more weapons money that’s going to put weapons into the\n\n1:11:47hands of some of these nazi battalions it seems to and we saw all them all stand and\n\n1:11:54clap but in canada alone we’re looking at i think\n\n1:11:59almost a half a billion dollars in money and night vision goggles and a bunch of\n\n1:12:05other stuff and i think there’s more to come to me that seems misguided it’s just likely to prolong things\n\n1:12:15i mean it’s going to make it more lethal i don’t think it’s going to prolong anything the fate the die has already\n\n1:12:20been cast it’s over it’s all over but the you know the final sentence has to be written in the final\n\n1:12:26chapter um what’s going to happen though is\n\n1:12:32again the russians have been very very i mean i it surprised me to be honest\n\n1:12:37because i’ve studied the russian military and um the notion of them having the soft touch\n\n1:12:42what i didn’t appreciate and i do now um is that the russians actually view ukraine as a brother you know it’s it’s\n\n1:12:48a brotherslaw country they don’t have animosity or at least they didn’t start there wasn’t hatred\n\n1:12:55they weren’t crossing the border in the nazi germany um so there you know that they were trying to\n\n1:13:01go to war lacking the one thing that you absolutely have to have when you go to war which is hatred\n\n1:13:07i mean if you’re a military guy and you don’t hate your enemy you’re in trouble because the second you hesitate the second you view them as a human they’re\n\n1:13:14going to get you uh you got to go in and just say i’m i’m hard they’re all going to die\n\n1:13:20um yeah i’m going to respect the law of war but you know there’s no mercy uh there’s no\n\n1:13:26fair fight there’s no even fight there’s no giving them a chance kill them all and bring all your people\n\n1:13:32home that’s the way you wage war and the russians went in saying no we’re going to go stop we don’t want to kill them\n\n1:13:37all they haven’t been hitting the ukrainian berries well they did today i don’t know if you saw what happened outside of nicolaev\n\n1:13:44but um a a a brigade got hit uh it’s awful horrible but uh hundreds of people are\n\n1:13:51dead um and this is going to happen again because the russians are tired of this\n\n1:13:57so far they haven’t hit the convoys coming in i think you’re going to find these nato convoys that have been coming in so far\n\n1:14:04the russians have waited for them offload their stuff and get them in the warehouse and unfortunately when that happens some of it leaks through to the\n\n1:14:10battlefield the russians are going to shut this thing down they’ve already said don’t try and bring in an s 300 um\n\n1:14:17service air missile system because we’re going to blow it up at the border please count on it 100 certainty\n\n1:14:24we’re going to do it and they’re going to start becoming more lethal at the border too you’re going to see more and more strikes\n\n1:14:31because they’re just fed up they’re fed up they’re they’re they’re tired of losing men\n\n1:14:36by by being nice by trying to be reasonable nato’s not being reasonable the west is\n\n1:14:43not being reasonable canada is not being reasonable sending all this lethal aid is not reasonable\n\n1:14:49uh because the second you send it in what you’re saying is we want dead russians and the russians are going to take\n\n1:14:54umbrage at that and sooner or later they’re going to say well then if you want death we’re going\n\n1:14:59to give you death and uh you know this is anecdotal but\n\n1:15:06someone if you go online and take a look at um\n\n1:15:11the anti-piracy uh efforts by the different navies in the um\n\n1:15:16off the coast of somalia and see how different forces handle it\n\n1:15:22when you look at the russians um there’s no mercy they they sink the ship and they kill every pirate in the water\n\n1:15:28and they just do it without smiling or not they just kill everybody you know other people want to disable the ship\n\n1:15:33and then come in and capture the pirates they want to do this russians just no we’re going to kill them all because the\n\n1:15:40pirates are like mercenaries they’re scum they’re less than human they’re going to die\n\n1:15:46russia is going to start to view the convoys and the people that man these convoys bringing these weapons in\n\n1:15:51is less than human scum they’re going to kill them and\n\n1:15:58the russians are pretty violent i’m you know they’re capable of great violence they haven’t demonstrated that yet but they\n\n1:16:04are capable just ask the germans ask people that defended berlin ask the people to defend stalingrad\n\n1:16:11ask the people that fought them in the the great battles of the destruction of army group center how much mercy the\n\n1:16:17russians showed them when it came time none so do you have any sense of how much\n\n1:16:25time we’re looking at here it’s hard to say because i don’t know the exact um\n\n1:16:31situation for the ukrainians i don’t know you know they’ve shown great resilience i mean\n\n1:16:37you know like i said at the end of the day people are going to be writing books about what the russians said people will be writing books about what the ukrainians did as well\n\n1:16:44um there’s there’s no dishonor in anything that they’ve done in terms of their defense of their homeland uh they’ve\n\n1:16:50fought very hard and they’ve proven themselves to be uh capable defenders of their homeland um\n\n1:16:57i don’t know what they have left it’s hard to say if i if if i knew how much fuel they had if\n\n1:17:03i knew how much ammunition they had if i knew what their food supplies were you know you hear kiev say that you know if\n\n1:17:09we get surrounded we have a week’s worth of food um well okay but that means that if you’re\n\n1:17:15not surrounded you have to keep supplying that food and where’s that coming from and i right\n\n1:17:21you know to what extent has russia tried to cut off food supply to uh to kiev i\n\n1:17:26mean it seems to me russia’s left trains running i mean one of the first things in a normal war is i’m going to blow up every\n\n1:17:33train track there’s going to be no trains running the russians have allowed trains to run throughout the country um the russians have allowed uh truck\n\n1:17:40convoys to run they’re they’ve allowed a civilian domestic redistribution of uh\n\n1:17:47of resources to civilian populations to continue to exist um\n\n1:17:53you know so they haven’t shut that down yet um so it’s hard to say how much more the\n\n1:17:59ukrainians can take and again i think the russians they have to hate themselves because at the end they\n\n1:18:06need zelinski to surrender if you go too fast you could cause zelinski to get thrown\n\n1:18:13out if you go too long you could you know cause yourself to peter out i mean you\n\n1:18:19know even though the russians are winning right now they could still lose this if this drags on forever so they have to\n\n1:18:26find the the appropriate mix and then unfortunately there’s now we’re talking about\n\n1:18:31um using political objectives to define military uh capabilities um you know\n\n1:18:38this could be ended tomorrow for russia wanted literally they you know they have the weaponry to\n\n1:18:44make this all go away and i’m not talking about nuclear i’m just saying that you know they have they have capabilities they haven’t\n\n1:18:50employed yet um they don’t want to employ it they don’t want to kill ukrainian civilians they\n\n1:18:56don’t even want to kill ukrainian soldiers uh if you fight you die but they’re not\n\n1:19:01you know like i said until recently they weren’t hitting the barracks they weren’t hitting the ukrainians at their weakest they weren’t hitting troop\n\n1:19:06formations that they could hit easily um that may change now so this could end\n\n1:19:13this week this could end next week this could end in a month\n\n1:19:19i can’t see it going much longer than that because you know at some point in time\n\n1:19:25ukrainians are going to just run out of capacity to defend they’re going to run out of fuel they’ll run out of ammunition and the\n\n1:19:32supplies aren’t going to come in the russians are going to shut that down and when you shut that down the ukrainians lose hope\n\n1:19:38they lose hope and without hope you really can’t resist anymore so what do you think the\n\n1:19:45victory looks like for the russians or i mean for the ukrainians for zielinski i\n\n1:19:50guess his idea of victory would be to force the russians to leave the country but it doesn’t look like that’s even\n\n1:19:57like close to likely to happen so for the russians what does victory ultimately look like\n\n1:20:06they’ve set the terms victory will be denotification what does denotification look like it’s the absolute destruction of\n\n1:20:14all military formations that have that have been imbued with neo-nazi ideology\n\n1:20:21um it could be the um\n\n1:20:27going into the vote and eliminating the political parties that have endorsed\n\n1:20:34this right-wing ideology i don’t know if russia wants to do that that’s again a major\n\n1:20:41military move but even if they don’t do that to get zielinski to agree to\n\n1:20:47um enact the legislation that outlaws steppen bandera uh removes him as a national hero\n\n1:20:55this of course is that nazi from ukraine’s past to collaborated with hitler the man who\n\n1:21:01uh sent 80 000 guys to join the waffen ss who had the ukrainian auxiliary police murder 30 000 jews at baba yar\n\n1:21:08not a good guy and yet he’s the national hero of ukraine today they have statues streets named for him\n\n1:21:14that all goes away bandera will be outlawed um just like hitler was outlawed in post-world war ii germany\n\n1:21:20bandera will be outlawed that’s denotification demilitarization is simply um\n\n1:21:27your military cannot be part of nato can’t be equipped by nato trained by nato there could be no foreign forces in\n\n1:21:33there um permanent neutrality um there will be a you know whether they want to you know\n\n1:21:39call it austrian style neutrality finish style neutrality swiss i don’t know i don’t know whatever they end up calling\n\n1:21:45it it’s going to be permanent um and then the the recognition\n\n1:21:51that crimea is russia and donetsk and lugansk are independent there may be an expansion of\n\n1:21:58um done yet to include mario pole because i don’t see russia\n\n1:22:03allowing this that city with its russian population to be turned over to the\n\n1:22:09ukrainians after what has happened to them when the when the true story of what has happened in mario paul comes out\n\n1:22:14um the world will be ashamed of uh supporting the ukrainian government that allowed this to happen\n\n1:22:21um that’s that’s victory that’s victory for russia um victory for zielinski will be um\n\n1:22:30survival and uh able to um retain as much of ukraine intact as\n\n1:22:35possible and that’s that’s it that’s all he can hope for\n\n1:22:42i’ve heard some analysts say that biden could be the man of the hour or maybe some\n\n1:22:48you know you get macron to come in or some other european leaders to try to\n\n1:22:55arbitrate an end to this thing but it just doesn’t seem to be in the cards at\n\n1:23:01this point it looks like it’s just going to have to play out what cars what cars did biden have today\n\n1:23:07oh what is he going to come back and uh and say okay we’re going to lift sanctions russia doesn’t care anymore\n\n1:23:14russia doesn’t want the sanctions lifted russia is decoupling so biden has no\n\n1:23:20cards and let’s also understand this about the economic russia has not cut off any\n\n1:23:25energy supplies the only energy termination has been unilateral on the part of the west the\n\n1:23:31united states saying we’re not going to buy russian oil anymore although my understanding is we still have some tankers on their way to american ports\n\n1:23:38because we haven’t found a alternative to the russian oil yet um you know that\n\n1:23:43our refineries are geared to a specific grade of crude that used to be produced in venezuela\n\n1:23:48but when we sanctioned venezuela we replaced it with with a similar great crew coming out of russia the only place\n\n1:23:54in the world that produces it and now we’re just going to stop buying that but we haven’t solidified our deal with you with the venezuela oh\n\n1:24:01thanks joe um you know well thought out plan here but russia hasn’t cut off any pipelines\n\n1:24:08there’s still this is the most amazing thing they’re still shipping gas through pipelines on ukrainian soil\n\n1:24:16and depositing the billions of dollars of transit fees into accounts controlled\n\n1:24:21by the ukrainian government russia is complying with every contractual obligation it has regarding\n\n1:24:29the provision of energy they haven’t violated a single contract and they won’t\n\n1:24:34they’re waiting for the west to violate the contracts and then when they do some amazing things are going to happen\n\n1:24:41like all of europe will go dark uh the european economy will cease to exist\n\n1:24:47um factories will shut down they’re already shutting down in in france because the price of gas is so high the michelin\n\n1:24:53tire factory can’t stay open can’t can’t produce anything um you know and that’s with russia\n\n1:24:59continuing to provide the energy if russia wanted to play hardball they just hit the off switch and all of europe\n\n1:25:06shuts down instantly they’re because no matter what biden said going in oh we have a plan he\n\n1:25:12doesn’t have a plan there is no plan b there is no energy alternative when you deny europe 30 to 40 percent of\n\n1:25:20the energy it needs and you have nothing to replace that means 30 to 40 percent of your economy shuts down but that’s not how economies work when you shut\n\n1:25:26down forty percent of the economy you shut down 100 of the economy it’s all sea road you know so\n\n1:25:34the west is hyping up the pain that’s being felt by russians believe my wife has a\n\n1:25:39brother over there um we know what’s going on we know the pain that they feel this is real pain this is not good\n\n1:25:46um but the pain that they’re feeling is nothing compared to the pain that could be\n\n1:25:52brought to bear on europe if if putin wanted to do that but the the russians have always said\n\n1:25:58we will not use energy as a weapon and they never have they never have\n\n1:26:04the only one using energy a weapon is the west and sooner or later you’re going to find out that that that weapon\n\n1:26:10they’re willing it’s a double-edged sword that uh cuts deeper on their side than on the\n\n1:26:16russian side robert starr says bio labs wf nato dimension if you can we get\n\n1:26:23some thoughts on this this whole issue surrounding the the bio labs sure um i’ll just start off\n\n1:26:30by saying that i wasn’t involved in any of that stuff um but some of my best friends were some of my\n\n1:26:36best friends were the program managers of this bio lab and i’ve talked to them extensively about this before and since\n\n1:26:43um first of all there’s nothing secret about these bio labs existence it’s not\n\n1:26:48classical uh even though maybe many people in the world didn’t know about it these are unclassified programs that are\n\n1:26:54part of uh what’s called the cooperative threat reduction effort that was\n\n1:27:00spearheaded by uh senator nunn and senator luger back in the\n\n1:27:05aftermath of the demise of the soviet union though one of the concepts of cooperative threat reduction was\n\n1:27:11if you have a nation like the soviet union that had nuclear weapons programs nuclear weapons chemical weapons\n\n1:27:17programs chemical weapons biological weapons programs biological weapons it’s not just about getting rid of the\n\n1:27:22weapons or bringing them under control it’s about what happens\n\n1:27:27uh to the people that built these weapons that made these weapons especially when you start shutting down\n\n1:27:34the vehicle of their employment for instance if we shut down the erasmus\n\n1:27:40nuclear warhead production facility the guys that build warheads if they don’t have a job are going to take that skill\n\n1:27:46set elsewhere maybe to north korea maybe to iran um and so even although i say iran only\n\n1:27:53because we think that in the west the iranians don’t want it but um you know or the same thing about\n\n1:27:58chemical weapons or by a lot so in ukraine you had a number of soviet-era biological weapons facilities\n\n1:28:07that were used to produce biological weapons and so in 2005 a an agreement was signed\n\n1:28:14between the ukrainian government and the defense threat reduction agency to um\n\n1:28:20bring these labs under control of the united states even though they’re under ukrainian management the\n\n1:28:26united states would bring them under their control as part of this program for the purpose of\n\n1:28:33accounting for biological pathogens that were related to former weapons programs so the idea\n\n1:28:40was you’re going to bring them under control identify them catalog them destroy them and then you provide\n\n1:28:46gainful employment for these scientists through defensive oriented biological\n\n1:28:52research or just biological research in general looking for you know\n\n1:28:57trying to predict future pandemics coming up with vaccines to existing pathogens that exist in the wild\n\n1:29:04legitimate research and that was the idea well a couple\n\n1:29:09things we we found out uh robert pope is a former air force lieutenant colonel who currently runs\n\n1:29:15the defense threat reduction agency he spoke i think either the day before the day after the russians went in and uh he\n\n1:29:22made an amazing admission he said it might turn out that um at some of\n\n1:29:28these former soviet facilities uh scientists being scientists they may\n\n1:29:34have kept some of their prior work meaning that they have these\n\n1:29:40frozen pathogen samples of actual soviet-era biological weapons\n\n1:29:46that is not permitted by treaty the biological toxins weapons convention\n\n1:29:52article 1 specifically prohibits the acquisition and retention of these\n\n1:29:58pathogens the united states signing the 2005 agreement was now in the position where everything\n\n1:30:04ukrainians had the united states has now acquired and if we don’t destroy it we have retained it so for over 15 years 17\n\n1:30:13years to be exact we have been in violation of the biological action weapon simply by failing to follow\n\n1:30:20through on our obligation to fully account for these pathogens and dispose of these pathogens now\n\n1:30:26someone can say well that’s just an innocent accounting mistake and i will agree with them meaning that\n\n1:30:32i understand how bureaucracies work i understand how international relations work i understand how you know human you\n\n1:30:38know human nature works and this very well could have happened it shouldn’t have happened but it could have happened\n\n1:30:44but that’s not the biggest problem here the biggest problem is some of these\n\n1:30:49some of the work that the these labs were apparently called upon to produce and i can tell you from my own experience when i was a\n\n1:30:55firefighter here in new york i i did hazmat i was a hazmat specialist um\n\n1:31:00which is sort of a super hazmat technician i’m the guy that puts on the funky suit goes in there and\n\n1:31:06investigates all this stuff and i did all the federal level courses so i went to aniston um alabama where\n\n1:31:13we went through the chemical weapons course where we actually worked with live sarin and live vx nerve agent\n\n1:31:20now you say well how do you do that isn’t that a chemical weapon well we produce them at the laboratory scale\n\n1:31:26to use them in these facilities as part of defensive training but\n\n1:31:31if you can produce them in small scale you could produce them in large scale could you not so there’s some question about the\n\n1:31:39whether or not this actually conforms with it now the united states be in the united states we make our own rules\n\n1:31:45remember the rules based international order and uh therefore we say no it’s okay because we know we don’t have any\n\n1:31:50nefarious intent wouldn’t allow iraq to do this because we assume they have nefarious attempt we assume anybody who\n\n1:31:56had a similar program to ours is obviously simply creating the conditions for a breakout chemical weapons uh but\n\n1:32:03in the united states no we’re we’re okay don’t worry remember that anthrax that was used in the aftermath of 911 yeah it\n\n1:32:08was produced in dugway at a similar facility where they produce anthrax for testing purposes for defensive the same\n\n1:32:15thing the department that the firefighters go to aniston and undergo biological training where\n\n1:32:20they’re exposed to live botulinum live anthrax and you say well wait a minute how do we have that that’s a weapon\n\n1:32:27uh well no no it’s only for training for it well apparently a tube of it because it produces a paste\n\n1:32:33right powder paste oh it got away and the guy was able to put it in envelopes and spread it around it was the most\n\n1:32:38highly refined anthrax in the world very dangerous stuff um came from that\n\n1:32:44laboratory so we produce chemical weapons we produce biological weapons as just as a matter of fact this doesn’t\n\n1:32:51now this is without even ukraine so understand that we take this american approach which is very foodless and\n\n1:32:57fancy free when it comes to the law uh that’s set down with the chemical weapons convention the biological parts\n\n1:33:03and weapons convention etc and we come to ukraine why\n\n1:33:09if all we’re doing is defensive research or basic biological research is there a program\n\n1:33:15that investigates avian flu that’s bird flu\n\n1:33:20you remember one of the original pandemics was h1 hn1 i think bird flu\n\n1:33:26so we’re investigating bird flu and how it can be vectored transported using migratory\n\n1:33:34birds whose migratory pattern takes them exclusively into russia\n\n1:33:41carrying a form of avian flu that has been genetically engineered\n\n1:33:47only to impact slavic russian slavic dna\n\n1:33:52specifically says no ukrainian dna can be used here because we don’t want to spread it among the ukrainians it’s one\n\n1:33:59of those effective herds lands and uh now i’m not saying the united states\n\n1:34:04actually did this but the russians have to i mean i mean i’m not saying they actually weaponize this put them in\n\n1:34:09birds that flew these birds into into russia what i’m saying is they researched it and how is that not an offensive\n\n1:34:15biological weapons program how is that not something that would cause if we found out that the russians\n\n1:34:21were in mexico uh and that they had developed a strain of the bird flu that they could put on\n\n1:34:26sand cranes knowing that the sand cranes were going to fly north to their nesting areas in the united\n\n1:34:33states carrying a strain of bird flu that was engineered only for anglo-saxon\n\n1:34:39americans would we not view that as an assault\n\n1:34:45on the united states of course canada would because some of these sand cranes go up to canada imagine if they landed in canada and\n\n1:34:51suddenly all your anglo-saxons in canada got sick with the bird flu and started\n\n1:34:56dying in massive numbers um because it’s been genetically engineered you’d call that an act of war\n\n1:35:04so the united states has been caught out on this one now if there’s a legitimate excuse explanation for this\n\n1:35:10please make it but right now you know i say this is an american i’m on the russian side on this one because\n\n1:35:16i’m on the side of truth and the russians have the documents the united states can’t sit here and call\n\n1:35:22this a manufactured event the documents exist they have specific unique identifying features that will match the\n\n1:35:29similar set of documents here in the united states uh and if congress ever did a legitimate\n\n1:35:36inquiry into this they would find that things have been done in the u.s taxpayer with u.s taxpayer money in the\n\n1:35:42u.s name that violate every treaty obligation we have and undermines the\n\n1:35:47moral authority of the united states to ever again stand up in front of the world and say we stand for the rule of\n\n1:35:53law not if we did this is that i i think that’s why we saw\n\n1:36:02the censorship imposed immediately after the\n\n1:36:09the russians began to to pull those documents out yeah no yeah it’s it’s look this is this is an embarrassment\n\n1:36:16now the united states being the united states uh you know\n\n1:36:21we’re no longer the land of the free in the home of the brave uh because to be free\n\n1:36:27you have to have freedom of speech to be free you have "
