        "text": "Michele Marsh, an Emmy Award-winning newscaster who was an anchor on nightly programs on the CBS and NBC flagship stations in New York City for more than two decades, died on Tuesday at her home in South Kent, Conn. She was 63.\n\nThe cause was complications of breast cancer, her son, John Paschall, said.\n\nMs. Marsh was one of several women — Carol Jenkins, Pia Lindstrom, Carol Martin and Melba Tolliver were the others — who had by 1980 swept into anchor positions at all five of the New York stations that had late-night news programs. Ms. Marsh, at 25, was the youngest of them.\n\nThey joined a wave of women, including Pat Harper, Judy Licht, Rose Ann Scamardella and Sue Simmons, whom television audiences, used to all-male newscasters, welcomed in the 1970s.\n\nMs. Marsh spent 17 years at WCBS, alternating between stints as an anchor — with Rolland Smith, Ernie Anastos, Jim Jensen and John Johnson — and as a correspondent, depending on fluctuations in ratings.\n\nIn 1996 she was one of seven anchors and reporters dismissed in a housecleaning by the station, but she was shortly recruited by WNBC, where she anchored with Chuck Scarborough for a time. She left the station after she lost her anchor slot in 2003.\n\nMichele Marie Marsh was born on March 9, 1954, in suburban Detroit to Howard Marsh, an insurance salesman, and the former Gloria Gadd.\n\nHer first marriage, to Nathaniel Price Paschall, ended in divorce. In addition to their son, John, she is survived by her second husband, P. H. Nargeolet.\n\nMs. Marsh graduated from Northwestern University, where she majored in radio and television production.\n\nShe began her career at WABI-TV in Bangor, Me., where she ran the teleprompter with her toes while on the air. She told The Bangor Daily News in 1976 that she had gotten fan mail “from little boys who say, ‘Let’s run off together, my father owns an ice cream truck.’ ”\n\nAfter moving to KSAT-TV in San Antonio, she came to the attention of adults, too, becoming so popular that guards were assigned to fend off her admirers.\n\nAfter only five months in New York, when she was still 25, she said her brown hair had already started turning gray. Before she left in 2003, she would win five local Emmy Awards in the nation’s most competitive market."
