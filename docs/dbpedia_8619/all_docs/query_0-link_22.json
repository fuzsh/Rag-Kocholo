        "text": "A Nazi agency to train young Germans. In 1931 Baldur von Schirach was appointed Youth Leader of the Nazi Party. In 1936 Hitler outlawed all other youth organizations and announced that all young Germans should join the Jungvolk (Young Folk) at the age of 10, when they would be trained in out-of-school activities, including sports and camping, and receive Nazi indoctrination. At 14 the boys were to enter the Hitler Youth proper, where they would be subject to semi-military discipline, out-door activities, and Nazi propaganda, and girls the League of German Maidens, where they would learn motherhood and domestic duties. At 18 they would join the armed forces or the labour service. By 1936 3.6 million members had been recruited, and by 1938 7.7 million, but efforts to enrol young people were failing, so that in March 1939 a conscription order was issued."
