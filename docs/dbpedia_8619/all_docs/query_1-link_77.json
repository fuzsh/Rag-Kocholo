        "text": "The goal of the Hitler Youth was to indoctrinate young boys into becoming loyal Nazis, and to train them for future service in the military or other branches of the government.\n\nThe Bund Deutscher Mädel was the female counterpart to the Hitler Youth, and both organisations were compulsory for children of Nazi Party members.\n\nAll other German children were encouraged, but not required, to join. Finally, it did not accept Jews.\n\nBetween the years 1930 and 1935, Jewish teenagers attended their own youth organisations in Germany.\n\nIn March 1922, the Hitler Youth League (Jugendbund der NSDAP) was formed.\n\nIn 1924, it was named the Greater German Youth Movement, and then called the Hitler Youth, League of German Worker Youth (Hitler-Jugend, Bund deutscher Arbeiterjugend) in July 1926.\n\nBy 1931, it was divided into four sections, based upon gender and age:\n\nGerman Youngsters (Deutsches Jungvolk) for boys 10-14 years old;\n\nYoung Girls' League (Jungmädelbund) for girls 10-14 years old;\n\nThe League of German Girls (Bund Deutscher Mädel, or BDM) for girls 14-18 years old;\n\nHitler Youth (Hitlerjugend) for boys 14-18 years old.\n\nIn 1931, Baldur von Schirach was named head of the Hitler Youth movement, but in 1940, he became the Nazi Party leader of Vienna. Artur Axmann, a Hitler Youth leader aged 27, took his place.\n\nThe Hitler Youth was originally established as a way to instill Nazi values in the young people of Germany.\n\nThe Hitler Youth was an important part of the Nazi regime and played a significant role in indoctrinating young people into the Nazi way of thinking.\n\nThe organisations accomplished this by controlling the lives of Germany's youth because membership in the organisation required significant investment of their time.\n\nIts members were expected to participate in a variety of activities such as paramilitary training, political education, and outdoor camping trips.\n\nThe Hitler Youth also ran its own schools and youth clubs, where members could learn about Nazi ideology and partake in physical fitness activities.\n\nThe Third Reich's indoctrination policies severely eroded the impact of parents, teachers, religious authorities, and other authoritative figures.\n\nIn fact, members were encouraged to submit reports about their leaders if they disagreed with Nazi ideology.\n\nThe Hitler Youth served as a training ground for future soldiers and leaders of the Nazi regime, teaching them how to use weapons, march, salute Nazi officials, and participate in political rallies and marches.\n\nMany young men who joined the Hitler Youth went on to serve in the German military during World War II.\n\nThe Hitler Youth movement was extremely successful in its early years, growing from just a few hundred members in 1922 to over two million by 1933.\n\nThis growth can be attributed to several factors, including the fact that membership was seen as a way to curry favor with the Nazi regime.\n\nAnother factor was the appeal of the Hitler Youth's activities, which included camping trips, sports competitions, and other outdoor activities that appealed to young boys.\n\nGleichschaltung, the Nazi policy of totalitarian control, also played a role in the Hitler Youth's success.\n\nThis policy aimed to control all aspects of German society, and the Hitler Youth was seen as a way to indoctrinate young people into the Nazi way of thinking.\n\nIn March 1939, a new regulation required all children between the ages of ten and 18 to join the Hitler Youth.\n\nThe only legal youth organization in Nazi Germany from that point forward was the Hitler Youth. Those who did not comply could be fined or imprisoned.\n\nThe Hitler Youth was organised as a military organisation. It was created to teach boys how to become future fighters and soldiers for the Nazi cause.\n\nThe Hitler Youth had an enlisted military structure at the local, regional, and national levels as an official organisation of the Nazi state.\n\nIn the summer months, boys trained in military techniques and learned to use weapons.\n\nAlso, they worked on farms and took part in competitive sports, particularly boxing.\n\nSome kids liked the physical strain, rivalry, and camaraderie that came with it. Others found it overwhelming and alienating to be constantly focused on preparing for war while sacrificing themselves for their country.\n\nThe League of German Girls was designed to teach young women how to be future wives and mothers. Girls also took part in physical activities, such as gymnastics. Individual girls' sports were less common than group sports.\n\nActivities such as these helped to illustrate the value of collaboration. The League educated young women on how to take care of their homes and families.\n\nSewing, nursing, culinary arts, and domestic upkeep were just a few of the abilities that girls developed.\n\nBy the outbreak of World War II in 1939, the Hitler Youth had trained a generation of young people to invade and occupy foreign territory.\n\nYoung men and women who became members of the Hitler Youth in the early 1930s had been taught useful skills as well as Nazi concepts.\n\nThose who were over the age of 18 utilised these skills to contribute to the German war effort.\n\nThey served in the military, as police officers, secretaries, nurses, and doctors."
