        "text": "Berlin, October 1\n\nTwo senior servants of the Third Reich, Albert Speer, Hitler’s Armaments Minister, and Baldur von Schirach, former leader of the Hitler Youth and Gauleiter of Vienna, were released at midnight from Spandau Prison in West Berlin, having completed sentences of 20 years’ imprisonment for war crimes.\n\nThey left in separate cars with members of their families who had come to fetch them. For their release they were given the clothes they were wearing when they were arrested in 1945.\n\nSpeer was driven to the Hotel Gerhus in the Grunewald district where he spoke to the press in German, English, and French. “You can see that in spite of 20 years imprisonment, I am in good condition,” he said. “Since Stalin’s death, we have been treated politely and decently. The food was good and sufficient. I say this to contradict some reports that have been spread about the prison.”\n\nPraise for Hess\n\nSpeer was full of praise for Rudolf Hess, who, at 72, was left behind in prison to complete his life sentence. “He stood up well under the strain of the last few days as he watched us prepare to leave,” Speer said. “I must pay him a high compliment. He showed strong nerves.”\n\nSpeer, 6I, is the fittest and most self possessed of the three. He has planned to take up his old job of architect again and will probably settle down in Heidelberg, where live his wife, four sons, and two daughters.\n\nVon Schirach, aged 59, blind in one eye and with poor sight in the other, was divorced in 1959. He intends to live with his son in Munich and will not be short of money for he is to inherit large interests in an engineering firm in Philadelphia which belonged to his American mother.\n\nNew prison for Hess\n\nThe Russians will not agree to Hess’s release, but they yesterday responded to a proposal by the Western Powers that at least Hess should be incarcerated in less costly surroundings, watched over by fewer warders and military guards.\n\nThe Russians have hinted that Hess could well be placed in a building within the prison compound. They wanted to keep him in West Berlin as the custody of Hess is one of the two relics of four-Power control in the city, the other being the air safety centre.\n\nAccording to his lawyer, Hess is mentally ill. He refuses to see visitors, spends most of his time staring into space, and is irritable with his guards. He has been in captivity for 25 years, ever since he flew to Scotland in 1941 on a private peace mission."
