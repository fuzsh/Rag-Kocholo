        "text": "Throughout history, we find examples where children have been unwitting accomplices to the atrocities of cruel regimes. The Nazi Party, the German fascist political party led by authoritarian leader Adolf Hitler from 1920-1945, was especially notorious for its indoctrination of German youth in order to serve the ultimate goals of their regime. The Nazis had extremely ambitious objectives, including the firm belief that it was crucial to preserve the Aryan race by protecting it from what they deemed “undesirables.” Hitler knew that his success rested in large part on inculcating his German Nationalist principles and anti-Semitism into the minds of the youngest of German citizens. He said in his speech at the Reichsparteitag in 1935, “He alone, who owns the youth, gains the future.” The fact that the Hitler Youth played such a crucial role in Hitler’s grand scheme for Nazi Germany indicates a disturbing manipulation of children’s brains, brains that were not yet fully developed, were incredibly susceptible to brainwashing, and were easily co-opted by a powerful authority figure. By examining the specific stories and personal accounts of members of the Hiltler-Jugend (HJ)—the Hitler Youth, and in the girl’s case, the Bund Deutscher Mädel (BDM)—League of German Girls, and their range of experiences as adults, this paper will seek to answer the question, “What were the effects on these children, especially after history proved the Nazi regime to be one of the most cruel and heinous regimes in the history of the modern world?” My paper argues that in many ways the children of the Hitler Youth were as much victims as all the other victims of the Nazi regime.\n\nLosing the First World War, unemployment, the generation gap and the cult of youth led to the party of Adolf Hitler gaining popularity in the Weimar Republic. Using slogans of the restoration of a strong Germany the national socialists organized structures, which formed and educated German Youth. Hitler Youth – brought up according to the rule: “youth leads youth” – was a very fertile environment for the spread of the idea of national-socialism. The specific values – racial supremacy, honour, obedience – handed down by parents were the beginning of the Nazi indoctrination. In the later period such organizations as Bund Deutscher Madel or Hitlerjugend took power over German youth. Education, upbringing, ideological content used by the institutions in Nazi Germany are described in the extensive literature on the subject. However, very important are the experiences of individual members of the Hitler Youth that show the Nazi youth activities from a time perspective. Experiences such as...\n\nOne of the greatest mysteries of the century must be the failure of professional historians and biographers, for more than half a century after the event, to show much interest in actually explaining it. The fact that Hitler continues to be a mystery, however, is not a fact like other facts, to be recorded as a datum of history and passed over. A mystery, by definition, is the appearance of something surprising or unexpected that fairly calls out for an explanation. But, is it not one of the purposes of history (indeed, the major function of historians) to explain historical events and to make them understandable? Professional historians have consistently refused to get their hands dirty investigating the many mysteries of Hitler’s life and career by going into the field to interview witnesses. Historians have not only failed, but have been charged by fellow historians with “evading,” their duty to weave the facts of Hitler’s life and career into a coherent and comprehensible narrative."
