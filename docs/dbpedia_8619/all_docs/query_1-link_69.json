        "text": "This segment was written by Allison Harrer and edited by Karen Phinney. It is an overview of the actual Nuremberg trials, including a brief summary of each of the twenty-one Nazi officials tried. Sources used include\n\nwww.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/nuremburg/nuremburg.htm, www.facts.com/icof/nazi.htm, and G.M. Gilbert's Nuremburg Diary.\n\nShortly after WWII ended in May 1945, Allied governments jointly agreed that those responsible for wartime atrocities must be held accountable and punished for their crimes. The International Military Tribunal (IMT) was organized in the German city of Nuremberg in order to do just that. The United States, Great Britain, France, and the Soviet Union each appointed judges and supplied prosecutors to the Tribunal for the trials of high-level Nazi officials seized after the war. Prior to the Nuremberg trials, war crimes were limited to the military courts of the individual countries; \"for the first time, the concepts of collective guilt were used to justify punishment,\" (Facts On File News Services, 1997). Some 5,000 Nazi's were charged with war crimes. However, the Nuremberg trials were designed specifically to prosecute high-ranking Nazi officials with whom authority over heinous atrocities rested. The four counts of the indictment were: 1- Conspiracy to commit crimes alleged in other counts; 2- Crimes against peace; 3- War crimes; 4- Crimes against humanity. The Nuremburg trials were one of the first organized attempts to apply principles of international law, and established new precedents for the international community.\n\nGoering, Hermann: For detailed case sample see Goering page\n\nVerdict: Guilty on all four counts\n\nSentence: Death by hanging.\n\nHess, Rudolf: Hess was the deputy to the Fuhrer and Nazi Party leader. These positions endowed him with responsibilities such as handling all Party matters and gave him the authority to make decisions in Hitler's name on all questions of Party leadership. Hess signed decrees persecuting Jews and was an informed and willing participant in German aggression against Austria, Czechoslovakia, and Poland.\n\nVerdict: Guilty on counts 1 & 2.\n\nSentence: Life Imprisonment.\n\nRibbentrop, Joachim Von: Ribbentrop was the German Ambassador to England who played a significant diplomatic role in regards to aggressive plans against Czechoslovakia, Austria, the Soviet Union, and Poland. Ribbentrop also \"played an important part in Hitler's 'final solution' of the Jewish question,\" because Hitler's policies and plans coincided very closely with his own (Gilbert 438-439). He played an active role in the 'final solution' when he worked to accelerate the deportation of Jews to concentration camps in the East.\n\nVerdict: Guilty on all four counts.\n\nSentence: Death by hanging.\n\nKeitel, Wilhelm: Keitel was the Chief of Staff of the German High Command. He signed orders and planned the attacks on Poland, Czechoslovakia, Belgium, Holland, and Russia, but testified that he was opposed to the invasion of the Soviet Union. He ordered the killing of captured commandos and reprisals against the families of Allied volunteers. Attacks against soldiers in the East were ordered to be 50-100 Communists for every one German soldier, remarking \"human life [is] less than nothing in the East,\" (Gilbert 439-440). Keitel drafted the 'Night and Fog' decree that authorized the nighttime arrest and secret killing of suspected members of the resistance.\n\nVerdict: Guilty on all four counts.\n\nSentence: Death by hanging.\n\nKaltenbrunner, Ernst: Kaltenbrunner was chief of the Security Police, SD, and head of the RSHA, which meant he was also in charge of the Gestapo, the SD and the Criminal Police. RSHA, at the time, engaged in widespread crimes against humanity as well as war crimes, including mistreatment and murder of POWs, and concentration camp workers, namely Jews, commissars, and others. Under RSHA, about 6 million Jews were murdered, which established Kaltenbrunner in a leading role in the 'final solution' of the Jewish question. This included the order to have prisoners of Dachau and other camps liquidated just before camps would have been liberated by the Allies.\n\nVerdict: Guilty on counts 3 & 4.\n\nSentence: Death by hanging.\n\nRosenberg, Alfred: Rosenberg developed and spread Nazi doctrines in several newspapers, which he edited and in the books he wrote. He headed the APA, whose agents were active in Nazi intrigue all over the world. Rosenberg played an important part in planning the attack on Norway. In July 1941, Hitler appointed him as Reich Minister of the Easter Occupied Territories and stated that he \"bears a major responsibility for the formulation and execution of occupation policies in the Occupied Eastern Territories. \"He helped create policies for Germanization, exploitation, forced labor, extermination of the Jews, and knew of the horrendous and brutal treatment of Eastern peoples.\n\nVerdict: Guilty on all four counts.\n\nSentence: Death by hanging.\n\nFrank, Hans: Frank was appointed Chief Civil Administration Officer as well as Governor-General for occupied Polish territory, with the nickname \"Jew butcher of Krakow\". His plans for Poland were based on the complete exploitation of its human and economic resources, policies he was aware that caused inhumane treatment of Poles leading to starvation, slave labor, and a program involving the murder of at least 3 million Jews.\n\nVerdict: Guilty on counts 3 & 4.\n\nSentence: Death by hanging.\n\nFrick, Wilhelm: Frick was \"largely responsible for bringing the German nation under the complete control of the NSDAP,\" by drafting, signing, and administering laws that abolished all opposition parties and prepared for the Gestapo and concentration camp utilization to crush any individual opposition (Gilbert 442). Frick was very anti-Semitic and his laws reflected this and his desire to rid German life and economy of Jewish people. He also had knowledge of the systematic murdering of the insane, ill, and aged people, and did nothing to stop the process.\n\nVerdict: Guilty on counts 2, 3, & 4.\n\nSentence: Death by hanging.\n\nStreicher, Julius: Steicher was the editor ofDer Sturmer, and had a long history of anti-Semitism. He began \"calling for the annihilation of the Jewish race,\" as early as 1938. He organized a boycott of Jewish businesses on April 1, 1933, and was responsible for the destruction of a Jewish synagogue in Nuremberg on August 10, 1938 (. The tribunal stated that, \"Streitcher's incitement to murder and [mass] extermination at the time when Jews in the East were being killed under the most horrible conditions clearly constitutes persecution on political and racial grounds in connection with war crimes. and constitutes a crime against humanity,\"(Gilbert 442-443).\n\nVerdict: Guilty on count 4.\n\nSentence: Death by hanging.\n\nFunk, Walther: Funk was the Minister of Nazi economic and financial departments. He entered into an agreement with Himmler which stated that the Reichsbank would receive currency, gold, and jewels from the SS without extensive questioning. As a result, the Reichsbank was sent the personal belongings taken from the victims sent to the concentration camps. The Tribunal's opinion was that \"Funk either knew what was being received or was deliberately closing his eyes to what was being done.\"(Gilbert 443).\n\nVerdict: Guilty on counts 2, 3, & 4.\n\nSentence: Life Imprisonment. He was released in 1957 because of poor health, and died in 1959.\n\nSchacht, Baldur Von: Schacht was the Minister of Economics and Plenipotentiary General for Germany before WWII, but while in office readied Germany's economy for war. He played an important role in the rearmament program, which utilized the Reichsbank to its fullest extent. However, this is not a criminal act under the Charter. The Tribunal came to the conclusion that the evidence did not show without a reasonable doubt that Schacht carried out this rearmament as part of the Nazi plan to wage aggressive wars. He in fact spent 10 months of 1944 in a concentration camp because of suspicion he was plotting against Hitler.\n\nVerdict: Not Guilty.\n\nDoenitz, Karl: Doenitz was a German naval admiral who would eventually command the entire navy. He was chosen by Hitler to succeed him as fuehrer. Evidence does not show the he was part of the \"conspiracy to wage aggressive wars or that he prepared and initiated such wars,\"(Gilbert 444). However, he issued the Laconia Order to the German submarine fleet, which forbid rescuing enemy shipwreck survivors. Doenitz also was responsible for Hitler's Commando order, \"by which the members of an Allied motor torpedo boat were.turned over to the SD and shot.\"\n\nVerdict: Guilty on counts 2 & 3.\n\nSentence: 10 years imprisonment.\n\nRaeder, Erich: Raeder was Commander and Chief of the German Navy for 15 years, and admittied to the violation of the Versailles Treaty.

He served nine years before his release in 1955, and died in 1960.\n\nVon Schirach, Baldur: Von Schirach \"Used the Hitler Jugend to educate the German Youth 'in the spirit of Nation Socialism' and subjected them to an extensive program of Nazi propaganda. Von Schirach did not originate the policy of deporting Jews from Vienna, but participated once he had become Gauleiter of Vienna in which he made a speech that \"defended his action in having driven tens of thousands of Jews into the Ghetto of the East as contributing to European culture,\"(Gilbert 445).\n\nVerdict: Guilty on count 4.\n\nSentence: 20 years imprisonment.\n\nSauckel, Fritz: Sauckel was the Chief of Slave Labor Recruitment for the Nazi regime.

Under Hitler he was Vice-Chancellor and Ambassador to Turkey. He participated in Nazi consolidation of control in 1933, and accepted the position as Minister to Austria, with the primary purpose of bringing about the Anschluss.

Speer was one of the few men who during the closing stages of war, had the courage to tell Hitler \"that the war was lost and to take steps to prevent senseless destruction,\" (Gilbert 447).\n\nVerdict: Guilty on counts 3 & 4.\n\nSentence: 20 years imprisonment.\n\nNeurath, Konstantin Von: Neurath was the German Minister of Foreign Affairs and took part in the Hoszbach Conference on November 5, 1937. Although he resigned in 1938, he retained a formal relationship with the Nazi regime as appointed Reich Protector for Bohemia and Moravia in 1939.
