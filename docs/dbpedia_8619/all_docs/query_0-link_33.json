        "text": "Transcript\n\nNARRATOR: Youth in Hitler's Reich - the Nazi regime monopolizes them extremely effectively. The League of German Girls and the Hitler Youth offer an attractive recreation program, and a deceptive feeling of being specially chosen.\n\nADOLPH HITLER: \"In you lies the future of the nation, and of the German Reich.\"\n\nNARRATOR: Unaware, the young people are sworn to a dictator.\n\nJOHANNES KÖPPEN: \"You suddenly felt like something you had never been before, an important person with an essential task.\"\n\nNARRATOR: At first, membership is voluntary. But who wants to be the odd one out? By 1935, half of all youths are in Hitler Youth.\n\nHITLER: \"In our eyes, the German boy of the future should be slim and slender, quick like a greyhound, tough like leather, and hard like Krupp steel.\"\n\nNARRATOR: Outdoor games – a preparation for later assignments. Hitler's plans for war were well under way. When it begins in 1939, membership of the Hitler Youth becomes compulsory. Those too young for the military must serve on the home front. Six million children and youths – to replace the men in the armed forces, and to support the women. First in the fire service after bombing raids, then in anti-aircraft service, and many of the boys can hardly wait to ultimately be soldiers.\n\nWERNER GOTTSCHAU: \"I wasn't blinded, I was thrilled. I was truly enthusiastic.\"\n\nNARRATOR: Many boys in the Hitler Youth volunteer for the front.\n\nGOTTSCHAU: \"I was turned completely inside out. I was only cured a year before the surrender by the army. In three years as a soldier, I was still half a Hitler Youth boy.\n\nNARRATOR: Till the very end, the Nazi regime promises them victory. What remains is an abused generation."
