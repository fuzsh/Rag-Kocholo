        "text": "Putting their Nordic heads together to see what could be done to make The Fatherland a still more fit place for Aryan heroes, Der Führer Adolf Hitler and Minister-President Hermann Wilhelm Göring last week launched a new series of laws so super-drastic that even Germans long used to the rigors of Nazidom shuddered with apprehension. The first of these laws, framed by General Göring, imposes the death penalty on any German who “knowingly and unscrupulously, out of sheer selfishness or for other base motives, sends or leaves his money or other property abroad.” Thus Dictator Hitler last week virtually gave himself access to privately-owned German capital abroad amounting to $800,000,000, which he can convert into foreign currencies in an emergency such as war.\n\nAnother law in the new Hitler program was the conversion last week of the “voluntary” Winter Relief organization into a State foundation headed by Propaganda Minister Paul Joseph Goebbels. He at once demanded that all German citizens should give every foreign coin in their possession, English pennies, French sous and the like, to the Winter Relief.\n\nWhile these laws reached into many a German pocket, another took over the young German’s body if not his soul. Hereafter every German boy and girl, “without exception,” must join the Hitler Youth “to be trained physically, spiritually and morally.” Declared newly appointed Youth Leader of the German Reich Baldur von Schirach: “The lives of all German youths belong solely to Adolf Hitler.” At this announcement Catholics throughout Germany grew fearful, wondered if an insidious attack was being made on their religion. Nor were they much reassured when Youth Leader Schirach said: “The\n\nHitler Youth isn’t the Church and the Church isn’t the Hitler Youth.” An attack earlier last week by Air Minister Göring on “Priests and their little church God” seemed to Catholics to represent the current official attitude of Nazi chiefs toward Christianity."
