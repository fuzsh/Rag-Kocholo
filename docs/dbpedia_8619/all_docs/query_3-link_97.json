Two weeks later, on the family’s country estate in Baden-Württemberg, he waited until his mother was in bed, went to the house’s bar and systematically drank a bottle and a half of whisky in little sips.\n\nHe then stumbled into the cellar, took a shotgun from the gun cabinet and went outside to the elm tree his father had planted on the day he was born, with an African gold coin buried beneath its roots for good luck."
