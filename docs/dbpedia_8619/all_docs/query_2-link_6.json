        "text": "MUNICH, West Germany, Aug. 8 (Reuters)—Baldur von Schirach, the first leader of the Hitler Youth, who served 20 years in the Spandau Prison for his role in the deportation and execution of 50,000 Austrian Jews, died today, according to his family here. He was 67 years old.\n\nAccording to his family, the former Nazi leader, who was released in 1966, died while vacationing at the wine‐growing village of Kroev.\n\nThree sons and a daughter survive.\n\nA Favorite of Hitler By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr.\n\nWhen Hitler assumed power in 1933 and assigned Baldur von Schirach the task of organizing German young people into the Nazi mold, Mr. von Schirach was only 26 years old. But he had been a member of the Nazi party for nine years and had headed the Hitler Youth since he was 21. He was also a member of the Nazi inner circle and a Hitler favorite.\n\nThe son of a baronial German Army officer and an Amerscan‐born mother who claimed descent from a signer of the Declaration of Independence, Mr. von Schirach was a 17‐year‐old student at the University of Munich when he fell under Hitler's spell and joined the Nazi party in 1924.\n\nAlong with his sister, Rosalinde, who sang Wagnerian roles, the young student became a faithful protégé and personal friend of Hitler, who saw to his rapid advance in the party.\n\nMr. von Schirach's position was strengthened, when, in a match probably arranged by Hitler himself, he married Henrietta Hoffman, the daughter of Johannes Hoffman, a Hitler intimate who was given the photographic monopoly in Nazi Germany.\n\nAs head of the Hitler Youth from 1933 to 1940, Mr. von Schirach directed more than five million young people in the quasi‐military organization designed to create a corps of disciplined adherents to the Nazi cause.\n\nIn his seven years in the post, Mr. von Schirach's greatest problem was to displace the Roman Catholic youth movement, which stubbornly resisted his efforts until Nazi power grew overwhelming.\n\nYears later, Mr. von Schirach described his task as making German youth believe “that Hitler created the world in six days, with the seventh set aside for Hitler Youth parades.”\n\nIn 1946, when he appeared before the Nuremberg war crimes tribunal, Mr. von Schirach put a different emphasis on his role: “It is my guilt,” he said, “that I educated German youth for a man who committed murders millionfold.”\n\nBut murder was laid to Mr. Avon Schirach also. Giving up his youth post in 1940, he was made Gauleiter and Reichsstatthalter of Austria, Hitler's perso??al representative in Vienna, where Mr. von Schirach continued the mass deportation of Jews that had been begun by his predecessor, Josef Buerckel.\n\nAlthough his execution of Hitler's policy was less savage than that of the ruthless Mr. Buerckel, Mr. von Schirach put his personal stamp of approval on the policy, saying that the removal of Austrian Jews to the East would “contribute to European culture.”\n\nDenounced at the Nuremberg trials as “the poisoner of a generation,” Mr. von Schirach admitted being guilty of “crimes against humanity,” but contended that he had learned only after the war that Hitler had killed millions of Jews.\n\nMr. von Schirach, who later described Hitler as a “fabulous monster,” said he had begun to lose confidence in the Nazi leader when he made war against Poland.\n\nOf the 22 top Nazi leaders tried at Nuremberg, Mr. von Schirach was one of the seven sentenced to prison terms. (Ten were executed, three were acquitted and two committed suicide during the trials.)\n\nMr. von Schirach, who served a full 20‐year term, was releasedfrom prison in 1966, along with Albert Speer, the Nazi armaments minister, leaving Rudolf Hess, the former Hitler deputy, the lone Nazi leader at Spandau, where. Hess, now 80, is serving a life term. Besides Hess, the only other Nazi war criminal sentenced at Nuremberg still alive is Kan Doenitz, the former Navy chief and Hitler's successor, who was freed in 1956.\n\nAfter his release, Mr. von Schirach moved in with his son, Klaus, living in seclusion in a fashionable Munich suburb.\n\nLittle heard from in recent years, Mr. von Schirach turned aside requests for interviews with the explanation that because of his role under Hitler he had no right to comment on any public matters."
