Führer Adolf Hitler had a lot to thank him for, especially the media-savvy staging of German adolescents’ mass mobilisation in the Hitler Youth ( Hitlerjugend , HJ) and the League of German Girls ( Bund Deutscher Mädel , BDM). It didn’t take long for him to bring the entire system of youth organisations in Nazi Germany under the ideological control of the regime. Despite the bloody war of aggression and the persecution of Jews and other victim groups throughout Europe, as Reichsleiter and Gauleiter (Reich leader and regional leader) of Vienna he accelerated the exuberant promotion of high culture from 1940 onwards, quickly winning over the elites and many artists. With their characteristic obedience to authority, the Viennese were soon enamoured with the anti-democratic nationalist traditions he imported from Weimar. While his sometimes controversial contemporary art exhibitions brought him into conflict with the Berlin central departments and Adolf Hitler, plans to replace him could not be pushed through. Schirach had already become one of the central satraps of National Socialism and had at his disposal a skilful propaganda machine. At the same time, however, Baldur von Schirach is also representative of an aristocratic-bourgeois elite that aligned itself with National Socialism. But for a few exceptions in the military resistance, this class promoted the movement and ultimately supported the regime until its total collapse.\n\nSchirach’s father, as the director of the Grand Duchy and Court Theatre in Weimar, was a member of a bourgeois German nationalist elite in the town of Goethe and Schiller, a town that had also honoured Nietzsche and Liszt but had already become German nationalist, anti-democratic and in many ways nationalist-anti-Semitic prior to the First World War. This elite saw in the Weimar Republic its arch-enemy. It was in Weimar of all places that the National Assembly spent months discussing and finally determining the new democratic constitution from February 1919 onwards; this only intensified its rejection by the traditional elites and played a large role in shaping Baldur von Schirach’s authoritarian and extremely nationalist understanding of politics. Yearning for a return to the monarchy was soon replaced by the search for a new, strong nationalist dictatorship – from 1925–26 onwards, Hitler became a saviour figure for the Schirachs.\n\nWhile Baldur von Schirach briefly met Hitler twice in 1925, he soon came to project a particular reverence onto the former private, who had not been an officer but had nevertheless received the Iron Cross First Class. This veneration of Hitler as a veteran of the First World War clearly reflects Schirach’s formative experiences growing up in a family of officers. He joined various anti-democratic and nationalist youth defence groups before becoming a member of the NSDAP and the SA at the age of eighteen. His father, formerly the cavalry captain (Rittmeister) of a prestigious regiment of the imperial Guards Cuirassiers in Berlin, soon followed him in joining the NSDAP and becoming a founding member of the anti-Semitic Militant League for German Culture (Kampfbund für Deutsche Kultur).\n\nAfter a meteoric rise in the National Socialist German Students’ League (Nationalsozialistischer Deutscher Studentenbund) from 1927 onwards, Baldur von Schirach became a member of Hitler’s inner circle. In 1931 he advanced to Reichsjugendführer, directly under the highest level of SA leadership. He married Henriette, the daughter of Hitler’s wealthy personal photographer Heinrich Hoffmann, thereby cementing an even closer connection to the Führer. He artfully made use of his propaganda skills, landing his first great marketing hit with the pictorial volume Hitler wie ihn keiner kennt (Hitler as No One Knows Him), which he edited together with his father-in-law: Schirach made Hitler familiar to both a bourgeois and a more common public. He became the youngest member of the Reichstag in 1931, the NSDAP being the parliamentary group with the highest proportion of aristocrats, and surprised Hitler with a Reich Youth Party Congress in Potsdam attended by 70,000 enthusiastic participants.\n\nBy 1936, Schirach had already recruited around six million adolescents to the Hitler Youth – always with the trick of adolescent self-administration but with clear ideological, National Socialist goals, which were partially communicated in playful form, but always in disciplined and controlled structures. The Hitler Youth increasingly received rights enabling it to function as an instrument of surveillance in the schools.\n\nBut Schirach wanted more, striving for total control of the adolescent education system and schools. However, he lost this battle with the education bureaucracy. His transfer to Vienna was already the beginning of his political demise, but to the mounting ire of Propaganda Minister Goebbels, with whom he had originally had an amicable relationship, Schirach built up a cultural empire, courting Richard Strauss and his Jewish daughter-in-law Alice as well as the writer Gerhart Hauptmann.\n\nThe extent to which Schirach actually warned Hitler about attacking the Soviet Union or war with the USA will be debated, as will the conflict between Hitler and Henriette von Schirach at the Berghof concerning the brutal deportation of the Jews from the Netherlands. At the same time, Schirach boasted about deporting the Viennese Jews (I have made Vienna free of Jews), much to the annoyance of Goebbels, who feared negative international reactions. Schirach also announced he would make Vienna free of Czechs – and indeed the Gestapo began to keep files to that end.\n\nSchirach certainly had political ambitions far beyond his Gau (administrative region of the Reich): for instance, in 1941 he skilfully used the propaganda campaign surrounding the 150th anniversary of the death of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart to propagate a European ideology under German leadership in an effort to legitimise in the long term the occupation of large swathes of Europe, an occupation he sought to underpin with cultural hegemony. Here he intensified his old contacts with the Italian Fascist youth leaders and organised European youth congresses and journalists’ meetings. Ultimately, Hitler wanted to have Schirach replaced, since the latter did not wish to defend Vienna as a bastion. However, the Führer didn’t dare take this measure, since Schirach had a firm hold on the city in terms of cultural policy and ultimately did switch very swiftly to the course of military defence. Schirach escaped from the Red Army at the last minute, not without ensuring his art treasures, many of them stolen from Jews, were moved westwards from his Aryanised villa on the Hohe Warte hill in Döbling from 1944 onwards.\n\nEmploying a skilful defence strategy during the Nuremberg trials in 1946, he escaped the threat of execution, his aristocratic-bourgeois and partly American origins proving an advantage along with his willingness to accept responsibility for his role as Reichsjugendführer while also downplaying its importance as an ideological and military preparatory organisation. His memories and reflections of 1967 concerning the causes and consequences of National Socialism, the role of Hitler and other National Socialist actors, and the Shoah (Holocaust) and anti-Semitism are subjected to critical inspection, using both his original interview transcripts and new source material in addition to extensive studies – not least in Vienna’s only surviving Gau Press Archive.\n\nThe central question remains: to what extent is the usually suppressed ideological prehistory of German society in the Empire and its aristocratic-bourgeois elites prior to 1914 an essential factor explaining the potency and duration of the National Socialists’ unjust regime? The initial turbo-globalisation, industrialisation and internal European migration saw, besides the innovation of early Modernism, a boom in anti-Semitic racial and conspiracy theories that exploded in aggressive fashion after the end of the First World War. Its elite protagonists, including Carl von Schirach, his intellectual and artistic circles and his son Baldur, then permanently attacked parliamentary democracy and the Weimar Republic with all they had. This intensive erosion emanating from bourgeois right-wing conservative networks was a central precondition for the success of the NSDAP before and after 1933. The demon of Weimar that had made Goethe and Schiller its political prisoners and misused them for its murderous ideologies is an important prerequisite for Hitler’s appointment as Reich chancellor (Reichskanzler). He was long idolised by members of the ‘old’ imperial and bourgeois elites, as demonstrated by his early visit to the Schirach residency in 1925. The system’s rapid stabilisation after the National Socialists came to power despite many clear breaches of the law and acts of terrorism cannot be understood without this other cultural history of the German Empire of which the Schirachs are symbolic.\n\nUnlike examinations of the National Socialist regime’s key decision-makers and Hitler’s satraps such as Heinrich Himmler, Joseph Goebbels, Hermann Göring and Albert Speer, studies on Baldur von Schirach are shaky and somewhat patchy. The first comprehensive biography, Baldur von Schirach, Hitlers Jugendführer (Baldur von Schirach, Hitler’s Youth Leader) by Michael Wortmann, appeared in 1982 as the basis of a doctoral thesis, and the revisionist retort by Schirach’s former press officer Günter Kaufmann in 1993 was quite rightly largely ignored. Stefanie Hundehege’s doctoral thesis of 2017, Writing the Nazi Movement. The Poetry of Baldur von Schirach, focusing on Schirach as a poet and literary figure, is still unavailable, but excerpts can be read in the form of articles.\n\nNevertheless, there is not a single study on the National Socialist period in Vienna from 1940–45 that does not touch on Baldur von Schirach – be it with respect to the Hitler Youth or the evacuation of children to the countryside, or in the recent study of National Socialist art theft. A recent prior study on the Aryanisation of works of art and the role of Baldur and Henriette von Schirach has been produced by Theresa Sepp within the framework of the Central Institute of Art History in Munich.\n\nOn the basis of the many years I have spent researching National Socialist cultural and anti-cultural policy since my book Führertreu und gottbegnadet (Loyal to the Führer and Divinely Gifted) (1991) and drawing on recent studies in the framework of the full-text digitalisation of Schirach’s entire National Socialist Gau Press Archive, I have attempted to provide a critical examination not only of Baldur von Schirach but also of his family background from the Weimar years onwards. I also consider the period after 1945.\n\nThe question of Baldur von Schirach’s guilt – ultimately central to the present and the future – is re-qualified. To this end I use hitherto unseen documents and insights into the extent of his knowledge about the Shoah – as early as 1942 – and his hitherto unreflected role in the brutal persecution of so-called asocial people (Asoziale) in Vienna from 1940 onwards.\n\nOne of Schirach’s grandchildren, the former defence lawyer and worldrenowned writer Ferdinand von Schirach, provided his own answer with unmistakable clarity in Der Spiegel in 2011:\n\nWhat my grandfather did is something quite different altogether. His crimes were organised, they were systematic, cold and precise. They were planned at a desk, there were memoranda on them, discussions, and he repeatedly made his own decisions. The deportation of the Jews from Vienna was his contribution to European culture, he said at the time. Such a statement renders all further questions, all psychology superfluous. Sometimes a person’s guilt is so great that everything else is irrelevant. Of course, the state itself was criminal, but that does not excuse people like him, since they themselves created this state. My grandfather did not break through a thin ceiling of civilisation; his decisions were not an accident, not a coincidence, not negligence.1\n\nI would especially like to thank two people for their support in the realisation of this book project: Dr Johannes Sachslehner, who as a successful non-fiction writer in the field of contemporary history and an experienced editor had the initial idea and assisted with its realisation and the editing of the illustrations throughout, and Agnes Meisinger, who combed through the manuscript and proofs with a critical eye, offering corrections and asking many important questions. Special personal thanks are due my wife, Dr Lydia Rathkolb, who made the intensive work and research periods possible while always keeping me grounded in real life.\n\nIn the course of the research, I received assistance from many colleagues, most notably Daniela Ebenbauer, Dr Wolfgang Form, Jutta Fuchshuber, Michael Hetz, Johann Kirchknopf, Dr Andreas Kranebitter, Dr Petra Mayrhofer, Dr Christoph Mentschl, Renate Moszkowicz, Prof. Dr Bertrand Perz, Dr Hans Petschar, Prof. Dr Peter Roessler, Prof. Markus Stumpf, Prof. Sybille Steinbacher, Christine von Unruh and Prof. Dr Kerstin von Lingen. Ford E. Robertson, Marie Schwieterman Robertson and Agnes Meisinger offered helpful perspectives on the manuscript.\n\nFor an important background discussion I thank the retired lawyer Dr Klaus von Schirach and Ferdinand von Schirach, who allowed me to access the preliminary study he initiated, the Vorstudie zur Rekonstruktion des Kunst-und Kulturguts (Preliminary Study in Reconstructing Artistic and Cultural Property) reconstructing the artistic and cultural property of Baldur and Henriette von Schirach.\n\nChapter 1\n\nFrom Bull Run to the Grand Duchy and Court Theatre\n\nThe Schirach Family on their Way to Weimar\n\nBaldur von Schirach was an omnipresent figure throughout the Third Reich. The youth movement of the ‘brown revolution’ bore his signature. In his own mind, he actually considered himself a revolutionary – as a bustling brown-shirt ‘fixer’, bonded to his revered Adolf Hitler for better or for worse. He had been catapulted to the pinnacle of politics by a remarkable meteoric rise in the shadow of the Führer: Baldur von Schirach, born 1907, became a member of the NSDAP in 1925, at age of eighteen. From 1927 onwards, he wore the brown shirt of the SA, the movement’s Sturmabteilung . In 1928, the young man from Weimar, beyond the political sphere a writer of clumsy poetry, took on the position of Reichsführer of the National Socialist German Students’ League, became Reichsjugendführer in 1931, and Jugendführer of the German Reich in 1933 in his capacity as a secretary of state. He was able to establish himself in the inner circle of power despite the fact that to the long-serving party members, the iron eaters from the Freikorps and beer cellars, he seemed something of an errant aristocrat. 2\n\nFor a long time, he was highly appreciated by Hitler and Goebbels too, since he presented the Führer as they liked to see him: as the father of his loyal and beloved people.3 Hitler’s image was to a large extent the work of his young paladin Schirach. Shortly after serving briefly on the Western Front, in August 1940 Baldur von Schirach was sent by Hitler to Vienna as Reichsstatthalter and Gauleiter. He nevertheless remained NSDAP Reichsleiter for Youth Education and tasked with overseeing the Hitler Youth, and retained supreme responsibility for National Socialist youth policy, even after his deputy Artur Axmann became Reichsjugendführer. Hitler’s plan was that Schirach would win over the hearts of the Viennese, a role the latter interpreted in the most peculiar manner: while the ‘Viennese culture’ he promoted enjoyed great success on the stages of the city’s concert halls and theatres and he made great efforts to prove himself on the level of European diplomacy, the wagons rolled out of Aspang station to the death camps in the East and those men and women who dared resist the National Socialist terror regime died at the Regional Court gallows. While Schirach did not wish to see the bloody work of the executioner, he was happy to announce that the city had become free of Jews under his aegis. When he was supposed to defend Vienna against the advancing Red Army in the spring of 1945, he soon demonstrated he was not up to the task, leaving ‘his’ Hitler Youth to counter the Russian tanks. His less heroic flight from the battle for Vienna led to the gloomy isolation of a prison cell in Berlin-Spandau via the dock at the Nuremberg trials …\n\nThree-quarters American\n\nIf we consider the extant autobiographical sources on Baldur von Schirach, their overlaps are just as important as their omissions and proven departures from the historical facts. A comprehensive authorised autobiographical document is the official nine-page self-portrait he penned when appointed Reichsstatthalter and Gauleiter in Vienna on 8 August 1940.4 Some of it matches the data assembled by Schirach’s autobiography Ich glaubte an Hitler (I Believed in Hitler) (1967), ghostwritten by two journalists who interviewed him.5 The document of 1940 does not mention a word about his mother’s American background, however.\n\nHis father, Carl Baily Norris von Schirach (1873–1948), had been a US citizen before joining the Guards Cuirassiers in Berlin. In 1908 he left military service and was appointed general director of the Grand Duchy and Court Theatre in Weimar. Baldur’s great-grandfather Karl Benedikt von Schirach (1790–1864) had emigrated to the USA in 1855, and his grandfather Friedrich Karl von Schirach (1842–1917) became a major in the US Army. Friedrich Karl married the American Elisabeth Baily Norris (1833–73) from Baltimore, Maryland. Baldur von Schirach’s mother, Emma Middleton Lynah Tillou (1872–1944) was also from the USA, from Chestnut Hill, a suburb of Philadelphia. In his tabular CV of 1940, he also omitted to mention that until the age of six he had grown up in an exclusively English-speaking environment and went to school a year later than he was supposed to in order to become fluent in German in preparation.\n\nIn 1939, Max von Schirach, a cousin of Baldur’s, published an extensive family history,6 complete with details of their connections to the USA. This clearly didn’t fit with National Socialist propaganda however, since the official long CV from the National Socialist era doesn’t mention the family’s close ties to the USA. It was only in his memoirs that he dared to relate more about his American family members.\n\nNor was there any mention of his parents’ entirely aristocratichegemonial circumstances. The Schirachs’ luxurious lifestyle was also a bone of contention within the family, as evident in a letter of 1897:\n\nMadame Filou, as Hermann7 calls her – her surname is Middleton Tillou – did not make a favourable impression, despite being attired in a fragrant summer suit with fine embroidery and being a grande dame, comme il faut. Well, Karl isn’t any better either and no longer makes an effort in the company of dukes, princes, counts and barons as far as his manners are concerned. Sport, racing and expensive horses are otherwise pretty much all he is interested in, and although he has a fair fortune, around 200,000 dollars, he will soon be shot of it.8\n\nBaldur von Schirach’s father, Carl Baily, after taking his Abitur (final exams at the grammar school) in Lübeck, became an officer in the regiment of the Gardes du Corps No. 1, headed by Kaiser and King Wilhelm II. While visiting relatives in the USA, he met his later wife Emma Middleton Lynah Tillou, whom he married in Chestnut Hill in 1896.\n\nOn her mother’s side, she came from one of the richest families in the Southern states, owners of several plantations. Emma’s great-grandfather Henry Middleton (1717–84), for instance, owned twenty plantations with a total 200 square kilometres and around 800 slaves. He was a successful cotton and rice planter, exporting around 83 million tons of the latter in 1770,9 but he was also a committed politician. Middleton held several offices, ultimately becoming one of the most important figures in anti-British politics in the colonies. He was elected South Carolina’s representative in the First Continental Congress, of which he was president in 1774–75. Henry’s first-born son Arthur Middleton (1742–87), who like his father was a member of the First Continental Congress, inherited the property Middleton Place from his mother and together with other delegates from South Carolina signed the United States’ Declaration of Independence in the Congress in 1776. During the War of Independence he spent some time in British captivity.\n\nHenry Middleton, known as the Colonial Gentleman, had impressive gardens built by slaves in 1741 on a bow in the Ashley River, 12 miles upstream from Charleston. Today it is one of the oldest in the USA and a National Historic Landmark.10 His grandson, Henry Middleton (1770–1846), was governor of South Carolina from 1810 to 1812 and served as the US ambassador to the tsar’s court in St Petersburg from 1820 to 1830.11\n\nIn 1865, towards the end of the Civil War, the Middleton family’s grand buildings, the gardens and the cotton plantations were destroyed by General Sherman’s Union troops and all the slaves were freed. Further destruction was caused by an earthquake in 1886. A wing of the threestorey main house remained intact; today it serves as a museum.\n\nQuite in the spirit of these family traditions, in Weimar Carl von Schirach had a stately home with a housekeeper, a cook, a silver servant and other staff.12 In contrast, Baldur’s grandfather Friedrich Karl, known to his family only as Fritz, led a rather spartan existence as a former officer who had fought for the North in the American Civil War under the name Frederick C(harles) von Schirach. As a first lieutenant he was severely wounded in the second battle at Bull Run, Virginia, on 29 August 1862 and only survived due to the partial amputation of his right leg.13 He served in the guard of honour as the murdered US President Abraham Lincoln lay in state in 1865; he had a job keeping mourners from attempting to cut off a piece of the shroud.14 A year later, he reentered active service with a leg made of cork, and in 1867 he was made a captain for gallant and meritorious services during the war. He retired in 1870 and received the title Major Retired, US Army in 1904. A hero of the Northern states who remained an American citizen throughout his life, he married Elizabeth Baily Norris in St Paul’s Church in Chestnut Hill in 1869. Elizabeth was the daughter of the successful railway pioneer Richard Norris, who had become famous for his legendary locomotive, the George Washington. In February 1871, Friedrich Karl von Schirach returned to Germany with his family. His wife Elisabeth died in 1873, shortly after the birth of their son Carl, in Wiesbaden.\n\nIn his autobiographical sketch of 1940, Baldur von Schirach only briefly describes his childhood and adolescence in Weimar. These years would play a key role in his defence at the International Military Court in Nuremberg in 1946, however, although he completely reinterpreted the ideological influences to which he was exposed.\n\nTo understand why he actively sought to get close to Adolf Hitler and National Socialism so soon, it is necessary to take a closer look at the contradictions in his versions of events and his recollections. They show that the ideological influences had already firmly taken root before he met Hitler in person in 1925. Let us thus examine his personal milieu in Weimar in greater detail.\n\nBaldur von Schirach was born at home at Blücherstrasse 17 in Berlin-Kreuzberg on 9 May 1907 before the family moved to Weimar. The apartment was close to his father’s workplace, the barracks of the Guards Cuirassiers Regiment at Tempelhofer Feld, where Carl Baily Norris was a first lieutenant (Oberleutnant) and later a Schwadrons-Chef before retiring as a cavalry captain (Rittmeister). He had begun his military career in the First Baden Leib-Dragoner-Regiment (dragoon regiment of the local ruler) in Karlsruhe.\n\nHis mother Emma enjoyed Berlin, as Schirach relates in his memoirs;15 Kaiser Wilhelm II used to converse with her in English at receptions. He writes that she later found Weimar confined and provincial in comparison to Berlin, but especially hated the stiff ceremony at the grand ducal court, from which there was no escape – her father was, after all, the grand ducal chamberlain. As such, he often had to attend official events in the traditional court garb consisting of dark-green tails, knickerbockers, a dagger and a bicorne, a masquerade that became a source of great entertainment to the three children Rosalind, Karl and Baldur."
