        "text": "47\n\nHitler, in Schirach's Die Fahne der Verfplaten, is no longer\n\nthe kindly dispenser of desserts, but the political and\n\nspiritual savior of Germany. The author's intent,\n\nnonetheless, is still the same â€” to inspire the\n\nFiihrerprinzip within the reader. Schirach's poetry\n\npropagated amongst the members of the HJ the Hitlerian\n\npersonality cult that Ian Kershaw designated as the \"Hitler\n\nmyth,\" in which \"the person of the Fuhrer, as the focal point\n\nof basic consensus, formed a crucial integral force in the\n\nNazi system of rule.\"23 His poems, with their dramatic\n\nexaltation of Hitler and the Nazi Party, became a literary\n\nequivalent of the histrionic party rallies organized by the\n\nNSDAP that were \"conducted with the passion of revivalist\n\nmeetings\" in which Hitler attained the role \"of 'political\n\nmissionary' and prophet.\"24\n\nAlbert Speer asserted that Schirach's artistic works\n\nwere simply the works of a political \"functionary\" whose\n\npoetic muse was utterly dependent upon his infatuation with\n\nHitler. Speer, while imprisoned along with Schirach after\n\nthe Nuremberg Trials, concluded that\n\nSometimes I think about what importance his writing, his\n\npoetry, had for him. He was always one of the leading\n\nlyric poets of the Third Reich. But is he writing\n\nanything here? .... In Schirach's case it rather\n\nseems to me that his poetry was merely doing his\n\n23 Ian Kershaw, The \"Hitler Mvth:\" Image and Reality in\n\nthe Third Rairh (Oxford: Oxford U. P., 1987), 1.\n\n24 Ibid., 42."
