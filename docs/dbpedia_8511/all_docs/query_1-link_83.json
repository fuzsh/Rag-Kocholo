        "text": "Burying them deep with Ghoultown\n\nWelcome to the wild west, no holds barred here,\n\nbut be warned! If you mess around,\n\nthe rope might be the next and last thing\n\nyou´ll ever see!\n\nThis interview was made with\n\nCount Lyle of Ghoultown\n\nWho am I speaking to? Briefly introduce yourself\n\nand tell us more about you.\n\n- I’m Count Lyle, I am the founder,\n\nvocalist and main songwriter for the band.\n\nI’ve played in several types of bands in the past which included the horror punk project, The Killcreeps,\n\na cult-classic doom metal band called Solitude Aeturnus\n\nand played guitar briefly for GG Allin – back when\n\nI was in high school, believe it or not.\n\nThe story of Ghoultown, you have been wondering\n\nin the deserts since 1999. More details about the birth of your band?\n\n- While doing The Killcreeps back in ‘96,\n\nwe started writing some dark western songs which had a cool feel\n\nand a lot of unique personality. When we disbanded The Killcreeps,\n\nI wanted to do a band based on those dark western songs\n\nand came up with the name Ghoultown for it.\n\nWe started out in ’99, sort of making up our own sound\n\nand image as we went. Sort of a mixture of rock, country,\n\npsychobilly and metal. Since then we’ve done five CDs,\n\nbeen on five movie soundtracks, a short film,\n\nseveral compilations, put out a comic book, and toured\n\nthe U.S. several times. You can find Ghoultown poster art\n\nin several rock and roll poster books and even in the\n\nVampire Masquerade: Bloodlines PC game.\n\nHow would you describe your sound to the common people?\n\n- That’s the hardest question, since Ghoultown\n\nhas such a unique sound which brings in so\n\nmany musical elements. It’s so far off the map\n\nof typical music in any genre that critics and fans\n\n– and even ourselves – have trouble coming up\n\nwith a simple description. I think it gives people a\n\ngood idea when we say\n\n‘Ghoultown sits somewhere in the middle ground\n\nbetween Johnny Cash and Rob Zombie’.\n\nAt least people seems to get a mental picture of it that way.\n\nThere seems to be a huge explosion going on in the psychobilly,\n\ngothabilly scene. Lots of ghoul stuff coming out,\n\nhow is the scene in your local area?\n\n- Not too bad, but it could be better.\n\nThere’s lots of good bands out of Texas like Flametrick Subs,\n\nShadow Reichenstein, Spitfire Tumbleweeds,\n\nand The Von Ehrics, but the support,\n\nat least in Dallas, is sporadic. For example,\n\nBlizkid came through a little while back and there were\n\nonly about 10 people there. It was disgraceful.\n\nSame thing happened to our friends The Independents\n\nwhen they played here last.\n\nTalking about bands, what has inspired you musically, literally etc.\n\n- Growing up, especially in Texas, some of the first music\n\nI was exposed to was country and western.\n\nNot what they call country today\n\n– which is more like pop music - but the classics like Marty Robbins,\n\nJohnny Cash, Waylon, Willie, Merle Haggard\n\nand all those outlaw guys. My parents were into it,\n\nso that stuff was always playing when I was a kid.\n\nBy junior high school I discovered rock and then punk,\n\nmetal and goth as it went on,\n\nso I started playing those types of music.\n\nYears later, when I formed Ghoultown,\n\nI sort of rediscovered the old gunfighter tales\n\nof Marty Robbins and dark moods of Johnny Cash,\n\nwhich were basically my roots.\n\nI guess I couldn’t totally escape those early influences.\n\nWith Ghoultown, I wanted to modernize those old western\n\nbeats and lyrics, so I mixed it in with my\n\nlove of punk and metal.\n\nOut of that you get Ghoultown.\n\nI’m also into old horror movies and spaghetti westerns,\n\nso that has a big influence the band as well in both the music and the image.\n\nLet´s talk more about your music,\n\nlast year you released \"BURY THEM DEEP\"\n\ntell our readers more about it, recording process, etc.\n\n- It was actually a very long process.\n\nWe started recording the songs in early 2005\n\nand finished a first mix around the summer\n\nof that year. At the time we had stopped\n\nplaying live and were taking a break\n\nfrom everything but the recording.\n\nUp until then we had been putting\n\nout all of our music on our own label,\n\nwhich had become a real pain in the ass,\n\nso we decided not to release the songs\n\nfrom “Bury Them Deep” at all.\n\nLuckily, a new Texas label called Zoviet Records,\n\nwho have always been huge fans of Ghoultown,\n\noffered to sign us and release it.\n\nThey also talked us into letting them remix the songs\n\nand recording one more for it.\n\nChris Telkes, the guitarist for Nocturne,\n\ndid a remix at his home studio and it sounded great.\n\nNow we got excited, having a good sounding album and a label,\n\nso we got Dan Brereton’s artwork\n\n– Dan is also a fan of Ghoultown and was so cool to let us use his art –\n\nand Zoviet finally released “Bury Them Deep” in October of 2006,\n\na year and half after we started the recording.\n\nIt has received great reviews and feedback from our fans,\n\nso we’ve been playing a lot of live shows around the Texas area\n\nto promote it.\n\nWe also shot a video for the song “Bury Them Deep”\n\nwhich is available on our website at www.ghoultown.com\n\nYour music has also appeared in couple of movies (American Nightmare and Headcheese),\n\nhow did this opportunity rise from the grave?\n\n- When I first put up our website back in ‘99,\n\na guy emailed me saying how cool he thought\n\nour band was. Later, he just happened to turn up as\n\nmusic director for American Nightmare.\n\nHe played our first EP - which is all we had out back then -\n\nfor the director Jon Keeyes.\n\nJon loved it and wanted us on the soundtrack.\n\nHe also came out to one of our shows and after\n\nseeing us live,he wrote us into the movie.\n\nWe have a cameo playing “Boots of Hell” at a Halloween party.\n\nThe cast has Debbie Rochon and a cameo by Brinke Stevens,\n\nso it’s cool to be in a movie with scream queens like that.\n\nAfter American Nightmare, Jon wanted us to do more\n\nsoundtrack material for him.\n\nWe cut “Legend of Everett Sykes” for Hallow’s End.\n\nThe song came out so cool, that we released it as a\n\nbonus track on our “Live From Texas!” CD.\n\nWe also contributed to Suburban Nightmare,\n\nwhich is a twisted story about a serial killing couple.\n\nWe did a song called “Killin’s a Bitch” for it,\n\nwhich plays over the ending credits.\n\nHeadcheese is one of our favorites.\n\nThose guys are from Austin, Texas\n\nand were Ghoultown fans.\n\nWhen they did their short film, they asked if they could use\n\n“Killer In Texas”.\n\nIt sounded cool, so I let ‘em use it.\n\nTurned out great.\n\nMoving into touring, you´ve toured with some great acts such as:\n\nBlitzkid, Rocket from the Crypt, Rock City Morgue etc. Best shows?\n\n- There’s been a lot of great shows.\n\nWe did one with both Blitzkid and Rock City Morgue\n\nin Johnsonville, TN. The show sucked,\n\nbut the hotel that we were put up at was the\n\nmost hilarious dump we’d ever seen.\n\nIt was falling apart and some of the rooms looked\n\nlike an adobe prison cell with no windows or\n\neven a locking door.\n\nWe had more fun laughing at all the different rooms.\n\nAs far as live shows, some of my favorites have to be the ones\n\nwhere we had special guests on stage.\n\nJerry from the Misfits performed with us once and\n\nKing Diamond got up and sang “Killer in Texas”\n\nat a show in Dallas.\n\nThose are some of my heroes, so it’s definitely cool.\n\nAre there plans to tour in Europe?\n\nI´m pretty sure that is a audience waiting for you.\n\n- We do get a lot of CD orders and fan mail from\n\nEurope and we’ve been trying to get that going for years,\n\nbut we are a bunch of broke-ass Texas musicians\n\nand have no idea how to arrange a tour in Europe.\n\nWe had a European label, but they weren’t even\n\nwilling to fly us over. If any European promoters\n\nwant to help us book a tour, then we are willing,\n\nwe just haven’t found one yet.\n\nAbout your fanbase, is there are alot of rockabillys or is it a wider spread of genres?\n\n- Our fanbase is made up of all kinds of music fans,\n\nso rockabilly types are only a part of it.\n\nOur shows attract punks, metal heads, psychobillies,\n\ngoths, and hellbilly fans.\n\nI like that our music brings together a cross-section of people.\n\nI listen to all kinds of music and go to all kinds of shows,\n\nso I’m proud when our band can transcend labels and genres.\n\nNew year, new tricks, what is next with Ghoultown? New album perhaps?\n\n- I am working on demos for the next CD now which will be called “Life After Sundown”.\n\nI’m almost done… with only two songs to go before I’m finished.\n\nI usually demo them on my multi-track recorder and\n\nthen give them to the guys to learn.\n\nOnce we start playing the songs together, then they really take shape.\n\nI’m excited because we have some really great songs for the next one.\n\nThere’s no recording schedule or release date planned right now,\n\nit will just depend on how soon we learn the material and are happy with everything.\n\nOtherwise, we are just playing shows to promote “Bury Them Deep.”\n\nWe took off from playing live for over two years,\n\nso it’s just cool to be back playing shows for our fans.\n\nPlease share your last words. Fangs and good luck with Ghoultown!\n\nCheck us out and hear Ghoultown for yourself at:\n\nwww.ghoultown.com or\n\nwww.myspace.com/ghoultown\n\nThanks for the interview!\n\nAll text contained herein; © 2006-2007 Talesfromtheshadows.
