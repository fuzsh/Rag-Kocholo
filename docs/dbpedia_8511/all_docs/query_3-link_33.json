(used to be)Great Danzig/Misfits-influenced band from California's famous East Bay.\n\nAgnostic Front-New York Hard Core legends. These guys were there at the start. If you don't know who they are, you're retarded and you really need to check out their site.\n\nANTiSEEN-The long time veterans of southern scum punk. Founding fathers of the Confederacy Of Scum and friends of the late GG Allin. These guys are legendary.\n\nThe Apers-Poppunk rock n roll from the Netherlands.

Yet another site that I have not personally visited.\n\nThe Drama Queens-Drunken rock n roll from southern Virginia that is heavily influenced by the cheap beer they consume and the wrestling they watch on TV. They combine these elements in a very exciting live show. Check 'Em out!!!\n\nThe Dwarves-Possibly the sleaziest band in rock n roll. They've faked death, ripped off a record company and pissed off millions world wide....what more can you ask for?!?!\n\nThe Easys- Rock N Roll band with Russell Quan and Jason from Just Add Water Records.\n\nElectric Frankenstein-Great rock n roll band.
