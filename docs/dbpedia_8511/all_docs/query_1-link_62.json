        "text": "Roger Alan Wade has something to prove. Why would anyone who has penned songs for country music’s royalty such as Johnny Cash, Waylon Jennings, George Jones, Hank Williams Jr. and others have anything to prove? A bit of a history lesson may be in order here.\n\nOnce upon a time, Wade worked in Nashville writing songs for other folks to record. Hank Williams, Jr. took his song “Country State of Mind” to number one back in 1986 and garnered Wade three gold records and one platinum. When Nashville stopped making country music around the early ’90s, where was a guy like Roger to go? For years he played for next to nothing in honky-tonks and clubs entertaining anybody who would listen. Then in 2005, Wade’s All Likkered Up became the first release on the independent label Johnny Knoxville Records.\n\nConsisting mainly of novelty songs with a satirical nod to rednecks and honky-tonk culture, All Likkered Up brought Wade to a global audience. The tracks “If You’re Gonna Be Dumb” and “BB Gun” were featured in the highly successful “Jackass” films/video game and MTV’s “Wildboyz” TV series. But there were a few songs on it like “Sweet Wine of Sorrow” or the heartfelt “Johnny Cash has Died” that showcased Wade’s ability to stretch out in a more serious direction.\n\nIn 2009, Wade released Stoned Traveler, another solid album with about a 50/50 balance of novelty songs and more traditional singer-songwriter material. Stoned Traveler included “D.R.U.N.K.” which appeared in the MTV show “Nitro Circus”.\n\nThen in 2010 Wade released his masterpiece, Deguello Motel.\n\nThe inspiration for Deguello Motel may have been thirty years of hard living, but the approach was a sober one. The first challenge was for Roger Alan Wade to get sober. (He did.) The second challenge was to see if he could write a song that way.(He can.) But that wasn’t enough for Wade. He had something to prove. “He was good till he kicked the drinking and drugs” is how the cliche goes. Years of prejudice and misguided notions were waiting to be quashed. Wade quashed them, and then kept moving. He wasn’t satisfied proving the notions wrong, he wanted to prove that the opposite was right.\n\nAfter hearing Deguello Motel Wade’s fans started asking, “Is this the same guy who wrote ‘Poontang’? Deguello Motel catches people looking the other way. You keep waiting for the next song to be the goofy one, and it never comes, adding gravity to the songs, making you perk up and pay attention saying, “This is serious stuff.”\n\nAll this talk of sobriety may have you thinking Wade lost his edge. On the contrary, Deguello Motel is like fighting fire with fire, and telling the hard, cold, ugly truth, with a poet’s wit and wisdom. The album is a catharsis, with the lyrics like toxins being purged out in all their candid rawness bringing Wade out of the shadow of being Johnny Knoxville’s cousin or a writer of silly songs, and into the company of people like Guy Clark and Townes Van Zandt as a premier songwriter.\n\nIn 2011 Wade reached back into his bag of novelty songs one more time and released Too Fat to Fly. Kicking off with the title track, which is based on the dispute between Southwest Airlines and film director Kevin Smith, Wade trades in the bleakness of Deguello Motel for more irreverent humor. More exposure came with “Party in My Pants,” which was featured in the film Jackass 3-D.\n\nThe best moment of this brief album comes at the end with the masterful tune “The Sun Don’t Shine on the Same Dog’s Ass Everyday,” which, if you believe the story, was pitched to Cash, Waylon, Willie, Bob Dylan, Neil Diamond, and others, all in the hopes of Wade being able to afford a box of jelly-filled donuts for his cousin Knoxville’s birthday!\n\nWade has appeared on “The Jimmy Kimmel Show” and “Howard Stern Show” and Johnny Knoxville and Wade launched their own weekly radio show “Big Ass Happy Family Jubilee” on Sirius/XM Satellite’s Outlaw Channel.\n\nIn December 2011, Wade launched his Official Facebook Fan Page www.facebook.com/RogerAlanWadeMusic with a special gift for his fans. When friend, fan and Jackass Star Ryan Dunn tragically died in an accident earlier in the year, Wade wrote the hauntingly beautiful tribute “The Light Outshines the Star”. Wade gave the song away for free too his Facebook fans as a gift from Dunn and “all the Jackasses that love him”. The response has been overwhelming.\n\n2012 is gearing up to be a big year for Wade. The next CD titled “The Last Request of Elijah Rose” is a prequel to Deguello Motel. Roger states, “This album is more about foreboding than darkness. You will feel the storm coming. It’s about the journey in, when you’re young and everything seems like it’s going to go as you planned. And then, man, it just don’t sing your song no more for some reason. You hit a time when it tests your mettle. You either come out on the other side or you don’t. What’s tantalizing is that I can hear it, I can feel the weather change and I can feel all the characters involved in it.”\n\nWhether he’s writing the dark and poetic tunes of Deguello Motel or “Psycho Bitch from Hell,” Roger Alan Wade is “an American treasure and one of the greatest songwriters we have.”\n\nHave you ever wondered what happened to REAL country music? Sadly, it has been pushed into the underground by the image-consumed, money-making monster of the corporate music industry. These days, only a few brave souls dare to make the kind of authentic country music that honors American heritage and culture; rooted in the influence of Jimmie Rodgers, Hank Williams, Johnny Cash, Merle Haggard, and the other all-but-forgotten legends of the genre. Genuine country music reflects real life, and not the latest fashion trends. One of the strongest and most charismatic forces in the real country music arena is J.B. Beverley & The Wayward Drifters.\n\nOriginally formed in December 1998, J.B. Beverley and the Wayward Drifters have steadily made a name for themselves in the U.S. and around the world. A “retired” hobo, Beverley took his experiences from the road, the trains, and everyday American people he encounters, and molded those experiences into some of the most heartfelt, real-deal country music to see the light of day in a long time. With driving acoustic rhythm guitar, slamming upright bass slapping, amazing banjo rolls, and other blistering accompaniment, Beverley and his “high lonesome” voice have earned a solid reputation for their live shows.\n\nJ.B. Beverley and his Wayward Drifters’ endless life on the road is studded with highlights, including a 7 week tour with Hank Williams III and shows with contemporary greats like Wayne “The Train” Hancock, Dale Watson and Lee Rocker. They have been joined on stage by legendary Commander Cody guitar picker Bill Kirchen, and other friends in the music community. The band also has made fans out of the likes of John Carter Cash, Slim Jim Phantom of the Stray Cats, Bruce Springsteen, and Piedmont Blues great Warner Williams.\n\nJ.B. Beverley & The Wayward Drifters have been featured on several radio and TV programs, including the MHZ Network’s “Spotlight”, Austin’s Capzeyes TV, and radio shows like Colorado’s KRFC “Live at Lunch, and Knoxville’s WDVX FM. The band has released two heavily-circulated demos, and a full-length studio CD entitled “Dark Bar & A Jukebox” (Helltrain Records). The band toured relentlessly for over two years in support of “Dark Bar”, and also wound up the subject of an upcoming documentary road film by Wayward Souls Productions out of New Mexico.\n\nIn 2008, J.B. opened Rebel Roots Studio in Richmond, VA to record and produce “Watch America Roll By”, the band’s sophomore effort. Described as “an organic road record that may as well have soil falling off it’s roots”, the 2009 release stirred up quite the buzz amongst Wayward Drifters fans and roots-music enthusiasts alike, and took the band across the US and to Europe non-stop from it’s release into 2011.\n\nAs of 2012, J.B. Beverley & The Wayward Drifters have re-entered Rebel Roots Studio to begin work on their new CD “The Way We Do It In Dixie”, scheduled for a 2014 release on RUSTY KNUCKLES MUSIC.\n\nLast False Hope are some city slickers from the mid-western suburbs of Chicago. Their unique sound of underground bluegrass imbibed with their roots in punk and metal is a loose bull in a china shop. This clash of genres that they have dubbed “Brutal-Grass” has quickly earned them a name in the scene. The band was cooked up by Jahshie P. A long time veteran in the Chicago music scene, best known as the former frontman of Failed Resistance, My Vengeance and later, Neverland. In the past few years, Jahshie P. developed an intense interest in country western and blue grass music, along with his new found passion of the mandolin. Come the Summer of 2009, his new skills began to translate into songs. His first step was to bring his wife, Kristina Nutting, a new comer to the Chicago music scene, along for the ride. She would rapidly warm up to the banjo. Quick to the draw, they set forth to include a track to the Outlaw Radio Compilation, volume one. To fill in the blanks, they recruited Producer, Shawn Connors, best known as the drummer of death metal band, Bound And Gagged and later, Jashie P.’s band mate in Neverland, as well as a number of other fly-by-night acts. To fill in the line-up, Arcadia Kust on fiddle, Sean Moriarty on guitar and Dave Beneventi on bass from a local irish punk act, The Fisticuffs, as well as former My Vengeance members, Steve Stepien on drums and David Wiegers, who also played guitar in Neverland. This line-up would go on to record “Two Dollar Pints” for the comp. Over the course of roughly the next year, the seven of them would go on to write more songs and play several shows Come September 2010, they re-enlisted Shawn Connors to begin work on the debut EP, “The Shape Of Blue Grass To Come.” Four songs, “Giving Up God For Lent,” “Drag Me To Hell,” “You Drink, You Drive, She Wins” and “Dying and Diseaed” would make the final cut. The EP was released on March 1st through Pint Of Happiness Records. After the conclusion of the “The Shape of Blue Grass To Come” sessions, Sean, Arcadia and Dave B parted ways with the band. Shawn Connors has since joined to fill the open guitar position, along with Scott Farruggia, also from Bound And Gagged and Neverland on bass and friend of friend, Colleen Mary on fiddle. The new line-up was debuted on a track for the Southern Independent, volume one compilation, titled “Guilty Until Proven Innocent.” They new line-up is currently working on a versus split with Nellie Wilson & the Hellbound Honeys on Jahshie P.’s own, Solitary Records. Since their their inception, l/f/h has shared the stage with the likes of Star Fucking Hipster, Those Poor Bastards, .357 String Band, Hellbound Glory, The Goddamn Gallows, Rachel Brooks and Six Gun Britt. They were also, named the Best Country Bandin the Chicago Reader “Best of Chicago 2011” reader’s poll. They will continue to play shows with the line-up in support of “The Shape Of Bluegrass To Come, while crafting new material for a debut full length, hopefully to be released in early 2012."
