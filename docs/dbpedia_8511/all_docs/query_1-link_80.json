        "text": "Monday 17th February 2020\n\nAfter building anticipation for new music and selling out tour dates across North America, All Time Low have announced that they will release their new album, WAKE UP, SUNSHINE, on April 3rd on Fueled By Ramen.\n\nThis Thursday, February 20th, All Time Low will world premiere 'Sleeping In,' a brand-new single from 'Wake Up, Sunshine'. The track is set to debut at 2:00PM GMT on Scott Mills' BBC Radio 1 show.\n\nFurthermore, the band have announced that they will be heading across the pond for a pair of underplays at London's The Garage on February 21st and Leeds' Brudenell Social Club on February 24th.\n\nUK fans who pre-order WAKE, UP SUNSHINE or register at the band's official store by 4:00PM GMT on Wednesday, will receive a code to get first access to tickets: https://smarturl.it/ATL-FirstAccess.\n\nLast month, All Time Low released 'Some Kind of Disaster' alongside an official music video, which immediately heightened excitement for WAKE UP, SUNSHINE among fans and press. Within a month, the song has already clocked up over four million streams.\n\nThe group went back to the basics (and the basement) for WAKE UP, SUNSHINE. Throughout 2019, the four musicians—Alex Gaskarth [vocals, guitar], Jack Barakat [guitar, vocals], Zack Merrick [bass, vocals], and Rian Dawson [drums]—congregated together in Nashville at Rian's studio and at a Palm Springs rental house. Face-to-face, they wrote and recorded the 15-song affair joined by co-writer, producer, and collaborator Zakk Cervini.\n\n\"We got back to how we started,\" commented Alex. \"It had been a long time since the four of us made a record under one roof. That became a central theme. We've been a band for 17 years. Everybody brought something to the table. A lot of what you're hearing came from those magic moments together.\"\n\nJack concurred, \"I think we accomplished something special. By putting our four heads together, we were able to make a classic All Time Low album.\"\n\nWAKE UP, SUNSHINE distills two decades of experience into a definitive and dynamic body of work for the band. Welcoming new collaborators into their world, the forthcoming album sees All Time Low teaming up with blackbear on 'Monsters' and The Band CAMINO on 'Favorite Place' [album art / tracklist below].\n\nThroughout a back catalogue streamed nearly half-a-billion times, All Time Low have continually raised the bar. Since the release of their third album, 'Dirty Work' in 2011, the group have had four straight Top 20 entries on the UK Official Album Chart, with 2015's 'Future Hearts' debuting as a #1 album. 2009's 'Nothing Personal', 2012's 'Don't Panic' and 'Future Hearts' are all UK Certified albums - gold, silver and silver respectively, in addition to their two gold album, two gold single and platinum single accolades at home in the US.\n\nAfter nearly two decades together, All Time Low have rekindled the spark they first ignited in a Baltimore basement on their 2020 full-length studio album, WAKE UP, SUNSHINE. These four lifelong friends walked into a tiny room, plugged in, and turned up with the same spirit, but with more experience, and proficiency gained from performing to millions worldwide. As a result, they've delivered WAKE UP, SUNSHINE, a captivating body of work at the apex of their prowess.\n\nALL TIME LOW\n\nWAKE UP, SUNSHINE\n\n01. Some Kind of Disaster\n\n02. Sleeping In\n\n03.

Basement Noise\n\nMonday 17th February 2020\n\nBury Tomorrow have released a new track, 'Choke', from their forthcoming sixth album, Cannibal, set for release on April 3rd via Music For Nations / Sony\n\nBury Tomorrow's 2018 album Black Flame catapulted them into metal's upper echelons. It was the band's third consecutive UK Top 40 album - quite the feat for a heavy band - and took them on a tour which culminated with a huge show at London's iconic Roundhouse. But with follow-up Cannibal, the band have taken another leap forward.\n\nAlready, the South Coast quintet are responsible for some of metalcore's most rousing anthems, and Cannibal is stacked with more glorious vocal hooks, razor-sharp riffs and sublime melodies that will solidify their seat at UK metal's top table.\n\nTo record it, the band reunited with SikTh guitarist and Black Flame producer Dan Weller (Enter Shikari, Young Guns), while mixing and mastering was completed by Adam \"Nolly\" Getgood and Ermin Hamidovic, the dream team behind Architects' Holy Hell. The result is Bury Tomorrow's most technical, anthemic album yet. And while vocalist Dani Winter Bates has long been one of metal's loudest advocates for the importance of discussing mental health, this time he's delved explicitly into his own experiences, writing his most brutally personal lyrics to date.\n\n\"This album is for me as well as for the fans,\" he says. \"It was a cathartic process to address some of the darkest moments I've had in my life. For some people it'll be a hard listen. But I thought I have to do this, if I'm going to go in, I'm going to go in. I'm not doing something half arsed. There is nothing lyrically I would change on this entire album.\"\n\nWhen Dani began writing the concepts for Cannibal, while he had penned tracks about his mental health before, this time things were different. Dropping all metaphors and opaque sentiments, he's addressed things head on, hoping the album's unapologetically frank approach will help people who are struggling to understand that they aren't alone.\n\n\"I wanted to live by my words,\" he says. \"I talk to people about normalising mental health (Dani has facilitated Safe Space Sessions up and down the country during tours, alongside mental health professionals), so how can I write an album where I'm not talking about mental health? The normalisation of mental health is what saves lives. I want people to see the light in the dark. If they delve into that they can find solace in the discussion, the normalisation, the positive action by discussing this.\"\n\nLyrically, there's an apocalyptic feel to Cannibal. While tracks like Quake and Better Below go deep into Dani's lowest moments, the album also explores the impact of social media on Gods And Machines as well as what he refers to as \"society's oppressive, horrific nature\".\n\n\"The term Cannibal refers to being eaten away by your own thoughts but also eaten away by other humans,\" he explains. \"We're not kind to ourselves, let alone kind to each other.\"\n\nWhile Cannibal is very much Dani's story lyrically and thematically, the rest of the band are also on the form of their lives. The title track is a clear nod back to the anthemia of Black Flame's standout title-track and tracks like powerhouse opener Choke, The Grey (VIXI)and Imposter are classic Bury Tomorrow, metallic maelstroms of churning riffs and expansive choruses. Elsewhere though, the band have taken more risks than ever before, adding depth and shade to their ever-evolving sound. Quake ebbs and flows, swelling and simmering like a seething volcano and a techy edge cuts through the icy melody of Cold Sleep. And for all the album's dark ruminations, atmospheric closer Dark Infinite ends on a melodic high, a surging soundscape which sounds like the band are ready to take on the world.\n\nWork on Cannibal started almost immediately after the band released the deluxe version of Black Flame in June 2019 and was completed partly on the road. Soon after, the band headed to the studio, recording drums and rhythm guitars at Middle Farm studios, in South Devon, with the remainder of the album recorded at Vale studios in Worcestershire. Putting into practice the lessons they had learnt when making Black Flame, the band tore into, rewrote and scrapped any tracks that weren't up to scratch.\n\nWhile the process was far from easy and pushed the band musically and emotionally to their limit, there's no doubt that this is their best and bravest album to date. Now 14 years into their career, Cannibal will be the album that takes Bury Tomorrow to even greater heights. 2020 will be their year.\n\n\"I want it to grow our fan base and capitalise what we did with Black Flame,\" says Dani. \"Black Flame connected with a lot of people. I want Cannibal to take us to a new part of our career. It's a great starting point for a discussion, I'm excited for people to hear it.\"\n\nTRACKLISTING:\n\n1) Choke\n\n2) Cannibal\n\n3) The Grey (VIXI)\n\n4) Imposter\n\n5) Better Below\n\n6) The Agonist\n\n7) Quake\n\n8) Gods & Machines\n\n9) Voice & Truth\n\n10) Cold Sleep\n\n11) Dark Infinite\n\nSunday 16th February 2020\n\nAfter months of anticipation and teasing with fans, The Used have officially announced they will release their 8th full-length studio album, 'Heartwork', on April 24th via Big Noise/Hassle Records.\n\nIn addition to today's announcement, The Used have released a new single, \"Paradise Lost, a poem by John Milton.\" The song and accompanying video (Watch here) are larger than life and carry emotions and imagery so unique to The Used throughout while tying in influences from one of frontman Bert McCracken's favourite authors.\n\n\"I've always been a bit obsessed with Paradise Lost,\" shares McCracken. \"I really dug deep into the poem and its author, John Milton. As I was reading a lot of his political essays, I realized that a lot of what 'Satan' says in Paradise Lost are quotes directly from John Milton's own mouth. A lot of people thought he was the devil back then. He had a huge problem with the show of opulence from the Church. He thought it was disgusting. His poem is about the failed revolution against the Church of England, which is Satan's failed revolution on earth. And what's more incredible or exciting than a failed revolution?\"\n\nFans can pre-order/pre-save the new album and stream the new single today at\n\nhttps:// theused.ffm.to/heartwork.\n\nTracklisting for 'Heartwork'\n\n1.

To Feel Something\n\nOn 'Heartwork', McCracken shares, \"The new album plays on the emotions, the sincerity, and the vulnerability of the first record and In Love and Death, with a little bit of the flair from Lies for the Liars. Standing in the streaming circle pit with Kesha and Halsey, the album is just as modern sounding. John Feldmann's production is THAT professional. It sounds really good! Those are two really random examples, but I think if you listen to both of those records, the songs are all over the place: dance, pop, actual punk rock riffs and drums. I think music is so all over the place right now that The Used fits in perfectly.\"\n\n'Heartwork' also marks the return of John Feldmann to The Used family as he produced the album and is also the head of A&R at Big Noise.\n\n\"I couldn't be more honoured or grateful to have one of my favourite bands of all time on my record label! They are one of the most influential bands of the last 20 years and we have made a career-defining album\", shares Feldmann. \"They are one of the best live bands I've ever seen and Bert is quite possibly the best singer I've ever worked with. This has been a dream of mine since I met them in 2001.\"\n\nFeldmann signed The Used to Reprise Records in January 2002, one short year after the band formed in Orem, Utah. He also produced some of the band's most monumental albums including their self-titled debut, Maybe Memories, In Love and Death, Lies for the Liars, Vulnerable and Imaginary Enemy.\n\nThe band are currently on the road for a completely sold out intimate tour with support from Dragged Under. These up close and personal shows are unlike any other Used show you have seen. The band have spent the last couple of weeks performing previously released single \"Blow Me (Feat. Jason Aalon Butler)\" live. It's frenetic and explosive while showcasing the undeniable vocals of frontman Bert McCracken and has absolutely taken these small rooms by storm.\n\nThe band return to the UK and Europe this spring for a short run of shows.

Joining songs like Celine Dion's Think Twice, Aerosmith's I Don't Want To Miss A Thing, and of course, Whitney's I Will Always Love You.\n\n\"Iris\" has now topped one million pure sales in the UK via 1.003 million downloads and physical CD sales, it's a rare feat to achieve in 2020, when the preference is often to stream music.\n\nIris's million-seller status is the latest feat in the song's particularly unique journey. While it was a big hit in the US, Iris missed the Top 40 on the Official UK Singles Chart when it was first released in 1998, debuting at Number 50 in July. A re-release the following year saw it enter the Top 40 for just one week, landing at Number 26.\n\nIris saw its biggest resurgence in 2011, when it was a popular choice of audition song on The X Factor, notably by finalist Frankie Cocozza, whose rendition during the show's Bootcamp stage sent Iris to Number 3 on the Official Singles Chart the following week.\n\nOver the past year alone in the UK, it has been downloaded an average of 148 times a week and streamed around 410,000 times weekly, while its music video gets 95,000 plays per week on average. See Goo Goo Dolls full Official Chart history, click on 'Chart Facts' to see the stats and week by week chart positions for Iris.\n\nGoo Goo Dolls frontman John Rzeznik told OfficialCharts.com: \"I'm so happy that this song has had such a long life in the UK. Thank you to everyone who gave us this amazing gift.\"\n\n\"Iris\" - the title of which was inspired by a country singer named Iris DeMent – has, 22 years on, slowly-but-surely earned its place in the love ballads hall of fame. Its unreservedly romantic lyrics have made it an extremely popular choice for one particular occasion: never underestimate the power of a wedding song!\n\nThe band are set to tour the UK starting on 19th Feb in Glasgow, full dates below.\n\n2020 UK TOUR\n\nFeb 19 - Glasgow, O2 Academy\n\nFeb 21 - Manchester, Albert Hall (SOLD OUT)\n\nFeb 22 - Leeds, O2 Academy\n\nFeb 24 - Nottingham, Rock City\n\nFeb 25 - Birmingham, O2 Institute\n\nFeb 27 - London, Roundhouse (SOLD OUT)\n\nTuesday 11th February 2020\n\nFour Year Strong have released a brand new video for 'Learn To Love The Lie' taken from their highly anticipated fifth full-length album 'Brain Pain' which will be released on 28th February via Pure Noise Records. This is the band's first album since their self-titled release in 2015 and soon, fans will learn that it was worth every second of waiting.\n\n\"Learn to love the Lie was one of the first songs we wrote for Brain Pain. Its about being stuck in a mutually miserable relationship, but you're both too much of a coward to leave. If you're going to lie to yourself about being happy, you might as well learn to love it. Lets not kid ourselves...We've all been there.\" says Dan O'Connor\n\nWatch the new video HERE\n\nThe band - which is made up of vocalist/guitarists Dan O'Connor and Alan Day, bassist Joe Weiss and drummer Jake Massucco -began conceptualising the ideas for Brain Pain two years ago and for the past year-and-a-half have focused on bringing those thoughts to fruition. \"We didn't want to set a strict deadline for this album because we wanted to be sure we took the time to write the best songs possible. In the past our writing and recording was so dependent on getting something out in time to go on tour; this time we really had the opportunity to take our time and work through these ideas.\" In order to capture that sound the group enlisted producer Will Putney, who was an engineer on 2010's Enemy Of The World and already had a relationship with the band. \"We were really emotionally invested in this music so we wanted to go with someone who we knew would care about it as much as we did and Will was that guy,\" Day says.\n\nBrain Pain is available to pre-order today at https://smarturl.it/FourYearStrongMA.\n\nBrain Pain Track Listing\n\n1.

The definitive Enter Shikari album 'Nothing Is True & Everything Is Possible', released 17 April 2020 through So Recordings. First single '{ The Dreamers Hotel }' premiered as Annie Mac's Hottest Record last night and is available here. The band will play 5 special intimate UK shows tolaunch the album. Details below.\n\n'Nothing Is True & Everything Is Possible' is produced to dazzling effect by renowned frontman and visionary Rou Reynolds, from a band at the peak of their creative output with a unique story, underlining their 13-year succession as a pioneering and uncompromising musical force. This is an album about possibility, the unnerving irony of endless possibility, the band asking themselves what they can achieve as the world questions \"what is possible?\".\n\n'Nothing Is True & Everything Is Possible' is a lucid soundtrack for a new decade, with a poignant social commentary that expertly leads the listener from pure pop to scorching punk-rock fury, through four-to-the-floor beats and beautiful orchestral composition. 'Waltzing Off The Face Of The Earth' (I. Crescendo) and (II. Plangevole) draws you into the madness of modern life, \"you can't trust your own eyes, and you only hear lies, our future's been denied and there's nowhere to hide now that nothing is true and everything is possible.\" 'Elegy For Extinction' is a classical gem recorded in Prague with the City Of Prague Symphony Orchestra, and arranged by renowned film & television soundtrack composer George Fenton (Gandhi, Blue Planet, Planet Earth, Groundhog Day, My Name Is Joe), and the first single '{ The Dreamers Hotel }' a lavishly produced anthem.\n\nThe inspiration for 'Nothing Is True & Everything Is Possible' came while putting together their book 'Dear Future Historians' published by Faber, which charts the lyrical creativity of the band. Reynolds comments:\n\n\"Looking at all we had achieved, gave us a better sense of perspective and confidence....... What are we capable of? What is possible? These questions are part of Shikari's DNA. But now we reflect a society where possibility itself has drifted from something of optimistic opportunity to something quite frightening.\"\n\nRou Reynolds is post-punk's renaissance man; a musician, producer, composer, published author, and campaigner, who has spent much of the last few years as an advocate of mental health charities following his well-documented struggles on Enter Shikari's critically acclaimed album\n\n'The Spark' (2017). Alongside Reynolds stands the vital Rob Rolfe (drums), Chris Batten (bass) and Rory Clewlow (guitar) making up one of the UK's truly great British bands, almost uniquely the same four friends that started Enter Shikari at school,16 years later still united by a shared vision.\n\nThe last decade has seen Enter Shikari increase their stature year on year, a rare career story which has taken them to 4 Top 10 albums, millions of streams, huge sell out world tours (most recently in Russia and two American), as well as multiple awards, last year crowned Best British Band by Rocksound, with Best Album from Kerrang! for 'The Spark' at 2018's Awards.\n\n'Nothing Is True & Everything Is Possible' tracklist:\n\n1.The Great Unknown\n\n2.Crossing The Rubicon\n\n3. { The Dreamers Hotel }\n\n4.

It’s got a very lonely feel to it and Mark Morales delivered an absolutely incredible vocal performance.”\n\nEther, MORTON’s second solo offering, was released this month via Rise Records. The primarily acoustic EP is comprised of three original tracks and two covers that showcase MORTON’s diversity as a musician. As with last year’s solo debut, Anesthetic, the guitarist enlisted the talents of various musicians and vocalists to bring his songs to life.\n\nMorales, who regularly tours as part of MORTON’s live band, sings two songs on the EP - the original track “All I Had To Lose” and “Black.” Additional vocals are provided by Lzzy Hale on The Black Crowes cover “She Talks To Angels,” Light The Torch vocalist Howard Jones on “Love My Enemy” and Moon Tooth singer John Carbone on “The Fight.” Ether was produced and mixed by Josh Wilbur (Lamb of God, Gojira, Trivium).\n\nWatch the video for the EP’s first single, \"All I Had To Lose\" featuring Mark Morales, at https://youtu.be/0oEBUIAqlQY.\n\nEther is available via digital retailers. For a list of providers, visit https://riserecords.lnk.to/ether. Physical copies of Ether are available via Rise Records.\n\nAnesthetic, MORTON’s first 10-track solo album, was made alongside a dream team of highly respected musicians from a multitude of musical worlds. Singers on the album include Chester Bennington, Randy Blythe, Jacoby Shaddix, Myles Kennedy, Alissa White-Gluz, Mark Lanegan, Chuck Billy, Jake Oni, Josh Todd, Mark Morales and Naeemah Maddox. Musically, MORTON performs all guitars, with Roy Mayorga, David Ellefson, Ray Luzier, Paolo Gregoletto, Alex Bent, Mike Inez, Jean-Paul Gaster, Steve Gorman, Marc Ford, Yanni Papadopoulos and Chris Brooks completing the band. The single \"Cross Off,\" featuring late Linkin Park vocalist Chester Bennington and Trivium's rhythm section of Paolo Gregoletto and Alex Bent, spent six weeks in the Top 10 Active Rock US radio chart and has now amassed more than 14 million plays on Spotify and YouTube.\n\nFollowing the 2019 release of Anesthetic, MORTON took his live band, consisting of Morales on lead vocals, Doc Coyle (Bad Wolves) on guitar, Nick Villarreal (Sons Of Texas) on bass, Art Cruz (Lamb of God, Prong, Winds of Plague, on a North American co-headline tour with Light the Torch.\n\nMORTON recently wrapped a handful of intimate acoustic shows in the UK as a three piece with vocalist Mark Morales and guitarist Joe Harvatt.\n\nMonday 27th January 2020\n\nOne of the UK's most exciting, credible and influential British groups, The Stranglers have announced an extensive full production UK tour in October and November 2020 and have confirmed that this will be the last time they intend to play together in this way. The band have stated that this will be their final extensive tour of the UK and whilst they may not be checking out completely just yet this will be the last opportunity to see them playing together in a comprehensive touring format.

Further success was to follow with Always The Sun, Strange Little Girl and the mercurial Golden Brown, amongst many others, earning the group 24 Top 40 singles and 18 Top 40 albums.\n\nAs always, audiences can expect to be swept up high on the wave of The Stranglers' powerful sound, pounding rhythms, soaring melodies, quirky humour and thrillingly daring musicianship for an exhilarating live experience.

Featuring 11 live tracks from the band's 2019 headlining set at German heavy metal festival Wacken Open Air, the soundtrack also includes 3 studio tracks recorded in German; \"Würgegriff (Vice Grip)\", \"Die Leere (The Void)\", and \"Schattenboxen (Shadow Boxing)\" which features German rapper Casper. Today, the band share both the live version and the German version (Die Leere) of \"The Void,\" previously off the band's sixth studio album Reverence. The soundtrack is currently available for pre-order, here.\n\n\"This was hands down one of the most unique projects we've undertaken,\" says vocalist Winston McCall on recording \"Die Leere\" (The Void). \"The idea of taking our songs and interpreting them through another language was a massive challenge, but considering the amount of time, love and support that has been shown to us over the years we wanted to commit to doing the project with full integrity. The result is every effort being made to translate the meaning, spirit, and conviction of these songs in a language that is not our own. We hope the result helps to strengthen the connection this music creates. We offer you these songs out of respect and our heartfelt thanks for all the times you have sung them with us in their original forms. We hope you enjoy them as much as we enjoyed the process of creating them.\"\n\nLISTEN TO THE DOUBLE SINGLE NOW\n\nThe documentary, 'Viva The Underdogs,' features over a decade of behind the scenes personal footage, coupled with unprecedented access to the band's most explosive live tours and world's biggest music festivals.

Cristina Scabbia of LACUNA COIL) from their recently released album, 'Necrophaze,' that is available now from Nuclear Blast Records.\n\nWatch the lyric video for 'Monster' here: https://youtu.be/FE_m7Ya9c6s\n\nPurchase 'Necrophaze' here: http://www.nuclearblast.com/w13-necrophaze\n\nPurchase 'Necrophaze' bundles here: https://theoraclemanagementmerch.com/collections/wednesday-13\n\n\"'Monster' is the 1st WEDNESDAY 13 song recorded to feature guest vocals. I wanted something different than I had ever tried before and I wanted a female vocalist. Cristina was the perfect choice for this song. I gave her the lyrics and some minor details, and she came back with what you hear. She totally floored us with her amazing vocal range and adding a new element never heard on one of our songs before.\" – WEDNESDAY 13\n\n\"This collaboration was born from blackness. WEDNESDAY and I are both fans of the darkest vision of art and music, and when I was asked to sing with him for the song 'Monster', I immediately visualized his concept and shared it with pleasure. What I love about this song is that some people in life are taking the worst out of us... but demonizing it all and pushing away the tension through notes is the best thing to do.\" – Cristina Scabbia\n\nWEDNESDAY 13's 8th studio album, 'Necrophaze,' is available now from Nuclear Blast Records. Featuring special guest appearances from, Alice Cooper, Roy Mayorga (STONE SOUR), Alexi Laiho (CHILDREN OF BODOM), Jeff Clayton (GG Allin's MURDER JUNKIES) and Cristina Scabbia (LACUNA COIL) among others, 'Necrophaze' shocks and surprises with a cauldron of monster riffs and haunting lyrics and have listeners feening for more.\n\nHeavily influenced by real-life night terror occurrences of WEDNESDAY himself, historical serial killers, and a slew of 80's horror films, the ideas behind 'Necrophaze' are bizarrely familiar, frightening, and a hell of a lot of fun. Being a collector of both media and toys, WEDNESDAY 13 was inspired by a craving for variety to create dual album artwork for this release (seen below). The covers showcase either end of the horror spectrum with a 'Creepshow' comic book vibe for the LP artwork, and the eeriness of something akin to John Carpenter's 'The Fog' adorning the CD.\n\nMore from 'Necrophaze' :\n\n'Zodiac' Trailer - https://youtu.be/AFhqlXv1nCw\n\n'Decompose' Visualizer - https://youtu.be/mdqrNZOwzzc\n\n'Bring Your Own Blood' Visualizer - https://youtu.be/B1iZ6KHx7KQ\n\n'Necrophaze' Visualizer - https://youtu.be/qY7i3Y04ejo\n\n'Necrophaze' Commercial - https://youtu.be/Btc7dTOff-Q\n\nNecroflakes Cereal Commercial - https://youtu.be/Btc7dTOff-Q\n\nWEDNESDAY 13 live:\n\nw/THE 69 EYES, THE NOCTURNAL AFFAIR, THE CROWNED\n\nJan 24 - Brooklyn, NY - Knitting Factory\n\nJan 25 - Boston, MA - Brighton Music Hall\n\nJan 26 - Syracuse, NY - Westcott Theater\n\nJan 28 - Flint, MI - The Machine Shop\n\nJan 29 - Chicago, IL - Reggie's Rock Club\n\nJan 30 - Minneapolis, MN - Fine Line Music Cafe\n\nJan 31 - Lincoln, NE - The Royal Grove\n\nFeb 1 - Denver, CO - Oriental Theater\n\nFeb 3 - Seattle, WA - El Corazon\n\nFeb 4 - Portland, OR - Hawthorne Theater\n\nFeb 6 - San Francisco, CA - Bottom of the Hill\n\nFeb 7 - West Hollywood, CA - The Whisky A Go Go\n\nFeb 8 - San Diego, CA - Brick By Brick\n\nFeb 9 - Mesa, AZ - Club Red\n\nFeb 11 - Dallas, TX - GMBG\n\nFeb 12 - New Orleans, LA - Southport Music Hall\n\nFeb 14 - Orlando, FL - Soundbar\n\nFeb 15 - Atlanta, GA - Masquerade\n\nFeb 16 - Nashville, TN - The Basement East\n\nFeb 17 - Asheville, NC - The Orange Peel\n\nFeb 18 – Lexington, KY – Manchester Music Hall\n\nFeb 19 - Richmond, VA - Canal Club\n\nFeb 20 - Pittsburgh, PA - Craft House\n\nFeb 21 - Cleveland, OH - The Odeon\n\nFeb 22 - Reading, PA - Reverb\n\nMonday 27h January 2020\n\nOn the heels of their first career #1 on the Top Current Albums Chart in the US and guitarist Mark Tremonti being voted Guitarist of the Decade by Guitar World magazine, Alter Bridge are getting ready to kick off the first leg of their Walk The Sky Tour 2020 this month.

Diamonds In The Rough, originally released in 2008 as a compilation CD that included B-sides recorded during the making of the band's self-titled debut, will be released on February 7, while Live In The LBC, originally released as a live DVD from the band's 2008 show at Long Beach Arena, will be released on March 6.

Shadows explains, \"It's very typical of musicians to write 20 to 30 songs for a particular album. Most of the time, they take the best of the bunch and call it a day, discarding the rest. We have never written like that. We don't usually finish songs unless they are fulfilling a purpose. The one exception to this was during the self-titled era. We were experimenting with our sound, producing ourselves and we had no one to reel us in. Eventually, the unreleased songs from these sessions were released under the name Diamonds in the Rough. We've heard the demand from many fans that want to stream the album and we wanted to make it special. So, we have remastered the album and added some hard to find tracks. We even found an unreleased track from the Hail to the King sessions that we think you will enjoy.\"\n\nDiamonds In The Rough Tracklisting:\n\nDemons\n\nGirl I Know\n\nCrossroads\n\nFlash Of The Blade (Iron Maiden Cover)\n\nUntil The End\n\nTension\n\nWalk (Pantera Cover)\n\nThe Fight\n\nDancing Dead\n\nAlmost Easy (CLA Mix)\n\nAfterlife (Alternate Version)\n\nAdditional tracks added to new expanded version:\n\nSt. James (bonus track on Hail To The King limited edition)\n\nSet Me Free (unreleased; recorded during the Hail To The King sessions)\n\n4 AM (B-side on the Welcome to the Family EP)\n\nLost It All (Bonus track on Japanese edition of Nightmare)\n\nParanoid (Black Sabbath cover)\n\nLive In The LBC Tracklisting:\n\nCritical Acclaim (Live)\n\nSecond Heartbeat (Live)\n\nAfterlife (Live)\n\nBeast and the Harlot (Live)\n\nScream (Live)\n\nSeize the Day (Live)\n\nWalk (Live)\n\nBat Country (Live)\n\nAlmost Easy (Live)\n\nGunslinger (Live)\n\nUnholy Confessions (Live)\n\nA Little Piece of Heaven (Live)\n\nThursday 16th January 2020\n\nWe Came As Romans — Joshua Moore [guitar], Dave Stephens [vocals], Lou Cotton [guitar], Andy Glass [bass] and David Puckett [drums] — have shared the video for their brand new song 'From the First Note'. Watch here: youtu.be/0B6uLfqks_o\n\n'From the First Note' and 'Carry the Weight' served as the first tracks that the band released since singer Kyle Pavone's tragic passing in August 2018.\n\n\"'FTFN' is a song the celebrates the time that we got to spend with Kyle and acknowledges how truly remarkable of a brother and bandmate he was,\" says Moore. \"Lyrically, I was able to reference 'To Plant a Seed and 'Tracing Back Roots,' -which were both written about the start of the band and how we lived together. I was able to take Kyle's recorded vocal from 'TPA' and fit it into the bridge of the song, so we can always hear him when we listen and play it.\"\n\n\"We wrote 'From The First Note' as a promise to Kyle to not only preserve the amazing moments and memories we had together, but to continue carrying on the legacy of everything we built together,\" says Glass. \"The video portrays the band playing in a dream-like state, surrounded by beautiful colors and flowers. Our albums throughout the years have had themes of roots, branches, and overall growth. So we felt it was only right to create something that not only captured that essence but persevered it as well.\"\n\nThe band will also embark on an 10th anniversary tour celebrating their landmark, 2009-released album To Plant A Seed. The tour kicks off on March 5 in Chicago and runs through April 11 in Pontiac, Michigan, and will feature support from The Devil Wears Prada, Gideon and Dayseeker. All dates are below.\n\nTo Plant A Seed was a definitive sonic statement for We Came As Romans and remains a fan favourite to this day. It's only fitting that the band commemorate the release.\n\n\"We're really excited to announce the 10-year anniversary tour for our first record To Plant A Seed,\" said Moore at the time tour was announced. \"Being able to watch our fans connect with us through music over the last decade has been an amazing privilege, and it all started with To Plant A Seed. Way back in 2009 when we recorded it, we had no idea where it would take us or what we were really even doing, and it's awesome to see that we can play these songs still, and feel that connection with you.\"\n\nHe continued, \"But over the course of 10 years, we've released four other albums and we're even working on a fifth! With that being said, we are going to be throwing these songs into the vault of old WCAR — and retiring them from all future setlists after this tour. So make sure you grab your tickets and come hear these songs one last time live.\"\n\nWE CAME AS ROMANS ON TOUR\n\nWITH THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA, GIDEON, + DAYSEEKER\n\n3/5—Chicago, IL—House of Blues\n\n3/6—St. Louis, MO—Ready Room\n\n3/7—Indianapolis, IN—The Citadel Music Hall\n\n3/8—Grand Rapids, MI—The Intersection\n\n3/10—Toronto, ON—Opera House\n\n3/11—Montreal, QC—Club Soda\n\n3/13—Worcester, MA—The Palladium\n\n3/14—Brooklyn, NY—Warsaw\n\n3/15—Philadelphia, PA—Theatre of Living Arts\n\n3/17—Baltimore, MD—Rams Head Live!\n\n3/18—Greensboro, NC—Arizona Pete's\n\n3/19—Atlanta, GA—The Masquerade\n\n3/20—Ft.

The band has just released a new song, “Season Of The Flood”, available to stream and purchase via DSPs HERE. A seductive, hypnotic, 7-minute slow-burner anchored by haunting 3-part harmonies and heavy reverb-filled guitars, the song notably features AOF’s George Pettit singing off the top for the first time. The track comes on the heels of “Familiar Drugs” and “Complicit” released last year, marking the first time the band released new music in almost 10 years.\n\n“I’m very proud of this new song,” says Pettit. “There were some first time attempts for us and we all really came together in the studio to make this song what it is. This was also my first time singing with Dallas on a song. I know I’ve been playing in a band with Dal for almost 20 years, but damn, that guy’s voice could melt an angel.”\n\n\"Season Of The Flood\" is available on vinyl by pre-order now through the band's website, theonlybandever.com. The limited pressing is available as a single-sided standard black 10” vinyl with a laser-etched b-side. A limited edition white variant will be randomly inserted throughout the stock quantities of black vinyl. Along with the 10” vinyl, AOF will have a new online exclusive “Season Of The Flood” inspired t-shirt for sale, designed by graphic artist Jeremy Dean, best known for his “Wonders of Black Flag” prints. This T-shirt is part of a collection of Jeremy Dean x Alexisonfire merchandise items inspired by the songs, \"Familiar Drugs\", \"Complicit\" and now \"Season Of The Flood\" with cover art design once again by Nick Steinhardt.\n\nA second \"Season Of The Flood\" long sleeve design will be available at merch booths through the January tour. Both music and merch can be found online HERE.\n\nThe song was produced by AOF long-time friend, the late Karl “Horse” Bareham (City and Colour), and mixed by Grammy-award winning Jacquire King (Tom Waits, Kings of Leon, Modest Mouse). The album cover and 10” package features many personal nods honouring Karl as the song is the last of a trilogy of tracks Bareham produced for the band.\n\nAlexisonfire previously announced select headline shows, to take place this month in Western Canada and Seattle, WA. Supporting Alexisonfire on all dates are reunited modern day punk icons The Distillers who will co-headline the Seattle show. Montreal garage punk rockers NOBRO, hot off their national tour with PUP, will be opening all Canadian dates, with Monsterwatch opening in the U.S. The run kicks off January 20 in Winnipeg and includes stops in Edmonton, Calgary, and Vancouver with a final stop in Seattle on January 26.\n\nSee below for all show dates and visit theonlybandever.com for direct ticket links. Alexisonfire have partnered with PLUS1 so that $1 from every ticket sold will be donated to Indspire to build a brighter future for Indigenous students.\n\nAn official video for single “Familiar Drugs” directed by Michael Maxxis (who directed AOF’s personal favourite video for “The Northern” and City and Colour’s “Fragile Bird”, “Thirst”, and “Lover Come Back”) is available to watch HERE.\n\nAfter sharing new music in 2019, AOF performed a handful of sold-out shows for lucky fans around the world, including one show in London, UK, and 2 consecutive nights each in New York, Los Angeles, and Toronto’s Budweiser Stage. Each of the first two dates in NY, L.A. and Toronto sold-out quickly with Alexisonfire having the distinction of being one of a handful of Canadian artists to perform two consecutive nights at the iconic Toronto venue alongside City and Colour, Drake, The Tragically Hip, and Sarah McLachlan. A highlight of the evening was when the mascot for NBA reigning champions The Toronto Raptors, aptly named The Raptor, kicked off the first show after Toronto’s Game 6 victory over Golden State the previous night.\n\nALEXISONFIRE 2020 SHOW DATES\n\nJan 20 – Winnipeg, MB @ Bell MTS Place*^\n\nJan 22 – Edmonton, AB @ Rogers Place*^\n\nJan 23 – Calgary, AB @ Scotiabank Saddledome*^\n\nJan 25 – Vancouver, BC @ Pacific Coliseum*^\n\nJan 26 – Seattle, WA @ Showbox*\n\n* w/The Distillers\n\n^ w/NOBRO\n\nWednesday 15th January 2020\n\nWhat better than some line-up news from BLOODSTOCK, to banish your January blues and help pass the time to pay day!

Following the reveal, on Tuesday, Australia's flagship radio station, triple J premiered the song on their new music show, Good Nights.\n\nOn the meaning behind the song, lead singer, John Floreani, shared \"Figure Eight is about time lost. It is the sound of a broken heart, the deafening silence of a couple once in love, and a fleeting dream told from two perspectives - one is of failure and the other of resentment.\" Describing the couple, John continues, \"The song is about a man who had given himself entirely, still desperately grasping at straws of success and a woman left to pick up the pieces of the reality.\"\n\nHaving recently announced the Figure Eight Tour, the first chance for fans to see the anthemic rock-powerhouse on an Australian headline tour in over a year – the band is looking to give fans a unique opportunity to see Trophy Eyes in some of Australia's most iconic and intimate venues.\n\nTrophy Eyes now leads a new wave in rock music, blending their punk and hard-core roots with modern rock and pop sensibilities. Known for their brutally honest and emotional storytelling and lyricism combined with one of the most energetic live shows on the circuit, Trophy Eyes has once again captured the sobering realism and wistful heartbreak of life with \"Figure Eight.\"\n\n\"Figure Eight\" is the follow up to the band's 2018's groundbreaking album, The American Dream, which debuted at #8 in Australia. The album enjoyed huge success at triple J – achieving Featured Album, as well as lead single \"You Can Count On Me\" breaking intotriple J's Hottest 100. Trophy Eyes also went on to conquer the globe with headline tours in Australia, North America and the UK, large support tours with Bring Me The Horizon, and festival dates at Groovin The Moo (AUS), Reading and Leeds (UK), and Disrupt Festival (US).\n\nTrophy Eyes Upcoming Tour Dates:\n\nFeb 13 – Brisbane, AUS – The Triffid\n\nFeb 14 – Sydney, AUS – Manning Bar\n\nFeb 15 – Melbourne, AUS – The Croxton\n\nWednesday 15th January 2020\n\nFour Year Strong have finally announced their highly anticipated fifth full-length album Brain Pain will be released on February 28 via Pure Noise Records. This will be the band's first album since their self-titled release in 2015 and soon, fans will learn that it was worth every second of waiting.\n\nSTREAM NEW SINGLES\n\n\"TALKING MYSELF IN CIRCLES\" AND \"BRAIN PAIN\"\n\nThe band - which is made up of vocalist/guitarists Dan O'Connor and Alan Day, bassist Joe Weiss and drummer Jake Massucco -- began conceptualising the ideas for Brain Pain two years ago and for the past year-and-a-half have focused on bringing those thoughts to fruition. \"We didn't want to set a strict deadline for this album because we wanted to be sure we took the time to write the best songs possible. In the past our writing and recording was so dependent on getting something out in time to go on tour; this time we really had the opportunity to take our time and work through these ideas.\" In order to capture that sound the group enlisted producer Will Putney, who was an engineer on 2010's Enemy Of The World and already had a relationship with the band. \"We were really emotionally invested in this music so we wanted to go with someone who we knew would care about it as much as we did and Will was that guy,\" Day says.\n\nBrain Pain is available to pre-order today at https://smarturl.it/FourYearStrongMA.\n\nIn addition to today's announcement, Four Year Strong has dropped two brand new songs for fans. \"Talking Myself In Circles\" and title track \"Brain Pain\" are the first singles from their forthcoming album.\n\nVocally Brain Pain sees the band being more direct and carrying over cohesive themes in a way they haven't done in the past, making for a more complete narrative. \"I think that from a lyrical perspective this is the most thought we've ever put into a record,\" O' Connor explains -- and it shows. Sonically the album's vocals also sit in the mix in a way that they aren't battling with the other elements, making Brain Pain the band's most dynamic release to date.\n\nBrain Pain Track Listing\n\n1.

The Bombpops co-founder and singer-guitarist Jen Razavi read it as the band debated titles for their second full-length. “It’s a cautionary tale to those that want to become an artist,” she says, “but it’s also really comforting to artists who can’t help or necessarily contain being who they are and what they’re drawn to.”\n\nWhat draws The Bombpops hasn’t changed: highly melodic punk with big guitars, vocal harmonies, and the SoCal sound that inspired Razavi, co-founder and singer-guitarist Poli van Dam, bassist Neil Wayne, and drummer Josh Lewis. But the more light-hearted skate punk of Fear of Missing Out has a serrated edge on Death in Venice Beach, as Razavi and van Dam explore darker themes—even though the songs are catchier than ever.\n\n“I want people to feel this dark, uneasy feeling,” says van Dam, who had plenty of her own in the three years since FOMO. She suffered a potentially life-threatening diabetic seizure on tour in the fall of 2018 (referenced in “Double Arrows Down,” one of album’s standout tracks), and she sought treatment for alcoholism while the new album was in post-production.\n\n“I went to rehab right when we were finalizing the mixes and stuff,” van Dam says, “and so listening back to the songs when I was in rehab, I'm like, ‘Oh shit, I was going through some stuff without even realizing how dark everything was and how shitty of a place I was in.”\n\nListeners can hear about her being “high as hell and drunk as fuck” in “13 Stories Down” and the “drunken altercations” she references in “Can’t Come Clean.”\n\nThe personal mixes with the metaphysical in lead single “Notre Dame.” The fire at the famed 700-year-old cathedral prompted self-reflection in Razavi, who was inspired by its centuries-long history. “I’ve always thought when you meet somebody that you like, or even a friend, it’s not the first time,” she says. “I say, ‘I've known you before. We were here before.’”\n\nAs much as their personal lives shaped Death in Venice Beach, the band’s hometown of Los Angeles—and its art—is perhaps their biggest muse. Razavi devoured all manner of Angeleno culture while writing the album, from books like those in James Ellroy’s L.A. quartet and John Fante’s Ask the Dust to films like True Romance, Mulholland Drive, Falling Down, and Natural Born Killers, lines from which appear in “Blood Pact.”\n\n“Death in Venice Beach is a love letter to Los Angeles, but it’s a love letter to the dark side of Los Angeles,” Razavi says.\n\nIt’s not all darkness, though. Listeners are treated to a comical snippet of one of The Bombpops’ intraband arguments at the beginning of “Can’t Come Clean,” and “House on Fire” begins with a piano-led singalong at Fat Mike’s Six Floggs Abusement Park studio. Even the album’s darkest moments are laced with van Dam and Razavi’s wit, like when van Dam sings, “I ’m not an alcoholic, I just play one on the weekends” in “13 Stories Down.”\n\nThe album’s themes and sounds were captured with maximum nuance by a production team consisting of Yotam Ben Horin (Useless ID), Fat Mike (NOFX), and Chris Fogal (The Gamits), who also recorded Fear of Missing Out.\n\nFat Wreck Chords will release Death in Venice Beach on March 13th.\n\nDeath in Venice Beach track listing:\n\n1. Dearly Departed\n\n2. Double Arrows Down\n\n3. Zero Remorse\n\n4. Notre Dame\n\n5. Sad to Me\n\n6. Can’t Come Clean\n\n7. Blood Pact\n\n8. In the Doghouse\n\n9. 13 Stories Down\n\n10.

The song's powerful, somber melodic undertones set the stage for Vext's story of ruinous romantic and family relationships, steeped in addiction and self-desecration, that finds recovery possible for those who can stay the course. \"This song was a unique opportunity to talk about addiction not only from the perspective of the addict but also from the perspective of their loved ones,\" says Vext. \"The message is very different from traditional songs that seem to always perpetuate a mentality of self victimization which is exactly the kind of misguided thinking that perpetuates the mental obsessive side of alcoholism & addiction.\n\nIn the end the moral of the story is about holding on to not giving up on ourselves or the people who are trying - who are really, really trying to make and better themselves.\"\n\nBad Wolves came to Vext as an opportunity to try his craft again after his stint in Divine Heresy was brought down by his own demons and addictions, a childhood family life to the extent that most nightmares never reach, and an adult existence that took him even deeper into that hell.\n\nYet, it was a call from another addict, a kid looking for help, that brought Vext off the suicidal edge, literally, and into a life of service in recovery. Vext declared in an August 2018 interview for Psychology Today,titled Tommy Vext and the Deafening Sound of Self-Termination: \"Because when we are in that state of self-termination it's so deafening–the only way to break out of it is to have contact with people who literally have it worse and are still hopeful. And that's the most powerful thing about altruism. It's the foundation of my recovery and it's the fabric of everything I do. I think we're all here for a reason, and we're all here for a purpose. Some of us have to find our purpose, and sometimes it's thrust upon us. . . Such is life.\"\n\n\"Sober\"will be the next track off of Bad Wolves' sophomore album N.A.T.I.O.N,that goes to radio. Their current single, \"Killing Me Slowly\"is presently at #2 at rock radioand well on its way to becoming the band's fourth consecutive chart topping single – with tracks \"Zombie,\"\"Hear Me Now\"feat Diamante and \"Remember When\" from their previous album, Disobey, also reaching #1.\n\nBad Wolveswill join Five Finger Death Punch, with special guests Megadeth, for their winter European tour, from January 22nd in Stockholm, Sweden, through Thursday, February 20th in Budapest, Hungary.

From the start, the guitarist set about establishing a path away from trend and genre, touching on a variety of musical strands – from dark folk through to urgent rock 'n' roll – whilst maintaining a strong, signature voice: a rich, conspiratorial, timber-shakin' baritone that smacks of hard miles travelled and late-night stories told.\n\nAnd now that voice has a new platform on Snakefarm.\n\nSays Smith: \"I'm looking forward to working with Snakefarm. Their passion for honest, heartfelt, real music is refreshing and I'm excited for the future.\"\n\nSays Snakefarm Records Head of A&R, Dante Bonutto: \"We're delighted to welcome Jake Smith to the Snakefarm roster at a time when there's a serious revival of interest in the authentic and the real. Jake's music as The White Buffalo is based on genuine emotion and original thought; he's a true artist, a teller of stories with his own special style, and exciting new release plans are already in the pipeline.\"\n\nOver the last few years, The White Buffalo has moved into a wider arena, making a powerful connection with fans and critics on both sides of the Atlantic and being embraced by the worlds of TV, film and games.\n\nSmith's raw, exposed delivery and narrative lyrics are at the beating heart of it all, instilling the songs – effectively, mini-movies – with a cinematic, hand-crafted quality that has led to extensive global streaming (over 200 million streams to date), high-profile TV appearances (including 'Jimmy Kimmel Live', US, and 'Later With Jools Holland', UK), headline touring in both North America and Europe, plus festival slots at Bonnaroo in the US and Blues Fest in the UK; add to this guest appearances with Neil Young, Stephen Stills, Steve Earle and more, and The White Buffalo has played to almost 1 million followers across the world.\n\nSimply, Oregon-born Smith delivers spontaneous, gimmick-free music aimed squarely at the heart – qualities that have led to significant placements in TV shows such as 'The Punisher' and the hugely influential 'Sons Of Anarchy' (for which he received a 2015 Emmy nomination), as well as in a number of video games and movies, one of which, the Peter Jackson produced 'West Of Memphis', was nominated for 'Best Documentary' by the Writers Guild of America. Indeed, as an artist, Smith holds a Top 10 spot in the 'TV / Film Syncs Chart' for 2019, with 'The Woods' (featured in 'The Punisher') also figuring in the Top 10.\n\nThis is music cast in the Great American Songwriting tradition. Music of weight and meaning and soul.\n\nAnd once again, Smith will be taking it live; The White Buffalo has confirmed the following shows for spring 2020, with more to follow:\n\nAPRIL 2020\n\n19 – O2 Institute, Birmingham (UK)\n\n20 – O2 Academy, Glasgow (Scotland)\n\n21 – O2 Academy 2, Newcastle (UK)\n\n23 – O2 Forum, London (UK)\n\n24 – O2 Academy, Bristol (UK)\n\n25 – O2 Ritz, Manchester (UK)\n\n27 – Alcatraz, Milan (Italy)\n\n29 – 013, Tilburg (Netherlands)\n\n30 – TivoliVredenburg, Utrecht (Netherlands)\n\nMAY 2020\n\n2 – Rhythm & Blues Night, Groningen (Netherlands)\n\nFor tickets, visit: thewhitebuffalo.com\n\nAll UK shows plus Tilburg & Utrecht are on sale Thursday, January 16th at 10am local times; Milan & Groningen are on sale at the time of announce\n\nFriday 10th January 2020\n\nThe dark veil between Nergal’s enigmatic blackened blues project and its dedicated congregation has been lifted. Napalm Records is pleased to announce the official release of ME AND THAT MAN’s second full-length album, entitled New Man, New Songs, Same Shit, Vol.1, on March 27, 2020. It will be celebrated with a special record release show in London on the same day, including special guests from the album.\n\nThree years after their initial debut, ME AND THAT MAN has returned with an offering that is indeed different from the first, but in no way less brilliant. The mysterious collective has surpassed themselves with their bewitching new collection – featuring ominous lyricism atop unfiltered blues, gothic-laced folk, outlaw country, and Americana-influenced anthems. The enthralling album visits a new spectrum of dark desert vibes and sees notable heavy music icons such as Corey Taylor (Slipknot), Brent Hinds (Mastodon), Matt Heafy (Trivium), Ihsahn (Emperor), and Siver Høyem (Madrugada) join the pact with the devil. New Man, New Songs, Same Shit, Vol.1 is a diverse, dynamic masterpiece that presents Nergal in a completely new light, providing a striking contrast to the heavier sounds of his acclaimed other band, Behemoth. Evil has truly never sounded so good.\n\nNergal comments, “With the utmost pride and… kind of relief; I present to you, the second ME AND THAT MAN album - New Man, New Songs, Same Shit, Vol.1. This time round, I wanted to take on a different challenge and curated an album of 11 songs - each with their own character and vibe; alongside the most talented and important individuals across the whole scene - together, we take trips to the lands of Blues, Folk, Country, and even Spaghetti Western. Only time will tell if we hit the mark, but I deeply believe so. I’m very proud of this piece of work and it has been a monumental task to achieve. I would like to thank EACH one of our guests for being part of this project: Mat & Matt, Niklas and Jørgen, Corey, Alan, Addi, Brent, Vegard, Sivert, Anders, Rob, Jerome, Johanna, and Nicke. I LOVE you all from here to the moon and back! Without the passion and heart you granted us, this wouldn’t have been possible!”\n\nPre-Order New Man, New Songs, Same Shit, Vol.1 HERE!\n\nAfter just having released the upbeat “Run With The Devil” featuring Jørgen Munkeby of the Norwegian Blackjazz collective Shining and the outlaw-infused “Burning Churches” featuring Mat McNerney of Grave Pleasures, ME AND THAT MAN have unveiled a third single – the gloomy, soulful “Surrender”, cut from New Man, New Songs, Same Shit, Vol.1.

It was the band's third consecutive UK Top 40 album - quite the feat for a heavy band - and took them on a tour which culminated with a huge show at London's iconic Roundhouse. But with follow-up Cannibal, the band have taken another leap forward.\n\nAlready, the South Coast quintet are responsible for some of metalcore's most rousing anthems, and Cannibal is stacked with more glorious vocal hooks, razor-sharp riffs and sublime melodies that will solidify their seat at UK metal's top table.\n\nTo record it, the band reunited with SikTh guitarist and Black Flame producer Dan Weller (Enter Shikari, Young Guns), while mixing and mastering was completed by Adam \"Nolly\" Getgood and Ermin Hamidovic, the dream team behind Architects' Holy Hell. The result is Bury Tomorrow's most technical, anthemic album yet. And while vocalist Dani Winter Bates has long been one of metal's loudest advocates for the importance of discussing mental health, this time he's delved explicitly into his own experiences, writing his most brutally personal lyrics to date.\n\n\"This album is for me as well as for the fans,\" he says. \"It was a cathartic process to address some of the darkest moments I've had in my life. For some people it'll be a hard listen. But I thought I have to do this, if I'm going to go in, I'm going to go in. I'm not doing something half arsed. There is nothing lyrically I would change on this entire album.\"\n\nWhen Dani began writing the concepts for Cannibal, while he had penned tracks about his mental health before, this time things were different. Dropping all metaphors and opaque sentiments, he's addressed things head on, hoping the album's unapologetically frank approach will help people who are struggling to understand that they aren't alone.\n\n\"I wanted to live by my words,\" he says. \"I talk to people about normalising mental health (Dani has facilitated Safe Space Sessions up and down the country during tours, alongside mental health professionals), so how can I write an album where I'm not talking about mental health? The normalisation of mental health is what saves lives. I want people to see the light in the dark. If they delve into that they can find solace in the discussion, the normalisation, the positive action by discussing this.\"\n\nLyrically, there's an apocalyptic feel to Cannibal. While tracks like Quake and Better Below go deep into Dani's lowest moments, the album also explores the impact of social media on Gods And Machines as well as what he refers to as \"society's oppressive, horrific nature\".\n\n\"The term Cannibal refers to being eaten away by your own thoughts but also eaten away by other humans,\" he explains. \"We're not kind to ourselves, let alone kind to each other.\"\n\nWhile Cannibal is very much Dani's story lyrically and thematically, the rest of the band are also on the form of their lives. The title track is a clear nod back to the anthemia of Black Flame's standout title-track and tracks like powerhouse opener Choke, The Grey (VIXI)and Imposter are classic Bury Tomorrow, metallic maelstroms of churning riffs and expansive choruses. Elsewhere though, the band have taken more risks than ever before, adding depth and shade to their ever-evolving sound. Quake ebbs and flows, swelling and simmering like a seething volcano and a techy edge cuts through the icy melody of Cold Sleep. And for all the album's dark ruminations, atmospheric closer Dark Infinite ends on a melodic high, a surging soundscape which sounds like the band are ready to take on the world.\n\nWork on Cannibal started almost immediately after the band released the deluxe version of Black Flame in June 2019 and was completed partly on the road. Soon after, the band headed to the studio, recording drums and rhythm guitars at Middle Farm studios, in South Devon, with the remainder of the album recorded at Vale studios in Worcestershire. Putting into practice the lessons they had learnt when making Black Flame, the band tore into, rewrote and scrapped any tracks that weren't up to scratch.\n\nWhile the process was far from easy and pushed the band musically and emotionally to their limit, there's no doubt that this is their best and bravest album to date. Now 14 years into their career, Cannibal will be the album that takes Bury Tomorrow to even greater heights. 2020 will be their year.\n\n\"I want it to grow our fan base and capitalise what we did with Black Flame,\" says Dani. \"Black Flame connected with a lot of people. I want Cannibal to take us to a new part of our career. It's a great starting point for a discussion, I'm excited for people to hear it.\"\n\nTRACKLISTING:\n\n1) Choke\n\n2) Cannibal\n\n3) The Grey (VIXI)\n\n4) Imposter\n\n5) Better Below\n\n6) The Agonist\n\n7) Quake\n\n8) Gods & Machines\n\n9) Voice & Truth\n\n10) Cold Sleep\n\n11) Dark Infinite\n\nThursday 9th January 2020\n\nTranscendent, two-time GRAMMY® Award-winning rock band, Evanescence, has released the official music video for their first new rock recording in eight years, \"The Chain (From Gears 5).\" Directed by frequent collaborator, P.R. Brown (My Chemical Romance, John Mayer, Green Day), the piece blends powerful, epic performance visuals with footage from the launch trailer for Xbox Game Studios' Gears 5 from the massively popular Gears of War franchise. To emulate the aesthetic of Gears 5, a miniature set was constructed for the music video that parallels the dystopian environment of the game. Watch it HERE, and listen to the song on all digital streaming platforms HERE.\n\n\"The lyrics make me feel the power of standing together against great forces trying to pull us apart, perhaps even from the inside. I really wanted to drive that home in our version,\" lead singer Amy Lee elaborates. P.R. Brown adds, \"The goal of the video is to show the bond of this band as they deliver a powerful take on a classic song. The tie in with Gears 5 presented an opportunity to combine the game world together with the band performance in a post-apocalyptic setting. The band emerges from the ashes to come together. We wanted to bring these worlds together and feel both the force of the band and the game.\"\n\nEvanescence unveiled their signature-rock version of the Fleetwood Mac classic in November, after Lee had lent her vocals to the Gears 5 launch trailer. The spot aired as part of a multi-million-dollar ad campaign in the fall in conjunction with the launch of the game. Watch it HERE. In addition, Gears 5 set new records as the biggest launch for any Xbox Game Studios game in this generation.\n\n\"The Chain\" marks the first release in what is expected to be a very active period for Evanescence. Following their foray into symphonic music with 2017's critically acclaimed Synthesis album and world tour, the five-piece reemerged by embracing a heavier sound, albeit with their trademark style that has made Evanescence integral in establishing a global, critical mass in rock, and among the most unique artists of the millennium. The band is currently working on new original music, which will start rolling out in 2020 in advance of their highly-anticipated fifth full-length studio album. Stay tuned for more details to come.\n\nOn March 29, Evanescence's spring tour dates commence with a performance at Download Festival in Tokyo, Japan. Shortly thereafter, the group will embark on a massive co-headline tour of Europe and the U.K. with Within Temptation that runs from April 4 to May 1.

Directed by the band’s own M. Shawn Crahan, the video captures a pummeling technicolor performance of “Nero Forte,” which is featured on the GRAMMY® Award-winning group’s chart-topping new album WE ARE NOT YOUR KIND.\n\nWE ARE NOT YOUR KIND is currently staking its claim as one of 2019’s top albums, earning #1 album nods from Rolling Stone and Kerrang! in their year-end roundups, alongside additional “Best of 2019” accolades from Revolver, Consequence of Sound, Loudwire, Alternative Press and more. “With their latest studio album, SLIPKNOT have released one of the strongest albums in their career,” remarked Consequence of Sound. The Ringer professed, “SLIPKNOT’s sixth album WE ARE NOT YOUR KIND… furthers the argument that they’re the most important heavy band of their era,” while Vulture praised the LP for its “maelstrom of serrated riffs, warlike drums, and machine-gun poetry from Taylor,” and the UK’s NME put it simply: “The 'Knot's sixth album is an astonishing record.”\n\n>Having just headlined Viva El Rock Fest in Lima, Peru alongside The Strokes and Interpol, SLIPKNOT will head to Europe this January for a headline arena tour featuring special guests Behemoth.
