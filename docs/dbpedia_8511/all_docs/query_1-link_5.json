        "text": "As 2023 marked the 30th anniversary of GG Allin’s death, I decided to commemorate the occasion by writing something about the infamous and anarchic musical artist. My attempt at an obituary (3 decades too late)\n\nIn the wild world of punk rock, there was no one quite like GG Allin. Born on 29th August 1956, Kevin Michael “GG” Allin was a controversial and enigmatic figure in the world of punk rock. GG’s tumultuous life and chaotic stage presence left an indelible mark on the music scene, even as he courted infamy through his extreme and often shocking performances. This notorious troublemaker left a sweaty (shitty?) imprint on everything he touched, raised eyebrows throughout his career, and frequently cleared rooms. GG Allin pushed the boundaries to the absolute limit. And then he pushed them a bit more.\n\nGG was actually given the name Jesus Christ Allin at birth by his fanatical and somewhat tyrannical father, but this was later changed by his mother shortly before school in the hopes of giving him a normal childhood. Alas, the damage was probably already done. Interestingly, his older brother, Merle, was unable to pronounce “Jesus” and could only manage “Jeje.” This would later permutate into “GG”! Merle Allin is featured extensively in the documentary The Allins and is a likeable and down-to-earth (albeit eccentric) character.\n\nHailing from a small town called Lancaster in New Hampshire, GG Allin was a rebellious spirit from a young age. A punk provocateur was brewing, and his early exposure to the scene in the 1970s fuelled a passion for the raw, unbridled energy of the genre. GG’s journey into the punkdom world began with a stint with the Jabbers, and he would later play with various bands, including Antiseen, Scumfucs, the Texas Nazis, Cedar St. Sluts, and the AIDS Brigade, before joining the Murder Junkies with his brother, Merle. It was here—and perhaps in his solo career—that GG truly unleashed the beast.\n\nAllin’s exploits were notorious for their unpredictability and transgressive nature. He became infamous for his confrontational stage antics, which included self-mutilation, nudity, and altercations with the audience. His party piece was to defecate on the stage floor and then lick it up or smear it over his naked body. And as you might expect, it wasn’t too wise to stand in the front row at one of GG’s gigs because when he wasn’t flinging faeces at the fans, he was probably punching them in the face.\n\nHis live shows were more than just music; they were turbid and often violent events that pushed the limits of what was acceptable in the punk community. Imagine a naked, wild-eyed maniac with a microphone—covered in cack and crude prison tattoos and usually dripping blood from every angle and orifice—and you’ve got GG Allin’s stage persona. His shows were less concerts and more like auditory roller coasters through the dark recesses of punk rock. The gig-goers never knew whether they were witnessing a musical spectacle or a performance art piece gone horribly, wonderfully wrong.\n\nIf you attended a GG Allin show, you weren’t just a spectator; you were an active participant in the chaos. GG had a peculiar talent for blending music with madness, often leaving the crowd in a state of shock and bewilderment. It was as if he took a crash course in punk etiquette and then threw the rulebook out the window. If you didn’t go home with a broken nose or stinking of shit, you probably weren’t there, man.\n\nGG’s music was a reflection of his turbulent life, characterised by themes of violence, nihilism, and anti-authoritarianism. His lyrics were antagonistic and raw, mirroring his disdain for society’s norms. His tastes extended beyond punk and encompassed elements of country, rock, and pop (although always from an abrasive and contentious perspective). Despite the controversy surrounding his persona, GG Allin gained a cult following, attracting fans who were drawn to the authenticity and audacity of his performances. GG Allin was the punk rock renegade who took rebellion to a whole new level. His disregard for social conventions made him a walking, talking middle finger to conformity. He set out to provoke, offend, and disturb not just his devotees but society as a whole. And in this endeavour, he did very well indeed.\n\nBeyond the stage, GG’s personal life was marked by legal troubles and a disorderly relationship with the law. His confrontational attitude extended beyond his music, resulting in numerous arrests and legal issues throughout his life. In fact, his encounters with the law were as frequent as his disregard for clothing conventions. Legal troubles followed him like a punk rock shadow, a testament to his commitment to living life on the edge and occasionally on the wrong side of the law.\n\nDespite these challenges, GG remained unapologetic, embracing a lifestyle that rejected societal expectations and further cemented his reputation as a true musical outlaw. In late 1989, Allin was arrested and charged with “assault with intent to do great bodily harm less than murder” of a fan, and he was sentenced to approximately 18 months in prison. Allin kept a diary while incarcerated, and this account was later published as My Prison Walls. The book is well worth getting if you’re a fan, as it includes lyrics and prison etchings but also speaks a lot about wanking.\n\nAfter his release from prison, Allin skipped his parole to go on tour once more, which was filmed for the cult documentary Hated (which was my first introduction to GG Allin and the Murder Junkies, like many others, I suspect). The film includes interviews, backstage footage, and GG’s final performance in New York, which resulted in a riot, and this night of carnage is perhaps a fitting end to GG’s career. He was found dead the next day at the age of 36, having died of a heroin overdose.\n\nWhile GG Allin’s extreme behaviour and cantankerous approach may have alienated some, it is essential to acknowledge the impact he had on the punk rock subculture. His defiant rejection of society challenged the status quo and inspired a generation of musicians to embrace authenticity and rebellion. And in truth, the music scene—in particular, the world of punk—is the only place where GG’s troubled life could place him or make any sense. A life of rock and roll excess, mainly on the road (or on the run), was his natural habitat.\n\nIn the annals of punk rock history, GG Allin remains a polarising figure. Some view him as a punk prophet, a wild spirit who dared to challenge the parameters of rock and roll. Others see him as a cautionary tale, a reminder that too much punk can be hazardous to your health. Whichever side you land on, there’s no denying the impact of GG Allin on the punk rock ethos.\n\nSpeaking personally, I’ve been a fan of GG Allin since I was 13 years old, and his influence on me has been huge. The similarities include being bald, flabby, and having a tiny penis, as well as dodgy facial hair and inappropriate tattoos. And while he is possibly the kind of character I’d try to avoid sitting next to on a bus, I would have loved to attend one of his shows.\n\nThe Murder Junkies, incidentally, still exist and include key members Merle Allin and Dino Sex. I actually had tickets to see them in Texas for their 30th anniversary tour, which was sadly cancelled after Merle had an accident.\n\nGG Allin’s life may be remembered as a tempestuous whirlwind of controversy, but within that chaos, there was an undeniable honesty and a refusal to conform. As we reflect on GG’s turbulent legacy, let’s raise a metaphorical glass (or maybe a brown bag-wrapped bottle) to the man who lived life on his terms, even if those terms were a bit unconventional. GG Allin may be gone, but his spirit lives on in the anarchic chords of punk rock and the memories of those brave enough to witness his chaotic, nude, and bloodied performances. Cheers to you, GG, wherever you are—hopefully causing a ruckus in punk rock heaven. Or maybe he’d prefer hell."
