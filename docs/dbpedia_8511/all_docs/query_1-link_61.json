        "text": "1. Above all be “honest”, “DIY” and “Politically Radical”\n\n2. If a review for your band doesn’t include the words “honest”, “DIY” or “Politically Radical” at least once you have failed!\n\n3. Never learn to sing properly. It’s more “honest” that way.\n\n4. If you can sing, try and sound like you can’t.\n\n5. Sing all gruff as hell or in an awkward adolescent falsetto. There is NO compromise in between.\n\n6. Claim to be staying true to the roots and traditions of folk music as a voice of the working class.\n\n7. ….Never bother learning any traditional pieces though.\n\n8. Claim to be staying true to the roots and traditions of punk music as a voice of the working class.\n\n9. ….But get deeply offended when you hear Oi music.\n\n10. You get bonus points for wearing anachronistic clothing on stage. Double points for flatcaps.\n\n11. If having the ideals of radical punk icoclast seems too much then just dress like Billy Bragg. People will project and assume you have those ideals anyway.\n\n12. Why aren’t you trying to look as much like Billy Bragg anyway?\n\n13. Some may find your political music irritating but it is still far less obnoxious use of an acoustic than hitting drunk girls by covering “Drive”.\n\n14. GG Allin’s acoustic stuff is not folk punk! I don’t know how to explain this, it just isn’t!\n\n15. If anyone asks you are not indie! You are punk rock!\n\n16. Just listening to “Fairy Tale of New York” when it’s on at Christmas isn’t enough to say you like folk punk!\n\n17. For the last time, you are not indie! You are punk!\n\n18. Even if you sound like (and are influenced by) the Mountain Goats and The Decemberists.\n\n19. If you can’t afford or inherit any of those expensive mandolins, banjos and upright basses then just spring for a thrift store ukulele. They are traditional in Hawaii so they still count, right?\n\n20. If you are somehow rocking out enough for people to start dancing then be offended.\n\n21. Sell second hand radical socialist pamphlets at your gigs instead of t-shirts.\n\n22. Money is evil and so is the record industry! Be truly DIY and put your music for free online.\n\n23. In fact don’t charge for shows either. It’s more DIY!\n\n24. When you see Against Me! make vague grumblings about how you might not bother seeing their next show.\n\n25. See Against Me! every time they are in town.\n\n26. Stuck for song topics? Try one of the following:\n\na) growing old\n\nb) bicycles\n\nc) coffee, whiskey or coffee with whiskey mixed in\n\nd) good times with friends\n\ne) hopping trains and dumpster diving\n\nf) the corporate media, schools, police and other institutions selling a psychologial acceptance of authority to the masses\n\ng) and most importantly…pirates. Lots of songs of pirates\n\n27. The revolution will not be amplified\n\n28. In the case of larger venues, the revolution will not even be audible.\n\n29. Frontmen are for egomanical rockstars and other such patriarchal fascists. Try and have as many of your band members sing on a song as possible instead.\n\n30. Claim to be above the “punk uniform” of Street Punks yet still somehow go out of your way to dress like a homeless person or in an old-timey dust bowl costume that can’t possibly be your regular clothes.\n\n31. Use all of the effort other punks put into being threatening into being precociously adorable instead.\n\n32. You are not a singer-songwriter. You are a Troubadour!\n\n33. You are not a musician. You are an Activist!\n\n34. You don’t own a record label. You are Part of a Music Collective!\n\n35. You are not an anarchist. You are just a Radical Progressive….who wants all the world governments to be dissolved.\n\n36. Use the word radical as often as you can in interviews to describe your politics, as the word anarchist might scare people.\n\n37. If people accuse you of just thieving music from other countries you havent even visited then defend yourself by saying your great grandmother was totally Irish/Hungarian/Roma/Wookie/whatever so it’s ok.\n\n38. Never use distorted guitars! See rule 27!\n\n39. Ok, perhaps just a little distorted guitar on the solo.\n\n40. Maybe on a couple of songs it won’t hurt.\n\n41. Oh crap the whole album is distorted electric guitars now. That’s not very folk.\n\n42. Screw that, Rule 38 is now never use distorted guitars until your second album.\n\n43. Oh crap, you are melodic beard-punk now, break up and become a solo acoustic act instead.\n\n44. Only ever sing about how nice you are and how you have the right opinions with a naive hope for the future\n\n45. …unless you are Pat The Bunny or Andrew Jackson Jihad.\n\n46. …and unless you are doing a Crass cover.\n\n47. Going the outlaw country revival direction instead of 60s agit-pop folk direction is only ok if you used to front a more popular band.\n\n48. Cite Phil Ochs, Woodie Guthrie, The Pogues and Billy Bragg as influences so you seem “folky”\n\n49. Once you have those four down you can have as many anarcho- and crust punk bands for influences as you want\n\n50. Your band and scene is inclusive of all people of races, creeds and sexualities.\n\n51. Prove this by letting a girl sing on one of your tracks.\n\n52. If you are from ANYWHERE in continental Europe you might as well get used to American critics calling you gypsy punk\n\n53. If you are American you might as well get used to being compared to Against Me! though they went electric ages ago.\n\n54. If you are English you might as well get used to being compared to Frank Turner.\n\n55. If you are Irish or Scottish you might as well get used to being compared to the Dropkick Murphys (even though they are American).\n\n56. And NO the Dropkick Murphys are NOT folk punk.\n\n57. Neither are Flogging Molly. Celtic punk is a different genre….for some reason.\n\n58. Always stress how you want a unified scene accepting of all.\n\n59. Everyone except street punks of course. Those guys are look silly.\n\n60. Electric guitars are only acceptable if they have that 1950s retro look.\n\n61. Write awesome guitar solos for your recordings if you must but never perform them at live shows (also known as the Mischief Brew rule)\n\n62. Violin/Accordion/Mandolin interludes > Guitar solos.\n\n63. Include as many different instruments played by as many different people as you can on your recordings.\n\n64. End up touring live with only two or three) members anyway as you can’t afford travel for anyone else to come (see rules 22 and 23)\n\n65. If you have a mohawk, cut it off and grow a beard (if you are old enough at least).\n\n66. Or at least cover it up with a flat cap (see 10)\n\n67. If you get tired of stressing how punk you are then let the critics call you anti-folk instead.\n\n68. Only play All Ages shows. Mainly out of necessity, you are probably way under 21 or at least look like you are 14..\n\n69. You forgot to mention Joan Baez as an influence, didn’t you? Fucking sexist!\n\n70. Can’t find a venue to play? Try these intimate locales: Your high school, Your local OWS protest, Your friend’s couch, A laundromat, A squat, A coffeee shop, a gutter.\n\n71. Despite your best instincts put a This Bike is A Pipe Bomb sticker on your bike.\n\n72. Bandanas are double points as well. Particularly if your pet dog has one.\n\n73. Get a member who can play the banjo. It’s not necessary, I just really like the banjo and think more bands need one.\n\n74. Stuck for material? Just do acoustic versions of your old bands songs. Its what your fans wanted in the first place.\n\n75. Be nostalgic for the old days. Those times were more honest.\n\n76. I realise for a lot of you the old days mean the Clinton years. I mean back further than that.\n\n77. You can still release stuff by digital download even if you are being nostalgic though.\n\n78. Make sure you look like over-eager camp counselors in your official band photo.\n\n79. Always listen to and support the opening act. After all it’s the only slot most folk punk bands can get.\n\n80. Eventually be so focused on being non-offensive, nice and inclusive you totally drop the activist part entirely in case having a different opinion upsets anyone.\n\n81. Own at least one Black Flag shirt (or Black Flag parody shirt) to assert your punk cred.\n\n82. Remember being “passionate” is more important than knowing how to tune a violin.\n\n83. If none of your friends can draw that doesn’t necessarily mean they can’t design your album cover. It is a free download so who cares?\n\n84. Have too many members to maintain a constant line-up as it’s a nightmare to get everyone to commit to rehearsal.\n\n85. Don’t worry thats a good thing. It means your band is a “DIY project created by an evolving collective of like-minded artistic individuals”\n\n86. Morris dancing isn’t yet confirmed as folk punk but you may want to try it to be on the safe side.\n\n87. Medieval fairs are not folk punk. Too many dead animals. Go to a vegan potluck instead.\n\n88. No! You can’t wear a fedora instead of a flatcap! That’s Erik Petersen’s thing!\n\n89. Even though your music is extremely white and European it is still acceptable to get dreadlocks.\n\n90. Tell people Woodie Guthrie was the original punk, no matter how weird and off that sounds.\n\n91. And Sea shanties were the original folk punk songs.\n\n92. Just because your lyrics are supposed to be a personal at current issues this is no reason not to pretend you are a 1980s British coal miner…\n\n93. Or a Victorian cotton mill Worker…\n\n94. Or a Medieval blacksmith…\n\n95. Or a Pangean hunter-gatherer. Actually maybe that’s too far back.\n\n96. If a band member wants an extra instrument credit then just buy them a pennywhistle. If you are a solo act then get a harmonica and neck rack.\n\n97. If possible try and get a new sub genre name invented for your music like traveller-punk or pirate-skiffle. It won’t work but try anyway.\n\n98. And no, you aren’t “World Music” either! What on earth does that even mean?\n\n99. Yes I know in folk METAL they get to sing about cool things like dragons and trolls and Tolkien folklore and stuff but you can’t! You made your choice. Deal with it.\n\n100. Even though that would be awesome.\n\n101. Please don’t take this list seriously."
