Something like \"your lineage will only get you this far. You're on your, what, seventh album about whiskey, pot, shrooms and why you love GG Allin.\"\n\nLike I said, could be hearsay, but he's rubbed people the wrong way in the bible belt for a long time. Allegedly.\n\nI think he's great. He's a so-so guitar player at best, but a very good songwriter."
