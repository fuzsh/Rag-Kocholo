        "text": "To be released: Sept. 1.\n\nAngel Taylor’s debut album,” “Love Travels,” is a lush and lilting treatment on pop. It’s a sugarcoated production to be sure, but honest enough around the edges to keep things from becoming too sappy.\n\nOf course it’s all about love and dating and the occasional heartache. What pop song isn’t, really? What Taylor brings to the table that sets her apart is a voice with enough quirks to make her stand out in a crowded genre of wannabe Lisa Loebs.\n\nTake “Like You Do,” a light track about love affirmed. Taylor employs a gorgeous husky whisper at times, and pours on the vocal energy as the pace quickens. She keeps the track from succumbing to the session musician bore it might have otherwise been.\n\nTaylor’s voice, with its adorable squeaks sprinkled here and there, is the secret weapon here and makes “Love Travels” one of the top debut albums of the year.\n\nCheck this track out: “Spinning Wheels” is one of the top tracks on the album, with its winning hook. “I’ll keep you locked up so tight in my pocket / until you decide to slow down I’ll keep spinning wheels,” Taylor sings as the song races along. Love is always tested on Taylor’s songs, but never defeated.\n\nReleased: June 9.\n\nOn the hit single “Boyfriend 2,” from Pleasure P’s debut album, “The Introduction of Marcus Cooper,” nice guys finish first, and who wants that? Better to fill in the gaps, especially since “the first one, he don’t really / seem like he know what to do.”\n\nThis sort of unlikely romance is just what Pleasure P perfected as part of the Florida R&B outfit Pretty Ricky, which he left in 2007. With absurd outfits and overpoweringly frank lyrics, Pretty Ricky was a virtual parody of hypersexed R&B boy bands. Yet beneath its flash were crisp songwriting and alluring melody, credit for which the group will never fully get.\n\nWhich is why, presumably, Pleasure P left the carnival act behind, trading it in for this set of generally earnest proclamations of love. “Boyfriend 2” is a red herring, it turns out; Pleasure P just wants to be loved. On “Tender Roni (Handcuffin)” he’s tired of playing second fiddle: “I ain’t with that creeping no more.” And on the aquatic-theme seduction “Under” (produced by the underrated soul singer-songwriter Tank) he’s slick enough to overcome heavy metaphor.\n\nPleasure P’s voice is nimble but unremarkable. Every now and again, though, he injects the ferocious, moist sexuality of a Bobby Brown or an Aaron Hall, turning even these conventional songs into something far more radiant. “Did You Wrong” features this album’s most devastating moments: “I did you wrong / You did me wrong,” He howls with a fervor that approaches gospel-like intensity. “I take you back / You take me back.”\n\nBy the song’s end he sounds as if he’s on both knees, pleading his case. “I’m just talking a whole lot of jibber-jabber,” he says, words tumbling out of his mouth in fits and starts. “But me without you is like the moon without the sun. And the sun without the moon. And Pleasure P without Pretty Ricky.” Is that a twinge of regret?\n\nReleased: June 23.\n\nWhat is it with former punks going country and acoustic on us? The thread connecting grizzled anarchists and outlaw twang is longer and stronger than most of us realize, which helps explain Evan Dando’s new covers record.\n\nComposed of songs Dando heard on cassettes given to him by B.H. Surfers leader Gibby Haynes over the years, “Varshons” trades the poppy guitar sound of 2006’s “The Lemonheads” for a leaner Nashville, Tenn. aesthetic. High female harmonies and plucked country accents dot Dando’s take on Gram Parson’s “I Just Can’t Take It Anymore,” while G.G. Allin’s “Layin’ Up with Linda” gets an improbably straight-faced treatment.\n\nDando has always indulged his weirder impulses, which explains the disposable cover of “Beautiful” (Christina Aguilera he is not) and the ‘80s-inflected throwaway “Dirty Robot,” featuring a lost, tired-sounding Kate Moss on vocals.\n\nMissteps aside, the lilting “Hey, That’s No Way to Say Goodbye” does justice to Leonard Cohen’s devastating original, while Townes Van Zandt’s “Waiting Around to Die” begs to be blasted from your rusty pickup while hurtling through the desert at midnight. “Varshons” is more a collection of curios than a proper album, but they’re worth exploring when the results are this compelling.\n\nReleased: May 12.\n\nAs Walon, a recovering heroin addict on HBO’s “The Wire,” Steve Earle coached fellow junkie Bubbles into sobriety. Earle’s personal history of abuse made the performance painfully true-to-life, and the same gritty realism can be found on every track of “Townes,” a collection of covers of the late Townes Van Zandt.\n\nVan Zandt was Earle’s mentor and greatest inspiration. Earle’s gravelly road-worn voice couldn’t be further from Van Zandt’s, yet the songs contain a palpable sense of understanding.\n\nThe minimalist, street corner love song of geographical yearning, “Colorado Girl,” feels as natural as “Delta Momma Blues,” a bluegrass waltz that grows increasingly lush with each rotation.\n\n“This might be the best record I’ve ever made,” Earle boasts on his Web site. No arguments here.\n\nReleased: June 23.\n\nGrammy-winning prog-rock wizards The Mars Volta show a softer side but still rock hard on their fifth studio outing, “Octahedron.”\n\nA creative partnership between guitarist Omar Rodriguez-Lopez and vocalist Cedric Bixler-Zavala — who breathe life into their collaborations with the help of various musicians — The Mars Volta soar just as high with acoustic guitars and piano arrangements as they do with blazing riffs and space-rock atmosphere.\n\nThe prolific Rodriguez-Lopez effortlessly weaves elements of punk, funk, psychedelia, jazz fusion and Latin grooves into the mix, while Bixler-Zavala teams a scorching falsetto with an impressive vocabulary on his abstract, metaphorical vocals.\n\nThey kick off with a light touch on “Since We’ve Been Wrong” and bring some serious spaced-out funk-rock on “Teflon” and the dynamic “Halo Of Nembutals.” “With Twilight As My Guide” sounds just like its title with gloomy acoustics and haunting guitar effects, and “Desperate Graves” is a dose of post-hardcore aggression.\n\nThe disc closes with the manic 1-2 punch of “Copernicus,” which floats into deep electronics, and the cryptic “Luciforms,” with a trippy opening that builds into wah-wah euphoria.\n\nAnd euphoric is exactly what “Octahedron” is — yet another indispensable entry in The Mars Volta’s already impressive catalogue.\n\nCheck this track out: “Cotopaxi” kicks hard from start to finish and features a ferocious performance by drummer Thomas Pridgen."
