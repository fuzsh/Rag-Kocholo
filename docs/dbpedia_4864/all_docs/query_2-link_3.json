        "text": "Young, pretty Millicent Deming proved to be a more apt businesswoman than she was an actress – she worked in a modeling agency as a tutor from her late teens, and later was successful in real estate and had her very own modeling agency. too bad her acting career was so thin… Let’s find out more about her…\n\nEARLY LIFE\n\nMillicent Louise Deming was born on June 12, 1933, in Los Angeles, California, to Robert Edwards Deming and Mildred Fulton. Her father came from a progressive Iowa family – his older brother was William Edwards Deming, a prominent 20th century engineer, statistician, professor, author, lecturer, and management consultant. Robert worked as a super service station proprietor (I have no idea what it is, but it’s written like this on the 1930 census so go figure?)\n\nMillicent grew up in a upper middle class family in Los Angeles, and discovered her love for acting from an early age. Here is a short article about her social life from the late 1940s:\n\nVisitors Coming from Bel Air to attend the junior-senior prom at [shadow Mountain Club tonight is pretty Millicent Deming, who will be squired by Kenny Jackson of P. S. High. Miss Deming has taken junior parts in several movie shorts, one of which was shot down here at the airport with Kenny playing opposite her. She will he the house guest of Mrs. Mildred Jackson\n\nMillicent became a successful businesswoman early in life, before she graduated from high school. Her father opened a modeling school where she worked as a instructor, giving girls lessons in how to be feminine and pose for the camera. On the side, she also worked as a secretary for famous impresario Nils Grauland, and did a nightly KTSL (2) show. She met the right people, and it was only a matter of time before she landed in Hollywood.\n\nCAREER\n\nMillicent’s first movie was Two Tickets to Broadway, the all too familiar musical with tons of unknown actresses playing chorus girls (I think that about 7 or 8 actresses I profiled here actually had an uncredited role in that movie). There is nothing much to say about it, it’s a lower mid tier musical with a moronic story, colorful cinematography and sadly forgettable music. Skip.\n\nMillicent’s second, much better movie, was The Garment Jungle, a bag of mixed pleasures. Basically a racket movie, it’s part film noir with dramatic touches, a so-so mesh of it’s two directors – Vincent Sherman and Robert Aldrich. And boy, we can hardly find two such disparate directors!Sherman was known as a woman’s director in the vein of George Cukor – he excelled in melodrama and worked with great divas like Miriam Hopkins, Joan Crawford and Bette Davis. Robert Aldrich was the master of unseen violence, one of the few directors that showed what a phantom menace looks like. Combine them and you have an interesting experiment – not a completely successful one, mind you. The movie, which ended up begin completely unknown afterwards – has flashes of brilliance as much as some truly dismal parts. The story is nothing to gape about – racketeering in the garment district of New York – but it works as a framing device for some very relevant questions and punches you hard when you finally realize that those things happened in real life. Oh yes, people literary died in these rackets. The actors are a mixed bag too. There are wonderful actors like Lee J. Cobb and , and on the other hand, we have Kerwin Matthews in the lead, handsome enough but a total wooden pole. However, the atmosphere and the style overall is superb. There is much “angry silence”, menace and doom in the air, and you can easily feel that Robert Aldrich did a large portion of the movie. It’s his signature style – brutal yet always subtle. Sherman infuses the more “intimate parts”, and they are lacking compared to the rest of the movie. The female love interest, played by Gia Scala, is so marginal to the story it’s almost sad, and Matthews was too thin an actor to truly pull of the more challenging gentle scenes. If you could pull out the redundant cheesy side of the movie, It’s almost a wonderful film noir, and it’s a shame it so neglected today, despite it’s shortcomings.\n\nMillicent did some TV work (Peter Gunn) before retiring from acting for good.\n\nPRIVATE LIFE\n\nMillicent was 5’ 6”, 34-23-34, blonde haired and hazel eyed. In 1951, at just 18 years old, Millicent was engaged to Serge Ross, a Hollywood stalwart. The engagement was terminated, and she was seen around town with well known attorney Milton Golden.\n\nMillicent married John Anthony Restifo on May 5, 1953. Restifo was born on December 30, 1916, in Washington DC, to Thomas Charles Restifo and Madeleine DiCamillo. He was the oldest of four children (John, Joseph, Nancy and Margaret). His father, who ran a successful beverage business, died sometime in the late 1930s. His mother took over as the head of the business, running it with John and his brother Joseph. John moved to Los Angeles a few years later, along with his mother, and there met Millicent. Little is known of the marriage. They divorced in the late 1950s. Sadly, Restifo died in Mexico in 1964.\n\nMillicent married her second husband, Jorge Ugalde, sometime after the divorce. Their son Mark was born on July 31, 1962 in Mexico City. They divorced in 1963 and Millicent returned to the US.\n\nMillcent married, for the third time, to Gerald Fishbein on January 29, 1964. Fishbein was born on March 12, 1930, to Joseph Fishbein and Esther Levin. His younger sister Joan was born in 1940. His father was a successful jewelry salesman – they always had a servant in the household. His parents moved to New York not long after his birth. They lived in Queens where Gerald grew up. Gerald returned to California at some point.\n\nGerald adopted Mark, and Millicent and Gerald’s only child, daughter Leslie, was born on March 17, 1966. After living n Los Angeles with a lofty social life, Millicent and Gerald divorced on December 22, 1982. He married Emily S. Adehlson in 1985 and continued living in California.\n\nMillcent married her third husband, William T. Reynolds, on April 6, 1985. Born in Trenton, New Jersey, February 11, 1923, to parents William Titus Reynolds, Sr. and Mary Knode Reynolds, he attended schools in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Florida before moving to California following service in the Pacific Theatre during World War II. He was a graduate of the University of Southern California with a B.S. in Finance (Magna Cum Laude), and an M.B.A. He had a long career in financial services. While in graduate school, he was employed by Hill Richards & Co. in Los Angeles. In Pasadena, he was broker/manager at Blyth & Co., later Blyth Eastman Dillon, Paine Webber and, finally, UBS. He was a Past President of the Bond Club. Reynolds was married once before, to Mary Electa Nehman, and they had three daughters: Cornelia, (born on June 30, 1948), Electa (born on October 28, 1950), and Rosemary (born on May 12, 1953).\n\nNever the one to sit idly after the demise of her acting career Millicent ran the Millicent Deming Commercial Modeling Studio for several decades, and has been a licensed real estate agent in California for 37 years and is currently with Exclusive Estate Properties in Northern Hollywood. Millicent focuses on Pasadena, where she has lived for many years.\n\nAs for her civic life, Millicent served as Member of the Advisory Committee of The Pasadena Symphony among others. Sadly, Millicent and William divorced in the 1990s or 2000s. Millicent moved to La Canada-Flintridge after the divorce.\n\nWiliam T. Reynolds died on April 9, 2013 in San Gabriel.\n\nMillicent Deming Reynolds lives in California today.\n\nA stunning model who went to Hollywood hoping for fame and fortune, Georgia Clancy was one of many that never amounted to much in the movie world. Yet, after both her acting and modeling careers were over, she became a highly successful executive and paved her own way in life. Let’s learn more about her!\n\nEARLY LIFE\n\nGeorgia V. Clancy was born on October 10, 1924, in Sayre, Beckham County, Oklahoma, to Elmzey George Clancy and Mary Etta Hervey. She was the second of four children – her older brother was Alvin, born on February 19, 1923, and her younger siblings were Helen, born in 1931 and Mary, born in 1932. Both of her parents were native Oklahomans.\n\nThe family moved from Sayre, Oklahoma to Texas for a brief time in 1932, (her sister Mary was born there), then back to Oklahoma (San Francisco, Oklahoma, yep, that place really exists) and finally to Compton, California in 1936. Georgia’s father was a carpenter and had his own carpenters workshop – her mother helped manage it. Both Alvin and Georgia worked at the workshop since their early teens – by the time she was 16 years old, she racked up quite a bit of work hours per week.\n\nwanting for a better life, Georgia decided to try her luck in New York, where she went after graduating from high school. Not long after she became a premier bathing suit model and was summoned to Hollywood for the movie Bitter Victory in 1948.\n\nCAREER\n\nGeorgia landed in Hollywood in 1948, under this guise: “Georgia Clancy, America’s top bathing suit model who became a mannequin hoping it would lead to an acting career, recently reached second base in her campaign to become a screen actress. The beauteous redhead rounded first base in the self-same campaign last week when Paramount called her to play herself in fashion salon sequences for “Bitter Victory.” She was one of the premier New York models sent to Los Angeles – the others were Billie Fuchs, Maruja, Vivian Easton, Georgia, Yvette Koris and Gini Adams.\n\nThe movie never being made (a Bitter Victory movie was made later, in the 1950s, with Richard Burton), Georgia opted to stay in Los Angeles and actually made her Hollywood debut in Neptune’s Daughter, one of the better Esther Williams extravaganzas. What can I say – they were top of the art in terms of technical excellence and innovation, but did not have back then, nor now, any big artistic merit. But they are nice’n’easy viewing for an afternoon movie session.\n\nIn 1950, Georgia actually had a speaking role in Buccaneer’s Girl, a movie low-budget, thin plot and mid tier actors – but still despite al of this a very amusing movie. Yvonne de Carlo plays the female pirate (while never a big talent, and IMHO not a particularly beautiful woman – I know many will disagree with me on this, but I just don’t find her attractive, De Carlo was superb for these swashbuckler roles and had a certain charisma).\n\nGeorgia then appeared in two very good movies: The Furies and September Affair. Both are examples of superb classic Hollywood film-making, despite their relative obscurity today. The first one is a interesting psychological western centering on a dysfunctional but passionate father/daughter relationship (between Barbara Stanwyck and Walter Huston – two top actors!!!!). The second movie is one of the best tear-jerkers I’ve even watched – this is how sad movies are done, people! The story has to be a bit far-fetched (otherwise you’ll never get the over-the-top drama much movies need), actors should be top-notch and truly earnest in their roles, the direction should be unobtrusive and slightly, and their should be plenty of truly emotional moments. September affairs has all of this and one. Joan Fontaine and Joseph Cotten are wonderful in their roles. Gorgeous music (the title song, September Affair, was sung by Walter Huston!!! Love that man!!) and great cinematography are a well-earned bonus. Definitely put this on your watching list if you like it elegant and tragic.\n\nGeorgia’s last movie was the mediocre Two Tickets to Broadway, which I have reviewed to many times on this page to make it relevant anymore…\n\nAnd that was it from Georgia!\n\nPRIVATE LIFE\n\nWhen Georgia came to Hollywood in 1948, there were serious tries to make her more accessible to the public by mentioning the frequently in inconsequential articles, like this one:\n\nThe legend that fashion models get their pick of handsome he-men is a lot of bunk, a green-eyed beauty said today. All she ever meets on the job is a flock of balding grandpas with romantic ideas.. Georgia Clancy, speaking. America’s highest-priced bathing suit mannequin. She has red hair and enough curves to keep a strapless swim suit from slipping. She’s also an expert at broken-field running. “You have to be quick,” says Miss Clancy with a shrug of her bare shoulders. “A lot of buyers get lonesome on out-of-town trips:” Georgia spends her working hours strutting her stuff before the delighted eyes of middle-aged executives. ‘ “We don’t have to date the visiting firemen if we don’t want to,” she explained. “But we have to be tactful in brushing them off. “When some homesick gent asks me out I usually smile and say, ‘oh, I’d love to, but mother expects me home for dinner.’ ” If she knows he’s married, it’s even easier. “I just hint,” she purred, “I’m certain his wife wouldn’t like my alienating his affections.” And she usually can tell a wolf before he even has time to make a pass. “Then I twist my signet ring around so it looks like a wedding ring,” she said. “It also helps to tell him I’m married to an all-American football tackle.” Miss Clancy’s in Hollywood with two other models for Producer Hal Wallis’ “Bitter Victory.” They have the same troubles she does…\n\nit didn’t work, and she remained an unknown. After her Hollywood career evaporated Georgia returned to modeling. Sadly, in the 1950s not many women over the age of 35 worked as models, and the same applied to Georgia, who more or less had to retire by necessity not choice.\n\nHowever, Georgia was far from disillusioned – she seeked her fortune elsewhere and became the number one executive of A.P. Management Corporation, run by the ever-interesting Al Petker. Taken from a newspaper article:\n\nIf radio isn’t dead yet and it isn’t much of the credit for keeping its pulse going can be claimed by Al Petker, known in the trade as The Contest Man. There can hardly be a man alive who has not heard a Petker-inspired contest on air. He services some 8,500 disk jockey shows on 1,800 radio stations and also takes care of 119 TV stations with his two going enterprises: Gifts for Listeners and Gifts for Viewers. Whenever you hear a promotion contest on the air with a variety of prizes clocks, radios, watches being offered, you can take odds that it was Petker who dreamed up the idea and Petker who supplies the prizes. The prizes, literally thousands of them, are stored in a warehouse in Beverly Hills. It is, in fact, the only warehouse in Beverly Hills, a city which is very touchy about anything more commercial than selling mink stoles or poodle haircuts. He has his warehouse there, plus a luxurious swimming pool-home. He even maintains cordial relations with the Beverly Hills post office which handles an average of 2,000 Petker-pushed parcels every month and writes him fan letters about the nice way he wraps and addresses them\n\nPetker, who only two years ago was flat broke, is today quite wealthy. Al’s income, of course, comes from the manufacturers of the products he gives away through the disk jockeys. They pay him an annual fee, in return for which he sees to it that the product is handsomely mentioned on the air in such a way that it not only doesn’t sound hike a commercial but doesn’t cost what a commercial would cost. He has, made a legitimate, good business out of what used to be (and in many Instances still is) a low earnign industry in the broadcasting business. When, for example, a comedian’s writers build a Joke or a sketch around some commercial products, such as a refrigerator, the writers are quietly rewarded by the refrigerator pee-pic. Petker is only 37; stands an even six-feet and is handsomely mustachioed. He lives , with his wife and two children and. an 8-month-old Russian wolfhound, and runs his A. P. Management Corp. (along with a dozen other related corporations) with the help’ of Georgia Clancy. Clancy, as she is invariably called, is his executive vice president and would be the hands-down winner of any contest for the most fetching executive v. p. in the world. But the Petker people have no interest in winning contests. They just like to run them. Pays better that way.\n\nGeorgia was by all accounts never married and the papers never mentioned a significant other.\n\nGeorgia Clancy died on March 8, 1981, in California.\n\nBlonde, vivacious and beautiful, Reita Green was a star dancer at a beloved dancing troupe from the time she was 16 years old – she showed plenty of promise to make it as an actress. She did find her way to Hollywood and astudio contract, but unfortunately this is were the story ends – after a few uncredited roles, she gave up the stage for motherhood.\n\nEARLY LIFE\n\nReita Ann Green was born on April 15, 1936, in Scotland City, South Dakota, to Lloyd Green and Valeria Cach. Her older sister, Gloria, was born in 1935. Her father worked as a manager at a creamory – they made various creams, like ice cream and butter. Reita’s paternal cousin, Roger Green, lived with her and served as a helper for her father at the creamory business.\n\nThe family moved to Codington, South Dakota in the early 1940s, and after a brief time there, moved to Scottsbluff, Nebraska, where Reita grew up and attended high school. She was a gifted dancer and spent many hours immersed in dancing, with hopes of becoming a professional one day.\n\nReita danced only as an amateur, but her luck changed in 1950 (note that she was just 14 years old!!), when Horace Heidt’s touring Youth Opportunity program passed through the city. She auditioned for the show as a member of a dance duet. Heidt didn’t think the act had possibilities but was very impressed with the way she performed, and when an opening came in the show, sent for her and made her a regular member of the chorus. She then became a member of Heidt’s youthful Heidt-Steppers and appeared every Friday on his TV show, KLA. She was one of the youngest members of the troupe, and attended school every day along with other members of the troupe who were working toward finishing their formal education. Reita lived at Heidt’s ranch with 13 other performers who appear on the show. It was via Heidt that she landed in Hollywood.\n\nCAREER\n\nReita’s first movie was Indestructible Man, a Z class, trashy horror movie with Lon Chaney Jr. as the eponymous Indestructible man – a screaming, raving banshee avenger (who mutates after a death sentence goes horribly wrong and doesn’t kill him) out to get his scheming lawyer and pay back all her’s done to him. Stupid plot, low-budget, but if you like trash horror, than this is definitely something you should see. Lon Chaney Jr. is one of the best in the field, and the supporting cast is actually pretty decent – Max Showalter, Ross Elliot, Marian Carr.\n\nHer second feature was another lo-budget horror – Daughter of Dr. Jekyll. The name says it all (guess what the plot is about…) It’s predictable, it’s got bad specials effects and no great artistic merit, but it’s fun and it’s trashy. That same year, 1957, Reita graduated to higher quality movies – she appeared in Jeanne Eagels, a typical Hollywood 1950s biopic. That means – plot has no connection to the real life person, script is clichéd, acting is limited, pacing is choppy and often it’s over the top corny. Yup, Jeanne Eagles suffers from all of these maladies, although it has a few shining moments (it actually shows Jeanne’s alcoholism and some supporting actors are really good – Virginia Grey and Agnes Moorehead come to mind.) The leads, Kim Novak and Jeff Chandler, are beautiful and charismatic, but hardly decent thespians.\n\nReita then appeared as a chorine in The Joker Is Wild, actually a biopic made right. While not completely truthful to the source material, its got Frank Sinatra playing Joe E. Lewis and it works very nicely. The music is good and so is the supporting cast, so this one is a winner overall.\n\nIn 1958, Reita was a part of an Elvis Presley movie – King Creole. I’m no bog Elvis fan and find his movies lackluster, but that’s just my own personal taste. Reita’s last movie, where she finally had a normal, speaking role, was A Stranger in My Arms. It’s a movie that, at first glance, looks like an overblown Ross Hunter soaper, ends up a less than satisfying meditation on the nature of truth, lies and legacy. Yep, it’s deeper than it seems, it has the typical glossy veneer Hunter was famous for but still doesn’t make the grade totally. The dialogue is a bit off, and with some script doctoring, they could have made a semi classic. Too bad. The actors are a mixed bag also. On one side, we have Jeff Chandler and June Allyson, nice to look at but pretty much untalented, and on the other side you have acting greats Mary Astor and Charles Coburn. And Sandra Dee, a cute dynamo!!\n\nAfter this, Reita appeared in several Tv shows, and then left acting for good.\n\nPRIVATE LIFE\n\nIn 1951, Reita was involved in a car accident. The summary: Orchestra leader Horace Heidt and three members of his show troupe were injured Sunday in a sideswipe automobile collision 12 miles west of Elgin. Heidt’s nose was broken. Anthony Giansanti, 35, a saxophonist, suffered a fracture left wrist. Reita lost two front teeth, and her friend, Betty Cole, 16, of Houston, Tex., suffered from shock. All were cut and bruised. Heidt’s group fulfilled engagements at Joliet Sunday despite his injuries (the show must go on!)\n\nReita married comedian Doodles Weaver on October 6, 1958, in a quiet ceremony at the Laurel Canyon home of son of his brother Sylvester Weaver, an industrialist and founder of the All-Year Club. Architect Ray Donley, a former school friend of Doodles, served as best man. The couple left for a short honeymoon trip in Northern California.\n\nWinstead Sheffield Weaver was born on May 11, 1912, in Los Angeles, California, to Sylvester Laflin Weaver and Annabel Dixon. He attended Stanford University and started his work on the radio. He became a producer and renown comedian. More information onj his can be found on his wikipedia page. he was married three times before Reita – to Beverly Masterman, Evelyn Irene Paulsen and Lois Frisell, and had one son with Masterman, Wynette Laflin, born on June 20, 1941.\n\nIn 1959, Reita was hospitalized to have plastic surgery, unfortunately I have no more information about what exactly did she want to “mend”. She and Doodles settled in Los Angeles in the long run, but she gave up on her career and never appeared in a movie or a TV show after 1961.\n\nThe Weavers had two children: daughter Janella J. Weaver, born August 24, 1958, and son Winstead B. Weaver, born on June 6, 1960.\n\nThe Weaver’s marriage was marred by Doodles’ chronic alcoholism. Later, he would claim that everything they had – the house, the pool, the cars – meant nothing to him as he was in constant pain. This is truly a sad story, but at the same time, it should serve as a lesson on how NOT to live. The couple divorced in 1968.\n\nReita continued to live in Burbank, and built a very successful wallpaper business – Reita Green The Wallpaper Queen. She started in the early 1970s, after her divorce from Doodles, and still runs it today, at 80+ years old! She is very loved by her clients and has an incredible eye for aesthetics and details (see more on her yelp website, here is the link).\n\nDoodles Weaver died in 1983. Reita’s daughter Janella Jill died in 2009.\n\nReita Green lives in Burbank, California today.\n\nBeautiful women who crashed Hollywood only thanks to their looks and charms were plentiful, but rarely did they achieve anything worthwhile. Harriette Tarler, one of those women, did find her bit of fame with the Three Stooges shorts, but not much more. Let’s find out something about her!\n\nEARLY LIFE\n\nHarriette Gerthrude Hecht was born on November 4, 1920, in New York, to Adolph Hecth and Charlotte Reicher. Her parents were both Hungarian immigrants – her father worked as a furrier and wholesale fur merchant. Her older sister Beatrice was born in 1914.\n\nThe family moved to Los Angeles at some point, and Harriette graduated from high school there. She got married, had a family, and lived in Los Angeles until 1950, when she started her career (sorry, I don’t have any more info about this).\n\nCAREER\n\nSince my knowledge of the Three Stooges is very limited at best (I’ve never seen any of their movies or shorts, heck I can’t even name al three of them), I’ll simply skip Harriette’s claim to fame – her roles in Three Stooges shorts. She was the girl who got the pie in the face. For more information about her roles in the shorts, visit the fabulous Three Stoones site on this link.\n\nNow, let’s take a look at some of her other acting achievements. Unfortunately, she was always uncredited and did no big service to the movies she appeared in… Thus, her career outside the Three Stooges shorts was a bit lackluster at best.\n\nIn 1957, she appeared in The Joker Is Wild, a surprisingly touching and nuanced biography of comedy legend Joe E. Lewis. Sinatra was in top form playing a man who was a personal friend for many years. Recommended! The next year Harriette was in The True Story of Lynn Stuart, a film noir about operatives going undercover, but with a whole new premise – the operative is a housewife, who, after her nephew died from a drug OD, decided to do something and help the police. it’s a low-budget movies and the cast is second tier, but it’s unusual, out of the ordinary and interesting.Next came The Party Crashers, a typical delinquent youth 1950s movies with Connie Stevens trying to choose between wild boy Mark Damon and nice guy Bobby Driscoll.\n\nAs Young as We Are was a rare B movie that tackled the student/teacher romance in the 1950s. While today you wouldn’t even flinch at the theme, back then it was dynamite and never shows in A budget movies. While this is a half-baked, lowly made film, make no mistake, the performances are good enough to warrant it a watching. Pippa Scott is pretty good in the female lead, and Robert Harland hits a right note as the highschool in love with his teacher.\n\nThe Buccaneer is an entertaining, fun, well made adventure movie. It’s not a classic nor is it a work of art, but it more than fulfills it’s promises. Yul Brynner is the eponymous buccaneer, and Anthony Quinn in the bad guy. Pirates, high seas, sword fights, pretty ladies, oh my!\n\nDon’t Give Up the Ship is a typical Jerry Lewis comedy, this time on a ship and mocking naval beaurocracy. What can I say, if you like Jerry Lewis you’ll like this movie for sure. Since I’m not a fan (quite the opposite), I’ll just say no. The only reason I could find to watch this is the gorgeous Dina Merrill in the female lead role. Love Dina!!\n\nLast Train from Gun Hill is a western that manages to outgrow that (IMHO) limited genre to become sa semi classic. it’s not as well-known today as some other staples of the genre like High Noon or 3:15 to Yuma, but it’s a sounding hit in almost al departments. Stalwart story (it starts like a run of the mill revenge story) that hides more depth than you think – check. Good actors – Kirk Douglas, Anthony Quinn, Carolyn Jones – check. Great cinematography – check. Suspenseful action scenes – check. Horses – check. Nothing else you need!\n\nHarriette moved to New York and left movies behind for another career.\n\nPRIVATE LIFE\n\nHarriette was an interesting, colorful person with some major flaws. She was immensely charming and easily won people over. She also intrinsically understood how HOllywood worked, and knew that talent and beauty were not enough to gain fame – you needed a gimmick. Hers was being nicknamed Tiger and singing her autographs with a tiger paw next to her name. Long after her career ended, she moved to New York and decorated her apartment wholly in tiger print. She also wore tiger print silk dresses.\n\nHarriette married Leo M Schechtman on June 1939. Leo was born on April 20, 1916 in Chicago, Illinois, to Max and Lona Schechtman. Their daughter Stephanie Shelton was born on November 16, 1942. They divorced not long after her birth. Leo was allegedly a mean-spirited, tight-fisted man who never contributed anything to Stephanie’s well-being, even stole her the money Harriette gave her. He later remarried and had children. He died on March 4, 1990.\n\nHarriette married for the second time to Arthur Tarler on November 3, 1951. Tarler was born on July 9, 1921, in Germany, to Siegmund Tarler and Regina Heimberg. He immigrated to the States in 1938, just before the start of WW 2. He lived with his maternal uncle in the Bronx, New York. Somehow he got to California in the mid 1940s and started a lighting fixture business. The marriage was short-lived, and here is an article about their August 1954 divorce:\n\nActress Harriette Tarler, 27, who now is engaged in a divorce contest with Arthur Tarler, 33, in the courtroom of Superior Judge Gordon Howden. Tarler, with Tobias G. Klin-ger as his counsel, had just withdrawn his cross-complaint charging mental cruelty, and was contesting only his wife’s claim to certain of their community assets. The husband is in the lighting fixtures business …\n\n“I’m only beginning to see the light on this,” she told the court. Questioned by her attorneys, Henry J. Gross Jr. and Jacques Leslie, the actress said her husband stayed out nights until 4:30 or 5 in the morning. Her friend, Pauline Goddard, a fashion co-ordinator, corroborated her. She said that at a party one night someone complimented Mrs. Tarler, and “her husband immediately started belittling her.” The hearing will be resumed Monday.\n\nSo you get the drift, another messy divorce. But, that was the way divas did it back in the 1980s. Anyway, the two divorced and went on with their lives. Arthur remarried to Judith Rappapor, and had two children, Regine L, born on November 7, 1956, and Stacy J, born on January 30, 1959. Artur retired in the 1980 and went to live in Denver, Colorado, with his wife. He died there on August 23, 2009.\n\nIn 1958, Harriette left everything in Los Angeles (including Stephanie who was 16 years old) so she can move into the New York Plaza hotel suite, paid by her married boyfriend. Stephanie had to fend for herself (remembered, she was only a high schooler then) – the relationship between mother and daughter was strained (at best) after that. It seems that Harriette, for all of her immense charm and allure, was simply not a maternal woman. She was competitive, even with her own daughter, and too much of an egoist to really care about other people. Sadly, she never managed to outgrow this fatal flaw of hers, and both her daughter and her grandchildren felt it keenly.\n\nHarriette married her third husband, Roy Price Steckler on September 11, 1959, in Las Vegas, Nevada. Steckler was born on January 1, 1926, in New York, to Samuel and Stella Steckler. His father was a wealthy druggist and drug store owner – the family lived in Park Avenue and employed two servants in the 1930s. Little is known about the marriage and they divorced him in the 1960s.\n\nHarriette became very testy about her age as time went by. She and Stephanie would travel to Las Vegas and double date as sisters (weird!!). She forbade her granddaughter to call her grandma, and her own daughter never refered to her as mom. Nobody was sure how old she really was, and she kept her true age a secret until the day she died.\n\nHarriette found work as a telephone sex therapist in the 1980’s and 1990s. She would lie about her age, counsel her client, and demand payment via credit card. She owned a black cat called Tuthancamon, which looked like a a miniature panther, and she grew a rare breed of orchids in her apartment. She was excentric, larger than life and one of a kind, and people adored her, for all her bad sides. (much information about Harriette comes from her granddaughter Jessica Queller’s fabulous memoir! Jessica was a writer for Gossip Girl series, and she’s a true gem!)\n\nHarriette’s health declined in the 1990s, and she spend more and more time in the hospital.\n\nHarriette Tarler died on November 18, 2001, in New York City.\n\nA beautiful southern belle with a peaches-and-cream complexion, Lucy Knoch survived for over 10 years in the hostile climate of Hollywood, and none can dispute the fact that she accomplished a career much better than most starlets. Yet, she is miles away from standing toe to toe with proper actresses that left a mark on the film world.\n\nEARLY LIFE\n\nLucy Claire Knoch was born on June 30, 1923, in Davidson, Nashville, Tennessee, to Beverly and Annie Lee Knoch. She was the fourth of children – her older siblings were Beverly Louise, Horace and William, her younger siblings were Dorothy and Charles. Her father ran his own hardware shop.\n\nShe grew up in Nashville and attended school there. A lively, imaginative child, was active in school theatrics. In 1937, Lucy, then in the eighth grade students. and bunch of her classmates organized a program honoring the Constitution of the United States.\n\nLucy later told an interviewer Cordon Allemand the story of her childhood:\n\nWhen Lucy become a model at the Hollywood Photographic Studio in the Nashville Arcade, never suspecting what the word “Hollywood” would someday mean to her future. Today this fortunate young lady, Lucy Knoch, it on her way to stardom at the Paramount Studios in the real Hollywood, which ia now her home. Lucy Knoch’s success story was related to me one afternoon in the living room of her home in Hollywood’s luxurious Alta Nido Apartments. Her warm Southern smile that’ makes you feel right at home is one of the first things I noticed about Lucy, and making me feel even more at ease was her genuine delight in learning that her interviewer was “homefolks” from back in Tennessee. “Honestly?” Lucy cried. “Why I was at Central High in 1939. I went to Woodbine grammar school out the Nolensville Pike. Nearly all my family live in Nashville and are in business there.” “Well just how did you get from Nashville to a Paramount contract?” I questioned. And this is Lucy’s story. “I suppose I was like lots of girls. All of us kids, my sister, Dorothy, and two brothers, William and Horace, went to Woodbine. I dreamed of being a movie star, but thought the nearest I’d .ever get to a stage was when I went to high school and joined the debating “team. A good one too, because we got several cups and ribbons.” She went on to tell of an early love for dancing and of being sent to dancing school three times a week. As a dancing team she and sister Dorothy appeared at many Tennessee festivals. Then came an end to school days and her first job. “I worked in the studio there for quite a while. Modeling. Maybe some of the Nashville people will remember me there. … Read the rest in the Profile section.\n\nAnd she was in Hollywood in 1945, and started her career for Paramount.\n\nCAREER\n\nLucy made her movie debut in The Affairs of Susan, a charming, well made Joan Fontaine vechicle. While no big brainer, it’s a delightful comedy with a good cast (Joan, George Brent, Dennis O’Keefe, Walter Abel). Lucy then continued to appear in movies of the same vein – decently made romance movies that never made it into the top category and are not that well-remembered today. Those are You Came Along (with Bob Cumings and Lizabeth Scott, an unusual but actually pretty good pairing), Incendiary Blonde and the short You Hit the Spot.\n\nThen, Lucy’s career took an upswing and she stated to appear in some genuine classics. To Each His Own, Olivia de Havilland’s only Oscar win, The Blue Dahlia, one of the ultimate film noirs, and Blue Skies, a wonderful musical. After reaching such a high point, there was a let down again, and she was back to the A budget mid tier movies. The first was Cross My Heart a True Confessions remake with Betty Hutton in the lead. The movie, a lackluster one ta best, still boasts a wonderful supporting cast – Michael Chekov, Iris Adrian and Howard Freeman. Sonny Tufts is his typical wooden and Betty an energetic, fine performer, but no great actress.\n\nLucy then appeared in The Imperfect Lady, one of the rare Hollywood romances that goes for something slightly more mature. This is no fluffy, feel good, happy movie, and while it’s not a terribly dark movie either, it deals with some more tricky aspects fo the Victorian culture. Ray Milland and Teresa Wright lead a capable cast, and it’s generally a well dome movie, worth watching. Next came Welcome Stranger, a decent enough Bing Crosby/Joan Caulfield movie. What can I say about Crosby’s movies? Same old same old, but it certainly worked back then!\n\nLucy then appeared in the film noir classic, The Big Clock – now this is a movie more than worth your time! Slick, with a superb cast, nicely photographed and with an impeccable pacing, it takes a pretty simple story and makes it an intensive exercise in elegant filmmaking! Kudos for the always wonderful Charles Laughton as one heck of a villain, and to Ray Milland as the hero.\n\nAfter appearing the short musical, Footlight Rhythm, Lucy was in Two Tickets to Broadway, a sub par Broadway pastiche musical. She then hit the jackpot again with The Bad and the Beautiful, one of the best outlooks on Hollywood that Hollywood ever producer (whoa, this is one difficult sentence)! Kirk Douglas plays the ultimate fight-dirty producer who’ll do ANYTHING to get what he wants.\n\nLucy started 1953 with The Clown, a nostalgic, sentimental story about a professional clown who barely makes ends meet but can’t give it up since he has a son to support. Nice, touching, with the right degree of pathos, and Red Skelton is pretty good in the leading role. Next was Sabre Jet , an insipid movie about the men who flew combat aircraft known as Sabre Jets during the Korean War. This ain’t Top Gun people, and the characters and the story if thin at best. Robert Stack, never my favorite actor, never quite manages to make it work as a romantic lead.\n\nHalf a Hero is a mediocre movie about a pretty much everyday theme – normal couple Red Skelton and Jean Hagen decide to move the family from New York City to the suburbs. Trouble ensures. Lucy had the biggest role in her career in Executive Suite, a well made Her last movie in 1954 was Athena, a Jane Powell musical with a surprisingly modern outlook on food and lifestyle!\n\nLucy worked for a time for Red Skelton, and changed her name. She did some minor movie work: appeared in Anything Goes, the Marilyn Monroe movie Bus Stop and the swashbuckler The Buccaneer. Under her original name, she made one more movie, Frank Sinatra’s The Joker Is Wild , before retiring.\n\nPRIVATE LIFE\n\nHere is everything you need to know about Lucy in short, as written in a newspaper from the 1950s:\n\nLucille Knox has been a movie fan since she was five years old. Her favorite dolls were named Greta Garbo and Norma Shearer. When she daydreamed herself a husband it was always Clark Gable. When Lucy was a teen-ager she and sister Dorothy drove from their hometown of Nashville, Tennessee, to visit relatives in Tucson, Arizona. At dinner one night in a local .-hotel their eyes almost popped out when they saw Paulette Goddard at a nearby table. Naturally Lucy asked for an autograph. Miss Goddard was cordial and said, “If you girls ever come to Hollywood look me up at Paramount.” Shortly after that Lucy and Dorothy arrived in Hollywood. “Miss Goddard,” they were told at the studio, “is in San Francisco.” “We were disappointed and hungry,” said Lucille. “A restaurant a block away caught my attention because of its name: Lucey’s. The place was jumping with movie stars. We met Everett Crosby, Bing’s brother. I told him that Paulette had promised to show us the Paramount studios. ” ‘Well,’ he said, ‘since Paulette Isn’t here, I’ll show you the studio and I’ll also introduce you to the casting director.’ He did. And we both were signed to a Paramount contract.”\n\nLucille and her sister were not popular with the other girls on the lot. “We were real naive. In all the fan magazines we’d read back in Nashville all you did in Hollywood was sat at a soda fountain or in a popular restaurant and you were discovered. We thought getting a contract on the first day was par for the course. We didn’t know that some of these kids had waited years for a break.” Another day, another restaurant. Lucille was having lunch at the Tail of the Cock. Red Skelton was at the next table. “Would you be interested in television work?” he asked. For two years Lucille was an important part of the Skelton show. M-G-M director Vincente Minnelli saw her on the show and gave her the part of Gilbert Roland’s steak-eating girl friend in The Bad and the Beautiful. After that she played Louis Calhern’s sexy girl friend in Executive Suite and a process-server in Esther Williams’ Athena. Lucille Knox was born Lucy Knoch. Red Skelton changed the Lucy to Lucille. And she herself recently changed the Knoch to Knox. She’s 5 feet 5′,inches tall, weighs 119 pounds and is married to an insurance man. Skelton once wrote an article about her titled, “The Young Lucille Ball.” She has been carefully avoiding Desi’g Lucy ever since. She figures she’s been lucky enough just being herself.\n\nHowever, what Hollywood didn’t know was that Lucy came to town as a married woman – she was wed to Michael Joseph Rose on September 11, 1941, in Davison, Tennessee. the newlywed had scarcely any time to enjoy their wedded bliss – Rose went into the army in October 1945. Rose was born in 1915, son of Tony and Marie Rose. Little else is known about him. The marriage was short-lived however, and they divorced sometime prior to 1945.\n\nWhen Lucy first came to Hollywood, she gave another interview:\n\nLucy stayed on and has just signed a new contract. “It’s been wonderful here at Paramount,” she said. “When it was learned that we were two Southern girls alone in Hollywood, everybody from producers and directors on down helped and advised us. A Southern accent is no handicap when it comes to making friends. Everybody around the studio calls me ‘Honey Chile’ and ‘Tennessee’ and ‘Lucy Belle.’ And anybody from the South visiting the lot is rushed over to meet me.” “Nevertheless,” Lucy said, “I am trying to lose my Southern accent because you can’t play many roles with a Tennessee drawl.” AFTER she signed her contract Lucy’s days were occupied with a rigid training program, as they still are. As a member of the Paramount Starlet School she receives instruction in dramatics, diction, calesthenics, dancing. “I even had to learn to walk all over again.” she exclaimed. Also part of the training program has been Lucy’s appearance in IS major films. As a show girl, dancer, nurse, maid, Lucy has had experience before the camera. “It was a terrifying ordeal those first few weeks on the set. There are directors, assistant directors, cameramen, wardrobe women, scenery men, electricians, all watching you as if you were a trained seal going through your tricks. But I finally got used to it and don’t mind the shooting now.” Among the major films in which Lucy Knoch has appeared , are “Road to Utopia.” “Incendiary Blond.” “The Blue Dahlia.” “The Lost Weekend” and “Miss Susie Slagle’s.” Her newest pictures, all with Bing Crosby, are “Welcome Stranger,” “Blue Skies.” and “The Emperor’s Waltz.” Honey-haired Lucy is 23 years old. five feet six inches tall, and weighs 121 pounds. She plays golf and rides, but her favorite sport is fishing. ‘ With her husband, tall dark Nicholas Cancellieri (trucking-line owner whom she married in 1945), she spend most of her free moments deep-sea fishing off Catalina or Malibu. The starlet loves California but misses the neighborliness of her home town. “Here in California things are so big that your friends may be 20 or 30 miles away. And most of the time you scarcely have the opportunity to say more than “hello’ to the people in the neat apartment. It’s awful in a way. But you can’t have everything.” According to Paramount officials, however. Lucy Knoch does have everything, and it is easy to see why stardom for her is their prediction. And she seems to have Lady Luck on her side.\n\nBut before he go farther, let’s look at her Hollywood private life. Lucy’s first serious beau in Hollywood was the former vaudeville star, Lyle Latell. He also dated starlet Beverly Thompson, so you can guess Lucy was not really a number one priority in his life. Then, she met THE MAN.\n\nLucy married Nicholas Cancellieri in 1945. He was a trucking company owner, as noted in the quote above. Nicholas was very supportive of his wife and her career, and she continued to act for more than a decade after the married. In the late 1950s, after being in Hollywood for 15 years, Lucy gave up her movie work to raise a family with Cancellieri.\n\nTheir first son, Jerry D., was born on August 1,1960. Their second son, Dominic, was born on October 19, 1964. The family lived in California.\n\nLucy Cancellieri died on July 22, 1990, in San Bernardino, California.\n\nVirginia Maples was an Earl Carroll dancer who crashed Hollywood and actually managed to get in front of the camera. However, her true claim to fame were not her acting chops, but the man she dated – she was a serious contender to become both Mrs. Phil Silvers and Mrs. George Raft. Let’s hear her story.\n\nEARLY LIFE\n\nVirginia Lillian Maples was born to on January 13, 1921, in Los Angeles, California to Cornelius William Maples and the former Evelyn Rae Kavanaugh. Her father was an army captain who headed the Camp Tulelake. Her younger brother, Richard, was born on March 25, 1926.\n\nVirginia grew up in Manhattan Beach, and dreamed to being an actress/dancer from early childhood. She started dancing before she went to school. In 1937, at just 16 years old, Virginia won the title of Miss Los Angeles. Earl Carroll saw her, liked what he saw, and signed her to become a Carroll girl. Barely 16 years old, Virginia was on her way to greater and bigger things.\n\nThere are several version of the story how Virginia was discovered for the movies. In a newspaper article she claimed she was discovered on a beach near her mother’s house. Years later, she claimed she came to the studios gates one day, and said to the guards she wanted to act. Luckily, they needed a dancer that very day, and she got the part. While I can’t be sure, I just think that her engagement in Earl Carroll’s vanities catapulted her to the screen. Anyway, she signed with a major studio in 1941 and started her career.\n\nCAREER\n\nVirginia made her debut in 1941 with Week-End in Havana, a fun, no-brains-required Alice Faye musical with her standard stock actors – John Payne, Carmen Miranda and Cesar Romero. Truly, Alice’s 1930s and 1940s movies were pure enjoyment, perfect escapism at the end of another mundane working day. The plot is pretty silly (from imdb: In this case it’s Alice Faye, a shopgirl who saved her money for a cruise and in this case the cruise ship ran aground on a reef on the Cuban coast. She just doesn’t want to sign a waiver to get the company off the hook for a lawsuit. So John Payne who is about to become Barbier’s son-in-law is sent to get that waiver by hook or crook.), but you know it’s just an excuse to paste together several singing and dancing scenes.\n\nVirginia started 1942 with The Mad Martindales, a movie more or less lost today. It’s a pity – the movie seems like a charming, likable family romp with Jane Withers in her usual perky role. Next Virginia appeared in the highly sanitized and inaccurate biography or Ernst Ball, an Irish songwriter, called Irish Eyes Are Smiling. If you watched any musical/biographies, you know the drift – the plot only has minor similarities with the real life of the man it portrays, and there is plenty of nice music and dancing. Dick Haymes, in the leading role, was not a good actor for sure , but he sings well enough, and June Haver witth her happy go lucky act and nice snging saves the day.\n\nVirginia appeared in only one more musicals – the “war musical” Something for the Boys. Like most propaganda movies, it’s thin int he art but abundant in the fun/morale department. It’s entertaining and nice to watch, but easily forgettable (even Carmen Miranda and Vivian Blaine can’t elevate it to a upper tier status).\n\nYou know it’s the beginning of the end, or a beginning of a new career when you start appearing in low budget westerns, like Virginia did with Wildfire. After that, you either sink and leave acting, or swim and become a B western heroine. Since the movie was easily forgettable, Virginia left movies for a period of time. She worked in nightclubs and so on.\n\nShe only returned to Hollywood in 1954, to appear in tow glossy, high class productions: Woman’s World and Black Widow. Woman’s world is one oft he best movies made abut the corporate world, about three hotshot salesmen and their wives, and the rat race to get ahead int he business. Black Widow is a mixed bag of pleasures. The plot is something right out of Hitchcock (taken from imdb: Van Heflin gives a striking, forceful performance as a theatrical producer in New York City who befriends a lonely 20-year-old girl at a party; she’s a would-be writer hoping for success, he takes a shine to her and offers a helping hand…but then she turns up dead!), and the actors are good enough, but it’s all so overtly dramatic it hurts!\n\nVirginia left movies for good after this.\n\nPRIVATE LIFE\n\nWhile Virginia was one of the Earl Carroll girls, she dated Lionel Newman, the Earl Carroll orchestra leader, and there was talk the two would wed. They never did.\n\nAfter Newman, Virginia was seen several times with Laurence Tibbett Jr. In May 1942, she was seen with Victor Mature.\n\nThen, in September 1943, Virginia started dating comedian Phil Silvers. Things got serious pretty soon, but theirs was a turbulent, love/hate relationship that just went up and down for about six months. They were cooing one moment, next they were fighting, then they were separated, then they were buying jewelry… It was pretty obvious the relationship would not last. They broke up in April 1943.\n\nVirginia then took up with another famous beau, George Raft. To be sure, George was a notorious skirt chaser that dated all the girls in Hollywood (slight exaggeration, but just slight). He had just come out of a intensive relationship with Betty Grable, who ditched him when his wife refused to grant him a divorce (he used his wife a great many times to excuse himself from remarriage). Betty was furious when she found out that George started dating Virginia, and she tried to make her life a bit more complicated – only an intervention from the studio brass managed to calm down the situation.\n\nGeorge allegedly carried a huge torch for Betty. Since Virginia was a dear ringer for Betty in terms of looks, you can guess where that comes from… To my surprise, they actually dated for a long time – three months!!\n\nIn July 1943, she switched to Tex Feldman. Then dirty laundry came out. Allegedly, when Virginia replaced Betty as George’s number one lady, he forced her to imitate Betty in everything from walking to fashion style. Virginia got sick of it and left him for Feldman. What can I say about Raft? The more I read about him and his ladies, the less I like him. The guy obviously had some ego problems, as he dated ladies by the load but never remotely considered getting divorced from his wife who lived on the other side of the country. Some sources claim he was unable to divorce his wife, but hey, I think there are means of divorcing somebody if you really want to! Good for Virginia to get out of such a distressing relationship.\n\nBut then (WAIT FOR IT!) they got together, again!! Ugh. And they stayed together for two more years. George went overseas during the war to tour war camps, and left his car to Virginia. It must have been love 😛 Anyway, he returned and they continued their idyll, until about mid 1945.\n\nAfter that, Virginia, started to date Bill Burton, Dick Haymes’ manager. Then she was seen with hotshot lawyer, Bentley Ryan. Then she dated Arturo de Cordova in December 1945. By then, Virginia Maples worked as an exotic dancer at the Club Riviera, and was out of the movies.\n\nVirginia’s last known Hollywood beau was Walter Kane, Howard Hughes’ right hand man. They dated in early 1946 for several months, but she denied reports she was to marry him.\n\nThen, Virginia met and fell in love with a handsome Brazilian, Envidio Sanctos (they met at one of Carmen Miranda’s parties). They eloped in 1947 and got married in Brazil. She effectively left behind her career to live in the Amazon jungle with her new husband. They spent their time between Brazil and the US. Their daughter, Diana, was born on April 17, 1950, in Kansas City, Missouri. The couple separated and divorced in 1962.\n\nIn 1975, Virginia moved to Isles of Capri and opened a gift shop, Diana’s Gifts, in East Naples. She continued working until she was 70 years old, and retired in Naples after that. She was a much loved member of the community.\n\nVirginia Maples Sanctos died on January 13, 2010, in Naples, Florida.\n\nToni Seven is proof that a girl who lands in Hollywood, has money to burn, a great press agent and more than enough beauty, can still end up a complete unknown. Toni tried to attain stardom several times, and the second time, an extensive campaign to catapult her to stardom was coined by PR guru Russell Birdwell, but she just crashed and burned pretty soon. What a waste! Toni truly was a beautiful woman and probably had some talent in her. Too bad too much publicity killer her.\n\nEARLY LIFE\n\nJune Elizabeth Millarde was born on July 6, 1922, in New York City, to Henry F. Millarde and Helen Elizabeth Lawson. Her mother was professionally known as June Caprice, an actress of major prominence in Hollywood, and her father was an successful movie director. His most famous movie was If Winter comes, from 1916. By the time she was born, her parents had amassed quite a fortune and retired from active movie work. June grew up in Long Island, and attended school at Great Neck, Long Island.\n\nOn November 2, 1931, June’s father died from a heart attack, aged only 45. June was raised by her mother form them on, but sadly the elder June succumbed to a heart attack while fighting cancer in 1936. The 14 year old June was left in the care of her maternal grandparents in Long Island.\n\nWhile June was materially well of, as a heiress of a considerable fortune (rumored to have been 3 million dollars), she wanted to act not for the fortune but for the fame. She moved to the West Coast after graduating from high school, and undertook extensive dramatic training before deciding to crash movies.\n\nJune signed with MGM in 1941, owning of course to her late parents friendship with producer Bob Leonard. Unfortunately, she left Metro after just a month, unhappy how they only posed her to leg art. She signed with Warner Bros and started her career anew.\n\nCAREER\n\nPretty slim! Toni appeared in only five movies, although I have to say they are 5 decent movies at least! Her first movie was We Were Dancing, based on a Noel Coward play. When i say based on a Noel Coward play, it means it’s a witty, sparkling, lightweight fare. And this movie is just that. don’t look for deeper, hidden meanings and something profound. Norma Shearer is delightful int he leading role. Coward + Norma = a good combo. Some people would disagree with me, but heck, Norma was perfect for sophisticated, drawing room comedies. Here she is ably supported by Mervyn Douglas, Gail Patrick and Lee Bowman.\n\nShe then followed it with Yankee Doodle Dandy, one of the best musicals to come out of her 1940s. Jimmy Cagney, what more do you need? Toni’s last movie under her Warner Bros contract was Wings for the Eagle, a love triangle set amidst Southern California aircraft production in WWII. The lovers? Ann Sheridan, Denis Morgan and Jack Carson. What ca I say, I’m a sucker for Ann, she was such a luminous actress, but I am not a fan of either Crason or Morgan, so for me, it’s a skip.\n\nAware that her career went nowhere fast, Toni hired Russel Birdwell and tried anew (again!). The result were only two movies – Ladies Courageous and Once Upon a Time. While not the bottom of the waist basket quality, they are far from good solid movies that Toni needed to build a career. Ladies courageous is a weird, weird, anti feminist movie (despite the more than a decent cast – ). Once upon a time is one of the lesser Cary Grant movies – it’s a movie with a strange kind of charm, unusual story (A cash-strapped theater producer promotes a nine-year-old boy’s dancing caterpillar) and features the stunning Janet Blair as Cary’s leading lady, but it’s not top tier movie making and it did little favors to anyone involved.\n\nToni gave up her career and publicity campaign and settled in Washington DC after this.\n\nPRIVATE LIFE\n\nThis is where Toni shines. If she is at all remembered today, it is because of her private life, not her slim movie career.\n\nToni was 5 feet, four and a half inched tall, weighted about 108 lbs, was a great horsewoman who rode frequently, and was also a good swimmer and tennis player. She disliked gossipy women, bad movies and prize fights.\n\nIn march 1943, she was just one of the many girls that dated Errol Flynn. She also banked heavily on her parents’ fame. A quote from a newspaper:\n\n“Director Al Hall is giving June Millarde a break in “My Client Curly,” the Cary Grant-Janet Blair . The person who gave Al his first acting role role was Harry Millarde, June’s ‘ father, who was king bee on the old ‘Fox lot and frequently directing June Caprice (June’s mother). As time went by Al gave up his acting ambitions and became a director, but he never forgot the Millardes. So when their ‘ daughter June was up for a role in ; “Curly,” Al directed the test and saw she got the best cameraman at Columbia.”\n\nIn 1944, Toni hired Russell Birdwell to become her press agent. Birdwell was a wildly oscillating guy. While he had major success with Jane Russell (and her bust and bra) and the search for Scarlett O’Hara (he was the brain behind this superb publicity stunt) most of his other “finds” ended up complete unknowns after a period of intense publicity frenzy. And he really tried with Toni, he really did. It just didn’t pay. For instance, Toni posed with a mama cat that gave birth to a litter of kitten with 7 toes on their paws. She also posed with a man’s black shirt, claiming she uses them as nightgowns. On the right ear she wears nothing; on the left, a large gold loop, and in the center of it, a cut out 7! She made bread with exactly 7 ingredients. She wore earrings with 7 precious stones dangling from them. Her phone number ended in 7. You get the picture…\n\nShe was supposed to star in a revue by Fort Ord, but nothing came out of it. She was very active in the war effort, going to rallies, signing pictures. Birdwell sent thousands of her pictures to the GI-as around the world – she was named the most popular pin up for the boys in the European Theater in 1945. Her photos could be found on obscure Pacific islands where there was literary nothing else!\n\nToni Seven has bought herself a little house in Benedict canyon. By her own admission, she knows nothing about antiques, yet is furnishing it exclusively in early American stuff.\n\nIn March 1945, Toni and five other starlets staged a strip poker session at the United National Clothing Drive. The other starlets were Ann Miller, Evelyn Ankers, Nina Foch and Renee de Marco. They all had better careers than Toni (even De Marco, who did not have a great movie career). She was also good friend with starlet Frances Vorne, who also posed for Yank. They often threw big dinner parties for their swains.\n\nIn early 1946, Toni went back to her old moniker, but still remained an active pin up girl – her legs were claimed to have been “perfect” by a lieu of eminent photographers.\n\nBy 1948, June was out of Hollywood, out of movies, and living of her inheritance. She entered a hospital in October 1948 for a serious operation, and was recuperating in November 1948 in Hollywood.\n\nThen, she was again back in the newspaper fold. How? Love! In January 1949, a certain senator Warren Magnuson, the famous lothario of Washington and a very sought after bachelor, missed the opening of Congress. Why? Because he was allegedly with Toni! There was much press furor re over the fact. His friend kindly noted to the press that Warren had been doing the Seattle nightspots with Toni for some time now. However, in September 1949 she sailed for Europe, and was beaued by Peruvian playboy, Alfredo Carreo.\n\nMore about Warren, who ended one of the most meaningful men in Toni’s life. He was born on April 12, 1905, in Minnesota, and was adopted by the Magnuson family (due to his surname, he was known as Maggie to friends). He attended college in Seattle, Washington, and settled there permanently. A member of the Democratic Party, he served as a U.S. Representative (1937–1944) and a U.S. Senator from 1944. In 1928, he was married to Eleanor Peggy “Peggins” Maddieux, but they divorced in 1935. Warren dated all around the States from then on, escorting women like actress Carole Parker and Austine McDonnell.\n\nToni and the senator dated on off from 1948 until 1953, although some papers pin them together in 1955. It is known that the senator married in 1964 to a Seattle widow, Jermaine Peralta, and thus he obviously never married Toni. Toni gave up her career (which is not saying much) to cater to Warren. She acted as his hostess at social functions, they traveled around a great deal, often visiting Hawaii. Warren’s close friends said that Toni was absolutely loyal to Warren, but liked to drink to much. Warren also had a weakness for vodka – it seems they were well matched here (sadly!).\n\nI sympathize with Toni on this one. She obviously wanted to get married and talked constantly to the press about her upcoming nuptials, but the senator rebuffed her every time, until they were done. I have no idea why they broke up – but I can only guess. Maybe Toni had had enough? Maybe Warren passed onto another woman? He later romanced Monique van Vooren, another luscious starlet. He died on May 20, 1989 in Seattle, Washington. His wife died in 2011.\n\nIn 1952, Toni was seen with Hank Fisher, of the “Joe Palooka” fame.\n\nIn 1959, it was reported that June was to marry Eric Stanley, prominent in the art circles, that June. I could not find any information that proved this as a fact. She then completely falls of the radar.\n\nJune Elizabeth Millarde died in 1991.\n\nMoving on to the next installment of these short biographies… We have one more installment like this to go before going back to normal full length bios…\n\nEileen Coghlan\n\nEileen Coghlan was born on to Charles F. Coghlan and his first wife, Margaret Johnson, in the early 1920s. Her older sister, Rosamond, was born in 1919. Her mother, born in Wisconsin on February 9, 1898, was the daughter of noted silent actor, Arthur V. Johnson (who died of tuberculosis in 1916, just a year before she married). Her father, Charles, born in 1897 in Massachusetts, sure had an interesting life story!\n\nTaken from his obituary:\n\nCoghlan had an illustrious theatrical background. His mother was the famous actress Rose Coghlan, a leading lady from 1885 to 1915. He was born in Boston where his mother was playing at the time. His father, playwright Charles Jordon, died six months after he was born. Both parents came to America from England. He attended Staunton Military Academy and Fordham University. He got his start in the theatrical world when he was only ten.\n\nIn 1918, he appeared with his mother and Ethel Barrymore in “The Lady of the Camelias.” He associated with the great names of show business, often appearing with them in various productions. He numbered among his friends the Barrymores, Eugene O’Neill and Jasper Deeter. Coghlan not only appeared in many stock shows but turned to the motion picture field in his early days. He played with such stars of the day as William S. Hart and Pearl White.\n\nThe Coghlans moved a lot, owning to where his father found work. They lived for a time in Hollywood, where her sister married her first husband.\n\nThe Coghlans moved to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, where Charles became director of the Harrisburg Community Theatre, in 1942. In 1945, he joined Gene and Henry Otto to reopen the Gretna Playhouse in 1945. The theater at Mt. Gretna had been started by A.E. Scott, who ran it for years before World War II forced it to close down.\n\nIt was here that both Rosamond and Eileen did much of their thespian work. In 1943, Eileen, already a seasoned theater actress, made her Hollywood debut in Thousands Cheer, a lively, happy go lucky and well made musical. Eileen was signed with Columbia, and appeared in two of their movies: Swing Out the Blues, a minor and completely forgotten musical, and the superb None Shall Escape, a chilling and ominous piece of work, brutally honest in depiction of Nazi atrocities during WW2. Special highlight of the movie is Alexander Knox, a wonderful actor, who plays a normal man gone completely wicked and twisted under the Nazi regime. Marsha Hunt, always a welcome presence in any movie, rounds it up nicely. Eileen appeared in only one more movie, Dark Waters, a mediocre Merle Oberon thriller, before she took a breather.\n\nDuring WW2, Eileen was a very popular pin up, and even traveled to Mexico so that the Life photographer could take her photos. She continued to act after the war.\n\nShe returned to the theater for a time, and only came back to Hollywood in 1948. She made two movies for Enterprise Productions. The first is No Minor Vices, a lukewarm remake of Unfaithfully Yours. I really like Dana Andrews, but boy, it’s true, he wasn’t a comedy actor in the slightest. Louis Jourdan, such a good actor, plays plays the same charming rouge role as he did in most of his movies. Sad, sad. The second is Force of Evil, a excellent movie with a tour de force performance by John Garfield.\n\nEileen took another breather and then came back in 1950 with Bright Leaf. Now, this movie has everything for it – solid script, great cast, good production values, but it ends up a tasteless mush. Okay, it’s not that bad, but it’s not nearly as good as it could have been. I Can Get It for You Wholesale is a very well made, plotted and acted movie with Susan Hayward in the lead. She then had an uncredited appearance Lightning Strikes Twice, an atmospheric if formulaic movie with Ruth Roman and Richard Todd. Eileen’s last three movies were cute and funny 1950s fluff – they can brighten your day, but are far removed from art and profound movie making – Two Tickets to Broadway, The French Line and My Sister Eileen.\n\nIn 1954, Eileen went to Italy and met Fabio Fiorentino a handsome hotel owner. Fiorentino was born on November 28, 1929 in Italy. They married there the same year, and returned to the States, opting to live in California. Eileen retired from movies to devote herself to family life.\n\nHer daughter Lydia was born on September 22, 1956, and her daughter Vivian was born on August 30, 1960.\n\nEileen and her husband live in Newport Beach, California.\n\nSelene Mahri\n\nLet’s get one thing straight – Selene was not an actress, and she does not have one credited performance anywhere, not the cinema and not the theater. But finally we have another socially butterfly at our disposal. Her lack of movie roles is more than made up by her rather impressive marital record.\n\nSolveig Ann Mari Eklund was born on December 17, 1924, in Finland, to Karl and Thyra Eklund. Little is known about her childhood, but she and her mother came to the US in 1942 (due to the war perhaps? The papers claimed they just came to see a fair, but somehow I don’t buy it). Solveig was easily noticed by scouts and she started modeling, rising to the top pretty quickly. Allegedly, she could speak five languages (as far as I know, Finish, Swedish, German, what are the other two?) but very little English. Within a short time she was earning as much as $25 for an hour. She was well known for her silky blonde hair. She was on the WAC recruitment poster and was could be found on as many as 8 covers yearly.\n\nNow, it’s Selene’s private life that is of interest. In September 1943, she dated Victor Mature, stationed in the Coast guard. She then dated Emilio Tagli, wealthy Chilean, for some time in early 1944. By June 1944, there were rumors the two would wed. She was also courted by Stavros Niarchos, wealthy Greek shipping magnate.\n\nIn 1947, Selene revealed a bit about herself – she worked only with photographer she liked, was easy to make enemies because she chose to do things her own way. She never went below 40$ an hour for a session and never worked before noon. She lived in Long Island and raised pet poodles in her house.\n\nIn August 1947, Selene married millionaire Albert George Rupp in Garden City. They divorced in 1949 and she married John Wendell Anderson II in Grosse Point, Michigan that same year. John was born on September 16, 1923 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In his later years, Anderson was described as a former industrialist, world traveler, avid sports fisherman and golf enthusiast. He came from a prominent Michigan family. They had two sons: John and Christopher. They divorced in 1957. In 1958, Jack married starlet Lisa Ferraday.\n\nOn January 2, 1958, she married her third millionaire, William Weaver. That year, it was revealed that Selene was a passionate deep sea fisher, dabbled in painting for a time, was a good piano player (Chopin being her favorite), that she played bridge frequently, that she was an arm chair golfer and a frustrated interior designer. Her favorite piece of jewelry was her husbands Phi Beta Kappa Key that she wore on a bracelet. The couple moved to New York not long after they wed.\n\nSelene and William divorced in 1972. She kept his surname and didn’t remarry.\n\nSelene E. Weaver lived in New York City in 2009. I hope she is alive and kicking today.\n\nPeggy Corday\n\nSuch a shame that Peggy Corday, truly an unique looking lady, got so little coverage in the press during her heyday. Thus, the info on her is slim indeed. Her pin up is another favorite – she is a wonderful combination of youthful vivacity with elegance. Just look at her hand, the way she modestly holds her negligee… Whauza! Peggy was probably born in the early 1920s (but I have no idea where or who her parents were. Searching for Margaret Corday gave me no conclusive evidence).\n\nIn 1943, she got her first newspaper mention: “Red-haired Peggy Corday, who will portray Venus in the forthcoming musical, “Helen of Troy”, is being groomed for her role by Mikhail Mordkin.” She did play Venus in the mentioned play – her Yank cover photo show her during one such a performance. Very good choice for Venus, I must say. Unfortunately, this did not catapult her to any stardom.\n\nPeggy was the assistant to Robert Ripley, from Ripley’s Believe it or not, in 1949, when Ripley died after a show. Nothing else is known about her.\n\nErnie Clarke\n\nAnother interesting woman, Ernie Clarke was the scion of a acrobatic family who did trapeze acts from the time she was 9 years old. Imagine that! Anyway, everything you need to know about Ernestine in her obituary in the Telegraph web site. I’ll copy paste most of it here:\n\nShe was born in New York on October 16 1921 and christened Elizabeth Laura Clarke, although she was always known as Ernestine after a friend of her father’s made play of a family resemblance and dubbed her “Little Ernie”. By the time she was three months old she was travelling to engagements with her parents, and she made her debut in the ring when she was big enough to be put on a horse.\n\nHer parents passed on their circus skills to her and at the age of nine she joined the family act, graduating to the trapeze when she was 11. “The first time I missed the flying bar in practice,” Ernestine later recalled, “my mother was watching. As I fell into the net she fainted and they had to carry her out.”\n\nIn the late 1930s, the Clarkes appeared with Poodles Hanneford’s comedy riding act and then in the musical Jumbo at the Hippodrome in New York. They also worked with Tom Mix, the star of many Western films. By 1941, Ernestine Clarke was beginning to make her own reputation, and the writer Earl Chapin May raved about her “unusual beauty of features and figure, high intelligence, charm and character.\n\n“She can be built up,” he went on, “to be a star in the circus, on the stage and the movies. As either a rider or flyer she has grace, personality and a definite histrionic ability. Moreover, she has the carriage of a ballet dancer.”\n\nAlthough the entry of America into the Second World War led to the break-up of the family act when her uncles were called up for war work, by 1942 Ernestine Clarke’s own career appeared to be going from strength to strength. That year, she was signed to the Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus, where she was to present her own equestrian act and to ride with the highly regarded Italian troupe The Cristianis at a salary of $350 per week.\n\nBut when she arrived in Florida to rehearse with the circus, she discovered that its manager John Ringling North had been ousted from his post by other members of the family, and her contract had been effectively cancelled.\n\nShe stayed on with Ringlings, however, as a replacement for Antoinette Concello, the star of the show’s trapeze act, who had injured her shoulder. When the Concellos then left the circus, Ernestine Clarke was invited to form her own trapeze troupe, which she did with catcher Eddie Ward and flyer Clayton Behee.\n\nIn 1944, she presented a solo riding spot and her own flying act for Ringlings, and appeared on the cover of the show’s programme that year. She was with the circus in July 1944 when at Hartford, Connecticut, the big top burst into flames and 168 people were killed and almost 500 more injured.\n\nAs for her private life, she married actor Parley Baer on April 9, 1946. Born Parley Edward Baer on August 5, 1914, he was also from a circus background, studied at the University of Utah, worked in a radio station, served in WW2 and started his Hollywood/TV career in the late 1940s.\n\nThe couple had two children: daughters Kathleen Baer, born on June 29, 1952, and Elizabeth Baer, born on February 18, 1957. Both worked as trapeze artists in their professional life. Ernie and Parley lived for years in Encino, where they were active in their local St. Nicholas Episcopal Church.\n\nElizabeth Laura “Ernie” Clarke Baer died on August 5, 2000. Parley died on November 22, 2002.\n\nDorothy Van Nuys was a magnificent Amazon-line beauty, standing six feet tall, with a voluptuous figure and a pleasing face. Yet, as we have learned countless times before, this means so little in Hollywood, place where beautiful women pour in large doses. And Dorothy became one of the many nameless faces in musicals that never propelled their career on to the next stage.\n\nEARLY LIFE\n\nDorothy Jane Van Nuys was born on November 24, 1922, in Payette, Idaho, to Edward G. Van Nuys and Roma Van Nuys. She was their only child. Her mother and father worked in a tandem as salespeople. The family moved to Honolulu, Hawaii, when she was 4 years old, in 1926. She grew up on the island.\n\nDorothy was tutored by private tutors in Honolulu and attended high school there. She was active in the sports department – she danced, swam, played tennis and took up diving. However, her major passion was deep-sea fishing – she was as good as any guy and undertook multi day excursions around Hawaii to catch big fish. Unfortunately, the adventure came to an end when she got stuck on a coral reef for two days with little to no food and water. She gave up fishing after that, and took up dancing more seriously. This propelled her to try to become a professional dancer.\n\nDorothy graduated from high school and returned to the mainland in 1940. She worked as a model and Ziegfeld girl, and got her Hollywood shot in 1944.\n\nCAREER\n\nDorothy appeared in only two movies in her whole Hollywood career. The first one was Ziegfeld Follies. I have written about this movie before, as a large number of starlets appeared in it. But what is there to say? I myself don’t like this kind of musical. Yes, this is MGM at its absolute best, when the had the best sound stages, best songwriters, best music writers, best dancers and singer. The movie was easily attest to that – just look at the line-up: Fred Astaire, Gene Kelly, Lucille Bremer, Esther Williams, Lucille Ball, Fanny Brice, Lena Horne, Red Skelton, William Powell and so on… The dancing is magical. The sets are superb, and the music is pretty good. Yet, this is a movie with no substance behind the (wonderful) illusion. Mind you, it never tries to be much more than that, but as I said, I prefer my movies with a little more plot and depth. I understand that musicals are not quite the genre for deep philosophical discussion, but countless other musicals had better stories and conveyed stronger (no matter how simple) messages. But well, if you like it this way, enjoy!\n\nDorothy’s second and last movie role was in The Harvey Girls, another musical. IMHO, this one is a total step up from Ziegfeld Follies. It was made in the same studio – MGM, warranting great production values and wonderful stars, yet it has a coherent story and a message! Yaay! As one IMDB reviewer wrote: the film tells the story, in words and music, of a group of waitresses brought west in the late 1800’s to open another link in the Fred Harvey chain of restaurants. In the process, they encounter all kinds of romantic and dramatic conflicts. Judy Garland plays the lead, and John Hodiak, a decent actor but not material for a musical lead (IMHO), plays her love interest. It’s got everything you could want from this type of movie – humor, a bit of a soapy melodrama, god music, great vocalists and a passable story. And all in lush Technicolor! Dorothy is one of the background dancers (the Harvey girls of the title!).\n\nPRIVATE LIFE\n\nIn 1941, Dorothy graces the newspaper cover all around the States as the official Camel girl. This was a huge boost for her career, as she truly was one of the most visible models of the year thanks to this. Then she falls of the newspaper radar for three years.\n\nIn 1944, Dorothy was living with her mother in Los Angeles. One day she phoned home and a fireman answered – the house burned down! Her whole wardrobe, except the thing she had on when she went out that day, was lost. Luckily, her mother escaped the fire in time.\n\nFrom the early 1940s, Dorothy was steady dating her business manager, Barry Mirkin. Mirkin was born in 1918, and was a fixture in the Los Angeles entertainment world for decades. They broke up in early 1944. Mirkin later married Joan Burnham. He died in 2007 in Los Angeles.\n\nIn May 1944, she was “The oddest twosome in town” with George Stone, five-feet-five. And yes, Dorothy was six foot tall! Imagine how cute they looked!\n\nIn late 1944, Dorothy dated Paramount director Marty Lewis.\n\nBy 1945, Dorothy was back to being a full-time model, and by 1950, she was living and working in San Francisco, part of an acting company. After that stint, she moved to San Raphael and with a few fellow models, gave lectures on how to look like a model. They were very popular, and had plenty of clients. She even had her own charm school at some point in the 1960s, and was a member of the local Models Association. But what about her love life?\n\nDorothy married Zachary Armand Charles in Las Vegas, Nevada, on November 3, 1957. Her movie career far over by that time, the marriage produced no ripples in the journalistic sea.\n\nZachary Armand Charles was born on November 7, 1918, in New York City,where he grew up. He was good friends with Marlon Brando and Carlo Fiore in the late 1940s, when all three were young and struggling actors. He made his movie debut in 1950, and worked in TV from 1954. On September 11, 1949, he married Donna Beamount in California. They divorced in the early 1950s.\n\nTheir daughter Cynthia was born on July 28, 1958, in Marin, California. Their son Jason C. was born on June 14, 1962, in Marin.\n\nDorothy and Zachary divorced in February 1969 in Marin. He returned to New York and soem time later continued his TV career. In a strange stroke of fate, his last role was in one of my absolute all time favorite video games – The beast within – a Gabriel Knight Mystery. Anyone who played the game – he’s the cuckoo clock vendor!!! Dorothy stayed in Marin and lived quietly there for the rest of her life.\n\nDorothy Van Nuys died on October 8, 1985, in Marin, California. Zachary Charles died on November 15, 2007, in Burbank, California.\n\nOn with the Yank girls… In a city of beautiful women that was Hollywood in the 1930s, Delma Byron was a stand-out and that is certainty saying something. With smooth, porcelain skin, pale blonde hair and a regal bearing, she was truly a perfect example of a stunning lady-like beauty. Too bad she ended up a minor actress (but not a complete unknown).\n\nEARLY LIFE\n\nSara Delma Bynum was born on July 31, 1912, in Weakley County, Tennessee, to Samuel H. Bynum and Minnie Pearl Harris. Her older sister, Dulcie, was born on July 19, 1910.\n\nUnfortunately, Minnie died in 1914, when Sara was only 2 years old. Samuel remarried to Reoma A. Gargus, a Kentucky native who ultimately raised both Dulcie and Sara. Her half brother James was born in 1919.\n\nThe family moved around a bit, settling for a time in Kentucky. They were living in Akron, Ohio, in 1930. The family moved back to Kentucky at some point after 1930. Sara was a lively child who studied dancing from the age of ten.\n\nAfter high school, Delma ran away from home to join a revue as a dancer. She toured the southern states in a troupe then later took a job modeling clothes. The became an actress and toured with a stock company. In 1935, after years of stage experience, she was discovered by 20th Century Fox and given a chance in films.\n\nCAREER\n\nDelma, despite her exquisite beauty, had a very thin movie resume, and only a slightly more expansive TV resume. Her best known movie came very late in her career, something I have rarely seen in any actress’ filmography.\n\nDelma made her debut in Professional Soldier, a movie that’s very successful at what is tried to be – a lightweight, fun and colorful action movies, aimed for men and boys. The plot is simple enough: major star of the day, iron jawed Victor McLaglen plays a professional soldier who is hired to kidnap a king, played by kiddie star Freddie Bartholomew, but he gets much more than he bargained for. it’s not a world-class masterpiece, but it works wonderfully. Victor is superb as always.\n\nDelma had a bigger role in Everybody’s Old Man, based on a strikingly contemporary (even today) story – taken from imdb – The leading actor, Irvin Cobb, plays a grumpy, but very successful businessman who holds a grudge against his main competitor, who is also a former friend. When the friend dies suddenly, Cobb investigates the competing company and finds that his friend’s son and daughter have been wasting all their money and are in danger of losing the company to some conniving executives. He does his best to straighten out the profligate kids and nurtures a romance between his son and the competitor’s daughter. Cobb is not quite up to the task, and the movie suffers accordingly.\n\nChampagne Charlie is a typical, run of the mill 1930s B movie. Short summary, taken from IMDB: B-film from Fox has a gambler known as Champagne Charlie (Paul Cavanagh) getting behind on debts so he decides to marry a society girl (Helen Wood) so that he can get her money but the poor sap ends up falling in love. There is nothing to recommend the movie, but it’s not a bad piece of work, and features some pretty good character actors.\n\nDimples became THE movie of Delma’s early filmography, and the first one that gathered her some major newspaper coverage. Why? Because it was a Shirley Temple vehicle, that’s why! In a time when Shirley was de facto number one star of Hollywood, when she saved studios from bankruptcy and was as influential as any politician, it was A BIG thing to act in a Shirley Temple movie. And Delma had that honor. Something about the plot: Dimples Appleby lives with the pick-pocket grandfather in 19th century New York City. She entertains the crowds while he works his racket. A rich lady makes it possible for the girl to go legit. “Uncle Tom’s Cabin” is performed. It’s easy to get the drift of this movie. The plot is secondary, the music and dancing are good enough, Shirley is so cute and vivacious she just steals your heart away, she is supported by tons of good older character actors and beautiful younger actors. Delma squarely fits in the later category.\n\nLet’s try and appraise this role realistically: it was without a doubt a major boost for Delma’s publicity. And when you are a young and pretty starlet hungry for fame, this is a good thing. However, in hindsight, it’s clear that acting as a second fiddle in a movie that’s centered on a 10-year-old child is not the way to go if you want a solid acting career. It’s impossible to deny that some actors propel this into lucrative careers, but they are few and far between, and Delma wasn’t one of them. Despite all the hullabaloo surrounding the movie, she quickly faded into obscurity.\n\nDelma made only one more movie in the 1930s, Laughing at Trouble. Plot: Jane Darwell is Glory Bradford, a newspaper editor whose niece is in love with John Campbell (Allan “Rocky” Lane), unjustly accused of murdering his wealthy uncle with a knife. After the jury returns a guilty verdict, Campbell escapes from prison and hides out at Glory’s home, with the alert Sheriff (James Burke) following close behind. Leading the chase with his German Shepherd in tow, is hot-headed Deputy Sheriff Alec Brady (John Carradine), determined to replace his boss as the town sheriff, who doesn’t hesitate to shoot the elusive Campbell against the Sheriff’s orders. The local doctor (Frank Reicher) gives Campbell the okay to remain at Glory’s due to his near-fatal injury, while Brady resigns and begins to work up the townspeople into an outraged mob over their harboring of an escaped criminal. During the evening, a remark from unmarried gossip Lizzie Beadle (Margaret Hamilton), about $10,000 in Treasury bonds belonging to Campbell’s late uncle, helps lead Glory to the true identity of the real murderer. The movie looks good enough, and tackles some interesting questions, but it’s almost lost today and obviously not remembered as well as it should have been. Delma plays the blonde ingenue, and it’s clear that if she remained in Hollywood for a longer stretch of time, she would have continued to mold this thankless stereotype. She was so beautiful and fragile that I find it hard to believe she could have broken the bound to become a proper dramatic actress. Hollywood is just like this sometimes. Aware of her status, Delma quite movies and devoted herself to other pursuits.\n\nShe returned 13 years later, in the late 1940s, with Southward Ho Ho!, a short comedy skit with Tom Ewell. She worked more or less steadily for the next decade, doing TV work (Hands of Mystery, Robert Montgomery Presents, Masterpiece Playhouse, Martin Kane, Kraft Theatre, The Brighter Day, M Squad, Richard Diamond, Private Detective, The Untouchables), and appearing in two movies. The first was a TV movie, Lady in the Dark, a musical with music by Kurt Weill and lyrics by Ira Gershwin. Ann Sothern plays Liza Elliott, is the unhappy female editor of a fashion magazine, Allure, who is undergoing psychoanalysis. It’s a Freudian movie musical,\n\nIn 1958 Delma appeared in Auntie Mame, her most famous movie and best remembered role. What more need sot be said about this infinitely charming movie? Roz Russell is a gem, the writing is superb and the movie in general is truly emotional and touching. Classic Hollywood filmmaking at its best. Delma plays Sally Cato.\n\nDelma stayed active in the theater for some time after, but never made another movie.\n\nPRIVATE LIFE\n\nDelma was a constant duet with your Australian actor, Alan Marshal, in 1936. For a while it was tough thy might get to the altar, but the relationship fizzled before the year was out. In January 1937, she was the leading contender for the marriage altar with Howard Lang, who took her out for five nights in a row (swoon!).\n\nIn 1937, Delma became engaged to Frank Hervey Cook, a member of a well-known Helena, Montana oil family. Cook was born on November 28, 1899, in Colorado Springs, Colorado. His father died when he was a boy and his mother remarried to A.B. Cook, was a world renown grower of blooded livestock. He attended St. Paul’s School in Concord, New Hampshire, graduating in 1919. He assisted his adopted father on the ranch, and after his death operated the ranch on a smaller scale. In 1931 he married Lena (Sally) Gosnell Finley, heiress of the Gosnell oil fortune. She died of a heart ailment August 5, 1933. He was a widower when he met Delma.\n\nThis relationship lasted for several years, and Delma was a frequent guest at the home of Frank’s sister Gloria Walker (for propriety’s sake, of course). However, by 1942, after years of dating, they seemed to have gone kaput! In 1953, Cook moved the Dunleavy house to the Bedford Ranch north of Townsend, Montana. He rarely left the ranch and never remarried. Frank Hervey Cook was murdered there, in an apparent robbery attempt, on November 22, 1970. Three men were arrested under the suspicion for his murder.\n\nIn 1943, Delma was dating Ken Spalding of the Tobacco Road ensemble show. Sometime after 1945, Delma moved to Europe and became an accomplished sculptress when she lived in Venice, Italy. She returned to the States in the late 1940s. She settled in New York and was active in the theater circles. Delma married the international bob vivant, Yura Arkus-Duntov, in 1945. Google his name, there is so much to be written about the man! They divorced sometime after 1950.\n\nIn the 1970s, she retired from showbiz and moved to Kentucky, where both her sister and brother lived. There she was a much-loved member of the community and enjoyed her golden years surrounded by family and friends.\n\nDelma Byron died on May 29, 2006, in Leland, Kentucky."
