Tiara is a commuter student from Beverly, NJ (Burlington County).\n\nWhy did you choose your major? I choose my major of psychology because this major has always been interesting to me. I knew with this major I could make an impact, considering my future goals in higher education.\n\nWhy did you choose Rowan? I chose Rowan University because it was truly my number one school. Many of my friends are alumni of Rowan University, and I felt at home. Rowan was a great choice for my bachelor’s degree. It has been an experience with no regrets.\n\nTake us through a typical Rowan day for you. When I first transferred to Rowan University, I was an on-campus student. I would go to class from Monday to Thursday. After class, my friends and I would get lunch and finish up any projects or homework before I would head to work. I enjoyed my professors. I would have loved to join clubs but my hectic school and work schedule would not allow me. Hopefully this semester I will be able to join some clubs. My class schedule is a little lighter, and I will do my best to be in a lot more activities. Also, there are many awesome restaurants on campus that I can’t wait to try.\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nStory by:\n\nRachel Rumsby, rising sophomore communication studies and public relations double major\n\nJunior Major Moments: Bio Major Michael Camacho on His Favorite Class and Rowan Clubs\n\nToday we feature Michael Camacho, a Biological Sciences major with a minor in Psychology. He is a first-generation college student who commutes from his home in Pine Hill, NJ (Camden County).\n\nWhat is your favorite moment with a faculty member or favorite experience in one of your classes?\n\nMy favorite part was going to my Microbiology class and learning from Dr. Elizabeth Brooks. She taught her lectures in such a manner that not only excited me to learn, but also intrigued me. She has over 30 years of experience in her field and still has this spark of passion in her that is truly remarkable and inspiring to me. One day I hope to walk in her footsteps and become the passionate, caring, professional, and inspiring person that she is.\n\nWhat is the most amazing or interesting thing you’ve learned in your major this year?\n\nI’d say the most amazing and interesting thing I’ve learned in my major is that the human body truly is amazing in that the physiology protects us every day.\n\nWhat pre-professional experiences are helping to support your growth?\n\nSome of my pre-professional experiences include the Minority Association of Premedical Students (MAPS) and Rowan’s Biology Club. Though, the one organization that has truly supported my growth is Alpha Phi Omega (APO).\n\nWe are an organization that strives by our principles of being a leader, being a friend, and being of service. Being surrounded by these individuals has truly made it feel like a second home and seeing the passion in each of us to be of service to our community is one of the many reasons why I enjoy APO so much.\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nBeyond the Classroom: Music Education Major Mike Massaro Directs Two Local High School Bands\n\nMeet Mike Massaro, a recent Music Education graduate and commuter from Swedesboro, NJ (Gloucester County). He had the great opportunity to take his musical skills outside of the classroom and was able to direct the jazz band and marching band at a local high school. He tells us more about his experience and his passion for music education.\n\nFour years ago, every single person I knew was telling me, “All of the opportunities and resources are there, you just have to choose to use them.” Genuinely, it probably took me until my 7th semester to truly understand what that meant. However, I had been surfing the opportunities of Rowan University since the first day I stepped on the campus.\n\nMusic Education is considered a double major at RU — music and education. Because of this, my program involves being a student of both the College of Performing Arts and College of Education (two degrees, two commencement ceremonies, etc).\n\nThe most amazing aspect of this has been being able to learn from and collaborate with my student colleagues and the incomparable faculty from both colleges. Being around other people who want to see you learn is what truly can put your college education to the next level.\n\nI’m going to be very real here: more than likely, you will graduate. You will get the paper. At the end of the day, many will earn that paper, but the paper isn’t what matters in the end. It’s the education that went INTO the paper. What can YOU do to make what is very likely to be your most enriching 4+ years of education as educational as possible for YOU?\n\nAs an educator, my belief on this is very firm and was inspired by one of our CPA adjunct professors, Mr. Gerry DeLoach. The passion for what it is that you are teaching is what will drive you forward as an educator. Your knowledge and ability in your specific subject or field is what makes you tick. It is so important to keep that flare to learn alive. What you do in your field sets your ability for what you can do as a teacher. How tall will you let that ceiling be?\n\nHere’s a short story. I was offered a very rare opportunity to direct a marching band and jazz band at a local school, Woodstown High School, while still completing my undergrad. By my sophomore year I was directing the jazz band, and junior year I was directing the marching band. It was a dream come true come early — teaching real students.\n\nThe program showed success very quickly. One of my beliefs when it comes to teaching is that the best way to learn how to teach is to teach. I wanted to do as much as I could for this school’s music program. It seemed like every day I was at Rowan, speaking to my professors about teaching strategies, learning more about music, and sharing and listening to stories; then in the evening, I would go put it all into practice when I taught for real. One of my biggest focuses through my undergrad was on making this program grow, because I knew that the more I was able to learn as a musician and a teacher, the more I would be able to teach these students. I think it is very important as a teacher to learn from your students, as they can teach us far more than we can teach them. I certainly learned so much from them.\n\nRowan let me learn from these students.\n\nIf it wasn’t for the education that I received every day, the conversations and performing experiences that I had, I would have never had anything fresh to offer my students. I’ve had professors come out to Woodstown on their own time to give clinics to the bands and watch me teach. What the faculty has to offer is truly unmatched. Rowan is a growing school that still has a small school feel where it matters the most — in the classroom.\n\nThe professors here care for you and want to watch YOU learn. We don’t have massive educational lectures. We have conversations about the real world and how you can make it better. In my teaching, I can directly categorize aspects of individual professors that have molded so many aspects of my musicianship and teaching.\n\nThanks for making it to the bottom of my text blob. I have one more blurb. My trumpet professor, Dr. Bryan Appleby-Wineberg, once said, “You can’t change the whole world at once, but you can start by changing your corner of it.” Dr. AW’s belief about education is one that should resonate with all of us. Educators are at the center of any community. The educators teach the students, the students graduate, the students get jobs, contribute to our workforce, grow the economy — the students become the doctors, entertainers, designers, chefs, researchers who allow our community to grow. It all starts at the educator.\n\nThe educators are the students. The students are the educators. Be the best one you can be and take the opportunity. We are profs. Eruditio spes mundi — education, hope of the world.\n\nIf I knew my last time riding back from the student center on my skateboard holding my box of hot pulled pork with a piece of cornbread and a cup of red Gatorade would be my last time, I probably would have done it again. Remember that when you get nervous, it’s because you care.\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nRowan Commuters: Kayla Santiago [VIDEO]\n\nWelcome to our new “Rowan Commuter” series, where we take an inside look at the lives and experiences of Rowan University commuters and how their overall college experience is without living on campus.\n\nIn this video, Edelman College of Communication and Creative Arts double-major Kayla Santiago talks about how she balances a busy schedule with being a commuter student here at Rowan.\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nVideo by:\n\nTom Copsetta, radio/TV/film graduate\n\nRowan Commuters: James Milward [VIDEO]\n\nWelcome to our new “Rowan Commuter” series, where we take an inside look at the lives and experiences of Rowan University commuters and how their overall college experience is without living on campus.\n\nIn this video, Geology major James Milward talks about how he balances Rock Climbing Club and spending time with his group of Geology majors with being a commuter student here at Rowan.\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nVideo by:\n\nTom Copsetta, radio/TV/film graduate\n\nPassing the Torch: Psychology Major, Academic Coach Shares Her Parting Tips for Success\n\n“Take advantage of every opportunity in the Psychology department. Don’t be afraid to ask for help when needed, too,” says Chelsey Fitton from Woodstown, NJ (Salem County), who recently earned her Psychology degree.\n\n“I found the faculty and staff to be super helpful within the (Psychology) department. And it’s a family. The professors don’t really see you as a number, they know you by name. When I’d go in, they’d say, ‘Hi, Chelsey, how are you doing?’ That’s important, too,” she explains.\n\nChelsey, who transferred from Rowan College of South Jersey and commuted to campus, says to “stay involved as much as possible.” She was part of the honors society Delta Alpha Pi, for individuals with learning disabilities, and worked on campus as an academic coach with the Academic Success Center. Chelsey knows her future path will involve helping others.\n\n“I really enjoy working with people,” she says. “And even during this COVID situation, I’m finding I’m not a fan of isolating. I have to be around people.”\n\nReady to move forward, Chelsey couldn’t forget a few people who helped her along the way.\n\n“I’d like to thank my professors and my family for all their support because I definitely wouldn’t be where I am with a degree without them.”\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nPassing the Torch: Psychology Major, Prospective Grad Student Shares Tips For Success\n\n“Get involved in clubs and really make it worthwhile being a Prof,” says Sarah Transue, a recent graduate with a degree in Psychology and minor in neuroscience who commuted to campus from Mickleton, NJ (Gloucester County).\n\nHer advice for fellow commuters? “Get here super early before classes.”\n\nSarah, who transferred to Rowan, counts Perception as well as Psychology as a Profession and Practice among her favorite courses. She also enjoyed classes with Dr. Davis-LaMastro. “She really illuminated how each field of psychology is really different,” Sarah says.\n\nShe plans to return to campus in 2021 as a graduate student to pursue a master’s degree in mental health counseling.\n\n“I want to be a counselor in marriage and family therapy. It’s really fascinating how that whole system works,” Sarah says. “I hope to start in fall 2021. I’m very excited.”\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nFuture First Year\n\nMeet #Rowan2024: Mechanical Engineering Major Kenny Lieur\n\nToday we feature incoming freshman and mechanical engineering major Kenny Lieur. He is a first-generation college student from Pennsauken, NJ, (Camden County) and will be commuting to campus in the fall.\n\nWhat is something you’re looking forward to next year at Rowan?\n\nI am very excited about meeting new people with diverse skills and interesting backstories.\n\nWhat is one activity, club, sport or hobby that you did in high school that you’d like to continue with at Rowan?\n\nIn high school, I was on a FIRST robotics team in which we built robots to compete in competitions. I would like to continue something like this by joining the AIAA or even the Society of Automotive Engineers.\n\nHow or why did you choose your major?\n\nI chose Mechanical Engineering as my major because I love designing and building things that serve purposes that benefit society in profound ways.\n\nHow did you get to know the campus?\n\nI took a tour of the entire campus in the spring of 2019 with my classmates who also wanted to see what Rowan was like.\n\nWhat music do you like?\n\nI really like R&B and pop music.\n\nNight owl or morning person?\n\nI am more of a night owl since all the best ideas come to me at 3 a.m.\n\nWhy Rowan?\n\nRowan is the most affordable university near where I live. Not only that, but all of my duel enrollment credits would be accepted by Rowan, which would give me a leg up once I attend. Additionally, I heard that Rowan is a great school for engineering that is ABET-accredited.\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nSophomore Reflects: Tips from Computer Science Major Frank Ziegler\n\nMeet Frank Ziegler, sophomore computer science major, who commutes from Gibbsboro, NJ (Camden County). Frank reflects on his years at Rowan and shares what he has learned.\n\nWhen I first started school at Rowan, I didn’t understand how the online system (i.e. Blackboard, Self-Service, Starfish) worked. It took me some time to figure out the flow of things. For incoming freshmen, I’d suggest to look over these platforms before the semester starts or ask someone for help. Usually 9 times out of 10, they’re happy to help if you ask politely.\n\nFrom my experience, people in the Rowan community are generally friendly and helpful. I’ve actually created friendships here by asking for help whether for an assignment or lesson I was struggling with.\n\nChoosing a major for me was hard. My passion is making music, but I also really enjoy solving code. For me it was a decision of how to balance my passion with my career or turning my passion my career. For someone dealing with the same problem, I would suggest to consider what you enjoy and see yourself doing in the future. I’m happy with my major and hope you will be too.\n\nIf possible, I definitely would recommend living on-campus to fully immerse yourself in the culture, especially if you’re more of an introvert. Commuting hindered my social life, but I joined some clubs and found like-minded people I enjoy hanging out with.\n\nJoin Rowan Vocals if you can sing. Seriously. That’s how I made friends. I’ve never felt more comfortable with a group than I do with them. They are such great people. And if you can’t sing, join a group that fits your interests. It’s the best thing I did for my college experience.\n\nMy biggest piece of advice is to understand that going to college is a lifestyle change. I had a really hard time at first because I was dealing with mental health issues and lacked motivation. I wish I had more time to prepare and understand how to best manage my time. I work part-time, commute and do a lot of music production work, so every semester I adapt to the workload and class schedule.\n\nCollege is in no way like high school, it’s like a full-time job. You need to fully commit to it and and learn how to manage your time to make the best of it. The faster, the better.\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nStory by:\n\nFrank Ziegler, sophomore computer science major\n\nPhotos courtesy of:\n\nFrank Ziegler\n\nJunior Major Moments: Disaster Preparedness and Emergency Management Major Connor Crafton-Tempel\n\nToday we feature Disaster Preparedness and Management major Connor Crafton-Tempel from Freehold, NJ (Monmouth County). Connor is a transfer student and commutes to campus.\n\nCould you share your favorite moment with a faculty member or a favorite experience in one of your classes?\n\nProfessor Carty, who taught my Disaster Planning, Mitigation, and Recovery course at our Camden campus, was a really big influence on me. When I first came into the program, I knew I wanted to work for the Philadelphia Office of Emergency Management (OEM), but I didn’t know exactly what I wanted to do with the OEM.\n\nThen, Professor Carty was teaching us about threat and risk assessments, just before the COVID-19 outbreak turned into a pandemic. It was during her class that I realized I wanted to go into disaster planning and specially work on disease-related disasters (mainly epidemics and pandemics).\n\nWhat is the most amazing or interesting ​thing you’ve learned in your major this year?\n\nI think that the most interesting thing I learned this year was how to perform a threat assessment. This is becoming really helpful, since my parish has asked me to help with the reopening.\n\nWhat pre-professional experiences are helping to support your growth?\n\nI’d have to say my honor society (Epsilon Pi Phi, the DPEM honor society) and Rowan University EMS. Rowan EMS is helping me gain new skills as an EMT, and the honor society is beneficial for getting connections within the industry.\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\n#MeetRowan2024: Multi-talented Marketing Major Megan Steckler\n\nToday we feature future freshman and Marketing major Megan Steckler from Mullica Hill, NJ (Gloucester County).

Hopefully, I will continue to play lacrosse. I also want to continue participating in Key Club, or another volunteer-oriented club, and Distributive Education Clubs of America (DECA) at Rowan.\n\nHow or why did you choose your major?​\n\nIn high school, I was part of a specialized program called the Business Leadership Academy (BLA). It is a business-oriented curriculum that I found challenging and a lot of fun!\n\nI like business because it is such a versatile subject. One of my favorite classes in the BLA at Kingsway High School was my marketing class. I love the creative side of business, and I want to continue to explore that part specifically in college.\n\nHow did you get to know campus?\n\nI live close to Rowan, I attended Rowan’s Think Like an Entrepreneur camp last summer, and my older sister attends Rowan now. So, even though I have never received an “official” tour, I am already very familiar with the campus.\n\nWhat music do you like?\n\nI love pop, rock and alternative music.\n\nNight owl or morning person?\n\nI am definitely a night owl!\n\nWhy Rowan?​​\n\nRowan is a really good school, it is close to home, and I was fortunate to receive a Merit Scholarship. Also, the school is still growing, the campus is expanding, and I can’t wait to get started! I am excited about all of the opportunities at Rowan!

We were able to speak to her just before she was getting ready to leave campus because of social distancing to protect society from the spread of COVID-19.\n\nWhat academic and social clubs are you a part of?\n\nI am a part of Unified Sports, Pre-Allied Health Club, and American Sign Language Club.\n\nDo you have any on-campus jobs?\n\nWhen the campus reopens, I will be working at the Rec Center!\n\nWhy did you choose a university close to home?\n\nI couldn’t imagine being too far from my family, and Rowan was the only college I toured that felt like “home” away from home.\n\nHow do you get that “away” feeling while close to home?\n\nHanging out with friends on campus, whether that is to study or have fun.\n\nWhat is the most interesting thing you did on campus this year?\n\nI helped out at the Unified Sports Championship game.\n\nWhat is the most interesting thing you’ve learned in a class this year?\n\nAll of the material I learned in Psych of Human Sexuality! I highly recommend this course to anyone; I left each class feeling like I learned something new about myself.\n\nWhat advice do you have for incoming freshmen?\n\nEnjoy every moment, get involved, study hard, and make memories you’ll never forget!\n\nWhat’s the best decision you’ve made since you got to college?\n\nVolunteering with the Get Fit program.\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nStory and photography by:\n\nRachel Rumsby, rising sophomore communication studies and public relations double major\n\n3 Ways I Make College More Affordable\n\nToday we feature junior Communication Studies major and Journalism minor Christian A.

Here, Brenden shares his favorite Rowan memories and his plans for the future.\n\nCould you please tell us about your favorite moment with a faculty member or a favorite experience in one of your classes?\n\nA favorite moment of mine happened in the course Edelman Fossil Park Experience with Dr. Voegele. Having the opportunity to uncover fossils in the research pit was incredible. I’ll never forget the first fossil I unearthed. It was especially memorable when I was able to record and map my finds in the log book.\n\nWhat was your favorite or most meaningful personal moment at Rowan?\n\nI couldn’t pick just one moment at Rowan, so I have to say sitting around the campfire on every camping trip with the Rowan Outdoors Club. Serving on the e-board of the outdoors club has been a favorite part of my Rowan experience by far. Giving Rowan students a chance to escape and enjoy nature is incredibly rewarding. The friends I’ve met through the club will surely be lifelong.\n\nWhat are your career aspirations and how did the people or programs at Rowan help to support you with those aspirations?\n\nI plan on becoming a surgical technician first, then going to physician’s assistant school. Dr. Supplee and Dr. Grinias helped me when I was having second thoughts about my original plan and helped me see that plans can change. This allowed me to rethink and make a new plan about my future.\n\nDo you want to give a thank you shout out to your family, friends, advisors or mentors?\n\nI want to thank my family and friends for always supporting my decisions and for keeping me grounded, Katie Huber and Kristin Henderson at the Rec Center for always being there to help and listen, and Dr. Grinias and Dr. Jonnalagadda for inspiring me to continue when I felt like giving up.\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nHeader photo: Brenden Finley (left) with friends\n\nFuture First Year\n\nMeet #Rowan2024: Biological Sciences Major AnneMarie Dominique\n\nToday we feature incoming freshman and Biological Sciences major AnneMarie Dominique.

I don’t think I’ll compete, but it’s always an option.\n\nHow or why did you choose your major?​\n\nI chose my major because my mom is a registered nurse. She’s been a registered nurse for over 25 years and she has been in every department possible. Now she is a school nurse.\n\nGrowing up, she was always talking about what happened at work, what happens when you don’t take care of yourself, and what drugs can do to the human body. So I kind of ran with it and tested it out when I took Human Anatomy And Physiology in high school. When I realized I enjoyed the class and it was easy for me, I decided that I wanted to go into the medical field. Since I love children, I thought why not combine the two and be a pediatrician. That’s how I chose my major.\n\nHow did you get to know campus?\n\nI joined the Rowan family right when everything was closing because of COVID-19 so everything that I know is from online. Since everything is changing I’m curious as to what the in-person experience will be like but I’m excited to see what it holds.\n\nWhat music do you like?\n\nAs far as music, I am in love with music and I love variety. Old, new, throwbacks, R&B, Rap, Hip-Hop, Socca, Pop, etc. I’m always willing to try new music so the list just keeps expanding.\n\nNight owl or morning person?\n\nI am 1000% a night owl. I’m -1000% a morning person. Everyone that knows me knows better than to wake me up in the morning without food and coffee or juice.\n\nWhy Rowan?​​\n\nI chose Rowan because I heard it’s a great school and I recently moved to the area. But, before choosing Rowan I drove through the campus a little and I liked it. It was alive and I wanted to be a part of it. I feel like that is how you should start the next chapter of your life — finding something that seduces you to want more.\n\nLike what you see?LEARN MORE\n\nPandemic Profs\n\nStudy with Me: Sound Design [VIDEO]\n\nWatch Adam Clark, a senior Radio/TV/Film major, as he takes you through the final project in his Sound for Film & Video class.

The Reading Clinic is where I had my classes School Reading Problems and Supervised Clinical Practice in Reading. In those classes, I was able to tutor children with reading comprehension, fluency, writing and word study. I loved seeing how much the children’s literacy skills grew by the end of each semester.\n\nIn this class, I worked with amazing people who guided me in my journey to become a teacher. Those people include my classmates, Kelly the secretary, and my professor the amazing Dr. Valarie Lee. I also loved my time at the Rowan University Early Childhood Demonstration Center. The children and staff there were all so sweet, and it was the best way to either start or end my school day! I loved seeing how creative the children could be. And I loved having little dance parties with the children. I do not think I ever had a day there where I was not laughing or smiling.\n\nWhat are the things you will miss the most about Rowan?\n\nI will definitely miss the staff and students at Rowan University Early Childhood Demonstration Center. I will also miss my advisor (April Ellerbe), and my professors I had throughout my years here at Rowan. I will also miss HollyBash, it was always something I looked forward to during the Spring semester.\n\nWhat’s next for you?\n\nI have been applying to many daycares to become a teacher lead, and I am just waiting to hear back from them. I heard back from one daycare, and they told me when they are open again they will get in touch with me!\n\nAny advice for those who are graduating next year?\n\nBe proud of this accomplishment no matter how long it took you. I am graduating with my bachelor’s in Literacy Studies after six years of college, and I am very proud of myself. No matter if you graduate in four years or six years or more than that, what you have done is amazing and I want you to celebrate this milestone. You deserve it!\n\nLike what you see?\n\nBehind the Scenes with #Rowan2020 Contest Winner Edgar Aquino Huerta, Creator of the Viral Graduation Video\n\nMeet recent graduate and #Rowan2020 Social Media contest winner, Edgar Aquino Huerta! Edgar, from Bridgeton, NJ (Cumberland County), earned a bachelor’s degree in Radio/TV/Film. His virtual commencement video became a viral sensation and caught the attention of national media outlets. Read more about Edgar and his plans after Rowan.\n\nEdgar Aquino Huerta wants to be famous for creating videos and films, but he never expected popularity to come so soon.\n\nHis 15-second video has racked up over 600,000 views on TikTok, over 34,000 views on Instagram, and over 3,500 views on Facebook.\n\nEdgar’s video features him celebrating his graduation at the farm where he works. In it, he watches Rowan’s “virtual commencement,” and then walks down the center aisle of a greenhouse as his coworkers applaud. This is set to the tune of Glenn Miller’s “In the Mood,” a song that makes Edgar think of the Golden Age of Hollywood — fitting, since he dreams of making it big as a screenwriter and director.\n\nWhen Rowan announced a social media contest, Edgar started brainstorming. The best five posts from graduating Profs would win $100 Target gift cards, and Edgar thought that “sounded good.” At first, he struggled to come up with an original idea. Then, his boss made a joke about holding commencement at the farm.\n\nEdgar ran with that idea and drew up storyboards. He says, “Although my video was 15 seconds, I still wanted to use my skills to make it cinematic.” He learned a lot as a Radio/TV/Film major at Rowan, and wanted to make the best contest entry possible.\n\nEdgar says that two of his coworkers, Maria and Jose, were especially important to the video’s production. Maria helped organize everyone by telling the other workers where to stand. Jose assumed the role of cameraman — despite having never used an iPhone before! Edgar taught him on the fly and was impressed with how quickly Jose caught on.\n\nAt first, Edgar says his coworkers didn’t understand the video they were making. He says, “It wasn’t until they saw the final picture that they understood the purpose of the video.” That said, they were always enthusiastic to help celebrate his achievement. And later on, some coworkers “even made their kids download TikTok so they could show their families.”\n\nEdgar also received support from his mother, who has been in Mexico for the past 10 years. She got “sentimental because she couldn’t be with [him] during that little ceremony.” The image on Edgar’s cap is actually a picture he drew of his mother. He included that as a way to recognize all she’s done for him over the years.\n\nEdgar’s video got very popular overnight, and only got more buzz from there. He says, “The next morning, I noticed the video was going viral.” His phone was going off constantly with notifications. It wasn’t before long that news stations caught wind of the sensation. He has now been featured on several platforms, including Good Morning America, Un Nuevo Dia (Telemundo), and Despierta America (Univision). Edgar says, “I was making headlines for one week straight, and getting to talk to people I never thought I would meet.” He was even contacted about a few work opportunities in Los Angeles.\n\nEdgar attributes the video’s viral success to a couple different factors. For one, it was uploaded at just the right time. With the COVID-19 pandemic ruining gatherings of all kinds, these are unprecedented times. Edgar’s uniquely safe way of celebrating acts as a much-needed ray of hope. Edgar says, “I turned a bad situation into something great.” Additionally, the video encourages pride in underappreciated workers. Greenhouses are places of hard manual labor, but Edgar chose to celebrate its beauty instead. Edgar says, “I was aiming at inspiring my community into being proud of where they come from, and to never feel ashamed of our own people.”\n\nIn the future, Edgar plans to move to Los Angeles and write screenplays. He credits Rowan’s Professor Keir Politz with helping him decide to pursue this path. Edgar wants to expose his “audience to these worlds that are being ignored.” For now, Edgar and his friends are working on projects to show appreciation for farm workers in their community. They do this though organizing caravans and collecting donations to meet the workers’ needs. Edgar wants everyone to know that farm workers are essential.\n\nYou can hear about Edgar’s immigration story in this audio documentary from Rowan Radio.\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nStory by:\n\nAdam Clark, senior radio/television/film major\n\n#PROFspective: Pre-Med Junior Andrea Owens on the Biological Sciences Major, Making Change in Healthcare\n\nToday we feature Andrea Owens, a junior Biological Sciences major with a Chemistry minor and concentration in pre-medicine. Andrea is a transfer and a first-generation college student. She commuted from home before COVID-19 shut down campus. Andrea will share with us her #PROFspective on what it’s like to be a Rowan University student and how she’s getting the most out of her college experience as a Rowan Prof.\n\nOn campus Andrea is a member of the Minority Association of Pre-medical Students (MAPS), The Tau Sigma National Honor Society, and the Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority Incorporated (AKA). Off campus she works in retail at New York & Company.\n\nWhat inspired you to choose your major?\n\nSince I was 5 years old, I always knew that I wanted to become a doctor. So, once I got to high school, I mastered biology and chemistry and decided to major and minor in them.\n\nWhat would you share with a future student interested in your major?\n\nMy first advice to any transfer students who are majoring in Biology is to make friends who are within your major. The beginning of my first semester at Rowan, I did not have any friends in my major. I studied alone for everything, which caused a lot of stress. Once I made friends with people in my major, we formed many study groups and I found the biggest support system. The friends I have made are truly amazing, and I could not thank them enough.\n\nHow does your field impact the world? What impact would you like to have on the world in your field?\n\nThe importance of the healthcare field is that the conditions of life are always changing, and as long as there are health care providers who are specifically trained in medicine, there will always be help. An impact that I would love to have in my field is to make minorities feel heard and important. In the medical field, there are thousands of stories on how African Americans do not feel as though they are getting the proper treatment when they are being treated or examined by health care professionals. I am going to make that change.\n\nDescribe for us an experience you’ve shared with a Rowan professor in which you felt like you were working with a visionary in your field?\n\nDr. Kristen Barrett was my professor for Organic Chemistry I and II. She is a young African-American woman in her field, and she provided superb detail in everything she did while I took her courses. Her path of excellence inspires all her students, including me.\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nStory by:\n\nMelanie Sbaraglio, public relations and advertising graduate\n\nPhotos courtesy of:\n\nAndrea Owens\n\nFuture First Year\n\nMeet #Rowan2024: Civil and Environmental Engineering Major Bridget McDevitt\n\nToday we feature Civil and Environmental Engineering major Bridget McDevitt. She is from Logan Township, NJ (Gloucester County) and will be commuting to Rowan in the fall.\n\nWhat is something you’re looking forward to next year at Rowan?\n\nSomething that I’m looking forward to next year at Rowan is finally beginning to trek forward on developing my career. I’m beyond excited to be taught by incredibly educated professors, and to dive headfirst into knowledge, as cliche as it sounds. I’m also excited to be learning in a new environment that’s more tailored to the individual student as opposed to high school.\n\nWhat is one activity, club, sport or hobby that you did in high school that you’d like to continue with at Rowan?\n\nI didn’t participate too much in high school, and it really wasn’t until my junior or senior year where I came out of my shell and developed my hobby of gardening! It’s so rewarding giving back to the planet meanwhile channeling your creativity in the aesthetics of landscaping. So, I’d like to join some gardening and environmental clubs. Also, writing and fashion are secret diversions of mine, so I would join some clubs geared towards that as well.\n\nHow or why did you choose your major?​\n\nI chose my major because growing up, my dad used gardening as his release from the world and as I got older, I really recognized the significance in that. Plus, through his gardening lessons, we created a bond. I want to protect the land and the soil that he cultivates, and on a broader scheme I would like to preserve the ecosystems within various communities. So, I thought environmental engineering would fit right in. Also, I intended on double majoring in community health and perhaps minoring in English.\n\nHow did you get to know campus?\n\nLiving in Logan Township, I’ve had family members who attended Rowan and the university is pretty much a household name. I’ve driven by the campus plenty of times, but it wasn’t until I went on a tour where it really struck me as a place where I’d want to further my education. It’s quaint, but still a vibrant little campus.\n\nWhat music do you like?\n\nI love all types of music! But to name a few genres, I prefer indie, rock, alternative, and punk. My diverse concert list ranges from Taylor Swift, to KISS (not by choice), all the way to Warped Tour.\n\nNight owl or morning person?\n\nMost certainly I am a night owl. My creativity seems to ignite anytime past 11 p.m., which was a good excuse to hand in assignments late 🙂 mornings are only attractive when you’re at the beach.\n\nWhy Rowan?​​\n\nI was attracted to the proximity of Rowan, and of course the affordability. I plan on furthering my education for a long time coming, hopefully eventually getting my doctorates. That being said, cost efficacy was a big factor. Not only is it affordable, but you also acquire a quality education, which of course is my number one priority. Plus, my mom is my best friend. Leaving her is a thought I cannot handle!!\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nFuture First Year\n\nMeet #Rowan2024: Computer Science Major Joe Talucci\n\nToday we feature Joe Talucci, a Computer Science major from Haddon Township, NJ (Camden County). Joe will be commuting to Rowan this fall as an incoming freshman.\n\nWhat is something you’re looking forward to next year at Rowan?\n\nI am looking forward to meeting my classmates and the faculty.\n\nWhat is one activity, club, sport or hobby that you did in high school that you’d like to continue with at Rowan?\n\nI’d love to continue with performing arts like acting, playing the violin, and helping out backstage.\n\nHow or why did you choose your major?​\n\nI chose Computer Science because I love working with computers. Coding is a great outlet for creativity that uses my skillset.\n\nHow did you get to know campus?\n\nI took a tour earlier this year and revisited on Accepted Students Day.\n\nWhat music do you like?\n\nI like Jazz, especially by Jimmy Rushing.\n\nNight owl or morning person?\n\nNight owl, but it depends on my sleep schedule.\n\nWhy Rowan?​​\n\nI know several upperclassmen who went here and had great experiences with the faculty, and I’m excited to meet them.\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nFuture Transfer\n\nTRANSFERmation Tuesday: Early Childhood Education Major Jordyn Briner\n\nToday’s TRANSFERmation Tuesday features Jordyn Briner, a transfer from Rowan College at Burlington County. Jordyn is a junior early childhood education major who commutes to campus from her home in Burlington Township, NJ (Burlington County).\n\nOne moment that made you feel inspired or confident that you’re in the right field for you?\n\nIn high school, I always wanted to be a Special Education Teacher, when I went off to college I wasn’t 100% confident in my choice. So I decided to major in 3 different programs for an associate degree. I began working in a Special Services school my sophomore year of college. I loved the job, coworkers and the children. Seeing the strides the children would make and seeing how you made a difference in their lives really helped me see I chose the right path all along.\n\nWhy did you choose Rowan?\n\nMy mother attended Rowan when it was called Glassboro State. She loved it when she attended, and I thought I would too. Since working full- and part-time, the commute is much easier. 45 minutes to commute is long due to traffic but I really couldn’t see myself going anywhere other than Rowan. Its education program was highly spoken of and was known for having one of the best education programs.\n\nWhat are you most looking forward to at Rowan next year?​\n\nI’m looking forward to my last couple of field placements and eventually my clinical practice. Next year, will be my last year at Rowan (as an undergrad, will be attending for graduate). I also look forward to their on-campus workshops, activities, and events.\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nFuture First Year\n\nJulia’s Corner: Finding Friends\n\nRecent grad Julia McAleavey shares guidance through this advice column for incoming students. A student with well-rounded experience, Julia earned a bachelor’s in advertising. She transferred to Rowan her sophomore year, after another school wasn’t a great fit. While at Rowan she started as an exploratory studies major, unsure of what to major in. She’s lived both on campus and off campus, held student worker jobs and internships, and participated in clubs and sports.\n\nThere are a lot of things about starting college that can be absolutely terrifying. One of those things is worrying about finding friends. I’ve got some good news for you: you are not the only person anxious about this. Every college first year or new transfer is worried about not making any friends. Here are some ways to help you come out of your comfort zone and break that fear of never finding friends.\n\nGet out of your room.\n\nWhen first moving in, you might not know what to really do with yourself besides sit in your room and watch television. Or, if you commute, you might just drive to campus and back home after class. I know this is a crazy time for you and it’s so easy to get stuck inside, but do not do this! Friends are not just going to magically appear at your door. Sure, you might have been friends with your roommate already, but you both need other friends so you do not get sick of living with each other.\n\nA good start would be to go to the events that your resident assistant sets up at the beginning of the semester, or make a point to go to the September organization fair, where there are tons of tables of people representing their clubs and organizations. This way, you get out of your room (or car), and get to know some of the people.\n\nGo to first-year student events.\n\nAt the beginning of the semester, there will be some events to attend for new students to get to know each other. Rowan After Hours (RAH) has a lot of fun, late-night events to get students to interact with one another. They might sound lame at first, but don’t let that keep you from going. You might even meet your best friends there. Plus, there is usually free food of some kind, and it’s hard to say no to that, right?\n\nTwo words: Get. Involved.\n\nThis is HUGE! Many first year and new transfers go into college not wanting to get involved because they are afraid they will fall behind on school work or won’t fit in. Yes, it is true you are at Rowan for a degree, but getting involved in something will help you to make friends and professional connections. I joined the Swim Club and it introduced me to my best friends.\n\nThere are a lot of activity fairs at the beginning of each semester to share information about different clubs and organizations. Look out for these dates so you can find the perfect fit for you.\n\nI’m going to be completely honest with you — college can sometimes feel like a lonely place. You might feel sad and overwhelmed and might even just want to go home. But once you find a great group of friends everything will fall into place.\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nStory by:\n\nJulia McAleavey, advertising graduate\n\nSenior Reflects: From Military to Music Industry, Travis Keiser Thanks Faculty, Family, Friends\n\nToday we feature Travis Keiser, a Music Industry: Technology major from Washington, NJ (Warren County). He transferred and was commuting to Rowan before COVID-19 shut down campus.\n\nCould you please tell us about your favorite moment with a faculty member or a favorite experience in one of your classes?\n\nOne of my favorite moments was when my professor Barb Adams told me that I looked exhausted and I joked saying, “It must be from all the exhaustion I’ve been getting.” We both chuckled. She pulled me aside after and asked if I was okay and was genuinely concerned about my lack of sleep due to school. It’s that level of caring that is truly amazing.\n\nWhat was your favorite or most meaningful personal moment at Rowan?\n\nDuring Public Speaking, I was giving my first speech and completely froze up in the middle of my speech. Instead of the class quietly giggling, I was greeted with “You’ve got this” and “It’s all good dude!” [There was] a lot of positivity that I was not used to.\n\nWhat are your career aspirations and how did the people or programs at Rowan help to support you with those aspirations?\n\nI would love to work in post-production for a music/movie studio, as well as become a movie/tv show score composer. The Music Industry department faculty have really given me the expertise and knowledge that I need to pursue these careers.\n\nDo you want to give a thank you shout out to your family, friends, advisors or mentors?\n\nI want to give a huge thank you to Beth and Connie at the Military Service office for all of their help during my time at Rowan. Transitioning from military to college life was difficult, but they made it easy. They seriously are the best and deserve a raise!\n\nAlso a HUUUUUUGE thank you to Jeff Hiatt, Barb Adams, Jeff Otto, and Mat Gendreau for all of their mentoring and teaching. And one last shoutout to Matt, Emma, Stella, Mike, my mom, sister and my girlfriend Katie for all of their amazing support and love throughout this journey!\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nFuture First Year\n\nMeet #Rowan2024: Mechanical Engineering Major Emma Redmond\n\nToday we feature Mechanical Engineering major Emma Redmond.

I am looking forward to meeting all of the new people at Rowan, and making some new friends!\n\nWhat is one activity, club, sport or hobby that you did in high school that you’d like to continue with at Rowan? I would love to continue playing my flute when I am at Rowan.\n\nHow or why did you choose your major?​ I chose my major because I went to a vocational-technical high school on an engineering track, and I have really discovered how much I love solving problems in my own way!\n\nHow did you get to know campus? I came to a tour my junior year with my Gloucester County Institute of Technology class, and attended a STEM workshop at Rowan as well which was a blast!\n\nWhat music do you like? I enjoy alternative rock, classic rock, and K-pop mostly.\n\nNight owl or morning person? Morning person, my puppy gets me up early. 🙂\n\nWhy Rowan?​​ I chose Rowan because not only do in-state students get great tuition prices, but the engineering program is fantastic. I feel like I will be challenged, will gain real-world work experience, and it being very close to home is another plus.\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nStudent Life\n\nMy Experience of Making Friends as a Commuter\n\nToday we feature junior communication studies major and journalism minor Christian A.

Paige is from Mantua, NJ (Gloucester County) and will commute to Rowan in the fall as a Supply Chain and Logistics major. Paige was recently awarded the John Green Memorial Service Award for 2020 for incoming students.\n\nWhy Rowan?\n\nWhy Rowan? There are so many reasons. I have grown up living 15 minutes from the campus. I have seen it grow and expand into what it is now over my 18 years of life. I used to have my dance recitals in Pfleeger Hall, I attended pre-college summer programs on the campus, and I visit the Edelman Planetarium with my family. For so many reasons I always knew that Rowan was going to be where I spent my college years. Even during the application process when I applied to multiple schools, I knew they couldn’t compare to the experience I would have at Rowan. Another major factor that played into my college decision was the affordability aspect. As a commuter student, I will be pay almost 1/10 of what some of my peers will be paying to go to other out of state schools for an experience and education I am sure will be equivalent. I look forward to walking down Rowan Boulevard and stopping in the local businesses. I anticipate becoming a member of many clubs. I am eager to be learning in a building that I feel connected to. Most of all, I am excited to begin my journey as a Prof.\n\nWhat is on activity, club, sport, or hobby that you did in high school that you’d like to continue with at Rowan?\n\nI spent most of my time involved in student government at my school. I enjoyed helping plan our homecoming and prom dances with the class advisors. An event that I always looked forward to was our Hoagies 4 Hope fundraiser on Superbowl Sunday. It was a great way to see all of the members of our community come together for a cause greater than just ourselves. I also spent a lot of time doing community service projects with other students. I helped run 3 blood drives during my time and organizing and encouraging my fellow students and teachers to donate blood, especially when there were blood shortages, was very meaningful to me. I look forward to hopefully continuing my work with student government and finding ways to serve the Rowan community on campus next year!\n\nHow or why did you choose your major?\n\nI’ve known for a while that I wanted to be a business major. I spent time deciding which major or business I wanted to go into. I heavily considered the popular majors such as Accounting and Marketing but ultimately decided on Supply Chain & Logistics. When researching the major, I liked that it was almost a mixture of all of the disciplines of business. I also have learned about myself over the past few years that I am someone who focuses a lot on logistical issues. Another important part for me is that the job opportunities are endless and they are necessary in many different industries. Being a Supply Chain & Logistics major ultimately for me is where I see myself excelling and I am excited for where it will bring me.\n\nWhat is something you’re looking forward to next year at Rowan?\n\nNext year I am looking forward to officially becoming a Prof and seeing all that it has to bring for me! The opportunities that Rowan will offer me seem to be endless. I think if I had to name one thing to say I am looking forward to is immersing myself into a new area and growing as a person. A few things I am looking forward to are joining clubs, attending social gatherings, and viewing sporting events. Along with those I am excited to meet the professors and faculty that I will learn so much from over the next few years and taking advantage of all of the academic experiences I will be able to.\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nJunior Major Moments: Law and Justice Major, Student-Athlete Johnathan Nguyen\n\nToday we feature Johnathan Nguyen, a Law & Justice major from Galloway, NJ (Atlantic County) and a member of Rowan’s Track and Field team. He is a first-generation college student who transferred to Rowan and commuted until COVID-19 shut down campus.\n\nWhat is one of your favorite moments with a faculty/staff member or a favorite experience in one of your classes?\n\nOne of my favorite moments with a faculty or staff member would have to be meeting Coach Dimit. He introduced me to the school and team and made me feel like family the moment I stepped on Rowan’s campus.\n\nWhat is the most amazing or interesting ​thing you’ve learned in your major this year?\n\nThe most interesting thing I learned about this year would have to be in my class “Treatment of the Offender.” You learn so much different material and it wouldn’t be the same without my professor Joel Friedman.\n\nWhat pre-professional experiences are helping to support your growth?\n\nThe internship I will be applying to in spring 2021 is helping me grow as a person and help guide me to be a better person in school. There are guidelines to make for the internship so I would have to keep my GPA up and make sure I have enough credits every semester.\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nStory by:\n\nMelanie Sbaraglio, public relations and advertising graduate\n\nFuture First Year\n\nMeet #Rowan2024: Computing and Informatics Major Fahima Kashem\n\nToday we speak to Fahima Kashem, an incoming freshman from Camden County. Fahima will major in Computing and Informatics and plans to commute. Fahima is a first generation college student.\n\nWhy did you choose a university that was close to home? I choose Rowan because I started to visit Rowan and attend Rowan events way before I started college since all my friends go to Rowan. My senior year I visited few more colleges but I knew Rowan was the one, it felt like home!\n\nCould you share with us one moment you’ve had with a club or a group of friends that made you feel like Rowan is “home”? This semester I took a class with my best friend and it’s probably the best thing we decided to do and that really felt like I was just hanging out with her at home.\n\nWhat is one thing about Rowan that was a happy surprise for you?

I think the one thing I enjoyed most about my freshman year was getting to know the people I have become close with and finding my place on campus. I am surround by such a great community of people at Rowan and they have made me feel so welcomed and loved.\n\nCould you share with one happy moment you had with friends, professors, or other members of the Rowan community that made you realize Rowan felt like “home”? I do live only 15 minutes away from campus so I commute. It was hard making friends the first semester I won’t lie about that, but after I found my place on campus I was never home. I was always out hanging with friends, grabbing food, doing homework with people, and kept busy on campus. I even would sometimes stay on campus with my friends when I just didn’t want to be at home! Also commuting will not stop you from finding your home on campus.\n\nWhat clubs or activities are you involved in on campus? I am a theatre arts major so I help out with the shows a lot and maybe next season I’ll be in one who knows! So I really enjoy doing that, but this semester I rushed for a Sorority and got a bid for Alpha Sigma Tau. Being a part of Greek Life has definitely made my college experience ten times better. I love all my sisters to death and I am in such an amazing community on campus. They are all so loving and supporting, I couldn’t imagine not being apart of Greek Life. It does suck a little because corona had postponed our initiation until the fall, but we all stay very close in touch and are so excited for next semester. We Zoom a lot too.\n\nWhat advice do you have for future freshmen looking at colleges right now? Looking at colleges is going to be really hard right now due to everything going on in the world. It’s hard to visit campus’s and get a tour, I also know that it matters to you. Don’t stress about where you’re going too hard, I know that it is a very stressful process. I say keep your options open because you never know, you could fall in love with a school you didn’t even give a second thought. I can say this from my stand point of being a commuter, It’s so close to my house I didn’t even want to go here until I gave it a chance. I got into my #1 school and still chose Rowan because I ended up falling in love with it. Don’t be scared if you plan on commuting either, it won’t stop you from doing anything! Just keep up the grades you having going for you now and focus on what you’re looking for. The process is worth it I promise.\n\nWhat are you most looking forward to next year at Rowan? The biggest thing I am looking forward to next year is definitely seeing all my friends again and having them come back home to Rowan. I miss them so much and online classes kind of suck but the world is going through a tough time right now. I also cannot wait for my classes in the fall! I am taking some cool classes like Singing for the Actor and Fundamentals of Tap. I cannot wait to learn to tap dance. I also am so excited for fall and spring recruitment, I can’t wait to be apart of that. Next semester can’t come any sooner.\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nFuture Transfer\n\nTRANSFERmation Tuesday: College of Business Double Major Christina Wilgus\n\nToday’s TRANSFERmation Tuesday features Christina Wilgus, a junior transfer from Rowan College at Gloucester County. Christina is a Management and Human Resources Management major who commutes to Rowan from Woolwich Township, NJ (Gloucester County).\n\nHow would you tell a fellow student interested in your major that they’re choosing a worthwhile field?\n\nI would tell a fellow student interested in Management and Human Resources Management that they’re choosing a worthwhile field because there are no limits to what you can do. Majoring in Management equips you to work in every type of professional setting. I chose this field for the never-ending opportunities. Every industry has a business side, so there are no restrictions on the fields you can work in. I also find myself learning real-life lessons that are beneficial outside of business, that I may not learn in a different major. I often find myself in these instances during my law and finance classes.\n\nIn high school, I had thought about majoring in Human Resources because I love interacting and communicating with others. However, I was nervous to commit to a major that was a bit narrow, so I decided to begin college as a Management major. But, when I transferred to Rowan they made it possible for me to do both without any extra classes. I am especially thankful for this opportunity because I never expressed to anyone at Rowan my interest in HR, but they sought me out. I received an email stating that many Management majors may be able to fill their electives with HR classes and fulfill the requirements for both majors. I was lucky enough to be one of those cases. If it wasn’t for the employees at Rowan actively looking to improve the quality of their students’ education, I would have never thought to pursue this opportunity. So, if you are a transfer student or freshman Management major I strongly suggest you consider this opportunity!\n\nWhat is the most interesting thing you’ve learned in your major this year?\n\nThe most interesting thing I learned about my major this year is how to adapt. Everyone is currently in the same situation with learning online because of campus closures due to Covid-19. For me, and many business students, we still have group projects that have remained group projects. This has forced us to adapt by communicating via text, FaceTime and Zoom. I believe this experience has better prepared us for the event of collaborating with co-workers on a project who may not live near us. In those situations, we will be forced to work together solely through technology. These instances also occur outside of a global pandemic, so it is a great skill for us to pick up and master during this time.\n\nWhy did you choose Rowan?\n\nI chose Rowan for the great education I could receive so close to home. They had just built the new, beautiful building for the Rohrer College of Business and I had heard nothing but great things about Rowan’s business program. My brother graduated from Rowan in 2012 with a degree in Management so I also got to see first-hand how great the school was and how much they were expanding. I am only in my second semester at Rowan, but I am confident that I made the right decision to continue my education here. Rowan has become so much more than our local university, and I am glad I get to be a part of its student body.\n\nWhat are you most looking forward to at Rowan next year?​\n\nNext year I am looking forward to getting more involved. I came from a small high school and then went to community college, and I was very involved in both schools. This past fall I was adjusting to being at a bigger school and didn’t realize just how much there was to get involved in.\n\nMy goal for this semester was to join a few clubs and be active on campus but unfortunately, that will have to wait until next semester. I look forward to my senior year. Rowan has provided me with so much help and guidance in preparing for my career, so I can’t wait to get back on campus in the fall!\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nStory by:\n\nNicole Cier, writing arts graduate\n\nFuture First Year\n\nMeet #Rowan2024: Biological Sciences Major Serena Amuzu on the Pre-Med Track, Staying Close to Home\n\nToday we feature Serena Amuzu, an incoming Biological Sciences major who will commute from Wenonah, NJ (Gloucester County) when she begins at Rowan this fall.\n\nWhat is one activity, club, sport or hobby that you did in high school that you’d like to continue with at Rowan?\n\nIn high school I participated in various clubs and activities. As I embark on my journey through Rowan, I want to try to be a part of the African Students Association (ASA). This will help me build relationships with other students being that I will be commuting rather than staying on campus.\n\nHow or why did you choose your major?\n\nI chose this major because I intend to have a pre-med track. Therefore, there are a wide range of majors that I could choose that have a correlation to biology or will prepare me for my future endeavors of applying into medical school. With this being said, after conducting research, I found that the biological sciences will define my focus on the type of biology I want to study and utilize later on down the road.\n\nWhy did you choose a university close to home?\n\nI chose a university close to home because I have a single mother who isn’t in such great health, so to be of assistance and have a peace of mind that I’ll be close enough anytime she may need it I chose a university closer to home. Financially too, a university closer to home is a better option that opens a way to work while studying.\n\nWhy Rowan?\n\nRowan has always been my top school to attend because it is well known to set up its students for future endeavors career wise and graduate education wise. This university is one that is also known to be really good in aspects of STEM and premed.\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nStory by:\n\nMelanie Sbaraglio, public relations and advertising graduate\n\n#PROFspective: Junior Physics Major Reinaldo Vázquez Jr.\n\nToday we feature Reinaldo Vázquez Jr., a junior Physics major and Mathematics minor from Paulsboro, NJ (Gloucester County) who has an off-campus rental.\n\nWhat clubs are you a part of on campus? I am the Vice President/Treasurer of Queer People of Color (QPOC).\n\nTell us about one club, organization, or group of friends that make you feel like Rowan is home. Queer People of Color, or QPOC, is a multicultural and LGBTQ+ support group on campus. I spent the last two semesters as Treasurer and Vice President with the goal of making QPOC a diverse community free of ignorance and judgment. I know every meeting that all of our members are going to feel safe expressing themselves and speaking what’s on their minds.\n\nCould you share a moment you’ve experienced in which you have felt that Rowan is a welcoming environment for you? When I came to Rowan almost two years ago, I was with a different major. I worked in the department, but it wasn’t a good fit for me. I felt disconnected and isolated, and I carried that feeling with me for my entire first semester anytime I entered the building. It wasn’t until I met my best friend, partner, and the President-to-be of QPOC, Jahnaya, at the start of the spring semester that I started to feel welcome at Rowan. Naya helped create an environment where I could feel comfortable, and proud, of who I am and does the same for everyone she meets.\n\nWhat’s your favorite thing about your typical Monday at Rowan? QPOC meetings were always the best way to unwind at the end of a long day. Since the meetings were on my “off day,” I would do homework all day and then spend a couple of hours catching up with everyone else.\n\nWhat is one thing about Rowan that was a happy surprise for you? As a native of South Jersey, I had the opportunity to see Rowan University as it grew over the years. I can remember when the Nexus Apartments were home to Glassboro residents and Holly Pointe Commons and Rowan Boulevard were still just expansion plans for a small-town college. I came to Rowan primarily out of convenience but I was pleasantly surprised to find that it is still growing every year, both in students and new projects like the one happening right now on 322. And despite this rapid growth, Rowan has managed to keep students closely engaged with campus life.\n\nDescribe for us an experience you’ve shared with a professor or staff member in which you felt like they truly cared about your wellbeing. My Physics professor Dr. Carol Guess is hands-down my favorite professor thus far. Whenever I needed help, whether it was for her class or just guidance during a difficult time, her office door was open. When I wanted to change my major from Engineering, it was thanks to her help in class that I knew Physics would be a better fit for me, and it was thanks to her guidance outside of class that I was able to make the change.\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nStory by:\n\nRachel Rumsby, freshman communication studies and public relations double major\n\nFuture Transfer\n\nTRANSFERmation Tuesday: Globe Trotter Molly Worek\n\nToday’s TRANSFERmation Tuesday features Molly Worek, a transfer from Bloomsburg University and Rowan College of Gloucester County (RCGC). Molly is a CADP English accelerated to master’s in teaching major.

She earned an associate degree in English from RCGC. Wrapping up her junior year, Molly lives at home in Mullica Hill, NJ (Gloucester County) and commutes to Rowan.\n\nCould you share with us one moment that made you feel inspired or confident that you’re in the right field for you?\n\nOne moment, among many, that made me feel inspired and confident that I was in the right field for me was when I realized that on more than one occasion I actually taught my professors something new. I realized that if I could teach my professor, I could teach anybody. It was a huge confidence boost. Inspiration drove my determination to teach someone, anyone, something new every day. If I could teach someone every day, intentionally or not, then I am a teacher not just in the classroom, but anywhere I go.\n\nWhat is the most interesting thing you’ve learned in your major this year?\n\nThe most interesting thing I have learned in my major this year is in Dr. Cindy Vitto’s course, Chaucer. There is not one thing I can specifically choose to be most interesting, as this course and its professor are simply amazing. (And yes, I have taken Dr. Vitto before, and will do so every chance I get!)\n\nWhy did you choose Rowan?\n\nI chose Rowan because it was only 10 minutes from home, has an excellent teaching program, offers Japanese, and has an equestrian team. Rowan was also an affordable option for me. I hope to graduate without any debt to enable me to move directly into my career overseas. My choice to transfer to Rowan has also enabled me to be inducted into several national and international honor societies related to my new major including the Golden Key Society, Pi Lambda Theta, Sigma Iota Rho, and Tau Sigma.\n\nWhat are you most looking forward to at Rowan next year?\n\nNext year at Rowan, I am most looking forward to my field hours teaching in schools: interacting with students, making lesson plans, learning from other teachers, and making a difference in the lives of those I influence. I am also looking forward to the possibility of studying abroad in Japan or Europe. My current goal is to teach English as a foreign or second language in Japan at the high school level! I plan to move to Japan in 2022 after graduation, and once there, I will consider obtaining my doctorate and teach at the university level.\n\nI also look forward to the fall season of the Equestrian Team as our spring season was cut short. Traveling to other universities and gaining points towards zones, regionals, and then nationals is incredibly exciting, and hard work! The hours we put in on top of our studies to fine tune our riding and participate in team activities is well worth it. Outside of Rowan, I look forward to representing my school, state, and nonprofit platform as Miss USA Petite New Jersey!\n\nLike what you see?\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nJunior Communication Studies Major: How I’m Gaining Lifelong Skills at Rowan\n\nToday we feature junior Communication Studies major and Journalism minor Christian A.

After the transfer, she commuted to Rowan University.\n\nPlease tell us about your favorite moment with a faculty member or a favorite experience in one of your classes. My favorite experience in one of my classes was when I realized there are other students just like me! I had just started the fall semester and I was pregnant. I was nervous people would not want to be friends with the “pregnant girl.” That was not the case at all! Everyone was so excited for me to have my son and always looked out for me. Interestingly enough, another student walked into the class, sat next me, and she was pregnant too! We were due five days apart and she ended up becoming one of my closest friends at Rowan! Love you Autumn and Halo!\n\nWhat was your favorite or most meaningful personal moment at Rowan? My most meaningful personal moment at Rowan was being chosen to speak at commencement. Even though I won’t be able to give my speech in person, Rowan made sure my speech was heard anyway. They featured my speech on the CSM [College of Science and Mathematics] and SPH [School of Health Professions] students’ awards and recognition page. It is such a nice feeling when others recognize the hard work and dedication you put into obtaining your degree.\n\nWhat are your career aspirations and how did the people or programs at Rowan help to support you with those aspirations? My career aspirations are to become an occupational therapist. Before I transferred to Rowan, I didn’t know anything about occupational therapy. I thought I wanted to become a physical therapist. After taking the course “Foundations of Human Performance in Clinical Settings,” I learned about occupational therapy and realized it was my dream career. I even completed a 400-hour internship shadowing a phenomenal occupational therapist, who taught me so much.\n\nDo you want to give a thank you shout out to your family, friends, advisors or mentors?\n\nMy mom and my Oma for always being my guardian angels, I love and miss you both more than words can describe.\n\nMy dad, for making sure I followed through with my promise to my mom and my Oma.\n\nMy boyfriend Isaiah for always pushing me to be the best mother to our son as well as best student possible.

Kimberly transferred to Rowan from Camden County College.\n\nWhat is your favorite moment with a faculty member or a favorite experience in one of your classes? My favorite moments are when I spent one-on-one time with my professors. It gave me the chance to ask questions that I didn’t feel comfortable asking in class. I’ve had some pretty amazing professors!\n\nWhat was your favorite or most meaningful personal moment at Rowan? I’m a full-time mom and live off campus, but a while back I had joined club swimming. I had left because it didn’t fit my schedule anymore. But while I was there, it was a great experience! It was great to get back into the sport and to meet some new people!\n\nWhat are your career aspirations and how did the people or programs at Rowan help to support you with those aspirations? My overall aspiration is to become an elementary teacher.

I would tutor students in reading and writing who were struggling. It was rewarding to see such progress from the students. They would come in struggling and by the time the semester was over they had made great strides. I wasn’t expecting my student to master every topic because it was a short time spent with each other. Knowing that I made a little difference was a great feeling! It was fun to come up with engaging lessons and activities to use. It was just a great way to practice what I have learned and a great feeling to help students.”\n\nWhat was your favorite or most meaningful personal moment at Rowan?\n\n“I have had many moments that had a significant meaning to me during my time at Rowan. One of my favorites was when I participated with the Early Childhood Club for the Haunted Student Center. This was where I really connected with a lot of club members and had a lot of fun! We transformed a classroom into a circus theme and children would walk through and have a chance to do different activities. It was nice to have an opportunity to do something for children and have a lot of fun with club members while doing it.”\n\nWhat are your career aspirations and how did the people or programs at Rowan help to support you with those aspirations?\n\n“I hope to be a kindergarten or first grade teacher. Rowan has given me many opportunities to go out into the field and interact with students and teachers. It was a great way to network and learn hands on. In teaching we can read and study, but you really get the full experience when you are in the classroom actually teaching and working with students.”\n\nShout outs:\n\n“I want to give a shout out to my mom, dad, and sister who have been there since day one. It has been a long ride, but they stuck by my side giving me support and encouragement when I needed it the most! I also want to give a shout out to Brandi White (the former Praxis Lab Coordinator) for helping me during this journey. She was always there as a mentor and friend! My group of friends all deserve a shout out too. They have experienced all the highs and lows of this journey with me too, so thanks for all your help! Lastly, my professors and advisor deserve recognition. They always wanted what was best for me and guided me in the right direction to get to this opportunity.

We learned in depth about the state elections and created online quizzes to help voters find ideal candidates to vote for. This class sparked the moment when I knew that Political Science was the right major for me.”\n\nWhat was your favorite or most meaningful personal moment at Rowan?\n\n“My favorite moment at Rowan was at transfer orientation when I made an abundance of new friendships with those of similar majors and goals as myself.”\n\nWhat are your career aspirations and how did the people or programs at Rowan help to support you with those aspirations?\n\n“With the encouraging words from many professors, I took my LSATS my junior year and am planning on attending law school in the fall of 2021.

She reflects on her time at Rowan and tells us some of her favorite experiences and where she’s headed to next!\n\nWhat are your career aspirations and how did the people or programs at Rowan help to support you with those aspirations?\n\n“I had some trouble when I first came to Rowan figuring out what I wanted to be. I started off as a Civil Engineering major, then I went into Music Education, and eventually Elementary Education and Liberal Studies. It took me a while, but through taking all of these different classes, I was able to realize my passion for education. I want to be an elementary school teacher and, one day, an administrator in a public school district.\n\nThe first professor who helped me realize this passion of mine was Dr. Adrian Barnes in my Music Education classes. He showed me a passion for education that I learned from and took with me in my future education classes and I will forever be grateful for his teachings. My other professors in my Education classes, such as Nancy Pagliughi, Arlene Stampa, and Gary Dentino, are who took that passion I had for teaching and shaped me into a real teacher. I will always remember their teachings when I have a classroom of my own. I would be remiss if I did not also mention my Writing Arts and English professors who helped me realize my talent for writing and showed me how to use that to make me into a better teacher. My professors Keri Mikulski, Dr. Jennifer Courtney, Amanda Haruch, and Dr. Yvonne Hammond, all saw my potential and shaped me into the writer and educator I am today. I have had so many amazing professors at Rowan that have given me knowledge and skills that I will be forever grateful for!”\n\nWhat was your favorite or most meaningful personal moment at Rowan?\n\n“My most meaningful moments at Rowan were when I was President of my sorority, Alpha Sigma Alpha. I met so many of my greatest friends there and almost every one of my good memories comes from them. Going to Greek Week, volunteering at the Special Olympics, and recruitment are just a few things that I will always remember and treasure from my time with ASA. My roommates, Rachael, Sara, and Nicole, were with me through three years of being at Rowan and they were the reason I called Rowan my home. Looking back at my time in college in the future, I know I will fondly remember the times I spent with them the most.”\n\nTell us about your favorite moment with a faculty member or a favorite experience in one of your classes:\n\n“One memory I have of my experience in the College of Education that I think I will always remember was being in Professor Gary Dentino’s class. Almost every single day, he would email us a whole letter telling us how proud he was of us and how we will change the world. He took the time out of his day to handwrite personal letters to us as a class almost daily. Even when my classes were getting tough and I felt like I was falling behind, I would read his daily email and feel like I truly had someone in my corner. His dedication to forming a positive and uplifting relationship with his students is something I hope to carry with me when I become a teacher someday.”\n\nShout outs:\n\n“I’d like to give a special shoutout to my best friends in the entire world: Sara Riegel, Nicole Traeger, and Rachael Kolmins. Thank you for always being there for me through it all. Another special shoutout to all of my ladies at Alpha Sigma Alpha, especially my big Rosie Nanfara and my little Emily Fishman.

My favorite social memory was becoming acquainted with all peers from Cross Country/Track and Field.

They have inspired me to impact others’ lives like they have impacted mine.\n\nWhy did you choose Rowan?\n\nI chose Rowan because many of my friends have graduated from Rowan and have only said good things, so I decided to apply. Rowan was the only school I had applied to, so it was all or nothing for me. Rowan also has a great education program and many graduates I know have become successful teachers.\n\nWhat are you most looking forward to at Rowan next year?\n\nI am really excited to start my student teaching next year.

Here, Jessica shares her favorite moments from Rowan and thanks those who helped her as she pursued her teaching education path.\n\nTell us about your favorite classroom experience.\n\nOne of my favorite experiences was in Dr. Viator’s Shakespeare class. The class was held in Winans Hall in a room with paper-thin walls, and the class next door was always loud. So one day he was not having it and decided to give them a taste of their own medicine. He shouted as loud as he could at the dividing wall to tell them to stop laughing. Ironically our class howled with laughter. Once we were all settled down Dr. Viator said, “You won’t remember anything from today’s lesson, but you’ll remember your crazy professor yelling at a wall.” And he was absolutely right.\n\nWhat was your favorite moment at Rowan?\n\nOne of my favorite personal moments at Rowan is when I would hang out with my friends after class in the pit or on the third floor of the student center. We would always say we would get together to do homework, but we would really just sit there and people watch, laughing way too loud and way too hard.\n\nWhat are your career aspirations? How did the people or programs at Rowan help to support you with those aspirations?\n\nMy career goal is to become a middle school English teacher to inspire students to learn. The professors and the staff members of The College of Education have supported me to do so. My professors have modeled excellent teaching strategies that I can use in my classroom and created learning environments that encourage and motivate me to do my best. The staff members of The College of Education have given me the guidance and support that I needed to succeed in my journey at Rowan University. Without them, I would not have the resources I need to have a successful future.\n\nDo you want to give a thank you shout out to your family, friends, advisors or mentors?\n\nI’d like to thank my mom, my dad, my sister, and my grandma. Thank you for all the love and support you have given me throughout my college career. Thank you for being there for me when I thought my best wasn’t good enough.
