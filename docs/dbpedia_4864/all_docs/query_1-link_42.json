The Flying Irishman was based on the life of aviator Douglas Corrigan, who, according the NYT review, was \"one of the world's worst fibbers...and one of the world's worst actors.\" According to modern sources, Corrigan was paid in excess of $100,000 for the rights to his autobiography.

Prior to his transatlantic crossing, Corrigan was reportedly warned by the government not to attempt the flight because his monoplane was thought to be unsafe.

Modern sources list Howard Tatt as the pilot of the camera airplane, and indicate that portions of the film were shot at Metropolitan Airport in Van Nuys, California, and at the Culver City Airport in Culver City, California.\n\nLess\n\nAs a crowd eagerly awaits the victorious return of flyer Douglas Corrigan from his transatlantic flight, a radio announcer recounts the story of the pilot's life: Inbued with a passion to fly, Doug has to overcome many adversities in order to obtain his goal.
