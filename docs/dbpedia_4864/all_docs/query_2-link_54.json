        "text": "Background Actor Copying Stooges\n\nNot necessarily a goof, but an interesting observation. In the scene where the Stooges are in the telegraph office sending a telegram to Mexico, the officer behind the desk begins immitating the Stooges as they chant \"Mexico Here We Come ... G-Yeah!\" even to the extent of turning his head from side-to-side in time with the boys dancing, and shouting the \"G-Yeah\" part along with them.\n\nChange in Position\n\nAt the very beginning of the episode, Curly twists his hat and there is a ratcheting sound effect. He turns the crease in his hat brim to the back when he does this, then all three enter the booking office. The very next scene shows Curly's hat with the brim crease in front again.\n\nInsidious Gag Setup\n\nThe boys are in Delores' hotel room ... when they come out of the closet the second time, Curly is NOT wearing his hat and can easily duck under the bed covers. When next Curly comes up out of the covers for a look around, his right jacket sleeve is pulled up to his elbow, making it believable for Jose to pluck his arm-hairs when he discovers that Delores is replaced under the covers by a man!\n\nMissing Scene?\n\nWhen the boys exit the bus in Mexico, a woman exits also. Curly turns to her and says, \"Ah, Delores ... lookin' for me?\" She then explains that her husband is very jealous, and thanks them for entertaining her on the \"strip\". The scene(s) of the boys getting to know Delores do not exist in the final film, leaving it to the viewer's imagination how she was entertained by the Stooges during the trip.\n\nStrange Music Choice\n\nIn the scene just after the announcer says, \"We hope you like them too many. Thank you.\", the band director is waiving his baton to a beat that is much faster than the included music track is playing.\n\nStunt Double\n\nThere is a noticeable stunt double for Curly when he crashes through the glass door.\n\nTripping on the Floor\n\nWhen Curly is running away from Jose in the bedroom scene, he accidentally trips over the blanket on the floor and almost falls down.\n\nHead-butting an animal\n\nThe third Stooge head-butts a bull or goat and knocking him out.\n\nAlso used in: EVEN AS IOU · SAPPY BULL FIGHTERS\n\nHolding hands under table or covers\n\nMoe and another Stooge hold hands under the table, thinking that they're holding hands with a woman sitting at the table. When Moe realizes that's not the woman's hand, he plucks a hair from the other Stooge's hand.\n\nAlso used in: YOU NAZTY SPY! · HALF-WITS HOLIDAY · DON'T THROW THAT KNIFE · PIES AND GUYS\n\nHow Much Would You Charge To Haunt A House?\n\nMoe: \"How much would you change to haunt a house?\" Stooge: \"How many rooms?\"\n\nAlso used in: I'M A MONKEY'S UNCLE · VAGABOND LOAFERS · SAPPY BULL FIGHTERS\n\nJealous Husband\n\nThe Stooges meet a woman in some sort of way and her husband thinks the Stooges are taking advantage of her, so he tries to kill the Stooges.\n\nAlso used in: IDLE ROOMERS · DON'T THROW THAT KNIFE · GENTS IN A JAM · GYPPED IN THE PENTHOUSE · FIFI BLOWS HER TOP · SAPPY BULL FIGHTERS\n\nOpening broken-through door\n\nThe glass to a door that the Stooges are about to run in or out of is broken. The first two Stooges run through the hole in the door, but the last Stooge foolishly opens the door and walks inside.\n\nAlso used in: MEN IN BLACK · IF A BODY MEETS A BODY\n\nYelling at the Stooges during phone conversation\n\nWhen someone is talking on a phone, he/she yells at the Stooges in the middle of the call and insults them, and the person on the other line thinks that he's the one being yelled at instead.\n\nAlso used in: ANTS IN THE PANTRY · NO DOUGH BOYS"
