She handles the silliness\n\nwonderfully (and she's not bad to look at either).\n\nI love watching those three girls do the dance number in \"Rhythm and\n\nWeep\". Man oh man!\n\nDorothy Granger is lovely in \"Punch Drunks\". And is that also her\n\nin \"Termites of 1938\" (\"Clayhammer!!\")?\n\nIn the Shemp shorts, I like Connie Cezan (I talked to her on the phone\n\nonce!).\n\n-----\n\nIs Connie still with us? I know Ann Doran is (and, sadly, Ms. Granger is not)\n\nJN\n\n\"The most contagious thing in the world is enthusiasm.\"\n\nYes that was Dorothy in \"Termites of 1938\". She appeared in 112 films,\n\nmostly as a bit character player. Some of them you will readily\n\nremember.\n\n1930 \"The Laurel and Hardy Murder Case\"\n\n1935 \"Naughty Marietta\" with Nelson Eddy and Jeanette McDonald\n\n1947 The Secret Life of Walter Mitty\" with Danny Kaye and Virginia\n\nMayo\n\n1948 The Paleface\" with Bob Hope and Jane Russell\n\nShe also played the wife of Leon Errol in a long running two reeler\n\nseries for RKO\n\nShe won a beauty contest at the age of 13 in Texas.\n\nHer last public appearance was in 1993 when the Screen Actors Guild\n\nhonored its character members who had been issued SAG cards when Sag\n\nwas founded sixty years ago.\n\nShe passed away in Los Angeles at the age of 82 of cancer in 1995\n\nShe was one of my favorites too, if you watch, you will see her as a\n\nbit player in lots of the old movies. I have been watching movies\n\nsince I was 8 and I am 65 now. Lots of memorable times.\n\nOn Sun, 30 May 1999 03:34:01 GMT, oblivion <obli...@nls.net> wrote:\n\n>There are so many gorgeous girls in the Stooges' shorts!
