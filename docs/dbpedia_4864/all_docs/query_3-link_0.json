        "text": "American actress (1906–1990)\n\nDorothy Appleby (January 6, 1906[citation needed] – August 9, 1990) was an American film actress. She appeared in over 50 films from 1931 to 1943.\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nAppleby gained early acting experience as an understudy and a chorus member in plays in New York City.[1] A newspaper article reported that Appleby \"came to New York fresh from winning a Maine beauty contest.\"[2]\n\nAppleby was seen in many supporting roles, almost always in short subjects or low-budget feature films.\n\nAppleby soon found steady work in Columbia Pictures' two-reel comedies. She appeared frequently with The Three Stooges. She worked with Columbia comics Andy Clyde, El Brendel, and Hugh Herbert, and she had an uncredited part in John Ford's Stagecoach.\n\nSome of Appleby's Stooge comedies were Loco Boy Makes Good, So Long Mr. Chumps, and In the Sweet Pie and Pie.[3] One memorable appearance was as Mexican brunette Rosita in 1940's Cookoo Cavaliers. In the film, Appleby gets clobbered by the Stooges when a facial \"mud pack\" made of concrete dries on her face. One of her later screen roles was a one-line bit (playing a college student at age 35) in the 1941 Jane Withers feature Small Town Deb.\n\nPersonal life and death\n\n[edit]\n\nIn October 1925, newspapers reported that Appleby had married Teddy Hayes, an athletic trainer.[4] Days later, however, Appleby contradicted that report. \"Honest Injun, I'm single,\" she said. \"Didn't mean it when I said I was married to Teddy Hayes.\"[5] On May 11, 1932, she was granted a divorce from actor Morgan H. Galloway.[6]\n\nDorothy Appleby died in Hicksville, New York on August 9, 1990, aged 84.[7]\n\nPartial filmography\n\n[edit]\n\nParadise for Two (1927) - Young girl (uncredited)\n\nNew York (1927) - Young girl (uncredited)\n\nSquare Crooks (1928) - Kay Ellison\n\nUnder Eighteen (1931) - Elsie\n\nTrick for Trick (1933) - Maisie Henry\n\nKing of the Wild Horses (1933) - Napeeta\n\nThe Prizefighter and the Lady (1933) - Woman in Bar (uncredited)\n\nAs the Earth Turns (1934) - Doris\n\nJail Birds of Paradise (1934, Short) - Miss Deering - Prison Warder\n\nSchool for Girls (1934) - Florence Burns\n\nI Give My Love (1934) - Alice Henley\n\nTwo Heads on a Pillow (1934) - Mitzie LaVerne\n\nFate's Fathead (1934, Short) - Dorothy Chase\n\nCharlie Chan in Paris (1935) - Nardi\n\nLet 'Em Have It (1935) - Lola\n\nRiffraff (1936) - Gertie\n\nLady of Secrets (1936) - Erma (uncredited)\n\nNorth of Nome (1936) - Ruby\n\nParadise Express (1937) - Kay Carson\n\nSea Racketeers (1937) - Dancer (uncredited)\n\nMake a Wish (1937) - Telephone Girl\n\nFit for a King (1937) - Waitress (uncredited)\n\nSmall Town Boy (1937) - Sandra French\n\nLive, Love and Learn (1937) - Lou - Bob's Model (uncredited)\n\nMaking the Headlines (1938) - Claire Sandford\n\nStagecoach (1939) - Girl in Saloon (uncredited)\n\nThe Flying Irishman (1939) - Maybelle - a Waitress (uncredited)\n\nWhen Tomorrow Comes (1939) - Waitress (uncredited)\n\nThe Women (1939) - Treatment Girl (uncredited)\n\nNothing But Pleasure (1940, Short) - Mrs. Plunkett\n\nConvicted Woman (1940) - Daisy\n\nRockin' Thru the Rockies (1940, Short) - Tessie\n\nPardon My Berth Marks (1940, Short) - Mary Christman\n\nThe Doctor Takes a Wife (1940) - Woman in Book Store (uncredited)\n\nGold Rush Maisie (1940) - Hatcheck Girl (uncredited)\n\nFrom Nurse to Worse (1940, Short) - Dr. Lerious' Receptionist (uncredited)\n\nThe Taming of the Snood (1940, Short) - Miss Wilson\n\nThe Spook Speaks (1940, Short) - Newlywed Wife\n\nThe Devil's Pipeline (1940) - Stewardess\n\nCookoo Cavaliers (1940, Short) - Rosita (uncredited)\n\nHigh Sierra (1941) - Margie - Joe's Girlfriend (uncredited)\n\nSo Long Mr. Chumps (1941, Short) - Pomeroy's Girlfriend (uncredited)\n\nManpower (1941) - Wilma\n\nIn the Sweet Pie and Pie (1941, Short) - Tiska Jones\n\nGeneral Nuisance (1941, Short) - Army nurse Dorothy\n\nHis Ex Marks the Spot (1941, Short) - Buster's second wife\n\nLoco Boy Makes Good (1942, Short) - Twitchell's Girl\n\nWhat's the Matador?
