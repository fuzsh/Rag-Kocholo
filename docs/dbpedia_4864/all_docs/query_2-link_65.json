        "text": "Last week, we posted on this blog 30 photos that the Library of Congress is attempting to ID. We were overjoyed by the response we got! Thank you to all! Now in our second (and last) post, we have here 30 additional photos also in need of a “solution.” As always, “clicking” on the thumbnail below will increase the photo in size. Please add your comments below and we will update this blog as the photos are positively ID’ed or quality suggestions come in. Many thanks!\n\nWe’ve had several guesses for this guy–Lawrence Gray, Grant Withers….? But, so far, nothing has stuck. Who do you think it is? SOLVED: Don Terry!\n\n2. We have several shots of this young lady but, sadly, no name to put with her face.\n\nSOLVED: Dancer and dance teacher Marianne Politte.\n\n3. We know this photo was taken by Katherine Russell Bleecker, the first female cinematographer in film history. Does anyone recognize the men in the picture or, if it is from a film what film?\n\n4. Well, these two are ice skaters and she’s dressed like a car. Hopefully that will assist everyone in finding out who–and what–they are.\n\nSOLVED!: From an “Ice Capades” show, “Motorama,” c. 1955. Thanks, Fred M.\n\n5. The code in the lower corner of his still says “SS: KOD,” perhaps the initials of the film it is from. Note also the large cake (?) aflame in the center of the photo.\n\nSOLVED!: “The Magic Garden of Stanley Sweetheart” (1970)–Thank you, Paul!\n\n6. The name of gentleman at his desk may never be learned but you never know, so we have posted it here.\n\nUPDATE: There is a certificate on the wall behind this gentleman from the Sesostris organization but we haven’t had any luck zooming in on it. And, when we reached out to the Sesostris group, they were not able to ID the man.\n\n7. Quite possibly a silent film actor or early stage star.\n\nSOLVED!: This is silent film director Charles Brabin.\n\n8. Due to the glasses on this guy we may never learn a name. But we will ask.\n\nSOLVED: Also Don Terry!\n\n9. This is a photo of a painting signed “Kepler.” Who is Kepler? And was this painting perhaps used in a film?\n\nSOLVED: This is a painting titled “Fixin’ Fences” by the PA Amish artist Luther F. Kepler, Jr.\n\n10. This man might be a character actor, a film exec or a business man. We don’t know…\n\n11. This is a pretty lady in a unique hat–but what is her name?\n\nSOLVED!: The lady with the feather in her hat is Cynthia Lynn. The late Ms. Lynn was best known for her role in “Hogan’s Heroes.”\n\n12. This lady took a tumble on her skis. Might it be Andrea Leeds (as has been suggested)?\n\n13. Yes, another somewhat odd photo that is–probably–not from a film. Still, does anyone recognize this women or, perhaps, the mural that is behind her?\n\nSOLVED!: This is artist Toni Truesdale, c. 1975, working on a mural she painted in Harrisburg, PA.\n\n14. We assume this woman is from New York based, obviously, on what she’s holding, but who she is is yet to be learned.\n\n15. This has been a “fun” one. On the back of the photo it appears someone has scribbled “Virginia” and it has a date on it, stamped, April 9, 1946. But we haven’t been able to figure out any more.\n\nSOLVED!: Former Powers Model Virginia H. Hopkins.\n\n16. Maybe this lady is an actress, a singer….?\n\n17. Could this be Edwina Booth? Jeannette Loff? Or neither?\n\n18. This might be a make-up how-to shot (note the 3D effect on her forehead). On the back is a stamp that reads “Ashley & Assoc.” plus a non-working NYC phone number.\n\n19. We don’t know the name of this gent either–is he behind the scenes talent or perhaps an author?\n\nSOLVED: This is the late film producer Larry Brezner.\n\n20. We wonder if this is the handsome actor Bill Cable, who played, among other roles, the handsome murder victim at the start of “Basic Instinct”?\n\nSOLVED!: Yes, this is indeed, the late Bill Cable.\n\n21. We aren’t sure that this is a “celebrity” at all but we thought we’d ask. It might just be a “stock shot” that made it into this collection. We are open to your thoughts.\n\n22. The background is Austria, but who is the woman in the foreground?\n\nSOLVED!: This Joan Vadeboncoeur, longtime entertainment reporter and film reviewer for the “Syracuse Post-Standard.”\n\n23. At first, we thought this was a proposed film set, but now we think it might have been a proposal for a new Cineplex. Does anybody recognize this from their home town?\n\nSOLVED!: This is a rendering of Pulsations nightclub in Glen Mills, PA.\n\n24. Left to right are Karyn Parsons, the artist formerly known as Terrence Trent D’Arby and then actress Lori Petty. But who is the woman on the end?\n\nSOLVED: The lady on the end is fashion designer Pamela Barish.\n\n25. We think this might be vaudeville star Stella Mayhew. What say you?\n\nSOLVED!: This is silent film actress Nina Romano.\n\n26. We don’t know either of these men standing in front of the plane.\n\nSOLVED (PARTIALLY): The man on the left is conductor Frederick Prausnitz. We don’t know the man next to him…yet.\n\n27. We believe the actor on the right is Bob Custer, silent Western star. Who is the actress next to him?\n\nSOLVED: This is from the 1924 film “Flashing Spurs.”\n\n28. We don’t know who this studious looking man is either.\n\nSOLVED!: Fred Foy, long-time narrator for “The Lone Ranger” and other radio series.\n\n29. The man on the far left is actor Howard De Silva. We don’t know the names of the other two men with him. (There is a date on the back of this photo: Jan. 19, 1973 and a stamps that reads “SHERLOCK,” perhaps the photographer.)\n\n30. Is the man behind the camera Ben Maddow….?\n\nTo see the “mystery photos” we posted last month–many still waiting “solutions”–see the link below:"
