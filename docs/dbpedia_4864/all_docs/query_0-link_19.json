        "text": "OK, this is a funny coincidence. Not a week ago I was poking around in the Shorpy archive and looked at this picture of the New Jersey boardwalk in 1905, marveling at the crowd (and all the dead people): https://www.shorpy.com/node/8294\n\nNow, down in the corner, there was a little sign that said, \"A Sensation! ELSIE JANIS, the World's Greatest Imitator!\" So I did a little Google search on her, and she turned out to be quite an interesting character (look her up!), who'd been just starting out in 1905 at 16 years old. Just another day on Shorpy, finding interesting little details and people who lived long ago.\n\nSo today I look up Puzzles of 1925, and who pops up as the author of the book, and the director of the Broadway play, 20 years later? Elsie Janis! https://www.ibdb.com/Production/View/8952\n\nElsie is clearly stalking me. \"Always Something Interesting\" here at Shorpy.\n\nThere's some funky stuff in the background !\n\nThe bench is a joiner's or carpenter's bench with a face vise on the left and a tail vise on the right. Such a bench would be appropriate in either a sign shop or a theatrical prop workshop.\n\nWay over on the left are two empty liquor bottles and an electric hotplate. The hotplate might be there to warm old-fashioned hot hide glue which was used for woodworking in those days.\n\nWhat do you make of the partially-readable labels on the cans on the bench ?\n\nAh, Bohemia. I love this woman's free spirit: allowing herself to be photographed topless and showing a \"wicked knee\". Did she answer an ad in the paper or do these two have some extracurricular connection? Commercial sign painting, theatrical, unfortunate racism on prominent display. Is she a showgirl? Is to be part of a coming attraction? The exuberance of the age and flaming youth speaks in so many details, not the least of which the SHAG carpet. It's good to see people with a sense of fun."
