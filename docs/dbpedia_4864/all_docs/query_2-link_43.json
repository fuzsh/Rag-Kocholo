        "text": "Close Quarters is Michael Gilbert’s (1912 – 2006) first novel. It is also the first in his Inspector Hazlerigg series. I have never read anything by Gilbert before, but I do intend to read other novels by him. This novel was a strange thing. I felt like it was set-up to be a perfectly familiar “golden age” mystery placed in a typical English Cathedral setting. There is a campus, which is locked at night, a bunch of quirky intellectual canons and vergers, and associated gardeners. The dean of the whole place is fairly decent at being the dean, the reader supposes, but not too excellent at knowing how to deal with attempted murder and the like. The dean calls his nephew hoping for an unofficial, but still police-involved, assistance.\n\nNaturally, I was anticipating a bland and fairly technical police procedural set in Melchester Cathedral Close. I am hardly an expert on the United Kingdom, but I feel like Melchester is fictional – but it might be an homage, of sorts, to Thomas Hardy? In any case, I think this novel contains at least three maps of the place. The story takes place in 1937 and while folks that know their history would expect some impingement of world events upon the story, there is none.\n\nThe novel has a lot – extreme? – amount of technical details. Probably, there is too much technical “investigation” than a decent mystery novel should have. The exact placement at the exact time of so many characters is exceedingly tedious and aggravating. Does it all work out? Did Gilbert (or his detectives) get it right or are there unintentional errors? I do not know because, honestly, though I followed along as best I could, if I lost the thread of who-was-where-when, I did not go back and try to gain the data. Thinking about it, though all of this plays absolute importance in the deduction, it just is not gripping enough to drag a reader through all of it. I will say, however, that if Gilbert did plot all of this out – he really is impressive. I would love to see his notes when he was writing this storyline.\n\nDid I mention at the start of the book there is a bit of an index listing the dramatis personae of the novel – the Householders of Melchester Close. I called it an index, because it is not a list. Each character is given a rather significant amount of detail – even if it plays zero rôle in the story. For example:\n\nThe Rev. Canon Trumpington – B.A. Late scholar of Wadham College, Oxford. B.A. (2nd Class Lit. Hum). 1900. Principal of Melset Theological College, Canon of Melchester, Unmarried.\n\nC. S. Mickie, Mus.Doc., F.R.C.O. – Organist and Choirmaster of Melchester. Until 1930 assistant organist, Starminster. Married. No children.\n\nThere are seventeen characters listed in this fashion.\n\nAnd there is also a crossword puzzle. Yes, the reader gets to solve it with two of the canons – each clue, puzzled out and agonized over. This does provide a major part of the storyline, but my word, I feel like this novel is less for entertainment and more for working the reader a bit. Chapter Thirteen is entitled “Crossword Puzzle” and it has 31 clues – I suppose the reader could try it out, first, on their own, before following the guesses made by the canons, but by this point, I think most readers are worn out.\n\nThere is a lot of deciding the times and places of the characters. In fact, that is the majority of the novel. So, when the first red herring comes upon the reader, he feels like he certainly is at the end of the matter and the Scotland Yard chaps are about to solve the situation. But wait! What are all these pages left to still be read? Well, because even if we have a red herring and more eliminations of suspects and theories – we never really looked into motive! So, it feels like we are constantly having to start over, remind ourselves where everyone was at what time, and now also think of motives. Meanwhile, the little interferences and spats between the canons and members of the Close are pulling the detectives, and reader, this way and that with their un/helpfulness.\n\nThe only work slightly comparable is definitely Michael Innes’ Death at the President’s Lodging. In fact, there are a lot of bits that really do feel like these works are very close. Closer than they ought to be? Who can say. Definitely Gilbert’s is a lot more rigorous, I think. Or maybe I just feel dragged through the mud. Needless to say, the Dean’s nephew calls in Inspector Hazlerigg, who really does not have much of a personality. I get the idea that he is a larger, athletic fellow. However, he does not really do much to distinguish himself in this novel – besides being the authority of the Yard.\n\nThere is a lot of coming and going to Evensong. There is a choir and they are dressing for sessions and then disrobing afterward. There are tea times and there are flower beds. The detectives are going to have a smoke and pull out their papers and go over the case – again.\n\nIs there wit? Yes, there are some briefly funny moments. It is not all serious Churchmen and Yard work. Unfortunately, the wit is forgotten already. I couldn’t come up with any examples of the humor even though I only finished the novel yesterday. I think that the humor is sunk by the massive amount of work Gilbert puts in with the timing of the circumstances.\n\nOverall, this is a good read. It is not a story that all readers will enjoy. There is too much detail work, maybe there are just too many characters? Sure, Golden Age mystery readers should read it. They should also expect to keep notes about the characters, I guess. The author certainly did a lot of work here – he must have painstakingly clarified every detail – every minute of his many characters. However, as a novel, this sort of detail is not always very entertaining.\n\n3 stars\n\nHoly Disorders by Edmund Crispin was first published in 1945. It is the second in his Gervase Fen murder mysteries. I read it a few days ago and I am giving it five stars. I really enjoyed this one, but I recognize that not every reader will tolerate it. Crispin (Robert Bruce Montgomery) was a heckuva writer. Allegedly he ran toward a rather bad end full of alcohol and ruined friendships. As an author, though, he produced at least two (I have read two so far!) excellent mysteries.\n\nThe novel has a really long setup – it seems the first three chapters are really out of place and the reader is stuck wondering where all of this is going. I have no doubt that the engaged reader will keep reading, though, because there is so much hilarity over a certain prop and the personalities of the characters that even if these chapters seem far from the expected novel, they are highly entertaining. We meet Geoffrey Vinter, who has received a telegram from Gervase Fen and is complying with the request to come to Tolnbridge. The reader assumes that Vinter must be in the employ of Fen – or be a very good friend of his, to say the least. And while the latter might be true – it certainly does not feel that way. Vinter puts up with so much difficulty on Fen’s part. Yet, there is clearly a respect and a fondness there because when Fen runs deep into danger, Vinter is nearly wild with panic to save Fen.\n\nI am going to be bluntly honest, at points I was a little tiny bit chagrined because well, I can recognize myself in some of Fen’s quirks. The cow mask? and the mooing? Yeah, all me. Fighting with a paper map while walking? Yep, me too. Occasional churlish and childish behavior about things? Maybe me. Oh, not quite as (I hope) blatantly as Fen’s attitude, but I do display a measure of impatience at times. So, anytime Fen acted out in the novel, I felt that simultaneous: oh! a kindred spirit and oh! the sting of: shucks, my people put up with a lot from me.\n\nThere are literally two points in the novel where I knew what Fen was about to say because I really, really would have said the same thing. The amusing part is that these are not the parts referring to the case or some brilliant deduction – they are the minor parts wherein Fen is being very Fen. For example in chapter nine when the Inspector is discussing the case and he says: “She’s about as likely to know anything about the murder as you are to have climbed Mount Everest.” Without missing a beat, Fen: “I have climbed Mount Everest.” I laughed out loud because this is exactly the ridiculous thing I torture my people with. Shame on me. It happens again in chapter thirteen, when Fen is able to speak after a certain experience and the first thing he says is a comment on his immunity – which is absolutely preposterous and obnoxious. Yet, I am really sure I hear myself saying this, too.\n\nI have to give all the credit and praise to my friends and family – for yes, while I am in the middle of combat and loudly quoting Kant, I know my loyal people have my back – even when they probably want to throttle me. (I do usually save the day, though.) I could ask any of them for a butterfly net.\n\nAnyway, one of the best features of the novel is how Crispin delightfully breaks the third wall now and again – its sudden and funny and not belabored at all. I did not mark down the number of times this happens, but each time it was witty and smooth and got a deserved chuckle. Also, Crispin pokes fun at the “traditional Golden Age mystery” a few times – especially the bit (which you can practically hear Inspector Japp muttering about) of cigarette ash and footprints. All of this keeps the reader on their toes and engaged with the story. The fact that these little moments are done effortlessly is really what makes them fun.\n\nNow, this is rather in contrast to the second half of chapter eight. Chapter eight has to be one of the funniest chapters I have read in a novel in a very long time. The whole thing only works if the reader is quite familiar with Edgar Allan Poe’s The Raven (1845). What makes the whole chapter work is that Crispin balances the visit of Vinter and Fen to Garbin’s house – and making progress in the case – with the endless allusions to The Raven that are, indeed, ridiculous and absurd, but absolutely funny. I will share that the entire thing is quite amusing – but I think my favorite part is when Lenore is mentioned and:\n\n“Who?” The word burst from Geoffrey before he could stop himself. -pg 146\n\nOf course, the entire scene has to be built long before we trample into Garbin’s house. The personality of Garbin is developed carefully so that in chapter eight he can portray the straight-faced, stern, humorless foil to everything happening in the scene. Crispin manages this by making Garbin and Spitshuker the ever-arguing, best friends that carry on the eternal arguments that transcend any mysteries or novels and seeming like someone is always debating (usually far less civilly). Garbin is necessary to the novel, because he is just the right balance for a lot of the other characters.\n\nNow, the crimes and the villains are really quite disturbing. Crispin inserts a whole lot of hilarity and absurdity into the novel but I will not hide the fact that there are Black Masses and Nazis about. And maltreatment of a 15 year old girl. So, there is a reason Crispin surrounded some of this in such a level of entertaining amusements: the criminals and crimes are actually a bit darker and nastier than one would expect in a country-whodunit. There are the correct number of red herrings to keep the reader (and other characters) guessing as Fen gets impatient with everything. Also, I am thrilled that at the end, Crispin has Fen explain a tiny detail that while obvious, just shows that as an author he really did a thorough job setting up the steps to solving the crimes.\n\nYet another fun incidental: there is a character in the book that we are very repeatedly told is carrying around a certain book. I am not sure if people, nowadays, know what this is about, but Crispin is making a little savvy/sarcastic point about the storyline – if you know anything about the Vilfredo Pareto work being mentioned. And continuing the little “Easter egg” and name-dropping business, Crispin allows Fen to flip out and howl when the Inspector tells him the Yard is coming down to handle the case. Fen wails about “Appleby” – whom we all know from Michael Innes (1906 – 1994) and his detective series starring Sir John Appleby.\n\nI really enjoyed reading this. I do like novels when there are homages, hidden “clues,” and sleight-of-hand by the authors. I like when the author is able to display his wit, balance many threads, show off his intellectual knowledge, and yet thoroughly amuse the reader. I think this is a fantastic example of writing and the story is engaging. Any Golden Age Mystery fan should read this, certainly. However, for readers who do not care for the third wall breaks, the allusions, and a bit of ridiculous – this novel may lose some of its charm. I cannot imagine anyone reading this and really disliking it, though. As Fen said: “The motive…… was obvious from the start — as was the whole of this business,” he added with some vehemence, “to anyone with even a speck of brain.” – pg 256\n\n5 stars\n\nThe last quarter of this year has been very hectic and has involved a lot of travel. The travel has also had me in places lasting even two weeks at a time. Traveling ruins my concentration and focus for more scholarly activities. That also includes basic novel reading. There were a few minutes to spare very early in December and I was able to finish Margery Allingham’s Look to the Lady. This was first published in 1931 and is the third in the Albert Campion series. I read the Felony & Mayhem edition from 2006.\n\nThis is an example of a novel that the reader really wants to love, but it has so many problems it is nearly incoherent. However, and this is key, even through the incoherence, there is a lot to enjoy in the novel. That being said, I can only give this one two stars.\n\nI am, like so many readers, amused by Campion. The character is very annoying sometimes – babbling and hiding secrets and generally just seeming very loopy. However, there is a lot to like in his sarcastic, weird mental-association rambling. And his backstory, which the reader only has gotten hints of so far, is very curious and gives Campion a bit of depth.\n\nThe first three chapters are ridiculous. I suspect the author wanted a thrilling and action/suspense packed beginning. The start of the novel is that, but it is also random and stupid. Saying that the series of events is unlikely is putting it mildly because at some points, its outlandish. I feel like these three chapters could be re-written to better carry certain plot threads and remove some of the absurdity. The previous Campion novel was quite an adventurous romp – so that is what I have come to expect from these novels. However, the opening of this novel is too much to ask of a reader, I think.\n\nAnyway, there are several difficult and unpleasant women in this novel. Each of them plays a role in the novel and I think that the reason the novel is so heavily involved with these characters is that by presenting so many, the author hopes that the reader will not focus on just one. So, in other words, if there was only one nefarious woman, the reader would immediately suspect and circle that character as the villain or antagonist. If there are three or more very uncommon women, the reader may just assume all the women characters are batty. Its a method of hiding like with like. I am harping on this a bit because considering this – Allingham has a decent idea to use this methodology. Let us face facts: contemporary fiction could use more strategically-minded mystery authors.\n\nChapters ten, eleven, and twelve are a lot of fun because there is a “shell game” of misdirection, danger, illusion, and car chases. The young people of the storyline are all blasting down the road and the mysterious valuable prop of the whole novel (Gyrth Chalice) is on the move. Campion is at his best in these scenes, I think, and is very much the dashing and inscrutable hero. Allingham does a good job of holding the plot and building action scenes.\n\nHowever, Lady Pethwick and the storyline involving her is meant to grab the reader’s attention and cause them to feel this is where the majority of the storyline is contained. Spoilers be damned, it really is not, and I found Lady Pethwick to be exceedingly annoying. This thread gets larger and then people are engaging gypsies and local peasants and wandering around in the middle of the night looking for monsters. This, of course, results in more drama and tales of witches and mentally-disturbed people. The neighbors are involved – and of course they are just the people who are needed in this (whatever this is) situation. This whole thread is really wide and takes over a lot of the novel. I found most of it to be pointless other than to give the reader a really thorough background on the countryside and community. Novel-wise, the author has now built in characters that are shady, suspect, and even gross at points. However, there is no motive! None of these characters seem to have anything to do with the plot.\n\nThroughout the novel, from the earliest chapters, there is a sense of a huge international crime ring that is very powerful and moves via hidden hands and slippery agendas. Hints, names, suggestions, but nothing ever comes of it. Again, this is not a bad strategy for an author wanting to continue a series of mystery-adventure novels. The unnamed, but powerful villainous organization will likely be seen again and again.\n\nChapters twenty-five through twenty-seven wrap up the novel nicely – the culmination of the villain’s efforts, a strange and (honestly, it got me a bit) unsettling Gothic moment. Now, when I say that the novel is wrapped up nicely, I specifically mean the prop is “all’s well that ends well.” The villains are dead or fade into the recesses of their amorphous existence. Naturally, there are a few pangs of heart strings for Campion, for Penelope, and for the Gypsy group. Other than that, at the end, it feels like the reader spent a lot of time with a lot of scenes and characters that were not all that relevant or valuable to the story.\n\nThis does not mean that there are not enjoyable moments. But there is a layer of dissatisfaction after reading this. As if, I suppose, there were a lot more threads, misdirections, and random items than there ever needed to be. Vintage mystery readers probably ought to read this because the tiny little Gothic twist at the end is probably worth the whole book. At least, I am still able to wonder about this scene – which means that there is something imaginative and captivating, even if silly, about the matter.\n\n2 stars\n\np.s. Here is a little something that I saw that lives (currently) in West Chester, Penna. I snapped a pic with my cell phone; the book is in a glass case – and no, I did not ask the price.\n\nIt is difficult, I think, to write reviews of Agatha Christie novels. The most significant reason being that since they are so amazingly popular and well-known that there is not a whole lot left to “review” in 2023. Another reason is that much of these little novels is entwined in plot twists, red herrings, or key plot elements so that it could be easy to spoil the read for another reader. Beyond that, there are all the TV adaptations etc. that also color the contemporary reader’s image of Poirot and his author. It can be a bit sticky to try and separate some of these ideas out because they are just sort of homegrown things that do influence, rightly or wrongly, the actual reaction to the novel.\n\nThirteen at Dinner is the U.S.A. title for the 1933 novel Lord Edgware Dies. It is the eighth or ninth Poirot novel; I read the Dell 1969 edition. I am finally getting around to making my way through Christie’s novels. Its easier reading than Walter Burkert and Rene Wellek – the other things I am currently reading. I mention this to explain that I read Thirteen at Dinner mainly at night before bedtime just to wind down and read something entertaining. In this novel, Poirot is exceptionally patient and circumspect in his investigation. His calmness is opposite Inspector Japp’s activities, which entail chasing all over the place after every clue and trail. Throughout, Poirot’s reticence to do much more than ponder and have dinner really aggravates Captain Hastings. In this novel, in fact, it seems Hastings has quite a bit of animosity and frustration with the main character. Several times Hastings asserts that he is very fond of Poirot, but in his narrative asides, Hastings shares much of his impatience and annoyance.\n\nAnd Poirot replied with a smile, “Alas! Not the cigarette ash – nor the footprint – nor a lady’s glove – nor even a lingering perfume! Nothing that the detective of fiction so conveniently finds.”\n\n“The police are always made out to be as blind as bats in detective stories,” said Japp with a grin. — pg. 64, chapter 7\n\nOne of the things that I think was done well in this novel were the characterizations. By this I mean that Christie makes fairly interesting and insightful analyses of her characters – via the observations of Poirot et al. So, her characters seem realistic and have believable attitudes and personalities. The characters are a cross-section sampling of what Christie probably saw around her in London. Its not always flattering, its not always a judgment. It is keen observation and it allows for all the technical matters of a mystery novel to have their place. For example, the characters have idiosyncrasies that would lend themselves toward red herrings, motives, and plot twists.\n\nChapter 25 is probably the best chapter in the book. There is a dinner party. There is a reference to the “judgment of Paris.” I cannot tell you how amusingly coincidentally apropos this little segment is to my observations – I felt a lot like Hastings in this scene because recently I have seen and cringed at similar gauche gaffe situations. Needless to say, I am now mentally using “judgment of Paris” as a sort of half-serious litmus test in my social interactions. Anyway, Christie nails this scene perfectly and with an economy of words and with heightened insights. It is an excellent sample of writing – describing a scene perfectly.\n\nThe story itself is not one that I felt very intrigued by. Largely, it involves the relationships of a well-known, beautiful actress. In fact, the novel is, at points, quite a bit less of a detective mystery and more of a character study of this particular character. The character is self-centered, mercenary, but also utterly oblivious to their own flaws. If readers really consider this character, it is shocking and upsetting because also believable. And it is difficult to watch how right to the last this character exactly unable to engage their conscience. But I do not really care to read about marriages and actresses. So, the storyline generally was never going to pull me to the edge of my seat. I think it is a good read, nevertheless.\n\nIn fact, I encourage all readers to read this novel. It is a short novel, very available and well-known. It would not be an imposition on any tbr list to read this one. My reasons for recommending it are several, the characterization as I have mentioned, of course being one reason. Beyond that, I feel like many, many authors have copied, imitated, and borrowed some of the moments and ideas in this story. Its good to see some of the original presentation of these tropes and/or scenes. While I give this one a sort of middling score, that is more of a sign of my personal preference than Christie’s skills.\n\n3 stars\n\nStrong Poison is the fifth novel by Dorothy L. Sayers (1893 – 1957). It was first published in 1930 and I have read the previous in the Lord Peter Wimsey series. After the rather unhappy undercurrent that ran through The Unpleasantness at the Bellona Club, this novel is something of its opposite. There is a great deal of humor, fun, capers, and silliness. Frankly, it is the most fun of the Lord Peter mysteries so far.\n\nDorothy L. Sayers is a bit of an odd author for me to come to terms with. By that I mean it always seems that I am unsure where to place her works and/or situate her sphere as an author-audience circle. I have never met her and I have never met anyone who has. Based on nothing more than her various writings, I feel she would not have struck me as a nice person (yes, that is rather a vague phrase, too). I do not know that I would have liked her. However, I think she was a very intelligent person. You definitely want her at your supper party. I think she is an excellent writer – but her novels are never as good as they should be. Or as good as we want them to be. Most of the time, I feel like complaining that she should have written more (and by ‘more’ I mean much more) in the fiction realm than the detective novels. Sayers tended toward a version of agenda fiction, which does not always thrill me, but I can understand its usage. Further, and more than any other aspect of her writing, I get the overwhelming feeling with all of her novels that she is just doing a writing exercise. She is experimenting with the novel. In some atypical way, I want to call her an experimental writer. It is not overt and obvious like most “experimental fiction.” It is just a feeling that Sayers is trying something out or testing something.\n\nHey – she’s good; I think she could outwrite a heckuva lot of authors, vintage and contemporary.\n\nIt is because I get the sense of her being a great author that I want great books from her. Now, Strong Poison is an immense amount of fun and is quite interesting. Strong Poison is not a magnificent classic of literature, though. Without a doubt this is a four-star rating detective novel. The genre allows for it to have moments wherein its unrealistic, silly, and campy. Sometimes detective fiction authors (and this happens in science fiction as well) do it to themselves. They purposely, knowingly, make their works amusing and for a general readership. Unfortunately, that also immediately seems to make the literary critic feel these genres are somehow “lesser.” Its a sticky and ugly perspective that has tiny elements of truth on both sides. Is Sayers a hack? Is she just a large measure smarter than most hack writers and therefore able to convince us she’s not a hack? Personally, I think she is a great writer, but sadly she never wrote us that great book that would prove it indubitably to the galaxy.\n\nWell, Strong Poison really has its genesis in Sayer’s own life, a writer named John Cournos (1881 – 1966) had some form of relationship with Sayers and she utilized this relationship in Strong Poison in the form of the character Philip Boyes. It is not a flattering character that she wrote, but it is, probably, realistic. This character dies and the main suspect is Harriet Vane. Lord Peter falls in love with Vane and the book is about Peter’s efforts to prove Vane’s innocence of Boyes’ demise. It is notable that the novel’s hero, Lord Peter, several times has some strong language about Boyes. I think there is more in this novel that is autobiographical than a reader would immediately think. Definitely scenes are pulled from Sayer’s own experiences.\n\nThe reader spends time attending the Vane trial and in following Peter around as he struggles to get evidence to clear Vane. A fact that happens, eventually, in all detective novels – the detective cannot do the job alone. Even with Lord Peter’s vast monetary resources and education he cannot solve this on his own. He has to pay and rely on the legwork and wits of people in his employ. And he does – and these people do come through for him – and it is quite an amusing tale as it plays out. But there is that nagging disappointment in the reader’s mind that realizes that Lord Peter cannot solve the crime.\n\nHere in 2023 it is difficult to read these novels because our forensics technology has advanced so much. Plus, all of the “evidence” gotten in this story is gotten through nefarious and illegitimate means, anyway. None of this would be permissible in a court case. Lord Peter’s irregulars get the job done and these capers are really quite priceless and entertaining, but the realism is utterly lost. A reader in 2023 cannot help but notice this and be disappointed.\n\nIn this novel Lord Peter is very Lord Peter. It is like Sayers felt the heaviness and sorrow in the previous novel and gave Wimsey a shot of caffeine in this novel. Boy, his quips and banter are on extra high throughout.\n\n“If anybody ever marries you, it will be for the pleasure of hearing you talk piffle,” said Harriet, severely. – pg. 123, chapter 11.\n\nBut we do get to visit the Denver home or whatever it would be referred to as. We meet up with Gerald, Duke of Denver and some friends and family because it is Christmastime and they are gathered together. Peter navigates the uncomfortable, but oddly familiar scene of “conversation” with the elders in which they feel they can opine on any topic. He escapes to the stables at one point, running into his brother and brother’s friend.\n\n“I wish nobody had ever invented tea. Ruins your nerves and spoils your appetite for dinner.”\n\n“Same here,” said Wimsey, promptly. “I’m feelin’ rather exhausted with conversation. Let’s wander through the billiard-room and build our constitutions up before we face the barrage.” – pg. 130, chapter 12\n\nEven if one finds Lord Peter annoying, the various scenarios that Sayers writes are always so relatable. Spoiled, annoying Lord Peter still resonates with the reader because he seems to always fit in and interact delightfully with people no matter the time or place or society.\n\nAnyway, the case is broken by efforts of a loveable Miss Murchison who cracks the safe in her employer’s office. Of course, her gaining these locksmithing skills is due to Lord Peter introducing her to his acquaintance, Bill Rumm. Bill is a caricature of those reformed criminals who turn to any form of religion with zest and zeal, but still keep that crooked side available for use as needed. Rumm gives Murchison an instructional in how to open locks. Its a quite funny scene in the novel – one I think most readers would get a kick out of and would be perfectly amusing as a TV/film episode. Proud of his skills, reformed or not, Bill says:\n\n“If?” grunted Bill, with sovereign contempt. ” ‘ Course I can! Deed-box, that’s nuffin’. That ain’t no field for a man’s skill. Robbin’ the kids’ money-box, that’s what it is with they trumpery little locks. There ain’t a deed-box in this ‘ere city wot I couldn’t open blindfold in boxing-gloves with a sick of boiled macaroni.” – pg. 145, chapter 13\n\nThere is another character that helps the case, Miss Climpson, but I would never dare to spoil those scenes. Absolutely riotous and hysterical scenes that come with a dose of criticism for the “new age spiritualist” shenanigans that Sayers must have come across here and there.\n\nAnyway, I also want to share that the copy I read is a hardback Harper & Row edition. My copy is ex libris the US Naval Base Library in Charleston, SC. The last date stamped on the card in the back of the book (um, if you’re too young to know about this……. Wikipedia might help?) is 15 FEB 1994. From other markings, the book was acquired by the Naval Station for $4.95 in October of 1969.\n\nI am very glad that I read this novel, it has some wonderfully amusing scenes in it and it has some unique problems for the detective to overcome about the crime itself. In many ways, it is also somewhat of a character study, a passing study of various subcultures in society, and a bit of trickery and fun. Overall, vintage mystery fans need to read it. Other readers may enjoy it, but it has its flaws and does not really age well in terms of actual crime-solving. Still, those folks who can stand Lord Peter’s piffle will appreciate the time spent with him and his irregulars.\n\n4 stars\n\nMystery Mile by Margery Allingham (1904 – 1966) was first published in 1930. It is the second in the Albert Campion series; I read the first back in 2015 and did not really care for it. Mystery Mile, however, is the first novel in which the character Albert Campion actually stars having the main rôle. Anywhere online where I saw anything about “Albert Campion,” I saw mention of how the character is a parody of or very similar to Lord Peter Wimsey of Dorothy L. Sayers’ work. I feel like this is some sort of literary-world mantra that has been repeated so much that most readers accept it as fact. In my reading, I can see how readers might draw that conclusion, but at the same time, I do not think the connection is all that strong. Campion is made to produce a lot of chatter, some of it learned, most of it just free-association. It annoys his fellow characters more than it annoys the reader, truthfully. The Wimsey character can keep up a similar monologue, but his is somehow both more intelligent and more forlorn. So, Allingham might have taken a certain tidbit from Sayers and spun it a little differently. I doubt Wimsey is the only source; I seem to recall Sherlock et al. having a bit of – seemingly – irreverent chatter.\n\nOf the bunch of Golden Age mysteries and detective yarns that I have read, Allingham’s are the least serious. These are not quite the usual leisurely detecting that, say, are parodied in Leo Bruce’s novels. You know the ones – the murder happens, usually in a country manor home, and all the suspects sit around having brandy while the detective plays at various intellectual exercises. These are also not the sort of heavy, serious stories that feel like the fate of the world is directly waiting the conclusion of the case. These are romps, a word I do not use often. These are 1930s action/adventure mysteries. Indeed, and I am going to go out on a limb here, they are entertaining and fun.\n\nNow, the amount of fun and entertainment mileage a reader gets from a novel like this will vary. The story itself is fairly well-written, no one will accuse Allingham of being a lazy writer or a writer that did not have a grasp of plot, setting, characters, etc. However, at times it seems a bit overwritten. At times, especially, in this particular novel, it seems the author focused too much on the main character and made the rest of the characters run around like panting obedient dogs behind him. Do not get me wrong, though, this novel does introduce us to a number of definitely interesting characters who stand on their own. We meet Campion’s manservant/houseman, Magersfontein Lugg. And Lugg’s associate Thos. T Knapp. The segments of the story involving this latter character light up because Knapp is such a colorful and lively creature. The scenes with his mother and their little apartment are also rather priceless. Knapp’s character does play on some of those archetypes and Allingham pulls in those elements with skill. Specifically, things like his accent, his skill set, his physical movements, etc.\n\nStill, some of the other characters, though independent and not cardboard placeholders when taken on their own, seem unable to do otherwise than follow and obey the main character. They never really develop or show any particular insights or dynamic other than what their face value has already presented to the reader. These characters, though likeable in their own way, make for some tediousness.\n\nMy main complaint about this novel is a singular plot point. I feel like left alone, most of the plot is organized and reasonable. However, there is one piece that were it not so, would utterly collapse the entire book. So, it has to do with the early night in which guests arrive and a certain character, Anthony Datchett arrives – uninvited. The housemaid, Cuddy, lets him in and hands his card to the lady of the house. The rest of the household should, at this point, knowing full-well why all of them are gathered the heck out on this swamp, misty peninsula, punt this guy right back out into the night. Literally, why he is allowed entrance to the room, much less the house and why he is allowed to engage with the guests is inexplicable.\n\nMy second complaint is really a bit unfair and very minor. In the middle of the book, the main character is given a specific prop. Apparently, he is aware of what it signifies, but no one else is. And there is no way any reader could know because we do not live on the peninsula nor do we have a map of it. So, when Campion reveals its meaning – though the prop is alluded to a number of times and suspense is allowed to build over it – it falls flat. It makes sense, its logical. However, I think this could have been handled better and been an awesome prop as opposed to a fizzled out element.\n\n“Two young females in this ‘ere flat,” said Lugg. “Well!”\n\n“Shocking!” agreed Campion. “I don’t know what my wife would say.”\n\nMarlowe stared at him. “Good Lord, you haven’t a wife, have you?” he said.\n\n“No,” said Mr. Campion. “That’s why I don’t know what she’d say. Get your coats on, my little Rotarians.” — pg. 199, chapter 24\n\nI laughed at the above. Some readers might find it stupid. Most of Campion’s punchlines are hit or miss, but this one tickled me. Allingham did provide several nicely done action scenes. There is a rooftop house-breaking rescue full of all the excitement readers could want. There is a nighttime escape and evasion late in the book which results in several reveals, but also things like gunfire and quicksand! There are comical moments as well: being introduced to the rear entrance to Campion’s apartment is priceless.\n\nOverall, this is a serviceable enjoyable read. Readers ought not take it too seriously and have fun with the little romp. There is a dog who provides little levity and amusement, as well. I will very likely read the next in the series, which I already own. However, this is not a series I can gobble down – it definitely does better with breaks in between stories.\n\n3 stars\n\nThe Red House Mystery by A. A. Milne is a rather famous mystery novel by the well-known author of Winnie The Pooh. It was first published in 1922. I got my hardback copy back in 2018 and have been sluggish about reading it. The cover design on the jacket is unremarkable and the first chapter is a wee bit difficult to read through unless you are in a patient mood. Once one gets beyond the first three chapters, though, the pages really do fly.\n\nAt first the novel really does seem precisely like some writing exercise. It seems as if it is an exercise in writing a whodunit mystery by a competent and, even, strong author. However, it does not immediately present as something engaging and exciting. The novel is very British and the setting is the not-quite-manor home of a man who is a bit of a fop and a dandy. Truthfully, until I got a ways into the story, I really was doubting what all the fuss and praise for this novel were about. I am really glad that I finally set myself to reading the whole thing and I enjoyed it quite a bit, though I am not sure it qualifies as one of the best I have ever read. It did improve as I read along and I can recommend it to any general reader who enjoys vintage British mystery stories.\n\nThe characters are a bit unbelievable – particularly the four main characters. Everything is such a setup for the story that I felt Milne might have been a bit lazy. It is not that the setting and characters do not work, it is just that it seems too easy. In other words, it feels like the author wants to write a murder mystery and wants to jump to the heart of the situation without any development or building as to why or whom or how. Just hurry up and get to the detecting parts of the thing.\n\nIn a lot of ways Antony, the main character, is too good to be true. He’s too smart, too slick, too convenient, too casual, too friendly, too forgiving, too honest. I expect every reader likes him a whole lot and wants him to be safe and succeed and win the day. However, if I am being honest, the character is a little too cool.\n\nIt is fun to follow his detecting. Antony is so smart about everything. He is good-natured and a real pal. So, as he runs through the various scenarios and investigates while he enjoys plenty of relaxation, the reader gets a good schooling on how to run a proper vintage British amateur locked-room murder mystery. An official Inspector is, of course, called in to the crime scene, however, his deductions are not really a part of the story and only become interesting at the inquest.\n\nAs if Antony’s skills and personality were not enough, he gets his own “Watson” in this story. A younger lad named William Beverley who is willing to play the Watson rôle because he loves the fun and excitement of the whole thing. He keeps Antony company, does a bit of the dirty work, and provides a little comic relief. Bill Beverley is just the sort of harmless and helpful friend you would want to help you solve your murder mystery.\n\nThe murder is not very horrifying. It takes place in the office behind closed doors. The police are notified. Houseguests are sent away and “witnesses” are left to entertain themselves. The detecting takes place amidst dinners, pipe smoking, and leisurely walks. Eventually the frustrations and/or lack of possible solutions narrows the options to the point where the story must end. There can be nothing further to investigate.\n\nI enjoyed the novel because it is a little bit of a writing exercise. I also enjoyed the camaraderie and fun spirit of the characters. They poke fun at Sherlock and Watson, they tease detective novels, and they sport about the manor home. The story itself is grounded and reasonable. There is a lot to like in the novel and I think it is good to have read it, but it will not remain in my collection because I doubt I would read it again.\n\n3 stars\n\nA Red Herring Without Mustard by Alan Bradley is the third in the Flavia de Luce novel series. It was published in 2011. I read the first two in the series and enjoyed them and I think I will be giving this novel the same rating, four stars.\n\nMy only criticism of this novel is that it may have just a few too many red herrings and bunny trails. It can seem a bit repetitive. But, and this is key, Bradley writes such an engaging character the repetitiveness does not seem to matter. This series reminds me a lot of the Simon Green Ishmael Jones series. Basically, readers rather know what they are going to get – and if they like it, they like it. If they do not, then they don’t. No great boundaries were pushed around here, nothing innovative or extraordinary was done. This novel is not wholly unlike the previous two – however, if you liked those two, you will enjoy this one. Maybe some readers will feel that the character and stories are stagnant or not going anywhere. I agree with that while at the same time I am satisfied with the novels as they are. I like spending time in Bishop’s Lacey; that’s enough for me.\n\n… I had learned to start campfires, but I’d vowed that never again would I be caught dead trying to make a fire-bow from a stick and a shoestring, or rubbing two dry sticks together like a demented squirrel. – pg. 35, chapter 2\n\nThe thing that Bradley does very well is to confuse the reader with “reality.” There are murders/crimes – but the unreliable narrator element makes the novel a bit more layered than it would be otherwise. The fact that the narrator is not willfully deceiving the reader is important – the narrator is an incredibly likeable eleven-year old. Obviously the perspective and understanding of such an individual is not as holistic and nuanced as an adult’s vision. So, when Flavia applies her efforts to mysterious and suspicious events, the reader really does not have much to go on.\n\n“Good afternoon, Miss Flavia.”\n\n“Good afternoon, Dogger.”\n\n“Lovely rain.”\n\n“Quite lovely.”\n\nDogger glanced up at the golden sky, then went on with his weeding.\n\nThe very best people are like that. They don’t entangle you like flypaper. — pg. 129, chapter 10\n\nThe novels are, generally, lightweight and breezy. The pages turn quickly and some of the horrors are glossed over, of course. Interestingly, though, readers can pick up subtle hints and flavors of how wartime struggles affect matters. There are also poignant moments filled with potential emotion. I say “potential” because Flavia is discovering she is caught in the middle of changing worlds, changing classes of society, changing viewpoints, etc. She wrestles with the manners of the gentry, religion of a separate group, economic concerns of those dealing with wars, and the maturation of her own personality. Bradley skirts some of these issues, but he does give glimpses of these struggles.\n\nUnder any other circumstances, I’d have said something rude and stalked out of the room, but I thought better of it. The investigation of murder, I was beginning to learn, can demand great personal sacrifice. — pg. 216, chapter 17\n\nI usually read these with half-attention. These novels do not require my full attention, which is good because sometimes I do not have much attention left to give. Sometimes it feels weird – like I am not really reading the novel and the pages are turning anyway. Yet I do always notice the awesome quotes or quips or whatever.\n\nThe main movement in this novel as regards the series is that Buckshaw is under continued financial stress and even the eleven-year old is beginning to feel it. Secondly, the subplot with Flavia’s mother continues. This is an enjoyable read. It is witty and eventful and engaging. Its not intense literature, but it is fun enough to read in the summertime.\n\n4 stars\n\nDeath at the President’s Lodging by Michael Innes (John Innes Mackintosh Stewart 1906 – 1994) was first published in 1936 and is the author’s first novel in the Inspector John Appleby series. Innes was an academic; professor of English Language and Letters. This novel was published when he was only thirty years old and while I think it is nearly excellent, there are some minor issues that I think keep it from being a five-star novel. First and foremost the most important point to emphasize is that this is not an entirely coldly serious novel, it is a bit self-referential and it does seek to amuse via subtle wit at the expense of detective novels in general. Not just mystery novels, but also academic life (specifically high-brow British).\n\nThroughout the novel the wit and humor is very subtle and very tongue-in-cheek. Readers who can pick up on subtle nuances and hints are going to have a better time of this one than readers who just like straightforward “whodunits.” In his very first detective novel, Innes includes a character who is a don of a university that also, under a pseudonym, writes detective novels. Including such a character is a mark of confidence and also demonstrates the author’s ability to find amusement in such reflective items.\n\n“To be as clear as I can, sir, I would speak a trifle technically and say that your question had a latent content. The feeling-tone evoked was decidedly peculiar.” And with this triumph of academic statement Slotwiner gave one more ghost of a bow to Appleby and glided – levitated almost, to speak technically – out of the room. – pg. 33, chapter 2, part 3.\n\nThis segment, where Inspector Appleby is quickly asking a few questions of the butler, was the first piece of the book in which I laughed aloud. Its the “technically” part. It is even funnier as you read it in context. Like I said, the humor is subtle and tight.\n\nThere are sometimes passages like the below that can be used as a litmus test for readers. You will either snort because you find it amusing or you will find it tedious, stupid, and obnoxious:\n\nThe ability to smell a rat is an important part of the detective’s equipment. Appleby had smelt a rat – in the wrong place. But he was too wary to take it that a rat in the wrong place is necessarily a red herring: it may be a rat with a deceptive fish-like smell – and still a rat. — pg. 166, chapter 11, part 1\n\nSubtle humor like this, a little wordplay, will either make readers giggle a bit or they will find it impenetrable and wonder why the author is writing “like this.” In any case, in this novel there are plenty of suspects, and as the detective often complains, a lot of “light” on the matter. In other words, there seems to be too many clues and too much evidence. This is kind of a fun twist, again surprising for a first novel, on the detective novel trope – usually, it seems, detectives are missing key clues or are constantly looking for more evidence to prove their theories. The fact that there is an abundance of evidence is a neat element for this genre.\n\nThe overall theme of this novel, though, is its academic setting. As I have said many times, most writers write what they know and Innes was definitely an academic. We can know this through his biographical reports, but also because of the very accurate and realistic manner in which he portrays the setting and characters in this novel.\n\nMost of the suspects or persons of interest in this novel are dons/fellows/professors. The ones who are not, are long-time residents and employees of the school. The core group of individuals that are involved are scholars: to be seen as experts in their field and in academia generally. These are men who have dedicated their lives to their profession, in whatever specific field of study that was, and have been granted the titles and prestige to go along with achieving a high level of success.\n\nImmediately upon beginning his investigation, and at several points throughout, Appleby is struck by the fact that this case is not the “average crime” involving hasty, ham-fisted criminals. In this case, the suspects and witnesses are all exceedingly comfortable with being interrogated about details, they are experts in explanations, and they are adept at ratiocination. These are calculating, efficient, and sharp intellects that generally do not make errors and cannot be bullied by a gruff interrogation.\n\nInnes does not give us a weakling for an inspector, though. Turns out, Appleby is a graduate of the school himself. The case allows for a bit of a homecoming, if you will. This little detail gives the reasonability of Appleby to “keep up with” the dons intellectually and also for his moving around campus with the facility that is afforded a member, so to speak.\n\nI enjoyed considering this situation. It is a daunting and interesting scenario to put your detective up against. I imagined some of the minds that I know and knew from all of my schooling and I promise I would not want to have to sift through their witness statements or to have to discover which of them was misleading or something. To have to match wits in such circumstances would be intense – but what a fun theme for a novel!\n\nInnes balances out these formidable intellects with a brilliant and lovely segment in chapter eleven that is, no doubt, quite famous among those who have read it. It is worth, probably, reading the entire book just to come upon this fantastic section. Appleby has gone about to trace the movements of a couple of the dons on the night the murder took place. This involves his going to the suburbs where one is likely to find “scholars of enormous age” who live in quiet retreats. The entire segment is worth reading every single word for because it is absolutely beautifully depicted, but the ultimate point is that Appleby has called on a small villa in which lives Sir Theodore Peek.\n\nAppleby found him in a small and gloomy room, piled round with an indescribable confusion of books and manuscripts – and asleep. Or sometimes asleep and sometimes awake – for every now and then the eyes of this well-nigh ante-mundane man would open – and every now and then they would close. But when they opened, they opened to decipher a fragment of papyrus on his desk – and then, the deciphering done, a frail hand would make a note before the eyes closed once more. It was like being in the presence of some animated symbol of learning. — pg. 169, chapter 11, part 2\n\nEvery bit of Appleby’s interview with Peek is outstanding for its witty, realism, erudition, and fun. A perfect chunk of writing – including the end of the segment with its utterly truthful response from Appleby. Anyway, this scene is absolutely perfect and I feel like I have seen it, lived it, and see it coming in the future. The description is totally balanced with the necessary realism and the intrinsic characteristic of humor found in brute reality.\n\nFrom what I have I have written so far, it should be amply clear that I enjoyed the novel and that it contains several uncommon elements to make it interesting and engaging even among mystery readers. However, I am very sad that I have to refrain from giving it the full five-star rating. The first reason is that it became clear that Innes could not (or would not?) write the character of Dr. Barocho. This character was removed from the “likely suspects” early on (he lacked means and motive, I suppose), however, if we are to believe Appleby is as thorough and diligent as he is meant to be, then we were deprived of an interview with Barocho – although we did have interactions with him. Unfortunately, the interactions made Barocho seem like an awkward character simply because of the fact that he is a “foreign” item in the setting. It is not that he was written rudely, but that he was not given a fair chance at being either a hero or a villain. So why include him at all except to include a foreigner?\n\nSecondly, the ending is paced a little too suddenly. One should have expected the denouement to be a bit of a gather round and explain. However, it seems like Appleby was just a moment ago by the river watching the rowing team and pondering clues. Then, suddenly, denouement. The end. It is not inaccurate or strange, but it is paced too suddenly. This could be a product of it, indeed, being Innes’ first novel and maybe in the following books this is tamed and tempered.\n\nLastly, the strongest reason for withholding the fifth star, is the motive-cause of the murderer. Pargeter would be dismayed. Its not enough. Its not good enough. Its not worth all of the foregoing. It could be valid, naturally, but it was not proven. It was hung upon like shirt is hung on a hanger. It is not sufficiently nuanced.\n\nSo, overall, I am thrilled I read this one. It was a great read and I enjoyed so much of it. I loved spending time at St. Anthony’s with all of these gentlemen and I did not find Appleby to be some retread of any other inspector. I liked the setting and the writing and the crime, but yes, I admit, the denouement needed a bit more work. I would happily read Appleby stories again. Recommended for bright readers, vintage mystery fans, and for readers who do not get frustrated at subtle humor. The reader is not going to be spoonfed – to speak technically.\n\n4 stars\n\nI finished The Case of the Gilded Fly by Edmund Crispin last night. I have been reading it this week and at several points I was inclined to read sections aloud to my household, to the chagrin of my household. I did not love so many things about this novel to include the plot and the murder. However, there are a whole lot of things that I really did enjoy, which more than makes up for the things that I disliked. Before I begin, let me mention that “Edmund Crispin” is the penname for Englishman Robert Bruce Montgomery (1921 – 1978). He was a relatively prolific writer along with being an organ scholar and music composer. Allegedly he was friends with Philip Larkin and Kingsley Amis. The Case of the Gilded Fly is his first novel and stars his detective Gervase Fen. It was first published in 1944 when Crispin was himself an undergraduate at Oxford.\n\nI have a feeling that this novel will divide contemporary readers. I can imagine how it would irritate and vex readers who are not as comfortable with madcap tongue-in-cheek satirical moments in their novels. It is also obvious that readers who are not very classically well-read (how’s your off-the-cuff Latin? your drop-of-a-dime Shakespeare? how familiar are you with the traditional Anglican Evensong?) will feel this novel is “obnoxious.” I had a blast with the novel – for the most part. I want to give this one four stars. Unfortunately, when I am very honest and I do not let myself get carried away by how amused I was, I can truly only grant it three stars.\n\nSo, the novel begins with a tedious introduction to each of the primary characters as they travel via train to Oxford. One long segment dedicated to each of the characters, one after another, is not the most engaging writing. I understand the importance of giving the reader the roster and just dumping the background of these characters all at once at the reader, but it is a slog to get through straight into the novel. However, being honest, I have to knock a star off (in a sense) because its not a very fun method.\n\nHere is where the story really had no chance of being five stars – I really dislike theatre and plays and film and none of that is my scene. I have written about this before. Acting troupes and actors and the stage are probably my least favorite topics/themes etc. I want you to know this though: as I sit here and complain grouchily about the theatre, I literally have a copy of the complete works of Aristophanes tucked under my pillow in my bed. I am re-reading the stuff. Love The Frogs best of all. I read it at night, usually, and I just shove the book wherever because I do tend to read to exhaustion.\n\nThis brings me to the detective of the novel, Gervase Fen. I think he is fantastic. He is a forty-two year old literature professor. At the start of Chapter Thirteen, through the mind’s eye of the character Nigel Blake, Crispin gives us a well-colored, insightful, and developed description of his concept for the character. Readers who had been utterly annoyed by Fen thus far, hopefully can establish a somewhat kinder view of him after reading this? I am absolutely not going to lie, part of my appreciation for Fen is that he reminds me, in bits and shades, of a certain person…….\n\nOne of the segments that I read aloud was the story-in-a-story told by Wilkes. It is a ghost story and it seems to set the tone of the novel for an upcoming murder – but it, itself, has nothing to do with the murder. On one hand it is a strange inclusion, on the other, it does more to set the tone and style the setting than most authors are capable of doing directly. I also found the story itself to be creepy and imagined it quite clearly. A chilling little story, peppered with just the correct amount of wit. Its a beautifully written segment.\n\nFrom the moment of Wilkes’ arrival, throughout the rest of this section, Fen’s reactions are amusing as heck. Familiar, too, I might add quietly. Fen cracks me up. I feel like readers will find him to be utterly rude and cantankerous, but they ought to understand he is not malicious whatsoever. Balancing his moments with his sensible and patient wife Dolly’s comments is a fine bit of writing by Crispin.\n\nIn chapter six, when the group has found the body and the police are on the scene, there is a section that had me laughing aloud and I even read the section to my, once again, long-suffering household. Sir Richard and Fen get absorbed by an examination of a certain prop – and Crispin writes it absolutely perfectly. Its beyond humorous and silly. I feel almost embarrassed because I feel like this is precisely the absurd moment that would occur in my world. I, and my associates, would huffily tell you that “accuracy matters” and would not feel that any such enquiry wastes time since it is all in service to the great heap of “Knowledge.”\n\nThe pacing of the novel is a bit off, though. I mean, like the train that it starts with, it seems to take a bit for the whole thing to get rolling. There are parts where it seems like nothing is going anywhere and everyone is lost and dazed. After all is said and done, nearly at the very end, there is a seemingly random theory about trains proposed by Nicholas that really seems out of place in the novel, though it does have amusing qualities. I do not really care for the characters. Nicholas seems the most realistic, though Nigel, I suppose, is the character readers are supposed to use for grounding, let’s say. Nigel is a former student of Fen’s. Nigel Blake is a character that I am sure has any number of referents to other bits external to this novel though, since I am not a Crispin scholar, I could not say what they are definitively. (Cp. Nigel Strangeways/Cecil Day-Lewis and also “Nigel Bathgate” of Marsh’s 1934 novel). The character Yseut Haskell is quite awful. Everyone thinks so.\n\nI think that, for modern readers, one of the more challenging aspects of the novel is the frequent self-awareness of the novel. It sometimes critiques itself, refers to itself, mocks itself. Its subtle at times and other times its loud and brash. I think readers unused to this sort of writing will find it disconcerting and dislike not knowing on what terms to take the novel. Its easier for readers to accept a novel that is this or that, let us say, rather than one that chooses a style and remains there throughout. This novel is a detective novel, its a entertainment, its also a satire, and its a bit of an homage. If that is not enough, at times, it also is self-aware and purposely talks past the reader or shuts the reader out. Yes, I am sure these things can aggravate readers unprepared for them. Or readers who lack imagination.\n\nAn example of this is how throughout we are frequently told by all of the characters that Yseut is hideous and no one likes her whatsoever. The reader begins to, perhaps, accept this as reality and as a reasonable thing. Then, abruptly, late in the novel, there is an about-face, if you will, when the novel nearly rebukes the characters and readers for being so accepting of the harshness toward Yseut. A delicate reader might actually feel a twinge of guilt here; after all Yseut, with all of her public flaws, is still only a silly, young thing.\n\nA murder mystery with some witty criticism and commentary that might pick fun at other detective novels (Fen mutters against the dull police investigation, the ridiculousness of Oxford zeitgeist, generally, and overall comments about the theatre.) A subtle farce, an amusing mystery. One of the things readers should watch for with Fen is that while he completely disassembles a seemingly pompous and snarky character (Nicholas), he also admits (later on) that Nicholas has an excellent intelligence. Almost as if Fen is harshest on those from whom he expects more.\n\nFen’s baleful worries about how he should act with regard to the fact that he can solve the murder that mostly everyone wants to believe is a suicide does bring up some interesting ethical questions. He bluntly demands characters to state their opinions on murder. He lets all the characters share their opinions, almost as if welcoming them to assert that they are comfortable with murder “in some cases” and then he will suddenly make a comment scolding them for such immorality. I feel some of this, too, must be taken in the context of that lovely year 1944 and the war-weary world.\n\nOverall, this novel is a little messy – the resolution of the murder (the actual locked-room is a bit too difficult for me to really deal with). It has some flaws. It also has some of the best wit and humor that I have read in quite awhile. I think Fen is really priceless. This is definitely not a novel for all readers, whether readers want to hear that or not. I think, however, blaming the novel for educational deficiencies in the reader would be the incorrect way to go. Of course I am most certainly going to read more Crispin.\n\n3 stars"
