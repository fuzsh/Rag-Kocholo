        "text": "Two of the most famous leading ladies in American films throughout the 1960s and 70s were Faye Dunaway and Jane Fonda. When one of them got the role in a hit film, chances are the other was also in competition. If someone else was chosen, Faye and Jane were probably also on the producer’s mind. These two always went hand in hand as the hot and sexy ladies to grace the silver screen and win a myriad of honors as a result of the performances they gave. But for this cinephile, only one of them is worthy of being synonymous with the word “talent”, while the other can be described as “mediocre”.\n\nWhenever I see a film, I always expect to see the actors not only recite their lines clearly, but be animated in their body language and have a purpose for being in the plot. I can safely say that Faye Dunaway never fails to be a tour de force on screen, no matter the genre of the picture or the size of her role. My personal favorite Dunaway role has got to be her Academy Award winning performance in Sidney Lumet’s “Network” as the vindictive Diana Christiansen. This harridan wants nothing more than a top ratings program to save a struggling network, even if it means driving the intended host to the brink of insanity. In the scenes where Diana is pitching the ideas for raunchy, off the wall TV ideas, Dunaway is invested into the character as she persuades everyone to hop on board with her, through her seduction and high ranking prowess. She doesn’t miss a beat in her iambic recitation of her lines and leaves the audience spellbound as a result. I also loved her as Bonnie Parker in “Bonnie And Clyde”, where she is quirky and full of spunk as she recites her famous line “We rob banks” and as Evelyn Mulwray in “Chinatown” with her heartbreaking climatic admission about her troubled past. Even in the lukewarm reviewed “Mommy Dearest” as Joan Crawford, she knocked out a home run as the Joan that the public never saw. I think it should have gotten her more positive reception, instead of the Razzie award she “won”. I hope to see more of her in the coming years, with a career defining performance that might get her another Academy Award.\n\nAnd then there is Jane Fonda. Even when I was young and getting my foot in the door as a film fan, I thought that she was lacking as a captivating actress. To find out that she had won two Academy Awards as opposed to Faye’s one award, was an utter travesty. I do think that Dunaway’s performance in “Network” is worth the weight of three Oscars. Jane Fonda is only where she is because of her father and the reality of it is that she’s a horrible actress. There is no versatility in the way that each role stands out from the others. Every performance seems like she stayed in the script reading phase until the end of the shoot. In “They Shoot Horses, Don’t They”, her suffering state is underwhelming at best. When she tells Michael Sarrazin to end her life, I did not feel her pain one bit, because she didn’t show it throughout the rest of the flick. In “Cat Ballou”, she reminded me of a bad school play performance, or an utterly horrible Faith Domergue role in a sci-fi bomb. Even in her Academy Award winning performance in “Coming Home” she’s stiff as a board in the most emotional scene where she is trying to comfort her deranged husband, played by Bruce Dern. Even this year, in “Youth” she’s hamming it up on screen for 5 minutes and people love it. If it was Dunaway or even Ann-Margret, the role wouldn’t even be in the running, but because it’s a Fonda, all this extra attention is brought onto a mere average cameo. It’s no Beatrice Straight or Judi Dench from the excerpt that I saw.\n\nNepotism is the reason that Jane Fonda is at the worldwide fame level that she is at today. Faye Dunaway never had any family links to Hollywood, so I feel that she worked a lot harder to add that extra zest to each of her performances. Yet it’s Fonda who is in the mainstream more often and is more celebrated than Dunaway. I feel that Dunaway is the better talent who has made a bigger impact on Hollywood and has said more famous lines and has been seen in more famous screenshots. She is easily the better of the two. Feel free to agree or disagree with me."
