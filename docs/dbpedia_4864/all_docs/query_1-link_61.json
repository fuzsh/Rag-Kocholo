        "text": "Review of: THE TAMING OF THE SNOOD (Columbia Short - 1940)\n\nI’m going back over some of Buster’s Columbia shorts – usually a painful process but I can always find a gem or two in each one. At the risk of being summarily dismissed from many “elite” Busterdoms, I have to admit I actually LIKE “The Taming of the Snood.” (There. I said it.) Disclaimer: the following review contains spoilers, but since the plot of this movie is completely moot (if there even is one), I’ll proceed….\n\nKeaton’s sendups of Hollywood legends are favorites. In “Snood,” however, he’s parodying Buster Keaton, and it seems the studio allowed him leeway to work the way he used to. It’s as if he returned to his “work the beginning and the end and the middle will take care of itself” habit of his silent films. This movie is ALL middle! Granted, when the opening scene takes us to “Keaton’s Hat Shop” (where all hats are 4/3’s off) – you KNOW what’s going to pop up and it does in shades of “Steamboat Bill Jr.” Say what you want about the other actors in “Snood” – the porkpie has a leading role.\n\nThe first seven minutes of the second reel are probably the purest revival of “The Three Keatons” tablework extant, and if nothing else it makes “Snood” worth watching. Aside from the Hammer and Anvil Chorus routine from ‘Grand Slam Opera,’ this might be the only chance we get to see what it was like when Joe Sr. and Buster tore up the Vaudeville stages in the days before film. In this case, it seems Buster has taken on his father’s role, and screwball Elsie Ames gets to be the progeny.\n\nIt’s pure physical comedy, and even in middle age Buster could still amaze with his athletic prowess. Interestingly, he takes one fall with an audible moan and it makes me wonder what his silent films actually sounded like on the set. In his day, Buster had to keep a straight face for the camera, but he didn’t need to keep his mouth shut! I’ll bet his original pratfalls made for some interesting real-life dialog we’ll never get to hear (and you don’t need to read lips well to pick out all the f-bombs in his silent films).\n\nSay what you want about Elsie (and nobody seems to come up with much good to say about her – even Eleanor), but she could take a fall with the best of them. It appears that Columbia was trying to create a male/female Abbot & Costello with Buster & Elsie, and it’s interesting to watch Keaton graduate into the role of straight-man-with-a-temper for a change. He’s one step up from the bumbling “Elmer” in many of the Columbia shorts – refreshing except for the fact that they also introduced us to Buster as a yowling, whining, screeching character. I’m sorry… Buster Keaton doesn’t scream for help. It does not compute. Fail, Columbia!\n\nSpeaking of fails, poor Elsie Ames doesn’t even have a Wiki entry. She made 15 films (5 with Buster) and doesn’t even have a bio on iMdb! Will one of you out there tackle this for us?? Maybe it’ just me, but he seemed to enjoy working with her – there are several scenes in the 5 Columbias where you KNOW Buster is stifling the urge to crack up at her antics. Check out his reaction in “Snood” to her performance of his signature stunt – not once, but twice. Classic!\n\nInterestingly, it seems the Hays Office made Buster put on longjohns under his trousers so the audiences wouldn’t be offended when Elsie tears his pants off. Considering the several rather compromising positions that result between Buster and Elsie in the table scene (especially at the end - whoa! Is anyone thinking what I am?), I’m amazed they thought Buster’s knobby knees would cause trouble.\n\nLastly, I think one of the gems in “Snood” is Buster’s lament: “Awww, lookit my little hat!” (snif. they killed it!) If that doesn’t make everyone break out the sugar water and the fedoras to make him a replacement….. I’ll eat my porkpie!\n\nI’m interested to see everyone’s take on this movie. Am I the only one who thinks it’s spiffy?"
