        "text": "\"Ms. Dare married musician and later Business Executive, John L. Van Dam, May 22, 1942 and he passed away in 1995. Survivors are 4 children, 3 sons and one daughter. 14 grandchildren and 6 great-grandchildren.\n\nI never knew Dorothy was married for so many years! She was very private and she never divulged any information regarding her family life. Dottie believed family was seperate from her public life and often would say, \"Children need to be shielded from the harsh realities of public life and this includes the Hollywood spotlight!\" I guess this is why she left Hollywood so soon??\n\nDorothy's grandson Laird says, \"My Grandmother referred to my Grandfather as the greatest love in her life.\" She would often say, \"I never would have believed I would be so lucky in life. I married a beautiful man, I was blessed with delightful children and I have the most wonderful grandchildren!\" \"What more can a Dutch girl ask for?\"\n\nThis makes me so happy reading this statement from Laird and I must admit, it does make me both smile and cry at the same time. Laird says, Dottie married in Chicago. Sari states, \"My Mother remained friends with many from her Hollywood days and shared many friendships with her fans.\" \"She shared many interests in her life and especially enjoyed the \"wonders\" of the Internet and she loved her i-phone!\" \"Texting and e-mailing were her favorite things to do\", states her friend former actress/dancer Cyd Charisse.\n\nSincerely, Bron\n\nP.S.\n\nI hope this helps you some, I must admit, these are very trying times right now.\n\nDottie's daughter is very distraught right now and I will be with her for the next few days.\"\n\nNothing could be found on a John Van Dam dying in 1995. The person who received the above email did a brief search on the internet and found a link in a December 2007 newsletter of the Larchmont (NY) Historical Society, which has a reprint of a newspaper article from 1949, in which the author writes of his childhood in Larchmont in 1899. Two of his friends are Colby and Loring Van Dam, sons of the \"well-known actress Dorothy Dare\". I contacted the archivist of the LHS and inquired if they had anything on Dorothy Dare, or the Van Dam family, but nothing was found in any of their sources. Apparently there was an earlier 'Dorothy Dare, actress' who married a 'Van Dam' - how coincidental could it be that the 1930s 'Dorothy Dare' also married a 'Van Dam'? This puzzle was becoming more intriguing with every bit of information that was found. My friend did not write an obituary for the \"recently deceased Dorothy Dare\", as he, too, was suspicious."
