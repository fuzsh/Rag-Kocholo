        "text": "Tag: Ziegfeld Follies\n\nThe Final Curtain\n\nNearly a century after his passing, many still regard Florenz Ziegfeld Jr as the most important and influential producer of Broadway musicals. His theatrical revues, filled with leggy chorines and wisecracking comics, set a standard for everything from Busby Berkeley productions to the Fats Waller stage celebration Ain’t Misbehavin’.\n\nBut when Robert Benchley checked out Ziegfeld’s latest revue, Hot-Cha, which opened at the Ziegfeld Theatre on March 8, 1932, he found it tiresome, and no amount of expensive scenery could keep the show from ending on a “particularly sickening thud.” What Benchley couldn’t know, however, was that Hot-Cha would be the last original musical-comedy produced by Ziegfeld, who in just four months would punch his final ticket.\n\nSelections from the Ziegfeld Theatre program promised a stageful of talents, including 75 “Glorified Girls”…\n\n…and Ziegfeld (1867–1932) would be back in May for a revival of Show Boat, which once again proved to be a hit, but a bout of pleurisy would claim his life on July 22, 1932. As Benchley alluded in his review, these lavish shows led to equally lavish expenses, and Ziegfeld, having lost much of his money in the stock market crash, would leave his actress wife Billy Burke with substantial debts. The plucky Burke, however, marched on with a successful acting career that included her appearance as Glinda the Good Witch in 1939’s Wizard of Oz.\n\n* * *\n\nEveryone’s a Critic\n\nThe March 19 issue also featured drama criticism from Alexander Woollcott in his “Shouts and Murmurs” column. In this case, Woollcott had a bone to pick with the famed playwright Eugene O’Neill, as well as with Guild Theatre’s coughing patrons, who called to mind a chorus of frogs:\n\n* * *\n\nDown in Old Mexico\n\nThe New Yorker’s latest “Out of Town” feature assured travelers that Mexico was a safe destination, and advised men to pack “spring suits and a dinner jacket” if they planned to visit Mexico City. The author of this piece (signed “P.L.”) cautioned travelers “to get insulated against liquid lightning before getting flip with the national drinks: pulque and tequila. Bootleg liquor is no preparation for the havoc these work even on the sternest drinker.”\n\n* * *\n\nSweating With the Stars\n\nThe March 19 “A Reporter at Large” column carried the simple title “Exercise.” Written by journalist Russell Lord* (1895-1964), this excerpt revealed some high-powered clients of one of the world’s first celebrity trainers:\n\nIn Lord’s conclusion, he noted that after a workout patrons were treated to a doze under a sunlamp…and a cigarette…\n\n* In his day, Russell Lord was a noted agricultural writer and editor of the agricultural literary journal The Land, which promoted ecologically responsible agricultural practices.\n\n* * *\n\nFame and Infamy\n\nI include this snippet from John Mosher’s film column to note the first reference in The New Yorker to the March 1, 1932 kidnapping of the baby of Charles and Anne Morrow Lindbergh…the lives and various doings of the Lindberghs were frequent subjects in the early days of the magazine…\n\n* * *\n\nFrom Our Advertisers\n\nWe’ll start by sampling some of the wares in the back pages…looks like Ziegfeld got a big bang for his small investment with his Hot-Cha ad…\n\n…while Ziegfeld ran a cheap ad for his lavish production, the R.F. Simmons Company decided to go big with this ad for…drum roll please…watch chains…\n\n…the makers of Cliquot Club Ginger Ale also did their best to promote a mundane product, claiming their beverage had a “piquant personality”…yeah, especially with a splash or two of some bootleg whisky…\n\n…the makers of Spuds were staying with their stupid “Mouth-Happy” theme, assuring menthol cigarette smokers they will be the life the party…a party filled with old gasbags, that is…\n\n…R.J. Reynolds continued to push their Camels on the growing market of women smokers, demonstrating the effects of a fresh cigarette with this image of a rosy-cheeked nurse…\n\n…DeSoto (a division of Chrysler) gave Depression-era readers something to smile about with this full-color, two-page advertisement featuring a sunny beach scene and an affordable automobile…\n\n…on to our cartoons, here’s Carl Rose’s perspective on the Disarmament Conference taking place in Geneva, Switzerland…\n\n…while the Otto Soglow’s Little King had his own way of projecting power…\n\n…on the domestic scene, Barbara Shermund’s modern women were channeling René Descartes…\n\n…and William Steig showed us a couple debating an equally weighty matter…\n\n…and via Richard Decker, some well-groomed polar explorers…\n\n…two of Helen Hokinson’s “girls” stopped by the International Flower Show at Grand Central Palace…\n\n…and we end with another classic from James Thurber…\n\nNext Time: Dirge for a Dirigible…\n\nMarkey’s Road Trip\n\nWith the explosion of car ownership in the 1920s and 30s came improved highways across America, but if one were to undertake a long-distance journey, like The New Yorker’s Morris Markey, you were bound to find a wide range of conditions, from concrete highways to muddy dirt roads.\n\nMarkey wrote about his experience of driving from New York City to Atlanta for his “Reporter at Large” column, noting that stops at filling stations also offered opportunities to fill up on bootleg gin. Drunk driving, it seems, wasn’t a big concern in the early 1930s.\n\nUnfortunately, Markey shared the sensibilities of many of his fellow Americans 89 years ago, and made this observation about drivers below the Mason and Dixon Line:\n\n* * *\n\nPale Riders\n\nSince the mid-19th century Chelsea’s Tenth Avenue was known as “Death Avenue” due to the killing and maiming of hundreds who got in the way of freight trains that plowed through 10th and 11th Avenues in the service of warehouses and factories in the district. In the 1850s the freight line hired horsemen known as “West Side Cowboys” to warn wagons and pedestrians of oncoming trains, but even with this precaution nearly 450 people were killed by trains between 1852 and 1908, with almost 200 deaths occurring in the decade preceding 1908. Calls for an elevated railroad were finally answered with the opening of the High Line in 1934. “The Talk of the Town” looked in on the last of these urban cowboys:\n\n* * *\n\nGuys and Dolls\n\n“The Talk of the Town” had some fun with a little-known aspect of a notorious gangster’s life; namely, the doll-filled house belonging to Jack “Legs” Diamond:\n\n“Talk” also made joking reference to the number of times Diamond had been shot and survived to tell about it.\n\nDiamond’s luck would run out at the end of 1931 — Dec. 18, to be exact — when gunmen would break into his hotel room in Troy, NY, and put three bullets into his head.\n\n* * *\n\nZiggy’s Stardust\n\nFlorenz Ziegfeld (1867-1932) had a knack for show business, launching the careers of many entertainers through his Ziegfeld Follies, which got its start in 1907 during vaudeville’s heyday. The advent of sound movies signaled the end of the vaudeville era and of Ziegfeld himself, who would stage one final Follies before his death in 1932. Gilbert Seldes penned a two-part profile of Ziegfeld under the title “Glorifier” (caricature by the great Abe Birnbaum). An excerpt:\n\n* * *\n\nIf Looks Could Kill\n\nThe New Yorker’s film critic John Mosher had a difficult time making sense of Murder by the Clock and its lead actress, Lilyan Tashman, who gave a tongue-in-cheek performance as the film’s femme fatale.\n\n* * *\n\nEine Kleine Nachtmusik\n\nOpen-air performances of classical music and opera were popular summertime diversions in the days before air-conditioning. In 1931 crowds gathered in Lewisohn Stadium to hear the New York Philharmonic perform under the direction of Willem van Hoogstraten, who conducted the Lewisohn summer concert series from 1922 to 1939. Here is a listing in The New Yorker’s “Goings On About Town” section:\n\n* * *\n\nFrom Our Advertisers\n\nFlo Ziegfeld’s 1931 Follies were lavish productions, but his advertising in The New Yorker was anything but as evidenced in this tiny ad that appeared at the bottom of page 52…\n\n…no doubt anticipating the demise of Prohibition, the makers of Anheuser-Busch beverages ramped up the promotion of their non-alcoholic products to create associations with pre-Prohibition times…\n\n…not to be outdone by the East Coast chocolates giant Schrafft’s, Whitman’s took out this full page ad to suggest how you might enjoy their product…\n\n…which was in sharp contrast to the approach Schrafft’s took in this full-page ad featured in the April 25, 1931 New Yorker, which touted the health benefits of its candy…\n\n…on to our cartoons, Richard Decker took us swimming with a middle-aged man who was anything but bored…\n\n…Barbara Shermund went en plein air with a couple of her ditzy debs…\n\n…Garrett Price also went to the country to find a bit of humor…\n\n…Helen Hokinson found a home away from home for a couple looking to take the sea air…\n\n…James Thurber continued to explore his brewing war between the sexes…\n\n…Harry Haenigsen gave us a novel approach to landing a trophy fish…\n\n…William Steig illustrated the wonders of the tailoring profession…\n\n…and Alan Dunn aptly summed up the generation gap of the 1930s…\n\n…on to the Aug. 1, 1931 issue…\n\n…”The Talk of the Town” mused about the advertising jingles made famous by the makers of Sapolio soap…\n\n…Bret Harte actually did write jingles for the brand, once described by Time magazine as “probably the world’s best-advertised product” in its heyday. With a huge market share, Sapolio was so well known in the early 20th century that its owners decided they no longer needed to spend money on advertising. It was a poor decision, and by 1940 the product disappeared from the marketplace.\n\n* * *\n\nTough Love\n\nAs a charter member of the famed Algonquin Round Table, Heywood Broun was a friend to many of the founding writers and editors of The New Yorker. And so it must have been quite a task to review his play, Shoot the Works, which The New Yorker found wanting in a number of aspects. And because he was so close to Broun himself, Robert Benchley left the review writing to someone who signed the column “S. Finny.” I can’t find any record of an S. Finny at The New Yorker, and I don’t believe this is a Benchley pseudonym (he used “Guy Fawkes” in The New Yorker). At any rate, here is an excerpt:\n\n* * *\n\nFrom Our Advertisers\n\nThe makers of the “Flexo” ice cube tray continued to tout the wonders of their product with these Ripley-themed ads. This might appear rather mundane to modern eyes, but electric refrigerators with built-in freezers were still rather novel in 1931…\n\n…another way to stay cool in the summer of 1931 was to take an excursion to the Northern climes…\n\n…this ad for the New York American featured an illustration by Herbert Roese, whose early work strongly resembled that of Peter Arno’s…\n\n…on to our cartoons, we have the latest antics of the Little King courtesy Otto Soglow…\n\n…William Steig added levity to a heavy moment…\n\n…Barbara Shermund found humor at an antiques shop…\n\n...John Held Jr continued his revels into our “naughty” Victorian past…\n\n…and we end with Garrett Price, and a look at the ways of the modern family…\n\nNext Time: An American Classic…\n\nFirecracker Lane\n\nWhen fireworks were still allowed on the streets of New York City, Firecracker Lane was the place to go for all your pyrotechnic needs.\n\nBy 1931, however, fireworks had been banned across the greater New York City area, so customers visiting Firecracker Lane—a short row of sellers on Park Place between Broadway and Church Street—had to find a friendly burg beyond the metropolis to shoot off their Independence Day arsenals.\n\nBefore the city clamped down on the fun, Firecracker Lane did a bustling trade, and fireworks were even manufactured at sites around the metro area. But after a number of explosions and fires, the city closed down the fireworks factories, and by 1931 Fireworks Lane itself was on its last leg. “The Talk of the Town” visited what remained, and reminisced about the glory days.\n\n* * *\n\nNot Mum on Mumford\n\nIn the previous post we were introduced to critic Lewis Mumford, who excoriated plans for the new Radio City, now known as Rockefeller Center. In his “Notes and Comment,” E.B. White added his own two cents:\n\n* * *\n\nFrom Our Advertisers\n\nNew Yorkers who wanted to get away from the steamy streets of Manhattan (almost no one had air conditioning in 1931) could catch the cooling breezes of the Atlantic on any number of cruise lines that plied the Eastern Seaboard and Canadian Maritimes during the summer…here the French Line offered a six-day “Triangle Cruise”…\n\n…while Cunard offered a similar excursion (employing the cartooning skills of H.O. Hofman) that allowed passengers to “do the ocean” in just four days…\n\n…to earn the ever-shrinking travel dollar during the Depression, both the Red Star and White Star lines offered their giant ocean liners for half- and full-week cruises to the Maritimes, Red Star even throwing in some on-board entertainment, claiming to be the first to do so “on any ocean”…\n\n…I’m not sure where this pair is headed, but the angle suggests they just drove off a cliff…\n\n…if cliff diving wasn’t your thing, you could tool around in a bright red Dodge boat…\n\n…or be easily amused like this guy on the right, who gets his jollies from the abundance of ice cubes in his fridge…\n\n…over at Essex House we find a more reserved scene, the “well-born” father and son gloating over their Central Park view…\n\n…the Essex House might have been “all that,” but Dad and Junior would have to reconsider their social rank against a newcomer — the Waldorf-Astoria, reborn on Park Avenue…\n\n…on to our cartoons, this couple illustrated by Garrett Price might consider something with a larger balcony…\n\n…Otto Soglow’s Little King took his Little Prince out for some air…\n\n…Kemp Starrett showed us a chap who contemplated the passing of time along with the passing of his timepiece…\n\n…Isadore Klein updated the theme of a damsel in distress…\n\n…the growing popularity of Ping-Pong gave James Thurber some material to explore the battle of the sexes…\n\n…and Barbara Shermund left us poolside with a couple of eggheads…\n\n…on to our July 11, 1931 issue…\n\n…we find E.B. White taking his sweetheart, Katharine Angell White (referred to here as his “best girl”) out for a date at Coney Island…\n\n* * *\n\nOn the Waterfront\n\nThe 1954 film by the same name featured the murderous mob boss Johnny Friendly (Lee J. Cobb) who ruled the waterfront’s stevedores with an iron fist. The reality was just as brutal, if not more so along the Brooklyn waterfront in the early 20th century, where the reign of a crime boss was as short as his life span. Alva Johnston reports:\n\nDinnie Meehan’s widow, Anna Lonergan, had the distinction of being shot at the side of two successive husbands; after Meehan was murdered, Anna married “White Hand” gangster Harry Reynolds. Johnston, who referred to Anna Lonergan as “the Brunhild of the longshore cycle,” concluded his piece with a look at the “last of the great leaders,” Red Donnelly, also known as “Cute Charlie”…\n\n* * *\n\nThe Show Must Go On\n\nWith the glory days of vaudeville quickly receding into the past, Flo Ziegfeld was nevertheless determined to keep his “Follies” alive at his eponymous theatre. Robert Benchley stopped by for a look at the Ziegfeld Follies of 1931.\n\n* * *\n\nGross\n\nBack in the day some entrepreneurial types would kill a large whale, stuff it full of sawdust and formaldehyde, and then take it on the road to parade in front of gawkers with spare nickels in their pockets. E.B. White observed the fate of one such specimen:\n\n* * *\n\nFrom Our Advertisers\n\nThis small back page ad invited New Yorkers to the cooling breezes atop the Hotel Bossert in Brooklyn Heights, once referred to as the “Waldorf-Astoria of Brooklyn”…\n\nIts rooftop restaurant — the Marine Roof — was a famous hangout. When the Brooklyn Dodgers won the World Series in 1955, this is where they celebrated…\n\n…Dr. Seuss was still making a living illustrating advertisements for Flit insecticide…\n\n…”my eyes are up here”…says the woman who uses Coty brand lipstick…\n\n…on to our cartoonists, we have Garrett Price also examining the challenges of playing Ping-Pong…\n\n…Perry Barlow was at the seaside with a precocious beach-goer…\n\n…Carl Rose showed us a Boy Scout after his encounter with the Red Menace…\n\n…Kemp Starrett weighed the advantages of air travel…\n\n…Otto Soglow surprised us with this undercover operation…\n\n…and we end with James Thurber, and the price of literary fame…\n\nNext Time: The Black Eagle…\n\nZiegfeld’s Folly\n\nBroadway impresario Florenz Ziegfeld Jr knew how to pack a Broadway theater, and from 1907 to 1932 he staged a number of revues and plays (most notably Showboat) that featured lavish costumes and a bevy of chorus girls.\n\nWhen his latest show, Smiles, hit the stage of the Ziegfeld Theatre on Nov. 18, 1930, it was greeted by an audience that had endured the first year of the Great Depression. Ziegfeld’s entertainments, on the other hand, were more associated with the high times of the Roaring Twenties. So even the popular brother-sister dance team from Omaha — Fred and Adele Astaire — seemed a bit old hat.\n\nOr so it seemed to Robert Benchley, who observed in “The Wayward Press” that most of his readers could draw pictures of the Astaires from memory. But what really irked Benchley was the way William Randolph Hearst manipulated his mighty newspaper empire to promote Ziegfeld’s Smiles in a way that made the show appear to be the biggest hit of the year.\n\nZiegfeld Theatre was built with Hearst’s financial backing, so the media mogul was determined that the show would be a success, commanding his editors and writers to lavish praise on the tepid production, which would close in less than two months as a box office failure.\n\nFor the Astaires, they were nearing the end of their 27-year collaboration — Adele would retire from the stage in 1932 to marry Lord Charles Cavendish, and in 1934 Fred would pair up with Ginger Rogers for the first of nine films they would make together for RKO. Marilyn Miller, one of the most popular Broadway stars of the 1920s and early 1930s, would also seek her fortune in films, but would only make three. Alcoholism and persistent sinus infections would cut her life short in 1936 — she would die at age 37 from complications following nasal surgery.\n\nBenchley revealed how some of Hearst’s reporters responded to the edict from their boss:\n\nOn a related note, Ogden Nash also zeroed in on Ziegfeld’s latest show, turning the tables on religious zealots who found the Follies immoral. An excerpt:\n\nAnd finally, one more theater-related item: a drawing by Al Frueh highlighting the melodrama On The Spot, which ran from Oct. 29, 1930 through March 1931 at the Forrest Theatre.\n\n* * *\n\nIn the Dec. 6, 1930 “Notes and Comment,” E.B. White shared his observations on a new type of chair that doubled as a dog house…\n\n…and he wasn’t making it up, because the chair he described was featured in this ad from the same issue…\n\n* * *\n\nDrunk History\n\nIn the fall of 1930 Scribner’s magazine published a series of three articles titled “If Booth Had Missed Lincoln,” If Lee Had Not Won the Battle of Gettysburg,” and “If Napoleon Had Escaped to America.” The New Yorker’s James Thurber claimed to be the author of a fourth article, “If Grant Had Been Drinking At Appomattox.” An excerpt:\n\n* * *\n\nFrom Our Advertisers\n\nThe rolling pin was often deployed as a prop — especially in the comics — to illustrate marital discord; the makers of Hoffman ginger ale used the common trope to sell their fizzy drink…\n\n…for reference, Maggie gives it to Jiggs in this comic book cover from 1953…\n\n…the issue was stuffed with ads for Christmas shoppers, ranging from colorful plastic tumblers…\n\n…to “unforgettable” appliances…\n\n…to a variety of accessories at Wanamaker’s…\n\n…Macy’s offered this pajama and robe combination for (insufferable) little boys who “strive for sartorial effect”…\n\n…while Burdine’s of Miami urged snowbirds to purchase multiple wardrobes to remain fashionable throughout the winter season…\n\n…and in stark contrast, this ad appealed for donations to help the jobless…\n\n…our cartoons are supplied by Art Young…\n\n…the ever reliable Barbara Shermund…\n\n…and equally reliable Peter Arno…\n\n…and Helen Hokinson…\n\n…and we close with this gem by Garrett Price…\n\nNext Time: A Blue Angel…\n\nLights, Camera, Action\n\nComedian Ed Wynn began his long acting career on a vaudeville stage in 1903, and beginning in 1914 his giggly voice would delight Broadway crowds flocking to the Ziegfeld Follies. So when he stepped in front of a movie camera for a talking picture, it was something of a sensation.\n\nIt was not an easy transition for the stage veteran. As you can see from Morris Markey’s account below in “A Reporter at Large,” the early talkies presented all manner of challenges and restrictions for stage actors accustomed to a bit more freedom of movement and expression.\n\n* * *\n\nFalse Modesty?\n\nIn Morris Markey’s second installment of his profile on Charles Lindbergh, Markey suggested that Lindbergh’s aversion to publicity might be a pose…\n\n…and also wondered how much credit Lindbergh could take for sparking the aviation industry, given that flying was still an activity reserved for a very few…\n\n…Markey also noted a “lively rumor” that Lindbergh wanted to be President…\n\n…fortunately Lindbergh did not give truth to the rumor, or fulfill the alternate history created by Philip Roth in his 2004 novel The Plot Against America…\n\n* * *\n\nBad Moon Rising\n\nIn 1930 few, if anyone, were aware of Lindbergh’s proclivities toward nationalism and antisemitism. And lacking a crystal ball, Markey’s New Yorker colleague, Howard Brubaker, had little reason to be alarmed by the federal elections in Germany, which gave the Nazis the second largest number of seats in the Reichstag. In his “Of All Things” column, Brubaker quipped:\n\n* * *\n\nGummed to Death\n\nThe New Yorker’s John Mosher took in the latest travelogue to exploit and misrepresent life on the African savannah. Africa Speaks included a scene depicting a fatal attack on a “native boy” by a lion — an attack that was actually staged at a Los Angeles zoo and involved a toothless lion…\n\n* * *\n\nFrom Our Advertisers\n\nWhen Paris unveiled is spring and fall fashions, large department stores were always quick to respond with “copies”…\n\n…while the higher end boutiques offered originals to “poor little rich girls”…\n\n…perhaps some of these “poor little rich girls” socialized at the Panhellenic, a “club-hotel for college women”…\n\n…and here are some views of the Panhellenic House, circa 1929…\n\n…the makers of Old Gold cigarettes had some of the weirdest ads to push their smokes, including this one…\n\n…and one wonders what the world would be like (and especially the U.S.) if car buyers would have favored a more compact version of the motorcar going forward…\n\n…on to our cartoons…we begin with parenting tips from the posh set, courtesy Garrett Price…\n\n…Alan Dunn explored modern matrimony…\n\n…one of Helen Hokinson’s ladies demonstrated a unique taste in furniture…\n\n…Otto Soglow continued to explore humor in a wavy fashion…\n\n…and we close with this vertiginous view provided by Leonard Dove…\n\nNext Time: Leatherheads…\n\nIn Search of Yuletide Cheer\n\nConstruction workers line up for pay beside the first Rockefeller Center Christmas tree in New York in 1931. (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nE.B. White’s “Notes and Comment” column led off The New Yorker’s “Talk of the Town,” and as such helped set the tone for what was to follow in the magazine.\n\nFor the Dec. 14 issue White attempted to strike a positive note in the aftermath of the stock market crash, offering a few nuggets of hope for the holiday season:\n\nAlexander Woollcott, however, described his financial woes in his “Shouts and Murmurs” column, where he parodied newspapers that listed charity cases during the Christmas season:\n\nParis correspondent Janet Flanner noted how the ripples of the market crash were being felt in Paris: Americans no longer had wads of cash to lavish on booze, jewelry, antiques and real estate:\n\nFlanner added that despite the past boorish behavior of American tourists, the level of schaudenfreude among the French was remarkably low…\n\n* * *\n\nSinful Diversions\n\nFor yet another sign that the Roaring Twenties were decidedly over, it appeared that even “Sex” had run its course. Theater critic Robert Benchley noted that Mae West’s scandalous 1926 play inspired a spate of shows that had little new to offer, save for amping up the salacious content: A Primer for Lovers, The Amorous Antic, and Young Sinners. Audiences were unimpressed. A Primer for Lovers closed after just 24 performances, The Amorous Antic after just eight. Only Young Sinners would survive into the spring season.\n\n* * *\n\nFinal Bows\n\nTheater was changing in other ways too. In the late 19th and early 20th century audiences patronized various playhouses based more on their reputation and tradition than on a particular play. E.B. White, in the “Talk of the Town” noted the imminent passing of one such house, the Knickerbocker Theatre, slated for demolition in 1930. The 33-year-old theater was Broadway’s first to display a moving electric sign (1906).\n\nWhite noted that smaller venues like the Knickerbocker, with their own distinct character and clientele, were falling victim to big theater-owning corporations that introduced more homogeneity into the play-going scene. In White’s estimation just two old-timers remained:\n\nBoth buildings still stand. The New Amsterdam, constructed in 1902–03, is now the oldest theater on Broadway. In the 1910s and 1920s it hosted the Ziegfeld Follies on its main stage and the racier Ziegfeld Midnight Frolics on the building’s rooftop. The Music Box was constructed in 1921 by composer Irving Berlin and producer Sam H. Harris to house Berlin’s Music Box Revues.\n\n* * *\n\nStocks Down, Arno Up\n\nPeter Arno could be found all over the Dec. 14 issue: an ad promoting his new book Peter Arno’s Parade, a blurb in the book section touting the same…this ad for Peck & Peck featuring his handiwork…\n\n…in the cartoons, a full page with the economy as a theme…\n\n…and this submission that was doubtless inspired by Arno’s own home life and his brief, tempestuous marriage to New Yorker colleague Lois Long…\n\n…here’s a couple of comics featuring Milquetoast characters…this one by Garrett Price…\n\n…and another by Leonard Dove…\n\n…and two submissions from one of my favorite cartoonists, Barbara Shermund, so ahead of her time…\n\n…Helen Hokinson examined a physician’s bedside manner…\n\n…and I. Klein offered his take on the new economy…\n\n* * *\n\nWe move right along to the Dec. 21, 1929 issue, where things seemed to turn a bit more sour…\n\n…Elmer Rice’s serialized novel, A Voyage to Purilia, finally concluded in its 11th installment in the New Yorker…and E.B. White took on a more choleric disposition in his “Notes and Comment”…\n\nLois Long contributed a “Tables for Two” column, a feature that had become infrequent as she turned her full attentions to her fashion column “On and Off the Avenue.” In this installment of “Tables” we get her first mention of the market calamity…\n\n…Robert Benchley finally found something to like on Broadway, because Billie Burke was the star attraction…\n\n* * *\n\nViolin Prodigy 2.0\n\nThe New Yorker raved about the twelve-year-old violinist Yehudi Menuhin when he wowed audiences at the Berlin Philharmonic earlier in the year. So when the ten-year-old Ruggiero Ricci expertly fiddled with the Manhattan Symphony, well…\n\n* * *\n\nNamesake\n\nDespite the market crash, the skyline continued to change at a rapid pace, and as we enter the 1930s the city would add some of its most iconic buildings to the skyline. George Chappell, The New Yorker’s architecture critic, had this to say about the magazine’s “namesake”…\n\n* * *\n\nArt critic Murdock Pemberton continued his quest to make sense of the upstart Museum of Modern Art…\n\n…and the American artists showcased there…\n\n…I would add Edward Hopper, John Sloan, Lyonel Feininger, and Rockwell Kent (also displayed at the exhibition) but then again, I have the advantage of hindsight…\n\n* * *\n\nFrom Our Advertisers\n\nWe have more New Yorker cartoonists augmenting their income through advertising, including (once again) Rea Irvin for Knox Hatters…\n\n…Raeburn Van Buren for G. Washington’s instant coffee (also a client of Helen Hokinson’s)…\n\n…and Helen Hokinson for Frigidaire…\n\n…and on to cartoons for Dec. 21, Hokinson again…\n\n…and we end with Peter Arno, and another peek into marital bliss…\n\nNext Time: The Curtain Falls…\n\nCity of Glass\n\nThe New Yorker, via the pen of E.B. White, looked to the metropolis of the future in the Oct. 19, 1929 issue — to a city of glass towers that were ready to move from drafting table to reality. That is, until the stock market crash, just days away, which would put a heavy damper on those visions.\n\nWhite reported in “The Talk of the Town” that several “all-glass” buildings were in the works, including “four apartment houses of glass” designed by Frank Lloyd Wright:\n\nThe 1926 Pinaud cosmetics factory designed by Ely Jacques Kahn and Albert-Buchman was poised to get a three-story addition (by Kahn) constructed entirely of glass block, but the market crash likely killed the project. The Depression probably didn’t help Wright’s project either, which would have constituted his first buildings in New York City, and the first with all-glass exteriors.\n\nThanks to the Depression, and World War II, Gotham would have to wait 23 years for its houses of glass…\n\nand let’s not forget one of the most important post-war modernist statements to rise near the East River…\n\n* * *\n\nRising From the Ashes\n\nWhile most architects were looking to the future, some still gazed into the past, and in the case of Whitney Warren, rather bitterly. It was Warren who designed a new library in Louvain, Belgium, to replace one that was burned to ground by invading German troops during World War I. Around three hundred thousand books and a thousand manuscripts were destroyed in the fire, not to mention thousands of civilians who died during the invasion and occupation. The New Yorker seemed ready to forgive, but given the scale of the atrocity just fifteen years earlier, one could understand Warren’s obstinance:\n\nAnd to add insult to injury, the second library designed by Warren was also destroyed by the Germans in the World War II. What stands today is a restoration of that building.\n\n* * *\n\nBelles Lettres? Non!\n\nE.B. White, in his “Notes and Comment,” noted a new trend in the world of letters: celebrity authors. White lamented that the job of writing books and newspaper articles was being usurped by politicians, actors and athletes:\n\n* * *\n\nWhere Babies Come From\n\nFor his “A Reporter at Large” column, Morris Markey paid a visit to the Lying-In Society of New York, a maternity hospital now known as Rutherford Place. I include a few excerpts below to give some idea how times have changed in the past 89 years…\n\n…imagine, if you will, the scent of ether (then commonly used as an anesthetic) and other drugs as you entered the hospital (no air-conditioning or HVAC to whisk those odors away!)…\n\n…not to mention the sweat of anxious fathers banished from delivery or recovery rooms…\n\n…or hospital stays for mothers that averaged ten days…\n\n* * *\n\nShould Have Stayed Home\n\nDorothy Parker was dealing with a “baby’ of her in own, in this case a grown man with the conversational skills of brick wall. She related her experience in a casual titled, “But the One on the Right…” An excerpt:\n\n* * *\n\nMore Applause for Helen\n\nThe New Yorker continued to shine an approving light on the work of nightclub singer Helen Morgan, this time in her first talking picture, Applause:\n\nOn a sad note, Morgan’s real life had parallels to the film, including the abandonment of a child and a death due to alcohol and drugs — in the film Kitty overdoses on sleeping pills before a show; in real life Morgan would collapse onstage during a Chicago performance of George White’s Scandals. She would die of cirrhosis of the liver in 1941, at age 41.\n\nThere was no such applause from The New Yorker for another talkie, the screen adaptation of the popular Ziegfeld Broadway stage show Rio Rita:\n\n* * *\n\nFrom Our Advertisers\n\nThe Stewart fashion shop on Fifth Avenue featured a series of attractive, modern ads, these two appearing in the Oct. 19 and 26 issues…\n\nAccording to the terrific website Driving for Deco, “Stewart and Company broke away from the traditional department store layout. Instead of aisle after aisle of display cases the new store comprised many shops. These “shops” were not individually owned as in a present day mall. They were rooms or alcoves devoted to specific merchandise. The design of the shops and floors fell to several different interior design firms…”\n\nThe Depression brought an end to Stewart and Company, which went out of business in the spring of 1930. Later that year Bonwit Teller opened in the former Stewart Building. They would close their doors to business 49 years later.\n\nSadly the building was demolished in 1980 to make way for a monument to a massive ego: Trump Tower.\n\n…back to the ads, we have another image of a building that is now but a ghost (I am writing this on Halloween)…\n\n…speaking of luxury, these posh types seem to be almost lulled to sleep by RCA’s “Radiola Super-Heterodyne”…\n\n…and I throw in this ad from Milgrim for its use of the word “patrician” to appeal to the aristocratic yearnings of some New Yorker readers…\n\n…perhaps those patricians would have preferred a move to “aristocratic” Scarsdale, as the middle ad below suggests, or perhaps they would have chosen something more “unusual” in East Orange…\n\n…for reference, here is a Google street view image of 75 Prospect in East Orange, New Jersey…\n\n…and if you were of the upper classes, you probably would have wanted the latest in toothbrushes and “French” mouthwashes…\n\n…on to our illustrators and cartoonists, Isadore Klein looked in on the elections…\n\n…Peter Arno illustrated the plight of a hapless silent film actor…\n\n…and Helen Hokinson eavesdropped on a canine faux pas…\n\nNext Time: Prelude to a Crash…\n\nHooray for Hollywood\n\nMGM piled so many stars and gimmicks into the premiere of The Hollywood Revue of 1929 that even The New Yorker’s jaded film critic John Mosher had to admit he was entertained.\n\nAlthough today’s audiences would find the film quaint and corny (not to mention its tinny sound and crude editing), it was a big hit in 1929. A plotless revue featuring nearly all of MGM’s stars (Greta Garbo said no — she had a clause in her contract exempting her from such silly things; Lon Chaney, on the other hand, was in failing health), the film followed a variety format similar to such vaudeville productions as the Ziegfeld Follies. The Arthur Freed/Herb Nacio Brown song “Singin’ In the Rain” was introduced in this film, and would inspire the Gene Kelley musical by the same name 23 years later. A rarity for the time, the Hollywood Revue included four skits in an early version of Technicolor, including an all-cast performance of “Singing’ In the Rain.” Mosher observed:\n\nOne of the film’s color skits featured John Gilbert and Norma Shearer in a Romeo and Juliet parody filled with Jazz Age slang. It would mark the beginning of the end of Gilbert’s career and, sadly, his life. He was one of the silent era’s most popular leading men, but it was purported that his voice was not suited to the talkies. What really ended Gilbert’s career, however, was studio head Louis B. Mayer, who clashed with the actor both personally and professionally…\n\n…MGM deployed a number of stunts to generate publicity at the film’s New York premiere at the Astor Theatre, including a “human billboard” that featured scantily clad chorus girls precariously perched on a huge letters high above the theatre’s entrance. In a rather less dangerous stunt—during the movie’s “Orange Blossom Time” skit—a faint scent of orange blossoms wafted into the theatre. “The Talk of the Town” observed…\n\n* * *\n\nTechnological Adjustments\n\nHad you attended the premiere of The Hollywood Revue, perhaps you would have appreciated James Thurber’s observation that actors in talking pictures sound as if they are speaking into cracker boxes. In this hilarious piece (titled “The Roaring Talkies”), he proposed a solution. An excerpt:\n\n* * *\n\nA Happy Diversion\n\n“The Talk of the Town” (via Theodore Pratt) looked in on the hobbyists who raced model boats at Central Park’s Conservatory Lake, a happy tradition that began in the late 19th century and continues to this day:\n\nPratt also described the old wooden boathouse, which was replaced in 1954 with a somewhat grander structure, Kerbs Boathouse, where model boats are still stored…\n\n* * *\n\nOn the Other Hand…\n\nLeaving the cool and quiet of the park brought one quickly back into the dust and clamor of the metropolis. Pratt observed that the summer season lasted two weeks longer in the city than in the country, thanks to the city’s heat island effect— perhaps an unwelcome observation given the usually hot summer of 1929. Not only did the city’s heat extend the season, but it also kept the city enveloped in “an enormous cloud of dust”…\n\n* * *\n\nAlready Feeling Old?\n\nI found this “Talk” item curious for exploring the sentimental attachment some folks had developed for old cars from the 1910s, given those cars were barely twenty years old and cars in general hadn’t been in common use much longer…\n\n…as for another “Talk” item, I doubt modern New Yorker readers would find any humor in this observation:\n\n* * *\n\nOn to sillier things, Robert Benchley turned in a casual titled “Boost New York!” Benchley ridiculed a promotional brochure from the New York Merchants Association that touted various statistics in a manner reminiscent of the fictional George Babbitt. Benchley imagined how an Iowa couple might respond to such dazzling numbers:\n\n* * *\n\nA Drinking Life\n\nOccasionally I like to feature infrequent or one-time New Yorker contributors who are nearly lost to history. Frank Ward O’Malley (1875-1932), a reporter for the New York Sun from 1906-19, was known for his humorous stories. In 1928 he published a book titled The Swiss Family O’Malley. In this casual (titled “The Fatty Degeneration of Broadway”) from the Aug. 24 issue, O’Malley described an alcohol intervention of sorts and then his fall off the wagon. Here are the opening and closing paragraphs, along with his photo circa 1910s.\n\n* * *\n\nFrom Our Advertisers\n\nThis week we have an advertisement for the Drake Apartment Hotel, claiming to be the “smartest” in New York. Note how they employed what seems to be the same pointy-nosed, haughty couple that we saw last week (below) who endorsed the Park Lane (I want to believe there is a subtle joke here)…\n\n…just 25 years removed from the Wright Brothers’ flight at Kitty Hawk, advertisers were treating flying as though it were routine…\n\n…and this young woman seemed to think flying was nothing more than “playing ring around the rosy with the clouds”…\n\n…I like the reviews included in this bookseller’s ad, especially the first one for the book Ex-Wife by Anonymous (it was written by Ursula Parrott, a writer of romantic fiction)…\n\n…our illustrations include Abe Birnbaum’s contribution to the casuals section (breaking up the copy of one of Josie Turner’s Elsie Dinsmore parodies)…\n\n…Reginald Marsh illustrated the late summer beach scene at Coney Island…\n\n…and for kicks this nice little filler by Constantin Alajalov…\n\n…thanks to the skills of The New Yorker’s first layout artist, Popsy Whitaker, we have this whimsical pairing of Otto Soglow and Dorothy Parker…\n\n…Mary Petty contributed a cartoon that looks contemporary…\n\n…Peter Arno paid a visit to the doctor’s office…\n\n…and commented on his life as a new father…the woman holding the baby was doubtless inspired by his wife, New Yorker columnist Lois Long…\n\n…for reference, Peter Arno and Lois Long are pictured here with baby daughter Patricia Arno in 1928…Lois clearly had a better grasp on the situation than Arno had imagined…\n\n…Alice Harvey eavesdropped on a conversation between teenagers…\n\n…and like Arno, Leonard Dove had two cartoons in this issue…here an editor finds the former Prohibition enforcer no longer newsworthy…\n\n…and over on the East Side, rumors of gentrification…\n\nNext Time: A Carnival in the Air…\n\nNot Your Grandpa’s Tammany Hall\n\nFor more than a century, a political organization known as the Tammany Society ruled New York City politics with an iron fist. Founded in 1786 (and named for Tamanend, a chief in the Lenni-Lenape nation), by the mid 19th century it rapidly expanded its political control by earning the loyalty of the city’s fast-growing immigrant population, particularly the Irish.\n\nThe Tammany Society proved an efficient machine for controlling state Democratic politics as well as New York City elections. Through its use of patronage to reward loyal precinct leaders, it also became a center for big-time graft. Most of us know a bit about Tammany thanks to school history books that focused on the deep corruption of William “Boss” Tweed, who was brought down by the press and by Harper’s Weekly cartoonist Thomas Nast in the 1870s. Tammany Hall would survive the scandal, and in the 1920s would still pull the strings of politicians including Gov. Al Smith and New York City Mayor Jimmy Walker.\n\nTammany had several homes, but during its most notorious years it was located in a circa 1812 hall (then called a “wigwam”) and later in an 1868 building on 14th Street, between Third and Fourth avenues. The July 13, 1929 “The Talk of the Town” noted the recent demolition of that old hall and the opening of a new headquarters on 17th Street:\n\n“Talk” found the new building unimpressive; it seemed to signal that the old political machine was losing some of its luster:\n\nIndeed, “Talk” found the building to be a somewhat austere, hosed-down affair, far removed from its grander past:\n\nFor further evidence that the more austere Tammany Hall was nevertheless alive and well in 1929, another “Talk” item noted the organization’s continued influence behind the scenes in local politics:\n\nThe 1930s marked the beginning of the end for Tammany Hall, when reform-minded Democrats such as President Franklin Roosevelt and New York’s Republican Mayor Fiorello La Guardia (supported by Roosevelt on a “Fusion” ticket) dismantled Tammany’s system of patronage. The Tammany Society abandoned its headquarters in 1943 when it found it no longer had the funds to maintain the hall. Bought by a local affiliate of the International Ladies Garment Workers Union, it later housed the New York Film Academy and the Union Square Theatre until 2016, when it underwent extensive remodeling to make way for new office and retail space.\n\n* * *\n\nYour Two Cents Worth\n\n“Talk” also commented on the introduction of a new two-cent stamp that featured an image of Thomas Edison’s Mazda lamp, marking the celebration of fifty years of electric light. The magazine cheekily suggested that in the world of technological progress, there was nothing new under the sun:\n\n* * *\n\nAmericans in Paris\n\nThe New Yorker featured this humorous bit by a writer identified as “Guido” (I assume it is one of E.B. White’s many pseudonyms), who looked in on the chatter of various Parisian cafés and bars:\n\n* * *\n\nHit and Miss\n\nThe New Yorker generally reveled in the good times Florenz Ziegfeld brought to the stage, but his latest effort, Show Girl, proved a bit of a disappointment (more evidence, in my view, that folks were tiring of the decade-long party known as the Roaring Twenties):\n\n* * *\n\nOne of a Kind\n\nNew Yorker sportswriter Niven Busch, Jr. provided a nice write-up on golfer Bobby Jones, the most successful amateur ever to compete in the sport. An attorney by trade, the unassuming Jones had just won his third U.S. Open (he would win again in 1930). In all he would play in 31 majors, winning 13 of them and finishing in the top 10 an incredible 27 times. After retiring at age 28 in 1930 he helped design the Augusta National Golf Club and co-founded the Masters Tournament. An excerpt:\n\n* * *\n\nAn Odd Bit\n\nLooking around the July 13 issue, let’s see what nighttime diversions were being touted by The New Yorker in their “Going on About Town” section (note the warning on the last item):\n\n* * *\n\nFrom Our Advertisers\n\nThe makers of Pond’s cold cream continued to roll out endorsements from high society with this testimonial from Jane Kendall Mason (1909-1980), the newlywed wife of George Grant Mason, an executive with Pan American Airways in Cuba.\n\nIn 1925, the 17-year-old Jane made her formal debut in Washington society. After a visit with Grace Goodhue Coolidge, the first lady famously declared that Jane was “the most beautiful girl ever to enter the White House.”\n\nAfter their marriage, the Masons became friends with Ernest and Pauline Hemingway, and introduced the Hemingways into Cuban society. Jane could hunt, fish, and hold her liquor, and, according to Ernest Hemingway, she was the most uninhibited person he’d ever met. So naturally they had a torrid, tempestuous, two-month affair that ended with Jane’s attempted suicide (she leapt from a balcony that was not high enough to do the job).\n\nHemingway supposedly used Jane as a model for the cruel-hearted Margot Macomber in The Short, Happy Life of Francis Macomber, in which the title character—trapped in a sad marriage to a wealthy but spineless American (George?)—accidentally shoots her husband in the head while on safari. She is also considered to be the model for the sex-obsessed Helene Bradley in Hemingway’s novel To Have and Have Not— a character also married to a rich but spineless husband.\n\nMark Walston, writing for the July-August issue of Bethesda Magazine, notes that the mean-spirited Hemingway “sent Jane drafts of his work, taunting and tormenting her with his venomous and thinly veiled portraits.” According to Walston, Jane divorced Mason in 1940, and one month later married John Hamilton, former executive director of the Republican National Committee. After that brief marriage she wed George Abell, columnist for The Baltimore Sun and Washington Times-Herald. Her fourth and final husband was Arnold Gingrich, founder of Esquire and editor of Coronet magazines. Jane died in 1980. On her tombstone is her self-penned epitaph: “Talents too many, not enough of any.”\n\nOn to our next ad, which featured an interesting exchange between two men who discuss the fortunes of a guy named Cecil Barnes, retired at age 33 and owner of a new personal airplane…\n\n…and we segue into our cartoons, featuring a mother and child (drawn by Carl Kindl) probably flying on one of those Sikorskys…\n\n…Rollin Kirby looked in on a tailor’s shop (this is one of only two drawings published by Kirby in The New Yorker)…\n\n…a note on Kirby, a three-time Pulitzer winner: outraged by the passage of Prohibition laws, Kirby created one of his most famous characters, “Mr. Dry,” which he introduced to readers of the New York World in January 1920…\n\nYou can read more about Rollin Kirby and Mr. Dry here.\n\n…Roland Baum peeked in on a reluctant stargazer…\n\n…and to close, this little filler drawing of a hot dog vendor by Constantin Alajalov…\n\nNext Time: On the Flatfoot Beat…\n\nThat Moderne Feeling\n\nA defining moment for Art Deco design in America occurred at New York’s Metropolitan Museum of Art during a 1929 exhibition that showcased everything from household furnishings to garden design.\n\nBefore we delve into the Met’s exhibition, The Architect and the Industrial Arts, a quick note about the New Yorker’s Theodore Haupt-illustrated cover, which referenced the annual Six-Day Cycling Race that was taking place at the Madison Square Garden Velodrome. The event, which began at the old Madison Square Garden in 1891 and lasted until 1950, featured a beer garden (after Prohibition) in the center of the oval and drew such celebrities as Bing Crosby, Barbara Stanwyck and Peggy Joyce. It was said that Crosby even paid the hospital bills of riders who fell during the race.\n\nThe March 9 issue was lively with another contribution from Groucho Marx (“Press Agents I Have Known”) and an Alexander Woollcott-penned profile of playwright and screenwriter Charles Gordon MacArthur (husband of stage actress Helen Hayes and father of James “Book ’em Danno” MacArthur).\n\nBut as the blog title suggests, it was also filled with articles and ads that told of a city embracing all things new and modern, including a piece by architecture critic George S. Chappell on the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s eleventh Exhibition of Contemporary American Design, titled The Architect and the Industrial Arts. It was curated by the Met’s Richard F. Bach, who organized 15 annual exhibitions of contemporary industrial art at the museum between 1917 and 1940.\n\nThe 1929 exhibition of Art Deco works was the biggest yet, inspired by the Art Moderne movement in Europe and particularly the 1925 Paris Exposition International des Arts Decoratifs et Industriels). The Met exhibition, wrote Chappell, “should not be missed”…\n\nChappell found the exhibit to be “stimulating,” although he hoped designers in the future would “curb cleverness” and focus more on fundamentals:\n\nWriting in the February 1929 Bulletin of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, curator Richard S. Bach posed bold questions for this new age: “What is the tempo of our day? What are the dominant elements of our culture, our activities, our thinking? Is this a speed age or are we sedate? Have we time to be dignified and stately about frills or are we air-minded? Do we wait for months, as once all did, for the silkworm to complete his labors before beginning to make thread from his cocoon…or (do we) make a few bales of vegetable silk out of chemically treated wood fiber between breakfast and lunch as a regular chore of a business week-day? And is this the mechanistic millennium which shrivels the soul and makes mockery of imagination, or are these fabulous industries, these automatic instruments of production, the means of bringing within range of vision the real potentialities of our crowded lives and of interpreting our aspirations and achievements?\n\nPumping Iron Into the Sky\n\nThe architecture firm Starrett & van Vleck saw the “real potentialities of our crowded lives” when they designed a new Art Deco skyscraper to house the Downtown Athletic Club. Writing in Lost City News, Mary Hohlt cites the architect Rem Koolhaas, who sees the Downtown Athletic Club as “the ideal of a hyper-reality in the burgeoning urban form of hyper-density and congestion.” The Club is “the everything-at-your-fingertips self-improvement incubator for men…It is a place for men to indulge on self-improvement; to better themselves in a place only the constructed, hyper-reality of Manhattan can provide.”\n\nHohlt writes that Koolhaas sees the Downtown Athletic Club as a sterile place: “Towering in the sky, the Club removes men from the rest of the world and allows them a kind of aesthetic improvement that cannot be passed on.” E.B. White took a less jaded view in this “Talk of the Town” segment:\n\nAnother New Yorker who saw the “real potentialities of our crowded lives” was insurance salesman Milton A. Kent, who in 1928-29 erected a brick and terra-cotta Art Deco tower that could park 1,000 cars using an automatic elevator system.\n\nOnce again E.B. White was on hand to render this observation for “Talk”…\n\n* * *\n\nDeath of a Can-Can Dancer\n\nThe sad death of Louise Weber, aka La Goulue, was announced in Janet Flanner’s “Letter from Paris” column. Weber was a can-can dancer at the Moulin Rouge in Paris and a model for some of Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec’s most famous cabaret paintings. Flanner wrote of La Goulue’s rise to fame…\n\n…and her sad downfall into a life of poverty among the rag-pickers:\n\n* * *\n\nFrom Our Advertisers\n\nAn advertisement on page 45 for Mohawk carpets featured two Cockney charwomen admiring the new carpets at the General Motors headquarters:\n\nA corresponding note: Shreve & Lamb’s 1927 General Motors Building was the hub of Columbus Circle’s Automobile Row. A hideous 2012 remodel, which clad the entire structure in reflective glass, has rendered the former landmark unrecognizable:\n\nGetting back to all things “moderne,” these facing ads on pages 8-9 offered some new looks for spring…\n\n…and in the cartoons, a tongue-in-cheek vision of a modern high-rise by Al Frueh, prompted by the news that Florenz Ziegfeld planned to build a 44-story building in his native Chicago. Thanks to the market crash later in the year, it was never realized.\n\nIn drawings sprinkled across pages 24-25, Helen Hokinson examined various approaches to tax season, including these two examples…\n\n…and finally, Peter Arno caught a theatre performer with his pants down…\n\nNext Time: Babbitt Babble…"
