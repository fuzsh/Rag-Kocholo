        "text": "Yesterday was Christmas Eve, which also happened to be the first night of Hanukkah. One of the gifts from my uncle was an edition of “Roger Ebert’s Movie Home Companion” from 1988. This book was sitting on his shelf for probably 20+ years when he took it down and thought that it would make a perfect holiday gift for his only nephew. I thought that this would start off the beginning of a series of posts where one film critic (yours truly) goes after one of the most famous and recognized of all film critics (Ebert) and takes apart their review piece by piece to see where he went wrong. I thought I would begin with one of my favorite films of all time; one that I revisit from time to time on Youtube. Lewis Gilbert’s adaptation of Willy Russell’s stage play “Educating Rita” seemed to be something that Roger Ebert would fall in love with, but surprisingly I was wrong.\n\nMichael Caine plays Frank Bryant, a literature professor with a weakness for the drink. He has a wife who lives hundreds of miles away and a girlfriend named Julia (Jeananne Crowley) who is having an affair with his colleague Brian (Michael Williams). He has lost his spark for teaching, has failed as a writer and has nothing to look forward to in his boring life. In walks in his tutorial student Rita (Julie Walters) a cockney hairdresser wanting to get her basic education degree. Rita is married to the uncouth Denny (Malcolm Douglas) who is against her educative ambitions and whose priority is to start a family. Frank’s office becomes a refuge where the two figures can discuss literature and their own troubles and the student/teacher relationship blossoms where one helps the other live life to the fullest.\n\nEbert’s approach to his critique was how Russell adapted his stage play to the screen. As a two character play, Russell’s purpose was to exclusively show the evolution of Frank and Rita’s relationship from teacher and student to confidants and potential romantic partners. It also shows Frank’s desire to quit teaching and devote his life to publishing poetry and Rita’s hesitation towards starting a family, during which she secretly takes the pill behind Denny’s back. Ebert believes that including the other characters like Julia, Brian, Denny and Rita’s Mahler loving flat partner Trisha (Maureen Lipman) were unnecessary distractions. He did say that Caine’s portrayal of Frank was “weary and kind” and “funny and self-hating”, something that is indisputable, given the amazing performance from this legend. Overall, Ebert saw that Russell’s uneven screenplay and the characters having “delivering speeches, tak[ing] decisions and mak[ing] decisions” because of the way the plot was set up, made “Educating Rita” worthy of a two star review.\n\nI cannot help but see that a veteran film critic like Roger Ebert completely missed the point of the film. To begin with, the film is adapted from the play, which means that it provides license to give each character a visual backstory as opposed to them recounting their life to the other. I thought it was great to see why Frank copes with alcohol and why Rita wants to enrich herself culturally and scholarly. And for the way that both characters assert themselves by “delivering speeches…” which Ebert disliked, it only made the audience cherish Frank and Rita a lot more. It also provided the opportunity for Caine and Walters to put all the passion and emotion into their performances which were both Oscar-worthy, even as they both won Golden Globes and BAFTA awards.\n\nTo finish off this post, Ebert had the gall to see the last scene of Frank and Rita at the airport as a “cop out…by the screenplay”. Far from it. When I first saw this scene, I saw it as a coda to a symphony of struggling and perseverance. Rita has passed her exams and Frank goes back to writing poetry. They both don’t need the other’s guidance and instead are free to restart their lives respectively. It has to be in the history of cinema, one of the most gratifying endings to any film of any genre that I have seen. It’s a happily ever after without the two of them getting together romantically. Frank and Rita totally deserve their happy endings wholeheartedly, but they didn’t deserve a mediocre review from Roger Ebert.\n\n10/10\n\nFilm sequels are usually one of two things in relation to the original source. Either they are better or just as good as the first, such as in this case of “The Empire Strikes Back” and “The Godfather Part 2″ or doesn’t hold up to the original. Never have I seen a film and its sequel where the second feature was much better than the first one which was less than stellar. French Canadian director Denys Arcand’s 1986 film “The Decline Of The American Empire” and his 2003 follow up “The Barbarian Invasions” are only tied together due to the fact that they share the same core characters, but in its dramatic presentation and pathos portrayals, they are polar opposites.\n\n“The Decline Of The American Empire” focuses on 8 academics, 4 men and 4 women, staying over in the country for the weekend. There is married couple Rémy (Rémy Girard) and Louise (Dorothée Berryman), Remy’s two mistresses and fellow colleagues Diane (Louise Portal) and Dominique (Dominique Michel), Claude (Yves Jacques), Alain (Daniel Brière), Pierre (Pierre Curzi) and his girlfriend Danielle (Genevieve Roux). The first half deals with the women and men separately discussing all taboo issues openly among each other. Topics as diverse as sex, adultery, history and left wing politics make their way into the conversation in addition to flashbacks of each character’s past experiences. The second half has both men and women at the table and in bed discussing the same things as before. A ninth visitor Mario (Gabriel Arcand) who knows Diane enters the picture and messes with things.\n\n“The Barbarian Invasions” picks up 17 years later. Rémy and Louise are now divorced for obvious reasons. Rémy is dying of a terminal illness and now must make amends with Louise, his businessman son Sébastien (Stéphane Rousseau) and his womanizing ways. Reappearing are his intellectual friends that we met at that dinner (except Alain, Danielle and Mario) and in addition we are also introduced to Diane’s drug addicted daughter Nathalie (Marie-Josée Croze) who bonds with Rémy over smoking heroin, which he takes for strictly medicinal purposes. Again, the intellectual conversations take place, but are more PG-13 in content than before.\n\nThe big problem with “The Decline Of The American Empire” is that none of the characters seem human. They seem like robots who spout historical information as if they’re teaching a class nonstop and perverts who think of sex when they’re at the gym or cooking dinner. I wanted to see some humanistic emotions in the characters. The only one who had that was Yves Jacques’ gay character Claude, who fears that he has an STD, after he urinates blood. Other than that, Arcand created cookie cutter characters that cannot be distinguished from one another. That’s absolute boredom.\n\n“The Barbarian Invasions” humanizes these same characters that we once saw as chatty snobs. As Rémy’s health deteriorates, we see him as a man of regrets and heartache. He tries bonding with his son whom he hardly raised and falling in love all over again with Louise. Diane’s relationship with her drug addicted daughter Nathalie, also plays a dominant part in the drama, where a mother fears that her only daughter is lying dead in the gutter or in a drug den. The intellectual banter only plays a small part in the story, but at the very least it doesn’t distract from the main plot. If anything, it adds some comedic mood to an otherwise depressing story.\n\n“The Decline Of The American Empire” seemed like “My Dinner With Andre” X 1000. “The Barbarian Invasions” was nothing short of a tearjerker by the film’s end. That’s what I consider to be a complete 180. The Academy Awards would give the better received sequel an Oscar for Best Foreign Film, making it the first and only Canadian film to win the honor. It had also nominated its predecessor 17 years earlier in the same category. The one other nomination “The Barbarian Invasions” received was for Best Original Screenplay which it lost to the favorite “Lost In Translation”. The notable omission was Rémy Girard’s heartbreaking performance, which should have taken the place of that year’s Best Actor winner, which was Sean Penn for “Mystic River”. I think it would have made Girard a bigger name in the U.S. and in Europe, which unfortunately he is not. I do hope he receives that opportunity to branch out in a later film.\n\nTDotAE: 5.5/10\n\nTBI: 9/10\n\nThe Golden Age Of Hollywood remains as the apex of cinematic gold. Even after its end in the 1950s, newer generations of actors filled the void with their own brand of acting, but nothing beats the era of Bogie, Gable, Tracy and Hepburn. In 1987, a nostalgic reunion of Old Hollywood legends took place in the form of a stage play by a playwright named David Berry. Lindsay Anderson’s adaptation of Berry’s magnum opus “The Whales Of August” has the appearance of an average chick flick, but the carefully chosen cast that includes a combined 500 years of acting royalty is nothing short of marvelous to witness.\n\nOn Maine’s desolate Cliff Island, two elderly widowed sisters named Sarah and Libby (Lillian Gish and Bette Davis) live in a ocean side house full of pictures and memories. Sarah is independent and soft spoken, whereas Libby is blind and crabby. This leads to Libby being resistant of Sarah’s fondness, which creates hostility and distance between the two of them. Witnesses to the sisters’ strenuous relationship are long time friend Tisha (Ann Southern) and Russian emigre Mr. Maranov (Vincent Price), who Sarah has a crush on. Sarah and Libby try to find the way to patch up their once close relationship/friendship in their idyllic childhoods where they saw the whales jump out of the water every summer. It means having to confront their demons and putting their troubles aside, just to make the best of the little time they have together.\n\nComparing this to Lindsay Anderson’s past films such as “If…”, “O Lucky Man” and “This Sporting Life”, “The Whales Of August” is probably among one of the weakest in his filmography. This is probably due to the play to screen transition. In some cases, the adaptation can work such as Anderson’s filmed version of “In Celebration” which I consider to be a masterpiece that makes it feel like you have that front row seat at a Broadway theater. With “The Whales Of August”, that illusion of sitting in the theater was not as apparent, so what you see is pretty much a chamber piece without rapid movement or plot changes. It’s just a story about getting old.\n\nWatching these actors perform their magic was the most mesmerizing experience of it all. Lillian Gish, at 94 years old, capped off a 75 year career with a heartwarming performance as Sarah, as if she never lost her love of the craft. Bette Davis, who had suffered a stroke the previous year, also managed to be her usual cankerous self in portraying Libby’s haggard self. Ann Southern’s Tisha provided a comedic relief to the sappy backdrop. I think in all our lives, there’s a Tisha type person who is gregarious and positive about their day to day life. And then there is Vincent Price, who proved that a contemporary, non-monster dramatic role was right up his alley. As Mr. Maranov, he was gentlemanly, charming and flamboyant. When you think about it, only he could have fulfilled this role. I can’t picture anyone else who could have fit his shoes and stand out like Vincent Price.\n\nStrangely enough, Ann Southern’s Best Supporting Actress nod was the sole nomination that “The Whales Of August” received. Sure, she was great and deserving of being in the top 5, but Lillian Gish and Vincent Price were the standouts. Luckily, all three received Independent Spirit Award nominations and Gish won the National Board of Review for Best Actress (tying with Holly Hunter for Broadcast News). Davis, Gish, Southern and Price, remain 4 of the greatest members of Hollywood’s Golden Age and seeing them in one film in their old ages is a treat. They sure don’t make talent like them anymore.\n\n7.5/10\n\n1994 was the year of two films that dealt with non-linear plots. The first is one that every cinephile has probably seen at least once in their lives; Quentin Tarantino’s “Pulp Fiction”. It’s a film that mixes McDonald’s, drug overdoses, retro diners and hostage taking among other well known motifs. The second, which is the subject of this post takes a more serious approach through its take on the ongoing conflict in the former Yugoslavia back in the early 1990s. Macedonian director Milcho Manchevski’s directorial debut “Before The Rain” opens the eyes of a lay audience who have no comprehension as to why such genocidal atrocities could occur.\n\nThe plot is divided into 3 parts, which sort of act as short features if separated. First there is “Words” which focuses on a mute monk named Kiril (Grégoire Colin) who hides an Albanian girl named Zamira (Labina Mitevska) wanted by the Bosnians for murder. “Faces” is about Anne (Katrin Cartlidge) a photo editor covering the Bosnian conflict, who is torn between two men; her husband Nick (Jay Villiers) and colleague Aleksander (Rade Serbedzija). Finally, “Pictures” has Aleksander return to Macedonia where he falls in love with widow Hana (Silvija Stojanovska) while trying to make sense of the chaos and trying to make peace with the Bosnians and Albanians. Characters from each part make appearances in other scenes which affects the pace of the plot and the fates that each protagonist faces.\n\nThe motto that gets passed around is “the circle is never round”, which is fitting considering how uneven the stories are. Characters who are killed, suddenly reappear in future scenes, that seem like flashbacks but aren’t. Events that play out in a certain scene, wind up occurring a second time in a different location. By the last scene which is similar to the end of the first part, you think everything has come full circle, when really it’s a completely different turn of events. That circle winds up becoming a squiggly line of confusion just like the chaos going on in a civil war of ethnic cleansing and heartache. Director Manchevski, is a mad genius when it comes to picking at the audience’s brains, as if they’ve witnessed some sort of an illusion. Such a technique can throw off the viewer in seeing which event really happened and which event is pure fiction.\n\nEach of the three parts seemed like they could have been done by a different director, like other compilation films have done. Manchevski starts off in “Words” as slow moving suspense about eluding the forces of evil. “Faces” acts as a light drama about juggling work and romance, appropriately reminiscent of a Mike Leigh drama because Katrin Cartlidge was a regular player in his films. “Pictures” rounds off everything as a mix of comedy and war drama. And the beautiful part is that these genres just seemed to flow into one another with ease. For someone whose work before this, consisted of music videos and commercials, this is mighty impressive.\n\n“Before The Rain” would have a huge impact on the Venice Film Festival where it won an astounding 10 awards, 9 for its director Milcho Manchevski and the Pasinetti Award for Best Actor given to Rade Serbedzija, whose performance as Aleksander was amazing in every respect. It also received an Academy Award nomination for Best Foreign Film, which is interesting considering that 1/3 of the film was in English. It also won various European awards for Best Picture as well as the Independent Spirit Award for Best Foreign Film. “Before The Rain” is a multi-faceted unabridged look at the horrors of ethnic cleansing that leaves everyone spellbound.\n\n8/10\n\nBack in the mid 20th century, a folklorist named Alan Lomax traveled the world recording and video taping a myriad of native music. This varied from creole jazz in New Orleans to traditional folksongs of the United Kingdom and Ireland. Lomax’s purpose was to preserve these obscure treasures to educate future generations on the diverse musical genres that unfortunately does not get played on commercial radio. French director Tony Gatlif, expanded on this aforementioned musical preservation with his 1993 documentary “Safe Journey” aka “Latcho Drom” (the more preferable title). Beautifully photographed and directed, the viewer gets a front row seat to various performances all filmed in authentic real time.\n\nThe subject of this documentary are the large ethic nomadic group known as the Romani. Detailing a journey from India to Spain, the viewer acts as a participant of the sojourn by embracing the different music, dances and customs of other Romani members in places such as Hungary, Romania and Slovakia. These locations act as the various routes taken during this journey, therefore serving two purposes. Participants include tribal dances by the Kalbelia of India and the Ghawazi of Egypt. The journey also goes to random locations such a train station in Hungary, a Romanian village and various Turkish cafes. I think of it as a mix between “Fantasia” and a National Geographic travelogue.\n\nThis isn’t your typical documentary. No one is interviewed nor narrating the action like a David Attenborough nature special. Basically, everything is told through the various musical numbers. That could be off putting to someone not familiar with the Romani people and their music or just not into unconventional documentaries. That’s why “Latcho Drom” is not for everyone, because of its appeal to a specific audience who enjoy various types of international music and cinema. That just about satisfies it for someone like me.\n\nI had never heard of “Latcho Drom” or its filmmaker Tony Gatlif before this film was recommended to me by a friend. I am very grateful that such a suggestion was brought to my attention. “Latcho Drom” is a once in a lifetime cinematic extravaganza that stands in a class of its own. It is perfect in its editing of the musical score with quick and slow paced movements as well as shifts in the moods and tempos like a full length symphony. Out of respect to this innovation, no other director should ever put forth a documentary identical or similar to Gatlif’s unique vision. Almost like how CGI animated films after “Toy Story” and other Pixar features cheapened the whole genre, carbon copies of musical travelogues bombarding theater audiences would make this genre inevitably stale.\n\n“Lachto Drom” was given 4 awards from around the world. They included Best Picture at the Montreal Film Festival and special citations from the Munich Film Festival and the National Society Of Film Critics”, the latter of them acknowledging it “for avant-garde and experimental cinema”. Its most important award was the top prize in the Un Certain Regard section of the Cannes Film Festival in its release year. It’s almost criminal that “Lachto Drom” does not have the worldwide impact that other films share. I really believe that young millennials should put aside the Justin Bieber and One Direction CDs and MP3s, watch this film and actually listen to music with melody, harmony and passion.\n\n9/10"
