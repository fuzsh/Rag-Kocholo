        "text": "From the humble beginnings arising out of the fire service, former Lieutenant Curtis Massey saw a tremendous lack of pre-incident planning which time and again led to preventable tragedies.\n\nHe is proud to have been the officer on the region’s busiest ladder company- Ladder 2, at the time the state’s 2nd busiest ladder unit. His desire to enhance the scene commander’s decision-making capabilities and therefor reduce critical guesswork led to the formation in 1986 of Massey Enterprises, now known as Massey Emergency Management.\n\nHis deep understanding of building systems and fireground tactics and strategy provided the fundamentals to create the most comprehensive pre-plans ever made. It all began with just Curtis and his business partner Paul Brandt - a Battalion Chief on the same department. Plans were drawn on paper with pens, pencils, magic markers, rulers and compasses.\n\nThe pre-plan’s text was done on a typewriter and vital sections were emphasized with various colors of highlighters.\n\nThe papers were then punched and placed into red 3-ring binders with a bold FD logo on the cover.\n\nThis, in turn, evolved into larger white binders with each building’s photograph on the cover (all taken by Curtis) with the building name on the left and “Pre-Fire Plan” on the right as borders.\n\nThen extra floor plan booklets were added for fire crews and everything was placed in a high-security steel vault, called a \"Knox Box,\" located in the client's fire command center, typically accompanied with building master keys.\n\nStarting out in his home town area, Curtis and Paul began pre-planning high-rises in downtown Norfolk, VA.\n\nAchieving quick success, Curtis decided to test the waters in the big city, so he got on a plane and went to Chicago. On his first visit, he landed an office building on Michigan Ave.\n\nHe also landed the massive 64 story/2.4 MSF First National Bank Building in Chicago’s Loop.\n\nOn his 3rd trip to Chicago, Curtis happens to be in a Loop high rise when a fire breaks out. Curtis jumps into action and takes charge of the incident. By the time the CFD arrives on scene, he has the fire knocked down and all affected tenants safely evacuated. The CFD issues Curtis an official commendation letter for his actions.\n\nAlmost overnight, the business became the world’s leading life safety consulting firm. Massey Plans rapidly became the industry standard, finding their way into the fire command centers of many of the most iconic landmarks, tallest buildings and largest complexes in North America.\n\nCurtis’s obsession with life safety and more specifically firefighter safety, having lost 13 friends in the line of duty, drove him to become one of the fire service’s top instructors, specializing in high-rise operations. He has personally trained most of the biggest cities on the topic for free and has also selflessly given his time assisting them in rewriting their high-rise standard operating procedures, which speaks volumes for his credibility in the fire service.\n\nHe also created the revolutionary concept of “Rapid Ascent Teams” just after 9/11, which has now been adopted by most big cities.\n\nThe Rapid Ascent Team concept was credited with achieving over 100 rescues at the LaSalle Bank Building Fire in Chicago in 2004.\n\nHe also responded to assist with the World Trade Center collapse on 9/11\n\nHe also helped in New Orleans during the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, two of the most important and impactful events in US history. He is clearly not motivated by the pursuit of money.\n\nHiring current and former fire officers and SWAT team commanders from big cities throughout the U.S., Massey possesses over 400 years of first responder “boots on the ground” experience at a very high level that is unparalleled in the life safety industry.\n\nIn 2012, Curtis then conceived of an advanced mobile application that would assist building staff personnel in managing incidents of all types via expert-written articles as emergency guides complimented by critical electronic schematics.\n\nInitially intended for civilians, it quickly became a huge hit with fire and police departments (special operations units) and has now been adopted by most major city agencies in the US, coast to coast.\n\nTheir cutting-edge scene management PDF annotation capability has taken it to an entirely new level. The existence of the Massey App has now been placed into the emergency dispatch centers of many cities to date as a “dispatch prompt” for responding units. Now that’s credibility!\n\nMassey Plans and Massey Apps have been used on countless emergencies of all kinds and prevented the loss of many lives. Property losses alone that were vastly reduced are truly incalculable.\n\nWith the release of Massey’s 3.0 App built with the needs of first responders in mind, the firm will have succeeded virtually overnight in altering how emergencies are handled and life and death decisions are made in communities everywhere.\n\nIn 2020, Massey released its new online Tenant Training Portal to support its clients with their essential preparedness needs, especially important during the Covid-19 era when in-person training capabilities are limited. The platform allows all the information sharing a building manager needs to provide to occupants for emergencies with 6 distinct courses and a quiz for each topic. Massey has also built virtual fire drills for office buildings."
