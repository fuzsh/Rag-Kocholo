        "text": "A major illness or injury can leave a person limited in his or her ability to function independently. The simplest tasks may seem like impossible tasks. Rehabilitation is a process that assists patients in learning to take care of themselves again and in achieving the safest and most independent lifestyle possible.\n\nAn acute inpatient rehabilitation hospital is a specialized acute care hospital licensed by the State to perform inpatient rehabilitation.. An acute care hospital is a place that takes care of individuals with a serious illness or injury for a short period of time. As an acute inpatient rehab patient, you can expect a minimum of three (3) hours of therapy per day at least 5 days a week, including physical therapy, occupational therapy and/or speech and language pathology. You will be seen daily by your pysiatrist, and other medical consults as needed. In addition, you may receive the services of a psychologist, neuropsychologist,case manager and dietician. You will also be provided 24-hour rehab nursing services. While you may receive many of the same services in another setting, such as sub-acute or skilled nursing, an acute inpatient rehabilitation hospital offers more intense coordinated, interdisciplinary services in order to help you recover more rapidly and increase the likelihood that you can return home.\n\nGenerally, a major illness can leave a patient weak and frail. However, stroke, brain injury, and many neurological or orthopedic conditions are among the many we serve. The goal of the acute rehabilitation team can help the person regain his or her strength and independence. When the patient may have preexisting conditions that place them at risk for further complications, the interdisciplinary team develops training that includes families and caregivers to educate them on the safest strategies for mobility, Activities of daily life, and preventing further complications with lifestyle changes. The Admissions department of our hospitals will give you clear guidelines as to the type of patient that would most benefit.\n\nPatients come to us directly or through a variety of referrals, including physicians, health care professionals, insurance companies ,community agencies and personal referrals from friends and families. Before admission, an evaluation is performed to assess:\n\nDiagnosis\n\nMedical Condition\n\nEndurance/Tolerance for activity\n\nCognition/Ability to participate\n\nMotivation/Willingness to improve\n\nOnce we receive the appropriate medical information, evaluate the patient, review insurance and/or consult with the patient’s physicians, we determine if one of our Rehabilitation Hospitals is the most appropriate setting for the patient.\n\nRehabilitation is a custom-designed program for the patient that involves a team of professionals who will see to it that you receive proper training, exercise and practice. Of course, successful rehabilitation requires a great amount of understanding and support from family and friends. That is why we encourage family to become actively involved in the rehabilitation process.\n\nNo two people heal or learn at the same pace. How long one can expect to stay in the rehab hospital depends on the individual person and how well they are progressing. Generally, patients remain in rehab for as long as there is reasonable progress being made in several areas of functional ability. If the patient has reached maximum potential or if continued progress can be managed in an outpatient or home setting, discharge arrangements will be made. Patients with orthopedic diagnoses frequently progress well in 7 to 10 days, often continuing therapy at home or as an outpatient for several weeks. Some patients may require a longer stay before being discharged.\n\nAssisted Living communities are suited for residents who need assistance in their daily lives, including preparing their meals, facilitating transportation, maintaining their homes, assisting with hygiene, and managing their medication. Assisted living facilities are also good options for some residents living with disorders such as Alzheimer’s, as well as mobility limitations, incontinence, or other conditions common in one’s senior years.\n\nIt should be an integral part of your decision-making process, urge experts at ALFA. When making a major life decision such as choosing an assisted living community, it’s important to be an informed consumer. Be sure that as a resident you’ll be afforded respect, privacy, religious freedom, the right to voice grievances should they arise, maintenance of your personal finances, and control over health care decisions. Additionally, inquire about internal regulations regarding pets, alcohol, smoking, and other quality of life issues, to see if they correspond with your personal preferences.\n\nChoosing the right assisted living residence takes a lot of research and legwork on your part. It’s imperative to compare facilities in terms of unit availability, services offered, cost, and overall philosophy of care. Resources like Seniors for Living empower you to be proactive in requesting information and communicating directly with assisted living professionals. Upon hearing from an assisted living facility’s representative, set up tours at residences of interest, observe residents to get a sense of each facility’s atmosphere, and most important, be sure your individual needs will be met."
