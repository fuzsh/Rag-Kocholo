Run by the Folding@home Consortium, a worldwide network of research laboratories focusing on a variety of different diseases, Folding@home seeks to address problems in human health on a scale that is infeasible by another other means, sharing the results of these large-scale studies with the research community through peer-reviewed publications and publicly shared datasets. During the COVID-19 epidemic, Folding@home focused its resources on understanding the vulnerabilities in SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 disease, and working closely with a number of experimental collaborators to accelerate progress toward effective therapies for treating COVID-19 and ending the pandemic. In the process, it created the world's first exascale distributed computing resource, enabling it to generate valuable scientific datasets of unprecedented size. More information about Folding@home's COVID-19 research activities at the Folding@home COVID-19 page. In addition to working directly with experimental collaborators and rapidly sharing new research findings through preprint servers, Folding@home has joined other researchers in committing to rapidly share all COVID-19 research data, and has joined forces with AWS and the Molecular Sciences Software Institute (MolSSI) to share datasets of unprecedented side through the AWS Open Data Registry, indexing these massive datasets via the MolSSI COVID-19 Molecular Structure and Therapeutics Hub.

These tables provide accurate predictions of the astronomical tide (i.e., the change in water level due to the gravitational effects of the moon and sun and the rotation of the Earth); however, they cannot predict water-level changes due to wind, atmospheric pressure, and river flow, which are often significant.\n\nThe National Ocean Service (NOS) has the mission and mandate to provide guidance and information to support navigation and coastal needs. To support this mission, NOS has been developing and implementing hydrodynamic model-based Operational Forecast Systems.\n\nThis forecast guidance provides oceanographic information that helps mariners safely navigate their local waters. This national network of hydrodynamic models provides users with operational nowcast and forecast guidance (out to 48 â 120 hours) on parameters such as water levels, water temperature, salinity, and currents. These forecast systems are implemented in critical ports, harbors, estuaries, Great Lakes and coastal waters of the United States, and form a national backbone of real-time data, tidal predictions, data management and operational modeling.\n\nNowcasts and forecasts are scientific predictions about the present and future states of water levels (and possibly currents and other relevant oceanographic variables, such as salinity and temperature) in a coastal area. These predictions rely on either observed data or forecasts from a numerical model. A nowcast incorporates recent (and often near real-time) observed meteorological, oceanographic, and/or river flow rate data. A nowcast covers the period from the recent past (e.g., the past few days) to the present, and it can make predictions for locations where observational data are not available. A forecast incorporates meteorological, oceanographic, and/or river flow rate forecasts and makes predictions for times where observational data will not be available. A forecast is usually initiated by the results of a nowcast.\n\nOFS generally runs four times per day (every 6 hours) on NOAA's Weather and Climate Operational Supercomputing Systems (WCOSS) in a standard Coastal Ocean Modeling Framework (COMF) developed by the Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services (CO-OPS).

Training datasets include pairs of imagery and labels for different types of machine learning problems including image ...\n\nDetails →\n\nUsage examples\n\nHow to access Radiant MLHub Data by Radiant Earth\n\nRadiant MLHub Tutorials with Jupyter Notebooks by Kevin Booth\n\nExplore wind speed images from Amazon Sustainability Data Initiative (ASDI) hosted on S3 using SageMaker Studio Lab (SMSL) by Frank Rubino\n\nCreating a Machine Learning Commons for Global Development by Hamed Alemohammad\n\nChallenge on Computer Vision for Crop Detection from Satellite Imagery by Radiant Earth\n\nSee 8 usage examples →\n\nToxicant Exposures and Responses by Genomic and Epigenomic Regulators of Transcription (TaRGET)\n\nbioinformaticsbiologyenvironmentalepigenomicsgeneticgenomiclife sciences\n\nThe TaRGET (Toxicant Exposures and Responses by Genomic and Epigenomic Regulators of Transcription) Program is a research consortium funded by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS). The goal of the collaboration is to address the role of environmental exposures in disease pathogenesis as a function of epigenome perturbation, including understanding the environmental control of epigenetic mechanisms and assessing the utility of surrogate tissue analysis in mouse models of disease-relevant environmental exposures.\n\nDetails →\n\nUsage examples\n\nMetabolic effects of air pollution exposure and reversibility by Rajagopalan S, Park B, Palanivel R, et al.\n\nThe role of environmental exposures and the epigenome in health and disease. by Perera BPU, Faulk C, Svoboda LK, Goodrich JM, Dolinoy DC.\n\nComparison of differential accessibility analysis strategies for ATAC-seq data by Gontarz P, Fu S, Xing X, Liu S, Miao B et.al.\n\nEpigenetic biomarkers and preterm birth by Park B, Khanam R, Vinayachandran V, et.al.\n\nVisualize TaRGET II data with WashU Epigenome Browser by WashU Epigenome Browser\n\nSee 8 usage examples →\n\nASTER L1T Cloud-Optimized GeoTIFFs\n\ncogearth observationgeospatialminingnatural resourcesatellite imagerysustainability\n\nThe Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) Level 1 Precision Terrain Corrected Registered At-Sensor Radiance (AST_L1T) data contains calibrated at-sensor radiance, which corresponds with the ASTER Level 1B (AST_L1B), that has been geometrically corrected, and rotated to a north-up UTM projection.

The ArcticDEM project seeks to fill the need for high-resolution time-series elevation data in the Arctic. The time-dependent nature of the strip DEM files allows users to perform change detection analysis and to compare observations of topography data acquired in different seasons or years. The mosaic DEM tiles are assembled from multiple strip DEMs with the intention of providing a more consistent and comprehensive product over large areas. ArcticDEM data is constructed from in-track and cross-track high...\n\nDetails →\n\nUsage examples\n\nFuture Evolution of Greenland's Marine-Terminating Outlet Glaciers by Ginny A. Catania, Leigh A.
