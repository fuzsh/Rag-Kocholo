        "text": "1892\n\nIn the January-February Collegian, the editors ask, “Is it not high time that Kenyon offered the same advantages to women which for more than sixty years she has been offering to men?”\n\n1946\n\nThe June 19 Collegian leads with the satirical headline, “Announce Kenyon to Go Co-ed in Fall.” “Who knows, for the first time in its long and distinguished journalistic career the Collegian may be published by members of the fair sex in the Fall Term,” the article reads.\n\n1962\n\nIn September, students return to a campus that no longer provides maid service in student rooms, requiring Kenyon men to make their own beds — in the words of President F. Edward Lund — “just like the boys at Harvard and Yale.”\n\n1964\n\nPresident F. Edward Lund and the Board of Trustees discuss what it would take to save Kenyon, which is teetering on the edge of financial ruin. The College could either recruit more men (a challenge) or bring women to Kenyon.\n\n1965\n\nOn Feb. 27, the Kenyon board approves (in principle) the expansion of the student body and the creation of the Coordinate College for Women, which would admit around 175 female students in the fall of 1969. According to the Fall 2013 Bulletin, “as news of the plan leaked out, alumni and students reacted, often vehemently … A campus poll indicated that more than half of the 644 students opposed entry of women.\n\n1968\n\nOn Oct. 15, Kenyon breaks ground for construction of the commons and residence halls of the Coordinate College for Women. According to the Fall 2013 Bulletin, “The new dorms would cluster women in sixteen-person ‘social units’ … and would feature a curved ‘feminine’ design.”\n\n1968\n\nOn Dec. 12, Doris Bean Crozier, a professor of anthropology and assistant to the president at Chatham College, is announced as the dean of the Coordinate College for Women. “An international traveler who had lived and taught in Germany and Cambodia, Crozier knew something about foreign cultures — an understanding that, as the sole female member of an all-male administration, would serve her well,” Hoekstra writes in the 2013 Bulletin article.\n\n1969\n\nOn Sept. 8, Kenyon marks the official opening of the Coordinate College for Women and the unofficial end of single-sex education on the Hill. The Collegian, in its Sept. 18 paper, noted that although “many Kenyon men welcomed the presence of girls on Middle Path, the majority still viewed the addition with clearly mixed feelings.”\n\n1970\n\nOn April 9, the Kenyon College Dramatic Club presents its production of the Peter Weiss play “The Persecution and Assassination of Jean-Paul Marat, as Performed by the Inmates of the Asylum of Charenton Under the Direction of the Marquis de Sade, or Marat/Sade,” the first to be directed by Assistant Professor of Drama Harlene Marley. The leading female role of Charlotte Corday is played by Colleen Kelly ’73.\n\n1971\n\nOn May 30, Kenyon awards degrees to its first three female graduates, Belinda Bremner, Judith Hobbs Goodhand and Patricia Sellew (the first woman elected to the Beta of Ohio Chapter of Phi Beta Kappa). All three came to the College as transfer students in 1969.\n\n1972\n\nOn June 3, the Kenyon board votes to approve an experiment in coeducational housing. The first residences to have both female and male occupants are Farr Hall (suite by suite), Caples Residence (floor by floor), and the Bexley and New apartments (apartment by apartment). In addition, Bushnell Hall is designated as a women’s residence hall to integrate housing on the South Campus.\n\n1972\n\nIn July, Karen Burke joins Kenyon as assistant director of women’s physical education and the first full-time coach of the College’s field hockey and women’s lacrosse teams. For five of her eleven years at Kenyon, she simultaneously coaches four sports: basketball, field hockey, lacrosse, and volleyball.\n\n1972\n\nOn Feb. 19, the Kenyon board votes that the College will become a coeducational institution on July 1, 1972. Thus the short life of the Coordinate College for Women comes to an end, perhaps as intended from the beginning. In a Collegian article, Provost Bruce Haywood says he hopes that the word “student” can now be used “without any further qualification,” and that he foresees a time when “we will no longer speak in terms of the number of men and number of women enrolled at Kenyon.”\n\n1974\n\nIn April, College administrators reject a Peeps proposal to allow women to live in their division of Old Kenyon, citing concerns for the women’s safety, the “feelings” of members of the building’s other fraternities (Alpha Delta Phi and Delta Kappa Epsilon), and a desire for authorization by the board of trustees.\n\n1976\n\nKenyon’s Women’s Center becomes an official student organization, with headquarters in a former Peirce Hall storeroom. \"We are beginning with a positive outlook,\" co-organizer Lauren Rosenbloom ’78 tells a Collegian reporter. “We're not anti-Kenyon or anti-male, but pro-information, decision and choice.\" The group’s mission includes improving women’s medical facilities on campus, as well as providing opportunities for women faculty and students to better connect with one another.\n\n1976\n\nFebruary sees the resignation of Sharon A. Decker, the first woman to be hired into a tenure-track position in the Department of English. Decker cites “social isolation,” “hostility” and “lack of understanding,” as well as opposition to change, among her reasons for leaving to accept a job at the University of Virginia.\n\n1976\n\nOn July 26, Gene C. Payne, who had served as head nurse at Kenyon’s Health Service, dies at the age of 59. One of the College’s first African-American employees, she joined the Kenyon staff in 1962 after many years as head nurse at Mercy Hospital in Mount Vernon, Ohio.\n\n1977\n\nAt Honors Day, Nina Freedman ’77 becomes the first woman to be awarded Kenyon’s E. Malcolm Anderson Cup, for the student who has done the most for the College in the preceding year.\n\n1978\n\nKathryn “Ryn” Edwards, Kenyon’s first out lesbian professor, joins the biology faculty as an assistant professor. Open about her sexual orientation from the start, she becomes an important part of the College’s gay and lesbian community and an essential player in efforts for equality on campus.\n\n1992\n\nAllison E. Joseph ’88 H’14 receives Ploughshares magazine's John C. Zacharis First Book Award for her collection of poems, “What Keeps Us Here.” While at Kenyon, Joseph was the first undergraduate to be published in the Kenyon Review since Robert Lowell and James Wright.\n\n1993\n\nOn May 13, Roberta Teale Swartz Chalmers, poet, professor, widow of President Gordon Keith Chalmers, and often unacknowledged co-founder of the Kenyon Review, dies at her home in Newton, Massachusetts, at the age of 89. According to the Fall 2018 Bulletin, Chalmers was the one who had noticed the absence of an American literary review and encouraged her husband to remedy this oversight.\n\n1993\n\nJulia F. Johnson ’73 H'99, becomes Banc One’s first female senior vice president, as well as the first female member of the exclusive Columbus Club. “When I was told my application had been accepted, I was advised that it was a big deal,” she tells Columbus Monthly magazine, in September 1993.\n\n1994\n\nHistorian Janette Thomas Greenwood ’77 H’11 publishes her first book, “Bittersweet Legacy: The Black and White ‘Better Classes’\" in Charlotte, North Carolina, 1850-1910.” The landmark study challenges the fundamental premises of earlier work on the New South, which tends to separate the histories of whites from those of African-Americans.\n\n1997\n\nVicki Barker ’78 H’96 is hired to host the BBC World Service's morning world news program for U.S. listeners, “World Update.” She later produces a four-part radio documentary, \"The Changing Face of Global Power,\" which introduces the world to the concept of the \"BRICs\" — Brazil, Russia, India and China as rising powers.\n\n2001\n\nLaura Hillenbrand ’89 H’03 publishes her first nonfiction book, “Seabiscuit: An American Legend,” about the famous Thoroughbred racehorse, Seabiscuit. The New York Times best-seller becomes a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award and wins both the Book Sense Nonfiction Book of the Year award and the William Hill Sports Book of the Year Award.\n\n2003\n\nOn July 1, S. Georgia Nugent becomes Kenyon’s 18th president. In her inaugural address, she invites everyone to take part in \"this endless odyssey of education,\" and thereby to increase \"Kenyon's capacity to act in and transform our world.\"\n\n2008\n\nAs Kenyon celebrated the 35th anniversary of the first full graduating class of women during Reunion Weekend 2008, Bonnie Levinson '73 and Todd Leavitt '73 spearheaded a project to capture the stories of members of the Class of 1973.
