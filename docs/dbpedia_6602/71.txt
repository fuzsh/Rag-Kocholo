Synopsis: A screen adaptation of the play written by George Bernard Shaw. Julius Caesar (Claude Rains) arrives in Egypt with his army but is surprised when he is enamored of the young and beautiful Cleopatra (Vivien Leigh).

Purr Blur: In one scene Cleopatra awakens in her sleeping chamber. Barely visible in the background is a small white cat.

Final Mewsings: Of course the Queen of Egypt would have cats in her bedroom!
