Since I'm the one-and-only Historyscoper (tm), let me quickly bring you up to speed before you dive into my Master Historyscope.\n\nThe British film industry developed separately from Hollywood, a love-hate relationship, with several top talents abandoning Britain for Hollywood incl. Charlie Chaplin, Bob Hope, Cary Grant, Elizabeth Taylor, and Richard Burton; the lack of a U.S.-style First Amendment forever holds the British film industry back?\n\nIn Apr. 1737 Henry Fielding's political satire The Historical Register for the Year 1736 debuts, knocking the admin. of PM (1721-42) Robert Walpole and causing so much alarm among English authorities that they pass the Licensing Act of 1737, putting theaters under the direct control of the Lord Chamberlain (until 1968), ending Fielding's dramatic career; the number of London theaters is restricted; modified by the Theatres Act of 1934, and repealed by the Theatres Act of 1968.\n\nIn 1843 the Theatres (Regulation) Act of 1843 is passed in Britain, amending the 1737 Licensing Act by restricting the Lord Chamberlain's power to only prohibit the licensing of plays that in his opinion \"is fitting for the preservation of good manners, decorum or of the public peace\", giving powers to local authorities to license theaters, breaking the monopoly of the patent theaters and encouraging the building of saloon theaters and music halls; it is repealed by the Theatres Act of 1968.\n\nIn 1852 the 700-seat Canterbury Music Hall is founded on the site of a former skittle alley next to the Canterbury Tavern at 143 Westminster Bridge Rd., Lambeth, London by Hackney, London-born impresario Charles Morton (1819-1904), becoming the first purpose-built music hall (term coined by Morton) in Britain, spawning hundreds of imitators and causing Morton to become known as \"the Father of the Halls\"; it is destroyed by Nazi bombing in 1942.\n\nOn June 21, 1889 after making the first moving pictures on celluloid film last year in Hyde Park, London, Bristol-born English portrait photographer William Freeze-Frame, er, William Friese-Greene (1855-1921) receives patent #10,131 for his Chronophotographic Camera, which can take 4-5 (up to 10?) photographs per sec. using peforated celluloid film, and sends info. on it to Thomas Edison, who is busy developing his Kinetoscope; too bad, the low frame rate causes it to become a flop, and he goes bankrupt in 1891; he then invents Biocolour, using B&W film with two different colored filters, and alternate frames of the monochrome print stained red or green.\n\nIn 1897 Warwick Trading Co. in London, England, managed by Cincinnati, Ohio-born Charles Urban (1867-1942) acquires the rights to films by the Lumiere brothers; in 1903 Urban founds the Charles Urban Trading Co. in Brighton to produce educational, scentific, and travel films, incl. coverage of the 1904-5 Russo-Japanese War, expanding to fiction and sci-fi; in May 1908 Urban introduces the Kinemacolor 2-color red-green additive motion picture system, which becomes a worldwide success; too bad, in 1915 after a lawsuit by rival William Friese-Greene, inventor of the Biocolour System invalides his patent, the co. folds.\n\nIn 1898 Bamforth & Co. Ltd. in West Yorkshire, England, maker of lantern slides begins producing silent monochrome films, often featuring a char. named Winky, inventing film editing with \"The Kiss in the Tunnel\" (1899); in 1910 they begin producing dirty seaside postcards, which become so popular that they end their filmmaking in 1915 after 100+ films.\n\nIn 1898 Gaumont British Picture Corp. is founded as a subsidiary of the French Gaumont Film Co., opening Lime Grove Studios in Shepherd's Bush, West London in 1915, becoming the first bldg. built in Britain solely for film production; in 1920 it opens Islington (Gainsborough) Studios, where Alfred Hitchcock gets his start as an intertitle writer, going independent in 1922 before being acquired in 1927 by Gainsborough Pictures; it is acquired by the BBC in 1949 and used for TV.\n\nIn 1898 Hepworth Studios is founded in Walton-on-Thames, Surrey, England by Cecil Milton Hepworth (1874-1953), going on to produce \"The Beggar's Deceit\" (1900) followed by 25 more films incl. \"Comin' Thro the Rye\" (1923), which are all lost when the negatives are melted down to sell the silver; on Oct. 17, 1903 he releases Alice in Wonderland, becoming the first film adaptation of the Lewis Carroll book, featuring special effects incl. Alice shrinking in the Hall of Many Doors, getting stuck in the White Rabbit's house, and reaching for help through a window; in 1926 it becomes Nettlefold Studios; it closes in Mar. 1961.\n\nIn 1902 Ealing Studios is founded in the White Lodge in Ealing Green, W London, England by William George \"Will\" Barker (1868-1951), going on to become the oldest continuously-operating film studio on Earth; in 1931 it begins filming talkies; after WWII it releases a series of classic films incl. \"Kind Hearts and Coronets\" (1949), \"Passport to Pimlico\" (1949), \"The Lavender Hill Mob\" (1951), and \"The Ladykillers\" (1955); in 1955-95 it is acquired by the BBC.\n\nIn Apr. 1903 Frank Mottershaw (1850-1932) of Sheffield, Yorkshire, England produces the film A Daring Daylight Burglary, followed in Sept. by \"The Robbery of the Mail Coach\", pioneering the chase movie.\n\nIn 1909 after a number of nitrate film fires, the British Cinematograph Act of 1909 is passed to control film theaters for health and safety reasons; next year the act is extended to the film content, causing filmmakers to hustle to stave off govt. intervention.\n\nIn 1911 Ideal Film Co. is founded in Soho, London, England by brothers Harry Moses (1875-1951) and Simon Rowson (Rosenbaum) (1877-1950), sons of a Polish Jewish immigrant butcher, starting out as a film distributor then producing films in 1916, acquiring Elstree Studios in Borehamwood from the Neptune Film Co. in 1917, merging in 1927 with Gaumont British and distributing films under its own name until 1934, distributing 400 films and producing 80, incl. its biggest hit The Life Story of David Lloyd George (1918), which actually isn't a hit since it's bought by the real David Lloyd George for £20K and locked up until 1996.\n\nOn Oct. 3, 1912 Sidney Olcott's From the Manger to the Cross; or, Jesus of Nazareth (Kalem) debuts in London, filmed on location in Palestine, written by Gene Gauntier, who plays Virgin Mary, becoming a hit in the U.K. and U.S., doing $1M+ box office on a $35K budget; too bad, the London Daily Mail pub. the headline \"Is nothing sacred to the film maker?\", causing the British Board of Film Censors to be founded in London in Dec. by members of the film industry to classify and censor films in the U.K. to stave off govt. intervention, with filmmakers having to pay to have their films reviewed after it begins operation on Jan. 1, 1913; in 1984 it changes its name to British Board of Film Classification, expanding to home videos and video games.\n\nIn 1913 Stockton-on-Tees, England-born stage dir. Maurice Elvey (1887-1967) switches to films, starting with \"The Great Gold Robbery\" (1913), followed by \"The Suicide Club\" (1914), \"Love in a Wood\" (1916), \"The Man Who Saved the Empire\" (1918), \"The Hound of the Baskervilles\" (1921), going on to mentor dirs.

H.G. Wells and board members incl. A.A. Milne; too bad, the distributors lowball them and they go defunct, after which Howard moves to Hollywood and launches a stellar acting carrer which incl. \"Of Human Bondage\" (1934), \"The Petrified Forest\" (1936), which relaunches the career of his lifelong Am. friend Humphrey Bogart, \"Pygmalion\" (1938), \"Intermezzo\" (1939), and \"Gone with the Wind\" (1939), after which he returns to England, starring in \"49th Parallel\" (1941) et al. until he his plane is shot down over the Bay of Biscay on June 1, 1943.
