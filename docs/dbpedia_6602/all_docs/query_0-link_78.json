To this end, I have charted the production and reception by audience and critics of the great epics. I have also argued that Ancient World epics tell us as much about the preoccupations and values of the period in which they were made as about the period in which they were set. In pursuit of these themes, I have examined every major epic from Intolerance (1916) to Rome (2005–6). I have omitted the comedies such as Roman Scandals, A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum, Carry on Cleo, The Life of Brian and Up Pompeii. This is partly to accommodate a strictly limited word count, but also partly because as someone who is temperamentally melancholic, I respond more productively to tragedy than to comedy. I have incurred many debts in the writing of this book and I would like to thank the following for help and advice of various kinds: Stephen Wildman, David Shotter, Peter Yeandle, Anselm Heinrich, Kate Newey, Allen Eyles, Mark Glancy, Martin Shephard, Joel Hockey, Bernard Hrusa Marlow and Sir Christopher Frayling. I am permanently indebted to the admirable and ever-helpful staff of the British Film Institute Library, the British Library and Lancaster University Library. I am grateful for the word-processing skills of Linda Persson and June Rye. The stills reproduced in this book are included for the purposes of critical analysis. The book is dedicated to three of Britain’s ﬁnest ﬁlm historians, James Chapman, Mark Glancy and Sue Harper, in token of many years of valued friendship, encouragement and support.

Jeffrey Richards\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\n1\n\nThe Ancient World: the Nineteenth-Century Context\n\nThe astonishing worldwide success of Ridley Scott’s Roman epic Gladiator in 2000 single-handedly revived a cinematic genre that had been moribund for 35 years. It sent ﬁlm producers scampering back to the stories that had inspired the previous cycle of Ancient World epics in the 1950s and early 1960s and new versions of the tales of Troy, Thermopylae, Alexander the Great and Julius Caesar duly appeared. The very last thing that Gladiator was about was actual Roman history. Finding all her protests about inaccuracy ignored, historical adviser Kathleen Coleman, Professor of Latin at Harvard University, asked for her name to be removed from the credits.1 Firstly, Gladiator was about Hollywood and secondly, it was about contemporary America. It triumphantly revived the epic ﬁlm genre by a process of splicing together the narratives of one of the most successful entries in the earlier Hollywood Ancient World cycle (Spartacus) and one of the least successful (The Fall of the Roman Empire). It highlighted the action, spectacle and romance that had been features of the successful epics. But at the same time the ﬁlm gave the events a contemporary resonance by constructing them as an explicit commentary on Clintonian America. For, as Gore Vidal has never tired of reminding his countrymen, America is now an empire and beset by the problems all empires face. So what better way of ﬂagging up these problems than a revival of that most imperial of ﬁlm genres: the Roman epic. It is a truism that historical ﬁlms are always about the time in which they are made and never about the time in which they are set. They cannot represent history accurately as they invariably play fast and loose with characters and events to meet the constraints of time, the demands of drama and the expectations of audiences. This is perhaps why all epic ﬁlm-makers lay such great stress on the visual authenticity of costumes, props and settings and put so much effort and expense into background research. The visual authenticity is seen to make up for the factual inaccuracies. However, P.M. Pasinetti, hired as technical adviser on the 1953 ﬁlm Julius Caesar, remained unconvinced: Why are experts hired? One version is that the producers want to feel ‘protected’: that the historical allusion, the armament detail, the duellist’s motion, or whatever, will bear the stamp of specialized approval. This attitude is largely ﬁctitious, unrelated to actuality; for\n\n2\n\nH O L LY W O O D ’ S A N C I E N T W O R L D S\n\nthe producer knows very well that his historical reconstruction is not going to be exact and ‘scholarly’ and, which is more important, there is no reason why it should be so. A ﬁlm is being made, not a contribution to a journal; the requirements are those of the ﬁlm as a coherent artistic whole. Therefore also, in order to be of any use at all, the technical adviser should keep thinking that he is, in however minor, indirect, and peripheral a way, contributing to the making of a ﬁlm.2\n\nHistorical adviser Robin Lane-Fox defended Oliver Stone’s Alexander (2004) in similar terms: Epic ﬁlms about history have been much discussed for showing a ‘Past Imperfect’, but this neat label is the wrong one to apply. ‘Perfect history’ does not exist, nor was it ever Oliver’s aim. His aim was an intense ﬁlm-drama, not a documentary, and one source of this intensity is historical reference wherever he felt it appropriate […] As a result, history is the ﬁlm-drama’s springboard and gives it force. But ﬁction is built into it too because characters have to speak lines for which there is no evidence […] So, a script-writer has to invent, and Oliver’s script is a historical ﬁction. But it is a ﬁction exceptionally rooted in history, with strong interpretations of the person whom it represents.3\n\nJ. Lesley Fitton of the British Museum who advised the production of Troy on details of life in the Ancient World recorded: I believed that the ﬁlm was worthy of support by historians and archaeologists because it aimed to bring the story of Troy to new audiences around the world. Moreover, it rapidly became clear that Wolfgang Petersen and his team were taking an extremely thoughtful view of the subject matter […] Certainly reservations can be expressed about the liberties taken with the story toward the end of the ﬁlm, when the fates of certain characters were radically different from what the ancient tradition tells us. Of course one could argue that the ancient world knew variants of traditional stories, but these were not motivated by what seemed in the ﬁlm to be a very Hollywood need for the evil to be punished and the good to prosper.4\n\nBut Gladiator and the new epic cycle it initiated did not exist in a vacuum. Visually and dramatically it had deep roots and these stretched back to the nineteenth century, where painting and the stage together created a vision of the Ancient World that was handed on intact to the new medium of cinema. Both Britain and the United States were obsessed with the Ancient World in the nineteenth century. For Victorians on both sides of the Atlantic history held the key to understanding the present and the eternal truths about human nature. The Ancient World could be used to represent an escape from an increasingly urbanized and industrialized present to an idealized golden age. It could constitute a vehicle to critique the present. It fulﬁlled a continuing nineteenthcentury taste for the exotic, for spectacle and for education. It could be used\n\nT H E A N C I E N T WO R L D : T H E N I N E T E E N T H - C E N T U RY C O N T E X T\n\n3\n\nto explore the roots of national, communal, individual and gender identity. As William Vance has written: From Thomas Jefferson and John Adams down through […] Henry James and Henry Adams, ancient Rome […] was for Americans a place of unrivalled cultural signiﬁcance. The heroes of the Roman Republic – Cincinnatus, Cicero, Cato the Younger – were American heroes because they were champions of liberty, and liberty was the meaning of America. But in the century following (William Dean) Howells’ ﬁrst visit (in 1864), his deafness to the ‘vocal glory’ of Roman ruins […] became typical. Instead of being the historical and inspirational source of liberty and law, ancient Rome became at best a setting for costume pageantry and didactic Christian melodrama in novels and ﬁlms.5\n\nThe American Founding Fathers consciously saw themselves as the successors of the heroes of the Republic and modelled their institutions, their buildings and their rhetoric on those of Ancient Rome. American statesmen such as Washington, Jackson and Calhoun were depicted wearing togas. One of the most popular plays on the early American stage was the Englishman Joseph Addison’s play Cato (1713) which eulogized one of the greatest heroes of the Republic. Plays by American authors adopted Addison’s approach and attitude. Republican heroes inspired, for instance, John Howard Payne’s Brutus or the Fall of Tarquin (1818), and Jonas B. Phillips’ Camillus or the Self-Exiled Patriot (1833). But the most celebrated nineteenth-century Ancient World drama was Robert Montgomery Bird’s The Gladiator (1831), which retained its popularity in America for 70 years. It told the story of the rebel gladiator Spartacus and his revolt against Rome. In this context, Rome was seen as the analogue of the British Empire, and Spartacus the counterpart of the American colonists whose rebellion ended imperial rule. The role became particularly associated with the American actor Edwin Forrest and when he played it at Drury Lane in 1836, John Bull (20 November 1836) reported: ‘his ﬁne manly form, great physical force and exceeding energy, were in admirable keeping with our preconceived notions of a Gladiator […] At times we forgot the actor and fancied that one of the glorious statues of ancient Greece had been suddenly called into life and summoned to the arena’. The classical myths, suitably sanitized, were retold for American children by writers such as Nathaniel Hawthorne (The Wonder Book, 1851; Tanglewood Tales, 1853) and Thomas Bulﬁnch (The Age of Fable, 1855). They provided inspiration for painters and sculptors. Henry Peters Gray painted Proserpine and Bacchus, The Judgement of Paris and Cupid Begging His Arrows and William Page painted Cupid and Psyche and Venus guiding Aeneas and the Trojans to the Latin Shore. William Wetmore Story wrote a series of dramatic monologues as delivered by Phidias, Praxiteles, Marcus Aurelius, Cleopatra, Mark Antony and Cassandra, a play, Nero, and sculptures of Cleopatra, Medea, Salome, Helen, Alcestis, Clytemnestra, Judith, Electra and Semiramis.\n\n4\n\nH O L LY W O O D ’ S A N C I E N T W O R L D S\n\nThe two ancient cultures which appealed most to Victorian Britain were Greece and Rome. Antiquity, particularly Ancient Greece, with its classical architecture characterized by rational, balanced and geometric designs, the invention of democracy, a philosophy based on ethics and reason and an aesthetic that celebrated perfect beauty, inspired the apostles and exponents of the eighteenthcentury Enlightenment. The cult of Hellenism was central to the intellectual life of Victorian Britain. Writers and thinkers selected from the Greek heritage those elements which most closely conformed to the preoccupations of the age, essentially celebrating the Ancient Greeks as proto-Victorians. What the Victorians highlighted was the Greeks’ development of democracy and the rule of law, at a time when democracy was being extended in Britain, and the Greek appreciation of beauty and celebration of heroism as a contrast to the philistinism and Nonconformist Puritanism associated with the bourgeoisie. They rejoiced in the philosophical humanism which they derived from a study of Plato, Aristotle and Socrates and from which they derived intellectual justiﬁcation for collective social responsibility, individual self-sacriﬁce, devotion to duty and enlightened paternalism which was seen as a corrective to the materialism and selﬁshness associated with industrial capitalism. Ancient Greece, in particular Periclean Athens, was idealized and held up as a model of dignity, decency, restraint, moderation, harmony, balance, reason and purity. Homer was studied as a secular equivalent of the Bible. The Iliad and the Odyssey were seen in particular as teaching chivalry, nobility, patriotism, and moral and physical strength as characteristics for which to strive. So the language, literature, history and ideas of the Ancient Greeks were taught to the British elite at school and at university to ﬁt them to cope with the modern world.6 If Ancient Greece appealed to the intellectuals and artists of Victorian Britain, Ancient Rome appealed to its administrators and empire-builders. For Britain in the second half of the nineteenth century, already master of the mightiest empire the world had ever seen, the reference point for comparison, for guidance, for lessons was the Roman Empire. Anthony Trollope observed in 1870 that Rome and the Roman Empire were part of modern history and modern political life in a way that Greece could never be.7 Where Rome had the Pax Romana, Britain had the Pax Britannica with much the same remit. Britain referred to its imperial viceroys as proconsuls. The architecture of the Empire tended to favour the classical style in its public buildings. The utterances of Britain’s imperial statesmen were steeped in classical allusion, most famously when in a debate about the manhandling of a British subject Don Paciﬁco, Lord Palmerston proclaimed as a fundamental of British policy, the protection at all costs of British subjects with the ringing statement ‘Civis Romanus sum’. Disraeli, deﬁning his policy, declared it to be imperium et libertas, Empire and Freedom. The British admired the Romans for their stoicism, their courage, their administration and\n\nT H E A N C I E N T WO R L D : T H E N I N E T E E N T H - C E N T U RY C O N T E X T\n\n5\n\ntheir legal system, their concept of citizenship, their straight roads, bridges and aqueducts, their common currency and common language. In Britain Hadrian’s Wall, the Roman roads, and the archaeological remains at Bath, Colchester and St Albans were a permanent reminder of Roman architectural achievements. The regular comparisons between the British and Roman Empires culminated in detailed comparative studies: Lord Cromer’s Ancient and Modern Imperialism (1910) – signiﬁcantly Cromer was both Britain’s proconsul in Egypt and later President of the Classical Association – Sir Charles Lucas’ Greater Rome and Greater Britain (1912) and Sir James Bryce’s The Ancient Roman Empire and the British Empire in India (1914). Just as the prospective elite of the Empire were taught Greek, they were also taught Latin and provided with inspiring examples of dedication, duty and service from Roman history, notably in Lord Macaulay’s Lays of Ancient Rome (1842), a popular poetic retelling of four episodes from Roman history, regularly learned by heart by Victorian schoolboys of all classes. The Roman poets Lucretius, Catullus, Virgil and Horace were as much a part of nineteenth-century culture as were the Greek poets and philosophers.8 However, Britain did not just look to Rome for laudatory parallels; it looked to Rome also for lessons about what destroys empires and this was a source of much reﬂection, thought and argument. A classic example of this is to be found in The Roman and the Teuton, a series of inaugural lectures given by the Reverend Charles Kingsley on his appointment as Regius Professor of Modern History at Cambridge and published in 1864. He begins by painting a lurid picture of the Roman Empire in the later fourth century, an empire under the absolute rule of an emperor, whose palace is ‘a sink of corruption’, where the Senate only exists to carry out the orders of the tyrant, where the free middle classes have either disappeared or linger on, ‘too proud to labour, fed on government bounty, and amused by government spectacles’, where the arts and science have died, where everything is done by an army of slaves supplied by a cruel and degrading slave trade and where the normal condition of the Empire is one of ‘revolt, civil war, invasion’. ‘And yet’, says Kingsley, ‘they called themselves Christians – to whom it has been said “Be not deceived, God is not mocked. For these things cometh the wrath of God on the children of disobedience”’. The wrath did come and the Empire fell. So the absence of true spirituality, of real Christianity, is the root cause of the fall of the Roman Empire. This picture, he warned, could be repeated in the British Empire ‘if we are not careful’.9 For Kingsley the key factors in Rome’s decline, and the ones to be avoided by the British Empire if it was to escape the same fate, were the absence of parliamentary democracy and a responsible aristocracy, the existence of slavery, the decay of public spirit, civic virtue and morality, the dominance of sensuality, the employment of mercenaries, the decline of racial purity, and the absence of genuine Christianity. For Kingsley, as for many other commentators (from Ruskin\n\n6\n\nH O L LY W O O D ’ S A N C I E N T W O R L D S\n\nto Kipling), the last of these was the most signiﬁcant. In the nineteenth century, which saw a major revival in Britain of both Evangelicalism and Catholicism, the role of Christianity in the Roman Empire became a major subject of debate. Major religious polemicists took to the novel to work out their debates about the nature of the faith and, writing as they were during the heyday of the British Empire, they often set their debates during the Roman Empire. Of whatever persuasion, they were as one in the belief that the most potent force to deploy against the paganism, slavery, unrestrained sensuality and political despotism of the Empire was Christianity. The fashion for Roman novels essentially began with Bulwer-Lytton’s The Last Days of Pompeii (1834) and climaxed with General Lew Wallace’s Ben-Hur (1880) and Henryk Sienkiewicz’s Quo Vadis (1896), novels by an Englishman, an American and a Pole respectively, but all hugely popular bestsellers worldwide, endlessly reprinted, translated and adapted for and performed on the stage and, during the twentieth century, in the cinema. An estimated 200 novels on Roman life were written by British and American authors between the 1820s and the First World War.10 They were characterized by that mixture of ‘costume pageantry and didactic Christian melodrama’ identiﬁed by William Vance. In most of these novels, Christianity was seen as the answer to the tyranny and corruption of a pagan empire. In general terms, it was possible to argue that without a genuinely felt and practised Christianity, empire will fail. For Christianity is seen here to be synonymous with democracy, humanity and public virtue. But it was on the question of what kind of Christianity – Catholic or Protestant – that the nineteenth-century novelists crossed swords. Charles Kingsley published his novel Hypatia in 1853. It recounted the religious clashes in ﬁfth-century Alexandria, highlighting the theological disputes and divisions weakening the Empire. Kingsley lays the blame on hysterical, celibate, neurotic and fanatical monks, who are his analogue of the Catholics, and of scheming politico bishops in a theocratic state – and his Bishop Cyril of Alexandria is a thinly disguised picture of Cardinal Wiseman, leader of the English Catholics. His heroes, the monk Philammon and the Jew Raphael Aben-Ezra, are converted to his preferred model of Christianity, a simple proto-Protestant Christianity, which Kingsley calls ‘the only real democratic creed’. Kingsley was one of the pioneers of ‘muscular Christianity’, was strongly opposed to priestly elitism, celibacy and popery and an enthusiastic advocate of marriage. As a direct response to Kingsley’s novel both Cardinal Wiseman and John Henry Newman, later himself a Cardinal, also wrote extremely inﬂuential novels. Wiseman’s Fabiola was published in 1854 and Newman’s Callista in 1855. The former, set in Rome in 302 and the latter in North Africa in 250, commemorate the Christian martyrs of the Roman persecutions of those periods, but in particular write up, celebrate and afﬁrm Catholic beliefs and practices, such as the cult of the saints and the Papal hierarchy. Kingsley,\n\nT H E A N C I E N T WO R L D : T H E N I N E T E E N T H - C E N T U RY C O N T E X T\n\n7\n\nNewman and Wiseman all see the Roman Empire as synonymous with decay, despotism and sensuality and see Christianity as its salvation, but as the cure for sensuality, Newman and Wiseman prescribe celibacy and Kingsley monogamous marriage. Where Newman and Wiseman prescribe a strong hierarchical Catholic church, Kingsley argues for proto-Protestant individualism. These are only three of a torrent of novels dealing with the conﬂict of Christianity and Empire in ancient Rome. This conﬂict and its working out in Christianity’s favour made these novels as appealing to the American audience as to the British.11 Then towards the end of the century other concerns arose to parallel the debate about spirituality in the Empire. There was anxiety about manpower shortage and the degeneration of the race when the Boer War revealed a third of all recruits to be physically unﬁt to serve, and there was panic about the decadent movement and in particular the celebrity of Oscar Wilde and Wildeanism. This inspired disapproving descriptions of sensuality in the novels of the time linked to the gospel of Wildeanism and visually half-horriﬁed, half-fascinated paintings such as Alma-Tadema’s The Roses of Heliogabalus (1888) in which the debauched emperor Heliogabalus and his decadent companions watch with world-weary amusement while his dinner guests are smothered to death beneath a torrent of rose petals released from a canopy above them. There was a widespread sense of crisis in intellectual and elite circles, a crisis which produced such works as Elliot Mills’ bestselling work of ‘future history’, The Decline and Fall of the British Empire (1905) which attributed the decline to ‘town life, demoralizing luxury, physical inertia, gradual decline in physique and health and lack of conﬁdence in the imperial mission’.12 Sir Robert Baden-Powell founded the Boy Scouts partly to prevent the British Empire suffering the same decline as the Roman, a decline he attributed in Scouting for Boys (1908) to the abandonment of soldiering, manliness and patriotism. The characteristics of the Ancient World novel were essentially set by its progenitor, Edward Bulwer-Lytton, later the ﬁrst Lord Lytton, novelist, poet and statesman, in his phenomenally successful The Last Days of Pompeii, which was the product of visits to the ruined city in 1832–3. Pompeii, an otherwise unremarkable Roman provincial town, was made immortal by its destruction along with neighbouring Herculaneum in ad 79 by an eruption of Mount Vesuvius and its rediscovery by archaeologists seventeen centuries later. It was the chance discovery in 1711 of stone fragments by a peasant digging a well that led to systematic excavations on the site of Herculaneum by the kings of the Two Sicilies. The much richer neighbouring site of Pompeii was only identiﬁed in 1763 and it was not until 1863 that systematic, scientiﬁc excavation began there with the appointment of trained archaeologist Giuseppe Fiorelli as Director of the Museum and Excavations. But long before this the ruins of Pompeii and Herculaneum had become a regular port of call for travellers on the\n\n8\n\nH O L LY W O O D ’ S A N C I E N T W O R L D S\n\nGrand Tour. Goethe, Dickens, Dumas and Mark Twain visited them. But the most productive visit was that of Bulwer-Lytton; for it directly inspired his best-selling novel The Last Days of Pompeii. Lytton’s ﬁctional plot centred on Glaucus, an Athenian resident of Pompeii, and his love for the beautiful Ione. But Ione is also loved by her guardian, Arbaces, the High Priest of Isis. Arbaces murders Ione’s brother, Apaecides, a priest of Isis who has converted to Christianity, and frames Glaucus for the murder. Glaucus is condemned to the arena but as he is facing the lions, another priest Calenus reveals that he witnessed the murder and Glaucus is innocent. At this point, Vesuvius erupts. Various characters, among them Arbaces and Calenus, are killed. But Glaucus and Ione are saved by the blind slave girl Nydia, who loves Glaucus. She leads them safely through the smoke and the darkness to a ship which carries them to safety. Having selﬂessly united the lovers, Nydia drowns herself in the sea. Glaucus and Ione marry and settle in Athens. The action of the novel takes place amid precisely described locations, uncovered by archaeologists: the Pompeian amphitheatre, the villa of the tragic poet, the villa of Diomedes, and the temple of Isis. Declaring himself with regard to prose ﬁction ‘thoroughly aware of its power in teaching as well as amusing’, Lytton sought to give a faithful picture of the customs, costume and superstitions of the age, in accurate topography of his setting but also ‘a just representation of the human passions and the human heart, whose elements in all ages are the same’.13 Together with his detailed historical research and his exploration of the secrets of the human heart there was another powerful inspiration – painting. While he was in Italy, Lytton visited a collection of pictures in the Brera Gallery in Milan and wrote in his journal that one picture in particular was making a ‘considerable sensation’. The painting The Last Days of Pompeii was by the Russian artist Karl Pavlovich Bryulov (1799–1852) which set a series of ‘human interest’ stories against an apocalyptic background.14 The impression this picture made upon Bulwer-Lytton was reinforced by another. One of John Martin’s epic canvases, exhibited at the Egyptian Hall, Piccadilly in 1822, was The Destruction of Pompeii and Herculaneum. Lytton knew and admired Martin’s work, calling him in 1833 ‘the greatest, the most lofty, the most permanent, the most original genius of his age. I see in him […] the presence of a […] great soul lapped in majestic and unearthly dreams’.15 In its turn the novel inspired painters. An estimated thirty-ﬁve paintings based on episodes in the novel are recorded in the sixty years after its appearance, among them Paul Falconer Poole’s The destruction of Pompeii (c. 1835) and The escape of Glaucus and Ione, with the blind girl Nydia from Pompeii (1861) and Joseph Severn’s The Witches’ Cavern: Glaucus and Ione (1840). The American sculptor Randolph Rogers sculpted Nydia the Blind Girl of Pompeii.16 The paintings, like the novel, embodied the characteristics which were to become identiﬁed with the\n\nT H E A N C I E N T WO R L D : T H E N I N E T E E N T H - C E N T U RY C O N T E X T\n\n9\n\nAncient World genre: archaeological authenticity, emotional truth, visual power and a desire to educate as well as to entertain. The same characterizations were to be carried over into stage adaptations of the major novels. The nineteenth century was the century when archaeology emerged as a science – the word only came into common currency in 1851 – and the recovery of the Ancient World proceeded apace in Italy, Greece, Egypt and the Near East. The Elgin Marbles had been sent from Athens to London between 1801 and 1811, creating a sensation. But it was not until the 1860s that digging began at Olympia and Samothrace to recover the remains of Ancient Greece. In 1879 the British School of Archaeology in Athens was established and in 1885 Oxford University established a chair of Classical Archaeology. It was, however, the German, Heinrich Schliemann, who had made the most sensational discoveries in Greece. Schliemann, fantasist, romantic, self-publicist and pioneering archaeologist, in the twenty years following 1870 astonished the world with his ﬁnds at Troy, Mycenae and Tiryns which appeared to conﬁrm the literal truth of the events related by Homer and the Ancient Greek playwrights. The siege of Troy is one of the great epics of European culture, with its parade of heroes (Hector, Achilles, Odysseus, Ajax, Aeneas and Paris) and its succession of mythic events (the Judgement of Paris, the abduction of Helen, the sacriﬁce of Iphigenia, the Wooden Horse). It has inspired great writers and artists down the years from Homer, Aeschylus and Virgil through Chaucer and Shakespeare to Berlioz and Yeats. Caesar and Alexander both visited the putative site of Troy. Fugitive Trojans were said to have founded Rome, France and even Britain. But did the Trojan War actually ever happen? Some of the greatest classical scholars have doubted it. George Grote, premier historian of Ancient Greece in the nineteenth century, dismissed it as a legend in 1846. This view is still held by some today. But the search for Troy is one of the great romances of modern archaeology. It was an Englishman, Frank Calvert, who decisively identiﬁed Hisarlik in modern Turkey as the site of Ancient Troy and suggested it to Schliemann. Between 1870 and his death in 1890, Schliemann returned regularly to Troy, proving beyond doubt the existence of a city of Troy. It was in 1873 that he uncovered what he dubbed ‘the treasure of Priam’ and ‘the jewels of Helen’. But before his death it had become clear that there was not one Troy but seven successive cities built on the same site and his discoveries came from Troy II, whose remains dated from a thousand years before the putative date of Homer’s Trojan War. Schliemann’s assistant Wilhelm Dorpfeld, who continued the excavations after Schliemann’s death, thought that Troy VI was probably Homeric Troy, an identiﬁcation which still holds true today. Supplementary evidence for a Trojan War emerged later not from Greek sources but from the discovery and decipherment of the diplomatic archive of the Hittite Empire, where documents suggest that Troy may have been a vassal state of the Hittites, and an attack on it in the thirteenth century bc by\n\n10\n\nH O L LY W O O D ’ S A N C I E N T W O R L D S\n\nthe Greeks as part of a wider clash of empires over dominance on the coast of Asia Minor is therefore entirely plausible.17 It was Schliemann who also excavated Mycenae, a uniquely preserved example of a Bronze Age fortress city. The walls, the tombs, the Lion Gate and the so-called Treasury of Atreus were all known sites and regularly visited by curious travellers from the eighteenth century onwards when interest in pagan antiquities revived. In 1876 Schliemann uncovered ﬁve graves, full of treasures, including gold face masks, one of which Schliemann conﬁdently proclaimed to be the mask of Agamemnon. Later this was dated to the sixteenth century bc, long before the age of Agamemnon. The building identiﬁed as Agamemnon’s Palace turned out not to be and the Treasury of Atreus was actually a beehive-shaped tomb. Although Mycenae did not yield evidence relating to Troy, Schliemann’s discoveries and his published accounts in the books Mycenae, Ilios and Tiryns enthralled a generation. It was such discoveries that inspired writers with a passion for accurate descriptions of the places, customs, costume and artefacts of the Ancient World. They provided equal inspiration for painters, whose work came ﬁrst to ﬁx the image of the Ancient World in the popular mind. John Martin was the master of ‘the apocalyptic sublime’. His huge canvases which combined immensity of scale, intricacy of detail and an overpowering atmosphere appealed powerfully to the nineteenth-century sensibility, a sensibility shaped by the world-changing experiences of the French Revolution and the Industrial Revolution. He painted visions of cosmic catastrophe drawn both from the Ancient World and the Bible. Among them were The Fall of Babylon (1819), Belshazzar’s Feast (1821), The Destruction of Pompeii and Herculaneum (1822), The Seventh Plague of Egypt (1824), The Fall of Nineveh (1829), The Destruction of Pharaoh’s Host (1833), The Deluge (1834) and The Destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah (1852). They were to inﬂuence the great epic ﬁlm-makers of the twentieth century, D.W. Grifﬁth and Cecil B. De Mille. But Martin was not alone. Similar pictures were painted by J.M.W. Turner, David Roberts, Samuel Colman, Francis Danby, George Miller and Thomas Cole. Martin’s inﬂuence was at its height in the early 1830s, coinciding exactly with the vogue for Lytton’s The Last Days of Pompeii. As Martin’s biographer William Feaver puts it: Martin’s special contribution was to popularize and make immediate vanished civilizations. While offering little or nothing in terms of original research, he turned literary references into visual reality […] he concentrated on architectural heroics – the immense promenades, viaducts, canals, and sewers which had been commonplace, it appeared, in the ancient Egyptian and Babylonian empires […] There were few precedents in ﬁne art for this brand of panoramic epic painting […] he made no serious attempt to represent these cities as they had actually appeared, but showed them instead as sublimely inauthentic permanent stage sets […] the neo-classical taste for accurate reconstruction\n\nT H E A N C I E N T WO R L D : T H E N I N E T E E N T H - C E N T U RY C O N T E X T\n\n11\n\nof an exemplary, awe-inspiring past […] was propagated by way of theatre design, panoramas, and architecture. These are the frames of reference within which Martin’s epic ‘machines’ truly belong – not among the conventional history paintings of the academy.18\n\nWhen Martin was painting, Babylon and Nineveh had yet to be excavated and when excavations revealed Martin’s views to be essentially fanciful, he fell out of popularity, following his death in 1854. Accuracy became the watchword for history painting. Typical of the new school of painters of the Ancient World is Jean-Léon Gérôme (1824–1904). Gérôme was a leading ﬁgure in the group, dubbed by contemporaries Néo-Grecs. Inspired by archaeological excavations at Pompeii and elsewhere, the Néo-Grecs were animated by enthusiasm for depicting scenes of everyday life in accurate antique settings furnished with authentic artefacts. Two of Gérôme’s most enduring and inﬂuential pictures were his paintings of the arena, Ave Caesar, Morituri te Salutant (1859) showing a group of gladiators saluting the Emperor, and Pollice Verso (1872) showing a gladiator straddling a fallen opponent and waiting for the thumbs up or thumbs down sign from the crowd. Feeling that some of the archaeological detail in Ave Caesar was incorrect, he studied costumes on Trajan’s column and had moulds made from gladiators’ helmets, greaves and buckles from Naples. He made several bronze statues of gladiators in 1875 and 1878. Other canvases included Cleopatra before Caesar (1866), Julius Caesar and his staff (1863) and Death of Caesar (1867), showing Caesar dead beneath Pompey’s statue and the senators ﬂeeing. Later in the century he painted Circus Maximus (1876) showing chariots racing round a central spina and The Christian Martyrs’ Last Prayer (1883) with a huddled group of Christians in the circus as lions emerge from an underground tunnel. Both were commissioned by wealthy Americans and displayed in America. They look to have directly inﬂuenced the visuals in the ﬁlms Ben-Hur and The Sign of the Cross. Gérôme’s ancient world scenes were familiar through the mass reproduction in engravings both in Britain and America.19 In Britain a classical revival in painting, celebrating the civilizations and values of Greece and Rome, lasted from the 1860s to 1914. According to Christopher Wood in his authoritative Olympian Dreamers, Victorian classicism is not easy to deﬁne. ‘Inevitably it meant different things to different people; it was an inﬂuence rather than a coherent body of opinion; a catalyst rather than a clearly deﬁned artistic movement.’ In support of this view, he differentiates the characteristics of the leading classical painters: ‘the lofty aspirations of Leighton, the antiquarianism of Alma-Tadema, the aesthetic classicism of Moore and BurneJones, the decadence of Simeon Solomon and Aubrey Beardsley, and the high romanticism of Waterhouse’.20 Sir Frederic Leighton painted idealized pictures\n\n12\n\nH O L LY W O O D ’ S A N C I E N T W O R L D S\n\nof a Greek World that was a vision of beauty, order and human perfection. His biographer Mrs Barrington said: ‘Probably no Englishman ever approached the Greek of the Periclean period so nearly as did Leighton’.21 The Olympians mostly steered clear of the Roman Empire, preferring the abstract purity and marmoreal perfection of Ancient Greece. But Sir Lawrence Alma-Tadema, ‘best known and best paid of all Victorian classical painters’, was celebrated for the ﬁdelity of his genre paintings of everyday life in the Ancient World, particularly Rome. His desire, as he put it in an 1899 interview, was ‘to express in my pictures that the old Romans were ﬂesh and blood like ourselves, moved by the same passions and emotions’.22 The secret of his success was to portray the rituals, practices and mores of wealthy Romans – their dinner parties, their courtship rites, their shopping expeditions, their visits to the Baths – so that they appeared to spectators, as one commentator put it like ‘Victorians in togas’. At the same time he drew on archaeology to create as accurate a picture as possible for buildings, furniture and clothing, so that spectators felt they were learning while viewing. Alma-Tadema said: ‘If I am to revive ancient life, if I am to make it relive on canvas, I can do so only by transporting my mind into the far off ages, which deeply interest me, but I must do it with the aid of archaeology. I must not only create a mise-en-scène that is possible but probable’.23 It was his archaeological accuracy and sense of dramatic composition that led to AlmaTadema becoming the established painter most often employed by the leading actor-managers of the Victorian stage. Besides Greece and Rome, popular interest in the empires of the Near East (Egypt, Assyria, Babylonia) was also stimulated by archaeological discovery. It was Napoleon Bonaparte’s expedition to Egypt in 1798 that initiated a new interest in that country and its ancient past. The expedition was accompanied by 151 scientists and artists, charged with documenting all aspects of the country, including its ancient monuments. One of the discoveries during the expedition was the Rosetta Stone which contained an inscription written in both Egyptian and Greek. This enabled Jean-François Champollion to decipher the hitherto incomprehensible Egyptian hieroglyphs, a discovery made public in 1822. This began the process of allowing scholars to read the records of Egyptian history. The ﬁrst half of the nineteenth century saw a scramble for antiquities to supply the demands of European museums and private collectors. The Muslim rulers of Egypt, incurious about the country’s pre-Islamic past and uninterested in pagan relics and monuments, were perfectly happy to grant concessions to Europeans to investigate, excavate and collect. During this period, Giovanni Batista Belzoni (1778–1823), conducted pioneering excavations at Gizeh, Thebes and Abu Simbel. Systematic archaeological investigations only began after 1850, dominated initially by the French archaeologist Auguste Mariette, who created the ﬁrst\n\nT H E A N C I E N T WO R L D : T H E N I N E T E E N T H - C E N T U RY C O N T E X T\n\n13\n\nMuseum of Egyptian Antiquities in 1863. Major discoveries were subsequently made by Sir Gaston Maspero and Sir Flinders Petrie, under whom the science of Egyptology developed. In 1866 the British Museum established a separate department of Egyptian and Oriental Antiquities. The Egyptian Exploration Fund was established in 1882 to ﬁnance archaeological digs. Academic posts for the study of Egyptology were established at the universities of London (1892), Oxford (1901), Liverpool (1906) and Manchester (1913). The discoveries, the archaeological activities and the work of painters in recording both the ruins and imaginative reconstructions of ancient Egyptian life sparked a craze for all things Egyptian, dubbed Egyptomania and lasting throughout the nineteenth century. It received a new stimulus with the opening of the Suez Canal on 17 November 1869 and the premiere soon after at the Cairo Opera House of Verdi’s opera Aida from a story provided by Auguste Mariette. It was given another major boost when Howard Carter discovered the tomb of Tutankhamun, which was opened in 1923 to reveal a fabulous array of treasures and artefacts. It created a worldwide sensation dubbed Tutmania. Its impact was enhanced and perpetuated by the legend of the curse of the Pharaohs, given substance by the death of the expedition’s backer, Lord Carnarvon, less than ﬁve months after the opening of the tomb. This inspired a series of ‘Mummy’ ﬁlms, featuring murderous Egyptian mummies and ﬂashbacks to the ancient kingdom. The contents of the tomb inspired fashionable new lines in clothing, jewellery, hats, furniture and cosmetics.24 What accounts for this obsession with Egypt rather than other ancient Near Eastern empires like Assyria and Babylon, which were also excavated? It was partly a byproduct of Romanticism, with its preoccupation with the past and with the occult. The monumental physical remains (pyramids, obelisks, sarcophagi, the Sphinx) appealed to the cult of the picturesque, which included a fondness for ruins. The customs and practices recorded in such works as Sir Gardner Wilkinson’s Manners and Customs of the Ancient Egyptians (1836), which has been called ‘the most inﬂuential book on Ancient Egypt to appear in English during the nineteenth century’,25 catered to a taste for the exotic which represented an escape from the drabness and conformity of modern industrial society (mummiﬁcation, the animal-headed gods and goddesses, the brother/ sister marriage of the monarchs). Ancient Egyptian beliefs and lore informed various esoteric cults such as Theosophy and Freemasonry. There was also an ideological signiﬁcance in Egyptomania. The nineteenth century was an age of empires. Egypt had been an empire and had lessons to offer on the rise and fall of imperial powers. Professor Fekri Hassan has plausibly argued that the acquisition and transportation of Egyptian monuments, particularly obelisks, recognized as symbols of cosmic power, was a decisive bid to legitimize the rule of modern empires ‘by cannibalizing other civilizations in\n\n14\n\nH O L LY W O O D ’ S A N C I E N T W O R L D S\n\norder to assume a superior position in the order of the world’.26 This practice dated back at least to the Roman Empire which began the process of removing obelisks from Egypt to Rome partly as victory trophies but also partly as symbols of the process by which a new and thriving empire in the West was replacing an old, worn-out, decadent empire in the East. For Britain, there was an additional stimulus to interest. Egypt featured signiﬁcantly in two of the most important cultural icons of the Victorian Age – the Bible and Shakespeare. The Bible included the story of Moses and the exodus of the Jews from their captivity in Egypt to the creation of a new kingdom in the Holy Land. Shakespeare dramatized the story of Antony and Cleopatra with its clash of empires, temperaments and civilizations. Egyptomania had a vast range of cultural expressions. As early as 1812 the showman William Bullock created the Egyptian Hall in Piccadilly, nominally inspired by the temple of Hathor at Dendera, complete with statues of Isis and Osiris, sphinxes, hieroglyphs and lotus columns. The Hall contained galleries furnished with Egyptian décor and a representation of the tomb of Pharaoh Seti I, complete with imitation murals and an original sarcophagus. Among the many exhibitions staged there one of the most successful was a display of the artefacts collected by Belzoni in 1821. The Hall survived until 1904, though latterly used for musical and magical shows.27 But the Egyptian Hall was not the only manifestation of the craze. The British Museum opened an Egyptian gallery. The Crystal Palace at Sydenham featured an Egyptian court which from 1854 until it burned down in 1936 combined spectacle and education. The Egyptian architectural style appeared across the globe applied to such diverse buildings as zoos, factories, cinemas, amusement parks, department stores, suspension bridges and war memorials, symbolizing monumental solidity and permanence but also suggesting promise of romance, mystery and adventure.28 Besides buildings and exhibitions, the public became familiar with the visual imagery of Egypt, its people, its history and its customs from paintings, plays, operas and latterly ﬁlms. There was substantial overlap between these forms, with paintings in particular inﬂuencing the settings and stagings of the dramatic retellings of Egyptian life. Massive, teeming, atmospheric canvases by John Martin (The Seventh Plague of Egypt, The Destruction of Pharaoh’s Host), J.M.W. Turner (The Fifth Plague of Egypt) and David Roberts (The Israelites leaving Egypt) with their hordes of extras, monumental buildings and extreme weather, looked like blueprints for the later Hollywood epics. Other episodes from Egyptian history that captured the imagination of painters were Joseph’s sojourn in the country and his role at Pharaoh’s court and the death of Cleopatra, which inspired a host of artists to depict her, usually gloriously naked, sprawled amid cushions and draperies.29\n\nT H E A N C I E N T WO R L D : T H E N I N E T E E N T H - C E N T U RY C O N T E X T\n\n15\n\nThe Victorians were fascinated by the idea that the ancients were ‘people like us’ in fancy dress and genre painters responded to this by episodes from everyday life, staged amid carefully researched costumes, artefacts, settings, rituals and pursuits. Alma-Tadema painted twenty-ﬁve Egyptian genre scenes without ever having been there. Notable among them were Pastimes in Ancient Egypt, An Egyptian Widow and Egyptian Games. In the same vein were Edwin Long’s The Gods and their Makers, Edward John Poynter’s Adoration to Ra and Frederick Bridgman’s Procession of the Sacred Bull Apis. Elsewhere in the Near East, the primary stimulus to archaeological activity was the desire to prove the truth of the Bible stories and to discredit the attacks on the Creation by geologist Charles Lyell and evolutionist Charles Darwin. The ﬁrst permanent archaeological body to be set up was the Palestine Exploration Society in 1865, ‘for the purpose of investigating the archaeology, geography, geology and natural history of the Holy Land’.30 These excavations identiﬁed towns and cities, battles and foreign conquerors mentioned in the Bible. There were spectacular discoveries relating to those powerful empires which regularly reached out to swallow up Israel. In the 1840s Paul Emile Botta excavated Khorsabad, uncovering exquisite bas-reliefs which detailed everyday life in Ancient Assyria. Austen Henry Layard excavated Nimrud (the Biblical Calah) and Nineveh. His 1849 book Nineveh and its Remains became a bestseller, running through four editions immediately. Henry Creswick Rawlinson deciphered cuneiform writing, making the texts discovered by the archaeologist accessible. Layard had discovered the King’s Library at Nineveh with thousands of cuneiform tablets recording the history, mythology, magic, diplomacy, medicine and science of Assyria. In 1853 at Nineveh the palace of King Assurbanipal (known to the Greeks as Sardanapalus) was discovered by Hormuzd Rassam, previously Layard’s assistant. In the 1870s interest turned from the Assyrians to the Sumerians and Babylonians. But in 1872 George Smith identiﬁed and deciphered a fragmentary Chaldean account of the Deluge, which appeared to conﬁrm the story of Noah’s ﬂood. In 1880 Rassam made the ﬁrst major ﬁnd in Babylonia, the site of the biblical Sepharvaim, which contained 50,000 inscribed cylinders and tablets. Sumerian Telloh was excavated by the French who found the Stela of the Vultures with its army of Sumerian warriors advancing in phalanx. In 1887 an American expedition excavated Nippur, ﬁnding 30,000 Sumerian tablets. It was a German expedition under Robert Koldewey that excavated Babylon in the period 1899–1913. The Ishtar Gate, with its glazed brickwork, dragons and bulls in relief, was reconstructed in Berlin. In the 1920s Sir Leonard Woolley excavated Ur of the Chaldees. As a result of these excavations, much was discovered about the history, religion, life and work of the peoples of Sumeria, Assyria and Babylonia.31 Despite the dominance of religion in nineteenth-century life, the Bible was not for the most part on the agenda of contemporary painters. There were\n\n16\n\nH O L LY W O O D ’ S A N C I E N T W O R L D S\n\ncomparatively few new Biblical paintings. The Royal Academy catalogues indicate that only an average of 2.5 per cent of the paintings on show annually between 1825 and 1870 had religious subjects.32 Although the Bible was a favoured theme of the Old Masters, their art was deemed to be inherently Catholic in outlook. There was in Britain no established Protestant pictorial tradition. The Protestant Church did not commission art and painters necessarily catered to the tastes of their patrons and the wider public. Articles in the periodical press regularly called for religious painting to be used as a vehicle to elevate the taste and moral values of the public. Critics such as Mrs Anna Jameson in Sacred and Legendary Art (1848) and John Ruskin in Modern Painters, Volume 2 (1846) advocated the study of the techniques and approach of early art and combining this with up-to-date realism and the creative use of symbolism and typology to create a truly Protestant art. It was the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood that put this recommendation into effect. A recognizable informality and domesticity characterized works like Ford Madox Brown’s Our Lady of Good Children (1848), which showed Mary washing the ﬁngers of the Baby Jesus, Brown’s Jesus Washing Peter’s Feet (1852–6) and Millais’ Christ in the House of his Parents (1849–50). But it was Holman Hunt who became known as ‘The Painter of Christ’. As Michaela Giebelhausen puts it: ‘Rigorously Protestant in outlook, his work combined an understanding of contemporary Biblical scholarship with naturalist and Orientalist modes of representation. It presented a successful interpretation of scripture that spoke to the age.’33 The mid-nineteenth century was the time when Biblical scholarship focused on the historicity of Jesus, a trend which produced such inﬂuential works as David Friedrich Strauss’s Das Leben Jesu (1835, revised 1864), Ernest Renan’s Vie de Jésus (1863) and John Seeley’s Ecce Homo (1865). The historicity of Jesus the man was combined with the demand for authenticity in settings and trappings, which sent Holman Hunt travelling in the Holy Land and researching the props in his paintings. This combination of historicization, Orientalization and spiritual uplift through the application of symbolism and typology made Holman Hunt’s Jesus pictures, The Light of the World (1851–3), The Finding of the Saviour in the Temple (1854–60) and The Shadow of Death (1870–3) among the most inﬂuential and recognizable of nineteenth-century paintings. There was another and equally inﬂuential source of Biblical illustration and this was the pictorial Bible, which became a ﬁxture in many Victorian homes, shaping the popular perception of the Bible stories. Charles Knight, the great advocate of popular education and the diffusion of useful knowledge, transformed the established format of the illustrated Bible with his Pictorial Bible (1836–8) in which, alongside engravings of the Old Masters’ paintings, included new engravings showing the ﬂora and fauna, architecture, customs, dress and landscape of the Bible. During the 1840s the work of contemporary artists began\n\nT H E A N C I E N T WO R L D : T H E N I N E T E E N T H - C E N T U RY C O N T E X T\n\n17\n\nto be included in illustrated Bibles. For the third edition of his Pictorial Bible (1847–8) Knight eliminated the Old Masters’ pictures because of their inaccuracies of manners and costume and replaced them by modern, archaeologically accurate pictures. The Illustrated Family Bible (1859–63), published by John Cassell, adopted the same approach as Knight.34 But it was the work of two contemporary French painters, Gustave Doré and James Tissot, which had the most long-lasting inﬂuence on the popular imagination of the Victorian public and upon the visuals of stage and screen. The 228 illustrations that Doré provided for an edition of the Bible published in 1866 in London and Paris became his most popular work. Doré’s biographer Joanna Richardson thought the Bible peculiarly suited to his powers: It offered him an almost endless series of intensely dramatic events. His visions of the looming tower of Babel, the plague of darkness in Egypt, the death of Samson, Isaiah’s vision of the destruction of Babylon; these vast, forbidding scenes, heavy with doom, remind one of the visions of John Martin. They also reveal many elements by now familiar in Doré’s work: the mountain scenes, the lurid skies, the complicated battles, the almost unremitting brutality. Doré’s illustrations of the Old Testament remind us, above all, of the God of Wrath: of massacres and murders, decapitations and avenging angels. There is, too, a period element: the angels are Victorian angels, full of sentiment; the women are, again, keepsake women, the children are Victorian children: sentimental or wise beyond their years.35\n\nIn England, Doré was sometimes called ‘the preacher-painter’. Sermons were preached on his work and Cassell reproduced his Bible illustrations in their Daily Devotion for the Household. As Richardson puts it: ‘The Victorians delighted in Doré’s sentimentality, and in his drama. They were touched, too, by his religious leanings’.36 Tissot, painter of fashionable society ladies and their luxurious lifestyle, underwent a religious conversion in 1885 when he claimed to have had a vision of Christ during mass at the church of St Sulpice in Paris, which he had attended to gather atmosphere for his proposed picture ‘The Choir Singer’. He was inspired to embark on an illustrated version of the New Testament. The so-called Tissot Bible coincided exactly with a Catholic revival in France, underway from the 1880s onwards, which was mystical, visionary and anti-rationalist. In preparation for his work, he visited the Holy Land in 1886–7 and 1889 sketching and photographing dress, faces, architecture and topography. He studied archaeological and theological literature. The result was The Life of Our Saviour Jesus Christ: 365 compositions from the four gospels with notes and explanatory drawings, in which everything was documented and theological doctrine explained. The pictures were shown ﬁrst in Paris in 1894 and London in 1896 and then on tour in the United States in 1898. Everywhere they were a remarkable success. The pictures\n\n18\n\nH O L LY W O O D ’ S A N C I E N T W O R L D S\n\nwere published with the Bible text in a luxury edition in 1896–7, earning Tissot a million francs. The 1897 English edition was dedicated to Mr Gladstone. Tissot’s biographer Michael Wentworth explains the popularity of the Tissot Bible thus: ‘In its blend of discursive erudition, documentary reportage and carefully delineated “inspiration”, the Tissot Bible is a mirror image of the literal-minded faith prevalent at the end of the century.’37 The Bible proved equally acceptable to Catholics and Protestants and became familiar throughout the Anglo-Saxon world. The success of his New Testament inspired Tissot to turn next to the Old Testament. There was a further trip to the Holy Land in 1896. But Tissot died in 1902 with the project uncompleted. Only 200 of the projected 396 pictures had been completed. Other artists ﬁnished the project from Tissot’s sketches and they were published in a two-volume edition in 1904. Like Doré’s illustrations Tissot’s were to provide the most familiar visual illustrations of the Old and New Testaments for several decades. Just as in paintings, so too in the Victorian theatre history was a staple subject. As theatre historian Richard Schoch has written: ‘Performance was a powerful agent of historical consciousness in the nineteenth century […] greater than that of literature, painting or even photography’.38 The visual imagery of these historical plays was often directly inspired by famous paintings and plays were staged, framed and lit like paintings. Performance and visual imagery combined to create a popular memory of history, but one which often looked to romance, myth and melodrama for inspiration rather than to academic research. But the theatre operated under certain inescapable constraints. One was censorship. From 1737 to 1968 the stage functioned under the oversight of the Lord Chamberlain’s ofﬁce and had to conform to a strict set of regulations designed to preserve moral standards and the political, religious and social status quo. All plays had to be submitted to the Lord Chamberlain’s ofﬁce and could not be performed without his ofﬁcial imprimatur. This effectively meant the exclusion from the stage of explicit discussions of politics, religion and sex.39 One particular prohibition in force throughout the century was the ban on the dramatization of Bible stories on the stage which explains why, in marked contrast to twentieth-century Hollywood, Biblical stories were absent from the Victorian stage. As the examiner of plays William Bodham Donne said in 1866: ‘both as a matter of morality, and as a matter of taste, I never allow any associations with scripture or theology to be introduced into a play’.40 Works which fell foul of this ban included Racine’s Athalie, Rossini’s opera Moses in Egypt and Wilde’s Salomé. The ﬁrst major West End production to receive a licence was Sir Herbert Beerbohm Tree’s Joseph and His Brethren in 1913. The Lord Chamberlain’s ban was underpinned by the long-running hostility of the church to the stage which began to moderate signiﬁcantly only in the 1890s. This may explain the relaxation of the censorial ban in 1913, something that was generally welcomed in the press.\n\nT H E A N C I E N T WO R L D : T H E N I N E T E E N T H - C E N T U RY C O N T E X T\n\n19\n\nA second constraint on theatrical producers was the commercial imperative of the box ofﬁce. Plays would run only as long as the audiences came. Success in any particular genre inspired imitations. The public by their repeated attendance created a repertoire of much-loved favourite plays from which leading actors departed at their peril. Until 1843, three theatres, Covent Garden, Drury Lane and Haymarket, had a monopoly of spoken drama in London, with the so-called ‘minor theatres’ able only to perform burlettas, or musical entertainments. But the monopoly was ended by the 1843 Theatre Regulation Act. One popular appeal that was constant throughout the Victorian period was the taste for theatrical spectacle. Spectacle was an integral part of everyday life, from the Great Exhibition at the Crystal Palace through to the Golden and Diamond Jubilees of Queen Victoria. It was a feature of Victorian painting, of public buildings and shows of all kinds.41 Audiences had a passion both for the visual and for archaeological and historical accuracy and theatres supplied it, happily justifying the expense on the grounds of the educational value, a recurrent refrain from within the theatre world which waged a continuing campaign to raise the social status of the stage. So spectacle and authenticity went hand in hand in the recreation of the Ancient World. In both Britain and America, plays set in Republican Rome were much more in evidence in the earlier nineteenth century than in the later nineteenth century. This directly reﬂected the political circumstances of the time. The early nineteenthcentury stage was politically much more radical then the later nineteenth-century stage and the sentiments associated with Republican Rome chimed with those aroused by the French and American revolutions and by the British domestic reform movement. Revolutionary France had wholeheartedly taken up the ideas, festivals and even fashions of Republican Rome. Plays and paintings celebrated the great republican heroes, the tribunes of the people, and their destruction of monarchical tyrants. Cato, Brutus and the Gracchi were the ideals, their virtues, incorruptibility, stoicism, civic virtue, love of the people and defence of freedom. The golden age for this era ended with the dictatorship of Julius Caesar. These ideas and images inﬂuenced the culture of both America and Britain. Perhaps the most famous and enduring of the Roman republican dramas was Joseph Addison’s Cato. First performed at Drury Lane in 1713, this celebration of the stoic Roman statesman who committed suicide rather than submit to the dictatorship of Julius Caesar, held the stage throughout the century and was still being performed as late as 1838 by the radical actor-manager William Charles Macready (1793–1873). Macready also achieved success in two other plays with republican sentiments, Sheridan Knowles’ Virginius (1820) and Thomas Talfourd’s Ion (1836). Popular in Britain during the ﬁrst half of the nineteenth century, they remained enduringly popular in America throughout the century. Shakespeare’s two plays set in Republican Rome, Julius Caesar and Coriolanus,\n\n20\n\nH O L LY W O O D ’ S A N C I E N T W O R L D S\n\nwere much performed in the ﬁrst half of the nineteenth century in Britain before largely disappearing from the repertoire in the second half. Interestingly, they too remained popular in America until the end of the century. It was the actor-manager Charles Kean (1811–68) in a remarkable series of Shakespearean revivals at the Princess’ Theatre in Oxford Street in the 1850s who so successfully married spectacular and archaeological recreation that this mode of production became dominant for the rest of the century. His principal contribution to the staging of the Ancient World was his revival in 1853 of Lord Byron’s poetic tragedy Sardanapalus about the downfall of the Assyrian philosopher-king. The great feature of this production was an accurate recreation of Nineveh based on the discoveries made by Austen Henry Layard, described in his best selling book Nineveh and Its Remains (1849), and on the sculptures and artefacts he had shipped to the British Museum. Sir Henry Irving who followed in the footsteps of Kean in the combination of spectacle and pictorialism which he applied to his productions, also, like Kean, preferred plays with medieval or Renaissance setting. But when he did venture into the Ancient World he brought his strong visual sense to bear on their staging. In 1881 he produced Lord Tennyson’s poetic drama The Cup which has been identiﬁed as the ﬁrst of the late nineteenth-century toga play cycle, which had different preoccupations from the earlier republican cycle.42 The Cup, for which Irving had an archaeologically accurate reconstruction of the temple of Diana at Ephesus made, explored some of the themes that dominated the later toga cycle: the proper role for women in society, the denunciation of decadence, and an exploration of the conﬂict of ethics and political necessity in imperial rule. Critics, entranced by the visual splendour of the production, turned to painting to describe the stage effects, invoking Leighton and Alma-Tadema as the inspiration of the visuals. Irving actually turned to painters to design two later productions, Ford Madox Brown to provide the Romano-British setting of King Lear in 1892 and Alma-Tadema to provide the settings for Cymbeline in 1896 and Coriolanus in 1901.43 If Irving was comparatively reluctant to enter the Ancient World, two of his most notable contemporaries as actor-managers were more eager.44 Wilson Barrett (1846–1904) and Sir Herbert Beerbohm Tree (1853–1917) became masters of the Ancient World epic. Barrett’s plays were designed by E.W. Godwin, architect, antiquarian and theatrical metteur-en-scène, who believed in both archaeological accuracy and visual harmony. Oscar Wilde called Godwin ‘one of the most artistic spirits of this century in England’. The Barrett–Godwin collaborations were widely described as aesthetic triumphs. As Wilde wrote of Claudian (1883), the ﬁrst of them, ‘The Ancient World awakes from its sleep and history moves as a pageant before our eyes’.45 Such notable ﬁgures as the critics John Ruskin and Clement Scott and the writer and clergyman Lewis Carroll went to see the play\n\nT H E A N C I E N T WO R L D : T H E N I N E T E E N T H - C E N T U RY C O N T E X T\n\n21\n\nthree times and admired its message of Christian repentance and redemption. Claudian was set in fourth-century Byzantium and Bithynia, Brutus (1885) in Republican Rome and Clito (1886) in Athens in 404 bc and each play was hailed as a lesson in stage archaeology. After Godwin died in 1886, Barrett set plays in Egypt (Pharaoh) and Babylon (The Daughters of Babylon), but his greatest success came with The Sign of the Cross. Set against the background of the persecution of the Christians by the Emperor Nero, the play told how the proud pagan aristocrat Marcus Superbus, put in charge of rounding up the Christians, fell in love with the gentle Christian maid Mercia, converted to her faith and gladly went with her to suffer martyrdom in the arena. It opened in America in 1895 and in London in 1896. It ran initially for 453 performances and had by 1904 been performed an estimated 10,000 times all over the world. Mocked by intellectuals, it was praised by church authorities of every denomination. Sermons were preached on it and Barrett received many letters from people telling him the play had changed their lives. Tree’s ﬁrst toga play was an adaptation of Charles Kingsley’s novel Hypatia, produced in 1893. It revolved around the struggle between pagans and Christians for supremacy in early ﬁfth-century Alexandria. It highlighted the need for an empire to have a proper religious faith which is neither fanatical nor pagan. It condemned sexual immorality and mob rule and denounced scheming clerics and politicians who threaten the stability of the empire. It was designed for Tree by Alma-Tadema, whose sets elicited widespread praise. Alma-Tadema was also enlisted to provide sets for Tree’s spectacular revival of Julius Caesar in 1898. The critics lavished praise on both costumes and sets. Three of Tree’s greatest successes were the poetic dramas, Herod (1900), Ulysses (1902) and Nero (1906), written speciﬁcally for him by Stephen Phillips (1864– 1915). Herod, a study in Oriental tyranny, boasted a palace set, designed and painted by Hawes Craven, which earned an admiring article in the Architectural Review for its historical accuracy. Ulysses had sets by Professor W.R. Lethaby based on recent archaeological discoveries from the Mycenean Age and costumes by Percy Anderson inspired by the mural decorations at Knossos. Nero, another study in tyranny, made it clear that an empire could not be run by a Wildean aesthete who saw art as superior to imperial administration. The 1906 production of Antony and Cleopatra contrasted ‘the austere grandeur of Rome’ with the ‘gorgeous splendour of the East’ and pointed up the lesson for imperialists about what happened when you put private passion ahead of public duty. Tree’s ﬁnal two Ancient World plays recreated Pharaonic Egypt. False Gods (1909), with the temple of Isis set modelled on the hall of columns in Karnak, dealt with the failed attempt of a religious reformer to destroy the power of the pagan priesthood. Joseph and his Brethren (1913) received considerable publicity as it was the ﬁrst time that the Lord Chamberlain had relaxed his ban on Biblical\n\n22\n\nH O L LY W O O D ’ S A N C I E N T W O R L D S\n\nsubjects for a major West End production. While the life of Christ remained taboo, the Old Testament had ﬁnally been deemed suitable for dramatization, provided it was reverently treated. Hypatia was not the only Ancient World novel to be dramatized for the stage. The three most important and long-lasting novels were also. Bulwer-Lytton’s The Last Days of Pompeii was produced on the London stage in 1834, 1835 and 1872. When Henryk Sienkiewicz’s Quo Vadis was published in 1896, three separate stage adaptations immediately appeared in the United States. One of them, a version by Stanislaus Stange, transferred to London in 1900 but closed after only four weeks. Wilson Barrett mounted a rival production which received better reviews but since the plot of Sienkiewicz’s novel had a virtually identical plot to Barrett’s own The Sign of the Cross, it inevitably seemed rather second-hand. Far more successful was the stage version by William Young of General Lew Wallace’s Ben-Hur. With Christ represented by a beam of light, to avoid offending religious susceptibilities, and the healing of the lepers on the Mount of Olives providing the dramatic climax rather than the cruciﬁxion, the play included both the ramming of the Roman galley by a pirate ship and the chariot race, done with real horses racing on a treadmill as a moving panorama unfolded behind them. It opened in 1899 in New York and was an instant hit, returning again and again and touring the United States for twenty-one years. By the time it ﬁnally closed in 1920, it had been performed six thousand times and seen by an estimated twenty million people. The New York production was transported to London and opened at Drury Lane in 1902. It ran initially for 122 performances but was successfully revived in 1912. The era of the toga play ended with a change in the nature of the audience and a transformation of theatrical taste, both of which occurred at the time of the First World War. The rise of the cinema creamed off the mass working-class audience which now preferred to see realistic versions of its old theatrical favourites on a screen not limited by the three walls of the stage and a proscenium arch. But with the theatre audience shrinking to a largely middle-class constituency, the nature of theatrical fare changed. Melodrama and poetic drama went out of fashion and modernity and sophistication were the order of the day, at least on the West End stage. Sheer economics dictated that few theatres could now afford the lavish stagings with hordes of extras that had been an integral feature of the toga play. Symptomatic of the change is the sardonic subversion of previously popular genres by that sly old iconoclast George Bernard Shaw. He provided a moderndress version of Pygmalion (1914). The mythic tale of the sculptor whose beloved statue came to life was a staple of the toga stage in a version by W.S. Gilbert. Shaw transposed it to Edwardian England and centred it on a professor of phonetics who converts a cockney guttersnipe into a lady.\n\nT H E A N C I E N T WO R L D : T H E N I N E T E E N T H - C E N T U RY C O N T E X T\n\n23\n\nHe also provided his own versions of toga plays in Caesar and Cleopatra (1906) and Androcles and the Lion (1913). Caesar and Cleopatra was Shaw’s response to Shakespeare’s Roman plays which were enjoying a new popularity at the high noon of British imperialism. Shaw was disdainful of both Antony and Cleopatra (‘I have a technical objection to making infatuation a tragic theme. Experience proves that it is only effective in a comic spirit’) and Julius Caesar (‘Shakespear [sic] who knew human weakness well, never knew human strength of the Caesarian type. His Caesar is an admitted failure.’)46 Utilizing the recognized ingredients of the toga genre (spectacle, lavish sets and costumes, large casts), he created his own version of the story, deliberately intruding anachronisms, inserting a critique of British imperialism and constructing a Caesar who rather than a ruthless dictator enslaved by a grand passion for Cleopatra emerged as a wise and witty analogue of Shaw himself, an intellectually superior being who undertakes to educate the schoolgirl Queen for rulership. Shaw delivered the coup de grâce to the toga play with Androcles and the Lion. It is a precise parody of The Sign of the Cross with characters, settings and situations direct analogues of those in Wilson Barrett’s play. To add insult to injury, Barrett’s erstwhile leading lady Lillah McCarthy played the Christian heroine Lavinia. The theatrical future lay with Shaw as the toga play disappeared from the stage repertoire. But as a genre it survived, transferred lock, stock and barrel to the cinema where it was destined to scale greater pictorial heights and reach many more millions of spectators than the theatre had ever dreamed possible. Many of the stage hits of the nineteenth century were refurbished for the twentiethcentury screen. But there was one signiﬁcant difference. Where toga plays had ﬂourished equally on the British and American stages in the nineteenth century, the British cinema could never afford the massive investment that Ancient World recreations entailed. So the cinematic future of the Ancient World lay with Hollywood and provided another genre with which it might conquer and colonize the imagination not just of British but of global audiences.\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\n2\n\nThe Birth of the Ancient World Epic in the Cinema\n\nWhen the cinema emerged in the early years of the twentieth century to displace the melodramatic and spectacular stage as the entertainment form of choice for the masses, it turned naturally to the ancient world and scores of short ﬁlms were produced with pocket versions of the familiar stories from the Bible, ancient history and classical mythology. But the feature-length Ancient World cinematic epic was born in 1908 when The Last Days of Pompeii was produced in Italy. It was Italy which took the lead in crafting these early epics, directors drawing on the native tradition of staging grand opera but, by shooting on location, constructing massive sets and deploying thousands of extras, establishing the visual parameters of the new cinematic genre. The choice of the early nineteenth-century British novel by Bulwer-Lytton, already adapted three times for the stage in England, as the basis of the ﬁrst great epic underlines the continuity with the existing literary and theatrical tradition. Two new ﬁlm versions of Lytton’s novel were produced in Italy in 1913 and they were joined in the cinemas by adaptations of Sienkiewicz’s Quo Vadis (1912), Gustave Flaubert’s Salammbô (ﬁlmed as Salambo (1914)) and Cardinal Wiseman’s Fabiola (1916).1 But the most celebrated and inﬂuential of Italy’s Ancient World epics was Giovanni Pastrone’s Cabiria (1914). Two hours long and a triumph of set and costume design, it was artfully put together by Giovanni Pastrone from existing Ancient World texts: the volcanic eruption from The Last Days of Pompeii, the strong-man protector of the heroine based on Ursus in Quo Vadis, his condemnation to turn the millstone borrowed from Samson and Delilah. Other elements look to be drawn from Gustave Flaubert’s Carthaginian romance, Salammbô (1862) and Carthage in Flames (1906), a novel by the proliﬁc Italian historical novelist Emilio Salgari (rescue of the heroine from sacriﬁce in the temple of Moloch). Historical ﬁgures such as Hannibal, Archimedes and Scipio Aemilianus make guest appearances. Also grafted onto the narrative is the historical story of Sophonisba, daughter of a Carthagian general, married to King Syphax of Numidia but loved by Syphax’s rival, Massinissa, an ally of Rome. When Sophonisba is captured, Massinissa sends her poison so that she may avoid the humiliation of being paraded in the Roman triumph. The story had already formed the basis of stage tragedies by John Marston, Nathaniel Lee and Pierre\n\n26\n\nH O L LY W O O D ’ S A N C I E N T W O R L D S\n\nCorneille among others. The ﬂoridly poetic intertitles were provided by the poet Gabriele D’Annunzio, giving the ﬁlm added celebrity value. It is an epic of the Punic Wars between Rome and Carthage and a celebration of Italy’s imperial traditions. The heroine of the ﬁlm is Cabiria, who for much of the ﬁlm is a young child. The ﬁlm opens with the destruction of the Sicilian villa of Cabiria’s family by the eruption of Mount Etna. Fleeing, the child is captured by Phoenician pirates and sold into slavery in Carthage. She is rescued from the threat of sacriﬁce to the god Moloch by the Roman patrician Fulvius Axilla, who is spying on Carthaginian defences for Rome, and is accompanied by his strong man servant Maciste. Fulvius, Maciste and Cabiria are ambushed by Carthagian soldiers, Fulvius escapes but Maciste, after entrusting the infant Cabiria to Sophonisba, is himself captured. Ten years later Fulvius, again reconnoitring Carthage for the Romans, rescues Maciste and escapes with him to the desert, where they are captured and taken to Cirta. But after Cirta surrenders to the Romans and Sophonisba takes poison, she reunites Fulvius with Cabiria, now her handmaiden. Although the ﬁlm is rather static, as Pastrone cuts from one medium-shot setup to another with little camera movement and only one close-up, he achieves a powerful narrative drive, dynamic editing, and innovative lighting. He deploys several breath-taking long-shots (Fulvius diving from a clifftop into the sea; a ladder of shields being created by Roman soldiers to let Fulvius scale the walls of Carthage) and the scale and spectacle are enormously impressive (the eruption of Mount Etna; the siege of Syracuse and destruction of the Roman ﬂeet; the siege of Cirta; the human sacriﬁce in the temple of Moloch). The strong man Maciste became a cult hero and was featured in a succession of subsequent action ﬁlms. The temple of Moloch with its gaping, fanged mouth entrance was copied directly by Fritz Lang in Metropolis (1926) and the siege of Cirta and the Carthagian décor of the ﬁlm directly inﬂuenced D.W. Grifﬁth in his ﬁlming of Intolerance (1917).2 It was a visit to an earlier Italian epic Quo Vadis, then showing in New York, that had so inspired Grifﬁth that he deliberately expanded a planned two-reel version of the Biblical story of Judith and Holofernes to four reels, producing a feature ﬁlm running 55 minutes which had been budgeted at $18,000 but ended up costing twice as much to the annoyance of his employers, Biograph Films. Much of the cost overrun went on building the gigantic walls of Bethulia at Chatsworth in the San Fernando Valley. The row between Grifﬁth and Biograph prompted him to leave and work instead for the more accommodating Mutual.3 Often erroneously described as the ﬁrst American feature ﬁlm, it is nevertheless a transitional ﬁlm which marks Grifﬁth’s move from short to long ﬁlms. Judith of Bethulia (1913), celebrating a Jewish heroine, was based on the Apocrypha and on a poetic tragedy by the nineteenth-century American playwright Thomas\n\nT H E B I RT H O F T H E A N C I E N T WO R L D E P I C I N T H E C I N E M A\n\n27\n\nBailey Aldrich in which Grifﬁth had performed during his career as an actor. It combined the biblical narrative (Assyrians besiege Bethulia; devout widow Judith goes to their camp, seduces the general Holofernes, gets him drunk and cuts off his head) with a conventional romantic subplot (Naomi loves Nathan; Naomi is captured by the Assyrians; Nathan rescues Naomi). Grifﬁth utilized his stock company of actors (Henry B. Walthall as Holofernes; Blanche Sweet as Judith; Mae Marsh as Naomi; Bobby Harron as Nathan; Lillian Gish as The Young Mother). Walthall, unrecognizable under a massive Assyrian beard, folds his arms and glowers a lot to convey the tyrannical disposition of the Assyrian general. Bobby Harron, sporting an entirely inappropriate Edwardian moustache, plays the dashing hero. Blanche Sweet, favoured by many telling close-ups, gives a passionate performance as Judith, grieving for her suffering fellow countrymen, genuinely attracted to Holofernes and, when torn between love and duty, ﬁnally settling for duty and the gratitude of the Bethulians. She is, however, kitted out in the manner of Edwardian haute couture, with an extraordinary peacock feather headdress. Large-scale siege and battle scenes are interspersed with interiors, featuring some rather tame ‘Bacchanalian festivities’ in Holofernes’ tent, the punishment of cowards and the antics of dancing girls and a somewhat camp chief eunuch. Silent ﬁlm historian Anthony Slide found the battle scenes ‘the biggest disappointment. The staging is quite frankly a mess, and there is every sign of a small group of people desperately pretending to be a crowd.’4 The ﬁlm as a whole did not impress silent ﬁlm historian William K. Everson who found it ‘confused and protracted’ and showing ‘far less control and instinctive understanding of the medium in the best of Grifﬁth’s Biograph ﬁlms’, putting this down to its expansion from the planned two-reeler. But he sees it as a useful exercise in the handling of a larger-scale subject as Grifﬁth moved to the next phase in his career.5 It was D.W. Grifﬁth and Cecil B. De Mille who were the godfathers of the Hollywood Ancient World epic. Both were Victorians steeped in the traditions and conventions of the melodrama stage, both were former actors and playwrights with experience both in dramatic construction and performance, and both were attracted by the possibilities of the new medium. It was Grifﬁth who was to be the pioneer, developing a visual language, making a sophisticated use of the close-up, perfecting a dynamic style of editing and carefully rehearsing his actors to shape the desired emotional performances. All these characteristics were to be found in his American Civil War epic, The Birth of a Nation, which electriﬁed critics and audiences in 1915. Despite the critical and box ofﬁce success of Birth of a Nation, a campaign was mounted against it by the NAACP (National Association for the Advancement of Colored People), backed by leading intellectuals. They called for it to be banned on the grounds of its glorifying the Ku Klux Klan and its demeaning depiction of Negroes. Hurt and angered by the campaign, Grifﬁth put together his own\n\n28\n\nH O L LY W O O D ’ S A N C I E N T W O R L D S\n\ncinematic response in the form of the ﬁlm Intolerance, subtitled ‘Love’s Struggle through the Ages’. Linked by the recurrent image of a woman (Lillian Gish) rocking a cradle, inspired by Walt Whitman’s lines ‘out of the cradle endlessly rocking; Uniter of Here and Hereafter’, the ﬁlm tells four stories, cross-cutting between them to underline the parallels, the eternal conﬂict between love and intolerance and the universal nature of human feelings. Interestingly the examples of intolerance conspicuously failed to include race hatred. Grifﬁth had already completed a hard-hitting contemporary melodrama with a strong social conscience, The Mother and the Law. It centred on the Boy (Bobby Harron), wrongly sentenced to death for the murder of a gangster and the efforts, ultimately successful, of his wife (Mae Marsh) and a friendly policeman to prove his innocence, which they do in the nick of time to prevent the execution. The ﬁlm contained a powerful attack on ruthless industrialists who use the troops to shoot down strikers; unemployment which leads to crime, prostitution and poverty; and an interfering and do-gooding Reform Party which separates mothers from their children and seeks to ban drinking and dancing, forcing them underground. It is the only story to have a happy ending. The other three historical strands end in tragedy. There is the St Bartholomew’s Day Massacre in 1572 when the Catholics, stirred up by Queen Catherine de Médicis, slaughter the Protestants of France. Included among the Protestant victims is Bright Eyes (Margery Wilson), whose lover is left grieving over her body. There are episodes from the life of Christ (Howard Gaye), designed to show him at odds with hypocritical Pharisees, notably their disapproval of the dancing and revelry at the wedding at Cana where he turns the water into wine and where they encourage the stoning of the woman taken in adultery, provoking Christ’s comment: ‘Let him who is without sin amongst you cast the ﬁrst stone’. This episode culminates in the Cruciﬁxion, the ultimate act of intolerance. The ﬁnal and most spectacular episode is the siege and capture of Babylon by the Persians in 539 bc. Babylon is portrayed by Grifﬁth as a model of tolerance, justice and love. It is ruled on behalf of his father King Nabonidus by Prince Belshazzar (Alfred Paget), described as ‘an apostle of tolerance and religious freedom’ and betrothed to the Princess Beloved (Seena Owen). Belshazzar seeks to promote the cult of Ishtar, goddess of love, provoking the jealousy of the High Priest of Bel-Marduk. The Persian Army under Cyrus besieges Babylon but Belshazzar leads a successful defence of the city and, when the Persians retire, stages a celebratory feast. But the priests of Bel betray the city, admit the Persians, and Belshazzar and the Princess Beloved commit suicide to avoid capture. The obligatory romantic subplot has the tomboyish Mountain Girl (Constance Talmadge) loved unrequitedly by the Rhapsode (Elmer Clifton), a warrior-poet. She dies defending Belshazzar at the end. Intolerance ends with scenes of ﬁghting\n\nT H E B I RT H O F T H E A N C I E N T WO R L D E P I C I N T H E C I N E M A\n\n29\n\narmies laying down their weapons, prisons replaced by ﬁelds of ﬂowers and angels looking down on a world of peace and brotherhood. It is Grifﬁth’s vision for the future after the repeated intolerance of the past. Along with what is in effect a sermon on the subject of intolerance, the ﬁlm also embodies a strong commitment to visual and historical education. Grifﬁth’s assistant director Joseph Henabery was put in charge of research particularly for the Babylonian sequence but also for the Judean sequence. He recalled assembling a ﬁfteen-foot-long shelf crammed with history books relevant to the periods and he compiled a scrapbook of illustrations both of Victorian paintings and of archaeological ﬁnds from Assyria.6 The necessity for the infant motion-picture art to draw inspiration from the older art forms was an axiom of early theoretical writing on the cinema. The poet Vachel Lindsay in his inﬂuential The Art of the Moving Picture (1915) had separate chapters on ‘Sculpture – in motion’, ‘Painting – in motion’, and ‘Architecture – in motion’, signalling the appropriate sources of visual illustration for the ﬁlm-maker. Early ﬁlm-makers sought to justify and elevate their ﬂedgling art form by explicitly combining entertainment with moral, historical and visual education in a way that can properly be described as Ruskinian. Audiences would have recognized the paintings providing Grifﬁth with his inspiration as he chose canvases familiar from extensive reproduction in engravings. The layout of Babylon as seen through the window of the palace was an exact reproduction of John Martin’s 1819 painting The Fall of Babylon and it was a combination of Martin’s Belshazzar’s Feast (1821) and Georges Rochegrosse’s The Fall of Babylon (1891) which provided the visual inspiration for the sequence of Belshazzar’s Feast. One of the most famous of Victorian Ancient World paintings, Edwin Long’s The Babylonian Marriage Market (1875) was directly reproduced in the sequence in which the Mountain Girl is sent to the Marriage Market. The life of Christ sequences were modelled on James Tissot’s famous four-volume set of illustrations of the Bible (1896–7). This was recognized by the critic of Photoplay (December 1916): ‘Pictorially the greatest ﬁlmings are the Judaean scenes, perfect in composition, ideal in lighting, every one in effect a Tissot painting of the time of Christ.’7 Anxious throughout to stress the historical authenticity of his imagery, Grifﬁth added explanatory notes to his intertitles about customs, buildings and antique terms used. The treachery of the priests of Bel was attributed to the evidence of recently discovered Babylonian cuneiform cylinders. The marriage at Cana was said to be staged ‘according to Sayce, Hastings, Brown and Tissot’. In addition to the French painter, these were James Hastings, author of The Dictionary of the Bible, Francis Brown, author of Assyriology: its use and abuse in Old Testament Study (1885) and Archibald Henry Sayce, British-born author of Israel and the Surrounding Nations (1898) and Babylonians and Assyrians (1900). Sayce\n\n30\n\nH O L LY W O O D ’ S A N C I E N T W O R L D S\n\nwrote to Grifﬁth praising the ﬁlm and his letter was reproduced in the souvenir programme for the ﬁlm: The Babylonian scenes are magniﬁcent, as well as true to facts. I was much impressed by the attention that had been paid to accuracy in detail. The drama is educational in more than one direction, and the interest it must excite in Babylonian history is especially gratifying to the Assyriologist.8\n\nHenabery’s scrapbook contained archaeological illustrations cut from books such as Georges Perrot and Charles Chipiez, A History of Art in Chaldaea and Assyria (1884) and Morris Jastrow Jr, The Civilization of Babylonia and Assyria (1915). Like Sayce, Jastrow also wrote to Grifﬁth praising the ﬁlm’s historical authenticity and his letter too appeared in the souvenir programme: You have succeeded in conveying to the audience a remarkably vivid picture of the art, architecture, costumes, public and private life of Babylonia. I was amazed to see how carefully you reproduced our knowledge of the enormous walls of the city, with their battlements and gates, the palace, the battle towers, the battering rams and other instruments of ancient warfare.\n\nHe singled out for special praise ‘the splendid and thrilling scenes’ of the attack on Babylon and also the feast of Belshazzar. Despite these encomia, there were limits to the vaunted historical accuracy. Cyrus, for instance, had not besieged the city prior to being admitted by the priests. The gates of Babylon were actually based on the South-Eastern gates of the Palace at Khorsabad. The wall relief beneath which the Rhapsode sits in one scene actually bears the picture of a lion hunt featuring King Assurnasirpal II from his palace at Nimrud. So at best Grifﬁth’s Babylon is an amalgam of Assyrian archaeological sources. But there was another unacknowledged source of visual inspiration and that was Cabiria, which had been shown in New York in 1914. The siege of Cirta in the Italian ﬁlm looks to have provided direct inspiration for Grifﬁth’s siege of Babylon. Grifﬁth insisted on reproducing the rampant elephant statues which Giovanni Pastrone had borrowed from India to decorate his Carthaginian palace in Cabiria, even thought there was no historical support for such statues in Babylon. Even individual shots like a Babylonian noble patting a pet leopard had direct analogues in Cabiria. Interestingly, Grifﬁth invited Vachel Lindsay, who had praised and analysed both Judith of Bethulia and Cabiria in The Art of the Moving Picture, to the premiere of Intolerance.9 Even now the ﬁlm remains an astonishing achievement. As William K. Everson has written: ‘In terms of technique … the ﬁlm is a virtual textbook, containing forerunners of glass shots, an ingenious improvised camera crane which even\n\nT H E B I RT H O F T H E A N C I E N T WO R L D E P I C I N T H E C I N E M A\n\n31\n\nforeshadowed the effects of the zoom lens in certain shots, the most sophisticated use yet of toning and tinting, coupled with mood lighting, for dramatic effect; some astonishingly “modern” performances from Mae Marsh and Miriam Cooper; and of course a pattern of editing, or montage, which was to be of profound inﬂuence on the Soviet ﬁlms of the twenties.’10 Different sequences were tinted in different colours (blue for night scenes, red for Babylonian night battles, amber for the French Court) to intensify the emotional impact.11 The magniﬁcent battle scenes by night and by day, the huge siege engines rumbling into position, the chariots racing up and down, Elmo Lincoln, the future screen Tarzan, as ‘the mighty man of valour’ slicing off heads in a single blow, remain unforgettable as does the procession through the Great Court of Babylon, a superb set, complete with its rampant elephant statues and its dancing girls gyrating in ecstasy. It was done by using a specially constructed elevator in a tower on wheels and on tracks, allowing the camera to move up and down, backwards and forwards. There was a platform on it large enough to hold Grifﬁth, cameraman Billy Bitzer and Lillian Gish. Lillian Gish described the effect in her autobiography: The forerunner of the modern camera crane enabled Mr Grifﬁth to create one of the most fabulous effects ever ﬁlmed. Having perfected the close-up and set a standard for crowd scenes, he now fused the two techniques. At the opening of Belshazzar’s feast, the camera was a quarter-mile from the end of the great court. It started the move toward the set, then glided slowly down over the heads of the extras and dancing girls, then moved forward again to halt before a miniature chariot drawn by two white doves and holding a white rose – a gift from the King to the Princess Beloved, who sat at the other end of the table. Fantastic in conception, the shot was also a tribute to Billy’s skill, for throughout the long swooping ride on the crane, he had managed to keep his camera in perfect focus from the enormous expanses of the entire set to the petals on the rose.12\n\nThe Babylon sets covered 250 acres, the walls enclosing the court were 200 feet high, and that sequence involved the use of 15,000 extras and 250 chariots. The ﬁlm as a whole cost $485,000, the cost of 40 ordinary ﬁlms and originally ran for 8 hours, cut eventually to 3 hours and 15 minutes for its release. Although praised by the critics – Film Daily called it ‘stupendous, tremendous, revolutionary, intense, thrilling’ – perhaps inevitably it failed at the box ofﬁce. The audiences, used to linear narratives, were bewildered by the cross-cutting between different stories – Variety claimed it was difﬁcult to follow – and after the United States entered the First World War in 1917 the national mood was against explicitly paciﬁst sermons. To recoup some of his losses, Grifﬁth released The Mother and the Law and The Fall of Babylon as self-contained ﬁlms in 1919, shooting extra footage to allow them to stand alone. The new material for The Fall of Babylon built up the romance between the Mountain Girl and the Rhapsode, introducing a happy ending in which they escaped to a new life in Nineveh.13\n\n32\n\nH O L LY W O O D ’ S A N C I E N T W O R L D S\n\nAfter the ﬁnancial failure of Intolerance, Grifﬁth made a series of popular and highly praised melodramas (Broken Blossoms, Way Down East and True Heart Susie) but the relative ﬁnancial failure of later epics (America, Orphans of the Storm) led to the loss of his independence and a retreat to more conventional studio ﬁlm-making at Paramount. He became the most spectacular casualty of the conversion to sound, unable to adjust to the new medium and to changing audience tastes and sensibilities. Inactive for sixteen years, he took to drink and died in 1948. Cecil B. De Mille, who learned much from Grifﬁth, did not suffer the same fate, weathered the transition to sound and crowned his career with a blockbusting success, The Ten Commandments in 1956 in which he returned to the subject of one of his earliest triumphs. De Mille had grown up in a devout Episcopalian family, where the Bible was regularly read aloud by his father and he became very familiar with the Gustave Doré illustrations of the Bible, which became one of his continuing sources of inspiration. In the 1920s De Mille became one of the major exponents of the idea of the Ancient World as a lesson for the Modern. Male and Female (1919) was his ‘delightful’ adaptation of J.M. Barrie’s play The Admirable Crichton. The central idea was the comic possibilities of the idea of class reversal when, after a shipwreck, the butler becomes king of the desert island and the aristocratic family for whom he works become his servants. De Mille included a ﬂashback based on the story told in W.E. Henley’s poem ‘Or Ever the Knightly Years’ with its once-famous lines: ‘I was a King in Babylon/And you were a Christian Slave’. In Ancient Babylon, the King takes a female slave as his mistress and later, in a demonstration of autocratic power, sends her to her death in the lion’s den. The ﬁnal scene was a recreation of the celebrated Victorian painting ‘The Lion’s Bride’ by Gabriel Cornelius Ritter von Max.14 Manslaughter (1922) was the story of a jazz-mad girl whose dangerous driving causes the death of a police motorcyclist and earns her a sentence in jail where she learns the error of her ways. The ﬁlm was marketed with the slogan ‘A Drama of the Mad Age! Is the Modern World Racing to Ruin on a Wave of Jazz and Cocktails?’ To reinforce his message, De Mille cut from a scene of the excesses of 1920s ﬂappers to a ﬂashback to the decadence of Ancient Rome, characterized by orgies and gladiatorial displays. Although De Mille ensured that the ‘details of the food served at Roman banquets, the rules governing gladiatorial combat, the clothing and arms of Roman ministers, and the proper choreography of a Roman ballet’ were established by his team of researchers, Kevin Brownlow dismissed the sequence as ‘an excruciating combination of cardboard costumes and half-naked extras’.15 In Adam’s Rib (1922) De Mille told parallel tales of a love affair conducted in the present-day Museum of Ancient History (modelled on the Smithsonian\n\nT H E B I RT H O F T H E A N C I E N T WO R L D E P I C I N T H E C I N E M A\n\n33\n\nInstitution) and an affair conducted in prehistoric times, for which art director Wilfred Buckland con"
