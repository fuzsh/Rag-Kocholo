Some scenes were directed by Brian Desmond Hurst who took no formal credit. The picture was adapted from the play Caesar and Cleopatra (1901) by George Bernard Shaw, produced by Independent Producers and Pascal Film Productions, and distributed by Eagle-Lion Distributors.\n\nCaesar and Cleopatra failed to earn back its then colossal budget. It was nominated for an Oscar for Best Art Direction for John Bryan.\n\nPlot\n\nIn this philosophical coming-of-age film, an aging Julius Caesar takes possession of the Egyptian capital city of Alexandria, and tries to resolve a feud between young Princess Cleopatra and her younger brother Ptolemy. During the resulting sometimes-murderous court intrigues, Caesar develops a special relationship with Cleopatra, and teaches her how to use her royal power.\n\nCast\n\nVivien Leigh as Cleopatra\n\nClaude Rains as Caesar\n\nStewart Granger as Apollodorus\n\nFlora Robson as Ftatateeta\n\nFrancis L.
