        "text": "It isn’t essential to know the tempestuous tale of its making to revel in “Cleopatra,” Joseph L. Mankiewicz’s spectacular yet intimate 1963 feast of literary insight and melodramatic extravagance. It should neither help nor hinder delight in the movie to know that it cost more to make than any movie to date—reportedly, forty-four million dollars (which would be more than three hundred and thirty million dollars today). But, as with other unduly derided personal and visionary masterworks, such as “Heaven’s Gate” and “Ishtar,” that arose from extended and expensive productions, the budget is often the first thing that’s mentioned, and it’s good to get it out of the way. In the current issue of the magazine, I review the splendid new restoration and Blu-ray release of “Cleopatra,” which should help to launch the movie into its deserved place in Mankiewicz’s career and in the cinematic firmament.\n\nNonetheless, the story of the movie’s production—which is also the story of how the budget got so big—is pretty remarkable, and is told remarkably by its producer, Walter Wanger (writing with Joe Hyams), in the 1963 book, “My Life with Cleopatra,” also newly reissued. The story starts in 1958, when Wanger was hired by Fox to make the film as an independent producer. In 1959, casting began. Wanger wanted Elizabeth Taylor, though highers-up had considered others, including Sophia Loren, Audrey Hepburn, Susan Hayward, Suzy Parker, and Gina Lollobrigida. Rouben Mamoulian was brought in to direct (Wanger’s first choice had been Alfred Hitchcock). Taylor finally signed her contract in 1960, just before shooting began in London; by that time, millions had already been spent in preproduction.\n\nThe London shoot went terribly, due in part to Taylor’s ill health, in part to her dismay with the script, in part due to Mamoulian’s own lack of command, in part due to London weather. Three months of shooting were scrapped in 1961, when Mamoulian quit and was replaced by Mankiewicz. Amazingly, Mankiewicz, who was, of course, both a writer and a director, was hired to do both jobs. He quickly generated a script outline that was intended to yield two three-hour features: one about Caesar and Cleopatra, the other about Antony and Cleopatra.\n\nMeanwhile, Taylor’s health got worse, landing her in the hospital, near death from pneumonia. When she recovered, the production moved to Rome and started from scratch in September, 1961—with Mankiewicz writing the script at night for the next day’s action. Meanwhile, the paparazzi (who had only recently been given that immortal name, by Federico Fellini in “La Dolce Vita”) were making life for Taylor and her then husband, Eddie Fisher, miserable, and became all the more trouble when she began spending lots of time with her Antony, Richard Burton.\n\nThe Roman shoot, which ran through June, 1962, featured colossal sets, enormous manpower—seven thousand extras for one scene—and, for episodes of naval warfare, actual ships (“We had to get permission from the local government to rebuild some of the town’s bridges.”). The last leg of the shoot took place in Egypt later that summer, by which time the head of the studio who had backed the shoot to the bitter end, Spyros Skouras, was forced to resign. His successor, Darryl F. Zanuck, fired Mankiewicz, then rehired him to shoot additional scenes in March, 1963—and then took editorial control, cutting the movie into one four-hour feature.\n\nDespite its huge budget and massive cinematic machinery, “Cleopatra” is very much a personal movie. Mankiewicz, who had directed a 1953 version of “Julius Caesar,” starring James Mason, John Gielgud, and Marlon Brando, faced the same problem that every director faces when making a film set in ancient times, the problem that Howard Hawks cited in regard to his 1955 film, “Land of the Pharaohs”—nobody knows how people spoke then. Mankiewicz cut the Gordian knot: he made his ancient Romans and Egyptians speak like characters from such Mankiewicz movies as “All About Eve” and “People Will Talk,” with all the theatrical grandeur, self-confident knowledge, and transcendent legend that he had parcelled out to these films.\n\nMankiewicz was a master of melodrama, comedy, metaphysics (surprisingly), and sex. The attraction between the characters of Linda Darnell and Paul Douglas in “A Letter to Three Wives” and the erotic bond between Jean Simmons and Marlon Brando in “Guys and Dolls” have a surprising frankness. An intense strategic modernist, Mankiewicz honed his sense of power during a couple of years as a foreign correspondent in Weimar Germany and, soon thereafter, in the high-stakes infighting in Hollywood (where he started young, garnering an Oscar nomination for Best Adapted Screenplay in 1931, at the age of twenty-two). He was at home in Shakespeare, in historical politics (“Dragonwyck,” a blend of Tocqueville and Poe), in contemporary diplomacy (as in his intricate 1958 adaptation of Graham Greene’s “The Quiet American”), and in the Mafia (“House of Strangers”). But he also had a peculiar metaphysical side, as if investing his most charismatic characters with a sort of divine power, seen in the telekinetic ending of “A Letter to Three Wives”; the haunting story of Shunderson, returned from the dead, in “People Will Talk”; and the literal haunting of “The Ghost and Mrs. Muir.”\n\nMankiewicz’s “Cleopatra” is put together of the stuff of legend that the director experienced as personal reality, and he filmed the story as if he had been there. The film may be as close as Hollywood gets, outside the realm of Orson Welles, to a cinematic simulacrum of Shakespeare, less in its lucidly incisive, rhetorically reserved images than in its blend of coruscating language, rowdy comedy, and grand yet urgent and intimate performances. The fact that Taylor and Burton had become an item is obvious from watching the film; the passion that they generate on-screen has a thrillingly spontaneous, electric ardor. The production was cursed—and yet, in this regard, it was, perhaps more than any other, blessed.\n\n“Cleopatra” screens tonight at Film Forum—introduced by Walter Wanger’s daughters, Shelley Wanger and Stephanie Guest (their mother, by the way, was Wanger’s second wife, the great actress Joan Bennett). I’ve written often about the crucial role played by independent producers, in classic Hollywood and today, in liberating the best directors from the heavy hand of the studio system. Wanger—who produced such superb films as Fritz Lang’s “You Only Live Once,” “Scarlet Street,” and “Secret Beyond the Door”; Max Ophüls’s “The Reckless Moment”; and Jacques Tourneur’s first Western, “Canyon Passage”—was a friend to directors at a time when they needed all the friends they could get.\n\nCredit: Everett Collection."
