        "text": "Plot\n\nIn this philosophical coming-of-age film, an aging Julius Caesar takes possession of the Egyptian capital city of Alexandria, and tries to resolve a feud between young Princess Cleopatra and her younger brother Ptolemy. During the resulting sometimes-murderous court intrigues, Caesar develops a special relationship with Cleopatra, and teaches her how to use her royal power.\n\nCast\n\nClaude Rains as Julius Caesar, Roman conqueror of Egypt\n\nVivien Leigh as Cleopatra, young queen of Egypt\n\nStewart Granger as Apollodorus, a patrician amateur of the arts\n\nFlora Robson as Ftatateeta, Cleopatra's nurse, who murders her enemies on command\n\nFrancis L. Sullivan as Pothinus, Egyptian courtier, tutor and guardian of Cleopatra's brother Ptolemy XIII\n\nBasil Sydney as Rufio, Roman general\n\nCecil Parker as Britannus, Brittanic slave to Caesar\n\nStanley Holloway as Belzanor\n\nRaymond Lovell as Lucius Septimus, Roman occupier of Egypt\n\nErnest Thesiger as Theodotus, Greek savant\n\nAnthony Harvey as Ptolemy, child king of Egypt\n\nLeo Genn as bearer of evil tidings\n\nJean Simmons as harpist\n\nMichael Rennie as quayside centurion\n\nRonald Shiner as second porter\n\nRoger Moore as Extra (uncredited)\n\nProduction\n\nFilmed in Technicolor with lavish sets, the production was reported to be the most expensive film ever made in Britain at the time, costing Â£1,278,000.\n\nPascal ordered sand from Egypt to get the right cinematic color. The production also ran into delays due to being filmed during the Second World War. During the shoot, Vivien Leigh tripped and miscarried.\n\nThe film was described as a \"box office stinker\" at the time, and almost ended Pascal's career. It was the first Shaw film made in colour, and the last film version of a Shaw play during his lifetime. After Shaw's death in 1950, Pascal went on to produce one more Shaw-derived film, Androcles and the Lion in 1952.\n\nReception\n\nAccording to trade papers, the film was a \"notable box office attraction\" at British cinemas."
