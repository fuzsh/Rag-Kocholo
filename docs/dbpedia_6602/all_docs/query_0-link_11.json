Sure enough, Saxon’s behavior soon ruins Alma’s nightclub audition.\n\nIt isn’t long before Saxon makes a pest of himself, interrupting a beach vacation Eric and Janet take, closing the show after a poor review, then persuading Eric to go off by himself to do rewrites.

Alma gets a chance to be in a Hollywood movie, but Saxon interferes with that as well. Janet, upset by Eric’s absences, begins drinking and threatens to leave him.
