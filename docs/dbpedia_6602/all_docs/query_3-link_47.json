        "text": "Length of film: 248 Minutes (Director’s Cut: 320 Minutes)\n\nRated: G\n\nGenre: Biography, Drama, History\n\nDirector: Joseph L. Mankiewicz\n\nStarring: Elizabeth Taylor, Richard Burton, Rex Harrison, Pamela Brown, George Cole, Hume Cronyn\n\nIMDB Rank: 7.0/10\n\nPart 1 Time: 117 Minutes (Director’s Cut: N/A )\n\nPart 2 Time: 131 Minutes (Director’s Cut: N/A )\n\nWhere does the first part end? Julius Caesar (Rex Harrison) is assassinated in Rome, Cleopatra (Elizabeth Taylor) leaves Rome with her son Caesarion (Loris Loddi). Mark Anthony (Richard Burton) speaks with Cleopatra at the docks.\n\nFinal line of dialogue on the first part: “In any case try to remember.” Cleopatra speaks to Mark Antony prior to leaving Rome.\n\nFirst line of dialogue on the second part: Narrator speaks, “And for more than two years, did Anthony seek the assassins of Caesar.”\n\nHow jarring is it when the first part ends? Jarring, Cleopatra and her Egyptian armies have officially claimed loyalty to Julius Caesar. However, Julius Caesar has been betrayed by the Roman Republic. With Julius Caesar’s death the Roman Republic is now in a power struggle between members of the Second Triumvirate (Octavian, Mark Antony, and Lepidus). Cleopatra returns to Egypt. Octavian (Roddy McDowall) begins his campaign to control the Mediterranean sea with resistance.\n\nWhich part is better? The film is clearly split into two relationship dramas and was originally meant to be two separate films. The first part focuses on the Julius Caesar/Cleopatra relationship. Whereas the second part shows the Mark Anthony/Cleopatra relationship. Although the second part brings closure to the Cleopatra/Rome saga, the first part is more compelling as it shows the strong relationship between Caesar and Cleopatra who ultimately see one another as the divine ruler of their lands."
