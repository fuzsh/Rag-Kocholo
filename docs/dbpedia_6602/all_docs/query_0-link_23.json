        "text": "Despite the play being misleadingly subtitled “A Romance in Five Acts,” George Bernard Shaw has always been adamant that Pygmalion’s denouement should not be interpreted as romantic. Yet from the first London production of the play in 1914 to producer Gabriel Pascal’s 1938 film, Alan Jay Lerner’s 1956 libretto and George Cukor’s 1964 adaptation, it seems that no one has been able to resist the urge to romanticize the relationship between Henry Higgins and Eliza Doolittle. This paper focuses on what such romanticizing entails in terms of aesthetics and politics. I will qualify the common assumption according to which Alan Jay Lerner subverted Shaw’s original intentions by trying to demonstrate that the revised ending foregrounds rather than subverts Shaw’s feminist vision.\n\nEliza Doolittle and the phonograph/gramophone are gendered and objectified throughout Pygmalion, given how often Higgins and Pickering conflate her identity with the machine. In parallel, Ireland was also often gendered as female and compared to the gramophone during the 3rd Home Rule debates. Pygmalion represents the detriments of this political gendering, but ultimately depicting Eliza's (and the parallel Ireland's) declaration of independence from the machine and her mentor, signaling​ the successes of the finally passed Home Rule.\n\nShaw, the larger-than-life playwright who called himself “a bit of an actor,” was often preoccupied with role-playing. In “Acting, by One Who Does Not Believe in It,” a paper delivered at a Fabian meeting in 1889, Shaw asserted that acting — often denounced as shamming — can actually be an avenue to “metaphysical self-realization.” Employing a metadramatic approach to Pygmalion, the following article finds connections between Shaw’s career as a dramatist and the mixed outcomes of Henry and Eliza’s journeys into “metaphysical self-realization.”\n\nThe connection between mechanical voice reproduction and artificial femininity, popularized most recently by Apple’s debut of Siri for the iPhone in 2011, dates nearly to the very moment of the introduction of the phonograph in 1877. This connection was reinforced in the literature of the period, where it served to preserve or question traditional Victorian gender roles amid social and economic changes that were already upending them. In this essay, I build upon arguments in my book Victorian Soundscapes to sketch a trajectory of imaginative representation of the “female talking machine” across what historian of technology Vaclav Smil has identified as “the Age of Synergy” – that is, from Edison’s 1880s talking doll to E. E. Kellett’s turn of the century short story “The Lady Automaton” and on through George Bernard Shaw’s Pygmalion. After mapping out the figure of the female voice engine along this arc, from speaking automaton to autonomous vocalist, I conclude by suggesting how the demands of post-war capitalist mass entertainment sought to undermine if not reverse it.\n\nIn this essay I explore the Freudian concepts of transference, the unconscious, and analysis in the context of Eliza Doolittle’s linguistic transformation, and, because Freudian theory also posits the transformation of the therapist through a transference process, I suggest that Higgins undergoes his own talking cure in the course of the play.\n\nThis project studies the translation of two Cockney features into Spanish in the dubbing of the films Pygmalion (1938) and My Fair Lady (1964). The source excerpts in Cockney that have been chosen in this study are those which, in their pronunciation in the English versions of the films show two phonetic features of Cockney: diphthong alteration (in particular /eɪ/ and /əʊ/) and /h/ alteration (this includes /h/-dropping and /h/-insertion). A descriptive approach has been chosen, and a quantitative methodology has been used. Using the sample taken from the original films and the dubbed versions into Spanish, a contrastive analysis has been carried out in order to find out the aspects that may have determined the strategies used by each of the translations. These have been compared in order to find out whether they show any relevant differences."
