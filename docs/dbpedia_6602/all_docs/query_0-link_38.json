        "text": "In 1923, the preeminent Russian poet Vladimir Mayakovsky gathered the main forces of the Soviet avant-garde under the umbrella of the Left Front of the Arts (LEF) and its two journals, LEF (1923–1925) and Novyi LEF (1927–1928). This dissertation examines the contribution of LEF’s screenwriters to the film industry in the 1920s and early 1930s by focusing on the screenwriting oeuvre of the journals’ editors—Osip Brik, Sergei Tretiakov, and Vladimir Mayakovsky. Part and parcel of a larger discussion about the role of screenplays in Soviet film studies, LEF’s screenwriting remains one of the most obscure aspects of the group’s engagement with cinema. The central argument of this thesis elaborates the view that these authors’ film- works had a closer connection to the group’s ethos than previously understood. My analyses rely on the examination of Brik, Tretiakov, and Mayakovsky’s screen ideas alongside relevant theoretical articles, extant film footage, archival sources, historical cine-press publications, and personal memoirs. The findings of this study contribute to a deeper understanding of the relationship between the group’s screenwriting theory and praxis. ii This dissertation is organized into four chapters, an introduction, and a conclusion. The introduction delineates the research nexus, followed by chapter 1 that discusses the operational definition of LEF and traces the diachronic development of its engagement with the cine- medium. Chapter 2 uncovers links between LEF’s project and Osip Brik’s film-works and analyzes his authorship model through Viktor Shklovsky’s paradigm of literaturnaia podenshchina (daily literary labor). Chapter 3 demonstrates how Sergei Tretiakov’s idea of production screenplay was implemented in the corpus of his Georgian films. It also discusses Tretiakov’s authorship model through the concept of operative author, as theorized by Walter Benjamin. Chapter 4 evaluates Vladimir Mayakovsky’s screenplays written during the LEF period by drawing out their auteur features and juxtaposing them against the broader scope of the group’s film-works. By charting LEF’s contribution to cinema via categories of production principles, ideology, innovation, and authorship models, this dissertation advances a comprehensive view of the group’s participation in cinema. It contributes to the interdisciplinary field of avant-garde studies, as well as to the scholarship on Soviet cinema of the silent era.\n\nThroughout the 1920s, German-language film journalism addressed fundamental questions about the encounter between music and cinema. Prominent composers, musicologists, and film theorists contributed to this broad discussion on the proper role and design of silent film music, encompass- ing a wide range of arguments and perspectives. This article outlines the development of the film music debate on the film journal Reichsfilmblatt from 1924 to 1929, with special focus on the di- alectical interplay between theoretical concerns and compositional issues. Starting from the mid-1920s, Reichsfilmblatt encouraged composers and music directors to con- tribute their opinions concerning the art of film music composition at large, ranging from compila- tion guides to accompaniment practices, and from illustrative techniques to dramaturgic strategies. Particular attention to compositional issues is evident from the presence of regular columns by mu- sic critics. Film music theoreticians like Hans Erdmann or Ludwig Brav, however, reached well be- yond the horizon of a film music criticism, even theorising new compositional approaches to film composition. Thanks to the contributions of film music specialists, such as Giuseppe Becce, Paul Dessau, and Friedrich Holländer, among others, Reichsfilmblatt also dealt with a large number of questions re- lated to the execution of musical accompaniments. Journalistic criticism debated the techniques of conducting film music and evaluated the basic configuration of a salon orchestra, as well as the pe- culiarities of certain instruments. From 1927, Reichsfilmblatt finally confronted the question of the mechanisation of music performance: a large number of articles discussed the revolution provoked by the discovery of recorded sound on both theoretical and practical levels.\n\nBritish film music in the 1930s might be defined by its variety. Unlike its Hollywood counterpart, there was no fully developed 'production line' system to the creation of film scores. However most studios still had a musical director, who was responsible for brokering composer deals and seeing a project to completion. This paper will examine a few individuals working in Britain at the time, including Muir Mathieson, Arthur Bliss and Mischa Spolianski, and will unpack some of the diplomacy that had to be negotiated to produce some of the major scores of the period. I will ask to what extent MDs actually engineered the stylistic direction of the music, and why some working relationships lasted whilst others withered.\n\nBased on the analysis of film studies concepts (in the context of the socio-cultural and political situation, etc.) of the first decade of the existence of the journal Cinema Art (1931–1941), the authors came to the conclusion that theoretical works on cinematographic topics during this period can be divided into the following types: - ideologized articles by Association of Revolutionary Cinematographers activists (1931–1932), emphasizing the dominance of \"truly revolutionary proletarian cinema\" and an uncompromising struggle with the views of any opponents; - ideologically reoriented articles (1932–1934), written as a positive reaction to the Resolution of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (of Bolsheviks) “On the restructuring of literary and artistic organizations” (1932), many provisions of which (in particular, a clear indication that that the framework of the proletarian literary and artistic organizations) have become a direct threat to the existence of the Association of Revolutionary Cinematographers; in articles of this kind, activists of the Association of Revolutionary Cinematographers — until the liquidation of this organization in early 1935 – tried to prove their necessity and loyalty to the “general line of the Communist party”; - Articles containing sharp criticism of \"groupism\" (including among the Association of Revolutionary Cinematographers), \"enemies of the people\", etc. (1935–1938); - theoretical articles attacking various types of formalistic phenomena (primarily in the field of montage) in cinema and culture (1931–1941); - theoretical articles opposing empiricism, \"documentaryism\", naturalism and physiology, vulgar materialism, aestheticism, \"emotionalism\" on the basis of Marxist-Leninist ideological and class approaches (1931–1941); - theoretical articles defending the principles of socialist realism in cinema (1933–1941); - theoretical articles criticizing bourgeois film theories and Western influence on Soviet cinema (1931–1941); - theoretical articles aimed primarily at professional problems of mastering sound in cinema (in particular, the dramaturgy of sound, music), editing, image, film image, film language (for example, the cinematic possibilities of the “zeit-loop” effect), cinema style, genre, entertainment, construction script (plot, composition, conflict, typology of characters, typology of comic devices, etc.), acting, etc. (1931–1941); - theoretical articles balancing between ideology and professional approaches to the creation of cinematic works of art (1931–1941)."
