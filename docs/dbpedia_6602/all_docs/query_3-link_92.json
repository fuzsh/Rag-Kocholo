        "text": "Synopsis:\n\nThe story of the legendary Egyptian Queen (Elizabeth Taylor, Cat on a Hot Tin Roof). The film focuses primarily on her relationships with Julius Caesar (Rex Harrison, My Fair Lady) and Marc Anthony (Richard Burton, The Robe).\n\nReaction & Thoughts:\n\n“Just as the Mother Nile feeds and replenishes the Earth, I am the Nile.\n\n“Cleopatra was conceived in emergency, shot in hysteria, and wound up in blind panic,” the film’s director, Joseph L. Mankiewicz (All About Eve), once said. This troubled production faced an endless amount of problems, yet the final product is rather good for the most part. There is really only one thing wrong with this movie: it goes on and on and on. At more than four hours, the film overstays its welcome. That being said, Cleopatra is much better than what the naysayers would let you believe.\n\nI hadn’t seen the movie in years, but it’s actually much better than I remembered. Written by Ranald MacDougall (Mildred Pierce), Sidney Buchman (Here Comes Mr. Jordan), Ben Hecht (Foreign Correspondent and Notorious), and director Mankiewicz, Cleopatra is a flawed super-epic where the good tend to offset the not so good.\n\nThe first half, which depicts Cleopatra’s relationship with Julius Caesar, is rock-solid. I loved the way this section of the film deals with the politics of the era. There is hardly any action, this section is rather slow, but the dialogue is good, and the scenes are smoothly staged. Rex Harrison is excellent as Caesar, and he brings out the best in Liz Taylor. When Harrison exits the narrative, the film begins to die bit by bit, though.\n\nThe second half revolves around the relationship between Cleopatra and Marc Anthony. Richard Burton is a little stiff as Anthony, but the truth is that the character is poorly developed. In addition, the scenes between Burton and Taylor aren’t as well-written as the scenes between Harrison and Taylor. Dick and Liz, of course, fell in love during the making of the film, but their on-screen romance isn’t all that exciting.\n\nWorst of all, nothing interesting happens during the last hour. There is one huge sea battle, but it ends abruptly, and we go back to many long, talky sequences that have no real pay off. However, the superb visuals tie the film together. The sets are amazing. Cleopatra’s Rome entrance is simply spectacular. The Oscar-winning costumes are fantastic as well– Taylor changes clothes every two minutes!\n\nLeon Shamroy’s (Leave Her to Heaven) Oscar-winning camera work is breathtaking. Alex North’s (To Kill a Mockingbird) superb music score is another plus. And the supporting cast is excellent: Roddy McDowall (Lassie Comes Home), Hume Cronyn (Cocoon), Martin Landau (Ed Wood), Carroll O’Connor (TV’s All in the Family), Finlay Currie (Othello), Robert Stephens (The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie), etc.\n\nConclusions & Final Thoughts:\n\nOn an interesting note, writer-director Joseph L. Mankiewicz initially had the then revolutionary idea of releasing Cleopatra as a two-part movie: Cleopatra and Caesar and Cleopatra and Marc Anthony. The studio behind the film, 20th Century Fox, vetoed Mankiewicz’s proposal, but I think that would have fixed some of the issues I have with the movie. Flaw and all, this is a must-see production, the kind of Hollywood spectacle that will never be seen again. Color, 251 minutes, Rated G.\n\nTheatrical Trailer:"
