        "text": "It is one of the most expensive films to ever come out of Hollywood by 1963, and still remains one of the most expensive. Though despite the film being the highest-grossing film of the year and had a ton of Oscar buzz (including nominations for Best Picture, Sound, Actor, Editing, and Score, also winning for Best Cinematography, Art Direction, Costume Design, and Visual Effects), Cleopatra remains one of Hollywood's infamous box-office flops of all-time, causing studio 20th Century Fox to go bankrupt (with a film about a singing nun to save them) and weakened the impact of the classic Hollywood epic. This backstory is one reason why I decided to give Cleopatra a shot, to see if the film was really a flop or if it deserved a second look, as the mixed critical reception suggests. Sadly, Cleopatra failed to impress me as other epics of its day have done, and is definitely a classic Hollywood failure.\n\nDirected by Joseph Mankiewicz, Cleopatra tells the story of the fall of the Egyptian Empire, and the rise of the Roman Empire. Egyptian queen Cleopatra (Elizabeth Taylor) has a love affair with Julius Caesar (Rex Harrison) as a sex tool to form an alliance with Rome to maintain her empire. The plan works, with the two gaining a son in the process, but things fall apart when Caesar is brutally murdered by the Roman Senate, causing Cleopatra to turn to a new victim, Roman general Mark Antony (Richard Burton). But when Antony's ruthless power is weakened due to Cleopatra's flaws, Egypt is doomed and the two lovers are as doomed as Romeo and Juliet, and the rest is history.\n\nUsually I would enjoy these epics, especially films that are ambitious in recreate historic events. Why does Cleopatra fain as a motion picture? First, at over four hours, its way too long to tell it's story. I know other epics of its day were about the same length (like Ben-Hur, The Ten Commandments, and Lawrence of Arabia), but even with a lengthy runtime, those films were very engaging to where the time flew by. Here, the pacing is torturously slow. The first half pre-intermission is on Cleopatra's affair with Caesar, while the second half is between her and Antony, and it's done at a very super slow pacing. It was so slow that it took me two days to finish the entire film as I was falling asleep by the time the first half ended. If the film ended after Caesar's death, the film would have made a stronger ending than what we got in the end, cause by the second half of the film, I just couldn't care anymore.\n\nThe spectacle of Cleopatra, while I give credit for trying its hardest, just bores immediately after it first catches the eye. I kid you not, there's at least 20 minutes of just a worthless parade of nearly-nude dancers welcoming the arrival of Cleopatra arriving in Rome, and it's pointless. Sure it provides awe, glamor, and spectacle of a traditional epic, but it's dull. Cleopatra uncovering her golden boat could have been a spectacular moment for the ages, but it's so... boring. Battle scenes of Roman and Egyptian armies could have been the highlight of the film, but guess what... it's boring after just two seconds of feeling like you're the king of the world (forgive me for the Titanic reference). I did enjoy the death of Caesar scene, but the buildup to one of the most brutal deaths in history nearly put me to sleep. I think Fox needed to save their money wasted on splendor that dulled my mind and spent it on making the film more interesting. Oh well, at least it had decent cinematography that kept my interest, sort of.\n\nMaking it worse to think about is the actual story of the film. Though its based on historic events, the way Mankiewicz films Cleopatra made me want to take a nap. While Cleopatra, Julius Caesar, and Mark Antony are interesting people in real-life, there was literally nothing that made me want to hang out with these people for four hours, plus the love stories are even more dull and the action is replaced by just dull talk. At least I got a kick out of some of these lines of dialogue, as they were very entertaining:\n\n\"You, a descendant of generations of inbred, incestuous, mental defectives! \"\n\n\"You have such bony knees. \"\n\n\"Your tongue is old, but sharp, Cicero. Be careful how you wag it. One day it will cut off your head\"\n\nand my personal favorite,\n\n\"My breasts are full of love and life. My hips are round and well apart. Such women, they say, have sons. \"\n\nConsidering my hate for Cleopatra, the acting is still fairly solid. While the doomed Shakespearian-styled romance of Mark Antony and Cleopatra is painfully annoying like Romeo and Juliet, both Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton have fun chemistry in otherwise dull material. Rex Harrison, on the other hand, was nominated for an Academy Award for his performance as Julius Caesar, and he definitely was the most entertaining. While the direction and the characterization is painful to watch, it's that Rex charisma that causes him to deliver the film fro getting a 0% in my book. It would have been more awesome had Rex done the role of Caesar in a biopic of the character, cause without the Cleopatra arc, it would have been much more entertaining, much more brutal, and much more awesome. Oddly enough, Mankiewicz made a Julius Caesar movie in 1953 with Marlon Brando (though not Caesar), which has much more acclaim than this. Hopefully it has more power and roughness than this mess.\n\nThe best thing though about the film is Alex North's score. I think if it was used in a whole different movie, his powerhouse, authentic material would have been better than what was used here. Though the film fails to impress, it's the score that has that \"wow\" feeling that the actual film lacks.\n\nBut despite the epic score, the decent acting performances, and cinematography, there's almost nothing to like about this snoozefest of a movie. I have no idea why this managed to get a Best Picture nomination! The pacing is a bore, the spectacle dulls the senses, the characters are uninteresting, the romance is Hollywood at its lowest level, and money was definitely wasted, ruining the reputation of director Joseph Mankiewicz. Thankfully, none of the stars' careers were hurt, both Taylor and Burton starred again in the acclaimed (and controversial) Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf, and Rex Harrison won an Oscar a year later for his delightfully awesome performance in My Fair Lady. With Ang Lee rumored to direct an update on Cleopatra, with Angelia Jolie considered for the role, hopefully Hollywood will finally get it right, spend money on making the story more interesting instead of wasting it on spectacle and visuals. But with many modern blockbusters doing just that today, it'll be hard for that wish to come true.\n\n\"How DARE you and the rest of your barbarians set fire to my library? Play conqueror all you want, Mighty Caesar! Rape, murder, pillage thousands, even millions of human beings! But neither you nor any other barbarian has the right to destroy one human thought!\"\n\n3/10"
