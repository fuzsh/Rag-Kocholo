Sullivan, Robert Adams, and Basil Sydney. Gabriel Pascal directed the historical epic.\n\nThe poster measures 27\" x 41\" and has been linen-backed for long-term preservation and display. The poster was in good to very good condition prior to restoration with pinholes and a few tape stains in the corners from theatrical display, minor surface and edge wear, and tiny separations at the cross-folds. It was folded at the time of printing but the folds are less noticeable after linen-backing. Linen-backed posters are stored flat and rolled for shipping in a rigid, tube mailer.\n\nPlease look closely at the photos (this is the exact poster you are buying). It is not cropped or a stock image.\n\nThis rare and collectible movie poster, printed in 1951 to promote a limited, theatrical re-release of Caesar and Cleopatra, is not a reproduction or a reprint.\n\nCERTIFICATE OF AUTHENTICITY (COA) INCLUDED"
