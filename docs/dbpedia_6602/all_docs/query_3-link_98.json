        "text": "FORGET the fantastic sum that \"Cleopatra\" is reported to have cost. Forget the length of time it took to make it and all the tattle of troubles they had, including the behavior of two of its spotlighted stars. The memorable thing about this picture, which opened last night at the Rivoli, is that it is a surpassing entertainment, one of the great epic films of our day.This may come as surprising information to those who have blindly assumed that any film of such mammoth proportions (it runs a few minutes more than four hours, excluding the intermission) and which has gone through so much storm and strife could not possibly be a cohesive, intelligent piece of work. But the slip-up in this assumption was that it didn't make due allowance for the tremendous potential of the story and the proven skill of the artists who did the job.After all, what we know from history of the ancient Egyptian queen, who cast her spell over the two great Roman generals Julius Caesar and Mark Antony and, by her relations with them, affected the destiny of the world, is fraught with imperishable romance, adventure and tragedy. It is history of mighty dimensions, human drama on a grand and noble scale, which has fired the imaginations of poets and playwrights from Shakespeare to Shaw.Why, then, shouldn't this tremendous story be envisioned supremely on the screen, which has the facilities for showing the true magnitude of great events, as well as the close, emotional contacts of strong personalities? There is no reason why it shouldn't. And the bright news this morning is that, thanks to the aptness of the medium, to fine photography in color and Todd-AO, and to the skill of many fine artists, it has been envisoned handsomely.In this exciting achievement. Joseph L. Mankiewicz. as the screen playwright and director, has played the most influential role. For it is his fabrication of characters of colorfulness and depth, who stand forth as thinking, throbbing people against a background of splendid spectacle, that gives vitualit to this picture and is the key to its success.These are not obvious actors in geegaw costumes who march around in a fake world staked out by Cecil B. DeMille. (You may remember he did a \"Cleopatra\" a lulu-back in 1934.) These are plausible people, maturely conceived and turned loose in a realm of political intrigues, conflicts and thrusts for personal power. They are moved by considerable forces, of political intrigues, conflicts and thrusts for personal power. They are moved byconsiderable forces, emboldened by well-defined desires, and they speak literate words that crackle wih sophisticated imagery and wit.Elizabeth Taylor's Cleopatra is a woman of force and dignity, fired by a fierce ambition to conquer and rule the world—at least, the world of the Mediterranean basin—through the union of Egypt and Rome. In her is impressively compacted the arrogance and pride of an ancient queen.But she is not an ancient queen, mind you, in the quality of her thought—nor, indeed, in the modified high style of her exceedingly lower gowns, Mr. Mankicwicz has wisely not attempted to present us with historical copies. He and the writers who have helped him have drawn their major dramatic episodes from Plutarch. Suetonins and others. But the minds of their characters work along lines more in accord with contemporary thought, just as do those of the characters in the plays of Shakespeare and Shaw.Thus Miss Taylor's sultry sovereign is a temptress who also can tap Alexander the Great's ambition to rule the world as a \"grand design\": who can urge the visiting Caesar with this ambition in familiar \"one-word\" terms and who can dare, when the great Roman general is solemnly placing her on her throne, to note sotto voce that his knees are bony or, when they meet later in Rome throw a wink at him.She is likewise clever and passionate, able to lure Caesar to her bed with chic and voluptuous seductions and with the promise of a son. Yet she is powerless to avoid a howling tantrum when she is deserted temporarily by Antony. It is her varied dispositions and approaches to those two men respectful and confident towards Caesar, domineering and adoring towards Antony that mark the dramatic pattern and bulge the emotional bounds.Caesar is no fustian tyrant. Played stunningly by Rex Harrison, he is a statesman of manifest wisdom, shrewdness and magnanimity. And he is also a fascinating study in political ambiguities. He is torn by loyalty, ambition and wishes for his son. Mr. Harrison's faceted performance is the best in the film.But Richard Burton is nonetheless exciting as the arrogant Antony - a man the very opposite of Caesar, whom he would so much like to be. He is the stubborn professional soldier, aspiring to statesmanlike deeds, but lacking the brains, the self-assurance, everything but the raw vitality. The tragedy lies in his incompetence to accomplish Cleopatra's bold design, while being inevitably locked to her — and she to him—by the bonds of love.By virtue of brilliant staging, Mr. Mankiewiez keeps this well-known tale moving with visual excitements that increase the dramatic flow and give extraordinary insights into the characters.One of the most spectacular even's is the entrance of Cleopatra into Rome to establish her union with Caesar and present the obvious claim of their son. In a mammoth parade of mounted horsemen, leaping athletes, dancing girls and massed bands banging out the music of Alex North fit to set your blood on fire, she is drawn into the forecourt of the Forum, where Caesar awaits her???, ??? a huge mobile sphinx.The a???ment is one of regal ???splender and political pageantry. Yet the dynamic tension in the incident is in the coming together of the two, Caesar and Cleopatra, daring each other and all of Rome.Brilliant, too, is the staging of the drama of Caesar's murder and funeral. The first is seen in pantomime by Cleopatra, as in a vision, through the flames of a priestess's fire. And the second is played with the fierceness of some barbaric rite, performed at night before the Fodum, with Antony's fiery eulogy drowned out by the roar of the masses chanting what sounded like \"slog heil!\"There is so much else that is exciting—the naval battle of Actium, described with huge dashing galleys and tiny models on a plotting board; the famous orgy on the barge of Cleopatra; the drama of Antony riding out, all alone, deserted by his soldiers, to face the army of Octavian in the final humiliation of himself and his fatalistic love.There are also so many people who are to be credited with fine work—Roddy McDowall as the sinuous Octavian; Hume Cronyn as the sage Sosigenes, counselor to Cleopatra; Cesare Danova as her loyal bodyguard; Martin Landau as Rufio, a Roman general, and many more. And there are others to thank—Walter Wanger, who originated and produced the film; Leon Shamroy who directed the photography; Mr. North who wrote the potent musical score.There may be those who will find the length too tiring, the emphasis on Roman politics a bit too involved and tedious, the luxuriance too much. But unless you are one of those skeptics who are stubbornly predisposed to give \"Cleopatra\" the needle. I don't see how you can fail to find this a generally brilliant, moving and satisfying film.\n\nThe CastCLEOPATRA, screenplay by Joseph L. Mankiewicz, Ranald MacDougall and Sidney Buchman.
