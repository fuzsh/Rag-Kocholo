        "text": "There are funny moments, tender moments, and moments that don't quite gel. But the decades-long connection at the heart is tenderly played and anchors the surrounding chaos right through to the final scene.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3/5 | Mar 15, 2023\n\nThere are some amusing scenes built around the splattering of smart gags, but this is a comedy that always finds bathos when it hunts for pathos, and seems powered by desperation rather than energy.\n\nFull Review | Apr 13, 2022\n\nThere are some funny lines In Peter's Friends, but the film amounts to little more than a collection of broadly drawn sketches In search of a structure.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 0/3 | Apr 13, 2022\n\nThe clever, facile Peter's Friends doesn't bear much scrutiny, and its attempts at pathos are more opportunistic than earned. Still, Branagh knows how to put on a lively show.\n\nFull Review | May 25, 2018\n\nMany of the lines and the shadings brought to them by these expert performers are good for some laughs, and pic has plenty of energy, but it can't be taken as seriously as it wants to be.\n\nFull Review | Mar 26, 2009\n\n...a surprisingly entertaining little flick that benefits substantially from the almost uniformly stellar performances...\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3/4 | Feb 10, 2008"
