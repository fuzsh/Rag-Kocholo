        "text": "Sir Kenneth Branagh’s autobiographical drama Belfast won the prestigious People’s Choice Award at the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF) on Saturday. This, in itself, is an honor, but for those who like to sink their teeth into “awards season,” it is one heck of a bellwether. As Oscar-watchers will tell you, films that win this award—which is selected by TIFF’s audiences themselves, not a small jury—are almost guaranteed strong positioning for the Academy Awards.\n\nFrom 2008 to 2020, all but one winner of TIFF’s audience award were nominated for the best picture Oscar. To remind you, they are: Nomadland, Jojo Rabbit, Green Book, Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri, La La Land, Room, The Imitation Game, 12 Years a Slave, Silver Linings Playbook, The Kings Speech, Precious: Based on the Novel ‘Push’ by Sapphire, and Slumdog Millionaire. (If you were scratching your head looking for the gap, it was Nadine Labaki’s Where Do We Go Now? from 2010—a good movie!) Of that bunch, Nomadland, 12 Years a Slave, The King’s Speech, and Slumdog Millionaire ultimately took the Academy Awards’ top prize.\n\nIn V.F.’s review of Belfast, Richard Lawson wrote that Branagh avoids typical autobiographical “aggrandizement, partly because he did, actually, grow up in interesting times” and praised the film for “an admirable lack of the expected schmaltz.” Branagh lived the first nine years of his life in the city of the film’s title, during the years of sectarian violence known as The Troubles. The movie stars Jude Hill as Branagh’s young stand-in, Jamie Dornan and Caitríona Balfe as his parents, and Ciarán Hinds and Dame Judi Dench as his grandparents.\n\nThe positive reaction to Belfast is a welcome return for Branagh, who came on the film scene in 1989 directing himself in Henry V. His energetic adaptation nimbly swept some of the cobwebs away from Shakespeare-on-film. The following year, at the ripe old age of 30, he published an autobiography (actually written when he was 28) about his stage successes. After Henry V, he released the Hitchcockian Dead Calm and followed that up with the romantic comedy Peter’s Friends. It seemed, in the early 1990s, as if Branagh had the Midas touch. His more recent work had suggested this golden age might not endure, but if anyone can jump from Artemis Fowl (that was him?) to a winner like Belfast, Sir Ken is the guy.\n\nTIFF’s second and third place prizes went to a Canadian drama about kids growing up in a low-income neighborhood called Scarborough directed by Shasha Nakhai and Rich Williamson, and Jane Campion’s The Power of the Dog. (The latter, a Benedict Cumberbatch-led Western melodrama, also took home the bronze at Venice.)\n\nThe top documentary prize went to The Rescue, a National Geographic co-production directed by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin about the 2018 rescue of a group of teens trapped in a cave in Thailand.\n\nFrench director Julia Ducournau, who won the Palme d’Or at Cannes, won TIFF’s Midnight Madness award for her impossible-to-succinctly-synopsize horror-drama Titane.\n\nCumberbatch won the TIFF Tribute Tribute Award for best actor for a double-showing in The Power of the Dog and Will Sharpe’s The Electrical Life of Louis Wain, a biopic about the troubled illustrator living in Victorian England. Jessica Chastain claimed the best actress prize for her swing-for-the-fences portrayal of Tammy Faye Bakker in The Eyes of Tammy Faye, and Dionne Warwick won a Special Tribute Award for the documentary Dionne Warwick: Don't Make Me Over.\n\nAnd riding an enormous sandworm to victory, Canadian auteur Denis Villeneuve won the TIFF Ebert Directing Award for his zillion-dollar adaptation of Frank Herbert’s interplanetary tale of conquest, Dune.\n\nMore Great Stories From Vanity Fair\n\n— Unhappy Little Trees: The Dark Legacy of Bob Ross\n\n— The True Story of a Hollywood Partnership Built and Destroyed by Money, Sex, and Celebrity\n\n— Ted Lasso’s Roy Kent on Why the Show Isn’t “Warm and Fuzzy”\n\n— Caftans, Goyard, and Elvis: Inside The White Lotus’s Costumes\n\n— The Chair Is Like an Academic Game of Thrones\n\n— The Best Movies and Shows Streaming on Netflix This Month\n\n— Rachael Leigh Cook on Reclaiming She’s All That\n\n— Watch Kristen Stewart Channel Princess Di in Spencer’s Official Trailer\n\n— From the Archive: Jeffrey Epstein and Hollywood’s Omnipresent Publicist\n\n— Sign up for the “HWD Daily” newsletter for must-read industry and awards coverage—plus a special weekly edition of “Awards Insider.”\n\nToronto Film Festival\n\nKenneth Branagh Goes Home in Belfast\n\nIt’s not as sweeping as Roma, but the director’s own film memoir has its wistful pleasures.\n\nAwards Insider Exclusive Preview\n\nKenneth Branagh Gets Personal With Belfast\n\nThe director’s semi-autobiographical film is set in 1969, when rioting broke out in his childhood neighborhood, but evokes familiar feelings of unease in the COVID era.\n\nAward Season\n\nVenice and Toronto Film Festival Lineups Raise Our Oscar Hopes\n\nHotly anticipated films like Joker: Folie à Deux and The Piano Lesson are mixed with some wild cards that could shake up awards season.\n\nAward Season\n\nHow Ripley Changed Dakota Fanning: “If I Can Do That, I Can Do Anything”\n\nAfter nearly 25 years onscreen, Fanning just received her first Emmy nomination for the Netflix series.
