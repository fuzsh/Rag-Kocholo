        "text": "This is not the type of film I had expected the multi-talented Branagh to make next; after the success of Henry V and the scissor-heavy film noir Dead Again, an ensemble comedy of this type seems, at first, to be an odd next choice. Branagh, however, manages to subvert the Big Chill-isms in this tale of six old friends meeting up again after a period of ten years. Aristocratic Peter has just inherited his father's estate, and, not quite sure what he wants to do with it at this point, he decides instead to throw a reunion party for his long-ago friends Mary and Roger (married, with problems), Carol and Andrew (married, with other problems), Maggie (unmarried, but with her eye on the unknowing Peter), and Sarah (unmarried, but never alone). As the guests arrive, so does their emotional baggage, and before the night is over, old wounds are re-opened and poor Peter is bemoaning the fate of what should have been a loving, sentimental get-together. Throughout the film (co-written by comedienne Rita Rudner -- who also plays Carol -- and her husband, Martin Bergman) there is the lingering question of just why Peter has called them all together at this time. That point is cleared up in the last 15 minutes of the film, and it's quite a surprise when it finally arrives. Despite Branagh's capable direction, Peter's Friends lacks the comedic punch so necessary to take the heat off the occasionally saccharine sentimentalities -- Rudner's script hangs back when it should be rushing forward and there's a very noticeable sense of something missing. Nevertheless, Branagh and company, especially Stephen Fry as the upper-crust semi-twit Peter, have made a worthwhile sort of holiday film that examines friendships both good and bad. Besides, it's about time boy-wonder Branagh made a mistake."
