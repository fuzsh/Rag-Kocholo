Filmed on the Nene Valley Railway, the locomotive is 1943-built Hunslet WD ‘Austerity’ 0-6-0ST No.75006 (masquerading at the time as an LNER J94 Class loco, No.68081) with just a single ‘blood & custard’-liveried Mk.1 coach in tow. There is a good run by shot and an excellent arrival scene filmed at Ferry Meadows station, called ‘Old Marsden’ in the film."
