        "text": "On Feb. 17, The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences announced its nominees for the 1993 Academy Awards. Some 5,450 miles away, in a semidetached house in North London, Emma Thompson, nominated for best actress, was catching a cold.\n\nIn New York a few days later, the National Board of Review gave Emma Thompson her fifth best-actress award since Christmas. By then, she was shuffling around a health farm in Surrey, in \"an old dressing gown and my old Oxfam slippers,\" an infection in her chest, broken out in a rash, resembling, she said, a steamed pudding -- \"sort of white and pocky, positively Elizabethan.\"\n\n\"I think,\" Thompson told a caller, \"I might be a tad allergic to too much of that kind of attention.\"\n\nThat would be too bad; more attention could come tomorrow night. The betting shops of London have Thompson 2-to-1 to take the Oscar for her portrayal of the merry, stable Margaret Schlegel in the Ismail Merchant-James Ivory film of E. M. Forster's \"Howards End,\" overcoming the box-office attraction of Michelle Pfeiffer, the sophistication of Catherine Deneuve and especially, the longstanding appeal of Susan Sarandon.\n\nThough a relative unknown, Thompson, 33, has staked out her screen terrain: Forehead wrinkling, eyebrows wagging above vast blue eyes, she makes good sense seem sexy. With six films out and two set for release this year, she is also an experienced sketch comedian and a novice screenwriter daring to breach Jane Austen's \"Sense and Sensibility.\"\n\nA year ago, when the film of Kazuo Ishiguro's novel \"The Remains of the Day\" was cut from a $26 million celebrity vehicle to an $11.5 million Merchant-Ivory ensemble piece, Thompson won the lead, a low-budget alternative to stars like Meryl Streep, Glenn Close and Anjelica Huston. Tomorrow night, she may join their ranks.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
