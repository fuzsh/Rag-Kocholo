Since the pre-pandemic production completed filming, no f...\n\nDunkirk\n\nAlthough Dunkirk is technically a war film, its tone and style are those of a high-octane thriller. For his most serious-minded film to date, Christopher Nolan has employed all the weapons in his arsenal to craft something that, despite the O...\n\nGingerbread Man, The\n\nCombine the talents of director Robert Altman and actors Kenneth Branagh and Robert Duvall, and you have the apparent recipe for a motion picture worth waiting for.

The lead actor keeps changing, the supporting actors are rarely the same, and the time period varies. Bond is Bond, whether he's played by Sean Connery, Ge...\n\nLove's Labour's Lost\n\nLove's Labour's Lost has always been regarded as one of the most enigmatic of Shakespeare's plays.
