        "text": "Also the scandal with Thomas Quiney and Margaret Wheeler was a huge and scandalous affair and the film not only downplayed the event, but even in the film’s own comparison to Susannah’s accusation trial it was seen as this minor aside but it wasn’t- they were excommunicated and Judith isn’t buried with the family. The entire Quiney/Judith thing was rushed, and just very…..I am not sure I have words, but the sum of it is I wasn’t impressed with Judith in this film. There’s no indication to suggest she reconciled with her father (apart from perhaps her naming her first son Shakespeare), and I think she was the black sheep of the family, and this marriage to Quiney was probably not this grand welcoming into the family that the film portrays.\n\nI appreciated and rather loved that they deal with the doubt I have about plague killing Hamnet, but I had not heard the suicide theory and was shocked by that. This was the only time in the film I felt like I was participating alongside Shakespeare to learn something new. The connections to Ophelia are plain, obviously suggesting Hamlet was an ode to his loss of Hamnet, which is weird if they are going to take the stance that he didn’t learn about the suicide until after he’d written Hamlet, I’m not sure how he could have included it so specifically. So there’s discontinuity about what they are trying to say there and perhaps side stepping that issue was intentional. There’s not any evidence for Hamnet’s death having been suicide aside from the relative low numbers of recorded plague deaths that year. This whole story line was objectionable to me but only because of what I want to believe about Shakespeare’s life, so again, take it as you will. (Pun intended).\n\nStepping back from the history and just examining it, the film was too sad constantly. A very heavy, very constantly sad. There are absolute torrents of minor key piano music and melancholy walks looking off in the distance. Very overdone. Gracious.\n\nThe most well done part of the film in my opinion was the telling off of Thomas of charlecote and saying he didn’t poach deer (but wished he had)! Go team Shakes! I cheered out loud.\n\nI have never liked, nor supported, the idea that Shakespeare was in love with the Earl of Southampton romantically, or sexually. I believe those poems were written with sexual overtones that may or may not indicate a love affair by Shakespeare. I guess it is my English background, but the idea of intentional fallacy is too firmly grounded into my head. Particularly with poetry, as distinct from the personal stories you might find in a play, poems were never intended to be diaries of the author. Poems are separate from the author, and what he wrote in those poems were not intended to be taken literally, and they cannot be assumed to represent the feelings or opinions of the person who wrote them. They are are. Unlike the President of BAFTA, I do not think art and artist are cemented together as one and the same. I separate the two, and for Javier Bardiem’s sake (thinking of No Country for Old Men) I would like to think it’s true that what happens in a piece of art is not always a direct reflection of the artist. Burbage was not actually going mad when he played King Lear. However, all of my personal objections aside, if we are going to follow the narrative that Shakespeare wrote the sonnets as a love declaration to Southampton, the way the film handled it is about how it would have gone down. The quoting of the sonnets by Shakespeare and then Southampton was beautifully done. I never tire of hearing Ian McKellan perform Shakespeare, and Branagh’s quoting of those lines is masterful. I could replay that over and over. As part of this film, however, it seems like a political nod to the LGBTQ movement to include it here more than really fleshing it out as part of Shakespeare’s life. Additionally, I have my own theory about the dark lady sonnets which taints my acceptance of that scene. It did not really suggest a strong friendship there like I’d expected, but more of a fan-hero relationship from Shakespeare. From what I’ve read, their relationship was more sophisticated than perhaps this movie was able to express. Also, Shakespeare wasn’t a small man pretending to have status. Monarchs of nations were entertained at New Place after Shakespeare died (I think it’s the Queen of Spain that Susannah entertained there as the daughter of William Shakespeare). So I was insulted by some of the Earl’s remarks.\n\nWatch it here\n\nI absolutely ugly cried when Hamnet quotes the Tempest.\n\nI was disappointed there wasn’t time or space to establish the strong relationship between Jonson and Shakespeare. From what the movie depicts, you’d be surprised to learn that Jonson wrote the elaborate dedication to Shakespeare in the Folio. The film kind of reduced their whole relationship to a conversation. And Shakespeare catching cold from sleeping outside, I think that’s not accurate, but not impossible. More indulgence of fan fiction and theory. (It is a film).\n\nI did not like how Jonson said he was disgraced by James I. Jonson was a boisterous, loud, confident, even nigh unto arrogant, individual and he would have been nonplussed about being arrested. Plus, by this time (1613), he had gotten back into good graces at court–which you can tell because Jonson was the one who would be chosen just two months after Shakespeare died to entertain and lead the entertainment at Whitehall for the visit of John Rolfe and Pocahontas so he mustn’t have been too tossed aside.\n\nI was delighted by the small details, like Shakespeare planting a garden for Hamnet and using Rosemary because that plant is for remembrance in the early 17th century.\n\nI did not appreciate how they portrayed Susanna as an adulteress who deserved the accusations of John Lane, escaping punishment by his absence. That is not how I think that scene played out in real life. I believe Susanna was falsely accused because she’s a woman and a target for calumny, and I had never before encountered the idea that Susanna and John Hall were unhappily married. Many historians I’ve spoken with indicate the relationship between Hall and Shakespeare was a much better one than the film portrays, with Shakespeare learning about plants from John Hall which was completely omitted in the film despite Shakespeare planting a garden.\n\nHis funeral was short and despite again using rosemary, I don’t think Shakesepare had a coffin. I had a guest on the podcast suggest to me that modern historians don’t think he was buried in a coffin like the movie shows but instead only a shroud.\n\nI like how the film tries to portray only facts about Shakespeare’s life and piece together what we do know at least the strongest bites. I can respect this film, I will always be loyal to Branagh as I can only hope to ever do as much for Shakespeare’s legacy as he continues to do, and ultimately, as a Shakespearean, I enjoyed the trip into Shakespeare’s past the story afforded me, even if it was a fanciful one.\n\nIt is worth seeing, just for Branagh’s performance alone, and will spark good conversation about Shakespeare; specifically about his history. As discussing the life of William Shakespeare is important to me, I welcome All Is True into the arsenal of Shakespeare films we enjoy."
