        "text": "Directed by: Kenneth Branagh\n\nCat Out of the Bag Alert! This review contains some spoilers for this film!\n\nSynopsis: Ten years after graduation, five former college friends gather at the estate of Peter (Stephen Fry) where they reflect on past times and the changes their lives have undergone.\n\nKitty Cameo: One of the former students, Maggie Chester (Emma Thompson), is preparing to leave for the get together. She is petting a short hair ginger tabby cat named Michael.\n\nMaggie tells the cat sitter that she has never left Michael alone overnight before but that she has placed photographs of herself around the house to help him cope. She holds one of these photos in front of Michael’s face but he seems unimpressed.\n\nThe woman assures Maggie she will check in on Michael twice a day and freshen his food and water. Maggie sets Michael on the coffee table and the cat jumps down and disappears, not bothering to reappear or act bereaved as Maggie walks out the door. Still Maggie asks the woman to make sure Michael doesn’t follow her, convinced the cat is going to be devastated without her.\n\nFinal Mewsings: Sometimes we are way more invested in our cats than they are in us.\n\nMany thanks to Mark Murton for letting us know about the cat in this film!\n\nRelevant Links:"
