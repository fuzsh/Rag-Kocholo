Poliça are an American electronic music band from Minneapolis, formed in 2011. The band consists of Channy Leaneagh (vocals, lyrics), Chris Bierden (bass), Drew Christopherson (drums) and Ben Ivascu (drums), with Ryan Olson in a studio context as its producer & composer. Channy Leaneagh was once quoted as saying the band was originally formed to “escape into a different reality”. The band has toured the WORLD since 2011 and released 5 LPS, 2 EPS and a few singles here, there and everywhere.

Latest Release Bio (MADNESS, 2022) Recorded mostly from 2020-2021 in Ryan Olson’s Minneapolis studio with lyrics written and recorded by Channy Leaneagh in her room, Madness is an experimental expansion of the 4 piece family band of Chris Bierden (bass), Drew Christopherson and Ben Ivascu (drums) to include the anthropomorphic production tool “AllOvers(c)”, designed by Olson and fellow producer & sound-artist Seth Rosetter.

This latest release continues within the collaborative enclave in which Poliça resides and includes co-production by Dustin Zahn (“Alive” & “Away”), Alex Ridha and Alex Nutter (“Violence”). Madness is Poliça’s 7th release; preceded by the stand alone single “Rotting” and their 2019 release: When We Stay Alive. The lyrics and artwork for Madness is best summed up by this: “I am here for you all and I am never truly myself here. I am her for you all and I am never truly her”.

In 2022 Chris Bierden, Poliça’s beloved bass player and unmatched harmony vocalist was diagnosed with brain cancer. Chris is a phenomenally strong and brilliant human and we are all continuously inspired by the fight he has waged against the cruel toll of Glioblastoma.

The band continues to be hit by challenge after challenge, yet reliably delivers when there are things to be said. With new music in the works, and some shows booked in August, the future remains uncertain and exciting.
