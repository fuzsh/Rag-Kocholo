        "text": "There are two covers to Poliça’s Shulamith floating around. The first is a pixelated smudge, a silhouette like a blocky comma, elegant in a way but subtly disturbing. The second, in high-resolution, reveals the image for what it is: a woman, back turned, skin bare and hair slick with fresh blood, defiant or defeated. It’s unsettling no matter which you look at first, and intentional or not, it’s eerily reminiscent of what made Give You the Ghost one of 2012’s most unexpectedly complex debuts.\n\nGayngs affiliate Ryan Olson produced that record with neither the kitsch nor alt-R&B mimicry of Relayted, but a sprawling, dense haze. Though Ghost had its own supergroup’s worth of personnel, including two excellent drummers (Twin Cities stalwarts Drew Christopherson and Ben Ivascu) given a soloist’s room to improvise, most of the instrumental parts were buried in the mix, at times sounding almost indistinct. This included vocalist Channy Leaneagh (Roma di Luna), a local star with torchy vocals smeared with reverb and Auto-Tune, sounding like she was singing brushstrokes not words. But when you listened close enough to hear what Leaneagh was actually saying, the songs became unsettlingly surreal, something bluntly masochistic—the closest Ghost came to letting light in was a track called “Leading to Death”, where Olson twists synth lines off-key at the last second and where lines like “I dream of you” end in “oh my strangler.” Close listening may reward itself by definition, but Poliça layered the haze on so thick it demanded it.\n\nWhere their new album Shulamith succeeds most is clearing that haze some while still maintaining the depth. The album doesn’t depart much from Give You the Ghost, but avoids the second-album stumbles of frequent comparisons the xx (sameyness) or the Weeknd (self-indulgence). Mainly, Shulamith is more immediate; Poliça rein in the sprawl of their debut, bringing out higher highs, lower lows, clearer hooks. Even the midtempo cuts, like “Smug” and “Trippin”, simply groove more. At times you can trace the effect down to the track—the threatening Portishead skulk of “Very Cruel” evokes Ghost’s “Violent Games” with a heightened climax, while the rapidfire shudder of a drum solo that introduces and recurs throughout “Matty” is like its equivalent “I See My Mother”, except delivered with a viscerality that Ghost more often buried. Sometimes there’s no comparison at all, as in the bass-heavy, relatively upbeat synthpop of “Chain My Name”, the nocturnal throb and sparkle of “Spilling Lines”—which is as close to a straightforward dance track as Poliça’s ever come—or cavernous single “Tiff”, with an almost snide lyric, a subdued, vaguely menacing Justin Vernon feature, and unflinchingly violent accompanying video clip.\n\nAnother album in, Leaneagh’s vocals sound less like a gimmick and more just what Poliça do, but she too gets more moments of relative clarity, which reveals Shulamith as an equally bleak listen. The album is named for late feminist writer Shulamith Firestone, whom Leaneagh has called her “mentor and muse from the grave.” The last word may be key. Though Firestone is best known for the radical Marxist manifesto The Dialectic of Sex, she published one more book, her only other: the experimental memoir Airless Spaces, about her subsequent hospitalization and retreat from public life. The book, though comparatively obscure, was excerpted in a The New Yorker remembrance last year: “She sometimes recognized on the faces of others joy and ambition and other emotions she could recall having had once, long ago. But her life was ruined, and she had no salvage plan.”\n\nAs such, Poliça’s invocation of Firestone is ambivalent, complicating itself even as it drops pullquote-courting lines. The most illustrative lyric isn’t the likes of “I don’t need a man” (an actual lyric, though thornier in context), but the very first line, from “Chain My Name: “So are we made just to fight all our lives?” Unlike Ghost, which for all its attention to detail had no real throughline, there’s a sense of careful sequencing here: the album begins with a fight and closes with the end of the fight. In Poliça’s telling, relationships are minefields, communication is elusive, and intimacy impossible. Emotions are either heightened, as in the breathless “Spilled Lines”, or, more often, numbed. Loss of identity is a recurring theme, usually in the form of losing one’s name, to marriage or otherwise; tellingly, the two tracks that address named people are either wry puns (“Tiff”, a name or an argument?) or sarcastic diminutives: “Matrimony” becomes “Matty”, a brooding track about a marriage broken from the start: “All this touching in the dark, I don’t think you ever heard me crying/ you’re not the first, you’re not the last.”\n\nPerhaps most tellingly of all, the most explicitly feminist lines come in a resigned pair of tracks at the end of the album: “I Need $”, which starts with a twitchy rhythm section and lyrics spat in a defensive whir—“No one seems to stay, they just leave you cold…love what we need till the need grows tired”—and ends in exhausted synths and a resigned fade-out. The next track has its own slogan (“I don’t like when you tell the boys I’m your girl/ wear me round like a lucky charm with plastic pearls”), but the song surrounding it bleeds halfway through “So Leave”, a formless, disquieting closer that’s like Poliça’s sound unraveled, melodies becoming tatters and instrumental lines at polyrhythmic, distant odds. It’s among the most disturbing aspects of an album that already includes dystopian synths and videos of close-up waterboarding—yet it's the album’s one sprawling jam. Shulamith, in this way, demonstrates again Poliça’s greatest strength: making music that’s both an easy and a torturous listen."
