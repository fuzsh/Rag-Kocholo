        "text": "Charlie Hilton and Patrick Adams started the American indie rock group Blouse in 2010. They were based in Portland, Oregon.\n\nIt seems that the band Blouse no longer exists. Because neither the own band domain (meanwhile a domain parking page) nor the label band profile on the \"Captured Tracks\" website (Captured Tracks) provide information about the band.\n\nThe last album and single were released by Blouse in 2013.\n\n\"A Feeling Like This\" is the sixth track on the album \"Imperium\", released in 2013.\n\nSinger: Charlie Hilton\n\n\"Lay Your Cards Out\" by indietronica American band Poliça from Minneapolis is the seventh track from their debut album „Give You the Ghost“ from 2012.\n\nPoliça was founded in 2011 and is based in Minneapolis. Channy Leaneagh is the lead vocalist of the band.\n\nPoliça has so far put out six studio albums.\n\nIn a 2012 review by the music magazine NME (New Musical Express), the song \"Lay Your Cards out\" was described as follows:\n\n\"A mix of Roy Vedas’ ‘Fragments Of Life’ and Massive Attack’s ‘Safe From Harm’, it uncoils with its own sweet languor. Starting or finishing seems irrelevent;\" (NME. (2012, March 23). Polica – ‘Lay Your Cards Out’ NME. https://www.nme.com/reviews/reviews-polica-12910-317975)\n\nSinger: Channy Leaneagh\n\nAmerican singer-songwriter Santigold is the author of the song \"Disparate Youth.\"\n\nOn February 14, 2012, the song - the lead single from the performer's second studio album „Master of My Make-Believe“ - became accessible in the US.\n\nIn a 2012 article in the online music magazine Billboard, the result of the musical composition of \"Disparate Youth\" is described thus:\n\n\"With a dub reggae half-step tempo, shimmering synth leads, and soothing vocals, “Disparate Youth” sounds unlike previous bass-driving tribal Santigold tracks.\" (Cubarrubia, R. (2013, January 13). Billboard. Billboard. https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/santigold-finds-spirituality-in-disparate-youth-video-502963/)\n\nSinger: Santi White\n\nThe title U.S. Girls may be a bit misleading, because the music project consists of only one singer, Meghan Remy.\n\nMegan Remy is American, however the music project U.S. Girls is a Canadian one.\n\nThe song \"Window Shades\" can be found on the 2015 album \"Half Free.\"\n\nIn a 2015 article, Canadian music publisher Exclaim! described the song \"Window Shades\" in one sentence to the point as follows:\n\n\"The Slim Twig-produced song is a patchwork of sampled disco rhythms (from Gloria Ann Taylor's \"Love Is a Hurting Thing\"), inventive psych textures, soulful vocal lines and swooping disco strings.\" (Hudson, A. (2015, August 26). U.S. Girls “Window Shades” (video) | Exclaim!. https://exclaim.ca/music/article/us_girls-window_shades_video)\n\nSinger: Meghan Remy\n\nAlynda Segarra, an indie singer-songwriter originally from the Bronx in New York, started the band Hurray for the Riff Raff in 2007 in New Orleans after they relocated there in the same year.\n\nHurray for the Riff Raff's musical style is largely Americana.\n\nAlynda Segarra had several of her albums released through indie labels.\n\nLeah Mandel wrote in the music magazine The Fader about the music video for the song \"Hungry Ghost\":\n\n\"\"Hungry Ghost\" is flush with sweeping guitar lines that are both ominous and invigorating;\" (Mandel, L. (2017, January 17). Hurray For The Riff Raff’s Video For “Hungry Ghost” Is A Glowing Ode To DIY Spaces. The FADER. https://www.thefader.com/2017/01/17/hurray-for-the-riff-raff-hungry-ghost-video, para. 1)\n\nSinger: Alynda Segarra\n\nAmerican indie band Mr. Twin Sister from New York City have published three EPs and three LPs.\n\nAndrea Estella is the lead singer of Mr Twin Sister.\n\nIn the Pitchfork News of March 16, 2010 you can read among other things the following about the song:\n\n\"All Around and Away We Go\"'s chugging guitars, airy bass, and chilled-out drumming work beautifully with frontwoman Andrea's smoky vocals.\" (Grisham, T. (2010, March 16). “All Around and Away We Go.” Pitchfork. https://pitchfork.com/news/12158-all-around-and-away-we-go/, para. 1)\n\nSinger: Andrea Estella\n\nThe Brooklyn-based indie electronic music duo The Hundred in the Hands was founded in 2008.\n\nThe single \"Pigeons\" was released on September 13, 2010 via the band's label Warp Records.\n\nThe music video for \"Pigeons\" was created by video directors DANIELS, who have also worked for other bands such as Foster The People, Passion Pit and Manchester Orchestra.\n\nIn the video, a young woman is shown who has looked too deeply into the glass at a party and goes through some unpleasant consequences of being drunk.\n\nIn an August 2010 interview with music magazine Pitchfork, Daniel Scheinert of music video maker duo DANIELS revealed the following:\n\n\"We tried to show as much variety in the drunkenness as we could because alcohol is equal parts hilarious and terrifying.\" (Dombal, R. (2010, August 5). Director’s Cut: The Hundred in the Hands: “Pigeons” Video. Pitchfork. https://pitchfork.com/news/39648-directors-cut-the-hundred-in-the-hands-pigeons-video/, para. 11)\n\nSinger: Eleanore Everdell\n\nIn 2007, the American indie band School of Seven Bells from the Big Apple was founded.\n\nThe song \"Signals\" is from the band's fourth and final album, SVIIB, which was completed posthumously (founding band member Benjamin Curtis died of a serious illness in December 29, 2013) and released in February 2016. For the album were used demos of songs written by Benjamin Curtis before and during his serious illness.\n\nAlejanda Deheza completed the work for the album SVIIB with the help of Justin Meldal-Johnsen.\n\nIn a 2016 interview with The Guardian, she revealed: “I couldn’t have done it myself, and Justin was amazing in that way, treating everything with such love, care and respect,” (Rogers, J. (2018, March 22). School of Seven Bells’ Alejandra Deheza: ‘Ben feels part of everything now.’ The Guardian. https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/feb/21/school-of-seven-bells-sviib-album-release-alejandra-deheza-interview).\n\nIn the intro of the music video for the song, the following now very well-known quote is displayed:\n\n\"Yesterday I was clever\n\nand tried to change the world.\n\nToday I am wise\n\nand try to change myself.\"\n\n-- Rumi\n\nIn the video, the quote is changed a little, but this should not affect the content of the message. The original quote reads:\n\n\"Yesterday I was clever,\n\nso I wanted to change the world.\n\nToday I am wise,\n\nso I am changing myself.\"\n\n-- Rumi\n\nSingers: Alejandra Deheza, Claudia Deheza\n\nMichelle Zauner, a Korean-American artist, is the lead vocalist of the indie band Japanese Breakfast.\n\nIn the music video for the song \"Machinist\", the band's singer is seen taking care of various things in an IT environment with a lot of computer cables.\n\nShe is talking to a computer that is very similar to the HAL 9000 from the movie \"2001: A Space Odyssey\".\n\nIn the end, she can't seem to escape the computer, because she is entangled in a lot of cables.\n\nSinger: Michelle Zauner\n\nSinger-songwriter St. Vincent is from the United States. Three Grammy Awards are among the honors St. Vincent has received.\n\nThe song \"Savior\" alternates between rhythmic talking (kind of rap) and melodic sections, you know from popular songs in a classical sense. The rhythmic talking opens the song until minute 1:31. And from minute 1:32 the melodic chorus of the song is heard for the first time.\n\nOn the American online education platform MasterClass, St. Vincent teaches creativity and songwriting.\n\nOn October 8, 2020, St. Vincent announced her collaboration with MasterClass in an Instagram clip.\n\nIn the MasterClass video course by St. Vincent (16 lessons total), the four lessons for the song \"Savior\" (lessons 5, 6, 7, and 8) are a large and important practice component of the songwriting course.\n\nSinger: Anne Erin Clark\n\nAmerican indie rock group Warpaint was founded in 2004 and is based in Los Angeles.\n\nThe music video I chose from the band's 2010 repertoire consists of two songs, namely: \"Disco//very\" and \"Keep It Healthy\".\n\nIn the first part of the music video (\"Disco//very\"), the band members are shown walking together along a street in sunny weather during the day. Every now and then a young man in a yellow T-shirt appears while skating.\n\nIn the second part (\"Keep It Healthy\"), which shows a skater facility outside at night, mainly young men are shown skating. The band members hang out at the skate park with the skaters and watch them skate.\n\nSingers: Emily Kokal, Theresa Wayman, Jenny Lee Lindberg\n\nDrums: Stella Mozgawa"
