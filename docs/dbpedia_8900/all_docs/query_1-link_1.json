        "text": "Not many bands make fans of both Jay-Z and Justin Vernon of Bon Iver within a year of forming, but Minneapolis-based Poliça counted both as supporters after the release of their debut album Give You the Ghost in early 2012. The variety of names singing their praises is perhaps to be expected, given lead singer **Channy Leaneagh’**s eclectic musical background (as a teenager she studied classical violin and ballet at a fine arts high school while listening to nothing but nineties R&B).\n\n“I was always more into the pop side of things,” says Leaneagh, who fronted the bluegrass outfit Roma di Luna with ex-husband Alexei Casselle before founding Poliça with fellow Minnesotan Ryan Olson (the man behind indie collective Gayngs) in 2011. “I guess I married into the folk scene,” she says.\n\nSinging languid acoustic harmonies in Roma di Luna, Leaneagh’s voice had an intense melancholy that was deeply affecting, but that she found too restrictive. “I always revert to just one emotion that’s very sad,” she says. When Olson invited her to sing with the 25-member Gayngs following the breakup of Roma di Luna (and her marriage) in 2011, she was introduced to the Auto-Tune effect that underscores Give You the Ghost—as well as, ironically, most of the R&B Top 100. And, for the first time she was able manipulate her voice the same way she once controlled notes on a violin.\n\n“When we started Poliça I just turned the Auto-Tune back on again, but I didn’t think it would become this thing,” she says. “Now, looking back, I realize it was a good way for me to forget all the habits I had acquired, and work my voice as an instrument. I have this array of emotions now that I wouldn’t have normally and can sound scary and threatening in ways I wasn’t able to before.”\n\nThe album certainly has moments that are scary and threatening—“Lay Your Cards Out,” for instance, has a sinister edge, which purists might say echoes nineties trip-hop pioneers like Portishead, even if Olson’s soulful beats have a rhythm that falls closer to Morcheeba territory. But it would be naïve to think Laeneagh could completely lose her pervasive vocal fragility, and the end result sounds as pleasingly hypnotic as it is icy cold.\n\nHaving signed with New York independent label Mom + Pop last week, the band will now spend the rest of the year doing three-week increments on the road (Laeneagh doesn’t take much time away from Minneapolis and her three-year-old daughter) and they’re just about to release a remix EP, which features a reworking of album track “Amongster” by previous Band of the Week Exitmusic. In addition, we’re told we can expect a follow-up to Give You the Ghost sometime next year.\n\n“I’m excited about putting my violin through some of my pedals,” she says of the instrument she has abandoned in recent years, but which she hopes will be featured prominently on the next album. “I’m a huge Arthur Russell fan and have been listening to that affected cello sound a lot recently.”\n\nWe expect Jay-Z will love it.\n\nLISTEN: “Amongster (Exitmusic Remix)” by Poliça\n\nRead our last Band of the Week: Purity Ring"
