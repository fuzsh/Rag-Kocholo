Don't worry, the NBHAP staff is helping you with the decision. These are our Top 5 recommendations.\n\nCelebrating 40 Years Of Depeche Mode With A Retrospective Of Their Finest Remixes\n\nBritish synthpop veterans Depeche Mode have been shaping the world of pop and especially the electronic music scene continuously ever since they first plugged in their synthesizers back in late 1980. They inspired multiple generations of musicians and invited many of them to rework their songs over the past four decades. NBHAP head and lifelong Depeche Mode fan Norman dove deep into the remixes of the band and created not one but four tribute mixtapes dedicated to this special art form."
