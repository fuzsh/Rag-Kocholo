        "text": "History of EPPD\n\nThe El Paso Police Department's history relates to and intertwines with more popular \"old-west\" history due to its over 120 year history. EPPD has been in existence since the late 1800’s and was formally “established” in 1884 led by rapidly-rotating city marshals. These marshals (most former Texas Rangers) were chosen for their ability to control the rough persons attracted to the \"untamed\" west. At that time El Paso was on the “edge” in the westward movement and violent.\n\nThe newspaper stories of the late 1800’s were very colorful and often contained considerable exaggeration which makes it hard to tell fact from fiction. This exaggeration was intended for the benefit of the folks back east, those not adventurous enough to “tame the west”. Early in EPPD history, the city marshal was often the “worst of the worse”, due to the necessity of the city marshal having to always display a \"rough\" reputation so they would not be challenged by the “bad guys”. Notable/notorious wild west members were:\n\nDallas Stoudenmire: city marshal, notorious gunfighter for his speed and precision, and allegedly gunned down “four men in five seconds”.\n\nJohn Selman: early El Paso constable, killed John Wesley Hardin, and performed many depraved acts during the Lincoln County War.\n\nThomas Moad: Assistant Marshal, Texas Ranger, helped capture William “Curly Bill” Brocious, and the first El Paso Police officer killed in the line-of-duty.\n\nT.C. Lyons: the first EPPD Chief of Police, not a \"rough\" character instead adopting the beginning of servants and protectors of the public.\n\nThroughout the years there have been notable events that lead to change within the EPPD with some of them listed below:"
