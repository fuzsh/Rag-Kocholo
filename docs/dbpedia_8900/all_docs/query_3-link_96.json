        "text": "The most demanding American audience is clear in its verdict: The Congress are the American band of the future. What is clear is that they are a band as versatile as it is unpredictable. In their shows and albums one can find an a dynamic mix of riveting rock’n’roll, rhythm’n’blues, old school soul, classic country, and searing psychedelia, all wrapped in pop by this band initially formed in Denver and currently based in Richmond, Virginia.\n\nThe band founded by Scott Lane and Jonathan Meadows is completed with Mark Levy in the drums and since 2014 in quartet adding the incredible Chris ‘Bernie’ Speasmaker to the keyboard. Despite their short history, they have proven their worth in countless audiences, some as demanding as Red Rocks, and they grew up touring with first class bands like Lake Street Dive, Tedeschi-Trucks Band or Hard Working Americans. Not to mention their magnificent work in studio with 2 albums, “Whatever You Want” and “The Game”, and both E.P.’s, “The Congress” and “The Loft Tapes.”\n\nThe Congress undoubtedly offer young and fresh music, creating their own vision of American traditional music and renewing it. They exude melancholy and courage in their songs, with a clean sound and catchy melodies, without losing a single chord of their sound so purely American, seeking to attract all those ears and sounds of barley fields and road bars."
