        "text": "The Supersuckers, one of America's most brazen rock and roll bands, will stop off at the Louie Louie live music venue in Estepona tonight (Friday) to perform one of just two dates the band will perform in Spain during their current tour of Europe and North America.\n\nFormed in 1988, the band's music ranges from alternative rock to metal, country and cowpunk, and they have gained a reputation for their outsized personalities and for pledging allegiance to sex, cannabis and Satan.\n\nOriginating from Arizona, the trio began performing punk rock stylised by thrashy guitar riffs and controversial lyrics, cutting their teeth in the clubs and venues of Seattle, where they headed in 1989. The band have since released more than a dozen albums, including The Evil Powers of Rock and Roll and Motherfuckers be Trippin, as well as touring all over America and Europe.\n\nTheir current tour will include Barcelona (10 March), before heading off to Austria, Slovakia, Germany, Canada and America."
