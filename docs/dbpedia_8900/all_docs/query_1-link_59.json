        "text": "Force’s Charity Concert to celebrate 25th anniversary of HKSAR\n\nCombined Band Performance of 'Music Touch'\n\nPolice Band Cadet\n\nThe Hong Kong Police Band consists of both a Silver Band with 70 musicians and a Pipe Band with strength of 24. The Police Band is commanded by the Director of Music, ranked as Superintendent, with the aid of Chief Inspector, Deputy Director of Music and Inspector/Senior Inspector, Bandmaster. They are responsible to the Head of the School of Foundation Training of Police College, ranked as Senior Superintendent, who is also the Exofficio President of the Band. The Band is based in purpose built accommodation, Peter Moor Building, in the School of Foundation Training of the Police College. It consists of changing rooms, practice rooms, offices and storage facilities.\n\nOriginally formed from serving officers in 1951 as the Police Silver Band under the direction of Director of Music, Mr. W. B. Foster MBE, it had only 21 musicians. As the Band grew in strength, it became increasingly more difficult to reconcile police duties with musical rehearsals and engagements and it was decided that the Band would have full time musicians, as they are today.\n\nIn 1954, the Police Pipe Band was formed to function separately or in conjunction with the Silver Band. The MacIntosh tartan, which the pipers wear, was adopted in recognition of a Former Commissioner of Police, Mr. Duncan William MacIntosh, and is worn by kind permission of the clan chief.\n\nThe Band plays an important part in the Force’s public and community relation programme and fulfils over 500 engagements on average each year. These performances include Force parades, Police Night, Officers' Mess functions and concerts. The band also plays for the official events like the Flag-raising Ceremony of the HKSAR Establishment Day, the National Day, Government Official Dinners and the Honours and Awards Presentation Ceremony at the Government House. In addition, the Band participates in various functions organized by the Hong Kong Tourism Board, the Trade Development Council, Government departments and numerous charity organizations.\n\nThe Band has gained an international reputation in countries such as Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Germany, Japan and the United States. Past tours included San Francisco, Zurich, Los Angeles, Manchester and the London 'Hong Kong Festival'.\n\nIn 2010 -2013, the Band was invited to participate the 10th Zurich Police Music Festival and performed with various bands from different continents.

Meanwhile, the Band was also invited to participate the 48th “Musikchau der Nationen” (Music Show of Nations) at Bremen, Germany and the Hong Kong International Military Tattoo in celebrating the 15th Anniversary of the Establishment of HKSAR performed with the prestige Bands from different parts of the world, with tremendous applause. The Band was featured in the ‘Christmas Concert in the Park’, which was produced with TV live broadcasting by the Radio 4 of RTHK, at Central & Western District Promenade on Christmas Eve.\n\nIn 2014, the Band performed for the 170th Anniversary of the Hong Kong Police Force Charity Concert at City Hall with renowned singer, Ms YIP Lai-yee, Frances, and raised 2.2 Million for two beneficiary charity organizations, namely, the Hong Kong Children Cancer Foundation and the Helping Hands.\n\nIn 2015, the band performed at Dongguan and Kunming’s South Asia Expo for the ‘Getting to Know Hong Kong’ Exhibition by the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in Guangdong of the Government of HKSAR, as well as at Zhengzhou and Tianjin for the ‘Style HK Show’ organized by Trade Development Council and the Chinese Manufacturer’s Association of Hong Kong in promoting Hong Kong brands and products.\n\nIn 2016, the Band performed for the ‘Police Concert for Community 2016’at Concert Hall of the Cultural Centre with renowned singers, Mr Leon LAI and Mr Hacken LEE and raised more than 3.8 Million for the Hong Kong Community Chest. Furthermore, the Band was very well complimented for an outreaching programme of school visit, named as “Music Touch” which aimed to engage students in enhancing their interest in music through interactive workshops and performance.\n\nIn 2017, the band was featured at the Hong Kong International Military Tattoo, together with guests from United States, Scotland, Netherlands, Russia, Mongolia and PLA band of China etc., in celebrating the 20th Anniversary of the Establishment of HKSAR with remarkable military music performance. Besides, the band was also invited to represent Hong Kong to perform at various cities of mainland such as Tianjin, Naning, Xiamen, Chongqing, Kunming and Guangzhou, for celebrating the anniversary with huge success and warmest welcome received from local audience.\n\nIn 2018, the band showcased at the Tianjin’s 10th Anniversary of the HKCCC-Tianjin cum the Celebration of the 40th Anniversary of Reform and Opening-up organized by the Tianjin Liaison Unit, Beijing Office of the Government of the HKSAR.\n\nIn 2019, to celebrate the 175th Anniversary of the Hong Kong Police Force, the Hong Kong Police Band organized public performances in different districts. The Police Band performed in Hong Kong Park, Shatin Park, Kwun Tong Promenade and shopping mall nearby, Tai Po Waterfront Park and Tsim Sha Tsui Promenade to share joy, fun and happiness with members of the public.\n\nIn 2023, the Police Band Cadet was formed and it aims to cultivate the youths by encouraging them to establish proper values and self-discipline, in order to promote the spirit of excellence in both morality and art.
