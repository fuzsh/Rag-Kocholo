        "text": "\"It feels like they're all working together and helping each other,\" says Polica's Channy Leaneagh. \"It's good.\"\n\nWith a recent wedding, new baby and an album release on the way, Minneapolis' Polica — Channy Leaneagh (vocals), Chris Bierden (bass), Drew Christopherson (drums), Ben Ivascu (drums) and Ryan Olson (production) — stopped by The Current to perform live in-studio and to chat with host Andrea Swensson of The Local Show.\n\nUnited Crushers, out March 4, is very Minneapolis – at least in its name. Inspired by the Twin Cities tag group, the phrase \"United Crushers\" can be seen on old silos, overpasses and other infrastructure throughout the metro. Like their sophomore album Shulamith, Leaneagh explains she gravitates toward the idea of naming albums after people she admires. \"I drive around and I see that big, ominous 'United Crushers' looking down at all of us and to me it feels like, 'United States of Dreams Crushed,'\" says Leaneagh. \"We're all in this rat race and we're all trying to survive and a lot of the time it feels hopeless, so for me, a lot of these songs build hope.\"\n\nWhile the album art depicts Leaneagh pregnant, the album isn't necessarily about childbearing. \"[United Crushers] should have lots of different meanings and I want people to take it where it takes them,\" says Leaneagh, though being a mother did play a huge part in the writing of the record; motherhood is piece of Leaneagh's identity.\n\nAt the same time, Leaneagh doesn't want to take away from her bandmates' experience. \"The stuff I'm writing about is always the woman's experience: what life is like for a woman, how women and children are like a canary in a coalmine.\" When there is wrong in the world, Leaneagh believes looking through the lens of women and children are telling of its effects. For example, in the music video for \"Wedding,\" Polica look at police brutality through the lens of children.\n\nIt's clear that in its music and in its visuals, the concept behind United Crushers is relevant to all walks of life.\n\nSongs Performed\n\n\"Wedding\"\n\n\"Kind\"\n\n\"Top Coat\"\n\nAll songs off Polica's forthcoming album United Crushers, out March 4, 2016 via Mom + Pop."
