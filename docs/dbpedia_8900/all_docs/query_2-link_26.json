The latter had a guest vocal spot on Poliça's follow-up, Shulamith, which went even further towards perfecting their languid sound, with Channy Leaneagh's vocals drifting hazily over Portishead-like beats. The group will come to Chicago twice, touring behind its new album United Crushers, first for an intimate gig at Schubas in February and then at Thalia Hall in April."
