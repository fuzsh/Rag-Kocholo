        "text": "In February 2014, I spoke to Channy Leaneagh of Poliça as she prepared to play a sold out gig at Hove’s All Saints Church. In this revealing interview, Channy reminisces about her first exposure to fellow Minneapolitan Prince, explains how she creates her music, why Poliça have two drummers and the struggles of being both a performer and a mother, away from her young daughter for six months of the year.\n\nTonight you’re playing in a church. Is this your first time doing that and what appealed to you about playing here rather than a more conventional venue?\n\nChanny: This will be our first church in England, but we did actually play in a church last night in Derry. It was an all-wooden church and it was wonderful. Usually, we’ve never seen the venue until we arrive. We don’t make any decisions about where we play — although, that said, there are some places we choose not to play again, and that’s mainly down to the sound situation. We play very loud and we have effects which don’t suit certain rooms.\n\nWhat other unusual venues have you played?\n\nChanny: In Bristol, we played on a boat and that was really cool. Coming from Minneapolis where it’s usually pretty cold, my favourite places to play are anywhere where it’s warm! I love playing in the southern states, especially Austin, Texas and Athens, Georgia.\n\nYou’re not the only artist from Minneapolis gigging in the UK right now…have you met Prince before?\n\nChanny: I’ve not met him, but I did almost bump into him. When I was in a band called Gayngs he came to one of our shows. He was backstage. I opened the door to the green room, saw him, closed the door and ran away! I’m actually extremely shy, so I don’t like meeting celebrities. I have seen Prince live. In fact, it was my first ever concert. It was in Minneapolis and I was eight! I’d volunteered for the Special Olympics as my family were involved in it and he performed for all the volunteers and participants. So yes, seeing Prince was my first proper concert!\n\nYou’ve played Brighton once before, did you get the chance to have a look around?\n\nChanny: I haven’t seen much of Brighton, but it reminds me a little of San Francisco. In both towns it always seems to be raining! Today, we only arrived this afternoon and we leave tonight, but last time I was here with my daughter we did walk up and down the pier. And I seem to recall I got a haircut here.\n\nYour background is in folk, but your music today is very different. Some say it’s electro pop, one reviewer described it as “the sound of David Lynch smoking a Gauloise in a dimly lit club.” How would you describe your style?\n\nChanny: My passport just says ‘musician’ and that’s all I think of myself as. If you listen to the melodies and my singing style, it’s still pretty rooted in folk music.\n\nLike a lot of artists, you don’t sing like you speak…\n\nChanny: That’s interesting. I’ve never made that connection before.\n\nYour vocals are also very different, not just from your speaking voice, but from other artists Some have compared you with Björk. Is that a fair comparison?\n\nChanny: Gosh! I don’t listen to Björk. The singers I grew up with were people like Patty Griffin, Eva Cassidy, Joni Mitchell and a lot of R&B singers, but I think I sing like I play the violin. I was a violinist for twenty years. I don’t play anymore as I wasn’t that great at it. I also think I sing like a background singer, more in harmony than in melody. Because of that. I think I sing more like an instrument. Often in reviews people complain they can’t hear what I’m singing about, but that’s not the point, that’s not the way I sing. I sing to blend into the music. My lyrics are important, but I don’t want people to be pulled out of the music wondering ‘what is it she’s saying?’ I’m no Bob Dylan!\n\nHow challenging technically is it to translate the studio recordings to the live stage?\n\nChanny: I’m a very decisive person and I need to force myself to spend time in the studio. For me, almost always, the first take is the best take. In fact, many of the recordings that make it onto the records are the first take of my vocals. Generally, I use the same equipment live as I do in the studio and it’s the same for the band. Because of that, we’ve never had the experience that some bands have of working out how to recreate it live. Maybe that’s because our music is very simple, but I prefer to think all the work we do in the studio is us practicing for playing it live.\n\nYou have two drummers, which is quite unusual. How did that come about?\n\nChanny: It is. They don’t play the same thing or the same kits, they play different parts to the same music. Mostly, they play off of each other. One is more like the hip-hop electronic drummer, while the other is the hardcore drummer. It was always the plan to have those two in the band. First of all, they play brilliantly together, something they’ve done so for a long time. Also, you want two drummers to sound like they’re one drummer, not playing louder, just making more complex rhythms.\n\nWith the new record, how conscious were you of doing something different, whilst at the same time retaining the elements that made Give You The Ghost such an acclaimed album?\n\nChanny: Luckily, I started writing and recording demos just a couple of months after Give You The Ghost was released. So there wasn’t a lot of time to really think about the sound of the songs. Looking back, the first album was a demo, it really was an experiment. The vocals were recorded in someone’s bedroom, I was sitting on a couch for most of the songs. This time, we recorded everything in a studio, a couple of different ones in Minneapolis. It took the best part of a year-and-a-half all told, because we were constantly on tour. In terms of how the record sounds, that was just an organic progression. The last thing we worried about was whether people would like it or not. Fortunately, they seem to.\n\nRight from the off with Chain My Name it sounds more ambitious musically. You write with Ryan Olson, tell us about the creative process. Do you write together or do you each have a defined role in creating the music?\n\nChanny: We both have our responsibilities. He writes the beats, I write the lyrics.\n\nWho does what first, or do you work together?\n\nChanny: We’ve never written together, in the sense that we’re in the same room at the same time. Ryan creates the track, he sends it to me and I write the lyrics and singing parts and put vocals over it. It comes to me like a hip hop beat, with no name or explanation. He has just started to tell me how to sing bits, but I don’t like that! On the first record he gave me thirteen tracks and I used twelve, so our hit rate is pretty high. For me, if I don’t feel it, I can’t do it. It’s all about capturing my first instinct. With Chain My Name it took a little longer as I couldn’t get the lyrics straight away. The original has the same melody as it appears on the record, but it’s a lot sadder sounding.\n\nCould you change roles and Ryan write the lyrics to your music?\n\nChanny: No. He certainly might be able to write lyrics, but I don’t want to make beats. I have no interest in trading roles! That said, I love to hear what other people do with our songs. In fact, some of the remix projects for Chain My Name are some of my favourites.\n\nThe album’s title is an homage to Shulamith Firestone, a feminist activist who you’ve called ‘your muse and mentor from the grave.’ How did she inspire you?\n\nChanny: I found out about her almost by accident, after I’d written the record. My brother had one of her books which I started reading. I realised here was a woman who was incredibly wise. She died just a few years ago, but she was around in the 60’s and, to me, her thoughts and ideas seemed so relevant to today’s world. I’m not someone who has studied feminism, in fact, I’m pretty ignorant about it. It just so happened that the songs touched upon some of the things that she had delved deeply into. I guess you could say it was a happy coincidence. She understood the things I’m trying to understand. She was extremely radical, she believed in a lot of things that are only being talked about now. Of course it adds intrigue to the album and I do want people to read about her. Interestingly, Shulamith also means “peace” in Hebrew.\n\nWe’re always interested in new artists…who are you listening to at the moment that you think will make it big?\n\nChanny: I don’t listen to much new music. Right now, I’m listening to Sibylle Baier, a German folk singer. Usually, when I’m on the bus I go to bed.\n\nWhich bands would you pay to see?\n\nChanny: A lot of them would be from the UK. I especially love The xx. We’ve played shows with them. And, when I’m at home, I see a lot of Minneapolis bands, like our support tonight, Marijuana Deathsquads. In fact, they’re Ryan Olson’s other band. It’s his baby, and the band that he plays in. Bringing them on tour is something we’ve been working on for a long time.\n\nWhat can we expect from tonight? Do you have anything special planned?\n\nChanny: Just the show that we do every night. We might mix it up, but mostly we keep it the same because the song order works really well. Being in a church might make it more difficult to hear myself, so I might be a little more irritated onstage. I also hope we don’t have too many people taking pictures with their phones. Last night in Derry, I was so pleased nobody took their phones out. Of course people should have the freedom to do what they want, but why watch the show through your phone!\n\nWhat’s next for Poliça?\n\nChanny: Working on new songs. Before that we finish this tour in London tomorrow night and then we travel to Mexico City for a festival. Then we go home and I get to see my daughter. Right now, I’m living at my parent’s house. I’m away at least half the year. And that’s tough when you have a young daughter. Pelagea’s five now, so when I’m away I leave her a present to open every Monday. That seems to work really well. It’s both out of guilt and to help my parents who are taking care of her. It’s hard because she’s told me she doesn’t want mommy to do this anymore. That said, she’s also told me she wants to be a singer!\n\nFollow Channy at @thisispolica\n\n“To me, shooting live music is all about capturing the personality of the performer and the emotion of their performance.
