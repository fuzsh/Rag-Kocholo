The band framed their February 2018 show in Minneapolis—which featured the single—with the goal “to destroy white supremacy.” In this presentation, I first examine how the song reflects political resistance through texture, timbre, and repetitive structures. I then problematize the song’s message of anti-Trump resistance in relation to the purported goal. Rather than amplifying the voices of people of color, the song’s classical elements and sonic ambiguity risk leaving them out of the conversation.\n\nPromoting Creativity? The Ambiguous Terms of Music Copyright Law\n\nDana DeVlieger, University of Minnesota\n\nThe American copyright system purports to promote creativity by incentivizing creators with exclusive rights to their works for a given period. In recent years, however, several music copyright cases have called into question whether the system serves to promote creativity or to limit it. One problem with copyright law is the absence of clear guidelines stipulating what “creativity,” “originality,” and “substantial similarity” mean in a legal context. This paper suggests that legal professionals, music scholars, and the creators of popular music must come to an understanding of these concepts before any other issues with music copyright law can be addressed."
