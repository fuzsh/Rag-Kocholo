        "text": "This is part of a series of previews showcasing bands you can catch at the 2016 Underground Music Showcase, presented by The Denver Post Community Foundation. Poliça will play the UMS Main Stage on Sunday at 8:30 p.m.\n\nIndie synth-pop band Poliça (pronounced poh-LEE-sah) knew that their newest album, “United Crushers,” wasn’t going to get as much attention as their debut album, “Give You the Ghost,” did.\n\nBut that didn’t stop them from experimenting with new sounds, getting political and, according to producer and all-around band whiz, Ryan Olson, “going to some really weird places.”\n\nCase in point: their latest music video, which features Sesame Street-esque puppets teaching children how to keep themselves safe around officers. Its song, “Wedding,” is ostensibly about police militarization and the war on drugs.\n\nPoliça formed in 2011, after front-woman Channy Leaneagh went through a professional and marital breakup. In it, she saw the opportunity to redefine her style of music. Olson recorded the band’s first batch of songs, featured on 2012’s “Give You The Ghost,” that summer. The project blew up faster than they could have imagined. Soon, critical darling Justin Vernon and hip-hop firebrand Kanye West counted themselves as fans. With Leaneagh’s unique electronically-processed vocals and complex beats delivered by two drummers, Poliça is breaking ground with its own combination of alternative rock, indie and synthpop.\n\nAhead of the band’s show at the UMS, we spoke to Olson about production, politics and where Poliça is headed next. Spoiler alert: They’re not quite sure.\n\nQ. What do you focus on when producing music for the band?\n\nA. A lot of the time I work with drum beats and how the two drummers play off each other. That actually became a thing because before Poliça. I was working with another band named Marijuana Deathsquads, which had up to seven drummers. When Channy (Leaneagh) approached me about making music initially, she came down to one of our shows and was into that sound. She wanted to do something way different than what she had been doing before, which was an Americana indie band. So we used tons of percussion and electronics to put her in a completely different place.\n\nQ. How does “United Crushers” differ from Poliça’s last albums?\n\nA. We rehearsed “United Crushers” as an actual band and wrote a lot of it in a practice space. We actually played it out on the road on the way down to recording. Because of that, it sounds a lot more like how the band sounds live. We’re always trying to not repeat ourselves and try new approaches of the same setup.\n\nQ. What inspired “Wedding”? It’s starkly political.\n\nA. It’s about the talk people have to have with their kids today — that cops are evil. You have to be cautious in the militarized state that we live in, because they will shoot you and get away with it. That was very different from all the messages I was told as a kid. The state of the world right now is just so insane. Now these issues are public and we know a lot more about how often these incidents happen. And it’s crazy how many supporters of institutional racism come out of the woodwork. It’s hard to get anywhere with the conversation we have to have because everyone’s (upset). It’s hard not to be like, “(Expletive) these people.” You have to learn how to talk to these people, too.\n\nQ. What kind of unique power do you think bands have when it comes to making politically conscious art?\n\nA. A lot of people dismiss band stuff in general, but I definitely grew up listening to bands that made me think about issues I hadn’t thought about before. I like bands that are political for sure, because it’s comforting to hear someone you respect musically say something. It’s nice to hear poets tell us things and break it down in ways people can understand. Messages are clearer coming from artists instead of news organizations.\n\nQ. What direction do you see Poliça going in next?\n\nA. We’re currently working with a chamber ensemble in Berlin for a performance in St. Paul, Minn. It’s very different playing with French horn and string sections. That automatically makes some new kind of music for us. We’re just trying to see what happens and play around with the material that didn’t make sense in the context of “United Crushers.” We just don’t want to repeat ourselves.\n\nQ. Will the band continue to be political?\n\nA. There isn’t a plan or a goal. For this last album, Channy wrote it while she was pregnant so she was looking at the world and making observations. We’re going to write about what we’re thinking about."
