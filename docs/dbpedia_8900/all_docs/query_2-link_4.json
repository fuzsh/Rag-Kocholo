        "meta_description": "In 2016 the Minneapolis-based rock band Poliça released its latest album United Crushers. Recorded as more of a live album with musicians and songwriters working more closely together in real time than on the group's previous records, United Crushers has a more organic feel. The songwriting also suggests a willingness to take greater risks both sonically and in the subject matter that vocalist Channy Leaneagh addresses.",
