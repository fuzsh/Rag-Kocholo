        "text": "The Charleston Pipe Band continues to grow and develop, providing service to the City of Charleston, the Charleston Police Department, the Public Safety Community of South Carolina, and the public at large through parades, performances, and instruction in the art of Highland piping and drumming.\n\nThis volunteer organization has a tradition of service to both the Charleston Police Department and the Lowcountry community. Its membership is composed of primarily of civilian volunteers along with active duty police, fire and safety officers. This award-winning organization is well-known locally, regionally, nationally, and internationally for its musicianship and professionalism.\n\nAs a self-funded and self-sustaining organization, all proceeds received by the band via sponsorship, parades, and other performances are allocated toward operating costs such as equipment, uniforms, and competition expenses. The band plays various events predominantly throughout the Southeast. Performances vary from individual pipers, quartets, or full parades.\n\nOUR HISTORY​\n\nThe Charleston Pipe Band has a rich and proud history. It was founded in 1995 as the Charleston Police Pipes and Drums by Police Chief Reuben Greenberg. Though the Charleston Pipe Band now operates as a fully independent 501(c)(3) organization it has not broken with its roots and maintains the Charleston Police Pipes and Drums Honor Band to serve the needs of the public safety community, locally and statewide. ​ The Charleston Pipe Band has traveled throughout much of the Eastern United States Seaboard and Canada performing at parades, festivals, public events, funerals, and Scottish Highland Games.\n\nSandy Jones, an internationally known pipe major, was the band's first pipe major. His skills and experience as co-founder of the North American Academy of Piping and Drumming, a pipe major for the U.S. Air Force and pipe band director of The Citadel led the band to many successes — laying the foundation for what would become an excellent corps of pipers and drummers.\n\nAfter 9 years wearing the MacLean of Duart tartan, the band debuted The City of Charleston Police tartan in 2004, designed by Marjorie Warren specifically for the band. The police tartan is still worn by the band today, and it is widely recognized for its distinctive beauty.\n\nThe 2005 Eastern United States Pipe Band Association competitive season marked the band's highest level of competitive success, winning the title of Overall EUSPBA Champions for both Grade III and Grade V. In 2016, Grade IV earned the title of Season Champions Supreme. The organization has continued to achieve recognition at all levels of competition.​"
