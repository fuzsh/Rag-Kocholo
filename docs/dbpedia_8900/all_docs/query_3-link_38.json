        "text": "Poliça have announced their new album Madness with a new single called “Alive.” The album—the band’s sixth—is due out June 3 via Memphis Industries. Check out “Alive” below.\n\nOf the new song, singer Channy Leaneagh said in a statement, “Bad things happen, the fire goes out; even with the best flammables it stays dark until nothing matters becomes the fire itself.”\n\nMadness was recorded in Minneapolis with an anthropomorphic production tool designed by producer Ryan Olson and the sound-artist Seth Rosetter called “AllOvers(c).”\n\nIn February, Poliça shared “Rotting,” their first new song in two years. It does not appear on Madness. The band’s previous LP was 2020’s When We Stay Alive.\n\nAll products featured on Pitchfork are independently selected by our editors.
