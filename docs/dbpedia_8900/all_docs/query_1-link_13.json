Apart from the band’s multi-million selling records Andy received two Grammys for Best Rock Instrumental Performance and was also voted the number one guitarist for five years by Guitar Player Magazine, and then entered the Guitar Player Hall of Fame.\n\nAndy, Sting, and Stewart Copeland — The Police — were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2003.\n\nAndy Summers Photography & Writing\n\nDespite the demands of his music career Andy has also established himself as a writer and photographer with a number of books, essays and several photography collections. His works include Throb, Light Strings, Desirer Walks the Street, I’ll Be Watching You: Inside the Police, and A Certain Strangeness. Along with these published editions, Andy has held around fifty exhibitions across the world. In 2019 the Pavilion Populaire Montpellier France staged a three-month retrospective A Certain Strangeness which broke all attendance records and was later transferred to the Bonnafanten Museum Maastricht in The Netherlands for a further six months.\n\nAndy then completed this run with his multi-media solo concert at the Metropolitan Museum of Art In New York June 2019.\n\nAndy’s autobiography, One Train Later, voted number one music book in the UK 2006, has been made into a documentary film and was released in the summer of 2015 to glowing reviews. Andy continues to tour, write, photograph and has never stopped being a guitarist.\n\nOne of the greatest guitar players of our generation, fans of Andy Summers know that this prolific artist will continue generating groundbreaking work for years to come.\n\nOn this site, you can explore Andy Summers photography by viewing online image galleries which include pictures from Throb, I’ll Be Watching You, and Desirer Walks the Streets.
