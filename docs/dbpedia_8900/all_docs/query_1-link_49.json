        "text": "Marine musicians perform a wide variety of military and civic events such as ceremonies, parades, festivals, public concerts, educational outreach, and professional sporting events. Music support utilizes a variety of ensemble configurations to include wind ensemble, ceremonial band, brass band, jazz combo, popular music group, brass quintet, jazz ensemble, and bugler.\n\nPublic & Civic Events\n\nWhether a traditional concert hall, outdoor venue or parade, military band performances must be free and open to the public. Marine Bands may perform at fairs, exhibitions and similar venues with admission fees if the performance is incidental to the primary event and no additional fee is charged to hear the band perform. Additional restrictions may apply.\n\nPolicy and Legal Restrictions\n\nU.S. Military participation does not imply endorsement of the event or the organization hosting the event. The requested information is required to evaluate the event. Please complete all sections.\n\nArmed Forces musical units are organized for ceremonial and traditional purposes and to support recruiting activities. However, they may be authorized to provide certain specified presentations, such as patriotic ceremonies for public programs. Armed Forces musical organizations are not permitted to provide entertainment, background, dinner, dance or other social music at public or private events in competition with the customary or regular employment of local civilian musicians. Limited resources permit only one band and/or choir to perform at an event, and the Military Services reserve the right to cancel support to requesters who have scheduled more than one such military unit.\n\nDepartment of Defense (DoD) policies require that Armed Forces participation in public events will be provided at no additional cost to the Government, which means un-programmed costs incurred solely because of participation in or support of an unplanned activity. For example, additional costs to the Government include unplanned travel and transportation, meals and lodging for military personnel away from Government mess, civilian per diem, and overtime pay. Unsolicited contributions of money, personal property, or services (e.g., gifts in kind for lodging, meals, transportation) may be accepted for the benefit of military musical units for events that align with the DoD's mission. All costs are binding after a unit, personnel, or exhibit has arrived at an event site, even though weather conditions or other unforeseen circumstances force the event to be cancelled.\n\nRequests should be submitted to the appropriate Military Service not less than 30 days in advance of a scheduled program. Final determination will occur no earlier than 90 days in advance. Please realize that all Armed Forces units have specific military missions and training requirements. Participation in public programs will only be authorized when such support is in the best interests of the DoD and the Military Services and does not interfere with mission or training programs. In all cases, operational commitments must take priority and can cause previously scheduled appearances to be cancelled.\n\nPerformance Request Process\n\nStart your request for musical support by choosing the appropriate request form below. Once received, we will determine whether we can support your request. If your request is approved, a representative from the band will reach out to you for coordination. If your request is denied, you/your organization will receive an email explaining why your request is not eligible to receive support.\n\nMilitary Request Form\n\nCivilian Request Form\n\nThe 2nd Marine Division Band - \"The Division's Own\" - was formed from elements of the 2nd, 6th, and 8th Marine Regiment Bands. They assembled for the first time in Wellington, New Zealand during World War II. Members of this band fought on Tarawa, Tinian, Wake Island, Guadalcanal, and Saipan.\n\nSince World War II, the 2nd Marine Division Band has continued its wartime missions, participating in both the Korean and Vietnam Wars as military police, litter bearers, and security forces. More recently, the band deployed in support of OPERATION IRAQI FREEDOM, serving as a security platoon in the Al Anbar Province, Al Assad, and Fallujah. Members of the band have also deployed in support of OPERATION ENDURING FREEDOM, serving the Division in various capacities in Helmand Province, Afghanistan."
