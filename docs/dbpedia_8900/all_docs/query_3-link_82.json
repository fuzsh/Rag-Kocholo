        "text": "In our mental framework, we mostly associate all country music with the United States, as their origins are part of USA’s history itself. But above all, country music is all about shared roots and folklore, from generation to generation, being the result of the primary Anglosaxon influence, as in Ireland, Scotland and England, for example.\n\nThe country music DNA is containing a big Mexican influence, and some people claim that Mexican traditional music and country music are somehow related. For that matter, given the Spanish origin of Mexico’s music, the circle is closed.\n\nIn any case, all of our Spanish country music bands and singers deserve to be heard and supported. In almost all these country bands they write songs in English and Spanish. As shown with American country groups, Spanish ones have their own style, with very significant differences between bands.\n\nToday we will review some country music, americana and western rock bands, all of them based in Spain. Our list could be much more complete, showing our endless national talent.\n\nAllwoods: the latest New Country\n\nThis Catalan band with a clear American rooted sound started in 2017 and just in one year signed with the North American record labels Peer Music and TWH Records. Their debut, ‘Birds’, had 16 songs: 8 of them were composed and own by themselves and the rest were other 8 versions.\n\nTheir first work was acclaimed by critics and audience alike, being nominated to the HALL OF FAME 2018 awards in the Spanish Americana Music Artist category, between other international nominations. As well, they had been awarded as the best ‘Made in Spain Country Music’ record, voted by ‘Carretera y Country Radio’ listeners. Already the band made a successful international tour around Europe.\n\nThe band members had played before in other blues and rock bands, being both genres present into country music, so ‘the boys from Terrassa’ were largely experienced before this new project. Check here some tracks of their last album, like ‘Wagon Wheel’, ‘Bobby Holloway’ or ‘Stories of a Lonely Tree’.\n\nThe Wild Horses, an «Americana Music» reference band in Madrid.\n\nThis band born in 2013 plays both acoustic and electric songs, with a very personal American sound, mixing their own creations with tributes to other artists that have been a big influence.\n\nAll The Wild Horses gigs are defined for their festive mood, highlighting a strong guitar presence and a painstaking vocal harmony.\n\nCountry, Country Rock, Line Dance, Tex-Mex and a powerful American Rock style, this is the range shown by the band from Madrid. Check some of their amazing songs: ‘Simple Country Boy’, ‘Wagon Wheel by The Wild Horses & Friends’ or ‘Lay Down Sally’.\n\nLos Widow Makers: two decades of passion for American music\n\nThis other Madrid-based group is another founding band in Spain. Were chosen for their two first records ‘Capriola’ and ‘The King of Nothing’ as the Americana Music Best Band and nominee as well for ‘Los Diablos’, their third album.\n\nThey have been the supporting band for international artists such as Slim Jim Phantom, Wayne Hancock and Booker T, touring also as a heading band through Spain, France, Belgium and Italy.\n\nLos Widow Makers, with a great live show, play a blend of soul and blues music, with a strong country, rock and pop influence, and a few shots of swing and punk rock. Strongly interested in the American tradition, they won’t hesitate with the addition of popular and contemporary musical elements.\n\nTo make an idea on how good they sound, listen to some of their tracks: ‘Six Feet Under’, ‘I Don’t Wanna’, or ‘Rolling Down The Highway’.\n\n‘Furia Trinidad’: western rock sound\n\nThis band from Cádiz (Andalusia) played their first gigs back in 2013, with a personal style and music that could be heard in a Tarantino’s movie. Some would describe this group as ‘dry and bordering’ or ‘this band is like being sunbathed by a Texan sun in middle of a desert’. Libération, an influencial French newspaper, told about them that are ‘on the top’ and their live show is incredible.\n\nThe band’s name has some clues about their personal style: ‘Furia’ means fury, as they sound in most of their songs. ‘Trinidad’ is a Californian-Mexican border town, and this combination makes go crazy to their members. Their songs will drag your imagination to an unique scenario: the severe sun at midday, the warm sand under your feet, the rattlesnakes and maybe the sound of a galloping wild horse… look behind you!\n\nThe musical style of Furia Trinidad, defined by many, it’s just raw western rock. According to themselves, they are also inspired in mariachi bands and psychedelic groups. Some of their most renowned tracks are ‘Money’ and ‘She and the Sunshine’.\n\nGuadalupe Plata: country-rock howlings\n\nThis band from Úbeda, Jaén (Andalusia) also has a very personal style, with an effective blues-rock mixed with country rock music. The output is a satisfying yet wild ‘road and tavern’ breakthrough sound.\n\nBeyond our borders have been reviewed, for example, by the specialized British musical press. Mojo Magazine wrote about Guadalupe Plata that the band is ‘excellent and instantly recognizable’.\n\n‘Qué he sacado con quererte (What I Got Loving You)’, ‘Serpientes negras (Black Snakes)’ or ‘Go Down Moses’ are enough examples to have an idea of the natural talent of this great trio from southern Spain.\n\nWe could mention more Spanish country bands and singers, as talented as the ones we talked about. But it’s your turn to do some research time, and let us know in the comment box which are your preferred Spanish country artists."
