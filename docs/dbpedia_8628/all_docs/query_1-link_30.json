        "text": "Raymond initiated the formation of Teatro Público de Cleveland, CPT’s resident Latinx/a/o theatre company, Masrah Cleveland Al-Arabi , a group dedicated to creating and performing theatre from Arabic-speaking communities, and Station Hope, a community arts festival exploring contemporary issues of social justice. Raymond founded the Student Theatre Enrichment Program (STEP), a job-training theatre program for teens, and co-created the Y-Haven Theatre Project with James Levin, which engages formerly homeless men in writing and performing theatre.\n\nRaymond was the first recipient of the Cleveland Arts Prize in the discipline of theatre. He is a two-time winner of the Creative Workforce Fellowship and a recipient of the Ohio Arts Council Fellowship. He is an alumnus of the National Theatre Artist Residency Program (Pew Charitable\n\nTrust and TCG).\n\nRaymond has received the Cleveland’s Transgender Day of Remembrance Cisgender Ally Award and Equality Ohio’s Ally Award. In 2018, he was honored with the Cleveland Foundation’s Homer C. Wadsworth Award and in 2017, his administrative leadership was recognized with The Governor’s Award for the Arts in Ohio. In 2020 he was awarded the Father Frascati Neighborhood Champion Award by Northwest Neighborhoods.\n\nRaymond was the president of the board of directors for the National New Play Network from 2018-2020. He has recently returned to the NNPN board and is cochairing their Strategic Plan. This year marks the completion of Raymond’s maximum four terms of service on the board of Theatre Communications Group, the national service organization for professional theatres and the publisher of American Theatre magazine. Raymond also serves on the governing boards of Gordon Square Arts District Cleveland Improvement Corporation and North American Cultural Laboratory, and the Community Advisory Board for Ideastream. This is Raymond Bobgan’s 18th season leading Cleveland Public Theatre as executive artistic director\n\nDiwe Augustin-Glave is an actor, poet, educator, and life-long learner. They joined Cleveland Public Theater’s full-time staff in September of 2022 after being attracted to their investment in antiracism and developing new work. Diwe received their BA in Theater from Oberlin College with a concentration in performing and a minor in Africana Studies in June of 2022. They are a Cleveland native and consider Cleveland Heights to be their home and heart. Diwe’s experience as a teacher began in high school as a Beaumont student and alum of The Aspire Program at Hathaway Brown where they served as a Junior Teacher for three summers and spent their fourth summer as an 8th grade social studies teacher. Their self-directed curriculum focused on U.S. History through a Black Feminist lens. In addition, they led a Performance 101 workshop that was offered to students from grades 6-8 which culminated in two devised skits that centered on themes of desirability, cancel culture, and accountability. Diwe is a graduate of the Trinity/La MaMa Performing Arts Program, here they were immersed in the arts and culture of the city by seeing shows every night, producing their own work, and taking master classes with professionals from a wide variety of artistic fields. While in NY they interned with Black Revolutionary Theater Workshop under Heather Harvey. As a Teaching Artist and Site Coordinator with CPT’s CMHA CAN program, Diwe intends to bring compassion, flexibility, and fun to the forefront of theater education.\n\nPaige is a director, AEA stage manager, and theatre educator from Flint, Michigan. She holds a BFA in Theatre, with a focus in Directing from Michigan State University. With over 12 years of experience as a competitive gymnast, it’s no surprise she found her niche in physical theatre, and is passionate about the physical, mental, and emotional accessibility and safety it offers in a theatrical process. During the pandemic, she began training as an intimacy choreographer through TIE (Theatrical Intimacy Education). Paige is also occasionally a playwright. In 2021 her play Tag received a virtual development process with Drafted; A New Play Workshop. She’s so glad to be with CPT and excited to be working with this wonderful community of artists.
