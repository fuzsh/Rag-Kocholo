There are a limited number of handicapped accessible spots located in front of the theater and metered street parking located around the theater. Additional handicap spots are located in the Civic Square Parking Deck. Please allow extra time for parking when attending a show. Visit the NBPA parking locator. Parking through the New Brunswick Parking Authority can be reserved in advance using Parkmobile here.\n\nIn the case of inclement weather, refunds will be awarded only if the show is cancelled. If the performance is rescheduled, then the original tickets issued are valid for the new date. In the event that a show is cancelled, we will make every effort to inform all ticketed customers via phone and email as soon as we can. If a show is cancelled, a refund will be issued to the original payment type used to purchase the ticket. Cash payments will be refunded by State Theatre check to the buyer on record.\n\nIf a show has not been cancelled and you purchased optional Ticket Insurance when you ordered your tickets, you may have more options. Ticket Insurance claims are handled directly through the insurance agency, please do not contact STNJ Guest Services for claims. Visit STNJ.org/protection for details."
