This was very funny\n\nDon't see it if You want something more serious and don't like crude humour\n\nCliched, Confusing, Disappointing\n\nSee it if black adder style comedy. Mel Giedroyc was great\n\nDon't see it if difficult to follow, lacking comedic timing and just not very funny overall!\n\nBoring, Rubbish, Too Long\n\nSee it if U like the actors\n\nDon't see it if awful and I didn’t understand any of it You like theatre\n\nDelightful, Funny, Great Singing\n\nSee it if you like a little fun retelling of the attempt to steal the Crown Jewels.

Fun show but at times was slow with audience interaction.\n\nDon't see it if You want to see something meaningful.

But those performances are not in service to any wider purpose, because there isn’t one here.”\n\nRead more\n\n“Murray’s King Charles is a tyrant and a sleazeball, pointing to women in the audience and ordering his footmen to bring them to his room. Other characters seem as priapically preoccupied, but Nye’s sexed-up script brings a welter of beached innuendoes.”\n\nRead more\n\n\"That it works as well as it does at times is no mean feat, but, lacking a strong raison d’etre besides giving us a nibble of history and a few baubles of mirth, this interloper’s reign looks set to be short-lived and immemorable.\"\n\nRead more\n\n“What a mess. The stately music of Purcell pours from speakers before the curtain rises but decorum goes out of the window once Simon Nye’s woeful attempt at rekindling the spirit of Restoration comedy starts.”\n\nRead more\n\n“It feels closer to panto or sitcom. However the pacing is far too sluggish, and the overreliance on knob gags gets tiresome. It’s also hard to figure out the tone: It’s generally quite cartoonish, but with sudden dashes of sex and violence.”\n\nRead more\n\n“ ‘The Crown Jewels’ is a frustrating show to watch. In theory, they have all the elements needed to create a winning piece of theatre...It’s worth it if only to see such stunning talent in surprising roles. ‘The Crown Jewels’ might not have successfully stolen my heart but it isn’t the worst crime to hit a West End stage in recent years.”\n\nRead more\n\n“Nye is attempting, it seems, to write a Restoration comedy, its language and humour accurate to the time. But Foley directs it like a contemporary farce. The two approaches are worlds apart, and the humour gets lost in the middle.”\n\nRead more\n\n“Comedy is hard to get right and it’s also wildly subjective... I always try to lean into a show, find the humour and gloss over the jokes that fall flat. But such generosity is hard to extend to a production that only succeeds when the story is left behind and the stage turns into a platform for proven West End performers to strut their stuff.”\n\nRead more"
