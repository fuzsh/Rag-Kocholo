        "text": "Ruggedly handsome, slack-jawed actor Earl Holliman was born on September 11, 1928, in northeastern Louisiana amid meager surroundings. His father, a farmer named William Frost, died several months before Earl's birth, forcing his poverty-stricken mother to give up seven of her ten children. He was adopted as a baby by an oil-field worker named Henry Earl Holliman and his waitress wife Velma, growing up in the Louisiana and Arkansas areas. Though Henry died when Earl was 13, the adoptive parents were a source of happiness and inspiration growing up.\n\nEntertaining became an early passion after ushering at a local movie house and Earl at one point was a magician's assistant as a young teen. Hoping to discovered, Earl ran away from home hoping to be discovered in Hollywood. Following that aborted attempt, the teenager returned to Louisiana and immediately enlisted in the United States Navy during World War II by lying about his age (16). Assigned to a Navy communications school in Los Angeles, this re-stimulated his passion for acting, spending much of his free time at the Hollywood Canteen.\n\nDischarged from the Navy a year after enlisting when his true age was discovered, he returned home to work in menial jobs and complete his high school education. Reenlisting in the Navy, he was cast as the lead in several Norfolk (Virginia) Navy Theatre productions. This led to a trek back to Hollywood after his (this time) honorable discharge[ where he attended USC and studied acting at UCLA Drama School and the Pasadena Playhouse, working as a Blue Cross file clerk and airplane builder at North American Aviation.\n\nEarl started off apprenticing in uncredited film bits in several films --Durch die gelbe Hölle (1953) and Starr vor Angst (1953). He soon rose in rank and gained clout playing jaunty young rookies and tenderfeet and young stud types in rugged westerns, war drama and rollicking comedy. His swaggering characters in such films as Tennessee Champ (1954), Die gebrochene Lanze (1954), Die Brücken von Toko-Ri (1954), Geheimring 99 (1955), Gegen alle Gewalten (1955), Alarm im Weltall (1956), Horizont in Flammen (1956) and Giganten (1956) ranged from dim and good-natured to impulsive and threatening.\n\nHolliman won a Golden Globe for his support performance as a girl-crazy brother in Der Regenmacher (1956), holding his own against stars Burt Lancaster and Katharine Hepburn. Without progressing to star roles, he continued to provide durable late 50's support to big name stars including Zwei rechnen ab (1957) starring Lancaster and Kirk Douglas; Fluch der Gewalt (1957) starring Joel McCrea and Barbara Stanwyck; Geh nicht zu nah ans Wasser (1957) starring Glenn Ford; Hitzewelle (1958) starring Shirley Booth, Anthony Quinn and Shirley MacLaine; Die Falle von Tula (1959) starring Richard Widmark; and Der letzte Zug von Gun Hill (1959) again with Douglas and Quinn.\n\nAlthough film offers began drying up in the 1960s, Earl was enjoyable boorish in his dealing with innocent alien Jerry Lewis in the wacky comedy Besuch auf einem kleinen Planeten (1960); had a touching final scene in a park with Geraldine Page in the somber Tennessee Williams period piece Sommer und Rauch (1961); played one of John Wayne's younger punch-drunk brothers in the freewheeling western Die vier Söhne der Katie Elder (1965); portrayed a salesman on trial for murdering his wife in Mit dem Tod im Bunde (1967); and was a platoon sergeant in command in Schlacht um Anzio (1968).\n\nHolliman found a highly accepting medium in TV with a lead series role as reformed gunslinger \"Sundance\" (not The Sundance Kid) in the short-lived western series Hotel de Paree (1959), plus showed off a virile stance in episodes of \"The Twilight Zone,\" \"Bus Stop,\" \"Checkmate,\" \"Bonanza,\" \"Dr. Kildare,\" \"The Fugitive,\" \"Marcus Welby, M.D.,\" \"It Takes a Thief,\" \"Alias Smith and Jones,\" \"Gunsmoke,\" \"Medical Center,\" \"Ironside,\" \"The Magical World of Disney\" and \"The F.B.I.\" He also appeared in a number of TV movies that became popular in the late 1960's. He played hard-ass, redneck types in the action adventure Das Gold der Madonna (1969) and in the military drama Tribes (1970), but did a complete turnaround as a good guy psychologist trying to help get a kid hooker off the streets in Alexander: The Other Side of Dawn (1977). This all culminated in his most popular series program, a four-year stint as the macho partner to sexy Angie Dickinson in Make-Up und Pistolen (1974), a role that helped make him a household name.\n\nOn the side, the never-married Holliman found a brief, yet successful, career in the late 1950's as a singer and copped a record deal with Capitol Records at one point, while scoring as Curly in a tour of the musical \"Oklahoma\" in 1963. Other non-musical roles included \"Sunday in New York,\" \"The Country Girl,\" \"The Tender Trap,\" \"Camino Real,\" \"A Streetcar Named Desire\" (as Mitch) and \"A Chorus Line\" (as Zach). He also owned the Fiesta Dinner Playhouse for a decade in the late 1970's and performed there, between film and TV assignments, in such shows as \"Mister Roberts,\" \"Arsenic and Old Lace\" and \"Same Time, Next Year.\"\n\nAn intermittent presence in later years, Earl was seen primarily on TV including the acclaimed miniseries Die Dornenvögel (1983), as well as the TV programs \"Empty Nest,\" \"In the Heat of the Night,\" \"Murder, She Wrote\" and \"Caroline in the City.\" regular roles on three drama series: the urban drama P.S.I. Luv U (1991); the comedy series Delta (1992) (Golden Globe nomination) which starred Delta Burke in a short-lived follow-up to her \"Designing Women\" exit; and the sci-fi action adventure Night Man (1997).\n\nA conservative political activist and animal rescuer on the side, Earl retired from the screen into the millennium -- shortly after appearing in the movies Bad City Blues (1999) and Der Tod lauert nebenan (2000).\n\nMurray Hamilton was one of those character actors whose face would be familiar to most movie buffs at an instant, yet his name may not. That's a shame, because Hamilton was one of the most versatile and prolific of performers who was never anything less than completely convincing in any role he took on, from priests to gangsters, soldiers to politicians, ordinary men to aliens. His characters would rarely fail to evoke emotion, whether that be sympathy or dislike. He particularly excelled at hard-edged, street-wise tough guys on either side of the law. His own dictum was to be always \"true to the part as it is written\".\n\nBorn and schooled in Washington, North Carolina, he had originally studied graphic design but had an early yearning for the acting profession. Barely out of his teens, he took a bus to Los Angeles, eventually arriving in Hollywood with just $50 to his name. He gained a foothold at Warner Brothers (his favorite studio) through the back door, as a messenger boy, earning $22 a week. He soon found work as an extra in films, but by 1945, returned to New York making his debut on Broadway as \"a mill hand\" in 'Strange Fruit', directed by 'Jose Ferrer (I)'.\n\nHis breakthrough came three years later, when he appeared with Henry Fonda in the long-running play 'Mister Roberts' (1948-51), first playing the role of a shore patrol officer, later taking over from David Wayne in the key part of Ensign Pulver. Over the years, Murray became quite comfortable with playing more comedic roles on stage and made good impressions as the over-zealous director Dion Kapakos in 'Critic's Choice' (1960-61), and as Otis Clifton in his Tony Award-nominated performance in 'Absence of a Cello' (1964-65), co-starring with Fred Clark and Charles Grodin. Of his enactment as Robert E. Lee Prewitt in the short-lived military drama 'Stockade' (1954), critic Brooks Atkinson remarked: \"Modest of manner, pleasant of voice, he has a steel-like spirit that brings Prewitt honestly to life\" (New York Times, September 17, 1986).\n\nMurray began in films properly as a credited screen actor from 1951, alternating with guest starring roles on television (by the end of his life he had appeared in more than 100 TV shows). His expressive face and gravelly voice became an adaptable combination for playing surly gangsters (Perry Mason (1957)), authority figures with integrity (James Stewart's ill-fated colleague in Geheimagent des FBI (1959)), or without (pompous mayor Larry Vaughn in Der weiße Hai (1975)). He was particularly good as Irving Blanchard in the comedy Blindgänger der Kompanie (1958), giving an excellent drunk impersonation; as obtuse barkeeper Al Paquette in Anatomie eines Mordes (1959), the key witness to the crime who keeps mum out of misguided loyalty; cocky Kentuckian millionaire Findley who thinks he can take Fast Eddie in Haie der Großstadt (1961); and Anne Bancroft's complacent, cuckolded husband, Mr. Robinson, in Die Reifeprüfung (1967), a role for which Marlon Brando was at one time considered. Of Murray's performance in the iconic 1960s film, Bosley Crowther posited that \"Murray Hamilton is piercing ... a seemingly self-indulgent type who is sharply revealed as bewildered and wounded in one fine, funny scene\" (New York Times, December 22, 1967).\n\nOn the small screen, he was memorable as \"Mr. Death\" in the 'One for the Angels' episode of Rod Serling's Unwahrscheinliche Geschichten (1959), who is seemingly sweet-talked by salesman Lew Bookman (Ed Wynn) to remain on earth just long enough to make his big \"pitch to the angels\". As Lewis Dunn in the episode 'The Condemned' of Invasion von der Wega (1967), he was a very different type of visitor to earth, a sinister alien. In addition to numerous portrayals of harassed or cynical cops, he is also remembered for his recurring TV role, Captain Rutherford T. Grant, in B.J. und der Bär (1978).\n\nUnlike other busy actors, Hamilton was not a part of the established Hollywood set, preferring to spend his life in his native North Carolina, and in Manhattan. He counted George C. Scott, Jason Robards, and Walter Matthau, among his close friends.\n\nWhen the actor was suffering from the effects of cancer and found film roles harder to come by, Scott helped out by getting him a part in the made-for-television movie The Last Days of Patton (1986).\n\nMurray Hamilton died, aged 63, in September 1986 in his native North Carolina.\n\nOscar-winning character actor Martin Landau was born on June 20, 1928, in Brooklyn, New York. At age 17, he was hired by the New York Daily News to work in the promotions department before he became a staff cartoonist and illustrator. In his five years on the paper, he served as the illustrator for Billy Rose's \"Pitching Horseshoes\" column. He also worked for cartoonist Gus Edson on \"The Gumps\" comic strip. Landau's major ambition was to act and, in 1951, he made his stage debut in \"Detective Story\" at the Peaks Island Playhouse in Peaks Island, Maine. He made his off-Broadway debut that year in \"First Love\".\n\nLandau was one of 2,000 applicants who auditioned for Lee Strasberg's Actors Studio in 1955; only he and Steve McQueen were accepted. Landau was a friend of James Dean and McQueen, in a conversation with Landau, mentioned that he knew Dean and had met Landau. When Landau asked where they had met, McQueen informed him he had seen Landau riding on the back of Dean's motorcycle into the New York City garage where he worked as a mechanic.\n\nLandau acted during the mid-1950s in the television anthologies Playhouse 90 (1956), Studio One (1948), The Philco Television Playhouse (1948), Kraft Television Theatre (1947), Goodyear Television Playhouse (1951), and Omnibus (1952). He began making a name for himself after replacing star Franchot Tone in the 1956 off-Broadway revival of Anton Chekhov's \"Uncle Vanya,\" a famous production that helped put off-Broadway on the New York theatrical map.\n\nIn 1957, he made a well-received Broadway debut in the play \"Middle of the Night.\" As part of the touring company with star Edward G. Robinson, he made it to the West Coast. He made his movie debut in Mit Blut geschrieben (1959), but scored on film as the heavy in Alfred Hitchcock's classic thriller Der unsichtbare Dritte (1959), in which he was shot on top of Mount Rushmore while sadistically stepping on the fingers of Cary Grant, who was holding on for dear life to the cliff face. He also appeared in the blockbuster Cleopatra (1963), the most expensive film ever made up to that time, which nearly scuttled 20th Century-Fox and engendered one of the great public scandals, the Elizabeth Taylor-Richard Burton love affair that overshadowed the film itself. Despite the difficulties with the film, Landau's memorable portrayal in the key role of Rufio was highly favored by the audience and instantly catapulted his popularity.\n\nIn 1963, Landau played memorable roles in two episodes of the science-fiction anthology series The Outer Limits (1963), The Bellero Shield (1964), and The Man Who Was Never Born (1963). He was Gene Roddenberry's first choice to play Mr. Spock on Raumschiff Enterprise (1966), but the role went to Leonard Nimoy, who later replaced Landau on Kobra, übernehmen Sie (1966), the show that really made Landau famous. Landau originally was not meant to be a regular on the series, which co-starred his wife Barbara Bain, whom he had married in 1957. His character, Rollin Hand, was supposed to make occasional, recurring appearances, on Kobra, übernehmen Sie (1966), but when the producers had problems with star Steven Hill, Landau was used to take up the slack. Landau's characterization was so well-received and so popular with the audience, he was made a regular. Landau received Emmy nominations as Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series for each of the three seasons he appeared. In 1968, he won the Golden Globe award as Best Male TV Star.\n\nEventually, he quit the series in 1969 after a salary dispute when the new star, Peter Graves, was given a contract that paid him more than Landau, whose own contract stated he would have parity with any other actor on the show who made more than he did. The producers refused to budge and he and Bain, who had become the first actress in the history of television to be awarded three consecutive Emmy Awards (1967-69) while on the show, left the series, ostensibly to pursue careers in the movies. The move actually held back their careers, and Kobra, übernehmen Sie (1966) went on for another four years with other actors.\n\nLandau appeared in support of Sidney Poitier in Zehn Stunden Zeit für Virgil Tibbs (1970), the less-successful sequel to the Oscar-winning In der Hitze der Nacht (1967), but it did not generate more work of a similar caliber. He starred in the television movie Willkommen daheim, Johnny Bristol (1972) on CBS, playing a prisoner of war returning to the United States from Vietnam. The following year, he shot a pilot for NBC for a proposed show, \"Savage.\" Though it was directed by emerging wunderkind Steven Spielberg, NBC did not pick up the show. Needing work, Landau and Bain moved to England to play the leading roles in the syndicated science-fiction series Mondbasis Alpha 1 (1975).\n\nLandau's and Bain's careers stalled after Mondbasis Alpha 1 (1975) went out of production, and they were reduced to taking parts in the television movie The Harlem Globetrotters on Gilligan's Island (1981). It was the nadir of both their careers, and Bain's acting days and their marriage were soon over. Landau, one of the most talented character actors in Hollywood, and one not without recognition, had bottomed out career-wise. In 1983, he was stuck in low-budget sci-fi and horror movies such as The Being (1981), a role far beneath his talent.\n\nHis career renaissance got off to a slow start with a recurring role in the NBC sitcom Buffalo Bill (1983), starring Dabney Coleman. On Broadway, he took over the title role in the revival of \"Dracula\" and went on the road with the national touring company. Finally, his career renaissance began to gather momentum when Francis Ford Coppola cast him in a critical supporting role in his Tucker - Ein Mann und sein Traum (1988), for which Landau was nominated for an Academy Award as Best Supporting Actor. He won his second Golden Globe for the role. The next year, he received his second consecutive Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination for his superb turn as the adulterous husband in Woody Allen's Verbrechen und andere Kleinigkeiten (1989). He followed this up by playing famed Nazi hunter Simon Wiesenthal in the TNT movie Max and Helen (1990). However, the summit of his post-Kobra, übernehmen Sie (1966) career was about to be scaled. He portrayed Bela Lugosi in Tim Burton's biopic Ed Wood (1994) and won glowing reviews. For his performance, he won the Best Supporting Actor Oscar. Martin Landau, the superb character actor, finally had been recognized with his profession's ultimate award. His performance, which also won him his third Golden Globe, garnered numerous awards in addition to the Oscar and Golden Globe, including top honors from the New York Film Critics Circle and the National Society of Film Critics. Landau continued to play a wide variety of roles in motion pictures and on television, turning in a superb performance in a supporting role in The Majestic (2001). He received his fourth Emmy nomination in 2004 as Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series for Without a Trace - Spurlos verschwunden (2002).\n\nMartin Landau was honored with his own star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, located at 6801 Hollywood Boulevard.\n\nMartin Landau died in Los Angeles, California on July 15, 2017.\n\nIda was born in London to a show business family. In 1932, her mother took Ida with her to an audition and Ida got the part her mother wanted. The picture was Her First Affaire (1932). Ida, a bleached blonde, went to Hollywood in 1934 playing small, insignificant parts. Peter Ibbetson (1935) was one of her few noteworthy movies and it was not until The Light That Failed (1939) that she got a chance to get better parts. In most of her movies, she was cast as the hard, but sympathetic woman from the wrong side of the tracks. In Der Seewolf (1941) and Entscheidung in der Sierra (1940), she played the part magnificently. It has been said that no one could do hard-luck dames the way Lupino could do them. She played tough, knowing characters who held their own against some of the biggest leading men of the day - Humphrey Bogart, Ronald Colman, John Garfield and Edward G. Robinson. She made a handful of films during the forties playing different characters ranging from Pillow to Post (1945), where she played a traveling saleswoman to the tough nightclub singer in Besuch in Kalifornien (1946). But good roles for women were hard to get and there were many young actresses and established stars competing for those roles. She left Warner Brothers in 1947 and became a freelance actress. When better roles did not materialize, Ida stepped behind the camera as a director, writer and producer. Her first directing job came when director Elmer Clifton fell ill on a script that she co-wrote Verführt (1949). Ida had joked that as an actress, she was the poor man's Bette Davis. Now, she said that as a director, she became the poor man's Don Siegel. The films that she wrote, or directed, or appeared in during the fifties were mostly inexpensive melodramas. She later turned to television where she directed episodes in shows such as Chicago 1930 (1959) and Auf der Flucht (1963). In the seventies, she made guest appearances on various television show and appeared in small parts in a few movies.\n\nMartin Henry Balsam was born on November 4, 1919 in the Bronx, New York City, to Lillian (Weinstein) and Albert Balsam, a manufacturer of women's sportswear. He was the first-born child. His father was a Russian Jewish immigrant, and his mother was born in New York, to Russian Jewish parents. Martin caught the acting bug in high school where he participated in the drama club. After high school, he continued his interest in acting by attending Manhattan's progressive New School. When World War II broke out, Martin was called to service in his early twenties. After the war, he was lucky to secure a position as an usher at Radio City Music Hall in New York City. By 1947, he was honing his craft at the Actors Studio, run at that time by Elia Kazan and Lee Strasberg. His time at the Actors Studio in New York City allowed him training in the famous Stanislavsky method. Despite his excellent training, he had to prove himself, just like any up and coming young actor. He began on Broadway in the late 1940s. But, it was not until 1951 that he experienced real success. That play was Tennessee Williams' \"The Rose Tattoo\". After his Broadway success, he had a few minor television roles before his big break arrived when he joined the cast of Die Faust im Nacken (1954). In the 1950s, Martin had many television roles. He had recurring roles on some of the most popular television series of that time, including The United States Steel Hour (1953), The Philco Television Playhouse (1948), Goodyear Television Playhouse (1951) and Studio One (1948). In 1957, he was able to prove himself on the big-screen once again, with a prominent role in Die zwölf Geschworenen (1957), directed by Sidney Lumet and starring Henry Fonda. All of Martin's television work in the 1950s did not go to waste. While starring on an episode of Alfred Hitchcock präsentiert (1955), Hitchcock was so impressed by his work, that he offered him a key supporting role of Detective Milton Arbogast in Psycho (1960). His work with Hitchcock opened him up to a world of other acting opportunities. Many strong movie roles came his way in the 1960s, including parts in Frühstück bei Tiffany (1961), Ein Köder für die Bestie (1962) and Die Unersättlichen (1964). One of the proudest moments in his life was when he received an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for Tausend Clowns (1965). It was soon after that he began accepting roles in European movies. He soon developed a love for Italy, and lived there most of his remaining years. He acted in over a dozen Italian movies and spent his later life traveling between Hollywood and Europe for his many roles. After a career that spanned more than fifty years, Martin Balsam died of natural causes in his beloved Italy at age 76. He passed away of a stroke at a hotel in Rome called Residenza di Repetta. He was survived by his third wife Irene Miller and three children, Adam, Zoe and Talia."
