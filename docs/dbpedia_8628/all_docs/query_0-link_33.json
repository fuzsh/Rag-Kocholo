        "text": "This year’s Festival will take place at New World Stages in New York City on October 26th and 27th, and feature eight exciting new musicals in 45-minute staged reading presentations in front of a industry-only audience. This must-attend event brings together theatre producers, presenters and developers from around the world to celebrate the future of these promising new musicals! Selected from a submission pool of 575 submissions by our Festival Committee, these eight musicals celebrate what’s next in musical theatre and the incredible stories and artists that are leading the way.\n\nAlready registered? Check out this year’s Guide to Navigating the Festival so you know what to expect when you arrive!\n\nView or download the program!\n\nSynopsis\n\nWhen her grandfather’s memory begins to fade, twelve-year-old Andi must brave a looming hurricane and embark on a perilous odyssey through the oddities of Florida in search of the one thing that might save him: the Fountain of Youth. A raucous folk-rock celebration of the healing power of family folklore, Fountain looks at love and loss through the eyes of a child—and encourages us all to find the wonder in the weird.\n\nSynopsis\n\nWhen a thirty-something actress is suddenly aged out of the industry, she undergoes an unconventional spa procedure to get her old life back. But it sets her on a whole new path to achieve true power and equality… at a cost. Fountain of You is an irreverently funny take on our preoccupation with youth, beauty, and the patriarchal system underlying it all.\n\nSynopsis\n\nInspired by a true story, Mija is a new bilingual musical about survival, identity and the complexity of family, following characters between continents, decades, and across generations. When Luisa leaves behind her sheltered life in the U.S. for Guatemala, she’s blindsided by a life-threatening pregnancy. In Oregon, Gabriela aches for grown-up life to start, but first she seeks to uncover secrets the adults around her deny.\n\nSynopsis\n\nHenry of Navarre never dreamed of being the King of France–until everything around him started mysteriously falling into place. Never Be King is a baroque meets pop-punk musical that asks how far we would go to be a footnote in someone else’s story. After all, history’s just a he-said she-said."
