        "text": "from YourComments\n\nWe are all theatreguys here!\n\n(Click on photos to enlarge\n\nPlease advise if any photos are not permitted to be used.)\n\nJohn Reed\n\nAugust 7, 2024\n\nA Chorus Line\n\nI have generally been cautious about the ubiquitous standing ovation in theatres, but after the dazzling finale of Chorus Line, I could not remain seated. THAT’S what an ovation should be. The exhilaration of the stage surged into the audience, and sitting was not enough. It was ages since I had seen this show but realised that there were really only a few occasions where the choreography of Bob Fosse was referred to. And NO I did not buy a gold bowler hat at the marketing stall; but I did buy the £8 programme which is very informative about the show. The cast is uniformly brilliant, both in their solo moments (some touching stories) and the collective drilled perfection of their routines. The point of the show, I think, is to demonstrate how all the complexities of the dancers, they are all squashed into ban anonymous mass in their work. Adam Cooper was an excellent and authoritative Zach but it allowed to indicate his own vulnerabilities through his relationship with Cassie (the sensational Carly Mercedes Dyer). Terrific performances, great band, and lighting. (though I couldn’t see that the video has a great deal to add, and wasn’t used with any consistency.\n\nThanks to the Boyz for terrific seats – it always occurs to me that Sadlers Wells is a superbly designed theatre, with excellent sightlines from just about anywhere.\n\nPhotos: Marc Brenner\n\nAndrew\n\nJuly 24, 2024\n\nSkeleton Crew\n\nFour workers facing the imminent threat of redundancy in their own very different ways. Faye, the union rep with 29 years service at the plant. She has seen it all before and is hoping that she will be able to achieve 30 years, as this would considerably enhance her severance and retirement benefits.\n\nDez, a younger worker hoping to start his own business is aggressive and rebellious. He feels that the union should be standing up to the management to demand better terms when and if the shutdown occurs.\n\nShanita, is the other young worker. She is pregnant and bubbles with enthusiasm about the future for her, and her unborn child. She is proud of the work she is doing and cannot see why the plant should be closing. She frequently berates Dez about his attitude, although there is an affection between them which she unsuccessfully tries to keep suppressed.\n\nThe fourth worker is Reggie. He is the supervisor of the shift, and is fully aware that the plant will be closing in the near future. Reggie finds it very difficult to have crossed the line from worker to management. Particularly as he has known Faye since he was a child.\n\nWe later learn that Faye was in a lesbian relationship with Reggie’s mother who had died some years previously. This had caused Faye’s life to fall apart . She gambled away everything she owned and unbeknown to everybody, was sleeping in the “breakroom” that they all shared. However, Faye was still very much the voice of reason, acting as a “Mother Hen’ character trying to stop any of the others giving the management any cause to lay them off, or to accelerate the plant shutdown in any way.\n\nThis was one of the most absorbing productions I have seen. I found I had total empathy with all of the characters, and genuinely felt their despair. The scene when Shanita announced that she had been offered a new job doing photocopy work, but she had turned it down because it wasn’t as creative or important as the job she was doing was almost heartbreaking. The cast were just stunning. All actors that I had never heard of. The scenes between Faye and Reggie were brilliant.\n\nThen, of course, there is the “Donmar Factor’. The intimacy of this extraordinary little theatre seems to enhance everything that is performed here.\n\nGarth\n\nJuly 24, 2024\n\nSkeleton Crew\n\nThe limits of my eartrumpet and its inability to conquer the Detroit patois render me poorly qualified to comment on this powerful play. As if that might stop me!\n\nWith apologies for probably grasping the wrong ends of who knows how many sticks, I felt that the playwright had found some eternal verities in the situations – industrial decline and exploitation, lost love, new life – played out on stage. Just what do we owe our fellow human beings in ethical terms? “Tribal loyalty”, often derided in the political sphere, means something very real and compelling in the context of employment (and prospective unemployment) in a capitalist world. The characters’ individual quirks, obsessions and weaknesses made for drama (and some humour), of course. But overarching those human frailties and failings, it’s the depiction of solidarity and mutual respect, growing into empathy (and even love) that gives the play its thrust and vitality. All this was suavely and convincingly conjured up by the extraordinary cast. Each of the four seemed to be wholly living his/her role, model examples of naturalistic playing.\n\nPredictably, the Donmar had spared nothing in the mise-en-scene, the grinding intensity of a motor car manufacture plant, the louring lighting, complete with spraying sparks, the brutal din, the corrosive musical overlay and the bleak ”breakroom”. You didn’t pause to wonder where the rest of the workforce (if any) were lurking.\n\nAltogether, as far as I clocked the play, a terrific reminder of the capacity of the human spirit to wrestle down the grim realities of our society.\n\nPhotos: Helen Murray\n\nDavid Warren Riseman\n\nJuly 24, 2024\n\nMrs Doubtfire the musical\n\nFirstly I would like to stress that the show was comical and had a happy feel to it, although not quite my scene, it was still enjoyable.\n\nGabriel Vick, Daniel and Mrs Doubtfire, was tremendous and multi talented in comedy, music and dancing.\n\nThe remaining cast were also excellent.\n\nIf I was an early teenager and saw this show I would have loved it but being a bit older than that I found the performance as a comic show entertaining but as a musical it fell a bit short.\n\nStill a very enjoyable evening in The West End.\n\nAndrew\n\nJuly 11, 2024\n\nBoys from the Blackstuff\n\nI felt that this production suffered from comparison with the original television series, which I thought was brilliant. Trying to compress approximately 5 to 6 hours of extremely well written drama into 2.5 hours was never going to be easy. I feel this was a valiant effort, but it fell well short. The heartbreaking pathos, and hilarious comedy of the original series never came across. Taking the “best bits” of the TV production, and cramming them into this limited time frame, resulted in too many actors on stage at the same time, all shouting at once. Thus greatly diluting the pathos and humour of the original.\n\nI recall the scene from the TV series when Yosser, at his absolute wits end, went to confession. He told the priest that his name was Yosser, and asked the priest if, instead of calling him Father, he could call him by his name. The Priest answered, yes my name is Dan. Yosser, with his head in his hands, then stated,” I’m desperate, Dan”. The line is funny, and raised a laugh in the theatre, but on the TV, Bernard Hill’s reaction, very slowly lifting his face out of his hands and staring hopelessly into the middle distance, realising that he had sunk even lower, made the whole interaction utterly hilarious.\n\nBasically, I found this production somewhat soulless. But it has received some excellent critical reviews. Possibly from writers considerably younger than myself, who were not fortunate enough to still have a vivid memory of the original TV series.\n\nAgain, many thanks Fredo and Mike for a very interesting evening.\n\nPhotos: Alastair Muir\n\nJean Birch\n\nJuly 3, 2024\n\nCarmen\n\nWhat a superb presentation by all the dancers. I thought the interpretation of the story was well portrayed – it was exciting, exhilarating and compassionate. I was in awe of such brilliant performances and their amazing stamina. Carlos Acosta was preaching to the converted anyway because I went along already knowing I would enjoy the show because I so love the Carmen music, but congratulations to Carlos for his wonderful choreography. Thumbs down to any bad reviews of this performance!!\n\nPhotos: Cristina Lanandez\n\nJohn Hayne Reed\n\nJune 28, 2024\n\nThe Constituent\n\nA limited access to reviews prior to visiting this play was pehaps a good thing. But I was rather impressed with the play; continually engrossing and with mesmerising performances from Anna Maxwell Martin and James Corden. HE was supposed to be the big attraction but I was relieved that he didn’t get a reflex ovation on his appearance. The role might have been made for him. His layering of his string of grievances about his life were well conveyed, and the final scenes of him as a broken man I found very moving. Anna Maxwell Martin is always excellent and she showed us the deep well of goodness and how it was battered from many sides. Some people felt that her final determination to help Alec despite everything that had gone before was sentimental and a cop-out by the author. I don’t agree. I did want a bit of optimism for both of the characters and don’t think that “sentimental” was the right word. Praise should also be given to Zachary Hart who made the most of his appearances.\n\nMike\n\nJune 28, 2024\n\nThe Constituent\n\nThe reviews were mixed, two to four stars, horses for courses, but there are many stables. And the fact that James Corden is Marmite should not affect a fair review. My expectations were low (Corden and Penhall seemed an odd mix) but once the leading duo got into their sparring I was hooked and the audience were clearly entertained. Today’s headlines were introduced (war-veteran constituent waylays MP at her surgery) and the topical laughs came aplenty. Of course Maxwell Martin was as nice as ever, and Corden lovers were treated to the loveable oaf he insists he is. And then as the theme darkened it all became so much more interesting: I was liking it much more than I expected. I willed it to achieve a 4 star rating from me – believable characters, the humour mixed effectively with the threatening tone, topical political tragedies in the front of my mind, and an effective well acted presentation. And then came the ending (spoiler alert) that I really was not expecting, was not wanting; it was an audience pleaser that did not please me – out of character, softly sentimental, and obviously aimed at Corden fans. It lost one of my four stars in that final scene. It changed from sharp newsworthy drama to just a goody feely maker of moist eyes. Nothing wrong with that but I was hoping for a harder finish after the tense build up.\n\nPhotos by Manuel Harlan\n\nJudith & John\n\nJune 22, 2024\n\nKiss Me Kate\n\nComing out of the theatre, we thought ‘they don’t write them like that any more’.\n\nA fabulous production full of colour, dance, humour and powerful songs.\n\nWe saw this musical about 20 years ago where scene changes involved curtains. Here, the revolving stage and the atmospheric lighting quickly changed the mood to give a smooth change between scenes.\n\nIt was interesting to see how the cast hovered on the edge of the action, not out of sight, even when not actually performing.\n\nAdrian Dunbar stood out as an older character among the others and gave a good performance, although not a strong singing voice.\n\nWe were in awe of the dancing and singing skills of the cast; such energy.\n\nThe orchestra pit looked quite perilous but the cast seemed to negotiate it confidently and the band were excellent.\n\nThe theatre is very good with comfortable seats, well raked too. Just a shame they couldn’t get it together with toilet facilities.\n\nThank you for this terrific and very memorable occasion.\n\nPhotos: Johan Persson\n\nGarth\n\nJune 13, 2024\n\nA View from the Bridge\n\nIntensive research (aka Googling) tells me that the first outing of Miller’s play in 1955 was as a verse drama – a form which saw something of a revival in the 20th century at the hands of Christopher Fry and T S Eliot and still staggers on today. Maybe AVFTB’s poetic origins show, even in its present form. It has a somewhat unreal, melodramatic quality, drawing apparently on Greek tragedy. I was not surprised to find that Miller himself worked on the libretto of William Bolcom’s opera (1999) that was inspired by the play.\n\nI confess to being in two minds about both the play and the production. No doubt, the production was on a tight budget and anything more lavish might have diluted the grim tale. The intensity of the close-knit immigrant community is a central plank of the drama. In my pathetically unimaginative way, I needed somehow a bit more mise-en-scène than that provided by the clapboard set, bleak lighting, sub-Charles Ives music and a couple of guys in cloth caps to conjure up the longshoreman context. All very well being told things by the narrator, but isn’t there a theatrical nostrum about show not tell?\n\nOf course, the themes that Miller addresses were potent in the 1950s and remain so now – patriarchal power, female liberation, brute masculinity, intense social conservatism, sexual jealousy, sexual orientation, prejudice, omertà….…the list could go on. Packing all those into the play is an achievement and the main players did them all proud. Dominic West reminded me of a long-gone rustic uncle of mine, stupidly assertive of his entrenched ignorance and hidden vulnerabilities. Kate Fleetwood as the sterling Beatrice was especially convincing.\n\nMaybe today we can cosily regard the play as a bit of a fossil, things having moved on etc – but I could not fathom the instant burst of laughter that greeted the notorious kiss, man-on-man. Is this no longer for modern audiences the point at which the demonstration of Eddie’s weaknesses and lack of understanding comes to a startling and serious climax? Was this a misreading of all that has gone before – by me or by West or by the director?\n\nAnyway, while I didn’t think that a standing ovation was warranted (another mistake by the audience?), the performance was a first-rate effort and the delectable surroundings of the Theatre Royal made for a stimulating evening.\n\nPhotos: Johan Persson\n\nJudith & John\n\nJune 12, 2024\n\nPhantom of the Opera\n\nThis is the second time that we have seen the show, previously some 25 years ago and we cannot remember who played the big parts. We did notice a contrast with Christine, last night she had a more operatic voice; very powerful and effective and also able to perform a ballad full of quiet emotion. The phantom was excellent, culminating in the tremendous finale which raised so many tears.\n\nThe start is of the sort that raises goose bumps when the organ bursts out and the chandelier is raised. It seemed more dramatic than the way it was done before.\n\nThe ‘magic’ tricks still eluded our explanation at the time inspite of them being explained on the internet.\n\nWe loved the masquerade too, so much to see and enjoy.\n\nThe whole thing was a spectacle and our only criticisms were about the orchestra volume at times and, in particular, where we could not pick out what was being sung, especially in the first act with them all fussing about letters and singing over each other with rather weak voices and poor diction.\n\nIt was a fabulous show with so many moving moments and subtle humour and we are so glad to have seen it again before it may be gone.\n\nThanks Fredo and Mike for this evening and for the pre show warm up on the coach.\n\nFraser\n\nJune 6, 2024\n\nJerry’s Girls\n\nThis is the first time I’ve come out of a Jerry Herman show not humming the tunes. And the reason is that there were too many, delivered at breakneck speed, and without any light and shade to distinguish them. Things picked up in the second half, with a few ballads blended into the mix. Otherwise, it was a bewildering collection of Herman’s hits embedded with some lesser-known works. A bit of scene-setting would have helped us to understand what the songs were about (thank you, Fredo, for explaining that one of the songs was sung by an aunt who’d adopted her nephew, and not by an abandoned wife). The performers worked hard, but their delivery verged on the frenetic. Too much, too fast, too fussy. The best of times? Not this time.\n\nPhotos: Tristram Kenton\n\nGarth\n\nMay 29 2024\n\nThe Cherry Orchard\n\nThis old codger’s heart sank slightly when he read that the play was to be in “a version” by the Director and that a live band would be on stage. In the event, any apprehensions were swept away by the sheer imaginative and dramatic force of the production and by the suite of glittering performances.\n\nThe production had great fluidity and brilliant ensemble playing. In the first half there was a lot to grasp – the individuality of the characters (which ran a little close to star turns), the back story, the tangled relationships – but all this flowed into the more potent second half. (Here the band was a real character in itself, subtle and moving).\n\nWhile Tsarist Russia and its inequities were real enough, the directorial shift away from some of the specificities of time and place yielded a strong contemporary resonance, a doomy sense of impending collapse, the consequences of the old regime’s savage insouciance. Tragically, Trofimov’s idealistic programme for the future was surely just as delusory as Ranevskaya’s displacement activity.\n\nPhotos: Johan Persson (More photos in News section 15/05/24)\n\nAndrew\n\nMay 2, 2024\n\nOperation Mincemeat\n\nA wonderful piece of manic, anarchic, and irreverent humour, which assaulted ones senses as soon as the curtain went up. This was Monty Python on speed! The brilliant cast must surely be totally exhausted after every performance. I couldn’t single out any one of them for individual praise, although there were times when I thought that David Cumming’s head would explode during his portrayals as Charles Cholmondeley.\n\nWhilst this production was essentially a humorous satire, and it was genuinely funny, there were\n\nmoments, and songs that were quite downbeat and sentimental. For me, these moments, amidst all the mayhem, were very effective, and really quite emotional.\n\nI thought overall this show was a perfect antidote, if only temporary, to the current gloom and political correctness which seem to pervade all sections of society at the present time. Judging from the immediate and enthusiastic standing ovation, I think the audience seemed to agree with me.\n\nAgain thanks Fredo and Mike for another great theatrical experience.\n\nPhotos: Matt Crockett\n\nJudith & John\n\nApril 28, 2024\n\nSleeping Beauty\n\nWe like the chance to see ballet companies other than the Royal Ballet and we have seen this company before in Don Quixote. Their performance was full of enthusiasm and energy and, although there were a few wobbles, we enjoyed the production immensely.\n\nWe loved the lavish costumes and set which created a wonderful atmosphere and our seats, near the stage, meant we could fully appreciate them and observe the footwork. The final act was especially enjoyable with such clever choreography; puss in boots, bluebird and red riding hood in particular.\n\nOne of the joys of such productions is the orchestra and the score for this ballet contains so many well known pieces that the person sat next to us was eyes closed and humming at points! We wonder how the orchestra cope with the mist from dry ice rolling into the pit.\n\nIt was quite a long production and some of it could be cut with little effect on the overall story.\n\nSadler’s wells is a lovely theatre and we have always enjoyed the groups visits there.\n\nThank you Fredo and Mike for choosing a ballet once again.\n\nPhotos: Tristram Kenton\n\nMike (Until someone else adds a comment)\n\nApril 19, 2024\n\nOpening Night\n\nAh yes, Opening Night, which has now announced an earlier-than-planned closing night. It’s a very odd musical mix of theatre angst and movie indulgence. All praise to everyone taking part – it seemed they all knew what was going on although we felt like onlookers not invited to the therapy session. Maybe no-one was brave enough to tell director Ivo van Hove, playing with his video cameras, that enough was enough. The big rear screen predominated so really we didn’t know whether to watch close-ups on film or the on-and-off stage-action. It helped having seen the 1977 movie a few months ago, and it seemed like madness to want to turn it into a musical. Now we know it was indeed a very odd decision. It had songs by Rufus Wainwright, most of which we enjoyed, especially well sung by Sheridan Smith and Nicola Hughes – play trailer above to listen. The performances were determinedly brave, but clearly it was not the sort of musical most were hoping for from Sheridan Smith. I feared the Group would be disappointed, but surprisingly on the coach home most said they were entertained by it….I was entertained too, by the talents involved and the open-stage presentation. Certainly the original John Cassavetes non-main-stream movie is an acquired taste, so maybe a smaller-scale show in a smaller theatre would have been more appropriate, without the pressures of West End expectations.\n\nPhotos: Jan Versweyveld\n\nIan\n\nApril 12 2024\n\nLong Day’s Journey Into Night\n\nAs therapy “written in tears and blood” by Eugene O’Neill to portray his experience of being raised by a family blighted by addiction, I found Long Day’s Journey Into Night to be enlightening and deeply moving. The play is set in the Tyrone family summer cottage (resembling a chicken shed) by the coast in Connecticut, on a despairing day like any other, apart from revelations of Edmund’s consumption and Mary’s failed rehabilitation for morphine addiction.\n\nLike most of us, the characters are flawed and deluded, blaming each other for their failures to grow up, whilst infected by a love which sticks them together on this sad day, and for the sad days to come, as well as for the 10,000 days now lost to memory in the fog of time. It is a play about how we are haunted by the past, and how it is so difficult to change. As Mary fatalistically proclaims: “The past is the present, it is the future too!”\n\nIt is also a play about words and meanings as they blame each other for their unhappy lives. When Jamie calls his father “stingy” we get it, and see how Mary’s addiction may have started with her husband’s employ of a cheap doctor. When Tyrone counters that he is not cheap but “prudent”, explaining that he was 10 years old when his father left home, and his mother penniless, we get that too, for we are all learning machines shaped by our environment.\n\nO’Neill is loyal and fair to his family refusing to judge or blame. There are no heroes or villains, only empathy and a desire to make sense of their lives, which brings a tenderness to the writing as he portrays the bitterness of failed hopes and dreams. Unlike an Arthur Miller play – where the protagonist often stumbles as “the chickens come home to roost” (said Miller) to deliver an emotional punch – O’Neill’s masterpiece has no denouement, no narrative arc, no protagonist and not even a pecking order. Like Rhode Island Reds cooped up in a wooden shed the characters fight, shriek and flap about, ruffling feathers but not drawing blood – imbetween endless mealtimes – before starting up all over again, to peck, cluck and preen, whilst laying blame (but no eggs) on each other.\n\nMary’s morphine addiction and denial ripples through the play, unsettling the men (even when she is offstage) as her fey sadness pervades the home like a sea mist; whist Tyrone’s alcoholic addiction is taken for granted. Finally Tyrone and Jamie confess to their sins, which gives them hope for change; whilst poor Mary can only pray to the Virgin for redemption and a return of her faith.\n\nI was amused when Tyrone spoke of his love of Shakespeare and how he squandered his talent in pursuit of money, which he seemed unable to spend, and so speculated on real estate to make more of it, as if he was blaming money and not himself on his inability to be happy.\n\nAs in Chekhov nothing really happens, which allows O’Neill to drill down into the thoughts and feelings of his characters as evoked by the writer’s particular understanding of the human condition. Thank you Fredo for recommending a great play, which I hope to see again some day, before the fog rolls in.\n\nPhotos: Johan Persson\n\nIan\n\nApril 3, 2024\n\nAbba Voyage\n\nWe are set to voyage back to 1979, when Abba were in their pomp, when the world of popular music was split between (uncool) Abba fans and those of us who knew better, such as punk rockers like myself (?). But just like growing old, the love of Abba creeps up on you, for me as a guilty pleasure in middle age; but it seems that we are all Abba fans now, I thought, as I took in the wildly diverse expectant crowd at this pop up arena in East London.\n\nWe are all here now, young and old, awaiting this word of mouth extravaganza to begin, watching the snow silently falling on a Swedish birch wood forest at night, with occasional spots of flashlight through the trees, as our heroic Swedish time travellers approach.\n\nPresently an absurdly lifelike Bjorn quietly walks onto the stage with a familiar smile to quote from the existentialist mind of the troubled Dane: “To be or not to be, that is the question”, says the hologram. No doubt the A’s and B’s of Abba asked themselves this same question, before creating this extravaganza; but now here we are, back in time – before the 1982 split, before they became cultural icons, before their Abba world domination.\n\nIt didn’t take long for my mind to adjust and reset, as if this really was a live Abba concert back in 1979. No point in criticising the holographic facial blow ups of blonde Agnetha for looking a little blank; for wasn’t her expression often a little sad and frozen, as she acted out the pathos and emotional narrative of songs about heartbreak and loss (whilst the boys seemingly laughed on, as if charmed by with their own creative brilliance). My favourite Abba song has Agnetha smiling and flirting with a stranger on a train in ‘The Day Before You Came’ video.\n\nWhat unfolds in Abba Voyage is an exhilarating musical journey with a spectacular light laser show. It was a unique experience; thoroughly immersive and entertaining, whilst unexpectedly emotional – what with the trick of time and mortality. Appropriately the show kicks off with the slow build of The Visitors, an underrated hypnotic song about ghosts; whilst it ends with the hit The Winner Take It All, which for me captures the timeless, enduring appeal of the Abba phenomenon, where in popular distillations of brilliant song Abba capture the ordinary but devastating pain of broken human relationships, that speak to and for all of us, and always will.\n\nThe gods may throw a dice,\n\nTheir minds as cold as ice.\n\nAnd someone way down here,\n\nLoses someone dear.\n\nBut we shall not lose them, as this time capsule celebration of Abba boldly proclaims, though it was touching and strangely human to see elderly avatars of their current selves walk on at the end of the show to wave goodbye.\n\nPhotos: Johan Persson / Ralph Larmann / etc\n\nAndrew\n\nMarch 28, 2024\n\nThe Human Body\n\nA very “Donmar” production. Thirty-six scenes, the supporting cast of three playing more than 20 characters, a constantly revolving stage, with technicians rushing props and furniture here, there, and everywhere, and cameramen walking around beaming the two lead actors onto a sceen whilst they were performing. What could possibly go wrong!?\n\nKeeley Hawes was quite superb. I had only seen her previously on television, where she is deservedly one of the “go to” female leads for many popular dramas. But on stage she was a revelation. Jack Davenport also gave an excellent performance, aided in no small measure by a brilliantly witty and caustic script, which gave his character a large proportion of the best lines. Although the excellent Tom Goodman-Hill, and Siobhan Redmond had some comedic “crackers” of their own.\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed this innovative production, although I felt that the first half was a little bit frantic. The second half, where Keeley Hawes’ character saw her future dreams and ambitions ultimately crumble, was far more manageable.\n\nThe last scene, which saw her return to her job as a GP, and pull on a doctors’ plain white coat over the Dior ensemble that she was wearing, was a great piece of symbolism. Then opening her surgery door and delivering the line to the audience, “Now what seems to be the trouble?” Was a great ending.\n\nThanks Fredo & Mike for a very interesting evening.\n\nPhotos by Marc Brenner\n\nMargaret\n\nMarch 13, 2024\n\nStanding at the Sky’s Edge\n\nMike and I really enjoyed this production. l was particularly engrossed as I know Sheffield quite well and have memories of seeing those dwellings in the sky. There was a noticeable change of mood in the second half and I can see why some found it too lengthy. But I was so invested in the characters by then and so fascinated by the staging not to mention the music that I enjoyed every minute. Mike and I ,for our sins, are not stage musical fans but this blend of wonderful music and complex drama really changed our minds . Thank you Fredo and Mike for a great night out.\n\nPhotos: Brinkhoff Moegenburg / Johan Persson\n\nAngie Dale\n\nMarch 11, 2024\n\nNye\n\nIf the purpose of live theatre is to entertain, then Nye, incorporating pathos, humour, satire ,even song and dance, is a success. Michael Sheen as Nye Bevan owned the stage. His magnetic charismatic performance held the audience throughout ,despite being bare foot and clad only in red and white striped panamas.\n\nThe play opens with Nye terminally ill in an NHS hospital ward. His morphine induced hallucinations takes the audience through his life from poverty stricken childhood in the Rhondda; positions in local government and trade unions to Housing and Health Minister in Atlee’s 1948 Labour government. Sheen’s passionate performance powerfully depicts a man at once recalcitrant , uncompromising in his vision of a fairer society, yet flawed. A man desperate to “help” yet unable, so it seemed, to support his own father as he lay dying of ‘black lung.’\n\nThe deceptively minimalistic set is extraordinarily effective. Hospital green is the predominant colour with ECG graphs intermittently flitting across the stage. Institutional beds become in turn a podium , a library and the Chamber in the House of Commons. The use of multi media in the form of faces projected on a screen the width of the stage illustrate the overwhelming objection of the medical profession to the very idea of a national health service.\n\nIf I were to find fault at all it would be that the scenes between Nye, his wife Jenny Lee and his old friend added nothing significant to the play. These scenes tended to be static and the play lost some of its momentum.\n\nOne cannot help but wonder what Nye would think of HIS NHS today. Undoubtedly, he would be amazed at the advances in medical science, but perhaps also dismayed at the problems that very success has created\n\nIts been awhile since I joined you on a trip to the theatre Fredo. Thank you very much. I loved it.\n\nPhotos: Johan Persson\n\nJune\n\nFebruary 22, 2024\n\nJust For One Day\n\nThis show is amazing. To truly understand the superhuman feat that Bob Geldof accomplished in 1985, it helps to have actually lived through it and seen, albeit on tv screens, the dreadfulness that was the reason for Live Aid. That said, I guess we can all appreciate good music – and good it was – so this show will reach out to the young and old alike and hopefully keep Bob’s legacy alive. God bless him.\n\nBTW We enjoyed it so much we booked to see it again………..\n\nPhotos by Manuel Harlan\n\nPauline\n\nFebruary 13, 2024\n\nDear Octopus\n\nA very pleasant and charming play.

I haven’t seen the film and was not sure what to expect. It was fabulous. So many dancers each with their own characters and the usual touch of Matthew Bourne humour as well. How on earth did Liam Mower manage to dance and lift with those blades on his hands? The music was good as well and lovely to see both Liam Mower and Dominic North on the same night. You chose a good day Fredo. Many thanks.\n\nPhotos: Tristram Kenton\n\nNicole\n\nDecember 12, 2023\n\nMacbeth\n\nI’ve never heard Shakespeare’s language so clearly and so trippingly spoken on a stage. What a treat! It enabled the actors to run the whole gamut of emotion and to take us along on a rising tide of tension. And what tension! I was on the edge of my seat throughout and actually welcomed the light relief of the porter, played like a standup comedian.\n\nThe whole company was faultless but I have to single out David Tennant. I’ve watched him progress through the canon from Antipholus to Hamlet and he’s always exceeded my expectations. The bare stage and the clever use of music and lighting all added to an atmosphere of inescapable horror. I wouldn’t have missed it for the world. Thank you, Fredo and Mike!\n\nWendy Edwards\n\nDecember 12, 2023\n\nMacbeth\n\nWow! It was everything and more! Everything about this production was amazing.

Something he will never forget.\n\nThank you for organising it for us.\n\nPhotos by Marc Brenner\n\nGillian\n\nDecember 6, 2023\n\nLyonesse\n\n(Edited) This play had me enthralled from the very beginning with Lily James’ performance as a slightly ditsy, over-whelmed mother and career woman. I felt her dilemmas. It was a strong cast with Kristen Scott-Thomas playing an eccentric, aging actress who wanted to tell her life story now she free to do so and the parallel’s between her and Lily James soon came obvious. The story of two women who were controlled, in different ways, by the men in their lives. There was humour, there was angst and there was dismay. Well worth seeing.\n\nMaggie\n\nDecember 6, 2023\n\nLyonesse\n\n(Edited) In total contrast to Gillian’s comments I was totally underwhelmed . Kirsten Scott-Thomas’s performance carried the show; Lily James was very irritating and seemed uncomfortable in the role.The story line didn’t seem to go anywhere . It could easily have been at least an hour shorter also the prolonged total blackness between scenes seemed totally unnecessary .\n\nJohn Reed\n\nDecember 6, 2023\n\nLyonesse\n\n(Edited) I also don’t agree with Gillian and found it unconvincing, But curiously I agree with Maggie in that I wasn’t quite bored, more frustrated that the issues surrounding Being a Woman were introduced but then not developed. I also found Lily James monotonous to listen to in her extended speeches but even she had some powerful moments. Kristen Scott Thomas is a pretty interesting actor to look at and she displayed some good comic timing. But I didn’t find convincing her reasons for abandoning her career which had held so much promise. And the hoped-for comeback put me in mind of Gloria Swanson in Sunset Boulevard.\n\nEdwina\n\nDecember 7, 2023\n\nLyonesse\n\n(Edited) I can appreciate both the positive and negative comments that have been made. Agreed it was too long, sections of it drawn out for no particular gain and opportunities were missed to explore and hone some of the main points.\n\n(The unedited versions of these comments can be found on the YourComments page.)\n\nAndrew\n\nDecember 2, 2023\n\nDear England\n\nWhen one knows that a show has a running time of 2 hours and 50 minutes there is always, well certainly in my case, a slight degree of trepidation. But there was no need in this case. I was completely engrossed from beginning to end. Joseph Fiennes’ portrayal of Gareth Southgate was so uncannily accurate that it was almost unnerving. There were also brilliant performances from the supporting cast. Will Close gave us a sympathetically satirised Harry Kane, showing a man confident in his own footballing abilities, but struggling with the pressures of leadership. Josh Barrow as the manic hyped up Jordan Pickford was a joy to watch. But all of the cast gave faultless portrayals of their real life counterparts.\n\nI’m not a great follower of football, but I became interested when it was clear that after Gareth Southgate’s appointment, he was going to attempt to change from the somewhat “Neanderthal” style of coaching to a more “holistic’ approach. I felt that this production told the story of his journey with great skill and clarity. Southgate’s initial meeting with the Football Association hierarchy, Greg Clarke, and Greg Dyke, showed the two men’s utterly clueless attitude to the sport that they are purported to be governing. Sadly they were so typical of the heads of most sport in this Country. I follow rugby quite closely, where the governing body are known by fans as the “Blazered Buffoons”.\n\nRant over! As well as brilliant characterisations, the choreography, set, and direction of this production were, to my mind, absolutely faultless. They really hit the back of the net with this one! Profuse apologies, but I couldn’t resist it.\n\n(Photos – see this LINK)\n\nIan Hutcheon\n\nNovember 30, 2023\n\nThe House of Bernarda Alba\n\nHaving watched some of the the film I especially wanted to see Lorca’s famous play at the NT, believing that they would do it justice by echoing the grieving Bernada’s coercive menacing of her 5 daughter’s sex lives (they will have no contact with men for 8 years) by staging the play in the the natural place for which it was written, evoking the dark sombre repressive mood of Franco’s Spain in the 1930’s. But we got none of that.\n\nIt seems at planning someone with authority (but little love for the play) set off with one decisive step in the wrong direction! Conversely, maybe it needed ‘modernising’ to attract an audience, for the staging is certainly visually stunning. We are presented with a very modern stylised doll’s house in section with 11 rooms on 3 floors bathed in a green watery light like a swimming pool. Too many things happen at the same time and I couldn’t keep up. The daughters take refuge from their authoritarian mother in their bedrooms (dressing or undressing) whilst grandma or the witty servants provide commentary on the daughter’s hopes as they turn to ashes.\n\nLike a Spanish bull treading water the slow motion balletic dancing of a muscular brutish man weaves across the stage before returning to the garden like a metaphor for predatory male sexuality. But no, this is no metaphor, but the ‘unseen’ man Pepe el Romano, set to marry the 39 year old daughter Angustias for her money, whilst in love with the beautiful 20 year old Adela for other reasons.\n\nHarriet Walter’s has some great lines but her role as the fiercely protective deranged mother is greatly diminished as the stylised and stunning production drowns out the dark and dramatic intensity of the play.\n\nOverall a disappointing version of the play for me, but for all that also a curiously enjoyable theatrical experience!\n\nMike and Margaret\n\nNovember 22, 2023\n\nThe House of Bernarda Alba (a Preview performance)\n\nI had seen this play once before but Fredo’s introduction helped to jog my memory of a stunning production with Glenda Jackson at the Lyric Hammersmith. This version cannot match that accolade and Harriet Walter’s matriarch did not make one flinch as much. . However there were intriguing moments, dramatic shocks and intense performances. The set however seemed to be the biggest talking point. It was a slice through a three storey dwelling and the audience sees the daughters preparing for bed in a way rather more modern than in thirties Catholic Spain. But all the activity upstairs often distracted from the action downstairs. Grandma got up to some very sneaky actions in her fantasy world. Women lusting for men is rather an unfeminist idea today unless the play is firmly set in the Spanish restricted thirties Lorca was exploring. Although the play had flaws it set us talking and as ever the buzz at the National is always enjoyable.\n\nPhotos by Marc Brenner\n\nTony & Victoria\n\nNovember 29, 2023\n\nOh What a Lovely War\n\nFrom the time we entered Southwark Playhouse we became part of this wonderful piece of theatrical atmosphere. No glossy showroom but something to be retained for ever. As we made the way through to our seats , members of the cast interacted with the audience blurring the edges of stage & auditorium.\n\nThe set seemed to be just a simple collection of unresolved ideas & the cast were dressed in sympathy. Once the play started everything blended together. The perfect timing, the change between comedy & tragedy, the musicality, light & blackness, worked so well.\n\nThe beautiful music & songs which grew from the tragedy of war were sharply contrasted with the relentless list of casualties ticking up on the monitor hanging above the stage. Those millions who died, died for their countries & fellow soldiers not for the bits of real Estate which short lived politicians had in mind.\n\nThe last gloriously sung finale of And when they ask us…. summed it all up.\n\nThe best piece of theatre this year.\n\nPhotos: Alex Harvey-Brown\n\nGillian and Tony\n\nNovember 15, 2023 at 8:27 am\n\nBackstairs Billy\n\nThis play was about the Queen Mother and her relationship with her favourite butler Billy. From start to finish the play was delivered with superb acting from all the cast, especially the lead actors, Penelope Wilton and Luke Evans. There was plenty of comedy, quick witticisms, some rude words and social observations, farcical elements and emotional moments. Not forgetting the live corgis. The set was a perfect take on a royal household too.\n\nYou certainly got a flavour of the Queen Mother, her strengths and vulnerabilities and the inter-dependence between the two main characters. But there was a line that you did not cross with her Majesty….\n\nWe truly enjoyed this strong comedic play with its quick-fire one-liners and would highly recommend.\n\nThank you Fredo and Mike for another entertaining evening in the West End.\n\nPhotos: Johan Persson\n\nMartin Hampson\n\nNovember 7, 2023\n\nTo Have and to Hold\n\nI’m afraid it left me cold..any plot was so weak as to be non existent,thought was overscripted and overacted..one liners appeared to be squeezed in at every opportunity…not for me I’m afraid…\n\nCan’t win em all…!\n\nSteve and Sandra\n\nNovember 13, 2023\n\nTo Have and To Hold\n\nWe were not able to see this play with Fredo, so we booked it directly and went on Saturday.\n\nSince the reviews of the play were poor and there were some negative reviews on your website, we were very apprehensive about whether we should have booked. We really enjoyed the play and found it very amusing. Alan Armstrong was fantastic especially the Pasti story at the end. The part of the play where the wife tried to remember the name of the film and actor was well done and a bit to near home!\n\nPhotos: Marc Brenner\n\nJennifer\n\nOctober 24, 2023\n\nClyde’s\n\nLynn Nottage has received much acclaim for her plays, some of which depict the hard scrabble lives lived by many Americans. The chance to see her latest play at the Donmar had to be taken especially with Giles Terera adding star wattage to the cast.\n\nThe play focuses on a small group of ex-cons who have been taken on as short order cooks by Clyde, the hard bitten owner of a run down diner. As the play unfolds, we learn about their past lives and how they ended up inside, the struggles they are having to re-integrate into society, and the casual cruelty of a system stacked against them personified by Clyde’s harsh treatment and disregard for any employment rights they might have.\n\nSo far, so grim and yet the message of the play is one of hope and making progress, however limited, against the odds. Terera’s charismatic Montrellus encourages his younger co-workers to realise their potential through devising and making the very best sandwich they can inspired by the best of themselves as rounded human beings. Who knows, they might even persuade Clyde to agree to adding garnish to a truck driver’s sandwich……\n\nIn the cold light of day, this sounds like a cliche. Maybe it is. The skill of Nottage’s writing, and the excellent cast and direction, is to show us how the people who we might not notice in the sandwich shop have a right to hope and to find a better life. In these particularly grim times, that message is worth hearing.\n\nPhotos: Marc Brenner\n\nJudith, John, Jean and David\n\nOctober 18, 2023\n\nFrank and Percy\n\nWe all booked with the certainty that these 2 big names would give us a great evening, even if it was just 2 old men on a park bench reminiscing and complaining about the state of the world and their own health.\n\nIt turned out to be rather a surprise!\n\nA very clever play written with insight and maturity.\n\nThere were some sad points but overall we found it very funny and they seemed to be really enjoying what they were doing as much as we were in watching,\n\nHaving set the scene in the first half, we enjoyed the second half more. The sight of the pair of them dressed for the Pride march was quite something and then there was the karaoke!\n\nThe dogs off stage and comments gave us a picture of how they might look and behave without the problems of managing real animals on stage.\n\nOverall a terrific evening at this new theatre and thank you for this memorable booking.\n\nPhotos: Jack Merriman\n\nOld Friends\n\nReview to be added later\n\nPhotos: Danny Kaan\n\nGarth October 5, 2023\n\nPygmalion\n\nWith the glottal stop seriously in vogue in public discourse, you might think that the play, written and premiered just before the start of WWI, is way out of date. The BBC clearly now favours Estuarian rather than R P. Who now dares to talk proper other than J Rees-Mogg? But this perky production – smart, sleek and stylish – is curiously timely. It may come over as light and droll, but it manages to poke around our social expectations and conventions, with issues of social mobility, class, feminism, male hegemony and insensitivity all alive and kicking today. All the principals were spot on in their characterisations, with Patsy Ferran’s Eliza wonderfully expressive, Bertie Carvel as Higgins mixing fatuousness and petulance, and John Marquez as Alfred Doolittle providing some monumental home truths. Matinee fare, yes, but nourishing and enjoyable.\n\nMike and Margaret Spoor October 5, 2023\n\nPygmalion\n\nWhen the play opened with the scene in Covent Garden I was a little unsure about the set and even more unsettled by Eliza’s parka. However as the performance gathered pace I began to overlook the peg board set and at times incongruous costumes and became absorbed in the electrifying performances of Bertie Carvel’s Higgins and Patsy Ferran as Eliza Doolittle. Energy is the ingredient Richard Jones has chosen to bring to the scenes which border at times on slapstick but the language of GBS always saves the day. It is funny, telling and at times thought provoking. Except for the hat she donned for Albert Doolittle’s wedding Sylvestra Le Touzel as Mrs Higgins rang very true and we loved John Marquez ‘s Mr Doolittle not only for a cracking performance but because he was the spitting image of an acquaintance ! In all, a lovely matinee visit. Many thanks Fredo and Mike as well as our doughty driver Paul who had to contend with dreadful traffic\n\nPhotos: Manuel Harlan\n\nJean Birch September 13, 2023\n\nLes Miserables\n\nThis musical is my favourite, always with wonderful music and voices. However in this production Fantine was miscast by a buxom lass when she should be slim, frail and vulnerable! Not sure how much I am leaning towards nostalgia, but recollection wants to remember better performances and I definitely prefer the old barricades. However it was a first visit for my guest who thought it was absolutely wonderful – and cried the whole way through!!\n\nDavid Riseman August 30, 2023\n\nnext to normal\n\nVery exceptional singing and acting by all members of the cast there were no weak links.\n\nThe subject was not easy for a play let alone a musical.\n\nWe were drained at end of the performance.\n\nWe both enjoyed the whole experience even with the difficult subjects of the show\n\nhowever it would be hard to recommend to most of our acquaintances.\n\nLinda & I still enjoyed a lovely evening in the theatre.\n\nTricia Collins August 12, 2023\n\nRomeo and Juliet\n\nThe contrast between the stark backdrop of the institution, the group zombie-like moves and climbing the walls, brought a very powerful love story to life. Matthew Bourne always goes the extra mile and I loved his interpretation of the power of love against all odds, no matter where that may be. Thank you F and M for another amazing dance experience.\n\n(Photos: Johan Persson)\n\nJudith & John August 3, 2023 at 7:32 pm\n\nJewels\n\nAn evening absolutely crammed with endorphins. How could anyone leave the performance feeling less than exhilarated. We have never seen this ballet before so did not know what to expect.\n\nThe first act, Emeralds was ok and It was interesting to hear Faure put to dance but when act 2 came, things really exploded. A riot of sparkling costumes and brilliantly coordinated movement. The Stravinsky was not familiar to us and the references to ragtime and the syncopation went so well with the choreography.\n\nDiamonds was a wonderful climax and, just when we thought it was done, it became even better with spectacular numbers on stage in dazzling white costumes. Our seats in the amphitheatre enabled us to appreciate the precision of each sequence.\n\nThe company should rightly be proud of their performances.\n\nNot knowing any of the dancers makes it difficult to comment on them but we think it was the petite Benedicte Bemet in Diamonds that really stood out with her strong confident partner Joseph Caley.\n\nThanks for such a great evening. In great contrast to when we went ‘unsupervised’ to Cinderella in April, staying the night in Covent Garden, so inconvenient and expensive! It makes us really appreciative of the hard work that Fredo and Mike do.\n\nMike and Margaret July 27, 2023\n\nMoulin Rouge\n\nThis show certainly brightened up a rainy evening in July. It was full of colour and energy. I preferred the quieter moments in the second half with the lovers Satine – played and sung beautifully by Melissa James and Jamie Muscato’s Christian. Ian Carlyle as Toulouse Lautrec provided the humour to lighten the drama. Mike was especially impressed by the spectacular staging. However I did find the production a bit full on at times- my age probably showing as the audience were fully appreciative at the finale.\n\nJudith & John July 19, 2023\n\nThe Crown Jewels\n\nThe start was pretty unpromising, indistinct dialogue with a lot of shouting or mumbling. It seemed to be turning into an adult pantomime with some basic double entendres and crude references. We had the impression of a poor attempt at Upstart Crowe. Luckily things did improve somewhat with Al Murray’s King Charles interacting with the audience; we assumed the couple in the box were set a set up but was great fun. Doubling up on characters seemed to work very well, with quick changes of costume, and Mel Giedroyc as a French aristocratic lady was excellent with her accent and timing. We enjoyed the second act more although the pointless swearing and more basic references were irritating. Aidan McArdle came into his own and he made the most of the part, Carrie Hope Fletcher was not given much to sing but, although some lyrics were dubious, it was good to have narrative songs included, she reminded us of Nancy in Oliver.\n\nIt was interesting to see Neil Morrissey on stage, although the stage may not be his forte, he seemed somewhat uncomfortable when interviewed on the one show too.\n\nThe set was very well designed with revolving door scenes, they must have had a lot of rehearsal to get it right.\n\nWe look forward to the press reviews. Thanks Fredo and Mike, we are glad we went as we did enjoy it, we would consider seeing it again after a few months run to see how it evolved.\n\nJill July 4, 2023\n\nPatriots\n\nAn excellent evening of theatre. The staging and lighting was especially good, mesmerisingly transitioning rooms and scenes throughout the play, with no distraction. The acting was outstanding. Was that really Will Keen? Or one of Putin’s body doubles, of which he reputedly has so many. Extraordinary performance and attention to detail, as Putin grew in authority and power.\n\nI am especially grateful to Fredo and Mike for finding extra tickets for me at the eleventh hour. My guests hugely enjoyed the whole performance,\n\nHow fortunate we are.\n\nWilliam & Jane July 2, 2023\n\nAspects of Love\n\nHaving seen the original back in 1989 we were interested to see how the 34 years had changed it.\n\nThe transition from Alex to George was well played by Michael Ball who always looked at ease, as did Laura Pitt Pulford as Rose; we just remember the late Ann Crumb in the original role but Laura had the edge.\n\nWe thought the scene changes were carried out in a interesting manner; we all get used to projections at the theatre these days but did enjoy the way they were carried out.\n\nThe songs are all favourites and the hit Love Changes Everything was delivered with ease, let’s face it Michael must have sung it thousands of times. On the night Seeing is Believing and The First Man You Remember were top of our list.\n\nThe news on Friday that the show is ending early is disappointing so a special thank you to Mike and Fredo arranging the trip.\n\nHow many stars – well it is a favourite of ours so 4 stars.\n\nEdwina June 21, 2023\n\n42nd Street\n\nOne Word Review – SUBLIME\n\nDigby Fairweather – June 13, 2023\n\nWHEN WINSTON WENT TO WAR WITH THE WIRELESS\n\nGwen and I are newcomers to TheatreGuys but our first trip to join you to see the play above was a joy from beginning to end. Apart from the pleasure of a comfortable trip to and from the theatre we appreciated Fredo’s hospitality, efficiency and valuable insights into the background of the play before we arrived. Once there we found the production outstanding, inspiring and moving; leaving a great many areas for enjoyable discussion thereafter. As ‘newby’s’ to British theatre it was also most instructive not only to se an A-team of actors at what was plainly performing-peaks but to have their status clarified by Fredo on the way home afterwards. In short the whole experience was something close to an introduction to an exciting ‘new world’ and we look forward to joining you on many future occasions. Thank you Fredo and Mike. Gwen and Digby Fairweather.\n\nMike June 11, 2023 (We saw a preview on 24/05/23)\n\nAspects of Love\n\nStudent Alex sleeps (you know what I mean) with actress Rose; Uncle George sleeps with mistress Giulietta but is attracted to Rose who reminds him of his deceased first wife Delia. Time passes and Alex sleeps with Rose again, but then (oh dear) Rose sleeps with George. Alex shoots Rose (don’t ask!) who survives. George (oddly) thinks Rose ought to be with Alex but she sleeps with Giulietta instead. Then again with Alex and Uncle George, and somewhere along the timeline Rose marries George and gives birth to Jenny. More time passes and Jenny grows up to look like Delia who you will remember was Uncle George’s first wife. Teenage Jenny is attracted to Alex. Jenny wants to sleep with Alex who of course is old enough to be…..er..…her father, but he refuses as he still loves Rose. Giulietta gives advice but it’s complicated and, as we all know and are reminded of frequently, “love, love changes everything”.\n\n(Here’s a non-Spoiler because it doesn’t happen) It’s a show in which time is crucial and if you add up the numbers (very approx 2+12+1=15years) the maths tells us the teenager Jenny (wearing George’s first wife’s dress) could nevertheless be Alex’s daughter. They are in France; the age of consent is lower there, only 15; Jenny loves Alex; we are on the brink of a dramatic revelation; there could be a step too far – incest! Stop, perish the thought…we are in England and remember this is a nice Lloyd Webber musical….and that is just what happens, the show stops, no dramatic revelation, no mega mix; to know that “love, love changes everything” is supposedly enough. Not enough for me though.\n\nFor this revival, Jenny’s age has been tweaked so they say she’s 18 instead of 15; that underage incest possibility is put to bed without dad. Alex becomes her cousin instead, but even that apparently is a bit risqué for London these puritan days. Aspects of Incest would have worked for me.\n\nBut I did enjoy the show. The cast are terrific with great voices; pretty views pass by on screen projections, and we even get to visit Venice and ride in a gondola on the Grand Canal. ‘Love Changes Everything’ worms its way into our heads like a dire warning. The curtain falls in a coitus interruptus sort of way before the i-word can be muttered. Uncle George (Michael Ball), portly but in good voice, gets a standing ovation, and we rush off to the Tube knowing “love, love changes everything”, and rather wishing it didn’t.\n\nGarth June 2, 2023 at 6:09 pm\n\nBrokeback Mountain\n\nNot exactly theatre in the round at Sohoplace, more like in the rectangle…. The prospect of a play interlarded with country & western was for me not very inviting, but in the event, I felt that the combination was sensitive and worked well. Overall, indeed, the emotional pull of the piece strengthened after a rather starved start. Set, props and players notwithstanding, the springs of the drama – place, time and characters – needed to be more generously established. Of course, love at first sight may resist explication, yielding as the rest of the play demonstrated to a longer-lasting relationship. Quite what that relationship was built on may have remained unclear, and ultimately it fell short of full commitment. The two principals gave us full value and more. I lost count of just how many times those boots were tugged off and slipped on again.\n\nJennifer\n\nMay 24, 2023 The Motive and the Cue\n\nWhen I realised that Johnny Flynn would be starring in the National’s production of The Motive and the Cue I had to see it! Does that make me any different from the fans who waited outside the theatre each night in 1964 hoping to catch a glimpse of Richard Burton or Elizabeth Taylor? Probably not…\n\nThis play within a play is, as many critics have noted, a “love letter to theatre” but it also deals thoughtfully with the conflict between fame (being a film star) and art (being a theatre actor), celebrity and artistic endeavour. Johnny Flynn as Burton, delivers a deceptively showy performance which subtly reveals the film star who longed to be A Great Actor as the play progresses. Sometimes, maintaining the Burton accent gets in the way of his performance but he uses his own charisma to convince as the tortured artist who was also a drunk and possibly a little overwhelmed by his superstar wife.\n\nThat said, the production belongs to Mark Gatiss. He has the best lines and the most sympathetic character. He Is Gielgud. Witty, laconic, sad, scared about being forgotten. The resolution of the conflict with Burton in the final act is a little too easy but his is the performance I’ll remember.\n\nBarbara and Dennis May 4, 2023\n\nAin’t Too Proud\n\nHaving had the opportunity to see The Drifters Girl and Tina with Fredo and Mike, the musical bar is set very high!! Sadly Aint too Proud did disappoint, it was an enjoyable night out but did not have the spark other musicals have had. If you are a Temptations fan it would have been everything and more you could have wanted, telling the story of the group dynamics and the anti black racism that was prevalent at the time. The show just ended…….the entire cast and band were on stage for what we thought may have been a ‘mega mix’ that would have left us on a high, but no. It really was a play with music rather than a musical. Not sure if it will be running next year and it’s not on of those ‘must see again’ shows\n\nThank you Fredo and Mike, and a special thank you to Frank for the challenging drive home.\n\nJennifer April 26, 2023\n\nGuys & Dolls\n\nGuys and Dolls is one of my favourite musicals and I’ve been lucky enough to see some wonderful productions over the years with top notch casts (who could blame Jamie Parker or Imelda Staunton for wanting to show off their vocal prowess as Sky Masterson or Miss Adelaide?). Nick Hytner knew he had big shoes to fill when taking on G&D and boy did he go for it! The mise en scene was so clever even if the narrow gangways restricted the movement of the dancers at times. And, unfortunately, I couldn’t always see what was happening on the floor (particularly during the scenes in Havana). Like others, I found the movement of the stage props and the stream of groundlings walking out of the auditorium to get another drink distracting. However, these are quibbles; you know you’re enjoying a show when, even if you know what’s coming next, it’s a pleasure to see how it’s done. I was particularly struck with the characterisation of Nathan and Miss Adelaide. Daniel Mays and Marisha Wallace brought real poignancy to their portrayal of the lovers stuck in a, ahem, rut. I was less convinced by the chemistry between Sky and Sister Sarah; both were tall and handsome and could sing beautifully but they didn’t “sizzle” for me at least. Was that because Sky would rather have been dancing with the boys back at the bar in Havana? In my mind, I’m still there now, singing along.\n\nJudith & John April 12, 2023\n\nPrivate Lives\n\nWe had a wonderful evening with this production. Fabulous seats, so close to the stage that there was nowhere for the cast to hide! It was a very brave thing for the director to put his own ideas into it in the way he did. The scenes of domestic violence did understandably disturb some people and it is a sad commentary on life today, when we hear so much about it, that we seem to become rather hardened to it. However, the elements of farce did soften things for us.\n\nThe cast were terrific and, in particular, the connection between Stephen Mangan and Rachael Stirling was so powerfully convincing. At the start, in the veranda scene, Stephen Mangan seemed slow to settle in with rather hasty dialogue but he got into his stride and gave a fine performance. Watching Rachael Stirling at close quarters was a real treat; every expression, the movement of her hands, her body language all blended to convincingly portray her character.\n\nAfter previous experiences with reading reviews before seeing a production, we said never again so this time we looked afterwards and stuck to reviews of other productions, happy to wait for press night reviews of this one. A production with Nigel Havers and Patricia Hodge must have been very different, it is hard to imagine him as the perpetrator of domestic violence.\n\nWe much enjoyed the health and safety break to sweep up broken glass and the actors burying faces to try not to laugh and there were instances where they seemed to struggle to keep composure during the coffee and brioche episode!\n\nIt is also very brave of the Donmar to make the scene change in the way they did. We wonder if it will go well every night and what will be the state of the set at the end of the run.\n\nThe musical side of the production was excellent, Stephen Mangan doing his bit on the piano and the viola and cello players in the interval having their own domestic dispute with the cellist finally dragged off as he started to play the Elgar cello concerto!\n\nThanks Fredo and Mike for this visit; it joins the long list of memorable productions.\n\nSue Webster April 5, 2023\n\nShirley Valentine\n\nMy first theatre trip for a very long while and I was overwhelmed by a truly powerful performance by Sheridan Smith in the title role. Busy in her kitchen we were not distracted by her domestic routines as she was able to include the audience ( and “wall” of course) in her dissatisfaction with her marriage, her demanding husband and the possibility of a brief escape to a Greek island…..I found the Act 1 to be be very amusing but was also aware of latent unhappiness……\n\nAct 2 was in every way more thought provoking – enhanced by the simple set and Shirley being more static. She coped well with being left alone, enjoyed a holiday romance and after a lot of agonised thought made a brave decision to stay on the island. As Fredo asked on the coach what do we think happened after Joe’s visit to take her home? Sadly we will never know but the various possibilities kept me awake last night!\n\nJohn Reed\n\nMarch 27, 2023 Marjorie Prime"
