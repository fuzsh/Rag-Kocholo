        "text": "Hugh Michael Jackman is an Australian actor, singer, multi-instrumentalist, dancer and producer. Jackman has won international recognition for his roles in major films, notably as superhero, period, and romance characters. He is best known for his long-running role as Wolverine in the X-Men film series, as well as for his lead roles in the romantic-comedy fantasy Kate & Leopold (2001), the action-horror film Van Helsing (2004), the drama The Prestige and The Fountain (2006), the epic historical romantic drama Australia (2008), the film version of Les Misérables (2012), and the thriller Prisoners (2013). His work in Les Misérables earned him his first Academy Award nomination for Best Actor and his first Golden Globe Award for Best Actor - Motion Picture Musical or Comedy in 2013. In Broadway theatre, Jackman won a Tony Award for his role in The Boy from Oz. A four-time host of the Tony Awards themselves, he won an Emmy Award for one of these appearances. Jackman also hosted the 81st Academy Awards on 22 February 2009.\n\nJackman was born in Sydney, New South Wales, to Grace McNeil (Greenwood) and Christopher John Jackman, an accountant. He is the youngest of five children. His parents, both English, moved to Australia shortly before his birth. He also has Greek (from a great-grandfather) and Scottish (from a grandmother) ancestry.\n\nJackman has a communications degree with a journalism major from the University of Technology Sydney. After graduating, he pursued drama at the Western Australian Academy of Performing Arts, immediately after which he was offered a starring role in the ABC-TV prison drama Correlli (1995), opposite his future wife Deborra-Lee Furness. Several TV guest roles followed, as an actor and variety compere. An accomplished singer, Jackman has starred as Gaston in the Australian production of \"Beauty and the Beast.\" He appeared as Joe Gillis in the Australian production of \"Sunset Boulevard.\" In 1998, he was cast as Curly in the Royal National Theatre's production of Trevor Nunn's Oklahoma. Jackman has made two feature films, the second of which, Erskineville Kings (1999), garnered him an Australian Film Institute nomination for Best Actor in 1999. Recently, he won the part of Logan/Wolverine in the Bryan Singer- directed comic-book movie X-Men (2000). In his spare time, Jackman plays piano, golf, and guitar, and likes to windsurf.\n\nBritish actor Clive Owen is one of a handful of stars who, though he is best known for his art house films, can handle more mainstream films with equal measures of grace and skill. Owen is typically cast as characters whose primary traits are a balance of physical strength, intellect, conflicting soul but forceful will. He is best known to film audiences for his work in Children of Men (2006), Hautnah (2004) and his breakout part in Der Croupier (1998).\n\nBorn in Coventry, in England's West Midlands county, on 3 October 1964, Owen is the fourth of five brothers. He is the son of Pamela (Cotton) and Jess Owen, a country and western singer. His father abandoned the family when he was three years old, and Owen was subsequently raised by his mother and stepfather. He attended Binley Park Comprehensive School and joined the youth theater at 13 after playing the scene-stealing role of the Artful Dodger in a production of \"Oliver!\"\n\nActing was not his first choice as a profession, but he changed his mind and went on to graduate from the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in 1987. Owen proceeded to join the Young Vic Theatre Company, where he honed his craft while performing in a number of Shakespearean productions.\n\nClive made his film debut in the British-made Vroom! - Ab in die Freiheit (1990) co-starring with David Thewlis as two fellows who restore a classic American car and take off on the road. Within two years, Clive became a full-fledged TV star playing devilish rogue Stephen Crane in Chancer (1990). However, the now-sought-after Clive abandoned the star-making part at the height of the show's popularity because of unwanted invasion of privacy and his fear of typecasting. His next project raised more than a few eyebrows when he filmed Schließe meine Augen - Begehre oder Töte mich (1991) in which he played a brother who acts on his incestuous desires for his older sister. Clive's reputation as a lovable shyster was completely shattered and he lost profitable commercial endorsements following the film's release. Offers fell off for the next two years as a result. But the persistent Clive carried on with stage work, including the role of a bisexual in a production of Noël Coward's \"Design For Living.\" He returned to TV at that time as well and played a number of roles in both mini-movies and series.\n\nIn 1997, Clive had a huge hit on the London stage with \"Closer,\" a cynical, contemporary ensemble piece about relationships. Controversy surrounded him again in the film role of Max in Bent (1997) playing a brash, reckless homosexual lothario in decadent pre-war Germany who finds unconditional love while interned in a Nazi war camp. His biggest film break, however, was in Mike Hodges' Der Croupier (1998), as a struggling writer-turned-casino employee who gets in over his head with a femme fatale scam artist. English audiences stayed away in droves but the U.S. embraced the film and Hollywood took notice of Clive, who was virtually unknown outside of England. Despite playing detective Ross Tanner in a series of successful \"Second Sight\" mini-movies and finding critical acclaim on stage with \"The Day in the Death of Joe Egg\" in 2001, Clive has focused primarily on film, including the offbeat Brit romantic comedy Greenfingers - Harte Jungs & zarte Triebe (2000), the classy and popular Robert Altman period piece Gosford Park (2001), the Matt Damon star-vehicle Die Bourne Identität (2002), and the title role in King Arthur (2004). He has since reached the top rungs of the Hollywood ladder with the film version of his stage smash Hautnah (2004), in which he received an Academy Award nomination and won both the Golden Globe and BAFTA awards for \"Supporting Actor.\" He also had noteworthy roles opposite Denzel Washington in Inside Man (2006); and Julianne Moore and Michael Caine in Children of Men (2006), as well as handling a few biopics, playing Sir Walter Raleigh opposite Cate Blanchett's Elizabeth I in the film Elizabeth - Das goldene Königreich (2007) and Ernest Hemingway (Emmy nomination) in Hemingway & Gellhorn (2012) also starring Nicole Kidman.\n\nMore recent films include starring roles in The International (2009), Duplicity - Gemeinsame Geheimsache (2009), The Boys Are Back - Zurück ins Leben (2009), Trust - Blindes Vertrauen (2010), Intruders (2011), Blood Ties (2013), Last Knights - Die Ritter des 7. Ordens (2015), The Confirmation (2016) and Anon (2018). He also played Claudius in a retelling of \"Hamlet\" per Ophelia's perspective in Ophelia (2018); and played in support to Will Smith in the sci-fi thriller Gemini Man (2019).\n\nOwen is married to former actress Sarah-Jane Fenton, who played Juliet to his Romeo at the Young Vic in 1998. The couple has two daughters.\n\nRobert Peter Williams was born in Stoke-on-Trent, on February 13th 1974, to his mother: Jan and father: Pete. Robbie attended Mill Hill Primary School, followed by St. Margaret Ward's Roman Catholic School in Tunstall. At secondary school he became labeled as mischievous and a jester and subsequently left with no GCSEs. He participated in several school plays, and his biggest role was that of the Artful Dodger in a production of Oliver!He achieved fame when at 16 he became the youngest member to join the all-male group 'Take That' after responding to an advertisement. Now, a true British superstar with over eighty million records sold worldwide, Robbie Williams has won more BRIT Awards than any other artist in history and is the best-selling British solo artist of all time. His twelve number one UK albums, alongside a plethora of world records, including selling the most tickets (1.6 million) in one day, highlight his enormous success as both a live performer and recording artist. This year has been another huge one for Robbie: as well as writing the music to the acclaimed new musical 'The Boy in the Dress' with Guy Chambers and Chris Heath, he also completed his first ever sold-out Las Vegas residency, played a triumphant sold-out show to 65,000 fans at Hyde Park in London and will release his first Christmas album 'The Christmas Present' on 22nd November. Robbie is a lifelong football fan and is the co-founder of the Charity football event 'Soccer Aid' which has raised over £30m for UNICEF, providing help for children in danger around the world.\n\nA Golden Globe winner and Emmy nominee, Dylan McDermott has proven his talent in film, television, and theater. He was born Mark Anthony McDermott in Waterbury, Connecticut, to Diane (Marino) and Richard McDermott. Diane was 15 and Richard was 17 when Dylan was born. Richard earned money by hustling pool. Dylan is of Italian (from his maternal grandfather), Irish, English, and French descent. During Dylan's early years, his parents separated. In 1967, when Dylan was five, his mother was murdered by her live-in boyfriend. The murder was initially ruled an accidental shooting occurring while her boyfriend cleaned his gun, but police reopened the case in 2012 and revealed evidence showing it was impossible for her death to be have been accidental. Dylan and his sister Robin, who was then six months old, were taken in by their grandmother, Avis (Rogers) Marino.\n\nWhen Dylan was 15, his father met and married playwright/activist Eve Ensler. Eve adopted Dylan. Eve encouraged him to go to acting school and Fordham University in New York City. He met his now ex-wife, Shiva Rose, at a coffee shop in Venice, California, on the same day he got a big acting break by being cast in the film In the Line of Fire: Die zweite Chance (1993) with Clint Eastwood. As a result of his connection with Eastwood, Dylan attended a dinner honoring Clint. There, he met Jeffrey Kramer, a man who used to frequent a bar where Dylan had earlier worked. Kramer was, at that time, the president of David E. Kelley Productions. He asked Dylan to meet David E. Kelley for a then-upcoming series about lawyers, Practice: Die Anwälte (1997), and the rest is history. The series earned him a Golden Globe in 1999 and nominations in 2000 and 2001, as well as an Emmy nomination in 1999. Another mentor of Dylan is Joanne Woodward, who discovered him while he was doing workshops at the Neighborhood Playhouse.\n\nHis film credits include The Messengers (2007), by the Pang brothers (link=nm0659380 and link=nm0161152); Wonderland (2003); Familienfeste und andere Schwierigkeiten (1995); Magnolien aus Stahl - Die Stärke der Frauen (1989); Hamburger Hill (1987); Das Wunder von Manhattan (1994); In the Line of Fire: Die zweite Chance (1993); and Burning Palms (2010).

The play follows an uncomfortably married Upper West Side couple. Additionally, in September 2006, McDermott was on stage in Eve Ensler's new play \"The Treatment.\" Ensler's play explored the relationship between a traumatized former military interrogator (McDermott) and his psychologist colonel, who is assigned to give him routine treatment. The play opened the Impact Festival 2006, a New York City-wide arts festival as part of the Culture Project. McDermott was nominated for a Drama League Award for his performance.\n\nMcDermott appeared on television in the first season of Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk's FX drama American Horror Story (2011), opposite Connie Britton and Jessica Lange.\n\nMcDermott co-starred in Jay Roach's comedy Die Qual der Wahl (2012), opposite Will Ferrell and Zach Galifianakis. McDermott played Tim Wattley, a political consultant who runs the campaign of a candidate from North Carolina. The Warner Bros. film was released on August 10, 2012. That year, McDermott was also seen in the indie coming-of-age drama Vielleicht lieber morgen (2012), alongside Logan Lerman (McDermott played Lerman's character's father), Emma Watson, Paul Rudd, Ezra Miller, and Mae Whitman.\n\nIn 2013, McDermott had a supporting role in Antoine Fuqua's Olympus Has Fallen - Die Welt in Gefahr (2013), alongside Aaron Eckhart and Gerard Butler. The film followed a former Secret Service agent who becomes America's only hope when the President is taken hostage by terrorists.\n\nMcDermott's additional theatre credits include Neil Simon's production of \"Biloxi Blues\" on Broadway and \"Golden Boy,\" directed by Joanne Woodward at the Williamstown Theater Festival.\n\nBorn in Scotland, trained at the Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama where he was named most promising drama student.

He is also set to star in The Silencing, a thriller directed by Anders Engstom.\n\nAlthough Coster-Waldau is not religious, like the vast majority of Danes, he was baptized and confirmed as a Lutheran in the Danish National Church during his youth and viewed his confirmation as a big moment in his life when he first identified as becoming an adult. He married Nukâka, a Greenlandic actress and singer, in 1998, and they live in Kongens Lyngby with their two daughters as well as two dogs. Their daughter Filippa has starred in a Danish short film, The Girl and the Dogs, which was shown at the Cannes Film Festival in 2014.

He is the younger of two brothers. His father, named Ivan Banadinovic, came from Zagreb, Croatia, and worked as a manager for Caterpillar Inc. His mother, named Eleanor Banadinovic, came from a German family and was a hairdresser.\n\nYoung Bana grew up in suburban Melbourne. He was popular among his schoolmates for his talent of making comic impressions of his teachers. At that time, he was fond of Mel Gibson in Mad Max (1979) and also decided to become an actor. He moved to Sydney and worked odd jobs to support himself. In 1991, he began a career as a stand-up comedian, while working as a barman at Melbourne's Castle Hotel. In 1993, Bana made his television debut on Steve Vizard's Tonight Live with Steve Vizard (1990) talk show, then joined the Full Frontal (1993) TV-series. He gained popularity for making impressions of Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sylvester Stallone, Tom Cruse and \"Columbo\". In 1996, he started his own show titled Eric (1997), then launched a comedy series titled The Eric Bana Show Live (1997). The show was canceled for the lack of substantial audience. However, in 1997, Bana received the Logie Award for \"Most Popular Comedian\" for his work on The Eric Bana Show Live (1997).\n\nHe made his film debut in My Home Is My Castle (1997), in a supporting comic role. That same year, he was cast to portray Mark \"Chopper\" Read, the notorious Australian underworld figure. For the role, Bana gained 30 pounds, by eating junk food; he also spent a few days with Read in prison, in order to perfect his mimicry. Bana completely transformed himself into a bald, plump, disturbed criminal. He would arrive on the film set at four in the morning, spending several hours in makeup, being tattooed exactly like Read. Chopper (2000) became an international success and won three Australian Film Institute Awards. Bana won the Best Actor at the 2000 Stockholm Film Festival and also the AFI 2000 Best Actor Award. Then he co-starred in Black Hawk Down (2001), then starred in Hulk (2003). In 2002, he was cast as the Trojan Prince Hector in the historical epic Troja (2004), after being recommended by Brad Pitt, who admired Bana for his work in Chopper (2000).

Of royal stock, he is of primarily English, Scottish, and Irish ancestry with a dash of German and Dutch thrown in for good measure.\n\nEverett grew up in privileged circumstances, but the wry, sometimes arrogant intellectual was a rebel from the very beginning. At the age of seven, he was placed into the care of Benedictine monks at Ampleforth College where he trained classically on the piano. He was expelled from the Central School of Speech and Drama in London for clashing with his teachers and instead apprenticed himself at the avant-garde Glasgow Citizen's Theatre in Scotland, performing in such productions as \"Don Juan\" and \"Heartbreak House.\" He moved from stage to British TV in 1982 with sophisticated appearances on such series as \"Strangers\" \"Play for Today\" and \"The Agatha Christie Hour\" and the more visibly seen mini-series Princess Daisy (1983) and Palast der Winde (1984).\n\nIn 1984, Everett filmed a leading gay role in the acclaimed collegiate-themed picture Another Country (1984), which he had performed earlier on stage in 1981. Earning a BAFTA nomination and shooting to international attention, Rupert became one of England's hottest crossover stars. Top patrician roles in quality films came his way such as Dance with a Stranger (1985) opposite Miranda Richardson and Duet for One (1986) starring Julie Andrews and Alan Bates. The rebel went international instead of Hollywood, however, with top-billing in the Aussie feature Was vom Leben übrigbleibt (1986) with Hugo Weaving; the Italian-made Chronik eines angekündigten Todes (1987) and the French drama Tolérance (1989) opposite Ugo Tognazzi.\n\nAgain, however, the wickedly sharp and suave actor doused his own star fire by clashing with the press and even his own fans in the late 1980's. In 1989, Everett openly and proudly declared his homosexuality which put an initial damper on his status as a romantic leading man. Appearing sporadically in such featured roles as the Prince of Wales in the majestic drama King George - Ein Königreich für mehr Verstand (1994) and Lord Rutledge in the family comedy Dunston - Allein im Hotel (1996), Rupert's popularity was re-energized after playing Julia Roberts' gay confidante to droll effect in the box-office comedy hit Die Hochzeit meines besten Freundes (1997), earning him both BAFTA and Golden Globe nominations. He continued to impress thereafter, notably in such classical-styled pieces as Shakespeare in Love (1998) (as Christopher Marlowe), Ein Sommernachtstraum (1999) (as Oberon), and the Oscar Wilde plays Ein perfekter Ehemann (1999) (as Lord Goring, Golden Globe nominee) and Ernst sein ist alles (2002) (as Algy). On the lighter, fun side, his predilection for mischief was demonstrated as the cartoonish villain Dr. Claw, the nemesis of Matthew Broderick's title character, in Inspektor Gadget (1999).\n\nInto the millennium, Rupert continued to be a vibrant presence on stage with a tour of \"Private Lives\" (in Italian) in 2008, a 2009 Broadway revival of \"Blithe Spirit\" (his New York debut) and as Henry Higgins in Shaw's \"Pygmalion\" in Munich the following year. He went on to play Oscar Wilde in \"The Judas Kiss\" in 2013 and was about to play George on Broadway in \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\" when the play closed before it officially opened due to the COVID pandemic in 2020. On TV, he played the effortlessly suave Sherlock Holmes in Sherlock Holmes - Der Seidenstrumpfmörder (2004), the Marquis de Feron in the British series Die Musketiere (2014) and Carroll Quinn in a second British series Nur für Erwachsene (2020).\n\nOn film, Everett enhanced the royal dramas To Kill a King (2003) and Stage Beauty (2004) as King Charles I and King Charles II, respectively. Known for his aloof handsomeness and often smug, piss-elegant characters, he engagingly portrayed a jet-setter in the contemporary film People (2004); provided the voice of the unprincely Prince Charming in the animated features Shrek 2 - Der tollkühne Held kehrt zurück (2004) and Shrek der Dritte (2007); played a British defector opposite Sharon Stone in the romantic thriller A Different Loyalty (2004); a millionaire playboy involved in a hit-and-run in Geliebte Lügen (2005); an eccentric tycoon in In guten Händen - Oder die Geschichte der Erfindung des Vibrators (2011); King George VI (father of Queen Elizabeth) opposite Emily Watson's Queen Mum in the romantic dramedy A Royal Night - Ein königliches Vergnügen (2015); a monsignor in If I Had a Heart (2013); and tortured gay playwright Oscar Wilde during his last days in The Happy Prince (2018), which he wrote and directed.\n\nA novelist on the sly with Hello, Darling, Are You Working? (1989), Rupert has also published two volumes of memoirs: Red Carpets and Other Banana Skins (2006) and Vanished Years (2012), produced documentaries .\n\nSamuel Henry John Worthington was born August 2, 1976 in Surrey, England. His parents, Jeanne (Martyn) and Ronald Worthington, a power plant employee, moved the family to Australia when he was six months old, and raised him and his sister Lucinda in Warnbro, a suburb of Perth, Western Australia.\n\nWorthington graduated from NIDA (Australia's National Institute of Dramatic Art) in 1998 at the age of 22. He received critical acclaim for his portrayal of \"Arthur Wellesley\" in his first professional role in the Belvoir Street Theatre production \"Judas Kiss\" (directed by Neil Armfield). He then went on to work in Australian television on such shows as Water Rats - Die Hafencops (1996) and \"Backburner\" and then on the American TV show J.A.G. - Im Auftrag der Ehre (1995)'s 100th episode (Boomerang: Part 1).\n\nWorthington made his film debut in the highly acclaimed Australian movie Bootmen (2000), a film about a troop of \"tap dogs\". Minor roles proceeded in Das Tribunal (2002) and A Matter of Life (2001) before he was cast in another hailed Australian drama, Dirty Deeds (2002), co-starring Toni Collette and John Goodman.\n\nThe following year, he starred in yet another Aussie film, opposite David Wenham in Gettin' Square (2003). The director of the film, Jonathan Teplitzky, originally tested actors who were up to 8 years older than the then-27-year-old Worthington. Teplitzky wasn't sure Sam \"could convincingly play a tough guy and also have elements of the leading man about him\", but in the end Teplitzky decided he was \"fantastic\", and had \"David playing the older, slightly more streetwise accomplice\" proclaiming \"it worked\".\n\nBut it wasn't until 2004 that Sam got his big break. He was offered the starring role in Cate Shortland's acclaimed Australian drama Somersault - Wie Parfum in der Luft (2004), opposite Abbie Cornish. The film made a clean sweep of the Australian Film Institute awards in 2004, winning in 13 film categories - the first time this has ever occurred in the award's history. Worthington also won the AFI award for Best Male Actor.\n\nWorthington's career took off internationally when he was cast as Jake Sully in James Cameron's Avatar - Aufbruch nach Pandora (2009) and as Marcus Wright, a cyborg who assists the humans despite their suspicions of him in Terminator: Die Erlösung (2009). Worthington soon became a household name, and starring in high profile films Kampf der Titanen (2010), Eine offene Rechnung (2010), Texas Killing Fields - Schreiendes Land (2011), Ein riskanter Plan (2012), and Zorn der Titanen (2012). Worthington also provided the voice for the Call of Duty: Black Ops video games.\n\nIn 2010, Worthington started a production company, Full Clip Productions, with two of his close friends John Schwarz and Michael Schwarz. The company teamed with Radical studios to print two graphic novels Damaged and Patriots.\n\nGerard James Butler was born in Paisley, Scotland, to Margaret and Edward Butler, a bookmaker. His family is of Irish origin. Gerard spent some of his very early childhood in Montreal, Quebec, but was mostly raised, along with his older brother and sister, in his hometown of Paisley. His parents divorced when he was a child, and he and his siblings were raised primarily by their mother, who later remarried. He had no contact with his father between the ages of two and 16 years old, after which time they became close. His father passed away when Gerard was in his early 20s. Butler went on to attend Glasgow University, where he studied to be a lawyer/solicitor. He was president of the school's law society thanks to his outgoing personality and great social skills.\n\nHis acting career began when he was approached in a London coffee shop by actor Steven Berkoff, who later appeared alongside Butler in Attila - Der Hunne (2001), who gave him a role in a stage production of \"Coriolanus\" (later, Butler played Tullus Aufidius in a big screen Coriolanus (2011). After that, Butler decided to give up law for acting. He was cast as Ewan McGregor's character \"Renton\" in the stage adaptation of Trainspotting. His film debut was as Billy Connolly's younger brother in Ihre Majestät Mrs. Brown (1997). While filming the movie in Scotland, he was enjoying a picnic with his mother near the River Tay when they heard the shouts of a young boy, who had been swimming with a friend, who was in some trouble. Butler jumped in and saved the young boy from drowning. He received a Certificate of Bravery from the Royal Humane Society. He felt he only did what anyone in the situation would have done.\n\nHis film career continued with small roles, first in the \"James Bond\" movie, Der Morgen stirbt nie (1997), and then Russell Mulcahy's Talos, die Mumie (1998). In 2000, Butler was cast in two breakthrough roles, the first being \"Attila the Hun\" in the USA Network mini-series, Attila - Der Hunne (2001). The film's producers wanted a known actor to play the part but kept coming back to Butler's screen tests and decided he was their man. He had to lose the thick Scottish accent, but managed well. Around the time \"Attila\" was being filmed, casting was in progress for Wes Craven's new take on the \"Dracula\" legacy. Also wanting a known name, Butler wasn't much of a consideration, but his unending tenacity drove him to hounding the producers. Eventually, he sent them a clip of his portrayal of \"Attila\". Evidently, they saw something because Wes Craven präsentiert Dracula (2000) was cast in the form of Butler. Attila's producers, thinking that his big-screen role might help with their own film's ratings, finished shooting a little early so he could get to work on Wes Craven präsentiert Dracula (2000). Following these two roles, Butler developed quite a fan base, and began appearing on websites and fancasts everywhere.\n\nSince then, he has appeared in Die Herrschaft des Feuers (2002) as \"Creedy\" and Lara Croft - Tomb Raider: Die Wiege des Lebens (2003) as \"Terry Sheridan\", alongside Angelina Jolie. The role that garnered him the most attention from both moviegoers and movie makers, alike, was that of \"Andre Marek\" in the big-screen adaptation of Michael Crichton's novel, Timeline (2003). Butler played an archaeologist who was sent back in time with a team of students to rescue a colleague. Last year, he appeared in Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical, Das Phantom der Oper (2004), playing the title character in the successful adaptation of the stage musical. It was a role that brought him much international attention. Other projects include Lieber Frankie (2004), Das Spiel ihres Lebens (2005) and Beowulf & Grendel (2005).\n\nIn 2007, he starred as Spartan \"King Leonidas\" in the Warner Bros. production 300 (2006), based on the Frank Miller graphic novel, and Spiel mit der Angst (2007), co-starring Pierce Brosnan and Maria Bello, which aired on network TV under the title, \"Shattered\". He also starred in P.S. Ich Liebe Dich (2007), with Academy Award-winner Hilary Swank.\n\nIn 2007, he appeared in Die Insel der Abenteuer (2008) and RocknRolla (2008), and completed the new Mark Neveldine / Brian Taylor film, Gamer (2009). His next films included Die nackte Wahrheit (2009), co-starring Katherine Heigl, which began filming in April 2008, Der Kautions-Cop (2010), Drachenzähmen leicht gemacht (2010), Mavericks (2012) and Olympus Has Fallen - Die Welt in Gefahr (2013). In recent years, he has appeared in films such as Gods of Egypt (2016), Geostorm (2017), Criminal Squad (2018), Keepers - Die Leuchtturmwärter (2018) and Hunter Killer (2018). Butler is related to writer-director Mark Flood."
