        "text": "Theater Alumni\n\nA B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z\n\nJonathan Abel '54\n\nJonathan's varied career includes a 22-year career in the military (LtCol, USMCR, Ret.). While stationed in Okinawa, Jon felt fortunate to guide author and Wesleyan Historian in Residence William Manchester - a fellow Marine - around the island. They remained friends until Bill's death. Jon worked as the assistant to Bob Ludlum '52 at The North Jersey Playhouse during its run and for more than 10 years, Jon was a member of the Alexandria Harmonizers, a 120-man championship barbershop chorus that won four gold medals in international competitions. He is currently doing a fair amount of background acting and industrial and training films and has done extensive role playing for the DC Capitol Police and the US Secret Service, the FBI and the US Army Medical Simulation Center at Walter Reed.\n\nAlice Ahn '04\n\nAlice's interests have shifted away from theatre to early childhood development (focusing on gross motor skills). She is working with Jonah's Treehouse, an enrichment center for children up to four years old, in Washington DC.\n\nMerry (Alderman) Ritsch '01\n\nMerry is currently in her third season as the local Casting Director for The Shakespeare Theatre Company in Washington, D.C.

Previously, she was a casting associate for Francine Maisler Casting at Sony Pictures in Los Angeles.\n\nArwen Anderson '96\n\nLast fall, Arwen worked with Bill Pullman on a great show called Expedition 6 at the Magic Theatre (as did John Behlmann, who also went to Wes). Bill Pullman wrote and directed the piece, which centered on three astronauts who were stuck in the International Space Station during the time of the Columbia disaster. Arwen was in the San Francisco company of the off-broadway, award-winning, forever-running I Love You, You're Perfect, Now Change. She also played the lead role in the feature film Hog Island, which shot all around the Bay Area. It got massive festival exposure and got picked up for distribution, and it is now on Netflix. She was in the world premiere of the late John Belluso's Rules of Charity at the Magic Theatre and is therefore listed in the published script. Some of her other favorite experiences have been playing Dawn in Lobby Hero by Kenneth Lonergan at the Aurora Theatre Company (Bay Area Critics Circle Nomination) and playing Jenny in The Shape of Things by Neil LaBute, also at the Aurora. She has also started training in aerial circus at the San Francisco Circus Center, and she now performs professionally on trapeze and aerial silk. She recently started teaching both at the school. Arwen is about to go into Tech as the lead in Melissa James Gibson's west coast premiere ofCurrent Nobody (Wes grad Molly Aaronson-Gelb is producing), and in a few weeks, she starts rehearsals for the World Premiere of Peter Sinn Nachtrieb's T.I.C. Once that opens, she'll start working on Steve Yockey's West Coast Premiere of Skin. All three of these playwrights are amazing young talents who are about to break out (or already have) on the national scene.\n\nCameron Anderson '98\n\nCameron is a scenic designer for theater and opera in NYC and around the country.

He pursued an acting career for a number of years in New York, but he discovered that he was more interested in writing than acting, so he began to write plays. He was lucky to have most of his plays produced at various venues across the country, and eventually, one of his plays came to the attention of an executive with Touchstone Television. After selling Touchstone a pilot far a half-hour TV show, he moved to Los Angeles. There, he embarked on a full-time career in TV writing and producing, working primarily on sitcoms, but gradually sliding over to one-hour shows.

He has turned toward applying theater techniques to scientific challenges in the pharmaceutical world and remains active, writing and directing for community theater. \"I still vividly remember some of Bill Francisco's masterworks at Wes, which were instrumental in luring me away from mathematics (the seemingly more practical choice) toward theater (the ultimately more rewarding choice in figurative and literal senses!).\"\n\nSivan Battat '15\n\nSivan is currently working as the Artistic Apprentice at Studio Theatre, a mid-sized regional theatre in Washington, DC.

He received his M.F.A. from the Yale School of Drama Technical Design and Production Department in 1995. From 1995 to 2006, he was the Director of Design for Show Motion Inc. located in South Norwalk, CT, where he managed 75+ projects in ten years of employment. The projects took him from basic theatrical scenery design into architectural theming, retail environments, and restaurant interiors; to helping create AC2, Show Motion's proprietary automation system; and to installing of mechanical effects and automation systems on a dozen Broadway productions. He was the project manager for Jane Eyre, a groundbreaking Broadway production that suspended a 55,000 lb. steel carousel in the stage house, which rotated and carried another 22 automated axes.\n\nIn 2006, Jonathan started his own venture: Spinnaker Production Services, whose main client was Show Canada, a large scale fabrication shop in Montreal, Quebec.

Sean is also a stage combat teaching assistant at Pace University, Brooklyn College, and Muhlenberg College.\n\nWilliam Christopher '54\n\nI'm probably Wesleyan's oldest working Theater major, unless Jon Abel ties me. We were both class of '54 (we were roommates our freshman year in North College) and there weren't many before that. After college I went to New York, worked off-Broadway, then on Broadway, then TV. Of course I'm best remembered for my eleven years on M*A*S*H (as Father Mulcahy), but life goes on and that was a long time ago. That big hit gave me the chance to do a lot of regional theater, however. In Spring 2012 I did \"On Golden Pond\" for a North Carolina theater and my latest venture is playing Father Tobias on \"Days of Our Lives.\" It's my first time on a soap and quite a change from series television.\n\nI can't help but mention what a debt Wesleyan owes to Ralph Pendleton who got the Theater major started. I think what I learned in those days of '92 glory stayed with me.\n\nBrian Cimmet '95\n\nSince graduating from Wesleyan with a double major in Theater and Music, I have been working primarily as a pianist and conductor for musical theater, covering many bases from Broadway to regional theater to Europe to whatever else I can find.\n\nOver the past year, I worked on two Broadway productions -- The Drowsy Chapersoneand Grease. In regional theater, I conducted and played piano for productions ofJesus Christ Superstar (Maine State Music Theatre), A Year with Frog and Toad(Dorset Theatre Festival) and Show Boat (North Shore Music Theatre, for which I also wrote new orchestrations).\n\nI've been fortunate enough from time to time to get work as a composer and arranger. Two musicals I wrote received their premiere productions in 2007 -- Absolutely Anything was produced by November Ten Productions in Illinois and The Spirit of Reindeer bowed at the University of Southern Maine. In 2004, I served as part of the creative team assembled to premiere a lost Frank Loesser musical called Senor Discretion Himself. I wrote all new arrangements for the score, as well as reconstructed some songs Mr. Loesser never completed.\n\nIn the world of non-musical writing for the stage, I was a multiple award winner at the One-Page Play Contest, a private competition in New England for short scripts. My plays The Von Trapp Family Reunion and Clams: The Musical (neither was actually a musical, truth be told) were Best Play winners (in 1997 and 2000). In non-theatrical writing, I have also had essays published by two internet magazines (Grumble Magazine and The Subway Chronicles), and I am currently in the final stages of completing my first novel.\n\nOther than all that, I am an active member of the BMI Musical Theater Workshop, a group I've been part of for the last decade, and I live in New York City.\n\nClaire Conceison '87\n\nClaire Conceison (BA with honors in Theater and East Asian Studies) is currently Quanta Professor of Chinese Culture and Professor of Theater Arts at MIT. After Wesleyan and graduate work at Harvard (AM 1992) and Cornell (PhD 2000), she taught at University of Michigan, UC Santa Barbara, Tufts, and Duke before MIT. She is a scholar of contemporary theater in mainland China, a translator of plays from Chinese and French into English, and a director. She is author of three books, Significant Other: Staging the American in China (2004) and Voices Carry: Behind the Bars and Backstage during China's Revolution and Reform (2009), and I Love XXX and Other Plays by Meng Jinghui (2017), as well as a monograph Ballade Nocturne by Gao Xingjian (2010). While at Wesleyan, she founded the student theater group AACT (Asian and Asian American Cooperative Theater).\n\nAndrea Corney '83\n\nI've taken a few skips and jumps in my career and although it may not look like it from the outside, what I learned at Wesleyan is still with me. Right out of Wesleyan I worked in theater management both in New York and Vermont. I took a detour to law school, business school and corporate law, before ending up as an organizational behavior consultant and teacher. Today I am a Leadership Coach at Stanford Graduate School of Business. I facilitate interpersonal skills learning groups and coach students on team and leadership skills. In my theater days we often talked about \"the use of self as an instrument\" and in my current work, that is still the bedrock. Every day I rely on my ability to listen, collaborate, and respond \"in the moment.\" I'm often up in front of a room, projecting my voice and my intentions. In my teaching I am focused on experiential learning and creating a cohesive emotional journey for participants. Kind of like theater! Twenty-five years later I'm still grateful for my Wesleyan education.\n\nBob Craft '76\n\nFor the past 21 years, Bob has been a location manager in feature films and television. He is currently the location manager on Kath & Kim, which shows Thursday nights on NBC. This past October, he won an award as Location Professional of the Year for being part of the Eagle Eye location department.

Bill Francisco was his thesis advisor at Wesleyan, and has been a great, positive influence in his life.\n\nJonathan Deull '79\n\nSince graduating with a theatre degree focusing on directing and design, I have been a show business maid-of-all-work with a short attention span.\n\nI have worked in various theatrical production capacities in and out of my native New York and my home of twenty-five years, Washington, DC. I currently serve as a member of the Performing Arts faculty and Director of Production at a high school in Washington, DC, where I am discovering that teaching is harder than doing. My freelance work includes directing, set and lighting design, and stage management.\n\nA member of IATSE since 1979, I am ETCP certified rigger (Theatre) with a special expertise in aerial performer flying, including circus rigging. I do rigging system design and consulting, and teach aerial rigging courses around the country. In addition, I spend part of my time as Executive Vice President of my family’s theatrical transportation business, Clark Transfer.\n\nOther (non-theatre) gigs have included serving with Save the Children (USA) and other international NGOs, as well as directing and producing television and video documentaries on development and conflict resolution in more than twenty countries in Africa, Asia and Europe. I am qualified as an attorney and as a commercial pilot (ASEL, Instrument) who flies volunteer missions for Angel Flight. I have been married since 1981 to Sheryl Sturges (’79), whom I met the first week of freshman year on the grass behind Olin Library. We have two grown children, one of whom is a professional circus aerialist.\n\nJeremy Dobrish '90\n\nLast Season Jeremy directed Inner Voices: Solo Songs (Zipper), Spain (MCC),Election Day (Second Stage), The Underwear Musical (NYMF) and Beautiful Souls(The Becket) all Off Broadway.

Wes alum visitors are always welcome!\n\nMatt Earp '01\n\nI live in Oakland, CA, having recently completed a Master in Information at UC Berkeley. I've been studying communities of musicians and their communication practices both on and offline and have produced musical events with a theatrical edge since I left Wesleyan - first with Howard Goldkrand '92 as part of the Soundlab organization in New York, and now as part of a group called Surya Dub here in the Bay Area.

In the mid '80s she designed and project-managed a performing arts space known as the Dinosaur Space in downtown Boston. she began studying architecture part-time at the Boston Architectural Center which led to an interest in combining lighting skills with architectural consulting and resulted in a move to NYC where she worked as a theatre consultant with Artec Consultants. A longing to return to lighting design work brought her to a position as a designer and project manager in a full range of lighting projects with Fisher Marantz Renfro Stone from 1987-1997 consulting on such jobs as The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, The Chicago Title Building and The Phoenix Art Museum.

A tech guy rather than one who appeared on stage, I still find the skills I learned from theater to be invaluable. Perhaps the most important is something lived rather than taught: the show must go on. Theater taught me the necessity of making something happen when its time has come. You schedule a performance, and no matter what happens, whether or not it's your own fault or choice, you make that performance happen. The experience of theater taught me this very important real-life rule. Today, I am the co-host of The New American Dream Radio Show on BlogTalkRadio, so I'm finally doing a little of the performance myself. I also run our studio, so I'm exercising some of that tech stuff too.L\n\nLauren Bloom Hanover '01\n\nLauren joined Profile Theatre in Portland, Oregon two years ago as the Director of Education and Community Engagement.

She enrolled in the Syracuse University College of Law in the Fall of 1990, to study Intellectual Property (IP) and Entertainment Law. After earning her J.D. in 1993, Robin went to work for the Connecticut firm of Day, Berry & Howard (now Day, Pitney) in their General Commercial Litigation and Technology and IP Law Groups at the Hartford office. While at the firm, she belonged to a local theater group called \"Off the Record,\" made up of all attorneys, which performed shows at the University of Hartford to benefit the Connecticut Legal Aid Society. In 1999, she left the firm to become IP counsel at LEGO Systems, Inc. (the American headquarters for the LEGO Toy Company, which has its international headquarters in Denmark). Two years ago, Robin transitioned from doing IP work to handling general corporate legal affairs, and as of July 1, 2008, she became General Counsel for the Americas division. Robin definitely credits her theater training at Wesleyan for providing her with the presentation skills and the confidence to build her legal career. She now travels extensively around North America, Mexico and Europe for work, and most of her contact with the theater is seeing as many shows as she can locally, and in NYC. She lives in West Hartford with her husband and her son - who just turned ten and is quite the singer and actor. Perhaps another Wesleyan theater major in the making?\n\nHarold Sogard '74\n\nHarold spent the first ten years of his post-Wesleyan life doing theater management in Connecticut, Chicago, and New York, where he served as Company Manager, General Manager, and Managing Director for a mix of non-profit and commercial companies, both off Broadway and on Broadway. He worked on some shows that were big hits, but also on several that opened and closed on the same night.\n\nUltimately he grew bored with life between shows at \"Club 90\" (the name given by his fellow theater professionals to the NY State Unemployment Office then located on West 90th Street in Manhattan) and decided it was time to get a \"real\" job. So in 1984 he became the World's Oldest Assistant Account Executive at the New York office of ad agency Ogilvy & Mather. In 1991 he joined Goodby, Silverstein & Partners in San Francisco, where he now holds the glorified title of Vice Chairman. Over the past several years GS&P has won every top creative award in the world of advertising, and was recently named Agency of the Decade by AdWeek magazine.\n\nThe last time Harold directed a play was in 1976 at NYC's La Mama ETC; he harbors pipe dreams of someday picking up where he left off then -- perhaps once he's done paying high school and then college tuition for his daughter. In the meantime, he is very grateful for all he learned from his Wesleyan theater teachers and classmates, and he's proud to be a small part of this distinguished cast list of Wesleyan theater alumni/ae.\n\nAndrew Spear '90\n\nAndrew has spent the bulk of his time juggling theater, writing, and teaching.

Thoroughly turned off of education (to the point of vowing to \"unschool\" her own children should she ever have them) she turned to her passion for film and photography and spent the next few years building a body of work and learning Photoshop, Indesign, and Final Cut Pro at Parsons, assisting photographers and making little documentary projects, etc. She now runs a boutique photography studio in NYC (Sarah Tew Photography), shooting mostly weddings, portraits, and documentary projects as well as the occasional band photo shoot.

(HHP), the not-for-profit organization that owns and operates an 1878 rural opera house in the tiny Village of Cambridge, NY as a community art center. When it was formed in '78, the Hall had been closed for 50 years. Benjamin identified strongly, he says, with the \"he\" he found in a quip from a 1920's newspaper that went: \"The owner of Hubbard Hall received a telegram from the manager of a traveling theater company that said, 'Company will arrive on Tues. on the 11:45 train. Stop. Have electricians, carpenters, stage manager, stage hands, costume mistress, and house manager ready. Stop.' The owner wired back, 'O.K. Stop. He'll be there. Stop.'\" Over the past four years, having come a long way since that time, Hubbard Hall has grown from being one great old opera house to being a campus made up of the Hall and three adjacent freight yard buildings purchased and renovated to add a dance studio, a visual arts classroom, rehearsal spaces, a new black-box theater, office space and more.\n\nLily Whitsitt '06\n\nLily Whitsitt is founding artistic director of Door 10 performance group and a director and producer of theater and film.
