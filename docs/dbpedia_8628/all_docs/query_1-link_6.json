        "text": "If you love puppets, comedy, musicals and the theatre then you will love Idiots Assemble Spitting Image the Musical which is showing at Phoenix Theatre for a limited run.\n\nWhat is Spitting Image though you might be asking. Well Spitting Image is a show which originally aired on British television back in 1984 which is a puppet show. The puppets are caricatures of public figures, celebrities, the government, and the Royal Family. It was created by Peter Fluck, Roger Law and Martin Lambie-Nairn.\n\nFor over 18 series it was aired on ITV. At its peak, the show was watched by 15 million people. The series was so popular it even had collaborations with musicians. The show also was nominated and won numerous awards, including ten BAFTA Television Awards, and two Emmy Awards back in 1985 and 1986 in the Popular Arts Category. Sadly though in 1996 it was cancelled as viewing figures started to decline. After many years though with a few bumps along the way Spitting Image returned to our TV screens October 2020 with new puppets and plenty of laughs for a short stint.\n\nNow Spitting Image is back and LIVE at the Phoenix Theatre after having a 5 star sell out run at Birmingham Rep, where you can now go along and actually see this hilarious puppet show musical in real life, which are controlled by professional puppeteers on stage.\n\nI went along to the press night of Idiots Assemble Spitting Image the Musical courtesy of Avalon marketing.\n\nIdiots Assemble Spitting Image the Musical\n\nSpitting Image The Musical is presented by Avalon, and originally produced at Birmingham Rep where it had a hugely successful run.\n\nIt is written by a comedy team made up of Al Murray, Matt Forde and double-Olivier award winner Sean Foley, who also directs, alongside a creative team spearheaded by the original Spitting Image co-creator, Roger Law.\n\nThe voice overs are pre-recorded by a stellar line-up of artists from Oliver Chris (Green Wing, The IT Crowd, and Prince William in Charles III on Broadway and on film) Kathryn Drysdale (Bridgerton, The Windsors, Christmas on Mistletoe Farm, The Bubble, The Queen and I and Plebs), Jason Forbes (The Tracy Ullman Show, The Mash Report and Horrible Histories: The Movie and Borg Mcenroe), Luke Kempner (Spitting Image, Steph’s Packed Lunch, The Last Leg, Stand-up Sketch Show and The Imitation Game), Lorna Laidlaw (Doctors, Coronation Street, Getting It Straight and A Midsummer Night’s Dream), Jackie Lam (Strangers, All that Remains and Emma) Shri Patel (Rishi Sunak in This England, Emmerdale and Pennyworth), Jess Robinson (Spitting Image, The Last Leg, Stars in Their Ears, and The Rise and Fall of Little Voice and Britain’s Got Talent), Debra Stephenson (The Impressions Show, Dead Ringers, Rich Hall’s Election Breakdown, Newzoids, Coronation Street and Bad Girls) and Ronan Summers Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom and Krays: Code of Silence, Doctor Who and Episodes).\n\nThe talented puppeteers who bring the puppets to life are Antony Antunes, Rianna Ash, Katie Bradley, Emily Essery, Kaidan Dawkins, Bertie Harris, Pena Iiambo, Jackie Lam, Bright Ong, Will Palmer, Helen Parke, Rayo Patel, Tom Quinn, Richard Vorster and Faye Weerasinghe.\n\nEveryone else that works on Idiots Assemble Spitting Image the Musical are as follows:\n\nProduction Designer, Alice Power, Video Designer Nina Dunn for Pixel Lux, Lighting Designer Tim Mitchell, Sound Designer Richard Brooker, Puppet Master Scott Brooker, Costume Designer Lotte Collett, Choreographer Lizzi Gee, Composer and Musical Director Alexander S. Bermange, Music Supervisor Jerome van den Berghe, Creators of Spitting Image Peter Fluck and Roger Law, General Manager Emma Brunjes for ebp, and Producers Richard Allen-Turner and Jon Thoday for Avalon.\n\nIt first opened up in Birmingham Rep early in the year and was a 5 star sell out performance. It now has come to London Phoenix Theatre for a limited run (Wednesday 24 May to Saturday 26 August 2023).\n\nThis extravaganza musical is simultaneously inspired and appalled by real events with a little make believe moments as it see the Government in particular Boris Johnson trying to steal the crown from King Charles as Boris wants to be King, plus see Tom Cruise as you have never seen him before.\n\nSpitting Image says it all\n\nI and my husband Jason we went along to Idiots Assemble Spitting Image the Musical press night 14 June 2023.\n\nBefore heading on I watched as celebs was snapped but what took my eye was the Rock.\n\nI just had to have my photo with him. Just look. However sadly the Rock never featured in the musical on stage.\n\nThe whole theatre has many posters dotted around the place.\n\nDo you recognise these?\n\nI then went in and had a pre theatre drink of Corona before heading ot my seats in dress circle row J which I was gifted.\n\nI usually only like sitting in the stalls as I am not keen on watching a 2 hour journey from a height but I was quite impressed by the view you actually get.\n\nThe musical centres mainly on the government and the Royal Family. It is a story which see Boris Johnson wanting the crown from King Charles as he wants to be King. With that King Charles creates his very own Magnificent Seven of celebrity misfits to save the nation from Boris taking his crown and all the other dark usual suspects.\n\nThe Magnificent Seven is selected via Tom Cruise and his panel by having a talent gameshow which is hosted by Ant and Dec. Once the Magnificent Seven was put together it was then up to Tom and his gang to help protect King Charles and his crown from Boris and other villains. To see who is part of the Magnificent Seven and who is on Boris side you’ll just have to go and watch the show, you’ll be shocked and guarantee you will be in stiches.\n\nThere’s jokes, songs and dancing galore.\n\nComing out of the theatre I got interviewed for my opinion and I basically said it is a great play full of laughs if you love anything to do with politics, government and The Royal Family. If it makes it to the cutting room floor we will see. If it does I will post a it here. Watch this space…\n\nBoris Lockdown Party invite\n\nAfterwards I went along to Boris lock down party which was held at Bunga Bunga.\n\nHere I met a few two the puppets Coronie (Corona Virus) and Chris Whittey. I shook Chris hand and even kissed Coronie. To see click here to TikTok.\n\nPlus I met the actual man himself, not a puppet Al Murray.\n\nThe party was amazing with Bunga Bunga themed throughout from the door going in looking like N0 10 Downing Streets doorway, to the decor within from toilet rolls, signs stating keep your distance, syringes but not filled with medicine but alcohol and so much more. It was like taking a time warp back to covid times.\n\nPlus throughout the night I got to enjoy a variety of covid themed cocktails which were all equally as delicious, even some came in syringes and even got to eat a variety of Bunga Bunga pizza all which was delicious. Check out my post on Bunga Bunga when I went along many months back and had a proper sit down and even made pizza there myself.\n\nWas a fab end to the night.\n\nVerdict\n\n‍What I loved about this musical and mick take on the Royal Family and in particular the government is what we all mostly think think about them, that they all have not a clue at times.\n\nIdiots Assemble Spitting Image the Musical got me in stiches at most parts throughout with the very little Tom Cruise darting around everywhere, Donald Trump stumping around in his orange prison uniform, Boris yearning to be King and King Charles having tea with a very strange looking Paddington. However as much as it was fun I do feel that some scenes went on a bit too long and I wish it did not centre entirely around Boris wanting the crown and The Royal Family. It would of been great to seen a lot more celeb puppets from pop groups and actors from movies. Plus I did not understand why have Harry and Megan watch from a royal box on stage. I think it would have been more humorous to have some other celebs within boxes making comments throughout the show.\n\nI wish afterwards that there was a chance to meet some of the puppets even if there was a fee I would certainly pay as to have my photo with a few as the caricature of these puppets are incredible.\n\nSo if you love puppets, singing, dancing and having a laugh you’ll love Idiots Assemble Spitting Image the Musical.\n\nHowever please note the show is known for its irreverent and often crude humour and is not afraid to take aim at anyone, regardless of their status or reputation so please bear that in mind. Plus the puppets are figures of well known people but are often exaggerated making them look slightly grotesque, but that is to add to the overall comedic effect.\n\nIdiots Assemble Spitting Image the Musical at the Phonenix Theatre book now\n\nPhoneix Theatre\n\nCharing Cross Road\n\nLondon\n\nWC2H 0JP\n\nWatch as an all-star cast of over 100 puppets, come to life on stage.\n\nWatch as Tom Cruise as he helps King Charles save the nation from Boris and other evil forces throughout this fun filled show full of jokes, music and dancing.\n\nLimited run from Wednesday 24 May to Saturday 26 August 2023.\n\nBook now via ATG Tickets tickets start from £25.00.\n\nThank you to Avalon press for a night full of laughs. All views are my own honest opinion.\n\nIdiots Assemble: Spitting Image The Musical is presented by Avalon, and originally produced at\n\nBirmingham Rep where it had a hugely successful run.\n\nFor further information and interview requests please contact\n\n‍\n\nRunning Time\n\nApprox. 2 hour with an interval\n\n“"
