        "text": "British musical comedy band\n\nThe Horne Section is a British musical comedy band,[1] appearing sporadically on radio, television, podcast, and stage. Led by frontman and comedian Alex Horne, the band comprises Joe Auckland (trumpet/banjo), Mark Brown (saxophone/guitar), Will Collier (bass/guitar), Ben Reynolds (drums) and Ed Sheldrake (keys). The band specialises in comedy/spoof songs[2] in a variety of genres.[3][4] The band is made up of professional musicians, including two childhood friends of Horne, and first performed together in May 2010,[5] with the current line-up finalised during 2012. The Horne Section have performed at the Edinburgh Festival,[6] as well as touring the UK,[7] and celebrity guests at their shows have included Harry Hill, Simon Amstell, Jimmy Carr, Tim Minchin, Josie Long, Al Murray, and John Oliver as well as musicians including Neil Hannon[8] and Suggs.[citation needed] Their BBC Radio 4 series – Alex Horne Presents the Horne Section – ran for three series from 2012 to 2014. The band have also released five albums.\n\nThe band featured in The Horne Section Christmas, a nine-minute Christmas-carol themed TV special, shown on Sky Arts in 2015.[9] In April 2018 they recorded a two-hour live show at the London Palladium entitled The Horne Section Television Programme, featuring celebrity guests including Sue Perkins and Nadine Coyle, and broadcast on Dave on 24 May 2018.[10][deprecated source][11] A Channel 4 six-part programme The Horne Section TV Show was released on 3 November 2022, and is a mostly scripted comedy about the band, combining elements of musical comedy, talk show and sitcom.[12][13]\n\nHorne and the band have often appeared on 8 Out of 10 Cats Does Countdown as the dictionary corner guest, and chaired Never Mind the Buzzcocks in November 2012. The Horne Section were the 'house band' for The Last Leg of the Year on New Year's Eve 2018,[14] 2019,[15] 2020 and 2021, where they contributed backing music as well as playing a number of their own songs. They provided music for The Last Leg: Locked Down Under and Peter Crouch: Save Our Summer in 2020 and joined Crouch again in 2021 for Crouchy's Year-Late Euros: Live. The band created the theme music for Horne's Taskmaster, as well as for The Guardian's cricket podcast The Spin.[16]\n\nThe Horne Section Podcast has run since 2018. It was in the top 10 most streamed podcasts from the Deezer platform in 2018,[17][18] and in April 2019 it was nominated in the 'Best Comedy' category of the British Podcast Awards.[19] The podcast has featured a range of guests including comedians (Greg Davies, Roisin Conaty, Sara Pascoe, Nish Kumar, Adam Buxton), presenters (Richard Osman, Susie Dent, Angellica Bell), sportspeople (Chris Hoy, Lizzy Yarnold), performance poets (Rob Auton, Tim Key, Scroobius Pip), and musicians (Jessie Ware, David Arnold, Robbie Williams).[20]\n\nAlbum discography\n\n[edit]\n\nThese albums (and the single \"Grandaddy\") are distributed by the group's Bandcamp page. The third album was released on 5 June 2020 featuring songs from the isolation podcasts.

Each episode introduces a celebrity guest as an assistant to etymologist Susie Dent in 'dictionary corner'. Alex Horne was previously a guest on the main Countdown programme in 2008, and as the author of a book on 'Wordwatching' was a strong candidate for the role. More unusually, he brought his backing band, and The Horne Section contributed various comedy song (and dance) items to the show, as well as stylistic parodies of the 30-second Countdown music.\n\nThe Horne Section have appeared in a number of episodes (with one appearance as Rachel Riley's assistants) over the course of the show, listed below with reference to the 8 Out of 10 Cats Does Countdown episodes page. The saxophonist 'Pedro' (Pete Grogan) appeared where shown as a deputy for one of the wind players.\n\nEpisode First broadcast Teams' guests Members Music items 9 12 Sep 2013 Lee Mack / Bob Mortimer, Adam Hills Joe, Ben, Will only Countdown music, Drum and Bass, Samba Countdown, Hillbilly Countdown, Bagface, Jazz Countdown 25 12 Sep 2014 Trevor Noah, David Baddiel / Joey Essex (Dictionary Corner) Regular members Is It the Police?, Ragtime Countdown, Disco Countdown, James Bond Countdown 27 29 Dec 2014 Kathy Burke, David Baddiel Regular members No-L, Carols Countdown, Macarena, Henry Hoover, Original Lyrics Countdown 39 19 Jun 2015 Vic Reeves, Lee Mack / Sara Pascoe Regular members Your Love Keeps Lifting Me Hiya, Eggypop, German Drinking Countdown, CABBAGE 40 26 Jun 2015 Bob Mortimer, Sarah Millican / Katherine Ryan Pedro (for Mark) I Ain't Got No Story To Tell, Salsa Countdown, Baker Street, Benny Hill Countdown, Trumpet Magic 49 28 Aug 2015 Sara Pascoe, Josh Widdicombe / Alex Brooker Pedro (for Mark) Background music, Brown-Eyed Girl, Ska Countdown, Children's Instrument Countdown, Zumba 55 5 Feb 2016 Isy Suttie, Richard Osman Regular members Scotland advert, Film Themes Countdown, Mexican Countdown, Lovely Day, Bottles Countdown, Seasons 69 15 Oct 2016 Victoria Coren Mitchell, Lee Mack / Bob Mortimer Pedro (for Joe) I've Got Something to Tell You, Sexy Countdown, Tense Jenga music, Caveat Clauses, Chris Hoy Loves a Saveloy 91 22 Sep 2017 Jason Manford / Joe Wilkinson, Lee Mack / Fay Ripley Regular members Wannabe, Five Quiz Countdown, French Countdown, Fly Me To The Moon (Ping Pong), Medieval Countdown, YMCA 102 17 Aug 2018 Richard Ayoade, Jessica Knappett Pedro (for Mark) Imagine All the Extra Notes, Future Countdown, Money's Too Tight to Mention 120 9 Jan 2020 Harry Hill, Rose Matafeo Regular members Abbreviated Songs, Gong Jazz Countdown, You Can Leave Your Hat On, The Coot or the Moorhen, I Scratched My Arse\n\nThe Horne Section Television Programme (2018)\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Horne Section Television Programme was a two-hour special show recorded for UKTV in front of a live audience at the London Palladium on 18 April 2018.[21] The show was subsequently broadcast on 24 May 2018 on the Dave channel.[22] The show featured a number of guests performing with the band including Sara Pascoe, drag singer Le Gateau Chocolat, Nadine Coyle, Joe Wilkinson and Sue Perkins. The programme interspersed the live performance with supposed studio rehearsal footage in which Horne berates the band for their ability and refuses to allow certain songs to be part of the show.\n\nMusic featured Your Love Keeps Lifting Me Hiya, Is It The Police?, Sara Pascoe: The Musical, Caveat/Mistake Music, Macarena, All By Myself/Nessun Dorma (with Le Gateau Chocolat), The Promise (with Nadine Coyle), Henry Hoover, Chinese Five Spice, Seasons, Acronym Song, This Is What It's All Been For (with Sue Perkins),You Can Leave Your Hat On, The Day I Forgot My Underpants, Less Is More\n\nThe Last Leg: Locked Down Under (2020)\n\n[edit]\n\nThe band appeared in a regular guest slot to close each show of this special series of The Last Leg,[23] originally shown on Fridays at 10pm on Channel 4 during May–June 2020.[24] Though the show was broadcast live from the homes of the hosts in Britain and Australia and via livestream with the individual guests, each member of the band pre-recorded their musical and visual contributions which were combined into a music video. The songs chosen were variously new podcast material, parody, and reworked previous podcast material.\n\nEpisode First broadcast Song featured 1 8 May 2020 Blessings 2 15 May 2020 7 Days 3 22 May 2020 Time Wasting 4 29 May 2020 I Miss People 5 5 June 2020 Summer Banger (2020)\n\nPeter Crouch: Save Our Summer (2020)\n\n[edit]\n\nThe eight-part BBC series Peter Crouch: Save Our Summer was planned during the time of Coronavirus isolation to \"bring the biggest names from the worlds of sport, comedy and music back into our lives\" for summer 2020.[25] It features Peter Crouch, Maya Jama, and Alex Horne and The Horne Section, with a range of sporting and entertainment guests,[26] and was aired on BBC One during Saturday evenings during June–July 2020. The Horne Section contributed various programme jingles and parody songs, including a closing song of appreciation for some of the \"unsung heroes\" of the lockdown period.\n\nCrouchy's Year-Late Euros: Live (2021)\n\n[edit]\n\nCrouchy's Year-Late Euros: Live was a late-night entertainment chat show, aired on BBC1 during the UEFA Euro 2020 championships. It featured Peter Crouch, Maya Jama, and Alex Horne and The Horne Section.[27] The band provided music, including various football-related parody songs.\n\nThe Horne Section TV Show (2022)\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Horne Section TV Show is a self-referential comedy about The Horne Section, combining elements of music mockumentary, chat show and sitcom.[28] Mostly scripted (by Alex Horne), the show also includes elements of improvisation, including in the scenes when the band are shown in rehearsal.[29] Songs from the band's repertory are presented both as integral plot devices and as featured music videos, and there is incidental music composed by members of the group (usually pianist Ed Sheldrake).\n\nThe plot shows Horne's attempts to create a successful TV vehicle for the band, leading out of the backstage world of his TV series Taskmaster, where he is frustrated with being regarded as a mere assistant.[30] Alex Horne and the band members play exaggerated versions of themselves (along with Greg Davies and John Oliver), while other actors (including Desiree Burch, Georgia Tennant, Camille Ucan, and Tim Mahendran) play fictional supporting roles.[31] Celebrity guest(s) are invited to the 'chat show' portion as part of the scripted drama. The programme exploits the meta-referential quality of having a nested 'show' with the same name as itself, and makes playful use of devices such as narration, captions, reverse-filming, ironic discrepancies between the fictional 'show' and reality, ambiguities in diegetic music, a crowd-sourced dance sequence, and social media reviews of itself. The first series was released on 3 November 2022, and was broadcast on Channel 4 from 17 November 2022.[32] On 9 January 2023 the show received a nomination at the Comedy.co.uk Awards 2022 in the Best New Sitcom category.[33]\n\nEpisode First broadcast Main music Guest(s) 1 17 Nov 2022 Taskmaster theme, Chinese Five Spice, Guess Who (instrumental) Greg Davies 2 17 Nov 2022 Grandaddy, The Coot or the Moorhen Martin Kemp, Anneka Rice 3 24 Nov 2022 I Am Funny, Alpha Bravo Charlie Delta, Is It the Police Ranj Singh 4 24 Nov 2022 The Man who Lives on My Street, Chaka Demus and Pliers, Hear the Word (Ed), Donkeys are Pricks Big Zuu 5 1 Dec 2022 One Lump or Two, Manure Industry, I Miss People Imogen Heap 6 1 Dec 2022 Being With You, Hear the Word (Joe), What About the Children Tim Key\n\nThe Horne Section Podcast\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Horne Section Podcast is a musical comedy show featuring The Horne Section and hosted by Alex Horne. Each show features a 'one-person special guest audience' at the recording, typically someone from the world of comedy, music or television.[34] Episodes feature comic songs from Horne and the band, including some about (and/or involving) the guest themselves, as well as music-themed games and comedy.\n\nSeries 1 (2018)\n\n[edit]\n\nThe first series of eight weekly episodes was broadcast in early 2018 and produced in association with the web-based streaming service Deezer.[35] The podcast was listed in the top 10 most streamed podcasts from the Deezer platform in 2018[36] and named in The Week’s best new podcasts of 2018 list.[37] ('Bonus content' was available in a separate Deezer track for each episode, and any musical bonus content has been listed below after a semicolon.)\n\nGuest First released Music featured 1 David Arnold 23 Jan 2018 Radiator Wisdom, The Problem with Musical Comedy, David Arnold Song, The Adventures of Orf (The Library), Grief; Four Tomatoes, Jungle Boogie 2 Richard Osman 30 Jan 2018 If I Were, Richard's Rhyming Tweets, Your Days Are Numbered, Oh Richard!, Chinese Five Spice, Ignition (cover), Scottish Widows, What About the Credits; What About the Children 3 Adam Buxton 6 Feb 2018 Taskmaster (French version), Pepper Army, Things I Haven't Done Yet, Less is More 4 Susie Dent & Lou Sanders 13 Feb 2018 At Home with The A-Team, The Night the Cat Brought Me a Swan, Dent & Lou (Thesaurus Song), Our Manifesto, Pancake Day, Thick & Creamy; Top Trumps 5 Tim Key 20 Feb 2018 Su Pollard, Hope (I Found a Hat), My Favourite Hat Has Flowers On, Car Horn, So Many Names, Goodbye Tim Key, People People 6 Jessie Ware 27 Feb 2018 Autotune, CABBAGE, English Food, Alone, Alex Horne is Dead, Translation Station (Ave Maria), A Smile Will Push the Hurt Away; Burt Bacharach 7 Rick Edwards 6 Mar 2018 Dog Discrimination, Anusol, Rick Edwards Song, Record Player; Why Did You Become a Vegan, Flo the Baker 8 Roisin Conaty 13 Mar 2018 Bouncer from Neighbours, Roisin Roisin, Lorry Guy, Sticky Situation, Happy Accident, Alpha Bravo Charlie Delta, Thick & Creamy, Royal Wedding, How to Brush Your Teeth, The Hardness of Water; Tequila, Midnight\n\nSeries 2 (2018–19)\n\n[edit]\n\nThe podcast returned for a double second season in October 2018, running on a fortnightly basis until June 2019. No longer with Deezer, the show was funded by listener donations through Patreon,[38] often in exchange for a specially-written 'dingle' about the contributor (interspersed among the other podcast items) or shorter 'holler' in a regular song. Along with regular guest episodes, special episodes were released for pre-Christmas, Boxing Day, and Pancake Day.

Although a break in transmission had previously been announced, the first episode appeared only a week after the last of the scheduled episodes of series 4. Episodes were recorded with the band members connected by video link from their own homes, interspersed with clips from a prior telephone call to the guest and pre-recorded songs. Distinctive features of the series include songs put together by individual musicians, musical quizzes by the pianist, and a prominent use of incidental music to underscore conversations.\n\nGuest / show First released Music featured 1 Tim Key 25 Mar 2020 Hear the Word (Joe), Negative Music, Joan Armatrading, Savvy, Pam Ayres Eats Pom Bears, I Smell a Rat, I Smell a Rat (club mix) 2 Tim Key 9 Apr 2020 Peppa Pig, Manifesto (for the Isolation), I Themed a Theme, The Man from the North (consequences song), Boum (translation), One Lump or Two, Hear the Word (Alex), Newton's Laws, Last of the TV Theme Tunes 3 Max Rushden 22 Apr 2020 Road Safety (Rubber Knickers), The Warm Up on Talksport with You, Rockingham Cindy, There Ain't No Binman (Mark), Three Hundred Thousand and Thirty Four Nine Hundred and Seventy-Four Thousand, What a Wonderful World, Ambient Music, In Your Back Garden (Rushden), Hidden MPs, Shreds, Phobias, (Ca)Puccini Music 4 Robbie Williams 6 May 2020 Blessings (Lard Arse), Yes Today, The Tetris Diet, The Angry Chef Song, Thought of the Day (Facial Bones), Hear the Word (Ed), Hat Mancock, Angels (Williams), Thought of the Day (The Fly) 5 Rose Matafeo 20 May 2020 Spool Fools, Rose's Taskmaster song, Jokes jingle, Crossed Wires, If Drummers Were Musicians, Kids Say the Funniest Things, I Miss People, Hear the Word (Ben), Misty Spring Morning, Honk Oi Wah, Do Go Br My He, Thought of the Day (The Nearness), Oi Honk Squeak Honk\n\nSeries 6 (2020)\n\n[edit]\n\nThe next series of The Horne Section Podcast was announced by Alex Horne on Twitter on 30 September 2020.[43] The numbering of the series was initially left ambiguous in the band's Patreon post of 1 Oct 2020, where it is referred to as \"SERIES 5 (? OR 6?)\",[44] but has now been confirmed there to be Series 6 (retroactively making the Isolation Specials officially Series 5 of the podcast). A darker quality was discernible: new regular features included a cover version of any song chosen by the guest for their funeral, the setting of a surreal lyric composed by the guest saying words in alternation with Alex, and a segment that purported to rifle through the contents of celebrities' rubbish bins.\n\nGuest / show First released Music featured 1 Reggie Watts 4 Nov 2020 I Ain't Got No Legs, What is in Your Rubbish Bin (David Gower), Reggie's Looping Thing, Poirot, Good Life, You've Got the Lovejoy, Tailwhip 2 Mae Martin 11 Nov 2020 When I Needed a Neighbour, Potaconuts, Bidding on a Cup on eBay, What is in Your Rubbish Bin (Bruno Tonioli), Bleak Midwinter in the Sky, Three Old Dogs 3 Mark Watson 18 Nov 2020 Time v Persons, On the Bouncy Castle (Watson), Warning: Gross Material, I'm Always Seeing You Do Cool Stuff (Watson), Chat Back, What is in Your Rubbish Bin (Miley Cyrus), There's a Light, They Went in a Car, Town Called Malice 4 Hank Green 25 Nov 2020 Butcher Song, Taskmistress, Lingo Bingo, A Song About an Anglerfish (Green), The Best Thing Ever (Palmer), Chill Noir Jazz, I Am Funny, Born This Way, Uplifting Music, If You Want a Smaller Device 5 Tom Basden 2 Dec 2020 Dance Saxophone, Donkeys are Pricks, Lingo Bingo, A Whiter Barry of Pâté, The Ballad of Middle America, Dream a Little Rant, Champagne (Basden), I've Just Seen Mr Blobby (Basden), Ringpiece Phones, There's a Ghost in My House (Basden), Ecce Quid, Tom Basden He is Dead, Bleak Vamp, A Whiter Barry of Pâté (reprise) 6 Daisy May Cooper 9 Dec 2020 Drive On, Alex in Wonderland, Faece-Ease, The Raccoons Theme, MMMBop, What is in Your Rubbish Bin (Claudia Schiffer), Staple it to Your Favourite Duck, They're Coming to Take Me Away, The Legacy, The 2003 UFO, Flowers 7 Isy Suttie 16 Dec 2020 Low-Battery Mode, Garglebox, Waffle the Wonder Dog, Three Little Words, Finding Out About the Pianist, Sugar Spun Sister, I Ain't Got No Scruples 8 Rupert Gregson-Williams 23 Dec 2020 Joe's Trumpet, Coles' Law, Puns vs Synonyms, Hat Chat Riff, Jorge and Jesus (at Christmas), Bleak remix, ABBA Trumpet, A Hat Indoors, Treacherous Cretins, Tim Key versus the Band\n\nSeries 7 (2021)\n\n[edit]\n\nRecording of series 7 of The Horne Section Podcast was underway by 9 February 2021, as shown by a picture on the band's Instagram site.[45] Some guests were recommended or invited over Twitter, including comedian/musician Rachel Parris.[46] The series was recorded with the performers 'in isolation' (as with series 5–6), due to ongoing fluctuations in UK lockdown guidance.\n\nThe series began on 14 March 2021 with a one-off 'mash-up' combining the podcast with Romesh Ranganathan's music podcast Hip Hop Saved My Life for Comic Relief. A special visual episode livestreamed through Dice followed on 2 April.[47] The series ended without prior announcement at the sixth episode, a curtailed audio version of the Livestream special. Distinctive aspects of this series included songs by 'The Brothers Smooth', developments in the story of Alex's sighting of a UFO, and a continuing trend towards longer and more fully-developed 'dingles' for subscribers.\n\nGuest / show First released Music featured Bonus episode Romesh Ranganathan 14 Mar 2021 'Hip Hop Saved the Horne Section Podcast' special: Hip Hop Saved The Horne Section Podcast Theme Mashup, No Chairs, Forget About Adultery I'm Gonna Commit Upholstery, Mama Said Knock You Out, Garden Furniture remix 1 Jessica Knappett 24 Mar 2021 Yoga, Here I Am I’m a Violin (Knappett), Mysterious Piano Music, The Ballad of Mysterious Sightings, Tense Oboe Music, Animals Who Are Cleverer Than They Look, The Mighty Andrew Marr, What Willip Sends 2 Nina Conti 31 Mar 2021 Do You Remember Um Bongo, Arse Hand I, Mysterious Guitar Music, Drum rhythms advert, Let’s Piss Off to the Caesar’s Palace, Arse Hand II Livestream special Mike Wozniak 2 Apr 2021 No Flies, Jorge & Jesus (at the seaside), What is Sweep Saying, Roxanne (Sweep), Thick and Creamy (oompah band), Groupies, A UFO, Ja Ja Ding Dong, What’s in Your Trousers, Ten Million Henries 3 Rachel Parris 7 Apr 2021 Tony Blair, Love Triangle, Mushroom Stroganoff (Parris), Movie Quotes as Songs, Sea Shanty (Parris), What is a Melodica (Parris), Midnight Farts 4 James Acaster 14 Apr 2021 Midnight Feast, In Other Words, Over My Shoulder (Acaster), Cover Stories, Mumford and Sons, Dunker Ma Hunker 5 Ellie Taylor 21 Apr 2021 I Am a Prick, I Don’t Know Much, The Sensible Guy, At Least I Keep His Eyes in My Life, Massive Knee 6 Mike Wozniak 28 Apr 2021 musical content as Livestream of 2 Apr (except What's in Your Trousers)\n\nSeries 8 (2024)\n\n[edit]\n\nAfter a long break, the Podcast returned on 14 February 2024.[48] The band's Patreon page announced that they will no longer be recording or including listener-sponsored Dingles (a distinctive feature from Series 2 to Series 7) as these had become too time-consuming.[49]\n\nThe Podcast returns to the studio, in a 'snappy' format of 30-40 minutes, with no guests and a strong focus on the band. Along with a variety of original songs, there are a number of quizzes with themes, and the recurrent 'movie quotes as songs' feature first heard in series 7 (Rachel Parris episode). The series serves as a prelude to a major national tour of over 30 concert dates during 2024.[50]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
