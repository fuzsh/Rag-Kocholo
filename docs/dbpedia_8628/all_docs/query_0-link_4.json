        "text": "In the spring of 1993, I wrote an article for Life magazine on the trumpeter Wynton Marsalis. During our several interviews, Marsalis continually referred to a name that clearly meant a lot to him.\n\nHe had met Albert Murray in 1982, when Murray was sixty-six and Marsalis twenty, a precocious virtuoso in both jazz and classical music and a Juilliard dropout. He had left school in 1980, his second year, to go on the road with the Jazz Messengers, led by the great drummer Art Blakey.\n\nWithin a few months of reading and talking, Wynton knew that Murray was the most important teacher he would ever have. When they had met, Marsalis was only minimally aware of Murray as one of America’s seminal writers and thinkers on jazz. Murray gave his new protégé a copy of Stomping the Blues, his 1976 meditation on jazz, and the book upended Marsalis’s approach to the music, challenging him to go beyond playing unreflectively, “just playing,” as Marsalis said, into an awareness of his playing as part of a tradition.\n\nWynton began visiting Murray at the latter’s apartment, at 132nd Street and Lenox Avenue. At first their talk stuck to jazz, but Wynton soon learned that Murray’s interests extended far beyond music. Before long, Murray steered the naïve but intellectually eager young musician into literature, the visual arts, history, mythology, and elsewhere. The seminars lasted for years, well past Marsalis’s rise to superstardom.\n\nMurray and his wife, Mozelle, helped Marsalis in other ways, too. New Orleanians have it hard — they can move away for fifty years and still “miss home.” With his meager three years away from New Orleans, Wynton, still barely out of his teens, was often disconsolate. Gracious Alabamans, the Murrays saw to it that their young friend felt as downhome up north as a Crescent Cityite can.\n\n“I’d go up there almost every Monday,” says Marsalis. “You know how Alabama people are just like New Orleans people. Mozelle and I would sit and laugh, and she cooked me fried chicken and black-eyed peas. It was like being back at home with my grandma. It was like I was part of the family.\n\n“Murray loaned me a lot of books. I bought a lot, too. I read Thomas Mann’s Doctor Faustus and Joseph and his Brothers, Faulkner, and Hemingway. Constance Rourke’s American Humor,” which has the status of a bible with Murray. “That was one of the first things he made me read. John Kouwenhoven’s Beer Can by the Highway and Made in America — even though Kouwenhoven didn’t like jazz! One summer we went through Faulkner’s Light in August and Hemingway’s The Sun Also Rises. He had me read Heinrich Zimmer, Joseph Campbell — who’d been a friend of his — and other books on mythology. ‘Let’s work on the elements of Western thought,’” he would say. “So we did Greek and Roman logic and Christian philosophy. We’d go back to music. What styles, not just jazz, did people play in the Thirties? All kind of stuff about music. We would argue, too!”\n\nReading at home late at night, Wynton might be brought up short by a complex problem and phone Murray, a well-known night owl. “Come on up!” he would tell his protégé, “it’s all right about the time.” When Marsalis reached Murray’s, wearing sweatpants and what was not yet called a hoodie, he often found four or five books laid out.\n\nIn the early 1980s, a group of arts patrons and power brokers began to discuss expanding the city’s arts complex, Lincoln Center, to include a jazz program with its own building, concerts, staff, and resident ensembles. In 1987, Marsalis, only twenty-five, was appointed artistic director of what was christened Jazz at Lincoln Center.\n\nNot long before JALC was to open, Wynton began to have second thoughts about taking the artistic director’s job. “I had my band, we were working, I was making good money. Why should I leave my thing to go and work for some place that didn’t even exist? For no money!”\n\nIn an unexpected role — Zen master — Murray asked his protégé: “Do you understand the difference between going to someone’s house when you’re sick and going to the hospital? That is why you should do this.”\n\nI have never been able to follow that particular koan to enlightenment. Evidently, Wynton was. After all, he and Murray functioned at the same level: genius. Wynton took the job. He holds it today, almost thirty years later: he is jazz’s universally-recognized statesman, if often vilified for what his critics call an overcommitment to tradition. (That’s commitment, says Murray, not overcommitment.)\n\nBy the time he had taken Wynton’s education in hand, Al Murray had turned himself, against the odds, from a retired Air Force major into an increasingly well-known author. A career serviceman, he retired in 1962 and started writing full time, although he had quietly worked on stories and novels since the late 1940s. He and a close friend, meanwhile, engaged in sophisticated literary discussions throughout the 1950s. The friend was a man with some interest in books: Ralph Ellison. The two had known each other slightly in the mid-to-late 1930s as students at the Tuskegee Institute, in Alabama. They didn’t, however, start a decades-long friendship until the late 1940s, bumping into one another in Manhattan. In the 1960s, while Murray was excitedly getting his writing career off the ground, Ellison was more than a decade into what he refused to his death to admit was a failed effort to produce a follow-up to his great Invisible Man.\n\nForty-six is a dauntingly advanced age to kick off a literary career — or any career — but with the optimism, self-confidence, and mental toughness that had made him a success in every previous phase of his life — student, teacher, soldier — Murray was soon publishing stories and essays in some of New York’s most prestigious magazines and literary journals. Ellison, not by nature a generous man, made an exception for his compadre, introducing Murray to editors and seeing to it that he was invited to high-powered parties.\n\nMurray published his first, explosive, book, The Omni-Americans, in 1970. New in Manhattan’s literary world or not, he didn’t give a damn about pleasing critics. A loosely cobbled-together string of magazine articles and small-journal essays, The Omni-Americans added up to a scalding polemic ridiculing the perspectives on race of the day’s intellectuals, both white and black. Murray’s targets were guilty, he wrote, of what he called “social-science thinking”: abstract, overgeneralized systems for analyzing society, whose high status among academics betrayed their incapacity for grasping life’s complexity. The Omni-Americans was hardly in stores when Murray found himself just ahead of a posse of white liberals, black militants, white radicals, black moderates, and academics of both races. Infuriated, they took aim at this Johnny-come-lately. “A put-on,” fumed the veteran black historian J. Saunders Redding. “Nonsense!”\n\nShrugging off, and no doubt enjoying, all the noise, Murray bent to a new task, the autobiographical travelogue, South to a Very Old Place, which reviewers were to greet with a level of warmth equaling their hostility towards its predecessor. South is the book with which Murray’s reputation began its ascent in earnest. Published in 1971, it was assigned by The New York Times Book Review to Toni Morrison, then at the start of her own literary career. Murray’s book, Morrison wrote, was “nothing less than obligatory reading.”\n\n***\n\nMurray plans South To A Very Old Place — his “meandertale,” as he calls it, borrowing the word from Finnegans Wake — as a winding travelogue that will take him down the eastern seaboard, then inland to Atlanta (“Alana” to black Southerners), New Orleans, and Mississippi. Along the way, Murray will take time to colloquize with a string of white writers and intellectuals of progressive reputation. A second lap has a different agenda. Murray wants to explore the Alabama roots of his raising: Tuskegee, his alma mater; and Magazine Point, the tiny community where he grew up, just outside of Mobile.\n\nMurray has recently been stunned to come across a passage by the Yale historian C. Vann Woodward, one of the two or three greatest postwar American historians. Born and raised in east Arkansas, Woodward was a longtime renegade, a young radical in the ’20s and ’30s and a civil rights activist in the 1950s. The passage in question reads:\n\nI am prepared to maintain that so far as culture is concerned, all Americans are part Negro. Some are more so than others, of course, but the essential qualification is not color or race. When I say All-Americans, unlike Crevecoeur, I include Afro-Americans. They are part Negro, but only part.\n\nMurray’s sentiments to a T, as expressed in, for one, The Omni Americans: “American culture, even in its most rigidly segregated precincts, is patently and irrevocably composite. It is…incontestably mulatto.” To his delight, Murray has stumbled across a white intellectual brother whose words fly up from the South into Murray’s outstretched hand.\n\nSo off Murray goes, not southwards but eighty miles northeast, to Yale, a “veritable citadel of Yankeedom,” where the Southerner C. Vann Woodward nonetheless roosts, as does his fellow Southern don, Robert Penn Warren, the double-Pulitzer winner, novelist/poet/social commentator.\n\nAs Murray’s prior exposure to Woodward’s ideas has led him to expect, the Arkansawyer delivers the goods. If “pretty good” is Murray’s term of highest approval for Southern whites, Woodward is “better than ‘pretty good! One of the very best around and getting better all the time! But don’t take my word. Check him out for yourself!”\n\nAs impressed as he is by Woodward, Murray cannot shake the “kinship aginship problem,” as he calls it, the ambivalence he feels even for Southern whites he likes. He can barely help but imagine both Woodward and Penn Warren as “dried-up-assed rosum-chewing squint-eyed crackers.” In Murray’s mind’s eye, Woodward becomes a cracker switch-engine driver like the ones he knew as a boy, a skinny-necked peckerwood hollering at a flock of black youngsters to get off the back of his train: Say now by Gyard, get the hell and skedaddle offen that durn tyar dang bust you little possums. Dang bust you little possums. Dang bust you little possums.\n\nRedheaded Penn Warren, meanwhile, puts Murray in mind of Filling Station Red out of Mobile. But Murray knows he can’t omit the “kinship” part — he has read Warren’s 1965 study, Who Speaks for the Negro? and is close to admiring its pretty-goodness.\n\nAlmost before he knows it, Murray is below the line, surprised to find himself uneasy, belatedly recalling that the fondly remembered homeland is also the land where lynching is barely a thing of the past. For protection, Murray summons an old ally — Uncle Remus, the resourceful trickster, a “spinner of such yarns and the weaver of such nets as become meshes to catch the wind.” As Murray’s Alabama boyhood taught him, one of Remus’s many skills is outsmarting whites.\n\nSeveral encounters follow, but none that pique Murray’s interest until the distinguished novelist Walker Percy picks Murray up at his well-appointed New Orleans hotel. Murray’s “personal radar…which you rate second to none, registers Normal then Cordial then Welcome.” It’s settled, then: Murray tosses him into the “pretty good” bag, too. (For anyone who’s read The Moviegoer, Love in the Ruins, or Percy’s correspondence with Shelby Foote, Percy deserves better.)\n\n***\n\nBlack colleges clearly educated, stimulated and prepared generations of blacks for the lives they chose…to lead. Never mind the ‘better’ white schools, there is a pride-pure belonging, a supportive identity that black colleges seem to foster.”\n\n— Toni Morrison, New York Times Book Review, on South to a Very Old Place, January 2, 1972\n\nRalph Ellison loathed Tuskegee, and bolted after his junior year. His fictionalized portrait of the school in Invisible Man boils over with fury. Murray was a different case: he flourished here. If he started out engaged in his share of freshman shenanigans, it didn’t take him long to get serious, which in his case meant entering the world of the word. Murray’s passionate, lifelong engagement with Western literature began with the encouragement of the improbably named Morteza Drexel Sprague, the English Department chairman, though he was not much older than his students.\n\nSadly, Morteza Drexel Sprague died young. Murray’s delayed eulogy in South to a Very Old Place is as heartfelt a statement as he ever made. Sprague, he writes,\n\nis gone — too soon departed — forever. But the crucial if not definitive good fortune that is yours for having been a pupil in whom he took special interest is everlasting. Because such is the comprehensive generosity that all truly great teachers radiate as much outside as inside the classroom is that you will always rejoice at the mere fact that he was there when he was.\n\nWhenever Sprague introduced young Al to a master — Hemingway, Eliot, Kafka, and “and, best of all, Thomas Mann’s Joseph story,” he discussed the text carefully with his student. Clearly, it was Sprague — with his eagerness for his students, at least the best of them, to aspire to an intimacy with the full range of human accomplishment — who sparked Murray’s love of learning.\n\nAnd the road brings Murray home, to his old stamping ground on the northwest shore of Mobile Bay, less than forty miles north of the Gulf and adjacent to the city of Mobile: his home town, bite-sized Magazine Point. Except it’s gone, razed flat by the Scott Paper Towel Company to make way for a massive toilet-paper and paper-towel plant.\n\nComfortably settled in his Mobile hotel, Murray heads off to ramble around Magazine Point’s remains. Out come most of the few remaining townsfolk to welcome the native returned.\n\nMurray runs into an energetic bull session, where “some of the very oldest among the old heads from the old days are kicking around ‘the state of the nation’s political well-being.’” The oldest head launches into a monologue about a great big Southern white man:\n\n“Lyndon Johnson. Old Lyndon Johnson. They can call him anything but a child of God, and I still say old Lyndon Johnson, faults and all, Texan or not. Old Lyndon Johnson is the one that brought more government benefits to help us out than all the rest of them up there put together. He got up there in front of everybody and said ‘we shall overcome.’ Boy, that’s enough to scare white folks worse than the Indians.’”\n\nThe cracker’s everyday, elbow-rubbing intimacy with black folk led, in more cases than one, to empathy and a closeted respect. “Old Big Jim Folsom,” continues the oldest head, “ain’t never been nothing but an Alabama redneck,” yet he asked white northerners,\n\n“‘What y’all always running around scared of them for?’ He said, ‘they been right here amongst us all this time.’ He said, ‘I ain’t scared of them.….they got something coming to them like other folks.’ He said, ‘live and let live.’”\n\nIn other words, it was because of LBJ’s dyed-in-the-wool crackerness, not in spite of it, that he was ready, and knew just how, to do some good for the black man. First, he hired some:\n\n“‘Send me old Thurgill Marshall, for the Supreme Court, and HUD Secretary Robert C. Weaver. Then I’m going to put one up there with them millionaires on the Federal Reserve Bank to help me keep an eye on the money. I want him to be a real black one so they can’t say I just put old Thurgill up there because he’s damn near white!’”\n\nNot everyone was happy. An aide told LBJ, “Now, I’m just going to have to come right out and tell you, Mr. President, the big money folks up North getting nervous.”\n\n“And that’s when old Lyndon Johnson coming back with, ‘You go back and tell ’em I’m from down south so I’m kinda used to having them around me. Tell ’em I feel kinda lost if ain’t none of ’em around. Tell ’em they’ll get used to them in here just like they already used to them cooking and running the elevators.’\n\nSome mean-ass crackers on our side for a change, for whatever goddam reason.”\n\nIn September 1972, a year after South to a Very Old Place was published, Murray received an unusual letter. The sender was Jack Valenti, familiar to TV viewers as the short, white-coiffed fellow forever trotting onstage at the Oscars to address the best dressed. His real job was as president of the Motion Picture Association of America, a super-spokesman for the movie industry. But before Valenti was a player in pictures, he was one of LBJ’s most trusted consigliores, the president’s special assistant. After Johnson’s resignation, the two stayed close. Valenti often visited the LBJ Ranch, where one day he was fortunate to be the audience for a remarkable performance by his old boss. Valenti describes the episode in the letter to “Professor” Murray, in Valenti’s solecism. The message reads:\n\nMy Dear Professor Murray\n\nI thought you ought to know of an unusual experience I had recently that concerned you. While visiting President Johnson, he sat me down and read to me portions of your book SOUTH TO A VERY OLD PLACE. It was a fascinating and moving example of LBJ being caught up in a particular piece of prose and finding it totally to his liking. He read me that part of your book, beginning on page 176, in which the old black man relates his instinctual reaction to LBJ’s civil rights fight. It is hilarious, wise, perceptive, must reading for anyone.\n\nAt any rate, you should know that the President found what you wrote poetically and structurally, as well as emotionally, to his taste.\n\nSincerely, Jack Valenti\n\nSeeking Murray out and writing to him so warmly was a generous act on Valenti’s part. Meanwhile, a mystery remains. Who gave LBJ the book? We’ll never know; anyone who did has long since shuffled off.\n\n***\n\nMurray was quickly recovering lost time. Between 1970 and 1974, he published a book a year. The fourth, Train Whistle Guitar, was his first novel (despite his work’s several genres, Murray always considered himself a novelist). John Edgar Wideman, also writing in the Times Book Review, listed the “blend of historical insight, of folklore, of observed detail, the ear for speech, for irony, for contradiction and possibility that make Train Whistle Guitar a fascinating novel.” The evidence was mounting, even for white establishment critics, that this was a major prose stylist, a late representative of a species that had flourished from the mid-19th to mid-20th centuries: the man of letters, at home in the entire range of Western literature, and often beyond it.\n\nEveryone in Gasoline Point, Train Whistle Guitar’s setting, believes that high-spirited Scooter is destined for great things. The boy’s optimism, success (he’s an ace in school, though he barely tries), and self-assured first steps into adulthood add up to a refutation of the “Sambo Fallacy,” Murray’s acidic term for Northern white liberals’ demeaning view of blacks, especially Southern blacks, as having been pounded into servility, submission, unshakeable ignorance, and the lack of a Scooter’s pluck.\n\nAmbling into Train Whistle Guitar early on is the charismatic twelve-string guitarist, gambler, and sworn itinerant Luzana Cholly, looking picture-perfect in his “tailor-made black broadcloth boxback” and always-brand-new John B. Stetson hat, big twelve-string slung across his back and a .32–20 nestled in its underarm holster. Nobody has ever seen or heard Luzana practice, but he plays the strings off that guitar. Scooter and his best pal, Little Buddy Marshall, idolize Luzana, and study all of his mannerisms.\n\nDespite his lack of education, Luzana Cholly has an innate nobility (as well as conflicts nobody would have guessed at). One day, Scooter and Buddy decide to jump a boxcar on the L&N, the train Luzana hoboes on. When they get to the empty boxcar, an unsuspecting Luzana Cholly is already there.\n\n“‘Oh no you don’t oh no you don’t neither,’ he says, shocked to see the boys. “‘Because it ain’t like that…ain’t never been like that…..’” And ordering the boys to jump off, he walks them all the way back to Gasoline Point.\n\n“‘Then he put his hands on our shoulders,’ says Scooter, ‘and looked straight down into our eyes.’ Luze told them about being in prison and on the chain gang. But the main thing he wanted to talk about, Scooter recalls, was going to school and learning to use your head… ‘Make old Luze proud of you,’ he said then, ‘and he was almost pleading.’ ‘Make old Luze glad to take his hat off to you some of these days. You going further than old Luze ever dreamed of. Old Luze ain’t been nowhere. Old Luze don’t know from nothing.’”\n\n“‘ And then the train was there and we watched him snag it and then he was waving goodbye.’”\n\n***\n\nIn 1996, having read most of Murray’s books yet published, I decided to write about him. We spoke once or twice to arrange a meeting, and I liked the sound of the voice that came over the phone: low and southern-inflected, then almost high-pitched, his laugh a low chuckle.\n\nI drove in from the country, then down FDR Drive to 138th Street, then to 132nd and Lenox. Six brick buildings on the east side of Lenox made up Lenox Terrace, a middle-class apartment complex built in the late 1950s. Al, Mozelle, and their daughter, Michele, arrived in 1962.\n\nRinging their doorbell, I got no response, then, finally, heard movement inside. The chain was unfastened, the door swung open, and it was plain right away why it had taken Albert Murray so long to get to the door. He could hardly walk. Two spinal operations and severe arthritis, I would learn, had cruelly reduced his mobility. He used one of those four-pronged aluminum walkers, but not at the moment, and inched along, entirely focused on the task at hand: getting to where he was going.\n\nHis condition must have been maddening, but in my three-hour visit, he never complained. I did at times see him irritated, but this was for other reasons than his physical problems: impatience with interlocutors who didn’t think as speedily as he did — me, for instance — and an old man’s difficulty with handling dissent. But at bottom, when his speech grew querulous and his patience short, I’m sure that such behavior came mostly from being in permanent pain, “hard labor,” as Murray called it. I came to see his big, handsome grin as at least partly designed to show that bad luck and trouble would never get him down.\n\nMurray’s skin was a pleasant medium-brown. Below a nose that was slightly broader than aquiline was a small, neatly trimmed mustache. He was tastefully and semi-conservatively dressed, in a blue-and-white-striped Oxford and well-cut khakis Shaking hands, I caught the smell of first-class cologne. Murray’s smile was winning: appealingly crooked, crinkling the skin around his eyes into crow’s feet, the whole creating an empathetic, welcoming air. At eighty, Albert Murray was still a handsome man.\n\nIn the southeast corner of the living room was a tiny study, a converted breakfast nook whose expansive prospect had led to its name, “the spyglass tree” (the title, too, of Murray’s second novel). The view took in much of Manhattan, eighty blocks south to midtown’s tall buildings. Before these were built, Murray could see all the way down to the Empire State Building, five miles south. The sense of freedom that his view gave him, he said, had always stimulated his imagination.\n\nThe living room’s only floor-to-ceiling wall, perhaps nine feet high by twelve feet long, was entirely obscured by Murray’s library, oriented towards 19th- and early-20th century Euro-Anglo-American fiction, but rich in other genres: literary criticism, American, European, and world history, biography, philosophy all the way back to ancient Greece, Greek poetry and theatre, much aesthetics, art criticism, art history, poetry, and, of course, music, and not only jazz.\n\nA few of the shelves’ authors: Tolstoy, Mann, Proust, James, Eliot, Faulkner, Hemingway, Kenneth Burke, whose Grammar of Motives was crucial to Murray in his twenties; the philosopher of art Suzanne K. Langer, the great classicist Gilbert Murray, Harold Rosenberg, one of the mid-20th century’s cleverest art critics, the mythologist Joseph Campbell, the psychologist/art theorist Rudolph Arnheim, and Constance Rourke. A miniature row, perhaps two feet long, sat right above Murray’s desk, apart from the others, as if he wanted them close for comfort and inspiration. These were his talismans, his sacred texts, including Malraux’s Man’s Fate; Joel Chandler Harris’s The Complete Tales of Uncle Remus; Constance Rourke’s American Humor; and, dearest of all to Murray, Thomas Mann’s tetralogy, Joseph and His Brothers. During World War II, Murray the Air Force officer could not stop hoping that he would live long enough to finish Joseph the Provider, the final volume.\n\nI had never met someone who seemed to have read, and re-read, everything of consequence. As if performing a parlor trick, but with deep feeling, he would recite a two-paragraph passage from Hemingway’s A Farewell to Arms, or Frost’s Acquainted With The Night, or the great final paragraph of Joyce’s The Dead. Over the years, Murray’s mnemonic gift acquired practical value — often now, he no longer had to struggle out of his armchair and across the room for the book he needed to resolve an argument.\n\nInterviewing Murray could drive one crazy, he held so tenaciously to his opinions. Thinking back on our conversations, I can’t recall anything out of him even close to, “Hmm. Maybe you’re right after all.” He could get nasty: “Have you ever heard any Armstrong at all?” Listening back to our earliest interviews, I’m struck by how pained he sounds, as if my mental clumsiness aggrieved him. I suppose it did.\n\nFrom the start, I could get every bit as pissed-off at him, usually for his inflexibility. At times it was not very good communication. After reading it in manuscript, I criticized his 1996 novel The Seven League Boots, the third installment in what had become the Scooter epic. It was lacking in conflict, I said.\n\nAM: Why do you say that? He doesn’t know what he wants to do with himself. What’s he accomplished?\n\nTS: He’s the bassist in the best band in America.\n\nAM: That wasn’t his objective. But why should he be in pain over that? You’ve come up in an age of bullshit psychiatry and psychiatrists, so you think everybody should be sick. I think the blues is the answer. If you can swing and you’ve got your health, you can get through things.\n\nTS: But how can readers identify with Scooter if everything comes so easily to him?\n\nAM: The reader can take him as an ideal. Scooter has to fail? Every genius failed before he succeeded? I don’t think so.\n\nTS: It might give the story some drama, some suspense.\n\nAM: If that’s what you’re after, you can write a melodrama.\n\nMurray’s irritation never lasted — not that I ever saw — but quickly reverted to his characteristic animated eagerness, as he turned to explicating one or another of his ideas, which, the more of his work I reread and the more time I spent with him, I realized were complex, not easy to grasp, and had been painstakingly shaped into a system that unified artistic genres in elegant and previously overlooked ways.\n\nOf the books to which Murray introduced me, Constance Rourke’s American Humor — an essential text to him for a\n\nhalf century — had the greatest impact. I devoured it twice, lying on my living-room sofa, not getting up for hours. A reader misled by the book’s title into expecting a light anthology, a compendium of native wit and wisdom, is in for a surprise. The title is a play on the dual meaning of “humor” — first, comedy; then temperament or mood. “Character” comes close — which is why it is striking (Rourke must have intended it) that the subtitle she gave American Humor is “A Study of the National Character.”\n\nRourke pioneered the investigation of a topic that became central to the breadth of the humanities from not long after World War II through today: the interaction of high and low (or popular) culture. By introducing me to this problem, Murray steered me into an area that became my primary thinking and writing interest for almost fifteen years.\n\nAnother of Rourke’s great achievements was to trace the emergence, between the Revolution and the Jacksonian era, of three national symbols, icons that early Americans, struggling to define themselves, created: the Yankee, the backwoodsman, and the Negro. Murray made Rourke’s “comic trio,” as she called it, the basis of his notion of the “cultural mulatto,” according to which all Americans have more than one cultural component — that every Caucasian, for instance, has absorbed African-American cultural traits. Murray has often cited Rourke’s trio as the source of one of his central tenets: what he calls the “incontestably mulatto nature” of American culture.\n\nA third Rourke idea grew important to Murray: Americans’ improvisatory nature. On that subject, one particular sentence of Rourke’s had a galvanizing effect on Murray: “The mythic trio’s comedy, their irreverent wisdom, their sudden changes and adroit adaptations, provided emblems for a pioneer people who required resilience as a prime trait.”\n\nI was reading the sentence aloud, perhaps a third of the way through, when Murray jumped in and, purely from memory, wrapped it up with a flourish. “That sentence pulled everything together for me,” he said — not merely his thoughts about American culture in general but his argument that jazz is the quintessential American art. He thought, ‘What is the musical emblem for a pioneer people who required resilience as a prime trait?’ Jazz! That’s why it’s so easy for all Americans, of whatever color, to identify with jazz as something basic to them.” (Murray’s anachronistic thinking gets him trouble: it’s been a long time since jazz was central to Americans’ taste.)\n\nSeveral years later, I published an essay on Rourke — a pure product of our Saturday afternoons. Murray was high on it, and insisted that I submit it as the foreword of a forthcoming new edition of American Humor. I don’t know why, but I never did.\n\n***\n\nI realized that hanging out with Murray could make me a lot smarter. He had never doubted it: “See, you’re going to be like the other interviewers: come here, end up getting an education.” That low chuckle.\n\nHe was happy to have me materialize weekly. He needed protégés, needed to enlighten, to turn hip (as Duke Ellington once said about his longtime friend, “Albert Murray is the unsquarestcat I know”). Over the last several decades, Murray had drawn to Lenox Terrace many informal students. Now I was one.\n\nFor two or three years, from 1996 to roughly 1998, I spent many a Saturday afternoon at 45 Lenox Terrace. When I no longer made regular visits I dropped in through at least 2001. We sometimes had phone conversations as long as the live ones were. When I started my new book, he asked what it was about.\n\nI answered a little sheepishly. “Andy Warhol.” I couldn’t imagine Warhol stimulating anything in Murray other than groans and sardonic chuckling. He surprised me — although he was permanently attached to the now-tame modernism of his late friend, the painter and collagist Romare Bearden (which, though I politely kept it to myself, bored the hell out of me), he was genuinely interested in my new topic, and we spent the rest of the afternoon discussing Duchamp, Johns, and Warhol. Murray’s lack of intimacy with postmodernist art resulted in an unusual temper: mild.\n\nA friend wanted to know how I would characterize my relationship with Murray. “Student?” he asked. “Protégé? Disciple?”\n\n“Chauffeur,” I said. Which was indeed a good part of it.\n\nMurray and I would come out of his building, clamber into my car, a tough job for him even with help from me or the doorman, and head downtown. Our first stop was usually the Duane Reade on Sixth Avenue in the mid-Forties, where I would hop out and pick up Murray’s weekly medicinal and general health stash. I could never understand why we drove eight miles for Metamucil when there must have been two or three Duane Reades in Lenox Terrace’s vicinity.\n\nWe often went further downtown, usually to Murray’s favorite bookstore, The Strand, on 12th Street and Broadway. (Entering the Strand made me shudder — I had slaved there in 1971 for $2.00 an hour.)\n\nOne afternoon, Murray and I stopped at an office-chair store that someone had recommended to Murray. The ground-floor showroom was filled with expensive specimens.\n\nA stuffy salesman glided over.\n\n“I’m looking for something that’ll let me write another two, three books,” said Mr. Murray with his big, contagious smile. Predictably disarmed and shedding his hauteur, the fellow wound up telling us that he was a ex-junkie whose roommate in detox had been Billy Higgins, Ornette Coleman’s fine first drummer.\n\n“I heard you gentlemen talking about jazz,” said the salesman, “so I figured you might be familiar with Billy.” The guy didn’t know that he was crossing a minefield: Mr. Murray’s tastes in modern jazz extended to Bird, the pre-1965 Miles, and some Monk. Ornette was another matter. Whether he couldn’t or wouldn’t, he thought, the man did not swing. Played out of tune, too. I braced myself for a trashing of Billy Higgins’s former employer, but none came. Smiling pleasantly, Mr. Murray listened to the salesman’s tales of rehabbing with Billy. Waving his arms generously around the showroom, our new friend insisted that we take our time looking around. We circumnavigated the carpeted room leisurely until Mr. Murray settled on a top-dollar chair.\n\nBack at Lenox Terrace, atypically choosing to stand, Murray launched into a discourse on high standards and the importance of elegance. It was to be expected, he said, that without even thinking he would go right for the best chair in the place. I couldn’t decide if his self-aggrandizement was just an instance of the common effort to mask insecurity with bravado (not likely; insecurity wasn’t one of Mr. Murray’s prime traits); or a denial of early poverty (no, because Murray didn’t consider his background poor); or pointing to the afternoon’s purchase to argue that black people have innate good taste and are drawn to quality, traits that whites generally refuse to acknowledge.\n\nThese speculations put me in mind of something I pondered now and then, an apparent contradiction in Murray’s worldview. Seeing himself as culturally mulatto was important to Murray; Mann and Hemingway were as much a part of his soul, he argued habitually, as any Negro author. “If I’m not one of the best living writers,” he liked to say, “no thanks for being the best living black writer.”\n\nIn the first half of the 20th century, there was a much-used term among blacks. A “race man” could be counted on to support his fellow Negroes in their every endeavor. He joined them in their political and other struggles, fought every attempt to humiliate his brother, asserted his political, legal and social equality, and was proud of “the race’s” achievements and confident in its potential. Paradoxically, Murray the self-proclaimed cultural mulatto was also a strong race man, for whom blacks’ frequent superiority to whites was a given. The very idea of a white jazz musician outplaying a black musician, (virtually) any black musician, was ridiculous. And there were Murray’s travels among the “pretty good” white intellectuals of the South (several of whom were a good deal more accomplished than he), whom he hardly loses a chance to ridicule.\n\nMurray, it would seem, was a soul in conflict, race man vs. cultural mulatto. How could he resolve these two contradictory traits? The answer is simple: he didn’t have to. We can speak of a coexistence of two distinct traits, not necessarily a contradiction. Ellison was a similar case, believing just as strongly in Americans’ cultural multiracialism as his friend Al did (in fact, some believe that it was Ellison, not Murray, who originated the concept), and at the same time was considered by friends and colleagues to be a staunch race man.\n\n***\n\nLate one fall afternoon, Mr. Murray settled into the living-room armchair in which he spent most of his waking hours. Although I had absorbed the books in which he unpacked his aesthetic — The Hero and the Blues, The Blue Devils of Nada, and parts of Stomping the Blues — we had never talked our way through the complex, carefully worked-out system these books express. That’s what we did that evening, and for several subsequent Saturdays. It astonished me that Murray moved fluently through both the dauntingly high level of abstraction and erudition of The Hero and the Blues and the sensuous, overspilling, fecund world of Train Whistle Guitar. I had never spent time with someone who functioned at a level so high and so wide.\n\nThe concept that lies at the heart of the aesthetic that Murray worked out between the late 1940s and 1973, when he published The Hero and the Blues, is that of the blues idiom. Although the idea arose out of Murray’s involvement with jazz, he applied it almost from the start to literature, painting, sculpture — the full range of the arts.\n\nThe blues idiom, Murray told me, was the most adequate aesthetic “for dealing with contemporary experience. It’s an attitude of affirmation in the face of difficulty, of improvisation in the face of challenge. It means you acknowledge that life is a low-down dirty shame yet confront that fact with perseverance, with humor, and, above all, with elegance.”\n\nTo extend the definition: the blues idiom is the artist’s response to his discovery (from which most people run) that life is nada: nothingness, meaninglessness. Capable of ending without warning. Where the winner’s rewards are the same as the loser’s: nothing. What is the artist’s response to nada? If he works within the blues idiom, he first accepts it. That is what’s behind Murray’s long-standing admiration of Hemingway, namely, the master’s belief, which Murray had long made his own, that victory will not improve the winner’s life, will have no impact on it at all. The bone-chilling seven-line prose poem that serves as the epigraph to Hemingway’s early short-story collection, Winner Take Nothing, comes so close to Murray’s idea of contemporary experience that for him, Hemingway is the exemplar not merely of the blues idiom writer, but of the blues idiom artist as such. (Hemingway, incidentally, put quotes around the epigraph so that it might be taken as a piece of age-old wisdom; in fact, he wrote it.):\n\n“Unlike all other forms of lutte or\n\ncombat the conditions are that the\n\nwinner shall take nothing; neither\n\nhis ease, nor his pleasure, nor any\n\nnotions of glory; nor, if he win far\n\nenough, shall there be any reward\n\nwithin himself.”\n\nBut accepting life’s nothingness is merely the blues-idiom artist’s first step. In the act of creation, the artist confronts, or “counterstates” (another favorite Murray word), entropy, randomness, and disorder, single-handedly restoring the Duke’s fading career….\n\nClassical music may have its share of great composers, performers, and conductors, but for Murray, none of them work with the same clear-eyed acceptance of the nothingness of life and the necessity of going on nonetheless, as Ellington, Charlie Parker, or Hemingway, negating it with order and beauty. Blues-idiom art, whether made by Lester Young or Samuel Beckett, is a transformation of chaos into order. But its benefits never last. “If you win one day,” says Murray, “trouble is going to come the next.”\n\nThe artistic activity that is the ablest at keeping hopelessness and despair away is improvisation — for Murray “the ultimate skill.” The first-rate improviser can take the meager possibilities at hand and change them utterly. As did Matisse, who gave the Jazz cutouts their name because they were improvised; or Hemingway, who said that when you knew what your next sentence was, it was time to stop work; or Paul Gonsalves, the Ellington tenor saxophonist, who created bedlam at the 1956 Newport Jazz Festival with a literally show-stopping twenty-seven-chorus tenor saxophone solo,\n\nMurray’s choice of musical heroes reveals a flaw: almost to a man (or woman), Murray’s gods were Swing Era musicians, or those, such as Ellington or Coleman Hawkins, who pushed their swing-based music into modernity. Like many a jazz writer — even a superb one such as Whitney Balliett, in love for life with Pee Wee Russell, Bix Beiderbecke, or Dave Tough — Murray held up as an aesthetic standard the musicians of his youth. And almost no others. He was scornful of the later John Coltrane after the tenor saxophonist tossed away conventional scales and chords for modes, which gave him an exhilarating freedom in his solos — and earned him Murray’s wrath. This anachronistic view was a flaw in Murray’s thought. If an ensemble didn’t swing with the four-to-the-bar bounce of the Basie Orchestra, they would never speak the blues idiom.\n\nOne day, Murray began running down one of my own musical lodestars, Robert Johnson, the Mississippi blues singer/guitarist, for being devoid of sophistication and elegance. This was befouling my kitchen. We were in the car at the time, and I was trying to keep Murray oblivious to my erratic path.\n\n“First,” I said, eyes on the road, hands on the wheel, “folk music is not necessarily primitive. Second, Johnson used it as a ladder, and got so high up there, he kicked the ladder away!” I said Robert Johnson played music that was not simple, but musically and lyrically — that’s right — sophisticated. His guitar playing was harmonically and — especially — rhythmically complex, his voice endlessly flexible. “An artist as affecting and as fluent as Robert Johnson,” I said, “melted down all genres — folk, popular, fine, whatever. And made his own, sui generis, art.”\n\nMurray would have none of it. Johnson was as minor as every rural blues musician, Northern white intellectuals who ignorantly romanticized him notwithstanding. I shelved it, for now.\n\n***\n\nI often hooked up with Mr. Murray after a Jazz at Lincoln Center concert. We would look around for each other in the emptying house and I’d take his elbow and help him up the aisle, then the outdoor steps, to my car. I grew mildly resentful of my Sherpa role (never mind that I’d volunteered for it), not because of anything Mr. Murray did or said — there was always an animated conversation, or an argument, about the concert — but I imagined other concertgoers considering me some sort of lackey. (In retrospect, I would not vociferously deny that I was, I just wouldn’t have put it that way). And if it were indeed the case, I was getting plenty back — an education and a new friendship with a brown-skinned octogenarian who never ceased to amaze me.\n\nAs we headed uptown, by no means all of our talk was serious. Or even focused. Or about music. Murray might sing the praises of Henry Aaron, Willie McCovey, and Satchel Paige, all Mobilians, and Willie Mays, from Westfield, just outside of the city.\n\n“What’s next on your writing agenda?”\n\n“Scooter’s next. Next series of episodes.”\n\n“But then it’ll be a tetralogy.”\n\nHe cracked up. “Why do you get into these academic things? I don’t give a fuck what you call it, man!”\n\nOnce I remarked that it must feel great for he and Mrs. Murray to have been a couple for so long; there was all that trust and mutual awareness. He looked up and said that no, it wasn’t great. “Because you’re always worrying about who’s going to go first and leave you alone.”\n\nI asked him how he felt when he woke up in the morning.\n\n“Glad that I’m alive.”\n\n“You say that pretty jauntily.”\n\n“Why not? Look at all the people that are dead. All these people I admired — dead! All this achievement — they’re all dead!”\n\nOne time, still smarting from his trashing of Robert Johnson, I reintroduced the topic. I should have known better.\n\n“Man, when I was a kid, guys like that were playing on the corner. You’re not talking to some Johnny-come-lately. I grew up with guys like Robert Johnson. Not only did Johnson not swing, but he was incapable of the extension, elaboration, and refinement of a Johnny Hodges.” I disagreed strenuously — but never in a million years, never, would you hear Al Murray say, “Maybe you’re right after all.”\n\nDespite his tremendous conceptual grasp of American vernacular music, Murray had only limited familiarity with the working musician’s practice. I often heard him point out the elegant, insouciant, and sly way the best jazz musicians camouflage their exhausting efforts at the expense of B.B. King, with his grimaces, eye-popping, and body contortions. All of these melodramatic gestures were faked, Murray asserted, for the audience’s sake — no one could possibly be exerting himself that hard the fiftieth time he played the same solo. I thought that if he had he watched many blues guitarists at work, he would have seen that they almost all grimace: Buddy Guy, Albert King, Otis Rush, Stevie Ray Vaughan, and many others. The grimace has little to do with physical effort; it’s part of the music, a mirror of the fingers’ work, a reinforcement of the guitar line. It’s a sure bet that B.B. grimaces in the recording studio, too. (And by the way, after many audiences with B.B. and Lucille, I have never heard B.B. play the same solo twice.)\n\nGiven Mr. Murray’s evidently total disdain for pop music, I was delighted to come across a January 1960 letter to Ellison. Murray was in the Air Force, stationed in Los Angeles.\n\nI went to two RAY CHARLES dance dates. …Wonderful time…Man, that goddamned Ray ass Charles absorbs everything and uses everything. Absorbs it and assimilates it with all that sanctified stew meat smelling, mattress stirring, fucked up guilt touchy violence, jailhouse dodging, second hand American dream shit, and sometimes it comes out like a sermon by one of them spellbinding stem winders in your work-in-progress [a reference to Ellison’s unfinished second novel; it’s interesting to see that he was showing it to Murray as he wrote] and other times he’s extending Basie’s stuff better than Basie himself.\n\nSo much for the charge of musical rigidity. Murray, by the way, only wrote crazy, stream-of-consciousness letters like the above to Ellison (as far as I know), who, despite his fussy, frosty public reserve, wrote back to Murray just as wildly.\n\n***\n\nIn 1998, I applied for a Guggenheim grant, and asked Mr. Murray to write my recommendation. He readily agreed. I never mentioned it to him after that; as self-disciplined as he was, I was sure he had sat down early one morning, written and mailed an appropriate squib, and gotten down to work.\n\nMonths later (or so it seemed), a letter arrived from the Guggenheim Foundation. Excitedly tearing open the envelope, I saw to my misery that I hadn’t won a grant. I phoned Mr. Murray.\n\n“Damn!” was his response. “You the first one I ever wrote a recommendation for didn’t win the award!” And he started laughing, to my irritation. Then I started laughing, too, at his off-the-wall reaction to my failure. There we were, he in Harlem, me in the riverside hamlet of Upper Nyack, cracking up. Soon I wasn’t miserable anymore. It was the blues idiom at work.\n\nOne day, we happened to be talking about Train Whistle Guitar. I brought up the final episode, in which Scooter is thrown for a loop to discover that his parents, the couple whose surname he bears, aren’t his biological parents at all. They raised him almost from birth, but his real mother, who bore him out of wedlock, is their neighbor, Miss Tee, who just happens to have been Scooter’s favorite adult from his earliest childhood. All of this, Train Whistle Guitar’s hidden story, is wrapped up with lightning speed in the book’s last three pages, the final image Miss Tee on her porch, watching Scooter walk away: “And when I looked back from the gate she was waving and smiling and there were tears in her eyes.”\n\n“That was some imaginative stroke,” I said.\n\n“Imagination? That’s all fact.”\n\n“What?”\n\n“That’s real stuff. Nobody can tell me ‘how to deal with that’ because I knew how to deal with it. I’m trying to show them how to deal with it.”\n\n“You mean you didn’t make that up?” Amazement had reduced me to stupidity.\n\n“I’m telling you, it’s fact. All of Scooter’s emotion in there is real. That’s real stuff.”\n\n“So Scooter’s parents…I can’t believe they’re based on yours.”\n\n“Hey, you’re supposed to turn fact to fiction.”\n\n“But this book is your story!”\n\n“That’s right. Can’t be literal about everything.”\n\n“Did it alienate you from your adoptive parents?”\n\n“I didn’t give up the Murrays. Never have. I still think of Mama and Papa.\n\n“Did you learn who your father was?”\n\nHe had. He asked his actual mother, whose name was Sudie Graham: “I went up to visit Tuskegee in 1935, when I was a senior at Mobile County Training School. She gave me a letter and told me to take it to a Mrs. Green. So Mrs. Green told me to go down to the power plant and ask for John Young. I gave him the letter. He read it and said, “What’s your name?”\n\n“Albert Murray.”\n\nAnd he said, “Do you have some time? This afternoon I’ll take you out to meet my family.” That was my father, John Young. He was a boiler room engineer.”\n\n“Did you see him after that?”\n\n“I lived in his house for two years.” Adopted by his father.\n\n***\n\nSoon after my first daughter was born, in September, 1997, Murray and I were talking on the phone.\n\n“What’s her name?”\n\n“Louisiana.”\n\n“Luzana Cholly!”\n\nWhat an ego, I thought. The whole world is an extension of himself. Oh well. The ego was just part of the package.\n\nNeither of us realized it then, but my daughter’s birth was the beginning of the end. He grew gruff and irritable when I stopped turning up every Saturday. He was a father; didn’t he remember how much time a baby swallows up? And I wonder sometimes: Did becoming a father mean I didn’t need a father figure?\n\nWe had not seen each other for a long time when I went over to loan him Don Delillo’s Underworld and a big new book on America’s founding documents. Some time afterwards, we spoke on the phone. He asked me over. “I’m holding those books of yours.” I never went. Out of an impulse I couldn’t identify, I considered our friendship a closed book.\n\n***\n\nHe lay on his side on a hospital bed, wearing a white gown and partly hidden behind two home-health aides. I approached and bent down so I was facing him, not leaning over him. I couldn’t tell if he recognized me. I think not. His face was deeply lined. The thick creases looked rubbery. He smiled nonstop, but the smile looked like a grimace, so that his face resembled a tragicomic mask. Mrs. Murray was sitting up straight on a nearby sofa. She, too, was suffering from dementia, slightly less so than her husband.\n\nI couldn’t understand what Mr. Murray was saying; he spoke in a kind of babble. Nor could I tell if he thought coherently. Given who he was, Murray’s illness was especially cruel. This man, to whom thinking and disputing had been almost as essential as breathing, who had spent his life in the world of ideas, now passedhistime in near-mindlessness.\n\nI showed him the magazine interview he and I had done in 1996, almost fifteen years before, when we’d met. He looked intently at the big color photographs. He knew the man in the pictures.\n\nThere was a bouquet on the living-room table from Wynton. I knelt by the hospital bed to say goodbye. It was the autumn of 2010. After that I “checked” on the Murrays through mutual friends. But unlike the many who visited him regularly, I never went back, and wondered\n\nif my failure to minister was a moral failure as well. I went my way, often not thinking about Mr. Murray for a week or longer. I phoned a mutual friend, my usual source of Murray news, whom I hadn’t spoken to for months. As I listened to her phone ring, I was suddenly fearful, certainthat Mr. Murray had died without my knowing about it. No, she said, nothing had changed.\n\nWhen he did die, in August 2013, I knew about it. So did more than a million others. There he was, astonishingly, on page one of The New York Times, in a big color photograph from 1998. Its deep red (the subject’s Fifties-modernist chair) and deep blue (his sports shirt) were handsome indeed, the subject less so, giving the camera an atypically jaundiced, dyspeptic look. It was not a very appealing portrait; they could easily have come up with a better one — the smaller, black-and-white 1967 snapjust below Sourface, for instance. Here was the real thing: a handsome, younger-looking-than-his-fifty-years Murray, grinning that simpaticocrows-feet grin at his man Ellison, who appears to bequite taken with himself. Just snip out Ellison, and you’ve got a great Al Murray shot.\n\nI could not guess what made the Times give Murray, no celebrity, its royal send-off, normally reserved for senators and socialites. More power to the Times. Besides, if Albert Murray had seen himself on the front page, nothing could have looked more natural to him."
