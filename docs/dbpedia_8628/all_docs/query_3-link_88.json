They fell in love, married and moved halfway across the world. One day with shaky hands, Lindalouise took a journal of songs that she’d been secretly writing to Dougie, a writer she deeply admired. It was just over three years ago they decided to embrace a new journey. What We Embrace tell stories, some triumphant, some less so. Their sound is teetering between Indie Folk, Alt Country and New Americana, their voices blending, lifting and weaving to unexpected places. Each song is a journey through heartbreak, love, uncertainty and redemption. They make music for the dreamers, the broken and the yet-to-be-found.\n\nGoogleCal\n\nwed21aug6:00 pmwed7:00 pmOpen Air Performance Series: Warren Nipp 6:00 pm - 7:00 pm(GMT-07:00)\n\nTime\n\n(Wednesday) 6:00 pm - 7:00 pm(GMT-07:00)\n\nEvent Details\n\nWARREN NIPP Open Air Performance Series\n\nEvent Details\n\nWARREN NIPP\n\nOpen Air Performance Series\n\nFrom July 8th – August 30th, 2024 join us for a free, 1-hour performance every Monday to Friday at 6PM as part of our Open Air Performance Series.

As the sun sets below the horizon and darkness emerges, the veil lifts between the everyday and the spirit realm. Supernatural creatures inhabit our world: haunting dreams and lullabies, appearing in the pages of legends and recounted through the memories of elders. This magic manifests in the whimsical storytelling of artist Cindy Mochizuki. stories best told at twilight focuses on the artist’s telling of Japanese myths, legends and folklore. Each artwork—which might manifest as a short animation, an elaborate installation or a singular performance—is the result of an abundance of images and objects that came before. This solo exhibition goes behind the curtain, taking a rare look at the artist’s usually hidden creative process and spanning artworks created over more than a decade.\n\nGoogleCal\n\nArt Gallery at Evergreen1205 Pinetree Way\n\nsat21sep12:00 pmsat1:00 pmFamily Days 12:00 pm - 1:00 pm(GMT-07:00)\n\nBuy Tickets\n\nREGISTER NOW!\n\nTime\n\n(Saturday) 12:00 pm - 1:00 pm(GMT-07:00)\n\nLocation\n\nArt Gallery at Evergreen\n\n1205 Pinetree Way\n\nEvent Details\n\nLooking for a fun, free, and engaging way to spend time with your family?

Join artist Jordanna George for an illustration workshop and creative activity in honour of the National Day for Truth and Reconciliation. This public program, inspired by Hummingbird Takes Flight by q̓ic̓əy̓ (Katzie) First Nation artist sɬə́məxʷ, Rain Pierre, is a meaningful opportunity to reflect on Truth and Reconciliation and create an artwork in response to the ways we can take action. Hummingbird Takes Flight (2021) is a digital drawing by Rain Pierre which incorporates Coast Salish design and symbolism. The artwork is exhibited on the windows of Evergreen Cultural Centre and is an offering of protection and a reminder to passers-by of the possibilities present all around us.\n\nFamily friendly, ages 12+ recommended. Free to attend.\n\nABOUT JORDANNA GEORGE\n\nJordanna George (they/them) is an artist of mixed T’Sou-ke and Ukrainian ancestry. Originally from their ancestral land in Sooke, BC, they now live on the unceded territories of the xʷməθkwəy̓əm (Musqueam), Skwxwú7mesh (Squamish), Səl̓ílwətaɬ (Tsleil-Waututh) and Kʷikʷəƛ ̓əm (Kwikwetlem) Nations in Coquitlam, BC. Since earning a Bachelor of Fine Arts from the University of Victoria in 2019, they have primarily been making comics and illustrations. Their explorations of identity, belonging and hope are influenced by Indigeneity, queerness and science fiction. The rest of George’s artistic practice involves painting and sculpture, following similar themes in their illustrative work.\n\nABOUT THE EXHIBITION\n\nArtist sɬə́məxʷ, Rain Pierre works collaboratively to create artwork intended to inspire. Hummingbird Takes Flight (2021) depicts a hummingbird—an animal of great personal and cultural significance—as it visits two hanging fuchsia flowers. For many Coast Salish cultures, the hummingbird is a messenger of joy and bringer of luck. Presented on the windows of Evergreen Cultural Centre, the work is a reminder to passers-by of the possibilities present all around us. Pierre is a q̓ic̓əy̓ (Katzie) First Nation visual artist and the owner and founder of RainAwakens, a seven-person arts team that produces public art and engagement events around the world.\n\nImage: sɬə́məxʷ, Rain Pierre, Hummingbird Takes Flight, 2021, digital drawing.
