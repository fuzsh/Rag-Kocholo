It’s pretty amazing.\"\n\nAccording to the movie's release, \"Bocelli and his wife Veronica travel on horseback along Italy’s Via Francigena, an ancient road traveled by pilgrims for centuries in the footsteps of the apostles and saints.\"\n\nThe whole film starts off with an introduction and welcome from the Pope. Bocelli's children and wife also make an appearance in the film."
