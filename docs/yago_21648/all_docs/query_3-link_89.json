        "text": "Not that you need any convincing but with so many stellar movies, it's a great time to revisit how to watch the Star Wars movies in order again.\n\nAlmost half a century has passed since the first Star Wars film changed cinema forever in 1977 and, with the franchise still going strong decades later, there are more options than ever to choose from.\n\nWith nine mainline movies, two spin-offs and a host of Disney Plus shows to consider, figuring out how to watch them in order can be a tricky task.\n\nAs well as The Mandalorian season 3, which released on the platform in March 2023, fans were also treated to the first season of Rogue One prequel Andor last year.\n\nAnd there are more Star Wars series on the way to Disney Plus including The Mandalorian spin-offs Ahsoka and Star Wars: Skeleton Crew. We will also be getting the oldest chronological offering yet with the Disney+ show The Acolyte which will be set during the glory days of the High Republic.\n\nWe can also rest comfortably knowing that The Mandalorian will return for a fourth season on Disney+ sometime in the future.\n\nBut the Star Wars order gets more tricky when you add in the TV shows like Clone Wars, Rebels, The Mandalorian and The Book of Boba Fett. Disney Plus has all the Star Wars movies (in 4K too), as well as the shows and breakaway standalone shorts and animations.\n\nIf you want to watch the Star Wars movies and shows in order, you have a few options. Some claim there are five different orders you can watch the Star Wars saga in, but there are a few widely accepted preferred ways.\n\nThe three seen as the best in telling the Skywalker story are the order of episodes (chronological), production (release date), and the Godfather cut. There's also the Machete order that cuts The Phantom Menace. There are pros and cons for all of these of course, which we've broken down for you.\n\nSubscribe to Disney Plus for £79.90 for a whole year or £7.99 a month\n\nRead on for everything you need to know about how to watch the Star Wars movies in order.\n\nStar Wars movies in chronological timeline order\n\nStar Wars movies and TV series in release order\n\nComplete Star Wars viewing order including TV shows\n\nStar Wars movies in 'The Godfather order'\n\nStar Wars movies in The Machete Order\n\nStar Wars movies in The Rinster Order\n\nWhat's the best Star Wars movie order?\n\nStar Wars movies on Disney Plus\n\nHow long will it take to watch all the Star Wars movies?\n\nStar Wars movies in chronological timeline order\n\nThe Star Wars movies in chronological order sets the movies in a real timeline so you experience the story as it would unfold for the characters. Below, we have every Star Wars movie as well as the spin-offs. If you start the movies in this order you could watch them in a weekend.\n\nIf marked in italics then the titles remain unreleased.\n\nHow to watch the Star Wars in chronological order:\n\nUntitled James Mangold film (TBC)\n\nThe Acolyte (2024-)\n\nEpisode I: The Phantom Menace (1999)\n\nEpisode II: Attack of the Clones (2002)\n\nStar Wars: The Clone Wars (2008-2020)\n\nEpisode III: Revenge of the Sith (2005)\n\nSolo: A Star Wars Story (2018)\n\nObi-Wan Kenobi (2022)\n\nStar Wars Rebels (2014-2018)\n\nAndor (2022-present)\n\nRogue One: A Star Wars Story (2016)\n\nEpisode IV: A New Hope (1977)\n\nEpisode V: The Empire Strikes Back (1980)\n\nEpisode VI: Return of the Jedi (1983)\n\nThe Mandalorian (2019-present)\n\nThe Book of Boba Fett (2021-2022)\n\nAhsoka (2023-)\n\nSkeleton Crew (2023-)\n\nUntitled Dave Feloni film (TBC)\n\nStar Wars: Resistance (2018-2020)\n\nEpisode VII: The Force Awakens (2015)\n\nEpisode VIII: The Last Jedi (2017)\n\nEpisode IX: The Rise of Skywalker (2019)\n\nUntitled Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy film (TBC)\n\nOr, going by movies only:\n\nUntitled James Mangold film (TBC)\n\nEpisode I: The Phantom Menace (1999)\n\nEpisode II: Attack of the Clones (2002)\n\nStar Wars: The Clone Wars (2008)\n\nEpisode III: Revenge of the Sith (2005)\n\nSolo: A Star Wars Story (2018)\n\nRogue One: A Star Wars Story (2016)\n\nEpisode IV: A New Hope (1977)\n\nEpisode V: The Empire Strikes Back (1980)\n\nEpisode VI: Return of the Jedi (1983)\n\nUntitled Dave Feloni film (TBC)\n\nEpisode VII: The Force Awakens (2015)\n\nEpisode VIII: The Last Jedi (2017)\n\nEpisode IX: The Rise of Skywalker (2019)\n\nUntitled Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy film (TBC)\n\nPros: If you choose to watch the Star Wars movies in chronological order, you'll be living the story along with the characters, following the official chronology of the series. We've used New Hope as the central point to work out the timeline here.\n\nCons: This order does, however, come with a couple of downsides. For one, the big reveal about Luke's parentage (one of the most iconic scenes in cinematic history) is ruined this way. It also makes the saga's inconsistencies glaringly obvious, including Obi-Wan forgetting about Leia's existence despite being present at her birth. And that's assuming you make it through the divisive prequels, a feat that might require you to use the Force, or don't want to have to rush through the full Mandalorian series on Disney Plus.\n\nIf you're looking for the Star Wars complete saga - that's including the Mandalorian - then skip to that section further down the page.\n\nRead More: Obi-Wan Kenobi: How the Disney Plus series fits into the Star Wars timeline\n\nNext up, watching the Star Wars movies in release order.\n\nIt may not marry up to the chronological order of the story, but this release date order allows you to experience it how the rest of the world did.\n\nYou can also observe how cinematic techniques have developed (or not developed) over time.\n\nHere's how to watch the Star Wars movies in release order.\n\nEpisode IV: A New Hope (1977)\n\nEpisode V: The Empire Strikes Back (1980)\n\nEpisode VI: Return of the Jedi (1983)\n\nEpisode I: The Phantom Menace (1999)\n\nEpisode II: Attack of the Clones (2002)\n\nEpisode III: Revenge of the Sith (2005)\n\nEpisode VII: The Force Awakens (2015)\n\nRogue One: A Star Wars Story (2016)\n\nEpisode VIII: The Last Jedi (2017)\n\nSolo: A Star Wars Story (2018)\n\nEpisode IX: The Rise of Skywalker (2019)\n\nIf you want to watch the Star Wars movies in release order with the TV series (in italics) we've got that list for you too.\n\nEpisode IV: A New Hope (1977)\n\nEpisode V: The Empire Strikes Back (1980)\n\nEpisode VI: Return of the Jedi (1983)\n\nEpisode I: The Phantom Menace (1999)\n\nEpisode II: Attack of the Clones (2002)\n\nEpisode III: Revenge of the Sith (2005)\n\nStar Wars: The Clone Wars (2008-2020)\n\nStar Wars Rebels (2014-2018)\n\nEpisode VII: The Force Awakens (2015)\n\nRogue One: A Star Wars Story (2016)\n\nEpisode VIII: The Last Jedi (2017)\n\nStar Wars: Resistance (2018-2020)\n\nSolo: A Star Wars Story (2018)\n\nEpisode IX: The Rise of Skywalker (2019)\n\nThe Mandalorian (2019-present)\n\nThe Book of Boba Fett (2021-2022)\n\nObi-Wan Kenobi (2022)\n\nAndor (2022-present)\n\nAhsoka (2023)\n\nSkeleton Crew (2023)\n\nThe Acolyte (2024)\n\nLando (TBC)\n\nUntitled James Mangold film (TBC)\n\nUntitled Dave Feloni film (TBC)\n\nUntitled Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy film (TBC)\n\nPros: Enjoying Star Wars by release date, aka the purist way, means you watch the movies in the same order they originally came out in cinemas. After all, this is how most Star Wars fans experienced the intergalactic saga in the first place.\n\nCons: However, George Lucas made more than a few tweaks to the original trilogy following the release of the prequels, and has been vocal about watching them by in-movie chronology instead. Also, thanks to the advent of spin-off movies and TV shows watching this way means you might end up jumping around the story a bit.\n\nComplete Star Wars viewing order including TV shows\n\nAlthough some of the orders above include select Star Wars TV shows and specials produced since 1977, there are more out there. A lot more. While several are either unknown to many fans (like niche 1980s animation series Droids), others have been completely disavowed by Star Wars creator George Lucas (looking at you, Holiday Special). All, however, are part of the extended Star Wars Universe, officially or not.\n\nWhen Disney bought Lucasfilm it also meant that the Expanded Universe was reset, in plain terms it meant all the movies, animation and shows that had built up in the background were now not canon. The Prequel Trilogy, Original Trilogy and The Clone Wars animation all remain canon. Of course, Disney has added to the canon and more than replaced what was taken away. This will take you far longer than a weekend.\n\nFor those brave enough to view it all, here’s the entire Star Wars Saga and limited specials in chronological order - as best as we know at present.\n\nUntitled James Mangold film (upcoming)\n\nStar Wars: The Acolyte (upcoming, 2024?)\n\nEpisode I: The Phantom Menace (1999)\n\nEpisode II: Attack of the Clones (2002)\n\nLego Star Wars: The Yoda Chronicles (2013 to 2014)\n\nLego Star Wars: The Padawan Menace (2011)\n\nThe Clone Wars (2008 to 2014)\n\nEpisode III: Revenge of the Sith (2005)\n\nStar Wars: The Bad Batch (2021)\n\nSolo: A Star Wars Story (2018)\n\nObi-Wan Kenobi (2022)\n\nStar Wars Rebels (2014 to 2018)\n\nAndor (2022 to present)\n\nRogue One: A Star Wars Story (2016)\n\nStar Wars: Droids (1985 to 1986)\n\nEpisode IV: A New Hope (1977)\n\nStar Wars: Holiday Special (1978)\n\nLego Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Out (2012)\n\nEpisode V: The Empire Strikes Back (1980)\n\nEpisode VI: The Return of the Jedi (1983)\n\nLego Star Wars: The Freemaker Adventures (2016 to 2017)\n\nLego Star Wars: Droid Tales (2015)\n\nEwoks (1985 to 1986)\n\nThe Mandalorian (2019-present)\n\nThe Book of Boba Fett (2021-2022)\n\nAhsoka (upcoming, 2023)\n\nStar Wars: Skeleton Crew (upcoming, 2023)\n\nUntitled Dave Feloni film (upcoming)\n\nStar Wars: Resistance (2018 to Present)\n\nLego Star Wars: The Resistance Rises (2016)\n\nEpisode VII: The Force Awakens (2016)\n\nEpisode VIII: The Last Jedi (2017)\n\nEpisode IX: The Rise of Skywalker (2019)\n\nStar Wars: Forces of Destiny (2017)\n\nUntitled Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy film (upcoming)\n\nPros: The ultimate fan wants the ultimate Star Wars saga order. This order leaves nothing out, you'll get all the background for characters like Ahsoka getting you ready for The Mandalorian and the spin-offs.\n\nAhsoka came from Clone Wars, then popped up in Rebels and was last seen in The Mandalorian. We also expect Obi-Wan Kenobi to add more layers to the Jedi's story too as it's set 10 years after Revenge of the Sith, so around the Solo movie timeframe.\n\nSpin-off Andor, is set five years before Rogue One, so it's nearer Rebels and the new series; The Book of Boba Fett, Skeleton Crew are all before The Force Awakens. The Acolyte will come years before The Phantom Menace and lastly, The Bad Batch spins-off from The Clone Wars, and follows on from the series.\n\nCons: It's a lot! Get ready to spend every waking minute catching up. It's also being added to all the time with all the new series.\n\nStar Wars movies in 'The Godfather' order\n\nThe following are the Star Wars films in the \"Godfather\" order.\n\nEpisode IV: A New Hope (1977)\n\nEpisode V: The Empire Strikes Back (1980)\n\nEpisode I: The Phantom Menace (1999)\n\nEpisode II: Attack of the Clones (2002)\n\nEpisode III: Revenge of the Sith (2005)\n\nEpisode VI: Return of the Jedi (1983)\n\nPros: The idea of this ordering is to watch the original two Star Wars movies and then, after the shock reveals at the end of Empire Strikes Back that Darth Vader is Luke Skywalker's father, jump back to the prequel trilogy to fill in the background of Anakin Skywalker. After Revenge of the Sith, you then return to watch Return of the Jedi, adding new depth to Vader and Luke's final clash without disrupting the big twists of the story.\n\nAs you may have noticed this ordering evokes the flashback structure of Francis Ford Coppola's classic gangster movie The Godfather Part II (in other words it's Luke, I am your Godfather), and is fairly popular with fans online.\n\nCons: The obvious downside is that it's difficult to fit the newer Star Wars movies and TV series into this structure - probably the best way to watch them in this version is in production order following Return of the Jedi - so it may not be for everyone.\n\nStar Wars movies in The Machete Order\n\nNo, this is nothing to do with knives or, sadly, the Danny Trejo Spy Kids character. Instead, the name comes from Rod Hilton, author of blog nomachetejuggling.com, who sought to fix one of the saga’s biggest problems: if watched chronically, the big ‘No Luke, I am your father’ reveal is ruined.\n\nSimilar to the Godfather order, the Machete order allows you to enjoy the first two original Star Wars movies – and the shock Empire Strikes Back ending – before jumping into Vader’s backstory.\n\nHowever, you might notice a big difference from the Godfather order: The Phantom Menace is missing. Why? As Hilton explains: “The reason to skip Episode I isn’t that it’s bad, it’s that it’s irrelevant.”\n\nThe thinking is that the Star Wars saga better works as the tale of Luke Skywalker, not Darth Vader. At its core, it’s a story of how the younger Skywalker takes on a gigantic burden, saving the Galaxy – and his father – from the Dark Side. Hilton argues Episode I adds nothing to this story and all of its noteworthy events are summed up in the opening crawl to Episode II.\n\nIf that explanation doesn’t win you over, this thought might: removing Episode I means that, apart from a few lines in Episode II, Jar Jar is virtually removed from the Star Wars saga.\n\nEpisode IV: A New Hope (1977)\n\nEpisode V: The Empire Strikes Back (1980)\n\nEpisode II: Attack of the Clones (2002)\n\nEpisode III: Revenge of the Sith (2005)\n\nEpisode VI: Return of the Jedi (1983)\n\nTo continue The Machete Order you then watch the sequel saga:\n\nEpisode VII: The Force Awakens\n\nEpisode VIII: The Last Jedi\n\nEpisode IX: The Rise of Skywalker\n\nWell, now you know!\n\nStar Wars movies in The Rinster Order\n\nThe Rinster Order – named after superfan Ernest Rinster – has also gained some prominence in recent years among the Star Wars community.\n\nIf it looks the same as the Godfather order, that's because it is – but the Rinster method might well have come first.\n\nEpisode IV: A New Hope (1977)\n\nEpisode V: The Empire Strikes Back (1980)\n\nEpisode I: The Phantom Menace (1999)\n\nEpisode II: Attack of the Clones (2002)\n\nEpisode III: Revenge of the Sith (2005)\n\nEpisode VI: Return of the Jedi (1983)\n\nYou'll have to let us know if you like this one.\n\nWhat's the best Star Wars movie order?\n\nThough some sources claim there are up to five different orders you could watch the Star Wars saga in, there are three generally accepted ways to do it. One is in order of episodes (following in-movie chronology), the second is in order of production (going by release date) and the third (the so-called \"Godfather cut\") to best tell the Skywalker story's plot twists. All three have their pros and cons.\n\nThe Machete order is simple: you remove The Phantom Menace. In terms of what's best, for us it's the chronological viewing order. You can get all the movies in a weekend binge rather, so it's doable compared to the ultimate order. You just have 11 movies to watch alongside the two spin-offs.\n\nIf you're watching the Star Wars movies for the very first time, welcome my young Padwan. Perhaps the best way for you is the release order. Keep it simple then circle back when the TV series have built up to tackle the ultimate order.
