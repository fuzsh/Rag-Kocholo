        "text": "How can citizens of a country affect change for the common good?\n\nThe French commentator on American society in the 1830s, Alexis de Toqueville, observed that Americans are very quick to join together to promote whatever causes they favor. There was certainly evidence around him. Reforms on many issues — temperance, abolition, prison reform, women's rights, missionary work in the West — fomented groups dedicated to social improvements.\n\nOften these efforts had their roots in Protestant churches. In addition to their efforts to convert new members based on their religious beliefs, several denominations were willing to turn to the government to make the entire population comply with their version of morality. Methodists, Presbyterians, Congregationalists and Baptists were among the most prominent in the reform movements. Often advocates called for conventions to draft resolutions to present to government officials and followed up with letter writing campaigns. They formed local societies that wrote letters to newspapers and sponsored speakers to try to broaden support for the cause. While it was usually not women's place to speak in public at the time, reform movements frequently called on women who could set aside social customs when it was in a good cause.\n\nReform Movements in America\n\nThe abolition of slavery was one of the most powerful reform movements. Quakers and many churches in New England saw slavery as an evil that must be abolished from society. They targeted slave owners who profited off of enslaved people's labor. Harriot Tubman, who helped people escape, and Frederick Douglass, a self-educated and forceful orator and writer, proved be powerful speakers. Abolitionists came to the defense of African Americans accused of running from their masters when law officials threatened to return them. Abolitionism was anathema to Southerners and not popular in many areas of the North, but they moved slavery to a central focus in American political life.\n\nThe temperance crusade also had its roots in American Protestant churches, often in tandem with abolition. In slavery, the slave owners oppressed their human property. In the temperance perspective, saloon owners took advantage of human weakness (primarily men's weakness) to profit off customers' inability to avoid strong drink. Alcohol ruined families and bred crime, especially in the growing urban centers of the East. Drinking was sinful, and it was the government's responsibility to remove this temptation, in the view of the temperance advocates. They ran candidates on the Prohibition Party in elections, who were rarely successful, and pressured elected officials to make the manufacture and sale of alcohol illegal. In Iowa, temperance was one of the major issues dividing the two parties from the Civil War through the early 20th century. The state almost passed an amendment enshrining temperance into the constitution. The 18th amendment to the U.S. Constitution imposed temperance standards across the nation, but slightly more than a decade later, the 21st amendment repealed it. Enforcement had become too great a burden on law enforcement, and too many people objected to this restriction.\n\nOther reforms attracted similar attention, though never to the degree of prohibition and abolition. Some groups advocated for better treatment of the insane and more humane prisons. Advocates for women's rights used tactics similar to the prohibition and abolition movements to demand the right to vote. In fact, many of the same people participated in several reform causes.\n\nReform movements bring issues into public discussion. One set of reformers will usually generate opposing groups who often use the same techniques to persuade public opinion and elected officials. Debates over abortion and same-sex marriage are modern equivalents of some 19th century reform movements and often employ the same tactics. Demands for reform inject energy and new ideas into political debate and can keep the landscape shifting.\n\nSupporting Questions\n\nWhat factors motivated antebellum reformers to take action?\n\nGeorge Hosmer Address to the Erie County Common School Education Society, February 3, 1840 (Document)\n\n\"I Tell What I Have Seen\" — The Reports of Asylum Reformer Dorothea Dix, 1843 (Document)\n\n\"The Drunkard's Progress,\" June 15, 1846 (Political Cartoon)\n\nWhat were the common strategies antebellum reformers used?\n\n\"Celebration of the Iowa Territorial Temperance Society,\" January 2, 1840 (Document)\n\n\"The Prisoner's Friend\" Advertisement, September 8, 1848 (Document)\n\nExcerpts from the Commissioners' Report of Recommendations for Iowa School Laws, 1856 (Document)\n\n\"Lest We Forget - The Quaker Seedsmen of Long Ago\" Article, April 21, 1909 (Document)\n\nWhat did antebellum reformers achieve?\n\nBlueprint of Saint Elizabeths Hospital for the Mentally Ill, ca. 1853 (Map)\n\nExcerpts from Iowa Code about Education Reform, 1860 (Document)\n\n\"The Amana Colony,\" October 14, 1869 (Document)\n\n\"The Vanishing Shakers,\" January 18, 1917 (Document)\n\n18th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, January 28, 1919 (Document)\n\n21st Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, December 5, 1933 (Document)\n\nReform Movements in America Teaching Guide Printable Image and Document Guide\n\nAdditional Resources:\n\n\"A Penitentiary for Iowa,\" The Palimpsest\n\nThis essay from The Palimpsest, which was a historical magazine published the State Historical Society of Iowa beginning in 1920, looks at how the first legislative assembly of Iowa enacted to implement a criminal code in the territory.
