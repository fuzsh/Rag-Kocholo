Min), Viktor (Elliot Page) and Lila (Ritu Arya) all now exist in a completely new timeline – without their powers.\n\nSeason 4 sees the siblings reunite on a \"rescue mission\", come face-to-face with the final timeline's version of Reginald Hargreeves and yes, develop new powers. (Did you see Viktor's powerful new move in the trailer?!)\n\nThe Umbrella Academy season 4 will be released on Netflix worldwide on August 8th at midnight PT.

The exact reason behind this has not been confirmed by showrunner Steve Blackman or Netflix, but it's likely that the popular series was given a shortened final episode order alongside its cancellation so it could close out the storylines and not leave us all on a cliffhanger.\n\nThe Umbrella Academy season 4's episodes are titled:\n\nEpisode 1: The Unbearable Tragedy of Getting What You Want\n\nEpisode 2: Jean and Gene\n\nEpisode 3: The Squid and the Girl\n\nEpisode 4: The Cleanse\n\nEpisode 5: Six Years, Five Months, Two Days\n\nEpisode 6: End of the Beginning\n\nWhat will happen in The Umbrella Academy season 4? What happened at the end of season 3?\n\nThe official synopsis of The Umbrella Academy season 4 reads as follows: \"The Hargreeves siblings have scattered after the climactic showdown at the Hotel Oblivion led to a complete reset of their timeline.\"\n\n\"Stripped of their powers, each is left to fend for themselves and find a new normal — with wildly varying degrees of success. Yet the trappings of their uncanny new world prove too hard to ignore for very long. Their father Reginald, alive and well, has stepped out of the shadows and into the public eye, overseeing a powerful and nefarious business empire.\"\n\nIn season 4, the Hargreeves siblings reunite one more time as they come across a mysterious association known as 'The Keepers', a group who uphold the belief that the \"reality they’re living in is a lie and a great reckoning is coming.\"\n\nNick Offerman and Megan Mullally join the cast as Gene and Jean Thibedeau, \"a married pair of community college professors from New Mexico who wear sensible footwear and suffer from the most extreme case of deja vu this timeline has ever seen.\"\n\nAs for how it all ends? You'll have to tune one last time when the new episodes drop on August 8th.\n\nRead more from Capital Buzz here:\n\nWhen Does Outer Banks Season 4 Come Out?
