Nancy Scroggs, the daughter of the owner of a once-famous but now-struggling hotel, hatches a plan to draw in new customers. She picks up Peter Alstyne, a young man following his doctor's orders of a strict diet and a relaxing vacation, at the train station and convinces him--using the philosophy of Christian Science--to disregard his doctor's orders and stay at their hotel and eat all he wants. Soon he and Nancy fall in love and the hotel begins to pick up business again. But soon Peter receives a letter that changes everything for both him and Nancy.",
