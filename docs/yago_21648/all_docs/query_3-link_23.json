        "text": "With Pixar’s “Inside Out 2” finally coming to the end of a monster cinematic run that saw it become both the fastest animated film to reach $1 billion at the global box office and the 10th highest grossing film of all time, Disney has wasted no time in revealing details of the film’s home entertainment release. And the good news for the film’s legion of fans is that as well as not having to wait too long to see the film in the comfort of their own living room, they can also expect its physical media release to be accompanied by a wealth of all-new original bonus features.\n\nThe film arrives at digital retailers Prime Video, Apple TV and Fandango At Home on August 20, before then appearing on 4K Blu-ray, Blu-ray and DVD on September 10. The 4K Blu-ray version that I’m most interested in here will be available as a limited-edition collectable SteelBook release. [UPDATE: Since first publishing this article, Disney has confirmed that the limited edition SteelBook will be the only 4K Blu-ray option for Inside Out 2 in the US.]\n\nThe 4K Blu-ray master will, as you would expect, feature a high dynamic range (HDR) grade to go with its Ultra HD resolution, along with a Dolby Atmos soundtrack (unlike the HD Blu-ray release, which drops to a 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio track).\n\nThe film will be presented in a 2.39:1 aspect ratio throughout, and will ship on a 66GB 4K Blu-ray disc. Not using a 100GB disc should on this occasion not represent a serious problem given that “Inside Out 2”s running time is a compact 96 minutes.\n\nTurning to the bonus features Disney/Pixar has put together for the 4K disc release of its blockbuster sequel, things kick off with a substantial “New Emotions” documentary looking at the whole process of creating the new Anxiety, Embarrassment, Ennui and Envy characters, taking in everything from design and animation to finding the right voice actors. This documentary will also explore the raft of secondary characters/emotions and scenes that ultimately didn’t make the final cut.\n\nThere’s a fun-sounding bit of innovation in play with the second bonus feature to find itself onto the “Inside Out 2” 4K Blu-ray, too. Called Unlocking The Vault, it’s described as a kind of visual commentary where a group of the film’s key creatives sit together watching and discussing the film’s ‘The Vault’ scene, pausing and restarting the action as they discuss everything from the inspiration for different elements in the scene to story development and the technical challenges associated with creating 2D characters that exist in the CG world of a teenager’s mind.\n\nWrapping the extra features up are a series of five deleted scenes - including, intriguingly, an alternate opening that would have seen a now 13-year-old Riley awkwardly fumbling her way through an original song she’d written for a school audition.\n\nThe other deleted scenes show Joy worrying she might be malfunctioning after momentarily being unable to drive the ‘brain console’; Riley’s ‘Anxiety’ morphing into domineering ‘Self-Loathing’ after she tries too hard to be fun at an older teen’s party; a puberty themed amusement park sequence where Joy and the others’ rogue emotions are chased by mind worker cops; and a game of Never Have I Ever that goes too far, wreaking havoc in Riley’s mind.\n\n—\n\nRelated Reading\n\nDisney Unveils ‘Kingdom Of The Planet Of The Apes’ 4K Blu-ray Details\n\nDisney Announces 4K Blu-ray Releases For Four More Marvel And Star Wars Original Series"
