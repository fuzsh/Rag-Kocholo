Worldwide Grand Release on January 9th, 2026.”\n\nMore about NTR Neel\n\nJr NTR and Prashanth’s film was announced on the former’s birthday in 2022. Shooting is expected to commence in September this year after the actor wraps up shooting for Devara: Part 1. The rest of the cast and crew of the film is yet to be announced. There’s speculation that the film will be titled Dragon but that’s yet to be confirmed.\n\nFans were thrilled about the announcement, and one fan wrote, “The most awaited project.” Another wrote, “Sankrathi Release 2026.” Some fans even decoded the poster, with some of them writing, “Poster lo Unna Hidden Words - 1969, Gold, Bhutan, Pakistan, China, India.” Some thought maybe the film would be linked to KGF, “Ee twist entraa 1969 ani. KGF Link. (What is this twist with 1969 written. KGF link.)”\n\nUpcoming work"
