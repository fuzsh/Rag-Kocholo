        "text": "Trafalgar Releasing and Mercury Studios have set a September 26 release for documentary One Hand Clapping, an opportunity for audiences to step back in time to 1974 with Paul McCartney and Wings.\n\nThe behind-the-scenes look delves into the making of the acclaimed One Hand Clapping album featuring rare footage, interviews with the band, insights from the creative team, and iconic Wings hits.\n\n“It’s so great to look back on that period and see the little live show we did. We made a pretty good noise actually! It was a great time for the band, we started to have success with Wings, which had been a long time coming, said McCartney, whose exclusive filmed introduction will kick off the screenings along with previously unseen Polaroid photographs from the recording sessions.\n\nThe full documentary directed by David Litchfield will include previously unreleased Backyard Sessions, showcasing McCartney on acoustic guitar performing beloved tracks from his catalog. Highlights include the previously unreleased song Blackpool and covers of personal favorites like “Twenty Flight Rock,” the song he played for John Lennon during their first meeting.\n\n“We are looking forward to bringing the legendary music of Paul McCartney to the big screen and offering fans a front-row seat to his enduring legacy,” said Trafalgar Releasing CEO Marc Allenby. “This cinematic experience will transport audiences back to a golden era of rock and roll while captivating new fans with the magic of this iconic band. It’s a must-see event for music lovers of all generations.”\n\nAmy Freshwater, VP of Acquisitions secured the film alongside Will White, SVP of Content Sales for Mercury Studios.\n\nOriginally shot on 1970s videotape, the footage has been scanned and restored in 4K. The dialogue has been de-mixed using Wingnut’s MAL software and the film features a new Dolby Atmos audio mix by Steve Orchard and Giles Martin.\n\nOne Hand Clapping showcased Wings’ new line-up, fresh off their return from Nashville where they recorded the classic single “Junior’s Farm.” Following the sudden departure of Denny Seiwell and Henry McCullough the previous year on the eve of recording the Wings masterpiece, released the year previously, Band on the Run, Paul (vocals, bass, piano, electric piano, Hammond organ, celeste, harmonium, acoustic guitar), Linda (Moog, electric piano, Mellotron, tambourine, backing vocals) and Denny Laine (vocals, electric guitar, acoustic guitar, bass) were now joined by guitarist Jimmy McCulloch and drummer Geoff Britton.\n\nAdditionally joining the band in the studio were orchestral arranger Del Newman and saxophonist Howie Casey, who had previously played with McCartney in Hamburg and would go on to join the Wings touring band.\n\nThe film features live-in-studio renditions of Wings classics, including “Live and Let Die,” “Band on the Run,” “Jet” and “My Love.” McCartney talks about how much he likes working in a band, his writing process and how he thought at 14 he might have a future as a cabaret singer. He is seen performing side by side with Linda McCartney."
