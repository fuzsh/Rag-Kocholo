        "text": "Topline\n\nThe author of one of the most successful book and film franchises of the 21st century will add another novel to the “Hunger Games” series next year titled “Sunrise on the Reaping,” her publisher announced Thursday, and a film adaptation of the book has already been confirmed for release in late 2026.\n\nKey Facts\n\nGet Forbes Breaking News Text Alerts: We’re launching text message alerts so you'll always know the biggest stories shaping the day’s headlines.

The book is set to come out March 18, 2025 and the movie is scheduled for Nov. 20, 2026.\n\nBig Number\n\n$1.45 billion. That’s how much the first four “Hunger Games” movies, based on the original trilogy of young adult novels, grossed at the domestic box office. \"The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes,\" which was released in November, grossed another $166.4 million.\n\nKey Background\n\n\"The Hunger Games\" franchise fits into a trend of successful young adult novels-turned-films that dominated pop culture in the 2000s and early 2010s and also included the \"Twilight,\" \"Harry Potter\" and \"Maze Runner\" series. The dystopian story follows Katniss Everdeen’s (Jennifer Lawrence) life in a post-apocalyptic nation called Panem where children are forced to compete in a televised fight to the death called the Hunger Games. The trilogy helped make Lawrence an A-list movie star and her red carpet chemistry with co-stars Liam Hemsworth and Josh Hutcherson fueled popularity both for the stars and the franchise. The films were nominated for hundreds of awards and won dozens, including People's Choice Awards, MTV Movie Awards and Grammy Awards. \"The Hunger Games\" was named one of Publishers Weekly's \"Best Books of the Year\" and was a New York Times Notable Children's Book in 2008. It went on to win the California Young Reader Medal.\n\nSurprising Fact\n\nTaylor Swift was one of several artists to win a Grammy Award for the song \"Safe & Sound\" from the soundtrack of \"The Hunger Games.\" The song won the award for Best Song Written for Visual Media at the 2013 awards.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nAP NewsSuzanne Collins is releasing a new 'Hunger Games' novel, 'Sunrise on the Reaping,' next yearForbesThe Hunger Games: Inside The NumbersForbesNew 'Hunger Games' Prequel Faces Franchise's Worst Average Reviews-Ahead Of Expected $50 Million Opening"
