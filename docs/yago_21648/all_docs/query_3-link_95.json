        "text": "You do not even need to take a look at all the upcoming Dwayne Johnson movies on the horizon to know that the entertainer otherwise known as \"The Rock\" has come a long way as an actor. The WWE star would make his acting debut as his own father, Rocky Johnson, on an episode of That '70s Show before originating the role of the Scorpion King in his first movie, The Mummy Returns.\n\nThe numerous Dwayne Johnson movies heading to theaters or on streaming in the near future sound like they will be keeping the multi-hyphenate busy for a while. Some of The Rock's upcoming movies might take some time to come out due to various circumstances, but this guide will help you keep track of all we have to look forward to on our upcoming 2024 schedule, as well as our upcoming 2025 schedule, and even beyond then, too.\n\nRed One (November 15, 2024)\n\nSet for a November 2024 release is Red One, which, being The Rock's upcoming Christmas action movie, has no connection to Red Notice. However, it is another action-comedy pairing the actor with a Marvel star (Chris Evans) and some fellow DC movie actors (Academy Award winner and Justice League star J.K. Simmons donning a beard as Old St. Nick and Shazam! Fury of the Gods' Lucy Liu).\n\nJohnson's Jumanji movies director Jake Kasdan is helming the project, which sees his and Evans' characters teaming up to rescue Old St. Nick, and also stars Kiernan Shipka, Nick Kroll, and Bonnie Hunt as Mrs. Claus. Red One was penned by Chris Morgan (known for writing many of the Fast and Furious movies) from a story by Johnson’s producing partner, Hiram Garcia.\n\nMoana 2 (November 27, 2024)\n\nIn February 2024, Disney CEO Bob Iger made waves with the surprise announcement that a direct, animated sequel to Moana is on its way. Originally developed as a TV show, the story was reworked as a feature that will be released later this year on November 27.\n\nJohnson, who returns as the voice of Maui, appeared at CinemaCon 2024 in Las Vegas to present footage of Moana 2. The actor and producer also teased an \"all new crew, all new setting and, of course, all new songs,\" before concluding with a signature, \"You're welcome.\"\n\nMoana (July 10, 2026)\n\nIn addition to Moana 2, Johnson is also producing a live-action update of the animated film about a young Polynesian woman seeking to absolve her island of a terrible curse. The remake is set to come out in July 2026.\n\nThe actor is also reprising the role of Maui, which is a relief because we cannot imagine him allowing anyone else to play a role as personal to him as this. However, while Auliʻi Cravalho is executive producing the live-action Moana, 17-year-old Australian actor Catherine Laga’aiathe is succeeding the title role.\n\nFast X: Part 2 (2026)\n\nFor years, it looked like the 2019 spin-off, Fast and Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw was the last we would see of Johnson in the role of Luke Hobbs, considering the actor's beef with Vin Diesel from behind the scenes. However, it looks like that is all about to change.\n\nFollowing his surprise Fast X cameo in the post-credits tag, Johnson confirmed in an X post (then called a \"tweet\") with an included video he filmed himself from Hawaii that he is returning to the long-running, action-packed franchise. \"Put your funderwear on\" and prepare to see more of Hobbs in the eleventh Fast and Furious movie, Fast X: Part 2, which is set to come out sometime in 2026.\n\nMonster Jam (TBA)\n\nIn addition to his sequel to and live-action remake of Moana, Johnson has another upcoming Disney movie in the works that seems perfectly on brand for the action movie star. Variety reports that he announced at 2024's D23 Expo that he is developing a movie based on Monster Jam, which he teases is going to be \"a heck of a ride.\"\n\nThe Smashing Machine (TBA)\n\nThe professional wrestler's acting career includes a few athletically themed projects, but his next sports movie, The Smashing Machine, will see him take on one of his darkest roles yet as Mark Kerr. The upcoming A24 movie and solo directorial debut of Benny Safdie — whose brother, Josh, has his own A24 sports biopic in the works called Marty Supreme — will chronicle the career of the MMA legend and his struggles with addiction.\n\nThe production company posted a first-look on X, revealing a nearly unrecognizable Johnson in character with his Jungle Cruise co-star, Emily Blunt, outside the ring as Kerr's wife, Dawn Staples. A July X post from YVRShoots Tweets reported that The Smashing Machine wrapped production in Vancouver.\n\nRed Notice 2 (TBA)\n\nThe record-breaking success of 2021's Netflix original movie Red Notice is not too surprising when you consider the star power behind it: Deadpool's Ryan Reynolds, fellow DCEU movies star Gal Gadot, and Dwayne Johnson. It was also no surprise when the platform announced it was planning a sequel or two to Rawson Marshall Thurber's action-comedy began brewing in 2022.\n\nIn case there was any uncertainty regarding the fate of Red Notice 2, in 2023, Gadot claimed to Collider that the sequel is still very much in active development with all three lead Red Notice cast members game to return. There is no word on when the film will hit theaters or become available with a Netflix subscription, but a 2024 release on Netflix might be out of the question at this point.\n\nJungle Cruise 2 (TBA)\n\nJohnson's strong, long-standing relationship with Disney included a starring role in a movie based on a theme park attraction, namely Jungle Cruise. Well, it appears that the 2021 adventure film was just the beginning of his time as Captain Frank Wolff.\n\nJungle Cruise 2 was announced as in development shortly after the release of the first one, which also starred Emily Blunt as Lily Houghton, but with few updates since. While on the 2024 Oscars red carpet, The Rock told Variety that the sequel could \"possibly\" happen \"down the line,\" meaning that nothing is set in stone just yet.\n\nJumanji 4 (TBA)\n\nYears after Robin Williams, Kirsten Dunst, and others played a mystical board game in Joe Johnston's adaptation of Chris Van Allsburg's children's book, Dwayne Johnson and others revived the property in a whole new way in 2017 with director Jake Kasdan's Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle. Two years later, Johnson returned as Dr. Smolder Bravestone in Jumanji: The Next Level, and it looks like we have not seen the last of him and his fellow video game avatars.\n\nIn October 2022, Hiram Garcia told Collider that a fourth Jumanji movie is \"definitely going to happen,\" which Kevin Hart reflected in an Oscars red carpet conversation with Variety the following March. So, the return to the jungle appears imminent, but when remains a mystery for now.\n\nSan Andreas 2 (TBA)\n\nIn 2015, Johnson teamed up with Carla Gugino to rescue their very resilient onscreen daughter, played by Alexandra Daddario, in the aftermath of a devastating Los Angeles earthquake in San Andreas. After earning $473 million worldwide, a sequel was soon greenlit, but the last major update we heard was in late 2021.\n\nHiram Garcia then told ScreenRant they were “working hard” on cracking a new story (no pun intended). Daddario has also expressed interest in reprising her role, but the possibility of San Andreas 2 happening at all seems to rely on Johnson's availability.\n\nBig Trouble in Little China (TBA)\n\nBack in 2015, Johnson confirmed plans to make a new version of Big Trouble in Little China, promised to be a continuation of one of the best John Carpenter movies that won't feature the actor as Kurt Russell's iconic protagonist: unlikely hero, Jack Burton. The actor has been saying all the right things about respecting the source material and honoring the work of both Carpenter and Russell, though neither of those guys are totally cool with the idea of the film being revisited.\n\nThe last we heard about the project was in mid-2021 when Hiram Garcia told Collider that, like the San Andreas sequel, they are still trying to figure out the proper way to continue the story of the original cult classic. In 2023, James Wan told EW that he and his frequent collaborator, Patrick Wilson, are interested in making their own BTLC reboot, so we'll just have to see who crosses the finish line first.\n\nThe King (TBA)\n\nOne of the coolest things about Johnson's career is the work that he has done to bring more attention to Samoan culture — honoring his own roots and teaching audiences about people who don't get a lot of focus in pop culture. Titles that stand out in this regard are the aforementioned Moana and 2019's Fast and Furious spin-off, Hobbs & Shaw. However, he will soon have the opportunity to bring a real piece of history to the big screen.\n\nIn 2018, The Rock made a deal to team up with directors Husain El-Minbawi and Academy Award winner Robert Zemeckis to make The King — a biopic that will star Johnson as King Kamehameha and follow his mission in the late 18th century to unite the islands of Hawaii. This is the kind of project that we expect Johnson will work hard to get made, but exactly when he will have time to do it is currently unknown."
