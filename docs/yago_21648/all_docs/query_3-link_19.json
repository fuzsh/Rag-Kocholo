        "text": "Warren Miller’s 75th Film\n\nThe new film from Warren Miller entitled “75” will celebrate the historic anniversary with emerging athletes and storytelling that will set the tone for the next 75 years.\n\nThis fall will mark the 75th anniversary of the Warren Miller film legacy. When the first film from Warren Miller debuted in 1949, it ignited a new genre of filmmaking for the snowsports industry. Today, Warren Miller films have captured the stories of skiers and riders from every edge of the winter world and continue to gather audiences each fall to celebrate the start of the season.\n\nAppropriately titled “75,” this year’s film is the second installment in the two-year celebration of this momentous anniversary. Last year, viewers relived the hills, ski trends, icons, and innovators that defined winter sports for over seven decades with Warren Miller’s ALL TIME. This year, viewers can expect to discover new, rising talent and storytelling that focuses on the future of the sport with Warren Miller’s “75.”\n\n“75” is comprised of entirely new footage filmed and produced by Warren Miller Entertainment, including five segments in collaboration with producers whose careers were inspired by Warren’s innovative filmography. Contributing producers include X Games host Selema Masekela, the Finnish-based production group Real SkiFi, plus Sherpas Cinema, Technically Doing It, andFramework. The production mix showcases a new film model that is both inclusive and forward-thinking while setting the tone for the next 75 years of ski and snowboard filmmaking.\n\n\"The film showcases a diverse mix of snowsports icons, Olympic hopefuls, and emerging talents,\" said Josh Haskins, Warren Miller Producer. “It's unlike anything we've crafted before and is poised to ignite excitement and winter stoke in theaters nationwide this fall.\"\n\nThe 75th Warren Miller Film Tour will kick off on October 15, 2024 with a special World Premiere sneak preview screening at the Boulder Theater, near the company’s headquarters in Boulder, Colorado. This celebration will include a street-festival style party and screening event on what would have been Warren Miller’s 100th birthday. With a nod to the founding father, the premiere will launch the nearly 100-city North American film tour.\n\nThis year’s film lineup features 10 all-new segments that will deliver 90 minutes of unbelievable action and unexpected stories. The film will take fans to powder stashes and chutes around the world, from Canada, Colorado, California, and Utah to Finland, Japan, Austria, and New Jersey. (Yes, even New Jersey.)\n\nThe lineup for Warren Miller’s “75” is nothing more than stacked, with top athletes like snowboarders Shaun White, Zeb Powell, Toby Miller, Danny Davis, and 15-year-old phenom LJ Henriquez, plus skiers Max Hitzig, Lexi duPont, Caite Zeliff, Aaron Blunck, Alex Ferreira, Cassie Sharpe, and many more.\n\nFilm Tour Details\n\nWarren Miller’s 75th film tour will premiere in Boulder, Colorado at the Boulder Theater on October 15th, followed by over 300 cities across North America and internationally. Warren Miller ski and snowboard films are regarded as the annual start to winter for skiers and snowboarders across the globe, and attendees can expect premium prize drawings at each event, athlete appearances, interactive sponsor activations, and a gathering of the snowsports community that cannot be matched at any other winter event.\n\nAn exclusive ticket presale will begin on September 5, 2024 for all current and new Outside+ members with a 25% discount, followed by general public tickets going on sale starting September 12, 2024.\n\nFor more information about the tour, including the tour schedule, visit warrenmiller.com.\n\nThe 75th annual Warren Miller film is proudly supported in partnership with Backcountry.com, High West Whiskey, adidas TERREX, Columbia, Palisades Tahoe, and Alterra.\n\nAbout Warren Miller Entertainment\n\nWarren Miller Entertainment has been a pioneer in action sports cinematography since 1949. “75” is the 75th installment of its feature film library.
