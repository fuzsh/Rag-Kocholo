The perception that foreigners were ‘stealing’ jobs was one of the triggers for the rioting and attacks on black and minority ethnic communities in British port cities.\n\nUse this lesson to find out more about the 1919 race riots in Cardiff and Liverpool.

In 1919, a series of violent riots in Glasgow, South Shields, Salford, London, Hull, Newport, Barry, Liverpool and Cardiff saw street fights, vandalised properties and five people killed. Thousands-strong white working-class crowds in these port towns directed their anger at black and minority ethnic communities, blaming colonial workers – whose numbers had increased to meet war time shipping needs – for post-war job shortages.\n\nThe sense of menace and the lingering effects of racism continued into the 1920s was most evident in the comments of the immigration official E.N. Cooper, who wrote to the Home Office after visiting an employment centre for seamen: ‘…we found ourselves the only white men in a surging sea of 500 negroes pressing around us offering their services, assuming that I was the ship’s captain who had come into the room to engage a crew’ (HO 45/11897/332087/100).\n\nThe 1919 riots were one of the most severe incidents of unrest in 20th century Britain. Known as ‘race riots’, they came to national prominence via the newspapers of the day, making many aware of the presence of black and minority ethnic communities in Britain. The coverage was often hostile and racist in tone, suggesting that the problem of communities unable to mix was long-standing.\n\nHowever, census records from 1911 provide a more complex picture. While there were occasional incidents of racial tension, reports testify to a spirit of co-habitation as mariners of many different races and cultures settled with White British women to bring up their families. Before the war, major port cities like Cardiff and Liverpool were international trading centres and home to established black and minority ethnic seafaring communities. They expanded during the war as workers from the colonies were recruited to meet increased demands from shipping. When peace came, the shipping industry contracted and all British workers were affected, including White merchant sailors returning to their home ports after serving in the armed forces. Inflammatory press reports at the time, however, traced the outbreak of the Cardiff riots to widespread racist attitudes towards mixed-race couples, as much as to resentment about rising unemployment.\n\nIn February 1919, the Home Office responded to concerns about rising levels of unemployment in British seaports by launching a repatriation scheme to return black and Arab colonial workers to their countries of origin. Local repatriation committees were established in port towns that had experienced riots to promote the scheme. Despite penalties for not taking part, many refused to participate, feeling Britain was their home. The continuing crisis led the government to offer £5 plus £1 voyage allowances to anyone who participated. The Colonial Office, however, were keen that married couples where the husband was black and the wife white should not be repatriated, fearing it would upset the existing social order in the colonies they were removed to.\n\nOn one level it was matters of ethnicity that triggered the ‘race’ riots. However, the historian Jacqueline Jenkinson urges caution in seeing the riots as purely a matter of racism and prejudice. She asserts that time and place are very important to keep in mind. In South Shields, Glasgow and Hull, job competition just after the war played a significant role in the disturbances. In Cardiff and Liverpool, where there were far larger and more settled black and Arab communities, race played a more significant role, fuelled by concerns in the media and amongst the public about interracial relationships.\n\nIn addition, any analysis of the rioting in 1919 and its fallout needs to take into account other factors. These include:\n\nThe post-war psychological trauma of returning service personnel.\n\nThe significant financial depression, which saw a spike in unemployment.\n\nThe expansion of the franchise (the right to vote), which meant that politicians needed to placate working class voters at the same time as meeting the threat of increasing industrial militancy and the fear of Bolshevik revolution.\n\nWomen were emboldened by their experience of war service, leading to significant changes for post-war society.\n\nFinally, the ill-defined nature of Britishness further fuelled disputes as to who was British and who was not.\n\nTeachers' notes\n\nThe focus of this lesson concerns the riots that took place in Cardiff and Liverpool in 1919. The lesson is designed to support students following a thematic study on race and immigration and attitudes towards ethnic minorities from 1919 onwards. The lesson introduces students to different historical sources – from the census, the Home Office and the Colonial Office – to evaluate how significant a factor race was in these riots.\n\nPlease note these sources include some racist and abusive language and are presented here to accurately represent a historical narrative. This language wasn’t acceptable at the time and isn’t acceptable today.\n\nTo explore the diverse social context of Butetown in Cardiff, students can first examine extracts from the 1911 census. These provide evidence of interracial marriage and religious tolerance. Through a police letter on the Cardiff riots, students can then explore the possible social and economic causes of the riots.\n\nStudents can continue by comparing these to similar earlier riots in Liverpool, using a letter from the Head Constable to the Home Office. Subsequent Home Office sources provide further context on race relations and employment, in addition to sources from the Colonial Office, which include a telegram from the Cardiff Seamen’s Boarding Housekeepers Association and a Home Office letter about seamen’s lodging houses. The final sources explore debates about the issue of eugenics from the Medical Research Council, as well as the personal story of a seaman as told in a source from the Colonial Office, which explores interracial marriage, racial attitudes and issues concerning repatriation.\n\nStudents can work in pairs or small groups to study each source and report back to the rest of the class to discuss their answers to the different tasks. Alternatively, they can work through the tasks independently. All sources are transcribed and the lesson includes a downloadable bibliography for further reading.\n\nYou may wish to explore the following extension questions with students:\n\nExtension questions\n\nWhy are the majority of these sources from the Home Office/Colonial Office?\n\nHow does your understanding of the sources in this lesson help explain the image of the plaque used at the top of the webpage?\n\nHow could the census returns be used to explore causes of tension within Butetown or between Butetown and the wider British public after the First World War?\n\nHow can the census be used to discuss topics such as the occupations of women, religious tolerance, co-existence of different religious communities, and intermarriage of different cultures and races?\n\nWhat might the impact of interracial marriage have been on port society at that time?\n\nWhat other sources could you use to explore the causes and events of the 1919 race riots?\n\nConnections to curriculum\n\nEdexcel A level History\n\nBritain transformed, 1918–97 Race and immigration: immigration policies and attitudes towards ethnic minorities, 1918–39.\n\nSources\n\nBanner image: Close-up of the plaque to Charles Wooten at Queens Dock, Liverpool.
