        "text": "Hocus Pocus 3 is officially in the works, with the Sanderson Sisters potentially returning for a new adventure.\n\nThe new movie is being created with \"full idealism,\" according to screenwriter Jen D'Angelo. \"We're still in the story phase; we're still working on it,\" she told EW in October 2023.\n\n\"We've been working on some ideas, and it's been fun to dive back into that world and we have so many directions in which to go and so many new characters to explore,\" D'Angelo added, revealing her interest in expanding on Hannah Waddingham's character for the next movie.\n\nHowever, we're still no closer to finding out when we'll be able to see the movie on .\n\nDisney boss Sean Bailey confirmed that Hocus Pocus 3 was in the works in June 2023, following the long-awaited sequel being a hit on the streaming service. Hocus Pocus 2's director, Anne Fletcher, is returning for the new movie, according to TheWrap.\n\nWhile the ending of Hocus Pocus 2 feels definitive, there was a credit scene that opened the door for the Sanderson sisters to make a comeback.\n\nSo, will there be a Hocus Pocus 3? Here's everything you need to know so far. Be warned, major spoilers for Hocus Pocus 2 follow.\n\nHocus Pocus 3 potential release date: When could Hocus Pocus 3 be released?\n\nAs mentioned above, Disney has confirmed Hocus Pocus 3, but we still don't have an official release date.\n\nHopefully, we won't have to wait another 29 years for a new Hocus Pocus movie, though. There's a small chance we could see it on Halloween 2024, so it's likely heading for a Halloween 2025 release, but all we can do is wait for further news.\n\nHocus Pocus 3 cast: Who will return for Hocus Pocus 3?\n\nDespite how the sequel ended (more on that in a bit), it's impossible to imagine Hocus Pocus 3 happening without Bette Midler, Sarah Jessica Parker and Kathy Najimy back as the Sanderson sisters.\n\nAccording to sequel star Whitney Peak, who was speaking to EW: \"They can always come back. It would be hard to create a third movie without the Sanderson Sisters, because it's their movie. They are Hocus Pocus. It's hard to imagine what a movie would be like without them.\"\n\nHowever, while Najimy has teased that they'll never say never, she also said that the three stalwarts felt like they had finished with the roles.\n\n\"I feel like we're done,\" she said. \"We've pulled every story you could pull out of this. I guess, never say never, but I feel grateful that we got to do it again. I don't know that there are plans for a third one.\"\n\nAt the time of Hocus Pocus 2's release, one Sanderson sister, Bette Midler, hinted that she would consider a return.\n\nMidler revealed: \"If there was a third one, of course I'd sign on, but I don't know how. I can't imagine what the story would be, but I love Winifred, Sarah, Mary, and our relationship. It's good for women.\n\n\"We stick together through hell and high water, but we do cause mayhem, and not many women cause that much mayhem!\"\n\nIf there is a third movie, Doug Jones' Billy Butcherson likely won't return. He went on to the afterlife when Winnie disappeared at the end of the movie – her curse finally broken.\n\nGiven there aren't any other deaths, any of the cast of Hocus Pocus 2 could return, including Whitney Peak as Becca, Belissa Escobedo as Izzy, Lilia Buckingham as Cassie, Sam Richardson, Tony Hale and others.\n\nAccording to screenwriter Jen D'Angelo, Hannah Waddingham could have a bigger role in the next movie. \"We've only scratched the surface of Hannah Waddingham's mother witch,\" she told EW in October 2023.\n\nThe young trio that led the sequel certainly seem keen for a return. \"If there's a third, I want one of us to get corrupted by the power. I just know it would be Cassie,\" Buckingham told EW.\n\nPeak, meanwhile, told Hollywood Life she was down for another movie. She even has an idea of how it would work.\n\n\"There was maybe potentially a second black flame candle [at the end of the movie], and somebody's going to have to light it,\" she said. \"Maybe it's my turn to put some kids in their place.\"\n\nMore excitingly, the OG stars who weren't in Hocus Pocus 2 have told EW they'd be up for appearing in a third film. Jason Marsden, who voiced Binx the cat, said he would \"absolutely\" join the threequel.\n\nVanessa Shaw, who played Allison, likewise wanted to return, saying: \"Yeah, it's such a fun story and, obviously, having us reminisce about this makes it that much more fun, and the fondness keeps growing.\"\n\nOmri Katz, who played Max, added in June 2023 after the threequel was announced: \"Yes, I would return if Disney approached me. It would be an honour to return, hopefully with some of my fellow castmates, and make a fun addition to the franchise!\"\n\nHocus Pocus 3 plot: How does Hocus Pocus 2 set up a third movie?\n\nThe second movie resurrects the Sisters thanks to Becca lighting the Black Flame candle in the woods with her friend Izzy.\n\nWhile the candle was destroyed at the end of the movie, the post-credit scene reveals that there is another candle. We see Gilbert's (Richardson) cat bounding around the shop before coming to rest in front of a box with the label \"BF #2 candle\", implying a second one exists.\n\nHowever, the wrinkle in this one is that the Sanderson sisters do not meet their end by falling victim to the curse that makes them disappear at sunrise on November 1. Instead, Mary and Sarah are victims of the spell that Winnie casts to grant herself total power.\n\nWinnie asks Becca, a new witch, to cast a spell to reunite them. But instead of it bringing Mary and Sarah back, it sends Winnie on to wherever they are – presumably some kind of afterlife.\n\nWhether another Black Flame candle can call them back from the afterlife remains to be seen, but it would certainly lessen the dramatic arc achieved in the sequel. We have to hope that the third movie will take a wholly new direction.\n\n\"It's an open-ended movie. So much could happen next. Both extremes, too,\" Peak told EW. \"If there is a next movie, we could be our coven, much older, but the Sanderson Sisters could come back, and we'd have to kick their asses again.\"\n\nHocus Pocus 3 trailer: Any Hocus Pocus 3 footage yet?\n\nUnfortunately not. We can't even summon any, as Hocus Pocus 3 hasn't started filming yet, even though it has been confirmed.\n\nBookmark this page for when those updates come rolling in."
