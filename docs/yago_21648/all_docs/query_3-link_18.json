        "text": "A Houma movie producer debuted his feature length film based on his own life and shot in the city.\n\nDirector Brandon Stouff’s movie “Dear Kate” is about a reclusive runaway who reunites with her family at her father’s funeral, and all the baggage and fallout that comes afterward. Stouff wrote the movie between 2015 and 2016. It was filmed during the COVID pandemic, released July 29 of this year, and just came to the streaming platform Tubi. The film features notable locations like Houma’s courthouse, Downtown Jeaux’s, Bayou Canes Sports Bar, the Houma Civic Center, Indigo Boutique and the water fountain memorial park.\n\nAccording to Stouff, it was a very personal film, and drew from many of his own experiences.\n\n“The story, basically, is a blueprint of my life. I had issues with stepmoms. I left Houma for nine years while I was in the military. Came back and realized that I’ve changed and not everyone else has changed,” he said. “If you laid the timeline of the movie over my life, it basically matches up one-for-one.”\n\nThe movie can be watched in full on Tubi here: https://tubitv.com/movies/100025720/dear-kate.\n\nStouff said, like Kate, he too was reclusive, but as he filmed her story arc, he changed with her. This was because he had to leave his home to go on location and meet with the cast and crew. He described filmmaking as therapeutic.\n\n“It’s an outlet for me. I can tell stories through the visual medium, but it also started breaking me out of my shell, because in order to get a location like Downtown Jeaux, I had to go there and talk to the people at Downtown Jeaux,” he said with a laugh. “I had to break myself out of it. Do I still struggle with it? Absolutely.”\n\nHis production company is named after overcoming that challenge: Hardest Step.\n\nWhile drawing from his own life, Stouff said he chose to make the main character a woman because he wrote the parts with certain actors and actresses in mind. Stouff’s wife and friends looked over the piece to ensure its accuracy to the character, but her struggles begin from a universality, her upbringing.\n\nKate flees this environment, and eventually struggles with alcoholism, grief and tension as she reunites with the family.\n\nOne of Kate’s supporting figures is Auntie May, a close friend of the family. A cafeteria manager and stage actress, Regina Franklin plays the part. It was her first experience in a movie.\n\nShe said Auntie May reminds Kate to keep calm and remain positive,\n\n“I was more like the positive role model for her,” Franklin said.\n\nFranklin described seeing herself on the big screen as \"amazing,\" and said she plans to continue to pursue acting in movies.\n\n“It’s really indescribable right now. It just felt like a dream come true… I’ve been wanting this forever. I’m calling family saying ‘I’m on television!’” she said.\n\nFranklin would like to become a full-time actress.\n\n“I will be 59 in November, and my dream has never died,\" she said. \"It’s only getting stronger, and it’s something that I will pursue.”\n\nApril Pinell is the movie’s main antagonist, Darla, Kate’s stepmother. Darla’s jealousy towards Kate creates the central tension of the story. Pinell said she tried to portray a sense of greed and a desire for attention in the character.\n\nDuring a Q&A session at the premiere, Pinell said a speaker said the performance made her want to slap Pinell.\n\n“It’s a part of acting,” she said. “I’m not like that in real life.”\n\nThis also was Pinell’s first time being in a movie, and like Franklin, she has her roots in stage performances. A dental assistant, Pinell said she’d like to pursue more roles, but with her work and being a mother, time is strapped.\n\n“It’s a hard industry to really grasp and get into, because of the time,” she said. “I would love to pursue something more in the future, but we’ll see.”"
