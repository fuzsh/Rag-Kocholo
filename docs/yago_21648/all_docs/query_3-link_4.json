        "text": "One Hand Clapping, the film capturing Paul McCartney and Wings tour rehearsals at Abbey Road studios for Band on the Run, is finally getting a wide theatrical release. Worldwide screenings of the movie begin on September 26, and the updated version of the film will feature a new introduction by McCartney as well as the famous “backyard session” where the former Beatle covers Buddy Holly songs on an acoustic guitar. “It’s so great to look back on that period and see the little live show we did,” McCartney said in a statement. “We made a pretty good noise actually! It was a great time for the band, we started to have success with Wings, which had been a long time coming.” The release of the film version of One Hand Clapping compliments the release of the movie soundtrack album that came out earlier this year.
