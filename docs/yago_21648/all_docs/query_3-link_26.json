In the U.K., Pocket.watch and Sunlight worked directly with Vue, one of the U.K.’s largest theater chains.\n\n“Ryan’s World the Movie: Titan Universe Adventure” follows Ryan on an epic journey. When his twin sisters, Emma and Kate, get sucked into a mystical comic book, Ryan steps up as the great big brother he is and jump in after them.\n\n“Adventures, battles and hilarious debacles ensue, as Ryan and his friends navigate the Titan Universe and bring everyone back home safely before his parents catch on,” according to a press statement.\n\nThe film is directed by Albie Hecht and produced by Shion Kaji and Loann Kaji. The executive producer is Chris M. Williams.\n\nThe animated sections of the film are produced by Shin-Ei Animation, the Japanese animation studio behind the popular anime series “Doraemon” and “Crayon Shinchan.”\n\nPocket.watch is a partner with more than 50 creators on YouTube and some of those creators star alongside the Kaji family in the movie, including Evangeline Lomelino of GEM Sisters as Aiden (1.3 million subscribers on YouTube and 700 million plus Lifetime Views across GEM channels), Dan Rhodes as himself (35.8 million followers across TikTok and YouTube garnering 17.5 billion views on YouTube alone, becoming the most viewed magician channel of all time on the platform; he was named YouTube Top 10 creator of 2022); and Stella Wallace of “The Stella Show” as Rylexa (1.8 million subscribers on YouTube and 1 billion plus Lifetime views).\n\n“The international expansion of ‘Ryan’s World the Movie: Titan Universe Adventure’ is a testament to the global appeal and influence of the cast’s massive global fandom,” Jeff Siegel, head of content distribution at Pocket.watch, said.\n\n“Offering families the chance to see their favorite digital stars in a whole new light is part of our ongoing commitment to bringing fresh and engaging content to the big screen landscape,” Johnny Carr, group distribution and event cinema manager at Vue, said.\n\nJim Sherry, CEO of Sherry Media Group, added: “This film represents a unique chapter for digital creator-driven content and we’re excited for families to enjoy this magical adventure on the big screen.”"
