        "text": "What do we know so far about Robbie Williams' 'Better Man'?\n\nThe film has been billed as 'a musical fantasy' and is being filmed in the Docklands Studios in Melbourne throughout 2022, and in the UK in 2023.\n\nBack in December 2021, director Michael Gracey made an official announcement that the Robbie Williams film was being made.\n\n\"To tell Robbie Williams’s beautiful, distinct story, back home, in my own city, is a dream come true,\" he enthused.\n\nRobbie Williams and his Dad: The fascinating story of the singing pair’s relationship\n\nHorrific moment Robbie Williams was pushed off-stage and broke down in tears\n\nNoel Gallagher dismisses 'Angels' by Robbie Williams as just \"Oasis by numbers\"\n\n\"There is a creative energy that burns across the Melbourne film industry, and I know this movie will thrive here.\"\n\nSimon Gleeson, Oliver Cole, and Gracey wrote the film's screenplay together and the Better Man's producers are Paul Currie, Gracey, Coco Xiaolu Ma, Jules Daly, and Craig McMahon.\n\nIn typical Robbie Williams style, the singer hasn't held back in revealing the ups and downs behind the making of the film.\n\nSpeaking about the biopic, Robbie said: \"The thing is about films is that it is a wonder anything gets made.\n\n\"Everything gets held up in a bottleneck. It is always, 'This person says no and this person says yes and this person is offended and this person is not offended enough.' It is agents and lawyers.\"\n\n'Better Man' soundtrack: What songs will be in the film?\n\nRobbie Williams interview: \"It's a miracle if I make the charts now\"\n\nInsiders are being secretive about what will appear on the soundtrack to the Robbie Williams movie.\n\nWith smash hits including 'Angels', 'She's The One', 'Supreme', 'Feel', 'Rock DJ' and many more to choose from, producers may be struggling to reduce them down to just a few!\n\nSpeaking to Deadline in 2021, Gracey confirmed the songs will be adapted for the film.\n\n“All Robbie’s songs will be re-sung, for the emotion of the moment,” he said.\n\nThe Story of... 'Angels' by Robbie Williams\n\nListen to the excellent Robbie Williams song from 'The Tiger Who Came to Tea'\n\nRobbie Williams' new song 'Electrico Romantico' is one of his catchiest yet\n\n\"If he’s in the depths of despair, he’s not going to sing a song as cabaret flamboyant showmanship; it’s going to be broken, acapella, stripped down, because that’s where he is emotionally. In moments of pure joy, you’ll get songs sung in this whirlwind of hysteria.\n\n\"So essentially every song in the film, Robbie will sing, but it will be performed for the emotion of that moment, and that scene.”\n\nRobbie Williams - Feel (Official Video)"
