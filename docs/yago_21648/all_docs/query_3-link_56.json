        "text": "Who the heck are you, anyway?\n\nThat was the first question I heard after The New York Times hired me as a film critic in the final weeks of 1999. A reporter from Variety found my home phone number and gave me a call — the late-20th-century equivalent of sliding into my DMs.\n\nIt was a reasonable thing to ask, and the simple answer was that I was a freelance book critic and youngish father of two small children. I had seen a lot of movies — plenty of people in those days had seen a lot of movies — and reviewed none of them for any publication. I was almost as puzzled as the guy on the phone about my sudden career swerve, and immeasurably more frightened. How could I be vain, dumb or deluded enough to believe that this was a job I could actually do?\n\nAnd now — more than 23 years later, the middle-aged father of two grown children and the author of 2,293 published film reviews — I’m done.\n\nThough I continued to dabble in literary criticism during my tenure on the movie beat, I’m ready to return to it full-time, as a critic at large for The New York Times Book Review, starting as soon as I find my reading glasses and rebuild my attention span. On my way out the door, as the final credits metaphorically roll, I thought I might try at long last to answer some of the questions I’ve heard most frequently over the years since that phone call.\n\nDid you always love movies?\n\nYes and no. I’ve often been infatuated by movies, but I’ve also frequently been frustrated, confused and enraged by them. Ambivalence isn’t neutrality; it’s the simultaneity of strong, opposed emotions, and I think it defines my experience as a critic. Sometimes I’ve hated movies; I’ve never been indifferent.\n\nMovies have been part of my dream life and my worldly education since my first traumatic encounter with the flying monkeys in “The Wizard of Oz.” I’m still in awe of their power (the movies, not the monkeys) — to conjure up intense emotions, to invent new worlds and to disclose unsuspected truths about the one we inhabit.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
