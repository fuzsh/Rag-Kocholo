        "text": "About the Event\n\nAs soon as the red light went out behind the last shot of the Rachmaninov set with Lukas Vondráček, it was clear what would happen next. The Johannes Brahms set. A little shorter, but no less intense in terms of intensity, expression and depth. Also the Bohuslav Martinů symphony belongs to the FOK with Tomas Brauner. This time it will be the Fifth Symphony, which was written about after its premiere in 1947: 'If this music in its vehemence, colour and power is representative of the way Bohuslav Martinů's countrymen feel, then this country will have the energy to recover quickly'."
