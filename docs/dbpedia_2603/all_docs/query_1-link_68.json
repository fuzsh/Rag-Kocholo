        "text": "Purcell, Handel, Haydn and Mendelssohn are being celebrated this year. And rightly so. But there's another composer whose anniversary also falls in 2009, and who, more than any of the above, deserves some much overdue exposure.\n\nBohuslav Martinů, who died 50 years ago, wrote more than 400 works of every type and genre. For some critics, herein lies the problem. His output, they say, is uneven (as if every work by Beethoven or Shostakovich were a masterpiece). Even more unjustified is a critical habit of labelling Martinů derivative, a charge that wilfully overlooks the composer's striking originality.\n\nAs the Czech principal conductor of the BBC Symphony Orchestra, Jiří Bělohlávek explains: \"I think the richness of styles in Martinů's work is due to his inextinguishable thirst for novelty and inspiration, and his ability to extract from many sources the right amount of elements into his own musical language. Martinů is also probably the most prolific Czech composer and, of course, you can find different levels of genius among them. But at his best, he is irresistibly original, cosmopolitan and Czech in one stroke.\"\n\nMartinů's life was as remarkable as his music. He was born in 1890 in Polička in the Bohemian-Moravian highlands, where his father was a cobbler, firewatcher and church bellringer. The family home was an apartment in the church tower and Bohuslav, a sickly child, seldom left its lofty confines for his first 12 years. His unusual childhood hugely influenced both his worldview and his often expansive music. He later described looking out from the tower upon a \"vast and boundless space I am always searching for in my music\".\n\nHis search began in Prague where, despite being expelled from the music conservatory for \"incorrigible negligence\", he went on to work as a second violinist in the Czech Philharmonic. Here he was exposed to the works of Debussy, who became a huge influence on his early compositions such as the dreamy, exotic song cycle Nipponari. At the same time, as the patriotic cantata Czech Rhapsody shows, Martinů consciously positioned himself within the Czech nationalist tradition of Smetana, Dvořák and Josef Suk (with whom he briefly studied). The creative tension between Martinů's profound Czechness and more cosmopolitan influences continued throughout his life, and provides a key to his wonderfully quirky musical language.\n\nIn 1923 Martinů moved to Paris. He immersed himself in all the latest avant-garde developments: dadaism, cubism, surrealism and, inevitably, the music of Stravinsky. Works from his early years in Paris include a surrealist opera, The Tears of the Knife, and a jazzy ballet score, La Revue de Cuisine, which features dancing kitchen utensils. Martinů's keen humour was also evident in The Revolt, a ballet in which musical notes call a strike, critics commit suicide and Stravinsky takes refuge on a desert island before a Moravian folk song saves the day.\n\nFor many of his compatriots, Martinů had become a French composer, but from the early 30s, he increasingly returned to his Czech roots for inspiration. Martinů loved visiting the landscapes of his childhood, where he became reacquainted with Bohemian and Moravian folk song. The stunningly beautiful adagio of his First Cello Concerto, for example, is liberally imbued with Czech folk melodies.\n\nMartinů's instrumental masterpiece of the late 1930s is the Double Concerto for Two String Orchestras, Piano and Timpani. This intense, highly wrought work reflects the two overriding tensions in the composer's life at the time: love for his young composition pupil, Vítězslava Kaprálová and fears of the impending Nazi occupation. Written at the Swiss home of his benefactor, Paul Sacher, this momentous piece was completed on the day of the Munich Agreement. Its first movement is replete with jazz rhythms, restless syncopations and free polyphony; the second is both defiant and phantasmal, as if evoking the shadow of nazism; and the third is a stirring, hymn-like address to the Czechs, bidding them courage in the face of oppression. The composer Arthur Honegger, who attended its Basle premiere, was stunned by its visceral appeal.\n\nThe same period produced the operatic masterpiece, Julietta, a work Bělohlávek conducts in a concert performance at the Barbican tonight. It is a surreal affair set in a town where \"the thread of memory has been cut\" and only one character has any sense of the past. Martinů's treatment of the subject is an enchanting, dreamlike fantasy, notable for its rhythmic variety, shifting harmonic textures and clearly etched vocal lines.\n\nBělohlávek regards the work as one of the composer's greatest achievements: \"In Julietta, Martinů was not only able to build and sustain the necessary dramatic thread of the surrealist story and libretto, but did so using his unique musical language with a brilliance and skill that can only fill us with admiration. His harmonic material is one of free tonality and the orchestration is very varied, witty and dramatically to the point. His use of piano in the orchestra is also significant. The spoken word also takes on an interesting role, with the composer using it in place of recitative ... For me, the most important quality is the fact that, despite the very exquisite and fantastical world already contained in the synopsis, it is Martinů's music that blends all the elements together and makes the opera a masterpiece.\"\n\nMagdalena Kožená, a fine interpreter of Martinů's rich legacy of songs, takes the title role. \"I have a very strong relationship with Martinů's music,\" she says, \"Like many Czech singers, his songs were some of the first I learned. He was certainly influenced by jazz and French music, but he never effaced his Czech roots; there's a strong Slavic flavour to every melody.\" Of the role of Julietta - one Kožená likens to that of Debussy's Mélisande - she says: \"I thought I'd never sing the role because it's really a soprano part, and if it were very much longer, it would be impossible. One thing that's special about this piece is the way the music builds up to very lyrical moments involving large orchestral forces, and then suddenly, everything stops and you're left with a simple vocal line and no accompaniment. Sure, the story is crazy, but that's another reason I love it.\"\n\nAfter 1938, Martinů never set foot in Czechoslovakia again. In 1940, with the German army only days away from Paris, he and his French wife, Charlotte, fled to the US. Now in his early 50s, Martinů had yet to write a symphony, but America was to give the composer a fresh creative spur. The five symphonies that followed at yearly intervals - and the extraordinary, otherworldly sixth, written seven years later - occupy a crucial position in Martinů's oeuvre and established his reputation in the US as the \"20th-century Dvořák\".\n\nBělohlávek who, with the BBC Symphony Orchestra, will present a complete cycle of the symphonies at the Barbican next season, explains the importance of the venture. \"Every time the orchestra and I have encountered Martinů's music,\" he says, \"both musicians and listeners have been surprised at the richness and variety of his musical language. The first five symphonies were written in a relatively short period of time, yet each one has a distinctive character. For today's orchestras, there are no great technical problems, although there's a need to recognise and emphasise certain melodic shapes within Martinů's seemingly mechanical rhythmical patterns. For the audience though, there's really only one challenge: to be eager enough to discover the extraordinary world of Martinů's music.\"\n\nThis summer, a Martinů gem from the last years of his life, the delightful comic opera Mirandolina, receives its British premiere at Garsington Opera. \"This anniversary year gives an ideal opportunity to raise his profile,\" says the company's general director, Anthony Whitworth-Jones. \"Martinů's best works stand up to comparison with Janáček, his great compatriot.\" Martin André, who will conduct the opera, offers an even more intriguing comparison: \"Martinů didn't fit into any box - Mirandolina is really a 20th-century version of The Barber of Seville with a punky orchestration.\"\n\nLater works, such as his Fifth Piano Concerto, The Parables and The Frescoes of Piero della Francesca, reveal a freer, more rhapsodic style. Mark Elder, who recently conducted the last work with the London Philharmonic Orchestra, is a fan of this lustrous, richly textured orchestral triptych. \"It is fascinatingly immediate music, harmonically spicy, melodic and very Czech,\" he says. \"I can hear various influences but I don't have a problem with that; it only means that when Martinů's own voice emerges, it's even more striking.\"\n\nBut the last word and plea for his music to remain in the spotlight must go to Martinů himself. \"Music must be beautiful,\" he wrote \"or it wouldn't be worth the effort.\""
