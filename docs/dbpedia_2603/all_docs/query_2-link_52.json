        "text": "HARALD GENZMER (1909-2007): Piano Concerto no. 1 · Cello Concerto Trombone Concerto\n\nOliver Triendl, piano Patrick Demenga, cello Jörgen van Rijen, trombone\n\nRundfunk-Sinfonieorchester Berlin · Ariane Matiakh\n\nC5330 PC: 21 845221053301\n\nHarald Genzmer was a composition pupil of Paul Hindemith in Berlin from 1928 to 1934. Whoever studies Genzmer’s enormous oeuvre in detail will recognize in the pupil’s music many Romantic gestures and a sensual imagination rarely occurring in the teacher’s works. What Genzmer adopted from his mentor was the masterly craftsmanship, an awareness of classicism and form and joy in performing in itself and in the colours of the most differing instruments.\n\nThe broadly educated scion of an academic family never regarded himself as a genius transcending boundaries, but as the servant of performers and the public: ‘Music should be zestful, artful and comprehensible. As practicable, it may win over the interpreter, and then the listener as graspable’. Musicians have always enjoyed performing Genzmer’s inspired music, which is affectionally adapted to the most varied instrumentations, and are now continuing to do so in increasing measure.\n\nWeitere Bilder\n\nWALTER BRAUNFELS\n\nCarnival Overture op. 22 · Two Hölderlin Songs op. 27 · Scottish Fantasy op. 47 · Prelude and Fugue op. 36\n\nBARBARA BUNTROCK · PAUL ARMIN EDELMANN · DEUTSCHE STAATSPHILHARMONIE RHEINLAND-PFALZ · GREGOR BÜHL\n\nC5308 PC: 21 845221053080\n\nWalter Braunfels is a composer whose music died twice: Once when the Nazis declared his music “degenerate art”. Then again when post-war Germany had little use for the various schools of tonal music; when the arbiters of taste considered any form of romantic music – almost the whole pre-war aesthetic – to be tainted. This 5th release of Capriccio’s Braunfels Edition shows again his large range of colorful music. From his first success in 1908 (Carnival Overture), a still unknown virtuoso Viola Concerto (Scottish Fantasy) to a strictly structured Prelude and Fugue – Braunfels Music is worth be discovered in our days.\n\nWeitere Bilder\n\nSCHÖNBERG: Kammersymphonie op. 9 · ZEMLINSKY: Maeterlinck-Gesänge op. 13 · BUSONI: Berceuse élégiaque op. 42\n\nASSOCIATION FOR PRIVATE MUSICAL PERFORMANCES\n\nZORYANA KUSHPLER · LINOS ENSEMBLE\n\nC5138 PC: 21 845221051383\n\nFounded in November 1918 by Arnold Schoenberg (1874–1951) and a few of his confidants, the Association for Private Musical Performances constituted perhaps the most progressive and most intensive opportunity for a select Viennese musical circle to familiarize themselves with contemporary and the latest works of the international composers’ scene in the immediate aftermath of the First World War and hence at the time of a dearth of a cultural spirit of optimism and innovation. Schoenberg had a close personal tie with many of the composers performed at the association concerts and sometimes even an amical one, as in the case of Zemlinsky. The association became a nursery for the entire modern music from Richard Strauss and Debussy to Webern, as far as the instrumentation of the works allowed.\n\nWeitere Bilder\n\nVICTOR BRUNS (1904-1996)\n\nChamber Music For Woodwinds\n\nMathias Baier · Alexander Voigt · Berthold Große · Sung Kwon You · Soloists of Rundfunk-Sinfonieorchester Berlin\n\n2CD-Set · C5327 PC: 21 845221053271\n\nCD 1:\n\n5 Pieces for bassoon and piano op. 12 (World Premiere Recording) · Wind Quintet op. 16 · 6 Pieces for contrabassoon and piano op. 80 · Sonata for bassoon and piano op. 20\n\nCD 2:\n\nLittle Suite no. 3 for 3 bassoons and contrabassoon op. 92 · Sonata for bassoon and piano no. 3 op. 86 · Quartet for woodwinds op. 18 · Sonata for bassoon and piano no. 2 op. 45 · 4 virtuoso pieces for bassoon solo op. 93\n\nVictor Bruns, born 1904 in Ollila in today’s Finland, wrote over 20 solo concertos, 50 chamber pieces and several ballet works. Bruns discovered the bassoon as his true vocation and moved to the Leningrad Conservatory in 1924, until he became bassoonist at Leningrad State Opera in 1927. Bruns completed his studies in composition with Vladimir Shtsherbatshov beside his work in the orchestra and he continued his compositional studies in 1946 with Boris Blacher. He worked as bassoonist of the Staatskapelle Berlin from 1946 until his retirement in 1969 and became a frequently performed composer, popular among musicians and audience alike far beyond the borders of the German Democratic Republic, whose works continue to deserve our attention. In 1960, Victor Bruns was awarded the Art Prize of the German Democratic Republic. In 1971, he was appointed an honorary member of the Berlin State Orchestra, and 20 years later the International Double Reed Society in the USA made him an honorary member.\n\nWeitere Bilder\n\nSCHUBERT: WINTERREISE\n\nBo Skovhus, baritone\n\nStefan Vladar, piano\n\nC5291 PC: 21 845221052915\n\n20 years ago, at the beginning of his career, the young baritone Bo Skovhus made his first recording of Schubert’s “Schöne Müllerin”. Now, as a famous opera and Lied interpreter he presents a new production of all 3 Schubert Cycles: “I’m very thankful to do this again. As a young men you do not reflect so much what happen. Now, when I’m older, I understand much more about. Especially for this cycle it’s important to have another point of view.” (Bo Skovhus)\n\nStefan Vladar, the famous Viennese pianist and his partner on the piano, shows us the virtuosity of the piano part in a new different light.\n\nWeitere Bilder\n\nBOHUSLAV MARTINŮ: THE SYMPHONIES\n\nORF VIENNA RADIO SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA\n\nCORNELIUS MEISTER\n\n3CD-SET: C5320 PC: 22 UPC: 845221053202\n\nCOMPACT DISC 1\n\n[1] – [4] Symphony No. 1, H. 289 (1942)\n\n[5] – [8] Symphony No. 2, H. 295 (1943)\n\nCOMPACT DISC 2\n\n[1] – [3] Symphony No. 3, H. 299 (1944)\n\n[4] – [7] Symphony No. 4, H. 305 (1945)\n\nCOMPACT DISC 3\n\n[1] – [3] Symphony No. 5, H. 310 (1946)\n\n[4] – [6] Symphony No. 6 „Fantaisies symphoniques“, H. 343 (1954)\n\nMartinu has suffered the fate of not enjoying the same popularity and wide appeal like Bedřich Smetana, Antonín Dvořák und Leoš Janáček on the podium. This often goes so far that his singular skill is referred to, but that the wealth of his oeuvre in all the salient genres is hardly familiar. For decades, Martinů had shied away from composing a symphony. The first one was finally to be written in the USA in 1942, followed by another one every year until 1946 (the sixth was only added to the work catalogue in 1953). For this reason, there is sometimes talk of the ‘American’ symphonies. The symphonies do mirror the events of the time, but at the same time long passages must be regarded as absolute music.\n\nWeitere Bilder\n\nGUSTAV MAHLER: DAS KLAGENDE LIED\n\nSIMONE SCHNEIDER · TANJA ARIANE BAUMGARTNER · TORSTEN KERL · ADRIAN ERÖD · WIENER SINGAKADEMIE · ORF VIENNA RADIO SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA · CORNELIUS MEISTER\n\nC5316 PC: 21 UPC: 845221053165\n\nSONG OF LAMENTATION\n\nfor Soloists, Choir and Orchestra (1878-1880 / rev. 1899)\n\nText: Gustav Mahler after Ludwig Bechsteins fairy tale „Das Klagende Lied“\n\nand „Der singende Knochen“ (The Singing Bone) by the Brothers Grimm\n\n[1] Waldmärchen / Forest Legend (First Version 1880)\n\n[2] Der Spielmann / The Minstrel (Revised Version, 1899)\n\n[3] Hochzeitsstück / Wedding Piece (Revised Version, 1899)\n\nThe cantata Das klagende Lied even today constitutes a veritable rarity in concert programmes – in an age that without contradiction recognizes Mahler as one of the most eminent milestones in the music history, seeing him permanently embedded in the repertoire.\n\nThe salient significance of this large-scale, vocal symphonic work is to be seen in the fact that de facto it forms the beginning of Mahler’s familiar oeuvre, explaining and illustrating to the scholar and the exclusively listening music lover alike so many things that make up Mahler.\n\nIn the context of Das klagende Lied especially, it might justifiably be asserted that Mahler contains everything that was prior to him, but he also anticipates everything that came after him.\n\nWeitere Bilder\n\nSCHUBERT: SCHWANENGESANG D 957\n\nBO SKOVHUS, baritone\n\nSTEFAN VLADAR, piano\n\nC5292 PC: 21 845221052922\n\n20 years ago, at the beginning of his career, the young baritone Bo Skovhus made his first recording of Schubert’s “Schöne Müllerin”.

He found models and inspiration in original English folk music.\n\nMost of the works recorded here rank among the less known pieces by the composer, but all of them very clearly reflect the personal hue, the absolutely ‘personal style’ of Ralph Vaughan Williams.\n\nWeitere Bilder\n\nGEORGE ANTHEIL\n\nA Jazz Symphony (Original Version) · Piano Concerto No. 1 · Capital Of The World (Suite) · Archipelago Rhumba\n\nFrank Dupree · Deutsche Staatsphilharmonie Rheinland-Pfalz · Karl-Heinz Steffens\n\nC5309 PC: 21 845221053097\n\nTrade Mark ‘Bad Boy’ – After all the experimental episodes the audience has faced in the field of New Music in recent decades, today the oeuvre of George Antheil will be welcomed with a great deal of sympathy and many a friendly smile. The American knew full well not only how to meet the expectations of an audience ‘prepared to protest’, but also how even to challenge them more overtly. An excellent example is the Jazz Symphony, written in 1925, shortly after George Gershwin’s Rhapsody in Blue (1924), that bursting the limits of the customary listening experiences of the age in a similar way to e.g. Stravinsky’s Le sacre du printemps of 1913.\n\nWeitere Bilder\n\nVIKTOR ULLMANN\n\nPiano Concerto Op. 25 · Piano Sonata No. 7 · Variations and Double Fugue op. 3a\n\nMoritz Ernst · Dortmunder Philharmoniker · Gabriel Feltz\n\nC5294 PC: 21 UPC: 845221052946\n\nWith the biography of Viktor Ullmann, a prominent individual fate in musical history stands out drastically from the anonymity of the millions of victims the Nazi regime exacted in the course of its attempted obliteration of individual minorities and particularly the mass extermination of the Jewish population in its sphere of influence. It can be only roughly surmised what striking musical movement was thus practically completely destroyed and was hence unable to continue its thrilling development into the second half of the 20th century. It was during these consistently difficult periodes that the Piano Concerto and Piano Sonata No. 7 have been composed, which demonstrates how clearly Ullmann was able to separate external circumstances and his musical imagination.\n\nWeitere Bilder\n\nMITSUKO SHIRAI - JUBILEE EDITION\n\nGian Francesco Malipiero · Julián Carrillo · Gustav Mahler\n\nMitsuko Shirai • Hartmut Höll · Bernd Buß · Ronald Hoogeven · Rainer Sachtleben\n\nC5324 PC: 21 UPC: 845221053240\n\nYet unpublished recordings:\n\nGian Francesco Malipiero (1882 – 1973)\n\n[1] – [4] LE STAGIONI ITALICHE\n\nPER UNA VOCE DI SOPRANO E PIANOFORTE (1923)\n\nJulián Carrillo (1865 – 1965)\n\n[5] Preludio a Colón (1922)\n\nGustav Mahler (1860 – 1911)\n\nDas Lied von der Erde\n\nFirst original version for voice and piano 1908\n\n[6] Nr. 6: Der Abschied\n\n»The First Lady of art song« Jürgen Kesting (STERN)\n\nOn the 28th of May Mitsuko Shirai celebrated her 70th birthday.\n\nShe looks back on a life rich with musical performances: lieder, concerts, and also operas.

Every note conveys the impression of being absolutely necessary, and not one is superfluous or replacable. Ernst Toch’s music is convincing, and his story moves me in such a special way that I feel a great need to make his music accessible to a broader public again and to contribute my share towards re-integrating the ‘most forgotten composer of the 20th century’, as he often called himself in the final years of his life, in musical life today.” Anna Magdalena Kokits\n\nWeitere Bilder\n\nFRANZ & CARL DOPPLER EDITION 3/10\n\nThe Complete Flute Music - Vol. 3 / 10\n\nClaudi Arimany, Shigenori Kudo, Christine Icart, Nabi Cabestany, Alan Branch, Michel Wagemans, John Steele Ritter, Pedro José Rodriguez, Orquesta Sinfónica Ciudad de Elche • Leonardo Martínez\n\nC5297 PC: 21 845221052977\n\n[1] Duettino sur des motifs hongrois op. 36 for two flutes and piano (F)\n\n[2] Morceaux favoris sur “Figaro” opéra de W.A.Mozart for solo flute with piano ad libitum (F) (WPR)\n\n[3] “Az ujabb zene gyöngyei.

From May to November 1884 he wrote the cantata The Spectre’s Bride. 1885 the projected concert finally took place in Birmingham. Tradition has it that Dvořák himself conducted an about 400-voice choir and an orchestra consisting of 150 musicians. Many more performances within just one year in Great Britain and the USA contributed towards consolidating Dvořák’s prominence and popularity in the English-speaking world, which have never really waned since then.\n\nWeitere Bilder\n\nSCHUBERT: DIE SCHÖNE MÜLLERIN\n\nBO SKOVHUS\n\nSTEFAN VLADAR\n\nC5290 PC: 21 845221052908\n\n20 years ago, at the beginning of his career, the young baritone Bo Skovhus made his first recording of Schubert’s “Schöne Müllerin”.

[…] And his expression, his manner of phrasing, and finally his soul!’ Franz Liszt, 1831 (about Paganini)\n\nThe transcriptions and arrangements of Paganini’s études represent a special case and, besides a bow before the great colleague, demonstrate demands on extreme technical skills. In his études, the pianist Liszt is quite evidently endeavouring to place alongside the Devil’s violinist Niccolò Paganini a Devil’s Pianist, which he completely succeeds in doing. In general, recourse is taken to the second version (1851) today, as it seems to be in keeping with Liszt’s definitive desire. However, all the more interesting on this CD is a direct comparison with the earlier version (1838), which exhibits an even more dense notation and difficulties transcending technical borders.\n\nWeitere Bilder\n\nZARA LEVINA (1906-1976)\n\nTHE PIANO CONCERTOS\n\nMARIA LETTBERG · RUNDFUNK-SINFONIEORCHESTER BERLIN · ARIANE MATIAKH\n\n1CD · C5269 PC: 21 845221052694\n\nZara Alexandrovna Levina, born 1906 in Alexandrovsk (Ukraine), witnessed two world wars, the Revolution as well as the collapse and totalitarian reconstruction of her homeland. She was under the constant ideological pressure of the existentially threatening state censorship, which was particularly exerted by the notorious RAPM (Russian Association of Proletarian Musicians) in the 1920s and 1930s, driving her to the brink of a creative and health disaster. However, Zara Levina was able to retain her own and unmistakable voice in her music. She died in Moscow on 1976 as a respected and much-performed composer beloved of musicians such as David Oistrakh, Maria Grinberg, Victor Knuschewitzki and the public alike. Vocal works like her romances meanwhile belong to the salient repertoire of Russian music.\n\nWeitere Bilder\n\nWALTER BRAUNFELS\n\nULENSPIEGEL Opera in 3 acts · Complete Recording\n\nMarc Horus · Christa Ratzenböck · Joachim Goltz · Andreas Jankowitsch · Israel Chamber Orchestra · Martin Sieghart · INSZENIERUNG / DIRECTOR: Roland Schwab\n\n1DVD · C9006 PC: 31 UPC: 845221090061\n\nTill Ulenspiegel // Marc Horus · Nele // Christa Ratzenböck\n\nProfoss // Joachim Goltz · Klas // Hans Peter Scheidegger\n\nJost / Schuster // Andreas Jankowitsch\n\nBürgermeister / 1.

He depicts an apocalyptic panorama, in which the Seven Deadly Sins of the Bible, like the riders of the Apocalypse, befall the last remnants of mankind. In this world of downfall, the composer Walter Braunfels sets his focus on the origins and development of resistance in general. Ulenspiegel becomes the trenchant case study of an apolitical daredevil who undergoes a radical personal transformation as a result of the terror befalling his family. Promoted to become the leader of political resistance, his mind only knows one thing: all-encompassing revenge.\n\nWeitere Bilder"
