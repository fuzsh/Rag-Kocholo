        "text": "MARTINŮ: Symphonies Nos. 1-6 (complete) / Vienna Radio Symphony Orchestra; Cornelius Meister, conductor / Capriccio C5320\n\nHaving had only a passing acquaintance with Cornelius Meister, conducting Wagner opera arias for the great soprano Anne Schwanewilms, I wasn’t sure how he’d do in a program of meaty and sometimes challenging symphonies by one of the great but oft-overlooked masters of the 20th century. Yet from the first note of the first symphony, I was completely caught up in Meister’s musical vision, which is—like that of many conductors nowadays—straightforward in terms of tempo and phrasing, with little or no rubato, yet also extremely fine in his grasp of the line and shape of each movement, the mood, and the fascinating textures that Martinů used.\n\nBy and large, I’d describe Meister’s style as similar to that of Neeme Järvi, and that’s not a bad thing. He digs deep into the music’s emotional content, giving us sometimes overwhelming. The almost constant shifting and development in the first movement is halted only by the final resolution in E-flat major, which almost felt like a cop-out to public taste. My regular readers well know how much I enjoy and respect Martinů as a composer, and how little I think of those who dismiss or snub him. As far as I’m concerned, he’s right up there with Bartók as one of the major creators of the 20th century who used folk music as a basis for his work. I believe this is fully vindicated by these symphonies, which despite my few caveats about certain moments here and there are major works in every way. Who else, for instance, could have written that exuberant, powerful, and wholly original second-movement “Scherzo”? The way Martinů completely shifts gears between the über-powerful opening section and the whimsical, transparent, and colorful middle section is wholly unique, and something that takes the listener by complete surprise. And then there’s the rich, moody, multi-faceted third movement with its almost Stravinskian form of expression, molded by Martinů’s personal aesthetic. His model may be Stravinsky, but those chord selections and positions are entirely his own, as are the swirling clarinets over dotted half notes played by the strings. And in the finale, both the rhythm and the home key are shifted around in a most ingenious way, so subtly that only a quick ear will catch all the changes, particularly on first listening. There’s a remarkable rising chromatic wind passage at the three-minute mark that put me in mind of the “water rising” motif from Berg’s Wozzeck. Martinů continues to juggle the rhythm, ramp up the harmony chromatically in stages, and throw in enough imaginative orchestration to completely re-write both Berlioz’ and Rimsky-Korsakov’s books on the topic. At times, such as the 5:40 mark in this movement, Martinů seems indecisive as to which chord he wants to use, so he just overlaps two of them, and a little while later he again vacillates between the two. In places, where he uses what sound like folk tunes, he sounds like Dvořák on steroids. At the 8:40 mark, he suddenly jumps into a quasi-polka mode like a rodeo rider jumping on a bronco.\n\nInterestingly, the opening of the second symphony almost sounds like a continuation of the first. Hard to describe, but that was my feeling. It’s not that they’re strongly related thematically, but the style feels similar and both the keys chosen and the way Martinů manipulates the material almost makes the first movement of this symphony sound like the fifth movement of the first. The keen listener will be continually fascinated by the way Martinů continues to create an almost 3-D effect in the orchestra, with “back” sections playing against “front” sections as if in a huge domed stadium with natural reverb. I can’t quite explain it, but you’ll know what I mean when you hear it. Here, however, he gets into a repeated rhythm at the 5:30 mark that he rides obsessively through the remainder of the movement. The second movement, by contrast, consists more of mood than musical substance, which is not to say it isn’t interesting, only that it’s not quite as original or varied as the first—until a minute and a half before the end, when a piano suddenly pops in out of nowhere and the tempo doubles temporarily. But the composer has a few tricks up his sleeve for his bucolic, brilliant ride through the third movement, as close to a free-spirited romp as you are likely to hear in a symphony. There’s an almost Sorcerer’s Apprentice-like feel to this music, wild and rather on the comic side. In the last movement, Martinů seems to abandon all pretense of seriousness, giving us something that sounds like circus or carnival music. Repetitive, rising string tremolos play against an insistent rhythm from the basses, then the violas play a counter-melody against the winds before the latter take over; the rhythmic ball is continually being juggled in the air, and Martinů never really stops moving things around until 2:45 when the tempo suddenly decreases (as does the volume) for a cheerful flute melody played over glissando clarinets. Then the initial tempo resumes, and the carnival atmosphere returns.\n\nThe third symphony starts with a Czech-sounding theme in insistent rhythm that Martinů used as a springboard for the rest of the movement. Even when the theme changes, the rhythm remains steady, powerful, dominating. He creates an eerie effect with soft winds playing a serrated figure in front of what sounds like a soft brass and string chord (I’ve not seen the score). A forlorn bassoon solo follows, and although the tempo is reduced somewhat the insistent rhythm continues, punctuating like hammer blows. An astringent chord played by winds is heard over soft piano while the low strings and brasses move into the development. There’s just so much going on here that it’s virtually impossible, in the space of a short review, to describe it all, but the Vienna Radio Symphony manages to play it all and do so with assertion and mastery. Eventually the tempo slowly increases until we are back at the original pace; more permutations, and then the finale. By this point in his career, Martinů was no longer writing anything as simplistic as the ending of the first movement of Symphony No. 1. The second movement, also strongly influenced by folk music modes, presses forward in a way that seems to channel Mahler in feeling (albeit with a different overall feel for melody). Martinů eases up a bit at the 3:50 mark for a lyrical passage played in counterpoint by just the strings; this is in the major and has the feeling of joy and relaxation. This slowly moves back into the full orchestra, as well as back into louder and more angst-ridden themes. A sudden thought just hit me: this music also shares a strong kinship to the music of Mieczysław Weinberg. I wonder if, in addition to his friend Shostakovich, Weinberg wasn’t influenced to some degree by Martinů? The third movement opens like a bomb explosion before moving into edgy, bitonal music that eventually settles into E-flat minor. The music becomes quieter and a bit slower, but loses none of its edge or momentum. Then a dead stop, followed by the softer, mellower “Andante” theme with which Martinů rides out the symphony.\n\nIn stark contrast, the fourth symphony begins in an almost bucolic vein, but then immediately becomes tangled up in a key transposition and bitonal chords. Yet the music manages to untangle itself and get into some chirpy, cheery passages in B-flat major using high winds and strings to sustain the mood. Still, Martinů wouldn’t be Martinů if he didn’t have some wild harmonic changes and fascinating, three-dimensional scoring tricks up his sleeve, thus we vacillate back and forth between these two feelings throughout the movement. Eventually edgy, swirling strings enter the picture, riding us out. The scherzo movement follows, a bit edgier in toto than the first but still vacillating occasionally towards cheerfulness. The manner in which he develops the music, gradually moving in and out of various themes and moods (with a half-tempo, rather pastoral-sounding trio section) is simply remarkable. The latter section of this movement almost sounds like a demented tune for the Seven Dwarfs to dance to. The third-movement “Largo” opens with an ascending arpeggio chord that sounds like a tone cluster, then presents us with a lyrical but somewhat irascible theme played by the cellos (with basses coming in at the end and carrying us through into the development section). I continue to marvel at his ablity to create surging, swelling crescendos of sound that have a structural function within each movement rather than standing out as an “effect.” Modern composers would do well to study these scores for the way he used both dynamics and orchestration. Some of the harmony in the middle of this movement reminded me of Britten. The last movement of this symphony almost doesn’t sound as if it fits in; there’s a certain movie-music “battle scene” feel about it, though of course written with far more complexity than most film music. But it’s the rough-and-tumble, almost antagonistic tone of the music that makes it sound strange in a symphony that, up to this point, was far less angst-ridden than normal. Lots of angst here, however; even when the music recedes from a high pitch or volume level, it is always on the verge of drama. At 3:20 the surging undercurrent of drama virtually begins to explode into antagonistic musical punches, with occasional fall-backs of energy to allow the music to build up a new head of steam.\n\nThe fifth symphony begins somewhat quietly, yet with an undercurrent of disquiet. It’s not long before a strong rhythm crops up, but this time it moves into an almost aggressively cheerful passage tinged by bouncing eights in the winds (mostly clarinets) that vacillate in tonality. Eventually the music calms down a bit, a string passage is heard with occasional piano chords (it intrigues me the way Martinů used pianos in his symphonies, as a regular instrumental color) before moving back to the quasi-cheerful, bouncing rhythm of the beginning. This is then developed brilliantly by the orchestra, with the various sections chiming in as the music surges along. In this symphony the second movement is a “Larghetto,” not a scherzo, and in a way it sounds like a continuation of the first in both mood and, yes, tempo, being just a shade more relaxed. But here the top line is the one that carries a feeling of disquiet while the underlying harmony is more “regular” and, thus, less unsettling to the ear. This wavering continues throughout the movement, creating a fascinating tension of moods. Towards the end both the orchestration and the mood becomes edgier and less friendly, though the very ending is calm.\n\nLikewise the third movement, which begins slowly, also vacillates in mood. Here, however, it is the upper line that sounds lyrical and lovely but the lower harmony, played by cellos and basses, that rumbles through uncomfortable chords. A rare (for Martinů) French horn solo brings a forlorn quality to the music, which is continued in the string passage that follows. Eventually the music reaches a stormy climax, only to fall back on more bucolic music in a faster tempo. This “Lento – Allegro” format brings in almost martial-sounding music at times, but then falls back into slower-moving passages once again.\n\nThe sixth and last symphony, which bears the subtitle “Fantaisies Symphoniques,” may possibly be his most adventurous and imaginative. Beginning with a swirling wind-brass combination, it soon moves into a moody, stark theme that dominates the first movement. But by “dominate” I don’t mean that it isn’t alternated with other themes, some of which are livelier and more rhythmically powerful, only that parts of the theme recur in various guises throughout. Martinů pulled out all the stops on this symphony, using his by-now-recognizable techniques in varying and different ways. For one, the tempo rarely stays the same for very long in this first movement, but shifts and changes with surprising rapidity. One of my few complaints is that the violin solo in the midst of this movement is played rather blandly, lacking some of the edge that the surrounding music possesses. The designation given the second movement, “Poco allegro,” is somewhat deceiving because it is allegro all the way with very little poco. A quirky, edgy, bitonal opening gives way to a surprisingly lyrical string theme, yet those swirling clarinets bring us back to the faster tempo and edgier music as the piece goes on. The last movement has an almost Sephardic sound to the music, not only at the beginning but also in the viola theme played shortly thereafter. The strings interact in their various sections as the theme is developed, moving into fast, edgy passages as time goes on, and it is this mood—mixed with optimistic music—that comes to dominate the movement at the nine-minute mark. This, however, morphs into relaxed, quiet music of great dignity as the symphony ends quietly on a resolved E-flat major chord.\n\nThese performances by 37-year-old Meister are clearly the work of a first-rate musician. Little is left to chance; the music sounds alive, vital and powerful. The sound quality, which came across very clearly through my computer speakers (Klipsch IHX model), sounded just a trifle muddy when played through my main stereo system, thus a small treble boost (4 db) is recommended for those who purchase this album via downloads. No matter, though; this is a superior set of the Martinů Symphonies, and is likely to be a benchmark for some time to come.\n\n—© 2017 Lynn René Bayley\n\nFollow me on Twitter! @Artmusiclounge\n\nReturn to homepage OR"
