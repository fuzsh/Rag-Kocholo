        "text": "I'm in trouble now. Asking about contemporary music on this mainstream NG.\n\nFor the few who wish to participate I really want to know what you think.\n\nRecorded or unrecorded what do you think is the greatest composition after 1950\n\nas our century winds down? If I was asking most popular I would already know\n\nthat answer: Paul McCartney, Standing Stone (argggggh!!!).\n\nIt might help if I started to get the ball rolling. Wouldn't know it would be\n\nShostakovich? I think his 14th symphony composed in 1969 is one of the most\n\nprofound things ever done. You've might have noticed as I've posted it often\n\nfor depressing or tragic music: eleven poems all set to music with the theme of\n\ndeath.\n\nSelfishly I am posting because I want to compare and contrast with the\n\nShostakovich 14th. Maybe the work is too conservative, I don't know. I don't\n\nknow much about other composers after 1950. Many of the library books probably\n\nhaven't been printed yet on the subject. Many library books I've seen are old\n\nand don't contain recent information, at least where I live. I take it you\n\nlearn about the music of the near past almost by word of mouth or in this case\n\nvia newsgroup.\n\nSo in all fairness educate me as I have no other resource at hand.\n\nFred\n\nRyan Hare's short of list of masterpieces, or at least really good pieces,\n\nwritten since 1950:\n\n(All IMHO and YMMV, etc. Not intended to be all-inclusive)\n\nMilton Babbitt: Philomel (1964)\n\nPiano Concerto (1985)\n\nLuciano Berio: Coro (1975-76)\n\nSinfonia (1968)\n\nPoints on the Curve to Find (1974)\n\nCorale (1981)\n\nUn re in ascolta (1985?)\n\nContinuo (1990)\n\nLeonard Bernstein: Candide (1956)\n\nWest Side Story (1957)\n\nHarrison Birtwistle: The Triumph of Time (1972)\n\nThe Mask of Orpheus (1971-73, 1981-84)\n\nSecret Theatre (1984)\n\nEarth Dances (1986)\n\nAntiphonies (1993)\n\nGawain (1991)\n\nPierre Boulez: Le Marteau sans maitre (1953-55)\n\nLe Visage nuptial (1946, 1951, 1988-89)\n\nFigures, Doubles, Prismes (1957-58, 1963-68)\n\nPli selon pli (1957-62)\n\nRituel in Memoriam Maderna (1974)\n\nNotations I-IV for orchestra (1978)\n\nRepoons (1984 -- ?)\n\n...explosante-fixe...

But it has all \"taken\".\n\nThere are no absolutes in music; only relatives (one can't \"prove\"\n\nanything in music, only one can illustrate anything one has a mind to).\n\nRemember, I'm playing, for the most part, the devil's advocate. My\n\nfinal (ultimate) dictum of aesthetics would be, simply you can't argue\n\ntaste (that means \"cannnot\"). Whether a music takes or not is the only\n\ncriterion, as far as I'm concerned (short of critical paternalism,\n\nhermeneutics, utilitarianism, etc.). Whether a music takes is relative,\n\nof course; Rach's 2d is more popular than his 1st or 4th & even 3d.\n\nTchai's First is a lot more popular than his other pno concerti. I was\n\nin Poland a while back and the few people I talked to about Gorecki had\n\nnever listened to his music, although one knew about him (\"we know he's\n\na great man, but I never heard his music\"). Still, G's 3d S. has\n\nobviously taken with a lot of listeners.\n\n>\n\n> But how you separate the critical from the aestheic? In determining\n\n> whether or not something is a work based on an aesthetic, aren't you\n\n> being critical? And what is that sufficient number?\n\nFair questions. I have no philosophy of the aesthetic except that\n\nthere is none! Taste is the only criterion; in the words of Johnson,\n\nwhat pleases many for long (what other rational criterion is there?).\n\nSo aesthetics (feeling) has nothing to do with criticism (meaning).\n\nLet's face it, one could write reams about Woody Allen's Interiors,\n\nbecause it's such a calculated film, but (to my mind) it has minimal\n\naesthetic value. It would be very difficult to write anything about\n\nLittle Richard's Tutti Frutti or Good Golly, Miss Molly, but, again to\n\nmy mind, it's a great work of art. True, as aesthetic experiences\n\nbecome institutionalized a vocabulary emerges to discuss them, dissect\n\nthem, theorize them, etc. (as in the case with cinema, for example, a\n\ncritical industry which has now become more esoteric than that focussed\n\non literary texts). But critical theory in no way grasps the aesthetic\n\ndimensions of these works, merely depends on their aesthetic worth as a\n\n\"given,\" or, in some case, irrelevant (as with obvious Marxist critiques\n\nor doctrinal hermeneutics of different stripes).\n\n> If Tolstoy dismissed Shakespeare as indigestible, then Tolstoy must have\n\n> gotten a little too much sun that day. . . . Using Tolstoy to support\n\n> this point seems not the best example.\n\nAbsolutely. I merely used him in a polemical sense (I certainly don't\n\nagree with him). But I do use him to illustrate (again, merely\n\nillustrate, not prove) a point that aesthetics is strictly relative.\n\nBeauty is in the eye of the beholder; although, we can validate, in the\n\nonly certain way, that a great number of viewers who find something\n\nbeautiful at least suggests that beauty inheres in the object and is not\n\nmerely a pedagogic construct or a figment of one viewer's imagination.\n\n(The reverse is also true, as we found in the 50s when much sanitized\n\nRock was considered artistically superior to the more gritty models on\n\nwhich they were based.)\n\n>\n\n> Well, the critics and the academics and other artists are some of the people\n\n> themselves, and they often command some respect as authorities. If a movie\n\n> gets praised by a critic, you can be sure the marketing will include those\n\n> praises in delivering the message to the people.\n\nWell, now you're talking about sociology. Critics dismissed Hitch for\n\nmuch of his career; Roger Ebert dismissed Jim Carrey in his review of\n\nhis first feature movieand in his second. The thing about criticism is\n\nthat it's so deciduous; otherwise we'd blush at the sheer number of\n\nwrong opinions. I happened upon a contemporary review of Psycho & the\n\nreviewer dismissed Herrmann's now celebrated score as \"typical radio\n\nfare\"! So yes; sociologically the critics obviously matter (esp. on\n\nopening nights along Broadway); but critics certainly carry less weight\n\nwith movies (stars, for example, and word of mouth carry greater\n\nweight). Andrew Sarris revised his opinion (the following week) re:\n\n2001 after his initial negative review of the film; and many critics\n\nrevised their initial opinions of Bonny and Clyde; but the list is\n\nobviously endless. What I meant was that ultimate aesthetic value is\n\nnot measured by critical evaluation but by popular acclamation and\n\nacceptance: it takes or it does not.\n\n>\n\n> (we all know how WRONG other\n\n> >artists can be about aesthetic judgments, Toscanini dismissing Mahler as\n\n> >\"crazy,\" for example).\n\n>\n\n> But being an aesthetic judgement, can it be wrong?\n\nTrue, but don't hold me to a strict use of terminology on the internet,\n\nplease. I clearly intended aesthetic judgments as critical judgments.\n\nFor Toscanini, his aesthetic experience was unsatisfactory. However\n\n(see above) if aesthetic judgments can be validated (consensually) by a\n\ncommunity, then it appears that T's initial (and presumably final)\n\njudgment was WRONG, since Mahler has become the most popular, or one of\n\nthe most popular composers, of our century. (Anymore validation than\n\nthis is unnecessary; at a certain point, numerical advantage is not\n\nnormative: the fact that many more people enjoy \"Memory\" than Mahler's\n\nDas Lied von der Erde does not privilege Webber's song over Mahler's\n\nsong cycle; for clearly M's song cycle has enough of an audience (inc.\n\nnumerical and demographic factors).\n\n>\n\n> You seem to be playing both sides of the coin.

If people wish to buy Moses und Aaron, that's fine; if\n\nthey enjoy it, that's better yet. I say, what the market will bear. Of\n\ncourse I'm arguing it both ways, since that's the way I feel. I can't\n\nunderstand either extreme: the music is great and the \"masses\" should\n\nlearn to discard their sentimental or attenated preferences; or, the\n\nmusic is crap & nobody should record the music. Why decry people who\n\nlisten to this music? And why decry orchestras that don't play this\n\nmusic? If it takes, orchestras will play it (like the Gorecki 3d). It\n\nseems fairly simple to me. To say that these composers are\n\nmisunderstood or neglected geniuses misses the mark in my opinion (by\n\ndefinition a genius, in the accepted idiomatic sense, is a person whose\n\nart is universally appreciated (again, in the idiomatic sense, since not\n\nall people will enjoy listening to Memory either, and fewer will enjoy\n\nlistening to Beethoven's Pastoral). Clearly, however, with some\n\npedagogic institutionalization of these works, they are loved by wide\n\naudiences; and I know personally of people who never listened to\n\n\"classical\" music in their lives who finally couldn't stop playing the\n\nPastoral symphony, for one. It took, finally; but it did take.\n\nRemember, that a highly sensitive musician can find beauty in the\n\novertones of a single note; but his or her job is to translate that\n\npersonal experience into audible patterns (chords, counterpoint,\n\ntimbres, etc.) into public forms; therefore, by definition, the only\n\nvalidation of aesthetics is public, provided the definition of the term\n\npublic has reasonable demographic consensual persuasion (Jane Smith's\n\nfamily will agree that she is the finest singer of La Boheme in the\n\nworld, but will John Anderson's family feel the same? Douglas\n\nTwelvetone's following will agree that his music is the finest of this\n\ncentury, but will Andrew Notone's following agree with this\n\nassessment?).\n\n************************************************\n\n\"I mean, uh, couldn't we stop off at a corner\n\ndrugstore for a moment, so that I could explain\n\nI'm being, uh, kidnapped?\"\n\n- Roger O.
