It consists of two major parts: (1) my opening study (“A Chronicle of a Composer”), where I discuss the contents of Martinů’s writings and the issues of Czech musical politics that helped shape his career; and (2) a selection of Martinů’s writings in translation (The Composer Speaks). In my opening study, I have made an effort to provide relevant commentary about Martinů’s thought, yet readers are free to examine Martinů’s writings first if they so choose. This book is not a biography, yet I bring into discussion many of the key moments of his career and many of his important works. No prior knowledge of the composer is necessary. My primary focus in this book is Martinů’s American Diaries, a revealing collection of essays, aphorisms, and reading notes that bring us into a direct dialogue with the composer. Martinů’s diaries are exceptionally valuable since they were his outlet for exploring new ideas. But his diaries are also quite problematic since he never prepared them for publication and left many passages in a fragmentary state. I deliberated at length over how to present these writings: whether to produce a critical edition that captures each nuance of his text, or a more readable edition for the wider audience. In the end, I chose to produce a more readable edition. My decision to relocate certain kinds of material from the main text to the endnotes and iron out his idiosyncratic language textures might find objections among more specialized readers. Yet my hope is that my endnotes, at times quite copious, will satisfy those readers who will want to gain a greater sense for the originals. In the end, I believe the primary goal of bringing Martinů’s ideas into the public domain warrants my decision to transmit his core meaning as clearly as possible. The title of my book, “Martinů’s Subliminal States,” underscores one of my key findings about the composer: that he was exceptionally preoccupied with the role of the subconscious during musical creation, something I realized only after carefully studying the original manuscripts of his diaries. It was by working with his original diaries that I discovered that the Czech-language transcription of these writings, as found in Miloš Šafránek’s Homeland, Music, and the World, contains many errors. One of these errors, the transcription of the word “subconscious” as “conscious” towards the very beginning, contradicts Martinů’s discussion of his “subliminal states,” as I call them, and confuses much that follows. In order to understand\n\nSvatos.indd xi\n\n9/17/2018 10:31:02 AM\n\nxii\n\n❧\n\npreface\n\nMartinů, we must realize how important the subconscious aspect of musical creation was to him, something we might ordinarily call musical intuition. But perhaps just as important to him was the ability to observe oneself while composing, performing, and listening, and to distinguish how the subconscious and conscious mind each play a specific role. Martinů lived for more than half of his life outside of his native Czech milieu. Yet he always considered himself a part of the Czech musical tradition and fought for his place in it through his music and writings. Martinů’s life-long concern with the debate about Czech music led me to investigate the important Czech critics of his time. My decision to bring Zdeněk Nejedlý into my opening study comes from Martinů’s key statement that Czech musical style during his formative years was determined not by musicians, but “by aestheticians and university professors.” Since Nejedlý was the top Czech music professor in Prague while Martinů was a student there—if not the only Czech music professor of any note—it was a foregone conclusion that Nejedlý should form an integral part of my opening study. I found further justification for discussing Nejedlý in the two-volume A History of Czech Musical Culture 1890–1945, one of the most formidable Czech musicological works of the 1970s and ’80s; here Martinů and Nejedlý are shown explicitly to lead two opposing factions of the Czech musical debate during the 1920s. But as I stress, I do not purport that Nejedlý was the only factor in how Martinů related to the Czech musical milieu. 1920s Prague was home to a rich array of musical interests and ideas, including the microtonal composer Alois Hába (1893–1973), several gifted Jewish composers, and an indigenous population of Austro-German musicians. While I provide some background about the different figures we encounter in relation to Martinů’s writings, a more exhaustive treatment of Martinů in the context of Prague’s greater musical life is something that I do not pursue. This book is based on a collection of materials that I uncovered during my time researching in the Czech Republic. I selected these materials with the specific intent of establishing the nature of Martinů’s aesthetic profile. In my effort to achieve this goal, I present Martinů’s ideas at face value and refrain from challenging his views. My rationale for this is that we have yet to gain a clear perspective of his thought and that engaging with him in debate at this stage would be counterproductive. Another reason I have left his ideas intact is that—throughout his career—Martinů was often attacked and misconstrued in the Czech cultural press. Thus adding a further layer of criticism to his views without sufficiently clarifying them, I felt, would only bring more confusion. Furthermore, the fact that the central aspects of his thought are virtually absent from the academic literature provided me with more justification to make this book into a kind of platform for him to speak his ideas. Although it would defeat my purposes to challenge Martinů’s ideas, there are a number of aspects to his writings that require explanation. In his Parisian Criticism, for example, Martinů rarely names the Czech critics who, as he claims, perpetuated romantic and metaphysical appraisals of music. Since he remained\n\nSvatos.indd xii\n\n9/17/2018 10:31:03 AM\n\npreface\n\n❧\n\nxiii\n\nvague about the identity of his opponents, we could argue rather skeptically that this was a groundless way for him to discredit them. At some level, I have tried to fill in this gap by positioning Nejedlý as one of his principal opponents, based on the evidence I have found. Yet in the end, we are left with little recourse than to accept the fact that Martinů’s argumentation about the “Czech critics” is rather vague and incomplete. Another aspect of his writings that calls for explanation is his frequent reference to “German metaphysics,” which, as he argues, plagued the Czech musical discourse. “German metaphysics,” of course, could refer to any number of things. Metaphysics, on the one hand, is a branch of philosophy, and the German-language philosophers of recent centuries have had any number of approaches to this field. Thus one can hardly speak of a single “German metaphysical school.” The irony in his vague use of this term is that—throughout his own writings—Martinů argues for deploying more precise semantics when describing musical phenomena. Yet at the same time, it was his relentless demand for establishing a more accurate lexicon for the musical discourse that actually informs us of what he meant. For Martinů, “German metaphysics” meant any ideological force that impinges on an artist’s natural creative powers, regardless of the language or culture in question. Here we should take note of a number of factors from his cultural background that contributed to the way he so often denoted negative phenomena as German. First, Martinů came of age in the Czech lands when German was still enfranchised as the dominant institutional language, something that affected virtually all of the Czech cultural figures who were born in the nineteenth century. What is unique in Martinů’s case, however, is that—as a Czech speaker of the Austro-Hungarian Empire—he did not feel compelled to master German himself and have a more direct interface with the German-speaking world. This was something possible for a member of his generation due to the amount of progress the Czechs had made in establishing self-sufficient, Czech-speaking institutions. That Martinů was not a fluent German speaker is something that distinctly separates him from his elder compatriots Smetana, Dvořák, and Janáček. These composers, as a result of their education, were all fluent in German, and interacting with the much larger German-speaking world was always possible for them, though not always desirable, lest they be seen by their compatriots as being too complicit with the culture in power. In Martinů’s case, however, it was by restricting himself to the Czech-speaking milieu that he fashioned his particular notions about what was culturally German, along with his rather idealistic notions about artistic values in France. Later, the dismemberment of Czechoslovakia by Nazi Germany reinforced his negativity about German culture, which, after the war, became intensified all the more by the full revelations of Nazi atrocities. I should also comment on Martinů’s rather distorted portrayal of musical life in Prague and Paris. As we read his reflections on musical life in either location, we should not expect to gain any sort of objective assessment. Instead, we should\n\nSvatos.indd xiii\n\n9/17/2018 10:31:04 AM\n\nxiv\n\n❧\n\npreface\n\nremember that his thoughts on these subjects were conceived to promote the polemical project he was spearheading in the Czech musical world. As we will see, Martinů projected great symbolism by conceiving of himself as a “Czech composer in Paris,” and he believed that this gave him unique authority to speak out on certain matters. We will leave it open to question, however, whether he was able to truly separate himself from what he argued in the Czech press. Also deserving some remarks—in the case of his American Diaries—are his vague references to the “experts” of the 1940s American musical milieu who, as he claims, peddled a kind of primitive music appreciation to the wider, concert-going audience. These experts, as we will see, consisted primarily of music critics and concert program annotators who, through their writings, were diverting listeners’ attention away from the creative aspects of the musical work. Here it is important to remember that Martinů was not interested in engaging with the more serious musical writers of this time, or those we would consider today a part of academia. Instead, he wanted primarily to challenge the role that critics and music educators were playing in the common listener’s experience. With his focus on the common listener, we see the beginnings of his project for music education, where the musicians themselves play the primary role of educators by personally relating the principles of musical craft from their point of view. As I compared and contrasted his thoughts on this subject, I began to envision a pre-concert talk or workshop. In this setting, a moderator would interview a composer or performer and ask questions such as, “Why did you mark this passage pianissimo? Why do you play this passage in a detached style? How does this musical decision enhance the integrity of this work, or the efficacy of your interpretation?” Then the composer or performer is free to respond about their conception of the work, perhaps even taking questions from the audience in the sense of an open forum on musical creation. Any musician who wants to create a greater dialogue with his audience might try embracing Martinů’s modes of inquiry in an attempt to elicit new ideas. In the case of his American Diaries, we might also ask why he spends so much time dealing with romantic ideologies when he is writing as late as the 1940s. From the perspective of these writings alone, our conclusion might be that the American concert hall of Martinů’s time was still dominated by the romantic repertoire and that the means for capturing the interest of common audiences still required romanticizing the composer and the meaning of the musical work. That the romantic repertoire still dominated the concert hall at that time might come as a surprise to those of us who commonly view the musical progress of the early twentieth century through modernist works such as Schoenberg’s Pierrot Lunaire, Stravinsky’s Rite of Spring, or Berg’s Wozzeck. Yet even in the case of the romantic repertoire, Martinů felt that ordinary listeners were unable to hear these works free from a vast repository of deeply entrenched, pre-conceived ideas. As we will see, Martinů proposes a clean slate in the way we approach both the canonical and contemporary works.\n\nSvatos.indd xiv\n\n9/17/2018 10:31:05 AM\n\npreface\n\n❧\n\nxv\n\nSomewhat related to this matter is the way a romantic nineteenth-century sound emerges in his musical works during the 1940s. What we should realize here is that his sound world at that time was transformed not so much by a new-found appreciation of the nineteenth-century masters, whose works he already knew well from his time playing as a violinist in the Czech Philharmonic many years earlier. Instead, his transformation in style was more of a response to the performers he was commonly hearing and composing for in the United States, who were obliged to perform the nineteenth-century repertoire. The way that Martinů consciously shaped and styled his music according to the performers he heard comes out clearly in his essays “An Orchestra is Not a Machine” from his Essays from Fall 1945 and “The Soloist Today” from his Notebook from New York. Apart from this, we should note that seeking out specialized performances of modernist works was not as common for him in the United States as it was during his Parisian years of the 1920s and ’30s, when attending the Straram and Triton concerts, among others, was more regular fare for him as a matter of assimilating the newest musical styles. It would be difficult to deny that there are conceptual shortcomings to Martinů’s writings, which we could point out systematically were we inclined to discredit his thought. Yet if we read his writings in a positive light and realize that Martinů was primarily a composer, and not an academic writer, we might gain a greater appreciation of his aesthetic aims. Naturally, by dedicating a book to his writings, I make the strongest case for Martinů’s ideas. But at the same time, I do not propose that Martinů was a transformative thinker of some kind. Many composers have made statements about the way they serve as a medium for their musical works, where their conscious involvement is restricted. The same holds true for presenting the idea of the musical work as a complex of functional relations: formalist thought of this kind can be traced back to Hanslick and even before. I do feel, however, that many of Martinů’s formulations are insightful, poetic, and if not completely original, they are certainly cast in his own distinctive way. And I have no reservations in commending his honesty and candor as he examines the nature of musical experience and his willingness to discuss certain matters that would seem beneath us. A final addition that I have made to this book is my study, “On the Literary Reception of Kaprálová and Martinů: Jiří Mucha’s Peculiar Loves and Miroslav Barvík’s ‘At Tři Studně’” (see appendix 3). This study concerns the fictitious letter excerpts found at the end of Jiří Mucha’s novel Peculiar Loves, which continue to be passed down to us today as authentic evidence. My study also exposes the communist cultural politician Miroslav Barvík, and specifically, how this figure played a role in Martinů’s late and posthumous reception. Certainly, we cannot consider Mucha’s Peculiar Loves a scholarly source. Yet it has made an impact on the way we view Martinů today. In some ways, Mucha’s novel holds a position in the Martinů literature similar to the one held by Solomon Volkov’s Shostakovich memoirs in the Shostakovich literature: both are read by all who are interested in either Martinů or Shostakovich, and—although most scholars realize they are dealing\n\nSvatos.indd xv\n\n9/17/2018 10:31:06 AM\n\nxvi\n\n❧\n\npreface\n\nwith an unreliable source—elements from each work creep into the more serious studies. In the case of Mucha’s Peculiar Loves, we will never know the truth about Mucha’s account of Kaprálová’s final hours, when she purportedly heard the sounds of Martinů’s opera Julietta in the rain. What this account suggests, in fact, is that Kaprálová had an innate bond with Martinů that went beyond the common respect she had for him as a composer and teacher. Over the past decades, a subgenre of literature has emerged that speculates on the depth of the Kaprálová–Martinů relationship and how Martinů might have even enshrined her in his music. My discussion of the fictitious letter excerpts in Mucha’s novel, I believe, will deflate this line of inquiry. Yet my primary goal here is to present the undeniable evidence that these letter excerpts are, in fact, fictitious, and relate the unusual story behind them.\n\nSvatos.indd xvi\n\n9/17/2018 10:31:07 AM\n\nAcknowledgments There are several individuals who deserve recognition for their contributions to this book. First, my thanks go out to Michael Beckerman, who helped generate this topic. The director of the Martinů Institute, Aleš Březina, and his staff have my gratitude for sharing with me the institute’s vast range of research materials and their expertise on the composer. The brothers Boris and F. James Rybka—the sons of Martinů’s close friend in America Frank Rybka—have my appreciation for sharing with me their many insights coming from their personal encounters with the composer during their youth. I congratulate James for having completed a biography on Martinů that offers not only an original theory about the composer, but also numerous details about his life that would have gone lost. For their inspiring academic engagement, I would like to note my former colleagues in Cyprus: the cellist Nicolas Deletaille and the music theorist John William MacKay. Nicolas has my additional thanks for compositing the musical examples in this book, and John—with your blend of brilliance and contagious laughter—I will remember you always. My sister Veronica Svatos DeLuca provided invaluable support from her home in the United States while I resided in several different countries as I worked on this text. For their general support, my thanks also go out to Joy Haslam Calico, Frank Cibulka, Sabine Feisst, Robert A. Green, Yoel Greenberg, Christopher Kayler, and Jan Smaczny. And for supporting this publication and providing their unique perspectives, the editors of the Eastman Studies in Music and the University of Rochester Press—as well as the anonymous reviewers of my work—have my gratitude as well. My special thoughts go out to two veterans of Martinů research—Jaroslav Mihule and František “Iša” Popelka—whose work on Martinů dates back to the 1950s. It was a pleasure that Professor Mihule could meet with me on several occasions to discuss Martinů and allow me to examine some of the composer’s personal effects in his possession. I congratulate Professor Mihule on his many achievements, which include an authoritative Martinů biography and numerous invaluable articles on the composer. Professor Mihule’s achievements also extend beyond musical research to diplomacy, as he served as the Czech Republic’s first ambassador to the Netherlands during the 1990s. It is hard to describe my indebtedness to Iša Popelka and his wife Vladimíra. On several occasions, Iša made arrangements for me during my research trips to Polička,\n\nSvatos.indd xvii\n\n9/17/2018 10:31:08 AM\n\nxviii\n\n❧\n\nacknowledgments\n\nthe composer’s hometown and the site of the Bohuslav Martinů Memorial (now the Bohuslav Martinů Centre). And as a curator at the memorial’s archive, he guided me through its rich array of documentary materials. Iša’s many years of editorial experience working on Supraphon’s musicological releases and his sheer depth of knowledge in so many fields played a key role in how this book took shape. Had it not been for the generosity of the Popelkas, who on several occasions hosted me at their home in Prague, where Iša and I engaged in tedious but rewarding work over Martinů’s manuscripts, this book would have never arisen.

A large portion of the writings by Martinů that I present in this book are from his American Diaries. I do not present all of Martinů’s diaries since they contain a great deal of repetition. Nevertheless, in my opening study and my endnotes, I provide some discussion about those texts I omit. In my opening study, I try to cover the core ideas of Martinů’s diaries but give extra attention to certain passages that could benefit from some interpretation. I do not consider my discussion exhaustive, and I certainly welcome any dialogue should others find alternative readings or insights. As a general practice, I italicize the titles of Martinů’s American Diaries, the different portions of his American Diaries, his Parisian Criticism, and his 1941 Autobiography, even though the composer never published these writings himself as separate works. I also italicize the titles of musical and artistic works, if appropriate, whenever they appear in passages from Martinů’s diaries and personal correspondence. When I quote passages from the Czech press where the titles of musical works were originally set off in quotation marks, I have changed these to italics as well. Two published anthologies contain most of Martinů’s writings on music in the original Czech. I cite these anthologies frequently, using the abbreviations DHS and DBM. The reader should see my “Abbreviations” for the full bibliographic details of these anthologies. Also regarding bibliography, I list the books that Martinů read while he was writing his diaries in appendix 1 as “Martinů’s Source Reading.” For more details on Martinů’s personal library, see my “Editorial Remarks.” For the benefit of non-Czech readers, book titles and article titles originally in Czech are presented in English in the main body of my text. The full titles in the original Czech can be found in my bibliography. I also present English titles for musical works originally entitled in Czech. In my works index, I provide the original Czech title in parentheses if the title has a poetic nature. Martinů entitled most of his early works in Czech. Many of these works are relatively unknown internationally and have yet to gain standardized English translations. In most cases, I use the English translations I found in the Czech sources on the composer. Two exceptions to this, however, are Martinů’s “Workers of the\n\nSvatos.indd xxi\n\n9/17/2018 10:31:11 AM\n\nxxii\n\n❧\n\nnotes to the reader\n\nSea,” which I have changed to Toilers of the Sea (the most common translation of Victor Hugo’s novel), and “Istar,” which I have changed to Ishtar (the more common English spelling of the Mesopotamian deity). Any discrepancies in titles can be cleared up by consulting my works index, where I give an “H” number for each work. The “H” numbering system is the one found in Harry Halbreich’s authoritative catalog of Martinů’s musical works (see “Abbreviations”). I relied on Halbreich’s catalog when compiling my own list of Martinů’s compositions in my works index. My list only includes those compositions by Martinů that are discussed in this book. I have tried to make my translations of Martinů’s writings as readable as possible. Yet there remain certain passages where he writes a considerable amount of material in parentheses, and this can make it hard to follow his main line of thought. In general—if a passage is at all encumbered by parenthetical material—I recommend that the reader go through that passage first without the parenthetical material, and then with it once the context is clear. In my translations of Martinů’s writings, I use the pronouns “he,” “him,” and “his” when he refers to composers, listeners, critics, etc., in a general sense. I do this in response to Martinů’s original Czech-language text. I also use masculine pronouns in my opening study where I paraphrase and discuss Martinů’s thought. This, I hope, will be seen to reflect the original text and the fact that the author is male rather than any gender bias on my part. A major impetus for Martinů to write his essays was his dissatisfaction with the writings about music he encountered. Yet he was often vague about the identity of the authors he criticizes, and we cannot always be certain that he is referring to music critics, concert program annotators, musicologists, music theorists, or any other kinds of writers on music. For this reason, I employ the neologism “musical writers” in order to not mislead readers about the particular nature of those authors. Finally, in his diaries, Martinů was very intent on illuminating what he calls the “subconscious creative process.” This was such a fundamental premise to him that he often uses the term “process” in an unspecified way. The fact that he felt no need to be more specific with this word shows how much his own process of musical creation formed his frame of reference for virtually everything he observed. Martinů’s writings are used courtesy of the Bohuslav Martinů Foundation.\n\nSvatos.indd xxii\n\n9/17/2018 10:31:12 AM\n\nIntroduction Why Martinů the Thinker? On 31 March 1941, Bohuslav Martinů arrived in New York City following a dramatic nine-month journey from occupied France. Once in the United States, he was only one of many fine composers in exile who hoped to continue his work while Europe was at war. And like most of his colleagues from the old world, he was unsure about how he would be received. Martinů’s situation might have seemed exceptionally bleak. He was extremely withdrawn and could barely speak English, making him reliant on others for some of the most ordinary personal and professional tasks. What is more, the chaos of his flight from France left him in possession of only four of his scores. Considering Martinů’s uniquely difficult circumstances, which I will discuss in this book, we might think that he would have been unable to succeed. But instead, he managed to establish himself quite well in the United States, and he gradually rose to a level of fame that is seldom recognized in the historical literature. Pivotal in launching Martinů’s American career was the Boston Symphony’s Serge Koussevitzky, who not only premiered Martinů’s Concerto Grosso (November 1941) and brought him to Tanglewood as a professor (summer 1942), but also commissioned and performed Martinů’s First Symphony (November 1942), the first of five works in the genre that the composer completed in consecutive years.1 Apart from Koussevitzky, the list of high-profile musicians performing Martinů’s works at this time reads like an encyclopedia of 1940s American musical life. Also conducting his works with the major East Coast and Midwestern orchestras were Erich Leinsdorf, Charles Munch, Eugene Ormandy, Artur Rodzinski, and George Szell. And among the soloists premiering his concertos and chamber works were Mischa Elman, Rudolf Firkušný, and Gregor Piatigorsky. Based on the number of first-rate performances he received of fresh, new works, it is hardly an exaggeration that, by the end of World War II, Martinů was among the preeminent composers in the United States, and on the East Coast alone, he clearly ranked at the top of his profession. After the first performances of his Symphony no. 6 (“Fantaisies symphoniques,” 1953), a work gaining great critical acclaim with the East Coast press, Martinů’s star\n\nSvatos.indd 1\n\n9/17/2018 10:31:12 AM\n\n2\n\n❧\n\nintroduction\n\nbegan to fade. Partly responsible for this was his decision to change residence several times over the course of his final years, when he lived for periods in Nice, New York, Rome, and Switzerland. After his death in 1959, Martinů’s status went into further decline. This we can see in the first edition of the New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians (1980), where he receives merely three and a half pages, and in his complete omission from Robert Morgan’s Twentieth-Century Music: A History of Musical Style in Modern Europe and America (1990).2 That he continues to be eclipsed in more recent years can be seen in Richard Taruskin’s five-volume Oxford History of Western Music (2005), where he is completely absent once again.3 One of the reasons Martinů has eluded the academic discourse is that, unlike the case with many of his peers, little has been known about his intellectual ideas. Indeed, a common step in the reception of a composer is that his writings become available, creating handles for historians to learn more about his aesthetic and technique. Few will doubt that the notions of “twelve-tone composition,” “speech melodies,” and “Gebrauchsmusik” all help create points of departure in the reception of Schoenberg, Janáček, and Hindemith, even if these ideas serve merely as sounding boards to a much larger creative world. But what were Martinů’s key ideas about musical composition? With one of the most prolific composers of his generation, whose catalog of works extends to nearly four hundred items,4 the reigning impression has been that he was merely a silent craftsman who had little need to reflect on his music. Among those who helped create this image is biographer Brian Large, who noted the purported disregard Martinů had for the quality and reception of his works, while remarking simply that “he was not a conscious theorist like Schoenberg.”5 From this point of view, it might seem that Martinů was not a serious thinker. Yet it is difficult to accept that a composer who perfected his craft over almost sixty years would not have something significant to say. It is the goal of this study, therefore, to establish Martinů’s intellectual world. My focus is on some of the richest and most revealing texts he left us: his Parisian Criticism, by which I mean his polemical essays from his early Parisian years, and his American Diaries, of which I present a large portion in translation here. Forming a link between these two bodies of writings is his 1941 Autobiography, which I have also translated and discuss; here Martinů reflects on his creative development to the time of his arrival in the United States with great thought and detail. A primary source for Martinů’s writings has been Bohuslav Martinů: Homeland, Music, and the World (henceforth DHS),6 compiled and edited by the Czechoslovak diplomat Miloš Šafránek (1894–1982). Appearing in a limited edition in 1966, this volume was an attempt by Šafránek to present the most complete collection of Martinů’s writings outside of the composer’s personal correspondence and essays on theater.7 Researching Martinů will always take us through the work of Šafránek, who, from his post in Paris as a Czechoslovak cultural attaché, began following Martinů’s career in the late 1920s; he was the first to transmit the most basic knowledge of the composer through two biographies and several other publications.8\n\nSvatos.indd 2\n\n9/17/2018 10:31:13 AM\n\nintroduction\n\n❧\n\n3\n\nŠafránek was also of crucial importance to Martinů in that—after assuming a post with the Czechoslovak Information Service in New York City as a cultural affairs administrator—he helped Martinů get quickly settled in the United States upon the his arrival from Europe.9 The first part of my study explores Martinů’s Parisian Criticism.10 Of the many essays Martinů wrote for the Czech cultural press during his early residence in Paris, I focus on those of an explicitly polemical intent. What these essays reveal is that—many years before his arrival in the United States—Martinů was passionately engaged in a debate over Czech music criticism, which, in his view, suffered from the lasting influence of German romanticism and was hopelessly out-of-date. In his Parisian Criticism, we realize that his lifelong aesthetic outlook—characterized by an objective distance from his materials and a desire for clarity—was a response to the “depth of expression” that he felt the vast majority of Czech critics preferred. Reading Martinů’s Parisian Criticism often leaves us with the impression that he was engaged in a battle against all, with little need to specify who was at fault. For this reason I explore the history of Czech music criticism, focusing on some of the most important debates that led to the Czech critical discourse of Martinů’s early years. Since Czech music criticism at this time was under the strong influence of Zdeněk Nejedlý—that eternal champion of Bedřich Smetana and later a minister in the post-World War II communist governments—it is to this figure that I devote the greatest attention. Although an open polemic between Martinů and Nejedlý never arose, I present these two figures as spokesmen for two antagonistic factions of Czech musical debate: one calling for the acceptance of the most current modernisms, with the other demanding political engagement based on a very specific view of the Czech musical heritage.11 Apart from Nejedlý, I conducted a broader study of the 1920s Czech musical press to see if the biases Martinů rebukes were as pervasive as he claimed. While the reviews from this time clearly reveal that these biases did exist, I also found notable commentaries by Czech critics about Martinů’s early works; these commentaries will offer us some comparison with the way Martinů himself depicted his early Czech reception. Other paradigms from the Czech press will help us gain a picture of the musical discourse during Martinů’s early years. What is striking, for example, is the way so many writers argued for a single path for national music. And this included Martinů himself, whose works during the late 1920s sometimes ventured into the extremes of Dadaist pastiche. Also notable is a debate about musical realism, with Nejedlý shaping a paradigm that anticipates the socialist-realist aesthetic of communist Czechoslovakia. Martinů’s realism, on the other hand, called for an embrace of styles and ideas that corresponded with the technological changes of the day. The Czech cultural press also reveals nomenclature that—although certainly shared in some ways by other European milieus—reflects the particular values of the Czech musical community. Wagner’s New German School, for example, is commonly referred to as neo-romanticism, a term that allowed the Czech critics to\n\nSvatos.indd 3\n\n9/17/2018 10:31:13 AM\n\n4\n\n❧\n\nintroduction\n\nplace Smetana among the foremost exponents of Wagner’s extramusical symbolism while enabling them to keep some distance from Wagner himself. Also notable is the concept of ideovost, which we can roughly translate to “philosophizing.” This, for the critics of Nejedlý’s persuasion, was a positive musical attribute in the works of the “progressive,” neo-romantic practitioners. By contrast, favoritism for ideovost in Czech music was a proclivity that Martinů and other musical writers sought to temper. My discussion of Martinů’s Parisian Criticism begins with his plea for Stravinsky’s greater acceptance in Czech musical life. In connection with his Stravinsky essays, I discuss Martinů’s Half-Time (Rondo for Large Orchestra, 1924), a work that held such great significance for him that he once even wrote, “everything that had come before this work was mere preparation,” a remark linked to his sudden break with Debussy, who had been his greatest influence until that time.12 While tracing the reception of Half-Time, I discovered an undocumented but significant polemic between Martinů and the conductor Jaroslav Vogel, who, outside the Czech Republic, is best known for his authoritative Janáček biography.13 An important part of this polemic includes Martinů’s forgotten essay “Igor Stravinsky,” to which I give special attention. Martinů’s writings from this time clarify his early views not only on Stravinsky, but on several other composers as well. Particularly notable are his thoughts on Schoenberg and his generalizations about “German music,” which, as a part of his polemical strategy, he made synonymous with romanticism in its more excessive forms. Also striking are his remarks about the “Battle over Dvořák,” which cast a shadow over Prague’s musical life during his early years, as well as his thoughts on Smetana and the Czech national tradition. Further illuminating Martinů’s polemical stance are the major musical events in Prague at that time, such as the Smetana centennial birth celebrations (1924), the two ISCM festivals (1924, 1925), and the controversial production of Alban Berg’s Wozzeck at the Prague National Theater (1926), all of which he touches upon at least in some way. The essays from Martinů’s early Parisian residence that I omit from discussion fall more into the sphere of his work as a musical correspondent, where his basic aim was to show how musical life in Paris differed from that in Prague. But by simply assuming the role of Prague’s top musical reporter in Paris, these writings, too, had a specific polemical intent: for by merely portraying the musical distinctions of Paris—with his call for his colleagues at home to come “up-to-date” with the times—he was coming into direct conflict with a large portion of the Czech critical world that was hostile to French idioms and styles. Indeed, the Czech critics commonly denounced Martinů for his French sympathies, which contributed to the fact that he never worked a season in Czechoslovakia following his departure in 1923. My next chapters deal with Martinů’s American Diaries, a collection of writings that requires some clarification. In 1943, while on summer holidays in Darien, Connecticut, Martinů began sketching a number of ideas on musical creation.\n\nSvatos.indd 4\n\n9/17/2018 10:31:15 AM\n\nintroduction\n\n❧\n\n5\n\nAccording to Šafránek, Martinů’s impetus for producing these writings had been the frequent discussions he had had with the composer to establish contents for a first biography.14 The next summer, Martinů wrote down his thoughts once again at Ridgefield, Connecticut, but in a way that went far beyond the sketches and essay fragments that are for the most part typical of his writings from Darien. Drawing from several books on cultural history and the physical sciences, he penned a remarkable collection of essays in what was seemingly an attempt to produce a monograph of his own. Martinů continued assembling his thoughts during the summer of 1945, when his retreat was the Cape Cod Peninsula; in the fall of 1945 to the end of the year in New York City; and once again in New York City in 1947. Thus what I refer to here as his American Diaries consists of a body of writings that Martinů sketched over the first part of his American residence but never saw through to publication. After perusing these materials in the 1950s and recognizing their value, Šafránek suggested to the composer that they should form a part of his collected writings, an idea that Martinů encouraged and Šafránek later realized as DHS.15 In DHS, Martinů’s American Diaries are found in an annotated edition in the section called “In America” and are referred to there as his “Diaries and Notebooks.”16 After initially translating Martinů’s diaries from DHS, I began to question their value once I detected several contradictions in his thought. But after comparing the printed text in DHS with the original manuscripts, I realized that DHS is rife with omissions, faulty transcriptions, curious substitutions of words, and other irregularities. This led me to amend my work, based on Martinů’s originals, in order to verify the exact contents. I discuss these matters in more detail, as well as my approach for producing my final translations here, in chapter 10 of this book. Since the nature of his diaries is completely different from that of his Parisian Criticism, I produced studies of a different kind.17 These studies take form as synopses, where I clarify the focal points of Martinů’s thought while providing some commentary as well. Notable about his essay “On the Creative Process” (1943) from his Notebook from Darien are his idiosyncratic concepts, such as “subconscious concentration,” “sensation-attitude,” and “emotion-complex,” all of which he coins in his attempt to establish what he saw as the real nature of musical creation. In my discussion of this essay, I also examine Martinů’s idea of his “unexpected works,” and based on this idea, I suggest new avenues of thought for how we might view his musical output as a whole. Martinů’s principles of the creative process extend to his Ridgefield Diary (1944), which is further unified by his thoughts on organic musical relations. Holding great importance for him here is the inviolable perfection of the completed work, and in order to draw us closer to this phenomenon, he employs concepts such as the work’s “irreversibility” and “inner order.” Other notable concepts from his time at Ridgefield include “unwritten laws” and “common denominator,” through which he attempts to shed light on certain sociological phenomena in music.\n\nSvatos.indd 5\n\n9/17/2018 10:31:16 AM\n\n6\n\n❧\n\nintroduction\n\nIn his Essays from Fall 1945 we find “Something about that ‘French’ Influence,” where he explains his reasons for leaving Prague for Paris. This is a key reflection that reveals how deeply he had been wounded by the Czech critics, who had often equated his assimilation of Parisian styles with issues of national loyalty. My title Essays from Fall 1945 comes from my discovery that these writings were misdated in DHS to June 1944.18 This discovery and the subsequent redating of the writings, given the crucial world events of that time, has implications on our understanding of Martinů’s post-war situation, particularly his feelings about returning to Prague and resuming his discourse with potentially hostile Czech critics. In December 1945, in his Notebook from New York, Martinů produced what is perhaps his most beautiful essay, “The ‘Pastoral’ Symphony: What Are Invariable and Variable Conditions?” Although his goal here is to offer an alternative means for analyzing musical works, this essay is exceptionally valuable because he discusses another composer’s work in some technical detail, in this case Beethoven’s Symphony no. 6 (“Pastoral”). Afterwards, Martinů comments on the endemic problems in musical culture that inhibit aesthetic immediacy and how these problems might be resolved by perceiving the musical work as a gestalt. My study concludes with a look at Martinů’s reception under Czechoslovak communism, and how the “automatistic” nature of his creative philosophy left a vacuum in our understanding of his artistic profile. The goal of this book is to show that Martinů had a substantial repertoire of ideas that merits study and debate. Performers of his music will undoubtedly relish the trust he places in the basic instincts of the musician. For those interested in his intellectual influences, his diaries bring to light a number of new details, such as the role of the Czech scientist Antonín Svoboda, who was a primary catalyst on Martinů’s thought during the mid-1940s. Finally, for the music historian, his diaries show yet another major composer who addressed the issues of his day—and suggested some solutions. For Martinů, this meant reasserting musical craft as the central tenet of musical culture, from composing and performing through to the common listening experience that each one of us has.\n\nSvatos.indd 6\n\n9/17/2018 10:31:17 AM\n\nPart One\n\nA Chronicle of a Composer\n\nSvatos.indd 7\n\n9/17/2018 10:31:18 AM\n\nSvatos.indd 8\n\n9/17/2018 10:31:18 AM\n\nChapter One\n\nMartinů’s Parisian Criticism Martinů’s career as a writer began with a burst of essays he wrote for the Czech cultural press shortly after his arrival in Paris in 1923. Although his writings from Paris deal with a variety of themes, what frequently emerges here is his protest against the norms of Czech music criticism, which he found excessively romantic and harmful to the efforts of the younger Czech composers. Throughout his Parisian Criticism, Martinů does not name the critics who perpetuated these norms. This, too, is characteristic of his essay from his American Diaries, “Something about that ‘French’ Influence” (1945), where he illuminates the biases of Prague’s musical life as he perceived them as a young man.1 In this later essay, Martinů describes how the Czech critics had considered French music “superficial” in relation to the “deeper” and “better” conception of music at home. But the closest he brings us to the specific critics involved is by referring to them as the “dominating ideologues,” whose thinking was based on “German metaphysical philosophy.”2 Martinů’s first biographer, Miloš Šafránek, does not make this matter any clearer. This we see in Šafránek’s second biography, where, also without naming any individuals, he explains Martinů’s motivations for leaving Prague: “Martinů was aware that there was something false in the philosophical conception of music as a vehicle for extramusical ideas, subscribed to by music theorists and professors of aesthetics under German influence.”3 In the case of his Parisian Criticism, we can propose various reasons for Martinů’s oblique references to the critics. Playing a role here might have been his ostensibly non-confrontational nature, or the fact that overt challenges to well-positioned figures in Prague might have hurt his chances for gaining a position there in the future.4 But as we will see, some of the targets of Martinů’s critiques were well known to the Czech cultural world, suggesting that his motive was to marginalize them and help lead the Czech musical discourse into more cosmopolitan directions. In the case of the communist-era literature, however, which includes Šafránek’s second biography, the reason Martinů’s opponents fail to appear in print is much clearer: the most influential Czech music critic of the early twentieth century, Zdeněk Nejedlý (1878–1962), emerged as a minister in the Czechoslovak\n\nSvatos.indd 9\n\n9/17/2018 10:31:19 AM\n\n10\n\n❧\n\nchapter one\n\ncommunist governments, in a position to punish those who had challenged him in the past. Thus out of fear of Nejedlý, who became a kind of cultural icon for the communists, most writings from the communist period on Martinů and the conductor Václav Talich (1883–1961) make no mention of the ways that these figures had opposed him.5 With respect to these factors, I will devote the following pages to Nejedlý and his web of associates—whom I will call the “Nejedlý School”—and trace the origins of their cultural-political cause. Then I will show how Martinů challenged the Nejedlý School, which—due to Nejedlý’s rise to power—continued to impact Czech musical life all the way through to the communist period. The Nejedlý School was only one part of a rich spectrum of musical thought during the First Czechoslovak Republic, and we cannot consider them the exclusive reason for Martinů’s discontent with Czech critical culture. I will show, nevertheless, that Nejedlý’s cohesive paradigm played a decisive role in how Martinů developed as a composer and compelled him to establish his unique philosophical views.\n\nThe Nejedlý School So great was Nejedlý’s influence over Czech musical thought during the twentieth century that we should establish a few facts about him. In terms of ideology, Nejedlý was chiefly responsible for perpetuating the work of his teacher Otakar Hostinský (1847–1910), the aesthetician who justified the use of Wagner’s operatic reforms in Czech music and argued for the recognition of Bedřich Smetana (1824–84) as the single progenitor of the national musical tradition. A central aspect of Nejedlý’s agenda was to cultivate a correct succession of composers in Smetana’s wake. Having already published books on Fibich’s melodramas, Smetana’s operas, and the Hussite chorale,6 Nejedlý gained notoriety in Prague’s musical life through his militantly led protest against Antonín Dvořák (1841–1904) at the time Dvořák was being celebrated posthumously upon his seventieth birthday. By this time, to Nejedlý’s great aggravation, Dvořák’s popularity had begun to eclipse Smetana’s legacy, leading the public to forget how much Smetana had sacrificed for the national musical cause. One of the results of the “Battle over Dvořák” was a chasm between academicians, who, under Nejedlý’s moral leadership, insisted on continuing in the Smetana tradition, and the performing musicians of Prague, who were more liberal regarding the dialogue Czech music could have with new music from abroad.7 Although relatively small in number, Nejedlý’s followers were well situated and gained a formidable presence in the Czech cultural press. In 1909, Nejedlý became the first chair of musicology at the Czech branch of the Charles University, a position from which he trained the first generation of Czech musicologists, many of whom he indoctrinated into his school.8 Among his closest student followers was the critic Josef Bartoš (1887–1952), who worked tirelessly alongside Nejedlý as a speaker on\n\nSvatos.indd 10\n\n9/17/2018 10:31:19 AM\n\nmartin ů ’s\n\nPARISIAN CRITICISM\n\n❧\n\n11\n\nmusic and was exceptionally fierce in attacking Nejedlý’s foes.9 Another key figure was Otakar Zich (1879–1934), who, apart from his work as a composer, became a professor of aesthetics at the Charles University in 1924; as a writer, Zich assimilated and reworked Hostinský’s ideas in his books The Aesthetic Apperception of Music and The Aesthetics of Dramatic Art, which became pillars of study in Prague’s academic milieu.10 Other important figures included Vladimír Helfert (1886–1945), who later broke ties with Nejedlý once he established his own school of musicology in Brno, and the conductor and composer Otakar Ostrčil (1879–1935), who assumed the powerful position of Director of the Prague National Theater in 1920. For promoting his revisionist agenda, Nejedlý had several journals at his disposal of which Smetana became most symbolic. Emerging at the time of the Dvořák debates, Nejedlý’s flagship for Czech music lasted until 1926 and had a short revival of ten further issues in the years 1936–38.11 A perusal of this particular journal from the 1920s reveals who Nejedlý’s chosen composers were, as articles on Smetana, Zdeněk Fibich (1850–1900), Josef Bohuslav Foerster (1859–1951), Ostrčil, and Emil Axman (1887–1949) dominate throughout. With a preference for these composers, Nejedlý’s post-romantic orientation becomes clear. Although hostile to most modernisms, Nejedlý’s camp was at least partial to expressionism, which we see not only in Nejedlý’s glowing reviews of the Prague National Theater’s production of Wozzeck,12 but also in several highly chromatic works by Ostrčil and Zich. The Nejedlý School was certainly hostile to impressionism, which was deemed a negative attribute in Martinů’s works, as we will see. Nejedlý’s outright dismissal of impressionism—even if drawn on false grounds—can be seen in the following remarks from 1909: “Debussy’s impressionism is, in short, interesting, but it represents the utter mistake that appears when the characteristics of one art form are forced onto another. It is a sin against artistic nature . . . an unnatural approach that produces merely a façade.”13\n\nNejedlý’s Motivations and Style Nejedlý’s need to promote Smetana at the expense of Dvořák was based on several political and aesthetic factors—and often a deliberate intermixing of the two. The “Battle over Dvořák” that peaked in the years 1910–13 was at some level an extension of the debate over Wagner and program music that had become a part of the Czech musical discourse during the 1860s and ’70s. Linked to the opposing paradigms of absolute and program music during that earlier period were the two most significant political entities of that time: the conservative, land-owning “Old Czechs,” who had supported Dvořák during his early career, and the more aggressively nationalistic “Young Czechs,” for whom Smetana was a leading figure. For Nejedlý, some decades later, it was a moral affront to Smetana’s legacy that Dvořák had become the more popular Czech composer. Not only had Dvořák accepted the support of\n\nSvatos.indd 11\n\n9/17/2018 10:31:20 AM\n\n12\n\n❧\n\nchapter one\n\nthe monied Old Czechs, but he had also exploited a nationally conceived idiom that was Smetana’s hard-won contribution to Czech national culture. Nejedlý was also keen to point out that Dvořák had accepted the support of powerful individuals in Vienna, the capital of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. According to Nejedlý, Eduard Hanslick and Johannes Brahms, both situated in Vienna, had “encouraged an opponent” to the nationalist movement Smetana had been leading in Bohemia; this was a reference to the compositional awards that Dvořák had received from the Austrian state government upon the recommendation of both Hanslick and Brahms.14 Thus Nejedlý’s embrace of Smetana, program music, and the Wagnerian music drama was also a response to “rakušáctví,” or the way certain Czech musicans were perceived to have collaborated with the imperial state. This we can see in Nejedlý’s infamous review of Josef Suk’s symphonic tone poem Ripening from just after Czechoslovakia’s independence (1918), in which Nejedlý scolds Suk for his decision to accept Austrian state honors: “Completely different figures will be needed than those who accepted orders of merit from the Austrian government at the time of our greatest national suffering. There is no place for such figures in the present national climate, even if he decorated himself more with the tricolor of the Czechoslovak flag.”15 Nejedlý was also instrumental in transforming the struggle between the Old Czechs and the Young Czechs into the issues of class politics that later defined Czech history. In other words, by World War I, Nejedlý had merged the aesthetics of the Young Czechs with those of the early Czech socialist movement, even transforming Smetana into the artistic leader of the class struggle.16 Towards the end of the war, in anticipation of an end to imperial rule, there was even talk about “socializing music,” with the Nejedlý School represented by Helfert’s essay Our Music and the Czech State.17 A major cause of Nejedlý’s discontent had been the Prague Conservatory, an institution that had been supported by the Old Czechs, subsidized by Vienna, and remained subservient to imperial politics by shunning programmatic nationalism and Wagner’s chromatic innovations. It was on these grounds that both Dvořák and Suk—who had both held important positions at the conservatory (but can hardly be considered simply anti-Wagnerian)—became two of Nejedlý’s primary targets. In the following passage, also coming from just after Czechoslovakia’s independence, we feel the invective through which Nejedlý censures the conservatory, as well as his demand to see new personnel installed: Let us just recall our conservatory, an institution where Czech musicians were supposed to be trained! Was it our institution? It was controlled by a German aristocracy that regulated it both financially and spiritually. Shaping the conservatory’s agenda was this unpatriotic, inhumane attitude, and even those Czechs who had an influence over its leadership submitted to this feudal-German spirit . . . It was due to this thralldom—which produced so many slavish souls among our musicians—that the free-thinking Smetana towered above them like a hero, whose\n\nSvatos.indd 12\n\n9/17/2018 10:31:21 AM\n\nmartin ů ’s\n\nPARISIAN CRITICISM\n\n❧\n\n13\n\ngreatness the feeble minds of these little people could not comprehend. This must end once and for all. In the future, our music needs to be morally Czech not only through our strong individuals, but our musical attitude needs to be thoroughly Czech in the way that the civic honor of our musicians demands it. And taking steps towards this goal will be our primary task.18\n\nThese excerpts show how much Nejedlý had intermeshed patriotic morality with musical considerations, notwithstanding the extremes to which he went to argue his views. As we read Nejedlý’s writings, we are often surprised by the skill with which he could spin the news of the day in order to promote his particular agenda for Czech music. Yet the grounds for his views were usually quite consistent, as he argued the same points over the course of many years. This we can see in his case against Dvořák, who, as he claimed, had ties to the Czech bourgeoisie, the conservatory, and the oppressive Austrian state, and whose “regressive” music, if anything, could only “fill in the gaps” in the Czech repertoire before Smetana had arrived on the scene.19 But to champion Smetana in the 1920s? In what way could Smetana remain a viable point of departure for Czech music at a time romanticism was becoming an historical phenomenon? And by what means could the younger generation of Czech musicians oppose Nejedlý’s views?\n\nMartinů’s Early Years in Prague Martinů had a thorough knowledge of Prague’s musical life by the time he launched his polemics in 1924. He had come to Prague as a music student in 1906 from the eastern Bohemian town of Polička, whose influential citizens hoped he would bring the town recognition by becoming a famous violinist.20 Rather than working diligently towards this goal, he lived a nonconformist lifestyle where practice and academic work took second place to the whims of artistic exploration. For Martinů, this meant reading the trendy decadent literature of the time,21 attending opera performances with his friend and violinist Stanislav Novák (1890–1945; see fig. 1),22 and writing the kinds of works he felt were necessary for his development as a composer. It was at this time that he discovered Debussy, and in place of the strict theoretical exercises he was being assigned at the conservatory and the programmatic works that were of interest to Prague’s academic milieu, assimilating Debussy’s style became a matter of sudden importance. His orchestral scores such as Dream of the Past (1920) and As Midnight Passes (1922) were the result of his autodidactic study of Debussy’s musical language, making him virtually the first Czech composer to fully embrace the French impressionist style.23 Despite the recognition he received in 1918 with his neoromantic, patriotic cantata Czech Rhapsody, a work that nods to both Smetana and Mahler (the cataclysms\n\nSvatos.indd 13\n\n9/17/2018 10:31:22 AM\n\n14\n\n❧\n\nchapter one\n\nof Mahler’s “Resurrection” Symphony come vividly to the surface),24 Martinů was soon stigmatized by the critics as a “Czech impressionist.” Helping establish this stereotype was Otakar Ostrčil, who recognized the emphasis on tone color in Martinů’s symbolist ballets Night (1914) and Shadow (1916) while reviewing these works in 1919 for performances at the Prague National Theater. And it was on the basis of tone color that Ostrčil rejected both works for being “monotone,” citing an overuse of celeste, harp, and piano. Ostrčil justified his dismissal of Shadow, in particular, for its “trendy harmonic piquancy achieved by the direct connection of harmonically distant triads.”25 The characterization of Martinů the impressionist is clearly found in the reviews of this time. But the way the Czech critics often appraised new works according to their “depth of expression” is worthy of note. In a review of a 1923 concert featuring Blue Hour, the second movement of Martinů’s orchestral triptych As Midnight Passes, one dismissive critic notes: The Czech Philharmonic continues with its “dumping” of Czech novelties . . . Blue Hour by Bohuslav Martinů . . . already shows an inclination towards decadent symbolism. It is in essence the first conscious and thorough manifestation of French impressionism in our country. Unfortunately, Martinů does not always choose the best characteristics of this style, which is borne witness by the many unison melodies . . . I would like to believe that this is a trifle by a composer who will return once again to a deep, Czech conception.26\n\nAlso showing the way “depth of expression” served as criteria to dismiss inferior works, we find the following commentary that emerged in the daily press after the premiere of Martinů’s ballet Ishtar (1921): “Much was said and written about how the work is filled with French spirit. And by this, they all had in mind something musically sinful and lacking in depth. Nevertheless, it was deemed good that a composer was found who sacrificed himself to fill in our musical rainbow with French colors!”27 In his essay “Something about that ‘French’ Influence,” Martinů explains the hypocrisy behind the Czech critics’ rejection of French music and how this had led him to leave Prague for Paris.28 If French music was really superficial and unworthy of critical thought, he argued, why was so much effort needed to show it in this light? Martinů had always seen much more in the music of France, particularly the ideals of “lightness, clarity, and a sense for pure form,” the particular characteristics he felt Prague’s “German metaphysics” eschewed.29 And the composer he felt could help him achieve these ideals was Albert Roussel, whose music he played as a member of the Czech Philharmonic, and whom he called on for instruction once he arrived in the French capital in 1923.30 Martinů’s experience as an orchestral violinist greatly broadened his horizons and inspired him to pursue his career abroad. In 1919, a representative orchestra had formed under the conductor Václav Talich that performed in several Western\n\nSvatos.indd 14\n\n9/17/2018 10:31:23 AM\n\nmartin ů ’s\n\nPARISIAN CRITICISM\n\n❧\n\n15\n\nEuropean cities, including Geneva, Paris, and London. This had been a propaganda effort by the first Czechoslovak government intended to exhibit to its Western allies the cultural prowess of the new nation. Martinů joined the ensemble for this tour, and upon his return to Prague, he became a full member of the Czech Philharmonic Orchestra, of which Talich had been just appointed director. As a composer, Martinů would soon win Talich’s sympathies, beginning an essential professional relationship that grew over the course of his career. Talich’s emergence as the Czech Philharmonic’s director was a milestone in Prague’s musical life, as his insistence on not necessarily prioritizing Czech works placed him on the front lines of debate. Indeed, Talich, along with Martinů, belonged to the new generation of “republican” musicians who combated isolationist tendencies.31 Talich was often challenged by the Nejedlý School for his programming decisions, and as one of the elite Czech musicians with international prestige, the fact that he accepted guest conducting engagements with foreign orchestras rather than devoting his full attention to the musical scene at home made him morally suspect.32 Nevertheless, Talich insisted on bringing Czech music into a dialogue with new works from abroad. This we can see in the Czech Philharmonic’s program for the 1920–21 season, where he brought recent works by Ravel, Honegger, Stravinsky, and Prokofiev to Prague’s public for the first time.33 The Nejedlý School would continue to project controversy onto Talich for several years to come, with the debates surrounding him reaching a climax during his nomination to the directorship of the Prague National Theater in 1935. The extremes of debate over the appointment of Ostrčil’s successor went so far that one anonymous commentator remarked: “I put forth as very distasteful at the very least—even if A. Bendová (Milcová?) was writing ironically—the notion that Talich does not beat his breast and sign himself with the cross every time Smetana’s name is pronounced.”34\n\nMartinů on Stravinsky With this backdrop in mind, we can begin to understand why Martinů embraced Stravinsky upon his arrival in Paris, something that resulted in no less than six essays on the Russian composer in 1924, all written for Prague’s cultural press. In Stravinsky, Martinů saw a force that could disrupt and shatter the norms by which he felt the Czech critics were still guiding public taste.35 But by championing Stravinsky, Martinů soon gained the reputation of having slavishly submitted to the Russian composer, something critics generally agreed upon after hearing his Half-Time, an orchestral work bearing the conspicuous influence of Stravinsky’s Russian ballets. Challenging Prague’s public in 1924 with the leading voice of Parisian modernism was a timely occasion. First, it was the year of the monumental Smetana centennial birth celebrations, which saw the performance of virtually the entire output of\n\nSvatos.indd 15\n\n9/17/2018 10:31:25 AM\n\n16\n\n❧\n\nchapter one\n\nSmetana between 2 March and 12 May, the dates of the composer’s birth and death. The Nejedlý School was out in full force promoting Smetana’s cause, producing a special volume of Smetana as well as several monographs and pamphlets, all of which were devoted to the composer.36 And presiding at the podium of the pious assemblies commemorating the patriarch of Czech music, of course, was none other than Zdeněk Nejedlý.37 Second, 1924 was the year Prague hosted the orchestral portion of the ISCM’s annual festival.38 This was seen by the Nejedlý School and others as a chance not only to familiarize foreign visitors with Smetana, but to provide them with a taste of contemporary Czech works as well. The atmosphere of these two events formed the context to one of Martinů’s earliest essays, “Along the Path to Stravinsky,” in which he criticizes the slogan “return to Smetana” as being resounded without thought or clarification.39 In an era that has changed both spiritually and politically, Martinů exhorts the Czech critics to be more specific about how a return to Smetana should take shape. For Martinů, taking the example of Smetana means coming to terms with the times in a relevant way. Very much in the way Smetana had responded to the politically liberalized situation in Bohemia during the 1860s, Igor Stravinsky has traversed the changes in cosmopolitan life to produce a corresponding musical expression.40 In Czech music criticism, however, responding to the times has been held up by a vicious cycle of re-historicizing the past, and the slogan “return to Smetana” only inspires imitation of “what has already been composed better in the past.” Facilitating a new direction in Czech music means opening the doors to experimentation, a course of action Martinů urges as follows: “This is not a time for great, isolated works, of which there were only a few over the course of history. This is a time for searching and preparing the field for those who are coming.”41 He then notes how artists and intellectuals in other fields have managed to liberate themselves from the entrenched aesthetic values: “We saw this battle in painting, literature, and philosophy. We saw that these artists desired realistic, almost life-like expression, without concern for all the wringing rules, laws, and phrases that were created over time and usually dictated by the strongest individual but never truly investigated.”42 Music, too, needs to be set free from the dogmatic rhetoric of the past, which has been in the exclusive service of romanticism. Instead, the aesthetic of the day should reflect the intensified pace of the modern age: “Life is strict, inconsiderate, and fast; it does not leave time for fumbling around in the extremities of feeling. It demands intensity—a forceful, compact form and concentrated contents.”43 And this, according to Martinů, is the very aesthetic that Stravinsky has captured in his music. What Stravinsky meant to Martinů at this time can also be seen in the way he relates the Russian composer to Schoenberg, atonality, and “German music” in general. In his essay “Igor Stravinsky,” after explaining how Stravinsky now finds himself at the divide between the “romantic, subjective era” and the one that is “new and\n\nSvatos.indd 16\n\n9/17/2018 10:31:26 AM\n\nmartin ů ’s\n\nPARISIAN CRITICISM\n\n❧\n\n17\n\nobjective,” he writes that Schoenberg was “the first to see the mistaken path along which music had been led astray, but it was difficult for him to overcome his deep, inborn German romanticism.”44 In his essay “Stravinsky’s Petrushka,” in which he argues that Stravinsky’s approach is based on the principles of “objectivity and dynamism,” he notes that the new style of Petrushka is facilitated “by a healthy musicality that called for the lucid expression of musical ideas amid the atonal chaos that reigned after impressionism.”45 And in his essay for a Czech Philharmonic concert program (discussed further below), he describes how Stravinsky’s new, dynamistic style has marginalized German romanticism and its worn-out musical gestures from the new musical mainstream of Europe: “Stravinsky does not like German music, reproaching it for its contrived pathos and “manufacturing” of emotions that persevere through the help of characteristic motives that are purely German. His style is the music of the West.”46\n\nThe Half-Time Affair During his 1924 summer holidays in Polička, Martinů composed Half-Time (Rondo for Large Orchestra), a work inspired by the commotion of excited crowds awaiting the results of a close soccer match. It is a composition that bears mannerisms conspicuously similar to the music of Stravinsky, so much that it triggered scorn in the Czech musical press, leading a number of critics, including the conductor Jaroslav Vogel (1894–1970), to accuse Martinů of plagiarism.47 This is somewhat understandable, as Martinů’s work has dissonant tone clusters with irregular accents similar to those in “The Dance of the Adolescents” from The Rite of Spring as well as parallel diatonic triads very much in the style of the “Russian Dance” from Petrushka.48 But Martinů vehemently denied the charges of plagiarism in his response to the critics entitled “The Case of Half-Time, or the Tragedy of a Melodic Triad.”49 With the title of this essay, Martinů was referring to the ascending triad encompassed by an augmented octave (F–B♭–D–F#) that is played by a solo trumpet at the opening of his work. This, some critics believed, was a direct borrowing of the solo trumpet motive that characterizes the puppet figure Petrushka in Stravinsky’s ballet. The polemical exchange that developed between Martinů and Vogel towards the end of 1924 sheds light on the position that Martinů was taking in the Czech musical world. For the concert program of the Czech Philharmonic’s performance on 23 November 1924, which featured Stravinsky’s symphonic tone poem Song of the Nightingale, Martinů wrote another essay entitled simply “Igor Stravinsky,” which he conceived as an informative source for an audience in Prague that was presumably unfamiliar with the composer.50 Based on this premise, Martinů refrains from treating Stravinsky’s music analytically, choosing instead to discuss the principal characteristics of his style and to show what his music “aims to do.” Describing the state of European music before Stravinsky had arrived on the scene, Martinů argues that the\n\nSvatos.indd 17\n\n9/17/2018 10:31:27 AM\n\n18\n\n❧\n\nchapter one\n\ndominating influences of romanticism and impressionism had gone unquestioned and that the elements of rhythm and tonality had lost definition due to an unceasing desire for sentiment. Citing various experimental works by Schoenberg and Les Six, Martinů claims that only Stravinsky has prevailed in establishing a new direction, of which the principal traits are “a strict suppression of romanticism and subjectivism, and a return to absolute musical values.”51 Martinů’s program notes became the primary target of Vogel’s review of the same concert for the daily newspaper Československá republika.52 Vogel scoffs at how the battle over Stravinsky has been finally transmitted home by a musician “living at the very center of the cult of Stravinsky.” He states that, “there is nothing more comical and more provincial than to incite battles over artistic issues that have been resolved elsewhere long ago.” He warns, however, that Czech musicians should not take the example of “an ostrich that hides its head in the sand with the notion that its pose will be all the more astute through the expression of national spirit.” After all, Smetana and Dvořák had both reckoned with foreign influence without having damaged themselves. Then, taking a swipe at the composer who had become known in recent years as a “Czech impressionist,” he writes: “That a weaker artistic figure capitulates and becomes estranged from our national spirit through this kind of contact—should we let this distract us from the way fresh international contact enriches our strongest creative figures?”53 From these remarks, we see that Vogel believes that Czech composers should not veer from the national tradition but remain aware of new music from abroad. But in his review of Half-Time, which was premiered by the Czech Philharmonic under Talich on 7 December 1924, we see a critic ready to denounce literal manifestations of foreign style with an iron hand.54 After expressing skepticism over the concept of the work as explained by the “not always dependable commentary” of the Czech Philharmonic concert program but conceding that the work does have “an outer vigor and instrumental shine,” Vogel maintains: Everyone will get stuck by the irresponsibility with which the Czech composer copies Stravinsky, not only in his compositional and instrumental mannerisms, but also literally and motivically: the entire conclusion is based on the march theme from Petrushka . . . There is a complete difference between learning from a master and imitating him. A genuine imitation of a unique composer is to be unique oneself. But if Mr. Martinů’s understanding does not change, we can expect to have the kind of “Czech Stravinsky” like the “Czech Strauss” we already have. This opinion was shared by the public, which received the composition with an almost unanimous hiss. This is an uncommon phenomenon for a Czech audience, and this has not even happened to the genuine Stravinsky. Thus on the whole, Half-Time, after Ishtar, was a disappointment rather than a strengthening of hope in this composer.55\n\nMartinů then made Vogel his central target in his response to the critics, where he apologizes sarcastically, “the length of this article does not allow me to address all the\n\nSvatos.indd 18\n\n9/17/2018 10:31:28 AM\n\nmartin ů ’s\n\nPARISIAN CRITICISM\n\n❧\n\n19\n\nmistakes in your reviews.”56 On the issue of plagiarism, Martinů contends that the form, motivic development, and instrumentation of Half-Time is unlike anything in the four parts of Petrushka, and he recommends that Vogel carefully study the score, challenging him to point out exactly what he had copied. He writes, “I cannot torture myself with the similarity of that motive (i.e., the melodic triad) with the Petrushka motive, since, in my case, it only takes place on the upbeat and has an insignificant role in the entire composition.”57 It is the rhythmic aspect that can be linked to Stravinsky rather than those places “here or there that have a similarity to Stravinsky’s work.”58 He then cries out: If Half-Time is taken from Stravinsky, this means that you know Stravinsky very little. But Stravinsky is something new, something different, thus everything that is unusual is a copy of Stravinsky—and all the more so in my case since I defended him as a journalist. This is criticism based on assumption and deduction, a style that is in full bloom in our country. And this is why I am writing this article, because this characteristic of criticism has been disconcerting me for the longest time—i.e., making statements based merely on the most conspicuous elements.59\n\nThe Significance of Half-Time In his response to the critics, Martinů completely refuted the dependence of HalfTime on Stravinsky. And before his response, in his notes on the work for the Czech Philharmonic’s concert program, he had deliberately downplayed the importance of the opening motive that would later become a subject of criticism: “The principal motive presented by the trumpet at the opening does not play as great a role as the tiny secondary motive—derived from the opening one—which continuously drives forward the tension that increases throughout the rondo.”60 Since Martinů was already defending the opening motive before the critics even heard the work, we can assume that, on some level, he had anticipated the accusations that were to come—i.e., that he had derived the opening motive, and perhaps even more, from Petrushka. But throughout the polemic, Martinů refused to admit that the work’s sound world would invite comparison with Stravinsky, something that might perplex us today. Indeed, it is difficult for us to separate Half-Time from the composer he lauded so much at that time, regardless of the way he defended the work. The most he was willing to concede is that the rhythmical style has a link to Stravinsky, an aspect he called “dynamistic” in his Parisian Criticism, which was a stylistic idea at the center of his thought.61 But the way he suddenly distanced himself from Stravinsky’s influence—despite Stravinsky’s clear imprint on the work—and the way he so vigorously defended the work’s autonomy, makes us ask why Half-Time was so important to him and what he was trying to do. Based on his letter to Talich, it was first and foremost a defiance of\n\nSvatos.indd 19\n\n9/17/2018 10:31:31 AM\n\n20\n\n❧\n\nchapter one\n\nthose Czech critics who habitually listened for depth of expression and metaphysical content: “What I definitely wanted to accentuate—and what my explicit intention was—is an outright reversal of the direction that is particularly prevalent in our country, signified by the most sublime, metaphysical ideas that are completely outof-touch with contemporary life.”62 In this sense, Half-Time was clearly a challenge to the Czech critical establishment. By assimilating and (perhaps unconsciously) demonstrating an array of Stravinskian mannerisms, he was hoping to expose the “one-dimensional” nature of Czech critical opinion and raise controversy as well. But apart from this, the work held significance for Martinů in the way it was conceived. It was one of the “unexpected works” that surprised him over the course of his career, compositional milestones that made the creative process a subject of intense speculation in his American Diaries, as we will see. In his letter to Talich, we already see him attempting to depict his creative process and the way he had produced this particular work. After stating that Half-Time “does not follow any sublime idea” and that the resulting work is not in any way “descriptive or impressionistic,” he writes: “The experiences that inspired me do not become manifest during that first phase, when I am taking in these sensations, but during that second one, when I am in control of these sensations, and I create a new form from them, a new work that is independent, and I create this new work through a pure musical form, the form of a rondo.”63 Drawing on his creative process to support his aesthetic claims was not yet typical of his critical project, however. Instead, he continued his polemics with essays that shifted away from Stravinsky and focused on the issues of national bias through a much broader lens. As an epilogue to his first full year in Paris, we may turn to his letter to Stanislav Novák from 7 February 1925, which sums up his frustrations at this time. Commenting on the reviews to his ballet Who Is the Most Powerful in the World? (1922), which was premiered as the opener to Janáček’s Cunning Little Vixen in Brno on 31 January 1925, he writes: Please, tell everyone you meet that my ballet about mice is three years old, so it comes from a time I didn’t know anything about Stravinsky, or only that he had written Petrushka . . . It seems a bit stupid to me, being constantly passed off as Stravinsky. If Axman had written it, for example, it would have been a great revelation, and we would all be up-to-date with Europe. But since it’s me, I cribbed it from somewhere. I really don’t care for the most part, but I’ll get into a cage once again like I did with impressionism. No one mentions my complete submission to Debussy anymore—now I’ve completely submitted to Stravinsky. These are both along the same lines, right? They’re complete idiots. The humor comes when Černušák64 writes that it plays to my advantage to go with the times as opposed to those who have something to say from within. As if today’s times do not have something to say from within. Or that it’s a mistake for someone to be oriented “internationally” . . . So to hell with it. But if you talk to them, just tell them these things straight to their face.65\n\nSvatos.indd 20\n\n9/17/2018 10:31:32 AM\n\nChapter Two\n\nGeneral Polemics Despite the new stereotype Martinů acquired with Half-Time, the work did have an impact on the “direction particularly prevalent” in his country, as he had remarked in his letter to Talich. For the 1925 ISCM festival, the organizers—due to the success of their festival in 1924—chose Prague once again as the host city for the performance of orchestral music,1 and Half-Time was even chosen by the society’s international delegates as a representative work from Czechoslovakia. The ISCM’s Czech delegates, however, who insisted on presenting only “their prominent figures,”2 put forth Vítězslav Novák’s Toman and the Wood Nymph and Rudolf Karel’s Sinfonie Démon,3 both symphonic poems. In the end, the foreign critics in attendance at the festival dismissed the works by Novák and Karel, with Karel’s work in particular being reproved for an overdependence on Strauss. Martinů’s Half-Time, however, received considerable praise.4 Also receiving the praise of the foreign critics was Janáček’s opera Cunning Little Vixen, which was being performed at the Prague National Theater at that time. The responses to the 1925 ISCM festival revealed the widening chasm between the conservatism of the Nejedlý School and those seeking to embrace the European avant-garde, for whom Martinů became the principal spokesman.5 The new discourse surrounding the festival prompted Martinů to write “On Music and Tradition,” in which he takes issue with Czech isolationist tendencies: “At a time the whole world is boiling over with questions, experiments, and the search for new horizons, everything flows like an evening song in our country such that it cannot get any better. We lavish praise on ourselves about how well we have come to terms with things and about how smart we are while the rest of the world is in error.”6 The reason for this attitude, he explains, is that the Czech critics are reluctant to abandon the nationalist values that were so heavily ingrained in the population before independence, when music had served as a symbol of resistance. He calls for a de-politicization of music, or an end to the paranoid atmosphere in which “deviations” from tradition can be perceived as national betrayal. Then, coming perhaps as close as ever to a direct strike at Nejedlý, he chastises the revisionist politics of the far left that have intertwined the “chosen” composers with the class struggle to the point\n\nSvatos.indd 21\n\n9/17/2018 10:31:34 AM\n\n22\n\n❧\n\nchapter two\n\nof absurdity: “We know and honor our Smetana, but that he was a Bolshevik? This is a bit too much. With equal difficulty will we accept that Dvořák was a bourgeois composer and Fibich a proletarian.”7 He continues by describing how the critics have comingled a host of other concepts with music such as “religiosity,” “emotionality,” and “spirituality,” and how it has become the tendency to regard music as something sorrowful and hopelessly tragic. No one seems to care anymore that those works put forth as the models of national music are not a negation of life but an elevation of it. Everyone stands by, nevertheless, passively accepting the pretense of music as the embodiment of suffering. Once composers begin to bypass the labyrinth of passwords and prescriptions that have become necessary for creating the perfect work, the changes transpiring in European music will be able to impact national tradition. But the fear of contemporary music lies in the fact that it is believed to suppress emotion, and in Czech music criticism, “emotional content” is still paramount in the appraisal of new works. It has become customary, in fact, to filter music though a “cloud of feeling,” and if this continues, he writes ironically, attending concerts will no longer be necessary, as “we will only have to read the emotional analyses.” These tendencies, characteristic of the “reigning direction” of Czech music criticism, are closely tied to the fact that the established tastes adhere to an antiquated, German-centered aesthetic. Martinů raises awareness of this in another essay from the time of the 1925 ISCM festival entitled “Towards the Criticism of Contemporary Music.” Here he links this German bias to the critics’ unwillingness to deal with new music objectively.8 After some careful opening lines in which he asks not to be taken with belligerence, he lashes out at a valuation system that is employed to justify divisive and erroneous findings: “The unhealthiness of this phenomenon is apparent in today’s chaos, which is responsible for the many antagonisms and inconsistencies in the critical writings . . . It is self-evident that, over time, false conclusions were drawn on many matters that became complete dogma, and it was upon this basis that critical opinion was built and perpetuated.”9 Impressionism, for example, was simply condemned as superficial and inferior, without any indication of why. Since little attempt was made to determine the real nature of impressionism, stylistic responses to it were misunderstood as well. He writes that no one will ever be able to prove to him that there is an innate sense in Czech character for “German heaviness,” which can be crude in its extremes. He then makes an intriguing remark about Schoenberg, a composer he feels lacks the synthetic approach necessary for contemporary style: “Let us take Schoenberg who is defended by all kinds of people. Where is the synthesis of his expression?”10 He then lectures the critics about their habit of going to concerts simply to learn how much a work agrees with their preconception of the composer. Since the ideas of compositional practice are now supplanting the established views, we will need to give up our past preferences and come to terms with what is happening: “A new\n\nSvatos.indd 22\n\n9/17/2018 10:31:35 AM\n\ngeneral polemics\n\n❧\n\n23\n\nera is coming, one of the greatest and most beautiful in history, which will gradually correct all the mistakes of the critics and aestheticians.”11 Also from 1925 comes one of Martinů’s longest Parisian essays, entitled “On Contemporary Music,” where he shifts momentarily to a critique of Paris and the way it encourages novelty and excess.12 Now after having spent some more time in the French capital, he sees the drawbacks to perpetual experimentation, especially in terms of how quickly new styles get coined and codified: “Let us take note of how almost all contemporary music takes shape through slogans. These slogans are often quite surprising and become practically a prescription for creating new works, which, in most cases, give us only the appearance of pioneering importance and sensation.”13 As a result of this phenomenon, new stylistic movements emerge from the way a single musical element undergoes new and exaggerated treatment. The “suppression of harmony,” for example, has led to an overemphasis on polyphony, but in his opinion, to a style with careless voice leading. The “suppression of chromaticism” has brought about an overtly diatonic style, but to the extent where we can expect chromaticism to be the norm once again. A pendulum effect of this kind can also be seen in the renunciation of sound color, where we now have music for increasingly smaller ensembles and styles that avoid idiomatic sonorities. And the idea of “dynamism” has promoted rhythm from being a “simultaneous” element to one that controls the music and produces the dominating effect. This tendency has produced a remarkable result: it is now possible for the model work of a new stylistic movement to be a mere deformation by a composer who is not in control of his musical material.14 And this encourages other composers to counteract with their own deformations, just for the sake of originality. Indeed, one sign of originality is to employ dissonance as an expressive element; avoiding it altogether can also be seen as pioneering. Martinů then turns his attention to Prague, where a work that is perceived to have an emotional or philosophical program is immediately hailed as an attempt “to unravel the inner problems of spiritual life.” It is common practice for such works to be considered “unusually mighty and perfect,” but he downplays them as “very cheap novels.” He writes that a strict discipline of musical laws will soon replace the critical method by which the forces of nature can be found in the music and employed to help portray the work; on the way out, too, is the “descriptive method,” through which the work is shown to depict some inner emotional state. Indeed, the contemporary musician cannot help but lose confidence in a new work when the critic writes that it is filled with “the thunder of an emotional vortex.” He clarifies, however, that he does not have in mind new works where intense emotionality is in agreement with musical laws, but those where emotionality has been brought to the fore against the work’s inner logic. In order to realize a specific musical idea, the composer must disregard the demand for emotional display and stay within his musical parameters:\n\nSvatos.indd 23\n\n9/17/2018 10:31:35 AM\n\n24\n\n❧\n\nchapter two\n\nIt is harder not to write down what occurs to us—i.e., to give a composition only what it needs. This means to be in control of the context, form, style, and expression, and this is a goal that even the greatest masters achieved only after much hard work. In our country a work that seems pure and clear is immediately condemned as superficial or transparent. This is because the battle was under control and not so apparent. On the surface, nothing testified to uneasiness or heaviness of expression.15\n\nHe then remarks on the way tradition is bandied about by critics who no longer know what they mean by the word. It has come to the point where disagreements among critics can lead a composer to be considered a progressive nationalist and regressive traitor, both at the same time. He admits ironically to having heard such “beautiful phrases” about “country” and “holding fast to the soil,” but these phrases tell us little about the actual nature of the work: “When we talk about tradition, we should realize that it is not something “stable.” A new work might come that is different, but it will still be Czech."
