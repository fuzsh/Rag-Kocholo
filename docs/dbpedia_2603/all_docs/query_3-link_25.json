        "text": "LEXINGTON, Ky. (Oct. 26, 2021) — Looking for a musical start to your holiday weekend? Join the University of Kentucky Symphony Orchestra for an evening of thrilling music featuring Dmitri Shostakovich’s Symphony No. 5 and a Halloween-centric performance of UK composer-in-residence Joseph Baber’s “Frankenstein.” This concert will begin 7:30 p.m. Friday, Oct. 29, at the Singletary Center for the Arts Concert Hall.\n\nThe concert will open with John Adams’ “Short Ride in a Fast Machine,” an exuberant orchestral fanfare full of surprises. This will be followed by a Kentucky premiere of Ahmed Adnan Saygun’s “Ayin Raksi” (Ritual Dance), which incorporates Turkish folk songs and culture.\n\nNext on the program is Baber’s “Frankenstein” to commemorate his retirement after a long career at the UK School of Music that began in 1972. This piece draws excerpts from his larger work “Frankenstein: Opera in Four Acts.”\n\nConcluding the program is Dimitri Shostakovich’s emotional and dramatic Symphony No. 5. At the time of its composition, Shostakovich’s artistic reputation, and perhaps his life, was on the line after being denounced by the Soviet government. The wildly popular premier in 1937 reestablished Shostakovich as the Soviet Union’s preeminent composer.\n\nUK doctoral students Sean Radermacher and Merih Erdem Özden will be joining Maestro John Nardolillo in conducting during this concert.\n\nFounded in 1918, the UKSO is a 100-member all-student orchestra, presenting classical, chamber, opera and education concerts. The group is made up of undergraduate and graduate students from across the United States, Asia, South America, Africa and Europe. The orchestra has regularly performed with world-renowned concert artists including Itzhak Perlman, Lang Lang, Sarah Chang, Gil Shaham, Lynn Harrell, Marvin Hamlisch, Denyce Graves, Christine Brewer, Pink Martini, Ronan Tynan, Mark O’Connor, Wynonna Judd, Keith Lockhart and Arlo Guthrie.\n\nUK’s orchestra has performed at Carnegie Hall in New York and the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., tours the state of Kentucky regularly, and has toured China, playing concerts in major concert halls in Shanghai, Tianjin, Hangzhou, Yangzhou and Beijing. The orchestra’s performance at Beijing’s National Centre for the Performing Arts was broadcast on China Central Television, a network reaching more than 1.5 billion viewers. In the fall of 2010, the orchestra played for the opening ceremonies of the World Equestrian Games, a performance that featured more than 1,500 performers and 200 horses that was seen live on NBC in the United States by 39 million people, and by an estimated 500 million more television viewers worldwide.\n\nMaestro John Nardolillo has appeared with more than 30 of the country’s leading orchestras, including the Boston Pops, the National Symphony, and principal orchestras of Seattle, San Francisco, Detroit, Atlanta, Dallas, Milwaukee, Utah, Columbus, Indianapolis, Oregon, Fort Worth, Buffalo, Alabama, Louisville, Missouri, North Carolina, Toledo, Vermont, Columbus, Omaha and Hawaii. He also recently conducted concerts at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C.; the Kimmel Center in Philadelphia; and Carnegie Hall in New York. Nardolillo made his professional conducting debut in 1994 at the Sully Festival in France and has since made conducting appearances in the United States, France, Germany, Italy, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Austria, the Czech Republic and China. He has led major American orchestras in subscription series concerts, summer and pops concerts, education concerts and tours, and for television and radio broadcasts. Nardolillo is the artistic director of the Prague Summer Nights Music Festival, and in 2004, he joined the faculty at the UK School of Music, where he serves as the director of orchestras.\n\nTickets for UK Symphony Orchestra concerts are $10 for general admission, $4 for students, and free for UK students with a valid ID before the day of the performance (at the Singletary Center ticket office). Tickets are available through the Singletary Center ticket office online at www.scfatickets.com, by phone at 859-257-4929, or in person at the venue. Children 6 and older are welcome.\n\nThe Singletary Center is preparing to welcome audiences to events this semester but requests that everyone, whether vaccinated or unvaccinated, remain masked at all times. The safety policy applies to students, faculty, staff and community visitors."
