        "text": "Alexei Haieff was born in Blagoveshchensk, Siberia, on August 25, 1914. He received his primary education at Harbin, Manchuria, China. He emigrated to the United States in 1931, first studying privately with Constantin Schwedoff (1933-34) and then at Juilliard School of Music (1934-38) with Rubin Goldmark and Frederick Jacobi. During 1938-40 he studied with Nadia Boulanger in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and Paris.\n\nIn addition to composing and teaching privately, Haieff was an accompanist to singer Olga Averino (1938-40), and led the Woody Herman Orchestra on tour in 1946. He received Guggenheim fellowships in 1946 and 1949, won a prize from the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 1946, and was a Fellow at the American Academy in Rome from 1947-48. In an article that appeared in the New York Times Sunday Magazine of March 14, 1948 (located in Series 5, box 1, folder 6), Aaron Copland remarked that Haieff not only had a strong affinity with the music of Stravinsky but was a close personal friend as well. In 1952, the New York Music Critics Circle cited three works, among them Haieff's Piano Concerto, as one of the best musical compositions for that year.\n\nHaieff was composer-in-residence at the American Academy in Rome (1952-53), was a professor at the University of Buffalo (1962-68), and was composer-in-residence at the University of Utah from (1968-70). In the last years of his life, he and his wife Sheila, lived in Italy.\n\nAlexei Haieff died on March 1, 1994.\n\nThe Alexei Haieff Papers provide a detailed view of the career of the Russian-American composer. In many cases, the evolution of his works can be viewed in multiple stages, from sketches to the final composition. Such access to different compositional manifestations provides scholars and musicians with a unique view of the creative process.\n\nWhile the amount of Haieff's personal papers is not voluminous, there are numerous clippings and programs that trace his career, as well as personal documents and correspondence that shed light on his life and professional activities.\n\nThe Alexei Haieff papers are arranged in six series:"
