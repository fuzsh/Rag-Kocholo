        "text": "It is astonishing how much bad music has been called good in the course of the 20th century, and especially since the end of World War II. That is when such anti-tonal composers as Milton Babbitt, Pierre Boulez, John Cage, Elliott Carter, and Karlheinz Stockhausen gained effective control over the new-music establishment in Europe and America, in the process ruthlessly freezing out other artists who continued to assert the validity of traditional tonality.\n\nIn point of fact, the “innovations” of these composers were scarcely more than evasions—futile attempts to mask their own inability to renew and refresh the musical tradition they had inherited. Arnold Schoenberg, inventor of twelve-tone serialism and spiritual grandfather of the postwar avant-garde, once remarked truly that “there is a great deal more to be said in the key of C major.” The pity is that he failed to recognize (or admit) how little of interest he himself had to say in that key, or any other. That Schoenberg and his descendants nonetheless managed to impose their own inadequacies on succeeding generations of composers—if not listeners—is a cultural tragedy of the first order.\n\nBut in the past decade the avant-garde monopoly has been decisively broken. As irony would have it, this happened in part thanks to the arrival on the scene of Philip Glass and his fellow “minimalists,” whose postmodernist works, based on the familiar triad, immediately became hugely popular. Though the music of Glass, John Adams, and Steve Reich has proved too simple-minded to be of enduring interest, its popularity nonetheless served to clear the way for the restoration of tonality as the lingua franca of Western classical music. Today, growing numbers of young American composers are writing in styles that derive directly from the tonal modernism of such major prewar figures as Igor Stravinsky, Dmitri Shostakovich, Benjamin Britten, and Aaron Copland; these “new tonalists” are the vanguard of what seems likely to be the prevailing classical-music style of the 21st century.\n\n_____________\n\nThe breakup of the avant-garde monopoly and the subsequent emergence of the new tonalists has made possible a rewriting of the history of modern music, as well as a revaluation of the historical significance of their predecessors, the tonal modernists.\n\nAs a step in this ongoing process, I have compiled a list of 50 major works written since 1900 by 29 composers, together with recommended recordings of each work. In order to give posterity a chance to speak its piece, I have chosen only works by composers no longer living, which means that the last item on the list was written as long ago as 1969. Otherwise, the sole criterion for inclusion has been not “significance” or “influence” but greatness: the list comprises solely what I believe to be masterpieces of permanent interest.\n\nThe first two installments of this “counter-canon,” consisting of 40 works composed between 1902 and 1944, appeared in the April and May issues of COMMENTARY. By way of a reminder, here they are again, chronologically and in capsule form:\n\n1902: Claude Debussy, Pelléas et Mélisande\n\n1903: Maurice Ravel, String Quartet in F\n\n1904: Giacomo Puccini, Madama Butterfly\n\n1909: Gustav Mahler, Das Lied von der Erde and Symphony No. 9\n\n1910: Richard Strauss, Der Rosenkavalier, Op. 59\n\n1910-1913: Claude Debussy, Preludes for Piano\n\n1911: Jean Sibelius, Symphony No. 4 in A Minor, Op. 63; Igor Stravinsky, Petrushka\n\n1912: Arnold Schoenberg, Pierrot lunaire, Op. 21\n\n1913: Igor Stravinsky, The Rite of Spring\n\n1915: Claude Debussy, Sonata for Flute, Viola and Harp; Jean Sibelius, Symphony No. 5 in E Flat, Op. 82; Manuel de Falla, Nights in the Gardens of Spain\n\n1917: Sergei Prokofiev, Violin Concerto No. 1 in D, Op. 19\n\n1919: Sir Edward Elgar, Cello Concerto in E Minor, Op. 85\n\n1921: Alban Berg, Wozzeck\n\n1925: Leoš Janá?ek, The Makropulos Case\n\n1926: Leoš Janá?ek, Glagolitic Mass\n\n1928: Igor Stravinsky, Apollo\n\n1930: Igor Stravinsky, Symphony of Psalms\n\n1931: Maurice Ravel, Piano Concerto in G\n\n1933: Kurt Weill, The Seven Deadly Sins\n\n1934: Béla Bartók, String Quartet No. 5; Paul Hindemith, Symphony, “Mathis der Maler”; Sergei Rachmaninoff, Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini, Op. 43\n\n1935: Alban Berg, Violin Concerto; George Gershwin, Porgy and Bess; Sir William Walton, Symphony No. 1 in B-Flat Minor\n\n1936: Béla Bartók, Music for Strings, Percussion, and Celesta; Sergei Prokofiev, Romeo and Juliet, Op. 64\n\n1937: Francis Poulenc, Tel jour, telle nuit; Dmitri Shostakovich, Symphony No. 5 in D Minor, Op. 47\n\n1938: Béla Bartók, Violin Concerto No. 2\n\n1940: Paul Hindemith, The Four Temperaments\n\n1941: Aaron Copland, Piano Sonata\n\n1942: Sergei Prokofiev, Piano Sonata No. 7 in B Flat, Op. 83\n\n1943: Benjamin Britten, Serenade for Tenor, Horn, and Strings, Op. 31; Ralph Vaughan Williams, Symphony No. 5 in D\n\n1944: Aaron Copland, Appalachian Spring\n\nNow for the final ten items on the list. These were composed in the decades immediately after the close of World War II—the period when the tonal modernists were most at bay, their music dismissed as irrelevant by aesthetic ideologues who preached the historical inevitability of atonality, serialism, and the still more radical departures from tradition that were introduced starting in the 50’s. Yet, as these ten pieces prove, even when the avant-garde was at its most powerful, great tonal music continued to be written.\n\nFollowing the list I shall conclude this three-part series with some thoughts about canon-making in general and about this counter-canon in particular.\n\n_____________\n\n1947\n\n41. Maurice Duruflé\n\nRequiem\n\nThough Duruflé’s output was modest—fewer than a dozen compositions—this quiet yet profound work, in which plainchant-derived melodic lines are spun over an austere yet unmistakably contemporary harmonic base, immediately established him as a master of modern liturgical music. Duruflé’s Requiem is modeled after Gabriel Fauré’s 1888 setting of the same text, and is directly comparable in every way to its beloved predecessor.\n\nMatthew Best leads the Corydon Singers and the English Chamber Orchestra in a sensitive performance of the 1961 version, rescored for small orchestra (Hyperion CDA66191).\n\n_____________\n\n1948\n\n42. Richard Strauss\n\nFour Last Songs\n\nThe composer of Don Juan and Der Rosenkavalier lived into the era of high modernism, surviving World War II to become the last of the romantic composers. His level of inspiration diminished sharply in the 20’s, but blossomed one final time in these radiantly beautiful orchestral songs, the last of which is an elegy for Strauss himself (the orchestra quotes from his Death and Transfiguration as the solo soprano sings the words “Is this, perhaps, death?”), and by extension for the spirit of German romanticism that dominated classical music throughout the 19th century.\n\nElisabeth Schwarzkopf’s 1953 recording, accompanied by Otto Ackermann and the Philharmonia Orchestra (with Dennis Brain playing the horn solos), is vocally fresher and less mannered than her better-known stereo remake with George Szell (EMI CDH 61001).\n\n_____________\n\n1949\n\n43. Olivier Messiaen\n\nTurangalila-symphonie\n\nThough Messiaen taught Boulez and Stockhausen and even flirted with serialism, he never converted to avant-gardism, choosing instead to remain a mystically inclined neo-romantic who sought to expand the range of musical materials and sonorities available to the tradition-conscious innovator (including the use of actual bird songs, collected and meticulously transcribed by Messiaen himself). His highly individual methods are heard to spectacular effect in the Turangalila-symphonie, a vast orchestral canvas that he described as a “love song [and a] hymn to joy, time, movement, rhythm, life, and death.”\n\nMyung-Whun Chung’s 1991 recording with pianist Yvonne Loriod and the Bastille Orchestra, made in the composer’s presence, incorporates numerous revisions done by Messiaen in preparation for a second edition of the score (DGG 431 781-2).\n\n_____________\n\n1951\n\n44. Erich Wolfgang Korngold\n\nSymphony in F sharp, Op. 40\n\nJust as Strauss was a post-Wagnerian composer, so Korngold was a post-Straussian composer. The surging Jugendstil romanticism of youthful operas like Violanta (1916) and Die tote Stadt (1919-20) was easily translated into the near-identical stylistic idiom of the Hollywood soundtracks he turned out in the 30’s and 40’s. But The Adventures of Robin Hood and Kings Row were not Korngold’s last words as a composer: after World War II, he turned his back on Hollywood and produced a pair of large-scale pieces, a symphony and a violin concerto, in which his musical language became tougher and more challenging. The symphony in particular is fully as impressive as such better-known late-romantic compositions as Strauss’s Four Last Songs and Rachmaninoff’s “Paganini” Rhapsody, and though it went unplayed for three decades after its abortive premiere it is now increasingly regarded as a work whose time has come.\n\nAndré Previn’s recent recording with the London Symphony is exceptionally well performed (DGG 453 346-2).\n\n_____________\n\n1953\n\n45. Samuel Barber\n\nHermit Songs, Op. 29\n\nHermit Songs, premiered by the young Leontyne Price, is the finest and most frequently performed song cycle so far composed by an American. The texts are poems and epigrams scrawled by medieval monks in the margins of manuscripts they were illuminating, and Barber’s settings—by turns wry and passionate—underline the range of emotion found in these enigmatic fragments.\n\nThe best modern recording of Hermit Songs is by the American soprano Barbara Bonney, accompanied by André Previn and sensibly coupled with the other great American song cycle, Aaron Copland’s Twelve Poems of Emily Dickinson (London 289 455 511-2). Also available is a live recording of the 1953 premiere performance by Price and Barber, on a CD that contains as well Price’s studio recording of Barber’s lovely Knoxville: Summer of 1915 (RCA 09026-61983-2).\n\n_____________\n\n1954\n\n46. Benjamin Britten\n\nThe Turn of the Screw, Op. 54\n\nFrom 1945 until his death in 1976, Benjamin Britten devoted himself mainly to opera, and many of the works he composed during those years have since entered the international repertoire. To choose among them is no easy task, but his chamber-opera version of Henry James’s story, “The Turn of the Screw,” is widely considered to be the greatest opera written since World War II, and very possibly the best English-language opera ever. Myfanwy Piper strongly suggests in her libretto what James’s original story left shrouded in doubt—that the children have been sexually molested—and the sinister beauty of Britten’s music adds immeasurably to the terror of the situation.\n\nAn exemplary interpreter of his own music, Britten conducted the first recording of The Turn of the Screw, featuring the cast of the original English Opera Group production (including Sir Peter Pears as Peter Quint). The boxy mono sound does nothing to diminish the unsettling intensity of this historic performance (London 425 672-2, two CD’s).\n\n_____________\n\n1956\n\n47. Francis Poulenc\n\nDialogues of the Carmelites\n\nMany modern opera composers, Benjamin Britten foremost among them, experimented with the possibilities of chamber opera, but the wide range of resources offered by largehouse opera remained an irresistible challenge. No composer met that challenge more effectively than Francis Poulenc in Dialogues of the Carmelites, an operatic version of Georges Bernanos’s play about the persecution and martyrdom of a group of Roman Catholic nuns during the French Revolution. Though the final scene, in which the nuns are guillotined one by one, is a much-admired theatrical tour de force, Poulenc’s opera is especially memorable for its poignant portrayal of how perfect love casts out fear.\n\nThe best recording of Dialogues of the Carmelites is still the original mono version featuring Pierre Dervaux conducting the cast of the 1956 Paris Opera production, many of whom also appeared in the work’s La Scala premiere (EMI CDCB 49331, two CD’s).\n\n_____________\n\n48. Miklós Rózsa\n\nViolin Concerto, Op. 24\n\nLike Erich Wolfgang Korngold, Miklós Rózsa is remembered for the grandiloquent scores he composed for Hollywood, among them such epics as Ben-Hur and King of Kings. But as he hints in the witty title of his 1989 memoirs, A Double Life (also the title of one of the many films he scored), he cultivated paths outside Hollywood, using his film-music fees to support less popular projects. Snobbish critics and performers reflexively dismissed his classical compositions without listening to them, but recent recordings of his music leave little doubt that he was, after Bartók, the foremost Hungarian composer of the 20th century. Jascha Heifetz, one famous instrumentalist who did recognize Rózsa’s genius, commissioned, premiered, and recorded his Violin Concerto, a taut, harmonically astringent work that is as memorable as the better-known concertos of Berg, Bartók, Hindemith, Prokofiev, Shostakovich, and Walton, and deserves an equally prominent place in the standard repertoire.\n\nThe Rózsa Violin Concerto has yet to receive a modern recording by a world-class soloist (Gil Shaham or Maria Bachmann would be ideal), but Heifetz’s 1956 recording with Walter Hendl and the Dallas Symphony, made two months after the premiere, is marvelously incisive, and is coupled on CD with another underrated modern work premiered by Heifetz, Korngold’s D-Major Violin Concerto, Op. 35 (RCA 09026-61752-2).\n\n_____________\n\n1960\n\n49. Dmitri Shostakovich\n\nString Quartet No. 8 in C Minor, Op. 110\n\nRelentlessly pressured to adopt the bland, mindlessly optimistic official style of “socialist realism,” Shostakovich responded by incorporating into his later scores coded messages of dissent. A case in point is the Eighth Quartet, nominally dedicated to “the victims of fascism and war” but actually a musical description of Shostakovich’s own persecution by Soviet cultural commissars. The composer’s “musical signature,” D-E flat-C-B (“D. Sch.” in German notation), is used as the opening theme, and quotations from his earlier works appear throughout the piece, together with a pointed reference to the Russian revolutionary song, “Tortured by Heavy Bondage.” But one need not be aware of the autobiographical message of the Eighth Quartet in order to respond to its harrowing, tragic intensity; it ranks high among the century’s supreme chamber-music masterpieces.\n\nTo judge by their concert performances of the later Shostakovich quartets, the Emerson String Quartet’s forthcoming recording of the complete cycle, to be released by DGG later this year, will be a major musical event. In the meantime, there is a very good “creator” recording made in 1962 by the Beethoven Quartet (Consonance 81-3006).\n\n_____________\n\n1969\n\n50. Dmitri Shostakovich\n\nSymphony No. 14, Op. 135\n\nThe Fourteenth Symphony, an eleven-movement song cycle for soprano, bass, strings, and percussion, is the most powerful of the half-dozen major works Shostakovich composed in the shadow of his impending death. Written in homage to Mussorgsky’s Songs and Dances of Death and Mahler’s Das Lied von der Erde, the Fourteenth Symphony is also, like the Eighth Quartet, an exercise in multiple meanings. The texts—Russian translations of poems by García Lorca, Apollinaire, and Rilke, all describing aspects of death—were intended by Shostakovich to be understood as referring as well to the brutalities inflicted on the Russian people by the ruthless tyrants who ruled them.\n\nMstislav Rostropovich’s incandescent 1973 recording with soprano Galina Vishnevskaya, bass Mark Reshetin, and the Moscow Chamber Orchestra is currently out of print, but Revelation has released a radio broadcast of a contemporary live performance by the same forces (all of whom, except for Rostropovich, also took part in the premiere). The mono sound is serviceable, the interpretation fiery (Revelation RV 10101).\n\n_____________\n\nAfterthoughts\n\nTo draw up a list of 50 modern masterpieces is to spend much of one’s time making hard choices—almost impossible choices, really, since there is no shortage of great music composed in the 20th century. Although a few selections were obvious, others proved inordinately difficult. Not a few, moreover, ended up being almost arbitrary, there being no rational way to decide whether, in the case of a particular composer, one of his masterpieces is “better” than another of similar quality and character.\n\nI gave serious consideration to a number of such pieces. For the record, they included, in alphabetical order: Barber’s Piano Sonata (1949); Bartók’s Concerto for Orchestra (1944); Britten’s A Ceremony of Carols, Op. 28 (1942) and Peter Grimes, Op. 33 (1945); Copland’s Twelve Poems of Emily Dickinson (1950); Debussy’s G-Minor Violin Sonata (1917); Elgar’s The Dream of Gerontius, Op. 38 (1900) and Symphony No. 2 in E Flat, Op. 63 (1911); Gershwin’s An American in Paris (1928);Janá?ek’s String Quartet No. 1 (1923); Prokofiev’s Piano Concerto No. 3 in C, Op. 26 (1921) and Symphony No. 5 in B Flat, Op. 100 (1944); Ravel’s Piano Trio in A Minor (1914) and Left-Hand Piano Concerto (1930); Strauss’s Elektra (1908); Stravinsky’s Les Noces (1917) and Symphony in Three Movements (1945); Vaughan Williams’s Fantasia on a Theme of Thomas Tallis (1910); and Walton’s Viola Concerto (1929) and Variations on a Theme of Paul Hindemith (1962).\n\nIn addition, I considered three works by composers who failed in the end to make the final cut: Leonard Bernstein’s Fancy Free (1944); Gustav Hoist’s The Planets (1918); and Aleksandr Scriabin’s Piano Sonata No. 10, Op. 70 (1913). I also gave thought to pieces by other outstandingly gifted modernists of the second rank. Among them, again in alphabetical order, were: Ernest Bloch’s First Concerto Grosso (1925); Alberto Ginastera’s First Piano Sonata (1951); Percy Grainger’s Lincolnshire Posy (1937); Roy Harris’s Third Symphony (1937); Constant Lambert’s Summers Last Will and Testament (1935); Frank Martin’s Petite Symphonie Concertante (1945); Bohuslav Martinu’s Double Concerto (1938); Sir Michael Tippett’s The Midsummer Marriage (1952); and Peter Warlock’s The Curlew (1922).\n\nAll these possible candidates for inclusion, by the way, are available on CD in excellent performances.\n\n_____________\n\nIt is, I believe, a revealing exercise to break down my final list by composer. Of the 29 composers, the list features:\n\nOne composer, Igor Stravinsky, with four entries.\n\nFour composers with three entries each: Béla Bartók, Claude Debussy, Sergei Prokofiev, Dmitri Shostakovich.\n\nTen composers with two entries each: Alban Berg, Benjamin Britten, Aaron Copland, Paul Hindemith, Leoš Janá?ek, Gustav Mahler, Francis Poulenc, Maurice Ravel, Jean Sibelius, Richard Strauss.\n\nFourteen composers with one entry each: Samuel Barber, Maurice Duruflé, Sir Edward Elgar, Manuel de Falla, George Gershwin, Erich Wolfgang Korngold, Olivier Messiaen, Giacomo Puccini, Sergei Rachmaninoff, Miklós Rózsa, Arnold Schoenberg, Ralph Vaughan Williams, Sir William Walton, Kurt Weill.\n\nEven a casual glance at this four-tiered hierarchy suggests the extent to which my list deviates from conventional accounts of the modern movement in music. To take two conspicuous examples: Arnold Schoenberg, long thought to be Stravinsky’s peer, has here been relegated to the lowest tier, while his pupil Anton Webern, whose music was hugely influential among post-World War II serialists, does not appear at all. Similarly, only one fully serial composition, Berg’s Violin Concerto, is included, and except for Berg’s Wozzeck and Schoenberg’s Pierrot lunaire, none of the other pieces can properly be described as of the atonal school.\n\nNo less interesting is the ethnic distribution of the list: the ratio of Franco-Russian or English-speaking composers to Austro-German composers is almost three to one. Clearly, the geographical center of cultural dominance in classical music shifted decisively during the 20th century. Whatever their ethnic background or cultural loyalties, however, the greatest composers of the century remained steadfast in their allegiance to traditional forms: on the list are eleven symphonies, eight operas, seven ballet scores, and six concertos.\n\nFinally, the chronological scatter of the 50 pieces illustrates the havoc wrought by the postwar avant-garde: 39 were composed prior to 1945, only 11 afterward. Even allowing for the omission of works by living composers, this is a strong indication of the extent to which the momentum of tonal modernism was disrupted after World War II. The fact, moreover, that serialism and the avant-garde failed to produce more than a handful of masterpieces underlines the damage it caused to modern music of any kind. Time and again, as new works praised by prestigious critics turned out to be ugly and unmemorable, concertgoers concluded that there were no modern composers worth hearing, and gave up on all new music, good and bad alike.\n\nOne can only trust that the current revival of tonality will have the consequence of changing public attitudes toward 20th-century music. For the not-so-secret secret is that the supreme masterpieces of our waning century—Sibelius’s Fifth Symphony, Stravinsky’s Symphony of Psalms, Bartók’s Second Violin Concerto, Copland’s Appalachian Spring—are fully as accessible, and as spiritually nourishing, as the best music of Mozart, Schubert, or Brahms. Listening to these sublime works, one recalls the words of Paul Hindemith, tonal modernism’s most eloquent spokesman:\n\nFor the communication of things so far unsaid, the only path now left open to the musician is the one leading to the other dimension of height and depth—to the heights of the spirit (whose potentialities we can grasp by comparison with religion, philosophy, and the pure sciences) and to the depths of the human psyche.\n\n_____________"
