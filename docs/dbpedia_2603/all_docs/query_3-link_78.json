Juilliard gratefully acknowledges additional support provided by the Muriel Gluck Production Fund.\n\nThe Juilliard Preparatory Division is made possible, in part, by the New York State Council on the Arts with the support of the Office of the Governor and the New York State Legislature.\n\nThe Kayden Music Commissioning Program at Juilliard Pre-College has been funded by a substantial gift from Jerold (a Pre-College alumnus) and Stephanie Kayden.\n\nMAP is generously supported through an endowed gift in memory of Carl K. Heyman.\n\nAbout The Juilliard School\n\nDamian Woetzel, President\n\nAdam Meyer, Provost\n\nFounded in 1905, The Juilliard School is a world leader in performing arts education. The school’s mission is to provide the highest caliber of artistic education for gifted musicians, dancers, and actors, composers, choreographers, and playwrights from around the world so that they may achieve their fullest potential as artists, leaders, and global citizens. Juilliard is led by Damian Woetzel, seventh president of the school, who has prioritized affordability and access to the highest level of artistic education while championing Juilliard’s tradition of excellence.\n\nLocated at Lincoln Center in New York City, Juilliard offers undergraduate and graduate degrees in dance, drama (acting and playwriting), and music (classical, jazz, historical performance, and vocal arts). More than 800 artists from 42 states and 50 countries and regions are enrolled in Juilliard’s College Division, where they appear in more than 700 annual performances in the school’s five theaters; at Lincoln Center’s Alice Tully and David Geffen halls and at Carnegie Hall; as well as at other venues around New York City, the U.S., and the world. The continuum of learning at Juilliard also includes nearly 400 students from elementary through high school enrolled in the Preparatory Division—Pre-College and Music Advancement Program (MAP). MAP serves students from diverse backgrounds often underrepresented in the classical music field. More than 1,200 students are enrolled in Juilliard Extension, the flagship continuing education program taught both in person and remotely by a dedicated faculty of performers, creators, and scholars. Beyond its New York campus, Juilliard is defining new directions in performing arts education for a range of learners and enthusiasts through a global K-12 educational curricula and preparatory and graduate studies at The Tianjin Juilliard School in China.\n\njuilliard.edu\n\n@juilliardschool\n\nCONTACTS:\n\nAllegra Thoresen\n\n[email protected]\n\n[email protected]\n\nImage: Juilliard Celebration 2024.\n\nPhoto by: Rachel Papo, courtesy of Juilliard\n\nJUILLIARD PERFORMANCE AND LIVESTREAM CALENDAR\n\nSeptember 2024–May 2025\n\nPlease refer to the Performance Calendar at juilliard.edu/calendar for the most up-to-date livestream schedule and ticketing information for in-person performances.\n\nJUILLIARD FALL FESTIVAL\n\nThu September 12 | 7:30pm\n\nOpening Night\n\nJuilliard’s opening 2024-25 performance features artists from the music, dance, drama, and preparatory divisions.\n\nPeter Jay Sharp Theater | Also livestreamed\n\nFri September 13 | 7:30pm\n\nTouching Magic: A Juilliard Vocal Arts-Sibelius Academy Collaboration\n\nPaul Hall | Also livestreamed\n\nSat September 14 (rain date Sun Sept 15) | Noon\n\nJuilliard Outdoors\n\nLincoln Center\n\nSat September 14 | 7:30pm\n\nThe New: Celebrating Charles Ives and American Experimentalism in Music, Dance, and Drama\n\nPeter Jay Sharp Theater\n\nSun September 15 | 2pm\n\nAn Afternoon of Groundbreaking Piano and Chamber Music\n\nPaul Hall\n\nMon September 16 | 7:30pm\n\nJuilliard Orchestra Conducted by David Robertson\n\nKatie JENKINS Awakening (World premiere, commissioned by Juilliard)\n\nSCHOENBERG Piano Concerto\n\nBEETHOVEN Symphony No. 5\n\nAlice Tully Hall | Also livestreamed\n\nTue September 17 | 7:30pm\n\nJuilliard415: Baroque Indulgence\n\nRachel Podger, Director\n\nTELEMANN Ouverture-Suite in E Minor, TWV 55:e1\n\nJ.S.
