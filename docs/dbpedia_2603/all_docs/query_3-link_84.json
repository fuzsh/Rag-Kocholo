        "text": "The breadth of talent at Marylebone Road is celebrated this summer, with performances of operatic works, musical theatre productions, jazz, historical performance and new music - plus much more. Audiences can look forward to an assortment of musical experiences, from Sinatra and Sondheim to Strauss and Shostakovich.\n\nThe annual cycle of festivals at the Academy continues with ‘Music and the Persistence of Memory’ (23-25 April), a three-day festival which explores the rich world of music and memory with new music by Academy composers, also including video and art installations. Celebrating the creativity and boldness of Academy’s pianists, the annual Summer Piano Festival returns for its 10th anniversary (12-14 June) and includes film improvisation, rarely performed pieces by The Forgotten Melodies Society and a day devoted to György Kurtág. Completing festival season is the return of the Seen and Heard festival (25 and 27 June). Now in its fourth year, this festival celebrates diversity in classical music. Students from across the Academy unite to perform work by underrepresented composers. All festivals in the summer season are free to attend.\n\nAcademy musicians continue to work with leading artists and in prestigious venues. Roderick Cox conducts the Academy Symphony Orchestra (ASO) for the first time (21 June). After leading the ASO in a performance of Shostakovich’s Symphony no 10 in Duke’s Hall, he will then lead the orchestra in a performance of this piece with the UK premiere of Unsuk Chin’s Alaraph ‘Ritus des Herzschlags’ ('Ritual of the heartbeat') at Aldeburgh Festival (22 June). Also appearing at Snape Maltings this summer is the Academy’s Knussen Chamber Orchestra, which will present a world premiere by Ryan Wigglesworth who conducts the performance, as well as pieces by Judith Weir and Mozart (11 June).\n\nThe Academy’s Piano Series at Wigmore Hall continues with Xiaowen Shang, who presents a tapestry of Spanish music from the 16th, 18th and 20th centuries (17 April). Xiaowen’s debut recording of this repertoire, Music of Silence, will be released on Linn Records in April, as part of the Academy’s Bicentenary Series. Xiaowen is followed by Harry Rylance who performs a programme featuring Strauss and Wagner with soprano Liv Redpath (15 May), and for this season’s series finale, Julian Chan provides the rare opportunity to hear Leopold Godowsky’s daring and virtuosic Java Suite (12 June). Staying at Wigmore Hall, the Academy Soloists Ensemble perform there with international violinist Anthony Marwood, who will direct them in Strauss’s Metamorphosen with Schubert’s Octet in F (20 June).\n\nThroughout the season, the next generation of music makers perform alongside leading musicians in the profession. This summer, audiences can hear Academy students play Frank Sinatra’s hit songs alongside Mike Lovatt, Derek Watkins Professor of Trumpet (26 April). Audiences will be able to hear famous tunes including You Make Me Feel So Young and The Best Is Yet To Come.\n\nFrom the King of Swing to the Sun King, the Academy Baroque Soloists are joined by the Academy of Ancient Music to pay homage to Louis XIV of France (1 May). Those interested in historical performances will welcome the return of the Academy’s Sunday concert series, Resounding Shores, a celebration of the music of Purcell and his contemporaries, which continues on 30 June featuring music by Purcell, Dowland, Blow and more.\n\nFollowing a recent series of critically acclaimed productions, Royal Academy Opera will perform a double bill of Bohuslav Martinů’s Comedy on the Bridge and Twice Alexander (8 and 10 May). These two comic operas will be directed by Rachael Hewer and conducted by Lada Valesova. The stage will also be set for the Academy’s Musical Theatre students when they perform Spring Awakening (6-9 June) by Duncan Sheik and Steven Sater and Stephen Sondheim and James Lapine’s Into the Woods (27-30 June).\n\nRounding off a packed programme of performances, Academy jazz musicians can be heard performing Kenny Wheeler’s Lost Scores at the Vortex Club, marking 10 years since Wheeler’s death (24 June). Students from the Academy perform alongside vocalist Norma Winstone, who was part of the original Kenny Wheeler big band sessions. After this performance, the ensemble will follow in the footsteps of musical legends to record this music at Abbey Road Studios.\n\nOnline booking opens at 10am on Friday 5 April, where all events will be available to book on our what's on page.\n\nTelephone bookings: from 10am to 4pm on Monday 15 April; 10am to 12 noon thereafter (weekdays only)"
