        "text": "Day 206\n\n25 July 2017: Casella – Symphony No. 2 (1909)\n\nToday happens to be the 134th anniversary of Alfredo Casella’s birth, so it is apposite that I should give his second symphony an airing. Actually, it's questionable whether Casella considered this his second symphony. He wrote it in the same year as he conducted the premiere of his first, and as you might recall when I featured that a few months ago (see Day 102), Casella pretty much disavowed it immediately, to the extent that he used a re-scored version of the slow movement in this piece. The implication seems quite clear that he did not intend the earlier work to be heard again.\n\nWhile the first symphony is by no means a bad composition, it is clearly substantially inferior to this. The dark tone is set right from the off with a funereal theme set against a tolling bell, and while the scherzo provides relative light relief, the overall mood of the work for the most part is sombre. The beautiful slow movement that Casella thought so much of that he played it again, Sam, is of course just as beautiful second time around, but benefits from this more opulent scoring. Oddly, the march-like finale is not actually the final movement, being superseded by six-minute Epilogo. It is this that elevates Symphony No. 2 to greatness. Starting quietly, its soaring string line builds through a long crescendo to a magnificent climax featuring full orchestra, organ and bells. As for its undoubted neglect, well, as mentioned when discussing his first symphony, Casella was persona non grata for a while in his homeland for his support of Mussolini during the last war. Even so, it beggars belief that this symphony was first recorded just eight years ago, exactly 100 years after it was written. Casella's rehabilitation is under way, but has quite a way to go still.\n\nDay 207\n\n26 July 2017: Tchaikovsky – Symphony No. 4 (1878)\n\nPyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's six numbered symphonies can, more or less, be split down the middle. The first three are comparatively lightweight, and less-frequently performed, while numbers four to six are giants of the symphonic repertoire and can be heard regularly in concert halls all over the world. While unquestionably great works, there was a time when I rather tired of them. In my student days, my now wife and I were regulars at the subscription concert series at Victoria Hall, Hanley, and it felt like every second programme featured Tchaikovsky 4 or 5. Listening today felt like reacquainting myself with an old friend, albeit one I'd been giving a wide berth to for the last twenty years.\n\nThe symphony is bookended by the famous 'Fate' fanfare, and as symphonic openings go, it really is right out of the top drawer. Parallels are often drawn with the similarly arresting opening of Beethoven's fifth, and this was something the composer was complicit in having written of his incorporation of the Beethoven in this symphony's programme. The delicate Andantino features one of Tchaikovsky's most plaintive melodies, while the extraordinary third movement Scherzo features the strings playing pizzicato throughout, no doubt chafing the finger skins of many a fiddle player down the years. The finale rattles along at a furious pace until just past its halfway point when, in a genuine masterstroke, the opening 'Fate' fanfare crashes back in. From the barren aftermath it leaves, the music recovers its impetus with the return of the movement's first theme and ploughs headlong towards its crowd-pleasing conclusion. Vintage Tchaikovsky.\n\nDay 208\n\n27 July 2017: Sullivan – Symphony in E, 'Irish' (1866)\n\nConfession time: I cannot stand Gilbert & Sullivan. I don't use those words lightly, because to tell the truth there's not much music I do genuinely dislike. Maybe the really whiniest forms of Country music, and pretty much all hip hop, but apart from that I've got a high tolerance level. G&S though ... urgh. Don't ask me to explain why, it's clearly just a personal thing given how enduringly popular they are with amateur operatic societies to this day. To use what I promise will be the only Morrissey quote I'll deploy this year, it says nothing to me about my life.\n\nThankfully, this bears no relation to any of his ghastly operettas. That may be because there was no input from his partner-in-crime, WS Gilbert, whom he had yet to meet, but in reality this was written before he had developed a style of his own. Sullivan was only 21 when he started work on this, and being a youthful work, the influences (Beethoven, Mendelssohn, Schumann) are still pretty easily detected. As for the 'Irish' nickname, it indicates nothing more than that the first movement was conceived while Sullivan was holidaying in Ireland. Whatever its merits and demerits, the fact is that this is symphony written by an Englishman in the 1860s, and there aren't many of those around. It pre-dates Stanford's first symphony by ten years and Parry's by sixteen. And while it's never likely to be much more than a curiosity in the grand scheme of English music history, there is plenty to like about this work ... not least that there isn't a patter song in sight.\n\nDay 209\n\n28 July 2017: Khachaturian – Symphony No. 2, \"The Bell\" (1944)\n\nAt around about the time that Shostakovich was writing his own devastating depiction of war-torn Russia, the Symphony No. 8 (see Day 158), Aram Khachaturian composed this 'requiem of wrath' in response to the same events. Like Shostakovich, however, they were not events he was experiencing first-hand as they spent most of the war safely hidden away in a composers' retreat 150 miles east of Moscow. Nevertheless, the incalculable losses suffered by the Soviet Union during World War II were deeply felt across the whole country and inevitably permeated the music of the time.\n\nAs a rule, Khachaturian doesn't really do subtlety and this work batters its point home in no uncertain terms. At around 50 minutes in length, it can be quite an arduous listen, but given the time and place it was written, it was hardly going to be a musical tea party. The symphony takes its title from the bell motif that opens the work in almost murderous fashion, and straight from the off it's clear this is going to be a bumpy ride. It's not all blood and guts though, as there are many moments of often sparsely scored music of a desolate nature. The third movement is the core of the piece – an austere funeral march based on an Armenian folk tune Vorskan akhper, and one in which Khachaturian expressly set out to portray the 'superhuman suffering' of his compatriots. Harsh brass prefaces the final movement, which picks up the aural assault where it had left off. There is a brief moment of calm towards the end but it soon builds again to a terrifying denouement. If nothing else, this work can be held up to prove that there is a lot more to Khachaturian than his popular ballet scores.\n\nDay 210\n\n29 July 2017: Sammartini – Sinfonia in A major, J-C 63 (c. 1760)\n\nWhile Haydn is often referred to as 'The Father of the Symphony', it is probably fairer to say that he popularised a form that was developed elsewhere. Of the many composers who might lay claim to creating the genre, Giovanni Battista Sammartini is indisputably one of the founding fathers of the symphony as we know it. Sammartini wrote about 80 Sinfonias, and the \"J-C\" cataloguing system bears no relation to the order in which they were composed. Consequently, the c.1760 date I've given this particular one is very 'circa' as it could have been written any time between 1759 and 1775. This is one of his later symphonies, with some of the earlier ones dating back to the 1730s, the decade in which Haydn was born.\n\nI could have chosen any one of those 80-or-so symphonies, but this is a perfectly representative choice. It differs from the later style typical of Haydn, Mozart et al in that it has three movements. They follow the fast-slow-fast pattern typical of the Italian opera overture, from which the Sinfonia spawned. The influence Sammartini had on the Classical period composers is clearly discernible here, with its ostensibly rhythmic themes based around the notes of the triad. The light elegance one associates with Haydn's slow movements again has its roots in this music, although the triple time final movement is closer in style to the third movement minuets of the Classical period. This does lead to a slight feeling of incompleteness, as if there should be a presto finale to finish. That said, this is delightful music of great historical importance.\n\nDay 211\n\n30 July 2017: Magnard – Symphony No. 2 (1896)\n\nAlbéric Magnard, is a composer probably more famous – if he is known at all – for the heroic nature of his death than for his music. His demise at the age of 49, single-handedly defending his property from invading German forces in the early years of World War I, turned him into a national hero. Sadly, it hasn't secured his musical legacy as he is little-known in his native France, and largely unheard of in this country. I feel duty bound to do my bit to help promote him.\n\nThis symphony was originally composed in 1892, After it was first performed in full four years later, however, the original second movement (entitled Fugues) was dispensed with and replaced with the Danses movement that now occupies that slot. This resulted, by all accounts, in the overall work becoming ten minutes shorter when it was presented in its new configuration in 1899. Although nominally in E major, the symphony's unsettling opening doesn't really establish any key with any degree of certainty for quite some time. There is a feeling throughout of a free spirit at work, seemingly going where his fancy takes him. This really comes to the fore in the sublime third movement; a theme and variations marked Très nuancé, which, at times, is close to what I imagine we might have got had Ravel ever written a symphony. There are also echoes of Strauss, and the conclusion of the symphony features a grand theme that might have been lifted from Elgar. All of these similarities would have been entirely accidental though, as Magnard is a composer of great originality. I'm a big fan of his work and wish he could be gifted with some form of revival.\n\nDay 212\n\n31 July 2017: Panufnik – Metasinfonia (1978)\n\nAndrzej Panufnik went through a period of refining his musical language in the mid-Seventies, and the practical offshoot of this was a cluster of four symphonies produced in almost as many years. Metasinfonia is the fourth of those and his seventh overall. It was written for the unusual combination of organ, timpani and strings, and in it Panufnik made a conscious effort to redress the balance between ‘feeling and intellect’, that had, to be honest, made its two predecessors rather cold, academic exercises. Having written at great length about the schematic approach he took to Nos. 5 and 6, even to the extent of providing diagrams in the score, Panufnik’s programme notes for Metasinfonia were far more concise, accepting that the technicalities of his compositional methods might be of little interest to the listener.\n\nMetasinfonia feels more like an organ concerto than a symphony, something the composer himself acknowledged. The changing dynamic between orchestra and soloist does, however, provide this work with an extra dimension that informed all the subsequent works Panufnik was to write. It feels like a less rigid composition generally, and the simple fact is that this particular combination of instruments sounds fantastic to my ears. With Metasinfonia, Panufnik felt he had found his feet again as a composer, and while it is by no means his most well-known work – almost certainly the least-performed – I think it is a very strong piece that deserves greater familiarity.\n\nDay 200\n\n19 July 2017: Vaughan Williams – Symphony No. 5 (1943)\n\nAh, Ralph Vaughan Williams. How do I love thy fifth symphony? Let me count the ways. It gives me great pleasure to bring up the double-century in my Symphony A Day journey with one of my all-time favourites. I'm not going to make a case for this being the greatest symphony from a technical point of view, nor will I argue for its inclusion alongside the Eroica or Symphonie Fantastique for being the most influential. No, this one is personal, it just touches me in a way that very few other works of art ever have. If I had name the symphony I'm featuring this year that I've listened to the most in my life, this would probably come out on top.\n\nI've often pondered why this strikes such a chord with me. The best I can come up with its use of modes throughout giving rise to music that is tonal-but-not-tonal; sufficiently piquant to steer it away from the blandness it could easily have sunk into. Right from the off that tonal ambiguity is heard, with an essentially D major theme playing over a pedal C bass. There's a yearning feel about the music that probably seemed nostalgic even when it was written, and the fact that it was first performed during World War II must have left its audience longing for the peace it beautifully depicts. The symphony actually makes use of a wealth of material Vaughan Williams had written for his at-the-time unfinished opera The Pilgrim's Progress. I only heard the finished opera very recently and was quite surprised at just how much of it is practically unchanged in the symphony. That is especially true of the Romanza third movement, with the opening cor anglias theme coming straight from the start of Act I Scene 2. The searing intensity of this movement rarely fails to bring a tear to the eye of this wizened old cynic. A wonderful Passacaglia fourth movement culminates in a triumphant return of the symphony's opening theme, which in turn subsides into some gorgeous string writing that soars up to the heavens. It's a hugely spiritual work, and it will always occupy a special place in my heart.\n\nDay 201\n\n20 July 2017: Beethoven – Symphony No. 6, 'Pastoral' (1808)\n\nSo, how on earth does one follow a giant of the symphonic repertoire like the mighty Fifth. Well, by writing an even better one of course. Technically, he didn't actually follow the Fifth with this as both were premiered (along with his Piano Concerto No. 4, and Choral Fantasy for piano, chorus and orchestra) in the same extraordinary four-hour concert on 22 December 1808. By virtue of being performed first in that concert, this was actually the fifth symphony in order of premiere, if not in order of composition. Anyway, this hugely popular work is many people's favourite symphony, and it's hard to think of another with so many glorious tunes packed into its 40-minute length. While that in itself would undoubtedly secure its place in the hearts of any music-lover, there is the unescapable fact that a whole generation grew to love this piece through its use in the Walt Disney film Fantasia.\n\nAnd what's not love about it? The addition of a helpful descriptive title for each movement allows the audience to clearly see what picture Beethoven was painting with his music, which all adds to the listening experience. The first movement, 'Awakening of cheerful feelings on arrival in the countryside', contains some of the composer's most instantly recognisable music. There's a treat for ornithologists in the 'Scene by the brook' second movement, with bird songs featured towards the end identified by Beethoven in the score as the nightingale, quail, and cuckoo. The final three movements are, unusually for the time, sequenced together with the terrifying storm of the fourth movement subsiding into the 'Shepherd's song' of the finale, which is right up there among the greatest tunes ever written. Quite simply, it's brilliant from start to finish, but I suspect I'm preaching to the converted here.\n\nDay 202\n\n21 July 2017: Bax – Symphony No. 4 (1930)\n\nFun fact: this is the fourth day in a row that I've featured a symphony that lives permanently on my phone in iTunes, which indicates that I'm on something of a run of personal favourites at the moment. Arnold Bax's fourth symphony was, like much of his music, inspired by nature, and in this particular case, the seascapes of the Western Highlands. Even by his standards, this is a richly scored work, with xylophone, glockenspiel, celesta, harp, and organ all employed in addition to a larger than standard orchestra.\n\nIt has been said that this piece lacks a bit of cohesion, particularly in comparison to its predecessor, the wonderful third symphony. For me, it feels more connected to his brilliant tone poems such as November Woods and Tintagel than any of his other symphonies. You can practically smell the sea air in the wild and blustery first movement. The effect of a large orchestra playing mostly quiet and calm music is something I always enjoy hearing, and it is used to great effect in the Lento moderato slow movement, as if depicting great forces at rest, that could be stirred up by a change of wind direction at any moment. The triumphal ending is unusual for Bax, and again adds to the feeling that this is a largely joyful work, celebrating an environment he clearly loved.\n\nDay 203\n\n22 July 2017: Still – Symphony No. 1, 'Afro-American' (1930)\n\nCoincidentally written in the same year as Bax's Symphony No. 4, William Grant Still's Afro-American Symphony is a very different proposition. Still is another of those composers who, if asked about a few days before listening to one of their works as part of this series, I would have drawn a blank. He is, however, one of my most enjoyable discoveries of the year, and judging by the response to my Twitter post, a highly popular choice. This work led to Still being the first African American to have a symphony performed by a major orchestra, and was, according the academic Dr. Edith Borroff, the most performed symphony by an American prior to 1950. It was performed by 38 different orchestras on both sides of the Atlantic in its first 20 years.\n\nIt's not hard to see why it was so hugely popular. It's a lovely, bluesy, Gershwinesque work that tapped into the appetite at the time for jazz and African-American music. The four movements are each prefaced in the score by words from the black poet Paul Laurence Dunbar, and were also given titles: Longing, Sorrow, Humor, and Aspiration. I think I can safely say that this is the first symphony I've featured this year that calls for a tenor banjo! This features prominently in the lively third movement, which has always been a concert favourite. The first movement has echoes of Gershwin's Rhapsody in Blue, and is a straight twelve-bar blues for the most part, featuring some beautiful blues-inflected melodies. The whole work is an absolute delight, and I'll be exploring some more of his work in future.\n\nDay 204\n\n23 July 2017: Penderecki – Symphony No. 7, 'Seven Gates of Jerusalem' (1996)\n\nThere have been some pretty imposing works featured in my occasional Choral Symphony Sunday slot, but there can be few as mighty as this one. Krzysztof Penderecki hadn't originally conceived this work as a symphony, rather believing it to be an oratorio. And certainly its seven movements don't conform in any way to standard symphonic structure. Nevertheless, after a couple of performances under the title Seven Gates of Jerusalem, Penderecki subsequently affixed the name Symphony No. 7. That in itself was something of an oddity as his Symphony No. 6 was incomplete at the time, and in fact it remains incomplete to this day!\n\nThe work was commissioned to commemorate the third millennium of the city of Jerusalem, and it certainly made quite an impression. As mentioned when I featured his third symphony (see Day 41), Penderecki left his early avant-garde style behind in favour of a more conventional and direct language from about the mid-1970s onwards. There are occasional echoes of those earlier extended techniques to be heard at some points in this work, and the effect when they appear is quite stunning. The sheer raw power on display at times, especially in the orchestra-and-chorus tuttis that occur at key moments in the piece, takes one's breath away. The core of the symphony is the 15-minute-long fifth movement Lauda, Jerusalem, Dominum, where percussion-driven staccato music crescendos before making way for a central, plaintive, hymn-like passage for choir and soloists. Then from a sparsely scored orchestral section, the music builds once again to a massive climax. That is followed by an emotionally-charged Hajetà alai jad adonài, which features a speaker reciting in Hebrew. If there's a criticism, it is that over the work's seven movements, it is virtually all shade and precious little light. That said, this a very profound work that wasn't meant to have them dancing in the aisles. I had to listen to the full hour of this twice to fully get a handle on it, and it certainly rewarded a repeat hearing. I recommend this very highly.\n\nDay 205\n\n24 July 2017: Scriabin – Symphony No. 3, 'The Divine Poem' (1904)\n\nAlexander Scriabin's career followed the reverse trajectory to yesterday's composer, Penderecki. Scriabin started his career writing luscious, late-romantic scores, such as this one, before developing a harsher and more atonal style later. This is a powerful and richly textured musical poem, in which Scriabin set himself the not inconsiderable target of depicting 'the evolution of the human soul and its ultimate union with the cosmos'. There is a programme of sorts – the lyrical, Straussian first movement is entitled Struggles and portrays humanity wrestling with the concept of God. The sensual second movement (Delights) involves humanity evolving a more Pantheistic view, while the final Divine Play comes from the resulting freedom from subordination to a supreme being.\n\nQuite how much of this Scriabin manages to pull off in strictly musical terms is debatable. The massive 25-minute first movement dominates the work, and while it may not be held together by any kind of recognisable form, it maintains interest throughout by virtue of its splendid, overarching melodies. The music of the second movement is absolutely ravishing and, to be honest, I cared not in the slightest what the composer was trying to put across beyond the splendour of his own gift for harmony. I've never quite understood why Scriabin is performed far less frequently than some of his contemporaries, most of whom he was at the very least an equal to. I could quite easily see this spectacularly crowning off a Prom concert, just as it did in 2010 ... for the only time in the last 96 years.\n\nDay 193\n\n12 July 2017: Mathias – Symphony No. 1 (1965)\n\nAlong with James MacMillan (see Day 75), William Mathias is the only other composer I'm featuring this year who I've actually met. Back in the mid-80s, when I was planning to do my music degree, I went for an interview at Bangor University. Mathias was Professor of Composition at Bangor the time, as he was up until four years before his untimely death in 1992, and he did a very good job of trying to persuade me to go there. In the end, I opted for Keele, but he certainly made a very big impression and I developed something of an interest in his work as a result.\n\nHis first symphony is a fairly early work, written when he was just 30, and his influences are fairly clearly discernible in it. There are strong echoes of early Tippett in the piece, and also of his composition teacher at the Royal Academy of Music, Lennox Berkeley. What there also is though, is an innate sense of compositional balance, and, in the cleverly paced slow movement, no shortage of damn-good-tune writing. It's fair to say that Mathias will probably never be held in the same regard as some of his more illustrious contemporaries, such as Birtwistle or Maxwell Davies. Hopefully, he won't slide into total obscurity either.\n\nDay 194\n\n13 July 2017: Webern – Symphony, Op 21 (1928)\n\nAnton Webern didn't write a whole lot of music. There are only 31 opus numbers, many of which – like this symphony – are effectively miniatures. As a consequence, Pierre Boulez's recordings of Webern's entire body of work fit on just 6 CDs. The impact that this music had, however is immense. Together with his contemporaries Arnold Schoenberg and his colleague Alban Berg they were the engine room of the Second Viennese School, and pretty much changed the face of music in the 20th century. Of the three, Webern was probably the most hardcore in his approach to twelve-tone theory, ultimately using the ideas to organise not just pitch but rhythm and dynamics too.\n\nNothing highlights the problem I sometimes have with serialism more than the fact that many of the learned pieces that have been written analysing this symphony take considerably longer to read than the work itself takes to listen to. It does feel at times that it's about 90% academic exercise and 10% inspiration. I am quite prepared to accept, however, that this is a miniature masterpiece. Every single note has a purpose, and there is nothing in it that cannot be justified. It is music pared down to the barest essentials. Furthermore, it opened doors for composers that followed, and while the stark theory of serialism soon found its limitations, Webern and his ilk created a tool with which composers could build the music of the avant garde.\n\nDay 195\n\n14 July 2017: Elsa Barraine – Symphony No. 2 (1938)\n\nI doubt if there are many out there who are familiar with the work of Elsa Barraine. I know I wasn't, but one of the many goals I set myself this year was to not only discover unfamiliar repertoire generally, but to make a conscious effort to explore the music of some of the more neglected female composers. Sadly, there are many, and as is to prove the point about how much digging has to be done to hear them, the reason I've chosen Symphony No. 2 is because, to the best of my knowledge, there is no recording of No. 1.\n\nBarraine won the Prix de Rome in 1929, and while that was by no means a gateway to instant fame (the two previous winners are decidedly obscure names ... Edmond Gaujac and Raymond Loucheur, anyone?) she did enjoy a great degree of success in her native France prior to World War II. The war rather curtailed her composing; in fact, she pretty much abandoned music and became heavily involved with the French Resistance. She worked mostly in education after the war, but carried on composing well into her twilight years. Very little of her music is heard today, which is a shame because if this is anything to go by there's a lot to like about it. Musically, it's not obvious to spot any links to any of her contemporaries, and although the influence of the previous generation of composers such as Les Six may be in the mix somewhere, Barraine clearly forged a path of her own. The highlight for me was the taut string writing in the central Marche Funèbre movement. I'd like to hear more of her music, but it could take some finding.\n\nDay 196\n\n15 July 2017: Rubbra – Symphony No. 6 (1954)\n\nI don't think I can get through any kind of write-up of an Edmund Rubbra symphony without using the word 'neglected', so I'm going to get it in early. This is an absolutely fabulous symphony, and the fact that is utterly neglected and has been since the mid-1950s is nothing short of criminal. I've got no facts to back this up, but I'd be reasonably sure that, as a result of separate releases in the 1990s conducted by Norman Del Mar and Richard Hickox, this has been recorded more times in the last 60 years than it has been publicly performed.\n\nI suppose that, just as the arrival of punk in the mid-70s rendered a lot of its rock music predecessors moribund, so the coming of the avant garde and the Darmstadt School in the mid-50s did for composers like Rubbra. Certainly the BBC played their part at the time by turning away from music they felt was embarrassingly traditional. Anyway, surely enough water has passed under the bridge by now for Rubbra to be listened to with fresh ears. I'd recommend any new listeners to start here because the glorious lyricism on display here is almost beyond compare in post-war British music. And as for the beautiful Canto: Largo e sereno second movement, that really is peak Rubbra in my view. The great thing about his music is that each new hearing seems to reveal something you missed last time. I can never tire of it.\n\nDay 197\n\n16 July 2017: Elgar – Symphony No. 2 (1911)\n\nI had, more or less, assembled my listening schedule for this Symphony A Day project by the middle of January. So when the 2017 BBC Proms programme was announced in April, I thought it might be a nice idea to shuffle it around a bit so that I could marry up my symphony-listening task with a performance of said symphony at that day's Prom. The first such opportunity arose today in Prom 4, which saw Daniel Barenboim and the Staatskapelle Berlin perform Edward Elgar’s Second Symphony. It turned out to be an inspired decision, as I can honestly say that I've never heard this particular work performed better.\n\nIt is probably Elgar's most misunderstood work. It was dedicated to the memory of King Edward VII, who died the previous year, and had been intended as a loyal tribute to the King, who was still alive when Elgar began composing it. Any thought that this might be some form of patriotic tub-thumping, however, is dispelled within about two minutes of what is clearly a deeply personal score. The first movement starts nobly enough with a theme known as \"Spirit of Delight\", but it soon takes a more sombre turn, and by the time the heart-wrenching Larghetto second movement takes hold, there's not a dry eye in the house. Quite what inspired such overt soul-baring has been the subject of much speculation. Not many buy the tribute to the sovereign line, and other recently departed acquaintances such as Alfred E. Rodewald have been put forward. Likeliest is his alleged romantic liaison with Alice Stuart Wortley over the previous couple of years. It's not essential to know, in any event, the 'why' of this symphony. The combination of this score in the hands of this conductor demonstrates amply the emotional power of music.\n\nDay 198\n\n17 July 2017: Shostakovich – Symphony No. 10 (1953)\n\nAs coincidence would have it, the opportunity for another Proms tie-in arose with tonight's BBC National Orchestra of Wales performance of Dmitri Shostakovich's tenth symphony. After his ninth had been condemned by critics and authorities alike, essentially for being too glib, it would be eight years before Shostakovich would write No. 10. It's an undeniable fact of chronology that this symphony was first performed just a few months after the death of Stalin, leading many to conclude that the two events were intrinsically connected. As it is though, the exact date of composition is unclear, with the suggestion that it was written a year or two earlier.\n\nThere is one very clear pointer as to the nature of this work though, and that is the prominent place given to his own musical monogram – the letters DSCH, which in German notation equate to the notes D, E flat, C and B. Shostakovich used this in many other works, usually those of a deeply personal nature such as the Violin and Cello Concertos, and his String Quartet No. 8. Thus the symphony is at least in some part autobiographical. It begins with another of Shostakovich's massive first movements, accounting for almost half the symphony's entire length and drawing clear parallels to the similarly scaled equivalent movements in Symphonies 5 and 8. If the Stalinist connection is to be believed, then this might be interpreted as a depiction of his nightmarish regime, and the fact that the DSCH theme emerges triumphantly at the end of the finale might tell us all we need to know about the composer's intention. Nothing is ever as simple as that with old Dmitri, though, and the fact that another monogram has been identified in the score – E-La-Mi-Re-A, associated with a female pupil of his by the name of Elmira Nazirova – leads me to think it's time to stop digging and start listening!\n\nDay 199\n\n18 July 2017: Sibelius – Symphony No. 4 (1911)\n\nThe big-hitters are coming thick and fast at the moment, and after a couple of emotionally saturated works from Elgar and Shostakovich, here we have probably the bleakest symphony of Jean Sibelius's output. Completed in 1911, coincidentally the same year as the Elgar, this is a very dark symphony from a dark period in the composer's life. Two years before beginning this work, Sibelius had undergone surgery to remove a cancerous tumour from his throat, and it was said that for some time afterwards he feared the disease's return. Again, some composer-as-visionary fruitcakes have said that there are portents of World War I in the music, as if the composer's cancer wasn't reason enough for the music to be as gloomy as it is.\n\nIt's hard to think of a darker opening to any symphony than the deep growl of the cellos, double basses and bassoons. The mood scarcely lifts at any point, although the second movement does have something approaching a jaunty tune at times, with occasional brightness from a glockenspiel. It's a brief respite though, and the music eventually descends into something approaching despair. The ending is particularly bereft of hope with stark A minor chords marked mezzo-forte; probably the only symphony in the conventional repertoire to end in the mid-dynamic range, which has left many an audience wondering whether the work has actually finished. I first heard this in the early-90s I think and just didn't 'get it' at all. It's now one of my favourites, although it can be a tough journey sometimes.\n\nDay 190\n\n9 July 2017: Szymanowski – Symphony No. 3, \"The Song of the Night\" (1916)\n\nThe thing I find about Karol Szymanowski is that when he's good, he's very, very good. I was proofreading a book about him a while ago, and decided to listen to his music almost exclusively while I was doing it. Some if it left me a bit cold, to be truthful, but a lot of it really hit the spot, and chief among those works was this gloriously opulent symphony. And as it features a choir, then that means it's Choral Symphony Sunday again!\n\nThe text is a 13th Century Persian poem that a friend of his had recently translated into Polish, in which the poet implores a friend not to sleep but to contemplate the beauty and stillness of the night. It's a suitably nocturnal, and for the most part slow-moving score, with a ravishing harmonic language influenced by Scriabin, Debussy and Tristan-era Wagner. I think if I was given the task of picking one work I'd like to hear performed live then this would be quite near the top of the list, as even on record it comes over as riot of orchestral colour with some epic choral writing. Sadly, its demands on singers and performers, and the small matter of it being in Polish, means it's a rarely heard work in this country. I'll have weigh up whether it's worth a trip to Poland to hear it.\n\nDay 191\n\n10 July 2017: Borodin – Symphony No. 2 (1876)\n\nI seem to recall gorging on Alexander Borodin when I was student. He was BBC Radio 3's Composer of the Week at some point during my first year and I played the tape recordings I made to death. I still have a soft spot for him to this day, and this symphony is a particular favourite. It was a work that actually took Borodin best part of seven years to complete, as he kept breaking off to work on other projects – notably his opera Prince Igor, and ballet Mlada – as well as his other career as a notable chemist.\n\nThe wait was worth it, however, as it has become one of Borodin's best-known works and certainly his greatest symphony. Its mighty opening theme appears on his grave in St Petersburg, and was also used (along with many of his other popular tunes) in the Tony Award-winning musical Kismet. The first movement does tend to dominate the work a little, but a lively little Scherzo in the very unusual time signature of 1/1, and a wonderful Andante, in which a serene opening melody passes between the horn and clarinet, are hardly let-downs. In fact, the delicate coda at the end of the Andante is just about my favourite part of the whole work. The sense of foreboding of the first movement is completely dispelled by a lively Slavic-dance finale that could have come straight from his Polovtsian Dances, written around the same time. A truly great symphony, in my humble opinion.\n\nDay 192\n\n11 July 2017: Bizet – Roma Symphony (1871)\n\nGeorges Bizet wrote two symphonies in his sadly short life. The first, his Symphony in C (see Day 58), was written as a 17-year-old student but was published and became popular long after his death. This, the second, was a rather more laboured affair that took him 12 years to write, and is as rarely heard now as it was in his lifetime. The story of its composition is long and involved, but in a nutshell, after winning the Prix de Rome, Bizet lived in Italy for a few years and planned to write a symphony in which each movement depicted a different Italian city. Only the Scherzo was ever written though – ironically, given the work's final title, a movement written about Florence. The remaining three movements were added at various points later, and the symphony was frequently revised before Bizet, to all intents and purposes gave up on it.\n\nSome people regard the work as unfinished, some regard it as a suite rather than a symphony, some question exactly how much it has to do with Rome – the title appears to have been added later to distinguish the symphony from his first, as this is also in C. From what I'd read about it, the only thing people seem to agree on is that it was, at best, uneven. I find this criticism baffling as I rather enjoyed it. The orchestration is marvellous, and the main theme from the Andante molto third movement is absolutely gorgeous. I'll definitely be coming to this work at some point in the future.\n\nDay 183\n\n2 July 2017: Mahler – Symphony No. 6 (1904)\n\nI've always been a little wary of terms like 'visionary' being bandied about when discussing composers. Far too often, events that occurred after a work was written have been retrospectively associated with the piece, with the implication that the composer had somehow anticipated them in their work. All stuff and nonsense, obviously, but there is, to be fair to the tin-foil hat wearers, seemingly something in the assertion when it comes to Gustav's Mahler's sixth symphony. Often titled as his 'Tragic' symphony, although not, as if to accentuate the earlier point, by Mahler himself, this is an almost unrelentingly sombre piece. And yet it was written at a time when Mahler, on the face of it, ought to have been at his happiest. He had married Alma Schindler the year before starting work on it, his second child was born during its composition, and he held the highly prestigious post of director of the Vienna Court Opera.\n\nThe one ray of sunshine in the work is the second subject of the first movement, which Mahler stated represented Alma. And while that soaring melody provides an element of light in an otherwise dark work, there is nothing but utter despair about the final movement. It runs to almost half-an-hour in length and is famous for a number of hammer blows (literally – they are marked in the score as \"hammer\") that shatter any gathering positivity in the music. There were originally three such blows, although Mahler later edited out the third one. The view among conductors seems to be divided over its reinstatement, with some recordings going against Mahler's wishes and putting it back in. There is also, as it happens, some dispute over the ordering of the inner movements. Mahler again having had second thoughts after some early performances, eventually deciding the Andante should come second. The greater enigma though surrounds the meaning of the hammer blows, and this is where things start to get spooky. Within a year of the symphony's completion, Mahler's eldest daughter died, he was forced to resign his post at the Vienna Court Opera, and he was diagnosed with a fatal heart condition from which he would die in 1911. Three hammer blows. Coincidence maybe, but all grist to mill for the Mahler-as-visionary believers. When I was acquiring all of Mahler's symphonies on LP back in my youth, this was the one I bought last for some reason. It is thus the one I know least well, and it doesn't grab as much attention as the fifth or the so-called 'Symphony of a Thousand' (No. 8). It is a punishing journey and unlike his earlier symphonies this tunnel only ends with a brick wall. I can't think of many other pieces that hollow out one's soul in quite the way that this does.\n\nDay 184\n\n3 July 2017: Gloria Coates – Symphony No. 1, 'Music on Open Strings' (1973)\n\nWhen I scheduled Gloria Coates's fourth symphony into my listening scheduled earlier in the year (see Day 67), it was the only work of hers I intended to feature at that stage. However, I loved it so much that I've found room to squeeze in another couple. Coates wrote her first symphony at the age of 35, and four years after she'd moved from her native Wisconsin to Munich. This is arguably her best-known work, and one that helped establish her reputation in Europe.\n\nThe symphony is written for string orchestra and, as the title implies, much of the work is played on open strings, unusually tuned to provide a wider range of notes. It is a similar principle to that employed by Louis Andriessen in his Symphony for open strings, which he composed five years later (see Day 9). The difference here is that Coates punctuates the music with her trademark glissandi and various percussive techniques. The most striking feature of the third and final movement is a scordatura technique, in which the players retune their instruments in performance back to standard tuning. I discovered when reading about Coates recently that she formed a connection with the post-war Polish avant garde school (which regular readers might recall was the subject of my music degree dissertation), and in particular Penderecki and Lutosławski. In fact, this symphony was first performed at the 1978 Warsaw Autumn Festival. That might explain why her music seems to have triggered something within me.\n\nDay 185\n\n4 July 2017: Haydn – Symphony No. 92, 'Oxford' (1789)\n\nSo many of the symphonies I've listened to this year are also known by a name. Some were provided by the composer, but many weren't and in some cases the nickname isn't terribly helpful. In this case, Symphony No. 92 was one of three Josef Haydn wrote when he was living in Vienna, to a commission from the French Count d'Ogny, for performance in Paris. So naturally it ended being called the 'Oxford' symphony! It acquired the name because, two years later, Haydn supposedly conducted it at a ceremony at Oxford University at which he was awarded an honorary doctorate. Again though, no one seems certain that this was the actual symphony he conducted at the ceremony.\n\nIn essence, all the name does is help identify this among the 104 (or more) that he wrote. It's a very fine work, with a slow introduction that is truly exquisite, from which emerges a trademark sonata form first movement where it is easy to detect the features that Beethoven would use in his early symphonies. The Adagio cantabile slow movement features a lovely theme that is at times hesitant, as if it were an aria from an unwritten opera. There are a few musical jokes in the light-hearted scherzo, and a brisk finale rounds off proceedings on a suitable high.\n\nDay 186\n\n5 July 2017: Saint-Saëns – Symphony in F, 'Urbs Roma' (1856)\n\nCamille Saint-Saëns' symphonic output is, shall we say, patchy. There are three numbered symphonies, of which the third – his 'Organ Symphony' – is widely considered to be one of the greatest ever written. There are also two un-numbered symphonies, the first having been written when he was 15 and was scarcely more than a style-composition exercise. This is the other un-numbered symphony, written as an entry for a competition run by the Bordeaux Société Ste Cécile.\n\nIt appears that it won a prize, which surprises me given that Saint-Saëns virtually buried the work in his catalogue. It was unpublished in his lifetime, and it doesn't appear to be a piece the composer was especially proud of. That said, it's his longest symphony, and by no means a bad one. The first movement contains some memorable themes and is wonderfully orchestrated, with some nice, exposed brass sections. A brief and unremarkable scherzo is followed by a not-at-all brief and even less remarkable funereal slow movement. The last movement is very understated and not very finale-like, which means the 40-minute musical journey ends with a rather anti-climactic feel. What all of this has to do with the City of Rome of the title has been lost in time. There's no help from the generic movement titles and no programme was supplied for the work. As with all of his non-organ symphonies, I was unfamiliar with this work, and while I'm glad to have paid it a visit, I doubt I'll be back.\n\nDay 187\n\n6 July 2017: Schubert – Symphony No. 5 (1816)\n\nFranz Schubert had written so much music prior to this work that it's hard to believe that he was still only 19 when he wrote this brilliant Mozart-influenced work. It is known from Schubert's diaries that he had been immersing himself in Mozart's work at the time he was writing this symphony and many have observed similarities with Mozart, particularly his Symphony No. 40 in G minor. The instrumentation, for example, is the same.\n\nI remember hearing this on the radio a couple of years ago. I recognised it instantly but assumed it was, in fact, Mozart. On discovering it was Schubert 5, I racked my brains trying to recall how it had become so embedded in my subconscious and concluded that its main theme is simply one of those once-heard-never-forgotten tunes that composers would sell their first-born to write. The other movements are on a par with the first, making this his most consistent symphony, I'd say. Every one is a gem, with tune after tune just gliding through ether. On listening to this today, I put it straight back on again and gave it a second blast. Wonderful.\n\nDay 188\n\n7 July 2017: Nielsen – Symphony No. 4, 'The Inextinguishable' (1916)\n\nWritten one hundred years after the Schubert, featured yesterday, here is a very different symphony from Carl Nielsen. It's one that I love just as much though. Just as exhilarating, but in a different way. In the composer's words, he is attempting to convey 'the elemental will of life', something he may have felt compelled to do, two years into the most devastating war mankind had ever inflicted upon itself.\n\nThis is one of those symphonies that grabs you by the scruff of the neck from the very first bar. A quick flurry of notes, and then you're carried along by a relentless falling tritone figure towards a glorious, exultant tune based on a descending major scale. And that is just the first few minutes. That glorioso theme returns at the end of the first movement and seems to embody that inextinguishable life-force while all around is chaos. The final movement sees an actual battle emerge in the orchestra as two timpanists – instructed to be facing each other – compete to drown the other out. The combative percussionist, incidentally, is a theme he would revisit with even more dramatic consequences in his next symphony (look out for that in a couple of months’ time). The fourth symphony is around 30 minutes of some of the most intense symphonic writing ever heard at the time, and it remains one of his most popular and frequently performed works today.\n\nDay 189\n\n8 July 2017: Bruckner – Symphony No. 5 (1876)\n\nTo be honest with you, dear reader, I have something of an ambivalent relationship with Anton Bruckner. I don't doubt his greatness, and there are many days when I can happily luxuriate in music that seems almost heavenly in its conception. There are other times, however, when I've seen one of symphonies looming on the horizon in my pre-determined Symphony A Day listening schedule and there is an unmistakable sinking feeling that I'll be wading through 70–80 minutes of late-Romantic treacle.\n\nI probably wouldn't have chosen to listen to this today, but having said all that, this is a perfectly good symphony that does have some distinguishing features that help it stand out from the crowd. Not least is the unusual fact that three of its four movements open quietly with plucked strings, which gives rise to its unofficial nickname, the 'Pizzicato' symphony. Yes, there were moments when I found myself thinking, 'this bit sounds remarkably similar to his \"n\"th symphony', and I was totally thrown when the fourth movement began and I thought my iPod had gone into shuffle mode and played the first movement again. Despite its near identical opening, it does, however, take a completely different turn and develop into the most wonderful fugue, ending in a blaze of glory with a brilliant brass finale. I just wonder why, for me, the prospect of Bruckner is often far less appealing than the actual experience."
