        "text": "____________________________________________________\n\n“In 1953, I made my first visits to the United States. Interestingly enough, given the turn my career eventually took, my North American debut was originally scheduled to take place at the Ravinia Festival . . . with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. But my U.S. visa application was turned down. The American consul in Frankfurt kindly explained that my visa had been denied because I was listed as belonging to the Soviet Friendship Association, a Communist organization. I couldn’t understand how this could be, as I had never belonged to any political group.\n\n“Fortunately, I knew a Dr. Müller, the Minister of Internal Affairs, and he telephoned the police in Munich to authorize them to show me the document. This document turned out to be a list, prepared by this Communist organization, of prominent non-Communists in cultural life who were to have propaganda material sent to them. With that information in hand, I went back to Frankfurt and explained to the American consul that the list they had seized was not a list of members of the Communist party, but merely a mailing list of people in cultural life. . . . Indeed, in the late 1940s, representatives of the U.S. military government in Bavaria had informed me that if I wanted to maintain my position in Munich, I would have to give up my Hungarian citizenship; by then, Hungary had become a Soviet satellite state. I was not sad about renouncing my original nationality, but being stateless for the next few years presented endless bureaucratic complications. In the end, the West German government kindly offered me German citizenship, which I gratefully accepted, and I remained a German national for nearly twenty years.\n\n“Eventually, I got my U.S. visa, but it came so late that I had to cancel my Ravinia engagement. However, my American debut took place . . . when I conducted the San Francisco Opera.”*\n\nPrograms for that week’s concerts were revised. Otto Klemperer, who had conducted the previous week, stayed over for the July 14 and 16 concerts (ironically, according to the advertisement: “one critic, after Solti’s appearance with the Vienna Philharmonic, called him ‘a young Klemperer'”). Pierre Monteux, scheduled for the following week, arrived early to lead the July 18 and 19 performances.\n\n*Text excerpted from Memoirs by Sir Georg Solti.\n\n____________________________________________________\n\nOn October 25, 1973, Sir Georg Solti conducted the world premiere of Bohuslav Martinů’s First Violin Concerto with Josef Suk as soloist.\n\nFrom Arrand Parsons’s program note: “It is a curious fact that a major work by a major 20th century composer has remained unknown and only in manuscript for over 40 years. (The Martinů Violin Concerto composed for Mischa Elman in 1943 and now known to be No. 2 was performed at CSO concerts on November 16-17, 1944, with Elman as soloist and with Désiré Defauw conducting.) The manuscript comes to the Chicago Symphony Orchestra from the Hans Moldenhauer Archives, today one of the great collections of original manuscripts, a portion of which is held by Northwestern University. It was Dr. Moldenhauer who suggested to Josef Suk the idea of presenting the premiere performances in Chicago, to be followed shortly afterwards with performances in Prague. The Northwestern University Library made the score available to Sir Georg Solti, who was happy to program the premiere with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. The Concerto, composed for the Polish-born American violinist Samuel Dushkin probably in 1933, comprises three movements. It is a work of commanding virtuosity yet retaining an expressive lyricism characteristic of the composer, and it also reflects certain Czech qualities found in the works of Martinů in the 1930s when he lived in Paris but felt a nostalgia for his homeland.”\n\nThe program notes are here, and reviews of the premiere are here.\n\n____________________________________________________\n\nJohn Culshaw‘s book Ring Resounding begins with: “In Vienna, on the afternoon of September 24, 1958, Decca began the first commercial recording of Richard Wagner’s Der Ring des Nibelungen; seven years later, on the evening of November 19, 1965, every note and every word of Wagner’s huge masterpiece had been recorded. Nothing comparable in scope, cost, or artistic and technical challenge had been attempted in the history of the gramophone.”\n\nGeorg Solti led the Vienna Philharmonic and an unbelievable cast of singers in sessions at the Sofiensaal. The recordings, released and remastered numerous times, have never been out of print, and according to a recent issue of BBC Music Magazine, the cycle still ranks as the greatest recording of all time.\n\nThe recording of Die Walküre won the 1966 Grammy Award for Best Opera Recording from the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences. And for their unprecedented achievement, Solti and Culshaw received the Recording Academy’s first Grammy Trustees’ Award in 1967 for their “efforts, ingenuity, and artistic contributions” to the art of recording.\n\nThe casts:\n\nDas Rheingold\n\nWotan George London, bass-baritone\n\nDonner Eberhard Wächter, baritone\n\nFroh Waldemar Kmentt, tenor\n\nLoge Set Svanholm, tenor\n\nAlberich Gustav Neidlinger, bass-baritone\n\nMime Paul Kuen, tenor\n\nFasolt Walter Kreppel, bass\n\nFafner Kurt Böhme, bass\n\nFricka Kirsten Flagstad, soprano\n\nFreia Claire Watson, soprano\n\nErda Jean Madeira, mezzo-soprano\n\nWoglinde Oda Balsborg, soprano\n\nWellgunde Hetty Plümacher, mezzo-soprano\n\nFlosshilde Ira Malaniuk, contralto\n\nRecorded September 24 – October 8, 1958\n\nDie Walküre\n\nSiegmund James King, tenor\n\nSieglinde Régine Crespin, soprano\n\nWotan Hans Hotter, bass-baritone\n\nBrünnhilde Birgit Nilsson, soprano\n\nHunding Gottlob Frick, bass\n\nFricka Christa Ludwig, mezzo-soprano\n\nGerhilde Vera Schlosser, soprano\n\nOrtlinde Helga Dernesch, mezzo-soprano\n\nWaltraute Brigitte Fassbaender, mezzo-soprano\n\nSchwertleite Helen Watts, contralto\n\nHelmwige Berit Lindholm, soprano\n\nSiegrune Vera Little, contralto\n\nGrimgerde Marilyn Tyler, soprano\n\nRossweisse Claudia Hellmann, contralto\n\nRecorded October 29 – November 19, 1965\n\nSiegfried\n\nSiegfried Wolfgang Windgassen, tenor\n\nMime Gerhard Stolze, tenor\n\nBrünnhilde Birgit Nilsson, soprano\n\nWanderer (Wotan) Hans Hotter, bass-baritone\n\nAlberich Gustav Neidlinger, bass-baritone\n\nFafner Kurt Böhme, bass\n\nErda Marga Höffgen, contralto\n\nWaldvogel Joan Sutherland, soprano\n\nRecorded May 8 – November 5, 1962\n\nGötterdämmerung\n\nBrünnhilde Birgit Nilsson, soprano\n\nSiegfried Wolfgang Windgassen, tenor\n\nWaltraute Christa Ludwig, mezzo-soprano\n\nGunther Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, baritone\n\nGutrune Claire Watson, soprano\n\nAlberich Gustav Neidlinger, bass-baritone\n\nHagen Gottlob Frick, bass\n\nFirst Norn Helen Watts, contralto\n\nSecond Norn Grace Hoffman, mezzo-soprano\n\nThird Norn Anita Välkki, soprano\n\nWoglinde Lucia Popp, soprano\n\nWellgunde Gwyneth Jones, soprano\n\nFlosshilde Maureen Guy, mezzo-soprano\n\nWiener Staatsopernchor\n\nWilhelm Pitz, chorus master\n\nRecorded May 20 – November 24, 1964\n\nDuring sessions for Götterdämmerung in the fall of 1964, Humphrey Burton filmed a now classic documentary, The Golden Ring, for the BBC. An amazing clip from that program is below.\n\nThe attached YouTube videos are not the property of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra Association. We just thought they were interesting.\n\n____________________________________________________\n\nThe May 2012 issue of Gramophone magazine includes the first installment of their Hall of Fame, and Sir Georg Solti is included on the list.\n\nThe print edition of the magazine includes a tribute written by pianist Jean-Efflam Bavouzet: “The more I grow in my life as [a] musician, the more the example of Sir Georg shines in my private pantheon. With his always-ongoing energy, insatiable curiosity, and desire to meet and help the younger generation, he showed us how a career should be built progressively and organically in order to achieve one’s own artistic goal. I feel extremely fortunate to have had the chance to meet Sir Georg in the last three years of his life when he was extremely generous to share with me his extremely precise and powerful musical ideas. He also gave me the best advice: ‘Never give up, keep working, there is always room at the top.'”\n\nOnline, Gramophone also includes a link to an article from 1981, written by Edward Greenfield. The article describes some of the recording sessions for Solti’s 1981 recording of Mozart’s Le nozze di Figaro for London. A dream cast had been assembled:\n\nCount Almaviva Thomas Allen, baritone\n\nCountess Almaviva Kiri Te Kanawa, soprano\n\nSusanna Lucia Popp, soprano\n\nFigaro Samuel Ramey, bass\n\nCherubino Frederica von Stade, mezzo-soprano\n\nMarcellina Jane Berbié, mezzo-soprano\n\nDoctor Bartolo Kurt Moll, bass\n\nDon Basilio Robert Tear, tenor\n\nDon Curzio Philip Langridge, tenor\n\nBarbarina Yvonne Kenny, soprano\n\nAntonio Giorgio Tadeo, bass\n\nJeffrey Tate, continuo\n\nLondon Philharmonic Orchestra\n\nLondon Opera Chorus\n\nThe recording won the 1983 Grammy Award for Best Opera Recording from the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences.\n\nThree other notable conductors affiliated with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra also made Gramophone‘s list: Pierre Boulez (principal guest conductor 1995-2006, conductor emeritus 2006- ), Daniel Barenboim (music director 1991-2006), and Claudio Abbado (principal guest conductor 1982-1985).\n\n____________________________________________________\n\nSir Georg Solti led the Chicago Symphony Orchestra’s first trip to the Soviet Union and Hungary in November 1990, also including a single stop in Vienna.\n\nNovember 21, 1990 – Bolshoi Hall of the Philharmonie, Leningrad (now Saint Petersburg), Soviet Union\n\nSaturday, November 24, 1990 – Great Hall of the Conservatory, Moscow, Soviet Union\n\nFriday, November 30, 1990 – Musikvereinsaal, Vienna, Austria\n\nBARTÓK Dance Suite\n\nMAHLER Symphony No. 5\n\nNovember 22, 1990 – Bolshoi Hall of the Philharmonie, Leningrad, Soviet Union\n\nMonday, November 26, 1990 – Great Hall of the Conservatory, Moscow, Soviet Union\n\nBRUCKNER Symphony No. 8\n\nWednesday, November 28, 1990 – Congress Centre, Budapest, Hungary\n\nBARTÓK Dance Suite\n\nBARTÓK Piano Concerto No. 3\n\nAndrás Schiff, piano\n\nBARTÓK Concerto for Orchestra\n\nTwo recordings were made during the tour, both for London Records. The performance of Bruckner’s Eighth Symphony was recorded live in Leningrad on November 22 (London’s first recording venture in the Soviet Union); Michael Haas was the producer, James Lock and Colin Moorfoot were the engineers, and Sally Drew was the tape editor. Mahler’s Fifth Symphony was recorded live in Vienna on November 30, Michael Haas was the producer, Stan Goodall was the engineer, and Matthew Hutchinson was the tape editor.\n\nThe concerts in Leningrad and Moscow were part of a cultural exchange that brought the Leningrad Philharmonic to Chicago for two weeks of subscription concerts at Orchestra Hall, with Music Director Yuri Temirkanov and Associate Conductor Mariss Jansons sharing the podium:\n\nNovember 13, 15, and 18, 1990\n\nYuri Temirkanov, conductor\n\nTCHAIKOVSKY Violin Concerto in D Major, Op. 35\n\nViktor Tretyakov, violin\n\nTCHAIKOVSKY Manfred Symphony, Op. 58\n\nNovember 16 and 17, 1990\n\nMariss Jansons, conductor\n\nPROKOFIEV Excerpts from Romeo and Juliet, Op. 64\n\nPROKOFIEV Piano Concerto No. 1 in D-flat Major, Op. 10\n\nDmitri Alexeev, piano\n\nTCHAIKOVSKY Symphony No. 5 in E Minor, Op. 64\n\n____________________________________________________\n\nFor the Chicago Symphony Orchestra’s centennial season in 1990-91—also Sir Georg Solti’s final season as music director—fourteen works were commissioned, including Sir Michael Tippett‘s Byzantium.\n\nThe work was commissioned jointly by the CSO and Carnegie Hall (also celebrating its centennial that season), and was underwritten by Mr. and Mrs. A. Watson Armour III in memory of Mrs. Armour‘s sister Anne Wood Mitchell.\n\nSolti conducted performances at Orchestra Hall on April 11 and 13, and again at Carnegie Hall on April 15 and 18, 1991. Soprano Faye Robinson was the soloist.\n\nThe composer contributed to the program note: “My own attraction to [Yeats’s poem], as a vehicle for composition, was twofold: firstly, the crystalline intensity of the poem itself offered a challenge in setting its verbal imagery to music; secondly, I identified completely with its emphasis on the notion of artifact, enshrining values that can be set against the impermanence of the everyday world and the complexities of the human beating heart.” The text for Byzantium can be found here.\n\nThe work was recorded live during the Carnegie Hall performances for London Records. Michael Haas was the producer, John Pellowe was the engineer, and Sally Drew was the tape editor.\n\n____________________________________________________\n\nOn March 13, 1986, Sir Georg Solti conducted the world premiere of George Rochberg‘s Symphony no. 5, which had been commissioned to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the founding of the City of Chicago. The work was dedicated to Solti and the Orchestra in memory of John S. Edwards, general manager of The Orchestral Association from 1967 until 1984.\n\nThe composer was in Chicago for the premiere and contributed to the program notes: “My 5th Symphony is an intense, passionate work of an emotional scale which I hope wholly befits the city, the occasion, the conductor, and the orchestra for which it was written. It was John Edwards, long-time executive director and manager of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, who originally approached me with the idea of writing such a work and I am truly sorry he is not here any longer to share these first performances with me and his colleagues.\n\n“The character of this work is mainly chromatic with virtually no overt references to the tonal palette which most people have come to associate with my music. Its form, which derives from its general content, is unique for me, not so much because it is cast in seven sections comprising one large-scale, uninterrupted movement, but because I have tried to mix formal procedures with imagistic ones in a process of organic growth stemming from a core. . . .\n\n“One has to imagine a kind of constantly evolving and spiralling funnel, starting from the opening statement—the core of the work—which, as it spirals upward and outward in increasingly widening turns with each new section, gathers up ideas and materials already stated until at the Finale everything which has been previously expressed is brought together and unified.”"
