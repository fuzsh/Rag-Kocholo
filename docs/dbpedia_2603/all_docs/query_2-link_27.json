        "text": "From an article by Ralph Wood entitled The Piano as an Orchestral Instrument (which is dated 1934, so maybe there's more recent scholarship):\n\nSo far as I know, the earliest composer to add the piano to his \"battery\" was, as might be expected, Berlioz. In Lélio [1832–ed.] he used a piano (à 4 mains) to produce certain crystalline, ethereal effects, which presumably were just what he wanted, and which certainly he could not have got in any other way. That was, however, a very isolated specimen, and not until the present century did the piano really begin consolidating its position in the orchestral forces.\n\nI'm not sure why Mr. Wood did not include the concertante by Mozart mentioned in the comments; perhaps he did not consider it a \"full-scale\" orchestral piece, or perhaps he was simply unaware of it. My best guess is that while Lélio has a narrator, and has movements that include both chorus and solo vocalists, it is not a piece for \"soloist with accompaniment\", while Mozart's piece is. The piano plays a more conventional \"vocal accompaniment\" role in the first movement, but in the final movement it is fully integrated with the orchestra. (It's definitely an oddball piece—the full score is available on IMSLP for those who want to check it out.)\n\nIn any event, the linked article is fun to read for the incredible amounts of shade Mr. Wood throws at the very idea of putting a piano into an orchestra:\n\nThere is something about the timbre of a piano, hard, constant, impersonal as it is, which refuses to mix. It refuses to mix with strings. It refuses to mix with the human voice (with the consequence that a large proportion of any song recital, whatever it may be to the mind, is somewhat of a trial to the ear.) It refuses, above all, to mix with an orchestra.\n\nThe last is the sort of rash, passionate declaration that might be evoked by the intolerable ordeal of hearing a series of all the notable piano concertos existent. They are of many kinds. They contain widely different varieties of treatement. I have yet to hear one, ancient or modern, which shall avoid paining my ear."
