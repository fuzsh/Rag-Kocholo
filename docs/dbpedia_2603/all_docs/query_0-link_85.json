Proof of vaccination or negative COVID-19 test (within 72 hours of the performance) required. Details of these protocols available here.\n\nProgram Notes\n\nAlong with Leos Janacek, Bohuslav Martinů was one of the twin giants of Czech music in the twentieth century, a composer with a distinctly individual voice and a versatility that led him to excel in every medium from stage works to symphonies to string quartets – a compositional output of nearly 400 works. Martinů’s Sextet for piano, flute, oboe, clarinet, and two bassoons, written in 1929 during the composer’s time in Paris, reveals a French-influenced neoclassical style with the rhythmic energy of jazz and Central European folk music.\n\nAccording to composer Katahj Copley, the Serenade for Wind Nonet is intended to be programmatic, depicting the growth of a person out of heartbreak and into a new relationship. The opening movement reflects fresh heartbreak through somber melodic lines showcased in the flutes and oboes. The third movement displays a quasi-romantic waltz as new love is found, and the final movement features driving rhythmic passages encouraging the excitement of love and new possibilities. The Serenade deviates from the typical oboe, bassoon, horn, and clarinet instrumentation of other established serenades in the cannon in favor of a large contingent of saxophones, resulting in a tuneful, unique, and charming work.\n\nLowell Shaw’s volumes of Fripperies are books of lighthearted and easily read jazz horn quartets--yet the challenge of them lies in interpretation. Horn is not typically a jazz instrument, yet Shaw’s treatment of voicing and range in his Fripperies (creating pillowy timbres within the jazz harmonic vernacular) make it seem like the horn was destined for jazz all along. In explaining his Fripperies, Shaw said,“it seemed best to give [my students] some small exposure to particularly the eighth-note patterns that are so different from what we had experienced in the Kopprasch [etude] books. My aim was to give them some idea where those pesky final off-the-beat eights fall within the uneven swing notation.”\n\nSonata for Four Horns is deeply rooted in postwar expressionism, containing harmonies evocative of deep turmoil struggling for power over a peaceful solace. This work, three movements in length, summates to be a large tone poem concluding with variations on an old German song “Ich Schell mein Horn”. Movement 1, Fugato, sees the entrance of each horn player over the opening measures, building a lusciously abrasive harmonic trajectory resolving to a resounding E minor statement. Paul Hindemith was an advocate for the concept of Gebrauchsmusik – or “music for use” – and wrote Sonata for Four Horns specifically for the Salzburg Horns.\n\nRuth Gipps was an English composer, as well as an accomplished oboist, pianist, educator, and conductor during the mid-late 20th century. As a student of Gordon Jacob and Ralph Vaughn Williams, her compositional influences often rejected the avant-garde styles of serialism and instead made significant use of instrumental color throughout her numerous chamber, orchestral, and choral works. Seascape, Op. 53 is a programmatic work inspired by her trip to a coastal town on the Isle of Thanet in Kent, England, where she describes the sounds of the storm and the sea during her stay at a hotel on the beach.\n\nEric Whitacre is an American Grammy-winning composer, as well as an accomplished conductor and lecturer. He is known for his numerous choral works and works for wind orchestra that includes his 2000 composition October. This programmatic work portrays the crisp autumn weather and subtle color changes of the season with melodies and harmonies influenced by English composers such as Ralph Vaughan Williams and Edward Elgar. David J. Miller’s brass ensemble arrangement of October was completed for The Barclay Brass and is dedicated to the memory of Betsy Geist.\n\nKurt Weill’s Little Threepenny Music was first performed in 1928 as the music to Bertolt Brecht play adaptation of John Gay’s work, The Beggar’s Opera. The play has been described both as a political satire of 1920s German society, as well as a socialist critique of the growing capitalist sentiment of the time. Its popularity remained and grew alongside capitalism as a social and industrial framework growing and expanding across the globe. The story follows the character Macheath, or Mack the Knife, and his exploits as a bandit and murderer in Victorian London and its underground network; Weill’s stylistic approach reflects the subject matter in his creative instrumentation with accordion and banjo, as well as liberal use of alto and tenor saxophone for jazz-influenced light-hearted melodic writing. German dance music of the 1920s, which itself was influenced by the growth of jazz and public radio broadcasting in the United States, also plays a pivotal role in informing the compositional forms Weill employs, seen in his structure of movements as fox trots, tangos, or waltzes.\n\nEnrique Crespo’s Bruckner Etude fur das tiefe blech (translated as “Bruckner Etude for the deep metal sheet”), pays tribute to a composer who frequently gives tuba players a leading role in orchestral performances. Crespo wrote this piece, originally for four tubas or trombones, in Bruckner’s style. This arrangement is composed for five trombones and one tuba.\n\nIn his early works of the 1940’s and 1950’s, Chou Wen-Chung was grappling with the challenge of fusing the East and West: How can Chinese material be developed with Western techniques yet remain intrinsically Eastern? The solution is found in the Suite for Harp and Wind Quintet which captures the color, mood and emotion implied in the seemingly simple folk material by means of its own transmutation. The work features five traditional Chinese melodies cast in five continuous movements, each of a contrasting character.\n\nRichard Strauss’ Serenade in Eb, op. 7 was written when the composer was only 17 years old. Composed in traditional sonata form, the single-movement Serenade blends the traditionally classical styles of Mozart, Brahms, and Mendelssohn with Strauss’ own burgeoning use of chromaticism and soaring, lyrical melodic lines. Much like Mozart’s Gran Partita, written one hundred years earlier, Strauss’ Serenade employs a force of thirteen wind instruments, utilizing flutes instead of Mozart’s basset horns, and a contrabassoon (or tuba) instead of a contrabass. Audiences will find the Serenade refreshing, familiar, and musically deep and vibrant.\n\nArtist Bios\n\nSOLOISTS\n\nKay Yeh is currently in her second year as a DMA student under the tutelage of Professor Robin McCabe. She earned her Master's degree in piano performance from the University of Washington in 2015. Prior to coming to Seattle to pursue her passion for piano, Kay's creativity expanded to graphic design and illustration as she earned her Bachelor's degree in Architecture from National Cheng-Kung University in Taiwan.\n\nKelly Hou has been playing the harp for seven years. She was a part of the Seattle Youth Symphony for four years before enrolling at the University of Washington in 2019 as an Informatics major, and then later joining the University of Washington Wind Ensemble and Symphony Orchestra in 2020 as a music performance major. In the future, Kelly hopes to become a professional harpist and harp teacher, although working at Amazon is always another option. A question that she is often asked is “what made you start playing the harp”? The answer: a picture book about leprechauns playing golden harps, several stressful piano lessons as a child, and a desire to play an instrument that is a full foot taller than her.\n\nTHE UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON WIND ENSEMBLE\n\nThe University of Washington Wind Ensemble has performed at many prestigious music conventions, has presented several world premiere performances of outstanding new music for wind band and in 2004, undertook a highly acclaimed nine-day concert tour of the Kansai region of Japan, returning for more extensive tours of that country in 2007 and 2010. The UW Wind Ensemble presented several concerts in the main concert venues of Beijing, China in March of 2013, including a sold-out concert in the National Center for the Performing Arts in Tiananmen Square that was broadcast nationwide on China Central Television. The ensemble returned to China in both 2016 and 2019, playing before large crowds in Beijing, Shanghai, Xi'an and Chengdu. In the spring of 2006, the ensemble was invited by the Seattle Symphony Orchestra to present a concert at Benaroya Hall as a part of the Symphony’s Made in America\n\nFestival. The London Financial Times review of the concert applauded “music of surprising sophistication…Cindy McTee’s Finish Line pulsated energetically, and William Bolcom’s Song was simply gorgeous.” Following the 2006 performance the ensemble was invited for return appearances on Seattle Symphony concert series in 2007, 2008 and, most recently in 2011 when Maestro Gerard Schwarz conducted the ensemble. The UW Wind Ensemble has collaborated with internationally renowned guest artists, conductors and composers including Eddie Daniels, Steve Houghton, Allen Vizzutti, Jeffery Fair, Chris Olka, James Walker, Douglas Yeo, Leigh Howard Stevens, David Maslanka, Michael Colgrass, Bonnie Whiting, Cindy McTee, Eric Ewazen, Satoshi Yagisawa, David Stanhope, John DiCesare, David Gordon, Mary Lynch, Seth Krimsky, Michael Brockman and Huck Hodge. Nihon Pals, a music education resource company based in Osaka, Japan, released a set of instructional DVDs regarding ensemble musicality featuring the UW Wind Ensemble.\n\nPersonnel\n\nUNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON WIND ENSEMBLE\n\nFLUTE\n\nTracia Pan, Fr., Music Performance, Bellevue*\n\nElizabeth Nilles, So., Music Performance/Biology, Camas\n\nStephanie Chuang, Sr., Computer Science/Cinema and Media Studies, Camas\n\nCarson Chadd, Fr., Music Performance, Marysville\n\nOBOE\n\nDaren Weissfisch, Grad., Orchestral Conducting, Ridgewood, NJ*\n\nKamill Tarnawczyk, Sr., Physics/Music, Edmonds\n\nOliver Wang, Jr., undeclared, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China\n\nBASSOON\n\nJulien Tsang, Grad., Accounting, Kent*\n\nChloe Person, So., Music History, Kenmore\n\nNate Chen, So., Computer Science, Vancouver\n\nCLARINET\n\nKhang Zhie Phoong, Sr., Computer Science, Singapore*\n\nAlex Gee, Fr., undeclared, Camas\n\nConrad Lin, So., Statistics, Boise, ID\n\nMegan Rideout Redeker, Jr., Music Performance, Bainbridge Island\n\nTyler Roberts, Post Bac., Music Education, Redmond\n\nMina Hung, Jr., Art & Food System, Nutrition, and Health, Taipei, Taiwan\n\nBASS CLARINET\n\nEmerson Bowles, Jr., Physics, San Diego, CA\n\nSAXOPHONE\n\nNicholas Franks, Jr., Music Education, Camarillo, CA*\n\nDiego Mesquita, So., Civil Engineering, Bellingham\n\nLisa Dockendorff, Jr., Society, Ethics, and Human Behavior, Vernon, CT\n\nKatie Zundel, Fr., Music Performance/Engineering, Clinton\n\nTRUMPET\n\nShaun Day, Grad., Wind Conducting, Cincinnati, OH*\n\nZach Griffin, So., Music Performance, Bothell\n\nCarlos Alvarez, So., undeclared, Kirkland\n\nCaroline Kelly, Music Performance/Environmental Science, Chelan\n\nColton Lindstrand, So., Biology, Marysville\n\nBrandon Cain, Jr., Music Education, Graham\n\nJennifer Stump, So., undeclared, Lynnwood\n\nHORN\n\nAnna Perry, Grad., Music Performance, Hilliard, OH*\n\nNicholas Hidy, Grad., Music Performance, Sebastopol, CA\n\nMaia Willebrand, So., Aeronautics and Astronautics, Puyallup\n\nKiyoshi Colon, Fr., Chemistry, Everett\n\nAaron Anderson, Jr., Music Performance, Tigard, OR\n\nTROMBONE\n\nNeal Muppidi, So., Physics/Music, Austin, TX*\n\nSean Grimm, Sr., Statistics, Vancouver\n\nJonathan Elsner, Jr., Mathematics, Kent\n\nAlberto Macias, Jr., Psychology, Yakima\n\nClayton Thomas, Sr., Electrical Engineering, Kenmore\n\nEUPHONIUM\n\nCorey Jahlas, Grad., Wind Conducting, Highland, MI\n\nEthan Walker, So., Music Education, Kenmore\n\nTUBA\n\nBen Berlien, community member, Seattle*\n\nRoger Wu Fu, Grad., Wind Conducting, Santiago, Chile\n\nBASS\n\nBeau Wood, Sr., Music Performance, Longview\n\nPERCUSSION\n\nScott Farkas, Grad., Music Performance, Twin Falls, ID*\n\nAbigail George, So., Music Performance, Redmond\n\nNina Okubo, So., undeclared, Yakima\n\nBrindha Jaeger, Fr., Music Performance/Environmental Science, Stanford, CA\n\nSimon Harty, Fr., undeclared, Boise, ID\n\nRyan Baker, So., Music Performance, Gig Harbor\n\nPIANO\n\nYen-Chun (Kay) Yeh, Grad., Music Performance, Chaiyi, Taiwan\n\nHARP\n\nKelly Guangyin Hou, So., Music Performance/Informatics, Bellevue\n\nGRADUATE STUDENT CONDUCTORS\n\nShaun Day, Grad., Wind Conducting, Cincinnati, Ohio\n\nCorey Jahlas, Grad., Wind Conducting, Highland, MI\n\nRoger Wu Fu, Grad., Wind Conducting, Santiago, Chile\n\n*principal"
