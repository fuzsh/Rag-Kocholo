The recording includes concertos by Bach and Vivaldi alongside Holst's St Paul's Suite, and Eine Kleine Nachtmusik and Symphony No 40 by Mozart, all led by OPO founder, conductor, and music director Carlos Bastidas. Inspired by watching broadcasts of the Boston Pops Orchestra as a youngster in his native Colombia, Bastidas founded the OPO in 2014 to foster musicianship in a positive, inclusive and supportive environment. One of the most diverse professional orchestras in Canada, the Toronto-based orchestra performs classical and popular music, provides musicians with performance and professional development opportunities, and highlights the work of women and BIPOC composers and instrumentalists.\n\n24 MARCH 2023\n\nCody Fry: Symphonic + Pop\n\nDecca Records US\n\nRelease: 24 March 2023\n\nCody Fry has forged a unique musical path combining sentimental songwriting and exquisitely detailed orchestral arrangements. Symphonic + Pop is a deluxe 2LP vinyl package that celebrates Cody's genre-bending career highlights. A single disc edition is also available on LP and CD.\n\n17 MARCH 2023\n\nSchumann & Brahms\n\nBenjamin Grosvenor\n\nDecca Classics\n\nRelease: 17 March 2023\n\nAcclaimed British pianist, Benjamin Grosvenor, still only thirty and yet a well-established favourite of critics and audiences around the globe, takes Robert Schumann's haunting Kreisleriana as his starting point in his new album. This eight-movement work portrays the mercurial personality of the fictional Johannes Kreisler, created by E T A Hoffmann: Kreisler's highs and lows, and his dreamy nature, clearly mirror Schumann's own tragic manic-depressive tendencies. Grosvenor responds to the composer's autobiographical honesty with playing of sublime tenderness, dazzling variety, and imaginative empathy.\n\nIcelandic Works for the Stage\n\nIceland Symphony Orchestra / Rumon Gamba\n\nChandos CHSA 5319\n\nRelease: 17 March 2023\n\nPáll Ísólfsson was the first director of the Reykjavík Music School, which opened in 1930. Like other musicians, he was forced by the lack of opportunity in Iceland to study abroad but, unlike others, he was able to return and work as the Organist at Reykjavík Cathedral to support his activities as a composer. His music for the early Ibsen play The Feast at Solhaug, performed in 1943 in Norwegian on Norway's National day, was his theatrical début. This was followed in 1945 by the more ambitious score for Úr Myndabók Jónasar Hallgrímssonar. Jórunn Viðar started her advanced training at Ísólfsson's conservatory, followed by studies in Berlin and then at the Juilliard School. In New York she met a fellow Icelander and dance student, Sigríður Ármann. The two of them collaborated on Eldur (Fire), which would be the first ballet for the new National Theatre in Reykjavík, presented in May 1950. Their second collaboration for the National Theatre, Ólafur Liljurós, opened in 1952 and is based on a traditional Nordic legend. Rumon Gamba conducts the Iceland Symphony Orchestra, and the album is recorded in Surround-Sound and available as a Hybrid SACD.\n\nGolden Oldies - More Favourite Encores\n\nBrodsky Quartet; Laura van der Heijden, cello; Julian Jacobson, piano\n\nChandos CHAN 20230\n\nRelease: 17 March 2023\n\nSince its formation in 1972 the Brodsky Quartet has performed more than 3000 concerts on the major concert stages of the world and has released more than seventy recordings. A natural curiosity and insatiable desire to explore have propelled the group in many artistic directions and continue to ensure it not only a place at the very forefront of the international chamber music scene but also a rich and varied musical existence. The cellist, Jacqueline Thomas, writes: 'The Brodsky Quartet celebrated its fiftieth anniversary in 2022. Looking back, I find it wonderful that ten- and twelve-year-olds were already infused with passion and with a belief in the longevity that is now playing out. Two of us remain from the beginning; one joined as we turned professional, forty years ago, and our new fourth member has trodden her own similar path in the endlessly fulfilling life that is the string quartet. It has become something of a tradition that we release a compilation disc once every ten years, and so now, in our Golden Anniversary year, we have assembled a playlist from past and new arrangements, taking inspiration from the old days and even revamping some of our childhood efforts.'\n\n10 MARCH 2023\n\nInvocations\n\nApollo5 Vocal Ensemble\n\nVOCES8 VCM150\n\nRelease: 10 March 2023\n\nBorn out of the group's desire to share personal favourite songs that have resonated with each of them throughout their lives, the programme spans Tudor and Baroque music to 20th-century pop, folk and jazz.\n\nThe American Project\n\nYuja Wang, Teddy Abrams, Louisville Orchestra\n\nDeutsche Grammophon\n\nRelease: 10 March 2023\n\nYuja Wang is the brilliant soloist in a piano concerto by a longtime friend of hers: Teddy Abrams. The music director of the Louisville Orchestra, which he conducts here, describes his virtuosic piece as 'an opportunity for the piano to guide us through what I think is one of the strengths of American culture, its plurality, its interconnectedness'. Also written for Yuja Wang, the solo piano work You Come Here Often? is by another great friend of hers, Michael Tilson Thomas.\n\n3 MARCH 2023\n\nPhilip Sawyers: Double Concerto for violin and cello; Viola Concerto; Remembrance for strings; Octet\n\nDavid Rowland, violin, viola; Maja Bogdanović, cello; English Symphony Orchestra / Kenneth Woods\n\nNimbus Alliance NI 6436\n\nRelease: 3 March 2023\n\n'In 2009 I was commissioned to write a cello concerto by the Sydenham International Music Festival for one of their rising stars, Maja Bogdanović. Since her musical and personal connection with the amazing violinist Daniel Rowland, it had been in my mind to write them a double concerto. Overshadowed by the famous Brahms Double Concerto, this was a somewhat daunting task. It is a piece which reflects ideas of journeys which develop initial ideas as the music unfolds and unlike previous concertos, there is no first movement cadenza. In 2020-21, a friend and colleague asked me if I would write a piece to mark the loss of his mother. He also wanted it, in some way, to be for both of his late parents. He told me how fond of my tone poem the Valley of Vision she was, so I 'hid' a few quotations from that piece in the new one. He also requested something akin in mood to Elgar's Elegy for Strings. The resulting composition, I hope, meets all these wishes. The viola concerto was written in 2020. The idea came after attending recording sessions and performances of a double concerto for violin, viola and string orchestra by my fellow composer and friend David Matthews. The lovely playing of the viola part by Sarah-Jane Bradley set off some ideas for a viola concerto of my own. In 2007 the mixed chamber music ensemble 'Liquid Architecture' commissioned me to write them an octet for their appearance at the Chelsea Schubert Festival. The Schubert Octet was on their programme so the instrumentation was pre-determined: clarinet, horn, bassoon, two violins, viola, cello and double bass. The piece is in one continuous movement in four sections: Adagio, Allegro, Andante and Allegro.' - Philip Sawyers\n\nJonathan Dove: Cello Concerto In Exile: first recording\n\nRaphael Wallfisch; Simon Keenlyside; City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra / Gergely Madaras\n\nLyrita SRCD-413\n\nRelease: 3 March 2023\n\nThe idea of writing a cello concerto for Raphael Wallfisch was first mooted more than ten years ago at the Banff Arts Centre, Canada, where Jonathan Dove was composer-in-residence. The two men spoke of Dove's interest in writing a piece for cello and orchestra, and after further meetings in London, the work began to take shape. Given the composer's extensive experience of writing for the voice, it was decided that the score would be written for baritone singer and solo cello with orchestra with texts taken from poems by various writers. The subject matter was suggested by the Wallfisch family history. Raphael's father fled, together with his mother and brother, to Palestine from Breslau in 1937, and his mother, Anita Lasker-Wallfisch, is a concentration camp survivor. She has written of the persecution of her Jewish family during the Second World War and her own incarceration in Auschwitz and Belsen, where her skill as a cellist saved her life. Knowing of these events, Jonathan Dove was inspired to base the work's theme on the universal experience of refugees being exiled from their homeland.\n\nChopin\n\nRafał Blechacz\n\nDeutsche Grammophon\n\nRelease: 3 March 2023\n\nRafał Blechacz has been deeply associated with the music of Fryderyk Chopin across his whole career. His devotion to the music of his great compatriot began long before 2005 when he won the Warsaw Chopin Competition. The two famous sonatas have always been close to his heart and, as Blechacz says, never more so than today: 'The Funeral March of No 2 has extra resonances in this difficult time, with a pandemic and war in Ukraine. There was a special sense of dedication as I recorded this sonata.' Blechacz complements the two large works with Chopin's haunting F sharp minor Nocturne and his exquisite Barcarolle.\n\nLofi Symphony\n\nL.Dre\n\nRelease: 3 March 2023\n\nDeutsche Grammophon\n\nL.Dre is a true master of lo-fi, but on his album LoFi Symphony for Deutsche Grammophon, he rose to a completely new challenge: to combine Lo-Fi Beats with high quality recordings of classical orchestra musicians. A bold combination of two worlds and a conscious clashing with the style led to an impressive result, becoming more than just the sum of its parts.\n\nSilvestrov: Silent Songs\n\nHélène Grimaud, Konstantin Krimmel\n\nDeutsche Grammophon\n\nRelease: 3 March 2023\n\nNearly twenty years have passed since Hélène Grimaud first encountered Valentin Silvestrov's Silent Songs, and finally she has found a partner to perform these songs with in the sensational young baritone Konstantin Krimmel. 'It's music I find very touching in its honest and transparency. It's poetic. It's not pretending to be anything, and has a very special colour and texture.'\n\nShostakovich: Symphony No 12 'The Year 1917'; Symphony No 15\n\nBBC Philharmonic / John Storgårds\n\nChandos CHSA 5334 (SACD)\n\nRelease: 3 March 2023\n\nThe BBC Philharmonic and its new chief conductor, John Storgårds, follow their previous release of Shostakovich's Eleventh Symphony with this album of Symphonies Nos 12 and 15. Subtitled 'The Year 1917', the Twelfth Symphony was a project which Shostakovich had been planning and discussing for two decades - a symphony about Lenin. The first movement, 'Revolutionary Petrograd', depicts the arrival of Lenin in Petrograd in April 1917 and his meetings with the working people of the city. The second, 'Razliv', commemorates the site of Lenin's retreat to the north of the city. 'Aurora', the third movement, refers to the Russian battleship the revolutionary mutinous crew of which fired the first shot of the attack on the Winter Palace. Finally, 'The Dawn of Humanity' celebrates the ultimate victory of the Great October Socialist Revolution. Musically, the Twelfth seems to regress to a more simplistic musical language than that of the immediately preceding Symphony - which some commentators ascribe to Shostakovich's joining the Communist Party and perhaps trying harder to meet its expectations. The Fifteenth (and last) Symphony was written entirely in July 1971, at a composer's rest home in Repino, north-west of Leningrad. It was his first non-programmatic symphony since the Tenth, and Shostakovich was wary of discussing the meaning of it, but eventually commented that it might be understood as representing the journey from life to death. Recorded in Surround-Sound and available as a Hybrid SACD.\n\nThe Jade Mountain - Songs by Edmund Rubbra\n\nLucy Crowe, soprano; Claire Barnett-Jones, mezzo-soprano; Marcus Farnsworth, baritone; Timothy Ridout, viola; Catrin Finch, harp; Iain Burnside, piano\n\nChandos CHAN 20182\n\nRelease: 3 March 2023\n\nWhilst the English composer Edmund Rubbra is best known for his symphonic output, he\n\ncomposed a good deal of vocal music, and wrote songs throughout his compositional life.\n\nRubbra studied with Cyril Scott and Gustav Holst, and was a great friend of his\n\ncontemporary Gerald Finzi. The songs are notable for their variation in accompaniment\n\n(less than half are set for piano, the rest for harp, string quartet, string orchestra, or full orchestra). This album contains all his published songs with piano and harp accompaniment, and includes the first and last songs of the composer's output. Lucy Crowe, Claire Barnett-Jones, and Marcus Farnsworth are the three singers on the album, Catrin Finch (harp) and Iain Burnside (piano) the accompanists. Timothy Ridout (viola) joins for the Two Sonnets by William Alabaster, Op 87.\n\nStanley Silverman: In Celebration\n\nKalichstein Laredo Robinson Trio\n\nSignum Classics SIGCD738\n\nRelease: 3 March 2023\n\nKalichstein Laredo Robinson Trio's first album for Signum Classics features two piano trios by Stanley Silverman and features Sting as a guest artist on track 4. The two piano trios featured on the album - Reveille (Trio No 2) and In Celebration - have both been central works in the Trio's repertoire. Reveille (Trio No 2) was written in 2011 for the Trio and Sting who premiered the piece at the 92nd Street Y in New York to commemorate the tenth anniversary of 9/11. Stanley Silverman dedicated the piece to Herman Sandler, a family friend and classical music supporter who sadly lost his life in 9/11. Stanley's son Ben commissioned him to write the work to honour Sandler. In Celebration (Trio No 1) was written by Silverman in 1989 following the Trio's request for him to write something 'jazzy'. Silverman's inspiration for In Celebration was a generation of well-known people who had turned seventy that year, including American musicians Leonard Bernstein and Arthur Miller, English writer Anthony Burgess and baseball players Joe DiMaggio and Ted Williams. The trio features dance rhythms that spanned the seventy years prior to its writing in 1989. The piece was premiered by the Trio at the Krannert Center followed by a New York premiere at the 92nd Street Y, as both venues co-commissioned the work.\n\n1 MARCH 2023\n\nFrescobaldi: Complete Keyboard Works\n\nRoberto Loreggian, organ, harpsichord\n\nBrilliant Classics 96895 (15 CDs)\n\nRelease: 1 March 2023\n\nDefinitive recordings by the leading Frescobaldi performer of our time, now more conveniently packaged than ever. In 2007, Roberto Loreggian embarked on a project that would see him record every published work by Girolamo Frescobaldi. Issued as a box in 2011, the Frescobaldi Edition was widely recognised as establishing a new standard of textual authority and interpretative understanding for a composer whose own works have never been as appreciated as much as their influence on his successors. Then, in 2022, came a new set which committed to disc for the first time all the surviving unpublished music composed by Frescobaldi and recovered from obscure sources by Etienne Darbellay and Costanze Frey. All these recordings are now coupled with the keyboard collections from the earlier set, to present the most complete collection ever issued of Frescobaldi's works for harpsichord and organ, both sacred and secular. The importance of Frescobaldi can hardly be overstated, either for his own time or subsequent generations. In his day, his fame, as modest as it may seem to us today, exceeded that of virtually all his contemporaries, except perhaps Claudio Monteverdi, and he was unrivalled as a virtuoso. Ferrara born, he became organist at St Peter's in Rome, and attracted crowds of thousands to hear his playing. He spent seven years in Florence at the height of his career, being dissatisfied with his rewards in Rome, and wrote several collections for the Medici family, before returning to Rome. In the genres of canzona, toccata, capriccio, partite and ricercar, Frescobaldi left many pieces that stylistically bridge lies in style the Franco-Flemish imitative polyphony of the Renaissance, and the fugal form of the Baroque age. Extravagant, ambiguous, beautiful, dramatic and sometimes exquisite, the music of Frescobaldi is the musical equivalent of the art of Caravaggio, Bernini and Pietro da Cortona. No less than them, he embodies early-Baroque genius in Italy.\n\nMozart: Divertimento KV563\n\nNuovo Trio Italiano d'Archi\n\nBrilliant Classics 95959\n\nRelease: 1 March 2023\n\nFranz Schubert (1792-1828) only ever completed one string trio, his Trio in B flat D581 (1817). The writing is clearly inspired by the works of Mozart, not from a great trio like the Divertimento KV563, but from easier and made-for-piano genres like the violin sonatas. The cello, in fact, still remains in the orbit of the basso continuo, while the viola accompanies the main theme with formulas similar to the Alberti bass. Schubert's spark, however, is present in this minor work, for example in his way of dilating time at the beginning of the development with a phrasing that stretches, with simplicity, to infinity. The writing reveals a glimmer of the orchestral sound of the great chamber works of the last period, but nevertheless it remains linked to the elegant style of the late eighteenth century.\n\nWolfgang Amadeus Mozart's (1756-1791) Divertimento in E flat KV564 (1788) was written for Michael Puchberg, a music lover who often financially supported Mozart in the last years of his life. The work bears the clear imprint of Masonic symbology, based around the number 3. The Divertimento presents several enigmatic aspects, firstly the choice of title. 'Divertimento', like cassation or serenade, was a genre of music entertainment, without intellectual ambitions or strong emotions. In Divertimento KV563, the three musicians must be high-level virtuosos to play their parts, which explore the full register of each instrument in a dialogue intertwined with contributions at the same level from the three participants. The only link with the traditional genre is the high number of movements (six), including two minuets. In this piece, Mozart's writing shows an extraordinary richness with respect to thematic invention, with an overabundance of ideas that feed a dense polyphonic dialogue. Mozart was experimenting with a fusion between the forms of instrumental music and the dramaturgy of his plays, with revolutionary results in both fields. The dynamism of the theatre, for example, is an essential element of the fluid liveliness of this Divertimento's sonata. The slow movement represents another point of contact with the work, and this Adagio, the expressive heart of the work, is structured like a great solo aria. Mozart chose the key of A flat major, rare in his music and always ambassador of special moments, to express the melancholy of this world. In certain moments, the intensity of the singing becomes so dramatic as to go beyond the boundaries of tonal language. Furthermore, the Masonic number has an almost obsessive importance in the writing, with counterpoints in three parts and variations in triplets. The spirit of Masonic Enlightenment is concentrated in the austere sonority of the minor variation, manifesting compassion and the detachment of true wisdom. The form of both the rondo and the sonata blend into an architecture of perfect proportions, developed in a movement full of grace and energy. There are two thematic elements - a lively Italian dance and a contrasting episode of vague militaristic tone. This material feeds an always alive and changing form, enriched by new harmonic ideas and ingenious transitions.\n\nCarlo Mannelli: Trio Sonatas Op 3\n\nEnsemble Giardino di Delizie / Ewa Anna Augustynowicz\n\nBrilliant Classics 96465\n\nRelease: 1 March 2023\n\nThe forgotten art of a seventeenth-century Roman master, in the hands of a dynamic period ensemble with a string of acclaimed rarity albums to their credit. The Baroque trio-sonata repertoire still yields up plenty of undiscovered treasure lying in libraries across Italy. The Ensemble Giardino di Delizie has been diving into it and coming up with polished gems on Brilliant Classics by Stradella (96079), Colista (96033) and Lonati (95590). Like Colista, Carlo Mannelli (1640-1697) was Roman by birth and training. He sang and played the violin for ensembles at both church and court, and was permitted to dedicate his Op 2 collection to Cardinal Benedetto Pamphilj. Perhaps it was the patronage of this influential family that opened doors to his training with Michelangelo Rossi, and to distinguished musical societies in Rome. Another noble Roman family was the recipient of Mannelli's Op 3 collection of trio sonatas, with its dedication to Prince Domenico Rospigliosi. Much of the composer's output is now lost, and we can only surmise at the riches deprived to us by time, given the fresh melodic invention of what survives here. Compared to Stradella and co, Mannelli cuts an eccentric, highly individual figure, musically speaking, and he has no interest in the orderliness of Corelli. The arrangement of slow and fast movements is unpredictable: the four-movement No 10 begins with three separate Adagios! The six- movement No 9 cuts a sequence of four slow movements in half with a fugue, and so on. Three of the twelve sonatas feature a ravishing aria for the violin, who takes on a soloist's role. When Mannelli writes quick music, he pushes his musicians to the limits, as in the finale of the First Sonata. Counterpoint is subordinate to the kind of highly elaborate violin writing at which Ewa Anna Augustynowicz has already shown herself to excel in previous albums, making this new recording an essential acquisition for Baroque-music aficionados.\n\nSamuel Barber: Complete Songs\n\nLeilah Dione Ezra, soprano; Elisabetta Lombardi, mezzo-soprano; Mauro Borgioni, baritone; Filippo Farinelli, piano\n\nBrilliant Classics 96514\n\nRelease: 1 March 2023\n\nThe songs of Samuel Barber offer the beauty of his output in microcosm. 'Complete' in this context used to mean the 47 songs gathered in a Deutsche Grammophon 2CD set from 1994, but there are 65 songs here, making it the most complete survey yet recorded. Most of the lesser-known and unpublished songs on CD3 date back to Barber's student years, but he took up composing young, and was always inclined towards writing for voices and responding to poetry. He made his matchlessly evocative setting of Matthew Arnold's Dover Beach when he was just 21 years old. However, by the time of the Op 10 Songs, Barber's harmonies have thickened in texture and expressionist harmony: these are heroic numbers demanding an interpreter of heroic projection, another world away from the almost painfully confessional mood of the music which has made his name such as Knoxville: Summer of 1915. Nevertheless, they paint a vivid portrait of Barber himself, who had a fine baritone voice and would delight in performing his songs while accompanying himself at the piano. Barber could read Proust in French, Goethe in German, Dante in Italian and Neruda in Spanish, and his erudite choice of poets and poems reflected facets of his complex character: a restless melancholy on the one hand, and an impish wit on the other. His part- Irish ancestry drew him towards Joyce, Yeats and James Stephens, and his interest in his Celtic heritage prompted the writing of his best-known song-prompted the writing of his best-known song-cycle, the Hermit Songs Op 29. Much later in life, he returned to song (and to Joyce) with Despite and Still Op 41 and the Three Songs Op 45. Both collections are coloured by introspection and resignation, but they are masterpieces of the song-writer's art. Among his many recordings for Brilliant Classics, the pianist Filippo Farinelli has made complete surveys of the song output of Berg, Ravel, Dallapiccola and Jolivet, in conjunction with colleagues who have immersed themselves in the idiom. Here he is likewise joined by a trio of Italian singers who show themselves at home with the wistful, changeable moods of Barber the song-composer.\n\nVivaldi: La Stravaganza Op 4 - Transcriptions for Organ\n\nLuca Scandali, organ\n\nBrilliant Classics 96614\n\nRelease: 1 March 2023\n\nThe concerto played a leading role in the evolution of the language and style of instrumental music from the late seventeenth century onwards, with its popularity and importance continuing to grow throughout the eighteenth century. Antonio Vivaldi (1678-1741) did not invent the concerto grosso or solo concerto, but he can, without a shadow of a doubt, be considered the composer who gave the greatest boost to the genre, turning it into the dominant form of instrumental music in the first half of the eighteenth century: without Vivaldi and his concertos, the history of music would surely have followed a different trajectory. La Stravaganza Op 4 was published in approximately 1714, and its 12 concerti are almost entirely written for solo violin, with the sole exception of Concerto No 7, which is scored for two violins and cello. The curious title (which literally means 'extravagance' or 'eccentricity') that Vivaldi gave to this collection seems to refer to the early Italian baroque style, which remained dominant throughout the 1600s through to the early 1700s. This particular style sought to move and cajole audiences in various ways, including expert use of eccentric features, trickery and virtuosity, and its influence was felt in all the seventeenth century's instrumental and vocal writing. Vivaldi's musical language and style also contained certain 'extravagant' elements, albeit interpreted in his own personal way. Numerous examples of stylistic originality marked a genuine departure from Corelli, while attesting to the bold experimentation and acrobatic virtuosity for which Vivaldi is renowned: asymmetry in form; extensive and inventive harmonic progressions; sudden, theatrical breaks; and prominent, fast and virtuosic solo parts. The concertos on this recording come from the Anne Dawson's Book collection, held in the Henry Watson Music Library in Manchester (UK). In addition to arias for voice and basso continuo, the collection, produced in around 1720, also contains a series of compositions for keyboard instruments and transcriptions of concertos by various composers, including ten by Vivaldi (three from Op 3 and seven from Op 4). The majority of the arrangements in this source are Italian concertos and serve to highlight in particular the huge popularity Vivaldi's concertos enjoyed. Like many transcriptions from the era, the arrangements in Anne Dawson's Book tend to prioritise the original score, while clearly adapting the pieces to the idiom of keyboard instruments and the opportunities they present. The anonymous arranger of Anne Dawson's Book aimed, and succeeded, to simplify the orchestral part in order to make it easier to perform at the keyboard without sacrificing anything of its originality or rhythmic and harmonic variety.\n\nAntonio Lauro: Guitar Music\n\nCristiano Poli Cappelli, guitar\n\nBrilliant Classics 96627 (2 CDs)\n\nRelease: 1 March 2023\n\nBorn in Venezuela to Italian parents, Antonio Lauro (1917-1986) was very young when he began taking music lessons from his father. At the age of 9, Lauro, against his family's wishes, began lessons in piano and composition at the Academia de Música y Declamación. However, after he encountered the music of Agustín Barrios Mangoré, Lauro gave up his violin and piano studies to dedicate himself completely to the guitar, moved as he was by Mangoré's music. Lauro went on to become an exceptional guitarist, as well as a composer. Politically engaged, Lauro was a fervent nationalist, and it was his political convictions that drove him to celebrate, and make in-depth studies of, the origins and heritage of Venezuelan music. In 1951, Lauro was imprisoned by General Marcos Pérez Jiménez on account of his democratic convictions; Lauro would later describe his prison experience as a normal part of life for a Venezuelan man of his generation. However, imprisonment did not deter him from organising a series of concerts, as well as continuing to compose wonderful pieces that\n\nwould later win him the National Music Prize, Venezuela's highest artistic award. And it was during his time in prison that he wrote two of his most important pieces: the Sonata for guitar and the famous Suite venezolana, followed by his Concerto for guitar and orchestra. His music, and particularly his pieces for guitar, transcended the confines of Venezuela's musical scene to become a hugely important benchmark for subsequent generations of players worldwide. His compositions for guitar aimed to create a synthesis of Venezuelan popular music with elaborate forms from the European tradition. He took inspiration firstly from popular and folk-inspired pieces such as the Venezuelan waltzes (valses venezolanos) and pieces written in traditional styles; secondly, from demanding works deploying the most sophisticated aspects and features of the Western compositional tradition, such as the Sonata and the Suite venezolana; and thirdly, contrapuntal styles. Lauro is a composer whose greatness is deserving of recognition above and beyond his accomplishments in the reinterpretation of music from the popular and folk traditions, hugely successful though these were. His great achievement as a composer was to absorb and synthesise, in an entirely idiosyncratic and personally creative manner, a range of highly distinct elements and to bring them to life in compositions of real substance. This recording aims to bring together all the different facets of Lauro's musical personality, while attempting to avoid the cliché of a folk-based, instinctual interpretation, instead approaching his music in a more structured manner.\n\nGiovanni Battista Sammartini: Sonatas for Cello & B C\n\nEnsemble Dolci Accenti\n\nBrilliant Classics 96767\n\nRelease: 1 March 2023\n\nThe essential contribution that Milan-born Giovanni Battista Sammartini (c.1700-1775) •made to the history of music is universally recognised. He laid the foundations for the Classical symphony: he helped establish the standard composition of the orchestra and promoted independence and individual timbres in his part-writing, while Baroque customs (most notably the basso continuo) gradually gave way to sonata form. In terms of repertoire and recordings, however, Sammartini is still a relative rarity; if you set aside his symphonies and start investigating his chamber music and works for solo instruments, for example, it is soon apparent that many enthralling compositions remain silently filed away in libraries and archives, waiting patiently for the recognition they deserve. The programme on this record ventures into this very partially unexplored terrain, showcasing a selection of sonatas for cello and basso continuo: the collection of six from his Op 4, published in Paris in 1742, and two sonatas of uncertain date, one in G major and the other in G minor. Although more modest than the symphonies, the cello sonatas display a similar penchant for succinct and elegant writing. Often simple in form, their brilliance stems from the inventiveness of the melody and rhythm and moments of particularly intense and expressive lyricism that are not reliant on excessive ornamentation. Christoph Willibald Gluck, according to some sources, studied under Sammartini: there are plenty of moments in the cello sonatas where echoes of what must have inspired the German master can be heard. When Franz Joseph Haydn was alive, he was also considered to owe a great deal to Sammartini; this seems to have struck a nerve, as he felt the need to distance himself from these claims, even calling his Italian colleague a 'pencil pusher'. However, it is important to note the confusing history behind the authorship of the cello sonatas on this album. Op 4 is almost certainly by Sammartini; the 'almost' is advisable only for Sonata No 6, which some scholars believe to be of doubtful authorship. The two sonatas in G major and G minor are less certain. Despite these caveats, the cello sonatas presented here remain an excellent example of the transition from the Baroque to the Classical period and particularly of a singularly elegant compositional style that expertly applies cello technique to imaginative and spontaneous invention. Partly for this reason, the performers on this recording have chosen to further enhance the individual character and freshness of each sonata by using different instruments for the basso continuo line, chosen freely but with strong historical foundations: as well as the more predictable harpsichord, they also make use of the archlute, theorbo and baroque guitar, in addition to melodic bass passages entrusted to a second cello. Overall, the seductive balance of formal precision and improvisatory spirit seen in Sammartini's better-known works is still clearly perceptible here; presenting the less easily identifiable works on this discographic rarity in his name therefore certainly does not do him a disservice.\n\nBernardino Bottazzi: Choro et Organo\n\nFederico Del Sordo, Nova Schola Gregoriana, Alberto Turco\n\nBrilliant Classics 96823 (2 CDs)\n\nRelease: 1 March 2023\n\nChoro et Organo by Bernardino Bottazzi (1560-1614) may be considered the most extensive and best-known collection of Italian organ works from the early seventeenth century. In the beautiful edition printed by Giacomo Vincenti, the musical notation used relates to a tradition that is more Renaissance than early baroque: namely, Italian tablature for organ (in this case, with an eight-line stave for the left hand and one of five lines for the right).\n\nThere are 22 hymns in Choro et Organo. For some of these, Bottazzi's organ verset is identical, for example Christe Redemptor omnium, whose melody is the same as that sung for the feast of All Saints although with a slightly different text. We know for certain that vocal forces and organ followed a pattern of alternation which, in Bottazzi's case, seems fully in line with the practices as evidenced by analogous works from the same period: 5 versets for the Kyrie, 9 for the Gloria, 2 for the Sanctus and just 1 for the Agnus Dei, given that - according to Adriano Banchieri (1608) - the last of the three Agnus Dei would be replaced by an organ composition, generally a canzona. It is possible that a collection of canzonas, as well as a number of Magnificats and ricercars, might have formed the basis of a hypothetical second book of Choro et Organo, given that the title on the frontispiece incorporates the standard term of 'Libro Primo'. Regrettably, we have no information, either on such a follow-up publication, nor indeed about Bottazzi's own life, other than his self-description as coming from Ferrara (which may only have been a city he resided in or where he took his religious vows rather than where he was actually born). Before each of the organ versets, the beautiful edition of Choro et Organo always presents the melody in cantus firmus, written on a five-line stave. In his introductory text ('To the gentle reader'), Bottazzi states that he 'was resolved to have this part of the cantus firmus printed' so as to circumvent the organist from playing the verset in question at such a pitch as to impede the choir from singing their own melodic part well ('[...] if the cantus firmus is at one pitch, & the Organist plays it at another, it is impossible for the Chorister to find the correct note'). This unusual feature has allowed the cantus firmus part to be reconstructed with historical accuracy and for it to be sung according to the performance style that emerges from the vast instructional literature on cantus firmus that was produced in Italy during the seventeenth century.\n\nNardini: Complete Music for 2 Violins\n\nIgor Ruhadze Baroque, violin; Ensemble Violini Capricciosi\n\nBrilliant Classics 96873 (3 CDs)\n\nRelease: 1 March 2023\n\nA feast of first recordings to celebrate the art of one of the greatest violinist-composers in eighteenth-century Europe. 'I have heard a certain Nardini, Leopold Mozart once wrote, 'and regarding beauty, purity, and equality of tone and in the singing taste nothing more beautiful can be heard.' The inveterate traveller and collector of culture Charles Burney was no less certain in his judgment of Nardini: 'he seems the completest player on the violin in all Italy; and, according to my feelings and judgment, his style is delicate, judicious, and highly finished.' We may judge for ourselves through the medium of his works, presented here in superbly stylish new recordings by a Dutch- based period ensemble with a track record of success in reviving lesser- known names from the golden age of the Baroque violin. Modern luminaries of the violin including Grumiaux, Milstein and Ricci used to perform Nardini's 'Sonata in D', and modern-Baroque virtuosos such as Giovanni Guglielmo and Giuseppe Carmignola have recorded his ornately wrought concertos, but this is the most comprehensive collection ever made of the composer's chamber-music output. To begin with, there are the Six Sonatas for two German Flutes or two Violins and a Bass, published in London in 1768. The Six duos pour deux violons, published in Paris around 1765, are very similar to the trio sonatas, but they feature typical violin idioms such as double stops and the use of lower notes than the flute would allow. The third of them brings a lively sequence of bird and animal sounds, from the cuckoo to the frog. The 14 New Italian Minuets for two Violins and a Bass, published in London around 1760, are short, unpretentious pieces, but skilfully composed and a joy to listen to.\n\nYann Tiersen: Island\n\nJeroen van Veen, piano\n\nBrilliant Classics 96913\n\nRelease: 1 March 2023\n\nThe music of Yann Tiersen (born 1970) traverses genres from French folk music and chanson to minimal, avant-garde and post-rock. The French composer and multi-instrumentalist is primarily known for writing the music for the film Amélie. In 2016 he made the album EUSA, then in 2021, he ventured a step further towards electronic music with his new album Kerber (2021). The latter is a beautifully structured, immersive and thoughtfully constructed electronic world, composed on the island of Ushant where Tiersen now resides. The title of each track on these two albums refers to a specific place on Ushant. Kerber, for example, is named after a chapel in a small village on the island. Some offer the perfect soundtrack for contemplation on a long walk or staring out of a window on a train journey. Others seem predestined to be background music for study or relaxation. With each song, your imagination can easily conjure a scene from a movie: a breakup after a fight in a cosy café or a nature documentary showing two baby birds opening their eyes for the very first time. After a frightening experience with a mountain lion in California, Tiersen came to a realisation. He needed to discover himself more intimately, and to do that, he needed to better know his home, Ushant. In order to understand his home and discover himself, he decided to draw a musical map of the island, of which EUSA is volume one; it contains ten piano works about ten places on Ushant. 'I think there is a similarity between the infinite big and the infinite smallness of everything,' explains Yann Tiersen. 'It's the same experiment looking through a microscope as it is a telescope.' This exploration of the micro and the macro has permeated much of Tiersen's career, and Kerber once again shows the vast expansiveness and intricate detail of his work. This isn't a collection about isolation; it is more an expression of being conscious of your immediate environment, and your place within it. For Tiersen, this approach extracts the same degree of profundity as spending the evening studying the stars - which he himself does. 'You can look at things that are thousands of light years away and relate your own existence to this really cosmic element,' he says. 'But you get that same feeling with the things all around you.' 'A leading exponent of minimalism today' (Fanfare). Pianist Jeroen van Veen has selected to perform the principle 17 works from these two of Tiersen's albums for his own Island album. 'The result here is a fresh and rather naked version of Eusa and Kerber that I will play in public quite a bit,' Van Veen relates, 'especially for my lie-down concerts, and the music makes a nice addition to my other existing programmes. In these works you can hear the emptiness of the island; although I've never been to Ushant, I can imagine the beauty of nature and the music ebbing and flowing like the ocean's tide, low and high, day in, day out.'\n\nGlinka Revisited\n\nViacheslav Shelepov, piano\n\nPiano Classics PCL10258\n\nRelease: 1 March 2023\n\nVariations and salon miniatures by the father of the classical tradition in Russia. Mikhail Glinka's piano works lie in the shadow of his operas, romances and orchestral music but they share the distinctive voice, the brilliance and Franco- Russian accent of foundational pieces in the Russian classical tradition such as Ruslan and Ludmila. The works recorded here date from the 1820s to the 1840s, when there was no regular concert life or musical education in Russia and when the salon and the opera still formed the centres of musical life. Glinka models his keyboard writing accordingly on the forms immortalised by Chopin such as the waltz, nocturne and mazurka, and the variations on songs, popular Italian opera melodies. Viacheslav Shelepov opens this beautifully curated album with a delicious set of\n\nvariations on Alyabyev's song The Nightingale, cast in a nostalgic E minor. The tiny, three-minute variations on Amid the Plain Valley (a Russian song) are entirely within the salon format, and the Variations on a Scottish Song have a Mendelssohnian delicacy of texture, but the closing variations on a theme from Bellini's I Capuleti e I Montecchi are evidently conceived with the concert stage in mind, and with the fingers of a virtuoso to embrace their exuberant writing. Viacheslav Shelepov intersperses these variations with one-off demonstrations of Glinka's mastery in whatever form he chose to address himself. The G major Barcarolle from 1847 deserves to take its place alongside much more familiar examples by Chopin and Mendelssohn for its memorable distillation of poetry and the tug of the gondolier's oars in its rhythm. A D major Fugue works up a relatively sober theme to a satisfying climax out of proportion to its three-minute duration. Also from 1847, the Prayer is much more dramatic and eventful than its title would suggest, especially in this dynamically shaded account by Viacheslav Shelepov. Born in 1991, Shelepov studied at the Moscow Tchaikovsky Conservatoire and the Hochschule für Musik in Hannover, while winning prizes at several renowned piano competitions across Europe. He brings to these performances a keen awareness of period practice in the lightness of his touch, while also playing with the rhythmic freedom which Romantic composers such as Glinka, Chopin and Schumann wove into the fabric of their piano music.\n\nMedtner: Piano Sonatas Op 25 Nos 1 & 2; Six Fairy Tales Op 51\n\nDina Parakhina, piano\n\nPiano Classics PCL10266\n\nRelease: 1 March 2023\n\nThe two sonatas published by Medtner as his Opus 25 make a salutary contrast: the longest and most taxing of his sonatas placed alongside a sonatina-like work possibly intended for children. Apart from showing the range of the composer's imagination and his capacity to build musical structures that show the most careful craftsmanship, these two sonatas reveal a view of the world that is very Medtnerian: a pairing of something childlike with the heroic and terrifying. 'In Medtner you find the whole complexity of life,' says Dina Parakhina. 'He built his spiritual cathedrals out of chaos.' Op 25 No 1 is known as the 'Fairy Tale' Sonata, and its four concise movements really do sound as if they deal with fairies, giants, witches and goblins. The Six Fairy Tales Op 51 further illuminate this side of Medtner's musical personality. Dina Parakhina hears a Russian figure of the Fool in No 2, and Cinderella in the balletic turns of No 3, 'the most lyrical, elegant and feminine in style' and perhaps a portrait of his wife. Medtner prefaced the mighty Op 25 No 2 Sonata with a poem by Fyodor Tyutchev: 'Night wind, night wind, why do you howl?' Longer than half an hour, this single movement invites comparison with the B minor Sonata of Liszt and the final sonata of Beethoven as a summit of late-Romantic piano literature, which absorbs tempests and idylls within his personal synthesis of German, contrapuntal rigour and Russian lyricism. The Russian-born pianist Dina Parakhina has Medtner's music in her blood and under her fingers, as a student at the Moscow Tchaikovsky Conservatoire at the top of a class which included Mikhail Pletnev. She became a professor of piano there before moving to the UK, where she teaches at the Royal College of Music and Royal Northern College, as well as performing around the country.\n\nPärt: Lamentate\n\nPedro Piquero, piano; Orquesta de Extremadura / Álvaro Albiach\n\nPiano Classics PCL10273\n\nRelease: 1 March 2023\n\nTaking his initial inspiration from Marsyas, a massive sculpture created by Anish Kapoor in 2002 for the Turbine Hall in Tate Modern in London, the Estonian composer Arvo Pärt conceived Lamentate as a lament not for the dead but for the living, 'who have to deal with these issues for themselves' - something of a spiritual sequel to Brahms's German Requiem. The soundworld of the piece, however, as a forty-minute concertante work for piano and large orchestra, could hardly be more different from Brahms, dealing in characteristically polar opposites between 'brutal-overwhelming' and 'intimate-fragile', in the composer's terminology. Swiftness and calm, light and dark, time and timelessness are fused in a vast organic score of ten continuous movements pointing to the ineffability of death and suffering. The two short companion pieces distil that feeling for intimacy and fragility which the composer has made his own for six decades and more in the 'tintinabulation' style which has proved so influential on subsequent generations looking to compose distinctively modern music with spiritual content and meaning. Psalom is an instrumental setting of Psalm 112, as a summons to praise God, to place hope in Him and to find redemption for suffering in the intercession of God. The Cantus written in memory of Benjamin Britten remains one of Part's most haunting and perfect works, almost half a century on from its composition: a modern classic of music's special capacity to absorb and transform and then transcend grief. The pianist Pedro Piquero studied in his home country of Spain and then the US. He has pursued a dual career of pianist and translator, producing definitive editions of foundational texts of Zen Buddhism and in 2017 becoming a Buddhist monk. This search for spiritual wisdom and transcendence makes him a performer of rare insight when addressing the music of Pärt, and his essay for this album concludes by offering it as 'a release from affliction through the truth pointed to by the composer's generous and compassionate craft.'\n\n24 FEBRUARY 2023\n\nBACH\n\nBarnaby Smith, alto\n\nVOCES8 VCM152\n\nRelease: 24 February 2023\n\nReturning to the studio to record a collection of Bach's greatest music for alto, the VOCES8\n\nartistic director's latest release follows his debut solo album, HANDEL. 'Bach has been a central figure in my personal musical journey', says Smith. 'He is my greatest love as a musician, not only because of the repertoire, but his importance for the modern-day countertenor voice within that repertoire.' Smith's programme reflects the annual cycle of the church year ('a cycle from the candlemas to the cross, and on to the Resurrection', he says). Featuring two iconic solo cantatas, Ich habe genug, BWV 82 and Vergnügte Ruh, BWV 170, the recital is interwoven with arias from Bach's great oratorios. 'From a singer's perspective, Bach is a gift but it's also the hardest thing you'll ever do', says Smith. 'When you're singing, you feel totally subservient to the music. His genius feels truly beyond anything you can comprehend. The way he writes for the voice, the gestures within the music, and the opportunities he gives you as a singer are incredibly liberating. There is so much that you can bring to it as an orator, and that is an absolute gift.' The countertenor explains that his former teacher Andreas Scholl was a motivating factor in his decision to record again as a soloist, noting: 'Hearing him sing Bach was the apex of my early experience, and being able to do it myself has always been a dream.' As with his HANDEL album, for BACH Smith is reunited with some of the UK's finest early music performers, including Leo Duarte (obligato oboe), Steven Devine (organ) and Joe Crouch (cello), flying under the banner of leader Bojan Čičić's Illyria Consort. The album also features a duet with fellow VOCES8 alto Katie Jeffries-Harris. For the recording, Smith uses Bach's fourth and final transcription on Ich habe genug, which includes the rare and poignant sound of the oboe da caccia.\n\nThere are Things to be Said\n\nTailleferre Ensemble debut album\n\nFirst recordings of Tailleferre, Sonate champêtre and Rhian Samuel, Little Duos for Oboe and Cor Anglais; works by Ingrid Stölzel, Bill Douglas, Cecilia McDowell, Jenni Brandon, Melchior Hoffmann and Julius Röntgen.\n\nUlysses Arts: UA220060\n\nRelease: 24 February 2023\n\nThe Tailleferre Ensemble, founded in 2019 by Nicola Hands and Penelope Smith, is a UK-based chamber collective whose principal aim is to promote women in music. The group is a flexible chamber ensemble of varying line-up who perform works of diverse instrumentation and genre, from works by established composers to those that are lesser-known and contemporary. As a group they have been praised for their fine performances and 'extensive palette of timbres', and they work to redress the balance of works performed by men and women composers in classical music. The Ensemble has performed across the country since its inception, ranging from prestigious venues and chamber music festivals to local chamber series, and have also collaborated with other groups. In 2021 they were grateful to receive funding from the Ambache Charitable Trust to make recordings of works by Cecilia McDowall and Rhian Samuel. In 2022 they were invited to perform for a production of the under-played Mass in D by Ethel Smyth. Since then, they received further invitations to collaborate on similar performances.\n\nOurselves, as we are\n\nCarlos Cipa\n\nWarner Classics\n\nRelease: 24 February 2023\n\nIn recent years, many of us have had more time to get to know ourselves. It is this process of coming to terms with our innermost selves that Carlos Cipa celebrates with his new album. Ourselves, as we are is made up of nine short piano pieces, created in just a few weeks, described by Cipa as a 'conscious introspection', a 'zooming in on the object of contemplation, and in this case oneself'. Cipa took another decisive conceptual approach when writing this album - to play as quietly as possible. The fascinating result provides a new piano sound world, almost devoid of percussive elements.\n\nLes heures claires - The complete songs - Nadia & Lili Boulanger\n\nLucile Richardot, Anne de Fornel\n\nharmonia mundi HMM902356.58 (3 CDs)\n\nRelease: 24 February 2023\n\nNadia and Lili Boulanger, each in her own way, made a lasting impact on the musical world of the twentieth century. Sometimes luminous and full of hope, sometimes more sombre, all their works testify to a poignant humanity. Going beyond the mélodies, Lucile Richardot, Anne de Fornel and the other artists assembled for this edition offer a multi-faceted portrait of the two composers, a form of musical narrative containing pieces that have never been published or recorded before.\n\nListen\n\nJung Jaeil\n\nDecca Records\n\nRelease: 24 February 2023\n\nJung Jaeil, the composer of Netflix's Squid Game and the film Parasite, announces his next album on Decca Records. Listen is an intimate piano-based album featuring warm cinematic strings and inspired by nature, humanity, and the need to listen to the planet and one another.\n\nEdward German: Symphony No 2 'Norwich'; Valse Gracieuse; Welsh Rhapsody\n\nNational Symphony Orchestra of Ireland / Andrew Penny\n\nNaxos 8.555228\n\nRelease: 24 February 2023\n\nArthur Sullivan called Edward German 'the one man to follow me who has genius'. Notwithstanding German's success in operetta, especially with Tom Jones (recorded on 8.660270-71) and Merrie England (the suite is on 8.555171), orchestral music was always central to his life. Stylistic affiliations with French and Russian music - not that common in British music of the time - are often evident. German, like Elgar, was a stylistic cosmopolitan whose music is, paradoxically, quintessentially English, and the 'Norwich' is indeed an outstanding late nineteenth century British symphony. German gave us another superb symphony too, albeit in miniature, with his Welsh Rhapsody, a brilliant orchestral showpiece that remains his most performed extended orchestral work.\n\nKevin Puts: The City; Marimba Concerto; Moonlight\n\nKatherine Needleman, oboe; Ji Su Jung, marimba; Baltimore Symphony Orchestra / Marin Alsop\n\nNaxos 8.559926\n\nRelease: 24 February 2023\n\n'This collection of recordings is especially meaningful for me because it charts my growth as an orchestral composer from my years as a student - when the Marimba Concerto was composed - to more mature work such as Moonlight. It also reflects the wonderful relationship I have enjoyed over the years with the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra and Marin Alsop. The Marimba Concerto, which reflects my love of Mozart's piano concertos, also represents my most direct and unguarded voice as a composer. The City was originally intended as a portrait of the city of Baltimore and more generally of the American city, but the death of Freddy Gray while in police custody and the subsequent unrest in Baltimore sent me in an unexpected direction with the piece.' - Kevin Puts\n\nAnton Rubinstein: Preludes and Études\n\nMartin Cousin, piano\n\nNaxos 8.574426\n\nRelease: 24 February 2023\n\nAnton Rubinstein was one of the greatest pianists of his age - a virtuoso the equal of Liszt and a popular composer whose career took him all over the world. Despite his invaluable contributions to Russian music, his legacy proved controversial with later generations. Today we can appreciate Rubinstein's very real achievement as a gifted and original composer whose works are notable for their melodic memorability and extraordinary variety of textures. These Preludes and Études bear powerful witness to this composer's technical ability and command of tone colour, forming a comprehensive survey of Rubinstein's piano technique and creative prowess.\n\nPaul Wranitzky: Orchestral Works, Vol 5 - Das listige Bauernmädchen (Ballet); Vorstellungen; Quodlibet: Contradance\n\nCzech Chamber Philharmonic Orchestra Pardubice / Marek Štilec\n\nNaxos 8.574399\n\nRelease: 24 February 2023\n\nAs an influential figure in Viennese circles that included Mozart and Haydn, Paul Wranitzky was often called upon to take on commissions from the Imperial Court and the Empress Marie Therese in particular. Das listige Bauernmädchen, a ballet from her collection, reflects its rustic setting and story of romantic intrigues with folk-dance energy and delightful pantomime. The dramatic ballet divertissement Vorstellungen was part of Emperor Franz II's birthday celebrations in 1803, as was an extensive Quodlibet from which we have selected the colourful Final Contradance.\n\nUnicum - New Songs from the Leuven Chansonnier\n\nEnsemble Leones, Marc Lewon\n\nNaxos 8.574395\n\nRelease: 24 February 2023\n\nThe discovery in 2015 of a fifteenth-century parchment chansonnier still in its original binding was made still more startling because it contained twelve previously unknown, anonymous chansons. Most are rondeaus, and they range from the uncomplicated to the refined and elaborate; many bear musical indications that they are the work of the greatest composers of the period. In this recording they have been contextualised with other known songs but in the variant versions found in Leuven. As on their recording of the Chansonnier Cordiforme, Ensemble Leones employs a range of performance possibilities, from a cappella ensemble to a mixture of instruments and voices.\n\nRaízes - Portuguese Chamber Music\n\nSérgio Azevedo, Eurico Carrapatoso, Fernando C Lapa, Telmo Marques\n\nMatosinhos String Quartet\n\nNaxos 8.579114\n\nRelease: 24 February 2023\n\nRaízes (Portuguese for 'roots') features new works commissioned by the Matosinhos String Quartet, in which composers were invited to write works inspired by melodies, dances and stories from Portuguese traditional folklore. Returning to their heritage in North Portugal, Eurico Carrapatoso and Fernando C Lapa both draw inspiration from Mirandese landscapes, dances and melodies. Telmo Marques' Ilhas Afortunadas alludes to the mythologies surrounding the islands of the Azores and Madeira, and Sérgio Azevedo pays homage to Fernando Lopes-Graça and Béla Bartók's pioneering work recording folk music in the field with his Popularuskia I.\n\nKjetil Husebø: Years of Ambiguity\n\nKjetil Husebø, Eivind Aarset, Arve Henriksen\n\nNXN Recordings NXN4007\n\nRelease: 24 February 2023\n\nOn the album Years of Ambiguity, experienced composer and jazz artist Kjetil Husebø has created music at the crossroads between ambient, drone and jazz. The grand piano has been replaced with synthesizers, samplers, electronics and programming. Internationally renowned musicians Arve Henriksen (trumpet) and Eivind Aarset (guitar) collaborates with him on several of the tracks. The moods on the album is cinematic and full of contrasts, alternating between being minimalistic and maximalist, sometimes light, sometimes dark. Musically oriented towards huge sonical landscapes, abstract sounds but also with a sense for melody.\n\n17 FEBRUARY 2023\n\nMozart: Piano Concertos Vol 7\n\nJean-Efflam Bavouzet, Manchester Camerata / Gábor Takács-Nagy\n\nChandos CHAN 20192\n\nRelease: 17 February 2023\n\nVolume 7 of Jean-Efflam Bavouzet's Mozart piano concertos survey with Gábor Takács-Nagy and the Manchester Camerata features two of the late concertos - Nos 24 and 25 - along with a spirited reading of the Overture to Le nozze di Figaro (The Marriage of Figaro). Concerto No 24 was written whilst Mozart was busily composing Le nozze di Figaro, between October 1785 and the première, in Vienna, in May 1786. One of only two piano concertos in a minor key, this extraordinary work possesses many unusual features, including the deliberately ambivalent tonality of the opening melody, which uses all twelve tones of the scale (a pre-echo of serialism??!). Concerto No 25 was probably first performed, in Vienna, in December 1786, and was certainly a success as there were many repeat performances in the following years (probably including one by Beethoven, in 1795). The disc was recorded in Manchester's Stoller Hall, Bavouzet playing a Yamaha CFX nine-foot Concert Grand Piano.\n\nBefreit: A Soul Surrendered\n\nKitty Whately, mezzo-soprano; Joseph Middleton, piano\n\nChandos CHAN 20177\n\nRelease: 17 February 2023\n\nThe mezzo-soprano Kitty Whately trained at Chetham's School of Music, the Guildhall School of Music and Drama, and the International Opera School of the Royal College of Music. Having won both the Kathleen Ferrier Award and Royal Overseas League Award in the same year, she attended the prestigious Academy of the Verbier Festival. She writes of this project: 'It has been my great pleasure to record with Joseph once again. We have long shared a mutual passion for early-twentieth-century romantic Lieder and talked of making a disc including songs by Mahler and Strauss. The opportunity to discover and research lesser-known composers from their era has been thrilling and fascinating. As the world endured the pandemic, we all experienced fear and danger and loss in a way that most of our generation never did before, on such a global scale. Joseph and I felt drawn to reflect on grief, mortality, and bereavement.' The two lesser-known composers featured in the recording are Johanna Müller-Hermann (who studied with several of the most prominent teachers in Vienna - Josef Labor, Guido Adler, Alexander Zemlinsky, Josef Bohuslav Foerster, Franz Schmidt) and Margarete Schweikert, whose upbringing and life in Karlsruhe and studies with Joseph Haas in Stuttgart could hardly provide a greater contrast - clearly audible in their music.\n\nThe Swan of Salen\n\nThe Willow Trio\n\nSelf-released\n\nRelease: 17 February 2023\n\nIn a marriage of classical and Gaelic culture, this fifteen-track recording weaves a compelling narrative based on the heartbreaking tragedy of Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake and of the parallel Gaelic legend, Eala Shàilein. The body of work also forms a musical backdrop to the cultural project of the same name, created by The Willow Trio and production company Ballet Folk. The Swan of Salen Project is a multimedia adaptation of Swan Lake, taking Gaelic and traditional influences from stories and songs from the Loch Sunart area.\n\nPassacalle de la Follie\n\nPhilippe Jaroussky, Christina Pluhar, L'Arpeggiata\n\nErato 5054197221873\n\nRelease: 17 February 2023\n\nOn this release, Christina Pluhar performs alongside star countertenor Philippe Jaroussky and her ensemble L'Arpeggiata. This recording shines a spotlight on chamber music composed for the French court at the turn of the seventeenth century: a subtle and refined art form, performed in the salons of the era and accompanying a topic that dominated courtly society at the time: love. The French court and aristocratic salons witnessed an extraordinary artistic boom during this period, leading to the development of the air de cour in vocal music. Pluhar, who is known for her creative musical curation, presents a programme of French baroque music on this album, featuring works by Robert de Visée, Antoine Boesset, Etienne Mouliné, Michel Lambert, and many more.\n\nCelebrating Offenbach - Robinson Crusoe; Vert-Vert; Entre Nous\n\nOpera Rara ORB3 (7 CDs)\n\nRelease: 17 February 2023\n\nAlthough he wrote over a hundred operas during his extraordinary career, only a fraction of Offenbach's output is regularly performed today. This boxset provides an introduction to more than twenty of the composer's lesser-known works, including the complete studio recordings of Vert-Vert and Robinson Crusoe, as well as a selection from some of his finest works, all performed by an impressive group of international stars including Jennifer Larmore, Toby Spence, Loic Félix and Laura Claycomb. Remastered to the best audio quality and featuring a specially commissioned essay by specialist Marco Ladd, these recordings will enchant Offenbach fans with their subtle charm and witty humour.\n\nHeinrich Ignaz Franz Biber: Mystery (Rosary) Sonatas\n\nGli incogniti, Amandine Beyer\n\nharmonia mundi HMM902712.13 (2 CDs)\n\nRelease: 17 February 2023\n\nWhether we call them 'Mystery' or 'Rosary' Sonatas, these fifteen pieces crowned by a sublime passacaglia for unaccompanied violin form one of the greatest violinistic masterpieces of the Baroque repertory. This version by Amandine Beyer and Gli Incogniti, derived from a dance project with the Rosas company, leads us into their magical universe through a novel prism: that of movement, to which these pieces are an infinite ode.\n\nVisions Illuminées\n\nMary Bevan, 12 Ensemble, Ruisi Quartet and Joseph Middleton\n\nSignum Classics SIGCD735\n\nRelease: 17 February 2023\n\nFor her third recital album on Signum, critically acclaimed soprano Mary Bevan returns for a selection of French songs by composers including Ravel, Debussy and Fauré. This multifaceted programme brings pieces composed or adapted for voice and chamber ensemble, always with strings but often with other instruments too. Mary Bevan is a consummate musician whose engagements for the 2022/23 opera season include the Royal Opera, Philharmonie de Paris, Teatro la Fenice and debut performances with the Bayerische Staatsoper and at Zurich Opera.\n\nVerdi Choruses\n\nRiccardo Chailly\n\nDecca Classics\n\nRelease: 17 February 2023\n\nOn February 20, 2023, Riccardo Chailly celebrates his 70th birthday shortly after his latest release, Verdi Choruses. Recorded in Dolby Atmos in the auditorium of Teatro all Scala, the album includes the classic 'Chorus of the Hebrew Slaves' ('Va, pensiero' from Nabucco) as well as the Triumphal Chorus, March and Ballet from Aida and highlights from another 7 Verdi operas.\n\nAfter the Chaos\n\nYaffle\n\nDeutsche Grammophon (digital only)\n\nRelease: 17 February 2023\n\nProducer, trackmaker, and sought-out composer Yaffle announces his new post-classical project titled After The Chaos. Recorded in Iceland, the album is a genre-bending work that reflects the musical journey of Yaffle, whose love of music spans from Radiohead and Sigur Rós to Elgar and Vaughan Williams.\n\nMascagni: L'amico Fritz\n\nSalome Jicia, Charles Castronovo, Teresa Iervolino, Massimo Cavalletti, Dave Monaco, Francesco Samuele Venuti, Caterina Meldolesi, Daria Dmitrieva, Elena Barsotti, Maria Lucia Bianchi, Sara Silli, Giacomo Casali, Leonardo Cirri, Giampaolo Gobbi, Emanuele Marchetti, Domenico Nuovo, Francesco Pacelli, Orchestra e Coro del Maggio Musicale Fiorentino, Rosetta Cucchi (director), Riccardo Frizza\n\nDynamic Records CDS7960 (2 CDs)\n\nRelease: 17 February 2023\n\nBuilding on the success of Cavalleria rusticana, Pietro Mascagni's commedia lirica L'amico Fritz was given seven encores and thirty-five curtain calls at its premiere in Rome in 1891. Considered by critics to be one of Mascagni's best operas, the story is that of a love triangle involving the wealthy Fritz Kobus and Suzel, daughter of one of his tenants, who together sing the famous 'Cherry Duet' in Act II. Returning to the Teatro del Maggio Musicale in Florence for the first time since 1941, this production was acclaimed for its superb cast and astonishingly effective modern setting.

His Cello Concerto was premiered in London in 1896 - its symphonic character and wonderful melodic invention made the concerto one of his most beloved and frequently performed works. The Rondo, Op 94 owes its Slavic nature to the popular melody on which it is based, while the enchanting Silent Woods and soulful Laßt mich allein! are both arrangements from previous works. The pieces on this album are performed by the award-winning cellist Enrico Dindo - praised by Rostropovich for an extraordinary sound that 'flows as a splendid Italian voice'.\n\nMauro D'Alay: The Dresden Concertos for Violin, Strings and Organ; Concerto 'for Anna Maria'\n\nDaniele Fanfoni, Luca Fanfoni, Reale Concerto\n\nDynamic Records CDS7982\n\nRelease: 17 February 2023\n\nMauro D'Alay was a native of Parma. His fame as a violinist and composer took him all over Europe, and he was employed for many years at the prestigious court of Philip V of Spain. As with the Concertos, Op 1 (Dynamic CDS7892.02) these recordings include world premieres from manuscripts mostly found in the Dresden Sächsische Landesbibliothek. These concertos are formally based on models by Vivaldi, but D'Alay's style is freer, at times incorporating a more 'modern' galant fashion in discoveries such as the beautiful and unique Concerto in D minor, and in pieces dedicated to the famous Venetian violinist, 'Maestra' Anna Maria della Pietà.\n\n10 FEBRUARY 2023\n\nBach Aria Soloists: La Dolce Sirene\n\nReference Recordings FR-750\n\nRelease: 10 February 2023\n\nReference Recordings is proud to present a very special new release! Entitled Le Dolce Sirene to represent the dynamic all-­women force of Bach Aria Soloists, this exciting new album includes works by Monteverdi, Handel, Mendelssohn and Bach, alongside a new transcription by Bach Aria Soloists of Cecilia McDowall's song cycle Four Shakespeare Songs.\n\nWhat Is Sarah Neutkens Thinking?\n\nUMG Netherlands 0028948580996 (digital only)\n\nRelease: 10 February 2023\n\nSarah Neutkens is a composer, pianist, visual artist, model, art historian and author. Her upcoming double album 'What Is Sarah Neutkens Thinking?' features pieces she composed and performed on piano along with compositions for string quartet. Neutkens uses an interdisciplinary creative approach to show that composing, regardless of form or style, knows no limits, as long as the intention is to fully express oneself in an authentic way.\n\nLe concert des oiseaux & Le Carnaval des animaux en péril\n\nLa Rêveuse, Florence Bolton & Benjamin Perrot\n\nharmonia mundi HMM902709\n\nRelease: 10 February 2023\n\nWhile paying glittering homage to the animal kingdom, this programme also takes us on a journey through the centuries: the existing pieces freely inspired by birdsong, from Couperin to Ravel, are mirrored by an astonishing 'Carnival of Animals in Peril'. Its composer, Vincent Bouchot, reminds us of the disappearance of certain species of animals - and of certain musical instruments that very nearly became extinct too.\n\nVaughan Williams and Grieg: Violin Sonatas\n\nCharlie Siem, violin; Itamar Golan, piano\n\nSignum Classics SIGCD734\n\nRelease: 10 February 2023\n\nFor his third album on Signum, internationally acclaimed violinist Charlie Siem is joined by celebrated pianist Itamar Golan for their second recital album. This release comprises sonatas by Vaughan Williams and Grieg, including a transcription of Grieg's 'Solveig's Song' by Siem himself.\n\nLovesick\n\nRandall Scotting, countertenor; Stephen Stubbs, lute\n\nSignum Classics SIGCD736\n\nRelease: 10 February 2023\n\nFor his second Signum album, countertenor Randall Scotting is joined by lutenist Stephen Stubbs for a selection of 'anti-Valentine's' songs from the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries depicting heartbreak and love-loss. Based in the US but with an increasing presence in Europe, Scotting is a musician on the rise. With a string of albums set for release on Signum, the research behind the repertoire coupled with Scotting's striking appearance distinguish him from the countertenor mould.\n\nFrank Martin: Messe pour double chœur; Maurice Duruflé: Requiem\n\nMaîtrise de Toulouse / Mark Opstad\n\nRegent Records REGCD557\n\nRelease: 10 February 2023\n\nThe choir is made up of soprano and alto choristers with other singers from the Conservatoire de Toulouse. These wonderfully-talented young singers are educated and musically trained at the Conservatoire based on the English Choir Schools model and they are expertly directed by British-born and educated director, Mark Opstad.\n\nSimon Mold: Passiontide - A Lenten Cantata\n\nStephen Cooper, baritone; Philip Leech, tenor; Helen Bailey, soprano; Jeremy Leaman, bass-baritone; David Cowen, organ; The Knighton Consort / Roxanne Gull\n\nDivine Art DDA 25238\n\nRelease: 10 February 2023\n\nScenes from the Gospels' account of the Passion of Christ, with reflective meditations. Drawing deeply on the traditions of Baroque Passion settings as well as such works as Stainer's 'The Crucifixion' and Maunder's 'Olivet to Calvary', Simon Mold's 'Passiontide' is a masterpiece. It's a strikingly accessible work that explores a range of emotions with a sure feel for word-setting and an irrepressible tunefulness, while nonetheless capable of many passages of gravitas, poignancy and lingering beauty. Highlights include dramatic moments in the Garden of Gethsemane and before Pilate, a searching setting of the Reproaches for choir and soloist, the heart-rending farewell duet for Mary and Jesus and a final scene that taps into the feelings of believer and non-believer alike.\n\nPerpetuum\n\nAnthony Romaniuk\n\nAlpha Classics ALPHA913\n\nRelease: 10 February 2023\n\nMusical polyglot Anthony Romaniuk explores perpetual motion on six different types of modern and ancient keyboard instruments. Anthony Romaniuk recorded music from a large range of composers such as John Adams, Erik Satie, György Ligeti, Johann Sebastian Bach, Ludwig van Beethoven, Robert Schumann, Franz Schubert and two improvisations. For diversity of timbre and texture, Anthony Romaniuk chose to use a Fazioli F228 Concert Grand, a Graf fortepiano (1835), a seventeenth-century French harpsichord, a 'Muselaar', a Yamaha CP80 electro-acoustic piano and a Prophet Rev 2 synth. Each instrument has a repertoire to which it is naturally suited but sometimes he tries to invert these relationships, often with surprising results. 'Perpetual motion in music has a timeless quality. It is both a strong part of today's musical culture (anything with a repetitive beat), but also part of ancient musical traditions, particularly within a ritualistic or sacred context. I find this an interesting duality - music existing in the present yet with a foot in the past.' - Anthony Romaniuk\n\nLucian Kano Balmer: Spruce Ritual - The Way the Evening Speaks\n\nLucian Kano Balmer, violin, vocals; Nils Bultmann, viola; Hannah Addario-Berry, cello; Joanna Mack, sitar; Josh Mellinger, tabla, tabla taranga; Jim Santi Owen, tabla taranga\n\nAnsonica Records AR0019\n\nRelease: 10 February 2023\n\nSpruce Ritual from Bay Area violinist, vocalist, and composer Lucian Balmer is a heartfelt dance between western classical and North Indian classical music. While the album is centered around violin, viola, and cello—the string instrument family at the heart of Romantic era chamber music—Balmer seamlessly integrates the sounds of the sitar and the tabla, two pillars of Indian classical music. While the recordings do not contain lyrics, the human voice is also a prominent instrument on this album. This is thanks to the use of sargam, in which the notes of the composition are sung. The music of Spruce Ritual is richly illustrative of Balmer's own life experiences, ranging from devotion, love, loss, melancholy, and excitement.\n\nBeethoven: Piano Concertos Nos 3 and 4\n\nBoris Giltburg, Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra / Vasily Petrenko\n\nNaxos 8.574152\n\nRelease: 10 February 2023\n\nFor nineteenth-century audiences Beethoven's Piano Concerto No 3 was the most loved of all his piano concertos, a work in which the balancing of high drama, tenderness, lyricism and humour is most pronounced and in which a coda resolves inner tensions with brilliance and triumphant grandeur. Piano Concerto No 4 is the most introspective and poetic of the concertos. The simplicity of its opening piano statement gives way to an unprecedented dialogue in the central movement between a heartfelt piano and an austere unison string orchestra, before the infectious energy of the dramatic finale.\n\nScriabin: The Poem of Ecstasy; Symphony No 2\n\nBuffalo Philharmonic Orchestra / JoAnn Falletta\n\nNaxos 8.574139\n\nRelease: 10 February 2023\n\nAlexander Scriabin composed most of his single-movement fourth symphony The Poem of Ecstasy between 1905 and 1908 in Italy and France. He originally intended it to be called Poème orgiaque ('Orgiastic Poem') with its unprecedented raw sensuality and overpowering aesthetic, taking chromaticism beyond even Wagnerian voluptuousness. His earlier Symphony No 2 in C minor adopts César Franck's cyclical ideas to which Scriabin layered sweeping climaxes, majestic intensity and rich orchestral colour that enliven its five movements with ceaseless invention.\n\nBrahms: Complete Songs, Vol 3\n\nAlina Wunderlin, soprano; Esther Valentin-Fieguth, mezzo-soprano; Kieran Carrel, tenor; Konstantin Ingenpaß, baritone; Ulrich Eisenlohr, fortepiano\n\nNaxos 8.574346\n\nRelease: 10 February 2023\n\nFor Johannes Brahms, folk songs were sources of musical inspiration, not subjects for academic study. The songs from Books 6 and 7 of the Deutsche Volkslieder exemplify how Brahms' distinctive and expressive accompaniments brought unique qualities to these songs, how he intensified certain verses to draw out their power, or allowed the piano its own revealing melodic phrases. In Book 7 the songs are divided between a lead singer and a chorus, adding fresh musical possibilities. In the Volkskinderlieder ('Children's Folk Songs') Brahms' economy and deftness turn lullabies into works of art.\n\nGeorg Philipp Telemann: Chamber Music for Bassoon and Guitar\n\nRainer Seidel, bassoon; Daniel Valentin Marx, guitar\n\nNaxos 8.551433\n\nRelease: 10 February 2023\n\nGeorg Philipp Telemann was the most famous of all German composers during his lifetime and a master of all musical genres. Every piece in this album dates from his triumphant years in Hamburg, where he was the city's music director. They are heard in exciting new arrangements reflecting Telemann's own practice in transcribing his works for various instruments. The two Sonatinas come from the collection Neue Sonatinen of 1730-31, a rich source of material, while the Fantasias derive from the Fantasias for viola da gamba, with much polyphonic writing cast in galant style.\n\nJustin Holland: Guitar Works and Arrangements - Carnival of Venice; Sweet Memories of Thee; Home Sweet Home; Pearls of Dew\n\nChristopher Mallett, guitar\n\nNaxos 8.559924\n\nRelease: 10 February 2023\n\nJustin Holland was an African American, born free in Norfolk, Virginia. He was the most influential and important American guitarist of the nineteenth century and wrote the first published and best-selling guitar method in the country. He was also a leading voice in the anti-slavery and civil rights movements. As a composer he synthesized European models and embraced popular, church and parlor songs generating a rich variety of works. A master of virtuosic variations, his arrangements are witty, elegant, and colorful, and culminate in Carnival of Venice, which shows the full range of his gifts, sweeping in breadth and dazzling in effect.\n\nIngi Bjarni: Farfuglar\n\nIngi Bjarni Skůlason, Jakob Eri Myhre, Merje Kägu, Daniel Andersson, Tore Ljøkelsøy\n\nNXN Recordings NXN2014\n\nRelease: 10 February 2023\n\nIngi Bjarni is a pianist and a true Nordic artist. Hailing from Iceland and traveling around the Nordics and Northern Europe to both perform and find new musicians with whom to appear, he has created a fine mix of musicians from different countries to complete his musical vision. His music is clearly inspired by jazz traditions, Nordic folk songs and electronica, while still retaining its own distinct sound. Farfuglar is a clear demonstration of that mix.\n\nJoseph Bologne, Chevalier De Saint-Georges: L'Amant Anonyme\n\nHaymarket Opera Company / Craig Trompeter\n\nCedille Records CDR90000217 (3 CDs)\n\nRelease: 10 February 2023\n\nHaymarket Opera, Chicago's premier early opera company that presents historically informed performances played on eighteenth-century classical era instruments, performs on this world-premiere recording of L'Amant Anonyme (The Anonymous Lover) by Joseph Bologne, Chevalier de Saint-Georges (1745-1799). Premiered in 1780, L'Amant Anonyme was the most successful of Bologne's six operas and is the only one to survive to the present day. Based on a play by the composer's patroness Félicité de Genlis, who was a respected writer of the era, the work is an opéra comique in two acts composed in the then-popular style that mixed sung parts with spoken dialogue. The stellar cast is headlined by 2005 BBC Cardiff Singer of the World soprano Nicole Cabell in the lead role of Léontine, opposite Chicago-native tenor Geoffrey Agpalo as her secret admirer Valcour. The cast also includes David Govertsen (Ophémon), Erica Schuller (Jeannette), Michael St. Peter (Colin), and Nathalie Colas (Dorothée). Company founder and artistic director Craig Trompeter leads the performance, conducting a nineteen-member contingent of the period-instrument Haymarket Opera Orchestra.\n\nMartha Argerich Live, Vol 12\n\nChopin, Schumann, Liszt, Toronto Recital 1978\n\nDoremi DHR-81934 (2 CDs)\n\nRelease: 10 February 2023\n\nOver twenty years ago, Alex Ross, the noted music critic for the New Yorker, described the atmosphere of a Martha Argerich recital in terms reminiscent of the golden age of nineteenth century piano virtuosos: 'Her concerts conjure up scenes from another place and time: grown men running down the aisles clutching bouquets, world-renowned musicians pummeling the railings of the upper boxes, jaded critics breaking into foolish smiles.' The subject of these rapturous responses, has, unlike the traditional virtuoso, played relatively few solo recitals, preferring to make music with others. Early in her career she often performed as a recitalist and a handful of recordings and live broadcasts remain as a testament. This set is the twelfth volume of Doremi's special series of live performances and broadcasts featuring the artistry of the young Martha Argerich. All items are first release ever.\n\nVitreous Body\n\nPhilip Glass, Anthony Fiumara\n\nSlagwerk Den Haag\n\nOrange Mountain Music OMM0163\n\nRelease: 10 February 2023\n\nOrange Mountain Music is pleased to announce the release of the new album VITREOUS BODY which presents original music by Anthony Fiumara and re-imaginings by Fiumara of music by Philip Glass - performed by Slagwerk Den Haag (The Hague Percussion.) When Slagwerk Den Haag asked Fiumara to put together a concert program for Glass's 80th birthday in 2017, Fiumara was inspired by the rhythmic patterns, the long lines and the modality in Philip Glass' early music he went on to arrange some of Glass's works for this virtuoso percussion group. The pieces Fiumara selected include Glass's Music in Similar Motion and Mad Rush.In the spirit of these early minimal works, Fuimara added his own works including Vitreous Body, as his percussive tribute to Philip Glass as well as the tracks Chorale, Petals, and Remix.\n\nVaughan Williams Live, Vol 4\n\nArthur Whittemore, Jack Lowe, New York Philharmonic-Symphony Orchestra, Halle Orchestra, Dimitri Mitropoulos, Sir John Barbirolli\n\nSOMM Recordings ARIADNE5020\n\nRelease: 10 February 2023\n\nSOMM Recordings continues its acclaimed Vaughan Williams Live series celebrating the 150th anniversary of Ralph Vaughan Williams' birth with Volume 4 featuring his signature Fantasia on a Theme of Thomas Tallis, the Concerto for Two Pianos and Eighth Symphony in recordings conducted by Dimitri Mitropoulos and Sir John Barbirolli. The Tallis Fantasia is a live recording from Carnegie Hall in 1943 with Mitropoulos, a committed advocate for Vaughan Williams' music, conducting the New York Philharmonic-Symphony Orchestra. They are also heard in the Concerto for Two Pianos, again from Carnegie Hall in 1952, when the soloists were Arthur Whittemore and Jack Lowe, who forged a widely popular and critically acclaimed piano duo partnership in America in the middle of the last century. Recorded in Manchester's Free Trade Hall in 1964, the Symphony No 8 is blazingly conducted by its dedicatee, Sir John Barbirolli, leading the Hallé Orchestra.\n\nRobert Matthew-Walker: A Bad Night in Los Angeles\n\nMark Bebbington, Rebeca Omordia\n\nSOMM Recordings SOMMCD0662\n\nRelease: 10 February 2023\n\nA Bad Night in Los Angeles is a disc of music for solo piano and piano duet by Robert Matthew-Walker, with Mark Bebbington partnered by Rebeca Omordia. Matthew-Walker has been an influential part of the classical recording industry for more than fifty years, running marketing and publicity departments for leading labels CBS and RCA, and as editor of Musical Opinion magazine since 2009. A Bad Night in Los Angeles features first recordings of eight works composed between 1980 and 2021, including the title track - 'disco dance music for the piano' - one of Three American Pictures offering vibrant impressions of the City of Angels and New York. The earliest, substantial work, Fantasy-Sonata: Hamlet, Matthew-Walker's Third Piano Sonata, is 'neither programmatic nor a character portrait', says the composer who describes it as 'a metaphysical work'. The Evening of Memory is a contemplative piece inspired by a comment by the American General Douglas MacArthur, Nocturne and Aubade two contrasting miniatures for left-hand, Battledore, a five-part suite for children. Completing the disc are tributes to other composers: The Fields are White Already 'a contemplation for solo piano in memoriam John McCabe'; Fantasy on a Theme from Malcolm Arnold built around the older composer's name; and Divertimento on a Theme of Mozart 'an aphoristic patchwork' for piano duet suggested by the F major Sonata (K 533).\n\nIain Farrington: Classical Changes\n\nArt Deco Trio\n\nSOMM Recordings SOMMCD0663\n\nRelease: 10 February 2023\n\nClassical Changes, a second disc by the Art Deco Trio, treats favourite classical pieces to delightful and often dazzling jazz-accented re-workings in variegated arrangements by Iain Farrington. Comprising three remarkable instrumentalists - Peter Sparks clarinet, Kyle Horch saxophone, Iain Farrington piano - the Art Deco Trio is a virtuosic powerhouse in performance and made its acclaimed label debut with Gershwinicity (SOMMCD0631) in 2021. Also featuring five African-American Spirituals and three sea shanties, Classical Change takes the early-20th-century fashion for 'Jazzing the Classics' at face value with a collection of 20 first recordings of scintillating new arrangements, translating the works' 'original sober environment into one that was more intoxicated', as Farrington tellingly comments in his booklet notes. Familiar pieces by Beethoven, Brahms and Rimsky-Korsakov are respectively refashioned in the, by turns, evocative, exuberant and ecstatic 'Elise's Blues', 'Hungarian High-Five' and 'The Bite of the Flumblebee'. Similar treatment is afforded Bizet (the excitable 'Jiffy Dance' and sultry 'One Night in Seville'), the ceremonial pomp of Handel ('Arrival Revival'), grandeur of Elgar ('Saturday in the Park with Elgar'), and grandiosity of Wagner ('Valerie Takes a Ride') alongside vivacious re-imaginings of Satie and Vivaldi. The trio of sea shanties in A Sea Shanty Shake-Up and the five-part Lay My Burden Down, drawn from African-American Spirituals, prove pleasingly amenable to Farrington's jazz-laced re-fashioning of their various messages and moods.\n\nSergey Rachmaninov: Symphony No 2, Op 27 & Vocalise, Op 34, No 14\n\nSaint Louis Symphony Orchestra / Leonard Slatkin\n\nVox Classics VOX-NX-3013CD\n\nRelease: 10 February 2023\n\nSergey Rachmaninov's orchestral works were composed between 1887 (when he was not yet fourteen) and 1940 - the beginning of his final years. While composing the Second Symphony he was plagued by self-doubt, but in the end, not only did he complete the work, but also received a Glinka Prize for the symphony that showcases his masterly writing for the orchestra, his subtle and evocative use of colour, and his sure sense of structural proportion. Vocalise was originally composed for soprano or tenor with piano accompaniment. This recording features the better-known arrangement for orchestra, which wonderfully conveys the flowing theme that is characteristic of the composer's most expressive symphonic slow movements. Leonard Slatkin maintains a rigorous schedule of guest conducting throughout the world and is active as a composer, author and teacher. Elite Recordings represents the legendary producers Marc Aubort and Joanna Nickrenz, who recorded Rachmaninov's entire symphonic output for Vox in the 1970s. They worked with more than 45 conductors over 32 years and the brilliant sound of their productions made them highly sought-after collector's items.\n\nWolfgang Amadeus Mozart: Piano Concertos Nos 17 & 27\n\nWalter Klien, piano; Minnesota Orchestra / Stanisław Skrowaczewski\n\nVox Classics VOX-NX-3012CD\n\nRelease: 10 February 2023\n\nMozart was at his consistent best in the piano concertos, in which he successfully combined elements of virtuosity and depth, chamber music and symphonic style, and regard for both his public audience and his personal expression. Pianist Walter Klien recorded for Vox all of Mozart's works for piano, together with those by Schubert and many works of other important composers. The present recording was made in 1978 by the famous production team of Joanna Nickrenz and Marc Aubort founders of the appropriately named Elite Recordings studio. The GRAMMY category of 'Producer of the Year, Classical' was introduced in 1979 and Joanna Nickrenz was the first woman to receive a nomination for the award. During her long career she received eight 'Producer of the Year, Classical' nominations and won the distinction twice. In 1983, she shared the win with Marc Aubort. In 1996, she was the sole recipient. Since that time, many of their projects have achieved collector status, especially their recordings of American orchestras. For this re-issue the original tapes have been carefully restored and transferred before being subsequently re-mastered.\n\nPolish Music for Cello and Orchestra\n\nAlexandre Tansman, Grażyna Bacewicz, Henryk Hubertus Jabłoński, Miłosz Magin\n\nMarcin Zdunik, cello; Warsaw Philharmonic Orchestra / Andrzej Boreyko\n\nCD Accord ACD313\n\nRelease: 10 February 2023\n\nFor its new recording project, the Warsaw Philharmonic, with its music and artistic director Andrzej Boreyko, invited the Polish cello virtuoso Marcin Zdunik. On Polish Music for Cello and Orchestra, the artists present four compositions: Aleksander Tansman's Fantasy for cello and orchestra, Grażyna Bacewicz's First Cello Concerto, Henryk Hubertus Jabłoński's C-67 and Miłosz Magin's Cello Concerto. What do the four works for solo instrument and orchestra chosen for this recording have in common, besides the cello, that most soulful of instruments that in the hands of a virtuoso can make us hold our breath in anticipation of each note to come? Well, they are also linked by the fact that they were written by composers of Polish origins who lived during the twentieth century, most of them born in the same city, Łódź (except for Henryk Hubertus Jabłoński, associated personally and professionally with Gdańsk). In some of the works, we also hear distinct and intentional inspirations from Polish traditional music. In this interesting selection, we have both works by distinctly recognisable artists - Grażyna Bacewicz and Aleksander Tansman - and also less frequently performed compositions by Jabłoński and Miłosz Magin, which certainly deserve our attention. All four composers present a common front with regard to musical traditions: they see both a need for their continuation and a need to update and transform the means shaped by those traditions. Although they represented different aesthetic outlooks and wrote in different styles, they all tackled the most important problem of twentieth-century music: relating to the past while looking to the future. In music, those two contrasting notions - tradition and innovation - have proved impossible to reconcile. Each of our composers turned to traditional forms and major-minor tonality in a different way, in order to find a bridge between modern composition techniques and listeners' perceptual capacities and habits.\n\nJonathan Dove: Sappho Sings\n\nFairhaven Singers, London Mozart Players, Ralph Woodward\n\nConvivium Records CR076\n\nRelease: 10 February 2023\n\n'It's testament to the force of Sappho's art that, even though practically all that remains of her work is, tantalisingly, just fragments, those fragments of her work still have the power to move, intrigue and inspire us. Huge thanks to Ralph Woodward for giving me the opportunity to set Alasdair Middleton's wonderfully immediate translations, to the London Mozart Players for their fiercely vivid playing, and to the Fairhaven Singers for making Sappho sing again with passion and love.' — Jonathan Dove\n\nPhilip Moore: Via Crucis\n\nRichard Moore, Revd Dr Barry Orford (narrator)\n\nConvivium Records CR079\n\nRelease: 10 February 2023\n\nExplore this premiere recording of Philip Moore's Via Crucis, performed at Guildford Cathedral by organist Richard Moore, with Revd Dr Barry Orford. The album includes a forward by the composer.\n\nStephan Elmas: Complete Piano Works Vol. 2: Mazurkas\n\nMikael Ayrapetyan\n\nGrand Piano GP928\n\nRelease: 10 February 2023\n\nA child prodigy, Stephan Elmas met Franz Liszt and made his acclaimed Viennese performing debut in 1885. Like Chopin, Elmas combined the character of folk-music dance forms to create sophisticated and deeply personal statements, and his Mazurkas are musical poems and paintings in which depictions of everyday scenes are combined with soulful lyricism. This world première recording by Armenian music specialist Mikael Ayrapetyan provides ample evidence of the great contribution Elmas's Mazurkas make to the piano repertoire and to the musical heritage of Armenia and beyond.\n\nPiano Miniatures from China - Edward Han Jiang, Sun Yiqiang, Tan Dun, Wang Jianzhong, Wang Ming\n\nEdward Han Jiang, piano\n\nGrand Piano GP929\n\nRelease: 10 February 2023\n\nThe ten pieces in this collection have been carefully selected as being most representative of Chinese culture, combining compositions from the 1960s and 70s with contemporary piano works and arrangements of ancient folk songs by pianist and composer Edward Han Jiang. Jiang compares the coalescence of the black and white keys of the piano to the layers and spirit in Chinese ink paintings as they portray rivers in the north and south, a bold Spring Dance from the west and the graceful Jasmine Flower from the east - all are lit by the moon, as described in music that dates back to the Tang Dynasty.\n\nAscenso - Damián Ponce de León, Jorge Humberto, Pinzón Malagón, Isaac Albéniz, Leonardo Federico Hoyos, Santiago Cañón-Valencia\n\nSantiago Canon-Valencia, cello\n\nSono Luminus SLE-70028\n\nRelease: 10 February 2023\n\n'Ascenso is a collection of works that have, in one way or another, a direct connection to myself. I wanted to present an album that was a representation of my current self, not just as a cellist, but as an artist. My idea is that this is not a cellist's recording, or an album centered around the instrument, but rather a work that is meant to be experienced as you would a painting on a wall, whatever that maymean to you.' Santiago Cañón-Valencia has been praised as one of the most promising young cellists of his generation. Born in Bogota in 1995, his major musical mentors have been Henryk Zarzycki in Colombia, James Tennant in New Zealand, Andres Diaz in the United States and Wolfgang Emanuel Schmidt at the Kronberg Academy in Germany.\n\n3 FEBRUARY 2023\n\nSteve Reich: The String Quartets\n\nMivos Quartet\n\nDeutsche Grammophon\n\nRelease: 3 February 2023\n\nThe Mivos Quartet is devoted to performing the works of contemporary composers, presenting new music to diverse audiences.

Elgar's ground-breaking work, commissioned for the newly formed London Symphony Orchestra and premièred in 1905, is inspired by the baroque concerto grosso, and features a solo string quartet contrasted with the full symphonic string section. These orchestral forces were also adopted by Herbert Howells in his Concerto for String Orchestra, from 1938. Delius's Late Swallows is the only piece not originally composed for string orchestra; it was arranged (from the slow movement of Delius's String Quartet) by his amanuensis, Eric Fenby. Recorded in Surround Sound and available as a Hybrid SACD, and digitally in Spatial Audio.\n\nHaydn: Complete Piano Trios Volume 2\n\nTrio Gaspard\n\nChandos CHAN 20270\n\nRelease: 3 February 2023\n\nThe first volume of Trio Gaspard's Haydn cycle was enthusiastically received by buyers and critics alike. As in the case of that first volume, the Trio has designed a programme for the second volume that works in its own right, and features trios from all periods of Haydn's career. Three later works (Nos 33, 35, and 45) were all composed in 1794 / 95 and contrast with the early trio No 7, from circa 1760, whilst the trio No 21, from the composer's middle period, was written in 1784 / 85. As in Volume 1, Trio Gaspard chooses to end the programme with another contemporary work reflective of the programme - in this instance For Gaspard by the cellist-composer Leonid Gorokhov. The first of the two movements (a common structure in Haydn's trios), 'Hidden D' (a play on the popular reference to the 'Haydn D' major Cello Concerto) reworks numerous themes from that piece, among many others!\n\nUncovered Volume 3\n\nCatalyst Quartet\n\nColeridge-Taylor Perkinson, George Walker, William Grant Still\n\nAzica Records ACD- 71357 (digital only)\n\nRelease: 3 February 2023\n\nCatalyst Quartet releases Uncovered Volume 3: George Walker, Coleridge-Taylor Perkinson, William Grant Still on Azica Records. The digital-only album is the third issue of a multi-volume anthology highlighting string quartet works by historically important Black composers, which aims to bring greater awareness and programming of their music. Volume 3 profiles three American composers who lived through the various Black artistic, political, and social projects that transformed the twentieth century; and the deep contradictions that continue to plague the USA today: George Walker and his String Quartet No 1, 'Lyric', Coleridge-Taylor Perkinson's String Quartet No 1, 'Calvary', and William Gran"
