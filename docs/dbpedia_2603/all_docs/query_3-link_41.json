        "text": "PROGRAM NOTES\n\nGRYC, STEPHEN (B. 1949)\n\nFIVE AMERICAN PORTRAITS FOR FIVE WIND INSTRUMENTS (1987)\n\nFive American Portraits, commissioned by the Soni Fidelis Wind Quintet celebrates American cultural life though musical depictions of five influential Americans: H.L. Mencken, John Cage, Henry Ford, Edger Allan Poe, and Theodore Roosevelt. Each figure is animated by a different instrument of the woodwind quintet. Despite Gryc’s noble efforts to capture the innovation and ingenuity of Americans throughout history, he aptly recognizes his oversights:\n\nThe woodwind quintet is one of the most difficult of the standard chamber groups for which to compose due to its heterogeneous nature. Each of the five instruments is featured in a movement and becomes the voice of a famous American. All five of the characters portrayed are idiosyncratic individuals who none-the-less played important roles in American history and culture.\n\nThe work won a competition which came with some money and a New York City performance. When I saw that the members of the sponsoring Vox Nova Woodwind Quintet were all women, I was a little embarrassed to have written character sketches only of men. The wonderful players gave me a great performance.\n\nExploiting the contrasting voices of the wind quintet allows the composer to both capture and critique each the life and times of each historical figure.\n\nH.L Mencken (1880-1956) was a journalist, satirist, linguist, and controversial cultural critic whose complex views on war, religion, politics, and economics often suggested cognitive dissonance when viewed through the lens of the twenty-first century. In this work, Mencken is represented by the clarinet; it’s a virtuosic, fast-paced first movement that is punctuated by long notes dominating the musical texture, as if an otherwise busy mind is suddenly captivated by a particularly fascinating idea.\n\nJohn Cage (1912-1992), an avant-garde composer and music theorist who was perhaps best known for his composition 4’33” and for pioneering compositions written for prepared piano. Influenced by East and South Asian culture and philosophy, Cage came to see music as “a purposeless play …an affirmation of life – not an attempt to bring order out of chaos nor to suggest improvements in creation, but simply a way of waking up to the very life we’re living”. Creative thought in this movement is portrayed by a liberated and lyrical flute solo interposed by the clarinet and oboe.\n\nHenry Ford (1863-1947) was a capitalist visionary, and the founder of the Ford Motor Company. He developed the assembly line as a means of mass production and brought the automobile to the American middle class with the introduction of the Ford Model T in 1908. Upbeat, rhythmic, and cheery, this is a melodic and asymmetrical march for the oboe that evokes a productive and well-run factory.\n\nEdgar Allan Poe (1809-1849) is best known for his poetry and short stories that showcase mystery and the macabre and is credited with pioneering the genre of detective stories. His short life was marked by tragically losing his young wife and first cousin Virginia Clemm in 1946 and being unable to turn his considerable literary success into meaningful financial gain. The adversity in Poe’s life is represented by a slow and introspective bassoon solo. Perhaps the most lyrically beautiful movement in the quintet, the soprano-voiced woodwinds “chatter” throughout, joining the solo bassoon at times in a duet or trio illustrating Poe’s wife Virginia.\n\nTheodore Roosevelt (1858-1919) was President of the United States from 1901-1909 and Governor of New York from 1899-1900. Considered one of the great historical U.S. presidents, Roosevelt championed progressive policies such as anti-trust and environmental conservation. Depicted first by a majestic and dignified horn solo, the finale perks up when the oboe enters, followed by the flute, constantly building rhythmic energy through the use of accents and hemiolas until the very end.\n\nENESCU, GEORGES (1881-1955)\n\nAUBADE FOR STRING TRIO IN C MAJOR (1899)\n\nFew composers have had the distinction of their hometown being renamed posthumously in their honour; his birthplace, the village of Liveni, is now known as George Enescu, Botoșani County, Western Moldavia, Romania. George Enescu remains one of Romania’s greatest musicians and one of the most outstanding of many Romanian artists who achieved international fame.\n\nConsidered a child prodigy, Enescu was sent to the Vienna Conservatory in 1888 as the first non-Austrian student ever to study there, and gave his first public performance at age 8. Like Mozart more than a century earlier, Enescu was already writing music as a young child, and the earliest notable work that survives is titled Pămînt românesc, which translates as Romanian Land. It is inscribed “opus for piano and violin by George Enescu, Romanian Composer, aged five years and a quarter”.\n\nAn aubade is music intended for the morning, specifically the early morning, and is thought to evoke the parting of lovers at dawn. This Scherzo and Trio was composed in Paris in 1899, the same year Enescu, known in France as Georges Enesco, completed his studies at the Paris Conservatoire in violin, harmony, and composition under Jules Massenet and Gabriel Fauré.\n\nA love and appreciation for his Romanian homeland and heritage continued to inspire both composition and performance throughout the composer’s life; many of Enescu’s mature works rely on Romanian folk music. Understanding that temperamental tastes influence the durability of style in classical music, he sought to promote the music of contemporary twentieth-century Romanian composers including Constantin Silvestri, Mihail Jora, and Jonel Perlea. Following a collaboration with Ravi Shankar’s brother Uday, it seems that Enescu’s respect for the genre of Folk music had deepened and expanded to include Eastern traditions. He is thought to have first introduced his former student, Yehudi Menuhin, to the Indonesian Gamelan Orchestra.\n\nEnescu spent both world wars in Bucharest. Despite wartime slowing down an otherwise fast-paced musical life, he managed to split his time between Paris and Bucharest when not touring other European centres. It was during WWI that he first led an orchestra, conducting performances of Beethoven’s Symphony No. 9, works by Berlioz, Debussy, and Wagner, as well as some of his own compositions. In 1923, Enescu embarked on his first American tour as a conductor and subsequently appeared with numerous major orchestras including the Philadelphia Orchestra and the New York Philharmonic. Late in life, he began teaching at the Mannes School of Music in New York City.\n\nMARTINŮ, BOHUSLAV (1890-1959)\n\nSERENADE NO. 1, H.217\n\nBohuslav Martinů was an extraordinarily prolific composer from what is now the Czech Republic, having written about 400 works over his lifetime. Eventually finding his primary compositional voice in Neoclassicism after an exploratory period in Paris during the 1920s, Martinů’s music began to incorporate the influences of jazz and Moravian folk themes as his writing moved away from the Romantic style in which he had been trained at the Prague Conservatory. Serenade No. 1, written in 1932, typifies Martinů’s texturally complex and harmonically colourful work during this period. His work was stylistically aligned, in many ways, with his 20th century musical contemporaries, such as Stravinsky, including in the departure from strict neoclassical form as he entered his mature years as a composer.\n\nSerenade No. 1 is a chamber work for six players, and although Martinů was no stranger to crafting music from unusual combinations, this work stands out for featuring a trio of violins and three alto-voiced instruments (clarinet, horn, and viola). Lacking in this sextet is a bass instrument, and a piano, which is present in the vast majority of Martinů’s orchestral compositions and has significant representation in his chamber music works.\n\nThis work was preceded in 1930 by a chamber orchestra composition titled Serenade, and followed by three other Serenades, all written in 1932. Martinů also wrote a later Serenade in 1951 while living in the United States and focusing on orchestral writing. These compositions, which range in size from a trio to a small orchestra, feature between one and four solo violins in keeping with Martinů’s desire to experiment with instrumentation. Although the musical origins of a serenade suggest light-hearted music for the evening, and are especially evocative of a romantic greeting while passing the beloved’s balcony, Martinů has emphasized the importance of form in the neoclassical genre by adhering to a three-movement structure (fast-slow-fast) in this short work.\n\nThe opening of the first movement, “Allegro Moderato”, is characterized by off-beat accents in the string parts which play tricks on the listener’s sense of pulse, while the clarinet and horn trade lyrical moments. Thus, a rising line continues into an abbreviated development section before returning to the original rhythmic material. During the second movement “Larghetto”, the sustained notes in the wind parts, marked piano and pianissimo, colour the moving line of the violin trio until a tender solo in the clarinet signals that the movement is coming to an end. The final movement, “Allegro”, is fast and rhythmic, with short virtuosic solos for each instrument. The work concludes brightly and suddenly.\n\nMUSSORGSKY, MODESTE (1839-1881)\n\nPICTURES AT AN EXHIBITION (1874), ARR. ANDREW AGER\n\nCOMMISSIONED FOR, AND DEDICATED TO, DR. SHEILA AGER\n\nThere are only a few musical themes in the classical genre more iconic than the repeating Promenade from Mussorgsky’s ten-movement piano masterpiece, Pictures at an Exhibition. In the often-performed orchestral adaptation of this work, created in 1922 by composer Maurice Ravel, the Promenade is most prominently heard throughout the work as a trumpet solo, and as such, is a cornerstone of orchestral repertoire for the trumpet. In the arrangement performed at this concert, the Promenade is featured on various instruments throughout the ensemble.\n\nThe origin of Mussorgsky’s virtuosic Pictures at an Exhibition, and its posthumous publication are inseparable from the composer’s personal and professional difficulties. Mussorgsky enjoyed a friendship and a lively artistic exchange with Viktor Hartmann, the artist, architect, and designer who created the now-lost pictures, which inspired the composition. However, Hartmann’s sudden death in 1873, only a few years after the passing of Mussorgsky’s mother, and the family’s sudden impoverishment following Tsar Alexander II’s Emancipation Edict, troubled the composer deeply. During the late 1860s, Mussorgsky faced artistic estrangement and ostracism due to divergent musical ideals from The Mighty Handful, a group of five Russian composers including Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, César Cui, Mily Balakirev, and Alexandr Borodin. He descended further into addiction even as his most successful and well-loved work, the opera Boris Godunov, received multiple performances in spite of its lukewarm response from critics.\n\nNotwithstanding the challenges of this period in the composer’s life, Pictures at an Exhibition was written in only three weeks, during June of 1874. Updating a friend on the progress of the work, Mussorgsky breathlessly exclaimed — “Ideas, melodies, come to me of their own accord. Like roast pigeons in the story, I gorge and gorge and over-eat myself. I can hardly manage to put it all down on paper fast enough.” The music is famously representational of Russian folk tropes, such as the movement titled “Baba Yaga: The Hut on Fowl’s Legs”, and contains many evocative musical devices designed to produce a visceral response in the listener. While the work’s reception among Mussorgsky’s fans was overwhelmingly positive and enthusiastic, many of the composer’s colleagues were uncomfortable with the radicalness of Pictures at an Exhibition; a reaction which served to worsen Mussorgsky’s insecurities, and the work was not published until 1886 by Rimsky-Korsakov, five years following Mussorgsky’s death.\n\nRavel’s arrangement of the original work for piano was created at the behest of conductor Serge Koussevitzky shortly before his tenure as conductor of the Boston Symphony. In the orchestral version of Pictures at an Exhibition, the strange and wonderful imagery in Mussorgsky’s music is heightened by Ravel’s brilliant orchestration. The arrangement on this program, created especially for the Regina Symphony Chamber Players by Andrew Ager, is freely adapted from the original piano score for eleven musicians.\n\nProgram Notes by Tamsin Lorraine Johnston\n\nProgram Notes\n\nCOLEMAN, VALERIE (b. 1970)\n\nSeven O’clock Shout (2020)\n\nSeven O’Clock Shout is an anthem inspired by the tireless frontline workers during the Covid-19 pandemic, and the heartwarming ritual of evening serenades that brings people together amidst isolation to celebrate life and the sacrifices of heroes. The work begins with a distant and solitary solo between two trumpets in fanfare fashion to commemorate the isolation forced upon humankind, and the need to reach out to one another. The fanfare blossoms into a lushly dense landscape of nature, symbolizing both the caregiving acts of nurses and doctors as they try to save lives, while nature is transforming and healing herself during a time of self-isolation.\n\nWhen a composer has the rare opportunity to create for musicians they have gotten to know, the act of composing becomes an embrace tailored to the personality and capabilities of the musicians with elements of both challenge and appreciation. One such moment is dedicated to humanity and grace, as a clarinet solo written for Ricardo Morales, followed by a flute solo with both Jeffrey Khaner and Patrick Williams in mind, providing a transition into a new upbeat segment. Later, to continue tradition from the first commission the composer received from the orchestra, a piccolo solo dedicated to Erica Peel dances with joy.\n\nIt was suggested that a short work for a debut by multi-track recording could account for the ensemble performing together as if they were in the same room. One of the devices used to address this is the usage of Ostinato, which is a rhythmic motif that repeats itself to generate forward motion and in this case, groove. The ostinato patterns here are laid down by the bass section, allowing the English horn and strings to float over it, gradually building up to that moment at 7pm, when cheers, claps, clangings of pots and pans, and shouts ring through the air of cities around the world! The trumpets drive an infectious rhythm, layered with a traditional Son clave rhythm, while solo trombone boldly rings out an anthem within a traditional African call and response style. The entire orchestra ‘shouts’ back in response and the entire ensemble rallies into an anthem that embodies the struggles and triumph of humanity. The work ends in a proud anthem moment where we all come together with grateful hearts to acknowledge that we have survived yet another day.\n\nSTILL, WILLIAM GRANT (1895-1978)\n\nWood Notes (1948)\n\nCalled the “Dean of Afro-American Composers” and considered part of the Harlem Renaissance in the 1920s and 1930s, William Grant Still was a conductor, orchestrator, performer, and composer of nearly two hundred works. These included many large-scale orchestral works, choral works and songs, as well as solo pieces and chamber music. Choosing to leave the undergraduate program in Science at Wilberforce University, a historically-Black college in Ohio, Still used his inheritance from his father, supplemented with part-time work, to pursue studying at the Oberlin Conservatory of Music. Already a violinist, Still taught himself to play several other instruments including clarinet, saxophone, oboe, double bass, cello, and viola. His promising early compositions caught the attention of Oberlin’s composition faculty, even though he hadn’t been registered in the program. His composition training eventually led him to study privately with Edgar Varèse and George Whitefield Chadwick.\n\nLike many musicians of his era, Still’s musical life was interrupted by World War I. After serving in the United States Navy, he moved from Tennessee where he had been working in a Blues Band to New York, while keeping his employment with songwriter W.C. Handy. Living in Harlem allowed Still to connect with many influential Black artists, writers, philosophers, and activists such as Langston Hughes and Alain LeRoy Rocke, while playing in Broadway pit orchestras, arranging, and performing on various recordings. During this time, Still continued to compose his own music, and in 1931, his Symphony No. 1 Afro-American, was premiered by the Rochester Philharmonic under the baton of Howard Hanson, with whom Still enjoyed a lifelong friendship and close professional association, and who facilitated the premiere of many of Still’s works in Rochester.\n\nSymphony No. 1 Afro-American was extraordinarily successful. Not only was it the first time the complete score of a work by an African-American composer was performed by a major Symphony Orchestra, it also reached audiences in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, London, Berlin, and Paris over the next decade and a half. Until 1950 it was the most popular and frequently-played Symphonic work by an American.\n\nRelocating to Los Angeles in 1934, Still received a Guggenheim Fellowship. In the years that followed, he achieved many firsts, including being the first African-American composer to conduct a major symphony orchestra (LA Philharmonic) performing his own music, he was the first African-American to conduct a major orchestra (New Orleans Philharmonic) in the Deep South, and his opera Troubled Island was the first opera by an American composer to be performed by the New York City Opera, and the first opera by an African-American to performed by a major opera company.\n\nWood Notes, written in 1947 and premiered in 1948 by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, was inspired by the composer’s deep love and appreciation of nature, and also by the poetry of writer and clergyman J. Mitchell Pilcher. A harmonically lush four-movement pastoral suite for orchestra, Wood Notes evokes the natural world of the American South.\n\nPRICE, FLORENCE (1887-1953)\n\nPiano Concerto in D minor in One Movement (1934)\n\nFlorence Beatrice Price (née Smith), an organist and pianist, composed over three hundred musical works, including about one hundred songs. Her compositions range from large-scale orchestral works, including four symphonies and four concerti, to choral works, chamber and solo pieces. As a composer, she rose to prominence in her forties after winning a prize for her Symphony No. 1 in E Minor, which was premiered by the Chicago Symphony under the baton of Frederick Stock in 1932. This sudden success took place after years of teaching, playing organ for silent films, and writing songs for radio ads while raising two children on her own after divorcing her abusive husband.\n\nWhen living in the South during the Jim Crow era became untenable, she moved to Chicago in 1927 with her family. Price had lived in Little Rock, her hometown where fellow African-American composer William Grant Still had been her classmate, and briefly in Atlanta where she was head of the music department at Clark Atlanta University, a historically-Black college. Price was an exceptional student in Little Rock, graduating at age fourteen as valedictorian of her class, and going on to study at New England Conservatory of Music pursuing a double major in piano and organ, where she convinced the admissions department that she was of Mexican heritage to sidestep racial discrimination.\n\nBeing a thoroughly American symphonist, Price’s training and classical style is rooted in Romanticism following in the footsteps of Liszt, Mendelssohn, and in particular Dvorak. Her music is brimming with references to her faith as an African-American Christian, containing spirituals, gospel, blues, and rhythms recalling African Dance. The opening of the second part of Piano Concerto in D Minor in One Movement is very reflective and hymn-like; the work in fact features three movements meant to be performed without break. The version of the Concerto on this program is a re-construction by Trevor Weston of the 1934 premiere in which Price was the soloist, since the score and some of the parts are lost.\n\nIn fact, all of Price’s musical achievements were very nearly lost. Price knew better than anyone the barriers her musical legacy faced. It’s not known if her highly successful Symphony No. 1 was performed again after its premiere, and in a letter to Serge Koussevitzky, conductor of the Boston Symphony in 1943, she wrote: “To begin with, I have two handicaps — those of sex and race. I am a woman; and I have some Negro blood in my veins. I should like to be judged on merit alone.” However, in 2009, papers and works of Price’s were found in an old house in Illinois during a renovation project. The house had once been the composer’s summer home, and restoring it is rightfully restoring her reputation as a composer belonging to the canon of respected American symphonists.\n\nBEETHOVEN, LUDWIG VAN (1770-1827)\n\nSymphony No.5 in C Minor Op. 67\n\nOpening with one of the most recognized musical motifs in classical music history, Beethoven’s Symphony No. 5 is not only the most frequently performed Beethoven symphony, it is one of the most frequently performed orchestral works in the Western canon. The famous four-note opening motifs has transcended the symphonic oeuvre and found its way into other musical genres and popular culture generally. Its association with the Morse code for Victory (dot-dot-dot-dash) is purely coincidental; the Morse code usage came about decades after the symphony was written, but the reference to “Victory” has been culturally entrenched since World War II.\n\nBeethoven conceived the opening motif in its rhythmic character as representing Fate knocking at the door. Like Symphony No. 3 (“Eroica”), and Symphony No. 6 (“Pastorale”), Symphony No. 5 had a nickname, (“Schicksals-Sinfonie”), meaning Fate-Symphony in use for some time. Later Romantic-era compositions, including Tchaikovsky’s Symphony No. 4, also use musical symbolism to evoke the inevitability of Fate. It is believed that Beethoven’s choice of key, C Minor, was linked to the theme of destiny, and a recording of the first movement of Symphony No. 5, along with the fifth movement of Beethoven’s String Quartet No. 13, was included on the Voyager Golden Record, a disc sent into interstellar space in 1977 as part of a broad sample of human language and culture.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Symphony No. 5, widely considered a masterpiece, took four years to write between 1804 and 1808. Beethoven was very busy with a number of other projects, including the three Razumovsky String Quartets, commissioned by Beethoven’s patron, Russian diplomat, Count Razumovsky, to whom Symphony No. 5 is also dedicated. Symphony No. 5 was premiered at the same concert as Symphony No. 6 in December 1808. In fact, Symphony No. 6 was the opening work on a four-hour-long, not particularly successful performance of eight of Beethoven’s works.\n\nFollowing its publication in 1810, appreciation for Symphony No. 5 soared. In an ecstatic and breathlessly-reverential review by E.T.A. Hoffman, the experience of hearing the work live is described as follows:\n\nRadiant beams shoot through this region’s deep night, and we become aware of gigantic shadows which, rocking back and forth, close in on us and destroy everything within us except the pain of endless longing—a longing in which every pleasure that rose up in jubilant tones sinks and succumbs, and only through this pain, which, while consuming but not destroying love, hope, and joy, tries to burst our breasts with full-voiced harmonies of all the passions, we live on and are captivated beholders of the spirits.\n\nTo his credit, E.T.A. Hoffman was a very well-respected author, artist, and music critic who devoted the majority of the review to a critical analysis of the symphony, once he had regained his composure.\n\nProgram Notes by Tamsin Lorraine Johnston\n\nProgram Notes\n\nPON, AURA (B. 1981)\n\nROMP & REPOSE (2011)\n\nRomp & Repose was composed in 2010-2011 for its premiere by bassoonist Kelly Wood and the Symphony of the Kootenays in February 2011 in Cranbrook, BC. The music showcases the lyrical voice of the bassoon, with a sprinkling of jazz and blues idioms in acknowledgment of Kelly’s diverse background as a jazz saxophonist and classical bassoonist. It is dedicated to Kelly’s cat Sam and the composer’s cat Zippurr who passed away during the project, and while it would be oversimplifying to say the music became about the once frisky feline friends, the composer did take some inspiration from the quirky capricious essence of kitty spirit as an homage to them. Hence the two contrasting energies, which cats master so well, denoted by the title, Romp & Repose. It was subsequently performed by other bassoonists, including Karmen Doucette with the Okanagan Symphony Orchestra, Michael Hope with the Kensington Sinfonia, and Jonathan Gresl with the CalArts Orchestra.\n\nProgram Notes by Aura Pon\n\nPROKOFIEV, SERGEI (1891-1953)\n\nVIOLIN CONCERTO NO.2 IN G MINOR, OP.63\n\nSergei Prokofiev completed Violin Concerto No. 2 in 1935 as he was awaiting repatriation to his native Russia, having composed Violin Concerto No. 1 around the time that he first departed (with official permission) in 1917. For that reason, Violin Concerto No. 2 differs from the music Prokofiev wrote while living abroad in the United States and in France during the intervening years, in its modest dimensions and traditional form designed to convince Stalin that he no longer had an artistic use for “decadent formalism”.\n\nVery shortly before Prokofiev’s permanent relocation, and the Spanish Civil War, Violin Concerto No. 2 was premiered in Madrid, Spain in December of 1935 by French violinist David Soetens and the Madrid Symphony Orchestra led by Enrique Fernández Arbós. In what must have been a refreshing surprise for the composer at the time, the Spanish loved the work so much that a special delegation of musicians was sent to personally thank Prokofiev. This premiere, with its international cohort of musicians, undoubtedly helped Prokofiev believe, at least temporarily, that he could act as a musical ambassador between Europe and Soviet Russia.\n\nIt was also during this period that Prokofiev wrote Peter and the Wolf, Lieutenant Kijé, and Romeo & Juliet, three of his most famous works. In fact, there are numerous musical references to Romeo & Juliet throughout this concerto, particularly in the second movement, and more broadly in how the solo violin part is constructed to evoke the ballet. This era of composition in Prokofiev’s life demonstrates his extraordinary ability to adapt to the circumstances, political and otherwise, dictating his music-making. Working with Diaghilev’s Ballets Russes in Paris after a brief stay in the United States, Prokofiev was inspired to write opera, ballet, and large symphonic works such as Symphony No. 3 The Fiery Angel which showcases his interest in expressionism and large musical forms.\n\nHowever, much of his work at this time experienced production issues, an unenthusiastic reception, and of course drew negative attention from the Soviets. With an economic depression underway during the 1930s in the United States and Europe, which dampened his aspirations as an opera composer while forcing him to rely on touring income as a concert pianist, and tensions that soon led to World War II, Prokofiev sought a spiritual path in Christian Science that engendered a newfound simplicity and sincerity in his composition that seemed to pave the way for resettling in Russia.\n\nThe rules governing the arts were somewhat relaxed during the War years in Soviet Russia, and Prokofiev enjoyed a period of creativity and freedom in the works he produced. However, he found himself once again at odds with the Communist Party following the war and several of his compositions were banned. Nevertheless, he is considered one of the greatest composers of modern classical music, and both the State Music Academy and the Airport in Donetsk Oblast in Ukraine, where Prokofiev was born, have been named in his honour.\n\nRSO Box Office | (306) 586-9555 | reginasymphony.com | info@reginasymphony.com\n\nMOZART, WOLFGANG AMADEUS (1756-1791)\n\nSYMPHONY NO.39 IN E-FLAT MAJOR, K.543\n\nSymphony No. 39 by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart is believed to be the first in a set of three, all written in 1788 in Vienna, including Symphony No. 40, and Symphony No. 41 (“Jupiter”), the last symphony Mozart wrote. The Clarinet Quintet (K. 581) and the opera Così fan tutte were also written during this period and premiered in 1789 and 1790 respectively. It’s unclear whether Mozart heard Symphony No. 39 performed in his lifetime, although one theory holds that he attempted to organize a series of concerts in a casino which may have featured this work. The first recorded account, by Iwan Anderwitsch, of hearing Symphony No. 39 in 1792 in Hamburg, was as part of a memorial concert of Mozart’s music. About this experience, Anderwitsch had the following to say:\n\nThe opening is so majestic that it so surprised even the coldest, most insensitive listener and non-expert, that even if he wanted to chat, it prevented him from being inattentive, and thus, so to speak, put him in a position to become all ears. It then becomes [so] fiery, full, ineffably grand and rich in ideas, with striking variety in almost all obbligato parts, that it is nearly impossible to follow so rapidly with ear and feeling, and one is nearly paralyzed. This actual paralysis became visible in various connoisseurs and friends of music, and some admitted that they would never have been able to think or imagine they would hear something like this performed so splendidly in Hamburg.\n\nMozart did not live long enough to benefit either musically or financially from the success of his three late symphonies, which remain gems of the orchestral canon to this day. However, in the years leading up to the Austro-Turkish war in 1788, Mozart had hit his stride as a musician and entrepreneur. His final years of impoverishment were in fact a product of the war; without a robust local economy, the upper class was no longer in a position to spend their disposable income on the arts, preferring instead to relocate to country estates.\n\nSymphony No. 39 has several unusual features, which may have been a salute to a beloved friend, clarinetist and fellow Free Mason, Anton Stadler. Mozart had written for him the Clarinet Quintet in 1789, the (“Kegelstatt”) Trio K. 498 in 1786, obbligato solos in La clemenza di Tito K. 621 in 1791, and the stunning Clarinet Concerto K. 622 also in 1791. Symphony No. 39 prominently features a pair of clarinets, with several lyrical solos in the Minuet and Trio movement, which traditionally had belonged to the oboe section in 18th century music.\n\nWhile the Finale is crafted thematically to invoke fellow composer Joseph Haydn’s mischievous sense of humour, the first movement opens with an extended slow introduction. This is another stylistically unusual decision for Mozart, which may suggest he was coming to believe a symphonic work need not function solely as a stand-alone composition, but, by virtue of its structure, may belong in series with other multi-movement symphonic works. It’s seductive to believe that Mozart may have had a sixth sense of how the orchestra would grow and change dramatically over the following century.\n\nProgram Notes by Tamsin Lorraine Johnston\n\nPROGRAM NOTES\n\nGRYC, STEPHEN (B. 1949)\n\nFIVE AMERICAN PORTRAITS FOR FIVE WIND INSTRUMENTS (1987)\n\nFive American Portraits, commissioned by the Soni Fidelis Wind Quintet celebrates American cultural life though musical depictions of five influential Americans: H.L. Mencken, John Cage, Henry Ford, Edger Allan Poe, and Theodore Roosevelt. Each figure is animated by a different instrument of the woodwind quintet. Despite Gryc’s noble efforts to capture the innovation and ingenuity of Americans throughout history, he aptly recognizes his oversights:\n\nThe woodwind quintet is one of the most difficult of the standard chamber groups for which to compose due to its heterogeneous nature. Each of the five instruments is featured in a movement and becomes the voice of a famous American. All five of the characters portrayed are idiosyncratic individuals who none-the-less played important roles in American history and culture.\n\nThe work won a competition which came with some money and a New York City performance. When I saw that the members of the sponsoring Vox Nova Woodwind Quintet were all women, I was a little embarrassed to have written character sketches only of men. The wonderful players gave me a great performance.\n\nExploiting the contrasting voices of the wind quintet allows the composer to both capture and critique each the life and times of each historical figure.\n\nH.L Mencken (1880-1956) was a journalist, satirist, linguist, and controversial cultural critic whose complex views on war, religion, politics, and economics often suggested cognitive dissonance when viewed through the lens of the twenty-first century. In this work, Mencken is represented by the clarinet; it’s a virtuosic, fast-paced first movement that is punctuated by long notes dominating the musical texture, as if an otherwise busy mind is suddenly captivated by a particularly fascinating idea.\n\nJohn Cage (1912-1992), an avant-garde composer and music theorist who was perhaps best known for his composition 4’33” and for pioneering compositions written for prepared piano. Influenced by East and South Asian culture and philosophy, Cage came to see music as “a purposeless play …an affirmation of life – not an attempt to bring order out of chaos nor to suggest improvements in creation, but simply a way of waking up to the very life we’re living”. Creative thought in this movement is portrayed by a liberated and lyrical flute solo interposed by the clarinet and oboe.\n\nHenry Ford (1863-1947) was a capitalist visionary, and the founder of the Ford Motor Company. He developed the assembly line as a means of mass production and brought the automobile to the American middle class with the introduction of the Ford Model T in 1908. Upbeat, rhythmic, and cheery, this is a melodic and asymmetrical march for the oboe that evokes a productive and well-run factory.\n\nEdgar Allan Poe (1809-1849) is best known for his poetry and short stories that showcase mystery and the macabre and is credited with pioneering the genre of detective stories. His short life was marked by tragically losing his young wife and first cousin Virginia Clemm in 1946 and being unable to turn his considerable literary success into meaningful financial gain. The adversity in Poe’s life is represented by a slow and introspective bassoon solo. Perhaps the most lyrically beautiful movement in the quintet, the soprano-voiced woodwinds “chatter” throughout, joining the solo bassoon at times in a duet or trio illustrating Poe’s wife Virginia.\n\nTheodore Roosevelt (1858-1919) was President of the United States from 1901-1909 and Governor of New York from 1899-1900. Considered one of the great historical U.S. presidents, Roosevelt championed progressive policies such as anti-trust and environmental conservation. Depicted first by a majestic and dignified horn solo, the finale perks up when the oboe enters, followed by the flute, constantly building rhythmic energy through the use of accents and hemiolas until the very end.\n\nENESCU, GEORGES (1881-1955)\n\nAUBADE FOR STRING TRIO IN C MAJOR (1899)\n\nFew composers have had the distinction of their hometown being renamed posthumously in their honour; his birthplace, the village of Liveni, is now known as George Enescu, Botoșani County, Western Moldavia, Romania. George Enescu remains one of Romania’s greatest musicians and one of the most outstanding of many Romanian artists who achieved international fame.\n\nConsidered a child prodigy, Enescu was sent to the Vienna Conservatory in 1888 as the first non-Austrian student ever to study there, and gave his first public performance at age 8. Like Mozart more than a century earlier, Enescu was already writing music as a young child, and the earliest notable work that survives is titled Pămînt românesc, which translates as Romanian Land. It is inscribed “opus for piano and violin by George Enescu, Romanian Composer, aged five years and a quarter”.\n\nAn aubade is music intended for the morning, specifically the early morning, and is thought to evoke the parting of lovers at dawn. This Scherzo and Trio was composed in Paris in 1899, the same year Enescu, known in France as Georges Enesco, completed his studies at the Paris Conservatoire in violin, harmony, and composition under Jules Massenet and Gabriel Fauré.\n\nA love and appreciation for his Romanian homeland and heritage continued to inspire both composition and performance throughout the composer’s life; many of Enescu’s mature works rely on Romanian folk music. Understanding that temperamental tastes influence the durability of style in classical music, he sought to promote the music of contemporary twentieth-century Romanian composers including Constantin Silvestri, Mihail Jora, and Jonel Perlea. Following a collaboration with Ravi Shankar’s brother Uday, it seems that Enescu’s respect for the genre of Folk music had deepened and expanded to include Eastern traditions. He is thought to have first introduced his former student, Yehudi Menuhin, to the Indonesian Gamelan Orchestra.\n\nEnescu spent both world wars in Bucharest. Despite wartime slowing down an otherwise fast-paced musical life, he managed to split his time between Paris and Bucharest when not touring other European centres. It was during WWI that he first led an orchestra, conducting performances of Beethoven’s Symphony No. 9, works by Berlioz, Debussy, and Wagner, as well as some of his own compositions. In 1923, Enescu embarked on his first American tour as a conductor and subsequently appeared with numerous major orchestras including the Philadelphia Orchestra and the New York Philharmonic. Late in life, he began teaching at the Mannes School of Music in New York City.\n\nMARTINŮ, BOHUSLAV (1890-1959)\n\nSERENADE NO. 1, H.217\n\nBohuslav Martinů was an extraordinarily prolific composer from what is now the Czech Republic, having written about 400 works over his lifetime. Eventually finding his primary compositional voice in Neoclassicism after an exploratory period in Paris during the 1920s, Martinů’s music began to incorporate the influences of jazz and Moravian folk themes as his writing moved away from the Romantic style in which he had been trained at the Prague Conservatory. Serenade No. 1, written in 1932, typifies Martinů’s texturally complex and harmonically colourful work during this period. His work was stylistically aligned, in many ways, with his 20th century musical contemporaries, such as Stravinsky, including in the departure from strict neoclassical form as he entered his mature years as a composer.\n\nSerenade No. 1 is a chamber work for six players, and although Martinů was no stranger to crafting music from unusual combinations, this work stands out for featuring a trio of violins and three alto-voiced instruments (clarinet, horn, and viola). Lacking in this sextet is a bass instrument, and a piano, which is present in the vast majority of Martinů’s orchestral compositions and has significant representation in his chamber music works.\n\nThis work was preceded in 1930 by a chamber orchestra composition titled Serenade, and followed by three other Serenades, all written in 1932. Martinů also wrote a later Serenade in 1951 while living in the United States and focusing on orchestral writing. These compositions, which range in size from a trio to a small orchestra, feature between one and four solo violins in keeping with Martinů’s desire to experiment with instrumentation. Although the musical origins of a serenade suggest light-hearted music for the evening, and are especially evocative of a romantic greeting while passing the beloved’s balcony, Martinů has emphasized the importance of form in the neoclassical genre by adhering to a three-movement structure (fast-slow-fast) in this short work.\n\nThe opening of the first movement, “Allegro Moderato”, is characterized by off-beat accents in the string parts which play tricks on the listener’s sense of pulse, while the clarinet and horn trade lyrical moments. Thus, a rising line continues into an abbreviated development section before returning to the original rhythmic material. During the second movement “Larghetto”, the sustained notes in the wind parts, marked piano and pianissimo, colour the moving line of the violin trio until a tender solo in the clarinet signals that the movement is coming to an end. The final movement, “Allegro”, is fast and rhythmic, with short virtuosic solos for each instrument. The work concludes brightly and suddenly.\n\nMUSSORGSKY, MODESTE (1839-1881)\n\nPICTURES AT AN EXHIBITION (1874), ARR. ANDREW AGER\n\nCOMMISSIONED FOR, AND DEDICATED TO, DR. SHEILA AGER\n\nThere are only a few musical themes in the classical genre more iconic than the repeating Promenade from Mussorgsky’s ten-movement piano masterpiece, Pictures at an Exhibition. In the often-performed orchestral adaptation of this work, created in 1922 by composer Maurice Ravel, the Promenade is most prominently heard throughout the work as a trumpet solo, and as such, is a cornerstone of orchestral repertoire for the trumpet. In the arrangement performed at this concert, the Promenade is featured on various instruments throughout the ensemble.\n\nThe origin of Mussorgsky’s virtuosic Pictures at an Exhibition, and its posthumous publication are inseparable from the composer’s personal and professional difficulties. Mussorgsky enjoyed a friendship and a lively artistic exchange with Viktor Hartmann, the artist, architect, and designer who created the now-lost pictures, which inspired the composition. However, Hartmann’s sudden death in 1873, only a few years after the passing of Mussorgsky’s mother, and the family’s sudden impoverishment following Tsar Alexander II’s Emancipation Edict, troubled the composer deeply. During the late 1860s, Mussorgsky faced artistic estrangement and ostracism due to divergent musical ideals from The Mighty Handful, a group of five Russian composers including Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, César Cui, Mily Balakirev, and Alexandr Borodin. He descended further into addiction even as his most successful and well-loved work, the opera Boris Godunov, received multiple performances in spite of its lukewarm response from critics.\n\nNotwithstanding the challenges of this period in the composer’s life, Pictures at an Exhibition was written in only three weeks, during June of 1874. Updating a friend on the progress of the work, Mussorgsky breathlessly exclaimed — “Ideas, melodies, come to me of their own accord. Like roast pigeons in the story, I gorge and gorge and over-eat myself. I can hardly manage to put it all down on paper fast enough.” The music is famously representational of Russian folk tropes, such as the movement titled “Baba Yaga: The Hut on Fowl’s Legs”, and contains many evocative musical devices designed to produce a visceral response in the listener. While the work’s reception among Mussorgsky’s fans was overwhelmingly positive and enthusiastic, many of the composer’s colleagues were uncomfortable with the radicalness of Pictures at an Exhibition; a reaction which served to worsen Mussorgsky’s insecurities, and the work was not published until 1886 by Rimsky-Korsakov, five years following Mussorgsky’s death.\n\nRavel’s arrangement of the original work for piano was created at the behest of conductor Serge Koussevitzky shortly before his tenure as conductor of the Boston Symphony. In the orchestral version of Pictures at an Exhibition, the strange and wonderful imagery in Mussorgsky’s music is heightened by Ravel’s brilliant orchestration. The arrangement on this program, created especially for the Regina Symphony Chamber Players by Andrew Ager, is freely adapted from the original piano score for eleven musicians.\n\nProgram Notes by Tamsin Lorraine Johnston\n\nProgram Notes\n\nCOLEMAN, VALERIE (b. 1970)\n\nSeven O’clock Shout (2020)\n\nSeven O’Clock Shout is an anthem inspired by the tireless frontline workers during the Covid-19 pandemic, and the heartwarming ritual of evening serenades that brings people together amidst isolation to celebrate life and the sacrifices of heroes. The work begins with a distant and solitary solo between two trumpets in fanfare fashion to commemorate the isolation forced upon humankind, and the need to reach out to one another. The fanfare blossoms into a lushly dense landscape of nature, symbolizing both the caregiving acts of nurses and doctors as they try to save lives, while nature is transforming and healing herself during a time of self-isolation.\n\nWhen a composer has the rare opportunity to create for musicians they have gotten to know, the act of composing becomes an embrace tailored to the personality and capabilities of the musicians with elements of both challenge and appreciation. One such moment is dedicated to humanity and grace, as a clarinet solo written for Ricardo Morales, followed by a flute solo with both Jeffrey Khaner and Patrick Williams in mind, providing a transition into a new upbeat segment. Later, to continue tradition from the first commission the composer received from the orchestra, a piccolo solo dedicated to Erica Peel dances with joy.\n\nIt was suggested that a short work for a debut by multi-track recording could account for the ensemble performing together as if they were in the same room. One of the devices used to address this is the usage of Ostinato, which is a rhythmic motif that repeats itself to generate forward motion and in this case, groove. The ostinato patterns here are laid down by the bass section, allowing the English horn and strings to float over it, gradually building up to that moment at 7pm, when cheers, claps, clangings of pots and pans, and shouts ring through the air of cities around the world! The trumpets drive an infectious rhythm, layered with a traditional Son clave rhythm, while solo trombone boldly rings out an anthem within a traditional African call and response style. The entire orchestra ‘shouts’ back in response and the entire ensemble rallies into an anthem that embodies the struggles and triumph of humanity. The work ends in a proud anthem moment where we all come together with grateful hearts to acknowledge that we have survived yet another day.\n\nSTILL, WILLIAM GRANT (1895-1978)\n\nWood Notes (1948)\n\nCalled the “Dean of Afro-American Composers” and considered part of the Harlem Renaissance in the 1920s and 1930s, William Grant Still was a conductor, orchestrator, performer, and composer of nearly two hundred works. These included many large-scale orchestral works, choral works and songs, as well as solo pieces and chamber music. Choosing to leave the undergraduate program in Science at Wilberforce University, a historically-Black college in Ohio, Still used his inheritance from his father, supplemented with part-time work, to pursue studying at the Oberlin Conservatory of Music. Already a violinist, Still taught himself to play several other instruments including clarinet, saxophone, oboe, double bass, cello, and viola. His promising early compositions caught the attention of Oberlin’s composition faculty, even though he hadn’t been registered in the program. His composition training eventually led him to study privately with Edgar Varèse and George Whitefield Chadwick.\n\nLike many musicians of his era, Still’s musical life was interrupted by World War I. After serving in the United States Navy, he moved from Tennessee where he had been working in a Blues Band to New York, while keeping his employment with songwriter W.C. Handy. Living in Harlem allowed Still to connect with many influential Black artists, writers, philosophers, and activists such as Langston Hughes and Alain LeRoy Rocke, while playing in Broadway pit orchestras, arranging, and performing on various recordings. During this time, Still continued to compose his own music, and in 1931, his Symphony No. 1 Afro-American, was premiered by the Rochester Philharmonic under the baton of Howard Hanson, with whom Still enjoyed a lifelong friendship and close professional association, and who facilitated the premiere of many of Still’s works in Rochester.\n\nSymphony No. 1 Afro-American was extraordinarily successful. Not only was it the first time the complete score of a work by an African-American composer was performed by a major Symphony Orchestra, it also reached audiences in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, London, Berlin, and Paris over the next decade and a half. Until 1950 it was the most popular and frequently-played Symphonic work by an American.\n\nRelocating to Los Angeles in 1934, Still received a Guggenheim Fellowship. In the years that followed, he achieved many firsts, including being the first African-American composer to conduct a major symphony orchestra (LA Philharmonic) performing his own music, he was the first African-American to conduct a major orchestra (New Orleans Philharmonic) in the Deep South, and his opera Troubled Island was the first opera by an American composer to be performed by the New York City Opera, and the first opera by an African-American to performed by a major opera company.\n\nWood Notes, written in 1947 and premiered in 1948 by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, was inspired by the composer’s deep love and appreciation of nature, and also by the poetry of writer and clergyman J. Mitchell Pilcher. A harmonically lush four-movement pastoral suite for orchestra, Wood Notes evokes the natural world of the American South.\n\nPRICE, FLORENCE (1887-1953)\n\nPiano Concerto in D minor in One Movement (1934)\n\nFlorence Beatrice Price (née Smith), an organist and pianist, composed over three hundred musical works, including about one hundred songs. Her compositions range from large-scale orchestral works, including four symphonies and four concerti, to choral works, chamber and solo pieces. As a composer, she rose to prominence in her forties after winning a prize for her Symphony No. 1 in E Minor, which was premiered by the Chicago Symphony under the baton of Frederick Stock in 1932. This sudden success took place after years of teaching, playing organ for silent films, and writing songs for radio ads while raising two children on her own after divorcing her abusive husband.\n\nWhen living in the South during the Jim Crow era became untenable, she moved to Chicago in 1927 with her family. Price had lived in Little Rock, her hometown where fellow African-American composer William Grant Still had been her classmate, and briefly in Atlanta where she was head of the music department at Clark Atlanta University, a historically-Black college. Price was an exceptional student in Little Rock, graduating at age fourteen as valedictorian of her class, and going on to study at New England Conservatory of Music pursuing a double major in piano and organ, where she convinced the admissions department that she was of Mexican heritage to sidestep racial discrimination.\n\nBeing a thoroughly American symphonist, Price’s training and classical style is rooted in Romanticism following in the footsteps of Liszt, Mendelssohn, and in particular Dvorak. Her music is brimming with references to her faith as an African-American Christian, containing spirituals, gospel, blues, and rhythms recalling African Dance. The opening of the second part of Piano Concerto in D Minor in One Movement is very reflective and hymn-like; the work in fact features three movements meant to be performed without break. The version of the Concerto on this program is a re-construction by Trevor Weston of the 1934 premiere in which Price was the soloist, since the score and some of the parts are lost.\n\nIn fact, all of Price’s musical achievements were very nearly lost. Price knew better than anyone the barriers her musical legacy faced. It’s not known if her highly successful Symphony No. 1 was performed again after its premiere, and in a letter to Serge Koussevitzky, conductor of the Boston Symphony in 1943, she wrote: “To begin with, I have two handicaps — those of sex and race. I am a woman; and I have some Negro blood in my veins. I should like to be judged on merit alone.” However, in 2009, papers and works of Price’s were found in an old house in Illinois during a renovation project. The house had once been the composer’s summer home, and restoring it is rightfully restoring her reputation as a composer belonging to the canon of respected American symphonists.\n\nBEETHOVEN, LUDWIG VAN (1770-1827)\n\nSymphony No.5 in C Minor Op. 67\n\nOpening with one of the most recognized musical motifs in classical music history, Beethoven’s Symphony No. 5 is not only the most frequently performed Beethoven symphony, it is one of the most frequently performed orchestral works in the Western canon. The famous four-note opening motifs has transcended the symphonic oeuvre and found its way into other musical genres and popular culture generally. Its association with the Morse code for Victory (dot-dot-dot-dash) is purely coincidental; the Morse code usage came about decades after the symphony was written, but the reference to “Victory” has been culturally entrenched since World War II.\n\nBeethoven conceived the opening motif in its rhythmic character as representing Fate knocking at the door. Like Symphony No. 3 (“Eroica”), and Symphony No. 6 (“Pastorale”), Symphony No. 5 had a nickname, (“Schicksals-Sinfonie”), meaning Fate-Symphony in use for some time. Later Romantic-era compositions, including Tchaikovsky’s Symphony No. 4, also use musical symbolism to evoke the inevitability of Fate. It is believed that Beethoven’s choice of key, C Minor, was linked to the theme of destiny, and a recording of the first movement of Symphony No. 5, along with the fifth movement of Beethoven’s String Quartet No. 13, was included on the Voyager Golden Record, a disc sent into interstellar space in 1977 as part of a broad sample of human language and culture.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Symphony No. 5, widely considered a masterpiece, took four years to write between 1804 and 1808. Beethoven was very busy with a number of other projects, including the three Razumovsky String Quartets, commissioned by Beethoven’s patron, Russian diplomat, Count Razumovsky, to whom Symphony No. 5 is also dedicated. Symphony No. 5 was premiered at the same concert as Symphony No. 6 in December 1808. In fact, Symphony No. 6 was the opening work on a four-hour-long, not particularly successful performance of eight of Beethoven’s works.\n\nFollowing its publication in 1810, appreciation for Symphony No. 5 soared. In an ecstatic and breathlessly-reverential review by E.T.A. Hoffman, the experience of hearing the work live is described as follows:\n\nRadiant beams shoot through this region’s deep night, and we become aware of gigantic shadows which, rocking back and forth, close in on us and destroy everything within us except the pain of endless longing—a longing in which every pleasure that rose up in jubilant tones sinks and succumbs, and only through this pain, which, while consuming but not destroying love, hope, and joy, tries to burst our breasts with full-voiced harmonies of all the passions, we live on and are captivated beholders of the spirits.\n\nTo his credit, E.T.A. Hoffman was a very well-respected author, artist, and music critic who devoted the majority of the review to a critical analysis of the symphony, once he had regained his composure.\n\nProgram Notes by Tamsin Lorraine Johnston\n\nProgram Notes\n\nPON, AURA (B. 1981)\n\nROMP & REPOSE (2011)\n\nRomp & Repose was composed in 2010-2011 for its premiere by bassoonist Kelly Wood and the Symphony of the Kootenays in February 2011 in Cranbrook, BC. The music showcases the lyrical voice of the bassoon, with a sprinkling of jazz and blues idioms in acknowledgment of Kelly’s diverse background as a jazz saxophonist and classical bassoonist. It is dedicated to Kelly’s cat Sam and the composer’s cat Zippurr who passed away during the project, and while it would be oversimplifying to say the music became about the once frisky feline friends, the composer did take some inspiration from the quirky capricious essence of kitty spirit as an homage to them. Hence the two contrasting energies, which cats master so well, denoted by the title, Romp & Repose. It was subsequently performed by other bassoonists, including Karmen Doucette with the Okanagan Symphony Orchestra, Michael Hope with the Kensington Sinfonia, and Jonathan Gresl with the CalArts Orchestra.\n\nProgram Notes by Aura Pon\n\nPROKOFIEV, SERGEI (1891-1953)\n\nVIOLIN CONCERTO NO.2 IN G MINOR, OP.63\n\nSergei Prokofiev completed Violin Concerto No. 2 in 1935 as he was awaiting repatriation to his native Russia, having composed Violin Concerto No. 1 around the time that he first departed (with official permission) in 1917. For that reason, Violin Concerto No. 2 differs from the music Prokofiev wrote while living abroad in the United States and in France during the intervening years, in its modest dimensions and traditional form designed to convince Stalin that he no longer had an artistic use for “decadent formalism”.\n\nVery shortly before Prokofiev’s permanent relocation, and the Spanish Civil War, Violin Concerto No. 2 was premiered in Madrid, Spain in December of 1935 by French violinist David Soetens and the Madrid Symphony Orchestra led by Enrique Fernández Arbós. In what must have been a refreshing surprise for the composer at the time, the Spanish loved the work so much that a special delegation of musicians was sent to personally thank Prokofiev. This premiere, with its international cohort of musicians, undoubtedly helped Prokofiev believe, at least temporarily, that he could act as a musical ambassador between Europe and Soviet Russia.\n\nIt was also during this period that Prokofiev wrote Peter and the Wolf, Lieutenant Kijé, and Romeo & Juliet, three of his most famous works. In fact, there are numerous musical references to Romeo & Juliet throughout this concerto, particularly in the second movement, and more broadly in how the solo violin part is constructed to evoke the ballet. This era of composition in Prokofiev’s life demonstrates his extraordinary ability to adapt to the circumstances, political and otherwise, dictating his music-making. Working with Diaghilev’s Ballets Russes in Paris after a brief stay in the United States, Prokofiev was inspired to write opera, ballet, and large symphonic works such as Symphony No. 3 The Fiery Angel which showcases his interest in expressionism and large musical forms.\n\nHowever, much of his work at this time experienced production issues, an unenthusiastic reception, and of course drew negative attention from the Soviets. With an economic depression underway during the 1930s in the United States and Europe, which dampened his aspirations as an opera composer while forcing him to rely on touring income as a concert pianist, and tensions that soon led to World War II, Prokofiev sought a spiritual path in Christian Science that engendered a newfound simplicity and sincerity in his composition that seemed to pave the way for resettling in Russia.\n\nThe rules governing the arts were somewhat relaxed during the War years in Soviet Russia, and Prokofiev enjoyed a period of creativity and freedom in the works he produced. However, he found himself once again at odds with the Communist Party following the war and several of his compositions were banned. Nevertheless, he is considered one of the greatest composers of modern classical music, and both the State Music Academy and the Airport in Donetsk Oblast in Ukraine, where Prokofiev was born, have been named in his honour.\n\nRSO Box Office | (306) 586-9555 | reginasymphony.com | info@reginasymphony.com\n\nMOZART, WOLFGANG AMADEUS (1756-1791)\n\nSYMPHONY NO.39 IN E-FLAT MAJOR, K.543\n\nSymphony No. 39 by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart is believed to be the first in a set of three, all written in 1788 in Vienna, including Symphony No. 40, and Symphony No. 41 (“Jupiter”), the last symphony Mozart wrote. The Clarinet Quintet (K. 581) and the opera Così fan tutte were also written during this period and premiered in 1789 and 1790 respectively. It’s unclear whether Mozart heard Symphony No. 39 performed in his lifetime, although one theory holds that he attempted to organize a series of concerts in a casino which may have featured this work. The first recorded account, by Iwan Anderwitsch, of hearing Symphony No. 39 in 1792 in Hamburg, was as part of a memorial concert of Mozart’s music. About this experience, Anderwitsch had the following to say:\n\nThe opening is so majestic that it so surprised even the coldest, most insensitive listener and non-expert, that even if he wanted to chat, it prevented him from being inattentive, and thus, so to speak, put him in a position to become all ears. It then becomes [so] fiery, full, ineffably grand and rich in ideas, with striking variety in almost all obbligato parts, that it is nearly impossible to follow so rapidly with ear and feeling, and one is nearly paralyzed. This actual paralysis became visible in various connoisseurs and friends of music, and some admitted that they would never have been able to think or imagine they would hear something like this performed so splendidly in Hamburg.\n\nMozart did not live long enough to benefit either musically or financially from the success of his three late symphonies, which remain gems of the orchestral canon to this day. However, in the years leading up to the Austro-Turkish war in 1788, Mozart had hit his stride as a musician and entrepreneur. His final years of impoverishment were in fact a product of the war; without a robust local economy, the upper class was no longer in a position to spend their disposable income on the arts, preferring instead to relocate to country estates.\n\nSymphony No. 39 has several unusual features, which may have been a salute to a beloved friend, clarinetist and fellow Free Mason, Anton Stadler. Mozart had written for him the Clarinet Quintet in 1789, the (“Kegelstatt”) Trio K. 498 in 1786, obbligato solos in La clemenza di Tito K. 621 in 1791, and the stunning Clarinet Concerto K. 622 also in 1791. Symphony No. 39 prominently features a pair of clarinets, with several lyrical solos in the Minuet and Trio movement, which traditionally had belonged to the oboe section in 18th century music.\n\nWhile the Finale is crafted thematically to invoke fellow composer Joseph Haydn’s mischievous sense of humour, the first movement opens with an extended slow introduction. This is another stylistically unusual decision for Mozart, which may suggest he was coming to believe a symphonic work need not function solely as a stand-alone composition, but, by virtue of its structure, may belong in series with other multi-movement symphonic works. It’s seductive to believe that Mozart may have had a sixth sense of how the orchestra would grow and change dramatically over the following century.\n\nProgram Notes by Tamsin Lorraine Johnston"
