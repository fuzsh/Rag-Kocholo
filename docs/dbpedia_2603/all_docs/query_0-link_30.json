Valčuha leads ten of the eighteen classical subscription programs in the season, all highlighting the hallmarks that have quickly come to characterize Valčuha’s programming philosophy. Programming motifs and unifying concepts Bohemian Rhapsody, Vienna Calling, and Fairytales span multi-week appearances. Tribute is paid to the Houston Symphony’s rich legacy of music directors as two past music directors return to the Jones Hall stage: Christoph Eschenbach and Conductor Laureate Andrés Orozco-Estrada. Operatic repertoire (Duke Bluebeard’s Castle and a program of orchestral highlights from the operatic repertoire) takes its place alongside great choral works from the symphonic repertoire like Martinů’s Czech Rhapsody, Brahms’s Schicksalslied, and Mahler’s Third Symphony. Houston Symphony musicians, including Yoonshin Song, Joan DerHovsepian, Brinton Averil Smith, Jonathan Fischer, Colin Gatwood, Mark Nuccio, Christian Schubert, Rian Craypo, Elise Wagner, William VerMeulen, and Ian Mayton take the spotlight as soloists, and the Symphony welcomes the greatest guest artists in the world to Houston, including Tabita Berglund, Yefim Bronfman, James Ehnes, Pacho Flores, Kirill Gerstein, Ekaterina Gubanova, Hilary Hahn, Domingo Hindoyan, Capathia Jenkins, Leila Josefowicz, Bruce Liu, Simone Lamsma, Matthias Pintscher, Marina Prudenskaya, Sir Donald Runnicles, Dalia Stasevska, Byron Stripling, Cédric Tiberghien, and Michael Tilson Thomas. New works this season include a world premiere commissioned by the Houston Symphony: Karim Al-Zand’s Al-Jazari’s Ingenious Clocks, based on the fantastic inventions of the famed 12th-century Islamic polymath Ismail Al-Jazari.\n\n“Creating each season is a journey,” said Juraj Valčuha. “We find the right moments for a world-renowned soloist or music festival, we pay tribute to our musical legacy, and we honor our talent. We develop a beautiful mixture of musical colors by inviting our audience to experience something new and celebrating familiar masterpieces together. The unique orchestration of these elements defines how we will experience this incredible art form.”\n\n“The era of Juraj Valčuha at the Houston Symphony is in full swing,” said Executive Director/CEO, and holder of the Margaret Alkek Williams Chair, John Mangum. “The orchestra is artistically flourishing as we anticipate Juraj’s third second season as Music Director, with more insightful and creative programming that showcases the entire orchestra, the Chorus, and its soloist-caliber musicians. The Dallas Morning News said it best in a recent review, remarking that under Juraj’s baton ‘the Houston Symphony may be in for a new golden age.’” [Dallas Morning News, January 25, 2024]\n\nTHE 2024-25 CLASSICAL SEASON\n\nJuraj Valčuha opens the season October 4, 2024 (with additional performances October 5 and 6) with the first of three mini-festivals of the season, entitled Bohemian Rhapsody. Valčuha leads the massed forces of the Houston Symphony in Bohuslav Martinů’s Czech Rhapsody, a majestic cantata for orchestra, chorus and baritone soloist, here the renowned Czech baritone Svatopluk Sem. The Bohemian theme continues in Bryce Dessner’s pastoral reflection Mari and Dvořák’s iconic Symphony No. 9, From the New World. All three works on the program have both Czech and American connections, the Martinů and Dvořák works being written in America by Czech composers, and the Dessner work was written by an American composer with influences by the first movement of the Dvořák Ninth Symphony.\n\nOn Opening Night, October 4, the evening begins with a champagne reception before the Opening Night Concert at Jones Hall. Following the concert, the celebration continues at The Corinthian Houston with dinner and sensational entertainment. The Opening Night Concert and Gala, chaired by Mary Lynn and Steve Marks, are generously supported by ConocoPhillips, the lead concert sponsor and corporate gala underwriter for the 38th year.\n\nValčuha is back a week later (October 12 and 13, 2024) to continue the Bohemian Rhapsody Festival with violin virtuoso James Ehnes as soloist in Dvořák’s Violin Concerto. Two exceptional works for large orchestral forces expressing love for the Czech homeland complete the program: Janáček’s monolithic Sinfonietta, and Vitézslava Kaprálová’s Military Sinfonietta, of which Kaprálová herself remarked, “The composition does not represent a battle cry, but it depicts the psychological need to defend that which is most sacred to the nation.”\n\nInternationally renowned British conductor Sir Donald Runnicles makes his Houston Symphony debut leading the orchestra, Principal Viola Joan DerHovsepian, and Principal Cello Brinton Averil Smith in Richard Strauss’s delightfully luscious tone poem Don Quixote. The program opens with Wagner’s thrilling Overture to the opera Tannhäuser, and orchestral selections from Humperdinck’s Hänsel and Gretel. November 1, 2, and 3, 2024.\n\nThe musicians of the Houston Symphony take center stage November 23 and 24, 2024, with Concertmaster Yoonshin Song acting as soloist and leader in J.S. Bach’s Violin Concerto No. 1, and with Serenades by Mozart (Serenade No. 12) and Brahms (Serenade No. 1) providing musical conduits for the world-class talents of Jonathan Fischer, oboe; Colin Gatwood, oboe; Mark Nuccio, clarinet; Christian Schubert, clarinet; Rian Craypo, bassoon; Elise Wagner, bassoon; William VerMeulen, horn; and Ian Mayton, horn.\n\nVienna Calling is the second of Juraj Valčuha’s mini-festivals this season. Thanksgiving Weekend, Valčuha leads piano superstar Yefim Bronfman and the orchestra in Beethoven’s Piano Concerto No. 5, Emperor. Beethoven lived in Vienna from his early 20s until his death, and he composed the Emperor Concerto the year Napoleon’s siege of Vienna led all but Beethoven himself to flee the Austrian capitol. Austrian composer Franz Schubert’s Symphony No. 8, Unfinished, and Viennese composer Alban Berg’s Three Pieces for Orchestra, depicting the grandeur of the fading Austro-Hungarian Empire. November 29, 30, and December 1, 2024.\n\nJuraj Valčuha ushers in the holiday season early on December 7 and 8, 2024, continuing the Vienna Calling Festival with A Viennese Waltz Christmas, a program entirely comprising famous and beloved waltzes by Johann Strauss Jr. and his brother Josef Strauss, including the Overtures to Die Fledermaus and The Gypsy Baron, and the Blue Danube Waltz.\n\nBeloved former Houston Symphony Music Director Christoph Eschenbach is celebrating the 200th anniversary of Anton Bruckner’s birth in a unique way this season. Eschenbach is conducting all eight of Anton Bruckner’s symphonies with important orchestras across the globe, each symphony with a different orchestra. With the Houston Symphony, Eschenbach conducts Bruckner’s Symphony No. 4, Romantic, January 11 and 12, 2025, just a month before the Maestro’s own 85th birthday.\n\nHouston Symphony Concertmaster Yoonshin Song steps into the soloist spotlight for one of the best loved and most popular works in the violin repertoire: Beethoven’s Violin Concerto. Tabita Berglund makes her Houston Symphony debut on the podium for the Beethoven, as well as Anna Thorvaldsdóttir’s Metacosmos, and Tchaikovsky’s passionate, emotion-filled Symphony No. 6, Pathétique.\n\nFebruary finds Juraj Valčuha leading two opera-themed weekends. Viva Italia! Italian Opera Beyond Words (February 7 and 9, 2025) features orchestral music from well-known operas like Verdi’s Macbeth, Rossini’s William Tell (the famous overture), and Puccini’s Manon Lescaut, Suor Angelica, and Madama Butterfly, as well as little-known operas such as Casella’s La donna serpente, and Respighi’s Belfagor.\n\nOne week later on February 15 and 16, 2025, Juraj Valčuha leads the orchestra, mezzo-soprano Ekaterina Gubanova (Judith), and baritone Gábor Bretz (Bluebeard) in a semi-staged concert performance of Bela Bartók’s shattering, psychodramatic masterpiece Duke Bluebeard’s Castle. Valčuha continues the operatic theme of this program with Prokofiev’s Symphonic Suite from The Love for Three Oranges on this program, as well as Benjamin Britten’s hauntingly lyrical Four Sea Interludes from Peter Grimes, and Unsuk Chin’s Prelude to the Mad Tea Party from Alice in Wonderland.\n\nDrawing upon its rich legacy of past music directors that includes Leopold Stokowski, Sir John Barbirolli, André Previn, and Christoph Eschenbach, the Houston Symphony welcomes back Andrés Orozco-Estrada to the Jones Hall stage. Orozco-Estrada joins one of his favorite artistic collaborators, violin luminary Hilary Hahn, and the Houston Symphony for one of the most technically brilliant works in the violin repertoire: Brahms’s Violin Concerto. The Houston Symphony Chorus joins Orozco-Estrada and the orchestra for Brahms’s Schicksalslied (Song of Destiny), and the program concludes with Richard Strauss’s monumental tone poem Also sprach Zarathustra. March 7, 8 and 9, 2025.\n\nMarch brings a two-week festival of works about and inspired by Fairytales. Dutch violin star Simone Lamsma joins Juraj Valčuha and the orchestra for Korngold’s Violin Concerto. Filled with melody from the Hollywood “dream factory,” Korngold’s concerto draws upon themes from Hollywood golden age films like Another Dawn and The Prince and the Pauper starring Errol Flynn, Juarez starring Bette Davis, and Anthony Adverse starring Olivia De Havilland. Prokofiev’s Cinderella ballet suite is also on the program on March 14, 15, and 16, 2025, as is the Houston Symphony-commissioned world premiere of Karim Al-Zand’s Al-Jazari’s Ingenious Clocks, based on the fantastic inventions of the famed 12th-century Islamic polymath Ismail Al-Jazari.\n\nThe second week of Fairytales (March 21, 22, and 23, 2025) finds piano luminary Kirill Gerstein joining Valčuha and the orchestra for Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini, Rachmaninoff’s fantastic musical tale of the legendary violinist Paganini’s deal with the devil and his doomed love for a woman. Anatoly Lyadov’s symphonic fairy tale The Enchanted Lake, and Alexander Zemlinky’s fantasy for large orchestra, The Mermaid (inspired by Hans Christian Anderson’s The Little Mermaid) complete the program.\n\nStar violinist Leila Josefowicz performs Stravinsky’s daring neoclassical violin concerto, with Dalia Stasevska making her Houston Symphony subscription concert debut conducting the orchestra April 18 and 19, 2025. Stasevska also conducts the orchestra in John Adams’s vigorous and engaging Short Ride in a Fast Machine, and Sibelius’s majestic Symphony No. 5. Beethoven’s ebullient and wildly popular Symphony No. 7 shares the program with Takemitsu’s Twill by Twilight and Mozart’s Piano Concerto No. 20, as Kansas City Symphony Music Director Matthias Pintscher takes the Jones Hall podium May 1, 3, and 4, 2025, with special guest pianist Cédric Tiberghien.\n\nMay 9, 10, and 11, 2025, Domingo Hindoyan makes his Houston Symphony debut conducting a program of Latin American and Spanish-influenced works, including Roberto Sierra’s Alegría, Debussy’s Ibéria from Images, and Ravel’s famed Boléro. Trumpet soloist Pacho Flores joins them in his Houston Symphony debut for two concertos written especially for him: Arturo Márquez’s Concierto de Otoño (Autumn Concerto) and Paquito d’Rivera’s Concierto Venezolano (Venezuelan Concerto).\n\nJuraj Valčuha welcomes rising young piano star and 2021 Chopin Piano Competition 1st Prize Winner Bruce Liu to the Jones Hall stage in his Houston Symphony debut, to perform Chopin’s expressive and highly virtuosic Piano Concerto No. 1 with the Houston Symphony, May 23, 24, and 25, 2025. Valčuha leads the orchestra in Schumann’s triumphant, lyrical Symphony No. 2 to close the program.\n\nFor the classical season finale, Juraj Valčuha has chosen Gustav Mahler’s monumental anthem to nature, his Symphony No. 3, featuring mezzo-soprano Marina Prudenskaya and the Sopranos and Altos of the Houston Symphony Chorus. May 30, 31, and June 1, 2025.\n\nLivestreaming\n\nThe first major American orchestra to both livestream and welcome live audiences back to the concert hall for the entirety of the 2020–21 Season, the Houston Symphony has livestreamed both subsequent seasons. It remains committed to livestreaming its 2024–25 Season to a broad audience in more than 45 countries and all 50 states, one of few American orchestras dedicated to transmitting live performances to a sizeable audience outside its home city through this technology.\n\nLivestream of Houston Symphony concerts is made possible by Barbara J.

With sharp baton technique and natural stage presence, the impressive ease of his interpretations translates even the most complex scores into immersive experiences. His profound understanding of composer and score, taste, and naturally elegant style make him one of the most sought-after conductors of his generation.\n\nIn September 2022, Valčuha assumed the post of Houston Symphony Music Director. Since 2016 he has been Music Director of the Teatro di San Carlo, Naples and First Guest Conductor of the Konzerthausorchester Berlin. He was Chief Conductor of the Orchestra Sinfonica Nazionale della RAI from 2009 to 2016.\n\nThe 2005–06 Season marked the start of his international career with exciting concerts on the podium of the Orchestre National de France followed by remarkable debuts in the United Kingdom with the Philharmonia London, in Germany with the Munich Philharmonic, and in the United States with the Pittsburgh Symphony. His Italian debut took place at Teatro Comunale in Bologna with a sensational production of La bohème.\n\nHe has since led the Berlin Philharmonic, Dresden Staatskapelle, Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra, hr Frankfurt Radio Orchestra, Munich Philharmonic, the NDR Elbphilharmonie Hamburg, the Vienna Symphony, Czech Philharmonic, Swedish Radio Symphony, Orchestre de Paris, Orchestre National de France, BBC Symphony, Philharmonia London, Amsterdam Royal Concertgebouw, Rotterdam Philharmonic, Maggio Musicale in Florence, Orchestra dell’Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia in Rome, Milan’s Filarmonica della Scala, Montréal Symphony, and NHK and Yomiuri orchestras in Tokyo. His active career in the United States has taken him to the orchestras of Boston, Chicago, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Dallas, Indianapolis, Los Angeles, St. Louis, and Utah. He enjoys regular collaborations with orchestras in Minnesota, New York, Pittsburgh, and San Francisco.\n\nInternational touring with the Orchestra Sinfonica della RAI took them to the Musikverein in Vienna and the Philharmonie in Berlin, as well as Cologne, Düsseldorf, Zurich, Basel, and Munich, and to the Enesco Festival in Bucharest, and to Abu Dhabi Classics. He has also toured with the Konzerthausorchester Berlin to Riga, Vilnius, and Tallinn to mark the 100th anniversary of the Baltic nations.\n\nValčuha champions the compositions of living composers and aims to program contemporary pieces in most of his concerts. He has conducted world premieres including Christopher Rouses’s Supplica with the Pittsburgh Symphony and Steven Mackey’s violin concerto with Leila Josefowicz and the BBC Symphony in Manchester. In 2005 he conducted, in the presence of the composer, Steve Reich´s Four Sections at the Melos-Ethos Festival in Bratislava. Other composers he has supported and continues to follow with interest are Bryce Dessner, Andrew Norman, Luca Francesconi, James MacMillan, and Steven Stucky, among others.\n\nOn the opera stage, he has conducted Madama Butterfly, Elisir d‘amore, and Marriage of Figaro at the Bayerische Staatsoper Munich; Faust and The Love for Three Oranges in Florence; Jenufa, Peter Grimes, and Salome in Bologna; La bohème in Venice; and Elektra, Carmen, Bluebeard’s Castle, Die Walküre, The Girl of the Golden West, Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk, Katja Kabanova, and Pique Dame in Napoli. In January 2020, he conducted an opera production of Tristan and Isolde at Teatro Comunale in Bologna, at the end of which the complete lockdown was introduced in most European countries. However, he was privileged during the pandemic year to conduct many livestreamed performances with Teatro San Carlo (Tosca with Anna Netrebko and Cavalleria Rusticana with Elina Garanca and Jonas Kaufmann), RAI Orchestra in Turin, Orchestre National de France, Konzerthaus Berlin, and NDR Orchestra Hamburg. In the United States he was one of the few conductors to travel from Europe and make music with the Dallas, Houston, Minnesota, and Pittsburgh orchestras.\n\nJuraj Valčuha was awarded the Premio Abbiati 2018 from Italian Music critics in the category Best Conductor.\n\nBorn in Bratislava, Slovakia, he studied composition and conducting in his birthplace, then at the Conservatory in St Petersburg (with Ilya Musin), and finally, at the Conservatoire Supérieur de la Musique in Paris.\n\nAbout the Houston Symphony\n\nUnder Music Director Juraj Valčuha, the Houston Symphony continues its second century inspiring and engaging a large and diverse audience in Houston and beyond through exceptional musical performances, and creating enduring impact in the Houston community. One of the oldest performing arts organizations in Texas, the Symphony held its inaugural performance at The Majestic Theater in downtown Houston on June 21, 1913. Today, with an operating budget of $37.8 million, the full-time ensemble of professional musicians presents more than 130 concerts annually, making it the largest performing arts organization in Houston. Traditionally, musicians of the orchestra and the Symphony’s three Community-Embedded Musicians also offer over 1,000 community-based performances each year at various schools, community centers, hospitals, and churches, annually reaching more than 200,000 people in Greater Houston.\n\nAfter suspending concert activities in March 2020, the Symphony successfully completed a full 2020–21 season with in-person audiences and weekly livestreams of each performance, making it one of the only orchestras in the world to do so. The Houston Symphony remains committed to livestreaming its 2023–24 Season to a broad audience in over forty-five countries and all 50 states, one of few American orchestras dedicated to transmitting live performances to a sizeable audience outside its home city through this technology. The Grammy Award-winning Houston Symphony has recorded under various prestigious labels, including Koch International Classics, Naxos, RCA Red Seal, Telarc, Virgin Classics, and, most recently, Dutch recording label Pentatone. In 2017, the Houston Symphony was awarded an ECHO Klassik award for the live recording of Alban Berg’s Wozzeck under the direction of former Music Director Hans Graf. The orchestra earned its first Grammy nomination and Grammy Award at the 60th annual ceremony for the same recording in the Best Opera Recording category. The Symphony’s most recent recordings include a Pentatone release in January 2022 of its world premiere performances of Jimmy López Bellido’s Aurora and Ad Astra, and a Naxos release in July 2023 of its world premiere performance of Jennifer Higdon’s Duo Duel."
