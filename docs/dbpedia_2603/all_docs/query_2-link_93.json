Any recs\n\n| would be appreciated.\n\nThe Turnovsky Martinu 4th must be one of those, easily regarded as a classic\n\nrecording, that has converted many people to Martinu.\n\nKuchar on Naxos has very good sound for all the symphonies, and captures the\n\nMartinu essence, and for a touch more idiomacy, and perhaps flow and\n\nmomentum, imo, then Neumann on Supraphon is excellent, but without the\n\nsonority, and capture of the lower registers and detail (catching the piano\n\nso beloved of Martinu) of sound, that Kuchar gets. By the same token Kuchar\n\nis no match for Neumann in the quirky (atypical) 6th symphony, but this\n\nsymphony can always be supplemented. At any rate, I find Kuchar well worth\n\nthe modest outlay.\n\nAs already mentioned, then there are the following Martinu works that are\n\nworth considering, just for some examples of works other than his six\n\nsymphonies :-\n\nLes Fresques de Piero Della Francesca\n\nConcerto for 2 String Orchestras, Piano and Timpani\n\nSinfonietta Giocosa for Piano and Small Orchestra\n\nInventions (for piano and orchestra)\n\nAs you have found, there is a life-enhancing quality about much of Martinu's\n\nmusic, but he has his darker side too.\n\nRegards,\n\n# http://www.users.bigpond.com/hallraylily/index.html\n\nSee You Tamara (Ozzy Osbourne)\n\nRay, Taree, NSW\n\nJ.

Any recs\n\nwould be appreciated.\n\nTIA\n\nJack\n\nMy personal discovery of Martinu was about 7 years ago when as a\n\nviolinist, I participated in a performance of the 4th Symphony. I was\n\nreally hooked then and quickly acquired all the symphonies. Since\n\nMartinu was extraordinarily prolific, it is hard (and expensive) to\n\nkeep up with a truly broad sample of his works. As a string player I\n\nnaturally gravitated to his violin/viola works. I really like\n\nthe Viola Sonata #1 (which I subsequently learned to play). I have\n\nnever heard any reference to subsequent viola sonatas.\n\nI like the two violin concerti (though I like #2 better) I\n\nparticularly like the Concerto-Rhapsody for Viola and Orchestra.\n\nThere is a really interesting double violin concerto.\n\nI have been begging the conductors of the three orchestras I play in\n\n(all non-pro) to program some Martinu but to no avail so far. (The\n\nconductor of the Symphony has moved on.)\n\nJon Teske\n\nSteve Emerson\n\nPost by J. Teske\n\nAs a string player I\n\nnaturally gravitated to his violin/viola works.

Teske\n\nI really like\n\nthe Viola Sonata #1 (which I subsequently learned to play). I have\n\nnever heard any reference to subsequent viola sonatas.\n\nI think the Viola Sonata #1 is one of Martinu's finest chamber works.\n\nThere was a superb recording by Philip Naegele and Ralf Gothoni on LP\n\nin a Da Camera Magna collection of Martinu chamber music. Most of the\n\nperformances in that series (I have five volumes) have never been\n\nbettered, but I do not think that any of them have appeared on CD.\n\nAC\n\nHeck51\n\nJack Crawford wrote -\n\n\"Where should I go next with Martinu's orchestral stuff?
