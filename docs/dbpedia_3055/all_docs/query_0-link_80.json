Third title card\n\nPre-release version.\n\nScooby-Doo, Where Are You! is an American animated mystery comedy television series created by Joe Ruby and Ken Spears. It was produced by Hanna-Barbera (H-B) for CBS' Saturday morning children's programming. Every episode was produced and directed by Hanna-Barbera founders, William Hanna and Joseph Barbera. It ran from 1969 to 1970, airing 25 episodes that spanned two seasons. The name was brought back by ABC for eight episodes in 1978 (constituting a third season of sorts), although these are usually better known for being part of The Scooby-Doo Show. The series has been rerun on Cartoon Network and Boomerang, and spawned several spin-offs, TV specials, and films.\n\nScooby-Doo, Where Are You! is about the exploits of four teenagers (damsel in distress Daphne, brainy Velma, nervous hippie Shaggy, brave leader Fred) and their Great Dane named Scooby-Doo who usually happen to walk into a mystery usually involving the exaggerated crime of a criminal (who can be anything between a real-estate developer or jewel thief), who tries to cover up his misdeeds by dressing up as a ghoulish monster. Clues are left in its wake, which the kids (dubbed Mystery Incorporated in later incarnations) find and put together, leading to the discovery of who the culprit is, which the local authorities are unable to do themselves. A large part of the premise of the series is the bungling of Scooby and his owner, Shaggy, who inevitably run into and accidentally capture the monster in one of Fred's intricately devised traps, despite trying to do everything to avoid it.\n\nThe entire series has been released on both DVD and Blu-ray Disc.\n\nProduction\n\nDevelopment\n\nFred Silverman, head of daytime/children's programming at CBS, was inspired by the 1940s radio show I Love a Mystery, and elements of the CBS sitcom The Many Lives of Dobie Gillis.[1] Joseph Barbera also tried to do it as the 1934 film House of Mystery, but he felt that it was \"too bland.\"[2]\n\nJoe Ruby and Ken Spears, past editors at Hanna-Barbera, were tasked with creating the story for the show, while Iwao Takamoto designed how each character would look. The concept draft was that Geoff Jones, Mike Andrews, Kelly Summers, Linda Blake, and Linda's brother W.W. attend Laguna Beach High in Southern California. When not attending school, they are a band and mystery solvers called Mystery's Five, with the bongo-playing mascot Too Much, a big shaggy dog.[3]\n\nToo Much was changed to a Great Dane called Scooby-Doo, to avoid comparisons to Marmaduke. \"Scooby-Doo\" apparently came from Silverman, who was on a plane one day listening to Frank Sinatra sing \"Strangers in the Night,\" although according to Takamoto in his book My Life with a Thousand Characters, there was another dog called Scooby he saw in the Hanna-Barbera archives dating back to the early 1960s.[4]\n\nW.W. was also removed, while Linda became Daphne, Kelly became Velma, Mike became Shaggy, and Geoff became Ronnie and finally Fred (at the behest of Silverman). The idea of them being in a band was removed as well as the high school setting, with only the implication that they still live in California. After the spookiness was ill-received, Scooby was put at the forefront, with the working title of Who's S-S-Scared? now called Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!\n\nCasting\n\nFrank Welker was doing a Friskies dog food commercial when he was informed by the casting agent's fiancé that she was casting for Scooby-Doo, Where Are You![5] He initially went in to read for Scooby-Doo,[6] but was told not to worry, as that would go to H-B veteran Don Messick.[5] He also wanted to audition for Shaggy Rogers, who he found more appealing than the \"guy in an ascot.\" Casey Kasem also came into an audition for Fred, but Hanna-Barbera preferred the actors in the opposite roles.[5] Barbera advised Welker to just use his own voice because he and Fred were around the same age, and to think of Jack the All-American Boy.[6]\n\nKasem auditioned for Shaggy a few times, drawing inspiration from both KRLA disc jockey Dave Hull and Richard Crenna's performance as Walter Denton in the film Our Miss Brooks.[7]\n\nNicole Jaffe was spotted by Gordon Hunt when she was playing Peppermint Patty in a stage production of You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown. She had no aspirations in voice acting, simply taking the job because she needed to make a living.[8] She adlibbed Velma's catchphrase, \"Jinkies.\"[6]\n\nStefanianna Christopherson was the first to voice Daphne, but left after the first season to get married. She was replaced with Heather North, who auditioned at the suggestion of her roommate at the time, who just happened to be none other than Jaffe.[9]\n\nMusic\n\nThe theme song's lyrics were written by David Mook, while Ben Raleigh wrote the music, which was performed by Larry Marks in the first season, then by George A. Robertson, Jr. in the second. The music was composed by Ted Nichols, who was credited as the musical director. Also in the second season, La La Productions produced seven \"chase songs\" set to bubblegum pop genre, which were also performed by Robertson Jr., and written mainly by Danny Janssen, with contributions from both Robertson Jr. and Susan Steward.\n\nEpisodes\n\nTitle Original air date 1x01\n\n\"What a Night for a Knight\"\n\nSeptember 13, 1969 1x02\n\n\"A Clue for Scooby-Doo\"\n\nSeptember 20, 1969 1x03\n\n\"Hassle in the Castle\"\n\nSeptember 27, 1969 1x04\n\n\"Mine Your Own Business\"\n\nOctober 4, 1969 1x05\n\n\"Decoy for a Dognapper\"\n\nOctober 11, 1969 1x06\n\n\"What the Hex Going On?\"\n\nOctober 18, 1969 1x07\n\n\"Never Ape an Ape Man\"\n\nOctober 25, 1969 1x08\n\n\"Foul Play in Funland\"\n\nNovember 1, 1969 1x09\n\n\"The Backstage Rage\"\n\nNovember 8, 1969 1x10\n\n\"Bedlam in the Big Top\"\n\nNovember 15, 1969 1x11\n\n\"A Gaggle of Galloping Ghosts\"\n\nNovember 22, 1969 1x12\n\n\"Scooby-Doo and a Mummy, Too\"\n\nNovember 29, 1969 1x13\n\n\"Which Witch is Which?\"\n\nDecember 6, 1969 1x14\n\n\"Go Away, Ghost Ship\"\n\nDecember 13, 1969 1x15\n\n\"Spooky Space Kook\"\n\nDecember 20, 1969 1x16\n\n\"A Night of Fright is No Delight\"\n\nJanuary 10, 1970 1x17\n\n\"That's Snow Ghost\"\n\nJanuary 17, 1970 2x01\n\n\"Nowhere to Hyde\"\n\nSeptember 12, 1970 2x02\n\n\"Mystery Mask Mix-Up\"\n\nSeptember 19, 1970 2x03\n\n\"Jeepers, It's the Creeper\"\n\nSeptember 26, 1970 2x04\n\n\"Scooby's Night with a Frozen Fright\"\n\nOctober 3, 1970 2x05\n\n\"Haunted House Hang-Up\"\n\nOctober 10, 1970 2x06\n\n\"A Tiki Scare is No Fair\"\n\nOctober 17, 1970 2x07\n\n\"Who's Afraid of the Big Bad Werewolf\"\n\nOctober 24, 1970 2x08\n\n\"Don't Fool with a Phantom\"\n\nOctober 31, 1970\n\nRelease\n\nDates are in order of release:\n\nUnited States: September 13, 1969 at 10:30 am on CBS\n\nCanada: November 1, 1969 at 10:30 am\n\nUnited Kingdom and Ireland: September 17, 1970 at 5:20 pm on BBC One\n\nCast\n\nDon Messick as Scooby-Doo\n\nCasey Kasem as Shaggy Rogers\n\nFrank Welker as Fred Jones\n\nStefanianna Christopherson (season 1) and Heather North (season 2) as Daphne Blake\n\nNicole Jaffe as Velma Dinkley\n\nCredits\n\nThese identical credits appeared at the end of every episode.\n\nSeason one\n\nProduced and directed by: Joseph Barbera and William Hanna\n\nAssociate producer: Lew Marshall\n\nStory: Ken Spears, Joe Ruby, Bill Lutz\n\nStory director: Howard Swift\n\nAnimation director: Charles A.

It also included the origin of how Scooby was adopted from a pet store.\n\nAfter the last spin-off, A Pup Named Scooby-Doo, died out in 1991, the franchise laid pretty much dominant until 1998, when Hanna-Barbera revived it with the direct-to-video film Scooby-Doo on Zombie Island, that had the gang grown out of their mystery solving phase and found real jobs as adults, only to get together again to solve a real supernatural mystery. The movie was successful in the video market, and Hanna-Barbera was able to produce three others, with Warner Bros. as their distributor. These first four dropped the signature outfits of Daphne and Fred, giving them a mature look.\n\nWhen Hanna-Barbera ceased operations in 2001, Warner Bros. could officially use their own animation department, Warner Bros. Animation, and since 2003, have returned to the familiar nostalgic look presented in Scooby-Doo, Where Are You! essentially continuing the series in movie form (similar to when feature-length films would continue where Star Trek: The Original Series and Star Trek: The Next Generation left off).\n\nThese include:\n\nScooby-Doo! and the Legend of the Vampire (2003)\n\nScooby-Doo! and the Monster of Mexico (2003)\n\nScooby-Doo!

Haunted Holidays (2012)\n\nScooby-Doo! and the Spooky Scarecrow (2013)\n\nScooby-Doo! Mecha Mutt Menace (2013)\n\nScooby-Doo! Ghastly Goals! (2014)\n\nScooby-Doo! and the Beach Beastie (2015)\n\nIn 2002, after being in several script stages since the 1990s, Warner Bros. Pictures released a big screen live-action adaptation called Scooby-Doo, followed by the 2004 sequel, Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed. There were also two other live-action movies made for the DVD market and TV, with the first being the prequel Scooby-Doo! The Mystery Begins in 2009, which was followed by the next year with the sequel, Scooby-Doo! Curse of the Lake Monster. In 2018, there was another DVD origin story produced with the female-led Daphne & Velma. *cricket* What's notable about the movie is not just its emphasis on female empowerment (which happens to be during the Me Too movement), which nobody is saying is a bad thing, but had to do it without having Shaggy or Fred, or even Scooby-Doo. Oh, if only there was a way around having independent young women without losing the rest of the team.\n\nIn 2020, Warner Bros. Pictures rebooted Hanna-Barbera's properties into a unified cartoon universe called Scoob!, which presented a new take on Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!\n\nThere have also been television reboots in the form of Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated, Be Cool, Scooby-Doo!, and the adult-oriented Velma, all firmly set in their own isolated universes as reboots usually are; although Mystery Incorporated made such a big impact on Warner Bros. Animation that the feature-length direct-to-DVD films have had several references, which evidently made the continuity of A Pup Named Scooby-Doo no longer possible. But then again...\n\nWhen The Lego Group licensed the property to manufacture toys, they also collaborated with Warner Bros. Animation to release the TV special, Lego Scooby-Doo! Knight Time Terror (2015), and two DTVs, Lego Scooby-Doo! Haunted Hollywood (2016) and Lego Scooby-Doo! Blowout Beach Bash (2017).\n\nScooby-Doo, Where Are You! was eventually continued in a loose way with Scooby-Doo and Guess Who?, from 2015 to 2019.\n\nIn 2021, The CW aired a prime-time \"reunion special\" (despite never spending time apart, as pointed out by Velma) called Scooby-Doo, Where Are You Now!\n\nSeveral Hanna-Barbera and Cartoon Network Studios-related series have also referenced Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!:\n\nIn the Dexter's Laboratory episode \"Book 'Em,\" in which Dexter and Dee Dee pretend to be books to escape library security.\n\nIn the The Powerpuff Girls episode \"Midnight at the Mayor's Mansion,\" the chase through the hallway doors is a parody of chases like those in Scooby-Doo, Where Are You! The Mayor even says Shaggy's catchphrase, \"Zoinks,\" while passing the screen inside a pink van reminiscent of the Mystery Machine.\n\nAt the end of The Amazing World of Gumball episode \"The Spinoffs,\" Rob reads some text off of Timmy, the Internet, finding a show to replace Gumball that would be something akin to Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!, with a Great Dane and his \"kooky friends\" who solve mysteries in a van.\n\nIn popular culture\n\nWARNING: The following section contains content that may be seen as mature or offensive to some readers.

This was written by Tom Minton, who later did a similar skit for Animaniacs, mentioned below.\n\nIn The Super Mario Bros. Show episode \"20,000 Koopas Under the Sea,\" in true Mystery Inc. fashion, Mario and his friends discover that the sea monster is mechanical and being driven by Koopa Nemo, who was trying to scare the citizens of Happy Harbor into making them their king. Having failed, Koopa says, \"And it would have worked if you 'buttinskis' hadn't messed things up!\"\n\nIn the film Slacker, a slacker talks about how Saturday morning cartoons are teaching kids bribery with Scooby-Doo, wherein Shaggy will bribe Scooby with Scooby Snacks to get what he wants. When that slacker says he'll buy the round of beers if the other slacker buys him a pack of cigarettes, the other slacker tries to turn it into an ironic Scooby Snacks bribe.\n\nIn Judge Dredd: The Megazine #13-#15, the \"Red Razors\" arc, Chief Judge Ricky sends a group of Sov-Block freelance enforcers who call themselves the Spooky-Doo Gang to retrieve the corpse of Elvis Presley. They drive the Mystery Machine, but the van is blue and some of the letters are flipped. By the last issue, Shabby/Shaggy and Barbara/Velma have been killed by mutant judges, leaving Spooky/Scooby, Freddy/Freddy, and Hannah/Daphne to successfully find Elvis's corpse.

They transition back to Wayne's basement, where they unmask Benjamin to really be Old Man Withers, who runs the haunted amusement park. Angered by them, he declares, \"And I would have gotten away with it, too, if it hadn't been for you snooping kids!\" Pleased with the outcome, Garth says to Wayne in a Scooby-like voice, \"Good one, Shaggy,\" and Wayne replies that it was an \"excellent Scooby-Doo ending.\"\n\nIn the Darkwing Duck episode \"Clash Reunion,\" when Megavolt captures Launchpad, Gosalyn, Ham, and and Preena in his life-size lightbulb, he proclaims, \"At last!

A couple of times after that, Oswald talks in Scooby's voice.\n\nIn the Night Man episode \"The House of Soul,\" Jessica believes the House of Soul may be haunted, but Raleigh just makes fun of her by comparing it to Scooby-Doo.\n\nIn the film Divorcing Jack, Dan wears a wavy blond wig as a disguise at the Dolphin Hotel, which only gets him more attention when the M.C. calls him out, by asking the audience, \"Hey, did anyone watch Scooby-Doo? There's Shaggy at the bar.\"\n\nIn the film Can't Hardly Wait, Walter is told by another stoner that Velma from Scooby-Doo didn't get \"much play.\"\n\nIn the Student Bodies episode \"Snowed In,\" Mags finally finds Scooby-Doo to bond with Flash over, who describes it as \"sheer brilliance.\" They then sing the theme song, when their friends come in, who are surprised the two are getting along, are asked what the nature of Scooby and Scrappy's relationship is, and why a hot girl like Daphne is hanging around a loser like Shaggy, but Romeo's answer is simply is that she is hot, before their friends leave them to sing the theme song again.\n\nIn the Rugrats episode \"Runaway Reptar,\" Angelica's plan is thwarted when her robotic Reptar's synthetic skin peels off, so she declares, \"I would have gotten away with it if it wasn't for those meddling babies.\"\n\nIn the Spaced episode \"Beginnings,\" Daisy wanders into Tim's bedroom after hearing a noise and is spooked by his alien mask. Tim finds her and she keeps on saying she heard a noise, so Tim says she was playing Scooby-Doo. She says she used to play as Daphne when she was little, as did Tim play as Freddie when he was younger, but now Tim and Daisy look more like Shaggy and Velma. When the scene transitions and the outside of their flat is shown, the music to the beginning of The New Scooby-Doo Movies plays, instead of Scooby-Doo, Where Are You! As a final piece of trivia, in the last episode, \"Leaves,\" Tim and Daisy also own toys of Shaggy and Velma.\n\nIn the Arthur segment \"The Rat Who Came to Dinner,\" Mr. Ratburn shows Arthur one of his old tapes of Spooky-Poo, while staying at Arthur's house while his roof is repaired.

Fez, the first one to talk, after the transformation, sarcastically says, \"Zoinks. That'd be super, Fez.\"\n\nIn the Daria episode \"I Loathe a Parade,\" the lion mascot who was harassing Daria and Tom collapses from wearing the suit for too long causing him to suffocate.

This is distracting to Miranda, who is working, so she tells him to turn it down and when he isn't cooperative, she wants him to turn it off, leading her to believe that he isn't mature enough to have a baby. During the debate, she gets frustrated with Steve, asking if they can have a discussion without Scooby-Doo, but Steve is caught up in the episode, which he says is about a ghost in a salt mine (despite that not being the case), and then fools around trying to do Shaggy's voice, saying, \"But, Scoobs, what about the ghost?\" The Creeper can be heard off-screen, as well.\n\nIn the Digimon: Digital Monsters episode \"Iron Vegiemon,\" the Digimon Emperor reacts to the DigiDestined destroying a control spire by saying, \"What?!

When all three are found, the Time Squad and the monsters run through the \"Scooby-Dooby-doors.\" In the end, all of the monsters are captured with a single chandelier, and the Time Squad reveals that they are just the disguises of then current President William Howard Taft, Vice President James S.

Isles ridicules Rizzoli for returning to this subject, but Rizzoli is tickled by it, and lets out a little \"Zoinks.\" Isles and Rizzoli debate the show's repeated plot formula and unrealism of a talking dog, which doesn't impress Isles but entertains Rizzoli, who defends it.\n\nThe series is parodied in the Austin & Ally episode \"Mysteries & Meddling Kids,\" when while at a disco party, Dez and his friends dress up as his favorite characters from a 70s cartoon called Groovy Goat and the Mystery Bunch. While there, Ally's songbook is stolen and an investigation ensues just like an episode of Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!, with the old librarian being unmasked to reveal Ally's rival in disguise, who yells in defeat, \"And I would've gotten away with it, too, if it wasn't for you meddling kids...and your goat!\"\n\nIn the Uncle Grandpa episode \"Misfortune Cookie,\" after Uncle Grandpa gets a fortune cookie that tells him that someone close to him is an enemy in disguise, he proceeds to rip off all his friends' faces, until he discovers that the culprit is himself, or the pizza delivery boy hiding inside Uncle Grandpa's own body, who did it because he didn't receive a tip.\n\nIn the online comic Girl Genius #15, Du Quay begins to say, \"-And I would've got away with it, too, if it hadn't been for-\", before he's told to shut up.\n\nIn the film Characterz, once the park director's scheme of setting up the mascots has been discovered, he says, \"And I would have gotten away with it, if it hadn't been for you meddling kids.\"\n\nIn the Clarence episode \"Spooky Boo,\" the kids check out a spooky house on Halloween, which old man Howard uses as an excuse to scare the kids while wearing a sheet and making eerie sound effects commonly heard in Hanna-Barbera cartoons, particularly Scooby-Doo, Where Are You! when the kids are running away from monsters.\n\nIn the Annoying Orange web short \"Ask Orange #19: Christmas T-N-Tree,\" Marshmallow demands a zillion doll hairs or he will destroy the kitchen.

Mavis and Skipper are driven by an old man in The Mystery Ship, who resemble Mabel, Dipper, and Grunkle Stan, respectively. When Mavis discovers her sweater is haunted, their green, talking dog, Soosy Du, pops up behind them. Soosy Du is a parody of Soos Ramirez, Dipper and Mabel's friend. The Mystery Kids Mysteries is designed to match the quality and budget of Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!, and the outfits and Googie architecture are based on The Jetsons.\n\nIn the Regular Show episode \"The Dream Warrior,\" Mordecai and Rigby try to settle Pops from his nightmare by watching Funkie Wunky and the Groovy Gang, which features parodies of Mystery Inc. called the Groovy Gang, Groovies for short, who own a dog called Funkie Wunky.

While building the diorama, Eric says \"Scooby-Dooby-Doo\" in Scooby's familiar tone of voice. Ben and Eric successfully build their diorama of Fred, Shaggy, and Scooby unmasking an old guy from his monster guise outside an old mansion and graveyard, with the Mystery Machine next to them. Interestingly, when the finished diorama was revealed, it had a bad voiceover of Shaggy saying, \"Great Caesar's ghost,\" which he had never said. Guest judge Sophie Monk had to guess correctly what the show was to get Ben and Eric three bonus points. After a couple of guesses, she was able to deduce it was Scooby-Doo by identifying it as, \"The van from the dog show.\" Ryan the judge thought they could've added an extra layer by adding a ghost to the haunted mansion, but was impressed that they included the Mystery Machine which was an iconic telling point.\n\n1000 Ways to Die\n\n\"Cure for the Common Death, Part II:\" Luke Wiggins moved into the country for some peace, but didn't realize he had moved next to a state park with a popular jogging trail, so he dressed up as the sasquatch to scare away runners.\n\n\"Tweets from the Dead:\" Two men sneak into a former brothel that is supposed to be haunted, so they can find the spirit of dead prostitutes to have sex with them.

One of the shows parodied is a spoof of Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!, titled Uhuru, Where Are You! The sound effects are there and the Warners do an impromptu rock song. Due to the Warners' interference, it's inevitably one of several HB-like shows that fail in the ratings.

And his partner, Officer Cuffy.\"\n\nBuffy the Vampire Slayer\n\nBuffy and her friends' exploits in fighting monsters eventually led Xander to first officially coin the name the Scooby Gang in the season two episode \"What's My Line?

He wraps it up quickly with a final thought that Shaggy would've gotten away with it, too, if it wasn't for his pesky friends.\n\n\"Episode Six\" (series 2): Prime Minister Tony Blair hires the kids (Shaggy and Velma with Scooby) to investigate who has been leaking his private memos from his office. Velma deduces that the suspect could be Mo Mowlam, Gordon Brown, Robin Cook, or Alistair Campbell, who all work in his cabinet. But after hearing all the suspects, he writes in his press release that the caretaker disguised as a pirate was trying to scare him away from the gold mine at the disused fairground.\n\n\"Episode Two\" (series 3): The Larry Markes version of the \"Scooby-Doo, Where Are You?\" theme song sets up a sketch involving Shaggy, Scooby, and Velma capture the Headless Horseman, who they believe to be the old caretaker, Mr. Jamison, but when they unmask the monster it is really Carol Smillie, host of Changing Rooms. Shaggy then thinks he's seen another apparition, but Smilie points out that it is designer Linda Barker. They were making a haunted mansion motif, which included a hidden treasure buried in the basement, and they used the Headless Horseman to scare them away.

A segue with an element of The New Scooby-Doo Movies theme song, reveals that Russell Crowe and John Gielgud have taken on the roles of Shaggy and Scooby, respectively, in a case at an abandoned fairground haunted by Mr. Johnson to keep people away from the gold mine. Despite playing Shaggy, Crowe still has shaken his previous role of Maximus Decimus Meridius from Gladiator (a recurring gag on Dead Ringers), and when he responds to Velma, he paraphrases Maximus's famous quote, \"My name is Maximus Decimus Shaggimus. Owner of a cowardly dog [Scooby], friend to a suspiciously gay-looking man [Fred]. And I would've had my vengeance, but I was, like, really scared. Zoinks!\" He then wants to celebrate with Scooby, saying, \"This, like, calls for Scooby Snacks. Scooby, at my signal, unleash your tongue and wrap it around a very tall sandwich.\" Scooby just says, \"Scooby Scooby Dooby. Scooby Dooby Dooby, Raggy.\"\n\n\"Episode Three\" (series 7): The Larry Markes version of the Where Are You! theme song sets up another misadventure, where Velma reads to Shaggy the violations of the new Cartoon Animal Bill of Rights for unnecessary and prolonged exposure to haunted houses, spooky fairgrounds, and white-haired caretakers called Mr. Jameson, as well as health grounds as for the past 30 years, Shaggy has only been feeding Scooby Snacks to Scooby, and mental cruelty for inflicting Scrappy-Doo.

Velma is suspicious it's not Livingstone and his face is really a mask hiding Tony Blair, who was pretending to be Livingstone to make London more unpopular. Defeated, he groans, \"And I would've gotten away with it, too, if it wasn't for you pesky young voters.\" Scooby cheers by saying, \"Scooby-Dooby-Doo!\"\n\n\"Episode Four\" (series 9): Reporter Kirsty Wark reveals that the politicians (including Iain Duncan Smith and Ann Widdecombe) are falsely trying to turn the public against cartoon characters \"sneaking\" into the UK through \"the channel\" Nickelodeon had summoned all of the reporters at a spooky, abandoned fairground while dressed as ghosts.

Just then, Simon Cowell pops up. Fred uses this as an opportunity to ask Cowell about how tricking Britain into voting for Matisse, the Border Collie, when the best tricks were done by a stunt double, but Cowell retorts that it was easy when Britain has got nothing better to do on a Saturday night. Revealed as the evil genius that he is, Cowell responds with the classic line, \"And I would've gotten away with it too, if it wasn't for you pesky kids, and Ofcom.\" Not quite done, Cowell reveals that Scooby being a talking dog is a trick by him, too.

The Clue Crew arrive in their Clue Cruiser right after Timmy and the fairies enter, with the fairies going from parodies of Mystery Incorporated like Timmy to parodies of Scooby. Several tropes and conventions are followed, such as Snooper the dog's Shaggy-like friend jumping into his arms after they all spot a monster, and run into the nearby spooky mansion which has bats flying out of it. Inside, they participate in the Scooby-Dooby-doors (with an accompanying pop song), Snooper and his friend eat, and the Velma doppelganger loses her glasses. They catch the monster and unmask it.

Like, keep running man!\"\n\n\"The Wand That Got Away:\" While on the search for Cosmo's wand, the gang gets into Spark's \"groovy\" van (resembling the Mystery Machine) he won from a 1970s game show. This gives Cosmo the idea, with Wanda's wand, to turn them into Mystery Inc. When they track it down to Crocker's house, they split up and run into monsters (and Crocker's mother). Crocker thinks the wand is fake when he wishes to be a zillionaire, causing an oil spill outside, which he doesn't see as helpful, but when he realizes it was real he says to himself, \"And I would've gotten away with it, too, if it weren't for those meddling kids.\" When the gang is back at Timmy's, Wanda is relieved they won't have to solve any more mysteries, which is followed by Sparky crying, \"Rooby-Rooby-Roo!\" But Sparky insists he says this right before seeing a giant pigeon smack into a window, such as the one Mr. Turner transformed into is about to do. Mr. Turner reacts by saying, \"Zoinks! I broke my jinkies!\"\n\n\"Let Sleeper Dogs Lie:\" Sparky kept a DVD of his previous owners, which included a group of kids resembling Mystery Incorporated who solved mysteries.

The episode is called \"Bendee-Boo Meets the Spooky Kabuki,\" which is full of allusions to production limitations, canned laugh track, gags, tropes, assumed inside jokes, a 60s pop song during a Scooby-Dooby-doors moment, and Bender, Fry, Leela, Amy, and Hermes as parodies of Scooby-Doo, Shaggy, Daphne, Velma, and Fred, respectively, who drive the Planet Express ship in the shape and colors of The Mystery Machine. There are also celebrity guests in George Takei, the Harlem Globetrotters, and Larry Bird. Takei turns out to be the monster, who tells the gang, \"And I would never have gotten away with it, regardless of you meddling kids,\" because according to himself, he is mentally ill.
