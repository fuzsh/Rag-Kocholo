The opinions I share are my own.\n\nAN ALL-NEW ORIGINAL ANIMATED FILM\n\nAVAILABLE ON DIGITAL AND DVD\n\nSEPTEMBER 14, 2021\n\nFROM WARNER BROS. HOME ENTERTAINMENT\n\nGrowing up I loved Scooby-Doo, and whenever a new movie or special came up, I couldn't wait to watch it with my family. Now, that I have a family of my own, I am excited to relive one of my childhood favorite characters/movies with my girls, thanks in part to Warner Bros. Home Entertainment always releasing new Scooby-Doo movies for us to enjoy together.\n\nThis past Friday, I was surprised to find Straight Outta Nowhere: Scooby-Doo Meets Courage the Cowardly Dog in the mail for me to review. I knew that it was releasing, but forget with all the craziness of summer, that it was releasing on Sept. 14th to DVD and Digital. But, as soon as I saw it and showed my girls, we all agreed that this was the DVD we would watch for our movie night. This new Scooby-Doo release also contains 3 bonus episodes that will delight kids and adults alike. We ended up watching the full length movie, and then sat for the 3 extra bonus episodes for our movie night. And, once we got to the end, both of my girls were all smiles as they loved it all. It was hard to choose a favorite of the bonus episodes. And, they all agreed at the full length movie was great. Scooby-Doo and friends were there to save the day and investigate, and there was so much adventure and laughs from start to finish. We definitely will be watching this movie again soon, and time and time again.\n\nDoes your family love Scooby-Doo? If so, you will definitely want to pick up this upcoming DVD release, or buy on Digital tomorrow, when it releases, and enjoy with your family.
