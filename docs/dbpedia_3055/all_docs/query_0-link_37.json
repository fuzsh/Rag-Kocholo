        "text": "Micky and friends put on a revue for the orphans. Donald recites nursery rhymes, but the orphans torment him. Horace, Goofy, and Clarabelle do a dance number. Donald tries again. Clara clucks a song while Mickey plays piano (with support from an unseen orchestra). Donald returns, and the orphans finally send a parade of bricks and eggs on balloons over him and use slingshots to drop them on his head.\n\nMickey and an early version of Donald Duck are police officers chasing dognapper Pegleg Pete. Despite their bumbling, they manage to repeatedly get the drop on Pete at his sawmill hideout, though they ultimately make a shambles of the place.\n\nMickey is a frustrated bandleader dealing with obnoxious peanut vendor and flute player Donald, who tries to persuade the band to play \"Turkey in the Straw,\" and a cyclone hits before his concert of \"William Tell Overture\" is completed.\n\nMickey, Donald and Goofy are firefighters. As you might expect, their attempts at fighting a boarding house fire are not particularly effective. They hear Clarabelle singing in the bathtub and rescue her, tub and all, against her will (she won't believe there's a fire).\n\nMickey and friends have various levels of enjoyment skating on a frozen river. As Mickey and Minnie glide romantically, Donald plays tricks on Pluto and ends up in trouble himself with a kite, from which Mickey must save him.\n\nMickey and Donald take a truckload of mouse boys on a picnic. The boys delight in tormenting Donald, first by filching the picnic food, then giving him a flower with a bee inside (Donald eventually gets the whole hive after him), and finally a sandwich with another bee in it.\n\nMickey is preparing to conduct an opera when he chases Pluto away. Pluto crashes into a magician's props backstage and spars with the hat, its rabbits, and its doves. The opera begins: Clarabelle plays flute, Clara and Donald are the leads in a Romeo and Juliet style opera, \"Bella Figlia Dell'Amore\" from Verdi's Rigoletto. Pluto follows the magic hat onstage, to Mickey's growing annoyance. The hat falls into a tuba, and soon the animals are filling the stage.\n\nMickey Mouse and Donald Duck, with the help of Goofy the iceman, try to move out before the sheriff can sell off their furniture.\n\nMickey is ringmaster of a circus for orphans. Donald has a trained sea lion act, and does a bit of juggling himself. Mostly, though, he fights with a baby sea lion who keeps stealing both the fish and the show. Donald then finds himself and Mickey in an unrehearsed high wire act, which kicks into high gear when one of the orphans electrifies the wire. They end by doing a high dive into the seals' tank.\n\nPlumber Donald is using a large magnet in his work. When he drops it, it causes trouble for Pluto, especially after Pluto swallows it. Things begin clinging to him, especially his metal dog dish.\n\nDonald is courting Daisy (called Donna, here in her first appearance) Duck in Mexico. He arrives on a burro, which doesn't get along at all well with her; she convinces him to buy a car. They head through the desert, but the car breaks down, and throws Donald out, then takes off on its own with Daisy trapped inside the rumble seat. The car hits a rock, throwing Daisy into a mud puddle, to Donald's excessive amusement. Daisy pulls a unicycle from her purse, and rides off.\n\nDonald continually heckles Mickey's magic act, but Mickey bests him at every turn. Donald shoots off a magic pistol that causes all the stage props to fall down on them at the finish of the act.\n\nGoofy (front) and Donald (rear) are dressed in a female moose suit, trying to lure a moose for hunter Mickey. When they do find one, it turns out to be more than they can handle.\n\nMickey, Donald, and Goofy are cleaning a large clock. Among the complications: Mickey fights a sleeping stork that doesn't want to leave, Donald gets tangled up in the main-spring, and Goofy is inside the bell when the clock strikes four.\n\nDonald is the baggagemaster at a remote railway station. Part of the latest cargo shipment is Hortense the Ostrich, who is a bit too friendly with Donald, and who eats everything in sight, whether it's food or not (mostly not): a concertina, an alarm clock, some balloons, all of which start reacting when Hortense gets the hiccups.\n\nMickey, Donald and Goofy run the \"Ajax Ghost Exterminators\" agency. They receive a call from lonely and bored ghosts to come to their house where they are scared silly by the hilarious haunts and taunts of these spirited pranksters."
