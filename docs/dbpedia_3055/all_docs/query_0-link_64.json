        "text": "Who's got the sweetest disposition?\n\nOne guess, guess who...\n\nWho never, ever starts an argument?\n\nWho never shows a bit of temperament?\n\nWho's never wrong, but always right?\n\nWho'd never dream of starting a fight?\n\nWho gets stuck with all the bad luck?\n\nNo one -- but Donald Duck!\n\nThe Ensemble Darkhorse of the Classic Disney Shorts, Donald Fauntleroy Duck is one of history's most famous cartoon characters.\n\nDonald first appeared in the Silly Symphonies short The Wise Little Hen in 1934, where he played one of the lazy animals in the fable, refusing to help the Hen make her bread and was thus denied a reward at the end. His distinct voice, given to him by Clarence \"Ducky\" Nash, singled him out for stardom. He quickly became a bit player in several other shorts before finally landing a role alongside Mickey and Goofy in 1935's Mickey's Service Station.\n\nFrom there, he took off, gaining a supporting cast. In 1937's Don Donald he got a girlfriend, Donna (who was replaced by Daisy Duck in Mr. Duck Steps Out in 1940). In 1938 his \"darling nephews\" Huey, Dewey, and Louie came for a visit (officially in 1938's Donald's Nephews, but the story had been told in the comics a few months earlier). The nephews' mother, Donald's twin sister Della,[1] was never seen or heard from again, and Donald became their permanent foster parent. The next year, Donald's Cousin Gus, introduced Gus Goose, his cousin.\n\nDonald was nearly the complete opposite of Mickey. Unlike The Everyman, he was brash, quick tempered, and loaded with faults. Because of this, audiences loved him, and responded to him very positively. In 1939 he got his own Newspaper Comic, and in the 1940s Carl Barks began making an entire comic universe based around him. Barks' role was eventually inherited by Keno Don Rosa, and the stories by these two creators are the only ones that are officially considered canon within the Disney comics universe.\n\nWorld War II was especially good to Donald. A series of Wartime Cartoons showed him enlisting in the army, and he won his only Academy Award for Der Fuehrer's Face in 1943. It was also during the 1940s that he was featured in four entries in the Disney Animated Canon: Saludos Amigos, The Three Caballeros, Fun and Fancy Free, and Melody Time.\n\nAfter theatrical shorts fell out of favor his appearances slowed, but he was never quite out. He appeared in DuckTales (1987) as a supporting character, and starred in Quack Pack. Appeared in a famous crossover with Daffy Duck in Who Framed Roger Rabbit?, got a segment in Fantasia 2000, reappeared with the gang in Mickey, Donald, Goofy: The Three Musketeers, and in 2005 he got a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. He also came back in Mickey Mouse Works and, more recently, Mickey Mouse Clubhouse. He appeared as a court mage in Kingdom Hearts, to say nothing of the few games he got to himself, such as the fondly remembered Quackshot.\n\nAnd naturally, there are the comics. Donald Duck, unlike Mickey, has a specific universe associated with him. Whereas Mickey's father simply appears to be Walt Disney within the Disney franchise mythology, Donald's official family tree is very extensive and under strict canon rules. In many countries, Donald has his own weekly or monthly comic books and magazines: Double Duck and Paperinik New Adventures, to name a few. These comics often show just how much of a Badass that \"loser duck\" can be.\n\nFILMOGRAPHY\n\n1934\n\nThe Wise Little Hen, released on 9 June 1934 – in a Silly Symphony cartoon\n\nOrphan's Benefit, released on 11 August 1934 – in a Mickey Mouse Cartoon, also remade and released on 22 August 1941\n\nThe Dognapper, released on 17 November 1934 – in a Mickey Mouse cartoon\n\n1935\n\nThe Band Concert, released on 23 February 1935 – in a Mickey Mouse cartoon\n\nMickey's Service Station, released on 16 March 1935 – in a Mickey Mouse cartoon\n\nMickey's Fire Brigade, released on 3 August 1935 – in a Mickey Mouse cartoon\n\nOn Ice, released on 28 September 1935 – in a Mickey Mouse cartoon\n\nCock o' the Walk: November 30, 1935, Ben Sharpsteen: In a Silly Symphony short.

and not in theaters\n\nTropes used in Donald Duck include:\n\nAdaptation Expansion: Carl Barks was challenged to take the classic 8-minute short Trick or Treat and adapt it for a 32-pages comic book story...And he succeeded. Not only did he invent great gags that were cleverly spun between the scenes of the original film, even elaborating on events that happened off-screen in the cartoon; he also justified Donald's Jerkass behavior toward his nephews, explaining that Don thought of youngsters bothering him for candy as an unwelcome violation of his privacy, Halloween or not...Plus, his proposed beginning has the nephews breaking into their uncle's house to flat-out steal his candy. It also has a more uplifting ending, where Donald warms up to the holiday and decides he’ll go trick-or-treating himself next year.\n\nAlliterative Name: Subverted as soon as you discover Don's middle name, Fauntleroy.\n\nAltum Videtur: The lawyer in The Golden Helmet lives and breathes this trope - at least until Donald tells him to \"in aqua concus dipporum\".\n\nAnd I Must Scream: The end of \"Donald's Snow Fight\", where Donald is frozen alive.\n\nAngrish: Very fluent speaker at that!\n\nArt Evolution: He emerged with his trademark sailor suit and feather/beak colors already, but he was much more close in look to a real duck, with his plumper body and larger neck. From 1936 onwards, he was redesigned to have more depth and a rounder shape. An easy way to confirm this is to compare Don's second appearance with the short's remake 7 years later.\n\nBanned in China: Not an actual example, but there's a popular rumor that he was banned in Finland for not wearing pants. Strangely, the choice of Finland in the urban legend might have to do with Donald Duck being really popular in Scandinavia.\n\nBadly-Battered Babysitter: Whenever he has to babysit Shelby the Turtle, or his nephews. Or anything.\n\nBig Red Devil: There have been many times when he's angry that he's resembled a devil. The cartoons \"Rocket Ruckus\", \"Trombone Trouble\", and \"Soup's On\" are just a few.\n\nBizarre and Improbable Golf Game: The title couldn't be any more misleading, but it's the premise for Donald's Golf Game, where Don's nephews start putting tricks on their uncle to entertain themselves, completely ruining the evening for him. All in the name of comedy!\n\nIn a clear example of Characterization Marches On, Donald's nephews are out to help their uncle to defeat his cousin Gladstone Glander via a golf game. Interestingly, they're not even needed, as Don is lucky for once, completely pulverizing Glander in said game!...It doesn't last.\n\nMore golf games appear in other comics and newspaper strips, and a House of Mouse short has Chip and Dale screwing the duck's fun by putting metal on his ball, keeping him from hitting it with a magnet's help.\n\nBlatant Lies: The theme song for the cartoons.\n\nBlinding Flash: In \"Grand Canyonscope\", Donald asks the ranger to photograph him atop his burro. The flash blinds the burro, leaving him stumbling along the steep Grand Canyon trail.\n\nButt Monkey:\n\nBy the Lights of Their Eyes\n\nCartoony Eyes: Blue scleras in animation, white ones in the comics.\n\nCharacter Celebrity Endorsement: Donald never drank orange juice in the cartoons, not even once, but that doesn’t stop him from lending his name and image to Florida Natural Growers’ orange juice since 1940.\n\nTo a lesser extent, Donald Duck is also licensed for the University of Oregon football team's (\"the Ducks\") merchandise.\n\nChaste Toons\n\nThe Chew Toy: Donald in most of the cartoons he was in.\n\nNo one--but Donald Duck!"
