        "text": "Pets are always a topic of conversation, but when the mood changes from âWhatâs your favourite breed?â to âHey! What are some good movies about dogs?â you know itâs time for Netflix. Here are some great choices for dog lovers to get you started.\n\n1. Benji\n\nBenji is a heart-warming movie that will tug at your soul. Benji is an adorable mixed-breed dog that always seems to find himself in the right place at the right time. When two siblings get themselves into serious trouble, Benji comes and stays with them and fixes all their problems.\n\nWhat starts off as a simple friendship develops into something much deeper for everyone.\n\n2. The Secret Life of Pets\n\nMax, a Jack Russell Terrier, lives in a New York apartment with Katie, his owner. He hangs out with various friends among the other pets who live in his same building. When Katie brings home Duke, a mongrel, Max becomes jealous. Tired of Maxâs attitude, Duke tries to abandon Max in an alley where they are both attacked by Sphynx, the alley cat. Sphynx steals their collars and leaves them to be captured by Animal Control. Itâs a heart-warming film about true friendship. Hence, a great family movie to enjoy.\n\n3. Hotel For Dogs\n\nAndi and Bruce are orphan siblings in foster care. Their foster parents do not allow pets into their home. To keep their dog, Friday, they end up meeting new friends, renovating a deserted hotel and adopting a whole load of abandoned dogs.\n\nHotel For Dogs is an adorable story that teaches kids the importance of taking care of others, even if they differ from you.\n\nA sure recipe for a great adventure on Netflix!\n\n4. Balto\n\nBalto is an epic story loosely based on a true story of a dog who helped save children with diphtheria in the 1925 run to Nome. Balto is half-dog, half-wolf, which makes him a pariah among people and dogs.\n\nWhen all the children in Nome are in hospital with diphtheria during particularly harsh weather conditions that prevent ships or planes from arriving. Only a train that stops 483 miles away can bring the antitoxin. It becomes a race against time, and only the best sledge dogs are chosen. Balto isnât because of his half-wolf blood. But when the going gets tough, only Balto can save all the children.\n\nWith a fantastic cast of voice actors and lively animation, it is a thrilling and sentimental adventure film for all the family.\n\n5. Homeward Bound\n\nThree siblings each own a pet. When their mother remarries and moves them temporarily to San Francisco, the kids have to leave the pets behind with a friend on her ranch. Because of a misunderstanding, the pets find themselves alone and very homesick. So, they decide to go find their owners.\n\nThe journey of these three pets through the wilderness to find their owners will make you laugh, cry, and cheer up all over again!\n\n6. Pup Star\n\nPup Star is a family-friendly musical regarding a Yorkshire Terrier who competes in a singing contest but gets separated from her owner. A dognapper tries stealing the pup for ransom. Thinking her owner has died in the attempt, the dog hitchhikes rides all over America to try to win the contest in her honour.\n\nA film full of fun, perfect for dog lovers of all ages.\n\n7. Arctic Dogs\n\nIt is a computer-animated comedy about an Arctic Fox who dreams of becoming the Top Dog in the courier company he works for. Watch as he goes through many adventures to prove himself worthy, with help from his other animal friends, of course! A great movie to watch!\n\n8. Pup Star â Better Together\n\nPup Star: Better Together is a family-friendly film that has been ranked as one of the best dog movies on Netflix. The story is about Tiny, a Yorkshire Terrier who has won the Pup Star singing competition and finds herself in an adventure when she gets replaced by a street Yorkie. The two dogs swap lives and end up realising that life is truly better together.\n\n9. Patrick the Pug\n\nMeet Patrick the Pug, a movie about an ordinary young lady with hectic life who needs to look after her grandmotherâs precious pug left in her care. The dog upturns her existence but helps her find her joy for life again.\n\nThe story holds important moral messages. No matter our situation, there will always be someone out there looking out for us, especially when times are hard.\n\n10. Pup Academy\n\nThe Pup Academy is a training facility for dogs and their owners in a parallel world. Here, they learn to become dogs and to form the ultimate bond between dogs and humans. But because the bond is powered by the Canis Primus constellation that is fading, it is being lost. Three dogs, a stray puppy, a prophecy and saving the academy are the ingredients for a very entertaining film for all the family.\n\nSumming Up\n\nWe hope you enjoyed this list of the best dog movies on Netflix!
