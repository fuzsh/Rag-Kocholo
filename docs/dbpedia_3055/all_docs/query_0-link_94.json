Educators, in their efforts to promote and evaluate reading, often ask students to respond to a book through activities that demonstrate having read and understood the material. One of the most valuable responses is wanting to read another book by the same author. Connections between the author and what students are reading promote more reading and students' own writing. Creating increasingly self­motivated readers and writers is the ultimate goal. This book provides information about authors most read by young readers in elementary or middle school. Information is biographical, accompanied by a selected book list and suggestions for more reading about the author. Other reference sources include these popular authors as well, most often through a multivolume set of references that are written over a period of years. Thus, to obtain information on the current most popular authors students needed access to several volumes of a reference work. Even with that access, the information for authors profiled in early volumes is seriously out of date. Every effort has been made to have the information about each of the authors included in this book be as up­to­date and accurate as possible. For more than a dozen years I have profiled authors and illustrators in books and periodicals. I have interviewed hundreds of authors and have listened to many of them speak at national or state conferences. For authors included in this book, I have relied heavily on my previous writings, interview notes, and notes from their presentations at conferences. Quotes are from these sources. Further research updated recent publication information and future plans of the authors. Although I have included selected book lists as part of each author's chapter, I did so only to provide readers with a sample of titles to associate with the author. As each author continues to write (even books by Laura Ingalls Wilder are been adapted, repackaged, and republished), new books are added each publishing season. Readers wishing to have a complete and up­to­date list of a particular author's publications can now access that information in minutes by going to the Library of Congress's Catalog on the World Wide Web. The catalog can be accessed at http://www.loc.gov. Suggestions for further reading include articles and, where appropriate, websites that provide more information about the author and the author's writing. Do keep in mind that although websites\n\nPage xxx\n\ncan often provide up­to­date information, the sites can also disappear quickly. All the websites listed here were accessible during the three months before the manuscript was completed. When you access the website, you may wish to print a personal copy of an ''author file\" for future reference. Some choices for author inclusion seem obvious. As an educator, I have worked with over 12,000 young readers choosing and selecting books to read and enjoy. Authors such as Laura Ingalls Wilder have enjoyed a high level of popularity for decades. Some names are new, but most likely will not be as long lasting as Wilder. Beverly Cleary has been another constantly popular author for at least two decades. She was also at the top of the survey used to confirm our choices. The list of authors selected for inclusion was based, in general, on the results of a national 1997 survey designed to identify the 100 most important authors and illustrators in children's literature. Survey responses came from both teachers and students. The results were reported originally in Library Talk (January/February 1998). The 1997 survey was based on one survey conducted by Don Gallo in 1988. In the spring of 1989, Gallo published the survey results of 41 educators who had served as officers of the Assembly on Literature for Adolescents (ALAN) of the National Council of Teachers of English. Lin Buswell and I decided to expand the population invited to participate, and to include younger groups of readers. The first major step was to construct a preliminary list of authors and illustrators. The criteria for choosing authors and illustrators to share with young readers seem to be as numerous as the authors themselves. No person or group can create an uncontroversial list of authors and illustrators that all children must read before passing through a specific age or grade. Any list leaves out some local favorites every choice is relative. Any selection is bound to show biases of the group making the preliminary selections. We attempted to diversify selections and reflect current trends in children's literature. We narrowed the list by using the advice of hundreds of educators and students. Upon publication of the survey for \"authors of novels/information books for young readers\" in a national journal, completed forms began to arrive. The survey attracted participants from 41 states, two Canadian provinces, and Saudi Arabia. More than 3,000 completed surveys were submitted and clear patterns began to emerge. Recognized by over 98 percent of respondents, Beverly Cleary topped the list. No other author received recognition by more than 90 percent of respondents. The next group included: Judy Blume, R. L. Stine, and E. B. White and was recognized by 80 percent or more of respondents. Three more were recognized by 70 percent or more of the respondents. This group included Roald Dahl, A. A. Milne, and Laura Ingalls Wilder. Sixteen authors were recognized by 50 percent or more of the respondents while an additional eleven were recognized by 40 percent or more. Among the top 27 (those recognized by 40 percent or more) were contemporary writers such as Shel Silverstein and Lois Lowry, as well as classic writers such as Lewis Carroll and C. S. Lewis. The remainder\n\nPage xxxi\n\nwere recognized by a lesser percentage of respondents but none by less than 16 percent. We included other authors based on years of observation and informal interviews with young readers. Because of the types of books written or the nature of biographical information, author­information demanded a slightly different treatment in their respective chapters. I felt that some of the book lists needed to be annotated—a brief indication of the book's topic/theme—while others seemed self­explanatory based on the title or genre written by the author. So, while each author chapter has standard information—biographical sketch and a section titled ''Books and Notes\"—the \"Books and Notes\" section will vary somewhat in format. In the same way, the ''For More Information\" sections also vary depending on available information. In each case I have attempted to provide information that will entice readers into the books mentioned. I hope you will find here those special motivational connections between young readers and a particular author and author's books. Connecting books and authors and readers is the ultimate goal. SHARRON L. MCELMEEL CEDAR RAPIDS, IOWA\n\nPage 1\n\nDavid A. Adler Mystery and Adventure • Biographies • Jewish Culture\n\nNew York, New York April 10, 1947 • Cam Jansen Mysteries • Picture Book Biographies Series About the Author and the Author's Writing It was a two­and­a­half­year­old nephew, visiting one Sunday, who nudged David Abraham Adler into the world of children's books. ''[He] asked me one question after another. I tried to keep up with him, to answer all his questions, but he didn't stop. Often he didn't even wait to hear my answer to one question before he asked me another. When he left, I wrote some of his questions in my journal along with my answers. That led to my first book, A Little at a Time [Random, 1976]. It's the story of a small boy going for a walk to a museum with his grandfather and continually asking questions. It was while I was teaching that I wrote my first book for children.\" The book had no punctuation at all, no periods or commas, and was all dialogue. He sent the book to Random House \"because Random House had the most children's books on the shelves in the stores.\"\n\nPage 2\n\nSince that year, Adler has written many kinds of books with several publishers. He says, ''I've written a few riddle and puzzle books. I've also written science, math and economics books and biographies.\" A biography of Golda Meir, Our Golda, the Story of Golda Meir (Viking, 1984) was his first biography. He used a very old set of encyclopedias in his research for that book. That set of encyclopedias and other rare books have been used in his research. In addition to his popular mystery/adventure series, Adler is well known for his Picture Book Biography series and has written several focusing on traditions and holidays in Jewish culture. Puzzles, rebuses, and riddles are also popular subjects for Adler's writings. David A. Adler was born April 10, 1947 in New York City. He was the second of six children—four boys and two girls. His parents \"always encouraged us to be individuals.\" Individuals they were. One brother attempted to make rock candy by keeping a string dangling in ajar of sugar water. A second brother sterilized dirt, desalinized ocean water, and boiled bayberries. His family viewed David as \"the creative one.\" His family hung several of his paintings and drawings in the home. Together, the Adler children collected baseball cards, bottle caps, campaign buttons, stamps, coins, and historic newspapers. And, Adler's family all loved books. The family went to the library every Friday afternoon. Robert McCloskey's Homer Price was one of David's favorite books. David's father was continually adding bookcases to hold the family books. Later, Adler's brother, Eddie, began building bookcases. Of his childhood Adler says, \"I grew up in a large house filled with brothers, sisters, and books. My first stories were ones I made up to tell my younger brothers and sisters. I'm married now and like to tell stories to my children, but I also try to be a good listener and a good observer.\" As a child Adler read many kinds of books but did not plan on writing; he envisioned himself becoming a major league baseball player. Although he was good in the field, he wasn't a powerful hitter. When faced with a fastball, he couldn't hit at all. So, he thought it might be nice to be a U.S. senator. Instead of becoming a major league baseball player or senator, Adler entered the advertising field in his early twenties. He also earned an undergraduate degree in economics and education, and obtained a graduate degree in marketing from New York University. For a time he was a financial writer, and he says, \"I was a cartoonist before I was a writer. I was a math teacher, arts and crafts teacher, and a waiter, too.\"\n\nPage 3\n\nSince that first book, Adler has settled in to writing for children. Among his most popular titles are those in the Cam Jansen series and the Picture Book Biography series. The Cam Jansen series has been translated into Dutch, German, and Japanese. Several of Adler's Picture Book Biographies are available in Spanish. Much of Adler's fiction comes from real life, although he uses ''creative license.\" During school visits, Adler explains that authors \"continually adapt real people and true events into their fiction so that not everything written occurs as it actually takes place.\" He gets ideas from many people and events in his own life, his family, students he meets at presentations, and librarians who suggest book needs. He never uses the real name of a person who inspired an idea, but on occasion, someone recognizes him­ or herself in a book. When his then eight­year­old son Michael read the first three chapters of Adler's manuscript for Benny, Benny, Baseball Nut (Scholastic, 1987), he recognized himself and told his father, \"Dad, this is me!\" Adler confirms that ''the main character in the book, Benny, Benny, Baseball Nut is based on my eldest son, a real baseball enthusiast.\" Other books evolve from life events. When Adler was six years old, a neighbor's boy convinced Adler that a jar of brown liquid was a magic potion. That incident became the inspiration for I Know I'm a Witch (Holt, 1988). The mischievous boy from Adler's childhood became the book's female main character. Adler became lost while traveling in Yugoslavia and had a strange experience that, many years later, became the basis for a title in the Cam Jansen series, Cam Jansen and the Mystery of Flight 54 (Viking, 1989). His writing goes through drastic rewrites. When he visits schools he often takes huge reproductions of some of the beginning pages of a book, pages at various stages of his revisions, so that he can share the revision process. The first title in the Cam Jansen series is Cam Jansen and the Stolen Diamonds (Viking, 1980). Adler originally wrote the manuscript featuring a male character, but after several revisions the main protagonist evolved as red­haired Jennifer \"Cam\" Jansen, a girl with a photographic memory. Her friend Eric is the oldest of four children and thus is cast as a nurturing child who helped care for the younger children in his family. Cam, on the other hand, was an only child and exhibited many traits often attributed to male characters—adventurous and headstrong. Adler says, \"[Cam] is based on an elementary school classmate. Cam Jansen's sidekick, the timid Eric Sheldon, is based on myself.\"\n\nPage 4\n\nCam Jansen and Eric Sheldon solve crimes in the Cam Jansen series. Adler's plots take Cam and Eric into some suspenseful moments as they attempt to unravel clues and solve crimes. Adler says, ''It's not easy to come up with crimes that don't involve violence.\" Most often the crime is robbery. The plot must not be so simple that readers can figure out the crime in the first two chapters, but must not be so complex that the story doesn't make sense by the time the reader gets to the end. Eric's twin sisters, Donna and Diane, become two of four stars in a second mystery series, Fourth Floor Twins. The other two characters are Gary and Kevin Young, a second set of twins. Together the four find a stolen sculpture, track down a missing suitcase (and the youngest Sheldon sibling) on the Silver Ghost Express, solve the mystery of the man in the blue hat, and participate in a sand castle contest—while hot on the trail of a dog napper. A third mystery series began with Jeffrey's Ghost and the Left­Over Baseball Team (Holt, 1984). Next came mysteries featuring Herman \"Houdini\" Foster and his cousin Janet, who solve crimes in the Houdini Club Magic Mysteries, published by Random House, among others. Adler has written a number of riddle books that are attractive to primary­age readers. He tackles animal riddles, spooky riddles, riddles for Thanksgiving, school American History riddles. Of the time he wrote these books he says, \"I was difficult to live with .... I kept asking my family the most awful riddles and some that I still think are terrific.\" While most readers expect a writer to research nonfiction titles (and of course, Adler does), many do not realize that fiction books also require research. For example, to make Cam Jansen realistic—she has a photographic visual memory—Adler read much about people who have photographic memories. The plot for each Cam Jansen book requires research for the specific events that take place. For example, during the writing of Cam Jansen and the Mystery of the Carnival Prize (Viking, 1984), Adler centered some action around a rigged carnival game. He researched carnival games and determined that a game could be rigged in the manner he described. Eventually, he created a model of the game and took it to his editor at Viking to prove that the rigging method was possible. Adler has been known to write some chapters in the quiet of the Hewlett­Woodmere Public Library, but also writes at home on his computer. He is prolific, having over 140 entries in the Library of Congress catalog. During 1997, five publishers released a total of ten Adler books. His writing versatility is evident in the titles released. Hiding from the\n\nPage 5\n\nNazis (Holiday, 1997), for example, is the true story of Lore Baer, who as a four­year­old Jewish child was placed with a Christian family in Dutch farm country. Another title, Easy Math Puzzles (Holiday, 1997), took Adler back to his puzzle/riddle era. A Cam Jansen mystery was released, as well as a book in an offshoot series, Young Cam Jansen, and three titles in the Picture Book Biography series. Additional titles released in 1997 included: a title in the Houdini Club Magic Mystery series, a story about Chanukah, and a biography about Lou Gehrig for older readers. The previous year eight titles were released: four mysteries, two Picture Book Biographies, a book about fractions, and The Kids' Catalog of Jewish Holidays (Jewish Publication Society, 1996). A new series of books featuring Andy Russell as the main character is based on his middle son, Edward. ''He is an interesting boy with interesting questions such as, 'Daddy, what if the Wright brothers had been Siamese twins? What would the cockpit of an airplane look like now?' The family in the books are based on our family.\" Within a twenty­year time span, Adler has authored more than 150 children's books, including mysteries, biographies, riddles, science and math books, and books about the Holocaust. These have won numerous awards and have been translated into Braille, British English, Chinese, Danish, Dutch, German, Hebrew, Japanese, Spanish, and Swedish. For many years David A. Adler has lived in Woodmere, New York, with his spouse, Renee. They have three sons—Michael Seth, Edward Ranan, and Eitan Joshua. Among David Adler's favorite things are: the colors green, yellow, blue, and gray; kiwis; dolphins; July 4th; Thanksgiving; and Passover. He says if he were not a writer that he would want to be \"a comedian—a real funny one.\" \"I feel very fortunate; I love the work I do. Most times, it doesn't seem like work at all.\" Books and Notes Adler has written more than 150 books. The books in these selected lists are representative of titles he has written in that category. Annotations/notes are included where content is not adequately indicated by title. Biographies—Picture Book Series Since the early 1980s Adler has authored almost thirty titles about U.S. presidents and other historical figures such as: Eleanor Roosevelt, Helen Keller, Harriet Tubman, Rosa Parks, and Jesse Owens.\n\nPage 6\n\nA Picture Book of Amelia Earhart.

Biographies for Intermediate Readers Although very well known for his series of Picture Book Biographies, Adler also writes biographies for an older, intermediate audience. Benjamin Franklin—Printer, Inventor, Statesman. Illustrated by Lyle Miller. (Holiday, 1992). Lou Gehrig: The Luckiest Man. Illustrated by Terry Widener. (Harcourt, 1997). Includes information about Gehrig's struggle with the terminal disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (AML, or Lou Gehrig's disease). Math, Science, and Puzzles David Adler earned an undergraduate degree in economics and was, at one time, a mathematics teacher. Those interests most likely stimulated his books that explain mathematical and science concepts, as well as titles that focus on economics. His several books of rebuses, riddles, and puzzles seem to combine his interest in mathematics and mysteries. Easy Math Puzzles. Illustrated by Cynthia Fisher. (Holiday, 1997). Fraction Fun.

''My parents were horrified when I told them I wanted to be an author,\" he says. They wanted him to do something sensible, to find some sort of useful work. But Alexander was a reader and wanted to be a writer. He loved the work of Shakespeare, Dickens, Twain, and the world's mythologies. King Arthur was his hero. Alexander had no idea of how to find useful work and no idea of how to become a poet. His parents could not afford to send him to college, so after graduating from high school in 1940, Alexander went to work. He worked as a bank messenger as one of his first jobs and managed to attend Lafayette College for a time. After one term he joined the U.S. Army to fight in World War II. He was stationed in Texas, Maryland, and across the Atlantic in Wales. During these tours he worked in the artillery, the\n\nPage 9\n\nArmy band (he played cymbals), and in first­aid. He found Wales ''an enchanted world.\" From Wales he was sent to France, where he joined the Seventh Army in Alsace­Lorraine, the Rhineland, and southern Germany. Here, he was a staff sergeant in combat intelligence, and finally, after the war, was attached to a counter­ intelligence unit in Paris. He was discharged while in France and stayed on to attend the Sorbonne. He met his wife, Janine Denni, in Paris, and together, with her young daughter Madeleine, they returned to the United States, settling in Drexel Hill, near Philadelphia. Alexander began to write, despite the fact that he had no formal training. His first efforts were aimed at an adult audience. Few were published, so he earned his living as a cartoonist, advertising writer, layout artist, and editor and writer for a small magazine. At night he pursued writing. After seven years of rejections, he succeeded in getting a novel published. During the next ten years he wrote for adults. Eventually, he turned his attention and talent to books for young readers. In the late 1950s he began to research material for a time­travel book. The book, Time Cat: The Remarkable Journeys of Jason and Gareth (Holt, 1963), featured Jason and his magic cat, Gareth. With the wink of an eye Gareth takes Jason to nine faraway places in history. Alexander extensively researched each geographical location and each time period. During the research he \"stumbled across a collection of Welsh tales, The Mabinogion.\" Two volumes of medieval stories soon took him back to all of the heroes, games, and dreams. He could again envision the castles, mountains, and valleys of an enchanted land. That was the beginning of the Prydain Chronicles—the Wales that he had discovered years before. The Welsh research never did make it into Time Cat, but it did lead Alexander into a much longer fantasy. The fantasies were set in a land, Prydain, much like the land of Wales. The Prydain Chronicles began with The Book of Three (Holt, 1964) and filled four more titles. The final book in the chronicles, The High King (Holt, 1968), earned the coveted Newbery Award for Alexander in 1969. The series became the basis for an 82­minute Disney movie, The Black Cauldron, in 1985, and spawned Disney books based on the movie. The film, according to the All­movie Guide, was \"a morbid affair and as a result was the first Disney feature cartoon to earn a PG rating.\" Due to the popularity of the Alexander books, the film grossed more than $21 million. But because the film was animated in precomputer days, it\n\nPage 10\n\ntook Disney animators more than ten years to produce. The gross fell short of the estimated $25 million it is said to have taken to put the movie on the screen. Throughout the chronicles, protagonist, Taran, the Assistant Pig­Keeper, struggles against evil forces that are attempting to destroy Prydain. The Prydain Chronicles are sword­and­sorcery­type stories, but even in the fantasy the stories contain elements of Alexander's own life. His wife, Janine, has suggested that Alexander grumbles like the character Doli, and Alexander admits that he is, like Fflewddur Fflam, an outrageous stretcher of the truth. The chief protagonist is an Assistant Pig­ Keeper and would­be warrior, Taran. Of him Alexander says, ''I admit that the dreams of the Assistant Pig­Keeper were much like mine as a child.\" For a number of years the Alexanders' living room has housed an ancient harp, still with a broken string, on the mantelpiece. It is difficult to tell if that harp is owned by Fflewddur Fflam, the would­be bard, or by Alexander himself. Younger readers will find a taste of the Prydain Chronicles through two picture­book tales created from incidents in the novels. Coil and His White Pig (Holt, 1965) is based on an event that occurs in The Book of Three. Another picture book, The Truthful Harp (Holt, 1967), tells the tale of King Fflewddur Fflam. The late Evaline Ness illustrated each of the picture books. Completing the Chronicles left Alexander with a sense that the creative experience had somehow changed his life. Looking for a way to convey that idea, Alexander created the story of Sebastian. Sebastian is a young man who seeks to become the fourth fiddler in a noble household, and after being rejected, sets out to see the world. Sebastian, himself, becomes a metaphor for the creative process and the demands that process makes on individuals. The Marvelous Misadventures of Sebastian (Dutton, 1970) earned Alexander his second major award, the 1971 National Book Award. The Chronicles ended with The High King, but in 1973 Alexander collected six short stories, The Foundling and Other Tales of Prydain (Holt, 1973; Puffin, 1996), dealing with events that preceded the birth of Taran, a key figure in the author's five works on the Kingdom of Prydain. In the 1980s Alexander created another mythical kingdom for the Westmark Trilogy. Theo, a printer's apprentice, examines the principles of honor, justice, and freedom of the press, all while trying to avoid the\n\nPage 11\n\ntyranny of the kingdom's chief minister. In Westmark (Dutton, 1981) Theo flees from criminal charges and falls in with a charlatan, his dwarf attendant, and Mickle, an urchin girl, who travels with them in the kingdom of Westmark. They ultimately arrive at the palace, where the king is grieving over the loss of his daughter. During the course of The Kestrel (Dutton, 1982), Theo helps Mickle to assume her rightful place as princess. To do that, all Theo's talents are needed, as well as those of his former companions. The Beggar Queen (Dutton, 1984) details the efforts of the king's uncle who plots to overthrow the new government of Westmark and bring an end to the reforms instituted by Mickle, now Queen Augusta, Theo, and their companions. In 1986 Alexander published a story about sixteen­year­old Vesper in The Illyrian Adventure (Dutton). As an orphan she has a guardian, and together they research an ancient legend and become entangled in a dangerous rebellion. Further adventures take the pair to Central America, a grand duchy in Europe, a remote country of Jedera, and finally to the Pennsylvania countryside. Alexander says, concerning the connection between his writing and life, ''While I use parts of my own personality in creating most of my characters, and some of my wartime experiences, most particularly in the Westmark Trilogy, some actual objects have found their way into many books.\" Those objects include \"my ancient Welsh harp in the Prydain chronicles [and] a 300­year­old cabin in Drexel Hill in The Philadelphia Adventure [Dutton, 1990]. The flute, paint box, bronze bowl, and other objects carried by Jen in The Remarkable Journey of Prince Jen [Dutton, 1991] were those I owned as a child.\" The objects \"came from my father's oriental importing business.\" While working on The Iron Ring (Dutton, 1997) he always kept a brass Hindu statuette on his work table. In recent years, Alexander has contributed to The Big Book for Peace (Dutton, 1990) and to a collection of a dozen scary stories by Newbery Award­winning authors, A Newbery Halloween (Delacorte, 1993). One of Alexander's stories waited fifteen years to be published. He tells the story of The Fortune­Tellers (Dutton, 1992). \"While cleaning old papers and assorted junk from under the eaves of the attic, Janine found a manuscript I had written 15 years earlier. It was a short fable I had put temporarily aside, to begin another project. By then, my attention was elsewhere; I forgot about it. It somehow got put in with a stack of papers which, finally, ended up in the attic. But, having patiently\n\nPage 12\n\nwaited all those years, the story was published as a picture book with gorgeous illustrations by Trina Schart Hyman.'' The story is about a carpenter in the West African country of Cameroon who goes to a fortune­teller and finds the predictions about his future coming true in an unusual way. That the story is set in Cameroon seemed to be a fortunate match with illustrator Trina Schart Hyman. Hyman's daughter, Katrine, married an African prince and went to live in Cameroon—providing Trina with ample opportunity to research the flora and fauna of the country. Lloyd Alexander and his wife, Janine, continue to reside in the Drexel Hill area. Alexander says, however, \"there is no hill, unless you count the bump in the road across from the barber shop.\" He begins his writing early in the morning (sometimes as early as 4 A.M.) and, when he feels he has done all he can, he stops. Sometimes he sneaks back to bed. Alexander says that he is \"thinking horizontally.\" His wife calls it \"snoozing.\" He has mentored area writers and has introduced some, including Donna Jo Napoli, to editors at Dutton. The Alexanders continue to enjoy their cats (some have appeared in his books). The couple's 1996 Christmas card combined Alexander's interest in drawing and music in his sketch showing himself holding a violin. Few will think of Alexander as a musician, but many will remember him as a master storyteller. About his interests and pastimes Alexander says, \"Mozart's music is a great passion; so is playing the violin, which I do amazingly badly. I love reading, British style crossword puzzles, and drawing silly cartoons for my own amusement.'' Always a reader, Alexander's message for those who read his books is, \"Read! Read every book you can get. Each book we read adds another dimension to our lives.\" Books and Notes Lloyd Alexander has contributed to more than 40 books.

He was told that he would not (or could not) become a writer. So why did he? Because he was told he couldn't! Avi struggles with dysgraphia—a learning disability in writing. He left words out of sentences and added others where they didn't make sense. He spells words incorrectly (even though he knows how to spell them correctly). Until the eighth grade Avi was in the same class as his twin sister. Emily was considered smart. His older brother went to college at the age of fifteen. Avi's school performance did not compare well with his siblings. He was viewed as ''being sloppy and erratic, and not paying attention.\" He endured unending criticism, but despite that, he kept trying. He liked what he wrote and actually did fairly well in science. But when he was sent to a science high school, he failed. His parents enrolled him in a small private school, and it was there that an English teacher insisted that he get help with writing. By the time he\n\nPage 16\n\nwas seventeen, he knew that he wanted to be a writer. Since then, he has earned acclaim as a Newbery Honor Award­winning author and has garnered many other awards for his books for young readers. Edward Wortis was born December 23, 1937, five minutes before his sister, Emily. His sister began to call him Avi—no one seems to know why, but the name stuck. Their father, Joseph, was a psychiatrist, their mother, Helen Zunser, a social worker. The family spent a lot of time reading, and every night they read to Avi. On Fridays the family would go to the library. Every birthday brought at least one gift book. Avi says, ''I loved to read. Still do.\" Avi was reading by the time he was five years old and has never stopped. For a time he also thought he wanted to play baseball, but he wasn't very good. Besides, something inside him pulled him toward writing. His grandfather, a Russian immigrant, often told him stories about American history—how wonderful the country was—and he recounted the wonderful traditions associated with being in America. Avi came to regard history with a sense of story. His entire family seemed to be a family of storytellers. Avi's paternal grandmother was French and raised in Alsace­Lorraine. When she was six or seven years old, the Germans marched into Alsace during the Franco­Prussian war of 1870. She often told vivid stories of those days. Avi also loved to draw, and his parents, who enjoyed photography, encouraged him to become a sculptor. But he wanted to write. Avi struggled through school, but with the help of an understanding tutor he began to understand his abilities and cope with his dysgraphia. He attended the University of Wisconsin, where he earned an undergraduate degree in 1959 and a masters degree in 1962. Two years later he received a second masters degree in library science from Columbia University. For twenty­five years he worked as a librarian at the New York Public Library, the Lambeth Public Library in London, and Trenton State College in New Jersey, where he was also an assistant professor. During this time he married Joan Gabiner and they had two sons, Shaun and Kevin. His writing career began early. At first he wrote plays, but when his oldest son was born, he began to tell stories for younger readers. His first book, Things That Sometimes Happen (Doubleday, 1970), was based on a storytelling game he played with Shaun. Shaun would tell his dad what he wanted a story to be about, and Avi would create a tale using those characters or objects. That storybook became the catalyst for Avi's writing career. Since Things That Sometimes Happen, Avi has only written\n\nPage 17\n\nfor young readers. After Avi and his wife divorced, he married again, this time to Coppelia Kahn. A stepson, Gabriel Kahn, also entered his life. During his own childhood in the 1940s, Avi read picture books, novels, many comic books, and listened often to kids' radio. Like many youngsters, Avi listened to adventure stories. He loved all the radio heroes the Lone Ranger, Captain Midnight, the Green Hornet, and the Sky King. In fact, he often lived their stories. Avi later wrote a book, Who Was That Masked Man Anyway? (Orchard, 1992), which incorporated those radio heroes into the plot. Frankie, the chief protagonist, is the boy Avi would have liked to have been. The story is told with dialogue and is very funny. Avi says, ''I think [it is] my funniest book.\" Other books come from bits and pieces of Avi's life. During high school, Avi was captain of the soccer team. Unfortunately, they never won a game. S.O.R. Losers (Bradbury, 1984) is based on those experiences. Avi brought together a relative's request for a funny book and the fact that some friends had just bought an old railway station in North Brook­field, Massachusetts, and mixed those ideas with inspiration he got by reading a lot of \"old\" children's books. The result was Emily Upham's Revenge (Pantheon, 1978; Morrow, 1992). An abridged version of a Shakespeare play performed in his sons' elementary school nudged Avi to write Romeo and Juliet: Together (and Alive) at Last (Orchard, 1987), and his interest in Poe inspired The Man Who Was Poe (Orchard, 1989). Avi's favorite reading material was comic books. When his sons were young they loved them too—so much that one son, Shaun, had a superhero costume party for his fourth birthday. One guest came as the Green Lantern, complete with a jade ring borrowed from his mother. During that party, the boy lost the ring in the grass. Those ideas all came together in No More Magic (Pantheon, 1975). Later the same interest in comic books helped Avi create the format for City of Light, City of Dark (Orchard, 1993). Avi read all the comic books he could get hold of, but his mother refused to let him read scary ones in the house. While he was working on this story, he remembered all the comic books that he had read. Soon, he decided that a comic book format would be the best way to tell the tale. He worked closely with the illustrator, Brian Floca, to create a visual tale. For a time Avi and his family lived in Lambertville, New Jersey, and in New Hope while he worked at Trenton State College. Two of his\n\nPage 18\n\nhistorical novels are set in that region. Night Journeys (Pantheon, 1979; Beech Tree, 1994), set in Solebury, tells the story of runaway indentured servants. The book's sequel, Encounter at Easton (Pantheon, 1980; Beech Tree, 1994), continues the story by telling about the servants and children who help the indentured servants escape. New Jersey and New England provide the general setting for several other novels as well. Captain Grey (Pantheon, 1977; Morrow, 1993) takes place on the New Jersey coast during the 1780s. A sign proclaiming the site of a skirmish along the side of a New Jersey highway inspired another book, The Fighting Ground (Lippincott, 1984; Harper, 1987). Avi encountered the subject of The Barn (Orchard, 1984) while photographing old barns in northern California. The story of Ben, who attempts to save his father by building the barn, ended up in 1855 Oregon, not California. During school visits Avi is often asked where he gets his ideas. His answer is that, ''Everyone has ideas. The bigger question is what do you do with your ideas?\" He explains that two of his sons are rock musicians and fashion their ideas into music. His sister, Emily, takes her ideas and writes poems. His brother uses his ideas to help him understand science. \"And I take my ideas and turn them into stories.\" Avi has written books as diverse as his reading interests. He has written comedy, mystery, adventure, fantasy, animal tales, ghost stories, and young adult coming­of­ age tales. He also writes novels in comic book form, dialogue, documentary style, and historical novels. In 1997 Avi wrote a story, Keep Your Eye on Amanda!, about twin raccoons. But this story is unlike any others. Avi is selling the story chapter by chapter to newspapers. The first newspaper to publish the story was the Colorado Springs Gazette Telegraph. As a child Avi remembers reading a story in installments in the newspaper, and that sense of joy and anticipation inspired Avi to re­create the newspaper serials common in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The story is set in the Boulder area, where Avi moved in 1995. Soon some of the area raccoons found his home, entered an open window, and went on a rampage that found its way into Avi's story. Avi brings many experiences to his writing. In addition to his work as a librarian and writer, he has interests in photography, reading, hiking, running, camping, making bread, and playing cricket. During his full­time librarian days, he found time to research and write by going in to work early, using a lunch hour, staying an extra hour, and working at\n\nPage 19\n\nnight and weekends. Writing was almost compulsive. Because his writing time was episodic, so was much of his writing. Now, Avi has an office with a computer, where he writes about six hours a day. He says he needs absolute quiet to work. Writing one book often takes a year or more and he rewrites as often as ten or fifteen times. He sets more short­term than long­term goals—five pages a day, rather than 300 pages a summer. Today, Avi lives in Boulder, Colorado, where he has learned how to ski and ride horses. He also enjoys photography and cooking. Avi's son Shaun is a rock musician in the Boston area, and his other son, Kevin, lives and manages rock bands in San Francisco. Kevin has a young daughter named Ruby. Avi's message to people who want to write is consistent: ''[T]he key to writing is reading. The more you read, the better your writing can be.\" Books and Notes Avi's novels start fast and grab the reader immediately. He prefers to begin with strong dialogue and includes real­life conflicts. Avi has written over 49 novels in many genres. His books' narrative style relies heavily on emotional suspense, imagery, irony, and contradiction. His most popular books are adventure, mystery and suspense novels and humor books. Historical facts and settings are included in many of his books. While he says that he hated \"being a student and hated to study,\" he has a degree in history and read novels as a way to immerse himself in the subject. The following are selected titles classified by genre. Adventure The Barn (Orchard, 1994). A family, three children and their father, are homesteading in 1855 Oregon. Then disaster strikes.

Barrie was known as a playwright and novelist. He was best known for his play Peter Pan (1904). He was the third son and ninth child of weavers David and Margaret Barrie. After attending Glasgow Academy and Dumfries Academy, Barrie entered Edinburgh University in 1878, where he earned a masters degree. Barrie worked as a journalist in Nottingham and later in London. By the 1880s he was writing novels. The Little Minister (1891) became his first major success. The romantic plot involved a shy preacher and an outgoing woman who marries him. The first of Barrie's plays was produced in 1891. Barrie continued as both a novelist and playwright. In 1896 his novel Sentimental Tommy was published. It featured an overactive imagination. The following year, 1897, a dramatized version of The Little Minister brought Barrie fame and wealth. Due to his success as a literary writer Barrie left journalism and devoted himself to plays and novels.\n\nPage 23\n\nIn 1902 Barrie's fantasy novel The Little White Bird was published by Scribner's. The boy hero Peter Pan first appeared in that novel. The novel (and the character) was so popular that Barrie fashioned several chapters into a play titled Peter Pan (1904). The play is the best­known version of the story. Peter Pan does not want to grow up and he escapes to Never­Never Land. Peter Pan meets the three Darling children, Wendy, John, and Michael, in a visit back to the human world. Peter Pan convinces the three children to return with him and Tinker Bell to Never­Never Land. Their adventures include encounters with a crocodile, the Indian princess Tiger Lily, and pirate Captain Hook. Two years later several more chapters were adapted into a second play, Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens, and in 1911 Barrie penned a narrative form of the play as Peter Pan and Wendy. The Library of Congress contains more than 150 entries relating to J. M. Barrie's Peter Pan, including musical scores, plays, movies, and books about the boy who would not grow up. Scott Gustafson illustrated the latest complete and unabridged version of the story, published by Viking in 1991. In 1953 Walt Disney released a twenty­two minute animated edition of the story chronicling the adventures of Peter and Wendy, Michael, and John Darling as they encounter Captain Hook on the enchanted island of Neverland. Peter Pan was played by Betty Bronson. Seven years later Disney released a 104­minute animated edition of the swashbuckler fantasy with Mary Martin in the lead role. This version brought the story into most households. Mary Martin originally starred in Broadway's musical version of Sir J. M. Barrie's Peter Pan in 1953. The play was so popular that it was restaged for television and aired on NBC's Producer's Showcase (March 7, 1955). It returned to television the following year, and eventually the producers sought to videotape the production. Mary Martin performed the lead once again, and on December 8, 1960, the video version was first telecast. Musical highlights of the play included ''First Star to the Left, Then Straight On Till Morning,'' \"I've Gotta Crow,\" \"I'm Flying,\" \"I Won't Grow Up,\" and \"Ugg­a­Wugg.\" \"Never­land\" and \"Hook's Waltz\" were included in the video production. The film was quickly dubbed a classic and shown several times in the 1970s. In 1989 the film was retelecast (complete with the then retired NBC Peacock logo) to a new audience. The 1989 release was re­edited to accommodate extra commercials. Currently, the original (and complete) version of the 1960 Peter Pan is available on videocassette.\n\nPage 24\n\nVarious other versions, or portions, of the play have been offered to the public. In 1992 Fox Television Network authorized a 23­minute release based on its afternoon adventure­show version. Peter Pan & the Pirates: Demise of Hook was billed as \"an exciting animated episode.\" In 1992 Steven Spielberg directed a 142­minute tale of a grown­up Peter Pan titled Hook (TriStar). Robin Williams played Peter Pan and Dustin Hoffman played Hook. Peter Pan must \"find his true self\" to rescue his children from the hands of the evil Captain Hook. Julia Roberts was cast as Tinker Bell. The film grossed more than $119 million domestically. Copies of the movie posters advertising Peter Pan are available for purchase from movie memorabilia companies. Carousel Publishing offered personalized books focusing on a search for Wendy's brothers. Because the original tale is now considered public domain, hundreds of spin­offs exist. A version (now copyrighted by Duncan Research because of their inclusion of notes and explanations) is posted on the Internet. In 1934 Barrie's book The Little Minister became the basis for a film, The Little Minister, which starred Katharine Hepburn as Babble and John Beal as the pastor. Although the play version (1897) had brought Barrie fame and wealth, the film version was only mildly acclaimed. Barrie married Mary Ansell in 1894 and divorced in 1909. They had no children. However, Barrie wanted his story of Peter Pan to benefit children as much as possible and thus donated his rights to Peter Pan to a London children's hospital. Barrie did not write much later in life but continued to receive honors based on his earlier works. He wrote his best­known works early in his career. In 1913 King George V made Barrie a baronet, and he received the Order of Merit in 1922. James Matthew Barrie died in London on June 19, 1937.

For More Information About/By the Author There seem to be few, if any, contemporary articles about James Matthew Barrie and his writings. However, various quotes extracted from his writings provide a rich perspective. Quotes ''Nothing is really work unless you would rather be doing something else.\" \"The printing press is either the greatest blessing or the greatest curse of modern times, sometimes one forgets which.\" \"Shall we make a new rule of life from tonight: always try to be a little kinder than is necessary.\" \"When the first baby laughed for the first time, the laugh broke into a thousand pieces and they all went skipping about, and that was the beginning of fairies.\" \"To die will be an awfully big. adventure.\" \"It's a sort of bloom on a woman. If you have it, you don't need to have anything else; and if you don't have it, it doesn't matter much matter what else you have.\" \"Life is a long lesson in humility.\"\n\nPage 26\n\nPatricia Beatty • Historical Fiction Portland, Oregon August 26, 1922­July 9, 1991 • Charley Skedaddle • Eben Tyne, Powdermonkey • Who Comes with Cannons? About the Author and the Author's Writing Patricia Beatty's writing career emerged from boredom while living in London, England. Her writing began as a hobby, but soon became a career. Beatty was born Patricia Robbins in Portland, Oregon, on August 26, 1922—seven months and four days after John Beatty, who was born January 22, 1922, in the same hospital. Though their mothers were casual acquaintances during Patricia and John's childhood, the two did not really become acquainted until attending Read College. Both earned undergraduate degrees from Read College in 1944, and then attended graduate school at the University of Idaho and the University of Washington in Seattle. Before marrying John Beatty on September 14, 1950, Patricia Beatty taught high school English and history in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho. Beatty first wrote about pioneers and Indians. She wrote without\n\nPage 27\n\nmuch success for years, although by 1960 a small publisher in Caldwell, Idaho, had published Indian Canoe­Maker (Caxton Printers, 1960). The book focused on the Quileute Indians. Their daughter, Ann Alexandria, was born in 1957. In 1959, the Beatty's moved to London. Motivated by the setting and boredom, Beatty began to write about eighteenth­century England. Her novel, At the Seven Stars (Macmillan, 1963), was set in 1752 London and marked the first collaboration with her husband. John Beatty, specialized in English history, so Patricia chided him into helping her. Together they wrote six more novels set in England. Between those books she wrote on her own as well. She penned historical novels set in the American West in the late 1800s and early 1900s. Bonanza Girl (Morrow, 1962; reissued 1993) was the first book published in this setting. In the 1960s she produced The Nickel­Plated Beauty (Morrow, 1964), Me, California Perkins (Morrow, 1968), and six other titles set during the turn of the century. She used her writing skills as a means to teach history. After leaving England, the Beattys moved to California, where Patricia taught a children's writing class for the University of California at Los Angeles Extension Department. During their writing, the Beattys checked facts and words diligently. For example, the main character in Champion Towers, Penitence Hervey, tells her own story. The dialogue and narrative had to reflect a seventeenth­century culture. The Beattys were careful to create Penitence's dialogue using language that would have been used at the time. Just before sending the manuscript to the publisher, they realized that because they had written the story in first person, the narrative also had to reflect the times. They checked and rechecked each word, a project that consumed them both for three hours a day for six weeks. They used their two­volume Shorter Oxford English Dictionary on Historical Principles and a concordance to the King James version of the Bible. During the process they established some guidelines for their decisions. If Shakespeare used a word similarly, the word stayed. If a word appeared in the Bible with the same meaning, the word stayed. And if the Oxford English Dictionary listed the word as late as 1665, the word stayed. The rationale for the 1665 publication date was that a word certainly would have been used in common language prior to its inclusion in the 1665 dictionary. Sometimes they had used a word as a verb and during\n\nPage 28\n\ntheir checking process found that the word was only a noun in the 1600s. Then they had to search for a synonym. Military terms were particularly troublesome and were central to the descriptions of the Battle of Worcester, for example. Military patrols were scouting parties, and passwords were watchwords. Other terms were corrected to reflect appropriate usage—fireplace became hearthfire; horses did not whinny, but they did neigh; characters would not have suffered from rheumatism, but might have suffered from arthritis. At one point in the story they mentioned a secret passage that was accessed through a Spanish knob, but discovered that during the period of the story setting, the knob did not exist. Three hundred years ago people entered rooms and houses by using latches and strings. The same detailed research characterized the novels written by Patricia. Her writing featured California settings and the Civil War period. Riverside, California, was the setting for at least two titles, The Bad Bell of San Salvador (Morrow, 1973) and The Queen's Own Grove (Morrow, 1966). John Beatty died in 1975, and two years later Patricia Beatty married Carl J. Uhr. Her most popular titles were published in the 1980s. Eben Tyne, Powdermonkey (Morrow, 1990), a book of Civil War history, coauthored with Phillip Robbins, and Jayhawker (Morrow, 1991), a story dealing with the early years of the Civil War, are included on many lists of Civil War novels. Patricia Beatty's writing career spanned three decades and resulted in more than fifty entries in the Library of Congress catalog. Patricia Beatty died July 9, 1991, in Riverside, California. Books and Notes Once a history teacher, Patricia Beatty continued that role as a writer. She wrote first about life in England, and then colonial America. Her best­known books are generally considered to be about life during the Civil War. Civil War Charley Skedaddle (Morrow, 1987).

''Writing the Historical Novel for Young Readers.\" The Writer 102, no. 3 (March 1, 1989): 17+.\n\nPage 30\n\nJohn Bellairs • Mystery Marshall, Michigan January 17, 1938­March 8, 1991 • The Curse of the Blue Figurine • The House with a Clock in Its Wall About the Author and the Author's Writing Asked about his favorite things, John Bellairs said, ''I love ghost stories, coffins, bones, spells, Latin, cathedrals, darkness, castles, England, cobalt blue, Christmas, Italian food, the moon, secret passages, and wizards like Gandalf. I'm also a Red Sox fan.\" Most of his favorite things seemed to have ended up in his books. John Bellairs was born in Marshall, Michigan, and most of his childhood was spent just twelve miles from the cereal capital of the world, Battle Creek. In Marshall, Bellairs was surrounded by many unusual enormous old houses. Bellairs included these old houses into his many books. But Bellairs's imagination filled the houses with strange happenings that, \"If they didn't occur, I wish they had.\" After graduating from high school, Bellairs earned an undergraduate degree from Notre Dame in 1959 and a masters degree in English from the University of Chicago in 1960. He began his career as an English\n\nPage 31\n\nteacher. He taught at the College of St. Teresa in Winona, Minnesota, and Shimer College in Mount Carrol, Illinois. Seven years later, motivated by the success of his first book, Bellairs turned to writing full­time. He traveled to England for six months. His writing did not sustain him, however, and he returned to teaching. He sailed back to the United States on the Queen Elizabeth and settled in New England. It was during this time that he meet Priscilla Braids at an Easter party. They married on June 24, 1968, and took up residence in an old New Hampshire farmhouse. Bellairs became completely acquainted with the White Mountains. He taught English at Emmanuel College in Boston, and later joined the English faculty at Merrimack College in North Andover, Massachusetts. He began writing children's books with The House with a Clock in Its Wall (Dial, 1973). This book, and those that followed, allowed Bel­lairs to return to full­time writing. The family, now including their son, Frank, moved to Haverhill, Massachusetts. By the early 1980s, Bellairs and Priscilla had divorced. Bellairs and his son continued to live in Haverhill in their frame house with a cozy porch. Bellairs died there of a heart attack on March 8, 1991. Bellairs's writing included settings from his childhood. His boyhood hometown, Marshall, became New Zebedee in a series that included The House with a Clock in Its Wall (Dial, 1973), The Figure in the Shadows (Dial, 1975), and The Letter, the Witch, and the Ring (Dial, 1976). Readers who visit Marshall often feel as if they have landed right in the middle of Bellairs's New Zebedee. The House with a Clock in Its Wall is known as the Cronin Mansion. The books are a mix of teenage concerns and the supernatural, a mix that results in chilling tales for young readers. The first few pages of the series concern Lewis Barnavelt, a shy, geeky young man who is on his way to meet his uncle for the first time. He is unable to keep friends and his attempts to find new friends bring some eerie (and magical) moments. Lewis grows to love and respect the unique Uncle Jonathan. The poker game in the front parlor with Mrs. Zimmerman is more than it appears. The book is full of chills and episodes from the commonplace to the supernatural. This series was followed by one beginning with The Treasure of Alpheus Winterborn (Dial, 1978). The Treasure of Alpheus Winterborn is set in Hoosac, a town modeled after the real town of Winona. Myra Eells, the ''bird­like\" public\n\nPage 32\n\nlibrarian, meets Anthony Monday over magazines in a drugstore and listens. He grows to trust and respect her, and together they search for treasure. In the sequel, The Dark Secret of Weatherend (Dial, 1984), the two friends find themselves opposing a demon, Anders Borkman, who wishes to destroy humanity to develop a pure race. In spite of Borkman casting a spell on Anthony and Miss Eells, they find a way to outwit and conquer him. The Curse of the Blue Figurine (Dial, 1983) began yet another series, this one set in the White Mountains of New Hampshire, not far from Bellairs's Massachusetts home. In addition to the settings, many ordinary experiences come from Bellairs's life—the experiences with bullies, the scaredy­cat kid Lewis, and the grownups (a father who owned a saloon and a mother who was constantly worried about money). Most, if not all, of Bellairs's books have a recognizable pattern. The protagonist, usually a young teenager, makes a mystical goof, and with the help of friends or someone older, the protagonist comes to terms with the situation. His books are filled with everyday incidents, elements of science fiction, philosophical crises, cozy scenes, and mysterious happenings. From 1980 until his death in 1991, John Bellairs lived in Haverhill, Massachusetts, where he wrote full­time. Bellairs left behind two unfinished manuscripts and plot outlines for two more novels. Bellairs's son, Frank, asked longtime Bellairs's fan Brad Strickland to complete the two partial manuscripts and to write the two novels based on the plot outlines. The titles, The Ghost in the Mirror (Dial, 1993), The Vengeance of the Witch­Finder (Dial, 1993), The Drum, the Dolt, and the Zombie (Dial, 1994), and The Doom of the Haunted Opera (Dial, 1995) are listed as being ''by John Bellairs, completed by Brad Strickland.\" Jonathan Abucejo, a devoted fan of Bellairs's work, has said, \"I wasn't too sure what 'all' he had completed .... I couldn't really tell from the style where John Bellairs stopped and where Brad Strickland began.\" Since then, Brad Strickland has written additional books based on the characters created by Bellairs. Johnny Dixon is the chief protagonist in the Strickland novels The Hand of the Necromancer (Dial, 1996) and The Bell, the Book, and the Spellbinder (Dial, 1997). The characters that live in Bellairs's novels seem destined to live in Brad Strickland's books; Strickland \"has set out to write the kind of stories he likes to read.\"\n\nPage 33\n\nBooks and Notes John Bellairs wrote books set in three locations—New Zebedee, Michigan; Hoosac, Minnesota; and Duston Heights, Massachusetts (White Mountains). Books Set in New Zebedee (Marshall), Michigan Rose Rita and Lewis Barnavelt are the main characters. Lewis Barnavelt's parents were killed in an automobile accident, and he was sent to live with his Uncle Jonathan in New Zebedee. Lewis is a shy, chubby, blond­haired boy who has difficulty making friends. His efforts at friendship with Tarby, a popular athlete, are unsuccessful. He does, however, meet Rose Rita Pottinger, and they become best friends. The Ghost in the Mirror is a time­travel book that takes place in 1828 Stonebridge, Pennsylvania. The Vengeance of the Witch­Finder includes several episodes set in the Bar­navelt Manor (near Dinsdale, England). The complete series includes: The House with a Clock in Its Wall (Dial, 1973). The Figure in the Shadows (Dial, 1975). The Letter, the Witch, and the Ring (Dial, 1976). The Ghost in the Mirror. Completed by Brad Strickland. (Dial, 1993). The Vengeance of the Witch­Finder. Completed by Brad Strickland. (Dial, 1993). The Doom of the Haunted Opera. Completed by Brad Strickland. (Dial, 1995). Books Set in Hoosac (Winona), Minnesota Anthony Monday is a gangly young man who most often wears cutoff jeans, sneakers, an old soiled white T­shirt, and a red leather cap with a crumpled bill. One day at the local drugstore he meets Miss fells, the town's head librarian. They become friends rather quickly, and soon Anthony has an after­school job in the town's library. She listens as he tells his fears (dogs) and likes (mysteries). His favorite authors are John Dickson Carr, Agatha Christie, and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. His hobby is coin collecting, and he is always searching for a boxfull of Brasher doubloons or 1822 five­dollar gold pieces. The Mansion in the Mist takes place in Hoosac, Minnesota, and on a Northern Canadian island on Shadow Lake. The books featuring Anthony Monday and Miss fells include: The Treasure of Alpheus Winterborn (Dial, 1978). The Dark Secret of Weatherend (Dial, 1984). The Lamp from the Warlock's Tomb (Dial, 1988). The Mansion in the Mist (Dial, 1992). Books Set in Duston Heights, Massachusetts (White Mountains) John Michael Dixon and Professor Childermass are best friends. ''Johnny'' is living with his grandparents in Duston Heights because his mother died of cancer and his father serves in the Air Force. Johnny is rather shy and normally avoids kids his own age. He often reads adult nonfiction books about archaeology and is very good in science, Latin, and literature—interests he shares with Professor Childermass. There are references to Shakespeare and the works of the Dutch master painters, Rembrandt and Ruysdael. Their adventures include episodes in the White Mountains"
