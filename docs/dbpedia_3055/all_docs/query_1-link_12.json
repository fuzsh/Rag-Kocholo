        "text": "Everyone's favorite \"Donald\" is back! The iconic character Donald Duck returns in a brand new short film made by Disney Animation Studios. This premiered for streaming this past weekend to celebrate the 90th birthday, rather 90th anniversary, of the character created by the original Walt Disney and his animators (specifically Dick Lundy). The extra grumpy duck made his first cartoon appearance on June 9th, 1934 as a supporting character in the short The Wise Little Hen, and most recently appeared in Once Upon a Studio. The new short film is called D.I.Y. Duck, and it features Donald trying to fix a lightbulb in his home, going back-n-forth to the hardware store as more problems arise during his attempts to get the new bulb to work. Disney has also re-released a few remastered classic Donald Duck short films, including Crazy Over Daisy and Out on a Limb, with all of them launching for streaming on Disney+ for audiences to enjoy. This is only 2 mins long and it's classic cartoon comedy at its best. How many ducks does it take to screw in a lightbulb?"
