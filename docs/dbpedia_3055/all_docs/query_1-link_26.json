        "text": "Director: Dick Lundy\n\nRelease Date: June 9, 1947\n\nStars: Woody Woodpecker\n\nRating: ★★★★\n\nReview:\n\nWoody wants to get up early, at 5:00 Am, but he’s kept awake all night, especially by an annoying cuckoo clock.\n\n‘Coo-Coo Bird’ is the second and the better of two Woody Woodpecker cartoons from 1947 about sleeplessness, the other one being ‘Smoked Hams’. In his struggle with inanimate things, Woody resembles Donald Duck a lot in this cartoon, not too surprising as Donald Duck was well-known to director Dick Lundy, who co-created that character. Thus, ‘Coo-Coo Bird’ is very reminiscent of the Donald Duck short ‘Early to Bed‘ (1941), and itself anticipates the Donald Duck cartoon ‘Drip Dippy Donald’ (1948) in which Donald is kept awake by a dripping tap.\n\nWatch ‘Coo-Coo Bird’ yourself and tell me what you think:\n\nThis is Woody Woodpecker cartoon No. 22\n\nTo the previous Woody Woodpecker cartoon: Smoked Hams\n\nTo the next Woody Woodpecker cartoon: Well Oiled\n\n‘Wet Blanket Policy’ is available on the DVD-set ‘The Woody Woodpecker and Friends Classic Cartoon Collection’"
