Mickey and an early version of Donald Duck are police officers chasing dognapper Pegleg Pete. Despite their bumbling, they manage to repeatedly get the drop on Pete at his sawmill hideout, though they ultimately make a shambles of the place.",

        "text": "That's how good The Dognapper is. The animation is great, the black and white colours are very crisp, the backgrounds never feel too sparse, the characters are well-drawn(even if I am familiar with and prefer their features later on) and it all looks very crisp. The music as I've said many times has always been a large part of why the Disney shorts on the most part are so good to me. The Dognapper is no exception to this, the orchestration is beautiful and lively and it is full of non-stop energy. I just love the characters. Mickey is a likable hero, which contrasts wonderfully with Donald's temperamental coward, while Pete is as antagonistic as ever. The story has never a dull moment and what was also really good was how it jumped straight into things instead of having lots of filler to begin with. And The Dognapper is non-stop action and gags. These gags are ones that are laugh-a-minute as well, and all of them are spot-on, right from Pete knocking out the bridge and Mickey and Donald stretching their motorcycle to ride the rails to the silhouette images of the characters in the hole to the sawmill chasing them. In conclusion, not my favourite Disney short but up there with the best of them. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
