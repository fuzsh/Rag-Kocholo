        "text": "A character gets sprayed in the face with black ink, and it’s not turned into a blackface gag, which had to have made Walt Disney’s head explode. Walter Lantz is hardly innocent, and I’m not applauding him just for not doing the easy, cheap, hack, ugly gag, but it’s a moment that I just know Disney (or Looney Tunes or Hanna-Barbera) could not even conceive of not making into something racist.\n\nI do applaud Lantz, and director Dick Lundy, for this short generally, which is packed with clever, weird, and almost grotesque gags! A seedy life insurance salesman is trying to kill Woody Woodpecker to collect on the policy he was tricked into signing, but Woody keeps besting him. It’s fantastic.\n\n‘The Woody Woodpecker Song’ makes its debut, just a year after ‘No One But Donald Duck’. The former is catchier for having Woody’s laugh as part of the lyrics. It’s still the 1940’s, but, boy does ‘Wet Blanket Policy’ look like a UPA cartoon. It’s a completely insane chase around a decrepit building with Woody and insurance agent Buz Buzzard, complete with malleable shapes and sizes and a crocodile pit climax. It’s never funnier than when Woody pecks the buzzard’s head.\n\nThe shortest film ever nominated for the Best Original Song, the movie features not the first appearance of Woody Woodpecker, but the first appearance of his famous theme song. The cartoon is funny, if predictable, and the song taken on its surface (and not filled with hundreds of childhood memories) is just okay. Catchy, but nothing special. The film is 6 minutes long though...it's worth a quick diversion before bed for the Oscar curiosity alone.\n\nWoody Woodpecker short that holds the distinction of being the only animated short film (possibly even the only short film, but don't pin me down on that) to have received an Oscar nomination for Best Original Song. And it wasn't even a song that was written for this film, but was crowbared into it, after it became a surprise smash hit.\n\nAnd what can I say: It's a Woody Woodpecker short. I don't like Woody Woodpecker. I have no idea why he ever was popular. And I care so little about him that, when he started to speak in this film, I was briefly confused, because I had completely forgotten that he does speak, and is not a silent character.\n\nI did remember his annoying laugh, though.\n\nDick Lundy films ranked"
