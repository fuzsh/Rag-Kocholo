        "text": "# 11 - Music Land\n\nDisney Animated Shorts - Season 1935 - Episode 15\n\nWhen the saxophone son of the King of the Isle of Jazz falls in love with the violin daughter of his father's rival, the Queen of the Land of Symphony, war erupts. The Prince and Princess are nearly drowned in the Sea of Discord until a cease fire is called. The short ends in a double wedding and the uniting of the two kingdoms with the Bridge of Harmony.\n\n# 12 - Bathing Buddies\n\nWoody Woodpecker and Friends - Season 1946 - Episode 5\n\nWoody Woodpecker, who lives upstairs at Wally Walrus' boarding house, is enjoying a game of indoor golf while Wally takes a bath. The ball lands on Wally's head, causing a sudden end to the golf game. With nothing to do but take a bath, Woody's dime for the hot water meter falls down the drain. Retrieving his dime requires a bit of ingenuity and the help of a long wire, a wrench, a jack, a sledgehammer and finally some dynamite. The combined operations reunite Woody and his dime, but they're too much for Wally and his rooming house, each of which ends up a complete wreck.\n\nWatch Now:Amazon\n\n# 13 - Smoked Hams\n\nWoody Woodpecker and Friends - Season 1947 - Episode 2\n\nWally Walrus is a \"Day Sleeper,\" as the sign hanging on his door attests. Woody Woodpecker is a \"Night Sleeper,\" as another sign on his door signifies. Both of them live in the same apartment house. The dawn of a new day is just breaking. Wally's retiring for his daily sleep, but Woody, down the hallway in another room, is still sound asleep. Woody's awakening is rather sudden when a door in a cuckoo clock opens, and a doll comes out and pours a small pail of water in his face. Full of vim and vigor, Woody noisily begins mowing the lawn. This disturb's Wally's sleep, and he takes stringent measures to stop grass and loose trash.\n\nWatch Now:Amazon\n\n# 14 - The Coo Coo Bird\n\nWoody Woodpecker and Friends - Season 1947 - Episode 3\n\nWoody reads in the paper that quail hunting season begins the next morning at 5 a.m. Not wanting to pass up quail hunting, he determines to get a good night's sleep. However, of course, his attempts are ruined by all manner of distractions, such as a flashing neon sign, and an obnoxious cuckoo clock that takes on a life of its own (the cuckoo itself is just as obnoxious). In getting rid of the cuckoo, Woody destroys his bed, causing him to sleep on a runaway \"automatic table,\" with which he has many a tussle. The folding table first beats him up, then traps him, and finally bucks him off into a bush full of quail. The quail throws him to a hunter's dogs, who chase him into a cabin where he almost loses his identity, and the quail give him the Woody Woodpecker laugh.\n\nWatch Now:Amazon\n\n# 15 - Well Oiled\n\nWoody Woodpecker and Friends - Season 1947 - Episode 5\n\nEnjoying a drive through the Giant Redwoods, Woody Woodpecker runs out of gas. He tries to foil police officer Wally Walrus after siphoning some from his cop car. Unfortunately, he's observed by the cop, and the chase is on. Woody eludes the cop temporarily by ducking into a service station and disguising himself as an old man. When the cop asks for water, Woody uses the fire hose, then runs him through a huge wringer at the car laundry. A duel fought with grease guns gives Woody a chance to thoroughly grease the law, but he makes one slip and winds up with himself well oiled.\n\nWatch Now:Amazon\n\n# 16 - Solid Ivory\n\nWoody Woodpecker and Friends - Season 1947 - Episode 6\n\nWoody Woodpecker is playing pool in his barn. He loses control of one of the balls (the white one), which bounces across the yard and lands in a hen house. When he goes to get it, an overprotective setting hen will not let him have it, thinking that Woody is trying to steal one of her eggs. Woody loses the battle that follows, so he tries a rod and reel, baited with corn. The hen hooks it up with the light circuit and almost electrocutes Woody. He tries hypnotizing her with nylons, but she beats him back to the eggs. A disguise as a lovestruck French rooster with a Charles Boyer accent finally gets her off the nest, but Woody drops the eggs. The baby chicks that pop out of the broken eggs make the hen happy, so all is forgiven.\n\nWatch Now:Amazon\n\n# 17 - Woody the Giant Killer\n\nWoody Woodpecker and Friends - Season 1947 - Episode 7\n\nOut of work, Woody is weary from looking for a place to rent, and he complains about his not having any living quarters. He's approached by city slicker Buck Beaver, who convinces him to buy some magic beans. Woody plants them, and a beanstalk shoots up to the clouds. An elevator takes Woody to a giant's castle, where he finds the dopey giant asleep and initially fails to wake him up. Woody puts mustard, red pepper and horseradish on his tongue, which does the trick. Woody hides from the giant in a stuffed olive and is almost swallowed. He escapes in a handy car.\n\nWatch Now:Amazon\n\n# 18 - The Mad Hatter\n\nWoody Woodpecker and Friends - Season 1948 - Episode 1\n\nWoody Woodpecker, dreaming of becoming a great screen lover, is awakened by a telegram from the studio telling him to come to work. His screen test starts at 9 a.m., and he must be wearing a top hat. The months have wrecked Woody's hat, so he has to buy a new one. Wally Walrus, proprietor of a hat store, makes a stubborn hat stay on Woody's head by screwing it on. An electric fan, however, soon blows the ornery hat off, and it lands on a frog. In trying to get the hat away from the frog, Woody becomes involved with a bucket and a goose. He fastens a skyrocket onto the goose to get it out of his hat, but he goes up into the sky himself. He arrives at his new job by crashing through the roof, and he's fired immediately. He throws the hat away, but it boomerangs and knocks him out. Woody's dream of fame as a great screen lover ends with a spat with his dream glamour girl.\n\nWatch Now:Amazon\n\n# 19 - Banquet Busters\n\nWoody Woodpecker and Friends - Season 1948 - Episode 2\n\nAndy Panda and Woody Woodpecker are two cold, hungry, unemployed musicians trying to keep alive in a heatless, foodless house. After fighting over a stale bean and losing it to a hungry mouse, they happen to read about Mrs. Gloria Van Glutton's musicale and dinner. Eluding butler Wally Walrus, they slip unobserved into the orchestra, where the aroma of a roast pig is too much for Woody. While the hungry mouse swallows a piece of cheese whole, Andy snags a roast turkey with a rod and reel fastened to his violin bow. Wally watches Woody make a sandwich, gets too close, and becomes part of it. Fortunately, a sneeze starts a free-for-all, with Mrs. Van Glutton a leading contender. The guests throw food at each other while Andy, Woody and the mouse stuff themselves- that is, until Wally starts using a shotgun. This breaks up the party and is a great help in sending Woody hopping madly over the hill.\n\nWatch Now:Amazon\n\n# 20 - Wacky-Bye Baby\n\nWoody Woodpecker and Friends - Season 1948 - Episode 4\n\nWoody Woodpecker, a homeless nobody, is rudely awakened from his park bench and tossed into a garbage can. He finds a news item announcing that billionaire Wally Walrus is planning to adopt a new baby boy. To get free room and board, Woody shows up on his doorstep disguised as a baby foundling. He gives Wally a tough time playing horsie, which leads to Wally's safe. He dishes out great piles of his money via an improvised slot machine. A trick ball that returns to the thrower fools Woody a couple of times, but when he substitutes an iron ball, Wally moves to the basement, but suddenly. Wally tries to discipline Woody with a stick of dynamite inside the trick ball, but his trick boomerangs, and he's blown into a hospital wheelchair that's equipped with a machine gun. Woody escapes by diving through the end title.\n\nWatch Now:Amazon\n\n# 25 - Sliphorn King of Polaroo\n\nWoody Woodpecker and Friends - Season 1945 - Episode 3\n\nThe show opens with a tremendous storm at sea. The lone survivor is Jackson, a lion who also happens to be a jazz trombone player. The boat is finally shipwrecked in the Arctic, where the lion floats ashore, lands on an ice floe of some sort, and is rescued by penguins. He's so admired for his trombone playing that he's crowned king of the mystical kingdom of Polaroo. The usual \"natives embracing the white explorer\" phenomenon, but tongue in cheek.\n\n# 26 - Crow Crazy\n\nWoody Woodpecker and Friends - Season 1945 - Episode 5\n\nAndy Panda, as a farmer, has a fine-looking field of corn about ready for the harvest. However, a flock of crows has discovered the corn and is busily devouring every kernel in sight when Andy discovers what's going on. He rushes out into the cornfield and fires a shotgun into the air. The crows fly away in every direction- all, that is to say, but one crow who continues to eat undisturbed. After many futile attempts to get rid of the wise-guy crow, Andy finds that he's unable to cope with the crow's sagacity. Andy then calls in his dumb dog Milo for assistance in keeping the crows from eating his corn, especially the one who's causing all the trouble. Again, the crow outsmarts the dog, with disastrous results for both Andy and Milo. Finally, the crow is seen rowing a boat filled with corn away into the sunset as Andy and Milo watch his departure with undisguised chagrin, and not a little relief.\n\n# 27 - The Poet & Peasant\n\nWoody Woodpecker and Friends - Season 1946 - Episode 1\n\nAndy Panda is conducting the Hollywood Washbowl Orchestra in a Sunday afternoon concert. It's one of those afternoons when everything goes wrong. A frog gets entangled in Andy's wig, but he finally manages to extricate himself. Andy's stiff shirt front catches on a nail. Yank and jerk as he will, it won't come loose. The orchestra, following every yank and jerk, goes into a very snappy jam session. A pig, a squirrel, a flock of birds and a cat do their best to interrupt the concert, but in spite of everything, Andy manages to hold forth and keep the musicians playing. An adagio dance by two ducks is interrupted by a hungry fox who starts to chase the ducks.\n\n# 28 - Apple Andy\n\nWoody Woodpecker and Friends - Season 1946 - Episode 3\n\nAndy Panda is very fond of apples and he eats a bushel of green apples, falls asleep and has a nightmare in which the devil is trying to entice him into Hades and stuffs him full of apple juice, applesauce and more apples. (In Andy's defense, since Andy was taught not to eat green apples, the devil had spray-painted the green apples red.)\n\n# 31 - Kiddie Koncert\n\nWoody Woodpecker and Friends - Season 1948 - Episode 3\n\nWally Walrus is the conductor at a local schoolhouse who conducts the entire school band to the tune of \"Morning, Noon, and Night in Vienna\". Among the gags set to music: A skunk is forced to play his instrument outside, a caterpillar resting on a guitar is pursued by the rooster playing it, and one boy uses his knitting needles to play the drums (when he plays a rather long piece, he knits two pairs of socks!). The piece ends when Wally becomes entangled with bubble gum that one boy has been blowing through his trumpet.\n\n# 32 - Pixie Picnic\n\nWoody Woodpecker and Friends - Season 1948 - Episode 5\n\nThe Pixies of the forest are having a picnic. Their band is playing \"La Gazza Ladra Overture,\" led by a little old bewhiskered Pixie on a toadstool. Their instruments are improvised from flowers, spider webs, etc. A bee pesters one Pixie, while a box of pepper causes several others to sneeze. The cooks get too much stuffing in the turkey, which explodes, scrambling the food and musicians. One Pixie almost drowns in the cider well, but he hiccups himself out and onto the bowling green, where he tries to bowl. He finally fires the ball out of a cannon, lets loose an avalanche of giant pumpkins, squash, melons, etc., and breaks up the picnic.\n\n# 34 - Dog Tax Dodgers\n\nWoody Woodpecker and Friends - Season 1948 - Episode 8\n\nAndy reads in the newspaper that dog catcher Wally Walrus is coming to collect $3.00 worth of dog tax from every dog owner. Being kind of a cheapskate, he hides his dog in the closet from Wally's presence but, upon entering Andy's house, Wally still suspects something is amiss. He uses a trained flea to reveal the dog who gets chased by Wally into a pond in the backyard. After \"fishing\" the dog out, Wally demands Andy pay his $3.00 but both are in for a surprise: the dog has an entire litter of puppies each worth an additional $3.00!\n\n# 35 - Scrappy Birthday\n\nWoody Woodpecker and Friends - Season 1949 - Episode 1\n\nFor her birthday, Andy presents his sweetheart, Miranda, with her usual present, candy and flowers. Miranda complains she wants something decent for her birthday like a fur coat...which Andy can't afford. A con man tells him he doesn't need money. He sells him a tracking hound and tells him he can hunt for the fox himself. Unfortunately, the fox Andy and his hound find has no intentions of being caught. Eventually, Andy does capture an animal to make a fur stole with. It's not the fox but, rather, something that's more of a surprise."
