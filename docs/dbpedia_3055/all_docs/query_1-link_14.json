        "text": "Donald Duck, an ill-tempered, squawking cartoon duck who was Walt Disney’s second most famous cartoon character after Mickey Mouse and who enjoyed worldwide popularity as the star of animated films, newspaper comic strips, comic books, and television. Donald Duck’s first film appearance was in a supporting role in The Wise Little Hen (1934), which was an episode of Walt Disney’s Silly Symphonies series of cartoon shorts. Clarence Nash supplied Donald Duck’s distinctively angry, nasal voice in films, and animator Dick Lundy created most of Donald’s irascible screen personality.\n\nDonald wears the middy blouse of a sailor suit and a sailor’s hat, at the drop of which he often explodes into a rage. He has so little tolerance for frustration that he would shoot an annoying insect with a shotgun rather than pursue it patiently with a flyswatter. In the late 1930s Donald was joined by his perennial girlfriend, Daisy Duck, and by his three mischievous nephews, Huey, Dewey, and Louie. During World War II, Donald starred in patriotic film cartoons such as Der Fuehrer’s Face, which won a 1942 Academy Award for best cartoon short subject.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nDisney Quiz\n\nDonald Duck cartoons were a staple of television entertainment. Donald’s likeness has appeared internationally on toys, clothing, and other merchandise."
