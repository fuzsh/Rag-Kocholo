        "text": "Scooby-Doo teams up with Courage the Cowardly Dog in a brand-new animated movie!\n\n​\n\nStraight Outta Nowhere: Scooby-Doo Meets Courage the Cowardly Dog\n\nRelease Date - September 14, 2021 (DVD & Digital)\n\nSynopsis: An original animated feature so exciting it’s scratching at the door! Comedy is unleashed when Scooby-Doo, your favorite mystery-solving mutt, teams up for the first time with Courage the Cowardly Dog. The canine colleagues sniff out a strange object in the middle of Nowhere, Kansas, the backwoods hometown of Courage and his owners, Eustace and Muriel Bagge. Soon, the mysterious discovery puts them on the trail of a giant cicada monster and her wacky winged warriors. Fred, Velma, Daphne and Shaggy know that this job is too big for a flyswatter. They’ll need the help of the doggy duo to piece together the puzzle. Can Scooby and Courage overcome their jitters and defeat the insect army before the whole world bugs out? Try not to get scared. We double-dog dare you!\n\nStraight Outta Nowhere: Scooby-Doo Meets Courage the Cowardly Dog features the familiar voice talents of Frank Welker as Scooby-Doo/Fred Jones, Grey Griffin as Daphne Blake, Matthew Lillard as Shaggy Rogers and Kate Micucci as Velma Dinkley. The film also features Jeff Bergman as Eustice Bagge, Marty Grabstein as Courage the Cowardly Dog and Thea White as Muriel Bagge.\n\nThe movie was executive produced by Sam Register, produced and directed by Cecilia Aranovich and was written by Mike Ryan.\n\nProduced by Warner Bros. Animation, Straight Outta Nowhere: Scooby-Doo Meets Courage the Cowardly Dog finds our favorite teen sleuths in the town of Nowhere, where they meet Courage the Cowardly Dog and investigate what makes Nowhere one of the weirdest places on Earth. The release includes three bonus classic Scooby-Doo! episodes.\n\nThe Bonus Episodes include:\n\nScooby-Doo, Where Are You!, \"Decoy for a Dognapper\"\n\nThe Scooby-Doo/Dynomutt Hour, \"The Gruesome Game of the Gator Ghoul\"\n\nThe Scooby-Doo/Dynomutt Hour, \"Chiller Diller Movie Thriller”\n\nComments?\n\nMod Note: We appreciate and encourage discussion, but please keep your posts civil, relevant and insightful.

I've seen episodes here and there in my youth, but I didn't really grow up with it like many Americans did. I always felt that it's a bit too goofy for my taste, even as a cartoon.\n\nBut to my surprise, this was a pretty solid send-off for Courage the Cowardly Dog. Not only were the characters of both shows written well in accordance to their respective franchise (something writers mess up more easily than you'd expect in a crossover), there's also major recurring characters showing up again on the Courage side of the film (Katz, Le Quack, the General and his Lieutenant, and even the Computer is back!), when a lot of crossover films would just use standalone side characters for the story instead, so it was a nice tribute for the old show.\n\nMore importantly, we finally get a nice explanation for all the weird things happening in Nowhere AT LAST, which again, is fitting for the series finale for the show. That is, of course, assuming they don't do any more Courage entries in the future, which seems fitting with Thea White's passing after voicing Muriel for ALL entries of the Courage franchise, including this one. Speaking of which, I also enjoyed Jeff Bergman's take on Eustace, certainly more than Wallace Shawn's take in The Fog of Courage (which was decent, but sounded nothing like Eustace compared to even Bergman's performance).\n\nThe main plot is functional, but it served its purpose to give Courage fans a good time again with its usual hijinks, and it's a really nice touch that the antagonists turned out to be the recurring antagonists from Courage.\n\nI think the best part of the film is easily Eustace's Outta Nowhere sequence that literally came outta nowhere. I'm glad they gave him the spotlight instead of just making him do his routine grumblings.\n\nOverall, a fun time to be had. I'll miss that purple fluffy pup.\n\n9/10"
