Originally from Auburn, AL, Hot Rod Circuit was made up of Andy Jackson (vocal, rhythm guitar), Casey Prestwood (lead guitar,vocals), Jay Russel (bass,vocals), and Wes Cross (drums). The band can be compared to other post-grunge rock bands such as Jawbox and the Get Up Kids. In their earlier days Hot Rod Circuit was known as Antidote, under which they released the album Mr. Glenbowski. The album earned the group the award of Best Unsigned Bands of 1998 by Musician Magazine. Shortly after the reward, they named themselves Hot Rod Circuit, and with the change in name came a change in scenery, as the band relocated to Connecticut. There they released their debut album under their new moniker, If I Knew Now What I Knew Then. To promote the album the group toured with the Get Up Kids, Jazz June, and At the Drive In. In spring 2002, Hot Rod Circuit released Sorry About Tomorrow, their first for Vagrant. Â« hide
