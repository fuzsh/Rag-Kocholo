        "text": "Major League Fishing (MLF) announced the roster for the 2024 Bass Pro Tour, the sixth season of the professional bass fishing tournament circuit. The field of 80 top bass-fishing professionals will compete across nine states during the Bass Pro Tour season for a total purse of more than $6.7 million.\n\nThe season starts on Jan. 30 at the Bass Pro Tour Stage One at Toledo Bend in Many, Louisiana, and ends in August at the St. Lawrence River in Massena, New York, where the 2024 Bass Pro Tour Angler of Year will be crowned and 40 berths into REDCREST 2025 on Alabama’s Lake Guntersville will be determined.\n\n“We’re excited to announce the Bass Pro Tour roster for the 2024 season,” said Kathy Fennel, Executive Vice President & General Manager of Major League Fishing. “The Bass Pro Tour represents the highest level of competition our sport has to offer, and nowhere is that more evident than in the field of anglers who will be competing in 2024. It’s going to be an extremely competitive season.”\n\nThe 2024 field is led by 2023 Bass Pro Tour Angler of the Year (AOY) Matt Becker, as well as two-time Bass Pro Tour AOY Jacob Wheeler and 2019 AOY/REDCREST champion Edwin Evers. Also returning are multi-time MLF winner Ott DeFoe, 2023 REDCREST champion Bryan Thrift, multi-time Bass Pro Tour winner and REDCREST 2021 champion Dustin Connell, and up-and-coming superstars Alton Jones, Jr. and Dakota Ebare. REDCREST 2022 Champion Bobby Lane will also return to the lineup via a Champions Exemption after a one-year hiatus from the Tour. The 2024 field includes 29 anglers who have won either a major-circuit Angler of the Year title or national tour-level championship.\n\nOf the 24 states represented, Alabama, the site of REDCREST 2024 on Lay Lake in Birmingham (March 14-17), leads the way with 13 anglers. Tennessee is home to 10 anglers fishing the Bass Pro Tour, followed by seven pros from Arkansas.\n\nNew to the Bass Pro Tour roster for 2024 are 12 rookies who qualified via the 2023 Tackle Warehouse Invitationals: Ron Nelson (Michigan), Matthew Stefan (Wisconsin), Keith Carson (Florida), Martin Villa (Virginia), Grae Buck (Pennsylvania), Nick Hatfield (Tennessee), Marshall Robinson (South Carolina), Drew Gill (Illinois), Colby Schrumpf (Illinois), Jason Vance (Indiana), Justin Cooper (Louisiana), and Joshua Weaver (Georgia).\n\n“Making the jump from the Invitationals to the Bass Pro Tour is one of the most challenging transitions in all of bass fishing,” said MLF Bass Pro Tour Tournament Director Daniel Fennel. “Our 2024 rookies are a very talented group, and they have all had great success as they worked their way through the ranks. I think they’re going to challenge our Bass Pro Tour veterans and provide some stout competition throughout the season.”\n\nInvitations to compete in the MLF Bass Pro Tour are earned by performance in the previous year’s Bass Pro Tour, overall lifetime BPT average and performance in the previous year’s Tackle Warehouse Invitationals.\n\nThe 2024 MLF Bass Pro Tour will air on Discovery Channel beginning in July 2024 and Outdoor Channel in early 2025.\n\nFor compete details and up-to-date tournament information, visit MajorLeagueFishing.com.
