Unlike many contemporaries, Brian delves into the worlds and underworlds of his subjects to expose what makes them tick, move and live. His ability to develop the true individual in front of the lens is what makes him a master at telling stories on film.\n\nRaised in New York City, Brian was exposed to art in all of its forms from a young age. When he was old enough to take off on the subways alone, he began to explore the bustling and sometimes dangerous terrains of underground film, music and street art. Realizing his need to create and express himself, Brian has toured the world in punk bands, embellished the streets of New York with raw artwork, and studied the most exploitative forms of film the world has to offer.\n\nHis captivating documentaries have won awards, as well as toured theatres from Los Angeles to New York and Asia to Australia. His ability to gain the trust and respect of the artists in his work have brought him places others would not be allowed; whether it be traveling along side the Motorcycle Cannon Ball cross-country for 4 weeks or entering the private home studios of painters Robert Williams and Keith Wesner or inside the South Central Los Angeles and Long Beach garages of The Cavaliers. They all know Brian will capture their true essence and deliver their stories the way they must be told.\n\nBrian Darwas’ films include: This is Long Beach, White Knuckle, The Road to Bonneville, The Sweet Sickness, and The Devil at Your Feet, and hiis latest film Three Mile. His films have won best documentary awards at The Berkeley Film Festival (California), Motorcycle Film Festival (New York and India), Kingston Film Festival (New York), and Hotrods & Monsters Film Festival (Seattle). In addition, Brian has been interviewed and featured as a filmmaker in The Rodder’s Journal, Jalopy Journal, Street Rodder, Rod and Custom, Rod and Kulture Illustrated, Hot Rod Magazine, Hemmings Motor News, Rolls and Pleats, Kustoms Illustrated, Hot Rods Illustrated, Old School Rods, and Custom Car (UK).\n\n[/box_light]\n\n[divider]\n\n(this article is made possible by)"
