        "text": "Becoming a new mom is a beautiful, transformative experience, but it also comes with sleepless nights, endless diaper changes, and adjusting to an entirely new routine. If you’re looking to spoil a new mom in your life, thoughtful gifts can go a long way in making her feel supported and pampered.\n\nSummer is here, and Auburn-Opelika, Alabama, is the perfect place to soak up the sun and make unforgettable memories. Whether you're a local or just visiting, this summer bucket list will ensure you experience the best our charming area has to offer.\n\nAs a new mom, I have LOTS of opinions on what to gift a mama for Mother’s Day. At the top of my list? A massage and a day all to myself. Followed by lots of cuddles from a very smiley baby who doesn’t fuss one bit. Does that sound realistic? Ha, if you’re wondering what the mamas in your life would love and appreciate, I’ve curated a list of thoughtful gifts and experiences that are sure to make her day extra special…\n\nDid you know that Auburn-Opelika has a mural trail? Ever since moving to Alabama, I’ve watched some EYE CATCHING murals pop up seemingly overnight (like beautiful painted magic). Sharing my favorites on the blog!\n\nSince George works for the Auburn baseball team, we spend a lot of time at the ballpark. As baseball season heats up, the weather can't make up its mind, but down here in the south, we're ready for anything! Spending hours soaking up the sunshine at the ballpark means dressing smart with layers.\n\nSpring is springing and with the sunshine, I have overloaded my shopping cart with cute new items! You can catch me during the warmer months almost exclusively in dresses.\n\nPunxsutawney Phil predicted that spring would come early and, judging by the amount of flowering trees around town, I believe he was correct! Ever since moving to the southeast, spring has been my favorite season. Sharing a few of my spring bucket list items…\n\nAs an avid burger fan, I have quested to find the best burgers in Auburn-Opelika. Pretty sure ranking hamburgers for the sake of foodie journalism would have been my dream job…\n\nTrying to keep a blog recent and relevant while simultaneously trying to keep a tiny human alive and also keep your sanity has been a challenge. And through the chaos there have been a few things that have brought me a little extra joy…"
