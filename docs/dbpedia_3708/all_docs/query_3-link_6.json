AL.com reporters Jared Boyd, Mary Colurso and Matt Wake determined the top 35 musicians born in Alabama. Here's a look at their picks, in no particular order.\n\nHank Williams, Sr.\n\nBirthplace: Mount Olive\n\n“Move It On Over” was released almost 70 years ago, and anyone in the metaphorical doghouse with their significant other this very second can still relate. Such was Hank Williams’ way with turning a phrase. And with singing those phrases. In showbiz, kids, they call that stuff star-power. Williams had it pouring out of ashen skin – a lot of it having to do with balancing light and dark, sanctified and sultry. For every “Jambalaya” there was an “I’ll Never Get Out of This Life Alive.” For every “I Saw the Light,” a “Hey Good Lookin’.” Like many riveting artists, Williams was always teetering between being dangerous and being catchy. It eventually caught up to him, in the backseat of a Cadillac in 1953 on the way to another show. Unlike rock, R&B and rap which each took time to evolve to their respective zeniths, what a drag it must be to be every country singer/songwriter since Williams and know you’ll never beat what that 1953 corpse did.\n\n- Matt Wake\n\nLionel Richie\n\nBirthplace: Tuskegee\n\nCan you say \"superstar\"? In many ways, Lionel Richie, 67, is a perfect example of the term. He's achieved superlative success, fusing pop with R&B in delightful, dramatic, often highly danceable ways. Using his years with the Commodores as a solid springboard, Richie forged a solo career that dominated radio stations (and MTV's video rotation) during the 1980s. He released a string of multiplatinum albums, spinning off signature songs such as \"Truly,\" \"My Love,\" \"You Are,\" \"All Night Long (All Night),\" \"Hello,\" \"Penny Lover,\" \"Say You, Say Me,\" \"Dancing on the Ceiling,\" and \"Running With the Night.\" Sometimes called \"the black Barry Manilow\" — a compliment or a criticism, depending on your point of view — Richie excelled in the music world and returned to it in the late '90s as a household name. This singer, songwriter and producer continues to connect with new generations of fans, and his oh-so-catchy songbook has enduring appeal.\n\n- Mary Colurso\n\nEmmylou Harris\n\nBirthplace: Birmingham\n\nPrecise and elegant, versatile and creative, Emmylou Harris stands out from the crowd. Over the course of her long and distinguished career, Harris, 69, has set the gold standard for singer-songwriters in the Americana world. Declining to be pigeonholed as folk or country during the 1970s, she nimbly genre-hopped, adding bluegrass, rock and other rootsy sounds to her repertoire. Her partnership with Gram Parsons? Legendary. Her collaborations with a score of other artists, from John Prine to Willie Nelson to Rodney Crowell? Exquisite. Her respect among her peers? Unparalleled. Harris might not be the showiest chart-topper, but she's won 13 Grammy Awards, released more than 20 albums and consistently proved her worth. Her catalog of originals and covers includes gems such as \"Boulder to Birmingham,\" \"Pancho and Lefty,\" \"Red Dirt Girl,\" \"If I Could Only Win Your Love,\" \"Hard Bargain\" and many more. She remains a reliable stunner, making music that matters.\n\n- Mary Colurso\n\nEddie Levert\n\nBirthplace: Bessemer\n\nThe shag-carpet crushing unity jam “Love Train.” The elegant strings-swaddled smash “Back Stabbers.” The dramatic phased whoosh of “For the Love of Money.” Eddie Levert’s yearning lead vocals gave The O’Jays sleek Philadelphia soul a bluesy backbone on those and other essential recordings. Fueled by a stack of Gamble & Huff-written hits, which also included “Now That We Found Love,” “Use Ta Be My Girl” and “Give the People What They Want,” the O’Jays tracks would go on to become a favorite of TV and film music supervisors. With their shiny matching suits and groovy choreography this Canton, Ohio-formed vocal group has always been smooth. Levert’s vocals added just the right of scuff.\n\n- Matt Wake\n\nEddie Floyd\n\nBirthplace: Montgomery\n\nThe superstitious ritual of knocking on wood to protect yourself from jinxing your fortunes is believed by experts to date back to early British history centuries ago. But, the act of knocking on wood nor the phrase \"knock on wood\" didn't get funky until it ended up in Eddie Floyd's hands. For that, American music lovers are forever in gratitude. Many have covered the song without ever coming close to the thick, lively baritone of the originator. Even though \"Knock\" has afforded Floyd enduring popularity in oldies radio formats, it isn't his highest charting hit. That distinction goes to \"Bring it On Home\". Yeah. I'm surprised, too. But, what is no surprise is that Floyd wasn't a fly-by-night star. He is a tenured soul man, still doing his thing today. The list of album cuts worth everyone's while in his Stax and Malaco catalog is way too long to even attempt shouting out names of songs. If you pass by a Floyd 7-inch or LP in your local record store, chances are it's quality. He's one of the slickest in the game!\n\n- Jared Boyd\n\nJason Isbell\n\nBirthplace: Greenhill\n\nYou know how people like to snicker about how all formerly hell-raising musicians make lame music once they get sober? Jason Isbell completely dispelled that crock. In 2013, after going to rehab, the former Jack Daniel's enthusiast released the clear-eyed LP \"Southeastern.\" Tracks like \"Cover Me Up,\" \"Stockholm\" and \"Super 8\" set the standard for 21st century Americana. A master of story-songs since his Drive-By Truckers days penning war-horses like \"Dress Blues,\" four albums into his solo career Isbell was putting more of himself into his material than ever. Love and sobriety fueled \"Southeastern.\" In 2015, Isbell followed with an even more compelling disc. \"Something More Than Free\" songs like \"Children of Children\" and \"Hudson Commodore\" were four-minute, aural novels. Isbell's Grammy-winning cut \"24 Frames\" contained a lyric Bob Dylan would be happy to write: \"You thought God was an architect. Now you know. He's something like a pipe-bomb ready to blow.\"\n\n- Matt Wake\n\nPercy Sledge\n\nBirthplace: Leighton\n\nThe song outlived him and it will outlive you and me too. Percy Sledge’s chart-topping 1966 ballad “When a Man Loves a Woman” is the kind of track you can hang an entire career on. The song’s lyrics convey sentiments anyone who's ever had their heart broken – or broken someone else’s - can feel. Still it’s the conviction, feel and wallop of Sledge’s church-honed voice that sells “When a Man Loves a Woman” over. Especially on those high notes during the bridge. Even though the song’s been played a trillion times by now and been used in countless sappy TV and movie scenes, the emotional impact hasn’t been diluted. (Even though the trumpet’s out of tune.) A Rock and Roll Hall of Famer, Sledge scored other hits during his career, including \"Take Time to Know Her,\" \"Warm and Tender Love,\" \"It Tears Me Up,\" \"Cover Me\" and \"I'll Be Your Everything.\" But after “When A Man Loves a Woman,” he didn’t need to give us anything else.\n\n- Matt Wake\n\nSun Ra\n\nBirthplace: Birmingham\n\nSun Ra, in name, describes a man whose life encompassed many monikers, sounds and ideologies. Born Herman Poole Blount, Sun Ra's impact on Earth redefined the expectations of a mere composer. Instead, he carried himself in a manner similar to that of a spiritual leader. Sun Ra led his stable of musicians, known as an \"The Arkestra,\" in teachings that felt like a cosmic cousin to comparable Black theologies such as the Nation of Islam. Tying Ra to his Birmingham roots almost seems cruel, as his constant fixation on outer space suggests no city or state was suitable enough to contain his perception of reality. This isn't your typical jazz man. And, although his boundless approach to the genre might sound like a jumbled mosaic to listeners who have yet to be oriented, meticulous execution is ever apparent in Sun Ra's recordings.\n\n- Jared Boyd\n\nBrittany Howard\n\nBirthplace: Athens\n\nAs a vocalist, Brittany Howard is an undisputed supernova. Soulful. Powerful. Transcendent. A magnetic live performer, with an increasingly iconoclastic fashion sense. But what separates Howard, 27, from damn near every other rock musician in her generation is her musical creativity. With Howard at the controls, Alabama Shakes took a giant step forward on the Athens band’s sophomore album “Sound & Color.” Shades of psychedelia, alt-rock and Afro-beat spiked the garage-soul the Shakes rode to fame on their frisky but overrated 2012 debut “Boys & Girls.” The much more sonically interesting “Sound & Color” songs, like the title track, “Gemini,” “Dunes” and “Don’t Wanna Fight,” blew listeners away, won multiple Grammys and made us all wonder where Howard will take the Shakes to next.\n\n- Matt Wake\n\nEddie Kendricks\n\nBirthplace: Union Springs\n\nThe Temptations was a group filled with a storied cast of characters. Among them, there were many Alabamans (Melvin Franklin, Paul Williams and Dennis Edwards were born in the state). With all due respect to group co-founder Melvin, Eddie Kendricks stands out as the most essential of the Alabama Temps, taking lead on \"The Way You Do the Things You\" and \"Just My Imagination.\" At the Temptations' height, David Ruffin was their fire, but Kendricks was their ice. And when I say the man was cool....! Without four soul stars behind him, Eddie forged his way into a consistent solo career with albums that still stand the test of time. Critically, Kendricks' output is impenetrable. Disco hit \"Keep on Truckin'\" was a sneak-diss of sorts; a nod to his continued success after leaving his old compatriots. \"My People Hold On\" and \"Intimate Friends\" are two deep cuts that have kept his legacy alive through incessant sampling in the hip-hop and R&B world.\n\n- Jared Boyd\n\nNat King Cole\n\nBirthplace: Montgomery\n\nHis music is timeless. But those four words really don’t suffice to explain the velvety genius of Nat King Cole (1919-1965). More than 50 years after his death, he remains the ultimate crooner, making hearts beat faster with his indelible interpretations of classic songs such as “Unforgettable,” “Mona Lisa,” “Stardust,” “Smile” and “When I Fall in Love.” A jazz pianist and composer, as well as a singer, Nathaniel Adams Coles helped to define the Great American Songbook. His work in the jazz trio format was groundbreaking, and although he faced racism — vigilantes stormed the stage in 1956, for example, when Cole performed one of two segregated concerts at Birmingham’s Boutwell Auditorium — he was extremely popular with fans both black and white. Cole also broke through color barriers in broadcasting, sponsoring a radio program, “King Cole Trio Time,” in the 1940s and hosting a TV variety show, “The Nat King Cole Show,” in the 1950s.\n\n- Mary Colurso\n\nJimmy Hall\n\nBirthplace: Birmingham\n\nWe may be far removed in time from the 1970s, Wet Willie's heyday in the southern rock scene. But you can be sure that, Lord willin', there will be many years ahead in which Jimmy Hall will be fluttering around onstage, jumping from lead vocals to saxophone to harmonica with ease. Born in Birmingham and raised in Mobile, Hall continues to leave so much of himself on stage that it can even prove to be laborious for onlookers to behold, with energy so infectious that you simply cannot remain seated. Hall nabbed a Top 40 hit with his 1980 solo single, \"I'm Happy That Love Has Found You\", contributing to the calming yacht rock that provided the early part of the decade with a more adult-contemporary counterpart to new wave sensibilities. Fans would likely agree, though, that Hall's voice is better suited for uptempo, red-hot soul. He does it like none other.\n\n- Jared Boyd\n\nJamey Johnson\n\nBirthplace: Enterprise\n\nHe's honest and authentic. Tough and tender. Emotional yet understated. And oh, so talented. Singer-songwriter Jamey Johnson has defied Nashville trends, earning fame for ruggedly poetic songs that stand toe-to-toe with some of the best anthems in traditional country music. Johnson's big break came in 2008 with \"That Lonesome Song,\" an album that included his smash single \"In Color.\" This nostalgic ballad made listeners teary — in a very good way — and earned awards from the Country Music Association and Academy of Country Music, along with a Grammy nomination. It also set the tone for the rest of Johnson's career, as he follows his own muse in a stubbornly independent way. Does he continually top the charts? No. But Johnson, 41, is the real deal.\n\n- Mary Colurso\n\nOdetta\n\nBirthplace: Birmingham\n\nOdetta, a majestic folk, blues and gospel singer, did much more than perform for rapt audiences. She helped to change the world, raising consciousness and evoking thought during the civil rights movement. After coming up in folk clubs and touring around the country, the woman born Odetta Holmes (1930-2008) made her strongest mark by performing with fervent grace at marches and rallies. She knew how to combine protest with inspiration. She called for change in a memorable and meaningful way. Pete Seeger and Woody Guthrie were her contemporaries. Bob Dylan and Joan Baez were her followers. Rosa Parks and Martin Luther King Jr. were her admirers. Her cover of \"We Shall Overcome\" became a staple for freedom fighters, and she sang \"O Freedom\" at the 1963 March on Washington. Odetta was beloved by celebrities and foot soldiers during her lifetime, and she remains a symbol of hope and freedom.\n\n- Mary Colurso\n\nBig Mama Thornton\n\nBirthplace: Ariton\n\nBig Mama Thornton is one the great examples of a truly unsung American icon. The original performer of Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller's \"Hound Dog,\" three years prior to Elvis' rendition, Mama might not be a household name. What she lacks in notoriety, she makes up for with an abundance of spunk, commanding audiences by belting out lyrics from the pit of her gut, all with a big, snaggle-toothed smile. Let's keep it real, her foot-stompin' \"Hound Dog\" is superior to the Presley classic. Even before considering Thornton's actual delivery of the material, the song's narrative was written with a sick'n'tired woman in mind. Thornton perfectly portrays the woes a participant in a worn-out relationship, writhe with infidelity. Remove that context, and the song changes dramatically. Unfortunately, this example would not signify the last time Thornton's rhythm & blues work was co-opted to spark a rock 'n' roll legend. Janis Joplin covered Thornton's \"Ball n' Chain\" to great success in the late 1960s. Talk about Big Mama drama!\n\n- Jared Boyd\n\nCandi Staton\n\nBirthplace: Hanceville\n\nBe mindful with Candi Staton. If you allow yourself to, you may look back on her career as the \"First Lady of Southern Soul\" and regard her as the undeniable vocal force and sex symbol that she was during her tenure among the talent at Muscle Shoal's FAME Recording Studios. You wouldn't be wrong, but you might want to also acknowledge her beginnings and current endeavors as an accomplished gospel artist. Personal liberation is a theme that has come full circle in Staton's career. Her 1976 disco smash \"Young Hearts Run Free\" described a desperate tale of a woman longing to break out of an abusive romance. Her latest inspirational album is titled \"It's Time to Be Free.\" This time, her message relates to freedom from sin and despair in favor of God's mercies. Her message and image may have shifted, but her broad, home-grown voice has been unwavering throughout countless titles in her discography.\n\n- Jared Boyd\n\nWilson Pickett\n\nBirthplace: Prattville\n\nIt’s the kind of sandpapery treble-gashing tone white rockers have been aiming for, well, since white dudes have been rocking. Wilson Pickett’s rasp was the real deal though. Pickett broke through on swaggering 1965 cut “In the Midnight Hour,” which the singer co-wrote with guitarist Steve Cropper at the same Memphis hotel civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. would be shot outside of, about three years later. “The Wicked” Pickett continued his rise with slinky 1966 smash “Mustang Sally.” The following year he released a Southern R&B version of The Beatles’ “Hey Jude,” featuring a Duane Allman guitar solo Eric Clapton has called one of his all-time favorites. Allman’s solo is killer. But Pickett’s plate-reverb rattling screams during the coda are goosebumps-inducing.\n\n- Matt Wake\n\nMattie Moss Clark\n\nBirthplace: Selma\n\n\"Is My Living in Vain\" Dr. Mattie Moss Clark asks on one her most famous performances, a song written by her daughter Twinkie Clark. No one at AL.com proclaims to be the final judge of eternal rewards, but we certainly believe Clark's contributions to gospel music are worth her nomination to this list. Clark is the mother of five daughters whom she coached to their own celebrated gospel careers. As a minister and teacher, Clark is unmatched. Moreover, her voice, organ work and songwriting live on as unparalleled, even to this day. Modern music in the black church stand on her shoulders.\n\n- Jared Boyd\n\nJimmy Johnson\n\nBirthplace: Sheffield\n\nAlthough Jimmy Johnson is known for his studio work, to truly appreciate his guitar playing it helps to see the man play live. To hear and see all the subtle things he does. Because the beauty of Johnson’s playing lies not in galaxy melting super solos, but in nifty chord inversions, percussive right-hand stuff and concise single-line bursts. Like his fellow Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section colleagues, Johnson has compiled a marvelous body of recordings. Wilson Pickett. Aretha. Percy Sledge. Paul Simon. Cher. Staples Singers. Bob Seger. Bobby “Blue” Bland. Etta James. And oh yeah, Johnson was also the recording engineer when the Rolling Stones cut “Brown Sugar,” “Wild Horses” and “You Gotta Move” in the Shoals.\n\n- Matt Wake\n\nGucci Mane\n\nBirthplace: Bessemer\n\nGucci Mane was almost lumped into our recent list of the South's Most Underrated Rappers, as many longtime fans of the genre dismiss his lazy drawl as a detracting factor to his steady, metered rap flow. It isn't easy to rhyme so precisely in the pocket like Gucci, though. In fact, in an interview with VladTV.com in 2006, Gucci cited his Alabama upbringing as the secret ingredient to his success. \"I get my diction, the way I speak and talk from Alabama,\" he says. \"But, I get the words I choose from Atlanta. That's what makes me probably the best rapper in the world right now.\" Was Gucci probably the best rapper in the world then? No. However, despite several stints in prison, he's proven himself to be a hip-hop mainstay since then, even finding time to share the wealth by orchestrating the careers of hip-hop's foremost stars. He's kick-started the careers of Migos, Future, Young Dolph, Nicki Minaj, Waka Flocka Flame and many more. And after rumors that he was killed and cloned before being released again from prison in May, Gucci's unrelenting work ethic doesn't seem to be slowing down one bit.\n\n- Jared Boyd\n\nChuck Leavell\n\nBirthplace: Birmingham\n\nChuck Leavell's resume is ridiculous: By the age of 20, he was a member of the Allman Brothers Band, playing rollicking, sparkling piano on such songs as \"Jessica,\" \"Southbound,\" \"Ramblin' Man.\" Ten years later, Leavell began touring stadiums with the Rolling Stones. He's been a fixture with the Stones ever since, recording, performing and serving as musical director for \"The World's Greatest Rock and Roll Band.\" Later on, Leavell tracked piano and organ for upstart blues-rockers Black Crowes' multi-platinum 1990 debut \"Shake Your Money Maker,\" which featured the hits \"Hard to Handle,\" \"She Talks to Angels\" and Jealous Again.\" He also did time with Eric Clapton, contributing significantly to the guitar god's Grammy-winning acoustic disc \"Unplugged.\" We haven't even gotten to Leavell's George Harrison and Dr. John credits yet.\n\n- Matt Wake\n\nW.C. Handy\n\nBirthplace: Florence\n\nIf American music has a Rushmore, W.C. Handy might not be a popular choice among contemporary listeners, but music historians would likely rally around his importance to the infrastructure of the industry. A highly touted trumpeter and band leader, Handy further cemented his legacy by honing in on legitimizing the business of Southern rural folkways by making strides in sheet music composition and publishing. Songs like \"The Memphis Blues\" and \"The St. Louis Blues\" are a far cry from the Top 40 fare today, but Handy was an early American pop star due to his accessible blues-ragtime fusions. His repertoire offered something for everyone, reaching across color lines, genre and tastes. That's the tried and true formula of pop in this country. It's hard to think of him in the same light as our current, selfie-crazed, teeny-bopping music staples. That's essentially what we was, though.\n\n- Jared Boyd\n\nDavid Hood\n\nBirthplace: Sheffield\n\nIf it’s a ’60s or ’70s hit and you can sing the bass line to, there’s a decent chance that’s David Hood’s playing – regardless of genre. The Staple Singers' gospel-soul jam \"I'll Take You There.” Paul Simon's \"Loves Me Like A Rock.\" Jimmy Cliff's \"Sitting In Limbo.\" Etta James’ “Tell Mama.” Bob Seger's rock ballad \"Mainstreet.” Hood supplied rubbery, propulsive low-end to Traffic’s jammy 1975 disc “Shootout At The Fantasy Factory” and on that British band’s live album that followed, “On the Road.” As a founding member of the Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section, he’s also played on sessions ranging from Aretha Franklin and Clarence Carter to Frank Black and The Waterboys. A credit Hood likely takes more pride in than any others mentioned above: fathering Drive-By Truckers band leader Patterson Hood.\n\n- Matt Wake\n\nPatterson Hood\n\nBirthplace: Muscle Shoals\n\nSpeaking of the devil! With guitars enveloping his thin, raspy voice, Patterson Hood and the Drive-By Truckers are an undisputed treasure in southern rock. A mainstay since the mid-1990s, DBT's revolving door of talent has accomplished several stylistic shifts, to which Hood always adapted comfortably. Fans are now associating pockets of Alabama's music scene as hotbeds for \"Americana.\" Buzz-word? Maybe. Umbrella term? Totally. But, whatever it truly means, it is hard to think that guys like the younger Hood didn't help shape the Alabaman identity associated with the phrasing.\n\n- Jared Boyd\n\nSpooner Oldham\n\nBirthplace: Center Star\n\nRemoving Spooner Oldham from Muscle Shoals music history would leave a lake-sized hole. He played the Wurlitzer licks that set the sexy tone for Aretha Franklin's smoldering 1967 hit \"I Never Loved a Man (The Way I Love You)\" from the very first note. Oldham also played on other Franklin hits like “Respect” and “Chain of Fools.” As well as contributing organ to Wilson Pickett’s “Mustang Sally” and Percy Sledge's \"When A Man Loves A Woman.” A member of studio musician collective Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section, aka The Swampers, Oldham also made his mark co-writing hits with Dan Penn including “I’m Your Puppet,” “Cry Like a Baby” and “A Woman Left Lonely.” Session work on Neil Young’s woodsy 1972 LP “Harvest” led to a long-running gig on the road with Young. Newer generations of musicians, like Amos Lee and Cat Power, have enlisted Oldham for recordings too, looking to tap into his smoky sound.\n\n- Matt Wake\n\nClarence Carter\n\nBirthplace: Montgomery\n\nHe's got soul. Clarence Carter, 80, never needed schooling in that department, although the blind artist did learn to transcribe arrangements and music charts in Braille. His life story is almost as compelling as his music; Carter taught himself to play guitar during his childhood and went on to graduate from Alabama State College in 1960 with a bachelor's degree in music. He made a few forays into the nightclub and recording worlds before coming into his own, teaming with Rick Hall at FAME Studios during the late '60s and early '70s. In Muscle Shoals, Carter ruled during his studio sessions, imbuing tunes such as \"Slip Away,\" \"Patches,\" \"Too Weak to Fight\" and \"Snatching it Back\" with a blues-meets-country vibe. With stellar singles, Carter earned a firm place in Alabama music history. He's continued to perform and record with earthy authenticity, releasing his latest album, \"Dance to the Blues,\" in 2015.\n\n- Mary Colurso\n\nClarence Fountain\n\nBirthplace: Tyler\n\nHis life story sounds like a Hollywood movie, with joy and hardship in nearly equal doses. A blind boy from rural Alabama finds his voice in a challenging school, forms a group of like-minded singers, overcomes adversity and brings gospel music to the masses. Clarence Fountain, founding leader of the Blind Boys of Alabama, did all that and more. He was a force to be reckoned with for most of the Blind Boys' history, performing for religious and secular audiences with Alabama-born colleagues such as George Scott, Olice Thomas, Johnny Fields and Jimmy Carter. The Blind Boys, formed in 1939 as the Happy Land Jubilee Singers, harmonized with gusto and kept the faith through good times and bad, recording more than 70 albums with Fountain over seven decades. The group earned new fans in the 1980s by playing a key role in \"The Gospel at Colonus,\" an Obie-winning musical, and experienced a massive career resurgence in 2001 with a blockbuster record, \"Spirit of the Century.\" Fountain stopped touring in the mid-2000s when health problems intervened, but he contributed vocals to a Blind Boys album as recently as 2013. (Fountain, 86, also suffered hardships during this year's flooding in Baton Rouge, prompting the Blind Boys to start a GoFundMe campaign to help him recover.) Several original members of the group have died, but the Blind Boys persevere with newer recruits. Carter, a Birmingham native, assumed leadership of the Blind Boys when Fountain left, and still is going strong.\n\n- Mary Colurso\n\nMartha Reeves\n\nBirthplace: Eufala\n\nIn a time when soul music and pop standards began to overlap at the hands of Berry Gordy's Motown Records, Martha Reeves and her Vandellas were the blueprint for a black redefinition of the \"girl group\". No longer was a there \"Boogie-Woogie Bugle Boy\" or \"Mr. Sandman\" to sing about. Instead, everyone was \"Dancing in the Street\" during a \"Heatwave\". Reeves', like the label that gave her fame, was as street-wise and hip as she was elegant and refined. Unfortunately, unlike Diana Ross, who broke away from the Supremes for solo celebrity in the 1970s and 80s, Reeves was not able to transcend her early success in Detroit. Still, we salute her as a pioneer.\n\n- Jared Boyd\n\nWayne Perkins\n\nBirthplace: Birmingham\n\nPeter Tosh didn’t play the time-slowing wah-wah guitar solo on Bob Marley’s reggae classic “Stir It Up,” Wayne Perkins did. Perkins also played the now iconic solos on other cuts from Bob Marley & The Wailer’s 1973 Island Records debut, including the feedback-laced soaring on “Concrete Jungle” and moonflower slide on “Baby We’ve Got a Date.” Perkins’ Marley connection (he was originally uncredited in the liner notes), and recommendations from Leon Russell and Eric Clapton helped Perkins score an audition for the Rolling Stones after Mick Taylor quit the Stones. Although that gig eventually went to Ron Wood, Perkins’ electrifying, snaky lead lines can be heard on Stones fan faves like “Hand of Fate” and “Worried About You.” Perkins impressive discography also includes work with Joni Mitchell, John Prine, Levon Helm and Albert King. So explain to me why Wayne Perkins isn’t in the Alabama Music Hall of Fame?\n\n- Matt Wake\n\nDan Penn\n\nBirthplace: Vernon\n\nDan Penn and collaborator Chips Moman didn’t have Aretha Franklin specifically in mind when they wrote “Do Right Woman, Do Right Man.” They weren’t think thinking of James Carr when they put together “The Dark End of the Street” either. Both songs, stone cold ’60s R&B essentials. A few years later Janis Joplin chose the Penn/Spooner Oldham song “A Woman Left Lonely” for what became her stirring swansong album “Pearl.” The Penn/Spooner combo crafted “Cry Like a Baby” for the Box Tops, the Alex Chilton led band for whom Penn had produced blue-eyed soul hit “The Letter.” Artists ranging from Otis Redding to Jerry Garcia to Hank Williams Jr. to the Detroit Cobras have cut Penn-penned tunes. Even if you don’t Dan Penn’s name, you’ve likely heard his numbers.\n\n- Matt Wake\n\nJerry Tavin/Everett Collection\n\nErskine Hawkins\n\nBirthplace: Birmingham\n\nBig Band music simply wouldn’t be the same without this fine trumpet player, bandleader and composer. Hawkins created a classic in the genre, 1939’s “Tuxedo Junction,” that’s been influential for generations of jazz musicians and covered by countless ensembles, including the Glenn Miller Orchestra. Hawkins, known as the “20th Century Gabriel,” was a true showman during his heyday in the 1930s-1950s, with a flashy performing style and a knack for hitting high notes. Hawkins and his orchestra were regulars at the Savoy Ballroom in Harlem, eventually becoming the house band. During his long career, Hawkins (1914-1993) recorded many tunes, enjoyed a loyal following and received a long list of honors and awards. No wonder he’s a charter member of the Alabama Jazz Hall of Fame and a distinguished member of the Alabama Music Hall of Fame.\n\n- Mary Colurso\n\nRandy Owen\n\nBirthplace: Fort Payne\n\nPopularity and prestige aren't musically exclusive. Randy Owen, 66, the frontman and figurehead of Alabama, has proved that over and over with his crowd-pleasing, hit-making, award-winning band. Cleverly combining the sounds of country, pop and Southern rock, Alabama crossed the charts and achieved mainstream success — a feat few thought possible in the 1980s. The band developed a loyal fan base early on, and built on that foundation until its fandom rose to a fever pitch. Alabama has more than 20 No. 1 singles to its credit, including iconic songs such as \"Dixieland Delight,\" \"Tennessee River,\" \"The Closer You Get\" and \"Song of the South.\" Owen's contributions to the group cannot be over-emphasized, although he's quick to praise his longtime colleagues, bassist Teddy Gentry and guitarist/fiddler Jeff Cook. (All three are from Fort Payne.) Owen's rich tenor voice, deft songwriting skills and grounded stage presence have been crucial keys to Alabama's success.\n\n[if !supportLineBreakNewLine]\n\n[endif]- Mary Colurso\n\nDinah Washington\n\nBirthplace: Tuscaloosa\n\nDinah Washington is a jazz starlet most notable for chops that felt right on time, while also feeling cutting-edge and innovative. Soul hadn't quite happened, yet, when Dinah burst into popularity. Yet, she remains the link between the tidy distinction of quiet jazz and the eventual soul-stirring holler Black music would eventually muster decades later. Vocals don't get much cleaner than Dinah's pristine recordings. Her great torch songs invoke low light and loved ones from beginning to end. The soft strings and slow-slapping percussion sets the stage for Washington's emotion to cut through.\n\n- Jared Boyd\n\nThe Louvin Brothers\n\nBirthplace: Section\n\nCharlie Elzer Loudermilk (1927-2011) and Ira Lonnie Loudermilk (1924-1965) were pioneers in country and gospel music, developing a \"close harmony\" style that made use of two compelling tenors. Their church roots in Sand Mountain were important to the brothers, as they sang about love, loss, hope, despair … and yes, the wages of sin. Charlie, on guitar, and Ira, on mandolin, made listeners sit up and take notice during their appearances on the Grand Ole Opry during the 1950s, and their professional name, the Louvin Brothers, became known throughout the land. Although their prestige faded during the 1960s — the advent of rock music and Ira's hard-drinking binges made things tough — the Louvins are regarded as elder statesmen of country. Their sound, with its tight and soaring harmonies, has made an impact on artists that range from Emmylou Harris to the Byrds.\n\n- Mary Colurso"
