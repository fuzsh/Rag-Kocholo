        "text": "Here are some important resources for members of the Auburn University Bands.\n\nAU Bands Membership Database & Intent Form\n\nBeginning in Fall 2010 all students interested in trying out for any AU Bands ensemble (Symphonic Band, Concert Band, Campus Band, Marching Band, or Basketball Pep Band) must complete a profile in our AU Bands Membership Database. Once you’ve created a profile, you may then submit an Intent Form through our system.\n\nFor more information, visit the Membership Database information page.\n\nRookie Auburn Tiger (“R.A.T.”) Program\n\nIn the early days of Auburn University, then known as Alabama Polytechnic Institute, freshman students were considered “rats”. The Auburn University Marching Band recalls that tradition with its Rookie Auburn Tiger “R.A.T.” Program for rookie members. The R.A.T. Program is our freshman orientation program for marching band members, and is a unique and beloved tradition of our AUMB.\n\nFor more information, visit the R.A.T. Program page.\n\nTigermail\n\nAuburn University’s official means of communication is email, provided through our Tigermail service. Go to Tigermail »\n\nAU Access\n\nAU Access is the official AU student portal for class registration, parking services, and more. Go to AU Access »\n\nAU Student Web Resources"
