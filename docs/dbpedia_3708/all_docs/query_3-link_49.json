        "text": "By Casey Marsh\n\n“Waaarrrr Eagle, Hey!” Something you have heard many times if you have ever attended an Auburn football game in Jordan-Hare Stadium. Auburn has many incredible traditions, but the pre-game eagle flight is a tradition that is uniquely Auburn!\n\nFor many years, the pre-game eagle flight has been a part of every home football game. Before kickoff the Eagle will take flight circling Jordan-Hare Stadium before landing in the middle of the 50-yard line all while the fans cry “War Eagle, Hey!” The very first eagle flight was in August of 2000 and was flown by an eagle named Tiger (War Eagle VI) during the opening game. Over the years, there have been five eagles who have carried on the tradition of our battle cry and pre-game flight. The names of those eagles are: Tiger (War Eagle VI), Spirit, Nova (War Eagle VII), Aurea (War Eagle VIII), and Independence!\n\nWant to get up close and personal with one of the eagles? The Auburn University Raptor Center is open to the public with an appointment. On Fridays before a home football game, the Raptor Center will put on a presentation called “Football, Fans and Feathers”. You can even take a photo with the eagle after the presentation!\n\nIf you ever get the chance to attend an Auburn football game in Jordan-Hare, be sure to take that opportunity. Many fans, Auburn or not, will attend football games just to get to experience the eagle flight. To ensure that you don’t miss it, you will want to be in your seat at least 25 minutes before kickoff – shaker in hand – ready to watch the eagle fly in all its glory!\n\nAuburn University is truly unmatched in both spirit and tradition, making the week of Homecoming one of the best weeks of the year here on the Plains. We are counting down the days until this year’s Homecoming festivities commence. Homecoming week is beloved as it gives us the opportunity to welcome all members of the Auburn Family back home to campus.\n\nAuburn’s Homecoming tradition dates back to the 1930s and the Auburn Omega Circle of Omicron Delta Kappa (ODK), a national honor society for student leaders with exemplary demonstrations of scholarship, athletic achievement, service, skillful communication, and artistic ability. Auburn’s Circle of ODK presented the idea to the student body of crowning a Miss Homecoming to be honored at halftime of the Homecoming football game for outstanding service to the University. The proposal was well received, and the tradition continued to take shape and in the 1960s, the Homecoming Parade was created.\n\nHomecoming week is comprised of several events, all centered around welcoming Auburn Family members home to campus. Here is everything that you need to know about Homecoming 2022:\n\nHomecoming Kickoff\n\nHomecoming week will begin with Homecoming Kickoff hosted by the Student Government Association and the University Program Council. This year, Kickoff will be held on the Campus Green Space on Tuesday, September 20th, and will include a short program. The program will allow students to hear from this year’s Top 5 Miss Homecoming Candidates, and candidates will be able to share a bit about themselves and their platforms before campaigning officially begins. Immediately following kickoff, at 5pm, ODK will be having its 93rd annual Cake Race.\n\nHomecoming Parade\n\nAt the end of the week, the annual Homecoming Parade will be held. The Homecoming Parade starts at 6 p.m. on Friday, September 23rd and helps cultivate a sense of community, as we welcome all generations of the Auburn Family to campus. The parade will feature floats from campus organizations, as well as participants from the local community. Additionally, the Auburn University Marching Band will perform, along with the Tiger Paws, and Auburn University Cheerleaders. The parade route runs from Samford Hall through downtown Auburn before wrapping up in front of Samford Lawn.\n\nHomecoming Pep Rally\n\nAt the conclusion of the parade at 6:30 p.m., there will be a brief pep rally to excite fans as the tigers gear up to play the University of Missouri in the Homecoming Football game on Saturday. After the pep rally, the Auburn Family is invited to stick around and to participate in ‘Come Home to the Corner’, an event that will run until 9 p.m. and feature live music.\n\nHomecoming Game and the Recognition of Miss Homecoming\n\nHomecoming Week ends with Auburn University taking on the University of Missouri with an 11 a.m. kickoff. Throughout the week prior, students will participate in Miss Homecoming campaigns and will have the opportunity to hear from the Top 5 candidates on the concourse. Students will cast their ballots on Friday. This culminates in the new Miss Homecoming being recognized at halftime.\n\nWe are looking forward to having all generations of the Auburn Family on campus as we celebrate Homecoming 2022! Together we say, War Eagle!\n\nBy: Jaxon Byrd, Assistant Director of Marketing for Tiger Nights\n\nTiger Nights (coordinated by the University Program Council) is your one-stop shop for all things fun.

Tiger Nights is ending the semester with a committee favorite! At the end of April, Tiger Nights is hosting Bingo Night. Come play with your friends to win big.\n\n“And from Auburn, Alabama…”\n\nIf there’s one thing you should know about Auburn, it’s that we are deeply rooted in tradition. You’ve probably heard of or seen our famous “rolling Toomer’s Corner” tradition after a big win, or perhaps you’ve entered Jordan-Hare Stadium a few minutes early to witness our traditional pre-game eagle flight. While these traditions have certainly earned their right to be recognizable and easily accessible to anyone, there are a few sacred traditions that remain unique to only current Auburn students. Affectionately known as “Cater Callouts”, this tradition is a crowd-favorite among students as it encourages a tangible picture of the Auburn Family.\n\nSo, what is Cater Callouts? Well, simply put, it is a fun way for all Auburn students to join together to celebrate and champion other members of the Auburn family. Typically, large organizations, clubs, or involvement groups will hold callouts to officially announce their new members. From the Cheerleading team to Camp War Eagle Counselors to Student Recruiters, Miss Auburn, and SGA titles, callouts is the most fun night of the year as a new group is chosen and celebrated in front of the student body. Instead of these groups selecting their members and sending out an impersonal congratulatory e-mail, Auburn opts to make the experience a memorable one. Here’s how it goes…\n\nAt the top of the back steps of Cater Hall stands the current executive team, leaders, or captains of an organization. After the votes have been counted, interviews have been held, and try-outs have come and gone, they introduce themselves to the anxious crowd that awaits them below. Hundreds of students rush forward to get as close to the stairs as possible, to make sure they can hear the names. Peeking out of the windows of the Upper Quad Residence Halls are freshmen, eager to watch their first callout experience. Then finally, holding the list of names of those who have been chosen, the executive team has all eyes on them as they read out the list of names, one by one.\n\nMost begin by reading out your hometown. “From Auburn, Alabama” they yell out, and suddenly every prospective member whose hometown is Auburn holds their breath, hoping their name is to follow. As you might imagine, not every name that applied will get called. While this may seem like a massively disappointing experience, there’s one thing that is important to know about those waiting to hear their name; they are never standing alone. Callouts is an experience to share with your friends (and even sometimes your family). It’s common for one candidate to bring a whole crowd of people along to stand in support, hold a hand, or offer a comforting hug if their name is not called. So, whether your name is called or it isn’t, you have a crowd a people there to support and encourage you the whole time.\n\nIf you are lucky enough to hear your name at callouts, you are quickly rushed to a celebratory meeting where you get important information, next steps, and begin to meet those that were chosen alongside you. It’s a night of high-energy, emotions, and excitement as a new chapter and opportunity has been afforded to you.\n\nSome of my fondest memories from my time as a student come from the many nights spent standing on the back lawn of Cater Hall, surrounded by my closest friends, anxiously waiting to hear my name at Callouts. It was in those moments (like the one pictured above), that I experienced the most tangible picture of the Auburn family; I was surrounded by friends that become family, and that meant a community that would support and encourage me no matter what.\n\nIf you have the chance to witness the beloved “Cater Callouts” tradition, be sure to join in. There’s no better feeling than hearing your name (or the name of someone you love) being called from those back steps.\n\nBy Kali Tucker\n\nA DAY\n\nA Day is Auburn University’s annual spring football game! It is a time for fans near and far to come and get a glimpse of what the next season may look like.\n\nA Day ticket prices are typically around $5 for the general public allowing anyone and everyone to come and take part in the fun day.\n\nSticking with tradition on this day our players still enter the stadium through Tiger Walk, the eagle will do its traditional pre-game flight, and Aubie and the cheerleaders are on the sidelines getting the crowd fired up.\n\nAfter the game, the grounds crew works quickly to line the field with tables where just about every sports team on campus will sit to sign autographs and take pictures with fans!\n\nFans are all allowed to bring one item in to get signed and are able to get up close and personal with their favorite team members.\n\nIt really is such a special day for Auburn athletes and fans to come together and experience a fun Auburn tradition together!\n\nBy Jeremy Mack\n\nColleges across the country are full of traditions, and Auburn is no different.\n\nAs you walk from Toomer’s Corner onto campus after grabbing an ice cold lemonade, you’ll pass by Langdon Hall. It’s imperative that you watch your step as you pass by Langdon Hall! On the ground at the front of the building you will find the Auburn Seal.\n\nStep on the seal if you dare! Legend says if you step on the seal you won’t graduate in four years, you won’t find your true love at Auburn, AND you’ll have seven generations of Alabama fans in your family. Those are some pretty harsh consequences for not being careful!\n\nIn the event that you do step on the seal, there is a little hope for you to reverse the curse, though we don’t recommend trying it. The curse can be reversed by jumping in the fountain at the president’s mansion at midnight on the leap day of a leap year. While our president, Dr. Jay Gogue, is friendly and loves being around students, we’re pretty sure he’d prefer not to meet you in the middle of the night in his fountain.\n\nWar Eagle!\n\nAuburn vs. Alabama Rivalry\n\nJawara White\n\nAs a former Auburn University athlete, the Auburn vs Alabama Rivalry is one I will never forget. Growing up in the football spotlight, I was able to experience both sides of the rivalry. Thankfully I decided to always say “War Eagle.” As I made trips to Auburn my junior and senior year of high school, I slowly learned the depth of the rivalry. The rivalry begins the moment you are born and you pick a side. No seriously, you really have to pick a side.\n\nWhat does the Auburn vs Alabama rivalry mean to me? The rivalry means blood, sweat, grit, and tears. It means dedication, hard work and determination. The hard work, dedication and determination begin in the months, weeks, and days leading up to the Iron Bowl. Every practice, weight room session, and film session builds up to the Iron Bowl. It is always the last game of the year and it is always the most important game of the year.\n\nMy favorite Iron Bowl memory? There are WAY too many to choose from but my freshman year is the easiest memory to pick because it ended with a National Championship under our belt. We were playing in Tuscaloosa. It was my first trip as a player to Tuscaloosa and I had no idea what to expect. People can prep you, warn you, and try and help you the best they can, but the experience is truly one that words cannot describe. As we walked into Bryant Denny Stadium in 2010 we only heard one thing: “Take the Money and Run” playing over the loud speakers. I guess it was a form of intimidation. Sadly, for Alabama, it was a form of motivation. We came out slow but responded from a 24 – 0 deficit and ended up beating Alabama 28 – 27. After the game we could not do anything but smile and laugh, our hard work, determination, grit, sweat and tears pushed us above the rest. We had a few days to celebrate before focusing on a National Title and the SEC championship. During those few days I was able to think about my first experience as a player in the Iron Bowl. I realized then the rivalry is deeper than football; it’s a way of life.\n\nWhen you think of autumn, what comes to mind? Cooler weather, falling leaves, pumpkin spice-flavored everything? At universities across the country, fall signals the start of another football season. Each year, Auburn University fans anticipate a winning streak to rival those of the past. Here on the eastern Alabama plains exists a post-game tradition that sets us apart from competitors—the rolling of the Auburn Oaks at Toomer’s Corner.\n\nAfter every Tiger victory, giddy fans flock to Toomer’s Corner. The quaint downtown intersection is anchored by Toomer’s Drugs, a charming pharmacy-turned-lunch counter that has been welcoming students, alumni and community residents for more than a century. As crowds gather, toilet paper streams from the hands of revelers into the trees surrounding the drugstore. Another nearby site, Samford Lawn, also teems with fans hurling toilet paper, draping every limb and branch of the lawn’s mature oaks. The celebration is not always contained to Toomer’s or Samford Lawn alone. When Auburn defeats an opponent in a championship match, elated enthusiasts often take to decorating several blocks of College Street, transforming even more of downtown Auburn into a white-paper wonderland.\n\nAnd what becomes of the paper when the festivities have ended? City of Auburn road crews are hard at work early the next day, returning campus and downtown to working order. (Fun fact: Auburn is the only city in the country with a toilet paper removal budget.)\n\nBut what is it exactly that makes this tradition so special? For Laurel, an undergraduate student majoring in Political Science, it is the camaraderie of the Auburn Family coming together, uniting in celebration. Having grown up in Auburn, she fondly recalls times spent with her family and the community at Toomer’s Corner. Many family members still return to Auburn from far and wide to show their support for the Tigers. Laurel’s Aunt Judi travels from Houston each season to take in a game or two and to join the festivities spilling from the stadium when the home team triumphs. Laurel’s most memorable game and rolling came after the nail-biting “Kick Six” play at the 2013 Iron Bowl, when Auburn narrowly beat then No. 1-ranked Alabama (34–28).\n\nAuburn alumnus Billy, who earned a degree in business in 2015, agrees, noting the energy and excitement it brings to the campus. He first became aware of the tradition during an Auburn campus tour while still in high school. Billy cites the 2013 “A Day” spring scrimmage as his personal favorite post-game roll. The game marked the final roll of the original Auburn Oaks before they were replaced. Billy estimates more than one hundred thousand fans participated that day. He remembers the energy as palpable, almost electric. When asked why the tradition has continued for so long, he points to the fervent passion held by so many fans of the university and its much-lauded athletics programs. Billy affirms that it is the Auburn Family, not the trees themselves, that keeps this rich tradition going strong today.\n\nBoth Billy and Laurel remark that the rolling of the Auburn Oaks at Toomer’s Corner unites Auburn fans across generations. It is not uncommon to see children clad in orange and navy running alongside their grandparents at Toomer’s after a game—young and old alike proudly tossing a roll high into the sky."
