        "text": "There aren’t many scenes like it — the roar of the Top Fuel cars, the sun setting behind the tree-surrounded drag strip.\n\nOn July 19-21, the NHRA Northwest National Drag Racing will take place at Pacific Raceways in Kent.\n\nPacific Raceways is a favorite track for many drivers on the NHRA (National Hot Rod Association) circuit, but for Funny Car driver Ron Capps, the entire Pacific Northwest holds a special place for him.\n\n“Not all tracks are built like this, thank god. It is an oasis … they have done a great job of bringing it (race track) to the standards that we need to go 330 miles an hour, but keeping it old school,” Capps said.\n\nFor the 59-year-old driver, Pacific Raceways was the home of his first professional win back in 1995, when he was driving on the Top Fuel side. Since then, he has won on the Funny Car three times, has been a runner-up five times and has been the top qualifier twice.\n\n“Every time I get here I feel everything rubbing off on me … When I roll into town, I just get that mojo, I call it. I feel like I am going to do well no matter what,” Capps said.\n\n“Coming back here in a funny car driving for the legendary Don ‘The Snake’ Prudhomme and to win and win again in both categories goes back to those special memories,” Capps said\n\nSo far this season, with Capps in the cockpit, he has performed fairly well. He’s sixth in the standings and coming off a runner-up finish in Norwalk on June 27-30. Capps is looking to take a big step heading into the back half of the season.\n\n“This is a key race… This is the one that everyone talks about having their act together when you come to this race,” he said.\n\nLocal support has played a big part in Capps’ career, including a 100-foot advertisement on the side of Muckleshoot Casino. Capps even called his mom to show her.\n\n“I called her and told her I think I made it big time. I am on the side of the hotel and it’s something I am not used to. It has been fun,” Capps said.\n\nAt an event July 17 at the Muckleshoot Casino, Auburn Mayor Nancy Backus joined Pacific Raceways President Jason Fiorito to talk to fans and the media alongside Capps.\n\n“The local cities, the state, county and Muckleshoot Tribe combine to make this a banner event,” Fiorito said.\n\nFiorito announced that the NHRA Northwest Nationals will have a night race for the first time in NHRA history. It was something that Seattle International Raceways did, but now Pacific is bring back night racing on the first day of qualifying (July 19).\n\n“The nitro flames at night are is a spectacle like no other in racing… It is one of the coolest things you can ever see,” Fiorito said.\n\n“Track records, I am sure are going to fall. It is going to be an incredible night. It was due to a lot of hard work. We are very excited about doing that for the first time in a long time,” said Capps.\n\nAs the driver chase the sun on July 19, in the driver’s seat drag racers pull up to 6 Gs of force. Only fighter pilots experience more on a day-to-day basis. At 59, Capps fights through training with an eye over his shoulder for those up-and-coming drivers.\n\n“My motivation is simply the kids coming up. I don’t want to get whooped by ‘em,” said Capps.\n\nStarting last season, Capps took over as the owner of his team and now races for Ron Capps Motorsport. He joins the likes of John Force and Antron Brown as the lone team owners who also get behind the wheel.\n\nRunning a team comes with a lot more responsibility Capps wishes he hit the books a bit more when he was a young kid. “I wish I paid more attention in school… I was always dreaming to be a team owner and never thought it would happen,” Capps said.\n\nThe most difficult thing is separating the business side and the racing side of Capps’ life. “The biggest thing for me is when I get the helmet on to get that business side out of my head. It really made me have more respect for the Force’s and Brown’s.”"
