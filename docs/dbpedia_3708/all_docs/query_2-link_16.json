        "text": "Robbie Robertson, guitarist and songwriter best known for his time with The Band, has passed away.\n\nHe was 80.\n\nAccording to Variety, Robertson died Wednesday in Los Angeles after a long illness.\n\nBorn in Toronto, Robertson formed The Band in his hometown in 1967 along with Rick Danko, Garth Hudson, Richard Manuel and Levon Helm. With Robertson’s death, Hudson (at 86) is now the last surviving original member of The Band.\n\nPreviously known as The Hawks, they were a backing band for Ronnie Hawkins before doing the same for Bob Dylan in the mid-1960s. After leaving Dylan, they changed their name to The Band and released acclaimed records including their 1968 debut “Music from Big Pink,” followed by an eponymous album, “Stage Fright,” “Cahoots” and “Moondog Matinee.”\n\nIn 1978, The Band released “The Last Waltz,” their second live album and final record by the original configuration of the group. The triple album served as a farewell concert to the group, performed at Bill Graham’s Winterland Ballroom on Thanksgiving Day in 1976 and featuring a legendary array of special guests like Bob Dylan, Joni Mitchell, Eric Clapton, Emmylou Harris, Van Morrison, Neil Young, Ringo Starr, Mavis Staples, Muddy Waters and more.\n\nRobertson is credited with writing several of The Band’s most popular songs like “The Weight”, “The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down” and “Up on Cripple Creek.”\n\nRobertson enjoyed a successful solo career with albums like the self-titled “Robbie Robertson” in 1987, 1991′s “Storyville” and 1998′s “Contact from the Underworld of Redboy.”\n\nOscar-winning filmmaker Martin Scorsese directed “The Last Waltz” documentary, beginning a collaborative relationship between him and Robertson that would see songwriter serve as producer and composer on several Scorsese film soundtracks including “Raging Bull,” “The Color of Money,” “Casino,” “The Departed” and “The Wolf of Wall Street.”\n\nRobertson was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Canadian Music Hall of Fame as a member of The Band. Rolling Stone ranked him 59th on their list of the 100 greatest guitarists of all time."
