        "text": "When it is a full band trip, they pack their equipment in an 18-wheeler that leaves ahead of the band. On smaller trips, some- times they will ship tubas and drums to the location.\n\nSome music the band plays is traditionally performed at every game, while new songs are added each year. “We try to make sure there is fun and excitement in the stadium and the arena,” Corey says. At foot- ball games, they play certain selections for offense and others for defense.\n\nDuring timeouts, all of the music is timed down to the second. Corey is in touch with the marketing director about advertisements on the video board. He will look at script sheets to see how long they are, then go to timing sheets to find songs that length. “There is a lot to think about dur- ing a football game,” he says. “I am usually mentally tired at the end.”\n\nAbout 30 band students play at each basketball game. They strive to get the crowd involved and provide unyielding support for the team, as well as distract the other team.\n\nCorey and Ashley have a special connection to Auburn and Opelika and are involved in both communities. Their children, Harper, 11, Hannah, 10, and Lucas, 4, are active in sports and music in the Auburn area. Harper plays tennis and is a member of the Drake Middle School Robotics Team. Hannah attends Pick Elementary and is a junior golfer, participating in US Kids Golf tournaments and Drive, Chip, and Putt events locally. The Spurlin family are members of Trinity Church in Opelika, where Ashley often performs as a violinist.\n\nAs a professor, part of Corey’s job is to complete research and creative projects in his area. He has served as a guest conductor, adjudicator, and/or presenter for honor band events, band festivals, and conferences in 21 different states.\n\nCorey has been asked to direct a national collegiate mass band at the special 80th anniversary of D-Day celebrations in Normandy. He is assembling a large band of college students and college alumni from across the country. They will meet in Washington, D.C. in early June to practice before flying to Paris. This anniversary is especially touching as it will be the last major celebration for aging veterans who were involved in D-Day.\n\n“This will be a momentous ceremony educating college students about the sacrifices veterans made,” says Corey. “Both of my grandfathers fought in World War II. This is an opportunity for me to combine my profession with my past to honor my grandfathers and their involvement in the war. I feel honored to be asked and want to do something special for those veterans still living.\n\n“I also feel honored to have my position at Auburn,” adds Corey. “One thing we try to teach our students is when go somewhere, leave it better than you found it. For me, I inherited a great band. The band was good when I came here, so I have simply strived to make it even better.\n\n“I have always tried to have a positive impact on the students that I teach and not just marching and playing, but in life skills and helping them professionally in different ways.” Twelve of Corey’s former students have held band director positions at other colleges since graduation.\n\nUnder his direction, four performances by the Auburn University Marching Band have been selected for recognition and viewing at national and regional con- ferences of the College Band Directors National Association.\n\nHe has written a chapter for the popular marching band textbook The System, and he is published in five volumes of Teaching Music Through Performance in Band and the National Band Association Journal.\n\n“In 17 years we have created a lot of mem- ories,” Corey says. “The bands have had a lot of success that we are proud of, and I credit the students with that. I have been blessed to have really good students and good student leaders over the years. They are passionate about the band and serving as great ambassadors for Auburn. I feel like our students have represented the univer- sity and community really well. I am really proud of that.”"
