Tim is a world-class Drag Racing artist. His work is admired and displayed by the greatest names in our sport, and I’m looking forward to featuring him on the September 27th show!\n\nI am open to suggestions for Racer of Week, folks. Feel free to message me here on Facebook if you have a racer in mind for this feature.\n\nNO COST, PERIOD, and it’s NOT an interview. All you get is worldwide ink. The criteria are simple and fun to produce, and you and your hot rod, plus the text, graphic, and podcast file of your feature will be online forever.\n\nNow into Racer of the Week’s 9th year, I’m having a great time featuring our Drag Racers from all over the world. I’m looking forward to our future together!\n\nHope you can drop in to watch, listen and chat!\n\nThe podcast will be live on the Drag Racing List Facebook Page. It is saved on the page’s Videos section for future viewing. I will provide all links.\n\nTim Frederick’s feature is scheduled to air live in “JB’s Take” around 8:45 PM US Eastern.\n\nLove to All, JB"
