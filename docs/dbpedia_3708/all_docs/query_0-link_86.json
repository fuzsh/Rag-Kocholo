The band subsequently moved to Connecticut and released If I Knew Now What I Knew Then under their present moniker. The name ‘Hot Rod Circuit’ comes from a Mr. Burns quote on the TV show, The Simpsons. “The year is 1965, and you and I are undercover detectives on the hot rod circuit.”\n\nHot Rod Circuit has toured with The Get Up Kids, The Jazz June, and At the Drive-In. After nearly ten years together, the band decided to go their separate ways shortly after the release of their fifth full-length album, The Underground is a Dying Breed, in 2007. Singer Andy Jackson is now fronting the similar outfit Death in the Park, who released their debut EP in 2009.\n\n...\n\nRead More About Hot Rod Circuit Biography...\n\nSend Hot Rod Circuit ringtones to your cell"
