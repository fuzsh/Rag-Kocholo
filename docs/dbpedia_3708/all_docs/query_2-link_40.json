        "text": "Unapologetically Alabama. There’s a new force making major waves in country music. Natives of Mobile Alabama, Gary Stanton and Charlie Muncaster came together to form Muscadine Bloodline in early 2016. With three single releases under their belt and a schedule full of shows spanning from coast to coast, they’ve hit the ground running from day 1. Nashville took notice the first time these two stepped on the stage and it’s no surprise the rest of the music world is quickly catching on. Charlie’s [contemporary] vocals complimented by Gary’s harmonies and masterful guitar licks, MB is a powerfully refreshing mix of talent, passion and unfiltered authenticity. Infamously undaunted by the big stage, their sound intertwines the brash irreverence of early southern rockers with the seductive quality of 90s country love songs. Captivating hooks heard in songs like “Porch Swing Angel” and the aggressively anthemic “Shut Your Mouth” stand as a testament to MB’s wide ranging music-making capability. Every song and every show is a moving experience but at the same time, unmistakably Muscadine Bloodline.\n\nCharlie Muncaster\n\nCharlie Muncaster is a Mobile, Alabama native who first discovered his soulful voice when he was young. He began performing in choirs at 12 years old, where he gained his passion for music. Charlie received his first guitar at 14 years old and began performing as a solo musician in his early teens. During his choir career, Charlie performed in the Alabama All-State Choir from seventh to twelfth grade. He continued his musical pursuits after he relocated to Auburn, Alabama. While in Auburn, he started “The Charlie Muncaster Band” and also continued performing as a solo act at watering holes across Alabama, Georgia, and Mississippi. During his solo career, he released his first EP titled “Alabama Summer Night” in June, 2015. His talent has earned him opening spots for acts such as: Brad Paisley, The Cadillac Three, Cole Swindell, Corey Smith, Rhett Atkins, The Band Perry, Jana Kramer, and Blackberry Smoke. Charlie relocated to Nashville in October of 2015, and has since focused on his duo career with Gary Stanton, as Muscadine Bloodline.\n\nGary Stanton\n\nGary Stanton was born and raised in Mobile, AL, where he picked up a guitar for the first time at 8 years old. Gary got his feet wet by singing and playing in various church groups, where he became comfortable on the stage. From fronting a hard rock band to being an aspiring rapper, Gary became versatile with different genres of music. It wasn’t until his late teens that Gary fell in love with country music. In the Fall of 2011, Gary moved to Hattiesburg, Mississippi to attend the University of Southern Mississippi, where he majored in Entertainment Industry Management. Gary had always planned to move to Nashville to work in the Music Industry, but it wasn’t until he wrote a song that went viral on Facebook, he knew that he wanted to be a songwriter. In the Spring of 2013, Stanton released his debut EP titled “The American Dream”, and shortly after he formed an original outfit called “Somethin’ Sweet”. The band started out playing small local bars, Fraternity gigs, and various markets in Mississippi. During his “Somethin’ Sweet” career, Gary shared the stage with artists such as: Chris Knight, Bucky Covington, Joe Diffie, Corey Smith, Keith Anderson, American Aquarium, Kris Allen, and Benjy Davis. After graduating, Gary made the move to “Music City”, where he is now trying to make his dream a reality with Charlie Muncaster, as Muscadine Bloodline."
