        "text": "More of Canada’s greatest for drag racing are inducted at CDRHF gala event…\n\nFor the fifth straight year, the Canadian Drag Racing Hall of Fame (CDRHF) recognized the significant contributions of a select group of Canadians considered by their peers to be legends in the world of competitive drag racing.\n\nAmong the 16 Canadian nominees from across Canada and the U.S. inducted this year are four world champions, and—for the first time since the CDRHF was founded—father and son nominees. To date, 116 Canadians have been inducted into the Canadian Drag Racing Hall of Fame, 15 of them posthumously.\n\n“As in previous years, each of the individuals nominated has had considerable input into the sport of drag racing. Their influence is felt to this day and it is thanks in part to their impressive legacy that the sport enjoys the popularity it does,” says John Scotti, founder of the Canadian Drag Racing Hall of Fame. “It is indeed an honour to pay tribute to their outstanding accomplishments as we welcome these new legends into the Hall of Fame.”\n\nThe induction ceremony was held November 16, during the Canadian Drag Racing Hall of Fame’s Fifth Annual Induction Gala, held at the Sheraton Laval Hotel Convention Centre in Laval, Quebec. About 130 drag racing champions, drivers, crew chiefs, engine and chassis builders, mechanics, track owners, announcers, and graphic designers from across Canada and the United States were in attendance.\n\nAll inductees received the custom-tailored CDRHF blue blazer and an engraved custom-designed CDRHF ring. As is tradition, this year’s inductees were invited to sign the organization’s official Book of Honour, adding their signature alongside those of fellow inductees from previous years.\n\nTo be nominated, candidates must reside in or be an expatriate of Canada, have actively been engaged at the top level of their categories for more than 25 years and must have made a tangible or considerable contribution to the sport. Some categories may require that candidates have established a national record as an individual or as a member of a team (National Hot Rod Association, International Hot Rod Association, or American Hot Rod Association national record or national event win). Inductees may also come from other areas of the sport, such as photography and track operations.\n\nCanadian Drag Racing Hall of Fame — 2019 Inductees\n\nTom Craig (hometown: Sarnia, Ont.), driver / mechanic: 1971 U.S. Nationals Class Winner; 1997 National Muscle Car Association Race Winner (twice) and class record holder; 1998-1999 National Street Car Association World Champion (twice); 1998-1999 Series Champion (twice); CANAM Stock/Super Stock race winner; Ontario Street Car Association race winner.\n\nHarry Hibbs (hometown: Barrie, Ont.), builder, driver, owner: competed on the International Hot Rod Association (IHRA) circuit; competed on the Pro Comp circuit.\n\nJoe Van Overbeek (West Lorne, Ont.), builder / mechanic: established Joe Van Overbeek Race Car Bodies in 1994, the first Canadian producer of carbon fiber race car bodies and related items.
