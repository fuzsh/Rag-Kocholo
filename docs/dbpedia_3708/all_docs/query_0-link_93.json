        "text": "Editor's note: Alabamians will go to the polls Tuesday to decide a number of key primary races. While the Republican presidential race has garnered significant attention, a handful of local races also will dot voters’ ballots. There are no contested races on the Democratic side, but Republican ballots will feature several, including Lee County Probate Judge, Lee County District Judge and the District 1 seat on the Lee County Commission. These candidates state their cases in the following questions and answers, which are unedited.\n\nAge\n\n59\n\nResidence\n\nAuburn\n\nMarital status\n\nWife, Jennie, Pharmacist at CVS’\n\nChildren\n\nBen 13, Sarah 9, students at Drake Middle School and Cary Woods Elementary; son Stewart, 31 (wife, Brandi); grandchildren: Hailey, 7, and Peyton, 3.\n\nEducation\n\nAuburn High School; Auburn University – BA in criminal justice; Jones School of Law, juris doctorate.\n\nProfessional experience\n\nI have tried cases in all levels of the courts (municipal, district, circuit, domestic and juvenile, jury and non-jury). I have skillfully practiced law before 36 courts across Alabama over the past nine years. I have handled domestic, civil, traffic, misdemeanor and felony cases. I have taught at Auburn University as an adjunct instructor of criminology for six years. I spent 25 years in law enforcement (retired, Auburn Police Department). As an investigator, I was responsible for presenting cases to Lee County grand juries for indictment. I was involved in cases involving homicides in Chicago, New York and South Florida. As a narcotics supervisor, I was involved in the prosecutors of drug traffickers, in state and federal courts, and the seizure and forfeiture of drug assets in state and federal courts.\n\nFavorite law/courtroom-related movie\n\nPerry Mason series\n\nFavorite historical figure in jurisprudence and why\n\nJustice Felix Frankfurter. He was a strong advocate of the judicial theory known as judicial restraint. This theory encourages the limit of the exercise of powers, that laws should be upheld, unless obviously unconstitutional.\n\nFavorite book\n\nKilling Lincoln\n\nWhy I am the best person for the job\n\nI have more experience working with people, practicing law here for nine years, teaching at Auburn University for six years (adjunct instructor), and serving 25 years in law enforcement. My vast experience has included handling cases in all levels of court. My legal background, strong ethical character, temperament and ability to lead with dignity and responsibility will serve our people well.\n\nProblems facing courts\n\nLimited resources and scheduling issues. The clerk’s office is the hardest hit during our economic times. I would work with our local delegations concerning court costs, fees. I recommend that the district court implement a first appearance docket, this measure would save county tax dollars that is currently paid for officers’ overtime. In addition, this docket would save time for court clerk personnel, reducing the unnecessary subpoenas.\n\nHow I would handle the courts’ economic crisis\n\nMany businesses have been hard hit during our economic times. The courts would have to do the same with our friends and neighbors, do more with less.\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\n* I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy."
