        "text": "There’s a difference between a “Southern rock” band and a Southern [pause] rock band. The first connotes a sound and style. Think Lynyrd Skynyrd or .38 Special. The second simply connotes a place of origin or practice.\n\nThe Drive-By Truckers, formed in 1996 in Athens, Georgia by songwriters Patterson Hood and Mike Cooley (not long after a brief mutual stay in Memphis), have always been the latter. The band’s relationship to so-called “Southern rock” has been complicated. They played with the notion, at a critical distance, on their quasi-Skynyrd-inspired 2001 breakout album “Southern Rock Opera.” After that, they restored the stylistic pause between “Southern” and “rock,” but plumbed the history, folklore, and vernacular of their home region with an unprecedented depth for a guitar-bass-drums medium.\n\nThat sometimes meant writing about Sam Phillips or Buford Pusser, or creating small town portraits of such places as Zip City, Alabama or Pulaski, Tennessee. But sometimes it was more subtle. You can write about, as Hood once did, “the duality of the Southern thing” or you can, as Hood also once did, open a song with something like this: “Something about that wrinkle in your forehead tells me there’s a fit about to get thrown.”\n\nREAD MORE\n\n► Beale Street Music Festival offers a balanced mix of acts\n\n► Beale Street Music Fest: When all the bands are playing\n\nThe group’s most recent album, from 2016, is called “American Band,” and its pointed title is a reflection of Hood’s move to the Pacific Northwest and Portland. It also hints at the band’s rejection of the limits of a purely regional identity, with its songwriting becoming more broadly political than ever before -- taking in an Oregon school shooting, a modern National Rifle Association backstory, and the killings of Trayvon Martin and Michael Brown.\n\nConsider the counter-intuitive, though. Resolved: Patterson Hood had to leave the South to write his greatest Southern song.\n\n“Ever South” is the eighth of 11 tracks on “American Band,” among the last songs written for the record. It encompasses 10 verses across nearly six minutes, with no chorus or bridge, only a title refrain that circles back irregularly.\n\nIt follows an arc from a vision of Hood’s Scotch-Irish immigrant ancestors (“We packed our few belongings and we moved across the ocean”) to Hood himself, finally captured in the song’s present moment (“Let this blue-eyed Southern devil take you out upon the prowl’). The song moves forward but shifts vantage points between the journey of a people and of the person singing.\n\n“I spent 30 years in my hometown [Muscle Shoals, Alabama] and 21 years in Athens, Georgia, a few months in Memphis and a couple of years in Auburn, Alabama,” says Hood. “But basically my whole life has been in two small towns. I wanted to live in a city and I didn’t want to move to Atlanta. I can’t fathom living in Atlanta. Hell, the roads catch on fire there. I wanted to live in a blue state and not be hassled about my health insurance as much. Our health insurance went down by about half when we moved out here. It’s still ridiculous, but it’s better.\n\n“I was at the age in my life where I needed a big change, and I didn’t want it to be a mid-life crisis. Moving the family across the country seemed like a better option.”\n\n“Ever South” was written with Hood’s family “in the throes of homesickness,” about six months after the move, which is alluded to in the song:\n\n“So we aimed our sights westward like so many did before\n\nExpanding our horizons to some distant shore\n\nWhere everyone takes notice of the drawl that leaves our mouth\n\nSo that no matter where we are we’re ever South”\n\nThat last is a reminder that “Southern” isn’t something you have a choice about.\n\n“Yeah, but in a positive way,” Hood notes. “I’m proud of my Tennessee Valley twang. I love hearing a good Southern accent. I am a little bit of an exotic animal out here, and that’s OK.”\n\nThe song is part celebration of a missed home, but equal part (and then some) rueful consideration of the region’s living history, from the Lost Cause (“bash our heads against the future ever South”) to its lingering attitudes (“Despite our best intentions, it pains me to report/We keep swinging for the fences, coming up a little short”).\n\n“All of that figured into the beginning of the song, and then it kind of morphed from there,” says Hood of the family move west. “It tied in with the immigrant thing and the fear of the other, which is a recurring thing throughout the record. It’s the song that tied the loose ends of what else we were writing together.”\n\nIn addition to Hood’s “What It Means,” about the Martin and Brown shootings and others like them, this included twin songs (Hood’s “Darkened Flags on the Cusp of Dawn” and Cooley’s merciless “Surrender Under Protest”) inspired by the church shootings in Charleston, South Carolina.\n\nTwo years after the move, Hood says he’s happy in Portland, but that living outside the South for the first time (other than touring) has changed his sense of regional identity.\n\n“It’s made me love the South more because I have more of a filter now,” Hood said. “The South is somewhere I go back to, to see people I love or to play shows, as opposed to the day-to-day grind of seeing Atlanta engulf Athens or the latest idiocy from the Georgia legislature. Nothing is better than a massive life change in terms of really shaking things up and songs coming out. I could never have written ‘Ever South’ if I hadn’t moved. It’s probably my favorite song I’ve written in a long time. I’m real proud of that one.”\n\nDrive By-Truckers\n\nWhere: Beale Street Music Festival"
