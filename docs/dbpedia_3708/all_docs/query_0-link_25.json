We have already reached a quarter-century since the release of that 1st album, “Amplifier Worship”. Boris has been in constant pursuit of their own ideal “heavy” since their formation in 1992. From the outset they became like a chimera, evolving at a rapid pace, establishing a unique style with extreme downtuning and megavolume. Their broad sense of “Heavy Rock” swelled grotesquely, as it engulfed powerviolence, ambient and drone, with a trance component of krautrock and so on.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nNo More Sound, Sad Park’s third full-length, begins with an ending. More specifically, with its own ending. Because the short, just-over-a-minute-long “No More Songs” is kind of a stripped-down reprise of the title track that closes this record. In one way, it means this album—the band’s first for Pure Noise—travels back in time over its 38 or so minutes, but in another it’s also travelling forwards. Because while “No More Sound” is a more fleshed-out version of “No More Songs”, it also contains melodic and lyrical throwbacks to the eleven songs that sit between them. Perhaps more importantly, as everything comes full circle on the record, it offers something that the opener doesn’t.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nThe Warning draw strength and power from a lifetime of sisterhood and music. The Mexico-born sister trio — Daniela \"Dany\" [guitar, lead vocals, piano], Paulina \"Pau\" [drums, vocals, piano], and Alejandra \"Ale\" Villarreal [bass, piano, backing vocals] — have logged thousands of miles on the road, generated hundreds of millions of streams, and left countless fans in awe. All of this tireless work and dedication has shaped and sharpened their sound with knifepoint precision, arming alternative anthems with universally catchy hooks and an uncompromising hard rock kick. The girls have devoted themselves to a shared dream since their childhood in Monterrey, Mexico. They initially made waves with a string of independent releases, paving the way for their acclaimed 2022 full-length offering ERROR. Between performing alongside Muse, Foo Fighters, Guns N' Roses, Royal Blood, The Pretty Reckless, and Three Days Grace, the band ignited MTV's Extended Play Stage at the 2023 MTV VMAs. Representative of their cultural impact, Pepsi even notably chose them as the face of Pepsi Black in Mexico. Moreover, they emerged as the rare force who could comfortably appear in features by Vanity Fair, People, Cosmopolitan, and Glamour as well as on Metallica's star-studded Blacklist compilation — placing their cover of \"Enter Sandman\" [with Alessia Cara] shoulder-to-shoulder with contributions from Ghost, St. Vincent, Chris Stapleton, IDLES and Weezer. Now, The Warning embrace their destiny on their 2024 full-length album, Keep Me Fed [LAVA/Republic Records] out on June 28th. The album was introduced by \"MORE,\" \"S!CK\" \"Hell You Call A Dream,\" \"Qué Más Quieres,\" and \"Automatic Sun.\"\n\nREAD MORE\n\nMiss May I playing the album Apologies are for the Weak in full!
