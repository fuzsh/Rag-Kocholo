        "text": "Doomsday HOT ROD road trips seem to always have an element of adventure in them and more than likely something surprising and spontaneous. Those, along with the many miles travelled in your favourite ride are the planks of which fond memories are made. Even roadside breakdowns become ideal fodder for bench racing and even bragging rights! I’ve been fortunate to embark on more than a few over the years and can vividly recall one such trip way back in 1976 when ex-pat Kiwi Mike Peck and I travelled from LA to Elko, Nevada in his ’68 Camaro SS complete with big block 396 and a set of Cragars. Oh yeah, there’s a few tales to be told but that epic trip has nothing to do with doomsday. It was 2015 and a…\n\nRemembering Stroppy READING Craig’s very amusing article about Stroppy’s collection brought back memories. Some thirty-five-plus years ago I found a Mk1 Zephyr convertible in a very bad way in a paddock in Ashburton. Among the bits missing was a door handle which was unique to the convertibles. Dave Aitken put me on to Rod Mitchell and on asking if he’d have the part, the answer was “I think there are some doors out there somewhere but you’ll have to search. “Well there was certainly no system of where stuff was, it was everywhere and I spent six hours searching under and over all kinds of stuff, some of which would be worth a fortune now. I found five doors and luckily one had a handle. Rod and I haggled a bit…\n\n• Blue Us Away Again SPOTTED this ‘23 T-bucket at the recent USA Day at Woodend, owned by host club (American Classic Car Club) members Colin and Sharyn Constable. It took a while to remember where I’d seen it before; the cover of November 1999 NZHRM (“Blue us away”), when built and owned by Graham and Carol Oliver. Still a nice little package with 327 Chevy, ‘glide, Chevy rear, tube front, S/S Cragar wheels and a gennie T grille surround. The pale blue and polished chrome really works well. From John Eva. • Nitro Shootout is on! NITRO action explodes into life at Meremere Dragway on February 25th when NZ takes on Australia in Top Fuel. The Mount Shop Nitro Shootout Top Fuel Trans-Tasman Challenge is a best of three showdown between NZ record…\n\n• Real steel INVERCARGILLITE Graham White landed this cool deuce tudor after buying it at auction in last year’s Hot August Nights event held in Reno, Nevada. It’s an all-steel solid nineties-style car underpinned with a 327 smallblock V8, Turbo 350 and ‘vette IRS. Graham fitted the American Racing wheels and says it drives really well. It’s for sale so if it’s a bit of you call 027 227 2141. • Heartbeat of America THEY say that if you own a Chevy pickup you have a business! They’re solid, reliable and 90 percent of them are still on the road. Chuck located this gem and decided he had to own it. The patina paint says it all: it’s a sunburnt California virgin which would make an excellent parts chaser or street machine. It’s…\n\nABOUT five or six years ago Will located the rotten remains of a 1937 Ford pickup cab and a few scattered parts in a farmer’s dump, down a gully in Kurow. For those who don’t know Will, not only is he an excellent upholsterer (see Hot Rod shops, Classic & Custom Auto Interiors) but he has an incredible knack for gathering parts nobody else wants or would touch and turns them into total show pieces. Many of you “will” remember his amazing 1934 Ford coupe featured in NZHRM’s September 2009 issue. That car arrived as a pile of parts on a five-foot square pallet and basically beyond description! The truck cab was certainly rough enough, rotten and required patch panels all round. Unfortunately the first round was not up to Will’s…\n\nFOR most Kiwis they first heard of Grant Downing in the mid 2000s, when he and his rag-tag volunteer Kiwi crew started showing up at a few NHRA events in the States with a nitro Funny Car built by Grant. But when they started qualifying in the middle of the pack and then in the field for Sunday, they commanded some respect. Little did most know that Grant had Paralax Racecars going for a few years before that, doing all kinds of chassis work, cages and back-halfs etc. Eventually he closed the shop when he was hired on as full-time chassis builder for the Worsham Racing CSK team. Grant and wife Lynne returned to NZ and have set up shop on the outskirts of Hastings in an immaculate 280 sq metre…"
