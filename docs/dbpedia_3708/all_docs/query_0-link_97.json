        "text": "As he launched into opening number \"Hey, Tonight,\" a 1970 single by Fogerty's former band Creedence Clearwater Revival, a series of brash-lighting, smoke and spark pyrotechnics more reminiscent of mid-80s heavy-metal was triggered as Fogerty strummed his gold-top Gibson and sang from atop a riser.\n\nI wouldn't have been surprised to see Motley Crue or Ratt emerge from the din.\n\nBut as overtly arena-rock as the Fogerty concert's production was, the bluesy, soulful characteristic that drew people to his music in the first place remained at the center of the flash.\n\nAfter \"Hey, Tonight,\" Fogerty – flannel-clad and amazingly fit for someone knocking on 70 – announced what many fans already knew: The evening would feature the 1969 Creedence LP \"Bayou Country.\"\n\nAnd the reading of that album got off to a raucous start with that disc's opening track, the murky-water grooving \"Born on the Bayou.\" Fogerty delivered his well-intact South-scorching howl surrounded by a thick fog effect onstage. (Another helping of arena-rock panache.)\n\nHis voice was strong all night at his two-hour-plus Oct. 23 Huntsville show, and after the first three numbers, in which there were just a few missed high notes, he was really on.\n\nInterestingly, Fogerty and his professional four-piece band performed much of the \"Bayou Country\" material out of sequence. For instance, the cover of Little Richard's holler-fest \"Good Golly Miss Molly\" was bumped ahead of \"Graveyard Train,\" a spooky, juju-doused slow-blues that exuded the deepest vibe of any song performed during the show.\n\nAs a live performer, Fogerty is definitely focused more on his Chitlin Circuit worthy vocals and guitar playing than shaking his rump. He did occasionally point high into the air with his right hand for emphasis at the end of a phrase or flash a California grin, and has a solid collection of guitar-faces at his disposal.\n\nThe stage was moved up about a third of the way on the floor, basically altering Propst Arena to more of a theatre-type capacity, with about a third of the seats blocked off. The floor and lower sections were pretty full with fans, with a few patches of empty seats in the upper section.\n\n(The aforementioned puzzlement at why Fogerty wasn't playing the concert hall isn't a slight. Crosby, Stills & Nash, another legendary act from CCR's era, blew the roof off that room in February.)\n\nHistory primarily remembers Fogerty as a fine, gut-bucket singer and prolific writer of CCR hits. But he's also a fiery, blues-rock guitarist. His most memorable soloing is concise, vibrant and hummable. But at this Huntsville show Fogerty played too many long, bar-jam rides. I swear I heard the same exact solo about five times, although there were definitely some molten tones and Hendrix-y string bends in there.\n\nThat said, mad props to Fogerty for the guitar-solo piece - complete with whammy-bar dive-bombs and Van Halen-style finger-tapping (!) - that preceded \"Keep On Chooglin,\" the road-song \"Bayou Country\" closing track, which Fogerty and his solo band updated with a boogie-metal sheen. Fogerty whipped out a harmonica during \"Chooglin,\" and blew a juke-joint worthy solo, as drummer Kenny Aronoff, a bald, athletic musician whose resume includes work with everyone from John Mellencamp to Smashing Pumpkins, pounded his kit. Flames of pyro towards the end of this number livened up the VBC crowd, which up to that point was mostly sedate and more reminiscent of an AARP meeting than a rock audience.\n\nThe show – and the crowd – continued to pick up steam with the funky, moaning CCR track \"Green River\" as gray-haired fans shook it like it was still the Age of Aquarius.\n\nFogerty is his own man as a performer. Between some of the tunes, there were prolonged moments of onstage darkness and semi-awkward silence, save for hoots and hollers from the audience, as Fogerty switched between an impressive array of classic and pointy-modern guitars. At one point in his career, he went 11 years between solo albums, so what's the big deal about a couple minutes until the next number, right?\n\nHe did some great song introductions though. Fogerty led into the beautiful, melancholic 1970 CCR smash \"Who'll Stop the Rain\" by spinning a funny, cool story about how he wrote the song after playing Woodstock, going on at 2:30 a.m. at that legendary 1969 hippie-music festival instead of a planned 9:30 p.m., after the Grateful Dead's put \"half a million people to sleep.\"\n\nLater, before his second precipitation-themed ballad of the evening (\"Have You Ever Seen the Rain?\"), Fogerty explained how he'd written the song as CCR was breaking-up, but it now was a tune that brought his daughter to mind. (He extended the microphone to the audience for a sing-a-long at several intervals, with resounding results).\n\nA later, quasi-rant against smartphones and technology was less effective.\n\nSpeaking of intros, hyper-active, vest-wearing keyboard player Bob Malone delivered a nifty, wafting accordion solo before the downhome Creedence nugget \"Lookin' Out My Back Door,\" which benefited from a cool, dragonfly-skitter guitar solo from Fogerty.\n\n\"Mystic Highway,\" one of two new cuts on Fogerty's recent, critically lauded, mostly remakes-duets album \"Wrote a Song for Everyone,\" was a twangy delight. And better than 98 percent of what you hear on modern-country radio.\n\nThe Creedence deep-track \"Ramble Tamble\" featured slashing riffs, icy arpeggios, and a sophisticated math-guitar solo.\n\nThe playful, 1985 solo anthem \"Centerfield,\" which Fogerty performed on a baseball bat shaped guitar, probably brought an extra-wide grin any hardball fans in the VBC crowd, since it was opening night of the 2013 World Series in Boston. (Added bonus: Fogerty's merch table was selling $25 \"Centerfield\" logo emblazoned baseballs. A hundred bucks gets you an autographed one.)\n\nAnother solo hit, \"Old Man Down the Road,\" summoned the marshy atmosphere of CCR's best, but a little more sinister perhaps.\n\nThe caustic 1969 political cut \"Fortunate Son\" was goosed with distorted-guitar and Fogerty actually threw up the devil-horns hand gesture, long associated with heavy-metal acts, during the tune's conclusion. Clearly, this is an artist who while obviously determined to deliver bang to his audience, doesn't take himself too seriously: During a crowd-lathering encore of \"Bad Moon Rising\" – how many songs sound both foreboding and jubilant? – Fogerty smiled as he slipped in the misquote-joke line \"There's a bathroom on the right\" (as he pointed to the right) instead of \"There's a bad moon on the rise\" during one of the choruses.\n\nGospel-rocker \"Proud Mary\" was the show's final encore. Like many of Fogerty's CCR apogee works, the song sounds like it's older than time itself – and in a great way.\n\nIn the 1998 stoner comedy film \"The Big Lebowski,\" the hirsute protagonist known as \"The Dude\" makes it no secret he's a Creedence fan. At his Huntsville concert Fogerty, while clearly proud of his solo work, made it no secret he's a CCR fan, too.\n\nYes, this dude also abides."
