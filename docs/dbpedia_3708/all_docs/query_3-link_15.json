        "text": "Aubie the Tiger\n\nAubie, Auburn’s tiger mascot, is a spirit leader and goodwill ambassador for Auburn University. A popular character among Auburn fans and one of the most animated mascots in the country, Aubie is the living spirit of Auburn. His striking good looks, personal appeal, and daring antics combine to make a character that fans cannot ignore. It is often said women love him, children adore him, and men want to be him.\n\nAubie has won eleven national championships — more than any other mascot in the United States. Aubie was named the 2014 Capital One Mascot of the Year and was among the first three college mascots inducted into the Mascot Hall of Fame in 2006.\n\nAubie began as a cartoon character on the Auburn vs. Hardin-Simmons football program cover on October 3, 1959. Birmingham Post-Herald Artist Phil Neel created the cartoon tiger that would adorn Auburn football program covers for 18 years.\n\nHey Day\n\nHey Day is one of the most beloved Auburn traditions, dating back to 1947.\n\nAfter WWII ended, Auburn students who served in the war felt unseen and unheard as they transitioned back to campus life. In response, Auburn University’s student body and members of the Student Government Association pushed for a day that would unite the Auburn Family and promote a friendly atmosphere.\n\nEach year, Auburn students carry on the Hey Day tradition. Name tags are distributed across campus, making it easy to greet and connect with students, faculty, staff, and the community. Hey Day is one of Auburn’s longest-standing and most cherished traditions.\n\nWar Eagle Road\n\nIf you drive to Auburn University’s campus, you’ll discover a unique musical road that delights drivers and passengers — especially if they’re Tiger fans.\n\nDrivers traveling down War Eagle Road, a stretch of South Donahue Drive headed toward Samford Avenue, will hear the first seven War Eagle Fight Song notes. Rumble strips are typically placed at the edge of a road to alert drivers and, in most cases, are anything but pleasant to the ear — but with some reverse engineering, these vibrations can create distinctive frequencies that simulate musical notes.\n\nWar Eagle Road is the third musical road in the United States and the first on a college campus. The project was a gift to the Auburn Family from Tim Arnold, who graduated from Auburn with an industrial engineering degree in 1994.\n\nLoveliest Village\n\nAuburn is the proud home of Auburn University and the Robert Trent Jones Golf Trail, one of the world's finest. It's the coolest college town in the South, according to us, and one of the top 10 cities in the U.S. for small businesses, according to Forbes. Centrally located near Atlanta, Birmingham, and Montgomery, Auburn is easy to get to and easy to love.\n\nWar Eagle Road\n\nIf you drive to Auburn University’s campus, you’ll discover a unique musical road that delights drivers and passengers — especially if they’re Tiger fans.\n\nDrivers traveling down War Eagle Road, a stretch of South Donahue Drive headed toward Samford Avenue, will hear the first seven War Eagle Fight Song notes.

The project was a gift to the Auburn Family from Tim Arnold, who graduated from Auburn with an industrial engineering degree in 1994.\n\nFight Song\n\nAuburn’s fight song, “War Eagle,” was introduced at the beginning of the 1955 football season and has since been the university’s official fight song. The Auburn University Marching Band plays the fight song often during march down, pep rallies, athletics events, and more. “War Eagle” also rings from the Samford Hall clock tower daily at noon.\n\n“War Eagle, fly down the field,\n\nEver to conquer, never to yield.\n\nWar Eagle, fearless and true.\n\nFight on you orange and blue.\n\nGo! Go! Go!\n\nOn to vict’ry, strike up the band.\n\nGive ‘em hell, give ‘em hell,\n\nStand up and yell, hey!\n\nWar Eagle, win for Auburn,\n\nPower of Dixieland!”\n\nAlma Mater\n\nSinging Auburn’s Alma Mater is a favorite campus tradition, not just because of the words but also the actions. Students attending Camp War Eagle will participate in a pep rally on the first night and learn how to sing the Alma Mater. Students learn the cherished Auburn tradition of standing and swaying to the music, arms linked when singing the Alma Mater.\n\nOn the rolling plains of Dixie ‘neath the sun-kissed sky,\n\nProudly stands our Alma Mater, banners high.\n\nTo thy name we’ll sing the praise, from hearts that love so true,\n\nAnd pledge to thee our loyalty the ages through.\n\nWe hail thee, Auburn, and we vow to work for thy just fame,\n\nAnd hold in memory as we do now thy cherished name.\n\nComposed by Bill Wood in 1942, with word revision in 1960."
