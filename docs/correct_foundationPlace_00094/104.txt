Since its inception, the Foundation has been committed to practicing sound fiscal management, organizational efficiency and program integrity. Tunnel to Towers keeps fundraising and administrative costs at a minimum, with only a small percentage of funds allocated to overhead expenses. For the past several years, the Foundation’s program service percentage on average was 95% – 95 cents out of every dollar goes directly to our programs and services. Program service ratio is a key barometer used to measure operating effectiveness. The organization’s Chairman and CEO, Frank Siller, is an uncompensated volunteer. For seven years running, the Foundation has achieved the highest rating, four stars from Charity Navigator, the nation’s largest and most-utilized evaluator of charities.
