Welcome to the Patient Financial Navigator Foundation, Inc- A community outreach program PFNF Education 2017

The PFNF Advisory Board is committed to attacking and transforming the hassle factor ---thru education & outreach. • Day Egusquiza, Founder and President • Daryl Wert, Vice President • Jenyfer Stokes, Director • Jayme Ketterling, Secretary • Jodyi Wren, Director • Jeremy Egusquiza, Director • Karla Carter, Director • Rosemary Fornshell, Ad-hoc • Special thanks to Kody/Facebook and Jeremy/Webpage • Special thanks to the volunteers • +CSI/strategic partner – location • +St Luke’s /strategic partner – Navigator Resource Library Vision for healthcare= Integration /Innovation Collaboration = reducing anxiety thru education PFNF Education 2017

A Community Outreach Program • The Patient Financial Navigator Foundation, Inc with its home base in Twin Falls, Idaho, is thrilled to present free educational programs for patients to attack the hassle factor in healthcare. Day Egusquiza, President, with over 37 years’ experience in healthcare including 20 years at an Idaho hospital, will guide the Patient Financial Navigator Foundation which will create a pathway for patients with multiple educational efforts – thru employers, payers, boot camps– while developing networks and a Resource Library to help navigate thru the maze called healthcare. Transforming healthcare one patient at a time. An advocate for all! • NO cost to the Employer for any employer programs. • NO cost to the community for any community programs. • NO cost to the community for the Boot camps • NO cost to the community for the Navigator Resource Library

Why create the Patient Financial Navigator Community Outreach Program No one really understands their healthcare insurance until they need it. No one realizes the ‘next steps’ once the medical incident has occurred/been ordered. When a family is in a healthcare crisis, their life is disrupted, scared and vulnerable - coordination/communication is required to reduce the hassle factor. PFNF Education 2017

The Patient Challenges with HealthCare • No one ‘asks’ to come to a hospital. • Patient’s lives are impacted – they are scared, they feel out of control, they are lost with the overwhelming factors of cost/unknown, multiple providers, and continuing frustration with ‘who knows all of this?” • Patients are unaware of the many changes with their insurance, government programs, employer’s coverage and all the ‘rules’ associated with getting services paid. • Patients historically access hospitals once a year or less. Healthcare is very personal!

But Patients Don’t Speak the Language of Health Insurance Today…

…and They May Not Identify with the Language of Value-Based Care Tomorrow Source: M. Ross, T. Igus, and S. Gomez, “From Our Lips to Whose Ears? Consumer Reaction to Our Current Health Care Dialect.” The Permanente Journal. Winter 2009, Vol. 13, No. 1. http://www.thepermanentejournal.org/files/Winter2009/dialect.pdf

Additional ‘factors’ influencing the patient experience= confused=hassle factor • Electronic medical record /EHR – incentive and penalties • Integrated systems between providers/doctors and hospitals but safety with data sharing a concern. • Quality reporting systems –with rewards and penalties • Physicians new payment system- MACRA & MIP • Alternative payment systems for hospitals, doctors, long term care, DME , home health – all in the midst of rolling out with the goal of increased quality, reduced costs and more engaged patients. • What about a change to ‘privatizing’ Medicare? Voucher program -means?

What is a Pt Financial Navigator program - • Every hospital /health provider can do any or all three of the unique components. • Community Outreach – Boot Camps • Employer Outreach – Lunch and Learn for employees • Navigator Resource Library- personal pt/family • As significant healthcare changes occur along with ongoing ‘healthcare buzz’ updates= PFNF Education 2017

Three components of this dynamic program- A community outreach program

1st) Example of Community Outreach Education – Boot Camps Identify community leaders to participate in the boot camp trainings Identify thru existing community services, additional healthcare related ‘hassle factor’ training. Provide education to high schools, colleges, regional and others as requested. Join with existing educational efforts – clinical in nature – to add the financial ‘translation’ for ease of understanding ‘what happens now.” Innovation lab – creating community specific ed.

Population Health means… • As we look to the transforming nature of healthcare – moving from sickness to wellness including quality/value based services with measurable outcomes vs volume/paid for all services with no quality outcomes required PLUS new commercial payer rules… • The Navigator Foundation is in the tent with a multi-disciplined/clinical approach to healthcare – Population Health – managing the chronic, social-economic determining factors, while remembering the pt didn’t ask to get sick, didn’t ask to have their life disrupted and didn’t ask their insurance to pay so little (high deductibles and co-payments) or no insurance at all. Triple Aim..1st=Pt engagement/empowerment. ‘Integration of clinical health and financial health for the holistic approach to population health.’ PFNF Education 2017

Humana’s – Bold Goals programMajor % of market is Seniors- Part C Medicare* (HEALTHCARE BUZZ EX) • 65% of Seniors have multiple chronic conditions • 1/3 have diabetes • 1/4 have mental health • 10% live below the poverty level • 6 doctor visits yearly • 27 prescriptions yearly High cost to the healthcare system for ‘navigating thru’ alone. Social-economic issues. EX) Depressed? Not taking chronic meds. EX) Can’t afford meds = ED is next. (Medicaid?) *Population Health Colloquium. March 27, 2017 Philadelphia PFNF Education 2017

Upcoming Community Outreach Boot Camps2017 2nd 2017 Boot Camp: “Medicare 101, Social Security Benefits, and Assistance for Seniors” July 6th CSI Fine Arts 3rd 2017 Boot Camp: “Turning 65” Oct 28th CSI Fine Arts 4th 2017 Boot Camp: “The Language of Insurance” Feb 3rd CSI All classes are available on the PFNF webpage prior to all trainings. Available for anyone to use..no cost.

2nd) Example of Employer-Specific “Lunch & Learn” Meet with the HR staff to learn about the employer’s insurance plan. Outline the key elements for education to be covered during the 30 min employee ‘Lunch and Learn.’ Hot spots for education (usually): EOB education, out of network, what happens when you are scheduled for a surgery and ‘HealthCare Buzz’ ++ Q&A. Innovation lab – taking the education to the employer.

Employer Insurance Costs/Changes Average Health Savings Account balance for 2015 = $1844 (Can have up to $3400/single; $6750/family) Average contribution by individuals = $1864 Average employer contributions =$948 Average high deductible plan: $2600-13,100 /family; $1300-6550 /single Benefit: Amt deferred for tax impact. Con: Family would have to pay premiums, deductible $, co-insurance $ AND have enough left to put money in the HSA. Healthcare spending 2015-16 • Spending averaged $5141 per individual. • Out of pocket rose 3% to aver $813 per capita • Prescription drugs increased 3.5-9% • Women of all ages spent $236 more out of pocket than men. • $649 per capita was spent on brand prescriptions. • The price of an ER visit jumped 10.5% to an aver of $1,863 • Employers contribute about 73% toward the monthly premium for individuals. 38% for dependents. *MCOL 3-17

So now you need healthcare – Outpt surgery (Sample) – in network • Surgeon’s office will contact your insurance carrier to get the surgery pre-authorized. Insurance carrier has their own criteria for medically necessary services. Many times requires ‘negotiation’ with provider and payer. • Routine bills for an outpt surgery- usually each sent separately: Surgeon Anesthesiologist Pre-op testing Procedure location (Hospital, free standing ctr) IMPORTANT: Validate all of the above are within the network that is part of Cigna’s plan. IN NETWORK

Think like a pt – out of network (means what to the pt or family?) • 40 year old has had emergency foot /ankle surgery approx 8 years ago and taken to a Boise hospital. The surgeon specialized in this type of foot surgery. Both in network at that time. • 3 surgeries later –still problems with rebuilding the foot to allow the pt to walk. • July 2013, employer changes plans and now the doctor and hospital who employees the doctor is out of network. • The pt continues to go to the surgeon who does another surgery Oct 2014 and a follow up minor surgery in 2015. Pt was aware of the change but did not know to do anything different as he was in continuing care. • Insurance pays significantly lower – no adjustment from charges as out of network/no contract. Pt pays all charges except actual payment to doctors, hospitals, tests. Huge financial hit. • What does the employee or pt know of the a) ramifications of out of network, b) prior notice to get approved and c) appeal rights?

PFNF Education 2017

Let’s look at out of network- Surgery done at out of network hospital • Surgery done at an out of network hospital. • Billed charges: $8000 • Out of network deductible applied: $2000 individual • Hospital bills Cigna; Cigna pays ‘reasonable amt’ that would be paid to IN network providers. • Amt eligible for payment from Cigna: $4400 • LESS $2000 out of network deductible • LESS 50% out of network coinsurance after deductible: $2400 x 50% = $1200 • TOTAL AMT PD BY CIGNA: • $4400-$2000 ded- $1200 coins = $1200paid to out of network provider/hospital. • But the hospital is NOT contracted. Therefore, the hospital accepted the $4400 but left due on the account for the pt to pay: $8000 – $1200 = $6800 from pt. **Out of network deductible: $2000 (Separate from any in network deductible) **PLUS 50% copayment: $1200 **PLUS balance billing due to no contract: $8000 - $4400 =$3600 TOTAL DUE FROM PT: $6800

Making it real – Small Employer Premium “Hits” • Small employer in Idaho • Premiums have had 23-25% increase each year/3 years. • Currently for 2 employees: *Exchange was not cheaper/similar* • $1200 monthly premiums • High deductible per person: $7000 • 70/30 coinsurance • “Age “ rated … 60 year old • Annual $14,400 in premiums !! UNSUSTAINABLE • This was before the new GOP plan for up to 5x higher than younger premiums. It is capped at 3x under ACA. • BUT WHAT ABOUT INSURANCE REFORM? Rethink the impact to small employers. No ability to ‘risk share.’ PFNF Education 2017

Health Care Buzz (Ex) 55% of Americans are paying more than last year for insurance. • 1 of 4 Americans health worsened after delaying care because of cost concerns • 30% said their health insurance coverage has gotten worse in the past year. • 1 in 4 lost access to their doctors last year due to insurance networks. (out of network huge costs!!) • 3 in 10 delayed emergency care in the last year out of fear of costs DailyFactoid / MCOL 10-16 Morning consult Biggest changes Doctor’s expect to result from Millennial patient habits in coming years. • Increased use of telemedicine (28%) • Proliferation of walk-in clinic settings (27%) • Growth in online scheduling and extended hrs (24%) • Greater transparency for out of pocket costs (11%) • Easily portable electronic health records (10%) Sprocket Rocket 12-6-16 “Millennial patients challenging status quo, over 2900 US doctors say.” PFNF Education 2017

Employment “Norms” in Huge Flux AARP & MIT Agelab(Population Health 3/17) • By 2020: 1 in 5 students will be 35 yrs or older. • By 2020: 10,000 will be turning 65 every day • By 2020: 1 out of every 5 adults will be over 65; more than under 5 yrs. • 57 year old's are the primary owner of IPad. • 50% of over 60 year old's use the internet • Over 50 years of age = 1/3 of the work force. • Family Care Giver: 42 M adults , age 45-64, providing care for older family/parents. 17%/ 24 M are providing in addition to their ‘day job.’ Multi-generations in the work force. Norm: 3-4 generations. (BB and Millennials = both approach ‘work’ differently.) HealthExecMobile -Multiples • 18.4% of US adults had a mental illness in the past year. • 8.6% reported substance abuse/dependence in the past year • Almost 40% had at least one chronic medical condition during their lifetimes • 1.2% had all three conditions: mental illness, substance abuse/dependence and at least one chronic medical condition. AND more than 50% of Americans now have at least ONE chronic health condition, mental disorder or substance use issue. (Taylor & Francis group news – “Psychology, Health, and Medicine” Oct 2016.) Employees/Pts look different – ages (3-17) • Baby Boomers 51-69 74.9 M • Generation X 35-50 74.2 M – to Surpass BB by2028 • Millennials 18-24 75.4 M – HAVE surpassed BB

Plus more working past 65… “More Americans age 65 & over are still punching the clock and the last time the percentage was this high was when John F Kennedy was in the White House, 1962. “ “Last month, 19% of Americans age 65 and over were still working, according to government data released Fri. That’s the highest rate since, 1962 and it caps a long trend higher since the figure bottomed out at 10% in 1985.” Why? Some work to feel engaged. Others do not have enough money to retire. Employee Benefit Institute survey: Nearly 1/3 of all workers with less then $10,000 in savings will work until 70. *Associated Press 5-7-17 Medicare Secondary Payer Older workers care giving for other adults PS By 2020 – 10,000 people will be turning 65 daily! WOW! PFNF Education 2017

3rd) Examples from the Hospital Navigator Resource Library Thru employer specific meetings, build data base of insurance plans, how to read the EOB, deductibles, etc. 1 on 1 intervention with the patient/family – complete work paper Create glossary of terms Create reference guide for additional community resources Create networking ‘handoffs’ with existing hospital team - payment options, social work, estimates, patient experience, physician offices, others Innovation Lab: After Hours Q&A – Weds 5:00 -6:00 p.m.; using patient portal; tracking and trending improvements/feedback; integration with medical community; face to face and automation.

Think like the family who is scared with a new ER visit w/insurance, employer specific • Daughter has just been admitted thru the ER. (Inpt vs obs means what to the pt?) • Parents are scared and distraught about the health of their daughter with the unplanned ‘admit.’ • As comforting as the care givers are, the financial questions loom large. What happens now? • Who has insurance? What was done with the insurance? What is my coverage? “I have never had to use it before, so I don’t know anything! “ • Think Pt Financial Navigator Program

Think like a patient – Medicare Part C/Managed Care – comes to the ER • 86 year old with Humana. What is done in the ER to inform the pt this is not traditional Medicare? • If the pt is ‘admitting/obs or inpt” – what happens so the pt understands the difference between Traditional Medicare and Part C/Mgd Medicare? • Now they are in a bed, what happens so the 86 year old understands their out of pocket, what coverage there is with Humana that may be different than Traditional, is this obs or inpt? Who has this information for our sick, confused Sr who does not have anyone to ask? • Care givers/family – who do they ask about the above? • Think Pt Financial Navigator Program

Included in Every Event/Training- “HealthCare Buzz” • Factoid: Health Exec Mobile Mon, March 27, 2017 “Although only 4% of all doctors are emergency physicians, they provide care for: 28% of all acute care visits 50% of all Medicaid and CHIP (children) visits 67% of all acute care to the uninsured patients. • Healthcare Bulletin. The Slate Group. March 30, 2017 “An annual health survey conducted by states and Medicare/CMS found that the full ACA reduced the uninsured rate by 44% while also reducing the number of people without a primary care doctor by 12% and those not having an annual check up by 10%.”

It is all doable.. • Have the vision and the passion to make a difference in the hassle factor in healthcare • Remember – all the automation does not replace the human touch. • Remember – our families are the core of healthcare. • It is very personal!

Welcome to the Patient Financial Navigator Foundation, Inc. “MEDICARE 101” PFNF Education 2017

Introduction What Is Medicare?Created 1965- tax funded • A health insurance program for • People 65 years of age and older • People under age 65 with certain disabilities • People with End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) • Administered by Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) (July 1965) • Enrollment by Social Security Administration (SSA) or Railroad Retirement Board (RRB)

Introduction Applying for Medicare • Apply 3 months before age 65 • Don’t have to be retired • Contact the Social Security Administration • Enrollment automatic if receiving Social Security or Railroad Retirement benefits

Introduction Traditional Medicare Medicare Basics Part A Hospital Insurance Part B Medical Insurance Outpt Hospital Services Part D Prescription Drug

Introduction Medicare Coverage Basics

Introduction Medicare Part A • Most people receive Part A premium free- must have 40 worked quarters • People with less than 10 years of Medicare (30-39 quarters)- covered employment • Can still get Part A if worked less 30 quarter • Will pay a premium of $248/$441/$407/$411 per month/2012/13/15/16 $413/2017 • For information about Part A entitlement • Call SSA • 1-800-772-1213

Introduction Enrolling in Medicare Part B • Pay monthly Part B premium • Base with higher amt based on income /beginning in 2007. $99.90 2012, down from $115 2011, $104.90/15&16. • Average monthly premium for Part B $134 per month 2017 • Initial Enrollment Period (IEP) • 7 months starting 3 months before month of eligibility • General Enrollment Period (GEP) • January 1 through March 31 each year • Coverage effective July 1 • Premium penalty • 10% for each 12-month period eligible but not enrolled • Paid for as long as the person has Part B • Limited exceptions

Introduction Paying the Part B Premium • Taken out of monthly payments • Social Security /SSA • Railroad retirement/RRB • Federal government retirement (Plan: Federal BX) • Income adjustments can impact the monthly premium. • For information about premiums –call who enrolled them • Call SSA, RRB, or Office of Personnel Management • If no monthly payments paid by the above--- • Billed every 3 months if no retirement payment • Medicare Easy Pay/auto deduced bank acct

Original Medicare Original/Traditional Medicare Plan – Medicare Costs • Go to any health care provider that accepts Medicare - nationwide • Patients are responsible for out of pocket amounts • Part A – Inpt deductible • $1156 deductible/2012 /$1184 in 2013/$1260 in 2015 , $1288 in 2016. $1316 for 2017. • Deductible is due every 60 days that the pt is out of the hospital. If out of the hospital/Part A for 60 days = another $1316 inpt deductible is due. If 2 admits within the same 60 day period = 1 -$1316 deductible for the 1st admit only. • Additional costs after 60 days if no break in services. Coinsurance days 61-90 $289 per day./$296 2013/$315 2015, $322 2016. • 91-150 Lifetime Reserve days $578 per day/$592 2013./$630 2015 ; $644 2016 • Pt pays 100% after 150 days without a 60 day break • Different costs for other Part A services- with criteria Home Health under Part A if part of a Hospital service - $0 due from pt Home Health under Part B if a ‘free-standing/not part of hospital services.’ Hospice - $5 for associated meds; small amt for inpt respite; no cost other Mental Health inpt stay - $1316 every 60 days out of the hospital

Additional Payment Issues • Part B • $140 yearly 1x deductible in 2012; $147 2013; $147 2015; $166 2016 $183 yrly 2017 • Physician services – ‘accept assignment’ = accept Part B Medicare payment and only bill the pt the ‘yearly deductible amt & coinsurance amt, per CPT code (visit) • Outpt hospital payment program – “frozen” coinsurance amt per CPT code • Critical access hospitals/under 25 beds –outpt 20% of billed charges for outpt hospital. Same inpt deductible for inpt stays. Same co-payment amount for the physician visit. • Free standing/not hospital based services and physician’s not accepting Medicare ‘assignment ‘ – there can be a balance billing amt. This is the difference between the allowed amt and the payment amt. This amt is in addition to the Co-Insurance per CPT code. This is a choice for this group of providers.

Let’s make this real • Medicare Traditional/Original Inpt: • Hospital billed for 4 day medical inpt stay. Billed Medicare $16,900. • Medicare pays a flat fee for the entire stay based on the diagnoses that were treated during the stay. *DRG • Hospitals are required to ‘accept assignment’ with inpt services and must absorb/write off all charges beyond the DRG payment with consideration of the $1318 inpt deductible. • The total payment from Medicare to the hospital: DRG payment *no consideration for charges* less the inpt deductible due every 60 days = Total payment from Medicare. All remaining charges are absorbed. EX) $16,900 DRG payment $10,000 --- from which the inpt deductible of $1,316 is withheld and collected from the pt TOTAL Medicare $` $ 8,684 ($10,000 - $1,316= $8,684) 59% of billed charges Amount written off: $ 6,900 (difference between DRG payment and billed charges. Required)

Another “Real” Example • Outpt Hospital Services - Traditional • Outpt Xray is ordered as part of an ER visit • Doctor ordered; medically necessary due to the nature of the ER visit • Chest Xray 2 V CPT code 77110 Charge: $200 • ER level 4 visit CPT code 99284 Charge: $400 • Total: $600 • Medicare pays according to the CPT code. (Same process with provider offices) Payment: 77100 Medicare flat payment: $44.00 of which the pt pays a froze amt/regardless of charges $9.00 ($35.00 left) 99284 Medicare payment: $230 of which the pt pays a frozen amt/regardless of charges $12.00 ($218 left) TOTAL Medicare payment: $253 plus pt portion $21.00 = TOTAL FROM ALL: $274 46% Hospital accepts assignment and absorbs/writes off: Difference between charges $600- $274 = $326 ***Different for critical access hospitals/under 25 beds

Skilled Nursing Facility +Critical Access = Swing Beds • Requires 3 clinically appropriate days as an inpt to have SNF coverage • 100% coverage of skilled care up to 20 days • 21-100 days, SNF per day out of pocket of $144.50 2012/$148 2013/$157.50 2015/ $161 2016 $164.50 per day 2017 • Very difficult to meet ‘skilled’ up to 100 days a year. • Long term care/LTC = maintenance = no coverage • Many seniors “ spend down” and live in LTC on Medicaid benefits.

Medigap Medigap/Supplemental Insurance • Health insurance policy to cover the out of pocket deductibles and coinsurance. • Sold by private insurance companies • Must say “Medicare Supplement Insurance” • Covers “gaps” in the Original Medicare Plan/not Medicare Advantage/Part C • Deductibles, coinsurance, copayments • Average monthly premium of $150

Making it real – SS $ with Medicare Monthly Reductions • Women live to 85 yrs • Ave SS $1182 • - Part B premium $134 • - Part D premium $50 • - Plan F supplemental insurance for out of pocket $150 • Total premium monthly reductions:$334 • Remainder to live on: $848 **Without Supplemental Insurance, all Part A & Part B deductibles and coinsurance would be due from pt –as used.

Medicare Advantage/Part C/Managed Medicare • Created from the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003. • Private insurance companies are paid a per member-per month fee to manage the Medicare pt. Higher risk based pt = higher monthly fees. • Maximum amt out of pocket to be paid by a pt. $6,700 2017 $5000 2016. • No ability to purchase Medicare Supplemental insurance for out of pocket • Each insurance plan has their own package of services; out of pocket; coverage limitations
