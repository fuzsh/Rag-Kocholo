        "text": "Making a difference for families\n\nEach year, Rocky Mountain Children’s Health Foundation provides critical support to more than 10,000 pediatric patients and their families. Thousands of babies in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) receive precious donor human milk, children with serious medical conditions are matched with loving companion dogs, families will receive financial support in difficult times, and children in the hospital are comforted by a furry friend.\n\nWe believe the world is better when neighbors support neighbors. Families never know when their child is going to be impacted by illness or injury, and when it happens, we’re here to help.\n\nWe provide the financial, nutritional, and emotional support that pediatric patients and their families need to meet their essential needs, allowing them to focus on their child’s well-being. This support takes shape through RMCHF’s four key programs:\n\nDiversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Belonging\n\nWe Believe\n\nOur team is united behind one purpose: supporting pediatric patients and their families during unimaginable medical challenges. Illness and injury do not discriminate, and neither do we. We believe all children and all families deserve access to support, regardless of race, ethnicity, national origin, gender, sexual orientation or identity, age, religion, disability, socioeconomic status, or any other identities. No matter how these children and their families show up in the world, we are here for them.\n\nInternally, we believe inclusion and belonging are critical elements for a thriving work environment. Great ideas can come from anyone. The more people are respected, the more they can bring their personal experiences to the table. The more their voices are heard, the greater impact we can have as a team. Creativity thrives when everyone is given a chance to contribute. Here, all people—and all ideas—belong.\n\nWe Will\n\nWe understand that expressing support for diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging and taking meaningful action are two different things. With action in mind, here are a few of the ways we’re incorporating DEI+B efforts into our day-to-day work:\n\nEducating ourselves and our teams. Education is a crucial step towards fostering an inclusive and equitable environment. DEI+B trainings are incorporated into our annual goals, and we are constantly seeking the latest research and best practices. The more we challenge our own biases and develop deeper empathy, the better we can foster an inclusive community.\n\nIntentional listening. We hold safe space for our employees, stakeholders, and community to engage in conversations around DEI+B. By suspending judgement, focusing on each other, and seeking supportive solutions together, we ensure all voices are heard and respected.\n\nProcess evaluation. Whether they’re new or well-established, we continuously examine our policies, practices, and procedures through a DEI+B lens. We look for areas where inequities, barriers, or exclusionary practices unintentionally exist and make changes for the better.\n\nAdvocating for structural changes. Even if we could do everything right, we still recognize that societal systems often challenge or interfere with inclusivity and equity. By lending our voice to important conversations and engaging in partnerships, we hope to support more long-term impact towards an inclusive society.\n\nWe Know\n\nWe know we are not perfect, and that there is a lot of work to be done. We are dedicated to continuous learning and growing, and we invite you to join us on this journey. If you have any feedback or ideas on how we could better support our diverse community, we encourage you to send us a note. We will do our best to listen with intention and incorporate your feedback in any way possible."
