Our focus is to find less toxic, more effective treatments through a unique collaborative research initiative called the Sunshine Project.\n\nThe National Pediatric Cancer Foundation formed the Sunshine Project, an innovative collaboration with one goal: to bring together the nation’s top doctors and researchers to find a faster cure for pediatric cancer. Through the establishment of the Sunshine Project, the National Pediatric Cancer Foundation has developed a business model that capitalizes on the strengths of researchers from all different fields of science and streamlines the process to accelerate the development of new treatments.\n\nWe currently continue this collaborative research model with more than 30 hospital partners and leading scientists. Since its inception, the NPCF has donated over $30 million to research and has funded over 28 project initiatives."
