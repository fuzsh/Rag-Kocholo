        "text": "The Memorial Hospital Foundation is proud to announce that its strong financial health and ongoing accountability and transparency has earned a Four-Star Rating and a 100/100 score from Charity Navigator. This rating designates Memorial Hospital Foundation as an official “Give with Confidence” charity, indicating that their organization is using its donations effectively based on Charity Navigator’s criteria. Charity Navigator is America’s largest and most-utilized independent charity evaluator. Since 2001, the organization has been an unbiased and trusted source of information for more than 11 million donors annually.\n\nCharity Navigator analyzes nonprofit performance based on four key indicators, referred to as beacons. Currently, nonprofits can earn scores for the Impact & Results, Accountability & Finance, Culture & Community, and Leadership & Adaptability beacons.\n\n“We are delighted to provide Memorial Hospital Foundation with third-party accreditation that validates their operational excellence,” said Michael Thatcher, President and CEO of Charity Navigator. “The Four-Star Rating is the highest possible rating an organization can achieve. We are eager to see the good work that Memorial Hospital Foundation is able to accomplish in the years ahead.”\n\nIn addition to receiving a Four-Star Rating from Charity Navigator, the Memorial Hospital Foundation has also received the 2023 Platinum Seal of Transparency from Candid, also the highest rating an organization can receive. Candid is the result of a recent merger of Foundation Center and GuideStar, two of the most trusted sources of information globally.\n\n“Our Four-Star Charity Navigator Rating and Candid Platinum Seal of Transparency are further validation that our supporters can trust our commitment to good governance and financial health,” said Deidra Church, Memorial Hospital Foundation Director. “The money donated to our Foundation stays right in our community to serve our hospital and patients in all counties we serve. This recognition is something all of our donors and caregivers can all be proud of!”\n\nThe Memorial Hospital Foundation is the fundraising and philanthropic arm of Memorial Hospital and Health Care Center in Jasper, Indiana. Since 1974, the Memorial Hospital Foundation has worked to steward charitable donations directly to assist patients, address the greatest needs of the hospital, and support the communities it serves. The Memorial Hospital Foundation is fully funded by donations and grants from individuals and businesses who are passionate about making an impact in the health of their community.
