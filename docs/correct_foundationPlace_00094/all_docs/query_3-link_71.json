        "text": "Bridgewater HealthCare Foundation earns a coveted 4-star rating from Charity Navigator\n\nBridgewater HealthCare Foundation’s robust financial health and commitment to accountability and transparency have earned it a 4-star rating from Charity Navigator, America’s largest independent charity evaluator. This is the first time that Bridgewater HealthCare Foundation has earned this top distinction.\n\nSince 2002, using objective analysis, Charity Navigator has awarded only the most fiscally responsible organizations a 4-star rating. In 2011, Charity Navigator added 17 metrics, focused on governance and ethical practices, as well as measures of openness to its ratings methodology. These accountability & transparency metrics, which account for 50 percent of a charity’s overall rating, reveal which charities operate in accordance with industry best practices and whether they are open with their donors and stakeholders.\n\n“Bridgewater HealthCare Foundation’s exceptional 4-star rating sets it apart from its peers and demonstrates its trustworthiness to the public,” according to Michael Thatcher, President & CEO of Charity Navigator. “Only a quarter of charities rated by Charity Navigator receive the distinction of our 4-star rating. This adds Bridgewater HealthCare Foundation to a preeminent group of charities working to overcome our world’s most pressing challenges. Based on its 4-star rating, people can trust that their donations are going to a financially responsible and ethical charity.”\n\n“It’s important for our donors to be able to trust that we’re using their donations wisely to support the residents and team members of Bridgewater Retirement Community,” said vice president of development and community relations Carrie Budd. “Our 4-star Charity Navigator rating demonstrates to our supporters our good governance and financial accountability.”"
