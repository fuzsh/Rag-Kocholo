We also want to express our gratitude to our sponsors and supporters.\n\nJoin us next at the Bocce Tournament on October 3rd at Campo di Bocce! Sponsorship opportunities are available.\n\nCatholic Charities of Santa Clara County, Bridges of Hope Faith-Based Reentry, has been awarded the Counties Behavioral Health Hero award in May!\n\nBridges of Hope provides trauma-informed, client-centered, culturally appropriate services through case management, addressing barriers to self-sufficiency. We first greet people at the jail when they are released and direct them to reentry. Once referred and enrolled with Bridges of Hope, services consist of an assessment, development of a wellness service plan, linkage to mental health, primary health, substance use treatment, shelter, transitional housing, and basic needs like food, hygiene, transportation, cell phone connection and a place to receive mail. We provide work clothes, assist with union dues, tattoo removal, anger management, certificate programs, education, and employment through Catholic Charities Right Directions, as well as furniture, bedding, and rental assistance once a person is ready for permanent housing.\n\nWe attend court appointments and reconnect parents with their children. Our collaborative care model and diverse, multidisciplinary team of service navigators and case managers are essential to our integrated approach throughout Catholic Charities and the community.
