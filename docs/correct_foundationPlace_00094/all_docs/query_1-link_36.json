A Vision for COP28 and Beyond\n\n16:45 - 18:15 GST, Side Event Room 5 (125 Pax)\n\nTo add real value, COP28 and the Global Stocktake need to send clear and specific signals as to what parties and non-party stakeholders could usefully do after COP28 in order to collectively achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement, both as part of an immediate response as well as through more ambitious NDCs in 2025. The other part of the mandate of the GST, on enhancing international cooperation, presents an important hook that could be used to move from zero-sum confrontational and incremental increases in ambition and implementation towards needed transformation. The normative potential of the UNFCCC process should be leveraged to ensure that all stakeholders — national governments, local authorities, civil society, the private sector, national level practitioners, multilateral organizations and U.N. agencies, among others — align their efforts to deliver an effective response to COP28 and the GST. C2ES, EDF, and IDDRI will set out a theory of change for moving from incremental progress in the UNFCCC to transformational levels of ambition and implementation.\n\nSee full event details\n\nSpeaker(s):\n\nJuliana Arcingiegas, Director, Transforma\n\nHenri Waisman, Director of the Deep Decarbonization Pathways Initiative, Institute for Sustainable Development and International Relations (IDDRI)\n\nMandy Rambharos, Vice President, Global Climate Cooperation, EDF\n\nXolisa Ngwadla, South Africa\n\nSunday, December 3\n\nOrganized by EDF\n\nEffective Participation of Indigenous Peoples and Local Communities in Jurisdictional REDD+\n\n11:00 - 12:00 GST, Nature Positive Pavilion\n\nThis session will dive into several examples of the effective participation of Indigenous peoples and local communities in jurisdictional REDD+ in Central America, South America and Central Africa.

The ETA will help participating countries speed their transition from fossil fuel to clean power and achieve their nationally determined contributions. The ETA partners will be joined by senior representatives of countries and companies expressing their interest in participating in the ETA.\n\nNutrition, Gender and Climate: A Just Transition towards Nourishing Nations\n\n11:00 - 12:00 GST, Food Systems Pavilion\n\nAs three billion people suffer from global hunger, further exacerbated by the effects of climate change, the world is waking up to the need to integrate and align global food systems transformation alongside climate mitigation and adaptation. However, as we continue to de-risk and build resilient food systems, one population group — women — is easily overshadowed in decisions, policy changes and implementing solutions. Women play a crucial role in the food supply chains; more than half are engaged in post-harvest food supply chains, and many more are invisible. Therefore, it is imperative that climate-resilient food systems solutions be gender- and nutrition-sensitive, leaving no one behind.\n\nSee full event details\n\nSpeaker(s):\n\nDr. Ismahane Elouafi, Executive Managing Director, Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR)\n\nDr. Purnima Menon, Senior Director for Food and Nutrition, International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI)\n\nDr. Nicoline de Haan, Director, CGIAR GENDER Platform\n\nFred Krupp, President, EDF\n\nDr. Shakuntala Thilsted, Director for Nutrition, Health and Food Security Impact Area Platform, CGIAR\n\nBen Wismen, CGIAR\n\nThe Evolving Voluntary Carbon Market: Reconciling the Paradox Between Innovation and Supervision\n\n11:30 - 13:00 GST, Side Event Room 4\n\nThe event offers an opportunity to discuss the contrasting trends of increasing transparency and innovation in the realm of carbon credits. The VCM has grown dramatically in recent years, but the quality of some carbon credits has been questioned. While harmonized standards and close supervision increase market transparency, they may restrict innovation. How can we reconcile innovation, transparency and integrity through voluntary and regulatory interventions?\n\nSee full event details\n\nSpeaker(s):\n\nSimone Borghesi, Director, Florence School of Regulation – Climate (FSR Climate); Professor, European University Institute (EUI); Professor of Environmental Economics, University of Siena\n\nAndrea Bonzanni, Director, International Policy, IETA\n\nManish Dabkara, CMD & CEO, EKI Energy Services\n\nPedro Martins Barata, Associate Vice President, Carbon Markets and Private Sector Decarbonization, EDF\n\nAmy Merrill, Senior Director, Head of Global Carbon Markets, ICVCM\n\nPankaj Pandey, COO, EKI Energy Services Ltd\n\nBianca Gichangi, Advisor, Office of the Special Climate Envoy for Kenya\n\nHow Ambitious Emission Reductions Can Save Lives\n\n12:45 - 13:45 GST, GCA Action Arena, Al Wakri, Room 2\n\nTaking rapid and ambitious action to address the climate crisis and reach the goals of the Paris Agreement is critical to protecting lives and livelihoods. This event will highlight the health opportunities of ambitious climate mitigation policies, both in terms of reduced climate impacts and possible co-benefits of specific mitigation actions across key fields including energy, transport and agriculture. This event has 3 objectives: to showcase the vast benefits of climate mitigation policies on safeguarding human health, as well as progress so far and new commitments; spotlight leaders (governments, cities, organizations) who are at the forefront of enacting ambitious mitigation policies and unlocking the benefits of those policies on human health and provide a platform to launch two reports.\n\nSee full event details\n\nSpeaker(s):\n\nDesta Lakew, Group Director of Partnerships and External Affairs, Amref Health Africa\n\nAngela Churie Kallhauge, Executive Vice President, Impact, EDF\n\nErnst Kuipers, Minister of Health, Netherlands\n\nDamilola Ogunbiyi, CEO & Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General for Sustainable Energy for All; Co-Chair of UN-Energy\n\nJoy Phumaphi, Former Botswana Minister of Health; Co-Chair of the Pathfinder Initiative\n\nRafał Trzaskowski, Mayor of Warsaw, Poland\n\nOrganized by EDF\n\nIs There a Pathway to 15-20+ Country Packages by 2025? Five Country Perspectives.\n\n15:30 - 16:30 GST, CATF Pavilion\n\nThroughout 2023, The Rockefeller Foundation and EDF organized a Just Energy Transition (JET-P) convening series. We hosted six dialogues focused on cataloguing lessons learned over the past three years. The first two dialogues were retrospective, focused on cataloging lessons learned from the first wave of JET-P agreements in South Africa, Vietnam and Indonesia. In the following four dialogues, we assessed their implications for designing a scalable model that could realistically and efficiently be applied to promote a just transition from fossil fuels in 15-20 countries by COP30. This culmination of the dialogue series will highlight five different country perspectives on how to build on the JETP early movers, to scope, fund and deliver additional country support packages that help address domestic political-economy barriers to faster energy and economic transitions.\n\nU.S. Leadership Delivering Ambitious Methane Emissions Reductions in the Oil and Gas Sector\n\n17:00 - 18:00 GST, U.S. Center\n\nThis panel discussion will highlight U.S. commitments and concrete actions to achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement by supporting methane emission reductions in the oil and gas sector.

Since then, two additional countries have been selected in the form of North Macedonia and Dominican Republic. The ACT Investment Program is the world’s first and largest multilateral program to facilitate coal transition in key emerging markets by tackling key challenges associated with policy and institutional reforms, governance, and coal asset infrastructure. It is driven using a programmatic approach that involves the development of country-led investment plans (IP) which is the outcome of a deeply consultative process involving key stakeholders at the country-level. The session seeks to share lessons learnt from the journey so far - from ambition setting to role of consultative engagement with local stakeholders, the importance of ensuring a just and inclusive transition, coal asset level considerations, underlying challenges, and the road ahead. It will bring together experiences from the program perspective, multilateral engagement and most importantly, country insights from those at the forefront of these issues, particularly in the Philippines and North Macedonia.\n\nSee full event details\n\nThe six countries under the program are at different stages of implementation. While ACT IPs for South Africa and Indonesia have been approved by the CIF governing body totaling USD 1 billion in funding, the Philippines has recently concluded its IP process and North Macedonia is at advanced stages of its development. In the meantime, the ACT Investment Program has gone on to become a central, catalytic component in the first-of-their kind and multi-billion dollar Just Energy Transition Partnerships (JETP) in South Africa and Indonesia.\n\nSpeaker(s):\n\nKreshnik Bekteshi, Minister of Economy, North Macedonia\n\nAndrea Hauser, Member of the Management Board, KFW Development Bank\n\nGabriel Azevedo, Chief Strategy Officer, IDB Invest\n\nMandy Rambharos, Senior Vice President, EDF\n\nAbhishek Bhaskar, Lead, CIF Accelerating Coal Transition (ACT) Investment Program / JETP\n\nOrganized by EDF\n\nChina Carbon Market Development and Outlook Forum\n\n9:00 - 10:15 GST, China Pavilion\n\nThis event is hosted by the Climate Change Department of the Ministry of Ecology and Environment of PRC, co-hosted by Beijing Municipal Ecology and Environment Bureau, sponsored by National Center for Climate Change Strategy and International Cooperation, Emission Trading Expert Committee of Chinese Society of Environmental Sciences, Beijing Green Exchange, and Environmental Defense Fund (EDF).

But while we acknowledge the critical importance of phasing out fossil fuels, we must also dedicate ourselves within the current ecological cycle to building a bioeconomy which enables humans, nature and climate to thrive. The long-term goal we need to have in our sights is to sustain the flourishing lives of up to 10 billion people, foster a thriving ecosystem, and restore equilibrium to the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. This is what ultimately what the bioeconomy needs to deliver. Our current bioeconomic approach focusses on what we need to break down and not on what we need to build. This paradigm is not fit for purpose and incentivization structures around it are not serving a long-term goal.\n\nSee full event details\n\nSpeaker(s):\n\nJohn Kornerup Bang, Senior Vice President for Sustainability Transformation, Stora Enso\n\nDavid Brand, Convening Chair, International Sustainable Forestry Coalition (ISFC); Chair, New Forests\n\nMandy Rambharos, Vice President, Global Climate Cooperation\n\nEllie Besley-Gould, Associate Partner, Xynteo\n\nAchieving Near Zero Methane Emissions\n\n14:45 - 15:45 GST, Malaysia Pavilion\n\nMethane is the second largest contributor of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and is responsible for at least a quarter of today’s global warming. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), the energy sector is one of the major methane emitters, accounting for 40% of total methane emissions attributed to human activity. Rapid reduction of methane emissions in the short term is required to quickly address climate change. The Global Methane Pledge launched at COP26 in 2021 aims to reduce methane emissions by at least 30% by 2030 and since then, 149 countries, including Malaysia and five other ASEAN countries, have joined the pledge. The world is facing increasingly stringent legislation on methane emissions. The European Union (EU) has recently rolled out the first EU-wide legislation for methane emissions whereby it implements stricter obligations to monitor emissions, detect and repair methane leaks under the ‘Fit for 55’ package. The United States through Inflation Reduction Act included a provision on methane fee that is called a “waste emissions charge.” Japan is developing methane emissions Measurement, Monitoring, Reporting and Verification (MMRV) framework to provide comparable and reliable information across the value chain.\n\nSee full event details\n\nSurmounting challenges remain in getting access to financial investments and technologies for accurate monitoring and detection. The COP28 Presidency Action Agenda includes a target to achieve near-zero methane emissions by 2030 for the oil. This panel session will focus on what it takes to navigate the challenges and to bridge the gap to reach near-zero methane emissions level by 2030, spotlighting on the different geographical needs through regional partnerships and collaborations in the energy sector.\n\nSpeaker(s):\n\nLorena Perez, Climate Director, IPIECA\n\nBrad Grabtree, Asisstant Secretary for Fossil Energy and Carbon Management, U.S. Department of Energy\n\nMark Brownstein, Senior Vice President, Energy Transition, EDF\n\nSantiago Martinez Ochoa, Head of Sustainability and Decarbonization, Ecopetrol\n\nJustine Roure, Deputy Vice President, Strategy & Policy, Oil and Gas Climate Initiative (OGCI)\n\nLeveraging Data for Transparency and Efficiency in Voluntary and Compliance Carbon Markets\n\n15:00 - 16:30 GST, Korea Pavilion\n\nThe global efforts to combat climate change have highlighted the critical role of carbon markets in achieving emission reduction targets. Carbon markets are divided into two key segments: the Voluntary Carbon Market (VCM) and the Compliance Carbon Market (e.g., Emission Trading Scheme, or ETS). Both of these markets are instrumental in channeling investments towards projects that lead to verifiable and measurable emissions reductions. Acknowledging the significance of these markets, there's a growing focus on harnessing data and technology to enhance transparency, credibility and efficiency.\n\nSee full event details\n\nSpeaker(s):\n\nH.E.

However, both face key challenges regarding their scalability and effectiveness: understanding how volatility can be reduced in voluntary markets, how we can reinforce integrity in all carbon markets using measurement, reporting and verification (MRV), how to optimize and strengthen digital technology to unlock the potential of carbon markets and how to reduce uncertainty and fragmentation across all carbon markets.\n\nSee full event details\n\nSpeaker(s):\n\nMandy Rambharos, Vice President, Global Climate Cooperation, EDF\n\nDanielle Smith, Premier, Alberta\n\nAhmed Patel, Chief Business Process Outsourcing, Solutions+\n\nGuy Turner, Managing Director, Carbon Markets, MSCI\n\nAlexia Kelly, Managing Director of the Carbon Policy and Markets, High Tide Foundation\n\nOil and Gas in Transition: Clarifying Producer Responsibility and the Roles of NOCs and IOCs\n\n12:00 - 13:00 GST, CATF Zero Carbon Future Pavilion\n\nThe panel will focus on the role of oil and gas producers, including national oil companies and international oil companies, on the road to net zero. Economic and geopolitical crises continue to challenge assumptions regarding the role of fossil fuel producers and the future of the energy system, as even the countries most committed to climate action seek out new sources and potentially lock in fossil fuel consumption for decades. It is clear that any energy transformation will require the participation — and some leadership — from major oil and gas producers.\n\nSee full event details\n\nSpeaker(s):\n\nMark Brownstein, Senior Vice President, Energy Transition, EDF\n\nOrganized by EDF\n\nHow Leading States Can Deliver Big on the US NDC\n\n13:15 GST, WWF Panda Pavilion/America is All IN Pavilion\n\nMany U.S. states have been climate leaders for years, including stepping up at a critical time during a lack of federal leadership to commit to achieving U.S. climate targets under the Paris Agreement. Now that the federal policy landscape has shifted in the past two years, with the Biden administration forcefully re-engaging in climate action and passing historic investments in clean energy, how can 25 leadership states & territories make the most of this moment to drive climate progress forward? This panel will showcase new analysis revealing states’ progress to date (relative to their commitments) and quantify the transformative role that these states can play to close the remaining gap to the U.S. NDC, as well as discuss the opportunity for binding state emissions policies to provide a pathway for governors and policymakers to achieve their climate commitments while unlocking federal investments to improve public health and grow strong clean energy economies.\n\nSee full event details\n\nSpeaker(s):\n\nGina McCarthy (Moderator)\n\nPam Kiely, Associate Vice President, U.S. Region, EDF\n\nRick Duke, Deputy Special Envoy for Climate US Department of State\n\nSerena Coleman McILwain, Secretary of the Environment, Maryland Department of Environment\n\nCaroline Choi, Senior Vice President, Corporate Affairs, Edison International\n\nBoosting the Phase-Out of Methane Emissions\n\n14:00 - 17:00 GST, ICC Pavilion\n\nThis meeting co-organised by the Task Force on Carbon Pricing in Europe and the International Finance Forum, is a follow-up of the side event which took place in Sharm El-Sheikh in the premises of the International Chamber of Commerce. We will monitor the progress realised since last year by the oil and gas sector. We will see if some of them, who have already made most of the necessary investments to phase out methane emissions could not lead the way to the other oil and gas companies. We will explore the role of public authorities and raise the question of the creation of a global entity under the heading of a World Climate Organisation (WCO), complementary to the WTO, which in the spirit of the Montreal Protocol, would put in place global rules and regulations to lead the whole sector to comply to net-zero emissions of methane.\n\nSee full event details\n\nSpeaker(s):\n\nEdmond Alphandéry, Chairman, Task Force on Carbon Pricing in Europe\n\nZHU Xian, Former Vice President, World Bank and New Development Bank\n\nPhilippe Varin, Vice-Chair, International Chamber of Commerce and Chairman of the Board of ICC France\n\nTomás de Oliveira Bredariol, Energy and Environmental Policy Analyst, International Energy Agency (IEA)\n\nRoland Kupers, Global Advisor, International Methane Emissions Observatory\n\nJonathan Banks, Global Director, Methane Program, Clean Air Task Force\n\nKahina Abdeli-Galinier, Business Director for Emissions Management, SLB\n\nJulien Perez, Strategy & Policy Vice President, OGCI\n\nAlan Haywood, Senior Vice President, ESG, BP\n\nMatt Kolesar, Chief Environmental Scientist,ExxonMobil\n\nNurgul Kuzembayeva, Operations Environment Manager, KPO, Kazakhstan\n\nSantiago Martinez, Head of Sustainability and Decarbonization, Ecopetrol, Colombia\n\nSusan Shannon, Vice President of Policy & Advocacy, Shell, UK, The Netherlands\n\nDaniel C.

Mitigation action in China is essential to reducing global methane emissions and meeting the 1.5 degree temperature goal. Against this backdrop, a group of leading international NGOs (INGOs) in China—Energy Foundation China (EF China), Environmental Defense Fund (EDF), World Resources Institute (WRI), Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), and Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI)—are working together toward a shared vision to dramatically enhance China’s methane mitigation ambition and action at this critical moment.\n\nSee full event details\n\nNovember 2023 marked a historic milestone in China's methane mitigation efforts. Building on years of dedicated work to integrate methane into sectoral mitigation actions, the Central government internally expedited the progress of the National Action Plan on Methane Control (NAP). Just ahead of the COP28 climate conference, China officially introduced the NAP in November 2023. Subsequently, following the official meeting between the Climate Envoys of China and the U.S. on November 16, the two nations jointly issued the Sunnylands Statement on Enhancing Cooperation to Address the Climate Crisis. This statement brought methane emissions into the spotlight, emphasizing their pivotal role that methane is playing in addressing the global climate change issues.\n\nDuring COP 28, Energy Foundation China is collaborating with the iNGO group to host an exchange, aiming at facilitating discussions on China’s NAP and best international practices on synergizing methane abatement with food\\energy\\health that enable more ambitious mitigation achievement. Through this event, we hope to forester the consensus on a shared vision among think tanks, academia, civil society and philanthropies on the challenges and opportunities ahead to further strengthen China’s commitment on methane mitigation endeavors.\n\nSpeaker(s):\n\nFu Sha, Director of Strategy and Planning, Energy Foundation China\n\nMark Brownstein, Senior Vice President, Energy Transition, EDF\n\nZou Ji, CEO & President, Energy Foundation China\n\nMarcelo Mena, CEO, Global Methane Hub\n\nLiu Qiang, Director, Climate and Deputy Chief Representative China\n\nTeng Fei, Professor, Institute of Energy, Environment and Economy, Tsinghua University\n\nLiu Yu'e, Research Fellow, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences\n\nGao Qingxian, Researcher, Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Science\n\nZhang Qiang, Professor, Department of Earth System Science, Tsinghua University\n\nJohn Tauzel, Senior Director, Global Agriculture Methane, EDF\n\nNew MRV Capacities and Their Impact on Methane Emissions Data Transparency: How NDCs Should Capitalize and Respond in a Harmonized and Validated Way\n\n16:00 - 17:00 GST, Chez ICC, ICC Auditorium\n\nA growing number of satellites and other remote sensing technologies are coming online and making more emissions data publicly available — enabling us to see sources of methane and CO2 that previously went undetected, as well as giving us a more accurate picture of the sources we were already aware of. Companies, governments, financiers, and civil society looking to cut methane stand to benefit from increased data access and availability in new and exciting ways yet capturing the full benefits of this data require trust in its quality and usability — specifically a MRV framework that is globally accepted by multiple institutions.

With the potential to flexibly deliver energy without polluting the climate, hydrogen could be a valuable climate solution if we get it right, particularly for decarbonizing sectors that are difficult to electrify. That’s why the United States, Europe and other countries and regions are deploying vast new incentives to jumpstart a new clean hydrogen economy. But how it is produced, managed and used all matter. Get those right, and these investments could have an enormous climate benefit. Get them wrong, and we risk squandering huge resources on projects that could increase climate pollution while worsening local air quality.

These challenges have created many uncertainties for the future, especially for developing countries that are faced with the dual crises of climate change and debt. As the deficit in global climate governance continues to enlarge, it is only through cooperation between public and private sectors, Eastern and Western countries, and the global North and the global South, can we jointly address these global challenges. The China Council for International Cooperation on Environment and Development (CCICED) and the BRI International Green Development Coalition (BRIGC) are important platforms for promoting North-South dialogue and South-South cooperation. Representatives of Chinese and foreign governments, CCICED members, special advisors and partners, BRIGC members and partners, experts in priority areas of green transition, including climate, energy, transport, urban development and finance, as well as representatives of the private sector, will be invited to engage in discussions on green industry and economic growth, green development and security, and international cooperation on climate change, to promote dialogues on green transition and gather greater consensus for green development.\n\nSee full event details\n\nSpeaker(s):\n\nSteven Guilbeault, International Executive Vice Chairperson, CCICED; Minister, Environment and Climate Change, Canada\n\nXie Zhenhua, Vice Chairperson, CCICED; China Special Envoy for Climate Change\n\nZhao Yingmin, Secretary General, CCICED; Vice Minister, Ministry of Ecology and Environment of China (MEE); Head of the Chinese Delegation to COP28\n\nDr. Zhang Yujun, Deputy Secretary-General, CCICED, Director General, Foreign Environmental Cooperation Center(FECO), MEE\n\nAndrew Steer, CCICED Member; President & CEO, Bezos Earth Fund\n\nChristie Ulman, CCICED Member; President, Sequoia Climate Foundation\n\nXue Lan, CCICED Member; Dean, Schwarzman College, Tsinghua University; Co-Chair, Leadership Council of the UN Sustainable Development Solution Network (UNSDSN)\n\nZou Ji, CCICED Special Advisor; CEO & President, Energy Foundation China\n\nLi Yonghong, Assistant Secretary General, CCICED; Deputy Director General, FECO, MEE\n\nWang Yi, CCICED Member; Deputy Director of the National Committee of Experts on Climate Change; Member of the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress of China\n\nHal Harvey, CCICED Member; Founder, Energy Innovation\n\nMarco Lambertini, CCICED Member; International Special Envoy, WWF\n\nPete Harrison, Executive Vice President, Regions, EDF\n\nGu Hongbin, Deputy Director-General, China Renewable Energy Engineering Institute\n\nDr. Zhang Jianyu, Executive President, BRIGDI\n\nErik Solheim, CCICED Member; Vice President, BRIGC; Senior Advisor, World Resources Institute (WRI)\n\nZhai Dongsheng, Director, Belt and Road Initiative Center of National Development and Reform Commission of China\n\nLaura Clarke, CEO, ClientEarth\n\nLei Hongpeng, CCICED Special Advisor; Global Director, Climate, Children’s Investment Fund Foundation\n\nAbid Suleri, Executive Director, Sustainable Development Policy Institute\n\nOrganized by EDF\n\nValuing the Treasures of the Twilight Zone: Mesopelagic Species and Their Delivery of Biodiversity, Climate, Food and Other Services\n\n14:00 - 15:00 GST, Ocean Pavilion\n\nThe extremely abundant species of the mesopelagic realm are one of the ocean’s most undervalued treasures. Comprising an astonishing array of biodiversity that may represent 95% of global marine biomass, they play a critical role in ecosystem functioning and are viewed as a potential replacement for dwindling sources of fishmeal and fish oil. However, their potential to help address climate change via movement of fixed carbon into the depths has only recently become a focus of ocean research — there remains much we need to learn to ensure a precautionary approach that includes climate dynamics is fully incorporated before considering any new targeting of these species for industrial exploitation.

Comprising an astonishing array of biodiversity that may represent 95% of global marine biomass, they play a critical role in ecosystem functioning and are viewed as a potential replacement for dwindling sources of fishmeal and fish oil. However, their potential to help address climate change via movement of fixed carbon into the depths has only recently become a focus of ocean research — there remains much we need to learn to ensure a precautionary approach that includes climate dynamics is fully incorporated before considering any new targeting of these species for industrial exploitation. We must fully evaluate the benefits they can provide humans and nature both in and out of the water and use this information to set up regulatory frameworks to help guide how the world’s nations value and use mesopelagic species to balance ecological and human needs.\n\nSpeaker(s):\n\nPeter Thompson, Ambassador, UN Secretary-General’s Special Envoy for the Ocean\n\nDr. Kilaparti Ramakrishna, Senior Advisor to the President and Director on Ocean and Climate Policy, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution\n\nDr. Cymie R.

In 2022, almost 735 million suffered from hunger, 3 billion couldn't afford healthy diets, and a third of global food production was lost or wasted, costing trillions. This event aims to engage stakeholders with actionable solutions for more sustainable consumption patterns, promoting healthier food choices, and reducing food loss and waste. It will also emphasize outcomes, future policies and investments in healthy, affordable and sustainable consumption by improving food environments, enhancing demand for healthier food, exploring alternative proteins, and reducing food loss and waste across urban-rural areas.\n\nSee full event details\n\nSpeaker(s):\n\nEric Schwaab, Senior Vice President, People and Nature, EDF\n\nOrganized by EDF\n\nLittle Fish, Big Impact: Transforming School Meals through Local Aquatic Foods\n\n11:00 - 12:00 GST, Food Systems Pavilion\n\nAt the nexus of school meals, nutrition, and climate resilience, there lies an untapped opportunity to integrate locally sourced, sustainable aquatic foods into school meals. As the COP Presidency has clearly indicated the important role that food systems will play at this year’s COP28 conference, the pivotal role of aquatic foods in ensuring nutrition and food security for some of the world’s most malnourished and climate-vulnerable populations cannot be overlooked.\n\nSee full event details\n\nWhen sourced or grown sustainably, aquatic foods can increase food and nutrition security, bolster community economies, sustain livelihoods, and protect our planet. Through innovative national strategies and collaborative programs, regions across the world are embracing aquatic foods and the potential they have to support the development and health of children. From Africa to Europe, real-world examples underscore the potential of this approach for supporting nutrition outcomes, ensuring healthier children, thriving local communities and a more resilient planet.\n\nSpeaker(s):\n\nJennifer Chow, Senior Director, Climate Resilient Food Systems, EDF\n\nMichelle Tigchelaar, Research Scientist, Stanford Center for Ocean Solutions and Aquatic Blue Food Coalition\n\nSuzanne Njeri, Association of Women in Fisheries Kenya (AWFBEK)\n\nDr. Ariane Hildebrandt, Director General of the Department for Global Health, Equity, Digitalization, and Food Security; Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation at BMZ\n\nOrganized by EDF\n\nMarrakech Partnership Implementation Lab: Aquatic Food and Protein Transition\n\n12:30 - 13:30 GST, Lab 2, Al Jeer\n\nThe Transforming Aquatic Food Systems event aims to look holistically at the state of the aquatic food sector (food derived from aquatic animals, plants or algae that are caught or cultivated in freshwater and marine environments).

There are currently too few compelling examples of what it means to actually transform food systems in line with food security, nutrition, climate and nature goals. In this panel, governments and civil society organizations discuss the potential catalytic power of plurilateral action in closing the ambition and implementation gaps on food systems.\n\nOrganized by EDF\n\nForgotten Foods and Future Harvests: Enabling Food Producers to Thrive in a Climate-Impacted World\n\n15:30 - 16:30 GST, Food Systems Pavilion\n\nThe increasing over-reliance of our food systems on a limited range of products presents pressing challenges in the context of a rapidly changing climate. Harvest failures and fisheries collapse are increasing risks for food security and livelihoods around the world. Many of the “adaptations” proposed include creating more environmental damage and consuming more natural resources. This event will explore the crucial role of food system diversification in building more sustainable and resilient food systems, including both aquatic and terrestrial food systems. Diversification is not easy, and speakers will unpack barriers and pathways forward, including the actors and actions needed to deliver food systems that work for both people and nature.\n\nSee full event details\n\nSpeaker(s):\n\nShakuntala Thilsted, Director, Nutrition, Health and Food Security Impact Area Platform, CGIAR\n\nAmbassador Ertharin Cousin, CEO & Founder, Food Systems for the Future\n\nPamela Mayorga Caro, Indigenous Peoples' Marine Coastal Space\n\nIshmael Sunga, CEO, Southern African Confederation of Agricultural Unions (SACAU)\n\nAlexander Müller, Founder & Managing Director, TMG\n\nMahlet Mesfin, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Oceans, Fisheries and Polar Affairs, U.S. Department of State\n\nOrganized by EDF\n\nDelivering Solutions to Agricultural Methane while Supporting Nutrition\n\n16:45 - 17:45 GST, Food Systems Pavilion\n\nMethane emissions are one of the major drivers of climate change and cutting these emissions is recognized as the most impactful way to slow the rate of global warming. Agriculture is responsible for 40% of human-caused methane emissions, with the major sources being livestock and rice systems. Agriculture will therefore need to play a crucial role in reducing human-caused methane emissions and countries meeting their commitments under the Global Methane Pledge. Cutting methane emissions from agriculture is critical to slow the rate of climate change but, if done incorrectly, we risk increasing malnutrition globally. This panel will focus on understanding the future and current state of solutions and discuss how companies and farmers are implementing solutions.\n\nSee full event details\n\nA critical consideration in addressing agriculture methane is the important role that livestock and rice systems play in providing foundational and comprehensive nutrition to the global population. Finding solutions that continue to support the role of these foods in global nutrition, and supporting the farmers that produce them, is key to reducing methane emissions from agriculture while also enhancing nutrition for the world.\n\nSpeaker(s):\n\nEric Schwaab, Senior Vice President, People and Nature, EDF\n\nOrganized by EDF\n\nPromoting the Declaration Of 2028 as Year of Saline Agriculture: Climate Resilient Agriculture for Sustainable Production Systems and Healthy Ecosystems in Salt-Affected Areas\n\n18:00 - 19:00 GST, Food Systems Pavilion\n\nThe technical session will bring together professionals and experts representing prominent organizations from Europe, South America, the Middle East, Far East and West-North Africa, who will showcase work on saline agriculture and its potential. It is expected that more than 100 participants will attend the session, both in-person and virtually. This emphasizes the importance of the topic and a major interest in finding solutions to mitigate and adapt agriculture to salinity. This session is particularly relevant in the context of COP28, since climate change can severely aggravate salinization due to prolonged droughts. With scarce rainfall, the groundwater table drops, as water is pumped out for domestic use and to irrigate farmland. In coastal regions, this can force seawater into aquifers, to flow further inland, aggravating salinity issues.\n\nMonday, December 11\n\nOrganized by EDF\n\nHow Can Carbon Finance Create Opportunities for Indigenous Peoples and Local Communities?\n\n11:10 - 12:10 GST, Indigenous Peoples Pavilion\n\nWorking together with technical and strategic partners engaged with topics related to carbon markets and IPs and LCs at global, regional and national levels, this public event at COP28 aims to highlight the importance of the application of social and environmental safeguards, as part of high-integrity VCM, and learnings and best practices on this topic; showcase examples of how carbon finance has supported nature-based solutions and IPs' and LCs' sustainable development within their territories, focusing on success stories plus how strategies and actions were integrated; identify key challenges and action-steps toward scaling-up Indigenous engagement and Indigenous benefits into VCM finance and projects; and introduce the work already done by the ICVCM to consolidate integrity and include IPs' and LCs' rights and concerns into the CCPs and Assessment Framework.\n\nSee full event details\n\nSpeaker(s):\n\nMark Moroge, Vice President, Natural Climate Solutions, EDF (Moderator)\n\nMere Takoko (Ngāti Porou, Te Whānau a Apanui, Rongowhakaata), Vice President, Conservation International Aotearoa, New Zealand\n\nFermin Chimatani Tayori, Leader of the Harakbut People of Madre de Dios Peru and President of the National Association of Executors of the Communal Reserves Administration Contract in Peru (ANECAP)\n\nIsack Bryson, Hadzabe Community Member and Project Manager, Carbon Tanzania\n\nMelena Pollard, Toshao Leader of River’s View, Guyana\n\nNavy Kroeung, Bunong Community Member and Village Coordinator for the Keo Seima Project (WCS), Cambodia\n\nCoastal Seas and People: Co-Design of Transformative Marine Solutions\n\n14:00 - 15:00 GST, Ocean Pavilion\n\nLocal ecological knowledge systems and the connection of coastal communities to mangroves have been overlooked in marine science research, conservation, and policy.
