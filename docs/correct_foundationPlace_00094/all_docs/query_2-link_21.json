        "text": "More trails and counting in 2021\n\n2021 was an incredibly successful year for IMBA and for trails. We continued our mission to create, enhance, and protect great places to ride mountain bikes. We furthered our vision for everyone to have access to great places to ride, from trails close to home to iconic, backcountry experiences. We continued to focus on more trails close to home to see new trails in 250 communities by 2025. We’re no longer selling the idea of trails—communities and trail champions are coming to us. We’re no longer explaining trails take time—our innovations in trail planning and building have accelerated timelines. Great trails close to home are happening, and more communities want in.\n\nCreated In Columbus Committed in Chattanooga Engaged in Salt Lake\n\nIMBA Resources\n\nCommitted Partners\n\nIn Chattanooga\n\nRiders in Chattanooga have long had many miles of shared-use singletrack, but have lacked a variety in trail styles that will introduce more riders to mountain biking and keep riders pedaling as their skills progress. Now, nearly a dozen partners in the Chattanooga trails community–led by IMBA Local partner SORBA Chattanooga and local trail champion Taft Sibley–are ambitious and all-in for more and better trails. IMBA has partnered with local leaders to help secure land, funding, trail planning, trail design, education, construction, and training for ongoing stewardship that will sustainably maintain the area’s first one-way trails and gravity trails. These trail systems are so close to home, you can see rooftops through the trees. Walden’s Ridge Park will open summer 2022 after two years of advanced construction by IMBA Trail Solutions.\n\nEngaged Communities\n\nIn the Salt Lake Valley\n\nThe Bonneville Shoreline Trail has become a model for more trails close to home, passing six Utah counties in the Salt Lake Valley and serving as a backyard trail to over one million residents. Simultaneously, it’s a long-distance dream, potentially stretching 280 miles from the Idaho border to Nephi, Utah, and connecting near trail systems like Draper’s Corner Canyon, which hosts the biggest NICA league in the country. IMBA has been a partner on the trail for more than two decades through education, trail design, trail construction, and by leading the Bonneville Shoreline Trail Advancement Act in Congress, a bill that would adjust federal land management boundaries to connect more of the Bonneville Shoreline Trail. The bill received hearings in April, June, and November 2021, and has strong bipartisan support.\n\nTrails are Common Ground\n\nTrails have become more crowded than ever. Evolving technologies by all trail users creates conflict between user goals and experiences, and risks trail access long-term. Trails and trail systems of yesterday are no match for the user needs of today and tomorrow.\n\nIMBA was a catalyst to unite local, regional, and national advocacy organizations and companies to cast a new vision for trail use and experiences with Trails are Common Ground. The national initiative launched in late 2021.\n\nNever before have trail user and advocacy groups collaborated in this way to make trails more welcoming and inclusive for everyone; to lift user knowledge and empathy so users are kinder and more responsible; and to innovate how trail systems are planned and designed to accommodate various trail pursuits harmoniously.\n\nIMBA Supporters and Partners\n\nAre Creating More Trails\n\nMore trails close to home happen thanks to forward-thinking and acting supporters of all kinds. Philanthropic support of IMBA’s mission and programs in 2021 was the strongest in years—an expression of confidence in IMBA’s progress to support trail development in 250 communities by 2025.\n\nCompanies and foundations recognize the need to accelerate trail development. We thank every single company, retail business, and foundation that stepped up and forward with generous support IMBA can devote to trail development. In particular, Tom and Steuart Walton for helping IMBA pioneer Trail Accelerator Grants. These grants help projects get off the ground and leverage more funding for project completion, seeing upwards of 2,100-fold increases in funding for trails.\n\nIMBA thanks Niner Bikes for promoting a bike sweepstakes featuring a rad, one-of-a-kind JET 9 RDO that raised more than $45,000 for trail advocacy and development. Niner puts its heart and soul into the IMBA mission. As does Shimano, which takes advocacy and creating trails seriously. Shimano is a generous, collaborative partner with their finger on the pulse of issues facing mountain bikers. Shimano is not only the backbone of corporate giving to IMBA’s work, it also powers Dig In to help IMBA Local Partners raise more for trail project needs.\n\nIMBA welcomes new and phenomenal philanthropic partners, including VISTA Outdoor Foundation. VISTA Outdoor Foundation joins IMBA’s more trails close to home initiative in a big way. IMBA thanks all the awesome outdoor companies behind VISTA. Plus a new foundation partner joins IMBA to create new trails in Omaha, Nebraska. The Conine Family Foundation continues as a significant partner supporting IMBA’s strength in government relations.\n\nMeet All Our Partners\n\nThe Singletrack Society, donors that make generous and major gifts to the mission, grew by 30 percent in 2021. The Society made one of the biggest differences in IMBA’s ability to support IMBA Local Partners, to win on the policy front, and to educate more communities on trails. Society members are special, fun individuals who care, share the IMBA vision, and see the return on their philanthropy. Thank you to each and every member of the Society. Consider joining them.\n\nDonors of every kind and at every level were generous in helping IMBA in 2021. Thousands made donations to the IMBA mission and to programs like Dig In. The IMBA team thanks you."
