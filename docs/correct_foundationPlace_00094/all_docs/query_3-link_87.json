Tunnel to Towers keeps fundraising and administrative costs at a minimum, with only a small percentage of funds allocated to overhead expenses. For the past several years, the Foundation’s program service percentage on average was 95% – 95 cents out of every dollar goes directly to our programs and services. Program service ratio is a key barometer used to measure operating effectiveness. The organization’s Chairman and CEO, Frank Siller, is an uncompensated volunteer. For seven years running, the Foundation has achieved the highest rating, four stars from Charity Navigator, the nation’s largest and most-utilized evaluator of charities.\n\nFUNCTIONAL EXPENSES\n\n2022\n\nFY22 Audited Financial Statements\n\nRead more\n\n2022 Form 990\n\nRead more\n\n2021\n\nFY21 Audited Financial Statements\n\nRead more\n\n2021 Form 990\n\nRead more\n\n2020\n\nFY20 Audited Financial Statements\n\nRead more\n\n2020 Form 990\n\nRead more\n\n2019\n\nFY19 Audited Financial Statements\n\nRead more\n\n2019 Form 990\n\nRead more\n\n2018\n\nFY18 Audited Financial Statements\n\nRead more\n\n2018 Form 990\n\nRead more\n\n2017\n\nFY17 Audited Financial Statements\n\nRead more\n\n2017 Form 990\n\nRead more\n\n2016\n\nFY16 Audited Financial Statements\n\nRead more\n\n2016 Form 990\n\nRead more\n\n2015\n\nFY15 Audited Financial Statements\n\nRead more\n\n2015 Form 990\n\nRead more\n\nCORPORATE POLICIES\n\nConflict of Interest Policy\n\nRead more\n\nDonor Privacy Policy\n\nRead more\n\nRecords Retention & Destruction Policy\n\nRead more\n\nWhistleblower Policy\n\nRead more\n\nANNUAL REPORTS\n\n2022 Annual Report\n\nRead more\n\n2019 Annual Report\n\nRead more\n\n2018 Annual Report\n\nRead more\n\n2017 Annual Report\n\nRead more\n\nCharity Navigator rates Tunnel to Towers at the Highest Level!\n\nSince inception, the Tunnel to Towers Foundation has committed to practicing sound fiscal management, organizational efficiency, and program integrity.
