        "text": "At Allina Health Cancer Institute (AHCI), we offer comprehensive and proactive patient financial navigation, designed to help ease the burden of cancer treatment costs. Our goal is to minimize the financial barriers to cancer care to improve patient outcomes and quality of life.\n\nIn cancer care, advanced chemotherapy, immunotherapy, targeted therapies and other advanced medications are the major cost drivers. Although these treatments hold great promise in prolonging patients’ lives and improving their quality of life, the advances come with significant costs. The CDC projects that the national costs of cancer care will reach $246 billion by 2030.\n\nUnfortunately, patients are bearing an increasing proportion of these costs through increased out-of-pocket responsibilities such as premiums, deductibles, coinsurance and co-pays. This cost shift causes financial stress and hardships for patients and families and may even affect patient outcomes and recovery after cancer treatment.\n\nWhat is financial toxicity?\n\nFinancial toxicity describes the distress or hardship caused by the financial burden of cancer treatment. Patients with cancer are at higher risk for financial hardship, including personal bankruptcy, than the general population.\n\nSimilar to the side effects of cancer treatments, financial problems after a cancer diagnosis can also cause physical, social and emotional difficulties for patients and their loved ones. These difficulties include:\n\nIncreased stress, anxiety and other psychosocial effects\n\nReduced quality of life\n\nPoorer adherence to treatment\n\nDelays in medical care\n\nDecreased survival\n\nStudies show that, among adult cancer patients:\n\nUp to 73% experience some level of cancer-related financial toxicity.\n\n38% postponed or did not fill drug prescriptions to save money.\n\nBankruptcy is 2.65 times more likely than for people without cancer.\n\nThose who filed for bankruptcy had a 79% greater risk of early mortality.\n\nThe interaction between the financial and clinical aspects of cancer care, therefore, represents an emerging challenge to the oncology community. This interaction is an important contributor to disparities in treatment and outcomes in this patient population.\n\nWhat is a financial navigation program?\n\nA financial navigation program can help patients, their families and caregivers understand and better manage financial issues related to cancer care. Financial navigation focuses on addressing and preventing financial toxicity by guiding patients through the complexities of the health care and health insurance system.\n\nHealth literacy is challenging for patients and families who are already coping with the uncertainties of a cancer diagnosis and treatment. Many can benefit from professional guidance to understand cancer care, health insurance coverage and financial assistance resources. AHCI provides comprehensive training for financial navigators so that they can fully support patients in reducing their risk of financial toxicity.\n\nExperienced financial navigators at Allina Health Cancer Institute\n\nOur specially trained financial navigators focus on facilitating access to care by reducing the financial barriers many patients face. Patients can meet with our financial navigators at all AHCI locations. The program is available to patients and families throughout the continuum of cancer care, from diagnosis through treatment and survivorship.\n\nTo reduce the financial burden of cancer, we work closely with patients and families to:\n\nScreen patients upfront for assistance eligibility, identifying financially at-risk patients and prioritizing those who have the most financial need\n\nEducate patients about their financial responsibilities for cancer care\n\nEvaluate patients’ health insurance plans to ensure that they’re leveraging all available programs and services\n\nConnect them with resources to support living expenses such as food, housing, utility bills, transportation and more\n\nAddress and minimize out-of-pocket costs through:\n\nPatient foundation resources for co-pay assistance\n\nPharmaceutical companies’ drug assistance programs\n\nTrained financial navigators produce positive outcomes\n\nRecent studies show that financial navigation programs benefit patients through lower out-of-pocket costs, resulting in greater patient satisfaction. In addition, the programs also mitigate financial losses for health care institutions. Over time, we expect to see patient benefits in better treatment adherence, increased survival and improved quality of life.\n\nPartner with Allina Health Cancer Institute: how to refer your patients\n\nWe welcome referrals from health care providers across the Twin Cities, western Wisconsin and beyond. Here’s how you can refer a patient to AHCI for cancer care:\n\nProviders within Allina Health can place a consult order within Epic.\n\nProviders from outside Allina Health can refer patients by calling our nearest cancer center:"
