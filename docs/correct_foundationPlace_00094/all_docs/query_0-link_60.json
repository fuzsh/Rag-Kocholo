        "text": "A central priority of the Parkinson’s Foundation is to ensure that all people with Parkinson's disease (PD) can obtain the care they need to improve their health and quality of life. Currently, care for people with PD is varied and comprehensive care is not easily accessible.\n\nThe Parkinson’s Foundation Global Care Network creates more opportunities for people with PD to access high-quality care while also providing health professionals the chance to advance and share their knowledge.\n\nThe Global Care Network broadens the Foundation’s footprint of care settings – closing the gap between those diagnosed with PD and those receiving comprehensive care, information and support. Our aim is to ensure that all people with PD have access to equitable and quality care —getting what they need, where and when they need it. This is essential to ensuring that all people with PD can live their best lives.\n\nCenters of Excellence\n\nThe Foundation has designated 54 medical centers around the world as Centers of Excellence, including 40 in the U.S. A Parkinson's Foundation Center of Excellence is a medical center with a specialized team of neurologists, movement disorder specialists, physical and occupational therapists, mental health professionals and others who are up to date on the latest PD medications, therapies and research to provide the best care.

Our curriculum is based on the latest Parkinson’s information, pharmacological and non-pharmacological therapies, care recommendations and interprofessional communication.\n\nDeveloped by PD educators, with decades of care experiences, this program provides direct care staff and other professionals with knowledge they can apply to client care tomorrow.\n\nParkinson’s disease is a complex neurodegenerative disease. Most clients who move to a senior residential community or bring in-home care are in the mid-late stages of PD with challenging care needs. Providing individualized care to support client needs requires knowledge and confidence in common symptoms and management tools. The program distills the complexity of PD into applicable information and tangible tools to help staff immediately provide optimal care to enhance their clients’ quality of life.\n\nVirtual & In-person Training\n\nThis program provides a full curriculum of Parkinson’s education through virtual and in-person trainings.

Many are nurses or social workers but can serve in any role within their organization.\n\nThe Role of a Site Champion\n\nTypically, each member site has at least two site champions who are responsible to steward at least 70% of the staff to complete the online education models and implement the tools learned in the everyday care of their clients.\n\nSite champions:\n\nAre the primary representatives of the program at their site.\n\nEnsure education for new and existing staff using the provided Community Partners in Parkinson’s Care online curriculum.\n\nRaise awareness of membership.\n\nPerform timely collection of outcome data and reports based on the schedule provided.
