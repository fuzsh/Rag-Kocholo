        "text": "Our highly trained specialists are available 24/7 via phone and on weekdays can assist through online chat. We connect patients, caregivers, and family members with essential services and resources at every step of their cancer journey. Ask us how you can get involved and support the fight against cancer. Some of the topics we can assist with include:\n\nReferrals to patient-related programs or resources\n\nDonations, website, or event-related assistance\n\nTobacco-related topics\n\nVolunteer opportunities\n\nCancer Information\n\nFor medical questions, we encourage you to review our information with your doctor.\n\nBenefits of patient navigator training and credentialing\n\nTo date, navigation has been inconsistently available, and types and depth of services have varied. Training and credentialing will help build a standardized professional knowledge base and positively impact oncology patients by expanding access to high quality navigation programs and services. Standardized training will also help reduce barriers and health disparities among various patient groups.\n\nProgram benefits for navigators:\n\nGreater credibility with the formal endorsement of your patient navigation expertise\n\nImproved knowledge and skills of the complex cancer care system\n\nEnhanced understanding of how to tailor support by patient needs\n\nPreparation for greater responsibility and professional development\n\nProgram benefits for oncology practices:\n\nEnhanced role clarity and defined scope for non-clinical patient navigators\n\nIncreased recognition and commitment to the diverse needs of patients, caregivers, and community\n\nAbility to meet CMS training requirements for providing principal illness navigation services eligible for reimbursement\n\nThis program was developed with specific training for CMS-required competencies announced as part of the 2024 Physician Fee Schedule and alignment to the PONT standards. It is uniquely designed to support successful billing for non-clinical navigation services under CMS Principal Illness Navigation (PIN).\n\nWho is this program for?\n\nThe ACS Leadership in Oncology Navigation training and credentialing program is designed for any individual or organization seeking recognition for providing professional non-clinical navigation aligned to CMS competencies and professional oncology navigation (PONT) standards, including but not limited to:\n\nPatient Navigator/Oncology Patient Navigator\n\nProfessional Navigator\n\nSocial Worker\n\nNurse Navigator\n\nCommunity Health Worker\n\nPromotores/Promotoras de salud\n\nFinancial Navigator\n\nClinical Trial Navigator\n\nPatient Care Coordinator\n\nRegistered Nurse\n\nLicensed Practical Nurse\n\nTrusted resources and expertise\n\nThe American Cancer Society is an experienced leader in patient navigation, working alongside partners and stakeholders for over 30 years to establish the field of navigation. ACS has funded patient navigators and navigation programs, developed navigation training curricula, and united organizations through the American Cancer Society National Navigation Roundtable. The American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network (ACS CAN), our advocacy affiliate, has championed policies that expand sustainable access to patient navigation.\n\nNow, we are expanding our navigation work even further with training and credentialing for professional navigators, in active partnership with oncology providers and the cancer community. We’re working to make navigation training more accessible, with a goal of broadening and maintaining our national reach.\n\nStandardized training is more important than ever, especially in an environment that strives to tailor to diverse populations. Reducing barriers with expertly trained navigators will lead to a positive impact that overall reduces health disparities among various patient groups. ACS is uniquely positioned to lead these efforts as a trusted source of cancer information and a patient advocacy organization that stands for high quality cancer care for all.\n\nAccess assistance for the training and credentialing program are available through the Leadership in Oncology Navigation Equity Support (ACS LION-ES) program. Our goal is to reduce financial barriers to the ACS LION program by offering enrollment to a limited number of individuals at no charge.\n\nMore information, eligibility requirements and a link to the application form are available in our Request for Applications overview.\n\nACS is dedicated to strategically redirecting the funds gained from this course into efforts to support the rapidly growing field of patient navigators. Learn more about our work in patient navigation.\n\nReimbursement for professional, non-clinical navigation\n\nExpanded cancer navigation: “Principal Illness Navigation”\n\nThe 2024 Physician Fee Schedule from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) includes reimbursement for professional, non-clinical patient navigation services for patients with a “Principal Illness,” including cancer and other high-risk conditions.\n\nFor the first time, there are reliable reimbursement pathways to support the professional patient navigation workforce.\n\nCMS-required training competencies include: patient and family communication, interpersonal and relationship-building, patient and family capacity building, service coordination and systems navigation, patient advocacy, facilitation, individual and community assessment, professionalism and ethical conduct, and the development of an appropriate knowledge base, including specific certification or training on the serious, high-risk condition/illness/disease addressed in the initiating visit.\n\nTo learn more, read our professional navigation payment FAQ.\n\nAdvisory Council\n\nThe American Cancer Society Leadership in Oncology Navigation (ACS LION™) program is excited to announce and welcome the newly appointed members of our ACS LION Advisory Council. ACS is an experienced leader in patient navigation, working alongside partners and stakeholders for 30+ years and are proud to continue this collaborative approach.\n\nJoin us in thanking the following advisory council members for their dedication to patient support and patient navigation through this opportunity. Stay tuned for more updates throughout the year!"
