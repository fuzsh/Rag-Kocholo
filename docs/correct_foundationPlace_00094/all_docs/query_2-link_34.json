        "text": "How Will You Pay For College?\n\nOur Financial Aid Office provides financial assistance to eligible students from federal, state, institutional, and private sources. We also provide information to families about where to find funding, how to apply, and advice on budget and finances. Financial assistance can come in the form of grants, scholarships, loans, or employment—and you may end up using more than one of these, depending upon the level of financial need and what you are eligible for.\n\nWe're Here to Help\n\nWhether you use one or more options to help you pay for college, the first step is always the same—every student interested in any financial aid must obtain an FSAID prior to applying for aid.\n\nThe second step is to apply electronically through the FAFSA process. It’s a lot of information, but don’t be intimidated—our office will be happy to help you through it.\n\nCollege Financing Plan/Shopping Sheet\n\nThe Shopping Sheet is intended to provide estimated net price information (defined as estimated cost (price) of attendance – including tuition and required fees, books and supplies, room and board (meals), and other related expenses – minus estimated grant and scholarship aid) to current and prospective students and their families based on what similar students paid in a previous year.\n\nTo see your College Financing Plan/Shopping Sheet, once awarded, login to your Student Center on My Maricopa then:\n\nFind View Financial Aid.\n\nSelect Awarded Year.\n\nScroll down to College Financing Plan.\n\nOptional Payment Plan\n\nSMC has partnered with Nelnet Campus Commerce to let you pay your tuition and fees throughout the semester, making college more affordable.\n\nYou may be eligible to enroll in a monthly payment plan. For more information, and to see enrollment deadlines, download the Nelnet Payment Plan Flyer.\n\nDACA Students\n\nPlease visit the Maricopa County Community College District webpage for complete information and resources.\n\nInformación en Español haga clic aqui\n\nVideos"
