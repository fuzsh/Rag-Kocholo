        "text": "Children’s Colorado is leading the way in integrating holistic social services within a medical care setting. Five years ago, we instituted psychosocial screenings at our well-child visits. Of the patient families who completed the survey, about 20% reported struggles related to finances, public benefits, food insecurity or other issues. In 2017, we took our proactive approach a step further by launching a new role: the Community Health Navigator. Our team of 14 navigators meets one-one-one with patient families, helping them to address immediate needs and access clinical, financial or social supports. Last year, Community Health Navigators served more than 5,000 families, and surveys showed they helped to resolve around 75% of their clients’ resource needs. Supporting families with add-on social services means that we can have a stronger, more consistent impact on overall child health and well-being.\n\nFood insecurity has become a growing challenge, with around 30% of Coloradans struggling with hunger. Five years ago, Children’s Colorado convened a Food Security Council with a bold goal to give the state’s vulnerable children access to timely, high quality, affordable food. Since then, we have partnered with other organizations to establish a hospital-based food clinic, Healthy Roots, which now serves about 50 families per week. Children’s Colorado also established its very own community garden on the Anschutz Medical Campus, which produces around 1,500 pounds of produce annually for the food clinic. And when the COVID-19 pandemic shut down schools in 2020, Children’s Colorado quickly launched a mobile grocery distribution service in partnership with Aurora Public Schools, distributing food to more than 14,000 families. Funded by philanthropy, these important initiatives give families critical access to the nutrition they need to be healthy.\n\nMany kids who are treated for asthma also face significant health barriers, including housing, food and financial challenges. Recognizing this reality, Children’s Colorado launched new programs and partnerships to reach families in their communities. For example, our asthma team offers home visits to teach families how to administer asthma medication and to identify potential asthma triggers, like mold or dirty air vents. The program then connects families to resources to create a healthier home. Another program provides asthma outreach and education in local schools to empower kids to better manage their condition. Data show that kids who participated in these programs had fewer asthma-related trips to the emergency room. The program has been so successful that the Environmental Protection Agency recognized Children’s Colorado with a National Environmental Leadership Award in Asthma Management."
