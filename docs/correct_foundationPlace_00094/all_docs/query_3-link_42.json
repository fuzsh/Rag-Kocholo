        "text": "In this three-part series, we will seek to outline what is insurance-driven prior authorization, followed by input from the provider community on its impact and ending with a patient’s experience in trying to get approval that was directed/requested by their primary physician.\n\nAt the completion of the series, the outline of challenges that have increased in the past few years and how it is impacting the physician and their patients will be clarified.\n\nWhat is “Prior Authorization” and how does it work when accessing healthcare?\n\nAs the country continues to struggle with how to address the continually rising overall costs of healthcare, the expanded use of prior authorization has become a powerful tool used by insurance companies.\n\nHow does it work and why it is used? One of the common themes heard in healthcare — overutilization of services. This can be referred as “not medically necessary services” when an insurance company denies prior approval. This is confusing to the patient who has a health issue, sees their physician, the physician believes diagnostic work is required to confirm a diagnosis, and then the insurance carrier rejects the request for the requested services — essentially refusing to pay for the requested service. The process of “prior authorizing” is the most common definition of an insurance plan’s process for only approving “high-value care.” Sometimes the requested service is denied but the insurance company recommends something else — with questionable knowledge of the patient’s history. How much more confusing can it get to the patient? The doctor believes it is needed. The testing is available in the patient’s network. But the insurance plan says no. Is this “insurance-directed care or physician-directed care?” Now what?\n\nPrior authorization is a tool used by insurance plans to determine if the test or chemotherapy drugs or inpatient admit or outpatient procedure or almost any service that is ordered meets the plan’s definition of “value based or medically necessary care.”\n\nPrior authorization can be a concern to the healthcare community as it can cause serious delays in treating the patient‘s condition along with the ongoing dialogue with the insurance plan to try to “negotiate” coverage, or change to another test, or tell the patient they can pay for it themselves since the insurance will not authorize the service, and/or appeal the insurance plan’s decision (which patient knows how to do this?) or forgo the testing/procedure?\n\nMany times a patient will hear their provider state: “I am ordering an MRI to see the damage but will have to wait to see if your insurance will cover it.” Or “I really need a Vitamin D test to rule out this issue with your undetermined muscle pain but I know your insurance won’t cover this.” Patient may be thinking: “And what am I supposed to do if my insurance says no? Is my doctor ordering something that is not ‘medically necessary?’” Wow — the terminology in healthcare can be confusing.\n\nIdea: When a medical test/procedure/specialized medication is needed for your health, the person who cares the most is you. The physician/provider is best prepared to provide the insurance plan the medical information they need during the prior authorization process. But if the plan denies the care, immediately place a call to the insurance plan. There is usually a customer service number on the insurance card. This is the first call as you will need to “push” a bit to get to the right person to discuss the denial. Request to know why it was not approved; what you can do to get it approved; and what other options do you have.\n\nDay Egusquiza is the president and founder of the Patient Financial Navigator Foundation Inc. — an Idaho-based family foundation.
