But when a mass shooting took place as the crowd gathered to watch the July 4th Independence Day parade in Cooper’s hometown of Highland Park, IL, his life was changed forever.

        "text": "July 3, 2024\n\nStatement Regarding July 4th Highland Park Parade Mass Shooting Anniversary and Plea Deal Court Hearing Last Week\n\nKeely Roberts, 2022 Highland Park Fourth of July parade shooting victim, mother to Luke and Cooper Roberts, parade shooting victims\n\nJuly 3, 2024 -- On July 4th, 2022, our lives were shattered forever. For us, 2024 July 4th represents not the 2nd anniversary of one of the worst mass shootings in our country … where seven people were brutally killed, and 48 others viciously and violently shot in an act of extreme cruelty … a horrifically evil event that left my 8-year-old son, Cooper, fighting for his life, then paralyzed from the waist down. For my family, this 4th of July is the 730th anniversary of the total annihilation of our lives.\n\nIt has been 730 days since Cooper was able to walk. Seven hundred and thirty days since he was able to run and chase his brother in the backyard, climb the playground equipment at the park or school, play on his soccer team, run the bases at the ballpark or jump on his bed, the living room couches or play at a trampoline park. It has been 730 days since Cooper was able to wake up, jump out of bed and run downstairs ready for his favorite breakfast or sleepily walk upstairs at the end of the day, ready to crawl into his bed, exhausted from playing outside or in a soccer tournament. It has been 730 days since Cooper and Luke raced each other to the car in the morning on the way to school and it has been 730 days since they chased one another out of the school building at the end of the day to go home. It has been 730 days since I was able to walk hand-in-hand with my sweet, sweet Cooper.\n\nThis past week I, like dozens of victims of the Highland Park 4th of July mass shooting, attended a court hearing where we were told the shooter would change his plea to guilty and before official sentencing took place, we would have the opportunity to address the court and provide victim impact statements. Unfortunately, that is not what happened. Rather, what played out was yet another example of the re-victimization of victims; the continued infliction of suffering on innocent people who continue to suffer in unthinkable ways.\n\nI almost didn’t go because it is literally impossible to describe what it is like to have a total stranger try to kill you and your family. Our sweet little twin boys had their lives destroyed in a blink of an eye; one dying on a sidewalk while the other one, injured himself, was left bleeding and traumatized beyond description -- believing he just witnessed the murder of his twin brother and watching his mother bleed, all while gunshots and screams filled the air.\n\nCooper, a happy, kind, athletic little boy is now paralyzed; his every-day for the rest of his life forever impacted by the horrific decisions the shooter, and all who directly or indirectly aided him in allowing this massacre to happen. I knew that I would not be able to properly explain the guilt and anguish that you experience as a parent when you cannot protect your children from harm. I knew I would fail at finding the right words to describe what the shooter has done to my four daughters who live every day with indescribable survivors’ guilt; their young adult lives forever changed by this. We can’t even live in our home -- it no longer meets Cooper’s needs – and I lost a career that I love which supported my family. Everything in our lives has changed. That family who walked to the parade that awful day are gone. They no longer exist.\n\nAs victims, we have already watched the father of the shooter accept a plea deal himself for the actions he engaged in that contributed to our hell on earth July 4th. I watched him walk into the courthouse wearing the white t-shirt he had customized with black letters that read, “I am a political pawn” across the front & “Laws, Facts, Reality” across the back. Really?\n\nI was reminded of this type of cruel and continued pain and suffering last week when I gathered with fellow victims for what we all believed would be the entering of a guilty plea for the shooter. And, once again, along with all of you, I witnessed the continued destruction of good, caring, innocent people---people who have suffered more in a lifetime than anyone should have to. I witnessed brave victims and their loved ones show up to court, permanently transformed by the senseless acts of evil; carrying burdens that weigh us down, keep us up at night and break our hearts daily. And once again, I bore witness to the continued cruel abuse that we are forced to suffer – again and again and again.\n\nI watched the shooter wheeled into court in a wheelchair which felt like a knife to my heart; it took my breath away … just one more injustice inflicted. We were told that the shooter requested a wheelchair because he was “nervous.” Do you know how “nervous” Cooper is every day of his life? Can you imagine the emotions Cooper continues to feel as a little 8-year-old who was shot and almost killed and was left paralyzed? Can you imagine the feelings he deals with every day as he deals with constant pain, physically and emotionally, as he is forced to live his life as a paraplegic? Cooper never gets to decide if he wants to use a wheelchair or not. No, Cooper’s choices were stolen – violently – from him. I sat in the courtroom for the rest of that hearing, fighting back tears of pain, with my fellow victims, all watching in horror as it quickly became apparent that there would be no guilty plea entered. Once again, the shooter calls the shots, literally.\n\nThe timing of last week’s awful, painful court hearing came on the heels of the 2nd anniversary of the mass shooting and the reinstatement of Highland Park’s 4th of July parade. My family and I will not be attending the parade this year. Truthfully, I do not know if my family will ever be able to attend another parade again.\n\nWhen the very worst things happen to people, I think that there is a natural desire to want to believe that – eventually – they recover; that healing and restoration will occur. I used to be a person who wanted to believe that; I think I probably did believe it. I thought that eventually, enough time could elapse for someone’s pain to diminish and for them to have their “before-the-hurt” lives restored. I know now that this is not true. That horrific day will live in us forever, Cooper’s life especially and irrevocably shattered.\n\nHurt and suffering are not political issues; they are human ones. I am disinterested in politics as I believe it is everyday people, not politics or politicians, who have the power to transform our lives and society. That said, I have always been emotionally drawn to and impacted by Robert F. Kennedy’s remarks to the Cleveland Club on April 5th, 1968; the day after the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. Here is an excerpt:\n\nWhy? What has violence ever accomplished? What has it ever created? No martyr's cause has ever been stilled by his assassin's bullet.\n\nNo wrongs have ever been righted by riots and civil disorders. A sniper is only a coward, not a hero; and an uncontrolled, uncontrollable mob is only the voice of madness, not the voice of the people.\n\nWhenever any American's life is taken by another American unnecessarily - whether it is done in the name of the law or in the defiance of law, by one man or a gang, in cold blood or in passion, in an attack of violence or in response to violence - whenever we tear at the fabric of life which another man has painfully and clumsily woven for himself and his children, the whole nation is degraded.\n\nI believe these words to be true. It was not just Cooper’s life, or Luke’s, or mine, or that of my entire family who were destroyed in that mass shooting. It was not the lives of only the named victims of this crime. Every one of our lives were damaged by this shooter and this act of senseless violence. This was a murderous attack on all of us -- no American life went unscathed that day.\n\nLast week was also filled with another important benchmark event, Luke and Cooper’s 10th birthday. I spent it both celebrating their lives and reflecting upon the awe and humility I have when considering their strength, courage, resiliency and the love they have for others; despite the horrible pain that has been inflicted upon them. They continue to love wholly and completely; still putting others before themselves. Our family celebrated their birthday filled with gratitude for their arrival and survival. We welcomed their 10th birthday with joy and the absolute deepest levels of appreciation for all who played critical roles in saving Cooper’s life and for those whose selflessness and bravery that day helped Luke do what no 8-year-old should ever have to. And for all who have so graciously and lovingly prayed for Cooper to live despite all of the odds---your prayers were heard and felt.\n\nThe boys’ birthday falling in the middle of these difficult experiences; the plea hearing that unraveled and the impending 2nd anniversary of the mass shooting felt like it was exactly as it should be; a day to remember that we have so much to be grateful for and to celebrate in our lives as we keep fighting onward in this forever journey of survivorship.\n\n# # #\n\nDecember 7, 2023\n\nHoliday Season Update, December 2023\n\nNew photos: www.dropbox.com\n\nBefore the morning of July 4, 2022, Cooper was a typical, happy 8-year-old boy who played sports, wrestled with his twin brother, loved dancing to all music - especially country - and looked forward to starting 3rd grade. But when a mass shooting took place at his hometown parade in Highland Park, IL, his life and that of his family was changed forever. His mother was shot, Cooper sustained life-threatening wounds, and his twin brother Luke witnessed everything, spattered in shrapnel and blood from his family. After months in the hospital, then rehab, Cooper remains in a wheelchair.\n\nAs I sit here, searching for all the right words that just aren’t coming to describe the past few months with our family in the “new normal,” I feel that familiar burning in my eyes as I fight back tears. The tears come from this internal cyclone of emotions that lives every day in my heart and soul; the constant swirling and mixing of grief and gratitude, loss and love, fear and fight, sadness and joy; the desire to curl up and cry and the need to do everything in my power to save my family, save myself from drowning in hurt; to scratch and claw to reclaim any precious moment of peace and happiness and familiarity I can find.\n\nEvery day is a battle; a literal fight for your life; a thousand calculated decisions to make to not just be a survivor, but to actually survive. Yes, we lived through a mass shooting, and I am unfathomably grateful for that outcome that many people don’t get. But the residual “shrapnel” of our lives – the broken pieces we will be fixing forever, the severed spine of my 8-year-old, the massive trauma for his twin – cut far deeper than I ever thought. In a mass shooting, we rightly grieve for the dead, the gone. I’m not sure I’ve thought enough about those who survive and at what cost.\n\nI remind myself that this is a long war, one that requires me to summon everything I have to meet the demands of the depth and breadth of commitment required every day, knowing that there is no finish line in this race, no end to the battles we have to fight. This is our “after-the shooting” life, filled with daily obstacles to overcome. And, if I am being totally honest, the emotional challenges that come with the holidays -- like the heartbreaking ghosts of holidays past that seem to linger around us, always reminding me of the family we were before July 4, 2022, that day we walked straight into Evil and destruction … it is draining. And sad. And I am tired.\n\nI used to love these magical weeks of the winter holiday season. It always felt like the world was just a little lighter, everyone a little happier, there was a glow. I still feel that way some days. There are times when I feel “normal” again, when I can feel that holiday happiness and excitement. I say with more than a little shame, though, that there are also days that I don’t. The pain and heartache come on at random moments: driving by and seeing kids playing an activity that my boys no longer can, parking my car and seeing how quickly and easily other families can get in and out of their vehicle -- no worrying about whether the limited handicap parking spots will be available and whether the van’s ramp will work, no having to help their child transfer from the seat in the car to his wheelchair.\n\nSurvivorship is lonely and isolating. Yet, I know we are not alone in this struggle. And I know that there are so many people – directly impacted or not by the shooting– who continue to go out of their way to show their support for Cooper, Luke and our family; people who dedicate themselves to extending care and support in whatever ways are needed to help us heal. For that, I am so eternally grateful. Your love, prayers and support sustain and inspire me. Thank you just isn’t enough.\n\nSo, in my pledge to always be fully transparent and vulnerable about what this experience of surviving is like, I must admit these are hard, hard days. No days off, no weekends or holiday breaks to be able to walk away – even for just a little bit – from this new life we have been forced into, no vacations from reality. Each day is filled with reminders of exactly what Evil did to us that day. Our bodies are different now, our home, my career, the vehicles we drive, the activities the boys can access … you name it, every corner of our life has been hit by this. We cannot escape it, so we are trying our hardest to live with it.\n\nWe work hard every day even on the hardest days, to lean into the Light and to not get pulled under by the Dark. For example, while we work towards having an accessible home that meets all of Cooper’s daily living needs, we are living in a home that presents lots of daily obstacles. Sadly, our family home is no longer a comfort, but a challenge. No longer do we have the joy of experiencing those magical little moments we took for granted before, like the boys just running through the back door after school and jumping onto the couch. They can’t race downstairs to the basement playroom, nor can they go play soccer anymore in the narrow, grassy backyard. The aspects of the home that we loved when we bought it shortly before the shooting - the “charming & full of character” features that come with an almost 100-year-old home -- now betray us … narrow halls and doorways, steep stairs, no first-floor master bedroom or full bath, a narrow backyard, a galley-style kitchen, etc. Our home simply cannot meet the needs we now have – a constant reminder of the staggering changes in our lives.\n\nThis home is filled with special, now sacred, memories for me. It was the last home Cooper walked in, the backyard was the last place the boys practiced soccer, the basement playroom is filled with memories of the boys playing, having sleepovers, the memories of baking cookies in the kitchen, walking to the lake and to downtown. This home has been filled with so much love and joy.\n\nSomething as simple as holiday cooking and baking with the boys is fraught with constant reminders of what Cooper CAN’T do. What was a familiar, fun and comforting experience can bring tears. The kitchen isn’t accessible, and it makes it very hard – if not impossible – for Cooper to engage in cooking and baking (or even just getting his own snacks) the way he did before. The counter-top heights and cupboards aren’t friendly to him; the galley-style kitchen is hard for a wheelchair to maneuver through -- things that “before” were not even on the radar now require all sorts of intentional planning, moving, preparing, organizing, adjusting. Home should always be the place you feel most comfortable in, where you are able to relax and enjoy family. Home should not be hard; should not be a place filled with obstacles and barriers.\n\nAnd I can’t even talk about the financials around a fully accessible home, accessible vehicles, constant medical bills, adaptive equipment, and much, much more.\n\nI am tired. Tired of crying, tired of being sad, tired of picking up pieces and agonizing over decisions we should never be making. I am tired of looking at pictures of a family that no longer exists, tired of watching the news every day and seeing how violence continues to plague our country and world; destroying families and children like mine, tired of wasting countless hours fighting – begging – insurance companies to cover what my children need, tired of making countless pleas seeking access to medical trials that Cooper needs and deserves as they may be his best chance to regain any ambulation and being rejected – soundly – because he is a minor. I am tired of the PTSD that follows you everywhere like a shadow and I am tired of our loss of spontaneity. I miss being able to just call the boys into the kitchen to cook with me, I miss naturally responding to an unseasonably warm day with a quick walk to the lake, or going for a picnic and letting the boys play at the park, or deciding at the last minute to go catch one of the major sports teams play because they are in town. Now, we need to check for availability of what are always a very limited number of handicap accessible seats at major arenas, or we need to ensure handicap accessible parking options. And most parks are not fully accessible and do not have handicap accessible playground equipment.\n\nOn the brighter side, sports continue to be a big part of Cooper’s fight to recover. He has started to play hockey and he LOVES it! It has been a blessing to see Cooper find a team sport that has given him this sense of competition, athleticism and most importantly, community. I dare to say there isn’t a sport Cooper wouldn’t enjoy; he is such a natural athlete. He misses soccer every day. It was his first true love. He is a little boy who loves being on a team so much! For as athletic as he is, he loves cheering his teammates on as much as he loves playing any sport. He is the consummate team player. He has been so happy playing hockey; just the practices thrill him…it reminds me of how Cooper was with soccer -- as excited to go to practice as he was to go to a game. It brings tears to my eyes as I type this, thinking about the smile on his face and the excitement in his voice when he talks about his team and about sport in general. I see real joy in him again, and not with an asterisk. I see Cooper at his very happiest…filled with love for his team, love for his sport, and I see the spark in him as he pushes himself physically to become the best sled hockey player he can possibly be. I have missed seeing Cooper happy like that, getting to be a child again.\n\nLuke is adamant about going to Cooper’s practices, even after a long day of school and his own appointments. He wants to – no, needs to be there, to cheer him, to see for himself that Cooper is ok.\n\nWe are also seeking opportunities for Cooper to learn adaptive ski and snowboard—with Luke---now that winter is almost here. They are so excited whenever there is a chance for them to do a sport together. We also are excited to find opportunities for Cooper to play wheelchair basketball; he loves watching the Chicago Bulls and Milwaukee Bucks play, and we are working to find the right wheelchair basketball team for him to join.\n\nLuke continues to love to draw. He finds such refuge in art, like I do in music, I guess. I know that when he is at his desk, drawing, he feels settled. We are committed to trying to find Luke as many opportunities as possible to experience and explore art; he is interested in all mediums and continues to be excited about any chance he can get to engage in “doing art”. He also loves all things related to plants; he is a natural botanist! He is so fascinated by plant types, crossbreeding, and growing plants. I wish I had a greenhouse for him to spend his days in so he could care for his plants and have a light-filled space to draw.\n\nThis Thanksgiving, the boys joined their youngest sisters in the Highland Park Turkey Trot. I am so proud of this. This felt like a big step in “taking back” what Evil stole from us. PTSD is hell; there is no other way I can describe it. The physical and emotional toll it takes on you is just awful – including feeling like control of all aspects of your life has been stripped from you. The damage Evil did to my sweet little boys is so much more than just physical. The Turkey Trot was about taking control back. They accomplished more than racing three miles, Luke running beside Cooper on his hand cycle. This was about facing their fears and finishing the race, despite scary-large crowds, abrupt and loud sounds, huge amounts of unpredictability, being willing to expose themselves to something new and unknown. Those medals at the end didn’t represent what they had just finished, they represented surviving.\n\nAs I think about gift-giving this season, what Cooper really wants, I cannot give him. I cannot fix this spinal cord injury and give him back his ability to walk. What Luke really wants, a sense of true peace, and for Cooper to walk again, I do not know how to give him. I can only tell them that I want those things, too, with all my heart. I would do literally anything for Cooper and Luke to have some respite from their suffering. I know that there are days they are tired, too. And frustrated. And just plain ‘ol sad. They are just little boys and they do not deserve this burden, this suffering. The impact of the mass shooting lives with us every single second of our lives.\n\nI want to wish you all a very happy, healthy and blessed holiday season. Whatever it is that you may be surviving, please know that I wish you strength and courage on your journey. When you face obstacles, my wish for you is that you remember that you are not alone in your efforts to overcome them. I have learned so much this past year and half, lessons I wish I had not had to learn in this way. Yet, I am immensely grateful for the lessons I have learned; including how the world is filled with wonderful, amazing people. That isn’t just flowery language; it is truth. When we are willing to take a scary step forward and open ourselves and our hearts to others, I have come to learn that you become open to seeing the goodness that is everywhere; people truly are incredible, caring and kind. I have learned first-hand that love is so much stronger than hate; the Light is so much brighter than the blackness of the Dark. I head into these holidays believing our best days are still ahead: my family’s best days, our country’s best days…the best days for all of us. I believe in the power of hope. I believe in Cooper and Luke. I believe in this family. I believe – I know it like truth - that one day, somehow, someway, Cooper will walk again.\n\nAll of you have been a blessing in my life. Thank you for your continued love, prayers, support, and generous donations. I cannot possibly put into words how much all of your kindness means to me. The love and care you all give to me and my family is what has allowed us to keep on going on this journey. I am so grateful to all of you for being so dedicated to ensuring that my boys and my family can heal. I am sending you all my best wishes and love this holiday season.\n\nWith Lots of Love and Appreciation,\n\nKeely"
