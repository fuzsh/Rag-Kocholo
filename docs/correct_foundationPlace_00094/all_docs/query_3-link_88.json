        "text": "STARability Foundation is proud to announce that its strong financial health and ongoing accountability and transparency have earned an 83/100 rating from Charity Navigator’s Encompass Rating System. This score designates STARability as an official “Give with Confidence” charity, indicating that the organization is using its donations effectively based on Charity Navigator’s criteria. Charity Navigator is America’s largest and most-used independent charity evaluator.\n\nThe Encompass Rating System is a comprehensive evaluation tool that analyzes nonprofit performance based on four key indicators, referred to as beacons. Currently, nonprofits can earn scores for the Finance & Accountability, Impact & Results, and Culture & Community beacons.\n\n“We are proud of this new rating,” says STARability’s CEO, Karen Govern. “We take seriously being good and responsible stewards of donors’ investment in our mission. Whether we’re reporting on our financials or our programs’ impact, our goal is to always be transparent with donors, families and our community of supporters and advocates.”\n\nThe Encompass Rating System enables Charity Navigator to increase the number of nonprofits it evaluates, growing from 9,000 to more than 160,000 nonprofits evaluated. To be more inclusive of smaller and more recently established nonprofits, the system uses a combination of automated methods and technology-supported manual research and analysis to provide donors and nonprofits with four clearly visualized indicators of organizational effectiveness."
