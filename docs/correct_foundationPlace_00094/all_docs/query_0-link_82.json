        "text": "A Mount Education\n\nAt the Mount, where the college president is often on a first-name basis with many of the students, you will be treated like a big fish in a small pond. Quality of experience is emphasized over quantity of faces in the crowd. While you won’t find massive homecoming ceremonies or elaborate pledge weeks, that doesn’t mean community college life is lacking in excitement. What you will find are intramural sports, student organizations, events, and government, just like any other school. Convenient class schedules are our specialty—including full semester, accelerated 7-week courses, day, evening, and online options.\n\nDegree or Certificate? An associate degree prepares you for a career or to transfer to another college or university. As a full-time student, you may complete your required courses in as little as two years, or choose to attend part-time and complete your associate degree at a pace more convenient for you. Certificates are ideal for quickly acquiring training to launch a career, strengthen current skills, or pursue an interest. You can also “ladder” your skills by earning your certificate first, which can take as little as one year to complete, then continuing to earn your degree while working in your chosen field.\n\nWe’re Affordable. In an economy where every dollar counts, the Mount’s cost of attendance is the exception to the sticker-shock of tuition prevalent today. A Mount education not only costs a fraction of what students pay at private institutions, but it beats public universities, too! Mount Wachusett Community College offers one of the lowest tuitions of any college or university in New England—$6,700 a year—and more than $325,000 in scholarships awarded through the MWCC Foundation annually. Our low tuition, combined with comprehensive financial aid opportunities, make the Mount education affordable to all. See if you’re eligible for FREE college with MassReconnect!"
