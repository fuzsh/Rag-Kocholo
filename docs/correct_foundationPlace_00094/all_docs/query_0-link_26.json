        "text": "Antony Pearson, MD, Chief Medical Officer at Longmont United Hospital, has served Longmont and the northern Colorado region for more than 25 years. He joined the LUH team in June 2020 and brings a breadth of experience as a practicing physician and as a leader.\n\nPrior to CommonSpirit Health, Dr. Pearson was a hospitalist at Mckee Medical Center, serving as the Regional Hospitalist Director from 2018-2019 and was the Chief of Staff 2017-2019. In addition to the leadership role at Mckee Medical Center, Dr. Pearson has been part of numerous oversight and leadership boards and committees throughout his career. He was a member of the Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee, Peer Review Committee, and Chairman of the Internal Medicine Department at Mckee.\n\nDr. Pearson earned his medical degree at the University of Minnesota and did his residency at Baylor College of Medicine. He came to Longmont upon completion of his residency and practiced internal medicine from 1995-2007. From 2002-2007, Dr. Pearson was the Chairman of the Medicine Department and Director of the TCU at Longmont United Hospital.\n\nAlison Bruckner, Chief Nursing Officer/Chief Operating Officer, is on a mission to create an environment of well-being for associates and patients. Ali has over 25 years of experience as a critical care nurse, PICU and NICU nurse, house supervisor, Director of Emergency Services, COO, and CNO.\n\nBefore joining the CommonSpirit Health team, Ali most recently worked with Mercy One in Des Moines, Iowa, as the Market Director of Nursing: Acute Care and Emergency. There, she provided administrative oversight of 10 Acute Care Departments and three Emergency Departments, including quality, safety, finance, and engagement oversight for all departments.\n\nAli has a Bachelor of Science and Nursing from Clarkson College in Omaha, NE, a Master of Business Administration from the University of Nebraska, and a Doctorate of Nursing from Aspen University in Denver.\n\nHal is the Principal at Elevate2Lead which is a progressive leadership coaching experience that combines dynamic leadership coaching with strategic business consultation and management of the self to create heightened personal and organizational success. He has first-hand experience with mergers and navigating the subsequent mission and cultural challenges with clarity. Hal is also the Founder/Board Chair of Pearl, a 501(c)(3) that provides hope and stability to single-parent families. Hal received his BSEE from the University of Colorado, with graduate studies at the University of California, Irvine.\n\nHal and his wife live in Longmont and have three children and nine grandchildren.\n\nMeredith has been a member of the LUH Board of Directors since July 2020. She is a native of Longmont and was born and raised in the community. She graduated from Colorado State University with a degree in health and exercise science. Subsequently, she attended Benedictine College in Lisle, IL, where she completed her master’s in public health with an emphasis in community education. Upon completing her advanced degree, she moved to Virginia, where her husband completed his surgical residency in the U.S. Navy while she focused on raising their two daughters. Upon completing his training, they moved to Okinawa, Japan, where Meredith was involved with American Welfare and Woman’s Association, a non-profit focused on positively impacting the Okinawan community.\n\nUpon returning to the United States, she continued to be active in the community and their children’s school. In 2016, she returned to her hometown of Longmont. She became active in A Woman’s Work, a local non-profit whose mission is to be a timely fund for local women, bridging the gap from need to financial stability. She currently serves on the Executive Board and has been responsible for organizing many events in the local area. In addition to her extensive volunteer work, she works part-time as a kindergarten paraprofessional at Blue Mountain Elementary school. Meredith enjoys spending time with her husband and two daughters in her free time. She enjoys all the recreation that Colorado offers and spends as much time as possible either boating or in the mountains.\n\nDr. Rush has been an Emergency Physician at LUH for the last 12 years. He began his medical career in the late 90s as a technician in the ER and had the opportunity to learn the value of every member of the medical team throughout two decades of experience. Dr. Rush became the Medical Staff President in January 2020, just as COVID was being identified as a serious threat. He is constantly impressed with the resilience of hospital providers — nurses, technicians, doctors, and all the ancillary services — as the struggles and fears of this last year and a half have affected everyone. Dr. Rush’s mission is to foster an environment where effective teams can provide excellent patient care. In doing this, he wants to ensure LUH is the best location to get medical services for the citizens of Longmont and its surrounding communities.\n\nDavid Donahue, DO, FACS, believes the best approach to care starts by building a trusting relationship between the provider and patient. Dr. Donahue recognizes that surgery may be a frightening experience for some. That is why he ensures that his patients are fully informed about their surgical conditions and fully understand their options, including non-operative options when available.\n\nDr. Donahue manages routine and complicated general surgery conditions, has a strong interest in minimally invasive surgical procedures and is one of the leading robotic general surgeons in the area. He leverages this advanced technology in a vast majority of his practice, including hernia surgery, gallbladder, and biliary surgeries. He also incorporates robotic technology into surgeries that involve the small intestine, stomach, and colon for both cancer and benign conditions with improved outcomes and faster recovery.\n\nDr. Donahue received his bachelor of arts in molecular, cellular, and developmental biology from the University of Colorado in Boulder. He earned his medical degree from the Chicago College of Osteopathic Medicine in Downers Grove, IL. Dr. Donahue traveled to Portsmouth, VA, and completed his residency training at the Naval Medical Center Portsmouth. After completing his residency, he was an active-duty Navy surgeon for four years, including a combat deployment to Afghanistan. He is currently obtaining his master's in business administration from the University of Northern Colorado in Greeley, CO.\n\nDr. Donahue enjoys spending time with his family and enjoying all that Colorado offers. He likes skiing in the winter and boating and hiking in the summer. Dr. Donahue also enjoys traveling whenever possible.\n\nVolunteer opportunities are subject to change:\n\nGift Shop\n\nTAILS: Therapy Dog program\n\nLAUNCH\n\nCaring Clowns\n\nHand Arts of sewing or knitting items (at home)\n\nPharmacy\n\nPatient Ambassador\n\nEmergency Room Volunteer\n\nDay Surgery\n\nEntertainment Cart\n\nBirthplace\n\nIntensive Care Unit (ICU)\n\nMain Welcome Desk\n\nSurgery Waiting Room\n\nRegistration Desks\n\nVolunteer Office\n\nMessenger Service\n\nSpecial Projects\n\nTherapy Dogs: TAILS Program\n\nThank you for your interest in the Longmont United Hospital (LUH) therapy dog program. TAILS (Therapy Animals In Loving Service) has been delivering smiles to patients, visitors, and staff since 2002. We currently have more than 35 teams.\n\nTherapy dogs must be calm, obedient, and not easily distracted. They must love meeting many kinds of people. They should know basic commands, walk calmly on a loose lead, and be easily managed by their handlers in varied settings. For our program, dogs must be at least 2 years old; handlers must be at least 18 years old or at least 14 years old and accompanied by a parent.\n\nTAILS handlers are hospital volunteers. All volunteers must attend the hospital’s orientation program, complete a background check, be tested for TB and get a flu shot each year. LUH is a drug-free and tobacco-free workplace.\n\nAll therapy dog teams MUST be registered with a national therapy dog registration association. Registration provides liability insurance when you do volunteer work with your dog. Recognized registries for our programs include:\n\nAlliance of Therapy Dogs (ATD)\n\nPet Partners\n\nNot all dogs are suited for this kind of work. Nor are all handlers. Before contacting us, we strongly recommend that you read “Dog Assisted Therapy: Is Your Dog a Good Fit?” It is an excellent article by Patricia McConnell, PhD. It is available online.\n\nFor more information, contact Longmont's Volunteer Office and speak to a TAILS volunteer. The TAILS volunteer will provide information about the program and will ask for your participation information to apply for the program. Please complete the appropriate adult volunteer application to participate as a volunteer.\n\nAll visitors of patients at our hospital enjoy equal visitation privileges consistent with patient preferences and subject to the facility’s clinical restrictions. Visitor policy may be subject to change. Please adhere to any adjustments to permitted visitors, as posted in our facility.\n\nWhile there are no set visiting hours, patients that desire/need more rest are encouraged to limit the number of visitors and specify visiting times that you prefer. Patients can designate specific visitors, including, but not limited to, a spouse, domestic partner, or a friend. You may also withdraw or deny your consent at any time. Our care teams can make arrangements for visitors to stay overnight if desired. If you have a special need, please let us know.\n\nAt 6 pm, seven days a week, the main lobby entrance will be locked. After 6 pm, enter the hospital through the emergency department walk-in entrance.\n\nThere may be times when visitors are asked to leave to better meet the needs of our patients."
