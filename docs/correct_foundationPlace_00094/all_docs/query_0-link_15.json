Partnering with Hawaii Fire Fighters Association, IAFF Local 1463, ensures those residents and firefighters get and feel support from all of us in California.”\n\nThe California Fire Foundation’s wide variety of programs, from immediate assistance to long-term recovery, supports vital needs of those affected by natural disaster while being committed to the mission of providing emotional and financial assistance to families of fallen firefighters, firefighters, and the communities they protect across the state.\n\nFor more information on California Fire Foundation’s Maui Wildfire Relief Fund and how to support the program, visit https://www.cafirefoundation.org/maui-wildfire-relief."
