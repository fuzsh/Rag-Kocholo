        "text": "We carry out our work with a deep commitment to accountability and transparency.\n\nAccountable and Transparent\n\nWe want you and every member of the public to know as much as possible about how The Nature Conservancy operates and how carefully and effectively we use your donations.\n\nAs a leading global charity, we hold ourselves accountable to our members, the public and all creatures that have a stake in the preservation of the world’s natural resources. And we seek to make use of every dollar donated with careful attention to effectiveness and efficiency.\n\nOur strong performance is reflected in the fact that The Nature Conservancy is highly rated by charity watchdog organizations.\n\nEfficient and Effective\n\nThe Nature Conservancy is one of the most effective and efficient environmental organizations in the world.\n\nBuilding on nearly six decades of experience, we've protected more than 119 million acres of land and 5,000 river miles—and we operate more than 100 marine conservation projects globally.\n\nWe are able to accomplish so much because we make careful use of our resources, maximizing the funding that goes toward our science-driven program work. Our program efficiencies meets standards set by both Charity Navigator and the Better Business Bureau Wise Giving Alliance, meaning you can be confident that any investment in The Nature Conservancy will be put to good use.\n\nIntegrity Beyond Reproach\n\nAt The Nature Conservancy, we operate with Integrity Beyond Reproach in all of our activities around the world. We will meet the highest ethical and professional standards in all of our organizational endeavors and, in doing so, we hold ourselves accountable to our mission and to the public.\n\nWe commit to:\n\nOperate and communicate with honesty and transparency at all times\n\nHold ourselves accountable to our mission, our teams, our donors, members and partners, and to the many communities we serve\n\nEarn trust by engaging thoughtfully with peers and partners, building relationships, being competent, and following through on all of our commitments\n\nRespect for People, Communities and Cultures\n\nEnduring conservation success depends on the active involvement of people and partners whose lives and livelihoods are linked to the natural systems we seek to conserve. We respect the needs, values and traditions of local communities and cultures, and we forge relationships based on mutual benefit and trust.\n\nDemonstrate respect by committing to local, on the ground involvement with people, communities and cultures, and with awareness and sensitivity to their economic realities\n\nTreat our partners and colleagues with fairness and honesty\n\nWork collaboratively with all sectors of society, including indigenous people, to develop practical conservation solutions.\n\nCommitment to Diversity\n\nWe recognize that conservation is best advanced by the leadership and contributions of people of widely diverse backgrounds, experiences and identities. We will recruit and develop staff to create a diverse, inclusive and equitable organization that reflects our global character. We will:\n\nLeverage our differences to be more effective in achieving our mission\n\nRespect and learn from our variety of experiences and ways of thinking\n\nCreate a day to day workplace climate that welcomes and encourages each of us, valuing the contributions of all\n\nStrengthen the diversity of our workforce, trustees, and board.\n\nOne Conservancy\n\nOur strength and vitality lies in being one organization working together in local places and across borders to achieve our global mission. We value the collective and collaborative efforts that are so essential to our success. We:\n\nWork across all of our operations to implement and support the right strategies, at the right scales, and at the right places always with the greater good of our mission in mind\n\nAct with continuity of purpose in everything we do, from the focus of our conservation efforts to the allocation of our resources\n\nCelebrate individual, team and project success as the success of all who work for TNC\n\nTangible, Lasting Results\n\nWe use the best available science, a creative spirit, and a non-confrontational approach to craft innovative solutions to complex conservation problems at scales that matter and in ways that will endure. We:\n\nDevelop, analyze and use the best available conservation science and a science-based rigor to set priorities, make decisions, take action, and measure results\n\nUse a creative spirit and original thought in the pursuit of excellence\n\nConduct our business in an environmentally sensitive manner\n\nThese values shape who we are as an organization and how we conduct ourselves as individuals. They inspire us to do the right thing and to do right by one another. Our values are the foundation for our Code of Conduct.\n\nTNC Code of Conduct: People and Nature Thrive When We…\n\nThe TNC Code of Conduct provides the principles and expectations to guide staff, Board members, Trustees/Advisors, volunteers, and third-parties in the course of their work for TNC. One of those expectations is that TNC staff and others acting on our behalf will comply with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations in each country, state, or locality where TNC operates. Where TNC’s Code or policies are more protective than the laws and customs in certain countries, TNC staff and others acting on our behalf will be held to the higher standards set forth in our Code.\n\nOur Code is also an interactive field guide for our staff that provides access to additional resources to help them make sound ethical and legal decisions. Staff and others who violate our Code will face consequences.\n\nTNC maintains policies and procedures that support our Code of Conduct and provide more detail and direction for staff to follow to achieve TNC’s mission in accordance with high ethical and legal standards. For example, TNC maintains policies and procedures on Conflicts of Interest; Lobbying Limitations; Participation in Candidate Elections; Corporate Engagement; Reporting Suspected Violations of Law or Policy; Confidential Information; Equal Employment Opportunity, Affirmative Action, and Diversity; Workplace Conduct, Harassment Prevention and Reporting; Privacy and Personal Data Protection; and Records Management.\n\nTNC Helpline: Ask a Question or Report a Concern\n\nStaff and third parties may contact the Ethics & Compliance team anytime to submit a question or concern at our online Helpline. The TNC Helpline is available online or by phone 24/7/365 in a variety of languages. In the US, you can call 833-426-1404, or text 571-458-1739. Our Helpline page has phone numbers for international calling. Concerns may be submitted anonymously where permitted by law.\n\nTNC takes all concerns seriously and when misconduct is found, consistent disciplinary action and remedial measures are taken across the organization and at all staff levels. At TNC, we are all responsible for speaking up if something does not feel right or if we have concerns about ethical misconduct. We know it takes courage to speak up. TNC will not tolerate retaliation against individuals who ask questions or raise concerns about potential misconduct in good faith.\n\nEthics & Compliance Program\n\nTNC’s Ethics & Compliance Program is designed to promote and foster: 1) a culture of integrity and ethical-decision making aligned with TNC’s Values; 2) compliance with TNC’s Code of Conduct, policies, procedures and applicable laws; and 3) appropriate risk assessment, due diligence and monitoring to detect, deter and prevent misconduct and unethical behavior. The TNC Ethics & Compliance Office was established by the Board of Directors in 2012.\n\nIn addition to our Code and Helpline, our Ethics & Compliance Program includes the following:\n\nRegular assessment of risks through inputs from Helpline reports, Internal Audit, Legal and management.\n\nAnnual Integrity Awareness training for all staff.\n\nRoutine Code of Conduct awareness for the Board of Directors, Trustees and Advisors.\n\nTargeted awareness and training for staff to mitigate key risks.\n\nConflicts of Interest Committee.\n\nFair and impartial investigations of allegations of wrongdoing.\n\nPrivacy program.\n\nRegular programmatic maturity assessments of our Ethics & Compliance and Privacy programs.\n\nLeadership and Oversight\n\nThe Ethics and Compliance Office is led by our Chief Ethics, Compliance & Privacy Officer who reports to our General Counsel and to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. The Audit Committee has oversight responsibility for the Ethics & Compliance Program and the Chief Ethics, Compliance & Privacy Officer provides a report quarterly to the Audit Committee and annually to the Board of Directors."
