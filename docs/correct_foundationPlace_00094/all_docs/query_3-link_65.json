        "text": "Financial Assistance Policy\n\nCoxHealth wants to help patients who do not have health insurance or who need help paying their hospital bills. As a nonprofit health care organization, CoxHealth cares about our patients and the communities we serve through better health and better health care.\n\nOur staff can help you with the following:\n\nApply for health insurance through the Marketplace\n\nApply for Medicaid assistance or Disability\n\nDetermine if you qualify for Financial Assistance from CoxHealth\n\nCoxHealth Financial Assistance\n\nFirst and foremost, your financial circumstances will not affect your care. All patients are treated with respect and fairness. Patients who meet certain income guidelines may qualify for CoxHealth Financial Assistance, including reduced hospital charges and payment plans.\n\nSubject to Schedule 1, patients who are eligible for Financial Assistance will be billed not more than the amounts generally billed to individuals who have insurance covering such care. Information regarding amounts generally billed and its calculation is available on Schedule 1, by speaking with a Financial Navigator or by calling the numbers below.\n\nFinancial Assistance approval will be in effect for 6 months from the date of approval. Exceptions to the Financial Assistance qualification criteria will be considered on an individual basis.\n\nMedical Qualifications for Financial Assistance\n\nCoxHealth will provide, without exception, care for emergency medical conditions to all patients seeking such care, regardless of ability to pay or to qualify for Financial Assistance, in accordance with the requirements of the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA).\n\nFinancial Assistance is available only for emergency and medically necessary services. It does not apply to elective procedures such as cosmetic surgery. It also does not apply to the portion of your services that have been paid for by a third party such as an insurance company or government program.\n\nIncome Guidelines for Financial Assistance\n\nThe amount of Financial Assistance you receive is based on Federal Poverty Level information set by the U.S. government each year. A Financial Assistance Income and Discount Schedule that shows these income levels is available on Schedule 2. In addition to your income, the discount will also take into account the size of your family.\n\nA list of providers who are included in this Policy is available on Schedule 3. Other services which are separately billed by other providers, such as independent physicians, are not eligible under CoxHealth’s Financial Assistance Policy. For a full listing of these providers, please see Schedule 4. These lists are also available by using the information below.\n\nApplying for Financial Assistance\n\nYou may apply for Financial Assistance at any time – before, during or after your care, up to 240 days after your initial bill. We will send information with your bill about how to apply for assistance. An application is also available on Schedule 5, upon request at CoxHealth facilities, including, but not limited to, emergency rooms and admissions areas, or by calling the numbers below and requesting a copy. The application requires proof of income such as an income tax return or paycheck stub. Examples of documents that may be used as proof of income can be found on the application form.\n\nPatients who are uninsured or eligible/enrolled in Medicaid automatically qualify for Financial Assistance for emergency and medically necessary hospital services that are not covered by Medicaid. Patients may also be approved for additional Financial Assistance based on the patient’s financial and/or socioeconomic position. Eligibility for this type of assistance does not automatically qualify the patient for assistance on future accounts.\n\nCompleted applications may be mailed to:\n\nCox North Hospital\n\nAttn: Financial Navigators\n\n1423 N Jefferson Avenue\n\nSpringfield, MO 65802\n\nCompleted applications may be faxed to:\n\n417-269-0518\n\nCompleted applications may be returned in person (not mailed) to any CoxHealth Outpatient registration or CoxHealth Emergency department in Springfield, Branson, Monett, Lamar, or at the following locations:\n\nCox South - West Pavilion\n\nFinancial Assistance Kiosk Desk\n\n3801 S National Avenue\n\nSpringfield, MO 65807\n\nCox North Hospital\n\nFinancial Assistance Office\n\n1423 N Jefferson Ave\n\nSpringfield, MO 65802\n\nGround Floor/Robberson Ave Entrance\n\nCox Medical Center Branson\n\nMedical Plaza One\n\n101 Skaggs Rd\n\nBranson, MO 65616\n\nBusiness Office/2nd Floor\n\nHow long will this take?\n\nYou should receive a response within 10 – 15 business days from the time your application is complete. To assure your application is processed as timely as possible, it is very important that we receive all required documents. See our application for more information.\n\nWhat do I do about my bill while I’m waiting?\n\nYou should establish a payment arrangement with CoxHealth during the application process.\n\nCollections\n\nWhen you are responsible for balances remaining after Financial Assistance approval, CoxHealth will work with you on payment arrangements. If these payments are not made and you do not contact us, we may use the services of a third-party agency to follow up with you on collection of the payment. Understand what this could mean for you by reviewing CoxHealth’s Collection Policy attached as Schedule 6.\n\nLearn More\n\nFor more information about CoxHealth’s Financial Assistance, to get an application, or to request to receive written notice or communication electronically you can visit one of the departments at any of the following locations or you may call one of the following numbers to speak with a Financial Navigator.
