        "text": "EHP will be closed on Thursday, July 4, 2024, in observance of Independence Day.\n\nWe will reopen on Monday, 7/8/24, with regular service hours.\n\nCan You Lend a Hand?\n\nEHP is in need of volunteers to help out in our Community Closet. No heavy work, just folding linens, hanging or displaying clothing, etc. We would love to have someone who could help us on a regular basis, but we would appreciate anyone who has some spare time and would like to help those in need.\n\nFor more information, please contact LaKesha Roberts at [email protected]\n\n​or call 650-323-7781 x1200.\n\nThank you!\n\nEHP Schedule\n\nEHP is open Monday through Thursday, 8 am - 6 pm.\n\nService hours: 9 am - 12 pm; 2:00 pm - 5 pm, Monday through Thursday\n\n(Limited staff available between 12 - 2 pm)\n\n**Ecumenical Hunger Program will provide $2M to local families\n\n​through expanded safety net programs**\n\n​​\n\nEast Palo Alto, CA – July 12, 2022: – The Ecumenical Hunger Program (EHP) is excited to announce the roll-out of expanded safety-net programs that will provide $2 million in direct assistance to our neighbors-in-need over a two-year period starting in July 2022.\n\nDue to the generosity of donors in the local community, EHP has received a surplus in funding. The organization has essentially been raising money faster than could be spent due to an incredible community response coupled with operational limitations directly related to COVID.\n\nWe realized that we were in an extremely fortunate position, but we also realized the challenges of scope as it related to programs and distribution of resources. Executive leadership and the Board of Directors responded accordingly and came together to assess the real time and rapidly changing needs of our local families and created a Safety-Net Resource Distribution Strategic Plan. We knew, that in order to create the greatest impact, and to truly move our clients toward a path of self-sufficiency, we could not simply throw money at existing programs. The result will be carefully designed programs with one-on-one case management, that will allow us to slow the revolving door of need.\n\nEHP will continue to provide its foundational programs which include direct food resources, clothing, household essentials, safety-net resources for youth and special holiday distributions, back-to-school distributions and other seasonal programs. But along with these programs, EHP will create customized and multifaceted strategies for individual clients in the form of in-kind resources, direct financial assistance and case management. Programs will include but will not be limited to housing, food resources for those with special needs, prescriptions, utilities, gas, vehicle repairs, critical home repairs, critical medical supplies not covered by insurance, essential school supplies for children including technology, and more.\n\nWe are humbled by the generosity of our donors and excited to see the tremendous growth of our programs, the widening of a critical safety-net, which we hope will create a lasting impact in the lives of our neighbors in need.\n\nAbout EHP\n\nFounded in 1975 and based in East Palo Alto, CA, EHP’s mission is to provide compassionate, dignified and practical assistance to families and individuals experiencing economic and personal hardship. We offer material help, support services, and advocacy for our neighbors in need, in a challenging and rapidly changing environment.\n\nAs a community, EHP works to meet the needs of its neighbors, both material and intangible. Our goal is to be more than just a social service agency that connects people to resources. We strive to build relationships that allow us to encourage, support and nourish individuals and families through difficult times. We fully understand the importance of providing life's essentials but aspire to a wider focus: the creation of a community of support that can provide hope to replace despair.​\n\n​\n\nMedia Contact:\n\nLesia Preston\n\n[email protected]\n\n(650) 323-7781\n\nEHP is selected as a 2022 California Nonprofit of the Year\n\n​\n\n​Chosen by Assemblymember Marc Berman of District 24, EHP was recognized for providing critical aid in East Palo Alto, Palo Alto, Menlo Park and the surrounding area this last year by helping people keep food on their tables during a long period of intense and ongoing need.\n\nEHP would like to thank Assemblymember Marc Berman and the California Association of Nonprofits. We are extremely honored to receive this distinction.\n\nNevida Celebrates her 80th Birthday\n\nEHP held a birthday celebration on 4/12/22 to honor Nevida Butler. To commemorate her 80th birthday, EHP is bringing back the opportunity to buy a memorial brick for the Nevida Butler Garden. Be a part of EHP's Future with a custom engraved brick for Nevida's Garden.\n\nThank you to everyone who wished Nevida well on her 80th birthday. She appreciated all the sentiments! We would like to share a proclamation from the City of East Palo Alto honoring Nevida Preston Butler for her service to our community.\n\nDear Friends and Partners,\n\nI am deeply saddened and devastated by what is taking place across this country. After the events that unfolded in 2020 and the pattern of discrimination and hate that was laid bare with the tragic death of George Floyd, I started to see a glimmer of hope on the horizon. The tragedy of George Floyd and countless others in the Black community became the catalyst for a movement that spread like wildfire, and it was inspiring to see communities of all colors come together to stand as allies in the fight against racism and bias in this country. I thought that we were on the brink of real and lasting change.\n\nBut with one step forward, it seems we’ve taken two steps back. The tragic shootings that took place in Atlanta, and the hundreds of incidents of racist rhetoric and violence against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders across the country is truly terrifying.\n\nMy mother and I came to this country as immigrants. As a young child, I struggled to learn the language, customs, and traditions of an unfamiliar land. I experienced racist taunts as a child, and misogyny, stereotyping and racism as an adult. But as much as I experienced in the last 4 and a half decades of my life, fear was never a part of the equation. And today, I can honestly say that I am genuinely afraid.\n\nBut we cannot let fear halt progress. The obstacles of hate, discrimination, racism, misogyny, and bias can only be removed if we stand in solidarity with one another. United we stand. Divided we fall.\n\nWe at EHP stand unified with our allies in the fight for racial equity. We stand with those in the Asian American and Pacific Islander communities in the Bay Area and across the country. We will continue to be an advocate for our Asian American and Pacific Islander neighbors, and we will never stop fighting for the American ideals of opportunity, democracy, liberty and equality for all.\n\nThoughtfully,\n\nMaleah​\n\nMr. Dinner Table Visits EHP\n\nATTENTION IN-KIND DONORS\n\nWhile EHP is happy to accept fresh food, clothing, working appliances (10 years or newer), furniture, household items and automobiles, we do ask that these items are all undamaged and in good usable condition as they are given directly to disadvantaged families for use in their home.
