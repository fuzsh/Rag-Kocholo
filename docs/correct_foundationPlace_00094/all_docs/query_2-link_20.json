        "text": "In 1991, two mothers faced every parent’s worst nightmare. Their children were diagnosed with cancer.\n\nMelissa Helms and Risa Tramel met at St. Joseph’s Children’s Hospital in Tampa, Florida while their infant daughters were undergoing cancer treatments. Through research advancements, both of their daughters survived and are now healthy young adults. However, through this experience, Melissa and Risa were inspired to continue fighting pediatric cancer. Together, they founded the National Pediatric Cancer Foundation, a non-profit organization whose mission is to collaborate with leading hospitals across the nation and funds clinical trials to find a faster cure for pediatric cancer.\n\nFor the first 15 years, the National Pediatric Cancer Foundation funded seed grants at St. Joseph’s Children’s Hospital and Moffitt Cancer Center in Tampa, Florida, All Children’s Research Institute in St. Petersburg, Florida, the University of Florida in Gainesville, Florida, and the University of Miami School of Medicine in Miami, Florida.\n\nThe National Pediatric Cancer Foundation (NPCF) formed the Sunshine Project™, an innovative collaboration with one goal: to bring together the nation’s top doctors and researchers to find a faster cure for pediatric cancer. Through the establishment of the Sunshine Project, the NPCF has developed a business model that capitalizes on the strengths of researchers from all different fields of science and streamlines the process to accelerate the development of new treatments.\n\nBest of all, the NPCF has proven that this collaborative model works. Since 2005, the NPCF has funded multiple clinical trials and translational studies valued at $37+ million. New compounds have been, and continue to be, tested and hold great promise for children who have not experienced positive results under the standard treatment protocol."
