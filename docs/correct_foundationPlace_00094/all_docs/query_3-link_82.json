An employee who retaliates against someone who has reported a violation in good faith is subject to discipline up to and including termination of employment.\n\nReporting Procedure\n\nThe Immokalee Foundation has an open door policy and suggests that employees share their questions, concerns, suggestions or complaints with their supervisor. If you are not comfortable speaking with your supervisor or you are not satisfied with your supervisor’s response, you are encouraged to speak with [insert here another title, such as Executive Director, or a board member, if the organization is very small and involving the board would be appropriate].

Any allegations that prove not to be substantiated and which prove to have been made maliciously or knowingly to be false will be viewed as a serious disciplinary offense.\n\nConfidentiality\n\nViolations or suspected violations may be submitted on a confidential basis by the complainant. Reports of violations or suspected violations will be kept confidential to the extent possible, consistent with the need to conduct an adequate investigation.\n\nHandling of Reported Violations\n\nThe Immokalee Foundation’s Human Resource’s Director will notify the person who submitted a complaint and acknowledge receipt of the reported violation or suspected violation.
