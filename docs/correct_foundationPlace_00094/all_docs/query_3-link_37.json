        "text": "The SUNY Oneonta Foundation is one of 159 large-sized organizations in the United States nominated for the 2024 Community Choice Awards by Charity Navigator, the nation's largest and most influential nonprofit evaluator. The SUNY Oneonta Foundation is the only university foundation in the country to receive a nomination.\n\nCharity Navigator announced the nominations on July 8, 2024. To qualify, organizations must have attained a prestigious four-star rating and earned all four Charity Navigator beacons. This recognition reflects the SUNY Oneonta Foundation's commitment to transparency, accountability and effectiveness in its charitable endeavors.\n\n“The SUNY Oneonta Foundation supports academic excellence, student success and equity,” said Paul Adamo, Vice President for University Advancement and Executive Director of the SUNY Oneonta Foundation. “It’s important that our alumni and donors trust that the university utilizes their donations in impactful ways and according to their wishes. The SUNY Oneonta Foundation has earned a four-star rating from Charity Navigator for 13 straight years, which demonstrates the foundation's financial health and commitment to accountability and transparency.”\n\nThe Community Choice Awards will have one winner in each size-based category: small, medium, large and super. The determination of the winners will be based on the total number of votes received. The winners will be officially announced on August 17, 2024.\n\nTo cast your vote and support the SUNY Oneonta Foundation in the Community Choice Awards, please visit the Charity Navigator website and follow the voting instructions.\n\nSupport for Real-World Learning Opportunities\n\nProviding students with affordable experiential learning opportunities is a priority at SUNY Oneonta, and charitable gifts to the SUNY Oneonta Foundation help make it happen.

Through continued charitable giving, more SUNY Oneonta students can afford a life-changing international study experience than ever before.\n\nDuring the 2023-24 academic year:\n\nThe Julia D.

Ferrante '77 Scholarship in Memory of Margaret A. Ferrante partially funded a Fashion and Textiles major who studied at the University of Florence in Italy.\n\nSupport for Student Success\n\nCharitable gifts to the SUNY Oneonta Foundation help students achieve their goals and stay on track toward graduation.\n\nMore than $2.5 million in student scholarships is awarded annually through the SUNY Oneonta Foundation.\n\nSince 2013, students who receive a scholarship through the SUNY Oneonta Foundation have a one-year retention rate of 91%, compared with 82% for our overall student population.\n\nSince 2013, students who receive a scholarship through the SUNY Oneonta Foundation have a six-year graduation rate of 86%, compared with 75% for the overall student population.\n\nCharitable gifts totaling over $1 million endowed the SUNY Oneonta Student Emergency Fund, ensuring that $50,000 in emergency support will be available each year to assist students facing unexpected financial challenges, including homelessness, medical bills and food insecurity.\n\nAbout Charity Navigator\n\nFounded in 2002, Charity Navigator is a 501(c)(3) organization that guides intelligent giving with the nation's largest, most comprehensive charity evaluation tool.
