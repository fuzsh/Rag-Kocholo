        "text": "After graduating from University of Colorado with a BA in Accounting, Lynne joined her family real estate development and management firm in 1980. Her original involvement was with the single family home building division of the business, building upwards of 200 homes per year. She later became president of 'Classic Management' – the company's property management division, and grew its portfolio of apartments from 800 to 1,200 units, while also overseeing the commercial and office building portfolio. She retired from the firm in 2000.\n\nLynne continues to be involved in real estate investing and served on the board of CT Realty, a California real estate investment company. She served as Co-Chair of the ALS Division of the Muscular Dystrophy Association from 2006 until \"Augie's Quest\" left the ranks of MDA and became part of ALS Therapy Development Institute in 2014.\n\nLynne is the Chair of Augie's Quest to Cure ALS. Along with her husband, Augie, she played a pivotal role in its success through her vision, leadership and focus on the bottom line where her accounting background has been key.\n\nLynne has been a dedicated member of the ALS TDI board since 2014, during which she served under the leadership of her late husband, Augie Nieto, who passed away from ALS in February 2023. In May 2023, Lynne Nieto was unanimously elected as Chair of the ALS TDI Board of Directors.\n\nLynne lives in Corona del Mar, California and has four adult, married children and eight grand children.\n\nThe Chairman and CEO of Cappello Global, LLC, a boutique global investment bank whose principals have conducted over $160 billion in transactions in over 50 countries, spanning across 50 years. Mr. Cappello has led several public and private companies and is or has been the lead independent Director of Virco Manufacturing Corporation VIRC (NASDAQ); The Cheesecake Factory CAKE (NASDAQ); Caldera Medical; lead independent director of the Agnew Company; the Nordic Group of Companies; Numedico Technologies (Australia); Open4Sale Technology; SureCount Surgical; and additionally is Chairman of the Board of Navidea Biopharmaceuticals, Inc. NAVB (NYSE).\n\nFormerly the only two-term Chairman of the International Board of YPO – Young President’s Organization; Trustee of the University of Southern California (USC); Trustee and Chair of the Investment Committee of City of Hope; Chairman of: Intelligent Energy, PLC (London Stock Exchange), a global technology leader in hydrogen fuel cells; Inter-Tel (NASDAQ); and Geothermal Resources Intl. (AMEX), as well as a former Director of: Cytrx (NASDAQ); Genius Products (NASDAQ); Koo Koo Roo, Inc. (NASDAQ); Arcus Data Security (NASDAQ); California Republic Bank (OTC); IrisGuard (London); and Nano Bank (OTC).\n\nAdditionally, Mr. Cappello is a lifetime member of the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) (Washington D.C., New York), as well as on the boards of RAND Corporation's Center for Middle East Public Policy (CMEPP), the University of Southern California Marshall School of Business and the ALS-TDI Foundation.\n\nMr. Cappello received a Bachelor of Science degree from the Marshall School of Business at USC in 1977 with honors, including recognition as an \"Order of the Palm\" scholar. He received an Honorary Doctorate of Humanities from Goodwin University in Stamford, Connecticut and has been inducted in the Order of Honorary Fellows at Marymount College in Palos Verdes, California.\n\nJennifer Gore Dwyer is the owner of St. George Marine. The family-run company was established in 1986 by Jenny and her husband Pat. After her beloved husband passed away from ALS in June 2013, Jenny became sole owner and president of St. George Marine, working with her children Sean and Brenna to continue to run and grow the family business. The company owns two vessels. The F/V Jennifer A fishes crab in Alaska's Bering Sea, and in summer works with its sister ship, the F/V Brenna A, purchasing salmon on behalf of seafood processors in various parts of Alaska.\n\nJenny and Pat built their company from the ground up, working together on Alaska's fishing grounds and becoming involved in fisheries politics. Together, they lobbied state and federal officials on issues related to the Alaska seafood industry. In 2005, when Pat was diagnosed with ALS, the partnership built to lobby government on fish issues became a partnership working to live with ALS.\n\nThrough that partnership, Jenny became a committed advocate for the ALS cause. She started out with her local ALS chapter, raising over $100,000 to benefit PALS in the Pacific Northwest area. Jenny's involvement expanded to the national level. She and her family worked extensively behind the scenes in Washington, D.C. to ensure passage of the ALS Registry, which was signed into law by President George W. Bush in 2008. At the same time, recognizing the need for innovative research funding and federal funding, Jenny became a vocal supporter of ALS TDI. She established the first National YFALS Corntoss Tournament in Seattle. Jenny solicited sponsors, donors and participants from the family's significant network in the region. In 2013 the Seattle Corntoss event raised $55,000 for ALS drug development programs at ALS TDI.\n\nOn a national level, Jenny has made several trips to Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C. on behalf of ALS TDI. Jenny and ALS TDI met with ranking members of both the U.S. House and Senate to bring attention to the need for increased federal support for ALS translational drug research. Jenny reached out on the national level for all families living with ALS, including those of the military, who are diagnosed with ALS at a rate twice that of other individuals. In February of 2013, Jenny's advocacy went to the White House. She wrote directly to President Obama outlining the dismal statistics and the lack of research funding for this insidious disease. Her letter was so compelling that it made its way to President Obama's desk, and the President sent a hand written note to her and Pat. The president said he would look for ways to support \"ALS specifically.\" Jenny is determined to continue reaching out to Washington, D.C. and the White House on behalf of ALS TDI, to ensure there is recognition and continued translational research funding for ALS, before more families are confronted with the life decisions that face all people with ALS.\n\nAndrew Niblock is the Director of Schoolwide Initiatives and the former Head of Lower School at the Greenwich Country Day School, Greenwich, CT. Prior to his current position he was the Director of Lower School at Hamden Hall Country Day School and spent eleven years as a teacher, coach and administrator at Isidore Newman School in New Orleans.\n\nIn July 2016 Andrew was diagnosed with ALS. In the time since, Andrew and his family have become more hopeful, not less. Andrew's life's work is education, and this is the lens through which he views ALS.\n\nThere has never been a more exciting time in ALS science. The creativity that comes with looking at problems from different angles, collaboratively, and with unprecedented advances in technology, gives justified cause for hope.The avalanche of ideas in the scientific world of this fight calls for commensurate creativity in the world of support.\n\nPaul Sallaberry is a software industry veteran with a career encompassing the build and operational management of Enterprise-class worldwide sales, marketing, technology and consultative services organizations.\n\nAs Executive Vice President of Worldwide Field Operations for VERITAS Software, Paul was responsible for defining strategy, managing operational activity driving revenue in excess of $1.65 billion, and achieving profit goals for the corporation's global multi-tier sales distribution and professional services operations.
