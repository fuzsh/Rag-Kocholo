        "text": "NMDP is focused on recruiting people ages 18 to 35 because medical research shows that younger donors are best for patients and provide the greatest chance for transplant success. Because of this, doctors prefer donors in the 18 to 35 age group.\n\nAge guidelines are not meant to discriminate. They are meant to protect the safety of the donor and provide the best possible outcome for the patient. The lower age limit is based on the legal age of consent. A guardian or parent is not able to sign a release or give consent because unrelated bone marrow donation is a voluntary procedure.\n\nThe upper age limit is based on both donor and patient considerations. There is a small increase in the risk of complications from donations in older donors. There is also a slightly increased risk of blood disorders in older people. In addition, studies have shown that patients who receive donated cells from younger donors have a better chance for long-term survival.\n\nYou are not able to join if you have an autoimmune illness that affects your whole body including:\n\nRheumatoid arthritis (RA)\n\nSystemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)\n\nFibromyalgia\n\nMultiple sclerosis\n\nSevere psoriasis\n\nSjogren’s syndrome\n\nAnkylosing spondylitis\n\nAddison's disease\n\nChronic fatigue syndrome\n\n*This list includes common autoimmune disorders, but is not a complete list of all disorders considered autoimmune.\n\nHowever, you ARE able to join if you have an autoimmune condition that affects one organ system that is mild and well-controlled or you are fully recovered, including:\n\nCeliac disease\n\nCrohn's disease\n\nGraves' disease\n\nGuillain-barre syndrome\n\nHashimoto's thyroiditis\n\nMild psoriasis\n\nMeniere's disease\n\nRaynaud's syndrome\n\nUlcerative colitis\n\nVitiligo\n\nIf you have had a significant brain injury or had surgery in the brain tissue — even if currently recovered and asymptomatic — you are not able to register. See Heart Disease/Stroke, if applicable.\n\nYou are also not able to register if you have experienced more than 6 concussions in your lifetime, symptoms from a concussion that lasted more than 1 month or a severe concussion where you were unconscious more than 1 hour.\n\nIf you have a history of pre-cancerous cells, you will be able to register to become a potential volunteer donor. You are able to register if you have any of the following, but did NOT require chemotherapy:\n\nCured, local skin cancer (basal cell or squamous cell)\n\nHealed melanoma in situ\n\nHealed cervical cancer in situ\n\nHealed breast cancer in situ\n\nHealed bladder cancer in situ\n\nNOTE: In situ cancer is diagnosed at a very early stage and is specifically called “in situ” or Stage 0.\n\nYou MAY register if you have had any other type of cancer (with the exception of blood cancer), if it meets ALL of the following criteria:\n\nMore than 5 years since diagnosis\n\nNo recurrence or metastases\n\nNo chemotherapy or radiation*\n\n*Localized bead radiation treatment for breast cancer or prostate cancer is acceptable. Radioactive iodine treatment for thyroid cancer is acceptable.\n\nIf you have a history of chemical dependency and/or mental health issues you may be allowed to register. In general, if you have completed chemical dependency treatment, have maintained sobriety for at least 12 months, are currently sober and you have no physical ailments that may put you at risk during donation, you are allowed to register.\n\nIf you have a condition such as attention deficit disorder (ADD), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), bipolar or manic-depressive disorder, or depression, you are able to register as long as the condition is well controlled and you are also medically stable.\n\nSerious mental health conditions such as schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder or delusional disorder will prevent you from registering to become a potential volunteer donor.\n\nIt is important that you are committed and able to follow through with the donation process. Guidelines used to evaluate your current chemical dependency/mental health status are meant to protect your safety and well-being and provide the best possible outcome for the patient.\n\nIf you have diabetes, a careful evaluation of your current health status will be necessary. In general, if your diabetes is well controlled by either diet or medications (other than insulin), you will be allowed to register. If you require insulin to treat diabetes or if you have diabetes-related serious health issues such as kidney, heart, nerve or eye disease, you will not be allowed to register. If you have questions regarding your diabetes, contact your local donor center or call 1 (800) MARROW2 (1-800-627-7692).\n\nIn general, if you have heart disease you cannot become a potential volunteer donor. This includes a past heart attack, any history of angioplasty, bypass surgery, heart valve replacement surgery or pacemakers. However, some heart conditions such as congenital defects surgically corrected in childhood, mitral valve prolapse (MVP) that is well controlled, or successful cardiac ablation will not prevent you from registering to become a donor. Your situation will be evaluated on an individual basis.\n\nIf you have history of a stroke, a transient ischemic attack (TIA), an intracranial hemorrhage (epidural, subdural, subarachnoid), or other significant brain injury or surgery in the brain tissue — even if currently recovered with no symptoms — you are not able to register.\n\nYou will be allowed to join the NMDP Registry if you have:\n\nReceived a vaccine to prevent hepatitis\n\nHistory of fully-recovered hepatitis A\n\nClose or intimate contact with someone with active hepatitis B or C in the past year\n\nPossible exposure to hepatitis B or C in the past year\n\nHistory of jaundice due to mononucleosis or cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection\n\nIf you have the following, you cannot join the registry:\n\nDiagnosed with hepatitis B or C\n\nBeen told you had a positive confirmatory test for hepatitis B or C\n\nBeen told you are a carrier of hepatitis B or C (also known as a “chronic” infection)\n\nHistory of hepatitis or yellow jaundice (after age 11) without a known cause\n\nIf you have questions regarding hepatitis and registration, contact us at 1 (800) MARROW2 (1-800-627-7692).\n\nMore information about hepatitis and how it is transmitted may be found at the Department of Health and Human Services Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nYou cannot register if you have serious or chronic kidney problems such as polycystic kidney disease or chronic glomerulonephritis. If you have had a kidney removed due to disease, you cannot register. However, if you donated a kidney to another person and are now fully recovered from that surgery, you are able to register. You are able to register if you have a history of kidney stones.\n\nEveryone, age 18-40, who is in good health, and willing to donate to any patient, is encouraged to join the NMDP Registry.\n\nPrescription hormone therapy does NOT exclude you from joining the registry. The specifics of everyone's health status will be discussed in detail with a medical professional at the time should you be called as a potential match for a patient.\n\nIf you have had surgery within the last 12 months when called as a match, you will be asked about the current status of your recovery and whether you are still seeing a physician for follow-up in regards to the surgery.\n\nIf you are pregnant you may register for the NMDP Registry. However, you are not able to serve as a donor until you are fully recovered from the delivery or cesarean section. Blood-forming cells cannot be collected at any time during pregnancy.\n\nIf you are currently pregnant or planning on becoming pregnant, you may want to consider donating your baby's umbilical cord blood after your baby is born. To see if this is an option at your hospital, see Where to donate cord blood."
