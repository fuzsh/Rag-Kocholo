        "text": "The Rheumatology Research Foundation Earns its 15th Consecutive Four-Star Rating from Charity Navigator\n\nAtlanta, Ga. – The Rheumatology Research Foundation is proud to announce that its strong financial health and ongoing accountability and transparency has earned its fifteenth consecutive Four-Star Rating from Charity Navigator. This rating designates the Rheumatology Research Foundation as an official “Give with Confidence” charity, indicating that our organization is using its donations effectively based on Charity Navigator’s criteria. Charity Navigator is America’s largest and most-utilized independent charity evaluator. Since 2001, the organization has been an unbiased and trusted source of information for more than 11 million donors annually.\n\nCharity Navigator analyzes nonprofit performance based on four key indicators, referred to as beacons. Currently, nonprofits can earn scores for the Impact & Results, Accountability & Finance, Culture & Community, and Leadership & Adaptability beacons.\n\n“We are delighted to provide the Rheumatology Research Foundation with third-party accreditation that validates their operational excellence,” said Michael Thatcher, President and CEO of Charity Navigator. “The Four-Star Rating is the highest possible rating an organization can achieve. We are eager to see the good work that the Rheumatology Research Foundation is able to accomplish in the years ahead.”\n\n“Our Four-Star Charity Navigator is further validation that our supporters can trust our commitment to good governance and financial health,” said Foundation executive director Rachel Myslinski, MBA. “We hope that it will introduce our work to new supporters who can help us to advance research and training to improve the health of patients living with rheumatic disease.”\n\n###"
