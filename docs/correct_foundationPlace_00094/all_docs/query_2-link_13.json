        "text": "Vice Chairman\n\nThomas F. Bennington, Jr., an attorney and partner with Lawrence, Kamin, Saunders & Uhlenhop, concentrates his practice in business sales and purchases, commercial real estate, business succession planning, and related wills and trusts.\n\nTom has served the public in both civic and charitable activities, and has served as a board member and executive committee member for United Way of Metropolitan Chicago, a board member and President for the Boy Scouts of America, Des Plaines Valley Council, board member for the Downers Grove Area Chamber of Commerce and Industry, and as committee chair for Boy Scout Troop 99 in Downers Grove.\n\nDuring Tom’s legal career, he has served many civic and charitable organizations, bringing his legal and political experience to positions that include commissioner, president, chair, board member, or volunteer. Tom served as a County Board Member for DuPage County, Illinois from 1998 – 2010 and as a Commissioner for the Forest Preserve District of DuPage County. In these roles, Tom made land acquisition, policy, personnel, and budgetary decisions for organizations that had combined budgets of over $600 million per year and over 2,000 employees. During Tom’s time on the Forest Preserve Commission, land acquisition was a priority made possible, in part, by the efforts of The Conservation Foundation. While serving on the DuPage County Board, Tom spearheaded the development and creation of the Southern DuPage Regional Trail, a 46 mile multi-use trail system which connects 11 communities across the southern half of DuPage County.\n\n“The mission of The Conservation Foundation is near and dear to my heart. I grew up downstate along the Illinois River and I&M Canal, where open space was taken for granted. After moving to the suburbs and commuting to Chicago on a daily basis, I felt disconnected from the benefits which open space and interaction with the environment provide. While on the Forest Preserve Commission of DuPage County and DuPage County Board, I was able to reconnect with my open space roots and help drive open space preservation, the development of multi-use trail systems and environmental awareness and education in DuPage County. During that time, I became familiar with The Conservation Foundation and became a ‘true believer’ in its work. I am honored to be part of The Conservation Foundation, its mission, and its past and future impact on northeastern Illinois and its residents.”\n\nTom is an avid outdoorsman, who spends his time with his 3 adult Eagle Scout sons and his wonderful and patient spouse, Tracy, camping, hiking, biking, kayaking, and fishing.\n\nSecretary\n\nCarole Koch, former chair of the Green Earth Institute Board of Directors, joined the Board of The Conservation Foundation when the two organizations merged in 2018. Carole, who lives in Naperville, began volunteering with Green Earth in 2003 and in addition to board duties, produced the weekly newsletter for the Community Supported Agriculture program for many years.\n\nCarole was the Director of Human Resources at the University of Illinois Hospital & Clinics, and then Chief HR Officer/Associate Hospital Director at the U of I Medical Center in Chicago. After retirement, she volunteered as a docent at the Robert R. McCormick Museum, Cantigny Park, in Wheaton, and has served on the boards of directors for the Naperville Chorus, as well as the Chicago Chapter of the State Universities Annuitants Association.\n\nCarole received a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Illinois at Chicago and is a native Chicagoan. “Even though I grew up and spent my career in the city, I learned at a very young age to cherish and care for nature, having had an organic vegetable garden and a micro forest in our urban backyard, and regularly going on outings to explore the vast Cook County Forest Preserves.”\n\nTrustee\n\nHaving grown up in and now residing in Naperville as an adult, Dr. Mimi Cowan has known of The Conservation Foundation for decades, but during her service to the Will County Board and as a Forest Preserve Commissioner (2018-2022) she became very connected to our mission.\n\nMimi currently spends her days serving as the Director of Government Affairs for The Field Museum of Natural History and has extensive experience in the environmental and political realms. “I love that The Conservation Foundation is a regional organization,” says Mimi. “We work best when we work together! I’m hoping I can add to The Conservation Foundation’s connections in Will County, and with my experience in politics and communications I’d love to be involved in any referenda campaigns that arise.”\n\nWhile life has circled back to where it began for Mimi and she is lending her time and expertise to causes close to her roots, she is a worldly soul! She holds a B.S. in Music and Communications from North Central College right here in Naperville, but her graduate work took her abroad where she earned a M.A. in Irish Studies at the National University of Ireland. She returned stateside to complete a PhD in American History at Boston College, and spent several years as a History Professor before launching her career in government and politics.\n\nThis regard for history and her love of nature combined draw Mimi particularly to the restored natural areas of our region. “Having served as a Forest Preserve Commissioner in Will County I’ve had an opportunity to learn first-hand how fortunate we are to have so many amazing natural spaces in Illinois,” Mimi reflected. “Two of my favorites in Naperville are Springbrook Prairie, managed by DuPage County Forest Preserve, and Vermont Cemetery, managed by Will County Forest Preserve. I love that we can go to places that look just like they did 200 years ago, right in the middle of Naperville.” Mimi is also very fond of her annual porch garden and loves picking tomatoes and other produce at our McDonald Farm.\n\nTrustee\n\nAlvin Gates is currently the IT Manager at Relativity in Chicago, helping to manage large volumes of data and keep client information secure. Alvin has held similar positions with several area corporations, including DeVry University, JP Morgan Chase & Co., Vitas Innovative Hospice Care, and Griffith Foods. He holds a B.S. in Technical Management from DeVry University. As an Information Technology professional, Alvin spends a fair amount of time behind a screen, but his appreciation for the natural world is perhaps magnified because of it. He first became acquainted with The Conservation Foundation through his neighbor and now fellow Trustee, Jeanette Press.\n\nAlvin is a familiar face at our McDonald Farm headquarters thanks to his volunteer service as our Bluebird Monitor at McDonald Farm the last couple of years. While he was working remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic, he found spending his lunch hour checking on the 20 or so bird boxes on the Bluebird Trail at McDonald Farm was a welcome respite from screen time and the isolation of his four walls. As a young boy, Alvin was a member of the World Wildlife Fund and the animals he read about in those magazines sparked aspirations of being a zoologist. His professional life took a different path, but he’s found glimpses of fulfilling that long ago dream through his work at McDonald Farm. “Fast forward to the present day,” says Alvin, “and I feel like I’ve recaptured that love of nature, a void that technology can’t fill. The world owes a lot to organizations like The Conservation Foundation, who make it a priority for things I take for granted, like preserving land and protecting rivers and streams. I’m excited that with my expertise and experience, I can help advance that mission for nature from a technological perspective.”\n\nOur Green Earth Harvest program is also of particular interest to Alvin, who is very passionate about nutrition and healthy, sustainably grown food. He is well known as a connoisseur of bourbon, enjoys Olympic weightlifting, reading, DJing, is honing a newfound interest in drone flying, and loves to bike and hike on both our local trails and when travelling. Alvin and his wife of 26 years are immensely proud of their adult son and daughter, both of whom live out of state.\n\nTrustee\n\nDave Gorman spent much of his childhood in south suburban Sauk Trail Woods searching for and bringing home plenty of frogs, snakes, turtles and wild onions. That and other early experiences instilled in him a lifelong passion for the outdoors. He has also paddled many of the navigable waters in Northeastern Illinois, and happily fills his canoe with trash each year during the DuPage River Sweep.\n\nDave is a civil engineer, working as the Assistant Director of Public Works for the Village of Lombard. He has led the DuPage River Salt Creek Workgroup as President since 2012, working closely with The Conservation Foundation’s staff to improve our local waterways. He previously worked in floodplain management, public water regulations, and dam safety for the Illinois DNR, aside other state agencies and the US Army Corps of Engineers. The first few years of his career was as a Peace Corps volunteer, building rural community infrastructure and leading other development programs in the Kingdom of Lesotho in Southern Africa.\n\nAs an endurance runner and biker, Dave greatly appreciates the mindfulness achievable in those activities. His project “Bikes for Lesotho” has sent over 6,000 bikes to orphans and others in poverty, and has been instrumental to develop a cycling culture there. He also serves as Board Secretary of Working Bikes, a nonprofit in Chicago that has grown since 1999 to annually collect and redistribute over 12,000 used bikes for people in need around Chicagoland and internationally.\n\nDave summarizes his environmental ethic in this way: “What we do today has an impact on at least the next seven generations. That’s a serious responsibility, and also a great opportunity. The Conservation Foundation is uniquely able to protect local open spaces for us and for them. Rolling up our collective sleeves and getting to work on that is extremely satisfying!”\n\nTrustee\n\nAs a Senior Landscape Architect at Wight & Company, Patty King has what she calls the privilege of thinking about nature all the time. She brings creativity, structure and a passion for sustainable design techniques to each project and specializes in creating outdoor spaces that offer an intimate connection with the natural environment, as can be seen in her past projects such as Maggie Daley park and the Oak Brook Park District’s McDonald’s Fields redesign. Patty was also named a Notable Woman in STEM by Crain’s Chicago Business this year!\n\nPatty spent her my youth in central Texas and upstate New York where she played in the woods, walked through streams, and enjoyed fields of bluebonnet flowers right across from her home. She has always been curious about nature and especially loves integrating natural systems and shapes into her work.\n\nPatty and her husband Tim have been members of The Conservation Foundation for upwards of 10 years, connecting first with McDonald Farm and our Green Earth Harvest program and then learned about the mission further from her colleague Lois Vitt Sale, who retired from Wight & Company within the past couple of years and serves on our Board of Trustees. “Lois shares my love for the outdoors and working at Wight & Company with her, she helped me understand the mission and how I could get involved,” Patty said. “I love what The Conservation Foundation does and that now I have the opportunity to help.”\n\nPatty and Tim have two teenage sons and live in Naperville. In addition to her dedication to family and her career, Patty is an avid quilter and an endurance athlete, having completed the Chicago Marathon and also climbed the equivalent of Mount Vinson, the highest peak in Antarctica at 16,150 feet, as part of an endurance event in 2021.\n\nTrustee\n\nJoe Mikan is a lifelong resident of Will County and a former Will County Executive and Forest Preserve Commissioner. He spearheaded an initiative to create a new comprehensive land use plan for Will County which received the Burnham award for creativity, and became familiar with The Conservation Foundation through their involvement in this process. Joe played a significant role in passing the 2005 successful open space referendum in Will County, co-chairing the campaign committee under the Foundation’s leadership.\n\nBoth his personal and professional lives have made Joe aware of the pressures on natural resources and the need to protect them, so it was an easy sell when he was approached to join The Conservation Foundation’s Board. “I’m the third generation of my family to live in Will County. I’ve seen the changes that uncontrolled growth brings to the area, and while I’m not against growth, I certainly know there are better ways to do it than some of the ways it is currently being done.”\n\nJoe brings a visionary yet practical perspective to the Board of Trustees. “I would like to see The Conservation Foundation continue the transition from a DuPage organization to a Northeastern Illinois regional organization,” says Joe. “I think the organization just gets stronger by spreading out and making more communities feel that they are part of the Foundation. That’s going to be easy to do as growth continues. These other communities will feel the need for the Foundation and the expertise the staff brings to them and I think it’s going to be exciting to be a part of all of that.”\n\nAn avid outdoorsman and golfer, Joe currently runs the family insurance business, which has been serving the community since 1921, and is also a farm owner. He has practiced the message he preaches by placing the streams and wetlands on his 160-acre Iowa farm into conservation programs. He is a graduate of North Central College in Naperville and he and his wife Lynn have raised their three sons in his hometown of Lockport.\n\nTrustee\n\nCurt Pascoe is a LEED-certified engineer and the Vice President of Real Estate Development at Ryan Companies, where he plays a leadership role in site selection, acquisition, due diligence, permitting, design and financing for his customers.\n\nLand is at the heart of Curt’s work life, and plays a major role in his personal life as well. Curt is an avid hiker and camper and is passionate about landscaping with native plants. He and his kids love to raise Monarch caterpillars in the summer. Whether he is in his back yard or a national park, he loves the way nature reminds him how much there is to learn around us and connects him to a feeling larger than himself.\n\nWhen Curt discovered The Conservation Foundation, he was looking for an organization focused on preservation of land locally in Illinois but that also offered “boots on the ground” opportunities for people to participate in preserving and restoring local nature. “As I learned more about the Foundation’s history and programs, I realized I already enjoyed using lands rescued by the Foundation in decades past,” recalled Curt. “I was impressed by the Foundation’s goal to connect people with nature in addition to preserving lands and waters. It is a unique combination and I want to help so future generations can benefit the way I have benefitted from past leaders.”\n\nTrustee\n\nJeanette Press joined the Board of Trustees of The Conservation Foundation in March 2018.\n\nJeanette is Vice President, Chief Accounting Officer for Lime, the world’s largest provider of shared electric vehicles.\n\nPrior to Lime, Jeanette served as the Chief Financial Officer and Principal Accounting Officer for CMC Materials, Inc., and prior to CMC, Jeanette served as Vice President, Controller and Principal Accounting Officer of Univar Solutions and USG Corporation. Jeanette joined USG from the audit practice at KPMG LLP, where she spent more than 13 years serving both public and private, multinational corporations.\n\nJeanette graduated from Loyola University with a degree in accounting and she is a licensed CPA. She is an independent board director for Broadwind Energy, a member of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and serves on the Loyola University Accounting Advisory Board.\n\n“I’m happy to be part of an organization whose goal is to save open spaces,” Jeanette said. “It’s where I love to be. It’s part of what we enjoy about living in the suburbs.”\n\nShe said she loves open space and feels it is an important area of pride for a community, and she hopes to get younger constituents involved in preserving land and to get them to know the mission of The Conservation Foundation. Jeanette feels there is wide reaching impact and immeasurable value in the Foundation’s mission to preserve land and restore rivers and streams since the benefit reaches everyone. She, her husband, Dave, and dog, Clive, live in Lisle.\n\nTrustee\n\nDaniel Wagner is senior vice president of government relations for The Inland Real Estate Group of Companies, Inc.
