        "text": "A selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy pop and jazz concerts in the New York metropolitan region this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended concert.\n\n* RICHARD BARONE, Cutting Room, 19 West 24th Street, Chelsea, (212) 691-1900. Is there a local musician more deserving of the moniker Man About Town than Richard Barone? Not only is this writer and singer of pop gems involved in the continuing tribute shows ''Loser's Lounge'' and ''The Beat Goes On,'' but he also produces records for half of New York, sits in with Gary Lucas's Gods and Monsters, has a fruitful writing partnership with Jill Sobule and is to direct Sharon Glassman's ''Untitled for Orchestra'' next year. A guy this busy has to take a breather now and then, and this rare, intimate acoustic performance allows Mr. Barone to do just that. Fans can e-mail requests to requestline@popstar.com. Tonight at 8; tickets are $10 (Ann Powers).\n\nEMILIO BARRETO AND SANTISIMO, Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400 or (212) 545-7536. With Orlando Puntilla Rios. When West African slaves came to the Americas, they brought with them the rhythms and dances that paid tribute to a pantheon of deities called orishas. The rhythms made their way onto the dance floor in many forms of Latin music, but they also survive in their context as rituals and in performances, like this one, for noninitiates. Tomorrow night at 8; tickets are $26 (Jon Pareles).\n\nTIM BERNE, Knitting Factory, Old Office, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006. This restless saxophonist, one of the original soldiers of the 1980's downtown jazz scene, keeps putting new groups together, and in this weekend stay he presents some recent ones. Tonight at 9:30, it's Hardcell, a quartet with the keyboardist Craig Taborn, the trumpeter Herb Robertson and the drummer Tom Rainey; tomorrow and Sunday nights at 8 and 9:30, it's Almost Quicksand, a trio with Mr. Taborn and Mr. Rainey. Admission is $10, and there is a one-drink minimum (Ben Ratliff).\n\nBETTY BOWERY SOLSTICE, Fez, 380 Lafayette Street, at Great Jones Street, East Village, (212) 533-2680. Betty, that trio of fierce pop queens, continues its run of holiday shows at the Fez with this one celebrating all things Wiccan and wonderful. Tonight's special guest is Sophia Ramos Dupre, recently named VH1's best unsigned artist of 2000. Next week: Broadway Hanukkah! Sunday night at 10; admission is $12 (Powers).\n\n* BUZZCOCKS, KUNST PS, STEVE DIGGLE GRP, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700. One one level, punk was just rock made by people who didn't care about marketing plans. That was the case with the Buzzcocks, the group based in Manchester, England, that took rock right back to its itchy, joyful, raging roots. One basic in the Buzzcocks was great songwriting, and these special shows highlight it from all perspectives. Not only will the band's Lennon and McCartney, Pete Shelley and Steve Diggle, perform sets of their own, but the evening also features new songs written by Mr. Shelley and its Dylan, the reclusive Howard Devoto. There's no reason to leave these performances unsatisfied. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8; tickets are $20 (Powers).\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
