Between those bands, New Wet Kojak and Paramount Styles, this man has made over 20 full lenth records, influenced thousands, lived all over the world, with his stylishly tortured vocal delivery being his most enduring trademark.

Many successful musicians, actors, filmmakers, composers, and comedians still have side gigs that afford them the ability to create their art for us. Some get to work in their chosen field and some work jobs that are convenient and make that buck. It is this unique hustle that's at the heart of this podcast. How exactly does the sausage get made when there are bills to be paid? And what drives these maniacs to make our desperate lives better with their art when the pay-off often fulfills their hearts but not their bank accounts?"
