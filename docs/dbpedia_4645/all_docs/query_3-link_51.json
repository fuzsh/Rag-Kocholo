        "text": "Frith’s aphorism\n\nIn June 2002 I was writing up the theoretical background to work I’d been doing since the early eighties. One major issue was the epistemic standoff between the music is music and everything but the music camps in popular music studies. With my musical background in institutions of formal education as well as in pubs and clubs, I was able to deconstruct the first of those two --musical absolutism and its contextless texts-- but I needed help with the other of those two entrenched positions, with the notion that music could be studied as musically textless contexts. That’s why I, as a muso, asked trusted friends and colleagues with non-muso backgrounds to explain why so many popular music scholars had been so reluctant to engage with music as text.\n\nDave Laing and Bruce Johnson were two of those colleagues. Like me, they criticised the hopeless formalism of conventional music studies and its fixation on the euroclassical repertoire. But they also provided useful insights about the other side of the coin, about bodyism, scopocentrism, about an unawareness of what ethnomusicologists were doing, about how ‘Adorno got in the way’, and about the complex history and ideologies of cultural studies. Simon Frith had similar things to say and all three mentioned notation as a barrier to the inclusion of musical texts in the study of music. One part of Frith’s explanation was that music ‘wasn’t the sort of thing you could photocopy’. That aphorism provides a useful starting point for this article.\n\nThe most important word in Frith’s comment is, I think, photocopy. Please remember that I asked the question in 2002 and that we were talking about why, in what was then the recent past --the late 1960s until the 1990s-- non-muso scholars felt unable to engage with music as text. It’s about a time when, in established institutions of learning, there was a tendency to consider knowledge valid only if it existed as a literal text, i.e. as signs stored graphically and reproducible in books, articles and, thanks to the photocopier, as the paper copies it spat out in the form of student handouts. This restrictive notion of legitimate knowledge, defined by its modes of representation, storage and reproduction, was of course exacerbated by the epistemic inertia of many music department staff members who at the time still saw notation as the only legitimate physical manifestation of a musical text or work. I even remember one colleague in an mid-1990s exam jury refusing to grade a student performance because it included an improvised item. ‘How can I mark it if there’s no music to follow?’, he asked rhetorically. Of course, by the missing music he didn’t mean the music as it actually sounded, what we’d all just heard as jury members. He meant the score, the sheet music, the sort of thing you could photocopy but which even then would have made sonic sense to about one in fourteen people living in the urban West.\n\nI’m talking here about a time in recent history, about one century after Edison’s phonograph and around fifty years after the commercial breakthrough of electro-mechanical amplification and of optical sound. And yet, in the mid 1970s, not much more than a generation had passed since audio recording had definitively supplanted sheet music as music’s main commodity form in the urban West. My 2002 question and Frith’s aphoristic answer are in other words retrospective, referring to storage and reproduction technologies in a particular institutional context at a point in history when those technologies were changing dramatically. Today, after another few decades of radical social and technological change, including the advent of media carriers featuring real-time counters, and of audio- and audiovisual downloading, ‘music’ is even more rarely equated with its manifestation as notation. But that doesn’t mean that the potential and limitations of the medium are any better understood by scholars of music, whatever their disciplinary background or repertoire expertise. That’s why a large part of this contribution is devoted to a short idea history of musical notation."
