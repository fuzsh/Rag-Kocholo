        "text": "ONCE, naming a rock band was so simple. Bob Dylan had a band. Thus, you had Bob Dylan and the Band. And according to popular lore, a guy named Buddy had insects in his garage and, voila, it was Buddy Holly and the Crickets. In short, in the old days musical groups has good clean names that suggested forthrightness and a decided lack of imagination.\n\nIn the 1970's, punk bands started choosing names rich with rough sexual overtones and countercultural angst. Heavy metal spawned a fondness for single-word nihilism and rampant use of the umlaut.\n\nNowadays, bands seem to be staking claims to the surreal fringes of nomenclature. Take rock bands with names like Miss Guy and the Toilet Boys, the Voluptuous Horror of Karen Black or a group calling itself Hasidic Hendrix. Juxtapositions of opposites are in.\n\nA glance at three weeks' music listings in The Village Voice reveals a wash of twisted juxtapositions, cryptic pop references and just plain goofy monikers.\n\nWho knows what a Flashing Astonismer is? A group of them apparently played at the Continental Divide on the Bowery on Oct. 25. On that night, a speedy fan could have caught acts by Homer Erotic, Deep Banana Blackout and the String Cheese Incident, as well as the dulcet tones of Who Killed Bambi?, Dowdy Smack, and the Asylum Street Spankers.\n\nAs contrived as some names may seem, today's musicians say that as rock-and-roll creaks through its fifth decade, the sheer number of past and present band names has left them little choice but to strive for the original, even if it borders on the absurd.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
