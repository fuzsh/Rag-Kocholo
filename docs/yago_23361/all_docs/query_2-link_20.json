        "text": "FOR generations, Americans and Europeans have formed an image of the Thai monarchy from the breathless and often fanciful writings of the royal governess Anna H. Leonowens, a Victorian woman who, some historians now say, put pen to paper in an advanced state of culture shock. Mrs. Leonowens's autobiographical writings, ''The English Governess at the Siamese Court'' and ''The Romance of the Harem,'' gave rise to Margaret Landon's 1944 bestseller, ''Anna and the King of Siam,'' which became ''The King and I'' - and an entertaining legend took the place of history.\n\nIn reality, King Mongkut, the king upon whom the Yul Brynner character was very loosely based, while an absolute monarch, was an enlightened ruler (1851-68) for his time, looking beyond his realm for new ideas. So was his son and heir, Chulalongkorn, for whom Thailand's leading university was subequently named.\n\nMuch has changed in Thailand, where King Phumiphol Aduldet, Rama IX of the Chakri Dynasty, and the great-great-grandson of Anna's King Mongkut, recently swore in a new Cabinet formed after elections in July, charging Prime Minister Prem Tinsulanonda to make the public interest his first priority. While the Kingdom of Siam gave way to the constitutional monarchy of Thailand in 1932, the myths and mystery that surround the royal family persist, inside as well as outside the country. And although copies of the film ''The King and I,'' once banned, are available at neighborhood video shops - Queen Sirikit saw Yul Brynner in the New York stage production last year - the monarchy remains protected by stiff lese majeste laws that make comment on royal matters risky. Rumors often take the place of news. And many Thais seem more interested in the affairs of their royal family than they are in politics.\n\nIn this context, it is noteworthy that members of the family of the popular King have confronted gossip with candor and good humor in recent interviews with the Thai media. Television viewers were spellbound recently as Princess Chulabhorn, at 29 the youngest child of the King and Queen, talked at length about her mother. The occasion was Queen Sirikit's 54th birthday, marked by parades and homage from the country's leaders, but for the first time no appearance by the Queen herself.''There is a widespread rumor,'' the interviewer began, ''that Her Majesty the Queen is very sick. It is said that Her Majesty is paralyzed and afflicted by a fatal disease preventing her from making public appearances.''\n\n''The rumors are not true,'' said Princess Chulabhorn in response. The Princess confirmed that the Queen had undergone an operation last year, but said her health had improved. She went on to describe her mother as a woman driven hard by her work reviving handicraft industries and promoting village medical programs. She told of an insomniac who is sometimes awake and pacing her quarters until early morning, a perfectionist who attends to every detail of palace and family life. The following week, the Queen appeared before a group of officials to thank them for their concern.\n\nEarlier, in connection with his 34th birthday, Crown Prince Maha Vajiralongkorn spoke with the women's magazine Dichan (''I'' or ''Me'' in Thai). He said he had heard all the rumors about himself, among them that he did not like royal duties or did not pay his bills.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
