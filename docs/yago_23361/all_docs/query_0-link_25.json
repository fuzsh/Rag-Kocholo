Thanks to its features, reliability and low running costs, the PED has been acknowledged as one of the most interesting sources, especially for complex compounds, and this presentation would be a review of the published literature concerning this technique. In PED, a pulsed e-beam rapidly ablates the first layers of a target material, producing an energetic plasma plume able to condensate onto the substrate surface nearby. The film growth conditions are strictly controlled by the properties of the e-beam in order to ignite atomic excitations and ionizations. Due to the nature of the beam, the shield effect of the plume is absent and the PED process shows high ablation rates useful for a wide range of materials. In addition, low costs for installation of power sources make PED as a suitable technology for massive manufacturing. Here we present a comprehensive review of the application of PED for both fundamental and applied research. Complex compounds, such as oxides, carbides, selenides, sulfides have been deposited by PED for applications in photovoltaics, superconductivity, electronics, sensors, multiferroicity, fuel cells and medicine. A wide range of structures can be synthesized by tuning the electrical parameters and the growth temperature. Finally, we present a series of next-generation materials whose physical properties could be improved by PED technique.\n\nJ.3.1 10:45\n\nAuthors : Li Shao, Andrew Hector, Philip Bartlett, Gilles Moehl, Samantha Soulé, Lingcong Meng, Wenjian Zhang, Yasir Noori\n\nAffiliations : School of Chemistry, University of Southampton, Southampton SO17 1BJ, UK；School of Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton, Southampton SO17 1BJ, UK\n\nResume : Our project (ADEPT, EPSRC EP/N035437/1) aims to produce nanowire devices from main group semiconductor materials through electrodeposition into hard templates. This part of the work focuses on fabricating nanoscale composites by templated electrodeposition. Silica films with a well-ordered three-dimensional mesoporous structure were prepared by the evaporation-induced self-assembly (EISA) method. Grazing incidence small-angle X-ray scattering showed that the pore structure adopted the Fmmm space group with [010] orientation. Bismuth and tellurium were grown through the 3D mesoporous channels by conducting two-step pulsed electrodeposition in a non-aqueous electrolyte system. Electrodeposition conditions were used to optimise the nucleation and growth process and to maximise pore filling. In situ grazing incidence small-angle neutron scattering was used to follow Bi electrodeposition into the pores and to link variations in nucleation to differences in the grown material.\n\nJ.3.2 11:00\n\nAuthors : Andriy Lotnyk*, Mario Behrens*, Kostiantyn Shportko*^, Carsten Bundesmann*, Jürgen W.

The need to understand the correlation between thin film structure and properties calls for research in the synthesis and characterization of epitaxial GST thin films, which offer a significant potential for both basic research and the development of new concepts for memory devices. In this work, layered epitaxial Ge2Sb2Te5 (GST225) thin films consisting of GST building units separated either by vacancy layers (vacancy ordered metastable phase II) or by van der Waals gaps (vacancy ordered stable phase) were achieved on Si(111) substrates by pulsed laser deposition. The formation of a particular phase during the growth was strongly dependent on the deposition process parameters such as substrate temperature, laser fluency and partial pressure of Argon gas. For example, a variation of the laser fluency led to the formation of metastable or stable phase. Nanoscale characterization by transmission electron microscopy revealed the local atomic order and defects in the thin films. UV-laser irradiation of the layered GST225 thin films resulted in the epitaxial recrystallization into non-layered GST225 films (vacancy disordered metastable phase I). Optical characterization of the GST225 thin films revealed the correlation of structural order with the properties of thin films. The Tauc parameter, dielectric constant and plasma frequency obtained from optical spectra are increasing with the improvement of degree of structural order. In addition, the results showed the delocalization of free charge carriers, which evidences the insulator-to-metal transition.\n\nJ.3.3 11:30\n\nAuthors : M-R. Alhafian *(1), J-B. Chemin (1), L.

Besides, the influence of these process parameters on different mechanical properties were also determined. For more comparison study, the properties of same TiAlN coatings produced by dcMS and by Arc were also carried out. Only the most influence process parameters which are the effect of duty cycle, pressure, power and bias will be reported. TEM and SEM observations indicate that the morphology of TiAlN coatings displayed for all the applied conditions a similar columnar morphology, with columns extending from the substrate to the surface. With XRD analyses it was shown that TiAlN coatings deposited by Arc and by HiPIMS have a single-phase cubic structure with (200) and (111) dominant texture as a preferred orientation, respectively. The residual stress also determined by XRD for the HiPIMS coating samples can change from tensile stresses to compressive stresses depending on the different process parameters. Special emphasis to control the stress level of the HiPIMS coatings and consequently to tune their mechanical properties will be proposed. Particularly the residual stress generation and evolution in the film, as well as the hardness, were determined. It is shown that the applied bias plays a key role to improve the film mechanical properties.\n\nJ.3.5 11:45\n\nAuthors : Abbas Saeed Hakeem, Qasem Ahmed Drmosh, Amar Kamal Mohamedkhair, Sharafat Ali, Abdul Samad Mohammed, Zain HassanYamani\n\nAffiliations : Center of Excellence in Nanotechnology, King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals, Dhahran 31261, Saudi Arabia Physics Department, King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals, Dhahran 31261, Saudi Arabia Department of Built Environment and Energy Technology, Linnæus University, SE-351 95 Växjö, Sweden.

The morphology, optical, structural, mechanical, and compositional properties of the fabricated thin films were investigated at different deposition parameters such as substrate temperature, laser power and frequency, deposition time, and deposition pressure.

A parametric study was performed to optimize the thickness of the amorphous carbon (a-C) film (within 1 and 20 nm) and the thermal heating temperature (within 800 and 1000°C in vacuum), to produce a dominant bilayer low-defective graphene film. From those optimal conditions, boron was incorporated into the graphene layers by co-ablating carbon an boron to form an amorphous boron-doped carbon film (a-C:B) converted into boron-doped graphene by thermal heating. The nanoarchitecture and defect content of the graphene and boron-graphene films were investigated by Raman spectroscopy and mapping (including over large areas up to 100 × 100 μm²), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). This study presents experimental guidelines for optimal synthesis conditions to control (doped-) graphene growth by pulsed laser deposition.\n\nJ.4.3 15:15\n\nAuthors : Niemczyk, A*.(1), Kochmański, P.(1), & Baranowska, J.(1).\n\nAffiliations : (1) West Pomeranian University of Technology, Szczecin, Faculty of Mechanical Engineering and Mechatronics, Department of Materials Technology; al.

Initial research focusing on the development of DLC films on biomaterials for medical applications has indicated that the diamond-like carbon structure can be successfully obtained on soft materials, which has promoted a new area of DLC application. Much work is this area focuses on the impact of the substrate on the DLC film, in terms of the demanding requirements for implants and devices. However, the effect of the DLC film on the polymeric substrate material also needs to be defined. The aim of our work was to produce DLC films on different polymer substrates and to study the interaction between them, especially alterations of the chemical structure. A graphite target was ablated with a KrF laser in vacuum at room temperature. The structure of the DLC films obtained and of the substrates was studied using Raman, Infrared, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance and X-ray photoelectron Spectroscopy. The morphology of the films was evaluated by SEM and AFM methods. It was found that, depending on the type of polymer and the fluence of the laser used, chemical changes in the polymer chains can occur to varying degrees. In addition, even for one type of polymer, physical properties such as crystallinity can have an important effect.\n\nJ.4.5 15:30\n\nAuthors : David B.

Pulsed laser deposition (PLD) plasmas inherently imbue species with kinetic energies (KEs) ranging up to 100 eV/atom. These can be moderated through collisions with background gases. Here we explore the synthesis and conversion of few-layer atomically-thin 2D transition metal dichalcogenide crystalline films by PLD using in situ diagnostics to control KE < 10 eV/atom, a regime that excludes other techniques such as sputtering or MBE. We introduce and characterize the controllable implantation of hyperthermal species from pulsed laser deposition (PLD) plasmas as a top-down method to compositionally engineer 2D monolayers. Using in situ plasma diagnostics the kinetic energies of Se clusters impinging on suspended monolayer WS2 crystals were controlled in the <10 eV/atom range to determine the thresholds for selective top layer replacement of sulfur by selenium for the formation of high quality WSSe Janus monolayers at low (300 °C) temperatures, and bottom layer replacement for complete conversion to WSe2. Atomic-resolution electron microscopy and spectroscopy in tilted geometry confirm the WSSe Janus monolayer. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal that Se clusters implant to form disordered metastable alloy regions, which then recrystallize to form highly ordered structures, opening the door for low-energy implantation by PLD as a novel method to explore the synthesis of 2D Janus layers and alloys of variable composition. Research was sponsored by the U.S. Dept. of Energy, Office of Science, Basic Energy Sciences, Materials Science and Engineering Div. and was conducted at CNMS, a U.S. DOE Office of Science User Facility.\n\nJ.4.6 16:00 Coffee break\n\nPoster Session : N.

Structural, optical and electrical properties were recorded using X-ray diffraction (XRD), UV-Vis spectroscopy and four-probe method. XRD results confirmed the epitaxial growth of as-deposited thin films and crystallize in rhombohedral structure with space group R-3c. And its structure remains unaffected with Mg-substitution. But expansion along c-axis has been observed with the increase in concentration due to higher ionic radii of Mg2+ (86 pm) as compared to Cr3+ (75.5 pm) ion. UV-vis measurements demonstrated high transparency in the visible region of as-deposited thin films. The optical band gap of thin films was determined using Tauc’s relation. Pure Cr2O3 thin film exhibits a wide optical band of 3.66 eV, which was found to decrease with Mg-substitution. Electrical measurements revealed that pure Cr2O3 thin film has high resistance of the order of 105 Ω. After the substitution of Mg into Cr2O3, enhancement in conductivity has been observed. Hall measurements confirmed that Cr2O3 thin films retain the p-type character, even after the Mg-substitution. This work can lead to the development of highly effective p-type transparent conductive oxide material, which can render application in the field of optoelectronics.\n\nJ.P.I.1 16:30\n\nAuthors : Abdul Rehman\n\nAffiliations : Department of Chemistry, King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals\n\nResume : Present work reports a simple, cost-effective and scalable approach for electrochemical sensing employing silver thin film electrodes prepared by the single-step AACVD with controlled and optimized microstructure to have Ag nanoparticles coalesced together for high conductivity and facile electrochemical reduction of 2-nitrophenol (2-NP) as the model analyte. Thickness controlled structure and conductivity evolution of the silver thin films is studied by growing them on ITO glass substrates at 400 ˚C for deposition times of 10-45 minutes using methanol solution of silver triflouroacetate (Ag(CF3COO)), a commercially available precursor. XRD, XPS, SEM and EDX analysis of the films verified the presence of crystalline and phase pure elemental silver with nanometer dimensions. All silver electrodes were used to investigate the electrochemical behavior of 2-NP by cyclic voltammetry (CV) while the quantitative profiling was done by LSV. The results indicate that the silver electrode developed in 30 min has an excellent electrocatalytic activity toward 2-NP reduction in terms of lowering the reduction overpotential and increasing the reduction current which is attributed to its percolated metallic network structure. This particular electrode exhibit a wide dynamic range = 50-450 M, detection limit = 12 nM, signal loss = 3.4% over 4 weeks, and high selectivity from potential interfering agents, a performance much better than the available thin film sensors and Ag-disk electrode.\n\nJ.P.I.2 16:30\n\nAuthors : Sauze L., Remiens D., Vaxelaire N., Rodriguez G., Rouchon D., Licitra C.\n\nAffiliations : CEA-LETI; IEMN-DOAE; CEA-LETI; CEA-LETI; CEA-LETI; CEA-LETI;\n\nResume : The deployment of the 5th Generation of mobile applications (5G) requires RF filters with improved performances in terms of frequency, fractional bandwidth, and so on. Due to its high electromechanical coupling coefficient (up to 45% for bulk waves), acoustic velocity (3500 – 7500 m.s-1) and quality factor (> 45000), single-crystal lithium niobate (LiNbO3) thin film appears as an appealing candidate to replace AlN-based materials in these devices [1]. LaNiO3 is a conductive ceramics with a lattice parameter close to LiNbO3. It may be used as a seed-layer and an electrode for BAW applications. In the present work, approximately 200 nm-thick LiNbO3 films have been grown by Pulsed Laser Deposition (PLD) [3] on LaNiO3/Si samples. The as-deposited films have been characterized by X-Ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) and ellipsometry. The stoichiometry of the film seems difficult to control and the roughness significant. Finally, electrical properties and in particular piezoelectric properties (d33 coefficients) have been evaluated. References [1] A. Bartasyte et al., Advanced Materials Interfaces 4, 1600998 (2011).

Conventional reflective color filters with multiple layers of dielectric films could not simultaneously produce a large area and good mechanical properties due to the complex multiple depositions and the difference in the thermal expansion coefficients among the material layers. Herein, full-spectrum colors were generated by novel Mg-based reflective color filters in a large area of 2 cm × 2 cm with a high hardness of 9.12 GPa, where the filters include an absorber layer with controllable optical constants and a reflective layer with an amorphous structure. The saturation and hue of the produced colors can be controlled by tuning the optical constants and the thickness of the absorber layer. Additionally, the hardness of the Mg-based reflective color filters was increased by the reflective metallic glass layers because they were derived from the same material as the absorber layer. This paradigm could pave the way for the efficient fabrication of large area color filtering devices for diverse applications, such as surface decorations, optical components, color display devices, structural color printing and photovoltaic cells with optimum efficiency.\n\nJ.P.I.5 16:30\n\nAuthors : Ju Hyun Oh, Sung Heum Park, Bo Ram Lee, Byung Chun Choi, Jung Hyun Jeong*\n\nAffiliations : Department of Physics, Pukyong National University\n\nResume : In this study, Eu3+ doped SrLaMgTaO6 (SLMTOE) thin films were deposited on SrTiO3 (100) using pulsed laser deposition, and the dependence of the structural and photoluminescence (PL) properties on the oxygen partial pressure was investigated. The X-ray diffraction patterns were investigated to determine the growth behavior of the SLMTOE films on the SrTiO3 (100) substrates. Under an oxygen partial pressure of less than 100 mTorr, the SLMTOE film deposited on the SrTiO3 (100) substrate was aligned out of the substrate surface, while at high oxygen partial pressure it was not. The PL spectrum showed that the red emission peak at 613 nm was strongest at the oxygen partial pressure of 100 mTorr, and the emission peak intensity decreased with increasing oxygen partial pressure. In addition, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis showed that the content of Eu3 + ions decreased with increasing oxygen partial pressure, while the content of Eu2 + ions increased.\n\nJ.P.I.6 16:30\n\nAuthors : I.D.

Doping of ZnO with transition metal (TM) elements offers an effective method to adjust its electrical, optical, and magnetic properties, which is crucial for its practical applications. The present work is devoted to preparing of Zn1-xMexO (Me: Mn, Ni, Co) thin films by RF-plasma sputtering technique and study of their structural, optical and magnetic properties depending on content of TM elements. The content x in the deposited films was varied in range of (0 – 0.1). The structures of the samples have been studied by using X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The structure and surface morphology of the deposited layers show strong dependence on doping with TM and deposition conditions. The optical absorption spectra of the films demonstrate that the energy bang gap was found to decrease with increase of Co content and complex dependence on the content of Ni. The EPR spectra show a broad asymmetrical line of Dysonian shape and satisfactory ascribed by the single Lorenz type curve with Dysonian term. Near the ferromagnetic ordering temperature distortion of the EPR spectra and its following splitting on two Dysonian lines were found.\n\nJ.P.I.8 16:30\n\nAuthors : Chutima Kongvarhodom, Pannarai Jetsadangkool\n\nAffiliations : Department of Chemical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, King Mongkut?s University of Technology Thonburi, Bangkok 10140, Thailand\n\nResume : The influence of sputtering parameters on the microstructures of Cu-Ni thin films was investigated in this study. The Cu-Ni thin films were fabricated on p-type silicon substrates by magnetron sputtering deposition at various sputtering powers and Ar pressures. The microstructures of these films were evaluated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results shown that the Cu-Ni film deposited at higher sputtering power and lower Ar pressure promoted the film crystallinity and the growth of Cu-Ni films as compared to the films deposited at lower sputtering power and higher Ar pressure due to the increase of the surface mobility of the adatoms with higher energy and decreasing Ar pressure. The crystallite sizes of the Cu-Ni films as a function of deposition rate are also discussed in this study. The crystallite sizes of the Cu-Ni films analyzed using Scherrer?s formula shown a linear relation with deposition rate. However, the deposition rate seems not exhibit strong effect on the alloy composition of the film. The surface morphology of the Cu-Ni alloy films studied by SEM revealed the surface microstructural variations in Cu-Ni films deposited at different sputtering powers and Ar pressures. At higher sputtering power and Ar pressure, a cauliflower-type structure with groups of grains separated by small valleys started to form. This phenomenon reveals an important fundamental relationship between sputtering parameters and microstructures of Cu-Ni thin films that can be exploited for material design.\n\nJ.P.I.9 16:30\n\nAuthors : Tae-Yeon Cho1, Won-Jae Lee1,2, Seong-Keun Cho1*\n\nAffiliations : 1.

Graduate School of NID Fusion Technology, Seoul National University of Science and Technology, Seoul 139-743, Republic of Korea\n\nResume : Silicon nitride thin films fabricated using plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) have been studied as barrier films for protecting devices from moisture and oxygen in the field of organic electronics. In particular, flexible organic electronics, which have received much attention recently, require substrates having excellent barrier performance because they are very sensitive to moisture and oxygen. In this study, multilayer barrier films composed of SiNx and SiOF were continuously coated onto PET substrates by R2R PECVD at less than 50 °C in the same reactor respectively. SiH4 and NH3 gas were injected into the gas shower head as a precursor to form a SiNx thin film, and SiF4 and N2O gas were injected to form a SiOF thin film. This multilayer structure allows the decoupling of defects between the single SiNx layers In addition, SiOF is an inherently hygroscopic material that traps water molecules passing through the SiNx layer and delays the time passing through the entire barrier film, thereby contributing to the improvement of barrier performance. Furthermore, this multilayer barrier film process can be carried out continuously in a single reaction chamber without vacuum interruption, saving time compared to organic-inorganic multilayer structure. The SiNx/SiOF/SiNx multilayer film showed superior barrier performance compared to the SiNx single layer film under the same thickness. Barrier performance was measured by the water vapor transmission rate (WVTR) method using the MOCON Aquatran-2 instrument. Under the optimal process conditions, the moisture barrier performance of the SiNx/SiOF/SiNx multilayer barrier film on PET reached 1.2×10-3g/m2·day at 40 °C and 90% relative humidity.\n\nJ.P.I.11 16:30\n\nAuthors : Ko-Wei Lin1, Roshni Yadav1, Xin-Ren Yang1, Chi Wah Leung2, W.

The ferrimagnetic Tb3Fe5O12 (TbIG) thin film (40 nm) was grown on (111) oriented Gd3Ga5O12 (GGG) substrates by using pulsed laser deposition technique [2] showing the high crystalline quality and sharp interfaces. Here, we report the use of polarized neutron reflectometry (PNR) [3] to study the magnetic properties of a Tb3Fe5O12 film at temperatures above, below and near the compensation point (Tcomp. ~ 246 K). The magnetization of the TbIG film is supressed around Tcomp. The neutron reflectivity with different states (spin up (R+) and spin down (R-)) was measured as a function of the scattering vector Q. The PNR spectra at 7 K shows the clear splitting of R+ and R- confirming ferrimagnetic behaviour for the TbIG layer. The spin asymmetry (SA = (R+-R-)/(R++R-)) results are consistent with those obtained by the temperature dependence of the magnetic moment. The scattering length density (SLD) models were used to successfully fit the data. The presence of an induced magnetic layer at interfaces between the TbIG layer and the GGG substrate is attributed to a magnetic proximity effect.

The wide spectrum of TMO physical properties is strongly influenced by the interplay among charge, spin, orbital and lattice degrees of freedom. The relation between spin order (SO) and orbital order (OO), coupled to lattice distortions in TMOs, has stimulated many experimental and theoretical works. The vanadate RVO3 perovskites (R=rare earth) exhibit the prototypical behavior arising from these different couplings. Upon decreasing temperature, they undergo orbital and spin orderings at temperatures T_OO and T_SO, respectively. Interestingly, a G-type orbital ordering takes place at T_OO concomitant with a structural phase transition (orthorhombic to monoclinic). Below T_OO, superexchange interactions stabilize a C-type antiferromagnetic spin order at T_SO. Remarkably, it has been shown that T_OO can be tuned either by chemical pressure, by decreasing the R-site ionic radius, or physically by applying hydrostatic pressure, suggesting an intimate orbital–lattice coupling. Here, we present the study of the properties of PrVO3 epitaxial films grown on SrTiO3 substrates by pulsed laser deposition (PLD). A Detailed x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and x-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) investigation reveals interesting magnetic behaviors of both vanadium and praseodymium sites.\n\nJ.P.I.14 16:30\n\nAuthors : Wolfgang Stein\n\nAffiliations : SURFACE systems technologies GmbH Co KG\n\nResume : he development of functional thin film materials is often characterized by typical three steps: the deposition process, a structural preparation and the characterization of the physical properties. Each of these steps is a separated by atmospheric handling and preparation activities. In case of reactive materials such preparation could be done under controlled conditions in glove boxes. But also under protected gas conditions any atmospheric gas contact to the sensitive surface of a complex multi layer film could affect the final film properties. A flexible and adaptable substrate carrier system in combination with interconnected systems could help to avoid atmospheric preparation steps and the possibility of negative influences to the film properties. The complexity of the film itself and the final characterization process demanding the kind of insitu inter action at the sample carrier level. Two ways exist to implement the structural process of the sample: for simple substrate preparation: flexible carrier based shutter/mask system for complex film or device oriented sample preparation: advanced mask system with ex changeable shadow masks and an integrated mask changing station as part of a multiple process cluster deposition system. In the first case a carrier integrated shutter/mask system allows during the process to shutter differ- ent areas of a sample. This can be actuated from the outside by dedicated manipulation devices and can be done even at the deposition temperature. The shutters are never touching the sample surface at any time. In case of more complex shutter/masking steps the carrier system has to allow the changing of precise masks between the different process steps. A separate mask changing station is necessary to store and exchange the different masks. The final design of these components must always recognize the ther- mal interaction with the substrate and its deposition temperature. The final structure width of the multiple masking processes depends of the proper handling of this thermal management between substrate and mask system. Examples for both versions are shown, including the different steps of in vacuum sample preparation.\n\nJ.P.I.15 16:30\n\nAuthors : Ying-Li Shi,* Yun Hu, Shuang-Peng Wang, Liang-Sheng Liao* and Francis Chi-Chung Ling*\n\nAffiliations : Department of Physics, The University of Hong Kong\n\nResume : Transparent conducting oxides (TCO) have attracted great attention since the first demonstration in 1907 by Baedeker. TCO thin films with high transparency and electrical conductivity have been widely used in optoelectronic devices, such as thin-film transistors, perovskite solar cells, organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) and quantum dot light emitting diodes (QLEDs). Er doped ZnO films exhibit higher optical transparency (~95 %) than other reported metal elements doped ZnO TCO thin films. The effect of Er doping concentration on photoelectric properties of ErZO thin films was investigated in the range of 0-2.0 wt.%. The Er impurity substitutes the Zn site and ErZn serves as charge donor in the ZnO crystal structure, thus resulting in the improvement of n-type conductivity as compared with intrinsic ZnO thin films. The optimized ErZO thin films present the low resistivity of 3.4×10−4 Ω/cm, high carrier concentration of 5.9×1020 /cm3 and high visible optical transmittance (~93%) when the Er content is 1.0 wt.%. The ErZO thin films were used as transparent anodes to fabricate organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). Impressively, with the ErZO as anode, the current efficiency of the OLEDs device can reach as high as 86.5 cd/A, which was increased by 14% when compared with the reference OLEDs device (76.0 cd/A) using ITO as anode.\n\nJ.P.I.16 16:30\n\nAuthors : Soo-Young Jung, Seung-Hyub Baek\n\nAffiliations : Korea Institute of Science and Technology; Korea Institute of Science and Technology;\n\nResume : Secure authentication of one’s identity is a major challenge in a modern society due to the increasing popularity of mobile devices (such as smart phones) that can not only store the owner’s personal information but also allow banking transactions. A biometrics-based authentication system has attracted a great attention owing to its relatively high-security level and convenience. Current fingerprint recognition systems do not meet the required security level: optical sensors are hard to miniaturize and easily deceived, and capacitive detectors often fail to recognize the patterns by contamination. The ultrasound technology with pMUT (piezoelectric micromachined ultrasound transducer) is one of the most promising technologies to realize such a highly-secure biometrics-based authentication system for mobile electronics. The performance of pMUT is directly determined with the electromechanical property of the piezoelectric layer. However, using conventional piezoelectric materials such as AlN, ZnO, and PZT, it is difficult to generate high power ultrasound that can penetrate into the skin to see veins. Therefore, it is highly desirable to integrate single crystalline relaxor-ferroelectrics, so-called giant piezoelectric materials, on Si substrate. In this talk, I will discuss the recent progress on the epitaxial integration of Pb(Mg,Nb)O3-Pb(Zr,Ti)O3 thin films on Si.\n\nJ.P.I.17 16:30\n\nAuthors : D. Preziosi1, S. Homkar1, C. Lefevre1, M.

Spin-orbit coupling in magnetoelectric compounds, when presents, may offer novel functionalities[1] and, the understanding of the underlying physics is a necessary step towards a rational design of novel magnetoelectric-based devices. Here, we report on Fe L3,2-edges X-ray magnetic circular dichroism study performed on 64 nm thick films of Ga0.6Fe1.4O3(GFO) grown onto SrTiO3(111) single crystals. Depending on the external magnetic field orientation the orbital magnetic moment is found parallel or anti-parallel to the spin magnetic moment. This apparent local violation of the third Hund’s rule is qualitatively discussed in term of strong anisotropic FeO6 distortions. The latter set a preferential crystallographic direction for the orbital magnetic moment, and the resulting strong orbital-lattice interaction may limit its reorientation in an external magnetic field. A control over the FeO6 distortions can offer a suitable leverage over the amplitude of the spin-orbit coupling in the GFO multiferroic system. [1] Manipatruni, S.; Nikonov, D.

They are typically produced as metal-insulator-metal (MIM) heterostructures in which the electromagnetic skin depth of the order of several micrometers in the frequency range of a few gigahertz determines the desired electrode thickness. Here we present Pt-BST-SrMoO3 varactors, combining a highly conducting perovskite oxide SrMoO3 bottom electrode with atomically engineered sharp interfaces to the substrate and to the subsequently grown epitaxial layer of a tunable BST dielectric [1]. The several micrometers thick layer-by-layer grown SrMoO3 films show a room-temperature conductivity higher than 30 kS/cm and provide a perfect lattice match to the BST of the Ba:Sr=50:50 composition range desired for high tunability of the varactors at room-temperature [2]. The difficult to achieve epitaxial thick film growth makes use of the extraordinary ability of perovskites to accommodate strain by adjusting their lattice constant with small shifts in the cation ratio. We show that our approach enables the fabrication of varactors based on 50–100 nm thin BST layers with high tunability above three at the Li-ion battery voltage level (3.7 V). [1] P.

Some of the major requirements from a wound dressing are to; absorb exudates, prevent infection and contaminant contact with wound, sustain non-toxicity, moist environment, permeability, temperature, and pH. An ideal wound dressing does not only act as a physical barrier for wound against mechanical trauma but also accelerate the healing process and prevent bacterial infection. In this regard, the development of wound dressings can be discussed taking account of traditional and modern (advanced, smart) dressings into consideration. In recent years, studies on the functionalization of conventional textile surfaces have become widespread. Particularly in medical applications, there are considerable studies on wound dressings. In this study, it is aimed to develop waterproof and antibacterial films for the top layer of a multi-component wound dressing by pulsed deposition method. As briefly discussed above, one of the important properties of the wound dressing materials is being a barrier against the risk of infection between wound and environment to prevent the external effects such as bacterias, contaminated fluids etc. In addition to these functions, the breathability of the structure is a key factor that directly affects the healing process. Therefore, the surface is coated with a waterproof and antibacterial monomer at nano scale. The nanoscale coating did not affect breathability negatively. In addition, it is aimed to increase the air permeability by using channel cross-section PLA (poly-lactic acid) yarns in the fabric structure.\n\nJ.P.I.21 16:30\n\nAuthors : M. Nistor 1, F.

Besides this classical aspect, PED working under a low oxygen pressure, controls the oxygen incorporation and therefore the stoichiometry of the oxide films, leading to the growth of oxygen deficient metastable phases which can not be obtained in bulk form. The non-stoichiometry (cation-to anion ratios) will be presented in the particular case of indium oxide based thin films (In2O3, ITO, IGZO) in relation with their structure and optoelectronic properties. The effect of pulsed aspect of the growth (kinetic energies of species arriving at the substrate and the deposition rate) on the film properties was investigated. In the case of a high non-stoichiometric indium tin oxide, a phase separation occurs with the formation of metallic clusters embedded in a stoichiometric crystalline indium tin oxide matrix. Such metallic clusters induced very specific transport properties; otherwise the films are still degenerate semiconductors. These results will be presented and discussed in the frame of growth-induced non-stoichiometry vs. existing density functional calculations on electronic structure.\n\nJ.P.I.24 16:30\n\nAuthors : M.L.

With respect to many other deposition techniques, ALD has the ability to coat conformal coatings on complex geometries and, due to the low porosity, Al2O3 films grown by ALD have been recently proposed as protective coatings against corrosion in several applications. In this work we compare the structural and mechanical characteristics of 150 nm thick Al2O3 coatings fabricated by ALD and radio frequency sputtering. ALD coatings were deposited on Si substrates at 150°C and 300 °C starting from tri-methylaluminum (TMA) precursors and were submitted to annealing in air at 900 °C inside a tubular furnace. Radio frequency sputtered Al2O3 films where grown at room temperature at a radio frequency power of 300 W in pure Ar atmosphere. Samples were submitted to annealing in air at 900°C. X-ray diffraction and nano-hardness measurements were used to infer the structural and mechanical properties of the as deposited and annealed ALD and sputtered films.\n\nJ.P.I.27 16:30\n\nAuthors : Sangbong Lee 1,† , Yun-Ho Kang 1,† , Yeong-Ho Cho 1 , Hyun-Mi Kim 1 , Minsu Kim 1 , and Ki-Bum Kim 1, *\n\nAffiliations : 1 Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea\n\nResume : With demand on the miniaturization of devices with better electrical performance, multicomponent metal oxides prepared by atomic layer deposition (ALD) have drawn great attentions as active material of thin film transistors (TFTs) or transparent conductive electrodes (TCEs) of high-end future electronic devices owing to its high mobility and extreme conformality. However, a noticeable variation of physical properties consequence of heterogenous layer-by-layer deposition manner of ALD is less explored. To address this issue, we report the influence of a bilayer period of ALD on the growth behavior, microstructures, and electrical properties of In-Zn-O (IZO) films. IZO films with various bilayer periods are deposited by alternately stacking of ZnO and In 2 O 3 layers at a temperature of 200℃. Film growth behavior, structural, electrical properties and chemical composition of ALD-IZO films were systematically investigated to verify the effect of bilayer period on IZO films. The IZO films with the number of successive ZnO cycles from 1 to 4, which are designated as IZO (9:1) and IZO (36:4) exhibit an amorphous-like phase with resistivity of 4.94×10 -4 Ω∙cm. However, IZO films with increasing successive ZnO ALD cycles showed a microstructure transition from well-blended amorphous to polycrystalline nanolaminate resulting from the lack of intermixing. The rapid increase of resistivity was observed in polycrystalline nanolaminate with a decrease of both carrier mobility and concentration. These results reveal the importance of bilayer period on designing ALD stacking sequence in the multicomponent oxide ALD process.\n\nJ.P.I.28 16:30\n\nAuthors : Jun Hee Kim, Won Gil Hwang, Hee Young Lee, and Jai-Yeoul Lee\n\nAffiliations : School of Materials Science and Engineering, Yeungnam University, Gyeongsan , Korea\n\nResume : Ta doped tin-niobate Sn2Nb2-xTaxO7 thin films with pyrochlore structure were fabricated by pulsed laser deposition.

Li-ion systems are good candidates to meet these needs thanks to their high energy and power density, long cycle life, design flexibility and so on. One key way to manufacture microbatteries is the production of 2D electrodes by the means of thin film deposition techniques. Here thin films of TiO2 (anode material) were deposited by fs-PLD technique, with a Nd-glass laser source (527 nm, 250 fs, 10 Hz). The use of a femtosecond pulse laser guarantees the stoichiometric transfer of the ablated material from the target, with no need to work in an oxidizing atmosphere. Since TiO2 exists as to main polymorphs (rutile and anatase), whose presence is very sensitive to the crystallization temperature, post-treatments of annealing were carried out on the films at different temperatures. The obtained films, characterized by microscopic, spectroscopic and diffractometric techniques, were crystalline, dense and compact. Electrochemical tests confirmed the possibility to use TiO2 deposited thin films as anode for Li-ion microbatteries.\n\nJ.P.I.30 16:30\n\nAuthors : E. Millon (1), V. Rogé (1), C. Cachoncinlle (1), J.

However, being able to grow stable FexOy thin films with controlled iron oxidation states could be of interest for further applications. In this work, we highlight the formation of different FexOy based thin films grown by pulsed-laser deposition (PLD) from Fe or Fe3O4 targets onto sapphire or MgO substrates. Based on XRD and RBS analysis, we point out that, by controlling both the substrate temperature and the oxygen pressure in the 10-7 – 0,1 mbar range during the PLD growth, films with various Fe/O ratios may be prepared. Thus, the different crystalline phases of the Fe-O system may be obtained: Fe2O3, Fe3O4, and the thermodynamically metastable FeO. In particular we show that at low pressure (10-6 mbar) Fe3O4/Fe composite thin films for which both metallic Fe and Fe3O4 phases are epitaxially grown on the sapphire substrates even at room temperature. This result is interpreted as a possible phase separation from the FeO metastable phase. The precise growth conditions leading to the formation of FeO-based film are also discussed.\n\nJ.P.I.32 16:30\n\nAuthors : A. Stupakov, T. Kocourek, M. Jelínek, A. Dejneka, M.

Being attractive for electronic applications, the MIT in thin NNO films was widely explored in the last decades. Despite significant research efforts, scaling of NNO resistivity as a function of deposition technology is far from clear comprehension. Here, we focused on in situ pulsed laser deposition (PLD) of the NNO films. Because properties of perovskite oxides are known to be sensitive to oxygen stoichiometry, we investigated resistivity of the NNO films in dependence on pressure of oxygen ambience in PLD. To enable epitaxial growth, the (001) single-crystal substrates (LSAT, LAO, STO) were used. The 20-100-nm thick NNO films were grown by PLD using an excimer KrF laser and stoichiometric ceramic target. The energy density of 2 J/cm2 and the substrate temperature of 700 C were employed. The oxygen pressure during PLD and post-deposition cooling was varied from 0.1 to 20 Pa. The high-temperature metal-type resistivity and low-temperature insulating state were obtained in the stoichiometric films deposited at 20 Pa. With decreasing PLD pressure, the resistivity was found to increase and MIT gradually vanish. It was suggested that oxygen vacancies can produce disorder in crystal and electronic structure of NNO and also act as traps for charge carriers. Consequently, the defects can lead to the relative uplift of resistivity.\n\nJ.P.I.35 16:30\n\nAuthors : M. Braic1, A. Vladescu1, H. Schubert(2), V. Braic1, N.C. Zoita1, I. Pana1, A.E. Kiss1, O.

However, there are still reported surgical site infections, which are particularly critical and difficult to treat. The main goal of the research is to provide antibacterial efficacy by nano-thick and nanostructured silver-doped hydroxiapatite coatings, potentially capable of assuring a tailored ion-release, also engineered to prevent cytotoxicity and the development of resistant bacterial strains. High power impulse magnetron sputtering of a silver target and the RF magnetron sputtering of three hydroxyapatite targets, operated in Ar, were used to synthesize Ag-doped hydroxyapatite thin films. The fine control of the silver content in the deposited thin films composition was possible by the HiPIMS discharge, due to the fine control of the Ag deposition rate, by using different pulse frequencies and pulse duration periods. The content of Ag spanned from 12 to 0.5 at.%. The films deposited on polished Ti discs were characterized by various analytical techniques (AFM, SEM, EDS, RBS, XRD and FT-IR) in terms of surface morphology and texture, crystallinity, chemical and elemental composition. In vitro corrosion resistance was carried out in simulated body fluid. While low Ag content indicated no significant modifications of films properties, higher contents increased the corrosion resistance and hydrophilicity and decreased the surface roughness.

In this work, the microstructural properties and the growth behavior of the LFO films prepared on (001)-oriented SrTiO3 (STO) substrates have been studied by advanced transmission/scanning transmission electron microscopy techniques. Two types of orientation relationship between LFO and STO have been determined, cube-on-cube and (111)[1 ̅10]LFO//(111)[11 ̅0]STO. It was observed antiphase boundaries (APBs) and three types of twin boundaries (TBs) form within the films, and misfit dislocations with the displacement vector of (a/4)[110] form at the interface. The propagation of TBs and APBs results in their complex interactions in the films. In most cases, interactions between TBs and APBs can change the type of TBs and terminate the propagation of APBs since the APBs introduce a displacement vector of (a/4)[110] into the TBs. In addition, the interactions between two coherent TBs are observed to generate the incoherent TBs. The epitaxial misfit strain of the heterosystem can be released by the formation of TBs, APBs and misfit dislocations. The cation distributions across the APBs and three types of TBs result in different magnetic couplings and novel physical properties compared with the perfect spinel structure. Consequently, the magnetic properties of the LFO films would be affected by the appearance of a high density of APBs and TBs within the films.\n\nJ.P.I.37 16:30\n\nAuthors : Lenka Volfova1, Stefan Andrei Irimiciuc2, Misha Vorokhta3, Michal Novotny1, Sergej Chertopalov1, Jiri Bulir1, Premysl Fitl1,4, Jan Lancok1\n\nAffiliations : 1 Institute of Physics of the Czech Academy of Sciences, Na Slovance 2, 182 21 Prague 8, Czechia; 2 National Institute for Laser, Plasma and Radiation Physics – NILPRP, 409 Atomistilor Street, Bucharest, Romania; 3 Faculty of Mathematics and Physics, Charles University, V Holešovičkách 2, 180 00 Prague 8, Czechia; 4 Department of Physics and Measurements, University of Chemistry and Technology Prague, Technicka 5, 16628 Prague 6, Czechia\n\nResume : Copper oxide Cu2O is an important and well known p-type transition metal oxide semiconductor material, which has already been employed in the fabrication of electronic devices. For example Cu2O has been used in thin photovoltaic devices, resistive switching, transistors, gas sensors or catalysts. The films were fabricated by Pulsed Laser Deposition from CuO ceramic target by means of Nd:YAG laser operated at 266 nm wavelength. MgO(100) substrates were mounted on substrate holder 5 cm away from the target and maintained at temperature in the range 500-700 °C. Our attention was mainly focused on the influence of the oxygen pressure, which was varied between 10-5 Pa and 1 Pa, on the structural and following on optical and electrical properties. The investigation of the plasma was carried out by Optical emission spectroscopy. The surface morphology and composition were characterised by AFM and XPS, respectively. The crystalline quality of the films were characterised by means of XRD and following by TEM and HRTEM, which confirmed the epitaxial grown of the films in low oxygen pressure up to 0.1 Pa. When the oxygen pressure exceeded 0.1 Pa the growing films started to be polycrystalline and the CuO phase also appeared. Because we focused on utilization of the Cu2O films as gas sensors, the near ambient pressure photoelectron spectroscopy was carried out to investigation of surfaces composition in the presence of gasses and vapours such as ethanol, hydrogen and NO2.\n\nJ.P.I.39 16:30\n\nAuthors : T.

The conversion of charge current to spin current is known as spin Hall effect (SHE) and the inverse phenomenon is inverse SHE (ISHE). The detection of spin is usually realized by the ISHE. Spin Hall magnetoresistance (SMR) arises due to the simultaneous effect of SHE and ISHE in a bilayer heterostructures consisting of a ferromagnetic (or ferrimagnetic) insulator (FMI) and a normal metal (NM). Magnetic Proximity Effect (MPE) observed in YIG/Pt complicates the spin transport scenario with additional effects such as Anomalous Hall effect (AHE) which attenuate SMR signal.4,5. Our group has successfully studied Ga: ZnO insertion on Bi: YIG/Pt and observed SMR signals, but the increase in spurious paramagnetic signal hampered the SMR signals with increasing Ga: ZnO thickness6. A solution for this is to employ antiferromagnetic moments, which are quite stable to stray fields and MPE. Recent studies in this direction have proved successful in generating spin current using antiferromagnets NiO/Pt, Cr2O3/W, CuIr and SrMnO3/Pt layers. Recent theories and experiments carried out by various groups to use spin current as a detection method to probe interface magnetism. We have fabricated Antiferromagnetic oxide and metal oxide heterostructures through pulsed laser deposition and demonstrated tunability of SOC and spin relaxation mechanism through transport measurements. Further possibilities of spin transport through these layers were investigated using angle-dependent magnetoresistance measurements (ADMR). We have varied the deposition conditions such that the magnetic interactions changes from antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic order and we could identify the magnetic behaviour through spin transport studies carried out in this bilayer samples. The spin current generated in SrIrO3 has other higher-order magnetoresistance components along with spin Hall magnetoresistance. This unusual scenario is challenging as it needs to be addressed theoretically. We would be presenting our experimental observations on spin transport studies carried out in these bilayers.

An alternative to Bi2Te3 alloys, the room temperature best performing but toxic thermoelectric (TE) materials, have to be considered while a good skin contact necessitate a flexible TE material. We propose to use health compatible perovskite oxide TE films deposited on a flexible porous silicon (PSi) membrane to fulfill these requirements. Porosification of a Si wafer top surface is obtained by electrochemical etching. A 0.03 mm thick PSi layer can then be peeled-off to get a self-supporting membrane. The idea is to peel-off the membrane after TE generator micro-processing completion, thereby ensuring high temperature mechanical stability for perovskite crystallization and cleanroom handling easiness. We report here on the synthesis and characterization of TE thin film libraries grown by combinatorial pulsed laser deposition. Polycristalline or epitaxial films of (Nb,La):SrTiO3 and (Sr,Ba):LaCoO3 semiconducting compounds (n and p type) are deposited on PSi/Si or single crystal perovskite substrate. Local measurements of the Seebeck coefficient, the electrical conductivity and the thermal conductivity (on Psi) allows for the estimation of the figure of merit ZT across the combinatorial libraries. Doping levels are characterized by XPS and WDX. The evolution of the TE properties versus doping and microstructure will be discussed.\n\nJ.P.I.43 16:30\n\nAuthors : H.Arslan, M.Zubkins, A.Azens, J.Butikova, J.Purans\n\nAffiliations : Thin Films Laboratory, Institute of Solid State Physics, University of Latvia\n\nResume : Yttrium oxide (Y2O3) thin films have been studied previously for different applications, but only recently [Kaminaga et al., 2016] yttrium monoxide (YO) was discovered, by pulsed laser deposition technique, in the form of thin film with a rock salt structure and Y2+ (4d1) valence. The films have narrow optical bad gap ≈ 0.5 eV and electrical conductivity close to metallic state. In this research yttrium oxide thin films with different stoichiometry (YOx) were obtained by reactive DC magnetron sputtering and HiPIMS in an Ar + O2 atmosphere ( ≈ 3 mTorr working pressure) onto different substrates. The O2 partial pressure is varied from 10-7 to 10-5 Torr. The oxygen inlet position is intentionally kept away from the target to sputter in the so called metallic mode. The electronic properties and atomic structures were studied by in-lab techniques such as XRD, XPS (UPS), Ellipsometry, Raman and FT-IR Spectroscopies. The different valance states of yttrium (Y0, Y2+,Y3+) are observed corresponding to the different phases of yttrium oxides (i.e. YO, Y2O3). The oxidation mechanism of metallic Y film is being investigated.

After being validated by in vitro cytotoxicity tests, the Ti implants functionalized with LiC and LiP structures were investigated in vivo, by insertion in rabbit tibia. The in vivo experimental model for testing the extraction force of 3D metallic implants was used. After different periods of time (four and eight weeks), the implants were mechanically removed from the bones and the inferred values were compared with the ones corresponding to bare (control) Ti implants. For both periods, the obtained results were significantly improved, the bone – implant interaction force being more than 25% higher for the functionalized Ti implants in comparison with the simple Ti ones. This is the first report in the dedicated literature on in vivo preliminary assessment of LiC and LiP coatings synthesized by PLD. Along with their low fabrication costs from natural, sustainable resources, these improved mechanical characteristics could offer guidance towards the suitability of using lithium-doped biological-derived materials as viable substitutes of synthetic HA for the fabrication of a new generation of metallic implant coatings.

Hybrid systems, that simultaneously use PLD processes as well as magnetron pulverisation, are already being implemented [2]. A major problem with HIPIMS and PLD hybrid systems is the deposition of the vapours of the energetic plasma on the access window. We propose a method of realizing a hybrid system HIPIMS + PLD in which the windows are protected by magnetic fields similar to the methods presented in [3]. Thus by using such hybrid system proprieties of thin layer could be improved. 1. K. Sarakinos, J.Alami, S. Konstabtinidis, Surf. Coat. Techn. 204. (1661) 2010 2.

The HiPIMS deposited films are always denser, with a smoother surface and are magnetically softer than dcMS deposited films for otherwise the same deposition conditions. The obliquely deposited HiPIMS film is significantly more uniform in terms of thickness. The cross-sectional SEM images reveal that the dcMS deposited film under 70 degrees tilt angle consists of well defined inclined columnar grains while grains of HiPIMS deposited films are smaller and less tilted. Both deposition methods result in in-plane isotropic magnetic behavior at small tilt angles while larger tilt angles result in uniaxial magnetic anisotropy. The transition tilt angle from isotropic to uniaxial anisotropy varies with the deposition method and is measured around 35 degrees for dcMS and 60 degrees for HiPIMS.\n\nJ.P.I.49 16:30\n\nAuthors : A.

In radio frequency magnetron sputtering discharges are currently generated, on different type of substrates, such bioceramic layers with optimal adhesion properties either using pretreatment methods or interlayers. Our previous results [2] showed that the thermal patterning of the polymeric substrate during the rf magnetron plasma deposition process of calcium phosphate assured a good adherence of the deposited layers. By switching the plasma at each ten minutes, the temperature at the polymeric substrate didn?t exceed 100 0C. In this work the influence of the cooling of the polymeric substrate on the physicochemical and morphological features of calcium phosphate layers will be analysed. Measurements on the adhesion of the coatings generated on both metallic and polymeric substrates will be performed.

Depending on the nature of the physical interactions and the process conditions used, due to the heteroatoms present in the polymer chains, some recombination and/or degradation reactions can occur. The consequent structure alterations can also imply a more complex mechanism of the polymer chains’ transfer during vaporization, sputtering or ablation process, than previously has been thought. Therefore, the aim of our work was to obtain EVA (poly(ethylene-co-vinyl acetate)) thin films using various physical methods, such as PLD, PED, MS and MAPLE, and evaluate their utility in terms of preservation of the copolymer chemical structure. The structure of the films was analyzed using IR and XPS spectroscopy. The morphology of the films was evaluated by SEM and AFM methods.\n\nJ.P.I.51 16:30\n\nAuthors : N. Laidani*, G. Gottardi, R.

In the case of diamond-like carbons (DLC), pulsed plasmas offer valuable opportunities to obtain highly energetic conditions to grow hard films at viable low deposition temperature. In this work, DLC films were grown both by RF sputtering in Ar-H2 and by plasma-assisted chemical vapor deposition in CH4-CO2. In the first case, pulsing was employed by modulating the RF power applied to the target with frequencies in the range (1-100 kHz) while in the latter case a bi-polar biasing (+/-) was applied to the substrates. The films were characterized for their chemical, structural, optical and mechanical properties in relation with the pulsing conditions. Plasma ion population was determined by means of Langmuir probe diagnostics. Improved film hardness and density together with reduced structural defects were observed with respect to the continuous RF wave or to the continuous negative bias voltage conditions. Strong correlations were found between, on one hand, the plasma ion-population composition changes upon pulsing or the energetic conditions at the substrate upon pulsed biasing and, on the other hand, the film properties modification.\n\nJ.P.I.52"
