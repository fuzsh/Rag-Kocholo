        "text": "The King's favorite daughter, Princess Fa-Ying (Melissa Campbell), dies of cholera. Yet she appears after her death with the rest of the royal family briefly aboard the royal steamboat as the King attempts to take the royal family to safety from the insurgents marching toward the palace. Then, after the ship lands, the King and family pray at a shrine to Buddha, and Princess Fa-Ying is again seen with the rest of the children as the insurgents approach from the other side of the river.\n\nAfter the fight between Prince Chulalongkorn and Louis, King Mongkut goes and investigates the reason for the fight; he sees Louis writing lines and his son just standing there. Chulalongkorn is on Anna's right while Louis is on her left. Later, when Louis is finished writing his lines he is on her right and the prince is on her left.\n\nUpon introducing his queens and concubines to Anna, Mongkut states that his concubines are not as numerous as those of the Emperor of China.\n\nEmperor Tongzhi was 5 years old at his ascension. Tongzhi married Empress Xiaozheyi and two official concubines in 1872 at the age of 16. He later married two more Official Concubines before his death from smallpox at age 18 in 1872, which is four Concubines. Tongzhi preferred the company of his wife, Empress Xiaozheyi, to that of any of his four Concubines.\n\nAnna tells the king that she has been thinking of many journeys that go nowhere and she asks what Buddha would say to that. The king says, \"Roads are for journeys, not for destinations.\" The correct quote is, \"Roads were made for journeys, not destinations.\" This quote was not from Buddha, but from Confucius.\n\nLouis finds his father's military tunic in a trunk. He also has his father's army bugle. Louis' father was not a Major, he was actually a Sapper, which is the British Engineer's equivalent of a Private. Sappers are soldiers who work in the Engineer Brigades to build roads, buildings, earthworks, breachwork and the like. They are also trained as provisional, or secondary Infantry. As such, there is no reason why his father would have had a bugle. The idea that he had been a Major was an invention of Anna Leonowens. At the time of his death, Thomas Leonowens was working in Penang as a hotel keeper. He died between the last couple of days in April 1859 to the first week of May 1859 and was buried in the Protestant Cemetery in Penang on May 7, 1859."
