        "text": "Dear community,\n\nToday we would like to share with you some updates from our FoPay Merchant Platform and to tell you the story of Pannarai Clinic and to welcome them as a new official merchant!\n\nPannarai Clinic is the beauty and skin care institute, which provide quality service and best customer experience to its clients. And the point of care they concern is described by their slogan in the best way: “Pannarai Clinic gives you more than just beautiful words”.\n\nIn modern world one must never forget that even quality market offer might not be successful it doesn’t fit market needs. In the context of total globalization, businesses must adopt faster than whenever in order to be successful. It is absolutely crucial nowadays, regardless of the size of the business and the sphere where it operates.\n\nOur team believes that actions mean more than words. So as an example, we may observe how Pannarai Clinic has started selling quality face masks to help their customers from Thailand to protect themselves and their families of COVID-19.\n\nThat kind of approach to business defines successful. So, we are glad to announce that the Pannarai Clinic has become an official FoPay merchant! As a result, the Pannarai Clinic is getting even closer to its clients by starting accepting cryptocurrency as a payment method.\n\nThe Pannarai Clinic has plans to continue expanding their business and cryptocurrency will be one of the tools which allow to achieve this goal. As no matter, would it be sale of goods or services, FoPay payment gateway will be a sufficient solution which makes payment and exchange process easy and fast.\n\nBut what can tell more about business and its qualities than the position and the attitude of its management and owner. So, we asked about that Dr. Punpimol — the CEO and co-owner of the Pannarai Clinic.\n\nWe asked her of what she think of the use of cryptocurrency payments in their business:\n\n— I am certain that using Cryptocurrencies at the Clinic will be highly demanded as it is a new and safe payment option. This gateway will make my clinic widely recognized and will allow to attract new customers from the market.\n\nDr. Punpimol told us about future plans of Pannarai Clinic and her expectations:\n\n— I believe that in future Cryptocurrencies will be globally recognized. I plan to implement cryptocurrency payment option, as it is becoming a new payment solution, which, in my opinion, will replace cash. Thus, payments will become more convenient, fast and easy. Moreover, they will be safe and reliable. The greatest advantage of Cryptocurrencies is they are, basically, Fee-Free. That would allow customers to save money while having overseas transaction compared to the existing bank fees.\n\nWe also asked about her about her message to the entrepreneurs who still does not implement cryptocurrency payments to improve customer experience:\n\n— I found out about Cryptocurrency from my business group, which achieved a huge success of using it. To be honest, I am amazed and intrigued. Therefore, I conducted my personal research to learn more about crypto payments. Cryptocurrencies are not only a cashless payment method, but also a way to connect business all over the world in a more convenient and safe way. Once you have a closer look on Cryptocurrencies, you will definitely enjoy using it.\n\nAs it is said “Whenever you see a successful business, someone once made a courageous decision”. We believe that’s the case with Pannarai Clinic. And partnership with FoPay will give their business a new incentive for growth.\n\nFoPay team congratulates Pannarai Clinic on becoming a part of our expanding merchant community. We wish them to reach new heights!\n\nLinks to know more about Pannarai Clinic:"
