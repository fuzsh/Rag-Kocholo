        "text": "OF Somdetch Phra Paramendr Maha Mongkut, late supreme king of Siam, it may safely be said (for all his capricious provocations of temper and his snappish greed of power) that he was, in the best sense of the epithet, the most remarkable of the Oriental princes of the present century,—unquestionably the most distinguished of all the supreme rulers of Siam, of whom the native historians enumerate not less than forty, reckoning from the founding of the ancient capital (Ayudia or Ayuo-deva, \"the abode of gods”) in A. D. 1350.\n\nHe was the legitimate son of the king Phra Chou-Phra Pooti-lootlah ; and his mother, daughter of the youngest sister of the King Somdetch Phra Bouromah Rajah Phra Pooti Yout Fall, was one of the most admired princesses of her time, and is described as equally beautiful and virtuous. She devoted herself assiduously to the education of her sons, of whom the second, the subject of these notes, was born in 1804 ; and the youngest, her best beloved, was the late second king of Siam.\n\nOne of the first public acts of the King Phra Pooti-lootlah was to elevate to the highest honors of the state his eldest son (the Chowfa Mongkut), and proclaim him heir-apparent to the throne. He then selected twelve noblemen, distinguished for their attainments, prudence, and virtue, -— most conspicuous among them the venerable but energetic Duke Somdetch Ong Yai, — to be tutors and guardians to the lad. By these he was carefully taught in all the learning of his time ; Sanskrit and Pali formed his chief study, and from the first he aspired to proficiency in Latin and English, for the pursuit of which he soon found opportunities among the missionaries. His translations from the Sanskrit, Pali, and Magadthi mark him as an authority among Oriental linguists ; and his knowledge of English, though never perfect, became at least extensive and varied; so that he could correspond, with credit to himself, with Englishmen of distinction, such as the Earl of Clarendon and Lords Stanley and Russell.\n\nIn his eighteenth year he married a noble lady, descended from the Phya Tak Sinn, who bore him two sons.\n\nTwo years later the throne became vacant by the death of his father; but his elder half-brother, who, through the intrigues of his mother, had secured a footing in the favor of the Senabawdee, was inducted by that “Royal Council” into power, with the title of Prabat Somdetch Phra Nang Klou. Unequal to the exploit of unseating the usurper, and fearing his unscrupulous jealousy, the Chowfa Mongkut took refuge in a monastery, and entered the priesthood, leaving his wife and two sons to mourn him as one dead to them. In this self-imposed celibacy he lived throughout the long reign of his half-brother, which lasted twenty-seven years.\n\nIn the calm retreat of his Buddhist cloister the contemplative tastes of the royal scholar found fresh entertainment, his intellectual aspirations a new incitement.\n\nHe labored with enthusiasm for the diffusion of religion and enlightenment, and, above all, to promote a higher appreciation of the teachings of Buddha, to whose doctrines he devoted himself with exemplary zeal throughout his sacerdotal career. From the Buddhist scriptures he compiled with reverent care an impressive liturgy for his own use. His private charities amounted annually to ten thousand ticals. All the fortune he accumulated, from the time of his quitting the court until his return to it, to accept the diadem offered by the Senabawdee, he expended either in charitable distributions or in the purchase of books, sacred manuscripts, and relics for his monastery.\n\nIt was during his retirement that he wrote that notable treatise in defence of the divinity of the revelations of Buddha, in which he essays to prove that it was the single aim of the great reformer to deliver man from all selfish and carnal passions, and in which he uses these words : “ These are the\n\nonly obstacles in the search for Truth. The most solid wisdom is to know this, and to apply one’s self to the conquest of one’s self. This it is to become the enlightened—the Buddha!” And he concludes with the remark of Asoka, the Indian king : “ That which has been delivered unto us by Buddha, that alone is well said, and worthy of our soul’s profoundest homage.”\n\nIn the pursuit of his appointed ends Maha Mongkut was active and pertinacious ; no labors wearied him nor pains deterred him. Before the arrival of the Protestant missionaries, in 1820, he had acquired some knowledge of Latin and the sciences from the Jesuits ; but when the Protestants came he manifested a positive preference for their methods of instruction, inviting one or another of them daily to his temple, to aid him in the study of English. Finally he placed himself under the permanent tutorship of the Rev. Mr. Caswell, an American missionary ; and in order to encourage his preceptor to visit him frequently, he fitted up a convenient resting-place for him on the route to the temple, where that excellent man might teach the poorer people who gathered to hear him. Under Mr. Caswell he made extraordinary progress in advanced and liberal ideas of government, commerce, even religion. He never hesitated to express his respect for the fundamental principles of Christianity; but once, when pressed too closely by his reverend moonshee with what he regarded as the more pretentious and apocryphal portions of the Bible, he checked that gentleman’s advance with the remark that has ever been remembered against him, “I hate the Bible mostly ! ”\n\nAs High-Priest of Siam —the mystic and potential office to which he was in the end exalted — he became the head of a new school, professing strictly the pure philosophy inculcated by Buddha : “the law of Compensation, of Many Births, and of final Niphan,” — but not Nihilism, as the word and the idea are commonly defined. It is only to the idea of God as an ever-active Creator that the new school of Buddhists is opposed, — not to the Deity as a primal source, from whose thought and pleasure sprang all forms of matter ; nor can they be brought to admit the need of miraculous intervention in the order of nature.\n\nIn this connection, it may not be out of place to mention a remark that the king (still speaking as a high-priest, having authority) once made to me, on the subject of the miracles recorded in the Bible : —\n\n“You say that marriage is a holy institution ; and I believe it is esteemed a sacrament by one of the principal branches of your sect. It is, of all the laws of the universe, the most wise and incontestable, pervading all forms of animal and vegetable life. Yet your God (meaning the Christian’s God) has stigmatized it as unholy, in that he would not permit his Son to be born in the ordinary way ; but must needs perform a miracle in order to give birth to one divinely inspired. Buddha was divinely inspired, but he was only man. Thus it seems to me he is the greater of the two, because out of his own heart he studied humanity, which is but another form of divinity ; and, the carnal mind being by this contemplation subdued, he became the Divinely Enlightened.”\n\nWhen his teacher had begun to entertain hopes that he would one day become a Christian, he came out openly against the idea, declaring that he entertained no thought of such a change. He admonished the missionaries not to deceive themselves, saying : “You must not imagine that any of my party will ever become Christians. We cannot embrace what we consider a foolish religion.”\n\nIn the beginning of the year 1851 his supreme majesty, Prabat Somdetch Phra Nang Klou, fell ill, and gradually declined until the 3d of April, when he expired, and the throne was again vacant. The dying sovereign urged with all his influence that the succession should fall to his eldest son ; but in the assembly of the Senabawdee, Somdetch Ong Yai (father of the present Prime Minister of Siam), supported by Somdetch Ong Noi, vehemently declared himself in favor of the highpriest Chowfa Mongkut.\n\nThis struck terror to the “ illegitimates,” and mainly availed to quell the rising storm of partisan conflict. Moreover, Ong Yai had taken the precaution to surround the persons of the princes with a formidable guard, and to distribute an overwhelming force of militia in all quarters of the city, ready for instant action at a signal from him.\n\nOn the morning of the 3d of April, after being formally apprised of his election, the Chowfa was borne in state to a residence adjoining the Phra Sâât, to await the auspicious day of coronation,— the 15th of the following month, as fixed by the court astrologers ; and when it came it was hailed by all classes of the people with immoderate demonstrations of joy ; for to their priest king, more sacred than a conqueror, they were drawn by bonds of superstition as well as of pride and affection.\n\nThe ceremony of coronation is very peculiar.\n\nIn the centre of the Inner Hall of Audience of the royal palace, on a high platform, richly gilded and adorned, is placed a circular golden basin, called in the court language Mangala Bhagavat thong, — \"the Golden Circlet of Power.” Within this basin is deposited the ancient Phra-Batt, or golden stool, the whole being surmounted by a quadrangular canopy, under a tapering, nine-storied umbrella in the form of a pagoda, from ten to twelve feet high, and profusely gilt. Directly over the centre of the canopy is deposited a vase containing consecrated waters, which have been prayed over nine times, and poured through nine different circular vessels in their passage to the sacred receptacle. These waters must be drawn from the very sources of the chief rivers of Siam; and reservoirs for their preservation are provided in the precincts of the temples at Bangkok.\n\nIn the mouth of this vessel is a tube representing the pericarp of a lotos after its petals have fallen off; and this, called Sukla Utapala Atmano, “ the White Lotos of Life,” symbolizes the beauty of pure conduct.\n\nThe king elect, arrayed in a simple white robe, takes his seat on the golden stool. A Brahmin priest then presents to him some water in a small cup of gold, lotos-shaped. This water has previously been filtered through nine different forms of matter, commencing with earth, then ashes, wheaten flour, rice flour, powdered lotos and jessamine, dust of iron, gold, and charcoal, and finally flame ; each a symbol, not merely of the indestructibility of element, but also of its presence in all animate or inanimate matter. Into this water the king elect dips his right hand, and passes it over his head. Immediately the choir join in an inspiring chant, the signal for the inverting, by means of a pulley, of the vessel over the canopy ; and the consecrated waters descend through another lotos flower, in a lively shower, on the head of the king. This shower represents celestial blessings.\n\nA Buddhist priest then advances and pours a goblet of water over the royal person. He is imitated, first by the Brahmin priests, next by the princes and princesses royal. The vessels used for this purpose are of the chank or conch shell, richly ornamented. Then come the nobles of highest rank, bearing cups of gold, silver, earthenware, pinchbeck, samil, and tankwah (metallic compositions peculiar to Siam). The materials of which the vessels for this royal bath are composed must be of not less than seven kinds. Last of all, the Prime Minister of the realm advances with a cup of iron ; and the sacred bath is finished.\n\nNow the king descends into the golden basin, “ Mangala Bhagavat thong,” where he is anointed with nine varieties of perfumed oil, and dipped in fine dust brought from the bed of the Ganges. He is then arrayed in regal robes.\n\nOn the throne, which is in the south end of the hall, and octagonal, having eight seats, corresponding to eight points of the compass, the king first seats himself facing the north, and so on, moving eastward, facing each point in its order. On the top step of each seat crouch two priests, Buddhist and Brahmin, who present to him another bowl of water, which he drinks and sprinkles on his face, each time repeating, by responses with the priests, the following prayer : —\n\nPriests. Be thou learned in the laws of nature, and of the universe !\n\nKing. Inspire me, O Thou who wert a law unto thyself!\n\nP. Be thou endowed with all wisdom, and all acts of industry !\n\nK. Inspire me with all knowledge, O Thou the Enlightened !\n\nP. Let Mercy and Truth be thy right and left arms of life !\n\nK. Inspire me, O Thou who hast proved all Truth and all Mercy!\n\nP. Let the Sun, Moon, and Stars bless thee !\n\nK. All praise to Thee, through whom all forms are conquered !\n\nP. Let the earth, air, and waters bless thee !\n\nK. Through the merit of Thee, O thou conqueror of Death !\n\nThese prayers ended, the priests conduct the king to another throne, facing the east, and still more magnificent. Here the insignia of his sovereignty are presented to him ; —first the sword, then the sceptre; two massive chains are suspended from his neck ; and lastly the crown is set upon his head, when instantly he is saluted by roar of cannon without and music within.\n\nThen he is presented with the golden slippers, the fan, the umbrella of royalty, rings set with huge diamonds for each of his forefingers, and the various Siamese weapons of war: these he merely accepts, and returns to his attendants.\n\nThe ceremony concludes with an address from the priests, exhorting him to be pure in his sovereign and sacred office ; and a reply from himself, wherein he solemnly vows to be a just, upright, and faithful ruler of his people. Last of all, a golden tray is handed to him, from which, as he descends from his throne, he scatters gold and silver flowers among the audience.\n\nThe following day is devoted to a more public enthronement. His Majesty, attired more sumptuously than before, is presented to all his court and to a more general audience. After the customary salutations by prostration, and salutes of cannon and music, the Premier and other principal ministers read short addresses, in delivering over to the king the control of their respective departments. His Majesty replies briefly ; there is a general salute from all forts, war vessels, and merchant shipping ; and the remainder of the day is devoted to feasting and various enjoyment.\n\nImmediately after the crowning of Maha Mongkut, his Majesty repaired to the palace of the Second King, where the ceremony of subordinate coronation differed from that just described only in the circumstance that the consecrated waters were poured over the person of the second king, and the insignia presented to him, by the supreme sovereign.\n\nFive days later a public procession made the circuit of the palace and city walls in a peculiar circumambulatory march of mystic significance, with feasting, dramatic entertainments, and fireworks. The concourse assembled to take part in those brilliant demonstrations has never since been equalled in any public display in Siam.\n\nThus the two royal brothers, with views more liberal, as to religion, education, foreign trade, and intercourse, than the most enlightened of their predecessors had entertained, were firmly seated on the throne ; and every citizen, native or foreign, began to look with confidence for the dawn of better times.\n\nNor did the newly crowned sovereign forget his friends and teachers, the American missionaries. He sent for them, and thanked them cordially for all that they had taught him, assuring them that it was his earnest desire to administer his government after the model of the limited monarchy of England ; and to introduce schools, where the Siamese youth might be well taught in the English language and literature, and the sciences of Europe.\n\nThere can be no just doubt that, at the time, it was his sincere purpose to carry these generous impulses into practical effect ; for certainly he was, in every moral and intellectual respect, nobly superior to his predecessor ; and to his dying hour he was conspicuous for his attachment to a sound philosophy and the purest maxims of Buddha. Yet we find in him a deplorable example of the degrading influence on the human mind of the greed of possessions and power, and of the infelicities that attend it ; for though he promptly set about the reforming of abuses in the several departments of his government, and invited the ladies of the American mission to teach in his new harem, nevertheless he soon began to indulge his avaricious and sensual propensities, and cast a jealous eye upon the influence of the prime minister, the son of his stanch old friend, the Duke Ong Yai, to whom he owed almost the crown itself, and of his younger brother, the second king, and of the neighboring princes of Chiengmai and Cochin-China. He presently offended those who, by their resolute display of loyalty in his hour of peril, had seated him safely on the throne of his ancestors.\n\nFrom this time he was continually exposed to disappointment, mortification, slights from abroad, and conspiracy at home. Had it not been for the steadfast adherence of the second king and the prime minister, the sceptre would have been wrested from his grasp and bestowed upon his more popular brother.\n\nYet notwithstanding all this, he appeared, to those who observed him only on the public stage of affairs, to rule with wisdom, to consult the welfare of his subjects, to be concerned for the integrity of justice and the purity of manners and conversation in his own court, and careful, by a prudent administration, to confirm his power at home and his prestige abroad. Considered apart from his domestic relations, he was, in many respects, an able and virtuous ruler. His foreign policy was liberal; he extended toleration to all religious sects ; he expended a generous portion of his revenues in public improvements ; monasteries, temples, bazaars, canals, bridges, arose at his bidding on every side ; and though he fell short of his early promise, he did much to improve the condition of his subjects.\n\nFor example, at the instance of her Britannic Majesty’s Consul, the Honorable Thomas George Knox, he removed the heavy boat-tax that had so oppressed the poorer masses of the Siamese, and constructed good roads, and improved the international chambers of judicature.\n\nBut, as husband and kinsman his character assumes a most revolting aspect. Envious, revengeful, subtle, he was as fickle and petulant as he was suspicious and cruel. His brother, even the offspring of his brother, became to him objects of jealousy, if not of hatred. Their friends must, he thought, be his enemies ; and applause bestowed upon them was odious to his soul. There were many horrid tragedies in his harem, in which he enacted the part of a barbarian and a despot. Plainly, his conduct, as the head of a great family to whom his will was a law of terror, reflects abiding disgrace upon his name. Yet it had this redeeming feature, that he tenderly loved those of his children whose mothers had been agreeable to him. He never snubbed or slighted them ; and for the little princess, Chowfa-Ying, whose mother had been to him a most gentle and devoted wife, his affection was very strong and enduring.\n\nBut to turn from the contemplation of his private traits, so contradictory and offensive, to the consideration of his public acts, so liberal and beneficent. Several commercial treaties of the first importance were concluded with foreign powers during his reign. In the first place, the Siamese government voluntarily reduced the measurement duties on foreign shipping, from nineteen hundred to one thousand ticals per fathom of ship’s beam. This was a brave stride in the direction of a sound commercial policy, and an earnest of greater inducements to enterprising traders from abroad. In 1855 a new treaty of commerce was negotiated with his Majesty’s government by H. B. M.’s plenipotentiary, Sir John Bowring, which proved of very positive advantage to both parties. On the 29th of May, 1856, a new treaty, substantially like that with Great Britain, was procured by Townsend Harris, Esq., representing the United States ; and later in the same year still another, in favor of France, through H. I. M.’s Envoy, M. Montigny.\n\nBefore that time Portugal had been the only foreign government having a consul residing at Bangkok. Now the way was opened to admit a resident consul of each of the treaty powers ; and shortly millions of dollars flowed into Siam annually by channels through which but a few tens of thousands had been drawn before. Foreign traders and merchants flocked to Bangkok and established rice-mills, factories for the production of sugar and oil, and warehouses for the importation of European fabrics. They found a ready market for their wares, and an aspect of thrift and comfort began to enliven the once neglected and cheerless land.\n\nA new and superb palace was erected, after the model of Windsor Castle, together with numerous royal residences in different parts of the country. The nobility began to emulate the activity and munificence of their sovereign, and to compete with each other in the grandeur of their dwellings and the splendor of their cortèges.\n\nSo prosperous did the country become under the benign influence of foreign trade and civilization, that other treaties were speedily concluded with almost every nation under the sun, and his Majesty found it necessary to accredit Sir John Bowring as plenipotentiary for Siam abroad.\n\nEarly in this reign the appointment of harbor-master at Bangkok was conferred upon an English gentleman, who proved so efficient in his functions that he was distinguished with the fifth title of a Siamese noble. Next came a French commander and a French band-master for the royal troops. Then a customhouse was established, and a “ live Yankee ” installed at the head of it, who was also glorified with a title of honor. Finally a police force was organized, composed of trusty Malays hired from Singapore, and commanded by one of the most energetic Englishmen to be found in the East, — a measure which has done more than all others to promote a comfortable sense of \"law and order ” throughout the city and outskirts of Bangkok. It is to be remembered, however, in justice to the British Consul-General in Siam, Mr. Thomas George Knox, that the sure though silent influence was his, whereby the minds of the king and the prime minister were led to appreciate the benefits that must accrue from these foreign innovations.\n\nThe privilege of constructing, on liberal terms, a line of telegraph through Maulmain to Singapore, with a branch to Bangkok, has been granted to the Singapore Telegraph Company ; and finally, a sanatarium has been erected on the coast at Anghin, for the benefit of native and foreign residents needing the invigoration of sea-air.\n\nDuring his retirement in the monastery the king had a stroke of paralysis, from which he perfectly recovered ; but it left its mark on his face, in the form of a peculiar falling of the under lip on the right side. In person he was of middle stature, slightly built, of regular features and fair complexion. In early life he lost most of his teeth, but he had had them replaced with a set made from Japan wood, — a secret that he kept very sensitively to the day of his death.\n\nCapable at times of the noblest impulses, he was equally capable of the basest actions. Extremely accessible to praise, he indiscriminately entertained every form of flattery; but his fickleness was such that no courtier could cajole him long. Among his favorite women was the beautiful Princess Tongoo Soopia, sister to the unfortunate Sultan Mahmoud, ex-rajah of Pahang. Falling fiercely in love with her on her presentation at his court, he procured her for his harem, against her will, and as a hostage for the good faith of her brother ; but as she, being Mohammedan, ever maintained toward him a deportment of tranquil indifference, he soon tired of her, and finally dismissed her to a wretched life of obsoleteness and neglect within the palace walls.\n\nThe only woman who ever managed him with acknowledged success was Khoon Chom Piem : hardly pretty, but well formed, and of versatile tact, totally uneducated, of barely respectable birth, — being Chinese on her father’s side, — yet withal endowed with a nice intuitive appreciation of character. Once conscious of her growing influence over the king, she contrived to foster and exercise it for years, with but a slight rebuff now and then. Being modest to a fault, even at times obnoxious to the imputation of prudishness, she habitually feigned excuses for non-attendance in his Majesty’s chambers, — such as delicate health, the nursing of her children, mourning for the death of this or that relative, — and voluntarily visited him only at rare intervals. In the course of six years she amassed considerable treasure, procured good places at court for members of her family, and was the means of bringing many Chinamen to the notice of the king. At the same time she lived in continual fear, was warily humble and conciliating toward her rival sisters, who pitied rather than envied her, and retained in her pay most of the female executive force in the palace.\n\nIn his daily habits his Majesty was remarkably industrious and frugal. His devotion to the study of astronomy never abated, and he calculated with respectable accuracy the great solar eclipse of August, 1868.\n\nThe French government having sent a special commission, under command of the Baron Hugon le Tourneur, to observe the eclipse in Siam, the king erected, at a place called Hua Wânn (“the Whale’s Head”) a commodious observatory, beside numerous pavilions varying in size and magnificence, for his Majesty and retinue, the French commission, the Governor of Singapore (Colonel Ord) and suite, who had been invited to Bangkok by the king, and for ministers and nobles of Siam. Provision was made, at the cost of government, for the regal entertainment, in a town of booths and tabernacles, of the vast concourse of natives and Europeans who followed his Majesty from the capital to witness the sublime phenomenon ; and a herd of fifty noble elephants were brought from the ancient city of Ayudia for service and display.\n\nThe prospect becoming dubious and gloomy just at the time of first contact (ten o’clock), the Prime Minister archly invited the foreigners who believed in an overruling Providence to pray to him, “ that he may be pleased to disperse the clouds long enough to afford us a good view of the grandest of eclipses.” Presently the clouds were partially withdrawn from the sun, and his Majesty observing that one twentieth of the disk was obscured, announced the fact to his own people by firing a cannon ; and immediately pipes screamed and trumpets blared in the royal pavilion, — a tribute of reverence to the traditional fable about the Angel Rahoo swallowing the sun. Both the king and prime minister, scorning the restraints of dignity, were fairly boisterous in their demonstrations of triumph and delight; the latter skipping from point to point to squint through his long telescope. At the instant of absolute totality, when the very last ray of the sun had become extinct, his Excellency shouted, “Hurrah! hurrah! hurrah !” and scientifically disgraced himself. Leaving his spyglass swinging, he ran through the gateway of his pavilion, and cried to his prostrate wives, “ Henceforth, will you not believe the foreigners ? ”\n\nBut that other Excellency, Chow Phya Bhudharabhay, Minister for Northern Siam, more orthodox, sat in dumfoundered faith, and gaped at the awful deglutition of the Angel Rahoo.\n\nThe government expended not less than one hundred thousand dollars on this scientific expedition, and a delegation from the foreign community of Bangkok approached his Majesty with an address of thanks for his indiscriminate hospitality.\n\nBut the extraordinary excitement, and exposure to the noxious atmosphere of the jungle, proved inimical to the constitution of the king. On his return to Bangkok he complained of general weariness and prostration, which was the prelude to fever. Foreign physicians were consulted, but at no stage of the case was any European treatment employed. He rapidly grew worse, and was soon past saving. On the day before his death he called to his bedside his nearest relatives, and parted among them such of his personal effects as were most prized by him, saying, “ I have no more need of these things. I must give up my life also.” Buddhist priests were constant in attendance, and he seemed to derive much comfort from their prayers and exhortations. In the evening he wrote with his own hand a tender farewell to the mothers of his many children, — eighty-one in number. On the morning of his last day (October 1, 1868) he dictated in the Pali language a farewell address to the Buddhist priesthood, the spirit of which was admirable, and clearly manifested the faith of the dying man in the doctrines of the Reformer; for he hesitated not to say : “ Farewell, ye faithful followers of Buddha, to whom death is nothing, even as all earthly existence is vain, all things mutable, and death inevitable. Presently I shall myself submit to that stern necessity. Farewell! for I go only a little before you.”\n\nFeeling sure that be must die before midnight, he summoned his royal halfbrother, H. R. H. Krom Hluang Wongsah, his Excellency the Prime Minister, Chow Phya Kralahome, and others, and solemnly imposed upon them the care of his eldest son, the Chowfa Chulalonkorn, and of his kingdom ; at the same time expressing his last earthly wish, that the Senabawdee, in electing his successor, would give their voices for one who should conciliate all parties, that the country might not be distracted by dissensions on that question. He then told them he was about to finish his course, and implored them not to give way to grief, “ nor to any sudden surprise,” that he should leave them thus ; “ ’t is an event that must befall all creatures that come into this world, and may not be avoided.” Then turning his gaze upon a small image of his adored Teacher, he seemed for some time absorbed in awful contemplation. “Such is life!” Those were actually the last words of this most remarkable Buddhist king. He died like a philosopher, calmly and sententiously soliloquizing on death and its inevitability. At the final moment, no one being near save his adopted son, Phya Buroot, he raised his hands before his face, as in his accustomed posture of devotion ; then suddenly his head dropped backward, and he was gone.\n\nThat very night, without disorder or debate, the Senabawdee elected his eldest son, Somdetch Chowfa Chulalonkorn, to succeed him ; and the Prince George Washington, eldest son of the late second king, to succeed to his father’s subordinate throne, under the title of Krom Phra Raja Bowawn Sahthan Mongkoon. The title of the present supreme king (my amiable and very promising scholar) is Prabat Somdetch Phra Paramendr Maha Chulalonkorn Kate Klou Chou-yu-Hua.\n\n“Do you understand the word ' charity,’ or maitree, as your apostle St. Paul explains it in the thirteenth chapter of his first epistle to the Corinthians ? ” said his Majesty to me one morning, when he had been discussing the religion of Sakyamuni, the Buddha.\n\n“ I believe I do, your Majesty,” was my reply.\n\n“ Then, tell me, what does St. Paul really mean, to what custom does he allude, when he says, ‘ Even if I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing ? ’ ”\n\n“ Custom! ” said I. “ I do not know of any custom. The giving of the body to be burned is by him esteemed the highest act of devotion, the purest sacrifice man can make for man.”\n\n“ You have said well. It is the highest act of devotion that can be made, or performed, by man for man, — that giving of his body to be burned. But if it is done from a spirit of opposition, for the sake of fame, or popular applause, or for any other such motive, is it still to be regarded as the highest act of sacrifice ? ”\n\n“ That is just what St. Paul means : the motive consecrates the deed.”\n\n“ But all men are not fortified with the self-control which should fit them to be great exemplars ; and of the many who have appeared in that character, if strict inquiry were made, their virtue would be found to proceed from any other than the true and pure spirit. Sometimes it is indolence, sometimes restlessness, sometimes vanity, impatient for its gratification, and rushing to assume the part of humility for the purpose of self-delusion.”\n\n“ Now,” said the king, taking several of his long strides in the vestibule of his library, and declaiming with his habitual emphasis, “St. Paul, in this chapter, evidently and strongly applies the Buddhist’s word maitree, or maikree, as pronounced by some Sanskrit scholars ; and explains it through the Buddhist’s custom of giving the body to be burned, which was practised centuries before the Christian era, and is found unchanged in parts of China, Ceylon, and Siam, to this day. The giving of the body to be burned has ever been considered by devout Buddhists the most exalted act of self-abnegation.\n\n“ To give all one’s goods to feed the poor is common in this country, with princes and people, — who often keep back nothing (not even one cowree, the thousandth part of a cent) to provide for themselves a handful of rice. But then they stand in no fear of starvation ; for death by hunger is unknown where Buddhism is preached and practised.\n\n“ I know a man, of royal parentage, and once possessed of untold riches. In his youth he felt such pity for the poor, the old, the sick, and such as were troubled and sorrowful, that he became melancholy, and after spending several years in the continual relief of the needy and helpless, he, in a moment, gave all his goods, in a word ALL, ' to feed the poor.’ This man has never heard of St. Paul or his writings ; but he knows, and tries to comprehend in its fulness, the Buddhist word maitree.\n\n“At thirty he became a priest. For five years he had toiled as a gardener ; for that was the occupation he preferred, because in the pursuit of it he acquired much useful knowledge of the medicinal properties of plants, and so became a ready physician to those who could not pay for their healing. But he could not rest content with so imperfect a life, while the way to perfect knowledge of excellence, truth, and charity remained open to him ; so he became a priest.\n\n“ This happened sixty-five years ago. Now he is ninety-five years old; and, I fear, has not yet found the truth and excellence he has been in search of so long. But I know no greater man than he. He is great in the Christian sense, loving, pitiful, forbearing, pure.\n\n“ Once, when he was a gardener, he was robbed of his few poor tools by one whom he had befriended in many ways. Some time after that, the king met him, and inquired of his necessities. He said he needed tools for his gardening. A great abundance of such implements was sent to him ; and immediately he shared them with his neighbors, taking care to send the most and best to the man who had robbed him.\n\n“ Of the little that remained to him, he gave freely to all who lacked. Not his own, but another’s wants, were his sole argument in asking or bestowing. Now, he is great in the Buddhist sense, also, — not loving life nor fearing death, desiring nothing the world can give, beyond the peace of a beatified spirit. This man — who is now the HighPriest of Siam — would, without so much as a thought of shrinking, give his body, alive or dead, to be burned, if so he might obtain one glimpse of eternal truth, or save one soul from death or sorrow.”\n\nMore than eighteen months after the first king of Siam had entertained me with this essentially Buddhistic argument, and its simple and impressive illustration, a party of pages hurried me away with them, just as the setting sun was trailing his last long, lingering shadows through the porches of the palace. His Majesty required my presence ; and his Majesty’s commands were absolute and instant. “Find and fetch!” No delay was to be thought of, no question answered, no explanation afforded, no excuse entertained. So, with resignation I followed my guides, who led the way to the monastery of Watt Rajah Bahdet Sang (“ Temple by order of the king”). But having some experience of the moods and humors of his Majesty, my mind was not wholly free from uneasiness. Generally, such impetuous summoning foreboded an interview the reverse of agreeable.\n\nThe sun had set in glory below the red horizon, when I entered the extensive range of monastic buildings that adjoin the temple. Wide tracts of waving corn and avenues of oleanders screened from view the distant city, with its pagodas and palaces. The air was fresh and balmy, and seemed to sigh plaintively among the betel and cocoa palms that skirt the monastery.\n\nThe pages left me seated on a stone step, and ran to announce my presence to the king. Long after the moon had come out clear and cool, and I had begun to wonder where all this would end, a young man, robed in pure white, and bearing in one hand a small lighted taper, and a lily in the other, beckoned me to enter, and follow him ; and as we traversed the long, low passages that separate the cells of the priests, the weird sound of voices, chanting the hymns of the Buddhist liturgy, fell upon my ear. The darkness, the loneliness, the measured monotone, distant and dreamy, — all was most romantic and exciting, even to a matter-of-fact Englishwoman like myself.\n\nAs the page approached the threshold of one of the cells, he whispered to me in a voice full of entreaty to put off my shoes ; at the same time prostrating himself with a movement and expression of the most abject humility before the door, where he remained, without changing his posture. I stooped involuntarily, and scanned curiously, anxiously, the scene within the cell. There sat the king; and at a sign from him I presently entered, and sat down beside him.\n\nOn a rude pallet, about six and a half feet long, and not more than three feet wide, and with a bare block of wood for a pillow, lay a dying priest. A simple garment of faded yellow covered his person ; his hands were folded on his breast; his head was bald, and the few blanched hairs that might have remained to fringe his sunken temples had been carefully shorn, — his eyebrows, too, were closely shaven ; his feet were bare and exposed ; his eyes were fixed, not in the vacant stare of death, but with solemn contemplation or scrutiny, upward. No sign of disquiet was there, no external suggestion of pain or trouble ; I was at once startled and puzzled. Was he dying or acting ?\n\nIn the attitude of his person, in the expression of his countenance, I beheld sublime reverence, repose, absorption. He seemed to be communing with some spiritual presence.\n\nMy entrance and approach made no change in him. At his right side was a dim taper in a gold candlestick ; on the left a dainty golden vase, filled with white lilies, freshly gathered : these were offerings from the king. One of the lilies had been laid on his breast, and contrasted touchingly with the dingy, faded yellow of his robe. Just over the region of the heart lay a coil of unspun cotton thread, which, being divided into seventy-seven filaments, was distributed to the hands of priests, who, closely seated, quite filled the cell, so that none could have moved without difficulty. Before each priest were a lighted taper and a lily, symbols of faith and purity. From time to time one or other of that solemn company raised his voice, and chanted strangely ; and all the choir responded in unison. These were the words, as they were afterward translated for me by the king.\n\nFirst Voice. Sâng-Khâng sârâ nang gâch’ cha mi ! (Thou Excellence, or Perfection ! I take refuge in thee.)\n\nAll. Nama Poothô sang Khâng sârâ nang gâch’ châ mi ! (Thou who art named Pootho ! — Either God, Boodha, or Mercy, — I take refuge in thee.)\n\nFirst Voice. Tuti âmpi sang Khâng sârâ nang gâch’ châ mi ! (Thou Holy One ! I take refuge in thee.)\n\nAll. Tè sâtiyâ sang Khâng sârâ nang gâch’ châ mi ! (Thou Truth, I take refuge in thee.)\n\nAs the sound of the prayer fell on his ear, a flickering smile lit up the pale, sallow countenance of the dying man, with a visible mild radiance, as though the charity and humility of his nature, in departing, left the light of their loveliness there. The absorbing rapture of that look, which seemed to overtake the invisible, was almost too holy to gaze upon. Riches, station, honors, kindred, he had resigned them all, more than half a century since, in his love for the poor and his longing after truth. Here was none of the wavering or vagueness or incoherence of a wandering, delirious death. He was going to his clear, eternal calm. With a smile of perfect peace he said : “ To your Majesty I commend the poor ; and this that remains of me I give to be burned.” And that, his last gift, was indeed his all.\n\nI can imagine no spectacle more worthy to excite a compassionate emotion, to impart an abiding impression of reverence, than the tranquil dying of that good old “pagan.” Gradually his breathing became more laborious ; and presently, turning with a great effort toward the king, he said, Chan-chai pai damni ! — “I will go now!” Instantly the priests joined in a loud psalm and chant, “ Phra Arahang sang Khâng sârâ nang gâch’ châ mi! ” (Thou Sacred One, I take refuge in thee.) A few minutes more, and the spirit of the High-Priest of Siam had calmly breathed itself away. The eyes were open and fixed; the hands still clasped; the expression sweetly content. My heart and eyes were full of tears, yet I was comforted. By what hope ? I know not, for I dared not question it.\n\nOn the afternoon of the next day I was again summoned by his Majesty to witness the burning of that body.\n\nIt was carried to the cemetery, Watt Sah Kâte ; and there men, hired to do such dreadful offices upon the dead, cut off all the flesh, and flung it to the hungry dogs that haunt that monstrous garbage-field of Buddhism. The bones, and all that remained upon them, were thoroughly burned ; and the ashes, carefully gathered in an earthen pot, were scattered in the little gardens of wretches too poor to buy manure. All that was left now of the venerable devotee was the remembrance of a look.\n\n“ This,” said the king, as I turned away sickened and sorrowful, “ is to give one’s body to be burned. This is what your St. Paul had in his mind,— this custom of our Buddhist ancestors, — this complete self-abnegation, in life and in death, — when he said, ‘ Even if I give my body to be burned, and have not charity [maitree], it profiteth me nothing.”\n\nThe renascence of Buddhism sought to eliminate from the arrogant and impious pantheisms of Egypt, India, and Greece a simple and pure philosophy, upholding virtue as man’s greatest good and highest reward. It taught that the only object worthy of his noblest aspirations was to render the soul (itself an emanation from God) fit to be absorbed back again into the Divine essence from which it sprang. The single aim, therefore, of pure Buddhism seems to have been to rouse men to an inward contemplation of the divinity of their own nature ; to fix their thoughts on the spiritual life within, as the only real and true life; to teach them to disregard all earthly distinctions, conditions, privileges, enjoyments, privations, sorrows, sufferings ; and thus to incite them to continual efforts in the direction of the highest ideals of patience, purity, self-denial.\n\nBuddhism cannot be clearly defined by its visible results to-day. There are more things in that subtile, mystical enigma, called in the Pali Nirwana, in the Birmese Niban, in the Siamese Niphan, than are dreamed of in our philosophy. With the idea of Niphan in his theology, it were absurdly false to say the Buddhist has no God. His Decalogue is as plain and imperative as the Christian’s : —\n\nI. From the meanest insect up to man thou shalt kill no animal whatsoever.\n\nII. Thou shalt not steal.\n\nIII. Thou shalt not violate the wife of another, nor his concubine.\n\nIV. Thou shalt speak no word that is false.\n\nV. Thou shalt not drink wine, nor anything that may intoxicate.\n\nVI. Thou shalt avoid all anger, hatred, and bitter language.\n\nVII. Thou shall not indulge in idle and vain talk.\n\nVIII. Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor’s goods.\n\nIX. Thou shalt not harbor envy, nor pride, nor revenge, nor malice, nor the desire of thy neighbor’s death or misfortune.\n\nX. Thou shalt not follow the doctrines of false gods.\n\nWhosoever abstains from these forbidden things is said to “ observe Silah ” ; and whosoever shall faithfully observe Silah, in all his successive metempsychoses, shall continually increase in virtue and purity, until at length he shall become worthy to behold God, and hear his voice ; and so he shall obtain Niphan. “ Be assiduous in bestowing alms, in practising virtue, in observing Silah, in performing Bavana prayer ; and above all in adoring Guadama, the true God. Reverence likewise his laws and his priests.”\n\nIn the royal private temple, Watt Phra Keau, on the Buddhist Sâbâto, or One-thee-sin, I have contemplated, with a respect approved by all true religious feeling, the devout deportment of that élite congregation of pagans.\n\nThe women sat in circles, and each displayed her vase of flowers and her lighted taper before her. In front of all were a number of my younger pupils, the royal children, in circles also. Close by the altar, on a low square stool, overlaid with a thin cushion of silk, sat the high-priest, Chow-Khoon-Sâb. In his hand he held a concave fan, lined with pale green silk, the back richly embroidered, jewelled, and gilt. He was draped in a yellow robe, not unlike the Roman toga, a loose and flowing habit, closed below the waist, but open from the throat to the girdle, which was simply a band of yellowcloth, bound tightly. From the shoulders hung two narrow strips, also yellow, descending over the robe to the feet, and resembling the scapular worn by certain orders of the Roman Catholic clergy. At his side was an open watch of gold, the gift of his sovereign. At his feet sat seventeen disciples, shading their faces with fans less richly adorned.\n\nWe put off our shoes, — my child and I, — having respect for the ancient prejudice against them ; feeling not so much reverence for the place as for the hearts that worshipped there, caring to display not so much the love of wisdom as the wisdom of love ; and well were we repaid by the grateful smile of recognition that greeted us as we entered.\n\nWe sat down cross-legged. No need to hush my boy, — the silence there, so subduing, checked with its mysterious awe even his inquisitive young mind. The venerable high-priest sat with his face jealously covered, lest his eyes should tempt his thoughts to stray. I changed my position to catch a glimpse of his countenance; he drew his fanveil more closely, giving me a quick but gentle half-glance of remonstrance. Then raising his eyes, with lids nearly closed, he chanted in an infantile, wailing tone.\n\nThat was the opening prayer. At once the whole congregation raised themselves on their knees and, all together, prostrated themselves thrice profoundly, thrice touching the polished brass floor with their foreheads ; and then, with heads bowed, and palms folded, and eyes closed, they delivered the responses after the priest, much in the manner of the English liturgy, first the priest, then the people, and finally all together. There was no singing, no standing up and sitting down, no changing of robes or places, no turning the face to the altar, nor north, nor south, nor east, nor west. All knelt still, with hands folded straight before them, and eyes strictly, tightly closed. Indeed, there were faces there that expressed devotion and piety, the humblest and the purest, as the lips murmured, “O Thou Eternal One, Thou perfection of Time, Thou truest Truth, Thou immutable essence of all Change, Thou most excellent radiance of Mercy, Thou infinite Compassion, Thou Pity, Thou Charity ! ”\n\nI lost some of the responses in the simultaneous repetition, and did but imperfectly comprehend the exhortation that followed, in which was inculcated the strictest practice of charity, in a manner so pathetic, and so gentle, as might be wisely imitated by the most orthodox of Christian priests.\n\nThere was majesty in the humility of those pagan worshippers, and in their shame of self they were sublime. I leave both the truth and the error to Him who alone can soar to the bright heights of the one and sound the dark depths of the other; and take to myself the lesson, to be read in the shrinking forms and hidden faces of those patient waiters for a far-off glimmering Light, — the lesson wherefrom I learn, in thanking God for the light of Christianity, to thank him for its shadow too, which is Buddhism."
