        "text": "THE ROYAL MAIL OF SIAM This unique collection comprises mail sent by the Kings and other members of the Royal family spanning four reigns from King Mongkut (Rama IV) to King Prachatipok. The earliest letter is written in the hand of King Mongkut in 1853 in English, a language he mastered at a young age. There are also various silk envelopes which were specially used to convey letters sent by him. The other monarchs are represented by personal, political and religious letters written by them in the Thai language, complete with exquisitely designed original envelopes. The collection was exhibited at the 29th National Stamp Exhibition held at Korat on 7-13 January 1993. Full use has been made of Mr. Eurtivong's original research and acknowledged expertise of this subject; all attributions, transcriptions and translations are those made by Mr. Eurtivong. Bibliography King Maha Mongkut of Siam, compiled by John Blofield (Bangkok, 1987) The Second King of Siam, Somdeth Phra Pin Klau. His Life and Family, compiled by Somsak Chantanasiri. Memorial, 1985. The Royal Family of Thailand, by Jeffrey Finestone (Great Britain, 1985). Thai--English Dictionary, by George Bradley Macfarland (Stanford, 1944). King Mongkut (Rama IV) Reign 1851-1868 King Mongkut (first King of Siam) was born on 18 October 1804, the Year of the Cat. He was the 43rd. child of King Buddha Loes La Nabhalai (Rama II) and succeeded King Nang Klao (Rama III) on 3 April 1851. As a man of many parts and interests he will go down in the annals of history as a great reformer, historian, amateur scientist and, perhaps, above all the man who projected Siam into the modern world. Overcoming his country's distrust of foreigners, it still could have been no easy task to convince his countrymen that the \"farangs\" (foreigners) could make any worthwhile contribution to a civilised Buddhist country. However, he was driven on by his fascination for science and led by example by becoming an expert astronomer - in 1868 he correctly predicted a sun eclipse to the exact date. Under his auspices foreign trade and communication expanded rapidly and he had frequent meetings with Heads of State and other dignitaries. Despite these developments he remained a devout Buddhist. On the home front he instigated many judicial reforms, built roads and greatly improved the canal system, and despite all his responsibilities he took much interest in his large family and vigorously pursued his interest in historical research, literature and languages. King Monkut died on 17 November 1868. 1853 (17 Dec.) lace-paper holograph letter of congratulations with envelope.\n\ncover The frontispiece of the letter reads \"The most sincere congratulations from SPPR Mongkut the King of Siam. To Mr. and Miss (sic) Smith who were just happily married. Dated Raj Mondem near Grand Palace 17th December 1853\" and showing the personal Buddhist seal of the King handstruck in red.
