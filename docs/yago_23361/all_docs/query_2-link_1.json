The image has now faded dramatically. King Mongkut was the fourth monarch of Siam (now Thailand), and reigned from 1851 to 1868. He spent his young adulthood as a Buddist monk before beginning a reign which was known for its modernisation. This is one of two daguerreotypes which were presented to Queen Victoria in November 1857.",
