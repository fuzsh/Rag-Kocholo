        "text": "October 22, 2018\n\nWhen my friend Kelsey suggested this book, I didn't expect to be so moved. I will try to gather my thoughts and write more soon.\n\n-----\n\nOkay, now I can put some of this into words.\n\nThis is not an easy book to read. While it handles many situations with uncommon delicacy, many things that Anna witnessed were hard. She spent almost six years daily teaching in a haram. Slavery was everywhere; women were not valued, jealousy, false religion, and indecency of all kind abounded. People failed to treat her well. The king allowed his emotions to rule him which meant Anna was in and out of favor. She watched people tortured to death for crimes they didn't commit.\n\nWith all of this Anna kept her goal in mind. She knew that she didn't have the power to change the king. She knew that she could not affect political change in Siam herself. She did know that because she could teach the crown prince and the other royal children, she had the ability to influence the future of a nation.\n\nSo often, if we can't affect change quickly, we stop trying. We stick labels on people and cultures, throw up our hands and walk away. Anna knew that she had to be persistent and keep her goal in mind. She knew that the only way to provide lasting change for a nation was by changing the hearts of the next generation. I was moved by her faithfulness, her courage, and her perseverance.\n\nFebruary 9, 2017\n\nI had no idea this was based on a memoir. So I was quite excited to give it a shot. Then I became swallowed in the minutiae of description and filler. I think I made the right choice in audiobook with this one. I think a person interested in Siam or that area of Asia in the mid 1800s may find this book interesting; otherwise, it becomes rather flat with constant recitation of children's lessons. I'm glad I read it, but dare I say this...I think I'd rather see the movie.\n\nSeptember 25, 2020\n\n3.5\n\nLa historia de Anna Leonowens es una historia de ficcion, basada en personajes reales esta claro, de una viuda 'inglesa' (o deberia decir de origen galesa?) que llega con su pequeño hijo desde Bombay para enseñar ingles a los pequeños príncipes y princesas en el reino de Siam; y tambien servir de seudo correctora de cartas del rey Mongkut en 1862. De sus aventuras cotidianas en ese mundo exótico detras de las murallas, que esta repleto de mujeres en el harem del rey, princesas , damas, esclavas , siervas, amazonas y juezas, resulta de lo más interesante .\n\nLa escritora escribe la novela basada, como dice en el prologo, en dos libros escritos por la misma Anna Harriette Leonowens (de soltera Ann Hariett Emma Edwards) como sus memorias: The English Governess at the Siamese Court (1870) y Romance of the Harem (1873). Por medio de articulos y charlas de su vida en Oriente, y estas memorias fue muy conocida y criticada por su version critica del rey , un budista por muchos años.\n\nEn esta novela esta Anna es de ascendencia galesa, madre viuda y casada otra vez con un oficial ingles y llega a la India a los 14 años donde se enamora de un oficial ingles pese a la oposicion de su padrastro. Despues vive en India, Australia un tiempo, es madre de dos niños cuando queda viuda y ejerce como profesora para los niños ingleses en Bombay hasta que le ofrecen puesto como profesora de inglés para los principes siameses. Ella se lleva a Louis el menor y manda a Avis , su hija mayor con 6 años a Inglaterra.\n\nAnna enfrenta dificultades para entenderse con la idiosincrancia del rey, a quien describe caprichoso a la vez que intelectualmente sagaz, y con una vida de esclavos prostrados , y siervos que debian tatuarse el nombre de a quien debian alianza. Entre budistas y supersticion, y una justicia de azotes y ejecuciones, hay imagenes de bondad , de abnegacion y el deseo de Anna de ser una diferencia en las mentes de los principes . Anna se ve como mediadora muchas veces entre los más desesperados y el rey, aunque ella misma se desespera hacia el final de los 6 años que lleva alli, y cuenta sus escasos sucesos como preciosos.\n\nBuen ejemplo de un narrador poco fiable, es interesante leer entre lineas todas las ideas preconcebidas y prejuicios y los malos juicios que hace Anna, y donde\n\nAnna se ponga en perspectiva de montada arriba de caballo blanco , condenando y despreciando, muchas veces sin entender las sutilezas de lo que ocurre en el escenario politico delicado de esos momentos con el reino luchando por mantenerse independiente ante las potencias de Inglaterra y Francia le parece quedar grande muchas veces.\n\nCuando se busca un poco quien fue Leonowens en realidad puede verse como busca agrandar su acreditada influencia en muchas cosas, incluso con la educacion del principe que seria una de los mayores transformadores politicos de su tiempo, tal vez queriendo ocultar sus verdaderos origenes de familia humilde y tal vez hasta de origen mixto no-blanco.\n\nCon todo, buena lectura.\n\nDecember 5, 2008\n\nI really had no idea what to expect when I read this, knowing what I know about both the musical and the more recent movie with Jodie Foster and Chow Yun-Fat and how musicals really compare to books (I've read the book and seen on Broadway Wicked, after all).\n\nIt was really interesting to start with the preface by Margaret Landon and learn more about Anna Leonowens. It made me once again glad that I read prefaces, because it put me in the right state of mind to read this book.\n\nOne of the first things I noticed was that the writing was definitely an older style than I normally read ... which made me wonder: if I checked the copyright dates of my current reads, what would the average date be? hmmmm...\n\nAnyway, I really -- I mean really -- enjoyed this book. I felt like as \"historical fiction\", it was one of the most accurate books I've ever read. As non-fiction, it read like a novel. As a biography, I learned so much about this amazing woman, and the incredibly difficult choices she made. Any way you look at it, this is a really good book.\n\nThere are a million things to write about here, but maybe I'll just leave it at how Anna's teaching and presence affected the future of a country, and how although her opinions may not have affected King Mongkut much (although you could argue that they did); they had a HUGE impact on Prince Chulalongkorn, who later became king. His desire to abolish slavery, and his first official proclamation which eliminated \"prostration\" were profound.\n\nNovember 22, 2018\n\nA biographical retelling (with fictional bits to fill in the holes) of Anna Leonowens life. A daughter of a British military man, and spending part of her childhood in India, Anna was acquainted with many customs that may have been deemed exotic to the Western world. After school in England, and reuniting with her mother in India, who had remarried after the death of Anna's father, Anna bucked the controlling step-father and married another British military man whom her step-father felt was beneath her position. Having a few children, (2 died in infancy), and suffering further tragedy with the loss of her mother and then husband, she was hard pressed to provide for her children. Anna decided to open a school for military children out of necessity for income, but her success as an educator soon reached the ears of King Mongkut, king of Siam. He corresponded with her to try to secure her to teach his 82 royal children as well as some of his favored harem. Against the advice of her closest friends, she agreed, taking her young son Louis with her, and having to part with her daughter Avis that had to leave to begin her education in England. Upon arriving in Siam, she was hit with tons of culture shock, and the harsh realities of life there, not only for the poor, but women of any class, and the institution of slavery that was very much a part of life. The longer she was there, the more she saw the injustices on many levels, and she felt it was her mission, or \"calling\" you might say, appointed by God to make a difference for the future of these people through the education of the royal young. The story draws on not only her diaries and journals, but letters from her children, from her to others, from the King to other dignitaries, and even official royal decrees. The down-trodden and even women of the harem would often come to her for help in some injustice because of her close proximity to the king and access to his ear, along with her unwillingness to back down. She had much success and the king was often angry with her, but her drive to make a difference did not go unnoticed-- even years later, when her grandson visited the country and wanted to see where she had lived, all gladly showed him the home of \"the white angel\". Her efforts did make a tremendous impact too, even though at the time she felt as if no progress was being made, when one of her students, Prince Chulalongkorn, became king. Because of the impact of her teaching on him, he himself said that he desired to abolish slavery in Siam, do away with the custom of prostration and human worship, building schools and hospitals throughout the country..... and much more, so that the Thai consider him their greatest king. I loved this book, and another example of how one person can make a powerful difference.\n\nNovember 15, 2020\n\nIt's a rarity when the movie adaptation is better than the book, but the movie classic, starring Yul Brenner, was amazing. The book was also good, but got bogged down with the tiny details of life in Siam, and description of place. I still enjoyed the book, and would recommend it, however, possibly the audiobook would be more engaging.\n\nOctober 14, 2017\n\nAnna and the King of Siam started out on a really high note.\n\nI loved the description that dripped with atmosphere, the characters were spunky and unique, and the best part was that it was based off a true story!\n\nBut then it went on. And on. And on. And ON. The description never ended and the plot never started. Since it is based on a true story, I'm not sure there is a particular plot.\n\nIt was a struggle to finish.\n\nJuly 3, 2010\n\nA fascinating read- I love Thailand and this was an interesting look into its past. The writing style comes across somewhat disorganized and apparently there is some dispute into the veracity of all of her claims. What did I learn from this- there are strong women all over the world who can and do make a difference. As Margaret Landon wrote of some of the Thai women \"they were not surpassed by the women of any nation in the world. But the system under which they lived! That was the crux of the matter!\" That was the best part of this book- the stories of these women- their heroism, kindness, quiet ways of getting what they want or need for those around them. We could all learn from them. It is not your circumstances in life- it is what you do within those circumstances!\n\nJune 22, 2007\n\nAnna and the King of Siam is a fictional account of an English teacher's two volume \"memoir\" that had long gone out of print. Margaret Landon combined these two books together into a historical novel. As there are so many points of elaboration it is hard to get any real sense of the events that might have actually taken place back in the 1860s. A quick search online will bring up numerous opinions and essays on the story in its many forms: The English Governess at the Siamese Court, The Romance of the Harem, Anna and the King of Siam, and The King and I.\n\nThis 1950s reprint of the 1945 novel came my way via the old Bookrelay site. I've seen the musical The King and I a number of times as it was one of my grandmother's favorites and she and I spent a lot of time together. I can't say I agree with grandmother on the film. I've always found it a little boring and off-putting. The book suffers from many of the same problems.\n\nThe book is long and dry. There are scenes designed for a melodramatic impact but they often fall flat. Landon's descriptions of the scenes reads more like a book report (or perhaps a dull copying job from Leonowen's books?) that are often tedious to read. After having suffered through 352 pages of minutiae one might has well have read a history book on the same subject and at least come away with having learned something!\n\nAnna for all her \"good intentions\" comes off as so xenophobic that it is hard to believe she has as much influence as the novel would have one believe. I am not expecting a \"politically correct\" novel but Anna's distrust of her Siamese hosts is extreme compared with similar books I've read from similar eras (both the 1940s and the 1860s).\n\nDecember 1, 2022\n\nI grew up in a household where my mother loved The King and I, she had the record, and if it aired on the telly, we all had to watch. Mom even went to a performance with Yul Brynner in Washington, D.C., in the 1980s.\n\nBased on this familial love, I read Anna and the King of Siam for a book challenge prompt (Books set in Thailand).\n\nThis was a chunkier classic and read slower than more contemporary novels, but it was fascinating.\n\nAnna and the King of Siam examine 19th-century Thailand, especially the cultural practices and beliefs. The story follows the life of Anna Leonowens and her work as a teacher/governess to King Mongkut's broad of children. The novel is written with little wiggle room for acceptance of Thai culture, so one should anticipate that biases are in the story. However, it is essential to note that the book is a classic and will address cultural norms differently.\n\nOverall, it was exciting, but I prefer to read a nonfiction novel about 19th-century Thailand to learn more about the culture and the monarchy.\n\nI recommend Anna and the King of Siam to fans of classic literature.\n\nAugust 20, 2009\n\nAnna Leonowens was a real woman and this really happened, and that statement alone seems crazy when you read the book. This is a fabulous story about one woman who happened to be British when the English ruled the world. Behind the familiar story of “The King and I” (which a lone is pretty fabulous!) is the story of Anna’s determination to make the most of the situation she found herself in. It is true that the Brits bowed to no one but their queen and that attitude of “Noblese obligue” gave her backbone, but it was her own sense of how terribly wrong slavery was, that animates and ennobles much of the story. I loved it so much more than I thought I would.\n\nJanuary 14, 2021\n\n3.5 - As a lover of The King and I since childhood, this was a fun look into the truth behind the story. Because it was true, there was admittedly more political talk than was entertaining, but it was still an engaging story. If you ever want a way to encourage a teacher that their profession is worthwhile even when it feels like they're failing (or a missionary) this would be that story. Her instruction and example was the seed that changed Siam. (at least according to this account. :))\n\nAugust 23, 2016\n\nFor the full review, please visit: http://marelithalkink.blogspot.co.za/...\n\nIn the early 1860's, Anna Leonowens, a widow with two young children, was invited to Siam (modern day Thailand) by King Mongkut who wanted her to teach his children and wives the English language and introduce them to British customs. Inspired by two memoirs written by Mrs Leonowens, Margaret Landon took the first person narratives and enhanced them with details about the Siamese people and their culture from other sources. The book has been translated into dozens of languages and has inspired at least six adaptations into various dramatic mediums. Now, for the first time, it is also available on electronic format.\n\nAnna's relationship with King Mongkut is complicated from the start (he did promise her a house of her own). As governess, Anna often finds herself at cross-purposes, marveling at the foreign customs, fascinating people and striking landscape of the kingdom and its harems, while simultaneously trying to influence her pupils with her Western ideals and values. Especially young Prince Chulalongkorn. When the young prince became king, Anna's influence has lead Chulalongkorn to abolish slavery in Siam and introduce democratic reform based on the ideas of freedom and human dignity as first learned from his beloved tutor.\n\nAnna also assisted King Mongkut to communicate with foreign governments. One actual historical event portrayed in this novel, was King Mongkut's written offer of several pairs of elephants to President Buchanan of the United States. According to King Mongkut, the elephants would be useful in the unsettled parts of the United States. President Buchanan's successor, Abraham Lincoln, responded to the extraordinary offer. In a letter dated February 3, 1862 - he graciously accepted the sword and photograph from the King, but politely declined the elephants.\n\nThis brilliant novel combines in-depth research with richly imagined details to create a lush portrait of 1860 Siam. Margaret Landon drew her research from Siamese court records and Anna Leonowens' own writing, the two memoirs, The English Governess at the Siamese Court (1870) and Romance of the Harem (1872).\n\nAnna and the King of Siam has enchanted millions over the years. It's an historical tale of cultural differences that invites readers into an ancient, but vivid world told through the eyes and real-life experiences of unforgettable characters.\n\nRead\n\nMay 14, 2019\n\nZhlédnuto ve verzi Anna a král Siamu, 1946\n\n4*\n\nMám opravdu moc ráda filmovou verzi z roku 1999 s Jodie Foster, ani nevím, kolikrát jsem ji viděla. Před několika dny mě kdovíproč napadlo, jestli existují i další ztvárnění, a zjistila jsem, že jich je hned několik včetně muzikálového filmu z roku 1956 se skvělým Yulem Brynnerem. Rozhodla jsem se podívat na úplně první zpracování z roku 1946 a vůbec nelituji.\n\nJe komornější než známý film s Foster, přitom působí syrověji a ne tak romanticky. Příběh se v podstatě odehrává jen v učebně, sálu a králově pracovně, na rychlé střídání krátkých epizodních scén jsem si musela chvíli zvykat a překvapila mě mnohem krutější, ale nejspíš i realističtější způsob smrti konkubíny Tuptim.\n\nVýborné herecké výkony Irenne Dunne v roli rázné Anny, Rexe Harrisona coby charismatického, majestátního a občas roztomile nejistého krále a Lee Cobba, jenž představoval věčně zachmuřeného Kralahomeho.\n\nMoc ráda se na tento snímek někdy znovu podívám.\n\nJuly 23, 2018\n\nBelieve it or not, between sixth grade and 11th grade I don’t think I read one book that I didn’t have to for school. Too cool to read and all that. Then for some reason my local library for the blind sent me this book. God only knows why. But I devoured it. Within like three days. In braille. This book restarted my love of reading, and it has never stopped. I decided to read it again to see how it held up. I’m a little surprised that this book fueled my love of reading. Maybe it was just so out there with the descriptions of Siam, that I had to love it. It didn’t hold up so well during the second reading, but it was still good.\n\nApril 22, 2019\n\nКнижка дуууже крута\n\nmust read як от кажуть\n\nJuly 20, 2014\n\nIn 1951 the well-known Rodgers and Hammerstein musical “The King and I” premiered on Broadway. The basis for the musical play is this book, published in 1944. There really was an Englishwoman who traveled with her son to Bangkok to serve as a school teacher for the many children (and some of their mothers) of the King of Siam in 1862 (he really did have a harem of concubines). Her name was Anna Leonowens. She was recently widowed (her husband had been a British officer serving in the Far East) and now had to support herself and her two children. She and her son spent five years in Bangkok. Her daughter was sent back to England and was never with her in Siam.\n\nHollywood filmed the book in the late 40s, with Rex Harrison playing the king. And of course portraying the king in the musical version was the trademark (career-defining) role for Yul Brynner, who won the Best Actor Oscar for the 1956 film version. That was also the first time Marni Nixon sang for other actresses in film musicals (singing for Deborah Kerr in “The King and I”, Natalie Wood in “West Side Story”, and Audrey Hepburn in “My Fair Lady”).\n\nThe copy I read is an old hardcover version (70 years old now!), and I guess it’s an original edition --- it’s certainly showing its age. Published during World War II, it has this message at the beginning (something I’ve never seen before).\n\n“Government wartime restrictions on materials have made it essential that the amount of paper used in each book be reduced to a minimum. This volume is printed on lighter paper than would have been used before material limitations became necessary, and the number of words on each page has been substantially increased. The smaller bulk in no way indicates that the text has been shortened.”\n\nThe author based the book on two books Anna Leonowens eventually wrote herself. The author sought to combine them and make the story meaningful for contemporary readers. These long out-of-print autobiographical works are “The English Governess at the Siamese Court” published in 1870 and “The Romance of the Harem” published in 1872. Anna also wrote an article about her experience that appeared in an issue of \"The Atlantic Monthly\" magazine in 1869.\n\nMost of what’s in the book does not appear in the musical (the king actually died in 1868 after Anna had already left Bangkok). It’s really a series of episodes describing various experiences and encounters she had. Most of them are quite interesting to read about, and some are quite harrowing. The descriptions of life in the palace, the harem, the justice system, the religious influence of Buddhism, the political situation (the king was quite troubled in dealing with the British and the French and their attempts to expand their empires), the royal ceremonies, and other facets of life in that part of the world at that time period are fascinating.\n\nMarch 7, 2018\n\nVery good book\n\nFor a small bit of history of Siam, this is a good book. I don't know much about the facts, having read the preface, but for all the other information that may be true, it is truly a wonderful book.\n\nAnna loved her husband dearly and never remarried, but I believe just a tiny bit of the movie that she and the King developed a closer bond of friendship than most friends of today. The love and devotion she had with her pupils was quite obvious, as well as the animosity between herself and the horrid translator.\n\nThe many relationships with the women of the harem were complex, at the same time, simple. Lady Thiang was a rare soul, able to love so devoutly, yet recognise the human, or perhaps not so quite human at times, the failings of her husband. To remain devoted to someone like that, with his many violent outbursts of anger and not fear him totally, is very uncommon.\n\nAnna's influence on Prince Chulalongkorn just have made her proud of her decision to stay when times were the most difficult. I also believe she must have felt some relief, that her many years there has made such an impression on the young boy.\n\nAll in all, this is one book I'm glad I bought. I read it when I was much younger, cried in spots, got angry in others, and signed with relief when situations resolved successfully. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes history, a few love stories, much conflict, and exciting, tense moments. Anna and the King of Siam will remain a favourite of mine. I'm truly glad it's on my Fire, so I can re-read it whenever I feel the need to travel without leaving my own home.\n\nFebruary 11, 2016\n\nThis fiction is an insult to our King and our nation , I'm quite surprise that somebody still refer it as a history fiction tho.\n\nRacist everywhere.\n\nThe King never have any romantic interest with Anna from what has been written in the historical archive , this is an image that Anna has try to proclaimed and painted. Actually she is a big liar , even try to concealed the fact that she was born mixed with Indian blood.\n\nHow can you believe a woman who tried to conceal even her true identity!!\n\nWhat really happen is the king himself even regard Anna as a difficult woman and more difficult than generalities. She is just an Indian-English governess who has been hired to teach! Does not thing about mutual with our political matter or end the slavery of Thailand that she claimed to be the originate of that idea.\n\nYes she might maybe a slightest part of influence because it happens after he visit Europe which there is a big gap in time line.\n\nThe story was really exaggerated and held slightest part of the truth.\n\nNovember 2, 2013\n\nIf you love Rogers and Hammerstein's \"The King and I,\" you will love Landon's \"Anna and the King of Siam.\" She combined two books written by Anna Leonowens with original source material from the Library of Congress to create a beautifully written account of Anna Leonowens' time in Siam.\n\nAs I read about the harem of the king and the brutal class distinction in Siam, I couldn't help but think that this book is a perfect portrait of what a society in bondage looks like. Rather than believing in the Absolute God, Siam put their faith in an Absolute King. As the reader, I felt myself sympathizing with Anna as she experienced the unjust culture that struggled to survive in Siam.\n\nMy only real complaint about the book was its lack of citation. I know a lot of the information was true, but I also know that Margaret Landon took some liberty with the story. I wish I had a better understanding of what was fact and what was fiction.\n\nSeptember 19, 2014\n\nThough it was fun to see how various aspects were adapted into THE KING AND I, the book is pretty dull and tedious otherwise. In addition to supplying a more compelling linear structure, the musical improves upon the source by treating the titular king with more respect and offering Anna a chance to appreciate his strengths. Also, though its detailed descriptions of mid-19th century Siam are detailed, they're not particularly imaginative or poetic and less necessary now that we have access to photos and opulent film interpretations. Still, credit must be given to Landon for recognizing something broadly appealing in Anna Lenowen's original memoirs (which are apparently bogged down with poorly written Siamese history) and adapting them into a more assessable (if still dry) \"biographical novel\".\n\n(I do a more thorough comparison of novel vs. musical vs. fact at http://me2ism.net/2014/09/19/margaret...)\n\nOctober 21, 2016\n\nI would like to thank NetGalley and the publishers for a copy of this book.\n\nIn 1862, British governess Anna Leonowens was engaged by the King Mongkut, King of Siam, to be the governess of his children.\n\nDuring the 6 years of her stay in Siam, Anna witnessed a lot, learned much about the culture, traditions, beliefs of this country, but most of all she tried to leave her mark upon the fresh minds of the princes and princesses.\n\nDuring her stay also, she was almost always in opposition with King Mongkut. They were both with strong personalities, with different priorities and perception of things, which made they relationship a very difficult one, but somehow it ended in a deep friendship.\n\nIt was not a story with a specific plot, it felt more like an account of the main events that defined and shaped the life of Anna in Siam, also the important moments of this Nation during that period. And i found it all very interesting and fascinating.\n\nFebruary 24, 2015\n\nI had played the tiniest part in the movie Anna and the King, starring Jodie Foster & Chow Yuen Fatt as Anna and King Mongkut respectively. Further to this, the movie was shot in my hometown of Penang, where we the locals saw modern day Penang, turn into aincent Siam. It was a wonder. Besides this, Anna's husbands tomb is also found in Penang, Mr. Thomas Leonowens plus I have always loved the older silver screen version of this story; The King and I, where Yul Brynner played the role of the King.\n\nThis book was a joy to read and has peaked my interest in so many other subjects pertaining the history of Siam, Kedah and Malaysia in general. Plus my interest in Anna's University in Nova Scotia, Halifax, Canada.\n\nJust pure joy.\n\nAugust 4, 2018\n\nThe play and movie \"The King and I\" were adapted from this book. Anna Leonowens was a young widow who, with her son, Louis, whom she often refers to as Boy, spent five plus years in Siam, now Thailand, as teacher to King Mongkut's children and wives and \"secretary\" to the king himself. Many times she found herself at odds with the king and appalled by many of the ancient customs and cruelties. In later years she was gratified to be told by King Chulalongkorn, the crown prince at the time of her employment, that he had followed many of her teachings and was bringing his country slowly but surely into the modern age with freedom of religion, the abolishment of slavery and the discontinuation of prostrating oneself, etc., etc., etc.\n\nSeptember 10, 2014\n\nThis work was extremely well done. The characters were intriguing, the atmosphere crafted in detail, and its lessons applied to life outside of its covers.\n\nIn particular, I think Anna would make a compelling heroin for older girls or young adult women. She admits fear to herself, but she refuses to let it determine her actions. She has an overriding sense of honor, but she is flexible in how she accomplishes what she sees as honorable outcomes. By putting her heroine against a real and flawed backdrop just at the crossroads between a traditional society and an industrial one, the author ensures that the conflict Anna faces are those that generations of readers will face also.\n\nRead\n\nOctober 13, 2016\n\nI would like to thank NetGalley and the publishers for a copy of this book.\n\nI am a passionate about Asia's history, but I had a really hard time reading Anna and the King of Siam. I found the story of Anna interesting, but the book is written in some sort of small and brief stories, it feels that every chapter is a new one. It was because of this that I feel it is lacking a plot and a climax, the suspense or the emotion that keeps me turning pages. It took me almost two months to reach to Chapter 23, and I couldn't finish it.\n\nApril 19, 2011\n\nGreat read! I'd never read the original, and am currently looking for a copy of the movie just to see how it differs. I know that I've seen the movie, and my memory leads me to believe that it's not at all the same. It's statement about slavery and the ownership of people is something I didn't expect when I began the book.\n\nOctober 6, 2017\n\nI read this book as part of a book club. It's not something I would normally pick up on my own, but I really enjoyed it. The descriptions of life in Siam were vivid and interesting, and I was moved by how much Anna devoted herself to helping the women and slaves. I can't wait to see the film!"
