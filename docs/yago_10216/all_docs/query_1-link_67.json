        "text": "I have begun working on a new series for the Caleb & Livvie edits. These now include ALL of Caleb's scenes and ALL of Livvie's scenes. During several of the arcs, I also included all of Jack's scenes. These are new original master dvds done from original episodes.\n\nCaleb & Livvie #1, Caleb & Livvie #2, Caleb & Livvie #3,\n\nLivvie Edit February 1 - March 29, 2002 (NO CALEB, off the show),\n\nCaleb & Livvie #4 Prequel Dvd - Livvie Edit Torn/Naked Eyes! , Caleb & Livvie #4, Caleb & Livvie #5, Caleb & Livvie #6,\n\nCaleb 2003,\n\nJohn McBain Edits,\n\nPC Dinner #14, and \"Irish Coffee with the Boys\"\n\nCaleb and Livvie #1 May 11 - July 25, 2001: Time In a Bottle/Tainted Love (Michael/Caleb/Livvie/Jack): 8 hour original edit\n\nThis edit begins with Michaels arrival, meeting Eve in the woods (he is Calebs twin brother, a priest). Jack dies after a racing accident and Livvie, Allison, and Jamal bury him in the woods. Caleb gets loose and meets Livvie in the woods and is drawn to her. Later as Livvie is grieving over Jacks grave, Caleb appears to her. She seems mesmerized by the stranger. Jack soon reappears back from the dead, now a vampire. Chris soon figures it out and tries to capitalize on the finding. Caleb also turns Gabby into a vampire. Caleb takes Livvie to his cave, she later returns drawn to him. He then takes her to the fantasy villa and brings her comatose mother to see her, alive and well. Meanwhile, Michael tries to protect Eve from Calebs interest in her unborn baby. Jamal, then Lucy & Kevin figure out that Jack and Caleb are vampires. This edit contains all of Michaels scenes (he arrives towards the end of Time In A Bottle), all of Calebs scenes and I started including all of Livvies scenes at the begining of the Tainted Love arc. I also included all of Jacks scenes as he is involved with Livvie at the time of Calebs arrival. Click here to read the full edit description.\n\nCaleb & Livvie #2 Tempted July 26 - September 26, 2001: 8 hour original edit This edit covers the rest of the Caleb, Livvie, Jack storyline from Tainted Love and continues into the Tempted Love arc. Jack finds a picture of Maison de la Noche at the monastary as Caleb has persuaded Livvie to marry him. Jack interrupts just as Caleb is about to marry her. Kevin distracts Caleb and Jack is able to whish Livvie away, then Lucy comes in and is able to save Kevin with her new vampire slayer powers! Jack and Livvie reunite and she begs him to bite her to take her away from Caleb. Jack pushes her away, afraid for her and tells her he doesnt love her any longer. She calls to Caleb to take her away. Caleb & Livvie make love and he slips the wedding band on her finger. Big show down on the roof at the end of Tainted Love and they hope that Caleb has been destroyed. Livvie finds Calebs ring on her pillow, Caleb returns, and Rafe arrives in PC.

I had to include a third dvd to finish up the final scenes. So I decided to continue adding the Livvie scenes through Miracles Happen as she didnt have a lot of scenes during that arc. I also added the scenes of Kevin & Lucys surprise wedding at the end of the MH arc. I then continued adding all of the LIvvie & Jack scenes from Secrets through January, 2002. Click here to read the full edit description.\n\nNote: There was no Caleb during the Miracles Happen arc, nor on the next three arcs (Secrets, Superstition, Torn). He returns again during the Naked Eyes arc and that is where the next Caleb & Livvie edit will pick up. Im undecided at this point whether I will continue to edit Livvies scenes up till that time (from Feb-Sept, 2002).\n\nLivvie Edit February 1 - March 29, 2002: 8 hour original edit Secrets arc concluded Livvie scenes only, Caleb is not on the show during this arc.\n\nClick here to read the full edit description.\n\nCaleb & Livvie #4 Prequel Dvd - Livvie Edit Torn/Naked Eyes! September 16-23, 2002: 4 hour dvd\n\nThis edit contains all of Livvie's scenes from the end of Torn and the beginning of Naked Eyes leading up to Caleb's return, which happens at the start of the Caleb & Livvie #4. This is an added bonus dvd as it sets the stage for Caleb's return. Click here to read the full edit description.\n\nCaleb & Livvie #4 October 25 - December, 23 2002: 8 hour original edit \"SURRENDER\" Arc.\n\nStephen Clay arrives, Caleb returns. Livvie & Tess.

These guys were both so sweet! They both said they had no plans on doing an individual event this year but the outpouring of love and support from the fans they received after the show was cancelled, all of the cards and letters meant a lot to them and this is what lead them to have this event.\n\nPC Dinner August, 2003 - 2 hours\n\nThis is a very heartfelt event. I included pre-event shots of the ballroom, fans lining up, raffle items. Then its off to the press room, interviews there with Miriam Parish (Reese), Brian Gaskill (he talks about B&B), Kelly Monaco (doing the switch with Ally & Livvie, and GH), Erin & Brian Presley (\"Eddie\", the switch), Marie Wilson (Karen) talks about her new project on location in Florida \"Catharsis\", Eddie Mattos (on SSW), Joy Bisco, Tamara, Cari Shayne (Karen on GH) & Alex Mendoza (Joe III). Then its off to the main ballroom - additional cast members in attendance: Imani Kent Masters, Anne Jeffries, Rebecca Staab, Michael Dietz, Susan Brown, Michael Easton, Thorsten Kaye, Jay Pickett and Kimberlin Brown. Each actors takes the mic and says something about each other, the show, what they will miss. This is a very touching tribute to each other and the show, with some good natured ribbing thrown in."
