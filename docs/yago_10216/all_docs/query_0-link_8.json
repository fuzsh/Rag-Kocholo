(From Soapcity.com)\n\nIndependence Day is upon us! SoapCity quizzed your daytime favorites to find out how they would be spending the 4th of July and upcoming summer breaks.\n\nErin Hershey Presley (Alison, PC): \"We are going to Lake Tahoe with my husband Brian's family. I have never been so I am looking forward to it.\"\n\nRed Carpet (From Soapcity.com)\n\nPort Charles nominee Erin Hershey Presley (Alison) wasn't the least bit nervous. Real-life hubby Brian Presley (Jack), who was nominated last year, told her, \"Being nominated is the victory.\"\n\nThe Mayor's Reception (From Soapcity.com)\n\nPC's real-life marriedites Erin Hershey (Alison) and Brian Presley (Jack) spent Emmy week in N.Y. hanging out with visiting relatives. \"My family has never been here, so we all took one of those double-decker tourist buses around Manhattan,\" Erin said. Meanwhile, Brian was determined to catch a Yankee game before returning to L.A.\n\nEmmy Nominations - Surprises Galore! (From Soapcity.com)\n\nFor today's West Coast presenters, being on The View meant back-to-back redeye flights, with not much chance to enjoy New York during their brief stay. Alicia Lee Willis was hoping to sandwich in a matinee performance of the hit musical, Hairspray, now that the Broadway musicians' strike is over; and newlyweds Brian and Erin Hershey Presley were just planning a relaxing dinner in midtown. Brian admitted that just the idea of not having to do dishes would be wonderful. \"I have a tendency to just rinse off the dishes and let them sit in the sink,\" he laughed, \"so I'm always in trouble at home for not loading the dishwater!\"\n\nBrian Presley Brings a New \"Face\" to the Emmys (From Soapcity.com)\n\nBrian Presley (Jack) isn't letting the grass grow under his feet (no, just the whiskers on his face) while Port Charles is on a six-month taping hiatus. When Brian escorted his Emmy-nominated wife Erin Hershey (Alison) to the Radio City awards shindig, he showed up sporting enough facial fuzz to make us wonder if his razor had been confiscated by airport security at LAX before he boarded the plane to NY. Actually, it turns out that Brian is growing the beard for an independent film called Eddie that starts filming in July. How does Erin feel about her hubby's new five-o'clock shadowy existence? \"I like it,\" she confessed. \"He was actually very scruffy at first, but now it's much neater.\" \"That's because it was getting kind of nasty looking,\" Brian admitted, \"so Erin made me shave it way down to come to New York for the Emmys. But I'm not worried. It'll grow back.\"\n\n&nbsp\n\nexcerpts from One On One with Port Charles' Erin Hershey Presley (Alison) (From SoapCity.com)\n\nSoapCity spoke with the daytime ing�nue about maintaining her balance in a crazy industry like show business, the media�s depiction of women, the heavenly pairing of Rafe and Alison and how her husband, Brian Presley (Jack), helps her stay grounded.\n\nWhat keeps you grounded?\n\nMy family. We don�t go out and do a lot of things. Brian [Presley, her husband] and I are both family orientated people. We love working and fun events. We really try to remember that it [show business] is a great job, not a life style. We really stay focused with our families, we go to church, we have quiet times and date night. We are just like everybody else but really stay grounded with our families.\n\nHow has the male/female relationships changed over the years? Better or worse?\n\nOlder generations did not live together before they were married. Now, it is a lot different. It is very common now for younger people to live together. People date more before they get married. I didn�t, I stayed home a lot! But people do date more. Music and fashion are totally different and I think that is a key factor with today�s younger generation.\n\nWhat empowers you?\n\nMy family. I know that I am so blessed with an awesome family and great friends, really true friends. I have an awesome husband. Brian [Presley] and I always talk about how blessed we are -- not just about our jobs, but the really great opportunities we have had. We recognize that it is a blessing and we are thankful for them. You always have to reflect and to be thankful for what you have done in life.\n\nClick here for full article.\n\nCaught in the Act (From TV Guide Online)\n\nHershey Kiss: There were hugs and kisses all around as Port Charles star Erin Hershey celebrated her Daytime Emmy nomination for outstanding younger actress with her co-star and husband Brian Presley.\n\nReal Life Romances: #9 Erin Hershey and Brian Presley\n\nMaking Magic Dreams Come True!\n\nIt was an evening of romance that was worthy of a daytime supercouple!\n\nOn April 19, 2002, at ABC's Super Soap Weekend in DisneyLand, \"Port Charles\" actor Brian Presley (\"Jack\") led co-star Erin Hershey (\"Alison\") to believe that she was about to appear in an interview for the TV newsmagazine \"Entertainment Tonight\" at Disney's California Adventure Park.\n\nSuddenly, Cinderella's glass carriage appeared and whisked the actress over to the Magic Castle, where trumpeters announced her arrival.
