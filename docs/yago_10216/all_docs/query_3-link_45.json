You can update your choices at any time in your settings.\n\nMy name is Erin Moore and I am a wife and mother of 5 kids. One of my kids was born with cystic fibrosis. Another was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes and PCOS. A third has Hashimoto thyroiditis and ADHD. We live in Hershey, Pennsylvania, having moved here from Cincinnati, Ohio about 7 years ago. We have received care at Cincinnati Children's Hospital, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, and Johns Hopkins University. We've had good, bad, and ugly experiences, not just with these health systems, but with labs and durable medical equipment suppliers and insurance companies and pharmacies and pharmacy benefits managers and pharmaceutical companies and clinical research organizations and home health care partners, just to name a few. I wholeheartedly believe that the outcomes we achieve are by design, and we desperately need to redesign these systems to better serve the needs of the people who rely on them.\n\nI have lived and worked in and around these systems for 15 years. I decided to start this newsletter to chronicle what is is like to be a mother who relies on these systems to keep her children alive and well. I want to elevate the skills required for success, and the time invested that is often fruitless. There will be facts and feelings. There will be many questions. This is my experience, but I don't think it is unique. My goal in creating awareness of our experiences is to build community for change that we can all benefit from."
