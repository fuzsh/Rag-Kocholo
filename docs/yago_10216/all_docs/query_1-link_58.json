        "text": "Overview\n\nBrian Presley and Melissa Stetten Twitter Scandal began with a series of live-tweets by model Melissa Stetten claiming that married actor Brian Presley was harassing her while intoxicated on a flight in June of 2012.\n\nBackground\n\nOn June 6th, 2012, model Melissa Stetten began live-tweeting her interactions with actor Brian Presley while aboard a flight from Los Angeles, California to New York, New York. In the tweets, Stetten claimed that Presley denied being married, removed his wedding ring while in the bathroom and became intoxicated after drinking several alcoholic beverages. Additionally, Stetten retweeted an article in the religious blog Christianity Today detailing Presley's recovery from years of alcoholism. Within two days of the incident, Stetten gained over 14,000 new Twitter followers.\n\nNotable Developments\n\nOnline Reaction\n\nOn June 6th, 2012, the story was published on several sites including the men's interest blog Manolith , the tech news blog Now Public , The Daily What and the pop culture blog Hyper Vocal. The same day, the viral content site BuzzFeed posted Stetten's live-tweets as well as Presley’s last tweet prior to the incident, which read:\n\nOn June 7th, the \"Oh No Polio\" Tumblr blog posted screen shots of the tweets, which received over 21,000 notes within 24 hours.

Also on June 7th, Redditor Nacho_Average_Libre submitted a post titled “Bad Luck, Brian” , which included a head shot of Presley comparing him to the Bad Luck Brian advice animal.

Within 21 hours, the post received over 7,700 up votes and 400 comments.\n\nPresley's Response\n\nOn June 8th, 2012, Presley denied Stetten's claims in a post on his official Facebook page, affirming that he was sober and remained dedicated to his wife and children. The same day, Stetten tweeted a screenshot of Presley's Facebook post with the description \"Now THIS is funny.\"\n\nBlog Coverage\n\nIn the following days, Stetten's tweets were picked up by mainstream celebrity publications like People, Glamour, Gawker and The Guardian, and led to several column articles of varying opinions about Stetten's tweets and Presley's denial.\n\nShortly after Presley's Facebook status update on June 8th, Daily Mail's columnist came in defense of Presley and questioned the reliability of Stetten's allegations.
