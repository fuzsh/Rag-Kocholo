When the story went viral, Presley released a statement on his Facebook page denying the tale. He wrote: \"I love that I took a red eye flight to NY, had a 10 minute friendly conversation with the person sitting next to me, had some food, and went to sleep! I learned today this person has been tweeting about me drinking beer in the airplane bathroom, and trying to commit adultery with her on the airplane. Really absurd and quite funny! … They Even took pictures of me while I was sleeping…. None of what this person said happened is true! I guess in today's age you have to be careful who you say hello too. Sobriety, God, & My Family are the most important things in my life! My Wife Rocks, My Kids Rock, and Sobriety Rocks!!! I will pay this no more attention and I encourage all of you to do the same. God Bless all of you and thank you all for all your support! – Brian\""
