        "text": "Throughout the years many of our favorite actors and actresses have continued to work; either on the same soap that made them famous or through other roles on competing soaps. Others still, however talented eventually faded from public view and either didn’t work again or just moved to behind the scenes work.\n\nWho are some of the actors and actresses you liked who just vanished from the soap opera industry?\n\nJ. Eddie Peck: After roles on Dallas, Dynasty, Y&R and AMC it seems that he hasn’t had much of a career. He’s had a small number of roles in low-budget project but hasn’t had a big career. Too bad cause I recall him being very talented.\n\nMichael Lowry: He’s had a much more high-profile career than J. Eddie has since leaving soaps, but after roles on AMC, ATWT, OLTL and B&B it would be nice to see him return to soaps.\n\nMichael Dietz: After roles on Port Charles, GH, B&B and Passions he changed career course and started producing, but he is greatly missed on-screen.\n\nNolan North: One of the breakout characters on Port Charles, he was seemingly headed for a huge career as a soap opera villain, but he changed courses and has steadily worked as a voice-over artist and in episodic TV.\n\nErin Hershey Presley and Brian Presley: Two of the more popular actors on PC, neither on has had much success post-soaps.\n\nVictoria Rowell: We all know how talented Victoria is and how public her split from Y&R was. I wish she would find a role on daytime again because she’s a dynamic performer.\n\nLisa Peluso: After roles on Search for Tomorrow, One Life To Live, Loving and Another World it was something of a shock to see her basically vanish from soaps after “AW” was cancelled. She would have been a perfect fit on “Days of Our Lives”.\n\nMarcy Walker: After roles on AMC, GL and Santa Barbara it was upsetting when she left acting altogether.\n\nWho are you favorite performers who have vanished from daytime?\n\n\"and to the fans, I was only supposed be on every other Tuesday. But thanks to you I'm here to stay. I'm going back to that studio on Monday and I'm going to play Erica Kane for all she's worth.\"- Susan Lucci, 1999 Daytime Emmy Speech.\n\nVanessa seems content to do a guest stint here and a TV movie there rather than return to soap work full time. I can’t imagine her going to a show that isn’t GH, because they’ve always seemed incredibly interested in having her for whatever length of time she’s willing to give, and she strikes me as a loyalist to them among soaps. The only other show I could imagine being competitive for her is B&B, because of the generally lighter workload and international appeal, and I could see them being the least interested.\n\nI also think that as great as Vanessa Marcil is, and I do love her, her daytime appeal on the basis of name recognition is kind of limited because she’ll always be Brenda. No other soap would really be able to get past it, and if people did tune in, it would be because they wanted to see Brenda. What they saw would either be an imitation or a huge letdown because it’s something else. Very few actors have that strong a connection to a character, but I really can’t see her playing a different soap role. It would be like watching Alison Sweeney, Katherine Kelly Lang or Sharon Case play a different role on a different show.\n\nVanessa seems content to do a guest stint here and a TV movie there rather than return to soap work full time.

It would be like watching Alison Sweeney, Katherine Kelly Lang or Sharon Case play a different role on a different show.\n\nMy thought is that just like Genie Francis’s non-GH stints, Vanessa would always fight the memory of Brenda but that she’d be a big draw for viewers, at least initially on any show she’d go on.\n\n\"and to the fans, I was only supposed be on every other Tuesday. But thanks to you I'm here to stay. I'm going back to that studio on Monday and I'm going to play Erica Kane for all she's worth.\"- Susan Lucci, 1999 Daytime Emmy Speech.\n\nMy soap viewing, on and off, dates back to the mid-1980s. I was first exposed to the soaps—with ABC’s Ryan’s Hope—in the late-1970s.\n\nA lot of people from that period left the business.\n\nBeing an actor is tough. So, this had to do with some people’s backgrounds, their circumstances, their reality.\n\nIn more recent times, you can look to the network soaps which were canceled for who among their cast members is now inactive.\n\nA number of them left to go into a different line of work; that they are truly among us as civilians and no longer in showbiz.\n\nI will mention some actors:\n\nMarcy Walker. Winner of the 1989 Emmy for lead actress as Eden on Santa Barbara, nominee for that series and for All My Children, and one of the most celebrated among daytime performers…last I recall is that Walker went into working with some church. A ministries program. North Carolina. Oklahoma.\n\nBryan Buffinton. Five-time Emmy nominee, during the 1990s, for playing Vanessa and Billy’s son, Bill Lewis, on Guiding Light. Buffinton, born in 1980, tried to continue his acting career into adulthood but wasn’t successful. He joined the financial sector and may still be in Florida.\n\nSharon Gabet. Two-time Emmy nominee, for lead actress as Raven on Edge of Night, she left the soaps after the 1980s to become a nurse. Gabet also become an author.\n\nTom Eplin. Emmy nominated for lead actor for playing Jake McKinnon not for Another World but for As the World Turns, I think I recall Eplin having gone into real estate. That seems to be common among the soapsters, who left, and came from the serials which were produced in New York.\n\nYes, between Hallmark and the Lifetime Movie Network, it’s really not hard to get your fix of current, recent departed, and older soap stars. If you’re not particular you can probably find a soap actor (mostly female but some males as well) in a movie any day of the week.\n\nInteresting about the stars who then just blended into civilian life. Marcy Walker’s story is pretty well known, but I had no idea about the other three. Real estate and adjacent businesses do seem a popular haven for former soap stars. Kristen Alderson seems to love being in real estate, and Judi Evans has said she thoroughly enjoys her work selling burial plots when things are slow for her on the soaps."
