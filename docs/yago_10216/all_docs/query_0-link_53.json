        "text": "It comes as no surprise then that someone would live-tweet being hit on... by a married man.\n\nMelissa Stetten did just that Wednesday. According to her Twitter feed, she was on a flight with \"Touchback\" actor Brian Presley, who mused that it was \"divine interception\" that brought he and Stetten together. The actor said he was engaged for six months, but broke it off. In fact, he's married to actress Erin Hershey."
