        "text": "The PC Fan Club Dinners are now available on combination event dvds. I have combined the PC 2001 & 2002 Dinners on one dvd, and then I have combined the final two PC 2003 Events on another dvd. So all four PC Fan Club Dinners fit on two dvds. I have also combined the various PC SSW Events onto three dvds and you can view those write ups at https://www.angelfire.com/tv/curlyqgrl/ssw/menu.html\n\nPort Charles Fan Club Dinner Combination DVD #1 - 3:41\n\nPC Event #4 July, 2001 - SP - 1 hr 38 mins\n\nThe first half hour is of press room coverage and interviews with Brian Presley, Julie Pinson, Ion, Peter Hanson, Jay Pickett, Erin Hershey, and Nicholas Pryor.\n\nErin Hershey, Marie Wilson, and Jay Picket MC the event. Each actor is asked one question during the Q&A: Kin Shriner, Anne Jeffries, Susan Brown, Peter Hanson, Jon Lindstrom, Carly Schroeder, Lynn Herring, Denise, Julie Pinson, Thorsten Kaye, Ion Oberman, Brian Presley, Nicholas Pryor (Victor), and Pat Crowley (Mary Scanlon)\n\nAwards Given Out:\n\nCharacter We Would Like To See More Of - Gail Baldwin\n\nFavorite Scene Stealer - Brian Presley\n\nCharacter Most in Need of a Love Life - Gabrielle\n\nBest Love Scene - Kevin & Lucy Love On a Runaway Train\n\nBest Dressed Character - Libby\n\nFavorite Couple - Frank & Karen\n\nCouple You Would Like to See Together - Chris & Eve\n\nFavorite Storyline - Time in a Bottle\n\nFavorite Online Web Site - Erin Hershey's\n\nFavorite Offline Fan Club - Marie Wilson's (run by Debby O'Connor)\n\nInterviews during the luncheon: Anne Jeffries, Susan Brown, Denise, Marie Wilson, Thorsten Kaye, Kiko Ellsworth, Carly Schroder, Jon Lindstrom, Hope Smith (Producer), and Lynn Herring.\n\nPC Dinner August, 2002 #7 - 2 hrs 3 minutes\n\nI included shots of the Sportsman's Lodge Hotel, the soap boutique, the raffle items, pictures, interview with Tamika from Soap Center. In the press room, I interviewed George DeMoss (head of security), Joy (Marisa), Kiko (talks about his role in Bad Boys 3 coming in summer 2003), Eddie Matos (Ricky), Erin Hershey, Brian Presley, Brian Gaskill, Jay Pickett, Kelly Monaco. Erin and Brian P. are so adorable together. They talked about their wedding, travel over the summer, they moved, did a remote for PC (but wouldn't tell where). I just love them. Kiko is a nut and there is no one nicer. He announced that he is in Bad Boys 3 with Will Smith and Martin Lawrence. Really all of the PCers are such nice group of people. They all seemed very happy and were great with the fans.\n\nNo one would talk about the next book though Kelly said it was great and one of her favorites and she thinks might be the best one yet (SOD also reported this next one would be really good so I'm looking forward to it!). Note - she is NOTHING like Livvie! She says the next book is going to be \"pretty amazing\" and she thinks they have outdone themselves. Brian G. is more quiet and reserved, and very sweet. This was his first event and I don't think he had any idea of the attention he was in for. He hinted that \"fans of the past would be happy\" in regard to Rafe & Ally. I met Eddie (Ricky) and Joy (KC/Marisa) and there were both very enthusiastic. I talked with Susan Brown and Peter Hanson and they were very warm and gracious as always. I was relieved to see Jay Pickett there and he relished the fan's interest in whether Frank would survive the Avatar. All too soon it was time for the event to start. The actors were introduced, then the fan awards were announced.\n\nThen it was onto the main ballroom for the event. The actors are introduced and the following awards were presented:\n\nFavorite Supporting Actress - Erin Hershey\n\nFavorite Actress - Lynn Herring\n\nFavorite Supporting Actor - Brian Gaskill\n\nFavorite Actor - Brian Presley\n\nFavorite Couple - Rafe & Ally\n\nFavorite Storyline - Miracles Happen - accepted by Jon Lindstrom and Lynn Herring\n\nFavorite Online Fan Club - Kiko's\n\nAlso in attendance were Susan Brown, Peter, Lynn Herring, Jon Lindstrom, Thorsten Kaye, Marie Wilson, Carly Schroeder, and Nicholas Pryor.\n\nNolan North mceed the Q&A was absolutely hysterical. He came down to the ballroom floor while the rest of the actors remained on stage. I laughed so hard. Its a good thing I had a tripod or that would be one shaky video! When Jay was asked what he wore under his shroud he wowed the crowd with his answer, \"a size 10 pair of work boots and a thong!\" As Kiko talked about his summer, we could hardly hear his response as he talked longer, Nolan layed down on the floor pretending sleep and the audience is cracking up! Susan Brown brought a lei that she had handmade for the fan who had traveled the furthest. It was Andrea Hofer from Germany who attends each year. After the Q&A, the actors adjourned to the autograph tables. Everything seemed to go very smoothly, and Jon and Lynn's line was huge (just in case anyone was wondering why I didn't get to interviewing them. They had arrived later in the press room and were surrounded). Nolan held court and did a running monologue. I could have just stood there all night and listened to him! I also interviewed Carly, Nicholas, Marie, and a brief message by Thorsten.\n\nPC Dinner #14 August, 2003 - 2 hoursThis is a very heartfelt event. I included pre-event shots of the ballroom, fans lining up, raffle items. Then its off to the press room, interviews there with Miriam Parish (Reese), Brian Gaskill (he talks about B&B), Kelly Monaco (doing the switch with Ally & Livvie, and GH), Erin & Brian Presley (\"Eddie\", the switch), Marie Wilson (Karen) talks about her new project on location in Florida \"Catharsis\", Eddie Mattos (on SSW), Joy Bisco, Tamara, Cari Shayne (Karen on GH) & Alex Mendoza (Joe III). Then its off to the main ballroom - additional cast members in attendance: Imani Kent Masters, Anne Jeffries, Rebecca Staab, Michael Dietz, Susan Brown, Michael Easton, Thorsten Kaye, Jay Pickett and Kimberlin Brown. Each actors takes the mic and says something about each other, the show, what they will miss. This is a very touching tribute to each other and the show, with some good natured ribbing thrown in."
