        "text": "CEOFC News:\n\nFrom Soapcity:\n\nPC's Julie Pinson Heads to Y&R (from soapcity)\n\nFans of the now defunct series Port Charles have yet another reason to get excited. Julie Pinson, who played the role of Dr. Eve Lambert Collins Thornhart (1997-2002), joins the cast of The Young and the Restless as the enigmatic Shilo, described by Pinson as \"Hip, sexy and sassy.\" Pinson was kind enough to drop a few hints about her new character. \"She's a music producer. She's kind of a mystery lady. We're not sure what she's doing in Genoa City.\" But with musical talent such as J.T. (Thad Luckinbill) around town, chances are Shilo will have her hands full in no time.\n\nPinson had nothing but kind words to say about her new daytime gig. \"Everybody has been very welcoming,\" she enthused. \"They're all like, 'It's so good to have you here.'\" Pinson also revealed that she used to watch The Young and the Restless. \"I used to watch when Danny [Michael Damian] and \"Cricket\" [Lauralee Bell] were together. And Ashley [Eileen Davidson] was my favorite character. When her and Victor [Eric Braeden] first got together, I thought she was the most beautiful thing I'd ever seen!\"\n\nWhen asked if she still keeps in touch with her old cast mates from Port Charles, Pinson exclaimed, \"Absolutely. I'm going to call Brian [Presley; ex-Jack, PC] and Erin [Hershey Presley; ex-Alison, PC] just to let them know that I'm here at Y&R, because they're good friends with Thad.\" And Pinson, ever the dedicated Y&R fan, was quick and to the point when asked what she'll say when she meets Michael Damien for the first time. \"I'll just drool!\" she laughed.\n\n04/15/03\n\nThe Martini Night's Fanlisting is officially open. Fans of Chris and Eve's Martini nights, please take a moment to come over and join the fanlisting to show your support for Martini Nights gone by at Martini Nights Fanlisting!!!\n\nWith the one year anniversary of Eve's untimely place in the 5th chair, fans of Port Charles are still voicing their displeasure about the situation that had taken place. It seems that the hope for the eventual return of Eve Lambert is very much alive and is why I've decided to start the CEOFC. On this site you'll find links to other great Chris and Eve pages, video moments remembering the past between Chris and Eve and more so you'll find a haven for all Chris and Eve Fans.\n\nThe site is still under construction, but I promise you that as time goes on, you'll be able to interact with fans on our very own CEOFC message board, share your views about Port Charles and your favorite moments of the days gone by. Also on this site, we're going to try to keep you fans up to date with the news and gossip surrounding Chris, Eve and their portrayers the very talented Nolan North and Julie Pinson, so please check back often for updates. Thanks for taking a look around and we hope to hear more from you as the CEOFC gets off the ground here :-)"
