        "text": "Chummy Business\n\nBrian Presley (Jack) and Thorsten Kaye (Ian)\n\nSoap Opera Digest\n\nPublished April 1, 2003\n\nHow did you guys become friends?\n\nKaye (jokingly): \"He said he was a friend of mine?\"\n\nPresley: \"We just gravitated toward each other and started hanging out. We went over to their house for a cookout and ended up becoming close buddies.\"\n\nWhat do you have in common?\n\nPresley: \"[My wife] Erin [Hershey Presley, Alison] and Susan [Haskell, ex-Granya; ex-Marty, ONE LIFE TO LIVE; Kaye's girlfriend] joke that we're always doing something to our houses. We compare projects [laughs]. Thorsten's always tearing down walls in his house. And I'll be like, 'Hey, man, come over and check this out. What do you think I should do here?’\"\n\nKaye: \"We watch football, and we like the same things. We don't really talk about work; we talk about everyday stuff -- sports, life…He likes to drink a lot of beer, which is weird to me. But I'll usually have one with him [laughs].\"\n\nWhat do you admire most about each other?\n\nKaye: \"Without being condescending, he's like a little brother to me. I have tremendous respect for him -- not just because he's a great actor. The way he treats his family and carries himself, it's something everybody should strive for.\"\n\nPresley: \"We do joke around that I'm like his little brother; it's that kind of relationship. He's a very giving person. He'd give you the shirt off his back if you needed it. But I think the biggest thing is that he's not caught up in this business.\"\n\nThorsten, do you feel a responsibility to guide Brian?\n\nKaye: \"I can't guide anybody! I have problems guiding my car into the driveway. But if he asks me something, I will honestly answer him.\"\n\nWhen was the last time you hung out?\n\nPresley: \"For Thorsten's birthday, I brought him Omaha Steaks. He lives in walking distance, so it's no big deal. Erin is throwing Susan a baby shower, so I'll go over to Thorsten's and hang out while they do that at our house.\"\n\nKaye: \"Yeah, but he doesn't walk over! He always drives over. He ran once, but then he had to stay at my house for three hours to recuperate.\"\n\nDo either of you have a funny anecdote about the other?"
