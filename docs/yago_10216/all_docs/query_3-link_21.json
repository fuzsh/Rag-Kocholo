        "text": "As if the dating game was not already beset with enough ambiguous rules and pitfalls, now hopeful suitors may need to keep an eye on whether they’re going viral while bringing out their cheesiest lines.\n\nAt the very least, attention should be paid to whether the recipient of their wooing efforts is breaking away to tap away on their mobile phones for 140 character bursts at regular intervals.\n\nA married soap actor has found himself in that very bizarre situation as a 22-year-old model used Twitter to show him up as he apparently tried to chat her up during a plane journey.\n\nNew York-based Melissa Stetten yesterday live-tweeted an exchange between herself and married actor Brian Presley who was sitting next to her during the flight – and it seems he remained completely oblivious that their conversation was being relayed to her thousands of followers.\n\nAnd she claims that the 34-year-old from Oklahoma told her that he believed they were “brought together” by God on the flight.\n\nHaving expressed an unwillingness - on Twitter, anyway - to have a bit of a natter with the actor who has appeared in a guest role on Beverly Hills 90210, one of Stetten’s funniest tweets details how Presley mixed up his words as he claimed that their meeting was destined by a higher power.\n\n“Brian just said \"like us sitting here right now, taking about where we're from, it's like divine interception\". right, interception,” she tweeted.\n\nIt would appear that – according to Stetten tweets ? that Presley may have been caught out about his marital status as he engaged his unenthusiastic fellow passenger.\n\nStetten posted at a later stage of the commentary: “He said he was engaged for 6 months but broke it off! RT @Pat_Healy: @MelissaStetten Ask him how his wife Erin and son Jackson are.”\n\nPresley is alleged to have told the Michigan-born model that he was not married, which may be news to his wife of ten years and mother of his two children Erin Hershey Presley.\n\nHer tweet claims: “Brian said he was engaged to another actress but it didn't work out because they didn't mesh well together.”\n\nUnfortunately, some of her followers with access to keyboards and search engines were able to suggest that that may not be the case…\n\nBrian did eventually discover that the virtual world was ear-wigging on his conversation, and posted a message on Facebook to deny Melissa's claims that he had been drinking or cracking onto her, describing the incident as \"absurd and quite funny\".\n\n\"None of what this person said happened is true!\n\n\"I guess in today's age you have to be careful who you say hello too.\"\n\nCheck out Melissa’s series of tweets about her what she claims to be a cringe-inducing journey with thespian Brian below.\n\n------\n\n'No thanks, Brian, the actor sitting next to me on this flight talking about his role with Kurt Russell and his spiritual beliefs'\n\n'Brian is now talking about how he is an artist and believes everything happens for a reason, like how we're brought together on this flight'\n\n'Apparently Brian is a straightforward guy from Oklahoma who booked a McDonalds commercial when he was 19 and then God took over from there'\n\n'Brian hates closed minded people but loves artists in the industry, and just called this one-sided conversation a \"collabo\" between us'\n\n'Oh wow, Brian grew up on a ranch with uber conservative parents but his stance on gay marriage is ZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzz....'\n\n'Brian just said \"like us sitting here right now, talking about where we're from, it's like divine interception.\" right, interception'\n\n'Brian asked what I do for a living. I said model. He said \"oh I love meeting other artists like myself\"\n\n'Brian just finished working on a movie with Matthew McConaughey who inspired his \"craft\" immensely being a small town boy like himself'\n\n'Yes, this is BRIAN! RT @Pat_Healy: @MelissaStetten Is this him by any chance? http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0696169/'\n\n'He said he was engaged for 6 months but broke it off! RT @Pat_Healy: @MelissaStetten Ask him how his wife Erin and son Jackson are'\n\n'Brian likes going back home to Oklahoma to inspire the less fortunate to become \"artists\" like himself'\n\n'Brian just took his Heineken in a plastic cup into the bathroom. Will report back shortly'\n\n'Brian is back, he just ordered the chicken salad sandwich'\n\n'Brian's been looking for the headphone jack for 10 minutes'\n\n'Brian asked if I saw Book of Mormon. I said yes. He said he wanted to get into theater when he was a rodeo boy back in 'Homa (oklahoma)'\n\n'Brian said he was engaged to another actress but it didn't work out because they didn't \"mesh well\" together'\n\n'Holy s**t. He's had 3 heinekens and is wasted. Sober? Hardly. RT @PlaidMcPlatypus: did you say he was drinking beer?'\n\n'Did I just ruin Brian Presley's life via twitter?'\n\n'Who opens the windows on a redeye flight? Brian does. F***ing Brian'"
