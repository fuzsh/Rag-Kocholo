If u side w/Adam it’s SUICIDE and I understand “why” he feels he needs to be at that … (as I call it) House of Horrors to protect Babe and she will NEVER get it!, but it’s only going to end in disaster. Here we go again folks! Take a deep breath and let’s try to tread this crap until it blows away.\n\nI knew you would hate it but it is going to be good drama. And by the way Josh told Erica that he was going to get Babe today I do think that he will. Just give it time to work out.\n\nI’ve been thinking about this and maybe it could work. That is, “if” Josh plays along like he’s on Adams side kind of like a SPY! and then tells J.R. and Tad and Krystal what Adam’s REALLY UP TO!!! Then it may … u never know with these kinds of s/l’s. Because it could go bad or good on any given day… I guess we’ll just have to see! I know Josh vowed to get Adam back and maybe by “letting his enemy get closer” he can achieve his goals! I hope so!!!\n\nMan… I just hope everything works out good for everyone! Even J.R.! He’s tried so hard to keep his family happy and they can all still be happy even if they don’t stay together. I know a lot of split families that are very close even tho they’re married to different people.\n\nOn one of these threads… Someone made mention of replacing the “Babe” character with Erin Hershey Presley and I looked her up she’s very pretty and I heard she played on Port Charles! If she is a good actress I would “LOVE” her to take Alexa’s place because the part of Babe has become so huge to AMC!!! I’m not sure that was the plan, but that’s what happened and it would be a shame to lose such a main part with so much potential in s/l’s. JMO\n\nQuote BrianLovesSoaps:\n\nQuote Joshlvr: Man...

I know a lot of split families that are very close even tho they're married to different people. :)\n\nI agree, what is going on here today, Adam brings Josh home as his new son ??? Do you have any insight ???\n\nWell, at first … I wasn’t pleased w/ this s/l at all! But I think it might have legs!!! We’ll just have to wait and see. I’m hoping Josh has a plan in all of this madness because he vowed to get Adam back as u probably recall. I just can’t see him siding w/Adam against Krystal and Babe so he’s probably going to either be a spy or make people believe he is tight w/Adam then when all least expect it,… he’ll strike and save everyone!\n\nQuote Kane Man: \"Under ur Spell\" is the name of MyWildaze's utube of Babe and Josh.\n\nDid u like RUSH? I’m watching AMC right now! R U?\n\nRUSH is totally AWESOME, love it, have it bookmarked along with a few other Josh/Babe clips. I watched Todays AMC a couple hours ago, after the Buffalo Sabres game, they won thank you very much!\n\nHey, did you catch our Josh stud with his shirt off ? I immediately thought of you being out of your mind. (LOL)\n\nIt is soooo fun watching soaps knowing I can comment on them with other soapie friends. :))\n\nQuote BrianLovesSoaps:\n\nQuote Kane Man: \"Under ur Spell\" is the name of MyWildaze's utube of Babe and Josh.\n\nDid u like RUSH?

I am on here a lot more often than I used to be because my hours are different. I work early and get home early. My husband works till midnight so after dinner there’s nothing on usually so I like to chat w/u guys!\n\nI just wish we had more people on here that felt like us. There are a few like Sarah 95 and there are a couple others I think Fair Shar and Laughsoften also like Josh and Babe but most like J.R. and Babe so it’s kind of give and take on here! We sometimes have our good days and then our bad days and they swap w/us like that back and forth! HAHA\n\nI don’t think it’s that… just some of the people on here have experienced harrassment type relationships and when Babe kept sending Josh mixed signals, they felt he was being creepy because he wouldn’t let go. I think it’s romantic but they relate it to their “own” time of terror in the past that they couldn’t get rid of so I can understand. Luckily, I never had anyone that off the wall. I did date a guy 6 yrs younger than myself and told him not to get serious but of coarse he did and I had to have my mom tell him to stop calling but he finally did! I guess I was one of the lucky ones to not have to deal w/that in an extreme case!"
