        "text": "BRIGGS: This was only the seventh time this National Geographic special Gold Medal had been given to anyone, and it was the first time it was given to a woman. Amelia had joined the ranks of Commander Robert Peary and Admiral Byrd. The honor? For being the first woman to fly across the Atlantic, alone.\n\nAMELIA EARHART (AVIATRIX): I am deeply grateful. I have no words in which to express my appreciation to you and to the National Geographic Society. I fear that is too great an honor for my exploit.\n\nBRIGGS: In true modest Earhart fashion, she insists that it is merely an “exploit.” History would disagree.\n\nEARHART:Four years ago I went on the Friendship and had, as has been said … was simply a passenger. In England I was referred to as a sack of potatoes. That probably inspired me to try it alone.\n\nBRIGGS: Did you hear her nervous laugh in there? I mean, I think that gives something away: a little touch of embarrassment. The Friendship that Amelia refers to? That’s the 1928 Friendship Flight, which was the first time Amelia crossed the Atlantic in a plane. So, yes, she’s technically the “first woman to cross the Atlantic,” and she became famous for it. But she never flew that plane, she sat in the back. A sack of potatoes, so it was said.\n\nIt was quickly dismissed for what it was—a gimmick—and that humiliation became a defining moment for Amelia Earhart. It was at that point that she raised the bar for herself—and for others. Not only would she refuse to be a mere passenger ever again, she asked women to do the same for themselves. Her 1932 solo flight across the Atlantic was a clear signal that she was no longer interested in being along for the ride.\n\nAMY KLEPPNER: I don’t know any female searchers.\n\nBRAM KLEPPNER: The searchers are all men. Wow.\n\nBRIGGS: Are the searchers responsible for keeping Amelia’s story alive? Perhaps. But despite their efforts, it’s unlikely, albeit possible, that another expedition will reveal a satisfying end to this mystery.\n\nBUTLER: I hope Amelia Earhart is found, no matter where she is.\n\nBRIGGS: Susan Butler is onto something there.\n\nThe last chapter of this tantalizing whodunnit didn’t take place near a tiny Pacific atoll—or the deep waters surrounding it. Amelia’s legacy exists along a very different line of position.\n\nShe’s much closer than you think.\n\nIn fact, the final, indisputable clues of where to find Amelia exist somewhere inside her own story. In her own words.\n\nEARHART: The flight has added nothing to aviation. After all, literally hundreds have crossed the Atlantic by air if we count those who have gone heavier than air, lighter than air…\n\nBRIGGS: When Amelia received that National Geographic Gold Medal from Herbert Hoover, she made her case to women in no uncertain terms.\n\nEARHART: I hope that the flight has meant something to women in aviation.\n\nBRIGGS: And it may not have been obvious to the men in the audience.\n\nEARHART: If it has, I should feel it justified,\n\nBRIGGS: This piece of evidence has been overlooked and unexamined for decades.\n\nEARHART: But I can’t claim anything else.\n\nBRIGGS: The modesty of her sentiment—like the Earhart women who came before and after her—says volumes.\n\nDid Amelia’s work mean something to women in aviation?\n\nDiana Trujillo answers that question definitively. Her work at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory is a direct extension of a history that Amelia helped to build, and still has implications for the future.\n\nBut—if that brings us to 95 percent certainty—we find ourselves continuing to ask the question, How do we get to 100 percent?\n\nThe final chapter of the Earhart mystery contains one last clue to her whereabouts.\n\nBefore Amelia set off on her fateful round-the-world flight, she gave her husband another letter. This time, it was only to be opened if she did not return.\n\nIn a hard-to-read chicken scratch, which may have been hastily scribbled down, given the thousands of things she had to prepare for before she took off, here is what she wrote to him.\n\n“Please know, I am quite aware of the hazards of the trip. I want to do it because I want to do it. Women must try to do things as men have tried. When they fail, their achievements must be but a challenge to others.”\n\nThis sentiment belonged to Amelia. But it also belongs to me, and to so many millions of others.\n\nNow, more than 80 years later, we can thank our ability to choose a career, an education, whether or not we marry, what we are called—heck, even what luggage we buy—as challenges that were accepted by the multitudes who believe as much as Amelia did in equality.\n\nHer legacy—being reignited and pushed forward by new Amelias all the time—is not lost at sea, awaiting discovery.\n\nNo. I’d say it’s alive and well. And inside of all of us.\n\nIf you like what you hear and want to support more content like this, please rate and review us in your podcast app AND consider a National Geographic subscription.
