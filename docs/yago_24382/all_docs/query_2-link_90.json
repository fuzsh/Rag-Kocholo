        "text": "I set out to plan and complete a modern day flight around the world, to both honor Amelia Mary Earhart’s legacy\n\n—and define my own.\n\nWhen Amelia Rose Earhart decided to honor her namesake, aviation pioneer Amelia Mary Earhart, she did it in the biggest way possible — by becoming the first person to pilot a single-engine Pilatus PC-12-NG around the world. The journey to successfully complete this 28,000 nautical miles flight included challenges and obstacles, but ultimately taught her invaluable lessons about life.\n\nIt was an odds-defying achievement that included more than two years of route and logistical planning, extensive flight training, open water survival training, and recruiting, training, and leading a team of 100 people. Utilizing the invaluable concept of a flight plan to achieve her dream, Amelia crafted a strategic business plan to design, fund, and market her flight. In the process, she developed a large and passionate social following and forged almost $2 million in partnerships with 28 corporations. Through the Fly with Amelia Foundation, a nonprofit she founded to foster the next generation of women in aviation, Amelia granted 10 flight training scholarships to women ages 16-18 as she circled the plane over Howland Island, the area of the South Pacific Ocean where Amelia Earhart disappeared.\n\nAmelia’s story of hard work, determination, and dedication resonates deeply with many audiences. She takes them along on her epic flight—from Howland Island to touching down on the same runway where she departed in 1937—drawing powerful comparisons to how we lead, work as teams, handle turbulence, and boldly journey into uncharted territory with confidence. Amelia has earned rave reviews from audiences ranging from the Fortune 500 to the United States Air Force Academy. Her upcoming book, Learn to Love the Turbulence: Flight Lessons on Becoming the Pilot in Command of Your Own Journey teaches readers how to navigate the inevitable storms that come with taking flight toward the life we were meant to live.\n\nBefore flying around the world, Ms. Earhart was best known as a television news anchor and reporter, covering breaking news, traffic, and weather in Denver and Los Angeles. She continues to use her professional interviewing and polished presenting skills as an emcee and moderator. Her story has been featured in major media outlets, including CNN, The New York Times, The Today Show, and others."
