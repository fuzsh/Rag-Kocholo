Her celebrity made possible the lucrative product endorsements, speaking engagements, and public appearances that helped finance her flying. With her publicist, George Putnam, Earhart carefully built and maintained her reputation—both to support her own flights and to promote the general growth of aviation.\n\nAmelia Earhart understood the power of fame. Her celebrity made possible the lucrative product endorsements, speaking engagements, and public appearances that helped finance her flying. With her publicist, George Putnam, Earhart carefully built and maintained her reputation—both to support her own flights and to promote the general growth of aviation.\n\nDetailed Description\n\nAmelia Earhart Visiting Children at Toynbee Hall Settlement, London's East End, June 22, 1928\n\nPhotographic print\n\nAfter her June 1928 transatlantic flight with Wilmer Stultz and Louis Gordon, in which she became the first woman to fly the Atlantic, Amelia Earhart was given a hero's welcome wherever she went. Receptions in Southampton and London, England, were followed by a ticker-tape parade through New York City and a visit with President Calvin Coolidge at the White House.\n\nUse default description of artifact\n\nAmelia Earhart Meets Richard Byrd aboard SS President Roosevelt, Returning from the Transatlantic Flight, July 6, 1928\n\nPhotographic print\n\nAmelia Earhart was congratulated by explorer Richard Byrd for her 1928 flight across the Atlantic Ocean. Earhart, riding as a passenger with pilot Wilmer Stultz and mechanic Louis Gordon, made the crossing in a Fokker F.VII Tri-Motor airplane. Byrd used a similar Fokker on his North Pole flight in 1926.\n\nUse default description of artifact\n\n\"'Girl Lindy' Sets New Ocean Air Speed Mark,\" 1928\n\nClipping (Information artifact)\n\nAfter becoming the first woman to fly across the Atlantic Ocean in 1928, Amelia Earhart was immediately -- inevitably -- compared to the similarly lanky Charles Lindbergh, whose 1927 solo transatlantic flight made him the world's most famous pilot. For his part, Lindbergh appreciated all that \"Lady Lindy\" did to bring press attention to aviation -- and to take it off him.\n\nUse default description of artifact\n\nAmelia Earhart with the Automobile Received from Chrysler Corporation, July 11, 1928\n\nPhotographic print\n\nSkilled aviatrix Amelia Earhart came to national attention in 1928, when she was invited to become the first woman to fly the Atlantic--as a passenger.

Arguably, she remains America's best-known female pilot even today.\n\nUse default description of artifact\n\nAmelia Earhart and George Putnam Leaving the Aero Club of Pittsburgh, 1929\n\nPhotographic print\n\nIn 1928, publisher and publicist George Palmer Putnam began to heavily promote aviatrix Amelia Earhart through a book, lecture tours, and product endorsements.

The garments--with simple lines and mid-range prices--were inspired by Earhart's interest in functional clothing for active living. The brand's label featured Earhart's signature, along with a soaring red plane. Despite publicity garnered by Earhart's foray into clothing design, the line didn't catch on with the public.\n\nUse default description of artifact\n\nWoman's Home Companion Magazine for August 1934\n\nMagazine (Periodical)\n\nFamous aviatrix Amelia Earhart launched a fashion line in 1934. The garments--with simple lines and mid-range prices--were inspired by Earhart's interest in functional clothing for active living. For those who couldn't afford the ready-made versions, sewing patterns for some of Earhart's designs were available through Woman's Home Companion magazine. Page 33 of this issue features an Earhart two-piece dress.\n\nUse default description of artifact\n\nAmelia Earhart in Pace Car as Honorary Referee at the Indianapolis 500, May 30, 1935\n\nNegative (Photograph)\n\nCelebrities are a longstanding tradition at the Indianapolis 500. Actors, musicians, athletes, politicians, and automotive industry leaders all have played various ceremonial roles in the race's festivities. Amelia Earhart served as an honorary referee at the 1935 race. The pace car that year was a Ford Model 48 convertible sedan, driven by Ford executive Harry Mack.\n\nUse default description of artifact\n\n\"Lady with Wings, the Life Story of My Wife, Amelia Earhart,\" 1939\n\nClipping (Information artifact)\n\nAmelia Earhart married publisher George P. Putnam on February 7, 1931. She was a reluctant bride, fearing that marriage would derail her career. Earhart kept her last name and insisted on an equal partnership with her husband. Putnam agreed and the couple's relationship was professional as much as it was romantic. Earhart's husband supported her aviation activities and promoted them vigorously.\n\nUse default description of artifact\n\nPoem, \"For Amelia Earhart\" by Nathalia Crane, 1937\n\nClipping (Information artifact)\n\nAmelia Earhart's enduring fame is due in part to the mysterious nature of her disappearance. Since her failure to reach Howland Island in 1937, Earhart has been memorialized in poems, plays, novels, songs, and films. Many theories on her fate have been proposed but, whatever happened on that last flight, Earhart's life remains a source of inspiration today.\n\nUse default description of artifact\n\nOrenstein Trunk Company Amelia Earhart Brand Luggage Overnight Case, 1943-1950\n\nSuitcase\n\nFamed aviator Amelia Earhart needed money to finance her flying--product endorsements provided a way. Introduced in 1933, the Amelia Earhart luggage line--marketed as \"real aeroplane\" luggage--was sturdy and lightweight. It sold well for decades--long after her 1937 disappearance attempting an around-the-world flight. Amelia Earhart's \"brand\" remained strong. Her name could still sell.\n\nUse default description of artifact"
