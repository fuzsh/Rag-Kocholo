        "text": "Louis “Slim” Gordon (left), the mechanic and copilot of the Friendship, and Wilmer (Bill) Stultz, the plane’s pilot, pose with Amelia Earhart on the SS President Roosevelt during their return trip from England after their successful transatlantic flight in June 1928. Earhart referred to the steamship crossing as “our first ocean voyage” because “it was then that we came to realize how much water we had passed over in the Friendship. Eastbound the mileage had been measured over clouds, not water. There never had been adequate comprehension of the Atlantic below us.” The photo appears as the frontispiece of Earhart’s first book, 20 Hrs., 40 Mins. (1928)."
