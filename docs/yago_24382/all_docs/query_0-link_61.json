        "text": "\"George Palmer Putnam bids his wife, Mrs. Amelia Earhart goodbye and good luck before her departure here this morning at 5:57 A.M. on her second attempt to fly around the world, accompanied by only Capt. Fred Noonan. She headed for San Juan, Puerto Rico, a 1,181-mile non-stop hop and first leg of the journey in her twin-motored Lockheed monoplane, carrying 600 gallons of gasoline for the approximately 7-hour trip.\"\n\nReversing traditional gender roles, Earhart left Putnam at home while she went on trips. This was the last time they saw each other. When Earhart and Fred Noonan failed to reach Howland Island, Putnam and Noonan's wife waited in San Francisco for news. U.S. ships combed the area around Howland for seventeen days; no traces of the plane or its inhabitants were ever found.\n\nCredit line\n\nThe LIFE Magazine Collection, 2005"
