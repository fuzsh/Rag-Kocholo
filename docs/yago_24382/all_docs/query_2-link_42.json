        "text": "A granddaughter tells her grandmother's life\\ Sally Putnam Chapman writes a book about her grandmother, who lost her ----------------\n\nOne day the old woman gave her life to her granddaughter.\n\nThere were 10 diaries in all, books bound in leather, and they covered her life from 1907 to 1961. ``Sally,' she said, ``I think you're ready for these.'It was an amazing act of trust, for the old woman had held nothing back. She had written about infidelities that could have cost her her marriage and children, had written of the anger she felt when the husband she hadn't wanted anymore began a steady pursuit that won him Amelia Earhart.\n\nThe older woman was Dorothy Binney Putnam, known to her grandchildren as ``Dofry,' which was as close to ``Dorothy' as the young children could get. The younger woman was Sally Putnam Chapman, her granddaughter, the family historian.\n\nAnd now Sally Chapman has used those diaries and written ``Whistled Like a Bird,' the story of her grandmother's willful life, and of the rough triangle she was a part of. The other parts involved her husband, publisher George Putnam; and Amelia Earhart, the famed aviatrix, the first woman to fly the Atlantic and a willful woman.\n\nSally Chapman began gathering material for her book in 1976, interviewing her grandfather's partner and old fliers who knew Amelia. ``But I wasn't ready to write the book,' she says. ``Most of what I wrote at that time was about Amelia, who was my idol, and my grandfather. It wasn't until later I realized that wasn't the book that needed to be written.'\n\nWhat needed to be told was the story of her grandmother, a Crayola crayons heiress who was a cross between Auntie Mame and Erica Jong's Isadora Wing. Dorothy Putnam was a woman yearning for self-definition who became good friends with a woman who already had plenty of self-definition, only to see that woman fall under the sway of her husband.\n\nShe was a woman who wanted more than the constricting roles of wife and mother, but she seemed oblivious as to what more might mean.\n\nSo Dorothy Putnam did what people in dead marriages have done since time immemorial: She began an affair, in this case with George Weymouth, her son's tutor, 19 years her junior.\n\nPutnam's diary entries are full of a society matron's chafing and fretting about her role. But when George Weymouth was on the scene, she was a woman unleashed, as in this entry from Nov. 17, 1927: ``G.W. came out from Philadelphia, just before supper arriving in a violent rainstorm. A thundershower, vivid lightning and wild wind. A weird night altogether, and apropos to unusual exotic dreams of unbelievable things for hours and hours. Theatrical - all night!'\n\nThis was no mere fling, but a high dive into deep romantic water. Dofry tried to justify it on social grounds. ``Why is it there are so many men who consider love outside the bonds of matrimony the privilege of the male only?' she wrote.\n\n``She needed to be needed,' says her granddaughter. ``George needed her in the beginning of their marriage, but then less and less.'\n\nThere has been much speculation over the years about the precise nature of the relationship between Putnam and Earhart. Certainly Putnam was the pursuer. Earhart signed on with obvious reluctance, as this excerpt from a soul-searching letter Earhart wrote Putnam on Feb. 7, 1931, shows. Essentially, it's a prenuptial.\n\n``On our life together, I want you to understand I shall not hold you to any medieval code of faithfulness to me nor shall I consider myself so bound to you. If we can be honest about affections for others which come to either of us, the difficulties of such situations may be avoided.\n\n``Please let us not interfere with the other's work or play. ...In this connection I may have to keep some place apart - where I may retreat from even an attractive cage, to be myself.'\n\nNot exactly a love match. But George Putnam's teenage son saw them embrace without knowing anybody was watching, and believed it to be a complete marriage.\n\n``Would she have married him if he hadn't been a powerful publisher?' asks Chapman. ``I doubt it.'\n\nSally Chapman's own father, George's son, believed that Amelia was the dominant partner in the relationship.\n\nThe George Putnam that biographers of Earhart have portrayed over the years is a driven, pale character, narrowly focused, not very interesting. The man Sally Chapman knew as a child was ``shy and tender and afraid. He really and truly wanted a quiet and private life, and was afraid of an intrusion on his privacy.'\n\nChapman believes it was a relationship that was more in the modern model of a two-career partnership, rather than a co-mingling of Tristan and Isolde.\n\n``They didn't fall passionately in love, so the marriage didn't end when the passion ran out. She needed him to achieve what she needed to achieve. My grandmother didn't love him, and he felt wonderful to feel needed again. I think the marriage would have lasted.'\n\nBut that's speculation, for Amelia Earhart has been missing in action for 60 years, ever since she and her navigator disappeared near Howland Island in July 1937.\n\n``Whistle Like a Bird' has a plaintive, romantic, Gatsby-ish quality. There are diary entries from Dorothy Putnam like this, from July 1928: ``Amelia, Dave, George and I drove to Ogden Reid's home to a bathing suit party. Perhaps 40 guests, young and old in bathing suits, plus a fancy costume. Dinner on the terrace, moonlight and an orchestra, then afterwards a delicious swim in heavenly pool.'\n\nYet, after the era of moonlight and champagne ended, nobody got what they wanted.\n\nAmelia wanted to be a great flier and be famous; early death was not in the equation. George Putnam wanted Amelia; he was never the same man after she disappeared, when he left the family business and spent a fortune searching for his wife. He was running a hotel in Death Valley when he died broke in 1950.\n\n``He lived an entirely different sort of life after Amelia,' says Sally Chapman. ``He didn't care about money.'\n\nAs for Dorothy Putnam, she wanted to be more than a gracious wife and mother, but that just happened to be her greatest gift.\n\nHer talent was only fully expressed when she built Immokolee, her house on the outskirts of Fort Pierce, built after her marriage to Putnam broke up in 1929. It's a stunning house, but not an overpowering one.\n\nDorothy Putnam's marital luck didn't improve until the end; her second husband was an alcoholic who beat her with a whip, her third the gifted artist and poet Don Blanding, author of ``Floridays.'\n\nIt was only with her fourth husband that she got lucky, and Lew Palmer died after only four years of marriage. She never remarried. She had finally gotten it right, and had no need to do it again.\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\n* I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy."
