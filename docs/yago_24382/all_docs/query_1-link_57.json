        "text": "Explorer, Publisher, husband of Amelia Earhart. Although he was a publisher, explorer and author in his own right, G.P., as he was called, was probably best known as the husband of Amelia Earhart. He directed the flight that launched Earhart to fame as the first woman to span the Atlantic by air in April 1928, as well as her first solo transatlantic flight and other ground- breaking flights. Their marriage (his second of four marriages) ended when the aviatrix disappeared during her ill-fated attempt to fly around the world in 1937. Born into the family of publishing house G. P. Putnam's Sons, he was responsible for the publication of Charles Lindberg's autobiography \"We.\" Putnam authored several books, including \"Soaring Wings,\" a biography of his daring wife; \"Wide Margins,\" an autobiography; \"Smiting the Rock,\" \"In the Oregon Country,\" \"Hot Oil,\" \"Death Valley and Its Country,\" and \"Hickory Shirt.\" He served in both World Wars as a lieutenant of field artillery in World War I and as a major of intelligence in World War II. Perhaps his greatest personal achievement came from two expeditions he led to the Arctic in the mid-1920's. He died at Trona Hospital following four weeks' treatment for euremic poisoning.\n\nBio by: Shiver Name: George P Putnam\n\nBirth Place: Rey, New York\n\nBirth Date: 7 Sep 1887\n\nService Start Date: 21 Sep 1918\n\nService Start Place: Deschutes Co Oreg\n\nService Start Age: 31\n\nRYE CHRONICLE\n\nCopy and Search for: \"George P.
