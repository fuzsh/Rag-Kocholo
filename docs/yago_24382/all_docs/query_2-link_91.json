This was originally published a few days ago in Slate, and now its competitor Huffington Post--a pure aggregator--has gone and copped it.\n\nEven funnier is that this is ancient news, perhaps even non-news. The pre-nup has been published in every substantial Earhart biography for the last 30 years, yet the Slate author claimed to have \"stumbled across it,\" as she put it, in the Purdue University archives. (She'd have saved a lot of time by Googling it.)\n\nThese poor bloggers are so driven to publish something, anything, that they'll soon be posting that the sun comes up in the east. And then the -real- news, that actually the sun isn't \"coming up\" at all...\n\nGeorge was Putnam, by the way, not Putman."
