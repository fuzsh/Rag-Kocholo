        "text": "By Tyler Treadway of TCPalm\n\nFORT PIERCE — Two-time Academy Award-winner Hilary Swank might be the star of the upcoming movie “Amelia,” but Sally Chapman of Fort Pierce will be paying closer attention to co-stars Richard Gere and Virginia Madsen.\n\nIn the biopic about famed aviator Amelia Earhart, Gere portrays Chapman’s grandfather, George P. Putnam, and Madsen plays her grandmother, Dorothy Putnam.\n\nA publishing mogul, George Putnam was the chief promoter of Earhart’s flying career. Dorothy Putnam was one of Earhart’s best friends, Chapman said. The Putnams divorced in 1929, and George Putnam married Earhart in 1931.\n\nThe movie opens nationwide Friday, but Chapman will be at the world premiere Tuesday night in New York, a special guest of the movie’s producers.\n\nChapman said both Gere and Madsen seem to be “perfectly cast.”\n\n“When I saw Richard Gere in a preview,” said Chapman, 71, “his whole personality reminded me of my grandfather: soft-spoken and serious. And they’re both tall and slender.”\n\nChapman said Madsen, is, like Dorothy Putnam was, “very sophisticated, very gifted and very intelligent. I think she’ll have a great feel for the role. Although physically she doesn’t resemble my grandmother, she has the same style.”\n\nChapman, who wrote the book “Whistled Like a Bird: The Untold Story of Dorothy Putnam, George Putnam and Amelia Earhart” with Stephanie Mansfield based on Dorothy Putnam’s journals, noted that while George Putnam was having an affair with Earhart, Dorothy Putnam was having an affair with George Weymouth, a man 19 years her junior.\n\n“My grandfather didn’t leave my grandmother for Amelia,” Chapman said. “My grandparents just had a bad marriage.”\n\nBut it’s an alleged affair — between Earhart and pilot Gene Vidal (played by Ewan McGregor) while Earhart was married to George Putnam that has Chapman upset about the movie.\n\n“I’ve spoken to my family members and Amelia’s family members,” Chapman said, “and I’ve never heard about this affair.”\n\nThe story of the affair came from Gore Vidal, the writer and son of Gene Vidal, she said, “and he would have been all of 8 years old at the time. Even if it was true, which I don’t think it is, it’s unfortunate that the movie makers felt they had to put it in just to generate ticket sales.”\n\nAfter divorcing George Putnam, Dorothy Putnam moved to Fort Pierce to be close to her father, Edwin Binney, the inventor of Crayola crayons who wintered in Fort Pierce. Dorothy Binney married three more times and built the Immokolee mansion west of town where Chapman and her husband, Jack Chapman, now live.\n\nWhen Dorothy Putnam died in 1982 at age 93, a story in the News Tribune referred to her as “one of Fort Pierce’s most prominent benefactresses.”"
