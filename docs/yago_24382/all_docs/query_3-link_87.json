        "text": "Amelia Earhart never had a plan. She didn’t have a career path or a list of things to accomplish in life — to become a celebrity, a wife, a hero. She just wanted to fly, because it thrilled her, and she did what she needed to be aloft as often as she could.\n\nSeventy-two years after she disappeared over the Pacific Ocean, Earhart remains an object of fascination for the mystery surrounding her final flight and the thoroughly modern way in which she fashioned a path for herself in a world yet to treat women as equals.\n\nThis year, especially, she’s in the air, inspiring fashion — from bomber jackets to khakis — and major movies. In “Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian,” Amy Adams took a turn as the spunky flyer, and in the biopic “Amelia,” out Friday, double Oscar winner Hilary Swank is playing the lead.\n\nEarhart was born more than a century ago, in 1897. But even today, her androgynous glamour, cool confidence and refusal to accept limits make her seem like a forerunner of contemporary strivers such as Martha Stewart, Serena Williams and Hilary Clinton — smart, tough women who defied expectations, setbacks and mockery to become leaders in their own right.\n\nEarly on, Earhart clearly wanted to do things her own way. In her teens, she started a scrapbook, clipping and pasting a random collection of articles about female veterinary surgeons, credit managers, trade union leaders, upholsterers and game wardens. Their particular jobs didn’t seem to matter. The women she chose all had one thing in common — they broke barriers. They were singular people, pioneers, expressing their unique passions and talents.\n\nIf Earhart had a life goal, it was to be who she was and do what she wanted to do. She loved men, but she hated the thought of losing control of her own life. There were “lots of things worse than never getting married,” she said in her 20s, and one of the worst, she declared, was marrying someone “who tied you down.”\n\nNo wonder her life resonates today. A recent study shows women, struggling to balance expectations and hopes, are unhappier than they’ve been in decades.\n\nWhen Earhart did get married, to her publisher and business manager, she was 33 and already famous as the first woman to cross the Atlantic in a plane. Just before the casual ceremony, she gave her husband-to-be, George Palmer Putnam, known as G. P., a note she’d written that morning. It was brutally clear: “I shall not hold you to any medieval code of faithfulness to me nor shall I consider myself so bound to you.”\n\nPutnam was shocked but he smiled, took Earhart’s hand and married her anyway. As her manager, he had carefully crafted her image as a hero — a Lady Lindy who inspired other women — but he knew, perhaps better than anyone, that Amelia’s fierce independence and attraction to risk were no fabrications.\n\nEarhart knew Putnam, scion of the publishing family, would guide her public career and make sure she could earn enough money to fund her passion for flying. But she also realized that marrying him wasn’t playing it safe. Ten years older than she and set in his ways, he could be abrasive — explosive and moody, with an ungenerous streak — while she was quiet, dreading drama and confrontation.\n\nYet Putnam respected her need for autonomy and independence. He was “the one person,” she decided, “who could put up with me.” They were already partners, in romance and the high-flying “hero business.”\n\nEarhart caught the flying bug in 1920, after watching an air show in Los Angeles with her father. Soon after, she began taking lessons and working for a local telephone company to pay for the exorbitant costs of fuel, training and her very first plane. A Kinner Airster, it cost $2,000, nearly six times the price of a Model T Ford. Earhart painted it yellow and called it “The Canary.”\n\nWith a flying license and a sleek set of leathers and boots, Earhart spent the next six years working a variety of jobs, writing aviation articles and making press appearances as that new-fangled rarity of the Jazz Age — the lady pilot.\n\nPutnam, who had a knack for wrangling firsthand accounts from adventurers such as Richard Byrd, heard that socialite adventurer Amy Guest sought “a suitable American woman” to make the first airborne Atlantic crossing. His search led him to Earhart, then a social worker living in Boston.\n\nCrossing the Atlantic by airplane in 1928, just a year after Charles Lindbergh’s historic flight, was a deadly business. Three women had recently died trying, but the danger of the adventure, Earhart admitted, thrilled her beyond words; she couldn’t say no. Putnam, she confided, was thrilling, too. In Boston, before she left on the transatlantic flight, he was glued to her side, ”romancing a property,” as a friend put it.\n\nTo play up her striking resemblance to Lindbergh, a lure for the press, Putnam staged photos of his fetching “girl flyer” in breeches, leather coat, high-laced boots, helmet and goggles. Putnam was even more smitten by his Lady Lindy weeks later, when she successfully crossed the Atlantic as a passenger in a plane flown by Wilmer Stultz and crewed by mechanic Lou Gordon.\n\nBefore the journey, Earhart penned what she called “popping off letters” to her parents in case she died. To her father, she wrote, “Hooray for the last grand adventure! I wish I had won, but it was worthwhile anyway.” When the flight landed in Wales, Earhart became a sensation, though it galled her that she wasn’t the pilot, only a passenger, like a “sack of potatoes.”\n\nTo make sure she wrote a book about her experience at breakneck speed, Putnam brought her back to his sprawling home in Rye, NY, where he lived with his wife, Dorothy.\n\nPutnam was used to strong women. Dorothy Binney Putnam, the Crayola crayon heiress, was tall and athletic, a champion swimmer, fearless and “addicted to risk.” Their domestic arrangements, moreover, were hardly conventional. When Earhart moved into the Putnams’ home, Dorothy was having an affair with a young college student, and within weeks, Putnam and his pilot protégé had become a couple.\n\nEarhart now had a new career, as a national hero, and Putnam organized a full schedule of commitments to keep her profitably in the public eye. Earhart’s goal was never international stardom. But aviation was an expensive passion, and the rule, she knew, was “No job, no pay, no fly.”\n\n“The Lady Lindy thing” was the money earner at hand. That meant nearly nonstop tours of paid lectures, appearances, receptions and “chicken and peas” dinners at clubs, colleges and halls across the country. Earhart did what she had to do — in order to do what she loved. Marrying Putnam after his divorce was in a way part of the job. Though their passion had cooled by then, they understood and needed each other.\n\nFour years after she first crossed the Atlantic, she crossed that ocean again, this time piloting the plane solo, the only person besides Lindbergh who’d been able to do it. People said it was madness and suicide for a woman to try, but Earhart got a rush from the risk, the thrill of doing “first-time things.”\n\nA stony fatalist, Earhart never worried about crackups or dying. She had records to set. The same year as her solo Atlantic flight, she became the first person to fly solo, nonstop, from coast to coast. And in 1935, she was the first person to fly solo across the Pacific, from Hawaii to California.\n\nIn 1937, Earhart wanted to be the first person to circle the world at the equator, the longest route and ultimate flying challenge. Many of her friends worried about the trip. One, Louise Thaden — a pilot famous for setting speed, altitude and endurance records — urged Earhart to cancel the flight, saying she had everything to lose and nothing to gain.\n\nBut Earhart persisted, despite crashing her twin-engine Electra in her first attempt. If she died, she explained, it would be doing what she most wanted to do.\n\nEven so, before she left on June 1 for that last flight around the world, Earhart had a strange feeling that she might not make it. The only thing she really feared, however, was getting old. She wouldn’t feel completely cheated, she said, if she didn’t come back.\n\nShe and navigator Fred Noonan took off from Oakland, Calif., heading east with planned stops that took her to Puerto Rico, down to Brazil, across Africa, over Arabia and into Pakistan and India. From there, she made her way to Thailand and Singapore, finally landing in Australia a month later.\n\nOn July 2, she and Noonan took off from New Guinea for their next stop on Howland Island, 1,800 miles southwest of Honolulu. They had almost circled the entire world. They had nearly made it.\n\nAn hour before her last radio message, Earhart was trying to spot either the island or a Coast Guard cutter assigned to assist her flight. “KHAQQ calling Itasca. We must be on you but cannot see you. But gas is running low. Been unable to reach you by radio. We are flying at 1,000 feet.”\n\nIn one of the last letters she sent home, Earhart said it had been “a grand trip.” It was a joy, an adventure she had always dreamed of. She never felt better. She was flying forward, toward a destiny of her own making. It was her choice, and she was happy to live — or die — with the consequences.\n\nShe and Noonan may have run out of gas and crashed into the Pacific, sinking 17,000 feet down to the silty bottom. Or they may have landed on a coral island and survived as castaways for a short time.\n\nHowever she died, Earhart lived on her own terms. She followed her joy. It wasn’t a safe choice, but it was a rich life.\n\nAs long as it lasted, it was a thrill.\n\nSusan Wels is the author of “Amelia Earhart: The Thrill of It” (Running Press), published this month."
