SAN FRANCISCO, July 6, 1937 (UP) -- George Palmer Putnam, motion picture executive and husband of Amelia Earhart, went into seclusion today in the home of a San Francisco doctor.

Mr. Putnam was exhausted by his vigil at Coast Guard headquarters, where he has been awaiting word from his lost wife and her navigator, Captain Fred Noon, since Friday when they went down at sea.

Friends said Mr. Putnam was "completely worn out and badly in need of rest."

Before he left the Coast Guard station Mr. Putnam expressed his belief that naval and Coast Guard ships were searching the wrong area for the fliers.

He said he believed Miss Earhart and Captain Noonan were down on a reef in the Phoenix Islands, south of Howland. Naval charts show no land in the area 281 miles north of Howland, where vessels are conducting their search. The Phoenix group is dotted with small coral reefs.

Mrs. Noonan resumed her household duties today.
