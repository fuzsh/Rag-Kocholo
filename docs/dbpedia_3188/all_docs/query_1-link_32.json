        "text": "Ricky Gervais is well aware that he sometimes annoys people even when he doesn’t mean to. \"I think they’ve fallen too much—my fault—for my arrogant persona, my smug award-acceptance speeches, my pseudo-showing off,\" he suggests. Of course that sort of response is an occupational hazard for anyone who bluffs nasty in modern-day comedy land. But is there something else—something less knee-jerk and more serious—that is beginning to trouble the rest of us about Ricky Gervais?\n\nSome part of it may be the inevitable falloff when your first outpouring is as remarkable and innovative as The Office was: a new kind of show that was mercilessly acute at laying bare the hubris and self-humiliation in everyday life, yet still somehow hilariously and lovingly so. His next sitcom, Extras, may have neared the same heights, but few people said that about the third, Life’s Too Short; and his latest, Derek, was greeted with as much derision as acclaim when it premiered in his British homeland. But it may be more than that. I think there is a sense that someone who seemed like one of us, and on our side, may have slipped his moorings.\n\nTake his three years hosting the Golden Globes. Gervais clearly reveled in a self-appointed role as provocateur of, and truth teller to, the wealthy and overcoddled. \"I’m the jester in the court of the kings there,\" he explains to me. \"Who am I meant to have a go at? The homeless? This wasn’t a roomful of wounded soldiers, this was a roomful of the most privileged people in the world who are about to win an award.\"\n\nEven if his individual jabs, put under scrutiny, were neither quite as searingly truthful and justified nor quite as brave as they laid claim to be (Charlie Sheen likes to party! Robert Downey Jr. knows jail! Unnamed film-star Scientologists are in the closet!), it was indisputably an entertaining turn that livened up the awards season. But it did also heighten a sense that Gervais might now be in the self-congratulation business for real, someone starting to enjoy his own mean streak just a little too much.\n\nGervais’s public career did not begin to germinate until he was 37, when an unlikely series of events led to the chance to create The Office, his very first attempt at anything like this. If fame comes only in the middle of life, and there have been no desperate compromises made to achieve it, perhaps it sits differently. His achievements since have been remarkable, and Gervais fights his corner and defends the integrity of what he does with verve and passion: He is fierce, funny company, all the time tiptoeing forward and backward along an impossible tightrope, trying to convey how deeply he cares about all he does while doing his very best to suggest he couldn’t care less.\n\nGQ: You’ve often said one reason the character of David Brent worked so well is because he has a blind spot about how people see him.\n\nRicky Gervais: Yeah. That’s exactly what we’re laughing at.\n\nDo you ever worry that could be true about yourself?\n\nThis will sound arrogant: I don’t worry about it at all. I think I’m pretty self-aware. I think I know what I’m doing. You know when you’ve been a prat, you know when you’re being a prat, you know when something sounds pretentious. But you’re right—by definition you don’t know. It’s funny, Christopher Guest said to me—we were talking about comedians we used to like and if people go off the boil—and he was basically saying: \"What if we become the people we don’t rate anymore? What if we lose it and we don’t know it?\" And I went [grins],\"Who cares?\"\n\nSurely you’ve already heard people saying that you’ve lost it?\n\nYeah. But then I sell 30,000 tickets in an hour. So what have I lost? What do they mean: I’ve lost it? They mean they don’t like Derek as much as Extras? Science as much as Animals [two of his stand-up specials]? They mean they don’t like me. That’s what they mean. So they’re trying to justify their dislike in a critical response. That’s what I think, if I’m being brutally honest. They have to say The Office was good—they have to. Not because it was, but because most people think it was. But I do love that Joseph Heller quote. A journalist said, \"If I’m being honest, I don’t think you’ve ever written anything as good as Catch-22.\" And Joseph Heller said, \"Who has?\"\n\nOver the years, you’ve been very articulate about why you wouldn’t, and shouldn’t, ever go back to David Brent.\n\nNo. No, I said I wouldn’t do another episode of The Office. I assume your question is: Why am I bringing it back now? [Gervais recently made a film about Brent’s life ten years on for the telethon benefiting the British charity Comic Relief.] I’m not, quite. I’ve made it clear it’s not The Office. And it’s a ten-minute sketch—I think it’s been taken way too seriously. It’s like a little nugget. But...never say never. One day it might... but I don’t want to say that, because I don’t want it to cloud everything else I do.\n\nWhat if someone thought, \"Oh, I can see why you would want to return to David Brent now—to really remind people why they loved you\"?\n\n[Looks appalled and shocked] Oh. No. If they don’t love me for what I’m doing now, forget it. Oh no. Oh no, God. Kill me. Really. If I’ve only got a career if I bring David Brent back, you can have it. No. No, I do it for me and like-minded people. That’s it. That’s it. My career, I look at it in a Darwinian framework. I’m going to do exactly what I want, and I’m going to survive or I’m not. I’m not going to pander, I’m not going to change things, I’m not going to do focus groups. I’ll live and die by the sword. I don’t care. Because I couldn’t live with myself.\n\nAn important part of the way you think about yourself is that you’re the outsider, the underdog. But there’s a moment in Talking Funny [a documentary in which Gervais debates comedy matters with Chris Rock, Louis C.K., and Jerry Seinfeld] where you’re all discussing how to talk about your wealth onstage. You say, \"I do it ironically, like I’m better than people...but I’m playing that card, so I’m actually saying I’m not better than them.\"\n\nYeah, I’m going out there and I’m confronting the elephant in the room: You know, I go first class on jets, and so I’m going to play the prat about it so you’ve got something to laugh at.\n\nBut that seems like the most monumental \"have your cake and eat it\" stance. You do it offstage, too—sometimes on your blog you’ll post a photo of yourself in front of a private jet, or in a helicopter, and you’ll write something like \"Yeah, and then we had dinner with the Seinfelds and Jake Gyllenhaal...\"\n\nBecause it means nothing to me. [pauses] I don’t mean that. I mean: I’m not like that. I don’t care. I’d rather sit at home in my pants [i.e., underwear] watching telly with my girlfriend when it comes down to it. I do feel more at home with mates down the pub. I’ll give you an example: When The Office broke, I was invited by the BBC as a VIP thing to a David Bowie concert. I’m still living in the same flat—it’s not like I became a millionaire overnight. And there’s me, Jane [Gervais’s girlfriend since he was 21], Salman Rushdie, talking to David Bowie. The next day I was in the pub with my mate and he went, \"What did you do last night?\" and I went, \"Nothing.\"\n\nYes, but then you became friends with David Bowie. That’s real.\n\n[Considers this] Yeah, that is real. I don’t think he knew who I was at the time, and then I got an e-mail from him saying, \"So I watched that Office. I laughed. What do I do now?\"\n\nHow did you reply?\n\nI said, \"That’s weird. I just replaced Aladdin Sane on CD and then I get an e-mail from its composer.\" I just started mucking about. I think it was two performers liking each other’s work.\n\nAnd you stayed in touch during Bowie’s lost years, when he seemed to disappear. What would you communicate about?\n\nMusic and comedy. I think I might have said what a huge fan I was. And I think he liked my stuff. He introduced me at Madison Square Garden—you are asking! I got him to do a little thing in Extras. I remember we went round his flat, and it’s exactly as you’d expect it to be—just beautiful and tasteful and modern, and there’s this wonderful statue. And I went, \"Oh, that’s amazing.\" [slips into a perfect David Bowie impression] \"Yeah, the artist, what he’s trying to do there is do the 3-D representation of Picasso’s 2-D representation of 3-D...[pauses]... My daughter likes to hit it with a hammer.\" I love people like that, because they’re sort of aware of who they are. The first time he buzzed me in, the concierge called up [to his flat] and said, \"Mr. Jones?\" Of course he’s Mr. Jones! He’s not fucking David Bowie! I met David Jones.\n\nDid it feel weird that it seemed for a long time that the song he did in Extras might be the last David Bowie song?\n\nYeah, it did. But I can’t deny that there are some things that give me a buzz. He’s been a musical hero of mine for thirty years. When I called him up and I’d written \"Little Fat Man\" [in the episode, Bowie, playing himself, is annoyed by Gervais’s character at a posh bar and makes up a song on the spot: \"Pathetic little fat man / No one’s bloody laughing / The clown that no one laughs at / They all just wish he’d die\" and so on], I said, \"Have you got the lyrics?\" and he went, \"Yeah.\" I said, \"Can you do something quite retro, like 'Life on Mars'?\" And he went [deadpan], \"Oh, of course, yeah, sure. I’ll knock off a quick 'Life on Mars,' shall I?\"\n\nWould you ask him why he wasn’t doing anything when he was silent?\n\nNo. I would never do that. I went the other way. I remember, I think, the first time that I knew him when it was his birthday, I sent him an e-mail that said \"57???? Isn’t it about time that you got a proper job? Ricky Gervais, 42, comedian.\" He sent back: \"I have a proper job. David Bowie, 57, Rock God.\"\n\nAnyway, I was asking you about taking photographs of yourself with private jets...\n\n[Laughs] David Bowie is the one that you picked on where I would say I’m friends with him! Most people think that I’m best friends with Sam Jackson, because he was in an episode of Extras...and I’m just not. I don’t know anyone.\n\nBut my point was that it’s almost like you want to present that you have these interactions—the private jets, the famous people—almost by accident, or ironically, as though they’re not your life. But surely they are your life. You’re someone who knows a lot of famous creative people, someone with an unimaginable amount of money...\n\nIt’s easily imaginable. You mean \"lots.\" You don’t mean unimaginable. The universe is unimaginable. A square circle is unimaginable. God is unimaginable. [Thinks about the wider question] You know what? I don’t know what to say about it.\n\nBut my question isn’t about wealth, it’s about the attitude you project.\n\nI think you’re right—it’s the same thing as the onstage persona and the knowing famous people and me being arrogant when I win an award. I think it comes from the opposite end of the spectrum. Because when I first made it, I was ashamed of the money. I remember the first check I got for The Office, and it made me feel sad. It ruined it. I think it’s because I’d tried my hardest at anything for the first time with The Office, and I couldn’t have been prouder. Emotionally so. And I was 40, and my dad was a laborer with no money, and my mum had no money, and they both died with no money, and there’s nothing I can do about it, because they died before I earned any money myself. But that didn’t matter, because there was sort of a nobility in poverty. And so I think I do all of this as a sort of reaction. And I can’t bear to think how this will come out in print. I don’t want to hear a rich man talk about his poverty. I don’t want to hear it. I want to go: \"Fucking shut up! Give it back!\"\n\nDuring all those years when you were working in more normal jobs [booking bands at a college, working off-air at an indie-rock radio station], were you trying hard to be a comedian?\n\nNo. I thought I was funny, because I made people laugh all the time. I was never thinking: Fuck me, I’ve got to fucking be a comedian soon. I didn’t try. I just thought I was a funny bloke.\n\nDid you have lots of churning ambition?\n\nI would sort of have to say no. I’m trying to work out if I’m lying or not—if I did but was scared to say it. Or just forgot about it. I don’t think I did. I was never ambitious. I was never ambitious at school. I just thought everything would be all right. I had a lovely, stable relationship, good friends, good family, I had a nice job. It was all right.\n\nWhen you write something now like \"I’m a cocky cunt who likes to annoy people...\"?\n\nWell, it’s not really true, is it? It’s not, is it?\n\nI don’t know.\n\nIf you ask me if I think I’m a cocky cunt, I don’t think I am. This will sound cocky: I think I’m a very sweet, considered man who worries about people’s feelings in real life, and I think I’m a performer. I go up there with a swagger, I take a deep breath, and I go, \"All right, losers—who wants a piece of this?\" That’s what I do. Do I like to annoy people? No, I don’t really, unless they’re friends and it’s funny.\n\nLast night you tweeted \"Hope you enjoy my stand-up. If you don’t please let me know because I don’t give a fuck.\"\n\nYeah. We’d been out to dinner, and I’d just got back. It was because I was getting loads of tweets that Science was on TV, and everybody was tweeting me lovely things, so instead of going, \"Oh, thank you so much, I really appreciate it,\" I thought it was more in character. My stand-up persona of not giving a fuck. I was going along with the persona of the comedian that says the unsayable. Which isn’t true. Comedians who say the unsayable don’t usually get TV specials. I’m very considered. I can justify every joke I’ve ever made, really.\n\nYou once went on a British chat show and when the host noted that you were looking newly fit and trim and asked how come, you replied, \"AIDS.\"\n\nThe joke there is that it was small talk. If that was the answer, I wouldn’t have said it. But what’s wrong with it? How would people be offended?\n\nWell, to joke about a disease that is killing loads of people...\n\nI do that all the time! I do it all the time. If you can’t joke about the most horrendous things in the world, what’s the point of jokes? What’s the point in having humor? Humor is to get us over terrible things. That’s all it’s for. That’s why you should laugh at funerals. Of course it’s the wrong thing to say. That’s why it’s funny.\n\nYou’ve said many times that your ultimate yardstick about whether something is all right to joke about is: \"Is it coming from a good or bad place?\" Is it arrogant to think you can judge that?\n\nIt’s not that it’s arrogant, it’s just that I don’t know of any other judge. Outside of popularity. And popularity and democracy aren’t a judge, they’re just stats.\n\nYou’ve said your new show, Derek [Gervais plays a helper in an old-people’s home; it’s an improbable fusion of absurdism, vulgarity, hilarity, and syrupy parable], is about how the most important virtue is kindness, and that this is also what you believe. I think that may surprise people.\n\nI hope so. I hope it is surprising. If I don’t surprise, just watch The Office again. If I don’t constantly surprise and polarize, there’s no point, really. But I haven’t suddenly got kind to write Derek, I just haven’t put it in a comedy before. Because it’s dangerous. People don’t get it. People don’t understand it. They want comedy or they want drama—they don’t want you to mix it. I’ve just never had the nerve to do it before. I knew some people would hate it, I knew some people would slag it off. I just wanted it to be some people’s favorite show. Without some people loving it, I’ve fucked it completely. I wanted to be sincere. I wanted to drop the veneer of irony from this one. I tried to make it more visceral. I didn’t want it to be smart-ass. I didn’t want it to be clever. I didn’t want it to be satirical. I wanted it to be broader brushstrokes. I wanted more obviously painted villains and more obviously painted niceness. I wanted it to be good and evil. I wanted it to be God and the Devil. I wanted it to be the outside world and a nest.\n\nDo you think your history may work against it? That people will look for a kind of joke that isn’t there and worry that if they buy into it on the level it demands, then it may be making a fool of them?\n\nYeah, that’s right. But people expected an unhappy ending for The Office, and they were surprised it was a happy ending. I’d never given them any clues to the contrary, except that it was quite a cynical look at human behavior.\n\nIn fact, almost everything you’ve created has ended up in a sentimental place.\n\nI only want that. I want everything to be all right. I can create my own heroes and villains, and I can make everything all right.\n\nBut in Derek the sentimentality is far more obvious.\n\nIt’s there all the time. That’s because the themes are more imminent. With The Office, it’s about being 30. With this it’s about being 80, so the stakes are higher. It’s the end of your life. Everything I’ve done has been existential. Everything, really. Everything is always about, \"Am I living a good life? Am I making the most of my life?\" Even Flanimals [Gervais’s series of children’s books featuring surreal invented animals] is about the futility of existence and deconstructing nature.\n\nYou should put that on the cover.\n\nYeah. \"For 3 to 5 years. You are all going to die. And there’s no heaven.\"\n\nSo now with Derek you’re getting a new kind of criticism.\n\nToo sweet?\n\nToo sentimental. Too broad.\n\nAll I know is I’ve had about a million tweets from people saying, \"I’m a 42-year-old roofer and I’m crying my eyes out.\" That’s fucking great. Much better than \"I laughed my arse off.\"Much better. They got it. It was about 99 percent \"best thing you’ve done.\"\n\nIt did get some fairly savage British reviews.\n\nIt was the usual suspects, the same four or five journalists who have hated everything. It bored me, but it didn’t bother me. I could have predicted what they’d say.\n\nBut when someone says \"vile, cynical, and dishonest\"? Or an \"appalling piece of comedy hackwork\"?\n\n[Chuckling] Both of those made me laugh when you said them. \"Vile, cynical...\" [laughing more] That’s something you’d say about Charles Manson, not a bloke who made a twenty-three-minute sitcom! \"Vile, cynical, and dishonest\"! \"What’d he do?\" \"Did a sitcom...\" [falls on his side to the sofa, he is laughing so hard] Cunts!\n\nBut can you just brush it off?\n\nYeah. Who said it?\n\nI can’t remember specifically right now.\n\nRight. But who wrote and directed Derek?\n\n[Puzzled] You did.\n\nYou remember that, don’t you?\n\nDoes it feel weird that the American version of The Office has reached its end?\n\nYou know, it wasn’t my baby. It was my rights, so I cashed the checks. I think it was good, but I didn’t have the same emotional attachment to it.\n\nI guess most people think it wobbled when Steve Carell went.\n\nHonestly? I don’t think I’ve seen much of it.\n\nYou don’t watch it?\n\nNo. It doesn’t feel like it’s mine. Now and again I’d watch one on a plane.\n\nDidn’t they used to send you scripts?\n\nYeah.\n\nWhen did that stop?\n\nI looked at the first few and said \"great\" and then I had things with elastic bands around them, I hadn’t even opened them.\n\nBut you made a crazy amount of money from it?\n\nYeah, more than anything else probably I’ve ever done. It’s the gift that keeps on giving, syndication.\n\nRight now you’re filming the next Muppets movie.\n\nIn terms of Hollywood, that’s arguably the biggest thing I’ve done. I’m the lead in a big film. I’ve been a bit part in a big film, and I’ve been the lead in small films.\n\nWhat do you like about doing it?\n\nI’m laughing all day. I love the Muppets. Honestly, I get there in the morning and they go [he mimes the humans slipping their hands into their puppets] and I go [talking only to the newly animated Muppets] \"All right?\" It’s terrible. I wish they were real. I’m disappointed that I know there’s a man’s hand up there. Who doesn’t want a frog as a mate? Is that a weird thing to say? It is, isn’t it?\n\nYes.\n\nI love animals. Growing up, the two things that made my blood boil were religious intolerance and animal cruelty. I’ve never understood it. I can’t stand to have an animal in pain. I’ve got to get it out of my head. It makes me angry, I want to cry, I want to stab someone. I don’t know where that comes from, really.\n\nIs it true that you’d like to open a wildlife sanctuary?\n\nYes. When everyone asked, \"What ambition have you got?\" I could never think of one. That’s the only thing I could think of, that I’d want my life to be: just my house, but I open the back doors and it’s like a fucking Disney cartoon. I want fucking muskrats and beavers and horses and three-legged wolves and blind bears. I wouldn’t want for anything else. My life now, with every endangered or hurt animal saved.\n\nAnd how would you spend your days?\n\nJust rolling around with dogs and wolves and bears. Yeah. Still weird, isn’t it?\n\nYes.\n\nWhenever I do a thing about animals, there’s always someone that goes, \"What about children dying in Syria?\" Yeah, that’s bad, too—can’t we care about both? Sometimes I go, \"You carry on all your good work for the fucking children in Syria, and I’ll do this.\" I love the fact that there’s a hierarchy of things that you’ve got to care about. I tweeted \"I love humans—they’re just not my favorite animal.\" That was to annoy people.\n\nTrue, though?\n\nNo, I’m not a maniac. Of course humans are my favorite animal. [pauses] But I’ve never met an animal who was a cunt."
