        "text": "The path of mastery captures deep understanding and insight — it’s not a path that is laying a bet now, by investing in a craft, for payment or recognition at some later time. The spoils of victory might just happen, but the orientation of the intent is paramount.\n\nToday we are becoming overwhelmed with the need for instant reward, immediate verification that we are significant — as a misguided attempt to satiate our thirst for meaning and belonging — rather, we are propelling ourselves toward an emptiness that can only be filled by temporary pleasures.\n\nOur need to belong, to understand, to explore, to connect to others and the world around us, to know safety and to know risk, to express and create are foundational to the human experience.\n\nMastery is a journey — It’s a curious and wonderful trail — that has few, if any, guides. It’s much more than the pursuit of expert performance. It’s far deeper than high performance and the achievement of success.\n\nIf Mastery is a path, let’s learn from as many voices as we can. The best in the world, from worlds who happen to have cameras pointed at them — AND — from the worlds in which no camera is present — either by design — or because culturally we might have forgotten to be curious about their path and insights.\n\nSimple Joys."
