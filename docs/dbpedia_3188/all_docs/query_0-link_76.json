        "text": "Ricky Gervais has told social media users that his latest ad for his vodka brand has been \"disqualified from TV\" for mentioning a rival.\n\nIn November, it was announced that the British comedian has become the co-owner of Ellers Farm Distillery, and would subsequently be leading promotional efforts for the company's leading brand, Dutch Barn Orchard Vodka.\n\nOn Friday, the After Life star took to X, formerly Twitter, to share a video of himself promoting the vodka as he stood beside a bottle of the spirit.\n\n\"Hi, I'm Ricky Gervais, and this is Dutch Barn vodka,\" he said. \"It's a beautifully crafted premium spirit, it tastes great, and it's friendly to the environment. It's known as the posh one in the brown bottle. But if you can't afford it, just get Smirnoff.\"\n\nCaptioning the clip, Gervais said: \"This ad was disqualified from TV with some bulls*** reason about mentioning another product. How the f*** have we said anything bad? I'm being oppressed.\" The star rounded out his post with a laughing emoji.\n\nGervais had previously posted the same comedic commercial on X back in February, adding the caption: \"Worst Advert Ever.\"\n\nThe comedian stated on social media back in April that another Dutch Barn Orchard Vodka advert of his—which clearly would not have passed advertising standards—was \"banned\" from TV.\n\nIn the clip, which Gervais had previously posted in March, the former Golden Globe Awards host was seen standing alongside fellow comedian Red Richardson.\n\n\"You like a drink, don't you?\" Gervais asked Richardson while patting his stomach. \"I think vodka is probably better than beer in terms of calories per unit of alcohol, although I doubt it will make a dent in you. You're fat because you eat too much, aren't you?\"\n\nRed, who wore a white coat while portraying a doctor, agreed, saying: \"No exercise.\"\n\n\"You won't be laughing when you have to have your feet removed from diabetes!\" Gervais quipped in response, before branding his ad co-star a \"fat c***.\"\n\nCaptioning the clip, Gervais wrote: \"Not only is this banned from TV but we're not even allowed to use it as promoted ads on social media. It's all down to you lot reposting it. I'm slowly destroying my own company for a laugh.\"\n\nAs of press time, the clip has been viewed more than 1 million times.\n\nGervais' signature comedy style has been employed throughout promoting his vodka brand. In a video posted to the company's YouTube account in November, he said of the vodka: \"It tastes great, it's made from British apples, we're committed to sustainability and the protection of the ecosystem.\n\n\"And the best bit is, this could literally make me hundreds of millions, so please buy it. Sure, like all strong liquor, it may damage your liver and your well-being, but think how happy it'd make me if [you bought it].\""
