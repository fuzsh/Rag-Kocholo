        "text": "Welcome to Wrath Month, our post-Pride series dedicated to embracing our queer anger. Read more here.\n\nAlthough transphobia in stand-up comedy is certainly not a new phenomenon, it has become increasingly mainstream over the last several years thanks in large part to two industry powerhouses: Dave Chappelle and Ricky Gervais.\n\nThese seasoned comedians, with a collective 72 years in the field, have devoted much of their recent output to attacking transgender people with the sort of crass, surface-level observations you’d expect to hear from a conservative uncle at your dinner table. By vocally doubling down on their transphobic stances, their prejudice could end up becoming their legacy.\n\nI’ll quote their Netflix specials sparingly, as much of their material is deeply offensive, and we’ve all had the worst of it repeated and relentlessly thrust upon our timelines already. When one of their hourlong shows is released, the internet buzzes with analysis, clapbacks, and think pieces. As a comedian myself, I do think there are important questions to answer amid the discourse: Should streamers begin censoring their artists? (No.) Do comedians have a social responsibility to their audiences? (Yes.) Should all male comedians retire at 40? (Probably. Just kidding! Or am I?)\n\nFor me, though, as a cisgender ally, the most puzzling question is this: why do these high-profile cis men devote so much time to undermining, invalidating, and dehumanizing trans women?\n\nI ponder this more as a disappointed fan than an angry crusader, though I am certainly outraged by this baffling turn toward transphobia. Like many other comedians all over the world working at every level, I grew up watching Dave Chappelle and Ricky Gervais on TV. They have created and produced some of the greatest works of comedy in the last 30 years (Chappelle’s Show, Extras, and The Office, to name a few). And now we are being forced to watch them devolve into loud, stubborn, out-of-touch, bigoted old men.\n\nI do not think the solution is to shut them out. And I’m not self-important enough to think that Dave Chappelle and Ricky Gervais give a shit about my opinion. Rather, the people close to them — agents, managers, friends, collaborators — should be pleading with them to reconsider their position on these issues, or at least to reconsider broadcasting their regressive views on one of the world’s biggest streaming platforms. There is still a chance to turn these harmful missteps into teachable moments for them as well as their fans.\n\nExpressing my views on this privately in green rooms and group chats no longer feels like enough. And while publicly criticizing people at Chappelle and Gervais’s level is intimidating, why let fear censor me? Aging male comedians certainly don’t let it stop them. Because I’ve been performing stand-up shows in the wake of all these Netflix specials and the interviews that follow, I’ve also seen firsthand how Chappelle and Gervais inadvertently give license to younger comedians to talk about trans people in the same damaging way. We cannot passively allow this to continue.\n\nThe phrase “transphobic comedy” is itself a misnomer because transphobia isn’t really comedy.\n\nA comedian’s job, at its core, is to take what is topical and make it relatable and funny. The heightened visibility of the trans community offers the average lazy comedian an immense amount of material to pull from. It’s very easy to poke fun at something you don’t understand and has suddenly become the topic of widespread discussion. Meanwhile, those of us who have begun to recognize the needs, wants, and struggles of trans people know that their mere existence is not a joke.\n\nWhat’s more, trans people are really fucking funny. The trans comedians I know — people like Nori Reed, Patti Harrison, and Nico Carney — aren’t just doing irreverent bits about their own experiences. They’re advancing the form as a whole. Conversely, what Chappelle, Gervais, and many other cis comedians are doing does not take any effort or critical thought. Ignorantly reducing trans women to a conversation about genitals is not only abhorrent and outdated. It’s literally embarrassing.\n\nRicky Gervais spends much of his transphobic rant in his latest special, SuperNature, whining about how — and I’m paraphrasing — women have “beards” and “cocks” now. He observes that a sentence like “women don’t have penises” would not have been widely considered offensive 10 years ago. Correct. And as society progresses, so must our language and our intentions.\n\nGervais has insisted that his commentary does not seek to skewer “trans folk, but trans activist ideology.” I have trouble seeing how demanding that trans women “lose the c*ck” is any sort of coherent critique of trans activism. If anything, comments like these reveal a bizarre and widespread fixation on what trans people have between their legs, which really isn’t anyone’s fucking business.\n\nIn The Closer, Chappelle argues that trans people have not faced enough oppression (keep in mind: anti-trans violence in 2021 was the highest ever recorded, trans girls have been banned from playing sports in several states, and Missouri lawmakers are considering a ban on gender-affirming care in adults) and that “the only reason transgender politics are a topic is because white men want to do it.” He chooses to overlook the fact that people of color are more likely to identify as transgender than white people, according to the Williams Institute at the UCLA School of Law.\n\nChappelle often offers up Caitlyn Jenner as an example of both the ostensible whiteness of trans politics, and as a representative of the community as a whole. Using Caitlyn Jenner as a case study for trans women is like using the Titanic as a case study for ships. There are plenty of things to lambaste Caitlin Jenner for — like that fatal car crash, for starters — and yet the most controversial thing she has done in Dave Chappelle’s eyes is suggest she would pose nude in Sports Illustrated.\n\nI find myself wondering if Gervais and Chappelle have bad intentions or if they have simply run out of things to talk about.\n\nAs comedians who are trying to remain prolific in later chapters of their careers — Chappelle has put out 11 specials since 2000 and Gervais has released 8 since 2003 — I have no doubt it has become harder for them to mine personal experiences to generate material. It’s telling how often they reference online backlash in particular; now that they’re exorbitantly wealthy, both comedians are almost certainly having fewer day-to-day experiences that come across as relatable to their fans. In their bubbles, the temptation is strong to source from social media, where there is an endless supply of opinions on every side of an issue.\n\nI’ve been a comedian for a small fraction of the time they have and I realize how difficult it can be to consistently write material that is topical, poignant, and funny. But that is the job. And even in my short career, I have learned the value of handling sensitive issues with more care.\n\nBy contrast, it seems like Chappelle and Gervais are taking major steps backwards in how they are shaping the comedic landscape. It’s telling, for example, that trans men are largely missing from the observations they make in their specials. Trans women stand alone as the subjects of their “punchlines,” which points to an obvious reason for their obsession: misogyny.\n\nJust when all of the “my wife is a bitch” or “women aren’t funny” jokes have been told, new targets have presented themselves. And please note, Ricky Gervais also has several jokes about how there are no funny women.\n\nBoth of these comedians have attempted to defend their viewpoints by citing principles like “freedom of expression,” with Gervais claiming in SuperNature that he is actually treating trans people equally by making jokes about them.\n\nFollowing Stick & Stones, Equanimity, and The Closer from Chappelle, Netflix also recently released a 40-minute speech he gave at Duke Ellington School of the Arts in Washington, D.C. under the title What’s in a Name? In it, Chappelle claims that the students of Duke Ellington who challenge him on his jokes are “instruments of oppression” and that critiques of his recent work remove the “artistic nuance.” Having watched his specials, I can tell you that if there was any artistic nuance to be found in the material, it was removed long before release.\n\nSome of Chappelle and Gervais’ defenders have tried to further minimize their cultural impact by saying that they’re “just comedians.” But comedians are unlike other celebrities in that they have built successful, decades-long careers on expressing their opinions on whatever topics they so choose, and accruing incredible influence over their fan bases in the process. People look to them as cultural commentators and, unfortunately in some cases (cough, cough, Joe Rogan), thought leaders.\n\nChappelle and Gervais are performing at the highest level. They go largely unchecked by their fans, and if Netflix did try to censor them, they would simply find new homes for their comedy. As unfortunate as the situation is, their fixation on trans people has become our problem.\n\nComedians don’t take an oath to “do no harm.” There is no governing body in comedy. No elected board who will review anyone’s jokes before they can tell them. Part of the responsibility for Chappelle and Gervais falls on their peers in an industry where they yield power. Ideally, influential figures in comedy like John Mulaney would be pushing back on transphobic humor instead of giving it a platform; instead, it’s fallen to younger comedians with more to lose to hold them to account.\n\nIncreasingly, comics who might ordinarily fear the consequences of speaking out (like losing a future job opportunity) are publicly criticizing these powerful men. It is clear that we cannot let the burden fall completely on the trans community to defend themselves. It was refreshing and impactful to see Jerrod Carmichael, for example, condemn Dave Chappelle’s tirades in a recent interview with GQ Magazine, creating space for other comedians who also object to the material.\n\nChris Rock also jokingly asked if the attacker was Will Smith.\n\nI am by no means a perfect ally, but I believe that as cisgender people, support for the trans community begins with empathy and understanding. And that doesn’t mean texting a trans person you know and asking them questions. Read. Listen. Learn. Watch comedy from trans people like Robin Tran, Jes Tom, River Butcher, and many more.\n\nWith Chappelle referring to audiences as “brittle” more than once over several specials and Gervais claiming in SuperNature that anyone who defends a marginalized group is virtue signaling, I suspect a white liberal snowflake like myself using the written word to denounce their obsession with trans women is probably satisfying to them in some ways. You’re welcome! I am merely exercising that famous “freedom of expression” I’ve heard so much about.\n\nIt’s ultimately unclear whether this is all performance or if Gervais and Chappelle hold these beliefs to be true in their personal lives. The harm is real either way. As they say, a man is only as good as his word.\n\nGet the best of what’s queer. Sign up for Them’s weekly newsletter here."
