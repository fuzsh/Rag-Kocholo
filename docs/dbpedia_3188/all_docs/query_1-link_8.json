        "text": "In our recent podcast episode, I had the opportunity to talk with Dr. Michael Gervais , the Founder of Finding Mastery . He's a famous psychologist and author with over 20 years of experience working with top athletes and business leaders. Our conversation focused on some really important things like how we talk to ourselves, taking deep breaths, and using mental techniques like meditation and mindfulness. These things can help us handle stressful situations better and boost our self-esteem without needing others' approval.\n\nDr. Mike began his journey when he was just 16 and realized he cared a lot about what others thought of him. That's something many teenagers go through as they try to figure out who they are. But for Dr. Mike, it led to a lifelong exploration of understanding human behavior and finding out who we really are. He shared how the fear of what others think, also known as FoPo, can influence our choices and our lives.\n\nDuring our chat, Dr. Mike stressed the importance of knowing yourself better. When you understand how your mind works, you're less influenced by what's happening around you. He talked about three ways to improve self-awareness, with mindfulness being one of them. Mindfulness is a practice that's been around for a long time, and research shows it can be really helpful.\n\nOne of the big ideas we talked about is having an identity that's based on how well you do things. In other words, do you define yourself by your achievements? Dr. Mike said it's essential to work on three main things: getting better at what you do, taking care of your body, and working on your mental skills.\n\nWe also discussed how some companies are starting to pay more attention to their employees' mental health. They're investing time and resources in helping their workers handle stress better, which is pretty cool.\n\nA significant part of our conversation was about self-discovery. Dr. Mike asked, \"Who am I, really?\" This is about going beyond the roles we play in life and understanding our true selves. It's a question that can lead to personal growth and understanding.\n\nIn sports, Dr. Mike told us how fans can be very fickle. They love you when you do well, but they can turn against you quickly. The key is to keep improving yourself, no matter what others think.\n\nWe wrapped up our talk with the idea of going from being a small puddle to becoming a vast ocean, which symbolizes growing into a more resilient and confident person. Dr. Mike shared some practical tips like journaling and surrounding yourself with wise people. It's all about recognizing your worth and being true to yourself.\n\nWe also gave you a sneak peek into Dr. Mike's book, \"The First Rule of Mastery,\" which is all about overcoming the fear of what others think and focusing on your personal growth.\n\nAs we finished, I shared a personal story about how I used to be scared of public speaking but learned to embrace it as a chance to connect with others and share knowledge. We also talked about the importance of having a support network of people who understand the challenges you face.\n\nOur episode is full of wisdom, and it's for anyone who wants to do better in life, whether it's giving a big presentation, facing challenges, or just living your everyday life. Give it a listen, and let's keep the conversation going.\n\nHere is the playlist to our conversation:\n\nNick Glimsdahl is a podcast host, contact center strategist, speaker, and author.\n\nHis ultimate goal is to harmonize customer expectations, employee needs, and business objectives, thereby creating seamless experiences that are unmatched.\n\nNick is known for his Press 1 For Nick podcast and serves as the Director of Contact Center Solutions at VDS.\n\nThe podcast features an impressive roster of guests from renowned organizations such as Chick-fil-a, The Ritz-Carlton, Crumbl Cookies, Zappos, Google, Starbucks, and Disney. Besides, Nick has interviewed best-selling authors, scientists, TEDx speakers, researchers, and even hostage negotiators."
