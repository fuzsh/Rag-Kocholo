        "text": "Voters in the Gervais School District were passing the district's $28 million school bond by a wide margin, according to initial returns in the Tuesday election.\n\nVoters who live in and around Gervais were deciding for the ninth time if they support a school district bond for building renovations and improvements.\n\nVoters in the Gervais School District were asked to pass a $28 million school bond to be paid back over 25 years.\n\nResidents in the district that includes Gervais and unincorporated communities including Brooks and a vast swath of farm land between Woodburn and Salem would pay $1.85 per $1,000 of assessed value in the primary election. For homeowners with an assessed value of $250,000, the bond would increase their property taxes by $462.50 per year.\n\nThe district has received a $6 million grant from the state, but can only use that money if voters pass the bond. It also has about $650,000 left from selling property and a $250,000 grant to remodel an area for a culinary arts program.\n\nIf the bond passes, the money will be used for a host of improvements to the district’s three buildings including:\n\nBuilding new classrooms and a commons building for the middle school.\n\nReplacing the roof at the high school and safety and heating and cooling improvements\n\nReplacing the heating and cooling at the elementary school, along with safety and accessibility improvements at entrances.\n\nSuperintendent Dandy Stevens said the school board has indicated that if the bond doesn’t pass this time, it will vote to close the district.\n\nIf that happens, children who attend schools in the district will be sent to schools in other districts in the area, she said.\n\nGervais is one of three school district in the Willamette Valley where residents aren’t currently paying for a school bond or levy. The last bond passed in the Gervais School District in 1991."
