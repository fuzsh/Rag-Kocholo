        "text": "If you’ve ever dealt with loss and grief, I recommend the Netflix series After Life. Ricky Gervais deals with the subject head on using Tony, a character who has lost his wife to cancer. I know, it sounds depressing. But, honestly, give it a go––it’s hilarious and comforting. Plus, he’s using a song of mine in the next season and that’s why he gave me a shoutout."
