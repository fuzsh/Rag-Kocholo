        "text": "A colleague has challenged me to talk to Ricky Gervais about nothing except The Office, to pretend that nothing has happened in his career since – no Extras, Ghost Town, Night at the Museum, stand-up, Flanimals children's books, podcasts. Ignore his new film, The Invention of Lying, which I don't much like anyway, and yet another movie, Cemetery Junction, out next year. Just talk about The Office, his career watershed, masterpiece, legacy, obituary. I bet that would really rile him, said my colleague mischievously.\n\nI dismissed this strategy, largely because there is something about Gervais – his nervous energy, his digressive speed of thought, a suggestion of temper – that meant I didn't want to rile him. But somehow, perhaps because I didn't want to begin with The Invention of Lying, we do start talking about The Office. And do you know what? He would quite clearly talk about it all day, examine it from every angle, analyse it on a scene-by-scene basis. He adores it, considers it great art, knows it secures him televisual immortality.\n\n\"I enjoyed every moment of it,\" he says. \"I enjoyed the result and I enjoyed the pride. I also realised in retrospect that I didn't enjoy all those things because of how good I thought it had turned out. I enjoyed it because of how hard it was.\" The Office, Gervais explains, was the first thing he had ever really worked at. A clever working-class kid from Reading, up to the age of 40 he had always relied on a quick brain and a ready wit to see him through. Life was a breeze, a laugh, a joke. \"I suppose I was always creative. I did start 20 novels, and then went, 'Ah, too hard,' and went to the bar.\" With The Office, which he devised with his co-writer Stephen Merchant, he didn't go to the bar. They spent years writing it, refining it, honing it, controlling it – their refusal to delegate any detail in its production is legendary.\n\nThat, for Gervais, is what makes The Office a watershed. Not its worldwide success, which opened every door and made him impossibly rich. It is about to be remade for India and his eyes light up at the prospect of another billion potential viewers – \"I'm going to take executive producer on that one!\" he says with his maniacal laugh. But the money came later, and he says the first cheque for The Office \"sort of ruined it a bit . . . but I got over it\" (cue another laugh). What was really important was the joy of work – not just dashing something off but getting every detail of David Brent and Wernham Hogg (\"Where life is stationery\") right, a fully realised world.\n\nGervais started our meeting by saying, \"I think you should know something about me first. I never tried hard at anything. I was born smart on a very working-class estate. A couple of people I knew went to university apart from me, but all the way through I was the smartest kid in the school. That's luck, but I was proud of it. And I was also proud of doing well without trying. As you get older, and it took me a long time to realise it, that's a disgusting attitude, revolting. It's ignorant and it's a tragic waste, and I realised that the work itself is the reward. The struggle itself is the reward.\" Everything else – fame, money, being best mates with Jonathan Ross – is secondary.\n\nIt's hard to separate what Gervais calls this \"born-again\" moment from his working relationship with Merchant, which began on radio station Xfm, where Gervais had somehow wangled himself the job of head of speech, in 1997. \"I'd found this person who was just like me,\" says Gervais, \"and where he wasn't like me he filled the gaps. We built it on respect. We have a rule: one veto and it's out, so the things we were left with we both loved.\"\n\nIt would be interesting to know what the gaps were that Merchant filled, and Gervais does start to tell me, but he either loses his train of thought or, more likely, doesn't want to be seen to be speaking for his writing partner. He starts to say that he was the \"punk\" who wanted to \"push the boundaries of comedy and aggravate\", whereas Merchant was the moderating influence, but that the roles have now to some extent been reversed. It's an interesting point, not properly developed because of Gervais's respect for his writing partner. I would guess that Merchant brought discipline to Gervais's comic energy, and it may be that the absence of Merchant from The Invention of Lying explains its scattergun feel: a great premise – a world in which no one can lie – and lots of ideas, but incoherent, throwaway.\n\nGervais says he absolutely stands by the film – his Hollywood directorial debut – but is aware of some of these problems. \"It was a very hard dive. We probably took on too much, if I'm being honest, but I think we got away with it. We had the high-concept thing we had to show the world [the appalling world in which no one lies]. We had to investigate all those things. We had the plot. We had all these characters. We had all these fun cameos [a host of American comedians appear]. We had the romantic thing [tubby, middle-aged bloke lusts after sleek, beautiful, unobtainable girl]. Then we had all those other things that I wanted to get off my chest.\" By \"those other things\", Gervais means God, whom he is not keen on. Gervais's character, a loser called Mark Bellison, tells his dying mother she is going to heaven, and in so doing discovers the power of lying and becomes a messiah.\n\nUnlike The Office and Extras, this is not a fully realised world. Gervais is aware of that. \"I don't think you can talk about Mark Bellison in the same way that you can talk about David Brent,\" he admits. \"I don't think he's as socially interesting because he's not as three-dimensional. It doesn't resonate as much. It's more about the plot and the idea.\" He says this is inevitable with movies. \"With a film and the trajectory over an hour and a half, the plot is more important than character. In TV and something episodic like a sitcom, you can get away with just having great characters. You don't really need plot. With a film you need more plot.\"\n\nI'm nervous about getting on Gervais's wrong side as we talk, because he can be combative. When Private Eye editor Ian Hislop attacked Gervais's stand-up show Animals on Newsnight Review in 2003, Gervais thereafter closed each gig by calling Hislop an \"ugly little pug-faced cunt\". He has had a go at other journalists who have said he was on the slide, and when we meet he is obsessing about an Independent journalist who has attacked one of his jokes and, in the course of attacking it, got the punchline wrong. Gervais recounts all this on his blog, which – he makes a point of telling me – gets 300,000 hits a day, \"which is more than most daily newspapers\". The maths may be dodgy, but his general point is a sound one: his blog, website and podcasts give him direct access to his audience and a forum in which to take on his critics. But why bother? Isn't it demeaning and unnecessary? He's a thousand times more popular, powerful and successful than they will ever be.\n\n\"I don't do it for people who have slagged me off or don't like my work,\" he insists. \"I don't care whether people say, 'The Office is rubbish, Extras is worse, Flanimals is a waste of time, he's not funny, he never has been, I hate him.' I don't mind that at all. In fact, not only do I expect it, I celebrate it, because I think the haters are really important. I do it for people who I feel have wronged me. If they misquote me, I think I'm totally justified in saying, 'I didn't say that.' Your reputation is still the most important thing that you've got.\"\n\nIn a way, Gervais knows it's ridiculous, but he can't help it. He has a natural combativeness, but maybe something more – an anger that feeds his comedy and drives him to work impossibly hard. When I ask him whether he is like the character he plays in The Invention of Lying, he says: \"I'm not really. I'm a lot angrier than him. I don't take my lot. I don't go, 'Oh [big sigh], this isn't fair.' Fairness is important to me, injustice. I'm not talking about fascism. I'm talking about, 'You can't say that,' socially.\" Common decency, in other words. He expects people to behave well, to care about the lives they are leading, the way they conduct themselves. He will not tolerate intolerance. Go back to the language he used about his earlier, lazier self, his willingness to accept second best: \"a disgusting attitude, revolting, ignorant, a tragic waste\". There would be other, less visceral ways of expressing his disappointment at drifting through his 20s and 30s. He is extremely hard on himself, and on others, on our stupidities and self-deceptions.\n\nWhere does the anger come from? It is tempting to trace it back to his childhood, growing up on a Reading council estate in the dispossessed 70s, the accidental (so he has said) youngest child of four, born long after his three siblings to ageing parents. But the solution may be too pat. The household was warm and loving, and he tells me a touching story about his mother. \"When I was 18, I told her I was going to Paris,\" he recalls. \"'Why do you want to go there?' she said. 'There are parts of Reading you haven't seen yet.'\" He laughs at the memory, and says the line will find its way into Cemetery Junction, the autobiographical film he is writing with Merchant and which will be released next year. This, you feel, will be a fully realised world, because it's his own.\n\nHis childlessness intrigues me. He and his partner Jane Fallon, a BBC producer whom he met when they were at London University, have said they consciously put their careers first. He produces children's books but not children, by no means the first writer to make that choice. An explanation he gave recently for this decision made me laugh: \"You make a choice. Pros and cons, really. They give you nothing back, children. Spongers. I said we could adopt, but I wanted to adopt a 30-year-old lawyer who's already paying rent.\" A good joke, disguising what?\n\nIt may be pertinent that the two issues he feels most passionate about – animal rights and the troublesome myth of God (\"The Man in the Sky\", as He is called in The Invention of Lying) – in a way are not about people. Others, including his collaborator Karl Pilkington, have noted this: there's an element of misanthropy in Gervais; he can attack fat people with abandon in his comedy because he really does think fat people have a problem. He originally went to university to study biology – but changed to philosophy after a fortnight because the science was too hard – and there remains in him something of the anatomist, dissecting the way we behave, the signals we send out.\n\nI tell him the first time I saw The Office was on a plane, with no headphones. I was instantly seduced by a scene at Chasers nightclub, keen to don the headphones and find out who these odd people were. This fascinates and pleases him, because he says the body language, the way in which people relate non-verbally, is crucial, especially in a confined space such as an office, or indeed a nightclub. Like many good comedians, he is a brilliant observer and deconstructor of what we say and do, and what we really mean. You can see why he was attracted by The Invention of Lying: here is a world in which people say precisely what they mean, tell the truth unvarnished – \"I won't sleep with you because you are fat and ugly and your breath smells\"; \"I'm ending our relationship because I've got a new boyfriend whose penis is bigger than yours\" – and it's unbearable. We lie to make it possible to get through the day.\n\nGervais is nice, really pleasant, throws himself into the conversation, says he enjoys it, refrains from eating the banana the publicist has brought him to keep his energy levels up, apologises when he has to break off to go to the loo. But I'm not convinced this is the truth: there's a demon there, driving the work, insisting on control, putting career before children, lambasting critics, loathing our hankering after the Man in the Sky. He wants to kill God and remake the world. But first he wants to get rid of me and eat his banana.\n\nThe Invention of Lying is released on 2 October"
