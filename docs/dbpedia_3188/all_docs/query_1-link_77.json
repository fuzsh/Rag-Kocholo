        "text": "We have arrived at the busiest time of the school year. There has been a lot going on, and the busy pace won't be stopping anytime soon!\n\nThe students did such a beautiful job at their 3rd grade concert. The chorus students will be performing again at their concert on May 31st.\n\nThe students have finished up their Smarter Balanced Testing. They worked very hard and showed determination. I'm so proud of them.\n\nThird graders have been on three field trips during the months of April and May. When we went to the Lebanon Green, students were able to visit and learn about 5 different historical buildings, and they participated in hands-on experiences at the Lebanon Historical Society. We are so grateful to all the volunteers who take the time to create such valuable learning opportunities.\n\nOn May 18th, we spent some time at the high school where we viewed the artwork created by Lyman students. After the art show, we even had a few minutes to visit the animals.\n\nOur third and most recent field trip was to Old Sturbridge Village. Most students said that they liked watching the blacksmith and the potter best. The animals were also a big hit.\n\nThis week students are taking the iReady Diagnostic. One thing I like about iReady is that the students get short, periodic breaks. Cat Stacker is particularly amusing. Think of it as Tetris with cats.😊🐈\n\nIn addition to all the out-of-the-ordinary things we've been doing, we continue to move along with curriculum. Since my last post, we've completed the following math units:\n\nDivision and Multiplication\n\nSolving one and two-step problems using all four operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division)\n\nArea\n\nScaled Graphs (bar graphs, picture graphs)\n\nFractions (fraction models, fractions on number lines, equivalent fractions, comparing fractions, fractions greater than one whole)\n\nMeasuring Lengths and Creating Line Plots\n\nGeometry (classifying quadrilaterals, reasoning with shapes and their attributes)\n\nWe are almost finished with our unit on the area and perimeter of shapes and will take our quiz this week. Upcoming lessons include partitioning shapes and time. We will be working on math concepts right up until the end of the school year.\n\nIn reading, we have completed units on main idea, point of view, central message (theme), and figurative language. We will focus next on how text and illustrations work together to tell a story.\n\nDuring our writing block, students have completed personal narrative stories. These are stories that tell a \"memory with a twist\". Students base their story on a small moment in their lives, but they may embellish or add extra details that are fictional. Students learned several techniques for writing narrative stories and applied them to their personal narratives.\n\nAfter our narrative writing unit students chose topics to research. They then used Google Presentation (Google Slides) to create their own Question and Answer Books about their topics. Each child shared his/her book orally with the class. Here are just a few pages from their completed books.\n\nImportant Upcoming Dates\n\nMay 22-May 26, 2023 -- Scholastic Book Fair, BUY ONE, GET ONE FREE SALE!\n\nMay 22-May 25, 2023 -- iReady Diagnostic Testing 11:30-12:30\n\nMay 26, 2023 -- BEACH DAY (dress in shorts and other \"beachy\" clothing & bring a beach towel if desired)\n\nMay 26, 2023 -- EARLY RELEASE DAY\n\nMay 29, 2023 -- NO SCHOOL - MEMORIAL DAY\n\nMay 30, 2023 -- Colonial Day\n\nMay 31, 2023 -- Chorus Concert\n\nJune 1, 2023 -- SBAC is Over Celebration Picnic\n\nJune 2, 2023 -- Field Day\n\nJune 7, 2023 -- BMX Assembly\n\nJune 12-13, 2023 -- EARLY RELEASE DAYS\n\nJune 13, 2023 -- LAST DAY OF SCHOOL!\n\nMy November news is MOSTLY about October. We've been very busy!\n\nBat Week\n\nDuring the week of October 24-October 28, we spent our reading blocks reading fictional and informational bat books. Our bat theme carried over into morning meeting, word study time, and WIN (What I Need) Time.\n\nFall Party\n\nThe kids had fun during our fall party. Thank you to all of you who sent in snacks, drinks, and paper goods. The kids had the chance to create something out of their play doh. Leaf rubbing was another popular activity.\n\nMath\n\nYour children have been learning all about multiplication. They've learned to think of multiplication as equal groups. They have learned to make arrays with equal rows. Our new math curriculum, iReady Mathematics, embeds word problems into every single lesson. The children are all getting more confident with tackling problem-solving tasks. They're also doing a great job explaining their thinking while using mathematical vocabulary. Most recently, students have learned to split harder facts up into two smaller but equal equations. We will continue to work on this. At home, please have your child practice math facts. I always send home a math facts sheet for homework, but flashcards are great too. Fluency with math facts is enormously helpful.\n\nWe will be working on multiplication in November as well. Soon, students will be introduced to the concept of division. We'll explore how multiplication and division are related.\n\nReading\n\nDuring October we focused on characters in fiction. The main teaching points were as follows:\n\nCharacters (like real people) have character traits (personality traits).\n\nReaders can tell the difference between character traits and emotions.\n\nCharacter traits can be positive, negative, or neutral.\n\nReaders think about characters' words, thoughts, and actions and use details from the text to make inferences about character traits.\n\nCharacters' actions contribute to the story and move the story along.\n\nCharacters often change over time.\n\nCharacters often learn LIFE LESSONS in stories, and these life lessons can help us in our lives as well.\n\nIn addition, we spent a little time reading about real people. We discussed the character traits of these people.\n\n​Our current reading unit will focus on text features in nonfiction texts. We will also learn and practice figuring out the meaning of new vocabulary words using word parts and context clues.\n\nWriting\n\nWe have wrapped up our paragraph writing unit by writing a two-paragraph letter to an imaginary farmer. You should have seen your child's final copy come home.\n\n​The children wrote from the point of view of a pumpkin. Their letters needed to persuade the farmer that he/she should NOT choose them to become jack o' lanterns. Their first paragraphs gave reasons why they should not be chosen. Their second paragraphs were written to persuade the farmer to choose a DIFFERENT pumpkin instead.\n\nOur next writing unit will be a personal narrative. Students will brainstorm small moments in their lives that they could turn into a story. We'll be learning and applying several different techniques as we write our stories.\n\nScience\n\nWe took our weather test. Prior to that students engaged in an activity that required them to make a model of a house then simulate strong winds with a paper \"windmaker\" (paper fan). Students observed what happened when the \"strong winds\" blew on their houses. Then they were given some materials to make the houses stronger.\n\nOur next content area unit will be a social studies unit about Native Americans in the past and present. We will learn about some Connecticut tribes as well as other Eastern Woodland groups.\n\nSocial Emotional & Classroom Community Building\n\nMorning Meeting is still our favorite way to start the day. Here are some examples of some recent morning meeting slides.\n\nSome Important Upcoming Dates\n\nMonday, November 14, 2022 - World Diabetes Day, Wear BLUE\n\nFriday, November 18, 2022 - CRAZY HAIR DAY!\n\nWednesday, November 23, 2022 - EARLY DISMISSAL\n\nThurs. & Friday, November 24-25, 2022 - THANKSGIVING BREAK, NO SCHOOL\n\nFriday, December 9, 2022 - Report cards go home.\n\nFriday, December 9, 2022 - PJ Day to raise money for Connecticut Children's Hospital\n\nThank you for stopping by!\n\nWelcome to October! Our school year is in full swing, and the students have been very busy.\n\nFIRST WEEK OF SCHOOL\n\nWe spent time the first week getting to know one another. In addition, we reviewed behavioral expectations and started learning classroom routines.\n\nWe read Mr. Peabody's Apples, a story about a boy who spreads rumors then has to make it right. Click here if you'd like to hear a read-aloud of the book. After reading students worked together to squeeze ALL of the toothpaste out of a tube. THEN I asked them to use toothpicks and put ALL the toothpaste back into the tube. We realized quickly that it was impossible. We made connections between the toothpaste activity and the book. What we discussed as a class was that it is not entirely possible to take back words we've said, so we need to be careful how we speak to each other.\n\nMATH\n\nAt the very beginning of the year, we reviewed place value in math. A favorite activity during our first week of school was building towers out of hundreds, tens, and ones blocks. Students worked with partners to build their towers. Then they figured out the value of their blocks by adding the hundreds, tens, and ones.\n\nStarting the second week of school, we've used our brand-new math curriculum: iReady. Each day the students have a lesson that requires them to TRY a problem, DISCUSS their strategies and thinking with classmates, then CONNECT & APPLY what they've learned to different types of problems.\n\nMany story problems are embedded into our daily lessons. Students have been learning to do THREE READS of every problem.\n\nOn our FIRST read, we get the GIST of the problem. We think about what the problem is mostly about.\n\nOn our SECOND read, we pinpoint exactly what the problem is asking us to solve.\n\nOn our THIRD read, we find the information needed to solve the problem.\n\nStudents have learned to round numbers to the nearest ten and the nearest hundred. They've also been working on adding and subtracting with regrouping using the traditional algorithm as well as various place value strategies.\n\nWe just took our unit one test. We start to learn about multiplication next. ​\n\nREADING\n\nWe started the year by learning about the strategies readers use to THINK about the text they are reading. Readers make connections, visualize using text details, wonder and ask questions, and make inferences about the text.\n\nStudents have taken time to fill their book bins with just right books. Our class expectation is that we will read A LOT in third grade. We are working to build our reading stamina by reading daily. During independent reading, I move around the room and confer with readers. I will be starting small reading groups soon.\n\nNext up in reading: We will begin to apply our inferencing skills as we learn about characters. We will look at what characters say, do, and think as we enjoy many stories. We will make inferences about the characters' traits and motivations. We will also notice how characters change over time.\n\nWRITING\n\nWe started the year thinking and writing about topics that are important to our 3rd grade community. We read the book What If Everybody Did That then wrote paragraphs related to the text. Some students wrote paragraphs exploring what would happen if everybody wasted school supplies. One student wrote about what would happen if everybody helped the custodians keep the school clean! (I loved the positive focus of that one!)\n\nNext, students wrote descriptive paragraphs about fall. As a class, we brainstormed sensory details for fall. Students then wrote paragraphs that included a topic sentence, at least 4 details, and a closing sentence.\n\nAfter completing drafts, students worked to edit their own work for capitalization, punctuation, and spelling. They have a handy-dandy personal dictionary called a Quickword that they use when editing.\n\nCurrently in writing: As a service project, we are doing a mini-unit on letter writing. The students will apply the skills they learn to write letters to members of the military. These letters will be mailed out in time for the holidays. FYI: No last names or addresses will be shared in these letters.\n\nSCIENCE\n\nHas your child been talking about clouds lately? That is likely because we've been learning about weather in class. We learned about different types of clouds and the weather related to them. We created cloud posters and even made clouds in jars!\n\nDuring this unit, students will also learn more about the water cycle, types of precipitation, climate, and seasonal weather patterns.\n\nNext up in the content areas: Our next content unit will be a social studies unit about Native Americans of Connecticut. We will be doing a stem project as part of that unit. If you'd like to send in any of the following materials, it would be very helpful! Of course, donations are completely optional.\n\nNeeded supplies:\n\nPipe cleaners, preferably brown or black but any color is fine\n\nSmall paper lunch bags\n\nBendable plastic straws\n\nRolls of masking tape\n\nSOCIAL EMOTIONAL & CLASSROOM COMMUNITY BUILDING\n\nWe've read many, many books about kindness and respect since school started. We've also read books about being determined and having a growth mindset, even when something is challenging. Here are a few of the titles we've enjoyed together.\n\nWe start each day with a morning meeting. Here are a couple examples of slides we use to spark our morning conversations. The image below is an example of a how are you feeling slide. I'd ask, \"Which raccoon shows how you are feeling today?\"\n\nThank you for stopping by! I'll be back in early November with another update.\n\nPlease be sure to check your email for important announcements from the school district.\n\nSOME IMPORTANT UPCOMING DATES:\n\nOctober 10, 2022 - No school\n\nOctober 11, 2022 - Fire Prevention Assembly\n\nOctober 17-21, 2022 - PTA Book Fair\n\nOctober 17, 2022 - HOMEWORK FOR GRADE 3 BEGINS\n\nOctober 19, 2022 - Unity Day...Wear orange!\n\nOctober 27, 2022 - STEAM Night at LES! 6-7 p.m. Preregistration required\n\nOctober 31, 2022 - Fall Party... I'll be in touch if you offered to send something in. More information about the day will be shared via an email from the school. Please be on the lookout for that.\n\nNovember 7, 2022 - Picture Retake Day\n\nNovember 7, 2022 - Early Dismissal, parent/teacher conferences\n\nNovember 8, 2022 - No school for students, parent/teacher conferences\n\nAbout conferences: A couple of weeks prior to conferences, I will send home a letter AND an email with a link to Sign Up Genius. That way you can sign up for a conference day and time that works best for you.\n\nIt's hard to believe it's May already and that there are only 30 school days left!\n\nMATH\n\nWe have been busy and productive since my last post. Since my last post, we've completed 4 units. Students learned to round to the nearest ten and the nearest hundred. We completed a unit on addition and subtraction with regrouping, and we used those skills to solve problems.\n\nStudents learned to find the perimeter of a shape. We discussed the difference between area and perimeter. We also completed a geometry unit that focuses primarily on quadrilaterals. The main focus of the unit was to reason with shapes based on their attributes.\n\nMost recently, we completed a unit on fractions. Students learned how to identify and represent fractions using models and number lines. They also worked to compare fractions and find equivalent fractions. They even learned that fractions sometimes equal whole numbers. For example, 12/3 equals 4. 5/1 equals 5. We wrapped up our fraction unit with a pirate-themed set of math challenges. Students worked with teams so they could complete all the challenges and unlock the treasure chest.\n\nCurrently we are working on a graphing unit. We also continue to work on review problems so that students can maintain previously learned concepts.\n\nREADING\n\nWe completed a unit on main idea. We read many nonfiction passages and books and identified main ideas and details. We also read two texts with similar main ideas. Then we compared and contrasted the key points. To keep your child practicing, please have him/her read some nonfiction. (Reading a balance of fiction and nonfiction is always a good idea.)\n\nStudents also worked on figuring out the meaning of new words based on context clues.\n\nMost recently we completed a unit on point of view. We read short stories, picture books, poems, and nonfiction articles. For our unit, we defined point of view as someone's opinion about something. We focused on these main points:\n\nCharacters in stories have points of view.\n\nNarrators of stories have points of view.\n\nAuthors of nonfiction texts have points of view.\n\nREADERS have points of view as well. Sometimes a reader will have a different point of view than the character, narrator, or author.​\n\nStudents continue to read daily and have really built up their reading stamina. Please remember to have your child read daily at home as well.\n\nWRITING\n\nOur Question and Answer Book project tied in nicely with our main idea unit in reading. Students read a variety of texts in order to research a topic of their own choosing. They took notes and crafted Question and Answer Books to communicate what they'd learned. All of the students' books included an introduction page, multiple paragraphs, photographs, a conclusion page, a table of contents, bolded words, and a glossary. Your child can show you his/her book any time since we completed these projects in Google Slides.\n\nCurrently we're working on opinion pieces. For each piece, students were required to include details from at least 2 nonfiction sources to support their opinions. Students have already written opinion paragraphs about recess and school uniforms. At the moment they are planning pieces to share their opinion about BUGS! More specifically, they are planning to share their point of view about CONSUMING bugs. They have some strong opinions! We kicked off our unit with the following video. Enjoy!\n\nSOCIAL STUDIES & SCIENCE\n\nWe just concluded a unit on Animals Through Time. We learned about types of fossils, how fossils are formed, and how fossils teach us about life long ago. We made our own fossils using salt dough. Students also learned about inherited and learned traits and how working in groups can help animals survive.\n\nCurrently we are learning about Lebanon and Connecticut. We kicked off our unit with our field trip to the Lebanon Green. Students had the chance to visit the Lebanon Historical Society and 5 historical sites. The volunteers who make this trip possible are AMAZING and very knowledgeable. We are so grateful for their willingness to share their time and expertise.\n\nUPCOMING DATES\n\nMay 10-18 -- SBAC Testing Please be sure Chromebooks are charged!\n\nMay 20 -- Field Trip to Old Sturbridge Village...Please send in permission slip & payment.\n\nMay 23-27 -- PTA Book Fair\n\nMay 25 @ 6 p.m.-- 3rd Grade Concert\n\nMay 30 -- Memorial Day, no school\n\nJune 7 @ 6 p.m. -- Art Show\n\nJune 8 -- Field Day (rain date June 9)\n\nJune 14 -- Flag Day Ceremony\n\nJune 17 & 20 -- Early Dismissals\n\nJune 20 -- Last day of 3rd grade!\n\nThank you for taking the time to see what we've been doing in class. I appreciate you.\n\nHappy New Year! Hopefully we can look forward to a healthy, happy, and productive January.\n\nDecember was a busy month. The students worked so hard despite several interruptions due to Covid.\n\nMATH\n\nWe've just about finished our unit on area. The students first learned that the area of a shape is the amount of space it covers, and it can be measured by the number of square units that cover it without gaps or overlaps. Students explored this idea by tiling shapes.\n\nNext, the children related the area of rectangles to multiplication. They noticed that rectangles can be tiled with squares in equal-size rows (or columns), so if the rectangle is 6 units by 4 units, there are 6 groups of 4 or 4 groups of 6. The number of square units is then 6×4 or 4×6.\n\nFinally, students learned to use the area formula for rectangles: Area = Length x Width. They used this formula to find the area of rectangles and also irregular shapes that could be split up into rectangles. Below I've shared an example to give you an idea of what we've been working on.\n\nOur next unit in math will be on addition and subtraction with 3-digit numbers. We'll also learn about rounding and estimating.\n\nREADING\n\nWe have continued to work on building our reading stamina daily. We've wrapped up our unit on characters and have been focusing on CENTRAL MESSAGE. Central message is the author's message to the reader. It's a life lesson that goes beyond just the details in the story. Sometimes, in fables, the central message is referred to as the moral of the story. So far, we've read and discussed the central message in holiday stories and realistic fiction. Next, we'll read several fables and folktales. At home, you can support this comprehension concept by discussing the life lessons in books, tv shows, and even songs.\n\nWRITING\n\nThe children finished up their small moment stories. They were very enthusiastic about crafting their narratives. They learned and applied a variety of techniques to make their stories engaging. In addition, they used excellent effort when revising and editing as well. The students were expected to include the following in their stories:\n\nAn entertaining beginning\n\nA detailed description of a setting, character, or object\n\nA s-t-r-e-t-c-h-e-d out main event that incorporated characters' thoughts, feelings, dialogue, and detailed play-by-play action\n\nAn ending that wraps up the story in a satisfying way\n\nNext, we'll be working on an informational writing project.\n\nCONTENT AREA\n\nWe finished up our weather unit and have recently started to learn about Native Americans of the Eastern Woodlands. During our unit we'll be exploring the following questions:\n\nWhat are the histories of the towns, landmarks, and geographical features that are names after indigenous peoples in Connecticut?\n\nHow have indigenous peoples affected the history and culture of Connecticut?\n\nHow are indigenous peoples in Connecticut similar to indigenous peoples in surrounding regions? How are they similar?\n\nOTHER NEWS\n\nWe will be doing our second round of NWEA testing next week. I'll share results once we've completed the assessments.\n\n​Thank you for stopping by! I appreciate you.\n\nHello families! I enjoyed having the opportunity to talk with most of you during parent-teacher conferences. Thank you for taking the time to meet with me.\n\nHere are some highlights from the past couple of months.\n\nMATH\n\nSince the beginning of the year we have worked on multiplication, multiplication, and a little more multiplication! For the past couple of weeks, we've been focusing on how multiplication and division are related (but opposite) operations. Using addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division to solve problems is woven into many lessons.\n\nThank you so much for having your child complete homework each week. Memorizing math facts is one of the best ways to increase your child's fluency in mathematics.\n\nOur next unit will be on finding area. We will use a variety of strategies, but there will be much emphasis on the connection between area and multiplication.\n\nDuring our reading block we've been building reading stamina. Practice is the best way to improve, and ideally 3rd graders should be able to maintain focus and read for at least 30 minutes. We've discussed the importance of choosing books that we LOVE that are at just the right level.\n\nThank you for having your child read each night at home. At least 20 minutes each night is a good goal.\n\nWe spent time focusing on what readers think about as they read. They wonder about what will happen and why characters behave as they do. They ask questions and then read to find the answers to those questions. Readers make inferences using clues from the text.\n\nWe spent a week reading fictional and informational books about bats. We focused on the difference between fiction and nonfiction and also practiced finding details that support specific main ideas.\n\n​Currently we are reading many books that portray strong characters. We are reviewing character traits, character motivation, and how characters can change over time.\n\n​WRITING\n\nWe have completed two short writing projects. Students wrote a descriptive fall paragraph using their five senses to describe. In addition, students wrote a 2-paragraph persuasive letter. The idea was to write from the point of view of a pumpkin. They decided whether or not they wanted to be chosen as a jack o'lantern, then wrote to persuade the farmer to pick them (or not). Through these projects students worked on composing grammatically correct sentences, elaborating using specific details, organizing writing into paragraphs, starting sentences in various ways, and editing for capitals and punctuation.\n\n​Currently we are working on personal narratives. Each student brainstormed a variety of \"small moments\" that could be turned into stories. Then, each student chose a small moment and planned how to add details to turn that moment into a full story. We've been examining wonderful examples by various authors. We study the techniques these authors used so we can learn to use the same techniques in our own writing. Below are images of some of the books we'll be using. Click on each picture to see a video read aloud.\n\nSCIENCE\n\nDuring science, we've been learning about weather. Students learned the different types of clouds and we even made clouds in jars. Students also learned about different climates and severe weather. We'll be wrapping up this unit shortly. Next we'll start a social studies unit about Native Americans in Connecticut.\n\nThank you for stopping by to see what we've been learning! I'll be updating the classroom blog again in December."
