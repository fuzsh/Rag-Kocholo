As we enter a world where the expert, sage on the stage, command and control type leadership seems to be falling further out of favor based on cultural and technological shifts, it is no longer enough for leaders to differentiate themselves with their charisma and expertise. As I've written about in the past, reliance on command and control leadership that glorifies the \"interesting leader\" creates fragile teams. True connection and influence emerge when a leader prioritizes understanding and empathy. When our leader is interested in us, we feel valued for our unique strengths and contributions, increasing our intrinsic motivation. However, this transition from being interesting to being interested as a leader can pose challenges for new leaders. Initially, the allure of showcasing knowledge and capabilities takes precedence. New leaders, grieving the loss of the clarity and confidence they had as individual contributors, often feel compelled to assert their competence and stand out, inadvertently prioritizing their own narrative over others‚Äô. This focus on being interesting stems from a desire to establish authority and credibility, yet it risks alienating team members by neglecting their perspectives. Transitioning to a state of genuine interest demands humility and confidence‚Ä¶something that can be in short supply when you're new to a role. Time spent reflecting on their strengths and values and how they want to show up as a leader can help them gain clarity and confidence that enables them to prioritize relationships over personal prominence. It takes deliberate effort, but the rewards of embracing this transformation are profound. Leaders who prioritize understanding over showcasing become catalysts for collaboration, trust, and collective growth. Their teams feel valued and empowered, fostering an environment where diverse voices flourish, innovation thrives, and lasting impact emerges. Ultimately, the journey from being interesting to being interested defines a leader's capacity to inspire, unite, and drive meaningful change.
