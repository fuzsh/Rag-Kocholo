        "text": "The Impacts of Minimum Wage Increases on the Canadian Economy\n\nThis note reviews the channels through which scheduled minimum wage increases over the coming years may affect Canadian economic activity and inflation and assesses their macroeconomic impacts. From reduced-form estimates of direct minimum wage pass-through, we find that consumer price index (CPI) inflation could be boosted by about 0.1 percentage point (pp) on average in 2018.\n\nAlternative Scenario to the October 2017 MPR Base-Case Projection: Higher Potential Growth\n\nWe construct an alternative scenario in which trend labour input and business investment are stronger than that expected in the Bank of Canadaâ€™s base-case projection in the October 2017 Monetary Policy Report.\n\nSee More\n\nTransition Scenarios for Analyzing Climate-Related Financial Risk\n\nClimate transition scenarios clarify climate-related risks to our economy and financial system. This paper summarizes key results of Canada-relevant scenarios developed in a pilot project on climate risk by the Bank of Canada and the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions.\n\nHow Oil Supply Shocks Affect the Global Economy: Evidence from Local Projections\n\nWe provide empirical evidence on the impact of oil supply shocks on global aggregates. To do this, we first extract structural oil supply shocks from a standard oil-price determination model found in the literature.\n\nThe Role of Financial Speculation in Driving the Price of Crude Oil\n\nOver the past 10 years, financial firms have increased the size of their positions in the oil futures market. At the same time, oil prices have increased dramatically.\n\nExternal Stability, Real Exchange Rate Adjustment and the Exchange Rate Regime in Emerging-Market Economies\n\nIn emerging-market economies, real exchange rate adjustment is critical for maintaining a sustainable current account position and thereby for helping to reduce macroeconomic and financial instability.\n\nThe Outlook for the Global Supply of Oil: Running on Faith?\n\nThe dramatic reduction in global demand, and the decline in the spot price of crude oil in the second half of last year, may have significant implications for the future supply of oil. Investments in conventional methods of extraction have been constrained, since easily accessible oil reserves are typically concentrated in countries with geopolitical uncertainty and/or state-run oil companies.\n\nSee More"
