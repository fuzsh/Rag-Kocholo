        "text": "Ricky Gervais, the British comedian, does not care what you say about him on Twitter. He does not care if you are offended. He does not care if you hate the latest joke he told about rape, or the Bible, or Caitlyn Jenner, or Hitler or your child’s fatal peanut allergy. And just to make sure you’re crystal clear on all of the tweets he does not remotely care about, he has built his new Netflix stand-up special, “Ricky Gervais: Humanity,” around them — these negligible tweets, the droning of gnats, several years of which he appears to have accidentally screen-grabbed and saved to his phone. (Ricky Gervais: Butterfingers!)\n\nSimilarly, I don’t care about Formula One racing, which is why I’m working on a tight 75-minute act about the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.\n\nGervais seems to care quite intensely, of course, which is natural. It would be grotesque, inhuman, not to care. Absorbing critique on a scale as vast as Gervais’s Twitter feed (13.1 million followers), whether the specific critiques are warranted or not, is objectively grueling. Stand-up comedy is vulnerable and hard. Twitter is awful. Devoid of context, Gervais’s bravado might be sympathetic, a relatable if tedious coping mechanism. As Gervais himself helpfully points out in “Humanity,” however, nothing can truly be divorced from context.\n\nSo here’s some context for you: Last week, the secretary of housing and urban development, Ben Carson, testified in front of a House subcommittee that trans women in homeless shelters make cisgender women “not comfortable.” According to a 2016 survey by the National Center for Transgender Equality, 20 percent of trans people report having been homeless at some point because of their gender identity, 55 percent report being harassed by homeless shelter residents and staff, and 29 percent have been turned away from shelters for being trans. Meanwhile, on Netflix, Gervais graphically speculated about Caitlyn Jenner’s gender confirmation surgery, repeatedly referred to her as a big strong man, relentlessly called her by her pre-transition name and compared gender dysphoria to a human choosing to identify as a chimpanzee.\n\nThat is the context within which Gervais insists he doesn’t care about critiques of his work — critiques pointing out that describing trans women as goofy, freaky, delusional men who’ve just “popped on a dress” isn’t edgy or cheeky, it’s dangerous. Giggling at the “weirdness” of trans people — presenting your spasms of discomfort as something relatable — makes it harder for trans people to find a safe place to sleep. Transphobia is not a pet issue of the hypersensitive but a continuing international emergency.\n\nAnd sure, some critiques are silly or bad. Public opinion is a numbers game: Distribute your work to a large enough sample and you’ll accrue people who love you, which is intoxicating, but also people who don’t, which is painful. You’ll find some who get the jokes but hate them anyway and some who hate you without even bothering to watch. This doesn’t actually say much about humanity except that it is vast and varied. Yet, out of this data set, some comedians and their fans seem determined to gerrymander an epidemic of bowdlerization.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
