        "text": "This article is about the audio programme. For its animated television adaptation, see The Ricky Gervais Show (TV series). For the unrelated live-action chat show, see Meet Ricky Gervais.\n\nBritish comedy radio show\n\nThe Ricky Gervais Show is a comedy radio show in the UK starring Ricky Gervais, Stephen Merchant, and Karl Pilkington, later adapted into a podcast and a television series. Although named after Gervais, it mostly revolves around the life and ideas of Karl Pilkington. The show started in August 2001 on Xfm,[1] and aired in weekly periods for months at a time throughout 2002, 2003, 2004 and mid-2005. In November 2005, Guardian Unlimited offered the show as a podcast series of 12 shows. An animated series based on the podcast and adapted for television debuted for HBO in the United States and Channel 4 in the UK in 2010.\n\nIt was one of the most successful shows in the early years of the podcast industry and received a \"most downloaded podcast\" certification from Guinness World Records in 2006.[2] According to the BBC, by September 2006, the podcasts of the series had been downloaded nearly 18 million times.[3] As of March 2011 , the podcast has been downloaded over 300 million times.[4] A cult following for the Xfm radio shows and podcasts has ensued in the following years, starting since their original airings and maintaining a strong amount of fans, the most popular forum used to discuss the show being the subreddit \"r/rickygervais\" on the popular news and media platform Reddit, with roughly 150,000 members as of November 2023.\n\nRadio shows\n\n[edit]\n\nRadio show\n\nThe Ricky Gervais ShowRunning time2 hoursCountry of originUnited KingdomLanguage(s)EnglishHome stationXfmHosted byOriginal releaseJanuary 1998 ( ) –\n\n2 July 2005 (2005-07-02)\n\nEarly shows\n\n[edit]\n\nGervais and Merchant first worked together in radio on the London-based alternative radio station Xfm London. Their show was broadcast from January to August 1998 from 4–6pm on Sundays, and only featured Gervais and Merchant (before their collaboration on The Office). The show's original format was more interactive, with features, guests, phone-ins, and audience interaction through listeners' letters.[5]\n\nReturn to XFM\n\n[edit]\n\nGervais and Merchant returned to Xfm in August 2001, after the first series of The Office had been broadcast, with Pilkington brought in as producer.[6] The show was originally just billed as Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant, and Pilkington's presence was not acknowledged on posters or other advertisements. Gervais and Merchant would speak to Pilkington about his thoughts on whatever they were talking about. In 2003, Pilkington was added to advertisements for the show as he took on a more prominent role in the show. The last show for XFM aired on 2 July 2005, after which they chose to switch the show's format from radio to podcasting.\n\nSeries 1\n\n[edit]\n\nThe show ran between September 2001 and May 2002 before Gervais and Merchant went on hiatus to film the second series of The Office. Initially, Pilkington's on-air presence was relatively minimal. Gervais and Merchant only occasionally called for him to weigh in with his thoughts, while the two mostly talked to each other, with the links between songs comprising only about 30 minutes of the show's 2-hour run time.\n\nAs Pilkington's personality moved to the forefront, the talk portion of the show expanded to roughly an hour per 2-hour broadcast. While the show relied largely upon a stream-of-consciousness format, Pilkington made attempts to keep things more conventional by insisting on running contests and airing pre-recorded segments and regular \"features\".[citation needed]\n\nSeries 2\n\n[edit]\n\nWith the second series of The Office complete, Gervais, Merchant, and Pilkington returned to XFM in August of 2002 to resume their 2-hour Saturday afternoon broadcasts. Though Pilkington's name was still not being used in promotional materials, the format mainly centered on his contributions with Gervais and Merchant reacting to his comments, a format that would endure through the remainder of the radio broadcasts and podcasts, concluding in 2012.\n\nThis was the longest stretch of XFM shows, running 51 weeks until August 2003 when Gervais and Merchant again went on hiatus, this time to record the final episode of The Office.\n\nDuring the year, Gervais and Merchant began saying on-air that Pilkington had become the star of the show and theorized that most listeners were tuning in to hear his anecdotes and perspectives. Pilkington, however, grew increasingly frustrated with Gervais's antagonism towards him, and over the final few shows, suggested that he did not wish to continue. Gervais and Merchant insisted they would not return if Pilkington did not agree to remain with the show.\n\nSeries 3\n\n[edit]\n\nDuring the hiatus, Pilkington signed on with Gervais and Merchant's talent agent, and negotiated a deal with XFM to get Mondays off in exchange for continuing to do The Ricky Gervais Show on Saturdays. This was a frequent topic of contention during this run with Gervais repeatedly accusing Pilkington of being lazy for demanding an entire day off in exchange for producing the 2-hour Saturday afternoon broadcast.\n\nThe show began airing again in November 2003 and broadcast for 12 weeks until January 2004 when Gervais and Merchant went on hiatus to film series 1 of their new show, Extras.\n\nSeries 4\n\n[edit]\n\nGervais, Merchant, and Pilkington returned to XFM following the completion of Extras series 1. This time, they recorded only 6 shows before Gervais and Merchant left XFM for good. The show would later continue as a podcast, with no further association with XFM.\n\nRadio 2 Holiday Shows\n\n[edit]\n\nGervais, Merchant and Pilkington broadcast two hour-long holiday specials on Radio 2 during the 2005 holiday season, the first airing on Christmas Eve and the second on New Year's Eve.[7]\n\nNME Radio show\n\n[edit]\n\nGervais, Merchant and Pilkington recorded a two-hour radio show as part of the test transmissions for the new radio station NME Radio. The episode aired on Monday 9 June 2008, 12pm (BST).[8]\n\nPodcasts and audiobooks\n\n[edit]\n\nPodcast\n\nThe Ricky Gervais ShowPresentationHosted byGenreComedyCreated by\n\nRicky Gervais\n\nStephen Merchant\n\nKarl Pilkington\n\nLanguageEnglishUpdatesEndedPublicationOriginal release5 December 2005 ( ) –\n\n6 March 2011 (2011-03-06)Ratings3.6/5\n\nCreation\n\n[edit]\n\nAccording to Emily Bell, editor-in-chief of Guardian Unlimited, Gervais and Merchant had approached the Guardian with the idea of the show.[9] Bell said that they had switched to a podcast format for greater control over content and access to a larger audience. The first 12 episodes were released free of charge through the Guardian Unlimited website.\n\nSeries one\n\n[edit]\n\nThe first series of podcasts began on 5 December 2005, and a new episode was released each Monday for the next twelve weeks. The show relies heavily on the wit and bizarre theories of Pilkington, who was then unemployed, having left his job as radio producer at XFM. The podcast focuses more on Pilkington as a primary figure of humour in the show in various ways, including questions directed at him that have been emailed in, either by fans of the show or by Gervais and Merchant themselves.[10]\n\nSeries two\n\n[edit]\n\nSeries two of the podcast began on 28 February 2006. It consisted of six episodes with the final one released on 4 April 2006. The series saw the return of Karl's Diary and Rockbusters.\n\nWith the start of series two, the formerly free Ricky Gervais Show shifted to a pay model. As a result, the show is now classified as an audiobook.[citation needed] It is available through Audible and the iTunes Store with individual episodes. The reason for this addition, according to Ricky on the podcast, is because The Guardian agreed to pay for the bandwidth for 12 episodes, and any further episodes would have to be paid for out of their personal finances.[11]\n\nSeries three\n\n[edit]\n\nSeries three of the podcasts was released on 22 August 2006. This season saw the return of Karl's Diary as well as a new feature based on Pilkington's attempts at Poetry. All other features were abandoned, with the rest of each episode focusing instead on conversation. The season had the same pricing implementation as season two, although the file quality was increased.[citation needed]\n\nAt the end of the sixth episode, Gervais and Merchant agreed to put the show on an indefinite hiatus.\n\nSeries four: The Podfather Trilogy\n\n[edit]\n\nThree free podcasts were announced. The first was released on 31 October 2006, to coincide with Halloween, the next was on 23 November, coinciding with Thanksgiving, and the last was released on 24 December 2006, to coincide with Christmas.[12]\n\nFame special\n\n[edit]\n\nA special podcast was made available as a giveaway to people who went to see Gervais' stand-up tour Fame, which played from January to April 2007. It was later released for free to the public in October of that year.\n\nHour-Long Bonus Podcast\n\n[edit]\n\nOn 25 November 2007, Gervais, Merchant and Pilkington released a free podcast. Originally released as an extra on the audio CD release of series one, it was later made available free through iTunes.[citation needed]\n\nSeries five\n\n[edit]\n\nFour more episodes were released on 15 September 2008 through the iTunes Store. This series was released all at once as an Audiobook, almost two hours in length and split into four half-hour episodes. All episodes were recorded at the same time. There are no contests or any interaction from the listeners as the previous series contained.[13]\n\nThe Ricky Gervais Guide to...\n\n[edit]\n\nSeries one\n\n[edit]\n\nA new series, called The Ricky Gervais Guide to... featured the trio discussing various topics in their entirety during 50 min episodes. The first volume The Ricky Gervais Guide to... Medicine was released on 31 December 2008. This was followed by The Ricky Gervais Guide to... Natural History on 21 January 2009. This in turn was followed by The Ricky Gervais Guide to... The Arts on 18 February 2009. The 4th episode, The Ricky Gervais Guide to... Philosophy aired on 17 March while the 5th and final episode of season 1, The Ricky Gervais Guide to... The English followed on 21 April (2 days prior to St. George's Day).[14]\n\nSeries two\n\n[edit]\n\nThe first episode of the new series, The Ricky Gervais Guide to... Society, was recorded on 6 September 2009, and released on 3 November 2009. The second audiobook of the new series, The Ricky Gervais Guide to... Law and Order, was released on 1 December 2009. A third audiobook, entitled The Ricky Gervais Guide to... The Future, was released on 29 December 2009. A fourth audiobook, entitled The Ricky Gervais Guide to... The Human Body was released on 26 January 2010. The fifth and final audiobook of the second season, entitled The Ricky Gervais Guide to... The Earth was released on 23 February 2010.[15]\n\nOn 12 June 2010 The Ricky Gervais Guide to... The World Cup released.[16] This was followed later that year by a podcast entitled \"A day in the Life of Karl Pilkington\" following a format more associated with the Ricky Gervais Show podcasts.[17]\n\nThe Ricky Gervais Guide to... Comic Relief was released as a free podcast on 6 March 2011 in aid of Red Nose Day (18 March 2011).[18]\n\nA Day in the Life of Karl\n\n[edit]\n\nA special one-off podcast titled A Day in the Life of Karl was released on 28 October 2010.\n\nVideo podcasts\n\n[edit]\n\nOn 24 March 2006, an \"irregular run of free video podcasts\" was launched through the iTunes podcast directory. The video podcasts do not follow the format of the earlier audio shows and the content varies greatly from podcast to podcast. The first video was a conversation between Pilkington and Gervais, with Gervais enthusing about the idea of Pilkington becoming a human crab or having massive reconstructive surgery. The second podcast served as an advertisement for Pilkington and Gervais's new book, The World of Karl Pilkington (a series of excerpts from the previous podcasts and various musings and drawings produced by Karl). The third on the series was an audio clip from a previous edition of Monkey News, synchronised with a flash animation. The fourth video podcast features a controversial audio advertisement for The Prostate Cancer Charity and Gervais talking about his Aerial Award. The fifth is Gervais and Merchant making Pilkington watch Brokeback Mountain. The sixth podcast was another conversation over Pilkington's book The World of Karl Pilkington. The seventh podcast was about a story Pilkington told in series one, episode one, about his bizarre journey in an abandoned asylum and rehabilitation clinic. The eighth video shows Gervais showing the viewer around the various sets during the filming of the second series of Extras, followed by Pilkington giving his opinion on Gervais's latest book, Flanimals of the Deep. The ninth was Pilkington talking about Gervais's cat; Ollie. The tenth was Gervais, Merchant and Pilkington announcing the new series of the show beginning on 22 August.\n\nIn August 2012, Gervais produced a pilot for a new series of video podcasts, titled Learn English with Ricky Gervais.[19] The show features Gervais and Pilkington engaging in English dialogue, and translated captions have been provided in many languages by his fans.[20]\n\nTV series\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Ricky Gervais Show audiobooks have been developed into The Ricky Gervais Show, an animated series which premiered on 19 February 2010, on the American channel HBO[21] and on the British channel Channel 4 on 23 April 2010.[22]\n\nThe show consists of past audiobooks with animation, drawn in a style similar to classic era Hanna-Barbera cartoons, describing jokes in a literal context. Series one, two and three are available on DVD and streaming services.[23]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
