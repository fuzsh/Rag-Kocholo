In a previous publication, \"The Story of a Century\", he had recorded the main lines of growth of the Restoration Movement in the State from 1846 to 1946. The present purpose is to add a brief history of each local congregation so far as data can be obtained, biographical sketches of representative men of the churches and contributions of churchmen in public affairs, chiefly on social questions as they were debated in the legislative chambers.

McLelland and his staff, whose help has been invaluable. Other acknowledgements appear with historical references.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nChurches of Christ in South Australia form a small part of a great religious movement which began in the early years of the nineteenth century, and which numbers today over two millions of people. Its main strength is found in the United States of America, but it is also represented in Great Britain, Ireland, Canada, South Africa, New Zealand, and Australia, and less known in other parts of the world. This reformation lays claim to be a \"movement\"--a movement back to New Testament principles, which has characterised religious reformations throughout the Christian era, and a movement forward, guided by the Spirit of God, towards the ultimate union of all who call themselves Christians.\n\nHaving no credal statement as such, Churches of Christ are built on the fundamental, basic truth expressed in the words of the Apostle Peter, \"Thou art the Christ the Son of the Living God\", in reply to his Master's question, \"Who say ye that I am?\" Acceptance of Jesus Christ as Lord and personal Saviour, open confession of this faith, repentance, and submission to the ordinance of immersion into the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, are all that are required of a person seeking salvation and admission to the church.\n\nThe church accepts the New Testament doctrine of the priesthood of all believers, convinced that any Christian has a direct, vital relationship with the Father through the Lord Jesus Christ, the Great High Priest, and that any Christian may fulfil whatever priestly functions have a place in the New Testament church. Patterned on the organisation of this church, Churches of Christ appoint evangelists, pastors or elders and deacons. Every congregation controls its own affairs. General conferences are held annually for the purpose of free discussion by delegates from the churches on matters of common interest pertaining to the kingdom of God and of making recommendations to the constitutive churches for co-operative activities.\n\nFrom the New Testament it is gathered that the early Christians met on the first day of the week to \"break bread\". This practice is supported by church history and tradition. The sacred ordinance has the central place in the worship of the church on the Lord's Day, commemorates and proclaims the death of Jesus Christ, and points forward to his triumphal second coming.\n\nChurches of Christ claim that mere human opinions have no authority over the conscience of those who seek to follow Christ and are of too little importance in themselves to divide the Christian church. In his \"Declaration and Address\" Thomas Campbell, one of the founders of the Restoration Movement, wrote: \"It rejects human opinions and the inventions of men, as of any authority, or as having any place in the Church of God, that the Church might forever cease from further contentions about such things, returning to, and holding fast by, the original standard, taking the Divine word alone for its rule, the Holy Spirit for its teacher and guide to lead into all truth; and Christ alone as exhibited in the Word for salvation.\"\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nForeword\n\nIntroduction\n\nPART ONE - General History\n\nChapter I. - The Beginning of the Movement\n\nII. - The Franklin Street Church Re-Organised\n\nIII. - American Evangelists\n\nIV. - The Pioneer Spirit\n\nV. - Co-operative Evangelism\n\nVI. - Rapid Progress in Evangelism\n\nVII. - The Church Faces Difficult Conditions\n\nVIII. - Recent Evangelistic Activities\n\nIX. - Training Evangelists in South Australia\n\nX. - The Evangelistic Union Established\n\nXI. - Instrumental Music in, the Churches\n\nXII. - Anniversary Teas and Public Meetings\n\nXIII. - Other Union Concerns\n\nXIV. - Preachers Vindicated\n\nXV. - \"Arise and Build!\"\n\nXVI. - Overseas Missions\n\nXVII. - Winning Youth for Christ\n\nXVIII. - Christian Endeavour Societies\n\nXIX. - Social Services\n\nXX. - Christian Rest Home\n\nXXI. - Aborigines Missions\n\nXXII. - Women's Work\n\nPART TWO - A Brief Account of the Churches\n\nChapter I. - The City Churches\n\nII. - The Suburban Churches\n\nIII. - The Rural Churches\n\nIV. - The Barrier Church\n\nV. - Defunct Churches\n\nPART THREE - Biographical Sketches of Representative Men\n\nPART FOUR - Churchmen in Public Affairs\n\nPART FIVE - Present Trends\n\nIndex\n\nPART ONE\n\nGENERAL HISTORY\n\nI\n\nThe Beginning of the Movement\n\nIN the spring of 1845 a young man, Thomas Magarey landed at McLaren's Wharf, Port Adelaide, from Nelson, New Zealand, to settle in South Australia. Seeds of the Restoration Movement in Australia were first sown by this godly Irish business man. He was born on February 25, 1825, in the north of Ireland, but spent most of his youth in the English county of Lancashire. With his elder brother he migrated to New Zealand in 1841, settling in the Nelson district. Here he came under the influence of the teaching of Thomas Jackson, who arrived in the village of Nelson in 1843, bringing with him a knowledge of the principles which were slowly being accepted in various parts of the old country. Thomas Jackson was of the stuff of which religious reformers are made. Writing to the editor of a British periodical, \"The Christian Messenger\", in August, 1844, he said: \"When I arrived there was not one Christian Disciple to be found in this part of the island, and I am much persecuted for assuming such a name. It is with great pleasure that I have to impart the gratifying intelligence that I have tried to plant in this small place a congregation according to the apostolic order. On March 2, 1844, I preached the same gospel that Peter did at Jerusalem on the Day of Pentecost. I have baptized the house of Thomas Butler, and this makes us five in number.\"\n\nAnother letter, dated January 4, 1846, from the three elders of the infant church, including Thomas Jackson, informed the British brethren that the number of disciples in Nelson had increased to sixteen. The letter continues: \"This does not include one brother who left some time ago for South Australia, who, we hope, may be useful in promoting the truth as it is in Jesus.\" Thus Thomas Magarey was linked with the cause in our sister dominion over a century ago.\n\nThe minds of the colonists in the land where Thomas\n\n- 2 -\n\nMagarey chose to make his permanent home were open to new religious ideas. There was a love of independence and a desire for freedom of thought untrammelled by custom and State interference. The wide open spaces of virgin land may also have had something to do with the development of this freedom of the spirit. Shiploads of German settlers, seeking religious liberty, had arrived within the first few years of the colony's history. One group was established near the city, creating the village of Klemzig, named after the German town from which Pastor Kavel had led his flock to the land where freedom of conscience was promised. Another German group settled in the Mount Lofty ranges at Hahndorf, to which Captain Hahn, of the ship which brought them out, gave his name. These migrations were due to attempts on the part of the Prussian government to force on the Lutherans forms of worship of which many of them disapproved. George Fife Angas, the \"father\" of South Australia, himself a lover of freedom and a Baptist, promoted the movement and settlement of these splendid people. Religious freedom in the colony was endangered by the persistent efforts of early governors, notably Governor Robe, who took over from Governor Grey in 1846, to give State aid for religion. He said: \"Apportioning of Government aid among the different sects is a matter of some difficulty, but it is not, I trust, insurmountable.\" Petition and counter petition were submitted to him. He remained obdurate. A league was formed for the \"maintenance of religious liberty in the province\", the members asserting that Government aid corrupted religion, made it formal, and interfered with the right of conscience, for no individual should be compelled to support teaching which he disapproved. Some £900 was paid over to the churches the first year. The coming of a new governor (Sir Henry Young), a broad-minded churchman, gave more political freedom, and the colonists obtained the main voice in the election of the Legislative Council. At the first meeting of the legislators a Bill for the continuance of State aid for religion was thrown out. This reflected the spirit of the colonists. In South Australia, as, indeed, in the whole of the Commonwealth, the Restoration Movement has never had to contend with what has imposed such an obstacle to religious freedom of thought and action in the motherland.\n\nFirst-hand knowledge of the earliest religious experiences of Thomas Magarey in Adelaide is found in a letter he wrote to James Wallis, the editor of \"The British Millennial Harbinger\" on August 10, 1847. It runs as follows:--\n\n- 3 -\n\n\"Beloved Brother Wallis: May favour, mercy, and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ be with you. In a letter from an entire stranger some explanation seems necessary. I was received some time ago into the church in New Zealand by immersion for the remission of sins, having been in this colony\" (South Australia) \"nearly two years. I am in connection with a congregation professing New Testament principles, led in part by means of your valuable 'Messenger' to discard sectarian names, taking the New Testament alone as their standard and guide. For a time baptism for the remission of sins was the stumbling block. A free discussion has been conducted in the most brotherly fashion. Bro. Campbell's essay on the Remission of Sins, sent by you to this country, has been received and produced its usual effects. A fortnight ago one was immersed, a presage, we hope, of a rich and abundant harvest. Verily the harvest is great but the reapers are few and illiterate. We shall pray to the Lord to send more and well-instructed labourers into this field. Two young females have since been added to our number. T. MAJANY\" (mistake for \"MAGAREY\").\n\nMagarey was connected with a small body of people known as the Scotch Baptist Church or Church of Christ. As Scotch Baptists they had met in a mud hut in Morphett Street on the western side, about half way between Franklin and Waymouth Streets, until January 4, 1846, when the congregation moved into a little stone building in Franklin Street, on a 40-feet block adjoining the present Maughan Church property on the east.*\n\n*The site of the block of land purchased for the Franklin Street chapel was in doubt until the Registrar-General of the Lands Titles Office (Mr. G. A. Jessup) recently engaged in a close search of records of early land transfers. He found that Philip Santo on June 29, 1846, purchased all of town acre 266, less 40 feet, some time previously sold to William Scott and others by George F. Angas. In this conveyance the 40 feet is referred to as \"having a chapel built on it\", but these words are pencilled out, suggesting it was afterwards found out that there was no building on the block. This same 40 feet was conveyed to Philip Santo and Thomas Nell by George Fife Angas for £13 on June 6, 1850, and no mention is made of its having been previously sold to Scott and others. In 1851 Amos Armour had this 40 feet and other land to the east of it transferred to him by Santo and Neill. Next to the 40 feet on the west was the \"Wesleyan New Connection Church\", obviously the forerunner of the Maughan Church. In his \"Early Recollections\" Sir Joseph Verco stated that the Franklin Street chapel was built on the wrong block, one which belonged to the Roman Catholic Church, and that Bishop Murphy, when approached on the matter, genially and graciously granted the use of the block until it was no longer needed. Records do not show that this church ever owned a block of land in the immediate vicinity. Henry Hussey, secretary of the Franklin Street Church when it was decided in 1856 to build on Grote Street, stated that the block of land was too small to allow additions to be made to the original building, which, he claimed, had been erected on the wrong block.\n\n- 4 -\n\nIn the \"Adelaide Register\" of January 7, 1846, there is a brief report of the opening of the chapel: \"The body of Christians, commonly known as Scotch Baptists, but who eschewing all denominational badges of distinction, call themselves merely the Church of Christ, and whose retiring and unostentatious habits occasioned the absence of even the ordinary publicity which is expected upon such an event as the opening of a new place of worship, especially as affording to strangers an opportunity of informing themselves as to the peculiar views and mode of worship intended to be identical with the place of assembly, opened their new place of worship for the first time on Sunday last, the 4th inst. After the breaking of bread, for which purpose they meet every Lord's Day morning, Captain Scott delivered an interesting discourse from 1 Sam. 7:12, 'Hitherto hath the Lord helped us.' The afternoon service was conducted by Mr. Neale\" (Thomas Neill), \"who preached from 1 Peter 2:4: 'To whom coming as unto a living stone, disallowed indeed of men, but chosen of God and precious.' And as there was no evening service, this closed for the day the simple but interesting public worship of this quiet body of professing Christians. The building, which is substantial but plain, is capable of holding about 100 hearers, and cost £65, and being paid for previous to the opening (a circumstance almost unprecedented in the annals of church building in this colony where Christian liberality has been evidenced in so many remarkable instances) there was no collection. As begging was excluded there was no boasting about money matters or any parade to 'get steam up', a trick too often resorted to by those who ought to give freely as they have received without the aid of unsanctified stimulants.\"\n\nIn regard to the raising of funds to purchase the block of land and erect the building, details are supplied by a notebook which belonged to Thomas Neill, the treasurer of the fund. The main contributors were Thos. Neill, £2; Wm. Scott, £10/10/-; P. Santo, £5/15/-; J. Verco, £5; Thos. Jones, £ 3; Amos Armour, £3: Total subscriptions, £84/5/-; costs-land, £13; building, £65; seats, desk, etc. £10/8/6. Total, £88/8/6. The debit balance of £4/3/6 was met from church collections fund.\n\nThe little chapel was built of Glen Osmond or Dry Creek stone (as it was then called), and roofed with slate. Philip Santo was the carpenter and James C. Verco the mason, who also did the roofing.\n\nAlthough ten years had elapsed since the site of the city\n\n- 5 -\n\nhad been surveyed and occupied, little had been done to the streets, particularly in the Franklin Street area. They had been cleared of trees which had been grubbed, leaving unfilled holes. Metal for them had not then been considered, nor had they been levelled. As a result during rainy weather the holes filled with water, becoming dangerous to man and beast. It is recorded that one of the members of the church, with his wife, attended a prayer-meeting one evening in the Franklin Street chapel, and while they were there heavy rain began to fall, and the street became a sheet of water.\n\nThey had not gone very far on their way home when the lady plunged into one of the tree holes up to her waist, and was dragged out with difficulty.\n\nThe Franklin Street chapel had no vestries, nor was there a baptistry. All baptisms took place in the River Torrens. A contemporary described the chapel and its situation: \"Those who belonged to that generation can just recall the little stone edifice, its central aisle, with the row of railed forms on either side; its candles fixed in small tin candlesticks projected by a plain wire bracket from the walls; and can remember how their mothers sat just within the door on summer evenings to listen, to the discourse and at the same time to watch the children as they played in 'the acre' with the tethered goats.\"\n\nSeeing that the chapel was opened three or four months after the arrival of Thomas Magarey and he was not actually received into membership for eighteen months, some other disruptive influence must also have been at work among the Scotch Baptists. It is known that a few of the younger men in the church had been dissatisfied with the rigid Calvinistic teaching of Captain Scott and his views on the significance of Christian baptism. The coming of Thomas Magarey and the articles in British Church of Christ publications he brought with him, strengthened the hands of the malcontents. The fact that the new chapel was opened in the name of \"Church of Christ\" speaks for itself. By the time Magarey wrote his first letter to James Wallis his views no longer debarred him from fellowship, and he could report. \"I am in connection with a congregation professing New Testament principles.\" As we shall see all the matters under discussion had not been completely settled at this stage, and the strongest influence until the arrival of Thomas Jackson was Scotch Baptist.\n\nSome knowledge of the Scotch Baptists is necessary to show the kind of soil into which the seeds of the Restoration Movement were first sown in Australia by zealous\n\n- 6 -\n\nteachers and disputants. The Scotch Baptists are highly Calvinistic in their teaching, standing for divine election or foreordination, and the final perseverance of the saints, or \"once saved always saved.\" They contend that the direct operation of the Holy Spirit produces faith, and that as soon as the sinner believes he receives the gift of the Holy Spirit, is born again, and enters the family of God. Immersion simply sets the seal upon what has already transpired between the sinner and his Lord. As the church had grown by the addition of newcomers to the colony some of the members leaned to the opinion of a salvation free to all and the word of God as the instrument of the Spirit in conversion, pardon and sonship in the Divine family and the gift of the Holy Spirit were promised to those who received the gospel by faith, repentance and baptism. A little group of dissidents broke away from the Scotch Baptists when they were meeting in Morphett Street and associated themselves with the \"Christian Church\", which had been established in the city. Among them were Messrs. Neill, Santo, Jones and Verco. However, they soon discovered that this church advocated \"open membership\", i. e., membership without baptism, and returned to their original spiritual home.\n\nThe arrival of Thomas Jackson from New Zealand on December 14, 1847, altered the complexion of things, and controversy soon reached an acute stage in the Franklin Street chapel. Thomas Jackson may be allowed to tell what happened in his own words in a letter to the editor of \"The British Millennial Harbinger\", written April 4, 1849. He wrote:--\n\n\"I expected to find a church here founded on the true principles of Christian union, but my expectations were disappointed. My wife and I applied on the 17th to join the church, but they required a week to examine us. Consequently we appeared on the 24th. when the pastor put the following question to us: 'Do you believe in baptismal regeneration?' I answered, 'We believe that faith in the Son of God, repentance, and baptism are regeneration, and all the regenerated are called to walk in a new life, in hope of immortality with the redeemed for ever.' We joined the church by a majority of votes. But, it did not stop here; it was the cause of bringing up old discussions amongst us which ultimately led the pastor (Captain Scott) and about one half of the members leaving the church, the whole blame of which was laid to you and Bro. Campbell\" (Alexander Campbell in the U.S.A.)\n\n\"Yet it would be\n\n- 7 -\n\nmuch better to censure the Holy Spirit than either you or him. We had two or three still left in the church who contended that Paul's sins were all pardoned, and that he knew it to be the case, before Ananias went to him. I asked for their testimony, but this they could not give from the Book, and yet they had not the candour to say so. One of these persons, being formerly a deacon, was chosen pastor in place of him who left; but his reign was short. On the 23rd July, 1848, he collected all his forces to overwhelm our arguments, but it was all in vain. He felt the word of God, the sword of the Spirit, to be too powerful for him and his party. He gave way, and he and the others who supported him left us in possession of a neat stone chapel. The wooden throne\" (presumably the pulpit) \"we have cast away, gently turning it out of doors, and filled its place with a table, around which we assemble to show forth the Lord's death on every first day. Glory be to the Father through our Lord Jesus Christ. Our number is thirteen . . . I remain, yours sincerely, THOMAS JACKSON.\"\n\nWe see from this letter that Thomas Jackson and 12 others were in possession of the Franklin Street chapel in August. 1849. It is not known what finally happened to the ardent restorer of the primitive faith. He simply disappeared from the picture. The Royal South Australian Almanac (John Stephens) of 1849 gives us some particulars of the church: \"The Church of Christ meeting in Franklin Street is a congregation of immersed believers who meet together on the first day of the week at 11 o'clock to break bread and read the Scripture, as also for mutual exhortation among the brethren. The evening service for the preaching of the Gospel commences at six o'clock, and there is also an evening service at six o'clock on Wednesday.\" The writer continues, somewhat naively: \"This body of believers, for the better preservation of peace among themselves, and, as they believe, in furtherance of the triumph of Christ, have resolved to substitute the bond of union prescribed by Jesus Christ and his Apostles, in place of the abstract themes and dogmas of human invention which they say have nothing to do with the religion of the Son of God.\"\n\nAfter Thomas Jackson and his wife left the colony, a handful of brethren was all that remained of the original Church of Christ in Franklin Street. It may be assumed that Thomas Magarey, Philip Santo (he went to the Burra late in 1849), Thomas Neill, and James C. Verco remained with\n\n- 8 -\n\na few others. When Philip Messent arrived in the colony in 1849 he immediately made his way to the Franklin Street Church, where five or six brethren were found worshipping together. He was not impressed with the service. It was so strange that he felt he could not make his spiritual home there. Philip Santo presided, and when the meeting was over invited the newcomer to his home for dinner. Messent, being as he said over cautious, refused the invitation. Afterwards he found that he had been misled into thinking that the church in Franklin Street taught baptismal regeneration. Going from one Baptist Church to another, he at length linked up with his first choice.\n\nOn withdrawing from the church in Franklin Street, Captain Scott and his followers used the lodgeroom of Abbott's public house on the corner of Bower Street and Kermode Street, North Adelaide, for a meeting-place. At the end of 1851 they united with a Baptist Church which met in a building afterwards known as \"Zion Chapel\". A compromise had been effected between the two groups on the vexed question of open or close membership, and it was agreed that the Lord's Supper should be observed weekly. Captain Scott, after sailing the stormy sea of religious controversy of the pioneer days in the colony, at length reached a quiet harbour by uniting with the Flinders Street Baptist Church in 1861. A biographical sketch in the \"Observer\" at the time of his death, five years later, at the age of 72 years, recorded that he occupied a position of importance and influence in the public life of the colony. He sat in the Legislative Council for many years.\n\n- 9 -\n\nII\n\nThe Franklin Street Church Re-Organised\n\nMINUTE book of the \"Disciples of Christ Assembling for worship, Franklin Street, Adelaide,\" supplies details covering the period from 1850 to the opening of the Grote Street chapel on December 14, 1856. It appears that the church was re-organised under a new name. A minute runs: \"At a meeting held in the house of Brother Thomas Neill, North Terrace, it was resolved that the following persons should meet to attend to the institutions of the Lord's house:--Thomas Neill, Jean Neill, Agnes Neill, James Verco, Ann Verco,--Duke, Joseph Penfold,--Penfold, Joseph Hicks,--Haines,--Brock, Thomas Magarey, Elizabeth Magarey,--Brock, Johanna Isamann,--Smith, Samuel McKay,--McKay, James Magarey, Matthew Ferguson, Betsy Ferguson, Archibald Aird.\" The next entries were made on June 23:--\"Brother Neill, chosen to preside: Brother Verco, chosen treasurer; Brother Magarey, chosen secretary,\" and \"Franklin Street chapel was obtained at the weekly rent of 6 shillings as a place of worship, in which the brethren assembled June 23rd.\" It is not known to whom the rent for the chapel was paid.\n\nOnly sparse events, those regarded as important in its affairs, were recorded concerning the life of the church during the period under review. A few of them are culled as follows:--\n\n1852\n\n\"Philip Santo, Sarah Santo, George Pearce, Mary Ann Pearce, Henry Pearce, Amos Armour, Sister Armour, Joseph Oliver, were received.\"\n\n1853\n\n\"Lord's Day evening meetings were begun and Bro. George Pearce was appointed to speak at these meetings for the period of three months.\"\n\n\"Resolved that members shall be received by the right band of fellowship.\"\n\n\"Resolved that Brethren Henry Pearce and James Verco be deacons.\"\n\n1854\n\n\"On resignation of Thomas Neill as president, George\n\n- 10 -\n\nPearce and Thomas Magarey were appointed. Amos Armour replaced James Verco as deacon.\"\n\nNovember 5, 1854\n\n\"Brother Magarey offered a building at Hindmarsh for the proclamation of the Gospel. The kind offer of Brother Magarey was accepted and the Gospel proclaimed in the same, November 12, 1854.\"\n\nFrom November, 1854 to February, 1855, there was an influx \"of immersed believers from another church\" received into membership. Names: Mr. and Mrs. George Brookman, Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Jones, Mr. and Mrs. Andrew Thompson, Jane and Jessie Thompson, Mr. and Mrs. Thompson, sen., Mr. and Mrs. Warren, and Mr. Ireland.\n\nFebruary 21, 1855\n\nIt was \"agreed that a Sabbath School be established and that the expense attending same be defrayed by the church. It was also agreed that Brother Andrew Thompson be manager of the school.\"\n\nApril 4, 1855\n\n\"Bro. Brookman was appointed to act as secretary.\" \"The introduction of strangers to the fellowship of the church was brought under consideration. It was resolved that brethren from distant churches should be referred to the President, who would, if satisfied with their credentials, introduce them to the fellowship of the church, and that brethren who intended to reside permanently here should produce testimonials from the church they had left.\"\n\nApril 8, 1855\n\n\"Brother and Sister Lyall\" (T. S.

For your own comfort and growth in grace you need no more.

H. Burford, Philip Messent, Wm. Pollard, Geo. Hammond, Sisters Mrs. Berry, Mrs. Gall, Mrs. Donaldson, Mrs. Cox, Mrs. Cook, Jane Vincent, Sister Pollard, Charlotte Envor (?), and Mrs. McLaren.\"\n\nAt this time several members were transferred to form the Point Sturt Church, leaving the Franklin Street Church with 65 names on its roll.\n\nIn the early fifties Adelaide became almost a ghost town owing to the gold rush to Ballarat, Bendigo, and other centres in Victoria. It was hardly worth while for any man of energy to remain in the city in view of the little business being done. When the gold escorts arrived in Adelaide with the precious metal, the town seethed with excitement, and more men were stirred up to \"try their luck\". But gold seekers like everyone else must eat and drink. The scarcity of flour in Victoria sent the price of wheat up to almost famine price. Messrs. Santo, Verco, and Magarey (Franklin Street members) went into partnership in the transportation of wheat to the sister colony and found it a lucrative\n\n- 13 -\n\nbusiness. Two letters, written by Thomas Magarey to \"The British Millennial Harbinger\" and to a private person (Henry Warren) refer to the effect of the gold craze upon the religious life of the community. He said:--\n\n\"Since you heard from us we have added about fourteen by immersion; we numbered then about seventy members in fellowship with the three churches\" (Franklin Street, Willunga, and Burra Burra) \"and with every prospect of a speedy increase. Such were our expectations when they were disappointed by the discovery of gold in the neighbouring colonies . . . When men are excited about the things of this life all their thoughts are engaged; they forget for a while that they are accountable beings and will listen to no message from heaven or concerning their salvation. Besides, the majority of our male population were attracted to the diggings. For every two that went, a third was thrown out of his ordinary occupation. At length, the greater number of our brethren have had occasion to go.\"\n\nIn the second letter he wrote:--\n\n\"We are by no means sure that rich goldfields will not be found within the precincts of this colony; but I hope not; it has a sad effect upon the minds of Christians.\"\n\nHowever, at the end of the same year (1852) Thomas Magarey wrote in a more hopeful strain regarding the church, after it had dragged through its existence, with scarcely enough brethren to conduct the worship. He said:\n\n\"We have now under the blessing of God enjoyed some months of worldly prosperity, and as the diggings are becoming every day less profitable to individuals, though on the whole more productive, our brethren are returning gradually to their accustomed avocations, thankful for the wealth God has given them, and for the happiness of being re-united to the church and their families.\"\n\n- 14 -\n\nIII\n\nAmerican Evangelists\n\nTHE history of evangelism as it concerns Churches of Christ in this State and in Australia generally must take account of the progress of the Movement in the United States and the contribution made by individual leaders many years before its principles found root in the Southland. All who have subscribed to its tenets owe a great debt to an outstanding figure who was closely associated with the Campbells--the remarkable evangelist, Walter Scott. He was born, brought up and educated in Scotland, and as a young man, on emigrating to the States, soon came in touch with the Movement when he moved into Pennsylvania. This led him to accept believers' baptism and link himself with the new cause. After teaching a school for boys for several years, he was called to become an itinerant evangelist. Robert Richardson, in his \"Memoirs of Alexander Campbell\", refers to Scott's special powers of analysis and classification which he applied to the Christian faith, resolving the Divine plan of redemption into its component parts. He \"saw in the simple facts of the Gospel and its expressive ordinances a power which he believed capable of breaking down all the barriers of religious partyism and carrying salvation to the ends of the earth.\" Having completed a close study of the conditions of salvation revealed in the New Testament and the consequent blessings, the exercise of his analytical mind led Scott to arrange them in the order so familiar to all Churches of Christ evangelists, thus:--1, Faith; 2, Repentance; 3, Baptism; 4, Remission of sins; 5, Gift of the Holy Spirit. This five-finger exercise, as it was called, led him to present the Gospel, as he understood it, in its primitive simplicity. It was commonly held in those days that it was necessary for some supernatural influence to be exerted upon men's hearts before they became fit subjects for baptism. Scott pointed out that the Gospel itself provided a sufficient call, and that his hearers' inherent powers of mind, heart and will enabled them to respond to the appeal of the evangelist. The gifted evangelist preached a sermon in 1827, taking as his text, Matthew 16:16 and The Acts 2:38, in which he proclaimed the Lordship of Christ, and for the first time set out in\n\n- 14 -\n\nconsecutive order the conditions of salvation and the blessings to follow. He had little success that particular day when he launched his strange teaching upon his audience, but it was not long before his simple message, driven home by his eloquent presentation and persuasive power, began and continued to bring large numbers into the church. It was a turning point in the history of the Restoration Movement. \"Henceforth the Reformation, which had already restored to the church the ancient order of things and the simplicity of the primitive faith, was enabled to make a practical application of the Gospel to the conversion of the world.\" Alexander Campbell, writing to \"The British Millennial Harbinger\" in 1854, averred: \"It is to the honour of the present Reformation that it was the first to present in bold relief to the world the grand and sublime truth, that the faith of the Gospel is a faith in the personality of the Lord Jesus Christ, and that a union with him is the very life of the Gospel; that he, and not doctrine, is the centre around whom all parts of the system revolve; that faith in him, and obedience to all that he has commanded, is the sum and substance of the whole scheme.\"\n\nThus in the United States the evangelist assumed the place of importance in the Movement. Early in the history of Churches of Christ in Australia, Thomas Magarey and others of like spirit in the eastern colonies, aroused by reports of what had taken place in the United States through intense evangelism, felt that the time was long overdue for the introduction of trained men from abroad who could give full time to the work. Eyes had been turned towards Great Britain looking for help which did not come, owing to a shortage of men. Magarey, disappointed with the repeated failures, sent a Macedonian call across the Pacific. Whether his coming was in response to Magarey's importunate appeal, or not, is not recorded, but Henry S. Earl, a British-American evangelist, arrived in Melbourne on July 24, 1864. His work in Australia marks the beginning of an era of successful evangelism, and paved the way for other American evangelists of honoured memory to give some of their best years or whole lives to the cause of primitive Christianity in the Southland. The total number of church members in Australia in the middle sixties was about 650. In Victoria there were roughly 400, the remainder being in South Australia and New South Wales. Earl was the first to devote his full energies to the presentation of the plea of Churches of Christ in this part of the world. He saw at once the potentialities of the field and urged\n\n- 15 -\n\nother evangelists to follow him, promising almost certain success and the cordial and liberal support of the brethren.\n\nEarl's silver-tongued oratory immediately drew great crowds to hear him in St. George's Hall, Melbourne. In six months 193 were added to the church. He came to Adelaide on a short visit for the good of his health at the end of the year, and preached in White's Assembly Room (the Majestic Theatre now stands on the site) on December 3 and successive Sundays. The building was filled to capacity, for the fame of the preacher had preceded him. Thirty-two were added to the church. He returned to Adelaide at the beginning of June the next year, and even greater crowds flocked to White's Room. On August 26 the new Town Hall was hired to accommodate the people. In Earl's own words, \"the largest audience ever congregated for religious purposes in South Australia, upwards 2,200, were present, and more than 500 were unable to gain admittance.\" All classes and creeds were represented, including the Mayor, Councillors, and Members of Parliament. No less than 43 persons were baptized during the month of August. \"Thus\" wrote the evangelist in a burst of enthusiasm, \"the cause of pure Christianity is advancing more gloriously in South Australia, and will soon occupy the foremost rank in power if we could only get several able and devoted evangelists in the field.\" Altogether, during his second visit, 123 people linked with the churches, swayed by Earl's overmastering oratory, impassioned appeals, and irrefutable New Testament teaching. Much of the evangelist's time for the next seven years was spent in South Australia (he married a daughter of Thomas Magarey). Twelve months were given to the Hindmarsh Church, which thrived under his powerful ministry. He was at the same time instrumental in opening new causes in country towns. The \"Adelaide Church\", meeting in White's Room and the Town Hall, was built up from a few score to 300 members. He could truthfully say in writing his last letter to the \"Australian Christian Pioneer\", in surveying \"my past labours in Adelaide, the suburbs, and the adjacent towns, the evidence is clear and abundant that my labours have not been in vain in the Lord, but have been crowned with a cheering success.\"\n\nWhen the city church returned to Grote Street in 1873, it was found necessary to enlarge the chapel to accommodate the people. It may be accepted that the removal of the \"mother\" church from Grote Street to the very heart of the city for four years, although the cause of the displacement is deplored, had the effect of drawing the attention of\n\n- 16 -\n\na greater number of people to the teaching of Churches of Christ than would have occurred during the same period had the church remained in the chapel.\n\nTwo other evangelists from America arrived in 1867 G. L. Surber, who stayed in Melbourne, and T. J. Gore, M.A., who came on to Adelaide and remained in this State, except for brief visits to his native land, for the rest of his life (see \"Biographical Sketches\") He was closely associated with Henry S. Earl at White's Room for several years after his arrival.\n\n- 17 -\n\nIV\n\nThe Pioneer Spirit\n\nA FEW stalwarts laid the foundation of the New Testament church in the colony. Those bearded figures, decked with frock coats and bell-toppers, who made their way to church meetings in their carriages or on foot, or in the country, dressed with less care, plodded over long distances in cart and trap, or rode on horseback, defying rain and heat, have now gone. Their best memorial is the church today with its multiplied interests, touching life in many ways and moving with the times. Writing in the \"Australian Christian Pioneer\", D. A. Ewers, then editor, paid this tribute: \"How much the cause of primitive Christianity owes to the consecrated zeal of the pioneers is sometimes overlooked. They had, in those early days, no regular preachers to do the work, nor the means to support them, but the work was done, and well done. They had imbibed the spirit of One who said, 'My meat is to do the will of him that sent me,' and with untiring energy and unfaltering zeal they pressed on, not only keeping the old flag flying, but ever establishing new outposts and gaining ground from the enemy. Most of our strongest churches today were founded by faithfulness of the few who through evil report and good report toiled on with resistless perseverance until permanent victory was achieved. It was the work of such heroes that made possible the advent of men like Earl, Gore, Surber, and others, who, building upon the foundation so well and truly laid, were thus enabled to at once bring into public prominence the distinctive plea of the Disciples of Christ. And what was true of our larger cities was true also of scores of our country districts where brethren meeting in twos and threes to break the memorial loaf and as occasion offered proclaiming the ancient Gospel to their neighbours, thus planted causes that are flourishing today.\"\n\nG. B. Moysey, one of the best-known South Australian preachers of over 50 years ago, was also well-fitted to extol the spirit of the pioneers, which he did in a chapter of the publication, \"That They All May be One.\" He wrote: \"The pioneers were characterised by deep and unfeigned piety in times when ungodliness abounded and many who left the\n\n- 18 -\n\nold country with fair reputations for religion made shipwreck of faith. They were devoted to Bible study. To them the Bible was The Book-their mine of truth, wherein they searched as for hidden treasures; their armoury, whence they took their weapons for constant conflict with sectarianism and sin; their storehouse of spiritual food, whence they gained their daily bread. They were fearlessly aggressive. They were condemned, opposed, misunderstood, and in defence and by necessity, if not by choice, they became warriors, and built the walls of their Jerusalem with the trowel in one hand and the sword in the other. They were uncompromisingly opposed to clericalism and priestcraft of every kind. They sought to maintain a 'thigh standard of discipline in the churches, and took care that the members were not only sound in the faith but consistent in life, as disciples of Christ. They were strenuous advocates of equality of rights and liberty of ministry among the brethren. The right of each one, as a member of the royal priesthood, to serve in the spiritual temple, was accepted as an axiom. The pioneer churches were intensely democratic. They loved to settle points of difference in public assembly. Questions of discipline were often thus dealt with. Sharp divergences of opinion frequently arose and division threatened to become the bane of the churches. They were also slow to recognise and accept official authority, and to this characteristic may be traced, in part at least, the fact that even today\" (Moysey wrote in 1900) \"while the New Testament order of elders is universally admitted in theory, there has been largely a failure to restore it in practice. Their convictions of truth were deeper, their grip more tenacious, and their individual efforts to extend the Gospel more general and energetic, than those of the present day, while defections and losses were relatively fewer. The fruits they gathered into God's basket were hand picked, and that is usually the finest and keeps the longest.\"\n\n- 20 -\n\nV\n\nCo-operative Evangelism\n\nIT was not until 1875 that steps were taken to unite the churches to engage in a concerted effort in evangelism. Up to this time any extension of the cause was due to the progressive outlook of individuals in existing churches. Leaders were somewhat shy of \"annual meetings\", consisting of representatives called together to discuss matters pertaining to the progress of the Movement. A fear was prevalent that such conferences might result in the exercise of an assumed authority over the churches through the setting up of an ecclesiastical body. Annual meetings were held in Victoria in 1866-1868, and then abandoned. When these meetings were resumed in 1873 their purpose was very clearly defined. They were intended to spread the Gospel in those localities where a few members were not able to accept the responsibility. Combining together, stronger churches were expected to enter into a voluntary undertaking to support weak congregations and open fresh fields. Group co-operation among the churches at this stage of history was, therefore, specifically restricted to the evangelistic enterprise. It was fitting in this colony that the missionary-minded church at Hindmarsh should initiate the annual conference. A \"Preliminary Co-operation Meeting,\" consisting of delegates from the churches met at Grote Street on Monday, March 29, 1875, \"to devise some measures for securing further evangelistic power.\" The churches represented were Adelaide, Alma, Dalkey, Hindmarsh, Mallala, Milang, Mt. Gambier, Norwood, Port Adelaide, Stirling East, Strathalbyn, and Two Wells. Philip Santo was voted to the chair, and he asked Jesse Colbourne the preacher at Hindmarsh, to state the object of the meeting. Mr. Colbourne said that it had been a matter of consideration at Hindmarsh for some time to devise a system of co-operation to secure further evangelistic aid for country churches especially. Appeals for assistance had been made to the brethren at Hindmarsh by these churches, many of which were in a helpless condition. Brethren thought a little given by all churches would enable needy\n\n- 21 -\n\nfields to receive aid, and an evangelist might be kept in the field for this purpose. The discussion revolved around the question of where a general evangelist should be employed. The following resolution was finally adopted: \"That it is desirable to place one or more evangelists in the field to assist such country churches as need assistance, and to open up new fields of labour by the proclamation of the Gospel.\" It was further decided to appoint an Evangelist Committee to raise funds and carry out the wishes of the brethren. A committee of thirteen was elected: Philip Santo, W. Burford, Thos. Magarey, A. T. Magarey (Adelaide), W. H. Taylor, W. Shearing, S. Kidner, J. Weekes, T. Harkness, F. Reeves (Hindmarsh), Jas. Hales (Norwood), G. W. Smith (Port Adelaide), and Stoddart (Stirling East).\n\nThe first general evangelist employed by the Evangelist Committee was Jesse Colbourne. He went to Norwood for a short time and then transferred to Strathalbyn.\n\nAt the second annual meeting held the next year it was resolved to keen Jesse Colbourne at Strathalbyn for at least another six months, and, if possible, secure an additional evangelist. Statistics of the churches showed that 105 Persons had been immersed during the year, and the total number on the rolls of seventeen churches was now 1,204. Five settled evangelists were giving full time to the work. An able and a searching address was delivered at the evening session by T. J. Gore on the subject. \"Our Work\" (Matt. 28:18, 20), in which he stressed the double task of the church to preach and to teach. \"Our work, our great work,\" he said. \"is to preach the Gospel. By our work we mean the work of the church. Most assuredly the church is not answering the object of its creation and existence unless it is earnest and diligent in the proclamation of the Gospel . . . We know what a work might be accomplished if every Christian would bear in mind that it is the duty of the church to preach the Gospel. The church calls certain men to devote their talents, yea, their lives, to this work, and pledges itself to support them as far as concerns temporal necessities. If a church once settles down into the comfortable notion that it has nothing to do but edify itself, it is on the highway to a cold and selfish state, the end of which is death.\"\n\nThe only evangelist employed the following year was R. Woolcock, who spent twelve months in the south-east. From the 1878 Annual Meeting R. Woolcock was sent back to the south-east, where a church had been recently formed at Millicent. At the same meeting D. A. Ewers was\n\n- 22 -\n\nintroduced to the notice of the delegates, with the recommendation that he be stationed at Two Wells, at Reeves Plains, and the surrounding district for one year, co-operating with Jesse Colbourne at Mallala (Thirty years later D. A. Ewers would play a big part in a burst of evangelism in South Australia).\n\nDuring the next few years little united evangelistic work could be done owing to lack of finances. From 1883 to 1891 the colony passed through a period of depression. Widespread distress resulted from the failure of the Commercial Bank of Australia, one of the greatest financial calamities which have befallen the country. In 1886 and succeeding years, drought conditions had to be faced. Wool depreciated in value in overseas markets. It was also during this period that direct taxation was introduced against strong opposition. Naturally, economic conditions affected the enterprises of the churches. Funds to extend evangelistic work or even maintain what had been started were difficult to obtain. In those days no annual offering was sought from the churches, nor was there much publicity given to the committee's proposals. At the annual meetings delegates promised certain amounts from the churches they represented, and this money and the result of extra calls when funds fell short of requirements, usually enabled the treasurer to balance his meagre accounts. At the 1885 annual meeting he reported having received £191 during the previous year. In the following years receipts ranged in the vicinity of £ 300. In spite of the fact that salaries of the evangelists employed were scarcely at subsistence level, few men could be employed even if they were available. From 1884 to 1894 the following men served the committee:--W. Judd. Jesse Colbourne, Donald McCrackett, W. J. Way, A. C. Rankine, G. D'Nesi, T. J. Gore (general evangelist for over twelve months), and George Day. Owing to lack of business the Evangelistic Committee went into recess from August, 1893 to the following May. The Secretary explained to the delegates at the next Annual Meeting that some churches previously subscribing liberally to the fund had either singly or in groups acted independently. These independent operations did not disturb the committee, for greater activity had been displayed by an increasing number of \"young preaching brethren\", so that as much if not more evangelistic work had been carried on than previously. Quite significantly no financial statement was presented to the 1894 conference, except the report of £50 having been specially given to relieve churches in Queensland,\n\n- 23 -\n\nsuffering from the effects of flood. The economic situation generally could not altogether be blamed for the financial drift. It was suggested by the sub-committee of \"Ways and Means\" that more practical methods for the collection of funds for general evangelism should be forthwith instituted, and after a lengthy discussion upon the alternative propositions of a pro rata levy to be put to the churches for their approval or otherwise, or the continuance of the slip-shod way of past years, the conference decided to leave it to the committee to use their discretion in carrying out their duty. A larger attendance of country delegates at the next conference reflected a more widespread interest in evangelism. The conference bestirred itself sufficiently to resolve to place another evangelist in the field and to ask churches with settled preachers to lend them to the committee for brief periods. Two evangelists were employed, G. D'Nesi in the north, and R. G. Cameron in the south. However, they could not continue owing to the depletion of funds at the disposal of the committee.\n\nApparently the churches up to this time and for several years afterwards did not learn the principle of Christian stewardship. The money that came to the treasurer had to be somewhat painfully extracted. No account had been taken of the Apostle's words, \"The Lord loveth a cheerful\" (literally \"hilarious\") giver.\" At a meeting of the committee when their funds were very low, a letter was received from an anonymous correspondent. \"Faith,\" suggesting that envelopes be distributed to the churches asking them to take up quarterly collections for Home Mission work. He enclosed £5 as an evidence of his sincerity. The committee was much encouraged. It \"rejoiced them to see at the close of the letter that 'Faith' promised to write again soon. \" At the close of the meeting one of the preacher members offered prayer \"thanking the Lord for the practical letter of 'Faith', and praying for many more similar communications.\"\n\nThe salaries of evangelists supported by the committee were two pounds weekly. One of them sacrificially returned 10/- per week as his contribution to the work. Strangely enough the committee permitted this sacrifice. A few months later this same self-denying preacher wrote informing them that he was involved in financial difficulty owing to sickness in his family, and asking for help to enable him to meet his doctor's and chemist's accounts which totalled £20. The churches be served were requested to assist him in his straitened circumstances. The response was the sum\n\n- 24 -\n\nof £5 from two churches. At the next conference this worthy man, one of the most successful of the evangelists of the period, gave an appropriate and timely address on the subject, \"Courage\". During the next year the distressed preacher's salary was raised to £ 2/5/- per week.\n\nThe hand to mouth way of raising funds for evangelism having been disproved over the years, the committee decided to seek an annual offering for the work on the first Sunday in February. This date having been proved unsuitable, the first Sunday in January was chosen. It was also resolved to reserve one night of conference for speakers to press the claims of the home fields, and another night for fields beyond.\n\n- 25 -\n\nVI\n\nRapid Progress in Evangelism\n\nTHE beginning of the new century saw the committee struggling to advance the cause, owing to lack of funds; but brighter days were ahead. In twelve years, from 1902 to 1914, the membership doubled, reaching a total of 6,772 at the end of the period. Several factors contributed to the rapid advance-aggressive leadership, an awakened Brotherhood, protracted missions in chapel, tent, and public hall, economic expansion in industry, agriculture, and mining, and, above all, the people felt that God was with them. Courage, enterprise, and faith brought their reward. G. T. Walden, then in the midst of his long and fruitful ministry at Enmore Tabernacle, Sydney, spent five weeks in a united mission at Grote Street, with the amazing result of 196 confessions of faith. Such an unprecedented effort was needed to awaken the churches to the success to be expected from a well-organised campaign of aggressive evangelism. The effect is seen in the Years to follow. It was proposed at the next conference to hold a series of missions in the weaker country churches. A tent was purchased for £50, capable of seating 250 persons. It was first used in March, 1903, when J. E. Thomas held a mission at Stirling East with ten decisions. Missions at Willunga, Gilles Street (Adelaide), Hamley Bridge, and Croydon proved the value of this kind of approach to the people. The immediate results totalled 108. The report of the Evangelistic Committee expressed unwonted optimism: \"The indirect result of these missions cannot be tabulated. The churches have been stirred up and the cause has received a great advertisement among those who previously hardly knew of our existence.\" They felt sure that the tent was a good investment. Funds were not available to support a tent missioner full-time in the State fields, so the Committee suggested to the other States that an American evangelist should be invited to conduct missions throughout the Commonwealth. They did not fall into line. Locally a depleted treasury forbade the continued forward movement, although some inquiry had been made to secure a suitable man from overseas with a view to independent action. The Committee had not learned to go ahead and \"trust the Brotherhood,\" which almost became an adage in later\n\n- 26 -\n\ntimes. The Brotherhood, after the temporary revival, returned for a while to its comatose state.\n\nDuring the year 1903-1904 the tent was used once, but in the next year J. C. F. Pittman spent four months as general evangelist with a resulting 81 additions. The tent had again proved its worth. However, this spasmodic effort drained available funds. An urgent appeal to the churches, and a warning to the preachers employed by the Committee that owing to the seriousness of the position their services might not be required after conference, created a depressing outlook.\n\nThe year 1906 saw further successes in general evangelism. J. C. F. Pittman conducted several tent missions, and John T. Brown, an American evangelist, assisted by E. W. Pittman as leader of song, had striking results in a series of meetings at Norwood, with 135 confessions, and in a tent mission in the heart of the city on a vacant allotment at the corner of Gouger Street and Victoria Square, where there were 203 decisions. H. G. Harward and E. W. Pittman were associated in efforts at Hindmarsh and North Adelaide early in the next conference year.\n\nThe development of a ring of new suburbs in the expanding city of Adelaide, to which members of churches were moving, challenged the committee to grasp the opportunity. The return of D. A. Ewers, with a wealth of experience in other States, to his native soil, augured well for the years ahead. He undertook the responsibilities of financial secretary to the committee in addition to his local ministry at Mile End. J. E. Thomas, ministering at Grote Street, and A. C. Rankine at Norwood, had vision and \"drive\". H. J. Horsell (Croydon), I. A. Paternoster (Prospect), H. R. Taylor (Maylands), and W. J. Taylor (Semaphore), enthusiastically led churches which had a mind to work, with the result that membership in these churches increased apace. Mile End Church with its part-time preacher kept step with the other thriving congregations.\n\nS. G. Griffiths came to South Australia in 1909, after his training and experience in the United States, and his acceptance of the position of State evangelist gave an impetus to tent missions over the next three years. He conducted campaigns in a new tent at Maylands, Mallala, Semaphore, Broken Hill, Naracoorte, Williamstown, Long Plains, Owen, Balaklava, Mile End, York, Kadina, Wallaroo, Tumby Bay, Stirling East, Port Pirie, Hindmarsh, Strathalbyn, Port Pirie South, and Murray Bridge. Altogether there were upwards of 700 confessions.\n\n- 27 -\n\nFor a long time reports had been received of the phenomenal success of Charles Reign Scoville, of the United States, in highly organised campaigns in his own land. Plans were made for him to come to Australia with his team in 1912 to conduct missions in some of the capital cities. On August 4 he opened a united mission in the Exhibition Building, Adelaide. All the forces of the churches were harnessed in the huge task of organisation. A complete census was taken of the church affiliations of all the people in the city and suburbs. Prayerful interest resulted from a week's preliminary services in the local congregations. Literature was distributed freely house to house in successive waves. No participant in the campaign will forget the novel advertisement of a packet of \"Everlasting Seeds\", a replica of the seedsman's containing passages of Scripture relating to eternal things, and an announcement of the mission, which, while many people may have been momentarily deceived, had great publicity value. A huge choir was trained by A. J. Gard in readiness for Charles Marty, the evangelistic team's song leader. Night after night crowds flocked to the Exhibition Building. The audiences were thrilled by the singing and held by the magnetic personality of the missioner and his message. During the extended invitation hymns at the close of the address, personal workers, trained by H. F. Phillipi, moved quietly among the audience, encouraging men and women to make their decision. A canvas baptistry was used each night, and whilst in the opinion of many the dignity and solemnity of the sacred ordinance inevitably suffered, this demonstration of the mode of baptism enjoined by the Lord, accompanied by quotations of Scripture, left a permanent effect on people who had not considered the New Testament teaching on the subject. The evangelistic team consisted of Mr. and Mrs. C. R. Scoville, C. R. L. Vawter (supporting evangelist), H. F. Phillipi, and Charles Marty. As a result 957 persons confessed their faith in Christ, and 526 united with the churches. The mission cost a little over £ 1,000.\n\nWith the growth of the churches and an awakened interest in evangelism, there came an increase in the practical support of the work. Whereas in 1903 the total income of the committee for the Year was £350, in 1914 it was £2.242, which included subsidies paid by Home Mission churches and an annual offering of £846.\n\n- 28 -\n\nVII\n\nThe Church Faces Difficult World Conditions\n\nD. A. EWERS, who had already done much for evangelism in South Australia since hi-S appointment as part-time organiser, was asked by the 1914 conference to give all his time to the work, for the responsibility of carrying the extra duties involved in the extension of the Home Mission fields had become too great in addition to the burden of ministering to a local congregation. Facing the crisis due to war conditions, the organiser addressed the conference with the challenge: \"Among and in importance far above all other conflicts is that between the forces of good and evil. The struggle between right and wrong is world-wide and permanent, while its effects reach beyond the grave into eternity. As one of the factors in this warfare our co-operative work takes its place with the forces that make for righteousness. In the past we have had our struggles but also ever-advancing victories. And now we come to a critical stage in our work. In addition to the forces of evil we have to face the prospect of financial weakness. Drought and war threaten to cut off our supplies of ammunition. Can we possibly hold our own? Shall we continue to hold sixteen fields along the firing line, where our forces have done such splendid service or are we to be beaten back? The situation gives us cause for anxiety.\" The churches were urged to make substantial sacrifices. He closed his appeal with the lines:--\n\n. . . 'Tis weary watching wave on wave, but still the tide rolls onward;\n\nWe build like corals, grave on grave, yet pave the pathway sunward;\n\nWe're beaten back in many a fray, but newer strength we borrow,\n\nFor where the vanguard rests today, the rear shall camp tomorrow.\"\n\nWith great zeal the organiser plunged into the struggle for which he was so eminently fitted by character and long experience. In spite of the difficulties of the situation, the churches improved the financial position of the committee. At the 1915 conference they recorded their high appreciation of the organiser's services under trying circumstances. But the strain took heavy toll of his strength and before\n\n- 29 -\n\nthe end of the conference year David Ewers had passed away. H. J. Horsell took his place and did solid service until his retirement in 1940.\n\nThe spirit of evangelism persisted. Tent missions were conducted after the cessation of hostilities by Gilbert Chandler and Will Clay at Balaklava and Moonta, resulting in 60 and 100 confessions of faith respectively; by W. C. Brooker among the Port Line churches; and by W. Beiler. Then another united mission was held in the Exhibition Building from October 25, 1923 to November 25, by Dr. Jesse R. Kellems and C. H. Richards, with big attendances. Again, as in the Scoville mission, the singing of the massed choir inspired the gatherings. Dr. Kellems was a finished speaker, and eloquently and clearly presented the great truths of the Christian faith. Of the 464 people who confessed their faith, 333 were added to the churches. After this effort, A. E. Forbes and J. Warren undertook further tent missions, followed by similar campaigns by E. C. Hinrichsen and D. Stewart at Maylands, Mile End, Prospect and Broken Hill, the results tabulated being over 400. From 1914 to 1929 thirteen new churches appeared. The Home Mission committee sponsored most of them.\n\nFrom 1929 to 1945 only six new fields were opened, those under the auspices of the committee being Moorook, Victor Harbour, Edwardstown West, Whyalla, and Central Eyre Peninsula. The number of fields supported by the committee was as follows:--1930 (10); 1935 (8); 1940 (9); and 1945 (13). The annual offerings, including duplex envelope contributions, were respectively £1,199, £742, £903, and £1,038. Immediately after the 1935 conference, necessary amendments having been made to the constitution of the Union, the administrative and the evangelistic interests of the Brotherhood were assigned to separate committees. For a long time it had been felt that the increasing executive activities of the Union often robbed Home Mission affairs of their due consideration at the monthly meetings, and that the importance of evangelism demanded the undivided attention of a strong committee elected for the purpose.\n\n- 30 -\n\nVIII\n\nRecent Evangelistic Activities\n\nTHE deplorable decline in church membership and attendances at worship which marked the economic depression and Second World War years, a period of over 15 years, happily came to a halt in 1951. Since then the total membership of the Brotherhood has gradually increased. This is in spite of a more careful and frequent revision of church rolls and the separation of \"active\" members from those listed as \"Inactive\", thus showing a truer total strength. The per capita contributions levied on churches towards administrative expenses of the Union Executive Committee, it has been not unkindly suggested, furnishes a motive for the removal of \"dead wood\" by the drastic use of the pruning knife.\n\nPreparations for the centenary celebrations of the South Australian churches in 1946 stimulated evangelism as well as other phases of Union activities. A major aspect of the programme was the appointment of G. T. Fitzgerald as State evangelist, whose successful tent campaigns, extending over two years, strengthened and encouraged some of the churches.\n\nSince the end of the Second World War the committee's progressive policy has stimulated the church's interest in Home Missions. New congregations first appeared at Kilburn and Enfield Heights in the northern suburbs, and Padthaway and Tarpeena in the south-east. Then, with the opening up of new suburban areas by the South Australian Housing Trust and private enterprise, the committee has seized favourable opportunities presented at Albert Park, Clovelly Park, Ascot Park, and Brighton Gardens to open new causes. In the country, Loxton, on the River Murray, and Mount Gambier, in the south-east, have come into the over-all picture. A church in the \"satellite\" town of Elizabeth has also been given a good start. E. C. Hinrichsen had very successful missions at Naracoorte and Kilburn in 1951, which thoroughly established the two churches. With the arrival of E. P. C. Hollard, from New Zealand, in December, 1951, Home, Missions took a new turn. Prior to his coming leadership was in the capable hands of Trevor Butler (chairman) and Charles Schwab (secretary). Their business acumen applied to committee projects laid a sound\n\n- 31 -\n\nfoundation for a forward movement. The new leader, entering the work with unbounded energy and intense self-devotion, has conducted fruitful missions in various centres and given valuable general oversight. Recently the policy of consolidating new suburban fields has absorbed much of his energies.\n\nPhenomenal growth has been the experience of the churches during 1959. Local Home Visitation Evangelism has contributed much to an increased number of conversions and the Dr. Graham Crusade has intensified the spirit of evangelism, awakened many people in the various communities to their need of the Gospel, and brought them to commitment for Christ. The year in which, this history is being published promises to be the most fruitful of all since the Restoration Movement began in South Australia.\n\nFrom the beginning of the century nearly 150 men, serving at different periods, have either been employed by the Home Mission Committee or the churches where they laboured subsidized. Nearly fifty existing churches have at one or more stages of their life drawn upon the committee's funds. The following preachers have served in three or more fields:--R. Harkness, B.A., T. Edwards, H. R. Taylor, B.A., P. Warhurst, J. T. Train, Roy Raymond, B. W. Manning, A. H. Wilson, F. Hollams, W. G. Or am, R. Blackburn, E. A. Arnold, E. G. Warren, E. H. Randall, A. C. Killmier, B.A., W. N. Bartlett, H. G. Norris, M. T. Lawrie, F. G. Banks and G. T. Fitzgerald. (The names of other preachers engaged in Home Mission fields appear in the history of local churches).\n\nIn connection with the \"Crusade for a Christian World\" in 1951-1953, the committee responsible, with Dr. Trevor Turner (chairman), and Arthur J. Fisher (secretary), included in their programme a \"Year of Evangelism\" and a \"School for Evangelism\". These projects served to emphasise the primary purpose for the existence of the church.\n\nW. L. Ewers introduced the idea of a \"League of Five Hundred\" at the 1941 conference, membership of which meant a call of a pound twice a year for the purpose of assisting infant Home Mission churches to obtain the necessary 20% of cash as the basis of a loan from the Extension Committee. The League is now designated the \"League of One Thousand\", as in several instances these figures denote the amount given by interested members.\n\nJohn Verco became the first secretary of the \"Evangelist\" or Home Mission Committee. He served for twelve years until 1896. Those who followed him were Jesse Colbourne,\n\n- 32 -\n\nA. C. Rankine, A. M. Ludbrook, W. G. L. Campbell, G. P. Pittman, H. J. Horsell (two periods totalling over 30 years), D. A. Ewers, H. R. Taylor, B.A., W. L. Ewers, J. E. Shipway, and Charles Schwab. The present secretary is E. P. C. Hollard.\n\n- 33 -\n\nIX\n\nTraining Evangelists in South Australia\n\nEARLY in the history of the Restoration Movement in Australia the leaders were seized with the importance of training men to work the evangelistic fields to meet urgent demands. The splendid success of the American evangelists in South Australia and elsewhere intensified the demands. In 1869 five men were being trained in Melbourne by O. A. Carr and G. L. Surber, and one in Adelaide by T. J. Gore. Apparently the time was ripe for the establishment of a college after the pattern of the College of the Bible, Lexington, Kentucky, U.S.A. But the churches were not wealthy enough to raise the required money without outside help. Henry S. Earl was therefore commissioned as financial agent to tour the American churches to gather funds and furnished with the following letter of commendation:\n\n\"Adelaide, South Australia,\n\nJanuary 3rd, 1870.\n\nWe take great pleasure in introducing and commending to your confidence our esteemed brother, Henry S. Earl, whose labours in Australia in the Lord's cause have been abundant and successful, and who is now about to visit America to present the claims of 'The Bible College of Australia,' of which he is the authorised financial agent. We trust his appeals on behalf of this necessary institution will be heartily responded to by the brethren, and that he will return to us laden with ample assurances that the brethren in America feel a deep interest in the Lord's work in this important field of labour. We have commenced the work in earnest and in faith by educating, under many difficulties and disadvantages, several suitable young men who have presented themselves for Biblical instruction, and we have determined by the Lord's help to complete this much-needed auxiliary to the Church of Christ. One brother has promised four thousand pounds sterling-nearly equal to twenty thousand dollars--upon condition of an equal amount being subscribed. Owing to the commercial and pastoral distress which has so long existed in Australia, we feel it impossible to raise the required sum without being largely assisted by the\n\n- 34 -\n\nliberality of the friends of Jesus in America. To you, therefore, we appeal. Enable us to say, by the assistance of loving American Disciples of Christ, we have been enabled to establish the first Bible College in Australia.--Thos. J. Gore, Thos. Magarey, Philip Santo, Samuel Kidner, G. L. Surber, Oliver A. Carr, Andrew Thompson, Wm. Robertson, John S. Perry.\"\n\nIn his appeal to American churches through their periodical, \"The Christian Standard\", H. S. Earl gave striking facts regarding the churches in Australia. Six years previously the cause was almost unknown. Now thousands listened to its claims every Lord's Day. Then, not one evangelist was in Australia. Now, thirteen men were wholly engaged in preaching the Gospel. Then, there were a few small churches meeting in cheap and unsuitable buildings. Now, they had large and flourishing churches meeting in neat commodious chapels. Then, a baptism was a rare occurrence. Now, members were baptized into Christ every week. Then, the number of brethren did not exceed seven hundred. Now, they numbered about three thousand (during the same period the membership of the South Australian churches had risen from about 150 to over 800).\n\nH. S. Earl, accompanied by A. T. Magarey, left Australia on January 20, 1870, and returned ten months later. He met with only a fair success, for he had struck a period of commercial depression in America, and outside Kentucky the response to his appeal was negligible. The total amount raised was five thousand dollars. He closed his report on the tour with an appeal to the Australian churches, on which, he felt, rested the chief responsibility of establishing a college.\n\nTo launch the projected college more money was plainly required. The need of trained evangelists was ever in the minds of the leaders of the Movement. T. J. Gore, who was always in the forefront in advocating evangelism, urged in the columns of the \"Australian Christian Pioneer\", July, 1875, that the church needed evangelists whose time and energies were devoted to the preaching of the Gospel. \"We have no idea that any church is answering the great need o' its existence\", he wrote, \"when it quietly sits down to the work of edifying the brethren while the Gospel is hidden from those in the very shadow of the walls where it assembles for worship. In South Australia and Victoria the brethren are alive to the necessity of having evangelists to proclaim the Gospel.\" As to the sources of evangelists he added: \"We must look to ourselves. In order to have\n\n- 35 -\n\nevangelists the churches ought to sharply observe their own young men, and if they promise to be useful as preachers of the Gospel, give them encouragement. All other things being equal it would be better to have Australian evangelists than those from America. We want preachers native to the soil. To this end we are trying to establish a Bible College in our midst where young men can be prepared for usefulness as preachers of the Gospel.\"\n\nSix years later the college fund amounted to £2,340. A trust deed was then executed, the original trustees being Philip Santo, Alexander Thomas Magarey, and Silvanus James Magarey. A Committee of Management of not more than seven members, including three trustees, was given sole control of the affairs of the trust. Adelaide was named as the location of the college. The project had aroused some interest in the other colonies but not enough to induce brethren to invest their money in it. There was a difference of opinion as to the city where the college should be located. Whilst the trustees were \"anxious to meet the views and to secure the earnest co-operation of the Brotherhood\", they were not prepared to have the provisions of the Trust Deed set aside in favour of Melbourne as the home of the college.\n\nIn 1887 M. Wood Green left Australia for America and Great Britain to solicit further gifts to the fund on the basis of certain conditions to be incorporated in a Supplemental Trust Deed, viz., that the college should be an intercolonial institution owned and controlled by the Australian and New Zealand colonies, and that the representation on the Board of Control should be in proportion to the amount of money contributed by the various colonies. Mr. Green's tour brought in another 3,700 dollars and a promise by the Christian Missionary Society to pay 700 dollars per year for five years after the college was opened. English and Scottish brethren subscribed £93.\n\nLectures in connection with the college began in 1888 and continued for two-and-a-half years, during which time seven young men received tuition under T. J. Gore. In addition evening classes were conducted for the benefit of \"Speaking Brethren\". The inadequacy of the funds to maintain a college staff and assist students while they were being trained, and the disinclination of the other colonies to co-operate by raising funds, thus qualifying for representation on the Board of Management, led to the suspension of activities until a wore favourable season arrived.\n\nAfter the establishment of the Federal College of the\n\n- 36 -\n\nBible in Melbourne in 1907, considerable correspondence was exchanged between its representatives and the trustees of the fund held in Adelaide with a view to the application of the income to the Federal institution. Eminent legal opinion was against the diversion of the income, and the question was finally dropped.\n\nAlthough a college as such has not been founded in Adelaide, the income from the invested Trust Fund has been of untold value to the South Australian churches through the evening classes conducted for many years, with little break since \"T. J. Gore's Class\" was a recognised means of training. Financial assistance has also been given to enable courses of instruction to be offered by the Youth Department and other organisations.\n\nThe present Board of Management consists of T. P. Richardson, D. K. Beiler, and R. Johnson (trustees), and L. B. Bowes, C. L. Fitzgerald, and H. R. Taylor.\n\n- 37 -\n\nX\n\nThe Evangelistic Union Established\n\nA MEETING was held at Kermode Street, North Adelaide, on December 28, 1883, to inaugurate an Evangelistic Union. Churches represented were Kermode Street (Dr. J. C. Verco), Pt. Pirie and Baroota (W. Moffit), Balaklava (W. J. Verco), Dalkey (D. Finlayson), Cameron (A. L. Greenshields), Langhorne's Creek (H. Saltmarsh), and Yatina (J. B. Carr). H. Saltmarsh was appointed chairman and John Verco, secretary pro tem. In his report of the \"Promotion Committee\" John Verco, said that the meeting owed its existence to a widely spread and freely expressed sentiment circulating amongst the brotherhood of Churches of Christ in South Australia to the effect that a more intimate and operative association should be established amongst them. Articles of union had been compiled based on those in force in Great Britain and Victoria, which would be considered by the first general meeting and ratified or altered according to the will of the churches. Eleven churches had already given their approval of the proposal, viz., Kermode Street, Dalkey, Langhorne's Creek, Pt. Pirie, Balaklava, Cameron, Mt. Gambler, New Thebarton, Willunga, and Yatina. The purpose of the proposed union was the co-operation of the churches for evangelism. Brethren representing the consenting churches had guaranteed more than enough to support an evangelist for two years. Having heard and discussed the report the meeting decided that the churches named should form themselves into an association under the title, \"The Evangelistic Union of Churches of Christ in South Australia\". The promoters of the meeting became the first committee:--Thomas Dalton, W. J. Verco, John Wark (Balaklava), Alfred Billing, Henry Malcolm, Chas. Clark (Mt. Gambler), David Finlayson, Albert Hall, David Hammond, Donald Gordon (Dalkey), Henry Salt marsh, W. T. Binney (Langhorne's Creek). Dr. J. C . Verco (North Adelaide), James Manning (New Thebarton), and John Verco, also of North Adelaide, secretary.\n\nAt the same meeting nineteen articles of association were adopted. Before the union of all churches in the colony was finally accomplished those which provoked most discussion were:--\n\n- 38 -\n\n2. That no church shall be admitted to this Union that knowingly has fellowship with the unimmersed at the Lord's Table.\n\n16. That no evangelist shall be employed who will knowingly fellowship with the unimmersed at the Lord's Table.\n\nArticle 19 (b) and (c) are of interest in the light of avowed principles of Churches of Christ relating to the liberty of the local church under the congregational form of government and freedom of thought where opinions on doctrines and practices are involved.\n\n19 (b) That the General Meeting shall have no legislative power over any of the Churches of Christ, even those in the Union; and resolutions passed having reference to the evangelistic work shall be binding upon the co-operating churches so long as they are in the Union. If any church is unable or unwilling to conform to such resolutions, its privilege and remedy will be to withdraw from the Union.\n\n(c) That this Union shall have no power to settle matters of discipline or dispute in any church. Any resolution on practice among the churches shall be considered only as an expression of opinion of the whole or a majority of the brethren present at such meeting, and shall not be deemed law to any of the churches, and shall not bind any of the churches in the matter of doctrine or practice, or their communion with other churches. But the General Meeting shall have power to decide whether or not it will admit a church into co-operation which maintains certain doctrines or practices.\n\nEvidence that the position as regards \"open\" or \"close communion\" was serious, is found in the existence of two groups of churches in the colony, one group represented by the newly-created \"Evangelistic Union\", and the other more liberal group represented by \"The Evangelistic Committee of South Australia\", (formed, as we have seen, in 1875), on which preachers of some of the strongest churches had membership. A conference between representatives of the two parties was arranged at Grote Street on May 20 1884, at which the following resolutions were passed:--\n\n1. That the Churches of Christ in South Australia advocating the one Lord, one faith, and one baptism, do\n\n- 39 -\n\nform an association for the proclamation of the Gospel in South Australia.\n\n2. That the association be called \"The Evangelistic Union of Churches of Christ in South Australia\".\n\n3. That the association adopt the Bible, the whole Bible, and nothing but the Bible, as its rule of faith and practice.\n\n4. That no church shall be admitted into this association that knowingly has fellowship with the unimmersed at the Lord's table.\n\nThese resolutions, amending those carried at the previous conference in December, were not acceptable as a whole to the churches of the liberal party, when referred to them for their consideration. The fourth was deleted, but the other three, worded substantially the same, were sent on to the next annual meeting of the Evangelistic Union as the basis on which they were willing to unite.\n\nMeanwhile the editor of the \"Australian Christian Watchman\" (J. J. Haley) discussed the question in dispute in a leading article under the heading, \"Matters in South Australia\". He sounded a note of warning that the churches in the neighbouring colony were drifting towards disunion, and the condition of affairs had reached a critical stage. \"The immediate cause of the agitation\", he wrote, \"which has culminated in a lengthy annual meeting debate and a strenuous effort to modify the constitution of the existing Evangelistic Association, is the alleged open communion practice of some of the churches. Instead of the collective conscience of the church fixing the limitation of communion rights, this important function is handed over to the individual conscience of the applicant for fellowship.\" The editor warned the more conservative South Australian brethren against setting up a creed to \"keep out heresy\". The more serious question which they had to face was not the creed question, nor yet the communion question on its own merits, but this--Should they allow a difference of opinion on a simple phase of the communion question to become the occasion of division among the churches? On the principle of a choice of evils, division of the body of Christ under any pretext was a much greater sin than open communion.\n\nSeptember 1, 1884 was a solemn and memorable conference day in the history of the Restoration Movement in South Australia, for the dismemberment of the Brotherhood was seriously threatened. Much depended on the way the matter in dispute was handled. J. B. Carr, of Yatina,\n\n- 40 -\n\noccupied the chair. All the speakers agreed that the Union by adopting the Bible, the whole Bible, and nothing but the Bible, could not conscientiously permit those who were disobedient to their Lord in baptism to commune with them at the Lord's Table. One speaker said: \"Co-operation with churches practising open communion is an impossibility, that practice being illogical and irreconcilable with the assertion that baptism is a condition of the remission of sins.\" The conference carried unanimously \"That this Union is desirous and willing to co-operate with all churches that adopt the Bible, the whole Bible, and nothing but the Bible, as their rule of faith and practice but we cannot cooperate with the South Australian Evangelist Committee as at present constituted, because it consists in part of churches that knowingly fellowship with the unimmersed, in contravention of this basis. And we plead with the churches that admit the unimmersed to the Lord's Table (but hold to the doctrine of baptism as one of the conditions of salvation and forgiveness of sins) to abandon such practice for the sake of the union.\" Not all the churches were represented at the conference.\n\nIt appeared that a definite split had occurred, but wiser counsels ultimately prevailed, for most of the brethren saw that they had gone too far in adopting the original articles 2 and 16. These articles, they now thought, constituted a creed, and in deference to them the promoters of the Union decided that the articles that outlawed churches and evangelists encouraging open communion should be expunged. However, this reservation was adopted, that every application for admission into the Union should be considered in the light of the principle involved. Just how and when the principle was afterwards applied is not known.\n\nAll will admire the strength of convictions which dominated the minds of worthy church leaders of that time. No one living now will ever know how near the Brotherhood was to being wrecked on the rock of private opinion. About twenty years earlier the churches in Great Britain had resolved: \"We hereby decline to sanction evangelistic cooperation with any brother, whether from America or elsewhere, who knowingly communes with unbaptized believers, or who in any way advocates such communion.\" In this colony the views of leaders influenced by British or American thought had clashed before on questions of religious practice. Happily freedom of thought in matters of opinion has been maintained. Throughout the years, since the threatened rupture described at length, nothing has\n\n- 41 -\n\nseriously disturbed the fellowship of the churches. It is generally held today that if the communion table is recognised as belonging to the Lord and every communicant is but a guest, no one has the right to assume the priestly prerogative of deciding who shall and who shall not share the fellowship. The individual worshipper, whether immersed or not, must decide this personal question in the light of his own conscience and Christian experience. But the church is not absolved from the responsibility, as occasion may offer, of setting out the New Testament doctrine of conversion.\n\nHow difficult the more conservative brethren have found it to be consistent in their attitude towards the unimmersed may be illustrated from an incident in those days. A godly elder of a country church not only refused fellowship at the Lord's Table to the unimmersed but also returned money to such pious people who had happened to be worshipping at the morning service, and who had incurred his displeasure by daring to place an offering on the plate. One Lord's Day his niece, who happened to be a guest in his home over the week-end and who was a faithful member of a pædo-Baptist church, came to, the service, and much to the surprise of the congregation she was permitted to commune. A deacon approached the elder after the service and asked, \"How is it, Brother -----, that at other times you refuse to let the unbaptized partake of the Supper, but this morning your niece, Mrs. -----, was given the privilege?\" \"Ah, John,\" the old Scotchman answered, \"but she was a guid wuman.\"\n\nMuch more unanimity was displayed at the second annual meeting of the Union in 1885. When the conference opened thirteen churches were co-operating under the constitution. Most of the non-co-operating churches also had representatives at the meeting, viz., Grote Street, Alma, Hindmarsh, Mallala, Norwood, Strathalbyn, Stirling East, and Wild Horse Plains. All present were invited by the chairman to freely express their views on any matter brought before the meeting. The secretary (John Verco) reported that he had written to all known Churches of Christ in the colony, extending a cordial invitation for their co-operation upon the basis of the amended articles of association, and the replies he had received inspired the hope that no obstacle now existed to prevent united action. After further slight amendments had been made to the rules the secretary moved \"That the following Churches of Christ in South Australia be now recognised as members of The Evangelistic\n\n- 42 -\n\nUnion of Churches of Christ in South Australia, viz., Hindmarsh, Grote Street, North Adelaide, Baroota, Balaklava, Cameron, Dalkey, Millicent, Mount Gambler, Langhorne's Creek, Port Pirie, Yatina, Norwood, Stirling East, Unley, Wild Horse Plains, Long Plains, Mallala, Milang, Point Sturt, Strathalbyn, Willunga, Alma, Hall, and Halbury.\" The resolution was carried unanimously. Notwithstanding, several years passed before there was complete accord among the churches.\n\n- 43 -\n\nXI\n\nInstrumental Music in the Churches\n\nTHE introduction of the organ into the church services had long disturbed the peace of churches before the question was finally raised at the annual meeting in 1886. It was moved \"That the delegates of the various churches now assembled express regret at the introduction of instrumental music into some of our churches, as such is offensive to many of the brethren and is likely to prove disastrous to the peace and prosperity of the Churches of Christ in this colony. We would, therefore, respectfully urge that the brethren who have introduced this innovation give the matter their best and earnest attention and have the organ removed as early as possible.\" This drastic motion called for a counter amendment, \"That this meeting considers it inexpedient at the present time to express any judgement on the subject.\" A long and lively discussion ensued, and unanimity not having been obtained, the motion was allowed to stand over until the next meeting. At that meeting it was withdrawn after a short debate.\n\nThe organ question was not a storm in a tea cup to many estimable brethren, and the refusal of the annual meeting to commit itself threw the question back to the local churches for settlement. Here it caused some sleepless nights. Brethren were concerned because instrumental music is not mentioned in the New Testament as an accessory to the worship of the primitive church. A \"Thus saith the Lord\" or a principle that might be applied seemed to be wanting. The older folk generally were quite content to carry on their worship without an instrument. It did not distress them very much when the tune was pitched too low or too high for the congregation to follow, and the leader of song had to call for a halt and make a fresh start They had become accustomed to such failures. But the young people were beginning to make their presence felt in the churches, and wanted music of a better quality, with a greater diversity of tunes. So the fathers had to sink their feelings to attract and hold youth. One good brother in a country church referred most disparagingly to the organ as \"a kist of whistles\", and opined that \"the devil had put it into the chapel.\" But whether the presence of the\n\n- 44 -\n\norgan is due to the agency and activity of the evil spirit or not, the organ came, and it came to stay. The said brother left his home church and went to another out of the hearing of the \"whistles\", but the devil followed him there with another \"kist\", and as the brother had nowhere else to go for worship to escape the malignant spirit, he carried on his good work as an acceptable speaker, in spite of the serious handicap, and no doubt in time became somewhat accustomed to the use of the organ in worship, as others did. Whilst appreciating the loyalty of the older brethren to the Book, it was not unkindly suggested by the liberal element in the churches that it was quite as unscriptural to use a tuning fork as an organ. However, let it be said in support of the conservatives that when the proper pitch of the tune was struck, the congregation did really sing in the days of the \"pipe\" and the \"tuning fork\". After all said and done the use of the organ in worship is a question of expediency and not of faith. To show how far brethren have gone in the use of instrumental music to aid worship, it is reported that even pipe organs have appeared in some chapels of Churches of Christ.\n\n- 45 -\n\nXII\n\nAnniversary Teas and Public Meetings\n\nIN pioneer days the greatest annual events in the churches were the anniversary celebrations. Even in the city the church people, who were not surfeited then with social gatherings and entertainments as they are now, looked forward with keen enthusiasm to the Sunday m"
