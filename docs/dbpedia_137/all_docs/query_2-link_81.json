        "text": "Stunning views at a fraction of the cost of a waterside property. Kayaking to work instead of your daily commute. Waking up each day to the sound of the ducks, birds and all the other local wildlife that surrounds you. Living on a boat or floating home has many advantages.\n\nNo wonder so many of us are transforming our dreams of living by the waterside into reality. Whether on houseboats, narrowboats or sea-going vessels, around 15,000 people in the UK have turned their backs on bricks and mortar for good – and it’s a number that’s steadily increasing each year.\n\nThis move to waterside living is partly driven by the higher cost of traditional home ownership. Since stamp-duty rates went up in 2016, prospective buyers have been turning to houseboats in such large numbers that specialist estate agents can’t keep up with demand.\n\nBut of course, money isn’t the only reason. Our waterways are the jewel in the UK’s crown, yet many of us don’t have the chance to fully appreciate them. Securing a residential mooring in a marina could be the answer, helping you transform your passion for the nation’s rivers, canals and coastline into your lifestyle.\n\nEven if you’ve been a leisure boater for years, making your boat your permanent home brings with it its own joys and adventures. So, what do you need to consider before you plunge head-first into the live-aboard lifestyle? Could you live on a boat in the winter? How will you manage to work? Our guide to living on a boat in a residential mooring has all the answers.\n\nYou’re looking for a healthy, active lifestyle\n\nIf you own a boat already, you’ll know what a physically demanding hobby it is. Filling the water tank, carrying bags of coal, wood and replacing gas bottles. Who needs a gym membership?! But remember, it's all part of the lifestyle and what makes living life afloat so much more interesting and different from that of life on land. Plus living closer to nature is proven to have huge benefits on both your physical and mental well-being.\n\nYou love the great outdoors\n\nThere’s nothing like throwing open your side hatch every morning to watch the wildlife, even if it’s just a family of ducks looking for your leftover toast crumbs. The UK's inland waterways attract everything from kingfishers and water voles to otters, making them some of the most beautiful, natural places to live in the UK. And, with the swaying of the boat in a gentle evening breeze and the sound of the rain pattering on the deck, life on-board will help you get fully in-tune with the changing seasons, too.\n\nYou want to live a greener life\n\nWhen living life aboard a boat you have to think greener. You gain true realisation of how much waste you produce daily. It makes you think smarter and means you can’t help but minimise your carbon footprint.\n\nYou want to live in a close-knit community\n\nA love of the same lifestyle brings people together. In fact, one of the things that makes living on a boat so special is the village feel that’s almost disappeared from land-based living. Your neighbours will be people who are invested and inspired by their environment, just like you! And they’ll have a wealth of knowledge to share with you, too.\n\nYou want to live a more cost-effective life\n\nAs anyone who owns a boat knows, there can be some costly elements, but when it comes to making your boat your home, it’s still markedly cheaper than living in a house. While the sky’s the limit at the luxury end of the market, the average houseboat still costs less than £150,000, enabling those selling their home to release some equity and potentially live mortgage-free, allowing for monthly or annual mooring fees of course.\n\nIt is, provided you get the right mooring. If you already have a leisure mooring for your boat, you’ll be allowed to spend holidays and weekends onboard, but can’t live there full-time.\n\nTo make your boat your home you’ll need to find a residential mooring. And if you secure one of nearly 800 residential berths at Aquavista’s 17 tranquil, UK-wide marinas, it will really allow you to put down anchor.\n\nWith a residential mooring, your berth can truly become your home and, as such, you can use it as your postal address. This lets you receive post, get on the electoral roll and register at the doctors.\n\nAnother option is to ‘continuously cruise’ the waterways. Whilst this sounds romantic, a nomadic lifestyle isn’t for everybody. You won’t get a permanent postal address and you’re committed to moving your boat every two weeks, so it’s not ideal if you’re tied to an area through work or school.\n\nIf you decide to change your leisure mooring to a residential one, there are a few other legal stipulations you should be aware of such as council tax, insurance and a boating license. We’ll explain these in more detail below.\n\nAt Aquavista marinas, you’ll be able to be part of a composite council tax assessment at most marinas where the council tax gets paid by us on your behalf.\n\nHowever, choosing the composite option means you must move berths twice a year, so we will need to find a couple of other residents for you to swap with. Marina staff can help you coordinate this, but if you really don’t want to move berths, you could opt for an individual council tax assessment instead which allows you use of the same berth all year round.\n\nFor more information on council tax, see our FAQs.\n\nIf you already have a leisure mooring at a marina, you may wonder why it costs more for a residential berth. After all, you have access to the same facilities as you did before.\n\nNaturally when there are more people at the marina for more of the time, facilities and services like bins, water and electricity are used more, which adds costs to the running of the marina.\n\nResidential moorings are also subject to VAT in accordance with HMRC guidelines. You can find more about this on their website.\n\nAt Aquavista we go the extra mile to make sure our residential moorers have the best waterside experience with access to extra benefits, such as laundry tokens, one free pump-out a month and guaranteed parking. As well as a secure home for your boat, an Aquavista residential mooring is enhanced with up to £650 additional benefits each year at no additional charge to you.\n\nFind out more about the benefits of residential mooring at Aquavista here."
