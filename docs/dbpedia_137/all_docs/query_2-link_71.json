        "text": "When it comes to your bathroom, is there a “standard” bath size? Read on, as we help you get the measure of your bathroom layout…\n\nBathrooms come in all shapes, sizes and layouts, meaning that each and every bathroom project throws up its own unique problems. One of the things you'll likely have to tackle is where and how to position your bath. So, it's no wonder one of the questions we're frequently asked is \"What is a standard bath size?\".\n\nWhilst things like bathroom plumbing, electrical equipment and heating all come with industry standard sizes, it can often appear that baths do not come with similar standard dimensions. But is this actually true?\n\nWhat is a standard bath size?\n\nBefore the widespread use of the metric system, it was generally accepted that the standard bath size in the UK was 5 foot 6 inches in length. This now translates as a bath size of 1700mm in length x 700mm in width, which is the most common bath size we sell at Victoria Plum.\n\nAs the average UK bathroom is around 2.3m x 2.7m in size, this would make sense, as it still leaves at least 0.7 metres or 1 metre of clear space, depending on the orientation of your bath.\n\nThe Orchard Square edge single ended bath 1700mm x 700mm is a great example of a standard bath size\n\nOne important thing to remember when measuring for your straight bath is that tiles may give you a false impression of the space you have available. If you measure from tiled wall to tiled wall, you may have a measurement of, say 1685mm, whereas, in fact, the total space will more than likely be 1700mm.\n\nNo matter what type of bath you're installing, whether it's a freestanding tub or a straight bath, find out how to measure correctly with this quick video:\n\nSmall baths\n\nDespite there being a standard bath size, you will sometimes find baths or spaces that do not fit with these dimensions. For example, when Victoria Plum was approached by the BBC's DIY SOS to help with a project on a family home near Hull, we found that the bath actually measured an incredibly short 1400mm in length. In fact, this was so short, we were forced to order a specially constructed bath from one of our suppliers which would fit such a small gap. We now stock 1400mm length baths on our site.\n\nSmall baths are generally considered to be around 1500mm or 1600mm in length, however, in most cases, the width generally won't deviate from the standard 700mm. If you do have a space as small as this, why not consider a corner bath?\n\nSmall bathroom? No worries. The Elsdon corner bath slots neatly into the corner (right handed version shown)\n\nLarge baths\n\nAt the opposite end of the scale, whilst humans are, on average, getting larger, baths have now increased their proportions, especially in new builds and renovations, resulting in large baths that exceed the standard bath size.\n\nThe largest bath we stock is 1800mm in length and up to 850mm wide. That's 5 foot 9 inches, which is just shy of the average height of a male in the UK today. If you have the luxury of space in your bathroom, why not opt for a larger size?\n\nStandard bath sizes\n\nWe’ve included some of the standard bath sizes we sell here at Victoria Plum.\n\nStraight bath dimensions\n\nBased on Orchard Square edge single ended bath\n\nLength (mm) Width (mm) Height (mm) Capacity (litres) 1400mm 700mm 400mm 140l 1500mm 700mm 410mm 160l 1600mm 700mm 410mm 180l 1700mm 700mm 410mm 190l 1700mm 750mm 410mm 200l 1800mm 800mm 545mm 210l\n\nCorner bath dimensions\n\nBased on Orchard Elsdon offset corner bath\n\nLength (mm) Width (mm) Height (mm) Capacity (litres) 1500mm 1020mm 560mm 160l\n\nFreestanding bath dimensions\n\nName Length (mm) Width (mm) Height (mm) Capacity (litres) Mode Tate double ended freestanding round bath 1500 x 750 1500mm 750mm 585mm 215l Mode Tate double ended freestanding round bath 1720 x 820 17200mm 820mm 585mm 250l The Bath Co.
