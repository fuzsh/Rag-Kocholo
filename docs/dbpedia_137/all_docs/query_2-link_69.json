        "text": "This video explains what happens during a hip replacement surgery. A hip replacement is a common operation to remove worn or damaged parts of your hip joint and replace them with an artificial joint. It is often recommended if other treatments such as physiotherapy or steroid injections haven't helped reduce pain or improve mobility.\n\nYour hip is the joint between the thigh bone or femur and the pelvis. The pelvis contains three bones called ilium, ischium, and pubis.\n\nThe hip joint is a ball-and-socket joint. The round head of the femur rests in a cavity, the acetabulum, that allows the rotation of the limb. The surface of these bones is coated with smooth, slippery cartilage also called articular cartilage which protects and cushions your bones allowing them to move easily next to each other.\n\nWhen the cartilage is worn or damaged, the bones rub against each other causing pain and lack of mobility. Under an aesthetic, the surgeon will remove both the socket and the top of your thigh bone. The replacement components are the metal head and a plastic cup which are then inserted back into the socket of your pelvis.\n\nA replacement ball on a stem will be inserted into your thigh bone. The ball is then placed into the socket putting your hip joint back together.\n\nThe surgery usually takes around 90 minutes. You should be able to leave the hospital after three to five days.\n\nFor the first weeks after the surgery, you'll need a walking aid such as crutches to help support you. Physiotherapy will help strengthen your muscles and ensure your new hip works at its best. For more information, contact your local Spire hospital or visit the Spire Healthcare website.\n\nHow soon will I be up and about?\n\nYour care team will try to get you out of bed and mobile as soon as possible. This may even be the same day as your operation. You’ll be able to walk with crutches and the support of your physiotherapist while in hospital. You’ll be able to go home when your care team are happy with your recovery and that you'll be able to move around safely at home.\n\nHow long will it be before I feel normal?\n\nYou should be able to get back to normal daily activities around six weeks after your operation. However, it’s important to remember that everyone recovers differently and it’ll depend on your age, fitness level before the operation, the condition of the hip and your normal activities that you do.\n\nWhen can I drive again?\n\nMany people are able to drive again after six to eight weeks, but check with your surgeon first. You should also check with your motor insurance company, as many won’t insure you for a number of weeks after an operation.\n\nWhen can I go back to work?\n\nGetting back to work after a hip operation depends on the type of job you have. For desk-based jobs you should be able to return after six to eight weeks, while for manual labour jobs it could be around 12 weeks.\n\nWhen can I do housework?\n\nYou should be able to get back to most daily activities including light chores after six weeks, although you should avoid any heavy lifting or strenuous activity for around three months after your operation.\n\nHow will it affect my sex life?\n\nThere’s no set time when it’s safe to have sex. You should treat it like any other physical activity during your recovery and gradually build up to it and only if it feels comfortable. Make sure you follow your physiotherapists advice about what movements to avoid.\n\nWill I have to go back to the hospital?\n\nYou’ll return to hospital a few weeks after your operation for a follow-up appointment to check your recovery progress.\n\nWill I need another new hip?\n\nMost hip replacements last for at least 15 years. This means if you’re younger, you may need another operation to replace the worn joint. A repeat operation is more complex, with an increased risk of complications, and isn’t suitable for everyone.\n\nAre there any sports or activities I shouldn't do after my hip replacement?\n\nYour consultant will discuss how to enjoy your usual activities safely. You may be advised to avoid some activities, eg extreme sports that risk over-extending or dislocating your new hip. Try not to put stress on your hip by avoiding sitting cross legged, sitting very low or rotating your hip.\n\nHow can I make my recovery easier?\n\nYou can help your recovery by making sure you’re as fit as you can be before surgery and strengthening the muscles around your hip. After surgery, make sure you continue your physiotherapists exercises at home to help you get the most from your new hip.\n\nWhen can I fly after hip replacement surgery?\n\nSpeak to your consultant or GP before flying to find out what’s right for you. It’s important to note that your chance of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) increases if you fly after recent surgery.\n\nAirlines have their own regulations about passengers flying after surgery, so make sure you check beforehand.\n\nWhat are hip implants made from?\n\nHip implants can be made from metal, plastic or ceramic components. The most common combination is a metal ball and plastic socket. Alternatively, and often used if you’re younger or more active, you can have a ceramic ball with a ceramic or plastic socket.\n\nWhen can I bend down after hip replacement?\n\nYou can usually bend down 12 weeks after having a hip replacement. However, you should avoid bending your hip more than 90 degrees.\n\nHow long after hip replacement can I tie my shoes?\n\nYou should be able to bend to tie your shoes after you have fully recovered from your hip replacement surgery, which usually takes around 12 weeks. However, even after you have recovered, you should try to avoid bending your hip more than 90 degrees."
