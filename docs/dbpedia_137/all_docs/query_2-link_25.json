        "text": "Summary of recommendations and good practice points\n\nHow should the diagnosis of bronchiectasis be determined?\n\nRecommendations – Imaging\n\nPerform baseline chest X-ray in patients with suspected bronchiectasis. (D)\n\nPerform a thin section computed tomography scan (CT) to confirm a diagnosis of bronchiectasis when clinically suspected. (C)\n\nPerform baseline imaging during clinically stable disease as this is optimal for diagnostic and serial comparison purposes. (D)\n\nGood practice points\n\nCT imaging protocol\n\nThe most appropriate imaging protocol will vary according to scanner technology and patient factors.\n\nWhen using volumetric CT, dose reduction techniques including adaptive mA and kV and iterative reconstruction should be utilised where available.\n\nTypical CT imaging parameters for the diagnosis of bronchiectasis are:\n\nSlice thickness: ≤1mm\n\nReconstruction algorithm: – high spatial frequency\n\nkVp: 100-140\n\nmAs (or effective mAs): 100 – 200\n\nGantry rotation time: <0.5s\n\nCT features of bronchiectasis\n\nBronchiectasis is defined by bronchial dilatation as suggested by one or more of the following:\n\nBronchoarterial ratio >1 (internal airway lumen vs adjacent pulmonary artery)\n\nLack of tapering\n\nAirway visibility within 1cm of costal pleural surface or touching mediastinal pleura.\n\nThe following indirect signs are commonly associated with bronchiectasis:\n\nBronchial wall thickening\n\nMucus impaction\n\nMosaic perfusion / air trapping on expiratory CT\n\nGeneral\n\nCT scanning can also aid in identifying an aetiology of bronchiectasis eg Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA), Non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM), primary ciliary dyskinesia, alpha one antitrypsin deficiency, Williams Campbell syndrome and a foreign body.\n\nIn whom should the diagnosis of bronchiectasis be suspected?\n\nRecommendations\n\nConsider investigation for bronchiectasis in patients with persistent production of mucopurulent or purulent sputum particularly with relevant associated risk factors. (D)\n\nConsider investigation for bronchiectasis in patients with rheumatoid arthritis if they have symptoms of chronic productive cough or recurrent chest infections. (C)\n\nConsider investigation for bronchiectasis in patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) with frequent exacerbations (two or more annually) and a previous positive sputum culture for P. aeruginosa whilst stable. (B)\n\nConsider investigation for bronchiectasis in patients with inflammatory bowel disease and chronic productive cough. (C)\n\nGood practice points\n\nIn at risk groups, if bronchiectasis is suspected, bronchiectasis needs confirmation.\n\nIn patients with COPD, investigation for bronchiectasis may be appropriate especially in the presence of chronic productive cough with positive sputum cultures for potentially pathogenic microorganisms (PPM) whilst stable or 2 or more exacerbations in the preceding 12 months.\n\nIn patients with asthma, investigation for bronchiectasis may be appropriate with severe or poorly-controlled disease.\n\nIn patients with a history of HIV-1 infection, solid organ and bone marrow transplant, and history of immunosuppressive therapy for lymphoma and vasculitis, investigation for bronchiectasis may be appropriate with symptoms of chronic productive cough or recurrent chest infections.\n\nIn patients with chronic rhinosinusitis, investigation for bronchiectasis may be appropriate with symptoms of chronic productive cough or recurrent chest infections.\n\nIn patients with other connective tissue disease or inflammatory bowel disease, investigation for bronchiectasis may be appropriate if they have symptoms such as chronic productive cough or recurrent chest infections.\n\nInvestigation for bronchiectasis may be appropriate in otherwise healthy individuals with a cough that persists for longer than 8 weeks, especially with sputum production or a history of an appropriate trigger (see BTS Recommendations for the management of cough in adults (61)).\n\nInvestigations for causes of bronchiectasis\n\nRecommendations (see Table 1)\n\nA panel of investigations should be performed to establish the underlying cause of bronchiectasis. (B)\n\nCo-morbidities and past medical history should be recorded in patients diagnosed with bronchiectasis to identify relevant and possibly causative disease such as rheumatoid arthritis, COPD, asthma, gastro-oesophageal reflux disease and inflammatory bowel disease. (C)\n\nMeasure full blood count, serum total IgE and assessment of sensitisation (specific IgE or skin prick test) to Aspergillus fumigatus in all patients with bronchiectasis. (D)\n\nSerum Immunoglobulin G (IgG), Immunoglobulin A (IgA) and Immunoglobulin M (IgM) should be performed in all patients with bronchiectasis. (C)\n\nConsider measuring baseline specific antibody levels against capsular polysaccharides of Streptococcus pneumoniae in all patients to investigate for specific antibody deficiency. If pneumococcal antibodies are low, immunise with 23 valent polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccine, followed by measurement of specific antibody levels 4–8 weeks later. (D)\n\nTest for cystic fibrosis (according to NICE Guidelines for Cystic Fibrosis (CF)) in patients with supporting clinical features, for example, early onset, male infertility, malabsorption, pancreatitis. (B)\n\nTest for Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (PCD) (according to ERS Guidelines for PCD Diagnosis) in patients with supporting clinical features, including a history of neonatal distress, symptoms from childhood, recurrent otitis media, rhinosinusitis, or infertility. (A)\n\nSputum cultures should be performed in all patients with bronchiectasis for routine and mycobacterial culture. (D)\n\nGood practice points\n\nA previous diagnosis of idiopathic bronchiectasis should prompt careful reinvestigation for a primary cause in the context of a deteriorating clinical course or a young patient (usually considered to be age 50 and under but not limited to this age group).\n\nReferral to a specialist centre for investigation should be considered for young patients (usually considered to be age 50 and under but not limited to this age group) and those with apparent idiopathic bronchiectasis especially where there is evidence of progressive disease.\n\nConsider testing for rheumatoid factor (RF), anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti CCP), antinuclear antibodies (ANA) and anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) in patients with coexisting clinical features of arthritis, connective tissue disease and/or systemic vasculitis.\n\nConsider testing for alpha 1 antitrypsin (A1AT) deficiency in patients with coexisting basal panacinar emphysema.\n\nInvestigations for reflux and aspiration should be undertaken only in symptomatic patients, or where there are other suggestive clinical features.\n\nConsider bronchoscopy for patients with localised disease to rule out an endobronchial lesion or foreign body as the cause of bronchiectasis.\n\nA bronchial aspiration or bronchial wash targeting the areas of bronchiectasis from CT scan of the chest should be considered in patients who do not expectorate and can be particularly helpful in the diagnosis of NTM pulmonary disease.\n\nSerum protein electrophoresis should be performed in all patients with bronchiectasis with raised immunoglobulins.\n\nConsider HIV-1 serology in patient with bronchiectasis depending on prevalence of HIV-1 and clinical features suggestive of increased risk of retroviral infection.\n\nResearch recommendations\n\nConsensus criteria for diagnosis of ABPA need to be validated in bronchiectasis cohorts.\n\nConsensus criteria for definition of abnormal post pneumococcal test immunisation antibody responses need to be validated in bronchiectasis cohorts.\n\nSeverity scoring\n\nGood practice point\n\nConsider using the bronchiectasis severity index which may help guide management.\n\nStable state treatment\n\nWhich patients should be taught airway clearance techniques?\n\nRecommendation\n\nTeach individuals with bronchiectasis to perform airway clearance. (D)\n\nGood practice points\n\nAirway clearance techniques should be taught by a respiratory physiotherapist.\n\nAt initial assessment, a respiratory physiotherapist should educate the patient about their condition and if appropriate give advice on adjuncts (inhaled/oral therapy or exercise) that may enhance effectiveness of their chosen airway clearance technique.\n\nPatients admitted with an exacerbation of bronchiectasis should be seen daily by a respiratory physiotherapist until their airway clearance is optimised.\n\nWhich airway clearance techniques should be taught?\n\nRecommendations\n\nOffer active cycle of breathing techniques or oscillating positive expiratory pressure to individuals with bronchiectasis. (D)\n\nConsider gravity assisted positioning (where not contraindicated) to enhance the effectiveness of an airway clearance technique. (D)\n\nGood practice points\n\nCT imaging should be reviewed to complement the physiotherapy assessment. Where indicated, this information could be used in order to teach the patient the appropriate postural drainage position(s) for their affected bronchopulmonary segment(s).\n\nPatients should be made aware of the range of available airway clearance techniques.\n\nConsider patient preference and adherence when recommending an airway clearance technique.\n\nConsider the inclusion of the forced expiration technique (huff) should be considered for all airway clearance techniques.\n\nConsider modified postural drainage (no head down tilt) in patients for whom postural drainage is contraindicated or not tolerated.\n\nIf symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux increase with modified postural drainage (no head down tilt), an airway clearance technique in the sitting position should be taught.\n\nConsider autogenic drainage, positive expiratory pressure, high frequency chest wall oscillation and intrapulmonary percussive ventilation as an alternative airway clearance technique if other techniques are not effective or acceptable to the patient.\n\nPatients should be encouraged to perform regular physical exercise (plus the forced expiration technique/huff) to promote airway clearance.\n\nIf there is ongoing haemoptysis, refer back to the respiratory physiotherapist to determine the optimum airways clearance technique.\n\nAirway clearance techniques during an acute exacerbation\n\nGood practice points\n\nManual techniques may be offered to enhance sputum clearance when the patient is fatigued or undergoing an exacerbation.\n\nConsider intermittent positive pressure breathing or non-invasive ventilation during an acute exacerbation to offload the work of breathing so fatigued and/or breathless patients can tolerate a longer treatment session and can adopt postural drainage positions.\n\nResearch recommendations\n\nRandomised controlled trials using clinically important outcome measures are required to assess the effectiveness of airway clearance techniques in varying severities of bronchiectasis.\n\nRandomised controlled trials are required to evaluate the effects of airway clearance techniques in patients who are undergoing an exacerbation.\n\nHow often should patients carry out airway clearance techniques?\n\nGood practice points\n\nThe frequency and duration of the airway clearance technique should be tailored to the individual and may alter during periods of exacerbation.\n\nAdvise individuals to perform their airway clearance technique for a minimum of 10 minutes (up to a maximum of 30 minutes). After this time they should continue until two clear huffs or coughs are completed, or until the patient is starting to become fatigued.\n\nHow soon should the patient be reviewed after the initial assessment?\n\nGood practice points\n\nIndividuals that have been assessed and taught an airway clearance technique should be reviewed by a respiratory physiotherapist within 3 months of their initial assessment.\n\nIndividuals with bronchiectasis who are followed up in secondary care should be assessed by a respiratory physiotherapist as part of their annual clinical review to ensure their airway clearance regimen is optimised.\n\nAll individuals with a deterioration in their condition (increased frequency of exacerbations and/or worsening of symptoms) should have their airway clearance technique reviewed by a respiratory physiotherapist (See figure 1 – management of the deteriorating patient).\n\nMucoactives in bronchiectasis\n\nRecommendations\n\nDo not routinely use recombinant human DNase in adults with bronchiectasis. (A)\n\nConsider the use of humidification with sterile water or normal saline to facilitate airway clearance. (D)\n\nGood practice points\n\nConsider a trial of mucoactive treatment in patients with bronchiectasis who have difficulty in sputum expectoration.\n\nPerform an airway reactivity challenge test when inhaled mucoactive treatment is first administered.\n\nConsider pre-treatment with a bronchodilator prior to inhaled or nebulised mucoactive treatments especially in individuals where bronchoconstriction is likely (patients with asthma or bronchial hyper-reactivity and those with severe airflow obstruction FEV1<1 litre).\n\nIf carbocysteine is prescribed, a 6 month trial should be given and continued if there is ongoing clinical benefit.\n\nSee Figures 3 and 4 and Appendix 2.\n\nAppendix 2\n\nResearch recommendation\n\nRandomised controlled trials are needed to assess the long term impact of muco-active therapies.\n\nWhat is the evidence for long term anti-inflammatory therapies in bronchiectasis?\n\nRecommendations\n\nDo not routinely offer inhaled corticosteroids to patients with bronchiectasis without other indications (such as ABPA, chronic asthma, COPD and inflammatory bowel disease). (B)\n\nDo not offer long-term oral corticosteroids for patients with bronchiectasis without other indications (such as ABPA, chronic asthma, COPD, inflammatory bowel disease). (D)\n\nDo not routinely offer phosphodiesterase type 4 (PDE4) inhibitors, methylxanthines or leukotriene receptor antagonists for bronchiectasis treatment. (D)\n\nDo not routinely offer CXCR2 antagonists, neutrophil elastase inhibitors or statins for bronchiectasis treatment. (B)\n\nGood practice point\n\nInhaled corticosteroids have an established role in the management of asthma and in a proportion of patients with COPD which are common co-morbid conditions in bronchiectasis.\n\nResearch recommendation\n\nRandomised controlled trials are needed to assess the long term impact of anti-inflammatory therapies.\n\nWhat treatments improve outcomes for patients with stable bronchiectasis? (see Figure 2 and Appendix 2 and 3)\n\nAppendix 3\n\nRecommendations\n\nConsider long term antibiotics in patients with bronchiectasis who experience 3 or more exacerbations per year. (A)\n\nIn these patients, the following are recommended\n\nP. aeruginosa colonised patients\n\nUse inhaled colistin for patients with bronchiectasis and chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection. (B)\n\nConsider inhaled gentamicin as a second line alternative to colistin for patients with bronchiectasis and chronic P. aeruginosa infection. (B)\n\nConsider azithromycin or erythromycin as an alternative (eg, if a patient does not tolerate inhaled antibiotics) to an inhaled antibiotic for patients with bronchiectasis and chronic P. aeruginosa infection. (B)\n\nConsider azithromycin or erythromycin as an additive treatment to an inhaled antibiotic for patients with bronchiectasis and chronic P. aeruginosa infection who have a high exacerbation frequency. (D)\n\nNon- P. aeruginosa colonised patients\n\ne. Use azithromycin or erythromycin for patient with bronchiectasis. (A)\n\nf. Consider inhaled gentamicin as a second line alternative to azithromycin or erythromycin. (B)\n\ng. Consider doxycycline as an alternative in patients intolerant of macrolides or in whom they are ineffective. (C)\n\nGood practice points\n\nAntimicrobial stewardship is important\n\nPrior to starting long term macrolides, for safety reasons: (1) ensure no active NTM infection with at least one negative respiratory NTM culture; (2) use with caution if the patient has significant hearing loss needing hearing aids or significant balance issues.\n\nPrior to starting long term inhaled aminoglycosides, for safety reasons: (1) avoid using if creatinine clearance <30ml/min; (2) use with caution if the patient has significant hearing loss needing hearing aids or significant balance issues; (3) avoid concomitant nephrotoxic medications.\n\nCounsel patients about potential major side effects with long term antibiotics, and to seek urgent attention if these develop.\n\nReview the patient’s culture and mycobacterial status, optimise airway clearance and treat other associated conditions before starting long term antibiotics.\n\nProphylactic antibiotics should be only started by respiratory specialists.\n\nReview patients on long term antibiotics six monthly with assessment of efficacy, toxicity and continuing need. Monitor sputum culture and sensitivity regularly, although in vitro resistance may not affect clinical efficacy.\n\nAs adverse event frequency of azithromycin is likely to be dose related, 250mg 3 x /week is a pragmatic starting dose which can then be increased according to clinical response and adverse events.\n\nThresholds for long term treatment may reduce if the patient is symptomatic between exacerbations and/or the exacerbations respond poorly to treatment and/or the patient is at high risk of severe exacerbation for example, immunosuppressed.\n\nLong term antibiotic choice is complex and has to take into account factors such as tolerance, allergies and sensitivity, therefore in some circumstances, other long term antibiotic regimens may be appropriate (see appendix 3).\n\nPerform a suitable challenge test when stable before starting inhaled antibiotics (see appendix 2)\n\nConsider cyclical IV antibiotics in patients with repeated infections (≥5/year) despite other treatments.\n\nAlternative inhaled/nebulised agents may become licensed as international studies are completed.\n\nFor patients receiving long term prophylactic oral antibiotics, the preferred option is to remain on the same antibiotic as opposed to monthly rotation of antibiotics. If there is a subsequent lack of efficacy, the antibiotic can be changed guided by sensitivity results.\n\nResearch recommendation\n\nLong term randomised controlled trials of oral and inhaled antibiotics are needed to assess their efficacy and safety in patients with bronchiectasis who have frequent respiratory tract infections with recurrent P. aeruginosa infection or other potential pathogenic micro-organisms.\n\nDoes long term bronchodilator treatment improve outcomes for patients with bronchiectasis?\n\nRecommendations\n\nUse of bronchodilators in patients with bronchiectasis and co-existing COPD or asthma should follow the guideline recommendations for COPD or asthma. (D)\n\nOffer a trial of long acting bronchodilator therapy in patients with symptoms of significant breathlessness. (D)\n\nReversibility testing to beta 2 agonist or anticholinergic bronchodilators may help to identify patients with co-existing asthma but there is no evidence to suggest that a response is required in order to benefit from bronchodilators. (D)\n\nPulmonary rehabilitation\n\nRecommendations\n\nOffer pulmonary rehabilitation to individuals who are functionally limited by shortness of breath (Modified Medical Research Council (MMRC) Dyspnoea Scale ≥ 1). (B)\n\nConsider the use of inspiratory muscle training in conjunction with conventional pulmonary rehabilitation to enhance the maintenance of the training effect. (B)\n\nGood practice points\n\nEducate all individuals with bronchiectasis on the importance of an exercise training programme.\n\nConsider the 6 minute walk test (MWT) and/or the incremental shuttle walking test (ISWT) when evaluating exercise capacity pre/post pulmonary rehabilitation in bronchiectasis. Prior to this, practice tests should be carried out to eliminate any learning effect.\n\nPulmonary rehabilitation providers should offer education sessions tailored to the needs of individuals with bronchiectasis (e.g. airway clearance techniques, the pathophysiology of bronchiectasis and relevant inhaled therapy).\n\nPulmonary rehabilitation exercise and education sessions should be provided by appropriately qualified health care practitioners.\n\nFurther information on Pulmonary rehabilitation is provided in the BTS Quality Standards for Pulmonary Rehabilitation (https://www.brit-thoracic.org.uk/standards-of-care/quality-standards/bts-pulmonary-rehabilitation-quality-standards/)\n\nResearch recommendations\n\nThe role of education, self management plans and who delivers the pulmonary rehabilitation needs to be explored.\n\nThe role of pulmonary rehabilitation after exacerbations requiring hospital admission needs to be explored.\n\nThe incidence of cross-infection of respiratory pathogens in the group exercise setting should be investigated in the bronchiectasis population.\n\nWhat is the role of surgery in managing bronchiectasis?\n\nRecommendations\n\nConsider lung resection in patients with localised disease whose symptoms are not controlled by medical treatment optimised by a bronchiectasis specialist. (D)\n\nOffer multidisciplinary assessment, including a bronchiectasis physician, a thoracic surgeon and an experienced anaesthetist, of suitability for surgery and pre-operative assessment of cardiopulmonary reserve post resection. (D)\n\nGood practice point\n\nConsider nutritional support and pre-operative pulmonary rehabilitation before surgical referral.\n\nLung transplantation for bronchiectasis\n\nRecommendations\n\nConsider transplant referral in bronchiectasis patients aged 65 years or less if the FEV1 is <30% with significant clinical instability or if there is a rapid progressive respiratory deterioration despite optimal medical management. (D)\n\nConsider earlier transplant referral in bronchiectasis patients with poor lung function and the following additional factors: massive haemoptysis, severe secondary pulmonary hypertension, ICU admissions or respiratory failure (particularly if requiring NIV).(D)\n\nGood practice points\n\nDiscuss appropriate patients with a transplant centre prior to formal referral.\n\nOptimise management of comorbidities such as osteoporosis and maintain physical condition through pulmonary rehabilitation prior to transplant.\n\nWhat is the role of influenza and pneumococcal vaccination in management of bronchiectasis\n\nRecommendations\n\nOffer annual influenza immunisation to all patients with bronchiectasis. (D)\n\nOffer polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccination to all patients with bronchiectasis. (D)\n\nGood practice point\n\nConsider influenza vaccination in household contacts of patients with immune deficiency and bronchiectasis to reduce the risks of secondary transmission.\n\nConsider use of 13 valent protein conjugate pneumococcal vaccine in patients with bronchiectasis who do not have an appropriate serological response to standard polysaccharide vaccine (23 valent carbohydrate Pneumococcal vaccine).\n\nTreatment of respiratory failure\n\nRecommendations\n\nConsider long term oxygen therapy for patients with bronchiectasis and respiratory failure, using the same eligibility criteria as for COPD. (D)\n\nConsider domiciliary non-invasive ventilation with humidification for patients with bronchiectasis and respiratory failure associated with hypercapnia, especially where this is associated with symptoms or recurrent hospitalisation. (D)\n\nBronchiectasis and other treatments\n\nRecommendation\n\nDo not routinely recommend alternative treatments (for example cough suppression, nutritional supplementation, complementary therapy/homeopathy, supplemental treatments) as part of the management of patients with bronchiectasis. (D)\n\nGood practice point\n\nRecord patient’s weight and BMI at each clinic appointment.\n\nResearch recommendations\n\nFurther interventional/randomised controlled trials needed to establish the role of any alternative therapies in the management of bronchiectasis.\n\nStudies assessing the benefits of nutritional supplementation in patients with bronchiectasis should be undertaken.\n\nDo pathogens have an impact on prognosis in bronchiectasis?\n\nRecommendations\n\nConsider patients with chronic P. aeruginosa colonisation at higher risk of bronchiectasis-related complications. (B)\n\nPerform regular sputum microbiology screening for patients with clinically significant bronchiectasis to monitor for pathogens and detect new isolation of P. aeruginosa. (C)\n\nWhat is the evidence for the role of viruses/fungal disease in patients with bronchiectasis?\n\nGood practice points\n\nTesting to detect viral infection should be considered in patients with an exacerbation of bronchiectasis.\n\nDo not routinely use anti-fungal therapy without evidence of fungal disease. Fungal cultures can be positive on those receiving long-term antibiotic therapy.\n\nDoes eradication of potentially pathogenic microorganisms improve outcomes in patients with stable bronchiectasis?\n\nRecommendations\n\nOffer patients with bronchiectasis associated with clinical deterioration and a new growth of P. aeruginosa (1st isolation or regrowth in the context of intermittently positive cultures) eradication antibiotic treatment. (first line treatment: ciprofloxacin 500–750 mg bd for 2 weeks; second line treatment: iv antipseudomonal beta-lactam ± an iv aminoglycoside for 2 weeks, followed by a 3 month course of nebulised colistin, gentamicin or tobramycin). (D)\n\nDiscuss with patients the potential risks and benefits of starting eradication antibiotic treatment versus clinical observation following a new growth of P. aeruginosa in the context of stable bronchiectasis. This will include consideration of the likelihood of achieving sustained eradication, the risk of developing chronic infection, and the risk of adverse events with each management approach. (D)\n\nOffer patients with bronchiectasis associated with clinical deterioration and a new growth of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) (1st isolation or regrowth in the context of intermittently positive cultures) eradication. This should be attempted especially in view of infection control issues. (D)\n\nGood practice point\n\nSend sputum for culture and sensitivity immediately before and at each clinical attendance following antibiotics prescribed for bacterial eradication to determine the outcome of treatment.\n\nResearch recommendation\n\nA randomised control trial of P. aeruginosa eradication therapy is needed to determine the microbiological and clinical outcomes of eradication therapy.\n\nDoes antibiotic therapy improve outcomes in patients with an exacerbation of bronchiectasis?\n\nGood practice points\n\nA patient self management plan should be considered, an example is provided here https://www.brit-thoracic.org.uk/standards-of-care/quality-standards/bts-bronchiectasis-quality-standards/)\n\nThere should be prompt treatment of exacerbations and suitable patients should have antibiotics to keep at home.\n\nPrevious sputum bacteriology results can be useful in deciding which antibiotic to use. Table 6 highlights the first-line and alternative treatments for the common bacterial pathogens implicated in exacerbations of bronchiectasis.\n\nWhere possible, sputum (spontaneous or induced) should be obtained for culture and sensitivity testing prior to commencing antibiotics.\n\nEmpirical antibiotics can then be started while awaiting sputum microbiology.\n\nOnce a pathogen is isolated, antibiotics can be modified if there is no clinical improvement, with treatment guided by antibiotic sensitivity results.\n\nIn general, antibiotic courses for 14 days are standard and should always be used in patients infected with P. aeruginosa. Shorter courses may suffice in patients with mild bronchiectasis.\n\nIntravenous antibiotics should be considered when patients are particularly unwell, have resistant organisms or have failed to respond to oral therapy (this is most likely to apply to patients with P. aeruginosa).\n\nWhat treatments improve outcomes in patients with bronchiectasis and allergic broncho-pulmonary aspergillosis?\n\nRecommendations\n\nOffer oral corticosteroid to patients with active ABPA. An initial dose of 0.5 mg/kg/d, for 2 weeks is recommended. Wean steroids according to clinical response and serum IgE levels. (D)\n\nConsider itraconazole as a steroid sparing agent for patients dependent on oral corticosteroids where difficulty in weaning is experienced. (B)\n\nMonitor patients with active ABPA with total IgE level to assess treatment response. (C)\n\nDoes immunoglobulin replacement treatment therapy improve outcomes in patients with bronchiectasis due to antibody deficiency?\n\nRecommendations\n\nOffer IgG therapy to all patients with common variable immune deficiency (CVID) and x linked agammaglobulnemia (XLA). (B)\n\nConsider IgG therapy for patients with specific polysaccharide antibody deficiency and/or IgA deficiency or IgG subclass deficiencies with absent/impaired pneumococcal vaccine antibody responses who continue to have objective evidence of bacterial sino-pulmonary infection and progressive disease despite appropriate management of bronchiectasis. (C)\n\nGood practice points\n\nAll patients receiving IgG replacement therapy should be under the joint care of a clinical immunologist and respiratory specialist in bronchiectasis\n\nOffer patients receiving replacement IgG the choice of hospital or home-based therapy.\n\nResearch recommendation\n\nRandomised controlled trials are needed to assess which patients with bronchiectasis would benefit from long term Immunoglobulin G replacement therapy alone or as an adjunct to long term antibiotic therapy- assessing the optimal dose of IgG replacement and identification of ideal trough IgG level to prevent recurrent infections.\n\nGastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) and bronchiectasis\n\nRecommendation\n\nTreat GORD symptoms in patients with bronchiectasis according to existing NICE guidance319. (D)\n\nGood practice points\n\nGORD should be considered in patients with hiatus hernia, persistent coliforms in sputum samples or recurrent exacerbations with no other cause identified.\n\nInvestigate patients who may have gastro-oesophageal reflux according to local policies.\n\nConsider the addition of prokinetic agents if symptoms of GORD increase with an airway clearance technique in sitting position. Avoid eating in the hour immediately prior to physiotherapy.\n\nWhat is the prevalence of rhinosinusitis in patients with stable bronchiectasis and what are the outcomes of treatment?\n\nRecommendations\n\nThe evaluation of patients with bronchiectasis should include assessment of symptoms of chronic rhinosinusitis. (D)\n\nPatients with bronchiectasis and symptoms of rhinosinusitis should be evaluated and treated according to existing evidence-based treatment pathways. (D)\n\nShould treatment of bronchiectasis be altered in the presence of co-morbidities?\n\nRecommendations\n\nConsider a trial of inhaled and/or oral corticosteroids in patients with bronchiectasis and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). (D)\n\nEnsure optimal control of asthma and allergies in patients with both bronchiectasis and asthma (D).\n\nMonitor patients with co-morbid COPD and bronchiectasis as they are at higher risk of death. (D)\n\nPatients with bronchiectasis and autoimmune conditions should be carefully assessed for autoimmune related lung disease and often require long term follow up in a secondary care setting. (D)\n\nPatients with bronchiectasis who require disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) or biologics for rheumatoid arthritis should be referred to a chest physician for further assessment before treatment is started. (D)\n\nHow should we monitor bronchiectasis?\n\nRecommendation\n\nAll patients with bronchiectasis should undergo routine monitoring in order to identify disease progression, pathogen emergence and modify treatment where necessary. (D)\n\nGood practice points\n\nTailor the frequency of routine monitoring to the patient’s disease severity (see table 7).\n\nAssess patients annually, and more frequently in more severe disease.\n\nPerform pulse oximetry to screen for patients who may need blood gas analysis to detect respiratory failure.\n\nA baseline CXR may provide a useful comparator in the event of clinical deterioration.\n\nIs there a role for microbiological sensitivity testing?\n\nGood practice points\n\nAntibiotic sensitivity testing can be used to determine if resistance develops to either acute or long-term antibiotic treatment.\n\nWhere possible, treatment should be guided by antibiotic sensitivity results but is often empirical based on previous sputum bacteriology.\n\nSome patients with an infective exacerbation may respond to antibiotic treatment despite resistance to that drug in vitro. Antibiotics should only be changed if there is no clinical response.\n\nFor those on long term antibiotic treatment, there should be repeat sensitivity testing where there is a clinical concern regarding loss of efficacy with therapy.\n\nIs there any evidence of cross-infection with pathogenic organisms (conventional bacteria and environmental mycobacteria)?\n\nRecommendations\n\nIndividual or cohort segregation based on respiratory tract microbiology results is not routinely required for patients with bronchiectasis. (D)\n\nGood practice points\n\nGood cross infection prevention principles should be applied: seek advice on local policies.\n\nThe transmissibility of P. aeruginosa in cystic fibrosis appears more common. In the case of shared facilities with cystic fibrosis patients the cross infection guidelines for cystic fibrosis should prevail.\n\nResearch recommendation\n\nLarge scale robust data that confirm or refute the transmissibility of key pathogens such as P. aeruginosa and non-tuberculous mycobacteria are needed.\n\nSpecialist vs non-specialist setting\n\nGood practice point\n\nSpecialist clinics should be considered in patients requiring hospital follow up.\n\nWhat are the complications of bronchiectasis?\n\nGood practice point\n\nIf haemoptysis 10 mls or less over a 24 hour period, treat with an appropriate oral antibiotic. If clinical deterioration, arrange emergency admission to hospital.\n\nManagement of major haemoptysis should be multidisciplinary with involvement of respiratory physicians, interventional radiology and thoracic surgeons. Empirically treat patients with intravenous antibiotic therapy, based on their known microbiology, and consider adjunct treatment with tranexamic acid. Bronchial artery embolisation is the recommended first line treatment if significant haemoptysis persists.\n\nSection 1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe BTS Guideline for non-CF Bronchiectasis was published in 2010. At the time of publication it was agreed by the Guideline Group and the BTS Standards of Care Committee that work on an update to the guideline should begin soon after publication to ensure that the guideline recommendations remained current in the light of new evidence.\n\nSince the Guideline was published, BTS has produced Quality Standards for bronchiectasis in adults, and has offered an annual national audit, and from 2012, both adult and paediatric audit tools have been available. The BTS Standards of Care Committee approved a proposal to revise and update the guideline in 2013.\n\nFor guidance on treatment for patients with non-tuberculous mycobacteria and bronchiectasis please refer to the BTS Guideline on the management of non-tuberculous mycobacterial pulmonary disease.1\n\nThe guideline covers adult bronchiectasis. CF bronchiectasis is excluded from the scope of the guideline. Paediatric bronchiectasis was also excluded due to the difference in aetiology and approach in this group.\n\nTarget audience for the guideline\n\nThis guideline is aimed at all healthcare practitioners who are involved in the care of patients with bronchiectasis: this will include primary care clinicians (GPs, practice and district nurses), and hospital specialist teams in infectious disease, respiratory medicine (respiratory nurse specialists, respiratory physiotherapists, pharmacists, physicians and surgeons), microbiologists, and radiologists.\n\nGroups covered\n\nAdults\n\nGroups not covered\n\nThe following patient groups and areas are excluded:\n\nPatients with CF-bronchiectasis\n\nChildren up to and including 15 years old\n\nScope of the guideline\n\nThe guideline covers:\n\nIntroduction section on prevalence;\n\nDiagnosis of bronchiectasis;\n\nCauses;\n\nInvestigations and management in particular for CF, ABPA, common variable immune deficiency, NTM, coexistent asthma, COPD, ILD.\n\nA stepwise management plan which sets out investigation and treatment of bronchiectasis patients according to severity\n\nDefinitions of severity of disease\n\nAreas not covered by the guideline\n\nCystic Fibrosis, Non-tuberculous mycobacterial pulmonary disease\n\nDefinition\n\nThis guideline refers to the investigation and management of patients with symptoms of persistent or recurrent bronchial sepsis related to irreversibly damaged and dilated bronchi, namely clinical bronchiectasis. It does not cover the management of cystic fibrosis (CF) and, for the purposes of the guideline, ‘bronchiectasis’ is synonymous with the term ‘non-CF bronchiectasis’. Likewise, it does not focus on traction bronchiectasis secondary to other lung pathologies, particularly the interstitial lung diseases, where bronchiectasis is commonly asymptomatic.\n\nSection 2\n\nMethodology\n\nThis guideline is based on the best available evidence. The methodology used to write the guideline adheres strictly to the criteria as set by the AGREE collaboration, which is available online www.agreetrust.org/resource-centre/agree-ii/. The British Thoracic Society Standards of Care Committee guideline production manual is available at http://www.brit-thoracic.org.uk/guidelines-and-quality-standards/.\n\nClinical questions and literature search\n\nClinical questions were structured in the PICO (Patient, Intervention, Control, Outcome) format, (online appendix 1) to define the scope of the guideline and inform the literature search.\n\nAppendix 1\n\nSystematic electronic database searches were conducted in order to identify potentially relevant studies for inclusion in the guideline. For each topic area the following databases were searched: Ovid MEDLINE (including MEDLINE In Process), Ovid EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library (including the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects) from 1980.\n\nThe searches were first run in June 2014 and updated in June 2016 (see online appendix 2 for search strategy). Searches included a combination of indexed terms and free text terms and were limited to English language publications only. The initial search identified 3848 potential abstracts and the second search 1021 abstracts.\n\nAppraisal of literature\n\nAppraisal was performed to be compliant with the AGREE collaboration. Three individuals (AH, AS, ML) read the title and abstract of each article retrieved by the literature searches and decided whether the paper was definitely relevant, possibly relevant or not relevant to the project. Criteria formulated for categorising the abstracts into these three groups were:\n\nWhether the study addressed the clinical question.\n\nWhether the appropriate study type was used to produce the best evidence to answer the clinical question.\n\nReview articles were excluded.\n\nAbstract was in English.\n\nAbstracts were not rejected on the basis of the journal of publication, country in which the research was performed or published nor the date of publication.\n\nThe screened abstracts were allocated to the relevant section(s) of the guideline and two group members allocated to each guideline section. The full paper was obtained for all relevant or possibly relevant abstracts.\n\nThe first screening process identified 1022 of the initial 3848 reference abstracts to be definitely or possibly relevant to the guideline. Two guideline reviewers per section independently reviewed the abstracts to identify papers to be appraised for the guideline. The two reviewers for each section then independently appraised each paper assigned to them using the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) critical appraisal checklists. The reliability of the evidence in each individual study was graded using the SIGN critical appraisal check lists and is shown in the evidence tables (++,+or -). The body of evidence for each recommendation was summarised into evidence statements and graded using the SIGN grading system (see table 2).\n\nDisagreements were resolved by discussion with the section partner. The second literature search in June 2016 yielded 1021 abstracts. Of these, 277 were identified as definitely or possibly relevant to the guideline. However, of the 277 identified, all relevant abstracts from this search had been identified by the Guideline Development Group (GDG) in the intervening time and incorporated.\n\nConsidered judgement and grading of evidence\n\nThe Guideline Development Group used the evidence tables to judge the body of evidence and grade recommendations for this guideline. Evidence tables (web appendix 3) are available online. Where evidence was lacking to answer the formulated clinical questions, expert opinions were obtained through consensus. The following were considered in grading of the recommendations:\n\nThe available volume of the body of evidence.\n\nHow applicable the obtained evidence was in making recommendations for the defined target audience of this guideline.\n\nWhether the evidence was generalisable to the target population for the guideline.\n\nWhether there was a clear consistency in the evidence obtained to support recommendations.\n\nWhat the implications of recommendations would be on clinical practice in terms of resources and skilled expertise.\n\nCost-effectiveness was not reviewed in detail as in-depth economic analysis of recommendations falls beyond the scope of this guideline.\n\nRecommendations were graded from A to D as indicated by the strength of the evidence as shown in table 3. In line with SIGN guidance, ‘minus’ evidence was considered in context but in the absence of other ‘plus’ supporting evidence, it was discussed among the GDG regarding that point and any recommendation hence made was Grade D. Important practical points lacking any research evidence, nor likely to be research evidence in the future were highlighted as ‘Good Practice Points’ (GPP).\n\nResearch recommendations are also provided and the overall research questions are presented in PICO format in appendix 8.\n\nAppendix 8\n\nDrafting the guideline\n\nThe Guideline Development Group corresponded regularly by email and meetings of the co-chairs sub group and full group were held in January, May and June 2014, January, May, September and December 2015, January, April, December 2016, January and November 2017. A number of teleconferences were also held. The BTS Standards of Care Committee (SOCC) reviewed the draft guideline in November 2017. The draft guideline was made available on-line March – April 2018 for public consultation and circulated to all the relevant stakeholders. The BTS SOCC re-reviewed the revised draft guideline in June 2018 and final SOCC approval granted in July 2018.\n\nThis BTS Guideline will be reviewed within 5 years from the publication date.\n\nGuideline group members and declarations of interest\n\nAll members of the Guideline Group made declarations of interest in line with the BTS Policy and further details can be obtained on request from BTS. Guideline Development Group members are listed in appendix 1.\n\nStakeholders\n\nThe following organisations contributed to the consultation exercise:\n\nACPRC, ARNS, ARTP, BGS, BSTI, Edge Hill University, PCRS-UK, ProAxsis Ltd, RCN, RCP Edinburgh, Trudell Medical.\n\nSection 3\n\nHow common is bronchiectasis?\n\nUK data in 2013 revealed the prevalence in women was 566/100 000 and in men 486/100 0004.\n\nData from 12 US states over the period 1993–2006 demonstrate an average annual age-adjusted hospitalisation rate of 16.5 hospitalisations per 1 00 000 population. Women and those aged over 60 years had the highest rate of hospitalisations.2 New Zealand hospital admission rates are reported as 25.7 per 100 0003 highest in childhood and the elderly, and related to sex, socioeconomic deprivation and race.\n\nRegarding co-morbidity coding that may provide information on aetiology, the UK data found no significant co-morbidity in 34% of patients, and the most common coded co-morbidities to be asthma (42%) and COPD (36%).4 HIV was coded in 7%, rheumatoid arthritis in 6%, other connective tissue disease in 5%, inflammatory bowel disease in 3% and antibody deficiency in 1%.\n\nSection 4\n\nHow should the diagnosis of bronchiectasis be determined?\n\nImaging\n\nThere are no randomised controlled trials comparing different imaging techniques in establishing a diagnosis of bronchiectasis but there are several cohort studies of low to moderate quality as well as case series. Compared with HRCT sensitivity of CXR was 87.8% and specificity 74.4%.5 Compared with bronchography, thin section CT performed with 10 mm interspaces demonstrated a high accuracy in diagnosing bronchiectasis with false positive and negative rates for CT were 1% and 2% respectively.6 Volumetric CT has improved sensitivity and interobserver agreement compared with incremental/interspaced thin slice CT.7 8 Bronchiectasis was identified more commonly in helical than incremental thin slice images. Interobserver agreement was significantly better on a per segment basis with helical CT (kappa 0.87) than incremental (kappa 0.71), but radiation dose of helical CT was 3.4 times higher. Multidetector CT (MDCT) yielded higher sensitivity and specificity for the detection of bronchiectasis. Using MDCT as the reference standard and analysing data on a per lobe basis the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values for incremental HRCT were 71%, 93%, 88% and 81% respectively. Interobserver agreement was also higher for MDCT.9\n\nWhile the dose using volumetric CT using the same parameters is increased in comparison to incremental/interspaced images modifications of technique enable improved diagnostic accuracy with similar radiation dose.7–9 Jung et al concluded that low dose CT at 40mAs provides more diagnostic information in the evaluation of bronchiectasis than incremental HRCT.10\n\nWhile clearance of inhaled radiolabeled tracers from the lung is impaired in bronchiectasis this is non-specific and seen in other airways disease so cannot be considered diagnostic of bronchiectasis. Chronic bronchitis, bronchiectasis and asthma were all associated with slower clearance of inhaled radiolabeled tracers than healthy non-smokers (P<0.005) with overlap between these disease groups.11\n\nCurrie et al assessed radio-aerosol tracheobronchial clearance in first 6 hours in bronchiectasis (12 patients), COPD with sputum (7), COPD without sputum (8) and healthy controls.10 In bronchiectasis tracheobronchial clearance of inhaled radiolabeled tracers was significantly lower than controls but similar to COPD patients.\n\nAshford et al showed that ventilation scintigraphy with 99mTc DTPA in 20 patients with suspected bronchiectasis had low sensitivity for bronchiectasis (56%) using bronchography as the reference standard.13\n\nEvidence statements\n\nChest radiography (CXR) has limited sensitivity and specificity in diagnosing bronchiectasis particularly in mild disease (2+).\n\nCompared with bronchography thin section CT performed with 10 mm interspaces has a high accuracy in diagnosing bronchiectasis. (2+)\n\nVolumetric CT has improved sensitivity and interobserver agreement compared with incremental/interspaced thin slice CT. (2+)\n\nUsing modifications of technique radiation dose of volumetric CT can be reduced to comparable levels to incremental imaging while providing higher accuracy. (2+)\n\nWhile clearance of inhaled radiolabeled tracers from the lung is impaired in bronchiectasis this is non-specific and seen in other airways disease so cannot be considered diagnostic of bronchiectasis. (2-)\n\nRecommendations - Imaging\n\nPerform baseline chest X-ray in patients with suspected bronchiectasis. (D)\n\nPerform a thin section CT to confirm a diagnosis of bronchiectasis when clinically suspected. (C)\n\nPerform baseline imaging during clinically stable disease as this is optimal for diagnostic and serial comparison purposes. (D)\n\nGood practice points\n\nCT imaging protocol\n\nThe most appropriate imaging protocol will vary according to scanner technology and patient factors.\n\nWhen using volumetric CT, dose reduction techniques including adaptive mA and kV and iterative reconstruction should be utilised where available.\n\nTypical CT imaging parameters for the diagnosis of bronchiectasis are:\n\nSlice thickness:≤1 mm\n\nReconstruction algorithm: – high spatial frequency\n\nkVp: 100–140\n\nmAs (or effective mAs): 100–200\n\nGantry rotation time:<0.5 s\n\nCT features of bronchiectasis\n\nBronchiectasis is defined by bronchial dilatation as suggested by one or more of the following:\n\nBronchoarterial ratio >1(internal airway lumen vs adjacent pulmonary artery)\n\nLack of tapering\n\nAirway visibility within 1 cm of costal pleural surface or touching mediastinal pleura.\n\nThe following indirect signs are commonly associated with bronchiectasis:\n\nBronchial wall thickening\n\nMucus impaction\n\nMosaic perfusion/air trapping on expiratory CT\n\nGeneral\n\nCT scanning can also aid in identifying an aetiology of bronchiectasis for example, ABPA, NTM, primary ciliary dyskinesia, alpha one antitrypsin deficiency, Williams Campbell syndrome and a foreign body.\n\nSection 5\n\nIn whom should the diagnosis of bronchiectasis be suspected?\n\nThe most common symptom in bronchiectasis is cough particularly with sputum production.14 15\n\nAppendices 5 and 6 show the causes identified from international studies. Often no cause is found despite aetiological testing. Past infection (such as measles, whooping cough, pneumonia or tuberculosis) and is a possible cause of bronchiectasis, particularly if persistent symptoms develop soon after the infection.\n\nAppendix 5\n\nAppendix 6\n\nSpecific disease groups with associated bronchiectasis\n\nCOPD\n\nA meta-analysis of 6 observational studies found that the prevalence of bronchiectasis was 54.3% (range 25.6%–69%), more common in males (OR 1.62, 95% CI 1.15 to 2.28) and with a greater smoking history (weighted mean difference 4.63 pack years, 95% CI 1.61 to 7.65 pack years). Other features that distinguished patients with COPD and bronchiectasis from COPD alone included greater daily sputum production, higher exacerbation frequency, worse lung function, higher levels of inflammatory biomarkers, increased colonisation by potential pathogenic micro-organism (PPM) and increased rate of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) colonisation.16 A systematic review and meta-analysis of 14 observational studies in COPD patients found that the presence of bronchiectasis was associated with worse airflow obstruction, isolation of PPM, increased risk of exacerbation and of mortality.17\n\nAlpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (A1AT)\n\nA retrospective cohort study between 1995 and 2002 of 74 patients with PiZZ deficiency (mean age 50.6, SD 9.2 years) found radiological evidence of bronchiectasis in 94.5%.18 Another retrospective cohort study of 26 Irish patients with A1AT deficiency found that 14 had bronchiectasis, all of whom had PiZZ phenotype.19\n\nAsthma\n\nA careful cross-sectional analysis of 85 patients in secondary care with bronchiectasis found asthma in 27% of the clinic population while prevalence of asthma in the general population was 7%.20 A large study of patients with difficult asthma found bronchiectasis on CT scan in 40% of selected patients; the criteria for scanning were not stated but the scanned patients were older, with a longer duration of disease, on more corticosteroid treatment and with poorer lung function and more neutrophilic airway inflammation on sputum cytology than those who were not scanned.21 In a case-control study matching patients with steroid-dependent asthma to those managed without regular oral corticosteroids, it was noted that bronchiectasis was much more common in the former group and the overall prevalence of otherwise unexplained bronchiectasis was 12% across both groups, rising to 20% in the steroid-dependent group.22\n\nRhinosinusitis\n\nRhinosinusitis is common in bronchiectasis patients,23 but only one study appears to have assessed the prevalence of bronchiectasis in chronic sinusitis, finding it in 3 out of 60 patients (5%).24\n\nChronic systemic infection\n\nChronic infection such as HIV or HTLV-1 appears to increase the risk of bronchiectasis.25 26 27 28\n\nRheumatoid arthritis\n\nClinical studies of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have found varying rates of bronchiectasis on CT scan ranging from 4% to 58%.29–38\n\nThe diagnosis of bronchiectasis may occur in early or established RA, and presentation and diagnosis with bronchiectasis may pre-date the diagnosis of even seropositive RA. Significantly more erosive changes were observed on hand and foot radiology in 53 patients with bronchiectasis and RA versus 50 patients with RA alone, and both rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibodies were higher in those with bronchiectasis.39 In that study, bronchiectasis preceded the onset of RA in 58%.39\n\nA large study on patients hospitalised with RA established the frequency of appropriate symptoms first and then investigated with CT scan. Out of 453 patients questioned, 13 had symptoms suspicious for bronchiectasis and 9 of the 10 patients scanned had confirmed bronchiectasis, giving a prevalence of 2.9% of symptomatic bronchiectasis in this population.40\n\nOther connective tissue diseases\n\nBronchiectasis has been noted in other connective tissue diseases including primary Sjogren’s syndrome, Marfan’s syndrome, systemic sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and ankylosing spondylitis.\n\nA study of a 507 patient cohort with primary Sjogren’s syndrome (PSS) identified 120 patients with suspected pulmonary disease, and found bronchiectasis on CT scan in 50 patients.41 Retrospective studies confirm the association.42–44\n\nA retrospective review of 79 patients with Marfan’s who underwent HRCT imaging found evidence of bronchiectasis in 28%.45 Airway dilatation was described as not severe, often confined to one lobe and was said to localise with anatomical abnormalities such as pectus excavatum, although fibrosis due to previous tuberculosis was noted in some patients.45 Studies in ankylosing spondylitis have found incidence of bronchiectasis to range from 7.2% to 51.2%.46–51 In 7 of 34 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) who prospectively underwent HRCT imaging, bronchiectasis was observed.52 A small study of systemic sclerosis found a high rate of bronchiectasis on CT in 13 (59.1%) of 22 patients.53 In a study of scleroderma and pulmonary hypertension, bronchiectasis independent of interstitial lung disease (ILD) was found on CT scan in 6 of 44 patients with restrictive lung function or crackles.54\n\nInflammatory Bowel Disease\n\nThere is a recognised association between bronchiectasis and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). A prospective study of 95 patients with IBD (83 ulcerative colitis (UC) and 12 Crohn’s disease (CD)) who underwent HRCT scans found evidence of bronchiectasis in 9, all of whom had UC and no reported respiratory symptoms.55 A cohort study of 30 UC and 9 CD patients undergoing CT scans found bronchiectasis in two patients.56 In 36 consecutive IBD patients (23 UC, 13 CD) studied for pulmonary disease, bronchiectasis was found on CT in three patients. 44% of the total study population had respiratory symptoms, but sputum production was described in only two patients- the relationship between symptoms and CT findings was not described.57 A literature review found bronchiectasis in 44 out of 155 patients with inflammatory bowel disease.58\n\nA retrospective case note review of 10 patients with IBD (5 UC, 5 CD) and bronchiectasis found that eight had developed respiratory symptoms only following surgery for their IBD.59 These patients had had IBD for a median of 15 (9-35) years and for those developing pulmonary symptoms following surgery, the time from surgery to symptoms ranged from 2 weeks to 30 years.59 In a study of 17 IBD patients with respiratory symptoms, the diagnosis of IBD preceded the onset of their pulmonary symptoms in 16. 13 of these patients were found to have bronchiectasis.60\n\nEvidence statement\n\nStudies in healthy populations do not provide a strong body of evidence but suggest that persistent mucopurulent or purulent sputum production in the stable state is suspicious for underlying bronchiectasis, particularly if there is a past history of major respiratory infection (eg, measles, whooping cough, pneumonia, tuberculosis) or ongoing rhinosinusitis (2-).\n\nThere is a high frequency of bronchiectasis in patients with COPD (2++), particularly with more severe airflow obstruction (2++).\n\nThe presence of bronchiectasis in patients with COPD is typically associated with chronic productive cough, isolation of PPMs from sputum, particularly P. aeruginosa, increased airway inflammation, frequent or severe exacerbations or admissions to hospital for exacerbations (2+).\n\nBronchiectasis is associated with alpha one antitrypsin deficiency, particularly with the phenotype PiZZ (2+)\n\nAsthma is found in higher prevalence in patients with bronchiectasis than in the general population, (2+), and bronchiectasis appears more common in asthma, particularly in difficult to treat disease (2-).\n\nThere is an association between rheumatoid arthritis and bronchiectasis (2+). The diagnosis of bronchiectasis may precede the onset of rheumatoid arthritis (2-).\n\nThere is an association between bronchiectasis and other connective tissue diseases (2-).\n\nThere is an association between inflammatory bowel disease and bronchiectasis (2+).\n\nBronchiectasis has been reported in patients with HIV infection at a frequency higher than in the general population (2-).\n\nBronchiectasis has been reported in patients with HTLV-1 infection with inflammatory complications at a frequency higher than in the general population. (3)\n\nRecommendations\n\nConsider investigation for bronchiectasis in patients with persistent production of mucopurulent or purulent sputum particularly with relevant associated risk factors. (D)\n\nConsider investigation for bronchiectasis in patients with rheumatoid arthritis if they have symptoms of chronic productive cough or recurrent chest infections. (C)\n\nConsider investigation for bronchiectasis in patients with COPD with frequent exacerbations (two or more annually) and a previous positive sputum culture for P. aeruginosa while stable. (B)\n\nConsider investigation for bronchiectasis in patients with inflammatory bowel disease and chronic productive cough. (C)\n\nGood practice points\n\nIn at risk groups, if bronchiectasis is suspected, bronchiectasis needs confirmation.\n\nIn patients with COPD, investigation for bronchiectasis may be appropriate especially in the presence of chronic productive cough with positive sputum cultures for PPM while stable or two or more exacerbations in the preceding 12 months.\n\nIn patients with asthma, investigation for bronchiectasis may be appropriate with severe or poorly-controlled disease.\n\nIn patients with a history of HIV-1 infection, solid organ and bone marrow transplant, and history of immunosuppressive therapy for lymphoma and vasculitis, investigation for bronchiectasis may be appropriate with symptoms of chronic productive cough or recurrent chest infections.\n\nIn patients with chronic rhinosinusitis, investigation for bronchiectasis may be appropriate with symptoms of chronic productive cough or recurrent chest infections.\n\nIn patients with other connective tissue disease or inflammatory bowel disease, investigation for bronchiectasis may be appropriate if they have symptoms such as chronic productive cough or recurrent chest infections.\n\nInvestigation for bronchiectasis may be appropriate in otherwise healthy individuals with a cough that persists for longer than 8 weeks, especially with sputum production or a history of an appropriate trigger (see BTS Recommendations for the management of cough in adults61).\n\nSection 6\n\nInvestigations for causes of bronchiectasis\n\nIntroduction\n\nSingle centre studies have shown that investigations into the underlying cause of bronchiectasis can change patient management in a significant proportion of cases (5%–37%) and identify previously unrecognised conditions such as allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA), primary antibody deficiency syndromes and cystic fibrosis (CF) which have important therapeutic and prognostic implications.23 62–66 Early studies were conducted in specialist centres but more recently studies of adult patients have been conducted in general chest clinics; online appendix 5 summarises those most relevant to the UK population and includes a systematic review of 56 studies covering 8608 patients from across the world.67\n\nReview of imaging can suggest possible aetiologies although the reliability of this approach has not been formally assessed. For example disease in a single lobe might be due to obstruction from tumour or foreign body, and bronchoscopy would be an appropriate investigation in such cases. Post-tubercular disease might be supported by distribution or the presence of calcification. A diagnosis of post-infective disease would be supported by onset of symptoms soon after the illness. Bronchiectasis following measles or whooping cough is often bilateral and lower lobe.\n\nIt can be difficult to ascertain if conditions such as COPD, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease or GORD are causative of bronchiectasis. Even with an obvious apparent aetiology, there may be value in carrying out standard investigations at baseline, since patients with established disease may later develop an immunodeficiency or ABPA.\n\nStandard laboratory tests\n\nThe evidence for the role of aetiological investigations is derived from studies of low to moderate quality; other significant limitations include a lack of standardised diagnostic testing panels for bronchiectasis, resulting in marked variation in the performance of some diagnostic assays (CF mutation analysis, test immunisation of vaccine responses), use of different technological platforms for some diagnostic assays which may give rise to discrepancy in test results (measurement of pneumococcal and aspergillus IgG antibodies) and variation in the use of reference intervals to define presence or absence of disease even when using same or very similar diagnostic tests (Aspergillus blood IgE levels).\n\nAlthough most individual studies are of low/moderate quality, the overall findings indicate that antibody deficiency syndromes and ABPA should be investigated in all newly presenting patients with bronchiectasis (see appendix 5).\n\nTests for specific disease groups with associated bronchiectasis\n\nAllergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis\n\nData suggests that this is a common cause of bronchiectasis in the UK, between 1% and 11% in UK series.23 62 63 68 69\n\nThe diagnostic criteria for ABPA are well established for asthma and have been modified for cystic fibrosis.70 They include a history of asthma, evidence of Aspergillus fumigatus (A. fumigatus) IgE sensitisation on blood and/or skin tests, elevated total IgE levels and eosinophil counts, detection of Aspergillus precipitins or IgG, isolation of A. fumigatus in sputum cultures, presence of pulmonary infiltrates on chest x rays and distribution of bronchiectasis on CT chest scans.71–73 The presence of high attenuation mucus on CT scan may be useful in diagnosis and in staging the severity of ABPA.74 ABPA is an aetiology for bronchiectasis, and may be a complicating factor in established disease. Inconsistent diagnostic criteria have been used in the previously cited studies of aetiology of bronchiectasis.23 62–65 75 76 There are no studies in patients presenting with bronchiectasis that can help to establish the optimal number of investigations and the most important criteria for a diagnosis of ABPA in this context; criteria for asthma are generally used.\n\nSensitisation to A. fumigatus can be detected using blood specific IgE or skin tests however there is limited evidence on which method is best. Intradermal skin tests are more sensitive than standard skin prick to detect Aspergillus-specific IgE,77 but interpretation can be difficult and they are most used in academic centres with a specialist interest. A recent single centre specialist care study from India which used latent class analysis (the statistical test used to assess diagnostic test performance in conditions without a diagnostic gold standard) showed that detection of Aspergillus-specificIgE in blood was more sensitive than intradermal skin tests for the diagnosis of ABPA.78\n\nDiagnostic criteria for ABPA include positive IgE blood and cutaneous skin test results as there may be a small proportion of patients who have discrepant blood and skin test results.73 Use of blood rather than cutaneous skin test has the advantage that patients on anti-histamines do not need to stop treatment, and quality data on laboratory performance is more widely available than on skin testing. IgE sensitisation to A. fumigatus has been reported in 19% of unselected patients presenting with bronchiectasis using blood tests62 however the optimal concentration required to diagnose ABPA in bronchiectasis cohorts has not been established.23 62 64\n\nSimilarly the use and definition of raised total IgE blood tests in diagnosis of ABPA has been variable in bronchiectasis cohorts.23 62–64 The earliest available total IgE test should be used, as the total IgE concentration declines significantly with remission of ABPA on oral corticosteroids whereas no consistent effects on Aspergillus-specific IgE occur.79 There is no consensus on what value of IgE is required for diagnosis of ABPA. In a single specialist centre study the sensitivity of an IgE concentration more than 1000IU/ml for diagnosis of ABPA in asthmatic patients was 97.5%.78 A normal IgE level in a corticosteroid naïve patient with bronchiectasis means that ABPA is highly unlikely. A combination of testing for Aspergillus-specific IgE and total IgE has been proposed as the most sensitive way to screen for ABPA in patients with asthma, with secondary more specific tests to confirm the diagnosis78; this approach has not been validated in patients with bronchiectasis.\n\nAn eosinophil count above 1.0×109/L is a major criterion for ABPA78 but should be used as a second line test as normal counts do not exclude this disease80 and there is no significant difference in eosinophil counts between patients with A.fumigatus sensitisation and those with ABPA.81 Previous studies in asthmatic patients have all been conducted in a single centre and have relied on manual eosinophil counts which are less accurate than automated diagnostic platforms.78–81\n\nAspergillus-specific IgG antibodies can be found in 70%–90% of patients with ABPA using agar gel immune diffusion technology.82 83 The results of these studies may not be applicable to current epidemiology of A. fumigatus ABPA, as a recent study showed that the diagnostic performance of the Ouchterlony diffusion technique to detect IgG antibodies had declined and Aspergillus precipitins were only seen in 43% of patients with ABPA.78 In addition immunoprecipitation techniques to detect Aspergillus-specific IgG antibodies are not widely available in diagnostic UK laboratories, having been replaced initially by counter immuno-electrophoresis (CIE) initially and more recently by ELISA. Only one study of aetiology in bronchiectasis63 defined criteria for a positive Aspergillus precipitins test result and diagnostic techniques used to determine presence of Aspergillus-specific IgG antibodies were not described by any investigators. A small UK study comparing the diagnostic test of CIE and ELISA in patients with Aspergillus related lung disorders showed that the sensitivity of ELISA (41%–46%) for ABPA was significantly greater than CIE (15%) however lack of relevant disease control group and absence of data of current anti-fungal therapy make it difficult to ascertain the clinical value of Aspergillus-specific IgG detection using current diagnostic techniques.84 Aspergillus precipitins can be raised in other conditions such as aspergilloma and chronic pulmonary aspergillosis and thus the more likely diagnostic role if any for Aspergillus-specific IgG antibodies will be as a second line confirmatory test.\n\nCulture of A. fumigatus from lung secretions is supportive but not diagnostic of ABPA as this fungus can be isolated in a number of other diseases. Rate of positive sputum cultures in historical cases of ABPA ranges from 63%–97%,82 83 however in the only study of aetiology of bronchiectasis in which sputum cultures were part of the standard diagnostic panel, A. fumigatus was only isolated in 9% of cases of ABPA.62 Reasons for lower yields of A. fumigatus in sputum cultures could include exposure to azole therapy and differences in sputum processing and culturing technologies in microbiology laboratory services.85\n\nIn the absence of stronger evidence, all the following criteria based on expert consensus are suggested for steroid naïve patients.\n\nAssociated clinical deterioration (increased cough, wheeze, increased sputum production, worsening lung function, exacerbations)\n\nTotal serum IgE level >500 IU/mL (or ku/L)- precise cut-off is not known.\n\nImmediate cutaneous reaction to Aspergillus (skin prick test weal of >3 mm in diameter with surrounding erythema, patient not on systemic antihistamines at the time).\n\nIncreased Aspergillus species specific IgE antibodies\n\nNew radiological infiltrates and/or high attenuation mucus plugging. In later stages, proximal bronchiectasis develops.\n\nSupportive findings include peripheral blood eosinophilia, and Aspergillus precipitins.\n\nImmune dysfunction\n\nImmune deficiency occurred in 5.8% of patients in a multi-centre cross sectional European study63 and in 5% of patients in a large systematic review of aetiological studies.67 In adults, almost all cases of immune deficiency are likely to involve defects in antibody production. Recognition of significant antibody syndromes such as common variable immune deficiency (CVID) is important as immunoglobulin replacement therapy can reduce exacerbation frequency and improve clinical outcomes.86 In recent years there has been increasing recognition that treatment for haematological malignancies is associated with increased risk of antibody deficiency syndromes and bronchiectasis65 which may respond well to immunoglobulin replacement.87\n\nSerum immunoglobulins (IgG, IgA, & IgM) and electrophoresis\n\nA polyclonal rise in serum IgG and IgA is commonly seen in patients with bronchiectasis and reflects chronic infection and inflammation.64 There are no studies addressing the clinical utility of serum electrophoresis in the investigation of bronchiectasis, but this test is essential to determine whether raised serum immunoglobulins are polyclonal or monoclonal. The presence of a monoclonal immunoglobulin in serum needs further investigation to diagnose myeloma, Waldenstrom’s macroglobulinaema, chronic lymphatic leukaemia and monoclonal gammopathy of uncertain significance (MGUS). The prevalence of MGUS is 3.2% in individuals over the age of 50 with increased rates in males, older age and African Americans.88 B cell lymphoproliferative disorder and MGUS are associated with increased rates of bacterial chest infections89 and patients need appropriate follow-up to monitor for haematological malignancy. Antibody deficiency secondary to B cell lymphoproliferative disorders has been found in a number of studies examining aetiology of bronchiectasis,23 65 although the presence or absence of immunoglobulin monoclonal proteins was not stated.\n\nIsolated reduction in IgG, IgA and IgM is not uncommon62 64 76 90 and will usually require further evaluation to assess clinical significance in management of bronchiectasis. Minor reduction in IgG and IgM can be secondary to steroid therapy, B cell lymphoproliferative disease or unclassified antibody deficiency syndromes, which may require further specialised investigation (assessment of vaccine responses, lymphocyte immune phenotyping and enumeration of lymphocyte subsets) and/or involvement of other medical specialists to manage relevant co-morbidity.\n\nFull blood count (FBC)\n\nThere are no studies examining the clinical utility of FBC in determining the cause of bronchiectasis but an abnormal profile may give important diagnostic clues. Persistent low neutrophil and lymphocyte counts in patients with stable disease may suggest an underlying secondary or primary immune deficiency. Lymphocytosis can be a marker of B cell lymphoproliferative disease and a raised eosinophil count may support a diagnosis of ABPA. Reduced platelet count can be a feature of primary and secondary immune deficiencies whereas thrombocytosis is associated with active RA and IBD.\n\nMeasurement of baseline specific antibody levels against capsular polysaccharides of Streptococcus pneumoniae\n\nMeasurement of functional antibody responses to T cell dependent protein or glycoprotein antigens and T cell independent polysaccharide antigens is an essential criterion for diagnosis of primary antibody deficiency syndromes including CVID and specific polysaccharide antibody deficiency (SAD).91 92 Assessment of functional antibody responses is also indicated to assess clinical significance of partial/total IgA deficiency, isolated reductions in IgG and IgM, reduced IgG and IgM and reduced immunoglobulin isotypes in patients with B cell lymphoproliferative disorders. In clinical practice, analysis of T cell independent antigen response is usually assessed by measurement of pneumococcal antibodies, which is also clinically relevant in patients with bronchiectasis.\n\nThe initial step to investigate functional antibody response is to measure pneumococcal antibody levels, and if low, to immunise with 23 valent carbohydrate Pneumococcal vaccine and check post vaccine level 4–8 weeks later. Antibody levels below protective threshold are deemed to be indicative of impaired vaccine responses and functional antibody deficiency.\n\nThe proportion of unselected bronchiectasis patients with reduced levels of pneumococcal antibodies varies between 2%–21%.23 62–64 Differences in reported studies may relate to study setting, differences in pneumococcal antibody assays, or the pneumococcal antibody level at which test immunisation was considered. Some studies reporting pneumococcal antibody levels in unselected patients with bronchiectasis63–66 do not distinguish between the need to assess the functional significance of reduced serum immunoglobulins in patients with bronchiectasis and the use of this test solely to screen for patients with SAD.\n\nThe optimal pneumococcal level at which test immunisation should be considered varies: criteria for test immunisation have included patients with baseline pneumococcal antibody levels in the lowest fifth centile23 or 25th centile62 for healthy controls. Studies using in-house assays to measure total IgG response to pneumococcal immunisation have reported the largest number of patients with low pneumococcal antibody and reduced pneumococcal vaccine responses.62 93 Pneumococcal in-house assays have largely been replaced by commercial assays which may not give equivalent results, resulting in the need to define pneumococcal antibody reference intervals and decision points at which pneumococcal test immunisation is offered. There is currently a move towards serotype based assays of individual pneumococcal serotypes, usually 12–14 in total92 94 95 ; only a limited number of laboratories offer this test in the UK. In addition there is only moderate agreement between quoted protective levels based on gold standard ELISA and newer multiplex bead array diagnostic platforms and disagreement concerning use of protective antibody levels (invasive disease as opposed to mucosal infection).\n\nUse of protein conjugate pneumococcal vaccine in childhood may alter dynamics of polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccination in adults.91 Bronchiectasis clinics and immunology laboratories need to have data on distribution of either total and/or individual serotype pneumococcal IgG levels in age- matched healthy controls and local agreement on the decision point used in pneumococcal antibody tests as to when patients with bronchiectasis are offered 23 valent polysaccharide vaccine test immunisation.\n\nReduced pneumococcal vaccine responses are part of the diagnostic criteria for a number of primary antibody deficiencies95 and have important implications for the use of immunoglobulin replacement therapy in patients with bronchiectasis with primary and secondary antibody deficiencies. There are no uniform criteria as to what constitutes a protective threshold antibody for total IgG pneumococcal (23 valent carbohydrate Pneumococcal vaccine) levels, however a post vaccine pneumococcal serotype concentration greater than 1.3 ug/mL is believed to offer protection against strain specific invasive pneumococcal disease.96 Expert opinion suggests that failure to generate a protective titre (1.3microG/microL) to more than 70% serotypes post polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccination is indicative of moderate to severe functional antibody deficiency.92 These criteria have not been validated in clinical trials and it has been argued they may overestimate the number of patients with functional antibody deficiency.\n\nThe rate of impaired post pneumococcal test immunisation responses in patients with bronchiectasis has varied from 0%–20%,23 62–65 93 with the main sources of variation being the nature of the patient cohort, different methodology in assessing the response, and variations in the definition of low baseline levels and a normal response. Criteria used to define adequate pneumococcal vaccine responses have included results obtained from post vaccine serology from healthy controls,93 use of historical reference data62 or expert opinion,65 however a number of studies have not reported their criteria to select patients for test immunisation, the test methodology and the definition of normal pneumococcal vaccine response.23 64 66\n\nInterpretation of pneumococcal test immunisation results needs to take into account history of recent infections, previous vaccinations, use of immunosuppressive and cytotoxic chemotherapy and the finding that impaired pneumococcal test immunisation responses can be seen in up to 10% of healthy individuals. The increasing use of pneumococcal serotype assays for which there is no data for clinical utility in patients with bronchiectasis and limited agreement on what constitutes an adequate immune response91 suggest that there needs to be appropriate liaison between bronchiectasis clinics and diagnostic immunology services as to which patients should be offered test immunisation, what technology is used to measure pneumococcal antibodies, and what criteria are used to define a normal vaccine response.\n\nInterpretation can be challenging and thus it is advised the results are discussed with an immunologist, as there has not been universal agreement about the degree of vaccine response to define specific antibody deficiency. If there is no local access to an immunologist, suggest discussion with a specialist bronchiectasis service that has an immunologist as part of the multi-disciplinary team.\n\nMore specialised immunological investigations are described in the appendix; these would usually be carried out by immunologists or in close liaison with immunology services (see appendix 4).\n\nAppendix 4\n\nRheumatoid arthritis\n\nRheumatoid arthritis is the aetiology for a small proportion of patients referred to secondary care with bronchiectasis (2%–5%23 62 64). Given the strong association between rheumatoid arthritis and bronchiectasis, auto-antibodies such as rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibodies have been considered as aetiological tests. Presence of circulating RF in patients was shown to be more prevalent in patients with bronchiectasis compared with healthy controls in a prospective multi-centre case-control observational study.97 However anti-CCP antibodies were strongly positive in only 12% (4 patients) of those who were RF-positive. Two of those four patients subsequently developed rheumatoid arthritis in a 12 month follow-up period.\n\nRecurrent aspiration\n\nRecurrent aspiration due to dysphagia or gastro-oesophageal reflux is recognised to cause bronchiectasis, with a reported prevalence (based on the presence of symptoms) of between 1% and 11.3% in adults23 62 64 65 76 and a higher rate in a paediatric cohort attending a specialist referral centre.75 However, gastro-oesophageal reflux is common (and therefore can be mistakenly attributed as a causal factor), and can be asymptomatic (and therefore not considered). Limited case series are suggestive of a role for surgical management of reflux disease.98 99 Dysphagia can be caused by neurological disorders, oesophageal dysmotility and anatomical disorders (trachea-oesophageal fistula, previous surgery, pharyngeal pouch, late effects of head and neck radiotherapy). The likelihood of aspiration may be increased by vocal cord dysfunction. A careful gastrointestinal history focussing on symptoms of reflux and dysphagia should therefore be undertaken.\n\nA number of different investigative modalities are available and include videofluoroscopic swallow study, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, ambulatory oesophageal manometry and pH studies and flexible endoscopic evaluation of swallow. The sensitivity and specificity of these tests when used to assess aspiration in bronchiectatic patients have not been investigated. The method of evaluation should therefore be tailored according to clinical features.\n\nCystic fibrosis\n\nCystic fibrosis (CF) bronchiectasis is managed as a distinct clinical entity. Routine newborn screening for CF has been standard in the UK since 2007, but the disease may still present in later life and should be considered as a possible aetiology. CF is mainly seen in Caucasian populations and is rare in Asian populations.100 101 Clinical features supportive of CF include an early onset, history of malabsorption, male infertility and childhood steatorrhoea. Radiologically, upper lobe bronchiectasis predominates and there is frequently a history of Staphylococcus aureus on sputum culture.\n\nStandard investigative methods for CF include the sodium chloride sweat test and CFTR mutation analysis. There are established guidelines for the sweat test which should measure chloride concentration on two occasions. A negative test has <30 mmol/L chloride, a borderline test 30–60 mmol/L and a positive test >60 mmol/L.102 103\n\nThe CFTR gene is located on chromosome seven and to date >2000 CFTR mutations have been identified (www.genet.sickkids.on.ca). It has been demonstrated that the greater the number of mutations screened, the greater the number of patients with CF will be identified.104 Advice from the local clinical genetics department should be sought. Ancillary tests such as nasal potential difference and assessments of pancreatic exocrine function offer additional evidence only and are not diagnostic in themselves. Their use should be limited to within specialist CF centres.\n\nThe incidence of CF as a cause in adults presenting with bronchiectasis ranges from 0.6%–2.7% (see online appendix 6).\n\nFor recommendations for the diagnosis and management of CF refer to the NICE CF Guidelines.105\n\nCiliary dysfunction\n\nPrimary Ciliary Dyskinesia\n\nPrimary ciliary dyskinesia is usually an autosomal recessive disorder causing ultrastructural defects in the cilia affecting normal motility. It is characterised by upper and lower respiratory tract infections, chronic sinopulmonary infection, development of bronchiectasis and loss of lung function. Male infertility is common and situs inversus may be present. Kartagener’s syndrome describes the classic triad of situs inversus, bronchiectasis and chronic sinusitis due to a congenital reduction or absence of ciliary function.\n\nPCD is typically diagnosed in the paediatric population. The incidence of PCD as a cause of bronchiectasis in adults ranges from 0.9%–10.3% (see online appendix 6). Investigative methods that have been used are either screening tests including measurement of nasal nitric oxide (nNO) and the saccharin taste test, or diagnostic tests assessing ciliary structure and function. The saccharin taste test is no longer recommended in the investigative process for PCD.106 nNO levels are abnormally low in PCD.107–109 A large prospective study found the positive predictive value (PPV) of nNO (using a cut-off value of <30 nL/min) for a diagnosis of PCD to be 0.76 (CI 0.6 to 0.88) and the negative predictive value (NPV) 0.99(CI0.97–1.00) with a sensitivity of 91% and specificity of 96%.110 In a separate study, the PPV of nNO was 87% and NPV 97% in discriminating between PCD and non PCD bronchiectasis.111\n\nNasal brushing is a simple, minimally invasive method to obtain ciliated epithelium. Analysis of ciliary beat frequency and pattern is usually undertaken using high speed video microscopy analysis (HSVMA). Normal ciliary beat frequency (11–20 Hz) and ciliary beat pattern is a qualitative assessment. The PPV of HSVMA for a diagnosis of PCD has been shown to be 0.61 (CI 0.5 to 0.7) and NPV 1.0 (CI 0.99 to 1.00) in a major UK centre’s referral population, with a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 93%.110 Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to assess ciliary ultrastructure has been shown to have a PPV of 1.00 (CI0.94–1.00) and a NPV of 0.95 (CI 0.92 to 0.97) with a sensitivity of 79% and specificity of 100%.110 Both HSVMA and TEM are excellent diagnostic tools but require expertise and specialist review. Further information is given in the ERS guidelines for the diagnosis of PCD.106\n\n(Diagnostic centres for PCD testing in the UK are located in London (http://www.rbht.nhs.uk/patients/condition/primary-ciliary-dyskinesia/) Leicester (http://www.leicestershospitals.nhs.uk/), and Southampton (http://www.uhs.nhs.uk/OurServices/Childhealth/Primary-ciliary-dyskinesia/PCD-diagnostic-service.aspx).\n\nYoung’s syndrome\n\nThe combination of primary azoospermia, chronic rhinosinusitis and bronchiectasis was first briefly described in 1970 as the Berry-Perkins-Young Syndrome.112 Further studies suggested that this consisted of a specific form of obstructive azoospermia while the airway features included poor mucociliary clearance. Crossover with cystic fibrosis was ruled out113 and in general no specific ciliary beat frequency or ciliary ultrastructural abnormalities were identified,114 although a more detailed study in 1992 did find some minor abnormalities of ciliary function.115 It was proposed that Young’s syndrome was caused by childhood mercury exposure (also responsible for Pink disease (acrodynia) which is a recognised aetiology of bronchiectasis for some UK patients) on the grounds that the specific type of obstructive azoospermia reported in Young’s syndrome is becoming less common and epidemiologically this fits with the withdrawal of mercury-containing products such as teething powders in the UK and Australia.116 The role of Young’s syndrome in the aetiology of bronchiectasis may perhaps become of historical interest only.\n\nAlpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency\n\nPiZZ A1AT deficiency has been found in <1% of patients presenting with bronchiectasis.62 Insufficient information is given in aetiological studies to guide which bronchiectasis patients to investigate for A1AT deficiency.\n\nCongenital causes\n\nCongenital abnormalities causing bronchiectasis and presenting in adults are rare. Such congenital abnormalities may include Williams Campbell syndrome (bronchomalacia), Mounier Kuhn syndrome (tracheobronchomegaly) and lung sequestration.\n\nThe diagnosis of both Williams Campbell and Mounier Kuhn syndromes are made based on characteristic features on CT scanning of the chest.117 118 The data describing the incidence of these syndromes presenting in adulthood is limited to case reports or series.\n\nInvestigations of lung microbiology\n\nThe main role of sputum culture is to help guide the use of antibiotics both for treatment of acute exacerbations and for chronic suppressive therapy. In addition the detection of some micro-organisms may also help in identifying an underlying aetiology. For example isolation of environmental mycobacteria should prompt further investigations for the presence of non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) pulmonary disease; finding Staphylococcus aureus might indicate the presence of cystic fibrosis; isolation of A. fumigatus may prompt investigations for ABPA.\n\nThere has not been a systematic analysis of the role of bronchoscopy in the diagnosis and management of bronchiectasis. However, it should be considered in those patients who do not expectorate especially in the context of infective change seen on CT. It may be particularly helpful in the diagnosis of NTM pulmonary disease. See appendix 7 for studies of lower respiratory tract micro-organisms.\n\nAppendix 7\n\nEvidence statements\n\nIt is sometimes possible to define an aetiological cause for bronchiectasis which directly alters management through the use of a standard panel of investigations. (2++)\n\nAllergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) occurs in 4% (range 1%–8%) of patients with bronchiectasis. (2+)\n\nA diagnosis of ABPA is supported by total IgE >500 IU/mL (ku/L) and either positive Aspergillus-specific IgE or immediate reaction on skin prick testing. (4)\n\nAntibody deficiency syndromes are found in 7% (range 2%–17%) of patients with bronchiectasis. (2+)\n\nCystic fibrosis is diagnosed in 3%–4% of adult patients with bronchiectasis. (1+)\n\nPrimary ciliary dyskinesia is diagnosed in the majority of studies in ≤5% of adult patients with bronchiectasis. (1+)\n\nThere is little evidence to support routine testing for autoimmune disease or alpha one antitrypsin deficiency in the absence of suggestive clinical features. (2++)\n\nSerum rheumatoid factor is frequently positive in patients with bronchiectasis (2+) but the clinical significance of this is uncertain.\n\nAspiration is often associated with bronchiectasis (2+) and may be causally related. (4)\n\nRecommendations (see table 1)\n\nA panel of investigations should be performed to establish the underlying cause of bronchiectasis. (B)\n\nCo-morbidities and past medical history should be recorded in patients diagnosed with bronchiectasis to identify relevant and possibly causative disease such as rheumatoid arthritis, COPD, asthma, gastro-oesophageal reflux disease and inflammatory bowel disease. (C)\n\nMeasure full blood count, serum total IgE and assessment of sensitisation (specific IgE or skin prick test) to A. fumigatus in all patients with bronchiectasis. (D)\n\nSerum IgG, IgA and IgM should be performed in all patients with bronchiectasis. (C)\n\nConsider measuring baseline specific antibody levels against capsular polysaccharides of S. pneumoniae in all patients to investigate for specific antibody deficiency. If pneumococcal antibodies are low, immunise with 23 valent polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccine, followed by measurement of specific antibody levels 4–8 weeks later.(D).\n\nTest for cystic fibrosis (according to NICE Guidelines for CF) in patients with supporting clinical features, for example, early onset, male infertility, malabsorption, pancreatitis. (B)\n\nTest for PCD (according to ERS Guidelines for PCD Diagnosis) in patients with supporting clinical features, including a history of neonatal distress, symptoms from childhood, recurrent otitis media, rhinosinusitis, or infertility. (A)\n\nSputum cultures should be performed in all patients with bronchiectasis for routine and mycobacterial culture. (D)\n\nGood practice points\n\nA previous diagnosis of idiopathic bronchiectasis should prompt careful reinvestigation for a primary cause in the context of a deteriorating clinical course or a young patient (usually considered to be age 50 and under but not limited to this age group).\n\nReferral to a specialist centre for investigation should be considered for young patients (usually considered to be age 50 and under but not limited to this age group) and those with apparent idiopathic bronchiectasis especially where there is evidence of progressive disease.\n\nConsider testing for RF, anti CCP, ANA and ANCA in patients with coexisting clinical features of arthritis, connective tissue disease and/or systemic vasculitis.\n\nConsider testing for A1AT deficiency in patients with coexisting basal panacinar emphysema.\n\nInvestigations for reflux and aspiration should be undertaken only in symptomatic patients, or where there are other suggestive clinical features.\n\nConsider bronchoscopy for patients with localised disease to rule out an endobronchial lesion or foreign body as the cause of bronchiectasis.\n\nA bronchial aspiration or bronchial wash targeting the areas of bronchiectasis from CT scan of the chest should be considered in patients who do not expectorate and can be particularly helpful in the diagnosis of NTM pulmonary disease.\n\nSerum protein electrophoresis should be performed in all patients with bronchiectasis with raised immunoglobulins.\n\nConsider HIV-1 serology in patient with bronchiectasis depending on prevalence of HIV-1 and clinical features suggestive of increased risk of retroviral infection.\n\nResearch recommendations\n\nConsensus criteria for diagnosis of ABPA need to be validated in bronchiectasis cohorts.\n\nConsensus criteria for definition of abnormal post pneumococcal test immunisation antibody responses need to be validated in bronchiectasis cohorts.\n\nSection 7\n\nPrognosis: what is the outlook for these patients?\n\nA UK epidemiology study examined mortality and noted the age adjusted mortality rate for women with bronchiectasis to be 1438 per 1 00 000 against 636 for the general population (comparative mortality of 2.26) and, in men, the age adjusted mortality rate for bronchiectasis population was 1915 per 1 00 000 compared with 895 for the general population (comparative mortality of 2.14).4\n\nA comprehensive assessment by Martinez-Garcia et al119 2014 in Spanish patients comparable to the UK population introduced the mortality prediction score (FACED), based on a study showing that of 154 deaths during follow-up, 42.9% were attributed to respiratory disease with 9.1% due to neoplasia and 9.1% to cardiovascular disease.119 Similarly the Bronchiectasis Severity Index (BSI) tool was based on studies of outcome in patients with bronchiectasis across several different centres, and the study reported a mortality rate of 62 (10.2%), directly relevant to bronchiectasis in 32 cases (listed as exacerbation of bronchiectasis, end-stage bronchiectasis, pneumonia, LRTI, chronic respiratory failure or pneumothorax).120 Otherwise, myocardial infarction was the cause of death in 12 cases, malignancy in eight cases, and other causes included heart failure, stroke, other sepsis, pulmonary embolism, trauma, alcoholic liver disease and post-operative complications.\n\nSection 8\n\nSeverity scoring\n\nThe availability of the two clinical scoring systems, the Bronchiectasis Severity Index (BSI) (table 4)120 and FACED119 (see tables 4 and 5), has increased our ability to predict future mortality in patients with bronchiectasis. The BSI additionally provides information on morbidity, hospital admissions and exacerbations. As bronchiectasis is not a rapidly fatal condition, these latter outcomes are regarded as more important for clinical decision making. Reassuringly, being derived in different cohorts, the two scores include similar variables. The major limitation of the FACED score is the absence of exacerbations which are regarded by many clinicians as the most important modifiable marker of severity. Prior exacerbations are also the strongest predictor of future exacerbations which explains why a number of studies have found FACED to be poorly predictive of future morbidity.121–123 For this reason the BSI is the preferred scoring system. At the time of writing, modifications of the FACED score to include exacerbations are undergoing evaluation. There may be some relevant omissions from both scores, notably the presence of co-morbidities which are important in the prognosis of other chronic respiratory diseases.\n\nFACED includes FEV1, Age, P. aeruginosa colonisation, Extent of bronchiectasis (counting lobar involvement on CT) and Dyspnoea (using the modified MRC scale). All the variables are dichotomised and scored 0 vs 1 or 2. The 5 year mortality in mild, moderate and severe disease (defined as a score of 0–2, 3–4 and 5–7 points respectively) is 4%, 25% and 56% respectively. It has been shown to predict 5 year mortality, although the study used the score calculated at the time of initial diagnosis (and is not, therefore, designed for follow-up of existing patients, an important limitation) and it is not known whether a change in score reflects a change in prognosis.\n\nThe BSI combines age, body mass index, FEV1, previous hospitalisation, exacerbation frequency, colonisation status and radiological appearances. The score was designed to predict future exacerbations and hospitalisations, health-status, and death over 4 years. Patients with NTM were excluded. Data were provided which examine how the score performed in annual prediction of events, a more relevant clinical scenario than provided for FACED, and the team have developed a useful online calculator (available at www.bronchiectasisseverity.com). A score of 0–4 (mild) is associated with 0%–2.8% mortality and 0%–3.4% hospitalisation rate over 1 year, and 0%–5.3% mortality and 0%–9.2% hospitalisation rate over 4 years.\n\nOutcomes in moderate bronchiectasis (score 5–8) were 0.8%–4.8% mortality and 1.0%–7.2% hospitalisation rate at 1 year and 4%–11.3% mortality and 9.9%–19.4% hospitalisation rate at 4 years. A score over 9 (severe bronchiectasis) was associated with 1 year 7.6%–10.5% mortality, and 16.7%–52.6% hospitalisation rate and a 4 year 9.9%–29.2% mortality and 41.2%–80.4% hospitalisation rates. Understanding the factors associated with future morbidity and mortality in bronchiectasis provides a rationale, discussed further elsewhere, for which variables should be assessed and monitored in bronchiectasis.\n\nGood practice point\n\nConsider using the bronchiectasis severity index which may help guide management.\n\nSection 9\n\nStable state treatment\n\nAirway clearance techniques\n\nRespiratory physiotherapy aims to mobilise secretions and aid effective expectoration, improving airway clearance and providing some control of cough.124 The other aims of respiratory physiotherapy include improving efficiency of ventilation, maintaining or improving exercise tolerance, improving knowledge and understanding, and reducing breathlessness and (thoracic) pain.125 The physiotherapist can discuss step up and step down airways clearance techniques in managing exacerbations. In addition, the respiratory physiotherapist can assist patients who require management of continence issues and musculoskeletal dysfunction.126 In this way, a physiotherapist aims to optimise a patient’s physical function.\n\nWhich patients should be taught airway clearance techniques?\n\nA single randomised crossover trial has been published which assesses the efficacy of regular respiratory physiotherapy versus no respiratory physiotherapy in participants"
