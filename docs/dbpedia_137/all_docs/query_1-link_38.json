        "meta_description": "Abstract. Continental- to global-scale hydrologic and land surface models increasingly include representations of the groundwater system. Such large-scale models are essential for examining, communicating, and understanding the dynamic interactions between the Earth system above and below the land surface as well as the opportunities and limits of groundwater resources. We argue that both large-scale and regional-scale groundwater models have utility, strengths, and limitations, so continued modeling at both scales is essential and mutually beneficial. A crucial quest is how to evaluate the realism, capabilities, and performance of large-scale groundwater models given their modeling purpose of addressing large-scale science or sustainability questions as well as limitations in data availability and commensurability. Evaluation should identify if, when, or where large-scale models achieve their purpose or where opportunities for improvements exist so that such models better achieve their purpose. We suggest that reproducing the spatiotemporal details of regional-scale models and matching local data are not relevant goals. Instead, it is important to decide on reasonable model expectations regarding when a large-scale model is performing âwell enoughâ\nin the context of its specific purpose. The decision of reasonable\nexpectations is necessarily subjective even if the evaluation criteria are\nquantitative. Our objective is to provide recommendations for improving the\nevaluation of groundwater representation in continental- to global-scale\nmodels. We describe current modeling strategies and evaluation practices,\nand we subsequently discuss the value of three evaluation strategies: (1)Â comparing model outputs with available observations of groundwater levels or\nother state or flux variables (observation-based evaluation), (2)Â comparing\nseveral models with each other with or without reference to actual\nobservations (model-based evaluation), and (3)Â comparing model behavior with\nexpert expectations of hydrologic behaviors in particular regions or at\nparticular times (expert-based evaluation). Based on evolving practices in\nmodel evaluation as well as innovations in observations, machine learning,\nand expert elicitation, we argue that combining observation-, model-, and\nexpert-based model evaluation approaches, while accounting for\ncommensurability issues, may significantly improve the realism of\ngroundwater representation in large-scale models, thus advancing our ability\nfor quantification, understanding, and prediction of crucial Earth science\nand sustainability problems. We encourage greater community-level\ncommunication and cooperation on this quest, including among global\nhydrology and land surface modelers, local to regional hydrogeologists, and\nhydrologists focused on model development and evaluation.",

This study intended to carry out an exploratory evaluation of this relationship at a large scale. While our results suggest that streamflow and EF may not be the only determinants of freshwater biodiversity at large scales, they do not preclude the existence of relationships at smaller scales or with more holistic EF methods or with other biodiversity data or metrics.\n\nKarst spring recession and classification: efficient, automated methods for both fast- and slow-flow components\n\nTunde Olarinoye, Tom Gleeson, and Andreas Hartmann\n\nHydrol.

In karst, recession is dominated by slow and fast components; separating these components is by manual and subjective approaches. In our study, we tested the applicability of automated streamflow recession extraction procedures for a karst spring. Results showed that, by simple modification, streamflow extraction methods can identify slow and fast components: derived recession parameters are within reasonable ranges.\n\nGlobally widespread and increasing violations of environmental flow envelopes\n\nVili Virkki, Elina AlanÃ¤rÃ¤, Miina Porkka, Lauri Ahopelto, Tom Gleeson, Chinchu Mohan, Lan Wang-Erlandsson, Martina FlÃ¶rke, Dieter Gerten, Simon N.

Here, we apply a method of environmental flow envelopes (EFEs) that develops the existing global environmental flow assessments by methodological advances and better consideration of uncertainty. By assessing the violations of the EFE, we comprehensively quantify the frequency, severity, and trends of flow alteration during the past decades, illustrating anthropogenic effects on streamflow.\n\nHESS Opinions: Improving the evaluation of groundwater representation in continental to global scale models\n\nTom Gleeson, Thorsten Wagener, Petra DÃ¶ll, Samuel C.

Hartmann, T. Gleeson, R. Rosolem, F. Pianosi, Y. Wada, and T. Wagener\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 8, 1729–1746, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-8-1729-2015,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-8-1729-2015, 2015\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe present a new approach to assess karstic groundwater recharge over Europe and the Mediterranean. Cluster analysis is used to subdivide all karst regions into four typical karst landscapes and to simulate karst recharge with a process-based karst model. We estimate its parameters by a combination of a priori information and observations of soil moisture and evapotranspiration. Independent observations of recharge that present large-scale models significantly under-estimate karstic recharge.\n\nTrends in long-term hydrological data from European karst areas: insights for groundwater recharge evaluation\n\nMarkus Giese, Yvan Caballero, Andreas Hartmann, and Jean-Baptiste Charlier\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-2078,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-2078, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nGroundwater recharge and flow processes are difficult to quantify on a larger scale. Therefore, it is difficult to assess groundwater resources, substantially used for fresh water supply, and their changes over time. In karst areas, groundwater drainage networks over large areas are generated due to the soluble rocks. The observation of discharge from springs provides an alternative to estimate changes in groundwater resources over time, which can be connected to changing climatic conditions.\n\nHigh-resolution long-term average groundwater recharge in Africa estimated using random forest regression and residual interpolation\n\nAnna Pazola, Mohammad Shamsudduha, Jon French, Alan M.

Limited data in rainy zones is a constraint for the model. Our findings underscore the promise of machine learning for large-scale groundwater modelling while further emphasizing the importance of data collection for robust results.\n\nCoupling a large-scale glacier and hydrological model (OGGM v1.5.3 and CWatM V1.08) â towards an improved representation of mountain water resources in global assessments\n\nSarah Hanus, Lilian Schuster, Peter Burek, Fabien Maussion, Yoshihide Wada, and Daniel Viviroli\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 17, 5123–5144, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-5123-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-5123-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study presents a coupling of the large-scale glacier model OGGM and the hydrological model CWatM. Projected future increase in discharge is less strong while future decrease in discharge is stronger when glacier runoff is explicitly included in the large-scale hydrological model. This is because glacier runoff is projected to decrease in nearly all basins. We conclude that an improved glacier representation can prevent underestimating future discharge changes in large river basins.\n\nSoftware sustainability of global impact models\n\nEmmanuel Nyenah, Petra DÃ¶ll, Daniel S. Katz, and Robert Reinecke\n\nGeosci. Model Dev. Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-2024-97,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-2024-97, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for GMD\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nResearch software is crucial for scientific progress but is often developed by scientists with limited training, time, and funding, leading to software that is hard to understand, (re)use, modify, and maintain. Our study across 10 research sectors highlights strengths in version control, open-source licensing, and documentation while emphasizing the need for containerization and code quality. Recommendations include workshops, code quality metrics, funding, and adherence to FAIR standards.\n\nLeveraging multi-variable observations to reduce and quantify the output uncertainty of a global hydrological model: evaluation of three ensemble-based approaches for the Mississippi River basin\n\nPetra DÃ¶ll, Howlader Mohammad Mehedi Hasan, Kerstin Schulze, Helena Gerdener, Lara BÃ¶rger, Somayeh Shadkam, Sebastian Ackermann, Seyed-Mohammad Hosseini-Moghari, Hannes MÃ¼ller Schmied, Andreas GÃ¼ntner, and JÃ¼rgen Kusche\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 28, 2259–2295, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-2259-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-2259-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nCurrently, global hydrological models do not benefit from observations of model output variables to reduce and quantify model output uncertainty. For the Mississippi River basin, we explored three approaches for using both streamflow and total water storage anomaly observations to adjust the parameter sets in a global hydrological model. We developed a method for considering the observation uncertainties to quantify the uncertainty of model output and provide recommendations.\n\nQuantifying and communicating uncertain climate change hazards in participatory climate change adaptation processes\n\nLaura MÃ¼ller and Petra DÃ¶ll\n\nGeosci. Commun., 7, 121–144, https://doi.org/10.5194/gc-7-121-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/gc-7-121-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nTo be able to adapt to climate change, stakeholders need to be informed about future uncertain climate change hazards. Using freely available output of global hydrological models, we quantified future local changes in water resources and their uncertainty. To communicate these in participatory processes, we propose using \"percentile boxes\" to support the development of flexible strategies for climate risk management worldwide, involving stakeholders and scientists.\n\nEvaluation of reanalysis soil moisture products using cosmic ray neutron sensor observations across the globe\n\nYanchen Zheng, Gemma Coxon, Ross Woods, Daniel Power, Miguel Angel Rico-Ramirez, David McJannet, Rafael Rosolem, Jianzhu Li, and Ping Feng\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 28, 1999–2022, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-1999-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-1999-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nReanalysis soil moisture products are a vital basis for hydrological and environmental research. Previous product evaluation is limited by the scale difference (point and grid scale). This paper adopts cosmic ray neutron sensor observations, a novel technique that provides root-zone soil moisture at field scale. In this paper, global harmonized CRNS observations were used to assess products. ERA5-Land, SMAPL4, CFSv2, CRA40 and GLEAM show better performance than MERRA2, GLDAS-Noah and JRA55.\n\nMapping groundwater dependent ecosystems using a high-resolution global groundwater model\n\nNicole Gyakowah Otoo, Edwin H. Sutanudjaja, Michelle T. H. van Vliet, Aafke M. Schipper, and Marc F. P. Bierkens\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci. Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2024-112,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2024-112, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for HESS\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe contribution of groundwater to groundwater dependent ecosystems (GDEs) is declining as a result of an increase in groundwater abstractions and climate change. This may lead to loss of habitat and biodiversity. This proposed framework enables the mapping and understanding of the temporal and spatial dynamics of GDEs on a large scale. The next step is to assess the global impacts of climate change and water use on GDEs' extent and health.\n\nA first attempt to model global hydrology at hyper-resolution\n\nBarry van Jaarsveld, Niko Wanders, Edwin H. Sutanudjaja, Jannis Hoch, Bram Droppers, Joren Janzing, Rens L. P. H. van Beek, and Marc F. P. Bierkens\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1025,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1025, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nPolicy makers use global hydrological models to develop water management strategies and policies. However, if these models provided information at higher resolutions that would be better. We present a first of its kind, truly global hyper-resolution model and show that hyper-resolution brings about better estimates of river discharge and this is especially true for smaller catchments. Our results also suggest future hyper-resolution model need to include more detailed landcover information.\n\nA scalable and modular reservoir implementation for large scale integrated hydrologic simulations\n\nBenjamin D. West, Reed M. Maxwell, and Laura E. Condon\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-965,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-965, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis article describes the addition of reservoirs to the hydrologic model, ParFlow. ParFlow is particularly good at helping us understand some of the broader drivers behind different parts of the water cycle. By having reservoirs in such a model we hope to be better able to understand both our impacts on the environment, and how to adjust our management of reservoirs to changing conditions.\n\nBenchmarking multimodel terrestrial water storage seasonal cycle against Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) observations over major global river basins\n\nSadia Bibi, Tingju Zhu, Ashraf Rateb, Bridget R. Scanlon, Muhammad Aqeel Kamran, Abdelrazek Elnashar, Ali Bennour, and Ci Li\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 28, 1725–1750, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-1725-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-1725-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe assessed 13 global models using GRACE satellite data over 29 river basins. Simulated seasonal water storage cycles showed discrepancies compared to GRACE. The models overestimated seasonal amplitude in boreal basins and showed underestimation in tropical, arid, and temperate zones, with phase differences of 2–3 months compared to GRACE in cold basins and of 1 month in temperate, arid, and semi-arid basins. Seasonal amplitude and phase differences provide insights for model improvement.\n\nBridging the gap: a new module for human water use in the Community Earth System Model version 2.2.1\n\nSabin I. Taranu, David M. Lawrence, Yoshihide Wada, Ting Tang, Erik Kluzek, Sam Rabin, Yi Yao, Steven J. De Hertog, Inne Vanderkelen, and Wim Thiery\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-362,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-362, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this study, we improve an existing climate model to account for human water usage across domestic, industrial, and agriculture purposes. With the new capabilities, the model is now better equipped for studying questions related to water scarcity in both present and future conditions under climate change. Despite the advancements, there remains important limitations in our modelling framework which requires further work.\n\nMulti-objective calibration and evaluation of the ORCHIDEE land surface model over France at high resolution\n\nPeng Huang, AgnÃ¨s Ducharne, Lucia Rinchiuso, Jan Polcher, Laure Baratgin, Vladislav Bastrikov, and Eric Sauquet\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-445,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-445, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe conducted a high-resolution hydrological simulation from 1959 to 2020 across France. We used a simple trial-and-error calibration to reduce the biases of the simulated water budget compared to observations. The selected simulation satisfactorily reproduces water fluxes, including their spatial contrasts and temporal trends. This work offers a thorough historical overview of water resources and a robust configuration for climate change impact analysis at the nationwide scale of France.\n\nApplying double-cropping and interactive irrigation in the North China Plain using WRF4.5\n\nYuwen Fan, Zhao Yang, Min-Hui Lo, Jina Hur, and Eun-Soon Im\n\nGeosci. Model Dev. Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-2024-38,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-2024-38, 2024\n\nRevised manuscript accepted for GMD\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIrrigated agriculture in the North China Plain (NCP) has a significant impact on the local climate. To better understand this impact, we developed a specialized model specifically for the NCP region. This model allows us to simulate the double-cropping vegetation and the dynamic irrigation practices that are commonly employed in the NCP. This model shows improved performance in capturing the general crop growth, such as crop stages, biomass, crop yield, and vegetation greenness.\n\nValidation of a new global irrigation scheme in the land surface model ORCHIDEE v2.2\n\nPedro Felipe Arboleda-Obando, AgnÃ¨s Ducharne, Zun Yin, and Philippe Ciais\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 17, 2141–2164, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-2141-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-2141-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe show a new irrigation scheme included in the ORCHIDEE land surface model. The new irrigation scheme restrains irrigation due to water shortage, includes water adduction, and represents environmental limits and facilities to access water, due to representing infrastructure in a simple way. Our results show that the new irrigation scheme helps simulate acceptable land surface conditions and fluxes in irrigated areas, even if there are difficulties due to shortcomings and limited information.\n\nRelevance of feedbacks between water availability and crop systems using a coupled hydrology – crop growth model\n\nSneha Chevuru, Rens L. P. H. van Beek, Michelle T. H. van Vliet, Jerom P. M. Aerts, and Marc F. P. Bierkens\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-465,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-465, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper integrates PCR-GLOBWB 2 hydrological model with WOFOST crop growth model to analyze mutual feedbacks between hydrology and crop growth. It quantifies one-way and two-way feedbacks between hydrology and crop growth, revealing patterns in crop yield and irrigation water use. Dynamic interactions enhance understanding of climate variability impacts on food production, highlighting the importance of two-way model coupling for accurate assessments.\n\nSynthesis of historical reservoir operations from 1980 to 2020 for the evaluation of reservoir representation in large-scale hydrologic models\n\nJennie C. Steyaert and Laura E. Condon\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 28, 1071–1088, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-1071-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-1071-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nReservoirs impact all river systems in the United States, yet their operations are difficult to quantify due to limited data. Using historical reservoir operations, we find that storage has declined over the past 40 years, with clear regional differences. We observe that active storage ranges are increasing in arid regions and decreasing in humid regions. By evaluating reservoir model assumptions, we find that they may miss out on seasonal dynamics and can underestimate storage.\n\nToward interpretable LSTM-based modeling of hydrological systems\n\nLuis Andres De la Fuente, Mohammad Reza Ehsani, Hoshin Vijai Gupta, and Laura Elizabeth Condon\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 28, 945–971, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-945-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-945-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nLong short-term memory (LSTM) is a widely used machine-learning model in hydrology, but it is difficult to extract knowledge from it. We propose HydroLSTM, which represents processes like a hydrological reservoir. Models based on HydroLSTM perform similarly to LSTM while requiring fewer cell states. The learned parameters are informative about the dominant hydrology of a catchment. Our results show how parsimony and hydrological knowledge extraction can be achieved by using the new structure.\n\nCanopy structure modulates the sensitivity of subalpine forest stands to interannual snowpack and precipitation variability\n\nMax Berkelhammer, Gerald F.

H. Carroll, Austin Simonpietri, Marshall Worsham, Ian Breckheimer, Anna Ryken, Reed Maxwell, David Gochis, Mark Raleigh, Eric Small, and Kenneth H. Williams\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-3063,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-3063, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWarming in montane systems is affecting the amount of snowmelt inputs. This will affect subalpine forests globally that rely on spring snowmelt to support their water demands. We use a network of sensors across in the Upper Colorado Basin to show that changing spring primarily impacts dense forest stands that have high peak water demands. On the other hand, open forest stands show a higher reliance on summer rain and were minimally sensitive to even historically low snow conditions like 2019.\n\nOn the predictability of turbulent fluxes from land: PLUMBER2 MIP experimental description and preliminary results\n\nGab Abramowitz, Anna Ukkola, Sanaa Hobeichi, Jon Cranko Page, Mathew Lipson, Martin De Kauwe, Sam Green, Claire Brenner, Jonathan Frame, Grey Nearing, Martyn Clark, Martin Best, Peter Anthoni, Gabriele Arduini, Souhail Boussetta, Silvia Caldararu, Kyeungwoo Cho, Matthias Cuntz, David Fairbairn, Craig Ferguson, Hyungjun Kim, Yeonjoo Kim, JÃ¼rgen Knauer, David Lawrence, Xiangzhong Luo, Sergey Malyshev, Tomoko Nitta, Jerome Ogee, Keith Oleson, Catherine OttlÃ©, Phillipe Peylin, Patricia de Rosnay, Heather Rumbold, Bob Su, Nicolas Vuichard, Anthony Walker, Xiaoni Wang-Faivre, Yunfei Wang, and Yijian Zeng\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-3084,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-3084, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper evaluates land models – computer based models that simulate ecosystem dynamics, the land carbon, water and energy cycles and the role of land in the climate system. It uses machine learning / AI approaches to show that despite the complexity of land models, they do not perform nearly as well as they could, given the amount of information they are provided with about the prediction problem.\n\nGLOBGM v1.0: a parallel implementation of a 30 arcsec PCR-GLOBWB-MODFLOW global-scale groundwater model\n\nJarno Verkaik, Edwin H. Sutanudjaja, Gualbert H. P. Oude Essink, Hai Xiang Lin, and Marc F. P. Bierkens\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 17, 275–300, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-275-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-275-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper presents the parallel PCR-GLOBWB global-scale groundwater model at 30 arcsec resolution (~1 km at the Equator). Named GLOBGM v1.0, this model is a follow-up of the 5 arcmin (~10 km) model, aiming for a higher-resolution simulation of worldwide fresh groundwater reserves under climate change and excessive pumping. For a long transient simulation using a parallel prototype of MODFLOW 6, we show that our implementation is efficient for a relatively low number of processor cores.\n\nAdjoint subordination to calculate backward travel time probability of pollutants in water with various velocity resolutions\n\nYong Zhang, Graham E. Fogg, HongGuang Sun, Donald M. Reeves, Roseanna M. Neupauer, and Wei Wei\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 28, 179–203, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-179-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-179-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nPollutant release history and source identification are helpful for managing water resources, but it remains a challenge to reliably identify such information for real-world, complex transport processes in rivers and aquifers. In this study, we filled this knowledge gap by deriving a general backward governing equation and developing the efficient solver. Field applications showed that this model and solver are applicable for a broad range of flow systems, dimensions, and spatiotemporal scales.\n\nSimulation-Based Inference for Parameter Estimation of Complex Watershed Simulators\n\nRobert Hull, Elena Leonarduzzi, Luis De La Fuente, Hoang Viet Tran, Andrew Bennett, Peter Melchior, Reed M. Maxwell, and Laura E. Condon\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci. Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2023-264,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2023-264, 2024\n\nRevised manuscript accepted for HESS\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nLarge-scale hydrologic a needed tool to explore complex watershed processes and how they may evolve under a changing climate. However, calibrating them can be difficult because they are costly to run and have many unknown parameters. We implement a state-of-the-art approach to model calibration with a set of experiments in the Upper Colorado River Basin.\n\nThe global water resources and use model WaterGAP v2.2e: description and evaluation of modifications and new features\n\nHannes MÃ¼ller Schmied, Tim Trautmann, Sebastian Ackermann, Denise CÃ¡ceres, Martina FlÃ¶rke, Helena Gerdener, Ellen Kynast, Thedini Asali Peiris, Leonie Schiebener, Maike Schumacher, and Petra DÃ¶ll\n\nGeosci.

We describe the newest version of the global hydrological model WaterGAP which has been used for numerous water resources assessments since 1996. We show the effects of new model features and model evaluations against observed streamflow and water storage anomalies as well as water abstractions statistics. The publically available model output for several variants is described.\n\nThe benefits and trade-offs of multi-variable calibration of WGHM in the Ganges and Brahmaputra basins\n\nH. M. Mehedi Hasan, Petra DÃ¶ll, Seyed-Mohammad Hosseini-Moghari, Fabrice Papa, and Andreas GÃ¼ntner\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-2324,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-2324, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe calibrate a global hydrological model using multiple observations to analyse the benefits and trade-offs of multi-variable calibration. We found such an approach to be very important for understanding the real-world system. However, some observations are very essential to the system, in particular streamflow. We also showed uncertainties in the calibration results, which is often useful for making informed decisions. We emphasis to consider observation uncertainty in model calibration.\n\nImproving the quantification of climate change hazards by hydrological models: a simple ensemble approach for considering the uncertain effect of vegetation response to climate change on potential evapotranspiration\n\nThedini Asali Peiris and Petra DÃ¶ll\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 27, 3663–3686, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-3663-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-3663-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nHydrological models often overlook vegetation's response to CO2 and climate, impairing their ability to forecast impacts on evapotranspiration and water resources. To address this, we suggest involving two model variants: (1) the standard method and (2) a modified approach (proposed here) based on the Priestley–Taylor equation (PT-MA). While not universally applicable, a dual approach helps consider uncertainties related to vegetation responses to climate change, enhancing model representation.\n\nET-WB: water-balance-based estimations of terrestrial evaporation over global land and major global basins\n\nJinghua Xiong, Abhishek, Li Xu, Hrishikesh A. Chandanpurkar, James S. Famiglietti, Chong Zhang, Gionata Ghiggi, Shenglian Guo, Yun Pan, and Bramha Dutt Vishwakarma\n\nEarth Syst. Sci.

Long-term mean annual ET is within 500–600 mm yr−1 with a unimodal seasonal cycle and several piecewise trends during 2002–2021. The uncertainty-constrained results underpin the notion of increasing ET in a warming climate.\n\nPerformance assessment of geospatial and time series features on groundwater level forecasting with deep learning\n\nMariana Gomez, Maximilian Noelscher, Andreas Hartmann, and Stefan Broda\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-1836,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-1836, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nTo understand the affectations of external factors on the groundwater level modelling with deep learning. We trained, validated, and tuned individually a CNN model in 505 wells distributed throughout the state of Lower Saxony, Germany. Then evaluate the performance against available geospatial features and time series features. New insights are provided about the complexity of controlling factors on groundwater dynamics.\n\nDynQual v1.0: a high-resolution global surface water quality model\n\nEdward R. Jones, Marc F. P. Bierkens, Niko Wanders, Edwin H. Sutanudjaja, Ludovicus P. H. van Beek, and Michelle T. H. van Vliet\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 16, 4481–4500, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-16-4481-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-16-4481-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nDynQual is a new high-resolution global water quality model for simulating total dissolved solids, biological oxygen demand and fecal coliform as indicators of salinity, organic pollution and pathogen pollution, respectively. Output data from DynQual can supplement the observational record of water quality data, which is highly fragmented across space and time, and has the potential to inform assessments in a broad range of fields including ecological, human health and water scarcity studies.\n\nClimate-warming-driven changes in the cryosphere and their impact on groundwaterâsurface-water interactions in the Heihe River basin\n\nAmanda Triplett and Laura E. Condon\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 27, 2763–2785, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-2763-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-2763-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAccelerated melting in mountains is a global phenomenon. The Heihe River basin depends on upstream mountains for its water supply. We built a hydrologic model to examine how shifts in streamflow and warming will impact ground and surface water interactions. The results indicate that degrading permafrost has a larger effect than melting glaciers. Additionally, warming temperatures tend to have more impact than changes to streamflow. These results can inform other mountain–valley system studies.\n\nImproved representation of soil moisture simulations through incorporation of cosmic-ray neutron count measurements in a large-scale hydrologic model\n\nEshrat Fatima, Rohini Kumar, Sabine Attinger, Maren Kaluza, Oldrich Rakovec, Corinna Rebmann, Rafael Rosolem, Sascha Oswald, Luis Samaniego, Steffen Zacharias, and Martin SchrÃ¶n\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-1548,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-1548, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study establishes a framework to incorporate cosmic-ray neutron measurements into the mesoscale Hydrological Model (mHM). We evaluate different approaches to estimate neutron counts within mHM, using the Desilets equation with uniformly and with non-uniformly weighted average soil moisture, and the physically-based code COSMIC. The data not only improved soil moisture simulations, but also the parameterization of evapotranspiration in the model.\n\nTechnical note: The CREDIBLE Uncertainty Estimation (CURE) toolbox: facilitating the communication of epistemic uncertainty\n\nTrevor Page, Paul Smith, Keith Beven, Francesca Pianosi, Fanny Sarrazin, Susana Almeida, Liz Holcombe, Jim Freer, Nick Chappell, and Thorsten Wagener\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 27, 2523–2534, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-2523-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-2523-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis publication provides an introduction to the CREDIBLE Uncertainty Estimation (CURE) toolbox. CURE offers workflows for a variety of uncertainty estimation methods. One of its most important features is the requirement that all of the assumptions on which a workflow analysis depends be defined. This facilitates communication with potential users of an analysis. An audit trail log is produced automatically from a workflow for future reference.\n\nDeveloping spring wheat in the Noah-MP land surface model (v4.4) for growing season dynamics and responses to temperature stress\n\nZhe Zhang, Yanping Li, Fei Chen, Phillip Harder, Warren Helgason, James Famiglietti, Prasanth Valayamkunnath, Cenlin He, and Zhenhua Li\n\nGeosci.

In this study, we aim to model the spring wheat in the Northern Great Plains, focusing on three aspects: (1) develop the wheat model at a point scale, (2) apply dynamic planting and harvest schedules, and (3) adopt a revised heat stress function. The results show substantial improvements and have great importance for agricultural production.\n\nAnalyzing the informative value of alternative hazard indicators for monitoring drought hazard for human water supply and river ecosystems at the global scale\n\nClaudia Herbert and Petra DÃ¶ll\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 2111–2131, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-2111-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-23-2111-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper presents a new method for selecting streamflow drought hazard indicators for monitoring drought hazard for human water supply and river ecosystems in large-scale drought early warning systems. Indicators are classified by their inherent assumptions about the habituation of people and ecosystems to the streamflow regime and their level of drought characterization, namely drought magnitude (water deficit at a certain point in time) and severity (cumulated magnitude since drought onset).\n\nPanta Rhei benchmark dataset: socio-hydrological data of paired events of floods and droughts\n\nHeidi Kreibich, Kai SchrÃ¶ter, Giuliano Di Baldassarre, Anne F.

We present a dataset containing data of paired events, i.e. two floods or two droughts that occurred in the same area. The dataset enables comparative analyses and allows detailed context-specific assessments. Additionally, it supports the testing of socio-hydrological models.\n\nGEB v0.1: a large-scale agent-based socio-hydrological model â simulating 10 million individual farming households in a fully distributed hydrological model\n\nJens A. de Bruijn, Mikhail Smilovic, Peter Burek, Luca Guillaumot, Yoshihide Wada, and Jeroen C. J. H. Aerts\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 16, 2437–2454, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-16-2437-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-16-2437-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe present a computer simulation model of the hydrological system and human system, which can simulate the behaviour of individual farmers and their interactions with the water system at basin scale to assess how the systems have evolved and are projected to evolve in the future. For example, we can simulate the effect of subsidies provided on investment in adaptation measures and subsequent effects in the hydrological system, such as a lowering of the groundwater table or reservoir level.\n\nTowards Interpretable LSTM-based Modelling of Hydrological Systems\n\nLuis Andres De la Fuente, Mohammad Reza Ehsani, Hoshin Vijai Gupta, and Laura E. Condon\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-666,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-666, 2023\n\nPreprint archived\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nLong Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is a widely-used machine learning (ML) model in hydrology. However, it is difficult to extract knowledge from it. We propose HydroLSTM which represents processes analogous to a hydrological reservoir. Models using HydroLSTM perform similarly to LSTM but require fewer cell states. The learned parameters are informative about the dominant hydroclimatic characteristics of a catchment. Our results demonstrate how hydrological knowledge is encoded in the new structure.\n\nHyper-resolution PCR-GLOBWB: opportunities and challenges from refining model spatial resolution to 1 km over the European continent\n\nJannis M. Hoch, Edwin H. Sutanudjaja, Niko Wanders, Rens L. P. H. van Beek, and Marc F. P. Bierkens\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 27, 1383–1401, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-1383-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-1383-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nTo facilitate locally relevant simulations over large areas, global hydrological models (GHMs) have moved towards ever finer spatial resolutions. After a decade-long quest for hyper-resolution (i.e. equal to or smaller than 1 km), the presented work is a first application of a GHM at 1 km resolution over Europe. This not only shows that hyper-resolution can be achieved but also allows for a thorough evaluation of model results at unprecedented detail and the formulation of future research.\n\nIncorporating experimentally derived streamflow contributions into model parameterization to improve discharge prediction\n\nAndreas Hartmann, Jean-Lionel Payeur-Poirier, and Luisa Hopp\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 27, 1325–1341, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-1325-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-1325-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe advance our understanding of including information derived from environmental tracers into hydrological modeling. We present a simple approach that integrates streamflow observations and tracer-derived streamflow contributions for model parameter estimation. We consider multiple observed streamflow components and their variation over time to quantify the impact of their inclusion for streamflow prediction at the catchment scale.\n\nThe suitability of a seasonal ensemble hybrid framework including data-driven approaches for hydrological forecasting\n\nSandra M. Hauswirth, Marc F. P. Bierkens, Vincent Beijk, and Niko Wanders\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 27, 501–517, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-501-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-501-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nForecasts on water availability are important for water managers. We test a hybrid framework based on machine learning models and global input data for generating seasonal forecasts. Our evaluation shows that our discharge and surface water level predictions are able to create reliable forecasts up to 2 months ahead. We show that a hybrid framework, developed for local purposes and combined and rerun with global data, can create valuable information similar to large-scale forecasting models.\n\nstoPET v1.0: a stochastic potential evapotranspiration generator for simulation of climate change impacts\n\nDagmawi Teklu Asfaw, Michael Bliss Singer, Rafael Rosolem, David MacLeod, Mark Cuthbert, Edisson Quichimbo Miguitama, Manuel F. Rios Gaona, and Katerina Michaelides\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 16, 557–571, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-16-557-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-16-557-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nstoPET is a new stochastic potential evapotranspiration (PET) generator for the globe at hourly resolution. Many stochastic weather generators are used to generate stochastic rainfall time series; however, no such model exists for stochastically generating plausible PET time series. As such, stoPET represents a significant methodological advance. stoPET generate many realizations of PET to conduct climate studies related to the water balance, agriculture, water resources, and ecology.\n\nEstimating karst groundwater recharge from soil moisture observationsÂ â a new method tested at the Swabian Alb, southwest Germany\n\nRomane Berthelin, Tunde Olarinoye, Michael Rinderer, MatÃ­as Mudarra, Dominic Demand, Mirjam Scheller, and Andreas Hartmann\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 27, 385–400, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-385-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-385-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nKarstic recharge processes have mainly been explored using discharge analysis despite the high influence of the heterogeneous surface on hydrological processes. In this paper, we introduce an event-based method which allows for recharge estimation from soil moisture measurements. The method was tested at a karst catchment in Germany but can be applied to other karst areas with precipitation and soil moisture data available. It will allow for a better characterization of karst recharge processes.\n\nImpact of distributed meteorological forcing on simulated snow cover and hydrological fluxes over a mid-elevation alpine micro-scale catchment\n\nAniket Gupta, Alix Reverdy, Jean-Martial Cohard, Basile Hector, Marc Descloitres, Jean-Pierre Vandervaere, Catherine Coulaud, Romain Biron, Lucie Liger, Reed Maxwell, Jean-Gabriel Valay, and Didier Voisin\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 27, 191–212, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-191-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-27-191-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nPatchy snow cover during spring impacts mountainous ecosystems on a large range of spatio-temporal scales. A hydrological model simulated such snow patchiness at 10 m resolution. Slope and orientation controls precipitation, radiation, and wind generate differences in snowmelt, subsurface storage, streamflow, and evapotranspiration. The snow patchiness increases the duration of the snowmelt to stream and subsurface storage, which sustains the plants and streamflow later in the summer.\n\nPoor correlation between large-scale environmental flow violations and freshwater biodiversity: implications for water resource management and the freshwater planetary boundary\n\nChinchu Mohan, Tom Gleeson, James S. Famiglietti, Vili Virkki, Matti Kummu, Miina Porkka, Lan Wang-Erlandsson, Xander Huggins, Dieter Gerten, and Sonja C. JÃ¤hnig\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 26, 6247–6262, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-6247-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-6247-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe relationship between environmental flow violations and freshwater biodiversity at a large scale is not well explored. This study intended to carry out an exploratory evaluation of this relationship at a large scale. While our results suggest that streamflow and EF may not be the only determinants of freshwater biodiversity at large scales, they do not preclude the existence of relationships at smaller scales or with more holistic EF methods or with other biodiversity data or metrics.\n\nA large-sample investigation into uncertain climate change impacts on high flows across Great Britain\n\nRosanna A. Lane, Gemma Coxon, Jim Freer, Jan Seibert, and Thorsten Wagener\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 26, 5535–5554, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-5535-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-5535-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study modelled the impact of climate change on river high flows across Great Britain (GB). Generally, results indicated an increase in the magnitude and frequency of high flows along the west coast of GB by 2050–2075. In contrast, average flows decreased across GB. All flow projections contained large uncertainties; the climate projections were the largest source of uncertainty overall but hydrological modelling uncertainties were considerable in some regions.\n\nUsing simulation-based inference to determine the parameters of an integrated hydrologic model: a case study from the upper Colorado River basin\n\nRobert Hull, Elena Leonarduzzi, Luis De La Fuente, Hoang Viet Tran, Andrew Bennett, Peter Melchior, Reed M. Maxwell, and Laura E. Condon\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci. Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2022-345,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2022-345, 2022\n\nPublication in HESS not foreseen\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAs the stress on water resources from climate change grows, we need models that represent water processes at the scale of counties, states, and even countries in order to make viable predictions about things will change. While such models are powerful, they can be cumbersome to deal with because they are so large. This research explores a novel way of increasing the efficiency of large-scale hydrologic models using an approach called Simulation-Based Inference.\n\nKarst spring recession and classification: efficient, automated methods for both fast- and slow-flow components\n\nTunde Olarinoye, Tom Gleeson, and Andreas Hartmann\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 26, 5431–5447, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-5431-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-5431-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAnalysis of karst spring recession is essential for management of groundwater. In karst, recession is dominated by slow and fast components; separating these components is by manual and subjective approaches. In our study, we tested the applicability of automated streamflow recession extraction procedures for a karst spring. Results showed that, by simple modification, streamflow extraction methods can identify slow and fast components: derived recession parameters are within reasonable ranges.\n\nPitfalls and a feasible solution for using KGE as an informal likelihood function in MCMC methods: DREAM(ZS) as an example\n\nYan Liu, Jaime FernÃ¡ndez-Ortega, MatÃ­as Mudarra, and Andreas Hartmann\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 26, 5341–5355, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-5341-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-5341-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe adapt the informal Kling–Gupta efficiency (KGE) with a gamma distribution to apply it as an informal likelihood function in the DiffeRential Evolution Adaptive Metropolis DREAM(ZS) method. Our adapted approach performs as well as the formal likelihood function for exploring posterior distributions of model parameters. The adapted KGE is superior to the formal likelihood function for calibrations combining multiple observations with different lengths, frequencies and units.\n\nFarmCan: a physical, statistical, and machine learning model to forecast crop water deficit for farms\n\nSara Sadri, James S. Famiglietti, Ming Pan, Hylke E. Beck, Aaron Berg, and Eric F. Wood\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 26, 5373–5390, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-5373-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-5373-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA farm-scale hydroclimatic machine learning framework to advise farmers was developed. FarmCan uses remote sensing data and farmers' input to forecast crop water deficits. The 8 d composite variables are better than daily ones for forecasting water deficit. Evapotranspiration (ET) and potential ET are more effective than soil moisture at predicting crop water deficit. FarmCan uses a crop-specific schedule to use surface or root zone soil moisture.\n\nHistorical Analysis of Reservoir Storage Trends and Resilience Across Contiguous US from 1980–2019\n\nJennie C. Steyaert and Laura E. Condon\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2022-1051,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2022-1051, 2022\n\nPreprint archived\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAll river systems in the US are impacted by dams, yet analyses are limited by a lack of data. We use the first national dataset of reservoir data to analyze reservoir storage trends from 1980–2019. We show that reservoir storage has decreased over the past 40 years. The range in monthly storage has increased over time in drier regions and decreased in wetter ones. Lastly, we find that most regions have reservoir storage that takes longer to recover from and are therefore more vulnerable.\n\nCoupling a large-scale hydrological model (CWatM v1.1) with a high-resolution groundwater flow model (MODFLOW 6) to assess the impact of irrigation at regional scale\n\nLuca Guillaumot, Mikhail Smilovic, Peter Burek, Jens de Bruijn, Peter Greve, Taher Kahil, and Yoshihide Wada\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 15, 7099–7120, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-7099-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-7099-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe develop and test the first large-scale hydrological model at regional scale with a very high spatial resolution that includes a water management and groundwater flow model. This study infers the impact of surface and groundwater-based irrigation on groundwater recharge and on evapotranspiration in both irrigated and non-irrigated areas. We argue that water table recorded in boreholes can be used as validation data if water management is well implemented and spatial resolution is ≤ 100 m.\n\nThe ExtremeX global climate model experiment: investigating thermodynamic and dynamic processes contributing to weather and climate extremes\n\nKathrin Wehrli, Fei Luo, Mathias Hauser, Hideo Shiogama, Daisuke Tokuda, Hyungjun Kim, Dim Coumou, Wilhelm May, Philippe Le Sager, Frank Selten, Olivia Martius, Robert Vautard, and Sonia I. Seneviratne\n\nEarth Syst.

Global climate simulations are carried out with three models. The results show that in constrained experiments, temperature anomalies during heatwaves are well represented, although climatological model biases remain. Further, a substantial contribution of both atmospheric circulation and soil moisture to heat extremes is identified.\n\nSummertime Rossby waves in climate models: substantial biases in surface imprint associated with small biases in upper-level circulation\n\nFei Luo, Frank Selten, Kathrin Wehrli, Kai Kornhuber, Philippe Le Sager, Wilhelm May, Thomas Reerink, Sonia I. Seneviratne, Hideo Shiogama, Daisuke Tokuda, Hyungjun Kim, and Dim Coumou\n\nWeather Clim. Dynam., 3, 905–935, https://doi.org/10.5194/wcd-3-905-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/wcd-3-905-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nRecent studies have identified the weather systems in observational data, where wave patterns with high-magnitude values that circle around the whole globe in either wavenumber 5 or wavenumber 7 are responsible for the extreme events. In conclusion, we find that the climate models are able to reproduce the large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns as well as their associated surface variables such as temperature, precipitation, and sea level pressure.\n\nRemotely sensed reservoir water storage dynamicsÂ (1984â2015) and the influence of climate variability and management at a global scale\n\nJiawei Hou, Albert I. J. M. van Dijk, Hylke E. Beck, Luigi J. Renzullo, and Yoshihide Wada\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 26, 3785–3803, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-3785-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-3785-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe used satellite imagery to measure monthly reservoir water volumes for 6695 reservoirs worldwide for 1984–2015. We investigated how changing precipitation, streamflow, evaporation, and human activity affected reservoir water storage. Almost half of the reservoirs showed significant increasing or decreasing trends over the past three decades. These changes are caused, first and foremost, by changes in precipitation rather than by changes in net evaporation or dam release patterns.\n\nGlobally widespread and increasing violations of environmental flow envelopes\n\nVili Virkki, Elina AlanÃ¤rÃ¤, Miina Porkka, Lauri Ahopelto, Tom Gleeson, Chinchu Mohan, Lan Wang-Erlandsson, Martina FlÃ¶rke, Dieter Gerten, Simon N. Gosling, Naota Hanasaki, Hannes MÃ¼ller Schmied, Niko Wanders, and Matti Kummu\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst.

Here, we apply a method of environmental flow envelopes (EFEs) that develops the existing global environmental flow assessments by methodological advances and better consideration of uncertainty. By assessing the violations of the EFE, we comprehensively quantify the frequency, severity, and trends of flow alteration during the past decades, illustrating anthropogenic effects on streamflow.\n\nThe importance of non-stationary multiannual periodicities in the North Atlantic Oscillation index for forecasting water resource drought\n\nWilliam Rust, John P. Bloomfield, Mark Cuthbert, Ron Corstanje, and Ian Holman\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 26, 2449–2467, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-2449-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-2449-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe highlight the importance of the North Atlantic Oscillation in controlling droughts in the UK. Specifically, multi-year cycles in the NAO are shown to influence the frequency of droughts and this influence changes considerably over time. We show that the influence of these varying controls is similar to the projected effects of climate change on water resources. We also show that these time-varying behaviours have important implications for water resource forecasts used for drought planning.\n\nGeoDAR: georeferenced global dams and reservoirs dataset for bridging attributes and geolocations\n\nJida Wang, Blake A.

We present a new global dataset, GeoDAR, that includes nearly 25 000 georeferenced dam points and their associated reservoir boundaries. A majority of these features can be linked to the register of the International Commission on Large Dams, extending the potential of registered attribute information for spatially explicit applications.\n\nUsing LSTM to monitor continuous discharge indirectly with electrical conductivity observations\n\nYong Chang, Benjamin Mewes, and Andreas Hartmann\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci.

We found that the spring discharge can be well predicted by EC in storms using LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) model, while the prediction has relatively large uncertainties in small recharge events. To establish a roust LSTM model for long-term discharge prediction from EC in ungauged catchments, the random or fixed-interval discharge monitoring strategy is recommended.\n\nCOSMOS-Europe: a European network of cosmic-ray neutron soil moisture sensors\n\nHeye Reemt Bogena, Martin SchrÃ¶n, Jannis Jakobi, Patrizia Ney, Steffen Zacharias, Mie Andreasen, Roland Baatz, David Boorman, Mustafa Berk Duygu, Miguel Angel Eguibar-GalÃ¡n, Benjamin Fersch, Till Franke, Josie Geris, MarÃ­a GonzÃ¡lez Sanchis, Yann Kerr, Tobias Korf, Zalalem Mengistu, Arnaud Mialon, Paolo Nasta, Jerzy Nitychoruk, Vassilios Pisinaras, Daniel Rasche, Rafael Rosolem, Hami Said, Paul Schattan, Marek Zreda, Stefan Achleitner, Eduardo Albentosa-HernÃ¡ndez, Zuhal AkyÃ¼rek, Theresa Blume, Antonio del Campo, Davide Canone, Katya Dimitrova-Petrova, John G.

This data paper presents long-term soil moisture measurements recorded by 66 cosmic-ray neutron sensors (CRNS) operated by 24 institutions and distributed across major climate zones in Europe.

Ocean-mass change has been assessed through the contributions from glaciers, ice sheets, and land water storage or directly from satellite data since 2003. Our budget assessments of linear trends and monthly anomalies utilise new datasets and uncertainty characterisations developed within ESA's Climate Change Initiative.\n\nQuantifying the impacts of land cover change on hydrological responses in the Mahanadi river basin in India\n\nShaini Naha, Miguel Angel Rico-Ramirez, and Rafael Rosolem\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 25, 6339–6357, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-25-6339-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-25-6339-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nRapid growth in population in developing countries leads to an increase in food demand, and as a consequence, percentages of land are being converted to cropland which alters river flow processes. This study describes how the hydrology of a flood-prone river basin in India would respond to the current and future changes in land cover. Our findings indicate that the recurrent flood events occurring in the basin might be influenced by these changes in land cover at the catchment scale.\n\nAssessment of the ParFlowâCLM CONUS 1.0 integrated hydrologic model: evaluation of hyper-resolution water balance components across the contiguous United States\n\nMary M. F. O'Neill, Danielle T. Tijerina, Laura E. Condon, and Reed M. Maxwell\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 14, 7223–7254, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-14-7223-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-14-7223-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nModeling the hydrologic cycle at high resolution and at large spatial scales is an incredible opportunity and challenge for hydrologists. In this paper, we present the results of a high-resolution hydrologic simulation configured over the contiguous United States. We discuss simulated water fluxes through groundwater, soil, plants, and over land, and we compare model results to in situ observations and satellite products in order to build confidence and guide future model development.\n\nCosmic-Ray neutron Sensor PYthon tool (crspy 1.2.1): an open-source tool for the processing of cosmic-ray neutron and soil moisture data\n\nDaniel Power, Miguel Angel Rico-Ramirez, Sharon Desilets, Darin Desilets, and Rafael Rosolem\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 14, 7287–7307, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-14-7287-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-14-7287-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nCosmic-ray neutron sensors estimate root-zone soil moisture at sub-kilometre scales. There are national-scale networks of these sensors across the globe; however, methods for converting neutron signals to soil moisture values are inconsistent. This paper describes our open-source Python tool that processes raw sensor data into soil moisture estimates. The aim is to allow a user to ensure they have a harmonized data set, along with informative metadata, to facilitate both research and teaching.\n\nMidlatitude mixed-phase stratocumulus clouds and their interactions with aerosols: how ice processes affect microphysical, dynamic, and thermodynamic development in those clouds and interactions?\n\nSeoung Soo Lee, Kyung-Ja Ha, Manguttathil Gopalakrishnan Manoj, Mohammad Kamruzzaman, Hyungjun Kim, Nobuyuki Utsumi, Youtong Zheng, Byung-Gon Kim, Chang Hoon Jung, Junshik Um, Jianping Guo, Kyoung Ock Choi, and Go-Un Kim\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 21, 16843–16868, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-16843-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-21-16843-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nUsing a modeling framework, a midlatitude stratocumulus cloud system is simulated. It is found that cloud mass in the system becomes very low due to interactions between ice and liquid particles compared to that in the absence of ice particles. It is also found that interactions between cloud mass and aerosols lead to a reduction in cloud mass in the system, and this is contrary to an aerosol-induced increase in cloud mass in the absence of ice particles.\n\nImprovement of river network representation in Africa: application of an approach based on digital elevation data and environmental characteristics\n\nAxel P.

AndrÃ©s Quichimbo, Michael Bliss Singer, Katerina Michaelides, Daniel E. J. Hobley, Rafael Rosolem, and Mark O. Cuthbert\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 14, 6893–6917, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-14-6893-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-14-6893-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nUnderstanding and quantifying water partitioning in dryland regions are of key importance to anticipate the future impacts of climate change in water resources and dryland ecosystems. Here, we have developed a simple hydrological model (DRYP) that incorporates the key processes of water partitioning in drylands. DRYP is a modular, versatile, and parsimonious model that can be used to anticipate and plan for climatic and anthropogenic changes to water fluxes and storage in dryland regions.\n\nLarge-scale sensitivities of groundwater and surface water to groundwater withdrawal\n\nMarc F. P. Bierkens, Edwin H. Sutanudjaja, and Niko Wanders\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 25, 5859–5878, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-25-5859-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-25-5859-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe introduce a simple analytical framework that allows us to estimate to what extent large-scale groundwater withdrawal affects groundwater levels and streamflow. It also calculates which part of the groundwater withdrawal comes out of groundwater storage and which part from a reduction in streamflow. Global depletion rates obtained with the framework are compared with estimates from satellites, from global- and continental-scale groundwater models, and from in situ datasets.\n\nDevelopment of a coupled simulation framework representing the lake and river continuum of mass and energy (TCHOIR v1.0)\n\nDaisuke Tokuda, Hyungjun Kim, Dai Yamazaki, and Taikan Oki\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 14, 5669–5693, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-14-5669-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-14-5669-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe developed TCHOIR, a hydrologic simulation framework, to solve fluvial- and thermodynamics of the river–lake continuum. This provides an algorithm for upscaling high-resolution topography as well, which enables the representation of those interactions at the global scale. Validation against in situ and satellite observations shows that the coupled mode outperforms river- or lake-only modes. TCHOIR will contribute to elucidating the role of surface hydrology in Earthâs energy and water cycle.\n\nQuantifying the Regional Water Balance of the Ethiopian Rift Valley Lake Basin Using an Uncertainty Estimation Framework\n\nTesfalem Abraham, Yan Liu, Sirak Tekleab, and Andreas Hartmann\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci. Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2021-271,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2021-271, 2021\n\nPreprint withdrawn\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this study we demonstrate the use of global data products for the regionalization of model parameters. We combine three steps of uncertainty quantification from the parameter sampling, best parameter sets identification, and spatial cross-validation. Our results show the best validation parameters provide the most robust regionalization results, and the uncertainties from the regionalization in the ungauged catchments are higher than those obtained from simulations in the gauged catchments.\n\nThe three-dimensional groundwater salinity distribution and fresh groundwater volumes in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam, inferred from geostatistical analyses\n\nJan L. Gunnink, Hung Van Pham, Gualbert H. P. Oude Essink, and Marc F. P. Bierkens\n\nEarth Syst. Sci. Data, 13, 3297–3319, https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-13-3297-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-13-3297-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn the Mekong Delta (Vietnam) groundwater is important for domestic, agricultural and industrial use. Increased pumping of groundwater has caused land subsidence and increased the risk of salinization, thereby endangering the livelihood of the population in the delta. We made a model of the salinity of the groundwater by integrating different sources of information and determined fresh groundwater volumes. The resulting model can be used by researchers and policymakers.\n\nA national topographic dataset for hydrological modeling over the contiguous United States\n\nJun Zhang, Laura E. Condon, Hoang Tran, and Reed M. Maxwell\n\nEarth Syst. Sci. Data, 13, 3263–3279, https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-13-3263-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-13-3263-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nExisting national topographic datasets for the US may not be compatible with gridded hydrologic models. A national topographic dataset developed to support physically based hydrologic models at 1 km and 250 m over the contiguous US is provided. We used a Priority Flood algorithm to ensure hydrologically consistent drainage networks and evaluated the performance with an integrated hydrologic model. Datasets and scripts are available for direct data usage or modification of processing as desired.\n\nDrought onset and propagation into soil moisture and grassland vegetation responses during the 2012â2019Â major drought in Southern California\n\nMaria Magdalena Warter, Michael Bliss Singer, Mark O. Cuthbert, Dar Roberts, Kelly K. Caylor, Romy Sabathier, and John Stella\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 25, 3713–3729, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-25-3713-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-25-3713-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIntensified drying of soil and grassland vegetation is raising the impact of fire severity and extent in Southern California. While browned grassland is a common sight during the dry season, this study has shown that there is a pronounced shift in the timing of senescence, due to changing climate conditions favoring milder winter temperatures and increased precipitation variability. Vegetation may be limited in its ability to adapt to these shifts, as drought periods become more frequent.\n\nUnderstanding each other's models: an introduction and a standard representation of 16 global water models to support intercomparison, improvement, and communication\n\nCamelia-Eliza Telteu, Hannes MÃ¼ller Schmied, Wim Thiery, Guoyong Leng, Peter Burek, Xingcai Liu, Julien Eric Stanislas Boulange, Lauren Seaby Andersen, Manolis Grillakis, Simon Newland Gosling, Yusuke Satoh, Oldrich Rakovec, Tobias Stacke, Jinfeng Chang, Niko Wanders, Harsh Lovekumar Shah, Tim Trautmann, Ganquan Mao, Naota Hanasaki, Aristeidis Koutroulis, Yadu Pokhrel, Luis Samaniego, Yoshihide Wada, Vimal Mishra, Junguo Liu, Petra DÃ¶ll, Fang Zhao, Anne GÃ¤deke, Sam S. Rabin, and Florian Herz\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 14, 3843–3878, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-14-3843-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-14-3843-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe analyse water storage compartments, water flows, and human water use sectors included in 16 global water models that provide simulations for the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project phase 2b. We develop a standard writing style for the model equations. We conclude that even though hydrologic processes are often based on similar equations, in the end these equations have been adjusted, or the models have used different values for specific parameters or specific variables.\n\nHydroinformatics education â the Water Informatics in Science and Engineering (WISE) Centre for Doctoral Training\n\nThorsten Wagener, Dragan Savic, David Butler, Reza Ahmadian, Tom Arnot, Jonathan Dawes, Slobodan Djordjevic, Roger Falconer, Raziyeh Farmani, Debbie Ford, Jan Hofman, Zoran Kapelan, Shunqi Pan, and Ross Woods\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst.

To address this issue, the Water Informatics in Science and Engineering Centre for Doctoral Training (WISE CDT) offers a postgraduate programme that fosters enhanced levels of innovation and collaboration by training a cohort of engineers and scientists at the boundary of water informatics, science and engineering.\n\nSoil moisture and streamflow deficit anomaly index: an approach to quantify drought hazards by combining deficit and anomaly\n\nEklavyya Popat and Petra DÃ¶ll\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 21, 1337–1354, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-21-1337-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-21-1337-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nTwo drought hazard indices are presented that combine drought deficit and anomaly aspects: one for soil moisture drought (SMDAI) where we simplified the DSI and the other for streamflow drought (QDAI), which is to our knowledge the first ever deficit anomaly drought index including surface water demand. Both indices are tested at the global scale with WaterGAP 2.2d outputs, providing more differentiated spatial and temporal patterns distinguishing the actual degree of respective drought hazard.\n\nExploring the role of hydrological pathways in modulating multi-annual climate teleconnection periodicities from UK rainfall to streamflow\n\nWilliam Rust, Mark Cuthbert, John Bloomfield, Ron Corstanje, Nicholas Howden, and Ian Holman\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 25, 2223–2237, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-25-2223-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-25-2223-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this paper, we find evidence for the cyclical behaviour (on a 7-year basis) in UK streamflow records that match the main cycle of the North Atlantic Oscillation. Furthermore, we find that the strength of these 7-year cycles in streamflow is dependent on proportional contributions from groundwater and the response times of the underlying groundwater systems. This may allow for improvements to water management practices through better understanding of long-term streamflow behaviour.\n\nMultivariable evaluation of land surface processes in forced and coupled modes reveals new error sources to the simulated water cycle in the IPSL (Institute Pierre Simon Laplace) climate model\n\nHiroki Mizuochi, AgnÃ¨s Ducharne, FrÃ©dÃ©rique Cheruy, Josefine Ghattas, Amen Al-Yaari, Jean-Pierre Wigneron, Vladislav Bastrikov, Philippe Peylin, Fabienne Maignan, and Nicolas Vuichard\n\nHydrol.

Global hydrological models such as WaterGAP are developed to provide this information. Here we present a thorough description, evaluation and application examples of the most recent model version, WaterGAP v2.2d.\n\nUncertainty of simulated groundwater recharge at different global warming levels: a global-scale multi-model ensemble study\n\nRobert Reinecke, Hannes MÃ¼ller Schmied, Tim Trautmann, Lauren Seaby Andersen, Peter Burek, Martina FlÃ¶rke, Simon N. Gosling, Manolis Grillakis, Naota Hanasaki, Aristeidis Koutroulis, Yadu Pokhrel, Wim Thiery, Yoshihide Wada, Satoh Yusuke, and Petra DÃ¶ll\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 25, 787–810, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-25-787-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-25-787-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nBillions of people rely on groundwater as an accessible source of drinking water and for irrigation, especially in times of drought. Groundwater recharge is the primary process of regenerating groundwater resources. We find that groundwater recharge will increase in northern Europe by about 19 % and decrease by 10 % in the Amazon with 3 °C global warming. In the Mediterranean, a 2 °C warming has already lead to a reduction in recharge by 38 %. However, these model predictions are uncertain.\n\nCountry-level and gridded estimates of wastewater production, collection, treatment and reuse\n\nEdward R. Jones, Michelle T. H. van Vliet, Manzoor Qadir, and Marc F. P. Bierkens\n\nEarth Syst. Sci. Data, 13, 237–254, https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-13-237-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-13-237-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nContinually improving and affordable wastewater management provides opportunities for both pollution reduction and clean water supply augmentation. This study provides a global outlook on the state of domestic and industrial wastewater production, collection, treatment and reuse. Our results can serve as a baseline in evaluating progress towards policy goals (e.g. Sustainable Development Goals) and as input data in large-scale water resource assessments (e.g. water quality modelling).\n\nClimatic expression of rainfall on soil moisture dynamics in drylands\n\nIsaac Kipkemoi, Katerina Michaelides, Rafael Rosolem, and Michael Bliss Singer\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci. Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2021-48,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2021-48, 2021\n\nManuscript not accepted for further review\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe work is a novel investigation of the role of temporal rainfall resolution and intensity in affecting the water balance of soil in a dryland environment. This research has implications for what rainfall data are used to assess the impact of climate and climate change on the regional water balance. This information is critical for anticipating the impact of a changing climate on dryland communities globally who need it to know when to plant their seeds or where livestock pasture is available.\n\nTechnical note: Disentangling the groundwater response to Earth and atmospheric tides to improve subsurface characterisation\n\nGabriel C. Rau, Mark O. Cuthbert, R. Ian Acworth, and Philipp Blum\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 24, 6033–6046, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-24-6033-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-24-6033-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis work provides an important generalisation of a previously developed method that quantifies subsurface barometric efficiency using the groundwater level response to Earth and atmospheric tides. The new approach additionally allows the quantification of hydraulic conductivity and specific storage. This enables improved and rapid assessment of subsurface processes and properties using standard pressure measurements.\n\nSnow cover duration trends observed at sites and predicted by multiple models\n\nRichard Essery, Hyungjun Kim, Libo Wang, Paul Bartlett, Aaron Boone, Claire Brutel-Vuilmet, Eleanor Burke, Matthias Cuntz, Bertrand Decharme, Emanuel Dutra, Xing Fang, Yeugeniy Gusev, Stefan Hagemann, Vanessa Haverd, Anna Kontu, Gerhard Krinner, Matthieu Lafaysse, Yves Lejeune, Thomas Marke, Danny Marks, Christoph Marty, Cecile B. Menard, Olga Nasonova, Tomoko Nitta, John Pomeroy, Gerd SchÃ¤dler, Vladimir Semenov, Tatiana Smirnova, Sean Swenson, Dmitry Turkov, Nander Wever, and Hua Yuan\n\nThe Cryosphere, 14, 4687–4698, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-4687-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-4687-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nClimate models are uncertain in predicting how warming changes snow cover. This paper compares 22 snow models with the same meteorological inputs. Predicted trends agree with observations at four snow research sites: winter snow cover does not start later, but snow now melts earlier in spring than in the 1980s at two of the sites. Cold regions where snow can last until late summer are predicted to be particularly sensitive to warming because the snow then melts faster at warmer times of year.\n\nIncluding informal housing in slope stability analysis â an application to a data-scarce location in the humid tropics\n\nElisa Bozzolan, Elizabeth Holcombe, Francesca Pianosi, and Thorsten Wagener\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 20, 3161–3177, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-20-3161-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-20-3161-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe include informal housing in slope stability analysis, considering different slope properties and precipitation events (including climate change). The dominant failure processes are identified, and their relative role in slope failure is quantified. A new rainfall threshold is assessed for urbanised slopes. Instability rules are provided to recognise urbanised slopes most at risk. The methodology is suitable for regions with scarce field measurements and landslide inventories.\n\nGlobal climate response to idealized deforestation in CMIP6 models\n\nLena R.

It takes many decades for the temperature signal to emerge, with non-local effects playing an important role. Despite a consistent experimental setup, models diverge substantially in their climate responses. This study offers unprecedented insights for understanding land use change effects in CMIP6 models.\n\nTesting water fluxes and storage from two hydrology configurations within the ORCHIDEE land surface model across US semi-arid sites\n\nNatasha MacBean, Russell L.

Continents lost water to oceans at an accelerated rate, inducing sea level rise. Shrinking glaciers explain 81 % of the long-term continental water mass loss, while declining groundwater levels, mainly due to sustained groundwater pumping for irrigation, is the second major driver. This long-term decline was partly offset by the impoundment of water in dams.\n\nCAMELS-GB: hydrometeorological time series and landscape attributes for 671 catchments in Great Britain\n\nGemma Coxon, Nans Addor, John P.

The dataset collates river flows, catchment attributes, and catchment boundaries for 671 catchments across Great Britain. We characterise the topography, climate, streamflow, land cover, soils, hydrogeology, human influence, and discharge uncertainty of each catchment. The dataset is publicly available for the community to use in a wide range of environmental and modelling analyses.\n\nUnderstanding and predicting large-scale hydrological variability in a changing environment\n\nNicolas Massei, Daniel G.

Emphasis is put on the necessary efforts to better understand 1 – the impact of low-frequency climate variability on hydrological trends and extremes, 2 – the role of basin properties on modulating the climate signal producing hydrological responses on the basin scale.\n\nGroundwater storage dynamics in the world's large aquifer systems from GRACE: uncertainty and role of extreme precipitation\n\nMohammad Shamsudduha and Richard G. Taylor\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 11, 755–774, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-11-755-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-11-755-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nRecent assessments of the sustainability of global groundwater resources using the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellites assume that the underlying trends are linear. Here, we assess recent changes in groundwater storage (ÎGWS) in the worldâs large aquifer systems using an ensemble of GRACE datasets and show that trends are mostly non-linear. Non-linearity in ÎGWS derives, in part, from the episodic nature of groundwater replenishment associated with extreme precipitation.\n\nClimateâgroundwater dynamics inferred from GRACE and the role of hydraulic memory\n\nSimon Opie, Richard G.

Dynam., 11, 775–791, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-11-775-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-11-775-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nKnowledge of the relationship between climate and groundwater is limited and typically undermined by the scale, duration and accessibility of observations. Using monthly satellite measurements newly compiled over 14 years in the tropics and sub-tropics, we show that the imprint of precipitation history on groundwater, i.e. hydraulic memory, is longer in drylands than humid environments with important implications for the understanding and management of groundwater resources under climate change.\n\nHESS Opinions: Improving the evaluation of groundwater representation in continental to global scale models\n\nTom Gleeson, Thorsten Wagener, Petra DÃ¶ll, Samuel C.

Earth Syst. Sci., 24, 3753–3774, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-24-3753-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-24-3753-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn land surface models (LSMs), soil properties are inferred from soil texture. In this study, we use different input global soil texture maps from the literature to investigate the impact of soil texture on the simulated water budget in an LSM. The medium loamy textures give the highest evapotranspiration and lowest total runoff rates. However, the different soil texture maps result in similar water budgets because of their inherent similarities, especially when upscaled at the 0.5° resolution.\n\nDevelopment of the Community Water Model (CWatM v1.04) â a high-resolution hydrological model for global and regional assessment of integrated water resources management\n\nPeter Burek, Yusuke Satoh, Taher Kahil, Ting Tang, Peter Greve, Mikhail Smilovic, Luca Guillaumot, Fang Zhao, and Yoshihide Wada\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 13, 3267–3298, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-13-3267-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-13-3267-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe present the new global hydrological model \"Community Water Model\" (CWatM), which can be used globally and regionally. The model is open source and written with the Python programming language. It uses global, freely available data in a smart and state-of-the-art format. It includes the major hydrological processes but also takes into account human activities, such as water use and reservoir regulation, by calculating water demand from the agriculture, domestic, and industrial sectors.\n\nQuantifying the impact of land cover changes on hydrological extremes in India\n\nShaini Naha, Miguel A. Rico-Ramirez, and Rafael Rosolem\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci. Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2020-220,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2020-220, 2020\n\nManuscript not accepted for further review\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nRapid growth in population in developing countries leads to an increase in food demand and as a consequence, percentages of land are being converted to cropland which alters the river flow processes. Therefore we try to understand the exact role of these changes in modifying the river flows through the prediction of the impacts of these changes in the future by taking a clue from the past. This study concludes that recurrent flood events might be influenced by these changes in future.\n\nThe PROFOUND Database for evaluating vegetation models and simulating climate impacts on European forests\n\nChristopher P.

Due to their complexity, they require careful parameterization and evaluation to ensure that projections are accurate and reliable. The PROFOUND Database provides a wide range of empirical data to calibrate and evaluate vegetation models that simulate climate impacts at the forest stand scale to support systematic model intercomparisons and model development in Europe.\n\nSensitivity of hydrologic and geologic parameters on recharge processes in a highly heterogeneous, semi-confined aquifer system\n\nStephen R. Maples, Laura Foglia, Graham E. Fogg, and Reed M. Maxwell\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 24, 2437–2456, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-24-2437-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-24-2437-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this study, we use a combination of local- and global-sensitivity analyses to evaluate the relative importance of (1) the configuration of subsurface alluvial geology and (2) the hydraulic properties of geologic facies on recharge processes. Results show that there is a large variation of recharge rates possible in a typical alluvial aquifer system and that the configuration proportion of sand and gravel deposits in the subsurface have a large impact on recharge rates.\n\nQuantifying the impacts of human water use and climate variations on recent drying of Lake Urmia basin: the value of different sets of spaceborne and in situ data for calibrating a global hydrological model\n\nSeyed-Mohammad Hosseini-Moghari, Shahab Araghinejad, Mohammad J. Tourian, Kumars Ebrahimi, and Petra DÃ¶ll\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 24, 1939–1956, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-24-1939-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-24-1939-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper uses a multi-objective approach for calibrating the WGHM model to determine the role of human water use and climate variations in the recent loss of water storage in Lake Urmia basin, Iran. We found that even without human water use Lake Urmia would not have recovered from the significant loss of lake water volume caused by the drought year 2008.\n\nHistorical and future changes in global flood magnitude â evidence from a modelâobservation investigation\n\nHong Xuan Do, Fang Zhao, Seth Westra, Michael Leonard, Lukas Gudmundsson, Julien Eric Stanislas Boulange, Jinfeng Chang, Philippe Ciais, Dieter Gerten, Simon N.

Streamflow simulations over 2006–2099 period robustly project high flood hazard in several regions. These high-flood-risk areas, however, are under-sampled by the current global streamflow databases.\n\nSimulating coupled surfaceâsubsurface flows with ParFlow v3.5.0: capabilities, applications, and ongoing development of an open-source, massively parallel, integrated hydrologic model\n\nBenjamin N.
