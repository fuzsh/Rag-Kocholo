        "text": "Tottenham Hotspur have reportedly made a huge step in their mission to secure Dominic Solanke’s signature as their new striker, this summer. Bournemouth will do their best efforts to prevent this.\n\n‘Green Light’: Dominic Solanke Wants Tottenham Hotspur Move\n\nTalks Underway Between Clubs\n\nAfter he previously reported that Tottenham have an interest in Solanke, Fabrizio Romano has revealed that this saga has taken a further step towards completion. The player himself has given a “green light” to the club as this move appeals to him. This is largely unsurprising, as the 26-year-old missed out on the Euro 2024 squad for England despite netting 19 in the league. A move to North London may aid him in his search for international minutes.\n\nRead More: Tottenham Attacking Starlet Pens First Professional Deal With Club\n\nThere are also “talks underway” with Bournemouth, as Spurs push to get this deal done. However, Alex Crook did reveal that the Cherries are “determined not to sell for any less” than the £65 million release clause that is in the player’s contract. It seems that negotiations may be futile; Tottenham could just end up spending the asking fee.\n\nSolanke Fills the Gap at Tottenham\n\nSolanke would be a huge acquisition for Ange Postecoglou’s side; he fills a huge gap that has been there since Harry Kane’s departure last summer.\n\nRead More: ‘Fantastic’ Tottenham Hotspur ‘Ace’ Makes Huge Claim About His Future Ambitions\n\nBournemouth’s bagsman truly is the “perfect” striker. He has mastered almost every finish, able to score the easy goals, but also very adept with his head, and known for his signature back-heel flick. Aside from this, he would benefit the system massively as a central focal point that they have been missing with no out-and-out number nine at the club.\n\nHis hold-up play is excellent and would allow Tottenham to play efficiently in transition. Furthermore, Solanke will often create chances for his teammates, an important trait at a Big Six club. He would excel for the Lilywhites and take them one step closer to Champions League football."
