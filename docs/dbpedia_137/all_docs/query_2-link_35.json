Close aboard means near a ship.\n\nAccommodation ladder\n\nA portable flight of steps down a ship's side.\n\nAdmiral\n\nSenior naval officer of Flag rank. In ascending order of seniority, Rear Admiral, Vice Admiral, Admiral and Admiral of the Fleet (Royal Navy). Derivation reputedly Arabic, from \"Emir al Bath\" (\"Ruler of the waters\").\n\nAdmiralty law\n\nBody of law that deals with maritime cases. In UK administered by the Probate, Divorce and Admiralty Division of the High Court of Justice.\n\nAdrift\n\nAfloat and unattached in any way to the shore or seabed. It may also imply that a vessel is not anchored and not under control, therefore goes where the wind and current take her, (loose from moorings, or out of place). Also refers to any gear not fastened down or put away properly. It can also be used to mean \"absent without leave\".\n\nAft\n\nTowards the stern (of the vessel).\n\nAground\n\nResting on or touching the ground or bottom.\n\nAhead\n\nForward of the bow.\n\nAhoy\n\nA cry to draw attention.

Two such lights are displayed by a ship over 150 feet (46 m) in length.\n\nAnchor watch\n\nMaking sure that the anchor is holding and the vessel is not drifting. Important during rough weather and at night. Most marine GPS units have an Anchor Watch alarm capability.\n\nArmament\n\nA ship's weapons.\n\nAshore\n\nOn the beach, shore or land.\n\nAstern\n\nToward the stern; an object or vessel that is abaft another vessel or object.\n\nAsylum Harbor\n\nA harbor used to provide shelter from a storm.\n\nASW\n\nAnti-submarine warfare.\n\nAthwart, athwartships\n\nAt right angles to the fore and aft or centerline of a ship.\n\nATON\n\nSee Aid to Navigation above and associated image.\n\nAvast\n\nStop!

Most often used to describe men whose living quarters are located here, officers being housed behind (abaft) the mast and enlisted men before the mast. This was because the midships area where the officers were berthed is more stable, being closer to the center of gravity, and thus more comfortable. It is less subject to the up and down movement resulting from the ship's pitching.\n\nBelaying pins\n\nBars of iron or hard wood to which running rigging may be secured, or belayed.\n\nBerth\n\nA bed on a boat, or a space in a port or harbour where a vessel can be tied up.\n\nBest bower (anchor)\n\nThe larger of two anchors carried in the bow; so named as it was the last, best hope.\n\nBilge\n\nThe bilge is the compartment at the bottom of the hull of a ship or boat where water collects so that it may be pumped out of the vessel at a later time.\n\nBilged on her anchor\n\nA ship that has run upon her own anchor.\n\nBimini\n\nWeather-resistant fabric stretched over a stainless steel frame, fastened above the cockpit of a sailboat or flybridge of a power yacht which serves as a rain or sun shade.\n\nBimmy\n\nA punitive instrument.\n\nBinnacle\n\nThe stand on which the ship's compass is mounted.\n\nBinnacle list\n\nA ship's sick list.

The last part of a rope or cable.\n\nBloody\n\nAn intensive derived from the substantive 'blood', a name applied to the Bucks, Scrowers, and Mohocks of the seventeenth centuries.\n\nBlue Peter\n\nA blue and white flag hoisted at the foretrucks of ships about to sail.\n\nBoat\n\nA craft or vessel designed to float on, and provide transport over, water.\n\nBoatswain or bosun\n\nA non-commissioned officer responsible for the sails, ropes and boats on a ship who issues \"piped\" commands to seamen.\n\nBollard\n\nFrom \"bol\" or \"bole\", the round trunk of a tree. A substantial vertical pillar to which lines may be made fast.

The boom vang adds an element of control to mainsail shape when the mainsheet is let out enough that it no longer pulls the boom down. Boom vang tension helps control leech twist, a primary component of sail power.\n\nBottomry\n\nPledging a ship as security in a financial transaction.\n\nBuoy\n\nA floating object of defined shape and color, which is anchored at a given position and serves as an aid to navigation.\n\nBow\n\nThe front of a ship.\n\nBow-chaser, chase or chase-piece\n\nA long gun with a relatively small bore, placed in the bow-port to fire directly ahead. Used especially while chasing an enemy vessel to damage its sails and rigging. (quoted from A Sea of Words).\n\nBowline\n\nA type of knot, producing a strong loop of a fixed size, topologically similar to a sheet bend. Also a rope attached to the side of a sail to pull it towards the bow (for keeping the windward edge of the sail steady).\n\nBowse\n\nTo pull or hoist.\n\nBowsprit\n\nA spar projecting from the bow used as an anchor for the forestay and other rigging.\n\nBrail\n\nTo furl or truss a sail by pulling it in towards the mast, or the ropes used to do so.\n\nBrass monkeys or brass monkey weather\n\nVery cold weather, origin from the cannon balls being stored on a wheeled platform (monkey) made of brass. If the weather was so cold as to cause cannon balls to fall off the brass monkey due to different shrinkage rates of the dissimilar metals it was termed to be cold enough to freeze the balls off a brass monkey.\n\nBridge\n\nA structure above the weather deck, extending the full width of the vessel, which houses a command centre, itself called by association, the bridge.\n\nBring to\n\nCause a ship to be stationary by arranging the sails.\n\nBroaching-to\n\nA sudden movement in navigation, when the ship, while scudding before the wind, accidentally turns her leeward side to windward, also use to describe the point when water starts to come over the gunwhale due to this turn.\n\nBuffer\n\nThe chief bosun's mate (in the Royal Navy), responsible for discipline.\n\nBulkhead\n\nAn upright wall within the hull of a ship. Particularly a load bearing wall.\n\nBulwark\n\nThe extension of the ship's side above the level of the weather deck.\n\nBumboat\n\nA private boat selling goods.\n\nBumpkin\n\nAn iron bar (projecting out-board from a ship's side) to which the lower and topsail brace blocks are sometimes hooked.

Equivalent to (UK) 1/10 nautical mile, approx. 600 feet; (USA) 120 fathoms, 720 feet (219 m); other countries use different values.\n\nCanister\n\na type of anti personnel cannon load in which lead balls or other loose metallic items were enclosed in a tin or iron shell. On firing the shell would disintegrate releasing the smaller metal objects.\n\nCape Horn fever\n\nThe name of the fake illness a malingerer is pretending to suffer from.\n\nCapsize\n\nWhen a ship or boat lists too far and rolls over, exposing the keel. On large vessels, this often results in the sinking of the ship.\n\nCapstan\n\nA huge rotating hub (wheel) mounted vertically and provided with horizontal holes to take up the capstan bars (when manually rotated), used to wind in anchors or other heavy objects; and sometimes to administer flogging over.\n\nCaptain's daughter\n\nThe cat o' nine tails, which in principle is only used on board on the captain's (or a court martial's) personal orders.\n\nCareening\n\nCause the ship to tilt on its side, usually to clean or repair the hull below the water line.\n\nCat\n\nTo prepare an anchor, after raising it by lifting it with a tackle to the Cat Head, prior to securing (fishing) it alongside for sea. (An anchor raised to the Cat Head is said to be catted).\n\nThe Cat o' Nine Tails (see below).\n\nA cat-rigged boat or catboat.\n\nCatamaran\n\nA vessel with two hulls.\n\nCatboat\n\nA cat-rigged vessel with only one sail, usually on a gaff.\n\nCat o' nine tails\n\nA short nine-tailed whip kept by the bosun's mate to flog sailors (and soldiers in the Army). When not in use, the cat was kept in a baize bag, hence the term \"cat out of the bag\". \"Not enough room to swing a cat\" also derives from this.\n\nCat Head\n\nA beam extending out from the hull used to support an anchor when raised in order to secure or \"fish\" it.\n\nCentreboard\n\nA removable keel used to resist leeway.\n\nChafing\n\nWear on line or sail caused by constant rubbing against another surface.\n\nChafing Gear\n\nMaterial applied to a line or spar to prevent or reduce chafing. See Baggywrinkle.\n\nChain shot\n\nCannon balls linked with chain used to damage rigging and masts.\n\nChain-wale or channel\n\nA broad, thick plank that projects horizontally from each of a ship's sides abreast a mast, distinguished as the fore, main, or mizzen channel accordingly, serving to extend the base for the shrouds, which supports the mast.\n\nChase guns\n\nCannons mounted on the bow or stern. Those on the bow could be used to fire upon a ship ahead, while those on the rear could be used to ward off pursuing vessels.\n\nChine\n\nA relatively sharp angle in the hull, as compared to the rounded bottoms of most traditional boat hulls.\n\nChock-a-block\n\nRigging blocks that are so tight against one another that they cannot be further tightened.\n\nCivil Red Ensign\n\nThe British Naval Ensign or Flag of the British Merchant Navy, a red flag with the Union Flag in the upper left corner.\n\nClean bill of health\n\nA certificate issued by a port indicating that the ship carries no infectious diseases.\n\nClean slate\n\nAt the helm, the watch keeper would record details of speed, distances, headings, etc. on a slate. At the beginning of a new watch the slate would be wiped clean.\n\nCleat\n\nA stationary device used to secure a rope aboard a vessel.\n\nClew-lines\n\nUsed to truss up the clews, the lower corners of square sails.\n\nClub\n\nhauling The ship drops one of its anchors at high speed to turn abruptly. This was sometimes used as a means to get a good firing angle on a pursuing vessel.\n\nCoaming\n\nThe raised edge of a hatchway used to help keep out water.\n\nCompanionway\n\nA raised and windowed hatchway in the ship's deck, with a ladder leading below and the hooded entrance-hatch to the main cabins.\n\nCompass\n\nNavigational instrument that revolutionised travel.\n\nCorrector\n\na device to correct the ship's compass.\n\nCourses\n\nThe mainsail, foresail, and the mizzen.\n\nCoxswain or cockswain\n\nThe helmsman or crew member in command of a boat.\n\nAs the crow flies\n\nA direct line between two points (which might cross land) which is the way crows travel rather than ships which must go around land.\n\nCrow's nest\n\nSpecifically a masthead constructed with sides and sometimes a roof to shelter the lookouts from the weather, generally by whaling vessels, this term has become a generic term for what is properly called masthead. See masthead.\n\nCuddy\n\nA small cabin in a boat.\n\nCunningham\n\nA line invented by Briggs Cunningham, used to control the shape of a sail.\n\nCut splice\n\nA join between two lines, similar to an eye-splice, where each rope end is joined to the other a short distance along, making an opening which closes under tension.\n\nCutline\n\nThe \"valley\" between the strands of a rope or cable.\n\nCut and run\n\nWhen wanting to make a quick escape, a ship might cut lashings to sails or cables for anchors, causing damage to the rigging, or losing an anchor, but shortening the time needed to make ready by bypassing the proper procedures.\n\nCut of his jib\n\nThe \"cut\" of a sail refers to its shape. Since this would vary between ships, it could be used both to identify a familiar vessel at a distance, and to judge the possible sailing qualities of an unknown one.\n\nD - [Back to top]\n\nDaggerboard\n\nA type of centerboard that is removed vertically.\n\nDavy Jones (Locker)\n\nAn idiom for the bottom of the sea.\n\nDaybeacon\n\nAn unlighted fixed structure which is equipped with a dayboard for daytime identification.\n\nDayboard\n\nThe daytime identifier of an aid to navigation presenting one of several standard shapes (square, triangle, rectangle) and colors (red, green, white, orange, yellow, or black).\n\nDeadeye\n\nA round wooden plank which serves a similar purpose to a block in the standing rigging of large sailing vessels.\n\nDeadrise\n\nThe design angle between the keel (q.v.) and horizontal.\n\nDecks\n\nthe structures forming the approximately horizontal surfaces in the ship's general structure. Unlike flats, they are a structural part of the ship.\n\nDeck hand\n\nA person whose job involves aiding the deck supervisor in (un)mooring, anchoring, maintenance, and general evolutions on deck.\n\nDeck supervisor\n\nThe person in charge of all evolutions and maintenance on deck; sometimes split into two groups: forward deck supervisor, aft deck supervisor.\n\nDeckhead\n\nThe under-side of the deck above. Sometimes paneled over to hide the pipe work. This paneling, like that lining the bottom and sides of the holds, is the ceiling.\n\nDerrick\n\nA lifting device composed of one mast or pole and a boom or jib which is hinged freely at the bottom.\n\nDevil seam\n\nThe curved seam in the hull planking closest to the waterline when the ship is level. The seam between these two planks, set at a nominal right angle to each other, is the devil seam. This seam is particularly difficult to pay (and caulk) because there is little support in the direction of the compression created during caulking and expansion of the wood when wet. Hence, this seam \"works\" a lot. A sailor sealing this seam must first cause the ship to list (lean) toward the side opposite of the seam. This allows the sailor access to the seam by hanging below it, \"between the Devil and the deep blue sea\".\n\nDevil to pay (or Devil to pay, and no pitch hot)\n\n\"Paying\" the Devil is sealing the devil seam. It is a difficult and unpleasant job (with no resources) because of the shape of the seam (closest to the waterline) and because you are positioned below the natural waterline.\n\nDirectional light\n\nA light illuminating a sector or very narrow angle and intended to mark a direction to be followed.\n\nDisrate\n\nTo reduce in rank or rating; demote.\n\nDog watch\n\nA short watch period, generally half the usual time (e.g. a two hour watch between two four hour ones). Such a watch might be included in order to slowly rotate the system over several days for fairness, or to allow both watches to eat their meals at approximately normal times.\n\nDolphin\n\nA structure consisting of a number of piles driven into the seabed or riverbed in a circular pattern and drawn together with wire rope.\n\nDownhaul\n\nA line used to control either a mobile spar, or the shape of a sail.\n\nDraft\n\nThe depth of a ship's keel below the waterline.\n\nDraught\n\nSee draft.\n\nDressing down\n\nTreating old sails with oil or wax to renew them, or a verbal reprimand.\n\nDriver\n\nThe large sail flown from the mizzen gaff.\n\nDriver-mast\n\nThe fifth mast of a six-masted barquentine or gaff schooner. It is preceded by the jigger mast and followed by the spanker mast. The sixth mast of the only seven-masted vessel, the gaff schooner Thomas W. Lawson, was normally called the pusher-mast.\n\nDunnage\n\nLoose packing material used to protect a ship's cargo from damage during transport. Personal baggage.\n\nE - [Back to top]\n\nEarrings\n\nSmall lines, by which the uppermost corners of the largest sails are secured to the yardarms.\n\nEmbayed\n\nThe condition where a sailing vessel is confined between two capes or headlands, typically where the wind is blowing directly onshore.\n\nExtremis (also known as “in extremis”)\n\nThe point under International Rules of the Road (Navigation Rules) at which the privileged (or stand-on) vessel on collision course with a burdened (or give-way) vessel determines it must maneuver to avoid a collision. Prior to extremis, the privileged vessel must maintain course and speed and the burdened vessel must maneuver to avoid collision.\n\nF - [Back to top]\n\nFathom\n\nA unit of length equal to 6 feet (1.8 m), roughly measured as the distance between a man's outstretched hands.\n\nFender\n\nAn air or foam filled bumper used in boating to keep boats from banging into docks or each other.\n\nFigurehead\n\nSymbolic image at the head of a traditional sailing ship or early steamer.\n\nFireship\n\nA ship loaded with flammable materials and explosives and sailed into an enemy port or fleet either already burning or ready to be set alight by its crew (who would then abandon it) in order to collide with and set fire to enemy ships.\n\nFirst rate\n\nThe classification for the largest sailing warships of the 17th through 19th centuries. They had 3 masts, 850+ crew and 100+ guns.\n\nFish\n\nTo repair a mast or spar with a fillet of wood.\n\nTo secure an anchor on the side of the ship for sea (otherwise known as \"catting\".)\n\nFirst Lieutenant\n\nIn the Royal Navy, the senior lieutenant on board; responsible to the Commander for the domestic affairs of the ship's company. Also known as 'Jimmy the One' or 'Number One'. Removes his cap when visiting the mess decks as token of respect for the privacy of the crew in those quarters. Officer i/c cables on the forecastle. In the U.S. Navy the senior person in charge of all Deck hands.\n\nFirst Mate\n\nThe Second in command of a ship.\n\nFlag hoist\n\nA number of signal flags strung together to convey a message, e.g. \"England expects...\".\n\nFlank\n\nThe maximum speed of a ship. Faster than \"full speed\".\n\nFlatback\n\nA Great Lakes slang term for a vessel without any self unloading equipment.\n\nFlemish Coil\n\nA line coiled around itself to neaten the decks or dock.\n\nFlog\n\nTo beat, to punish.\n\nFluke\n\nThe wedge-shaped part of an anchor's arms that digs into the bottom.\n\nFly by night\n\nA large sail used only for sailing downwind, requiring little attention.\n\nFollowing sea\n\nWave or tidal movement going in the same direction as a ship.\n\nFoot\n\nThe bottom of a sail.\n\nFootloose\n\nIf the foot of a sail is not secured properly, it is footloose, blowing around in the wind.\n\nFootrope\n\nEach yard on a square rigged sailing ship is equipped with a footrope for sailors to stand on while setting or stowing the sails.\n\nForecastle\n\nA partial deck, above the upper deck and at the head of the vessel; traditionally the sailors living quarters. Pronounced \"focsle\". The name is derived from the castle fitted to bear archers in time of war.\n\nFounder\n\nTo fill with water and sink → Wiktionary.\n\nFore\n\nTowards the bow (of the vessel).\n\nForefoot\n\nThe lower part of the stem of a ship.\n\nForemast jack\n\nAn enlisted sailor, one who is housed before the foremast.\n\nForestays\n\nLong lines or cables, reaching from the front of the vessel to the mast heads, used to support the mast.\n\nFreeboard\n\nThe height of a ship's hull (excluding superstructure) above the waterline. The vertical distance from the current waterline to the lowest point on the highest continuous watertight deck.

To form an eye or a knot by splicing.\n\nSquare meal\n\nA sufficient quantity of food. Meals on board ship were served to the crew on a square wooden plate in harbor or at sea in good weather. Food in the Royal Navy was invariably better or at least in greater quantity than that available to the average landsman. However, while square wooden plates were indeed used on board ship, there is no established link between them and this particular term. The OED gives the earliest reference from the U.S. in the mid 19th century.\n\nSquared away\n\nYards held rigidly perpendicular to their masts and parallel to the deck. This was rarely the best trim of the yards for efficiency but made a pretty sight for inspections and in harbor. The term is applied to situations and to people figuratively to mean that all difficulties have been resolved or that the person is performing well and is mentally and physically prepared.\n\nSquat effect\n\nIs the phenomenon by which a vessel moving quickly through shallow water creates an area of lowered pressure under its keel that reduces the ship's buoyancy, particularly at the bow. The reduced buoyancy causes the ship to \"squat\" lower in the water than would ordinarily be expected.\n\nStanding rigging\n\nRigging which is used to support masts and spars, and is not normally manipulated during normal operations. Cf. running rigging.\n\nStarboard\n\nTowards the right-hand side of a vessel facing forward. Denoted with a green light at night.

See teazer, togey.\n\nStay\n\nRigging running fore (forestay) and aft (backstay) from a mast to the hull.\n\nStaysail\n\nA sail whose luff is attached to a forestay.\n\nSteering oar or steering board\n\nA long, flat board or oar that went from the stern to well underwater, used to control the vessel in the absence of a rudder.\n\nStem\n\nThe extension of keel at the forward of a ship.\n\nStern\n\nThe rear part of a ship, technically defined as the area built up over the sternpost, extending upwards from the counter to the taffrail.\n\nStern tube\n\nThe tube under the hull to bear the tailshaft for propulsion (usually at stern).\n\nStonnacky\n\nA punitive device.\n\nStrake\n\nOne of the overlapping boards in a clinker built hull.\n\nStudding-sails (pronounced \"stunsail\")\n\nLong and narrow sails, used only in fine weather, on the outside of the large square sails.\n\nSurge\n\nA vessel's transient motion in a fore and aft direction.\n\nSway\n\nA vessel's motion from side to side. Also used as a verb meaning to hoist. \"Sway up my dunnage.\"\n\nSwigging\n\nTo take up the last bit of slack on a line such as a halyard, anchor line or dockline by taking a single turn round a cleat and alternately heaving on the rope above and below the cleat while keeping the tension on the tail.\n\nSwinging the compass\n\nMeasuring the accuracy in a ship's magnetic compass so its readings can be adjusted – often by turning the ship and taking bearings on reference points.\n\nSwinging the lamp\n\nTelling sea stories. Referring to lamps slung from the deckhead which swing while at sea. Often used to indicate that the story teller is exaggerating.\n\nSwinging the lead\n\nMeasuring the depth of water beneath a ship using a lead-weighted sounding line. A sailor who was feigning illness etc to avoid a hard job was said to be \"swinging the lead\".\n\nT - [Back to top]\n\nTailshaft\n\nA kind of metallic shafting (a rod of metal) to hold the propeller and connected to the power engine. When the tailshaft is moved, the propeller may also be moved for propulsion.\n\nTack (verb)\n\n\"What is does it mean to perform a tack?\": A tack is a maneuver where the boat is turned so that the bow of the boat passes through an imaginary line to where the wind comes from. At some point during the turn, the boat will be pointing directly into the wind. Tacking is the act of perfoming a tack.\n\nTack (noun)\n\n\"What is a tack?\": The term \"tack\" also refers to the lower forward corner of a sail.\n\nTack - a starboard tack or a port tack\n\n\"Which tack are you on?\": The term \"starboard tack\" refers to sailboat sailing where the wind is coming from the starboard (right) side of the boat. The term \"port tack\" refers to sailboat sailing where the wind is coming from the port (left) side of the boat.\n\nTaking the wind out of his sails\n\nTo sail in a way that steals the wind from another ship. cf. overbear.\n\nTally\n\nThe operation of hauling aft the sheets, or drawing them in the direction of the ship's stern.\n\nTeazer\n\nA rope used as a punitive device.\n\nThree sheets to the wind\n\nOn a three-masted ship, having the sheets of the three lower courses loose will result in the ship meandering aimlessly downwind. Also, a sailor who has drunk strong spirits beyond his capacity.\n\nTimoneer\n\nFrom the French timonnier, is a name given, on particular occasions, to the steersman of a ship.\n\nToe the line or Toe the mark\n\nAt parade, sailors and soldiers were required to stand in line, their toes in line with a seam of the deck.\n\nTogey\n\nA rope used as a punitive device.\n\nTopmast\n\nThe second section of the mast above the deck; formerly the upper mast, later surmounted by the topgallant mast; carrying the topsails.\n\nTopgallant\n\nThe mast or sails above the tops.\n\nTopsail\n\nThe second sail (counting from the bottom) up a mast. These may be either square sails or fore-and-aft ones, in which case they often \"fill in\" between the mast and the gaff of the sail below.\n\nTopsides\n\nThe part of the hull between the waterline and the deck. Also, Above-water hull.\n\nTouch and go\n\nThe bottom of the ship touching the bottom, but not grounding.\n\nTowing\n\nThe operation of drawing a vessel forward by means of long lines.\n\nTrackLink\n\nNauticEds GPS Tracking App for students logbooks.\n\nTravellers\n\nSmall fittings that slide on a rod or line.

Ships, boats, personal water craft.\n\nWeather gage\n\nFavorable position over another sailing vessel to with respect to the wind.\n\nWeatherhelm\n\nIf the helm was centered, the boat would turn towards the wind (weather). Consequently, the tiller must be pulled to the windward side of the boat in order to make the boat sail in a straight line. See leehelm.\n\nWeather deck\n\nWhichever deck is that exposed to the weather – usually either the main deck or, in larger vessels, the upper deck.\n\nWeather side\n\nThe weather side of a ship is the side exposed to the wind.\n\nWeatherly\n\nA ship that is easily sailed and maneuvered; makes little leeway when sailing to windward.\n\nWeigh anchor\n\nTo heave up (an anchor) preparatory to sailing.\n\nWells\n\nPlaces in the ship's hold for the pumps.\n\nWhite Horses\n\nWaves in wind strong enough to produce foam or spray on the wave tops.\n\nWheelhouse\n\nLocation on a ship where the steering wheel is located, often interchanged with pilothouse and bridge.\n\nWide berth\n\nTo leave room between two ships moored (berthed) to allow space for maneuver.\n\nWindage\n\nWind resistance of the boat.\n\nWindbound\n\nA condition wherein the ship is detained in one particular station by contrary winds.\n\nWindward\n\nIn the direction that the wind is coming from.\n\nWindlass\n\nA winch mechanism, usually with a horizontal axis.
