BEVERLEY : JOHN GREEN, MARKET PLACE. MDCCCISIV. ENTERED AT STATIONERS' HALL. HIS PREFACE During the last quarter of the eighteenth century two Histories of Hull, in thick quarto volumes, by George Hadley, Esq., and the Rev. John Tickell, respectively, were published. Since the opening of the present century, the Town has been not only almost rebuilt, but it has been much more than doubled in size ; and, notwith- standing this, I have ventured upon writing a history of the place — a condensed one of necessity — in a small volume of about 700 pages. How I have succeeded, my readers must determine. The narrow limits of the work obliged me to relinquish the higher functions of the historian, and to content myself with the simple part of the careful chronicler, recording little more than dry details of events of a remarkable character, and the facts connected with the origin and present state of the Town and its public institutions. For this reason I have seldom given expression to any opinion of my own. The imperative necessity of accuracy, and the great labour and time involved in preparing the work for the press, has rendered its production somewhat tardy ; but my Subscribers have been gainers by this, for the delay has afforded time to verify the correctness of almost every statement. To secure authenticity, I have used the most unremitting endeavours ; and I have taken every possible care •L^'O'^C/'U'\"^ ENGLISH LOCAL IV PREFACE. to avoid the mistakes, and profit by the experience of my prede- cessors in this particular line of literature ; and so, without claiming immunity from error, I have good ground for hoping that this volume will be found as accurate, and as free from the many blemishes which disfigure some of our best authorities, as is com- patible with the vast body of matter, and the diversity of subjects compressed within its pages. The several Clergymen and Gentlemen of the Town, who have very kindly aided me with valuable information, will here permit the expression of my gratitude ; and to my numerous Subscribers, I most respectfully dedicate the work. J. O . b. Hull, June, 1864. HISTORY OF HULL. Kingston-upon-Hull, or as it is commonly called Hull, is a parliamentary and municipal borough, and market-town, and one of the principal sea-ports in the British empire. It is, with its precincts, a town and county, locally situated in the East Riding of Yorkshire, on the south-eastern extremity of the Hunsley Beacon division of the Wapentake of Harthill. The town stands on an angular point of land on the northern shore of the noble estuary of the Humber, and on the western bank of the river Hull; and comprises the parishes of the Holy Trinity, St. Mary, Sculcoates, and Drypool, part of the parish of Sutton, and the extra-parochial district of Garrison Side. By the turnpike roads the place is distant from London, 171 miles N. ; from York, 38 miles S.E. ; from Leeds, 54 miles E. ; from Lincoln, 41 miles N. ; from Doncaster, 49 miles N.E. ; from Beverley, 9 miles S. ; from Bridlington, 31 miles S. ; from Hedon, 5+ miles W. ; from Patrington, 16 miles N.W. ; from Hornsea, 16 miles S. by W. ; from Manchester, 94 miles E. by N. ; from Edin- burgh, 242 miles S.E.; from Glasgow, 258 miles S.E.; and from Dublin, by way of Liverpool, 250 miles — 120 miles of the distance being by sea. The distance from Hull to the following towns, by railway, is as follows: — to London 214J miles via Milford-j unction, and 175 miles via New Holland ; to York 53+ miles (by water 80 miles) ; to Leeds 55+ miles ; to Lincoln, via New Holland, 45+ miles ; to Selby 30+ miles; to Scarborough 53+ miles; to Sheffield 69 miles; to Man- B 2 HISTORY OF KINGSTON-UPON-HUIX. Chester 99 miles via Milford-j unction, and 111 miles via New Holland ; to Edinburgh 262 miles via York ; and to Glasgow 309 miles via York. Hull is in 53 degrees 45 minutes north latitude, and 0 degrees 16 minutes west longitude. The population of this place has increased immensely since the commencement of the present century. In 1801 the aggregate number of the inhabitants was 29,849 ; in 1811 that number had swelled to 37,466 ; and in 1821 to 41,420. In the year 1841, the population of the borough numbered 65,670 souls ; and in 1851 the number was 84,690. On the 8th of April, 1861, the population of the municipal and parliamentary borough of Kingston-upon-Hull numbered 98,994 souls; and the number of inhabited houses in the borough at the same period was 20,581. In the year 1861, the population of England and Wales, with the Isle of Man and Channel Islands, including the army and navy at home, amounted in number to 20,209,671. The increase in England and Wales since the census of 1851, was 2,138,615, tbough in the interval about 640,300 persons emigrated. Between the years 1851 and 1861, the male population of England and Wales increased 11-33 per cent., and the female population 12-50 per cent. On the last census night there were, in England and Wales 124,962 per- sons in workhouses, 13,456 in hospitals, 24,207 in lunatic asylums, 26,395 in prisons and reformatories, and 23,598 in orphan asylums and other principal charitable institutions. According to the Twenty-fourth Annual Report of the Registrar General, issued in April, 1863, the progress of population in England in the last quarter of a century, may thus be stated roundly : — Each quin-quennial period added a million, or a little more, to the account. The noble river Humber, upon the banks of -which the town of Kingston-upon-Hull is seated, may be considered the Thames of the midland and northern counties of England. It divides the East Biding of Yorkshire from Lincolnshire, during the whole of its course, and is formed by the junction of the Ouse and Trent. At Bromfleet it receives the little river Foulness, and rolling its vast collection of waters eastward, in a stream enlarged to between two and three miles in breadth, washes the town of Hull, where it re- ceives the river of the same name. Opposite to Hedon and Paull, which are a few miles below Hull, the Humber widens into a vast estuary, six or seven miles in breadth, and then directs its course past Great Grimsby, to the German Ocean, which it enters at Spurn Head. No other river system collects waters from so many points,* and connects so many importaut towns as this famous stream. \" The Humber (says a recent writer), resembling the trunk of a vast tree spreading its branches in every direction, com- mands, by the numerous rivers which it receives, the navigation and trade of a very extensive and commercial part of England.\" According to Camden, Ptolemy calls this river the estuary A bus ; and that quaint old author, Lambard, writes thus : — \" Humber is not the name of any one water within Inglande, but is a name that is gyven to the metinge of many waters, and therefore Lelande con- tendeth reasonablye that it should be called Aber, which in the Bryttishe is the same that the Saxons and we nowe calle the mouthe of a ryver; for it hathe not the name of Humber till it approche neare Kingston-on-Hull, before which tyme it hathe receyved Ouse, Ure, Done, Trent, Hull water, and some other smal brokes, and so openeth into the sea ; and therefore Humber hathe not as a ryver of itselfe anye begginninge (as Polydor and others describe), but * The rivers Ouse and Trent which united form the Humher, receive the waters of the Aire, Calder, Don, Old Don, Derwent, Idle, Sheaf, Soar, Nidd, Ure or Yore, Wharfe, &c. 4 HISTORY OF KTNGSTOX-UPON-HUTX. may wel inoughe be said to begynne withe the head of any of those ryvers \"which it receyveth. It should seme that Ptolemy meut this ryver when he speaketh of Abus, so callinge the same that the Bryttons called Aber. Geffrey of Moumouthe, the leader of our Iuglishe Chroniclers, sayeth that it was called Humber by occasion that Locrine, the eldest sou of Brutus, chased Humber, the Kinge of the Hunnes (that arryved in his country) into this water, wheare he was drowned. Dum fugit obstat ei flumen, submergitur illic, Deque suo tribuit nomine nomen aquae. After that the Saxons weare come in great nomber into this ile, they fel at variance among themselves, in so much that Ethelbert, Kinge of Kent (which receyved Augustine), warringe upon the rest, en- larged his dominion to this water; herof began the people beyonde the same to be called Northumbers, and their Kingdome Northum- berland. This ryver, and the Thamis (as Polydor observeth), do not so comonly overflowe their banks, as other waters within the realme, which he imputeth probablye to the qualitie of the ground underneathe, which being gravel soketh muche ; but the cause of the groweth no lesse, by reason that theise twoe waters be not neighboured with so many hilles, as Severn and others be, from which every sodeiue rayne descendinge into the ryvers, causeth theim to swell sodenlye also.\" Thomas Walton, Esq. (surgeon), of Hull, wrote a series of in- teresting papers called \"Loose Leaves from the History of the Humber,\" which appeared in the Hull Advertiser newspaper, in 1857 ; and in the first of those papers, the author says, \"Amongst the streams whose names are bound up with eras in the history of their fatherland, none are of greater local interest than the noble Humber. Many a time has it borne upon its surface the strange and unwelcome ships of foreign foes ; and often have the souuds of strife and angry war been wafted across its waters. It has been the witness of bloody frays between Dane and Saxon — of deadly feuds amongst English Barons — of peaceful revels and royal pa- geants— and it is liuked with the secret sympathies of homes and hearts hidden far away amid the wolds and woods of its border HISTORY OF KINGSTON-UPON-HULL. 5 counties.\" And again he says, \" The Humber, during the lapse of centuries, has been gradually restrained by artificial embankments, and now assumes a distinct fluvial character. Formerly, however, it bore more the appearance of an arm of the sea, and extended twenty miles to the north of its present position, insulating a great portion of Holderness, and, as warp, depositing by degrees much of the best land in that rich district. It also covered the northern parts of Lincolnshire, and thus presented a surface of great extent. Nennius, writing in the eighth century, gives the Humber the name of a sea. He says in relation to one of the Kings of Deira, •Ida, the son of Eoppa, possessed countries on the left hand side of Britain, i. e., of the Humbrian Sen, and reigned twelve years.' ' No correct idea of the course of the channel of the Humber in ancient times, can now be formed, on account of the changes which have taken place. Mr. Walton is probably correct in his idea, that Paull, Kelsey Hill, Dimlington, and Keyingham, once formed a cluster of islands far to the south of the Yorkshire coast ; whilst, north and south for miles around, the \" Humbrian Sea \" extended ; and that in later days, the interstices between these islands were filled up and formed the district now called Holderness. After the Norman Conquest Holderness was represented as an island. The ravages of the sea and of the Humber on the shores of the peninsula of Holderness, have been so great in past ages, as to render it impossible, at the present time, to discover the foundations of several towns, which, from ancient records, are known to have existed in that part of Yorkshire. In many large tracts of lands which now adjoin the Humber, and the rivers which fall into it, the different strata of the earth show that great alterations have taken place on the surface of the country ; and that in many places, the earth which is buried several feet deep, has once been the matrix of vegetable productions, and the habitation of animals ; and that the superincumbent earth now under cultivation, has been brought to its present situation by the extraordinary flux of waters, or by other means of which history gives us no information. The most ancient place of fixed habitation in the southern part of Holderness appears to have been called variously Ravenser, Ra- vensrode, Ravensjmrne, and Ravemhurgh. This town is now totally 6 HISTORY OF KINGSTON-UPON-HULL. swallowed up by the Humber, and not the least mark of its existence can be discovered. Ravenspurne is supposed by some to have been the Pratorium of the Romans, but this must ever remain a disputed point. There is no question though, about Ravenspurne having been a borough, port, and market-town, of some consequence, and its situation appears to have been on the bank or margin of the Humber, within the Spurn Head, towards the south-east end of the Trinity Sands. Thomas Thompson, Esq., in his Historic Facts relative to Raven- spume (published in 1824), thinks it probable that the Danes, when they landed at the first sea-port which they found in the Humber, would fix on it their national standard, which bore the figure of a raven, and call the place Ravensburgh. Afterwards, in more Chris- tian times, a cross may have been erected there, and the termination burgh, the ancient Saxon name for a city, town, or fortified place, might be changed to rod or rode, a cross ; and thus the name would be Ravensrode. Subsequently the termination Spurne, a place from which to explore, or look out, might be adopted, and hence the name of Ravenspurne. But there is much confusion in the notices of this place in ancient writings, owing to their being more places than one bearing the name of Ravenser ; for it cannot be doubted that there were two distinct towns existing here at the same time, under the names of Old or Aid Ravenser and Ravensrod or Ravenser Odd. The former place is described as being in the parish of Kilnsea, and the latter in that of Easington. The Burgh of Odd was situated, as we have stated, between the sea and the river Humber, and was distant from the main land more than a mile. The access to it from Old Ravenser was by a sand road, covered with round yellow stones, and scarcely elevated above the sea. It was distant from Easington four miles, and between the two places stood the distinct towns of Kilnsea and Sunthorp, with the manor of Aid Ravenser. The history of Ravenser Odd is extremely singular, the short space of 150 years having witnessed its origin, its rise to celebrity as a sea-port, and its final destruction by the encroachments of the sea. Accordiug to the Meaux Chronicle it was originally a small island, formed by an accidental accumulation of sand and stones, in the reign of Henry III., and was at first only used by the fishermen to HISTORY OF KINGSTON-UPON-HULL. 7 dry their nets upon. In the reign of Edward I. Ravenser Odd began to assume the appearance of a commercial port, and it appears evident that it had sprung up as an offshot of Aid Ravenser. We must then presume that this is the place mentioned under the several names of Ravensrout, Ravensrod, Ravenserodd, Ravensrode, &c, for under these several names the port appears to have been desig- nated. In 1299 the merchants, or men, of this place obtained a charter of free burgage from the King, by which they were to have two markets every week within the burgh, and a fair every year, of thirty days duration. In 1355 the Abbot of Meaux was directed to gather up the bodies of the dead which had been buried in the chapel-yard of Ravenser, and which, by reason of inundations, were then washed up and un- covered, and to bury them in the church-yard of Easington. In 1361, in consequence of the continuance of these inundations, were obliged to remove to Hull and other places. About 1390, when the Book of Meaux was written, there was scarcely any trace of the site of Ravenser. Aid, or Old Ravenser, was situated on the main land, as stated, in the parish of Kilnsea; and it must have been a place of im- portance in the reign of Edward I., as it was called upon to send members to parliament. Old Ravenser was a place of celebrity before the new port sprung up, and so continued after its destruction. The river Humber continually holds in suspension a rich mass of alluvial matter. According to Professor Phillips, the average annual loss of land by the incursions of the sea, between Spurn and Brid- lington, is two and a quarter yards ; but the earth thus removed appears to be mostly carried on the constantly feculent waters of the Humber, and deposited on its shores, where, during the last century, many thousand acres of land have been recovered from the visitation of the tides, which still daily uncover in many parts of the river innumerable tracts of growing silt ; and in this manner has been formed the parish of Sunk Island, which has an area of nearly 7,000 acres, extending along the banks of the Humber (a few miles below Hull) a distance of about six and a half miles. It first appeared as a sand bank in the Humber, and soon became a small island, which in course of time has increased in size, until at length it was joined 8 HISTORY OF KINGSTON-UPON-HULL. to the main land of Holderness, by embankments and the accretion of warp, or sand and soil, deposited by the river. In the time of Charles I. the island contained about seven acres, and was then one and a half miles from the Yorkshire coast, having a navigable canal between it and the main land, through which ships of considerable burthen could pass.* The following is the substance of a communication kindly for- warded to us by Mr. James Oldham, of Hull (civil engineer), on the subject of two other islands in the Humber, one of which had existed a little above Brough, on the Yorkshire coast of the river, beyond the memory of men. This island had been formed by the deposits of the mud of the Humber, accumulating no doubt over a considerable period of time, and was oblong in shape, and contained of vegetable surface about 100 acres. It ran parallel with the coast line, and at high water the channel averaged about 500 yards in width. At low water spring tides there was little or no water in the channel, and the farmers of the neighbourhood were in the habit, * Sunk Island is a remarkable local instance of the action of powerful elements of change still working. From the Fifteenth Report of the Commissioners of H. M. Woods and Forests we learn that in 1668, this place, then described as containing 3,500 acres of \" drowned land,\" was first granted on lease to Colonel Anthony Gilby, Governor of Hull, for a term of 31 years, at a rent of =65. per annum, with a stipula- tion that the lessee should erect certain embankments. The lease was renewed to the Gilby family four times, on payment of large fines. The fourth renewal was made to Mrs. Margaret Gilby, in 1771, for a term expiring in 1802; on payment of a fine of =£1,550., and at a rent of £100. per aim. The estate was afterwards granted to the Pvev. John Lonsdale and others, in trust for the representatives of the original lessees, for a term of 31 years, at a rent of =€701. for the first year of the term ; and at the end of the term of this grant or lease (in 1833) the \" island \" was surveyed, and valued at =£9,814. per annum — there being then 5,929 acres in cultivation. At that time the under-tenants became separate lessees under the Crown. In addition to the 7,000 acres contained in Sunk Island, there are other accretions on its borders, but forming part of the main land, amounting to 3,000 acres more, giving a total of about 10,000 acres, formed since the time of King Charles, but chiefly so during the last eighty years. The last portion of Sunk Island was reclaimed from the Humber, and embanked (for the Crown) in 1850, under the direction of the Mr. Oldham, C.E., mentioned in the text, and amounted to about 700 acres. Mr. Oldham has informed us that between the eastern extremity of Sunk Island and the Spurn, the deposit is going on at a rapid rate, and that it is likely, before any great lapse of time, that a large portion of the now extensive bay on that portion of the Humber will be reclaimed, and rendered available for agricultural purposes. HISTORY OF KINQSTON-UPON-HULL. 9 during the summer season, of driving their cattle across it, to graze on the marine grasses. In the month of August, 1840, Mr. Oldham was directed by the Commissioners of Woods and Forests to examine and report upon this island, with the view of devising a mode of connecting it with the main land by means of a solid barrier or embankments con- structed across the channel, and thereby to induce the silting up of the whole extent of the water-way. When Mr. Oldham visited the spot, he found that an important change in the currents of the river had shortly before taken place ; that a considerable portion of the eastern extremity of the island had disappeared, and the remainder was rapidly following ; and that there was thirty feet of water in the channel, even at low water. \" Thus, from some unaccountable, but perhaps very slight cause (to use the language of our informant), a change had commenced, and in about the space of four months the whole island had disappeared, leaving on its site a comparatively deep channel. As the island disappeared, it was found that an immense shoal was forming at Whitton, on the opposite side of the Humber, which was only fully covered with water at spring tides. This shoal remained for a considerable time, but has gradually again disappeared, and in the present year (1863) the island is re-appearing on the old site.\" The other island mentioned in Mr. Oldham's information, has sprung up within his own time, and is called Reeds Island. It is situated about nine miles above Hull, on the Lincolnshire side of the Humber, and covers an area of between two and three hundred acres. The surface, which is valuable, is the property of the Crown. It is interesting to know, that whilst there are extensive accre- tions of new land continually going on, no changes of a sudden character take place in the channels and mud-banks below the town. Such changes are chiefly, and almost exclusively found to occur above the port of Hull. This is an important fact in con- nexion with the place as a sea-port. There is always an efficient navigable channel from the town to the ocean. The Humber, between its banks, occupies an area of about 125 square miles. 10 HISTORY OF KINGSTON-UPON-HULL. The river Hull rises in the eastern wolds near Driffield, and pursuing a southern course to the eastward of the town of Beverley (with which it is connected by a canal), it serves to drain the whole country between the wolds and the sea. At a very early period, long before the situation of the town of Hull attracted the attention of King Edward I., the river Hull experienced a change in its course as it neared the Humber. For the knowledge of this important fact, and much more that relates to the ancient history of the town and port of Hull, we are indebted to the industry and research of the late Charles Frost, Esq., F.S.A. — a learned member of the legal profession at Hull — who wrote an excellent work entitled \" Notices Pielative to the Early History of the Town and Port of Hull \" (4to, 1827). Down to the date of the publication of Mr. Frost's \" Notices,\" all the historians of the port of Hull state that this river in former times discharged itself into the Humber to the eastward of the present channel, between Drypool and Marfleet ; but that gentleman found abundance of matter in the registers and histories of the Abbey of Meaux, to show that its ancient course lay to the westward of the present river; and he thinks that the frequent notice of Old Hull which occur, as one of the boundaries of lands without the walls to the westward of the town, would of itself be amply sufficient to establish the fact without the corroborative proof afforded by the Eegisters of Meaux, which are conclusive on the subject. Our author informs us that in them, the ancient river is described as having divided the Wapentakes of Holderness and Harthill ; that New Hull, which had formerly been called Sayer Creek, and had become a great river in conse- quence of the channel of Old Hull having warped up, was afterwards the dividing boundary of the districts of Holderness and Harthill ; and that a part of the village of Wyke or Hull, which had previously been within the limits of Holderness, being then separated by the river, became a member of the Wapentake of Harthill. In a charter of King Eichard II., that part of the stream which lies between \" Sculcotes Gote \"* and the Humber, is stated to have * Mr. Frost mentions the existence of a MS. History of Hull, eornpiled by the late William Chambers, Esq., M.D., in which the annals of the town are continued down to the year 1766. Mr. Frost says \" Sculcotes Gote ran into tlie river at some little HISTORY OF KINGSTON-UPON-HUIX. 11 been called Sayer Creek; and the historians tell us that it was originally cut by Sayer de Sutton (lord of Sutton) to drain the marshes within his manor of Sutton. Mr. Frost thinks that this is rendered plausible from the circumstance of similar ditches having been made through the common pasture of My ton and the adjacent towns, by William de Stutteville and Bennet de Sculcoates, during the reign of King John, when one of the Sutton family of the name of Saer was living. It is then very probable that so early as the reign of this monarch, Sayer Creek was cut for drainage purposes ; and though it must perhaps remain undecided whether the diver- sion of the course of the river was the result of accident or design, it is not unreasonable to suppose, from the frequent irruptions of the rivers Hull and Humber, and the incessant and violent inun- dations to which the neighbourhood of the town was subject, that it is to be attributed to the former.* The great floods to which this locality was then so subject, must have frequently given the country the appearance of one vast lake, dotted with innumerable islands. \" Holderness, which has been described as an island (says Mr. Frost), together with the entire district for many miles round Wyke and Myton, was peculiarly liable to the attacks of sudden floods, and in 1256 an extraordinary influx of the sea, which, according to Stowe and Walsingham, overflowed the whole of the eastern coast of England, extended to the fisheries and woods of Cottingham, belonging to the monks of Melsa, and swept away numbers of people of both sexes, together with many head of cattle ; it also washed into the Humber a considerable quantity of land, which the monks had in Myton, and which was afterwards regained. These inunda- tions were attended with the most serious consequences, and the sufferings they occasioned are described in terms of horror in an official letter, addressed by Archbishop Corbridge to the Prior and distance to the north of the Stone Chair;\" and then he quotes from Dr. Chambers : — \"How the part between Seulcoat's Gote (which runs into the river Hull), and the Chair opposite to the Charter House-lane, hath been added to the County of York, doth not appear now (1766).\" * The inlet now called Lime-Kiln Creek, is supposed to be the remains of the old river Hull. 19 HISTORY OF KIXGSTOX-UPOX-HULL. Convent of Giseburn, in 1301, which states, that in conveying the bodies of deceased persons from the chapel at Kingston to the parish church of Hessle for interment, it often happened that the bodies and attendants were all washed away by the water of the Humber. So dangerous indeed had these floods rendered the travelling between Hull and Anlaby, that the Commissioners, who were charged with the superintendence of the banks, and the protection of the country against inundations, found it necessary, at the commencement of the fourteenth century, to raise the road six feet above its ordinary level ; this great work was effected by taking earth from the lands which lay to the north of the road, and the expenses incurred were directed by the Commissioners to be paid by the inhabitants of • Kyngeston sur Hull, Hesill, Feriby, Swanland, Braythwayte, \"Westelveley, Willardby, YTolfreton, and Anlaghby.' \" Our histo- rian's authority for the latter fact, was the Town's Kecords ; and he adds (in a foot note) \" Myton is not mentioned in this order, whence it may be presumed that it was at that time of little note.\" The irruptions of the Hull too were often attended with destructive consequences ; and on one occasion the monks of Meaux complained of a loss from the inundations of that river and the Humber, of about six acres of arable land in Drypool, which was stated to be worth 2s, 6d. per ann. Various ancient provisions have been made since the beginning of the reign of Edward H., for draining and embanking these parts. In 1356 (30 Edw. ILL) it was reported to the King that the tides of the rivers Hull and Humber flowed four feet higher than usual, so that the road leading to Anlaby, and all the adjacent lands, were overflowed ; his Majesty therefore granted letters patent for cleaning out the old ditch, and enlarging it twelve feet; and for cutting a new ditch, twenty-four feet broad, right through the pasture of Myton, into Hull, by which the waters might pass to and fro ; and also for raising the road considerably higher. In the same year an ordinance was made by the Mayor and Commonalty, that all their lands without the walls, beyond the west postern, reaching from Lyle-street (now Myton-gate) to the river Humber, should be let, free of rent, to such persons as would un- dertake to maintain the banks of the Humber in front of those lands, with a view to the safety and protection of the town and the HISTORY OF KINGSTON-UPON-HULL. 13 adjacent country. The tides still continuing to rise higher than formerly, various commissions were issued to obviate this calamity ; and in 1300 the tide rose so high, that the banks between Scul- coates and Hull gave way, and the water breaking in, not only swept away the cattle, but numbers of people were drowned in the general inundation, which flooded the whole country. \"In the reign of Richard II. (says Mr. Frost) the possibility of the port being annihilated by the influx of the sea, was contemplated in the judgment pronounced against Michael de la Pole, Earl of Suffolk ; and in the time of Henry VI., the river had shifted so far from the town, that the greatest apprehensions were entertained, not only of the entire destruction of the port, but of the consequent desertion and depopulation of the place. With a view to prevent the occurrence of such a calamity, the King granted his license to the Mayor and Commonalty to purchase land to the extent of £100. per annum, for the reparation and protection of the port.\" The town and port were again threatened with destruction from the ravages of the Humber in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, but by subsequent provisions the country was not only secured, but the low lands, which were unwholesome, not so much from their situation as from the effects of stagnant water, were rendered more healthy. The fact, then, that this locality was subject to such dreadful inundations, scarcely leaves room for a doubt that the change in the course of the river was the effect of accident, occasioned by a breach of the bank under the influence of some overwhelming torrent ; and Mr. Frost seems inclined to fix the period when this accident oc- curred, at the time of the great flood in 1250. \"At all events (he says), it is certain that the change took place anterior to Myton and Wyke becoming the property of Edward I., as sufficient time must have subsequently elapsed for the town to have followed, as it did, the scene of its trade, and to have had its buildings gradually trans- ferred from the banks of the old river to those of the new one, where they chiefly stood when Wyke attracted the notice of King Edward. It is true (he continues) that the channels of both rivers still re- mained open, but Old Hull, as the Book of Meaux relates, had warped up so much in consequence of the gradual increase of the new river, as scarcely to deserve even the name of a sewer.\" 14 HISTORY OF KINGSTON-UPON-HULL. In an agreement, made in 1269, between the Lady Joanna Stuteville and the Archbishop of York, mention is made of the former and her predecessors having had long previously enjoyed the privilege of putting down an iron chain across the river Hull at a place called Stanfordrak, from sunset to sunrise, in the time of war and tumult, for the security of the country against foreigners and disturbers of the peace. The river Hull is navigable to Frodingham Bridge, several miles above Beverley; and thence to Great Driffield by means of a canal. Another canal extends from this river to Leven, a length of about three miles. The word Hull is derived from Hoi, or 01, which is Gaelic for water. In some ancient documents the name is spelt Hul. Hoi is a prenomen in many compound names implying water, thus — Holland, Holbeck, Holg&te, Holbuvu, &c. jPistxrriral %nnute. From the earliest times on record the mouth of the river Hull was the site of a wyk, or harbour for shipping, and the ancient appellation of the town whose history we are tracing was Wyke or Wyke-upon-Hull. Myton-wyk (Myton harbour) was another name by which the place was known in early ages. According to Ves- tegau,* the Saxon word pic, wic, wyk, wyke, or wich, signified a port, refuge, or retreat, and hence the application of this word as a com- ponent part of the names of several English sea-ports, as Harwich, Ipswich, Woolwich, Greenwich. The word wick is frequently found as a termination in the names of villages in the district of Holder- ness, which is immediately adjacent to Hull, as Atwick, Burstwick, Bewick, Oustwick, Welwick, Withernwick, &c. The same author states that the Saxons, whose language was altogether different from that of the Britons, \" left very few cities, towns, villages, passages, rivers, woods, fields, hills, or dales, to which they gave not new * Restitution of Decayed Intelligence in Antiquities, p. 329. HISTORY OF KINGSTON-UrON-HULL. 15 names, such as in their own language were intelligible, and either given by reason of the situation or nature of the place ; or after some place in some sort like unto it in Germany, from whence they came ; and from this, one of our local historians (Mr. Frost) infers, that the name of Wyke from the Saxon pic, indicates the existence of a town here in the Anglo-Saxon times. One of the significations of the word wic given by Vossius, and also by Ducange, upon the authority of Rhedanus, is \"fluminis ostium,\" or the mouth of a river. Dr. Johnson quotes from Gibson the following explanation of the word wic. \"Wic, wich, comes from the Saxon ivic, which, according to the different nature and condition of places, hath a three-fold signification ; implying either a village, or a bay made by the winding banks of a river or a castle.\" Although Hull was a considerable port a century after the com- pilation of the Domesday Book, and probably at a much earlier period, it is not mentioned in that ancient record ; being at that time only a parcel of the manor of Myton, which is described as a berewick in the manor of Ferriby, hundred of Hessle.* Kalph de Mortimer was then lord of the manor, and had under him fourteen villains, or small farmers, occupying three carucates, or ploughlands, which amounted to 300 acres. Edina had nearly 1,000 acres in the same manor. There was here also a church, and a minister belonging to it, in the reign of Edward the Confessor. The whole manor, and all the villages therein, were assessed at 100 shillings, but afterwards, on account of the repeated devastations made by the Danes, it was reduced to sixty. The villages and hamlets which then belonged to the manor were Kirk-Ella, in which were only two bovates of land that contained about 30 acres of tillage; Waudby, in which were about 100 acres in tillage ; Kiplingham, in which were about 120 acres in tillage ; Yorkfleet, containing about 100 * Domesday Book is a register of the possessions of every English freeman, to ascertain what quality of military service was owed hy the King's chief tenants; to affix the homage due to the King, and to record by what tenure the various estates in Britain were held. The survey was finished in the year 1086 ; and the register, or national record of the same, was called Dom Boc, Doomsday, or Domesday Book or judgment, alluding by metaphor to those books out of which the world will be judged at the last day. The original register is deposited in the Chapter House at West- minster, and is in a fine state of preservation. 16 HISTORY OF KINGSTON-UPON-HULL. acres of tillage ; Wolferton, with about 140 acres in tillage ; and Hassel (Hessle), in which were about 100 acres in tillage. The greater part of these lands then lay waste, the country being not at that time recovered from the devastations of the Danes.* In Hessle, four villains occupied one carucate more. In Sculcoates, or Cowscoates, the Archbishop of York had about 100 acres ; and in Drypool nearly twenty more, with an arable close, which then lay waste. In the manors of Sculcoates and Drypool, Ote and Kaven- hill possessed three bovates of land, which amounted to about 130 acres. Ralph de Mortimer, who was ancestor of the famous Earls of March, was lord of all the surrounding villages, and many other towns and domains in Yorkshire, as well as in several other counties in England. Soon after the Domesday period all the neighbouring towns and hamlets were in a flourishing condition. Among the documents relating to Wyke, the earliest notice met with is a grant (without date) of lands \" del Wyke de Mitune,\" made to the monks of Meaux, probably about the year 1160, by Maud or Matilda, the daughter or Hugh Camin. William le Gros, the Norman lord of Holderness, and Earl of Albemarle, having vowed to make a pilgrimage to the Holy Sepulchre at Jerusalem, and being, in consequence of increasing corpulency, unable to perform such a journey, was advised by a monk of Foun- tains Abbey, named Adam, to build and endow (by way of commu- tation of the pilgrimage) a monastery for Cistercian monks at a place in Holderness which was named Melsa, or Meaux, by its Norman possessors, after the city of that name in Normandy, from whence they came. The site of the building was selected by the monk, Adam, who was celebrated for his piety and architectural skill. * To revenge the massacre of the Danes, hy order of King Ethelred, on St. Briee's day, in the year 1012, Sweyne, King of Denmark undertook the conquest of England. In 1013 he entered the Humber with a large fleet, and having destroyed the country on both sides of the river, he proceeded to York, where he gave Ethelred battle and defeated him. Sweyne died at Gainsborough, King of England, in 1014. When the Saxon nobles invited the King of Denmark to aid them in an attempt to expel the Norman Conqueror, the Danish monarch sent a fleet of 250 ships well laden with troops, commanded by his brother Osbern. This fleet entered the Humber in 1069, and on their passage to York the Danes destroyed everything valuable on the banks of the river. Myton, Sculcoates, Drypool, and Ferriby are mentioned as having suffered lamentable destruction. HISTORY OF KINGSTON-UPON-IIULL. 17 Under his direction the monastery — a magnificent edifice adorned with stately pinnacles and towers — was erected about the year 1150 ; and wheu finished, monks were brought hither from the Abbey of Fountains; and Adam, the architect of the building became the first Abbot of the new community. The Abbey rose rapidly into importance under the fostering protection of its noble founder, and the monks were also indebted to many of the neighbouring barons and gentry for extensive grants of lands, particularly in Yorkshire. Of these grants, together with the privileges, &c, the histories and registers of the Abbey contain full records, the most perfect of which are to be found in an original chartulary, beautifully written, upon vellum, about the close of the fourteenth century, and now preserved in the British Museum. This chartulary was one of the volumes in the library of Sir Thomas Cotton, and did not entirely escape the effects of the fire which threatened the total destruction of that invaluable collection. There is another valuable history of the monastery still extant, entitled \"Liber Melse.\" Matilda de Camin's grant of lands, &c, to the monks of Meaux is preserved amongst the ancient muniments of the Corporation of Hull. In this curious instrument, the grantor bids \" all the sons of Holy Mother Church\" know that she has \"demised and sold to the monks of Melsa, the entire two parts of the land of my patrimony of Wye of Mitune, and also the entire two parts of my property of seven stangs and four oxgangs of land, in the territory of the afore- said vill of Mitune,\" and \" pasture for 800 sheep.\" Also, she con- tinues, \" I have sold to the said monks the toft in which the hall was situate,\" and \"the bed of one fishery in the Humber, and two parts of the salt-pits of my fee in the same vill, and two parts of Cotecroft, and two parts of Laucroft,\" &c. The sum for which the monks purchased this property was \"fourscore and eleven marks of silver.\" From Matilda's grant or charter we learn that there was a town as well as a manor of My ton ; and of the former, Mr. Frost observes, that \" it is remarkable that neither any written document, nor the busy agency of tradition, has even marked the spot where it stood, or left any ground for conjecture, under what circumstances, or at what period it ceased to exist. All that we can now learn respecting D 18 HISTORY OF KINGST0N-UP0N-HULL. it is, (he adds) that in very early times it had a Chapel, which was destroyed by the monks of Melsa, who made atonement in the 6th year of King John (1204) for this and other transgressions, by paying 100s. as a compromise, to Eichard Ducket, then parson of the Church of Hessle.\" Other lands in Wyke and its neighbourhood appear to have been conveyed to the Abbey of Meaux, in 1174. The circumstance is thus recorded in an old document. \" In the time of Philip the Abbot, the son of John of Meaux gave to the abbey, four oxgangs of land in Myton, pasture for 400 sheep, the seat of one fishery in Humber, two parts of the salt pits there, a toft and a hall, two parts of his lands in Wyke, and all their appurtenances. William of Sutton, and Benedict of Sculcoates, gave them the other part of Wyke, within the water-furrows, to the bounds of Old Hull and Humber.\" * * \" The Grange-house before mentioned, ought to be reckoned within Wyke aforesaid ; but nothing of it now remains. The place whereon it stood, which was converted into a feeding pasture, is at present known by the name of G range- Wyk, and made a new manor in Myton, called Tripcootes, or Tupcootes.\" Thus, we find the Abbey of Meaux in possession of the ground upon which is now seated the important town of Kingston-upon- Hull. As Mr. Frost remarks, the necessity of providing an additional place of public worship within the parish of Hessle for the use of the inhabitants of Myton and Wyke affords strong evidence that the population of these towns was at that period not only consider- able, but increasing ; and the existence of Wyke as a separate town from Myton, might be inferred from the title \" Myton et Wyke \" occurring in the Meaux Chartulary ; and from the names of Myton and Wyke being found separately in the index of places where the monks of Melsa had property. But the fact is clearly established, on the authority of the Book of Meaux Abbey, which records that in the year 1270, Richard, the tenth Abbot, gave half an acre of land in Wyke-upon-Hull to the canons of Watton, in exchange for two tofts in Crauncewyk, and three tofts in North Dalton.* * Lib. Melse, fol. 192. HISTORY OF KTNGSTON-UPON-HULL. 19 And again, about the end of the reign of Henry III., or at the be- ginning of that of his successor, before surnames had come into common use, and when people chiefly derived their appellations from the towns which they inhabited, William de Wyke, the son of Simon de Wyke, granted to Walter Gifford, Archbishop of York, all his lands in Wyke, upon the river Hull, lying between the lands of Stephen, son of Robert de Wyke, and the lands which William de Wyke held of the Abbot of Meaux.* All the earlier historians of Hull have ascribed the town of Hull to the victorious and renowned monarch, Edward I., in the year 1290 ; but this opinion has been discovered to be erroneous, for Hull was a place of consequence and note more than a century prior to that period, as Mr. Charles Frost, in his \"Notices\" abundantly proves. In the preface to his interesting book, Mr. Frost informs us that for some years he had the sole management of the defence of a suit, instituted for the recovery of tithe throughout the town- ship of Meaux, a few miles from Hull, which, as has been seen, had formerly belonged to a body of monks, whose extensive posses- sions included the entire soil upon which the town of Hull now stands ; and that the facts which came under his notice in the course of the investigation necessarily attendant on that defence, confirmed the inference previously drawn by Macpherson, from the authorities which he has given, that Hull, as a place of importance, was of greater antiquity than that assigned to it by historians.! Mr. Frost shews in the clearest manner that the early history of Hull has been peculiarly neglected and misrepresented, even by the time-honoured antiquarians, Leland and Camden. The former, who commenced the collection of materials for his Itinerary in 1538, and completed it in 1545, visited this town in the former year, and he has done little more regarding Hull (says Mr. Frost), than hand down to us the loose and unauthenticated traditions which he collected during his visit. The place (he writes) \" was in the tyme * According to Camden, surnames began to be taken up in England about the period of the Norman Conquest, but were not fully settled among the common people until about the time of Edward II.

The first great eucreasing of the toune was by passing for fisch into Iseland, from whens they had the hole trade of stoke fisch into England, and partly other fisch. In Richard the 2. dayes the toune waxid very rich, and Michael de la Pole, merchaunt of Hulle, and prentyce, as some say, to one Rotenhering, of the same toune, cam into so high favor for wit, actyvite, and riches, that he was made Counte of Southfolk, wherapon he got of King Richard the 2. many grauntes and privileges to the toune ; and yn his tyme the toune was wonder- fully augmentid yn building, and was enclosid with diches, and the waul begon, aud yn continuance endid, and made al of brike, as most part of the houses of the toune at that tyme was.\"* And again he says, \" The toune of Kingeston had first by graunt cus- todem, then bailives, then maire and bailives, and yn King Henry the G. tyme a maire, a shirive, and the toune to be shire ground by it self. One told me, that their first great corporation was grauntid to Kingeston a 180 yere syns.\"f Camden (who finished his Britannia in 1607), trusting to the authority of Leland, is equally incorrect in the account which he gives of the origin of this place. \" It is (he says) a town of no great antiquity. Edward I., who for his princely virtues deserves a place among our first and best kings, observing the advantageous situation of the place, which was before called Wik, purchased it by exchange of the Abbot of Meaux, and instead of the vaccaria and bercharia, by which I understand pens for cattle and sheep, which he found there, built a town, which he called Kingstone, or the King's Town, establishing there, as the record sets forth, a port and free borough, making the inhabitants free burgesses, and granting them various privileges.\"! This venerable writer then follows the popular tradition, that the town rose to a state of affluence in the reign of Richard II., partly in consequence of the privileges granted to it through the intercession of Michael de la Pole, Earl of Suffolk, and partly through its trade in stockfish. * Itinerary ed.

HIST0EY OP KINGSTON-UPON-HULL. 21 Speed's account of its origin is as follows : — \" Places for trade and venting forth their commodities are many, yet none of such convenience as Kingston-upon-Hull, which, notwithstanding, cannot fetch her beginning from any great antiquity (being before time called Wyke). King Edward I. built this town, making a haven, and granting many privileges to the burgesses, so that it is risen to great state, both for stately buildings and strong block-houses, for ships well furnished, and for store of merchants, and is now become the most famous town of that country, whoso greatest riches is ascribed to the gainful trade they have by Iceland fish, dried and hardened, commonly called stockfish.\"* The Rev. Abraham de la Pryme, Divinity-reader and curate of the Church of the Holy Trinity, for three years, ending in 1701, compiled the first detached History of Hull, \" from the records, charters, deeds, mayor's letters, &c, of the said town.\"f This work, which exists yet in manuscript only, and a copy of which is to be found in the Warburton Collection, among the Landsdown MSS., in the British Museum, formed the basis and groundwork of all sub- sequent accounts and histories of the town, down to Mr. Frost's time. Gent, Hadley, and Tickell, relying upon the accredited source from which De la Pryme drew his information, without fur- ther enquiry, followed his authority in their histories of Hull, and thus fell into the common error, that the town was founded by Edward I., in 1296 ; and that Wyke, which, with reference to that period, is incorrectly represented by them, as having been situated not where Kingston-upon-Hull now stands, but a quarter of a mile to the west of it, then consisted of little more than cribs and folds, with perhaps some places of shelter to defend the shepherds from the extremities of the seasons. Mr. Frost, who, as before intimated, possessed peculiar facilities * Theatre of Great Britain (ed. 1676). p. 81. + We leam from Hadley's History of Hull that in the year 1700, the Eev. A. De la Pryme obtained the sanction of the Corporation to view the ancient charters and other records belonging to them, \" in order to compose a catalogue thereof, and revive the ancient rights and privileges of the town;\" that the Town Clerk was requested to assist him; and that in 1703, he (Mr. De la Pryme) had eight guineas given to him \" as a gratuity for inspecting the town's records, and making an index thereof.\" De la Pryme died minister of Thome on the 13th of June, 1704. 22 HISTORY OF KINGSTON-UPON-HULL. of prosecuting a very minute enquiry into the origin of the place, feels it a sort of heresy to question the high authorities already quoted. But he is of opinion that \" the source whence the error has arisen is clearly to be traced to the language of adulation or gratitude, which our ancestors adopted in expressing their obligations to King Ed- ward I., under whom, by his recent acquisition of the absolute property of the town, their place of habitation was elevated to the rank of a Royal Borough, and from whom they had themselves re- ceived, by charter, many valuable privileges.\" He tells us, that in a petition which the burgesses presented to that King in the year 1300, shortly after the imposition of the new title of Kingston, they acknowledged him, in direct terms, as the founder of their town ; and that through such means a belief became prevalent that the town had been actually built by the monarch to whom it owed so many favours. The King himself, in a writ of ad quod damnum, issued in consequence of that petition, seems to have accommodated himself to their language, by styling the place his own new town ; and in 1371 (44 Edw. III.) in the pleadings in a suit between the Archbishop of York and the burgesses of Hull, one of the parties alleged, and the other did not deny, that his late Majesty Edward I., \" Villam scdificavit,\" on the site of Wyke, \" et ibidem quondam portum fecit,\" where he had customs taken to his use.* \"These apparently strong authorities (continues Mr. Frost) are sufficient to account for, as well as to excuse, the error committed by Leland, and adopted by Camden, in describing the origin of the town ; and it is not surprising that, sanctioned and supported by such names, it obtained a credit which succeeding writers did not venture to impeach.\" In alluding to the ancient name of the port, Mr. Frost writes : — < \" Besides the name of Wyke, the town was contemporaneously called Hull, as it is at the present day, from the port or river upon which its commerce was conducted ; and, from the early use of the latter appellation, it may fairly be inferred that considerable mercantile traffic was there carried on, at a period long antecedent to the date of any historic evidence now extant on this subject. The proofs * Hargraves' Law Tracts, p. 09, quoted by Frost. HISTORY OF KINGSTON-UPON-HULL. 23 tbat the name of Hull was applied to the town, in common with the port, are of the same kind with those which have been adduced with respect to the existence of the town, under the name of Wyke. The Book of Meaux furnishes some early instances where Hull is men- tioned as a place of residence: — in the year 1100, a croft in Sutton is described as haw'mgformerly belonged to Herneius (Qu. Henricus?) de Hull ;* and soon after the commencement of the reign of Henry III., \" Henricus de Hull, filius Rogeri de Hull,\" and \" Agnes, filia Tburstani de Hull,\" appear in the list of benefactors to the Abbey .f In addition to these instances, the Great Roll of the Pipe of 48th Henry III. speaks of Stephen de Hull, and Thomas de Hull. J But Hull is likewise mentioned as a town in 1217, in a demise from Saer de Sutton to the Abbot and Canons of Thornton, in Lincoln- shire, of common pasture in the territory and marshes of Sutton, Hull, Sudcoates, and Dripol, with free ingress and egress between Hull and Wilflet.§ The Register of \"Walter Giffard also speaks of lands held by Walter de Grey in Sculcoates, Dripole, and Hull,\\\\ while the Lady Joanna de Stotevill's Men of Hull are mentioned in an agreement made between her and Archbishop Giffard in 1209.^\" The actual line which separated the two parishes of Hessle and Ferriby, has not been clearly defined ; all that can be positively asserted on the subject is, that Trinity Chapel was within the limits of the former, and the Chapel of our Lady in the latter. The Domesday Survey describes Hessle parish as being half a mile in breadth, and that being about the distance from the Humber to the junction of Aldgate with the old river, leads to the supposition that Aldgate, or, as it was called by the Saxons, Ealdgate, formed the boundary between the two parishes. Aldgate extended in an in- terrupted line from east to west, commencing on the bank of the ditch, called Sayer Creek (now the old harbour or river Hull), and extending across the old river Hull to the junction of the Beverley and Anlaby roads. The antiquity of this street increases the pro- bability that it formed the original boundary between these parishes ; * Lib. Melse, fol. 24. + Ibid, fol. 107, and Cott. MSS. Vitell.

It was subsequently divided into three parts, viz., the one now called Scale-lane, which extends from the banks of the Hull to the Market- place ; the other, called Silver-street, from thence to Trinity House- lane ; and the third, Whitefriar-gate, which occupies the remainder of the line. The Rev. Dr. Oliver, writing in the Gentleman's Magazine, Feb- ruary, 1836, says, \" It appears that the town (villa) of Myton was situated to the westward of the river, at a very short distance from the bank, and the hamlet of Wyk was built on the shores of the Humber, occupying both sides of the mouth of Hull ; although the principal part lay towards the east. And thus Wyk was in two separate wapentakes, according to the Saxon arrangement, which were divided by this small river ; one part being in Hassel hundred, and the other in Holderness. It follows then that the vill of Myton and the hamlet of Wyk were contiguous, and ultimately blended with each other, and together constituted the one town of Hull, lying within the parochial jurisdiction of Hessle in all matters ecclesiastical and civil. And it is of importance to remark, that, for the Wyk, or harbour, the name of the river itself was, in these early times, frequently substituted. In the Chartulary of Melsa the town is distinguished by the name of Hull at the very beginning of the reign of Henry II., and in the time of his successor ; and there is an abundance of records to prove that it was occasionally so denominated in every reign, down to the period when it had the proud honour of a royal designation conferred upon it by the mu- nificence of King Edward I., although it was more frequently known by the name of Myton- Wyk. In those days, when the immediate effects of the Norman Conquest had passed away (continues the same writer, in his Inquiry), Myton-Wyk assumed the appearance of a substantial town, and was under the government of the Abbat of Melsa, whose bailiffs held courts, markets, and fairs, within its precincts; and the fruits of his judicious superintendence were a gradually increasing prosperity. Its traffic was considerable, and it stood high in rank amongst the most eminent ports in the king- HISTORY OF KINGSTON I PON HI LL. 25 dom. One great reason which induces me to think that the popu- lation of Myton-Wyk was of some magnitude in these early times, arises from the value of its annual rental. The vill of Myton, in- cluding the wyk, contains something short of 180 acres; and the average rent of land was twenty shillings per hide, or twopence an acre; which would produce, exclusive of any other property that might be placed upon it, only thirty shillings a year. But the Abbat of Melsa had an annual rental in Myton-Wyk, amounting to £78. 14s. Gd. ; and at Myton his rents were £24. 8s., after deduct- ing reprises. Hence there was in both these places some species of property of greater value than the land ; and this, in such a situa- tion, could only be houses, shops, wharfs, and conveniences for. traffic.\" In 1278 (6 Edw. I.) the Abbot of Meaux petitioned that he and his successors might have a market on Thursday in each week, \"at WyJce, near Mitton-upon-the-Hidle, and a fair there in each year on the vigil, the day, and the morrow of the Holy Trinity, and on the twelve following days. Soon after this petition was presented, a writ of ad quod damnum was issued, and an inquisition being taken at York, before Thomas Normanville, the King's steward, it was found by the jury that the Abbot and his successors might have a market and fair at \" Le Wyke,\" without injury to the King, or the neighbouring markets or fairs. * The importance of Wyke or Hull, both as a town and a place of trade, is testified by the grant of this market and fair ; as well as by the circumstance of a royal mandate having been addressed, about this period, to the Bailiffs of Hull, in common with the bailiffs * In the year 1200 King John, accompanied by his Queen, en suite, was entertained with great magnificence by William de Stuteville, at his Manor House, Cottinghain. The royal party were then making a progress into the north ; after visiting Lincoln they crossed the Humber from Grimsby, and proceeded to Cottingham ; and in return for his reception, the monarch granted D e Stuteville many important privileges, among which were charters for a market and fair at Cottingham, and permission to embattle and fortify his residence. The King also constituted him High Sheriff of Yorkshire, an office which he had previously held only by substitution. There is no record of the reception which the King and hip train met with at Hull. An old English Gazetteer states that a member of the above-mentioned family named Joan, or Johanna de Stuteville, had an impression on her seal of \" a woman riding sideways, with the bridle in her right hand, she being the first, 'tis said, that began that custom now in use with her sex.\" E 26 HIST0KY OF KINGST0N-UP0N-HTJLL. of other sea-ports, directing them to examine all merchants leaving the kingdom, in order to discover plates of silver, clipped and broken coin, &c, in their possession. The bailiffs of this place were, doubt- less, those appointed by the Abbot of Meaux ; that dignitary having assumed the entire dominion of the town. Indeed, the Abbot's bailiffs were soon after officially recognised as such, in a writ ad- dressed in 1290 (18 Edw. I.), to the Abbot of Melsa's Bailiffs of Hull, requiring them to assist Toricius, the Fleming of York, to take \" rectas prisas \" of wines coming to the Town of Hull, and to gauge the wines there, in the same manner as was then done in other parts of the kingdom. We have shewn that to the taste and industry of Mr. Frost we are indebted for the knowledge that when Wyke or Hull, together with the manor of My ton, became the property of King Edward I., it was not as the early writers have it — an obscure corner, hitherto neglected, and consisting of a few huts for shepherds and cowherds, but a place of importance, the property of the monks of Meaux therein being, as we have seen, considerable ; and it must be recol- lected that the monks were not the sole proprietors of the place, as the Canons of Watton Abbey, the Archbishop of York, the family of Sutton, and others, had property there. The histories of the Abbey of Meaux record the anxiety of the King (who had contemplated the advantage of the situation of the place for a fortified town, and a great commercial port) to obtain the possession of this property, and they relate the particulars of the exchange of it for lands in Lincolnshire. By a deed of feoffment, executed by the Abbey and Convent, in the beginning of the year 1298, Edward acquired the absolute ownership of Wyke, and he immediately dignified it with the appellation of Kingston, or King's Town, adding the terms upon Hull, to distinguish it from Kingston- upon-Thames ; and having constituted it a manor independent of Myton, he built there a Manor Hall, or royal residence, and issued a proclamation, offering great freedoms, privileges, and immunities, to all those who should fix their habitations there. He placed the town under the government of a Warden (custos) and Bailiffs ; and appointed Peter de Campania to value and let it. This new valua- IITSTORY OF KTNGST0N-TJTON-IIULL. 7 tion amounted to £78. 17s. 8d. per ann., which corresponds within a few shillings with the sum stated to have been received for the rent of the same property by the Abbot of Meaux. The first person appointed to fill the high office of Warden was Richard Oysel, the King's bailiff of the Seigniory of Holderness, and keeper of the Royal Manor of Rurstvvick. The first charter granted to the town is dated 1st of April, 1299 (27 Edw. I.), and was obtained by the inhabitants upon their petition being presented to the King in person, while he was keeping his Christmas at Baynard Castle, the seat of Lord Wake, at Cottingham, near Hull, on his return from the north. The following is a trans- lation of it : — \" Edward, by the grace of God, King of England, Lord of Ireland, and Duke of Aquitaine, to all Archbishops, Bishops, Abbots, Priors, Earls, Barons, Justices, Sheriffs, and Provosts, greeting, — \" Know ye, that to the melioration, betterness, and increase of our town of Kingston- upon-Hull, and to the further utility and profit of our men of the same, we will and grant, for us and our heirs, that our town aforesaid from henceforth be a free borough, and the men of the town be free burgesses, and have all the liberties, privileges, and free customs belonging to a free borough, for ever; so that the said borough be kept by some faithful man, by us and our heirs successively to be chosen, who shall be called the Warden of the said borough, and shall take, before the burgesses of the same, a corporal oath upon the Holy Gospels of God that he will most faithfully keep all the liberties, privileges, and immunities, by us to the said borough and burgesses granted, without blame, and will diligently and faithfully perform, and do all those things which to the office of a Warden of the said borough do belong. \" We grant also for us and our heirs, to the said burgesses and their heirs and successors for ever, that the lands and tenements which from henceforth they shall have in the said borough, they may, in their last wills and testaments, dispose of to whomsoever they please. \" That they shall have the return of all writs whatsoever happening in the said borough, and that no Sheriff, or other our Bailiff or Minister, may enter into the said borough there to execute any writ, brief, or office, iipon any of the inhabitants of the said free borough, but in defect of the Warden; and that they shall not implead or be impleaded in any other place than the said borough, before the Warden of the same, of any tenures, trespasses, transgressions, or contracts, within the said borough made. \" And also that they the said burgesses and their heirs (by our writs out of Chan- cery) may and shall choose a Coroner out of themselves, and him shall present to the Warden, before whom he shall take his corporal oath that he will faithfully do and perform those things, to the office of a Coroner in the said borough do belong. \" And moreover we will and graut, for us and our heirs, that a prison be had and made in our said borough, for the safe keeping and chastisement of malefactors, either therein or thereunto taken, upon whom the Warden may give judgment. \" We moreover will and grant, for us and our heirs, that the said burgesses and their heirs, throughout the whole kingdom of our dominions, be for ever quit aud free 28 HISTORY OF KINGSTON-UPON-HULL. of all portage, passage, pennage, murage, and all other tolls and customs whatsoever ; ami that they, the burgesses of the said borough, shall for ever peaceably enjoy all the liberties, customs, and freedoms, without scot and lot, so often as the said town shall happen to be taxed. \" We also grant, for us and our heirs, to the aforesaid burgesses, that they and their heirs for ever shall have two markets in a week, within the town aforesaid, to be kept in the places by us to be named and appointed, the one to be held upon every Tuesday, and the other upon every Friday ; with one fair every year, to continue thirty days, to wit, from the day of St. Austin, after Easter, by twenty-nine days nest following, unless that those markets and this fair happen to be to the prejudice of any of the neighbouring markets or fairs. \" And do further add, will, and command, for us and our heirs, that our town afore- said, from henceforth for ever, be a free borough, and the men of the same, free bur- gesses ; and have all the liberties, privileges, and free customs belonging to a free borough for ever.\" This charter was signed by the Bishop of Coventry and Lichfield, the Earl of Lincoln, and other nobles. And thus did Hull become a free borough. In the same year that the charter was granted, the harbour was finished, or rendered more perfect for the reception of ships. \" For the purchase of the extensive liberties and privileges granted by this charter (writes Mr. Frost), the inhabitants of Kingston-upon- IIull offered only 100 marks, while the burgesses of Eavenser paid no less than £300. for a similar grant in their favour (in the same year) ; but this disparity affords no criterion for determining the relative importance of the two places. Ravenser had risen suddenly to the enjoyment of considerable commercial prosperity, and had become a formidable rival to the King's ports of Grimsby, Hedou, and Scarborough. Its merchants, neglecting no means of increasing their traffic, were ready to purchase their liberties at a price equi- valent to the privileges to be conferred ; while Hull, on the other hand, would naturally avail itself of the peculiar claim which it had on roval favour, in the circumstance of having so recentlv become the property of the King. To the relative situation, therefore, of the two places in this respect, may be attributed the regulation of the amount of the fines in the proportion mentioned. As a further proof that the disparity in the amount of these fines depended more upon such circumstances as we have alluded to, than on the ability of the parties to discharge them, it may be observed that the people of Hull paid a moiety of their fine immediately, and the remaining HISTORY OF KINGSTON-UPON-IIULTj. 29 pavt in the following year, while the burgesses of Ravenscr in the first year\" paid only £36. out of £300., leaving the remainder in charge in the Sheriff's account, until the 31st of Edward I.\" From this period the increase and prosperity of the place have been remarkable, and it was soon regarded as one of the principal towns in the kingdom ; so much so, that when an extensive coinage was appointed, Hull was fixed upon as one of the places where mints were to be established.- By degrees all the flourishing towns of these parts, such as Barton, Hedon, Patrington, Grimsby, and Pia- vcnspuin, were drained of their chief inhabitants and trade — Hull monopolising all to itself — so that as it continually increased, those towns proportionately decreased ; and at present little, if any, com- mercial business is transacted in any of them, except in Grimsby, which, from its favourable position on the Humber, has of late years risen rapidly in the scale of importance. Edward I., in the course of a progress to the north, visited Hull in the year 1300. He crossed the Humber, from Barton to Hessle, on the 20th of May, and the passage of the royal party across the ferry appears to have occupied two days; the sum of 13s. having been paid for the wages of Galfrid de Seleby and other sailors, with eleven barges and boats employed during that time. The high road northward (via regia) lay at that time in a direct line from Hessle to Beverley ; but the King took a circuitous route thither, solely for the purpose of viewing the state of the newly-created borough of Hull. His stay here was of short duration, but the effects of his visit were soon visible in the various improvements by which it was succeeded, and particularly in the pavement of the streets ; for defraying the expense of which a grant was made soon after the King's departure, of certain tolls, to be levied on all goods coming to the town for sale. Here a few particulars of King Edward I., the reputed founder of Hull, may not be unacceptable to some. This monarch was warlike * The Royal Mint at Kingston-upon-Hull bad four furnaces, and the coins of Ed- ward struck here have on them the legend Vill de Kyngeslon. Mr. Thomas Mapple- heck, of Low-gate, Hull, has a silver penny coined here in King Edward's time. In Frost's \" Notices \" is an engraving of a silver penny coined at Hull ; and there is an engraving of a Hull penny given in the Supplement to Euding's Annals. 30 HISTORY OF KiNGSTON-TJPON-HULL. and politic, and has been deservedly called \" the hammer of Scot- land. \" He passed several times through Yorkshire whilst prose- cuting his wars against the Scots; and he held some parliaments in the city of York. In 1296, the Scots having made an inroad into England, this valiant monarch marched against them with a well appointed army, and joining in battle, he slew 28,000 of the enemy in the field, and put the rest to flight. Berwick, Dunbar, and Edinburgh, and other places, opened their gates to the con- queror; John Baliol, the Scottish King, was forced to resign his kingdom by a charter dated 10th of July (1296), at Brechin; and the Scottish sceptre, coronation stone, &c, were sent to London.* Edward himself, attended by several of his noble warriors, followed after, and returning through Yorkshire, he paid a visit of a few days to Lord Wake, at Cottingham. It was whilst hunting one day during this visit, that the King is said to have been so struck with the general aspect of the small town of Wyke or Hull, on the banks of the Humber, that he soon afterwards became possessed of it. In 1299 — the year in which Edward granted a charter to the new borough of Kingston-upon-Hull — he assembled a parliament at York ; and in 1304, he completed the reduction of Scotland, though not its subjugation. Having conquered and united the principality of Wales to the crown of England, and having constrained the Scots to swear fealty * This famous stone, on which the inauguration of the Scottish Kings was per- formed, was removed from the monastery of Scone, in Perthshire, and is now inserted in the seat of the Coronation chair of the Sovereigns of England. It is a flat stone, nearly square, and is said to he the identical stone which formed Jacob's pillow, when he had those celestial and mystical visions mentioned in holy writ. Tradition says it was brought out of Palestine into Ireland, and was there used as the inauguration stone of the Kings of that country ; that it was brought from Ireland by Fergus, the son of Eric, who led the I>abriads to the shores of Argyleshire ; and was deposited in the city of Scone. An old antiquarian has described this stone, \" the ancientest respected monument in the world; for, although some others may be more ancient as to duration, yet thus superstitiously regarded they are not.\" The antiquity of this \" Stone of Destiny \" is undoubted, however it may be questioned whether it be the same stone on which the ancient Kings of Ireland were crowned on the hill of Tara. The history of its being used for the coronation of the Scottish Kings, and of its removal from Scone by Edward I., admits of no doubt. A record exists of the ex- penses attending its removal. The curious visitor to London may inspect it, together with the ancient chair made for its reception, in the reign of Edward I., in the Chapel of St. Edward the Confessor, in Westminster Abbey. HISTOBY OF KINGSTON-UrON-HULL. 31 to him, Edward spent the winter before his death at Carlisle, where he summoned his last parliament. The Scots, taking advantage of the King's absence, and of his having dismissed his army, assem- bled their dispersed forces, attacked and obtained a signal victory- over the English troops, and took prisoner the Earl of Pembroke, who commanded in Scotland. Exasperated at this unexpected revolution, Edward resolved to march into the heart of Scotland, and destroy the kingdom from sea to sea ; and to that end he summoned all the vassals of the crown to meet him at Carlisle, about the middle of summer, on pain of forfeiting their fees. But, whilst \" man proposes, God disposes ; \" no sooner had he assembled the finest army England had ever seen, than he was seized with a distemper, which put an end to his days, and all his projects. On his death-bed he earnestly recommended Prince Edward, his eldest son and successor, to prosecute the war with Scotland with the utmost vigour. He also advised the Prince to carry along with him his remains at the head of the army, not doubting but the sight of his bones would daunt the courage of the enemies he had thrice conquered. After these last orders to his son, he caused himself to be carried by easy journeys to meet the enemy; but he had not advanced above five miles, to a village in Cumberland, called Burgh- upon-Sands, when his sickness was increased by an attack of dy- sentery, which carried him off on the 7th of July, 1307, in the G8th year of his age, and the 35th of his reign. His body was conveyed to Westminster Abbey, and laid by the remains of Henry, his father ; and the memory of his death is preserved on the spot where he died, by a square pillar bearing an appropriate Latin inscription. After the change in the course of the river Hull, noticed at page 10, the buildings, as before stated, were gradually transferred from the banks of the old river to those of the new channel; and when the town had attracted the attention of Edward I., sufficient time had elapsed to render its general appearance complete. The recent edifices had spread over the greater part of the space which may now be denominated the old town, and nearly all the principal streets there were at that time in existence. From Hull-street (now High- street), which lay parallel with the river, to the quays and wharfs, 32 HISTORY OF KINGSTON-UPON-HULL. where the business of the port was transacted, there were several communications by means of staithes or narrow passages, most of which yet remain. The freedom of passage conferred upon the burgesses by their charter, caused them to establish a ferry across the Hull ; but Sir John de Sutton, Knt, then lord of the manor of Sutton, and owner of the lands on the Holderness side of the river, where the ferry lay, claimed, by descent from his ancestors, the exclusive right of pas- sage across that river at Drypool, as appurtenant to his lands there. Having procured a writ of ad quod damnum to be directed to tbe Sheriff of Yorkshire, an inquisition was taken thereof in 1307, when the jurors recognised the complainant's right to the ferry. In 1303 the Warden, &c, petitioned the King to issue out his writ to Ralp de Hengham and others, to call a jury, and to make direct ways and. causeways to the neighbouring towns ; and the result was that proper roads and highways to Hessle, Anlaby, Beverley, (Nottingham, and Holderness, were then formed. These three roads are probably the same as remain to this day. In 1305 Hull first returned, bur- gesses to parliament. In 1306 Elizabeth de Burgh, the wife of Eobert Bruce of Scot- land (after the defeat of her noble husband) was closely confined for two years in the Royal Manor House at Burstwick, in Holderness. Bymer, in his Faidera, has preserved the special directions given to Richard Oysel, concerning the manner in which she was to be treated.* After the siege of Stirling, the King remained some time at Burstwick Park.f * She was to have with her a lady and a woman for her chamber, \" who may be of good age, and not gay;\" two pages, \"who shall be also of good age, and prudent;\" one of them to carve for her; \" a foot-boy to wait in her chamber, one who is sober and not riotous, to make her bed, and do other oflices pertaining to her chamber;\" a valet, \" who shall be of good bearing, and discreet to keep her keys, and serve in the pantry and cellar;\" and a cook. She was also allowed three greyhounds for her re- creation in the warren at Burstwick, \" and in the parks when she chuseth;\" to have venison in the park and fish in the fisheries, \" according as she shall be inclined ;\" and she was to reside in the best house in the manor, at her pleasure. — Bymer, vol. ii., p. 1013. + The Eoyal Park at Burstwick assisted to supply the larder of some of our Kings in London with venison, as appears from a payment of £2. Is. 4d., made to lid. Oysel, the keeper of the manor, for his disbursements respecting three doles of venison taken HISTORY OF KINGSTON-UPON-IIULL. 33 In 1310 (9 Edw. II.), Robert de Sandal being Warden of tbe town, the King, at the request of the burgesses, and after an inqui- sition made, was pleased to establish a ferry to and from Barton in Lincolnshire, to bring and carry over men, horses, beasts, &c, at the rate of one halfpenny for every single person ; a penny for every horseman ; and twopence for every cart going across with two horses. This grant to the \" Wardens and Burgesses, their heirs and succes- sors for ever,\" was made at Lincoln on the 28th of August, in the aforesaid year. In 1320 the value of this ferry was 40s. per an- num. In 1350 it was leased at the yearly rent of £535. 0s. 4d. ; and in 1831 at a yearly rent of £800. The ferry now belongs to the Manchester, Sheffield, and Lincolnshire Railway Company. In 1310 Sir Robert Hastings, Knt., was made Warden of Hull during life; and for his courage and valour, as well as some noble and heroic deeds that he had done against the Scots, he was high in favour with his Sovereign. He had, moreover, the grant of the King's fee farm rents issuing out of this town, Myton, and Tup- coates, amounting in the whole to £70. per annum. This year the King issued a proclamation to the Sheriff of Yorkshire, that no goods should be sold in the port of Hull before they were landed. Two years after, Sir Robert Hastings waited upon the King, at York, and obtained a grant of him to lay a toll for the space of seven years, upon all such commodities as should be exposed in the market for sale, and the money to be employed in the paving of the streets. This toll, which was upon every quarter of corn, one farthing ; upon every horse, mare, or cow, one penny ; upon every salmon, one farthing ; upon every lamprey, one farthing ; upon every hundred of alum and copperas, one halfpenny ; upon every hundred of stock- fish, one halfpenny, &c, proved sufficiently productive for the pur- poses for which it was designed ; the streets were everywhere well- paved and made commodious and neat. Historians tell us that all in that park, and four doles of venison taken in the forest of Sherwood, which were sent by water from Hull to London, in the reign of Edward I. These disbursements consisted of the cost of salt to preserve the venison, the freight of a vessel to carry it to London, and the wages of a boy to take care of it while on board of the ship. — Wardrobe Account of the Reign of Edward J., 28 VO., fol. 53. In the month of July, 1323, several state papers were signed by King Edward II., at Burstwick Park. F 34 HISTORY OF KINGSTON-UPON-HULL. the stones made use of for this purpose were brought in ships from abroad. Leland says, that \" at such tyme as al the trade of stok- fisch for England cam from Isleland to Kingston, bycause the burden of stokfisch was light, the shipes were balissed with great coble stone brought out of Isleland, the which yn continuance paved al the toun of Kingeston throughout.\" Camden gives pretty nearly the same account. Tickell thinks it more probable that they were brought from the Spurn Head, or places adjacent, where plenty of them were to be had ; but Mr. Frost tells us, that in the year 1400, paving stones constituted a part of the cargoes of two Dutch vessels, which arrived in that year, the Mariknight, of Amsterdam, having brought to the port 40,000 ; and the Skerikewyn, of Dordrecht, 16,000. In both of these instances (he continues) the paving stones appear to have been imported on account of the masters of the ves- sels, and it is therefore not improbable that they were brought for the two-fold object of ballast while on board, and of sale for paving the streets when landed. The burgesses petitioned the King in 1322 to grant them a license to fortify the town with walls and ditches. A description of the fortifications then erected will be found at subsequent pages of this history. In the year 1331 (5 Edw. III.) the office of Custos or Warden of Hull was abolished, and the government of the borough was confided by royal charter to a Mayor and four Bailiffs, to be chosen annually. In the reign of Edward II., the family of De la Pole flourished here ; and as the history of that illustrious house is intimately connected with that of Hull, we shall briefly review it. Few towns ean boast of having given rise to so celebrated a family ; emerging from comparative obscurity to eminence, flourishing in such splen- dour, and experiencing such a variety of fortune. The Rev. W. H. Kemp, Incumbent of St. John's church, Hull, in a lecture on this family, which he lately delivered at the Royal Institution, observed : — \" Proudly pre-eminent among the families founded by Hull mer- chants, ranks that of the De la Poles, first alike in point of antiquity, historical associations, and high rank. The curtain rises upon this great family in the reign of the illustrious Plantagenet Edward I., HISTORY OF KINCSTON-UPON-HULL. 35 and sets in that of the cruel and unscrupulous Tudor Henry VIII. Their story therefore is contemporaneous, and closely blended also with the brilliant achievements of Edward III. and the Black Prince ; the still more brilliant achievements of Henry V. and his heroic brothers, Bedford, Clarence, and Gloucester ; the dark tragedies of Eichard II. and the Tower innocents ; the fierce internecine strug- gles of the rival Koses ; the transfer on the bloody field of Bosworth, of the sceptre of England from the hands of • Hell's black intelli- gencer,' Richard Plantagenet, to those of the mean but sensible Henry Tudor ; and the accession to the throne of England of that evil instrument of mighty change, the intended Cardinal but actual ecclesiastical revolutionist, Henry VIII. In many of the acts of this most dramatic epoch of our national history, the De la Poles played a prominent and distinguished part, rising rapidly and surely, during its chequered progress, from the counting-house to the man- sion, and from the mansion to the palace ; ascending from the office in High-street, through the various steps of knight-banneret, baron, earl, marquis, duke, and prince, to the very foot of the throne ; and but for a turn in the strong tide of their high fortune giving to England itself a monarch and founder of a new dynasty, in the person of that half Plantagenet half De la Pole, the young Earl of Lincoln, who died in the battle of Stoke under the banner of that vulgar sham, Lambert Simnel.\" William de la Pole, an eminent merchant of the old Scandinavian settlement of Ravenspurne, at the mouth of the Humber, is said by Tickell to be the \" second son of a knight of that name.\" In con- sequence of the decline of his native town he took up his abode in Hull, where he carried on an extensive commerce, and acquired much wealth.* He had, by his wife Dame Elena, three sons, Richard, William, and John, whom Mr. Kemp designated \"the Rothschilds and Barings of their age,\" and \" two of them, but par- * \" Whether the De la roles, Earls and Dukes of Suffolk, deduce their descent from William de la Pole, merchant, of Totness, in Devonshire, in the days of King Henry III., we have not been able to ascertain. That they do count among their forefathers, William de la Pole, merchant of Hull, who lived in the following reign, is a fact which is clearly established. This William de la Pole was, by Elena his wife, the father of three sons, Pdehard, William, and John, all of whom are styled ' our merchants,' in grants of King Edward III. Owing to the important situations 36 HISTORY OF KINGSTON-UrON-HULL. ticularly William, the ancestors of men and women of brilliant fortunes and historic importance.\" William de la Pole died at Hull, and his widow afterwards married a Hull merchant named John Rotenheryng, who, in 1328, founded a chantry in Holy Trinity Church. They had a daughter, Alicia Rotenherying, who was en- trusted by her father's will to the care of her half-brother, William, the second of the great Hull firm of \" De la Pole Brothers.\" The Eev. H. A. Napier tells us that in 1316, \"Richard Atte Pole of Hull \" received letters of safe conduct from the King (Edward II.) on his going to foreign parts to bring corn and other provisions into England: and the King took security of him that such corn and provisions should not be carried either to Flanders or to the Scots. This Richard, who was the eldest of the three brothers above-men- tioned, was appointed (according to the same author), in 1327, \" Capitalis Pincerna, or Chief Butler under King Edward the Third.\" This office would appear to have been one of considerable importance, for we find that Richard had under him more than twenty deputies in the various ports of England and Ireland. Richard appears to have transacted a considerable business with the King in virtue of his office of chief butler. In June, 1327, the King commanded his Treasurers and Chamberlains to pay him (Richard) £1,000. for wines for the expenses of the royal household, and of the army proceeding towards Scotland. In the following month the King ordered the sum of £2,000. to be paid to his butler. The King made the first order for payment at York, and the second at Topcliffe, near Thirsk, in Yorkshire. The brothers De la Pole were likewise the King's Bankers. In August, 1327, the King acknowledged a debt of £2,000. due to Richard de la Pole, and William his brother; besides £4,000. previously lent him, and paid at York, by William de la Pole, for the expedition of the war in Scotland. The first-named sum was to be repaid out of the old and new customs of the ports of Kingston-upon-Hull and St. Botolph, and under the crown which the two elder brothers held, and the high terms of com- mendation in which all of them are spoken of by the King, we are satisfied in finding them honoured and respected as individuals, without further enquiry into the origin of their family.\" Historical Notices of Swyncombe and Ewelme, by the Hon. and Kev Henry Alfred Napier, M.A., Hector of Swyncombe, 4to., 1858. HISTORY OF KINGSTON-UrON-IIULL. 37 also out of the duty paid on wool, skins, and hides in these ports. In December (same year) the King acknowledged a loan of £1,200. for the brothers Eichard and William de la Pole, for affairs of mo- ment, and promised to pay the same out of the customs in the port of the town of St. Botolph. In February, 1328, the King, when at York, signed an order in favour of Richard de la Pole, his butler, for 2,000 marks, for wine supplied to the royal household ; and in the following month an order for £1,200. for the same purpose. In the same month (March) the King acknowledged a loan made to him by the two brothers De la Pole, of £500., for the expenses of the royal household. Later, in the same year, the De la Poles undertook to find £20. every day for the support of the King's household, and as much wine as might be necessary for the same household. To secure the repayment of these monies, the customs on the staple articles in various ports were assigned to the lenders. These and many other transactions of this nature between the King and the De la Poles are noticed in Napier's History of Swyncombe and Ewelme. Richard de la Pole died in 1345, and was buried in Holy Trinity Church, and his son, William de la Pole (afterwards knighted) succeeded to the possession of his wealth. The male branch of Richard's descendants soon ran out, but the female branch is rep- resented amongst the nobility of our own times. Richard's great grandaughter, Joan, was, by right of her mother, the Baroness Cob- ham. This lady had five husbands, viz., Sir Robert Hemengdale, Sir Reginald Braybrooke, Sir Nicholas Hawberke, Sir John Old- castle, and Sir John Harpden. The fourth-mentioned Knight (and in right of his wife, Baron Cobham) figures in history as a martyr to Lollardism. In 1413 Thomas Arundal, Archbishop of Canter- bury, and his suffragan, condemned him to the flames as a heretic ; he was accordingly sent to the Tower, from which he afterwards escaped ; but four years later he was apprehended and hanged as a traitor ; his body being burnt in accordance with the ecclesiastical sentence pronounced by Archbishop Arundal. Joan had a daughter by her second husband, who married Sir Thomas Broke, and the representative of this pair, in the female line, was the late extrava- gant Duke of Buckingham and Chandos. In the month of October, 1332, Edward III,, on his way to join 38 HISTORY OF KTNGSTON-UPON-HULL. his army in the north, paid a visit to Hull, and was entertained by William de la Pole with the greatest possible magnificence. Being highly pleased with the excellent fortifications of the place, and the reception he had met with, the monarch knighted his generous host before he took his departure. Tickell tells us that it was on this occasion he changed the government of the town from a Bailiff to the more honourable degree and dignity of a Mayor and four Bailiffs ; but Mr. Frost states that the charter conveying this grant is dated 6th of May, 1331. Sir William de la Pole filled the office of Mayor in 1333, and again in the year 1335 ; and other authorities state that he was the first Mayor of Hull, and that he continued in that office for the first three years. In 1335 Sir William de la Pole engaged to supply the King's household with the daily sum of £10. for a whole year. On the 15th of April, in the same year, William de la Pole and Kichard his brother, had granted to them the custody of the King's Manor of Kingston-upon-Hull, and all other things appertaining to them, as well as the custody of the vill of Kingston-upon-Hull, with a salary of £100. a year, which had been held by Kobert de Hastang, and was then vacant by his death. The brothers De la Pole like- wise had the farm of the Burgh of Kingston-upon-Hull, which the King, by his charter, in 1331, had granted to the Mayor, Bailiffs, and good men of that vill for an annual rent of £70., to be paid at the Exchequer. In 1336 the King acknowledged a debt of £3,027. to William de la Pole. In August, 1338, William de la Pole had a grant of the office of Mayor of the Staple at Antwerp, during the King's pleasure. During the war with France in 1339, which followed Edward's claim to that kingdom, from which he was excluded by the Salic law, the reader of English history is well aware of the straits to which the King was reduced, through the want of money to support his army. During his long stay at Brabant he endeavoured to borrow of all the foreign princes who were able to supply him, and he even found himself under the necessity of applying to private persons to take up such sums as they were willing to lend. His own and the Queen's jewels were in pawn ; the crown of England was in pawn to the Archbishop of Treves, for the payment of 50,000 HISTOKY OF KINGSTON-UPON-nULL. 39 golden florins ; and indeed the King himself was in pawn, for he was engaged not to sail to England without the permission of his creditors. At this critical period William de la Pole, with other commissioners of the English monarch, entered into a convention with the Archhishop of Treves respecting the repayment of these 50,000 florins and other monies which had been lent to the King. At this time Edward acknowledged himself \" bound to his beloved merchant, William de la Pole, for £76, 180., which sum he faith- fully promised to pay off before the end of the year. In order to raise this extraordinary sum, Sir William was obliged to mortgage the whole of his property.* This act of loyal devotion was generously rewarded by Edward, in various ways. He made the Hull Merchant a Knight Banneret in the field,t and by letters patent conferred on him and his heirs 500 marks per ann. in crown rents, with a promise of an additional thousand marks per annum, in case he recovered his right of inheri- tance within the kingdom of France. As soon as Edward returned from France, he made Sir William first Gentleman of the Bed-cham- ber, then Lord of the Seigniory of Holderness, and he afterwards advanced him to other places of honour and emolument, and at length made him a Baron of the Exchequer. William de la Pole continued to advance loans for the use of the King up to the year 1352, when, according to the letters patent, he was said to be impotent and of great age. Indeed, he helped his Sovereign with money long after he (Sir William) had retired into comparative seclusion. In every stage of his progress the princely merchant continued a constant benefactor to the town of Kingston-upon-Hull, and availing * This was an immense sum in those days, when wheat could he bought for 3s. 4d. a quarter, a fat sheep for Cd., and six pigeons for Id., and when the daily pay of an Earl attending the King in time of war was 6s. 8d. ; in modern times the exact cost of a few minutes interview with an attorney. + Speed says (726 h) \" The first raiser of the De la Poles was Edward the Third, who made William de la Pole of a brave merchant a Knight Banneret, and gave him great possessions, in requital of an extraordinary and voluntary loan of treasure advanced by him, to supply the King at a time of special necessity, when money could stand him in more stead than a thousand men at arms : no little merit in a subject, nor a slender reward of a most munificent Prince.\" 40 HISTORY OF KINGSTON-UPON-HULL. himself of the favour of his Sovereign, he ohtained for it an increase of its privileges and immunities ; and the De la Poles became to this place what the Cliffords were to Skipton, and the Talbots to Sheffield. Before his death, which happened in 1300, he founded a monastery and hospital here, to the glory of God and the benefit of the poor; but he was summoned from this world before the house was complete, and his son and successor, Sir Michael de la Pole, completed the pious work. Sir William and his lady were buried in the chancel of the Church of the Ploly Trinity, Hull. Sir Michael was no less a favourite with Richard II. than his father had been with Edward III. In 1354 (in which year he probably attained his majority) he granted a charter of free warren in all his demesne lands within his lordships of Blyburgh, Lin- colnshire ; Gressetthorpe, Notts. ; and Grafton, Northamptonshire. About the same time we find him in the retinue of Henry Duke of Lancaster, and embarking in an expedition then made against France. Four years later he took part in the great invasion of France, on which occasion the greatest nobles and most illustrious warriors of England attended their Sovereign. A little later he married the daughter and heiress of Sir John Wingfield, Knt., of Wingfield, in the county of Suffolk — whose mother was heir of Gil- bert Glanville, Earl of Suffolk, and in whose right the Earldom was afterwards conferred upon him (Sir Michael de la Pole). By this lady he had seven children. When war broke out again between France and England, we find the Knight Banneret, Sir Michael de la Pole, in the train of the highest and bravest warriors of the land, doing battle for the honour of old England. The Hull Knight ever fights under the banner of the Duke of Lancaster. By a deed bearing date September 13, 1374, Edward III. ack- nowledged himself indebted to his faithful and beloved Michael de la Pole for the sum of £1,800., and awarding him, by way of pay- ment, £750. out of the tenth recently granted by the clergy, £500. out o"
