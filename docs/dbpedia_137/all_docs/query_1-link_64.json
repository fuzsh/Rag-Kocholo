        "text": "Physical Activity and Health Promotion\n\nPokémon GO or Gone? Using Apps to Promote Physical Activity\n\nJeffery K. Ward, Nikki L. Hollett, and Andy F. Stringfellow, Auburn University (jkw0026@tigermail.auburn.edu)\n\nBackground/Purpose: Physical activity is a pervasive problem in today’s society, as most individuals do not meet the recommended amounts of physical activity each day. In an effort to encourage activity and stimulate interest in movement, Pokémon GO (an app designed to catch Pokémon by walking a certain distance) inadvertently motivates users to be physical. The purpose of this study was to understand the impact of Pokémon GO on user’s physical activity.\n\nMethod: Researchers recruited participants (n = 122) to participate in a 13 item questionnaire. The questionnaire was developed to determine the experiences using Pokémon GO as it pertains to physical activity. Participants included 78 females, and 44 males (Mage = 22.5) from the southeastern region of the United States.\n\nAnalysis/Results: Results from the questionnaire indicated users were more motivated to play the game because they had a target to reach, specifically to catch all the Pokémon. Active users claimed they would do what was necessary to complete the task, including the required distance. When asked about acknowledging their own physical activity levels, users were more conscious of playing for fun, rather than improving their fitness.\n\nConclusions: This study shows Pokémon GO was effective in promoting physical activity, by motivating users with a target or challenge. While the results show that users increased their physical activity levels in the short term, an understanding of the long-term effects need to be studied.\n\nTrends in Estimated Aerobic Capacity Over a Two-Year CSPAP\n\nRyan D. Burns and Timothy A. BrusseauF, University of Utah–Salt Lake City (ryan.d.burns@utah.edu)\n\nBackground/Purpose: The purpose of this study was to explore the longitudinal trends in estimated aerobic capacity over a two-year Comprehensive School Physical Activity Program (CSPAP) in a large sample of inner-city children.\n\nMethod: The sample consisted of 1,440 school-aged children (Mage = 9.2, SD = 1.5 years; 711 girls; 729 boys) recruited from grades 1 through 6. The children were enrolled in four “Title 1” public schools that were part of a school district within the Mountain West Region of the United States. All schools participated in a CSPAP funded by a Carol M. White PEP Grant. Estimated aerobic capacity (VO2peak) was assessed using the Progressive Aerobic Cardiovascular Endurance Run (PACER) that was administered during each child’s physical education class. VO2 Peak was calculated from a validated regression model using completed PACER laps and age as predictor variables. Data were collected at the beginning and ending of two consecutive school years (4 time-points total; time-point 1 = baseline, time-point 4 = end of program). A three-way 4 × 2 × 4 ANOVA test with repeated measures was employed to examine the variability in estimated VO2peak across schools, between sexes, and across the four time-points. Additionally, a Markov transition model was used to examine the change in odds of a child meeting age- and sex-specific FitnessGram® standards for aerobic capacity at each time-point.\n\nAnalysis/Results: There were statistically significant time main effects (F = 10.0, p < .001) that were not modified by school affiliation or sex, as evidenced by a non-significant interactions (p > .05). There were higher levels of aerobic capacity seen at the end of the two-year CSPAP with statistically significant differences between time-point 4 and time-point 1 (Mean difference = 2.0 mL/kg/min, p < .001, Cohen’s d = 0.38) and time-point 4 and time-point 3 (Mean difference = 1.5 mL/kg/min, p < .001, Cohen’s d = 0.27). Categorically, there were greater odds of a child meeting FitnessGram®’s age- and sex-specific standards for estimated aerobic capacity at the end of the program compared to baseline (OR = 1.07, p = .011).\n\nConclusions: There were higher levels of estimated aerobic capacity seen at the end of a two-year CSPAP compared to baseline. Because higher levels of aerobic capacity have been linked to favorable cardio-metabolic profiles in addition to better cognitive functioning, multi-year CSPAPs have the potential to significantly improve the health of children.\n\nEffect of SPARK on Segmented Physical Activity in Incarcerated Adolescents\n\nTimothy A. BrusseauF and Ryan D. Burns, University of Utah–Salt Lake City; and James C. HannonF, West Virginia University–Morgantown (tim.brusseau@utah.edu)\n\nBackground/Purpose: The efficacy of established physical activity interventions in incarcerated adolescent boys is largely unknown. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of a Sports, Play, and Recreation for Kids (SPARK) intervention on segmented daily physical activity in adolescent boys being rehabilitated within the Juvenile Justice System.\n\nMethod: The sample consisted of 60 adolescent boys (Mage = 17.1 years, SD = 1.0 year) recruited from two Juvenile Justice System secure facilities. The SPARK program was implemented across two-years at each facility. Physical activity was examined across four time-points (baseline, 3 follow-up) using an accelerometer during the following segments: before school, during school, after school, total weekday (Monday—Friday), total weekend (Saturday and Sunday), and the total week (Monday—Sunday). Physical activity was assessed using the percentage of accelerometer wear-time within each segment for sedentary time (%SED) and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (%MVPA). Trends in %SED and %MVPA were assessed using one-way ANOVA tests with repeated measures and simple contrasts comparing all follow-up time-points to baseline. Because of multiple comparisons, the alpha level was modified using the Bonferroni adjustment.\n\nAnalysis/Results: For the total week, there was significantly lower %SED at the second follow-up time-point compared to baseline (Mean difference = −10.6%, p < .001) and significantly higher %MVPA compared to baseline (Mean difference = + 3.0%, p < .001). There was also significantly lower %SED before school (Mean difference = −7.2%, p < .001), after school (Mean difference = −5.8%, p < .001) and during the weekend (Mean difference = −12.5%, p < .001) at the second follow-up time-point compared to baseline. Regarding %MVPA, there was higher %MVPA before school (Mean difference = + 3.1%, p < .001), after school (Mean difference = + 2.3%, p < .001), and during the weekdays (Mean difference = + 3.3%, p < .001) compared to baseline. No significant changes were found across the other follow-up time-points.\n\nConclusions: The SPARK program significantly increased segmented physical activity and reduced segmented sedentary time in incarcerated adolescent boys during the early portions of the intervention.\n\nMeta-Analysis of School-Based Physical Activity Interventions on Physical Activity Enjoyment\n\nRyan D. Burns, University of Utah–Salt Lake City; and You Fu, University of Nevada–Reno (ryan.d.burns@utah.edu)\n\nBackground/Purpose: Physical activity enjoyment is important for increasing and sustaining physical activity behaviors in children. Several school-based interventions have targeted physical activity enjoyment as an outcome variable, however no study to date has investigated the interventions’ cumulative effect. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to perform a meta-analysis examining the effectiveness of school-based physical activity interventions on increasing physical activity enjoyment in children using quasi-experimental and experimental studies published within the past 15 years.\n\nMethod: An extensive internet search with several databases using the keywords “Children”, “Enjoyment”, “Physical Activity”, and “Schools” was performed resulting in over 200 published studies within the past 15 years. Studies were eliminated based on the lack of experimental manipulation (i.e., non-intervention studies), no assessment of physical activity enjoyment as an outcome variable, a lack of a control or comparison group, and no reporting of the effect estimate’s variability (i.e., no reporting of the standard deviation, standard error, etc.). This procedure resulted in 10 studies being examined in the meta-analysis. The DerSimonian and Laird random effects model was employed with studies being weighted by sample size. The overall pooled standardized mean difference (SMD) was reported with corresponding 95% Confidence Interval. Heterogeneity across studies was quantitatively analyzed using Cochran’s Q test (with alpha set at p < .10) and the I2 statistic. Publication bias was assessed by visual inspection of a Funnel Plot. Additionally, Funnel Plot asymmetry was examined using the Egger linear regression test. The Funnel Plot was determined asymmetrical (suggesting publication bias) if the intercept from the Egger regression model significantly deviated from 0. All analyses were conducted using STATA v.14.0 statistical software package (College Station, TX, USA).\n\nAnalysis/Results: The overall pooled effect was SMD = 0.38 (95% C.I. [0.17–0.59]), which was characterized as a small-to-medium effect size. The model z-statistic = 3.50 (p < .001), suggesting that the pooled effect is not equal to 0, rejecting the null hypothesis. However, Cochran’s Q test showed statistical significance (p < .001) and the I2 = 76.6%, indicating large heterogeneity across studies. Visual inspection of the Funnel Plot showed slight asymmetry and the Egger regression model yielded an intercept coefficient that was statistically significant (bias = 3.28, 95% C.I. [0.21–6.36], p = .039), indicating the presence of publication bias.\n\nConclusions: The results of this meta-analysis provides evidence that school-based physical activity interventions can be effective on increasing physical activity enjoyment in children based on the examination of intervention studies published within the past 15 years, however the magnitude of the pooled effect was small-to-moderate and there was evidence for publication bias and large between-study heterogeneity.\n\nRelationships Between Fitness Test Scores and Students’ Attitudes\n\nKevin Mercier, Anne Gibbone, and Corinne Donovan, Adelphi University–Garden City (kmercier@adelphi.edu)\n\nBackground/Purpose: Physical education has been identified as a place to promote physical activity and fitness to help combat childhood obesity. Students’ attitudes toward physical education can impact decisions to be physically active outside of school. Overall student attitudes toward physical education decrease over time and at a sharper rate for females. Fitness tests are the most common assessment of students in physical education. How fitness tests are experienced and implemented could impact student attitudes. The purpose of the study is to examine the relationships between fitness test scores and changes in attitudes.\n\nMethod: Students from two school districts (District 1, n = 160, District 2, n = 251) constituted the sample for this study (Male, n = 209, Female n = 202, sixth grade n = 164, seventh grade n = 108, eighth grade n = 139). FitnessGram® assessments (PACER, push-up, curl-up, sit and reach) were administered by physical education teachers and recorded. A previously validated attitude instrument was also administered by physical education teachers. Researchers were on-site, at times, to ensure testing and survey protocols were followed.\n\nAnalysis/Results: Attitude survey results and fitness test scores were entered into Excel then SPSS, along with student name, gender, grade, teacher. Results from the attitude survey were reversed coded and attitude scores were calculated. Fitness test scores were coded either 1 = Pass and 2 = Fail. A passing score was earned if the student met or passed the Healthy Fitness Zone criteria from FintessGram™. Reliability coefficients were determined and Chi-Square analysis between attitude and fitness test scores for variables including gender and grade were calculated. Results of interest include: Overall Attitude and Fitness Test Scores: Significant relationships between positive attitudes and passing Sit and Reach and Curl-ups. Gender and Fitness Test Scores: Significant relationships between positive attitudes and males on PACER, push-ups, and curl-ups, and between positive attitudes and females on curl-ups and sit and reach. Grade Level and Fitness Test Scores: Significant relationship for all 4 fitness tests with positive attitudes for 6th graders.\n\nConclusions: The relationship between decreasing overall attitudes and fitness test scores on the PACER and Push-up tests may have occurred because these tests are higher effort tests compared to the Sit and Reach and Curl-up tests. Students may not see the importance or enjoyment of the higher effort tests hence they did not perform to full capacity. Prior research suggests that physical education teachers often create a pro-male environment during fitness testing which may have contributed to gender related differences. Grade level results align with previous research suggesting that attitudes decrease starting in sixth grade. Our data suggest that a relationship between performance on fitness test and having positive attitudes is strong in 6th grade, but this relationship decreases over time. It could be that students dislike of fitness tests contributes to the decline of this relationship and helps us to understand why students attitudes toward physical education decreases. Research cites repetition of activities, boredom, and lack of fun in physical education as reasons for decreased attitudes—fitness testing may contribute to the decreases in positive attitudes for these reasons.\n\nIntervention to Increase Physical Activity During Physical Education: A Pilot\n\nR. Glenn Weaver, Collin A. WebsterF, Michael W. Beets, Keith Brazendale, Lauren Schisler, and Mazen Aziz, University of South Carolina–Columbia; and Jessica L. Chandler, Medical University of South Carolina–Charleston (weaverrg@mailbox.sc.edu)\n\nBackground/Purpose: Physical Education (PE) is recognized as the cornerstone of physical activity (PA) promotion efforts in schools. In addition to providing youth with the skills, knowledge, and dispositions necessary for pursuing an active lifestyle, a key aspect of quality PE programming is engaging students in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA). The Society of Health and Physical Educators (SHAPE) America recommends that 50% of PE lesson time be spent in MVPA. Unfortunately, most studies report children are not achieving this benchmark. Thus, interventions that can increase the amount of time students spend in MVPA during PE are needed. Ideally, increases in students’ MVPA during PE would also contribute to gains in total school day PA and advance children toward achieving daily PA guidelines. This study examined the initial effects of a participatory-based, competency/skill building intervention for PE teachers on PA promotion practices and students’ MVPA.\n\nMethod: All elementary schools (n = 8) in one rural school district from a southeastern U.S. state participated in this study. All PE teachers (n = 9) agreed to participate. Students in the first and fourth grades were invited to participate with 1,077 students (514 males) acquiring passive parental consent and providing verbal assent. A total of 823 students (52.8% boys) wore accelerometers at baseline (fall 2015) and outcome (spring 2016) on PE and non-PE days. The System for Observing Fitness Instruction Time+ measured changes in PA promotion practices. Principles of participatory research guided the development of intervention strategies. To facilitate the participatory approach, a working collaborative group consisting of a district level administrator, PE teachers, and university personnel was created to review best practice guidelines related to promoting PA in PE and identify guidelines and strategies to adopt in the intervention. The collaborative group identified the following strategies to include in the intervention: professional development training, booster workshops, LET US Play principles (i.e., reducing lines, eliminating elimination, reducing team size, getting uninvolved students and teachers involved, by modifying the space, equipment, and rules), increasing activity opportunities while reducing management time, and teaching PE lessons outdoors when possible.\n\nAnalysis/Results: Mixed-model linear regressions estimated adoption of practices identified by the collaborative workgroup and changes in students’ MVPA. Three of the targeted PA promotion practices changed in the desired direction (i.e., reducing lines, increasing activity opportunities, increasing lessons taught outdoors, p < .05). Three additional practices trended in the desired direction (i.e., eliminating elimination, reducing team size, and reducing management time), but were not statistically significant. During PE, statistically significant increases in boys’ (2.8 [95CI = 1.8–3.9]) and girls’ (1.7 [95CI = 0.8–2.4]) minutes of MVPA were observed. However, there were no statistically significant changes in boys’ or girls’ MVPA during the school day. Increases in boys’, but not girls’, MVPA during PE were associated with higher levels of incorporation of PA promotion practices.\n\nConclusions: Overall, the intervention was effective at increasing teachers’ PA promotion and students’ MVPA in PE. Other school-based strategies that complement and extend efforts targeting PE are recommended to increase children’s total daily PA.\n\nChanges in Physical Activity/Nutrition Knowledge and Enjoyment in CSPAP Schools\n\nTimothy A. BrusseauF, Rose E. Mattson, Ryan D. Burns, Julie M. Metos, and Kristine C. Jordan, University of Utah–Salt Lake CIty (tim.brusseau@Utah.edu)\n\nBackground/Purpose: According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), 17% of children and adolescents ages 2–19 are obese. The prevalence of childhood obesity is higher in minority and low sociodemographic (SES) populations. Comprehensive nutrition and physical activity interventions may decrease the incidence of overweight and obesity in children. The purpose of this study was to explore the change in physical activity knowledge, nutrition knowledge, and physical activity enjoyment scores in low socioeconomic elementary schools during a Comprehensive Physical Activity Program (CSPAP). Secondly, associations between physical activity enjoyment scores and nutrition knowledge were analyzed.\n\nMethod: Two study samples were utilized consisting of n = 504 and n = 800 elementary school children, in grades 3–6, from five Title I schools in Salt Lake City, UT. Students completed three assessments: a physical activity knowledge assessment, a nutrition knowledge survey, and the physical activity enjoyment scale (PACES) that were concurrently administered during school hours.\n\nAnalysis/Results: Using data from the 2015–2016 school year, the change in physical activity knowledge, nutrition knowledge, and PACES scores was assessed using three-factor 4 × 2 × 2 mixed-design ANOVA tests, using grade level, sex, and time factors. The association between the nutrition knowledge and PACES scores was evaluated using Pearson’s correlation coefficients. Physical activity knowledge scores increased significantly (p = .05) from pretest (0.26 ± 0.11) to posttest (0.28 ± 0.12). Additionally, PACES scores increased significantly (p = .02) from pretest (36.84 ± 15.14) to posttest (39.34 ± 14.79). There were no significant moderating effects of grade level and sex. Lastly, higher nutrition knowledge scores were significantly correlated with higher PACES scores, although the correlation was characterized as weak (r = 0.08; p = .02).\n\nConclusions: These results emphasize the importance of providing physical activity and nutrition education for ethnic minority low SES elementary school children. Moreover, these findings demonstrate that improvements in physical activity enjoyment can occur during a five year CSPAP. Increases in physical activity enjoyment and knowledge may translate to increases in chronic physical activity and improve children’s health outcomes.\n\nSedentary Behavior and Metabolic Syndrome in Physically Active Adults\n\nHeontae Kim, Junbae Mun, Seungho Ryu, and Minsoo KangF, Middle Tennessee State University–Murfreesboro (hk3m@mtmail.mtsu.edu)\n\nBackground/Purpose: Sedentary behavior (SB) is associated with metabolic syndrome, independent of moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity (MVPA). That is, SB should be considered a unique behavior, and not simply the lack of MVPA. The need for reducing SB is being recognized in addition to promoting MVPA; however, there has been limited research on the association of SB with metabolic syndrome among those who already meet the physical activity guidelines. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between SB and metabolic syndrome among those who meet the physical activity guidelines.\n\nMethod: Data from the 2003 to 2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) were analyzed for this study. A total of 888 adults (>17 years old), who wore an accelerometer (Actigraph AM-7164) for a minimum of 4 valid days (which included at least 3 week and 1 weekend days) and met the physical activity guideline of 150 min/week of MVPA, were included in the analysis. Accelerometers were used to measure the average duration of minutes spent in SB and MVPA. At least 10 hr of wear time were required to be considered a valid day. A cutoff of < 100 counts/min (cpm) was chosen to categorize SB time. Particularly, SB time is defined as a period of time with at least 1 min with < 100 cpm. Metabolic syndrome was defined according to the ATP III guidelines as meeting three of more of the following criteria: (a) waist circumference ≥102 cm for men and ≥88 cm for women; (b) serum triglyceride level of ≥150 mg/dl; (c) HDL cholesterol level <40 mg/dl for men and <50 mg/dl for women; (d) fasting glucose level ≥100 mg/dl; or (e) systolic blood pressure ≥85 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure ≥130 mmHg. Logistic regression was used to examine the association between SB and metabolic syndrome after controlling for covariates (i.e., age, race/ethnicity, gender, education, income, smoking, alcohol consumption, and obesity status). The SAS v9.4 SURVEYLOGISTIC procedure was used to account for the complex nature of the NHANES sampling scheme.\n\nAnalysis/Results: Analysis revealed that an estimated 22.4% reported metabolic syndrome among those who already met the physical activity guidelines. Participants in the fourth quartile of SB time (≥ 539 mins/day) were more likely to report metabolic syndrome (OR = 2.92; 95% CI: 1.29, 6.62) compared to those in the first quartile of SB time (≤ 380 mins/day). Also, participants in the third quartile of SB time (454–539 mins/day) were more likely to report metabolic syndrome (OR = 1.95; 95% CI: 1.12, 3.40) compared to those in the first quartile of SB time (≤ 380 mins/day).\n\nConclusions: These findings suggest that even in those who meet the physical activity guidelines, detrimental associations with metabolic syndrome are observed with increasing SB time.\n\nDo Korean Adolescents Actively Participate in Physical Education Classes?\n\nSae-Hyung Kim, Chungbuk National University–Cheongju; and Dongwook Cho, Alcorn State University–Lorman (ksme@cbne.ac.kr)\n\nBackground/Purpose: The benefits of physical activity in adolescence have been well established that it would be able to improve cardiorespiratory and muscular fitness, bone health, and cardiovascular and metabolic health (WHO, 2017). Additionally, adolescents’ physical activity also can have a positive influence on anxiety and depression, can promote mental health, and can improve the academic performance (CDC, 2010). It is recommended for adolescences to provide at least 60 min of moderate to vigorous-intensity physical activity daily (WHO, 2017). Burgeson (2011) indicated only 8% of middle schools and 2% of high school adolescents received daily physical education and 22% of schools did not require students to take any physical education. However, there have been limited researches into the change of physical activity time through physical education classes among Korean adolescents. Furthermore, the purpose of this study was to estimate Korean adolescents’ physical education activity changes (PEAC) levels and to determine if differences occur between male and female adolescents through the five years’ investigation.\n\nMethod: This study was the longitudinal research that the data was sourced from the Korea Children and Youth Panel Survey (KCYPS) over the course of five years from 2010 to 2014. Total 1957 adolescents (Male: 1002 & Female: 955) were investigated for the five years from 7th to 10th grades. The Hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) was utilized to analyze the PEAC levels during the transition into adolescence. Advantages of using HLM is that fixed effect estimates regression equation at the occasion level, and random effect estimates individual change difference of each student. In addition, the HLM 7.01 computer program was used to analyze the longitudinal data in this study with pre-determined alpha set at a p < .05.\n\nAnalysis/Results: Male adolescents’ fixed effect was that year change rate (B = −0.097, t = −8.461, p < .001) and initial status (B = 3.371, t = 104.777 p < .001) showed significant value (estimating regression equation: PEAC = −0.097 × year + 3.371). Overall, male adolescents’ PEAC scores were on the decrease across the five years. Male adolescents’ random effect showed significant value (τ = 0.028 χ2 = 1269.215, p < .001) that means each male adolescent has difference change rate. Female adolescents’ fixed effect was that year change rate (B = −0.166, t = −15.560, p < .001) and initial status (B = 2.792, t = 83.643 p < .001) showed significant value (estimating regression equation: PEAC = −0.166 × year + 2.792). Female adolescents’ level of PEAC were also declined across the five years. Female adolescents’ random effect showed significant value (τ = 0.010 χ2 = 1052.362, p = .014) that means each girl student has difference change rate.\n\nConclusions: This study showed the effect of the time to adolescents’ physical activity through physical education classes. Results showed that Korean male and female adolescents became lower physical activity participation in school as they got the higher grade. The findings of this study might be beneficial for educators or administrators of Korean physical education to recognize the current status of Korean adolescents’ physical activity levels and to notify the difference between male and female adolescents. Additionally, administrators are able to educate the adolescents to know how important physical activity involvements in physical education classes.\n\nPhysical Activity and Motor Skills: Mediating Effect of Perceived Competence\n\nYou Fu and Karla Rodriguez, University of Nevada–Reno; and Ryan Burns, University of Utah–Salt Lake City (youf@unr.edu)\n\nBackground/Purpose: Evidence suggests that the relationship between physical activity participation and gross motor competence may be bi-directional. What is unclear is the extent to which various motivational constructs may mediate this relationship in children. The purpose of this study was to examine the linear relationship between school day step counts and gross motor skills testing various motivational constructs (perceived competence, enjoyment, self-efficacy) as potential mediators.\n\nMethod: The convenience sample consisted of 66 sixth grade children (Mage = 11.6 0.5 years; 30 boys, 36 girls) recruited from one public school located in the Western Region of the United States. The majority of the children in this study were of an ethnic minority (83%) and more than 95% of them were from low-income families. The children wore a pedometer for one school week between the hours of 8 am and 3 pm. Gross motor skills were collected during each child’s physical education class using the Test for Gross Motor Development-3rd Edition (TGMD-3). Motivational constructs were also collected during physical education using validated questionnaires. Variables used in the analysis included average school day step counts, total gross motor scores (locomotor skills + ball skills), and separate motivational constructs including perceived competence, physical activity enjoyment, and self-efficacy. A bootstrap causal mediation analysis was employed using step counts as the primary predictor variable, total gross motor skill scores as the outcome variable, and the motivational constructs as potential mediators. Each motivational construct was tested separately for mediating effects. Parameter estimates of interest included the direct effect, average causal mediating effect (ACME), and total effects that were calculated across 1,000 bootstrap iterations.\n\nAnalysis/Results: The results from the mediation analysis yielded a statistically significant ACME using perceived competence as the mediator (ACME = 0.0010, 95% C.I. [0.0001, 0.0024], p < .05) and a statistically significant total effect using perceived competence as the mediator (total effect = 0.0030, 95% C.I. [0.00050, 0.0056], p < .05). Perceived competence mediated 33.5% of the total effect between school day steps and gross motor skills with the entire model explaining approximately 14.3% of the variance in motor skills. Physical activity enjoyment and self-efficacy were not significant mediators.\n\nConclusions: The results of this mediation study add on the literature that the relationship between physical activity and gross motor skills may be partially mediated through perceived competence in sixth-grade children participating in physical education class. Interventions aimed at improving children’s perceived competence might lead to the positive changes in their physical activity participation and motor skill development.\n\nAquaponics: An Assessment of Physical Activity, Nutrition, and Health Consciousness\n\nMatthew R. Bice, Nate Bickford, Sonja Bickford, Angela Hollman, and Richard C. Meyer, University of Nebraska–Kearney; James W. Ball, Northeastern Illinois University–Chicago; and Eric M. Wiedenman, Southern Illinois University–Carbondale (bicemr@unk.edu)\n\nBackground/Purpose: Teaching health within the constraints of schools can be a difficult task for teachers and in many cases addressed in Physical Education or Science classes. Aquaponics gardening systems are self-sufficient growing systems that supports the life cycles of both plants and fish. These systems are becoming an increasingly popular teaching tool for health education. The notion is that if children are taught how to eat healthy by growing food that is healthy; in return, children make healthier decisions. Aquaponics growing systems are not limited to supplementing health education but also promote various aspects of science. The purpose of this study is to describe how aquaponics growing systems can be used to promote health, help students understand energy balance (intake versus expenditure), and serve as an alternative form of untraditional physical activity that can help students remain active. The current project is currently funded by the Nebraska Coordinating Commission of Post Secondary Education.\n\nMethod: Participants: Participants included Rural schools (n = 18) located in the state of Nebraska. Schools were recruited to participate and partake in three workshops that taught teachers how to use Aquaponics growing systems as a teaching model to promote personal health. Protocol: The workshops focused on (a) instructing teachers how to build, maintain, and sustain Aquaponics growing systems and (b) how to use systems as a means of health promotion via physical activity and nutrition. Teachers and students were assessed throughout the 1-year intervention at three different time periods. Assessment: Teachers and students completed survey packets that included demographic information, (a) physical activity behaviors, (b) nutrition behaviors, and (c) health consciousness. Further, teachers additionally completed scales that included innovation perceptions and perceived wellness while students additionally completed additional scales that included motivation toward science learning and life satisfaction. Each survey scale was found to be valid and reliable sources of research data collection. This study was approved by IRB (#050817–1).\n\nAnalysis/Results: Data were analyzed for both teachers and students at participating schools. Correlations were used to examine relationships among variables, ANOVA/MANOVA were utilized to compare variable/group differences, and repeated measures analysis were used to examine change over the course of the intervention. Results from this project will be presented as well as provide tips and strategies of what worked in implementation.\n\nConclusions: Many people believe that they can only obtain adequate physical activity levels through sporting activities. Gardening is considered a lost art that could serve as the bridge to combat obesity. Many children, and even adults, do not understand where food comes from. Growing programs are not new, but using school growing programs, such as aquaponics, as a health promotion tactic is a novel approach. This presentation will present longitudinal results of how a nontraditional activity altered behaviors and taught skills that can be used over the course of a lifetime.\n\nChildren’s Perspectives on After-School Physical Activity\n\nJason P. Edwards, Bryan A. McCullickF, Phillip D. Tomporowski, and Jessica Gilbert, University of Georgia–Athens (jasonedwards2828@gmail.com)\n\nBackground/Purpose: Given that some scholars have calculated that only 31.9% of children are physically active enough to be classified as being at a healthy level (Lee et al., 2016), after-school programs (ASPs) appear to provide children excellent opportunities to participate in developmentally appropriate physical activity (PA). However, one major issue facing these programs is the lack of standards and guidelines for the design and delivery of the PA (Beets, Wallner, & Beighle, 2010). This is especially important because while school-day physical education (PE) is staffed by certified personnel and the children are grouped in a homogenous manner (same grade/age), ASP PA faces inherent issues regarding the design and delivery of quality PA instruction (Beets, Wallner, & Beighle, 2010). Most ASP PA programs are staffed by non-certified personnel and PA experiences are often en masse which increases the heterogeneity of the children’s skill, comfortability, and physical size. One step toward improving children’s ASP PA experiences is to learn more about what children think about their participation in it. The purpose of this study was to analyze children’s perspectives of their participation in developmentally appropriate ASP PA.\n\nMethod: Children (N = 42) enrolled in an after-school physical activity program at two elementary schools participated in small group interviews over a 2-month period. Interviews were transcribed and inductively analyzed.\n\nAnalysis/Results: Three themes emerged from the data regarding the children’s participation experiences: (a) “choice will dictate,” (b) “moving rules and waiting drools,” and (c) “comfort level is paramount.” The data revealed that these children were more likely to participate for a longer duration and with more vigor when they were able to choose activities in which to participate. Once these children were participating, it was clear that they had no tolerance for waiting and wanted to move. Finally, one major barrier to any participation was perceived discomfort predicated on skill and size differential.\n\nConclusions: These findings are a first-step toward developing best practices and guidelines for ASP PA design and delivery. Considering that researchers have found that PA levels are far below recommendations (Beets, Huberty, & Beighle, 2012) these findings provide important considerations for any debate on what ASP PA should look like. While school-day PE and ASP PA should both be fertile places for children’s PA, any development of guidelines for ASP PA should be done accounting for the fact that the environment and intent of each is fraught with complexities that influence the quantity and quality of children’s PA.\n\nEvaluation of Active Academics on Student Classroom Physical Activity\n\nAdam J Keath, Anderson University–Westminster; Eloise ElliottF, Hannah Kipfer, Annie Machamer, and Stephanie McWilliams, West Virginia University–Morgantown; and Stephen HarveyF, Ohio University (ajkeath@mix.wvu.edu)\n\nBackground/Purpose: Active Academics (AA) a classroom-based physical activity program has been developed to help classroom teachers incorporate physical activity into regular classroom instruction and provide a resource for teachers to use to identify energizer activities throughout the school day. The purpose of this study was to evaluate student daily physical activity as a result of implementing the AA program during a normal school day.\n\nMethod: Prior to implementation of the project, all classroom teachers in the selected schools were given a three day professional development training on utilizing AA in the classroom. Upon completion of the training teachers who consented to participate were purposefully selected to be a part of this project. Data collection occurred in the spring of 2016 and included teachers and students from two elementary schools. A total of eight teachers were included from both groups (n = 8), from school 1 there were a total of five teachers (two 1st grade, three 3rd grade a) with an average of 8.57 years of teaching experience. School 2 had a total of four teachers, (two 1st grade, and two 3rd grade teachers) with a total of 15.75 years teaching experience. Baseline data was collected on student’s current physical activity during the school day prior to the use of Active Academics lessons, using Polar Active wrist worn accelerometers. After completion of baseline physical activity measurement teachers implemented the use of AA lessons by incorporating at least three AA activities of the teachers choosing during that school day. Teachers implemented AA lessons for a two-week intervention period and completed logs to verify that they had completed at least three activities per day. Data was discarded if a teacher did not complete the required three activities for that day.\n\nAnalysis/Results: Repeated measures mixed effects models, accounting for multiple measures per child, were used to estimate differences in the percent of time children spent in MVPA during a school day where teachers implemented Active Academics lessons versus a traditional school day. Statistically significant increases were found in student MVPA across all classes between baseline and Active Academics school days (10.2%, p = .002).\n\nConclusions: Pressure on administrators and teachers to increase academic achievement for students has resulted in a reduction of physical education and recess time. Research suggest that this reduced time in physical activity actually negatively impacts students’ academic achievement. However, that has not slowed the reduction in opportunities for PA throughout the school day. Active Academics allows teacher to incorporate PA throughout the school day without sacrificing “academic learning time” by incorporating PA into the academic content. Programs like Active Academics which in this case resulted in an increase of 10% are necessary tools for teachers to incorporate to achieve at least 60 min of PA per day and should be incorporated into existing comprehensive school physical activities programs. Additional research is needed to evaluate how teachers perceive the use of Active Academics as a part of their curriculum.\n\nStakeholders’ Views of Culture Changes Promoting Healthy Schools\n\nCees T. Whisonant, Janelle Griffo, Pamela Hodges KulinnaF, Shannon Mulhearn, and Hyeonho Yu, Arizona State University (cwhisona@asu.edu)\n\nBackground/Purpose: Systems Theory (Bertalanffy, 1968) and the Comprehensive School Physical Activity Program model (CSPAP; CDC, 2013) were used to frame this study aimed to determine stakeholder (students/teachers) perceptions of comprehensive school health change initiatives. With an intention to gauge overall culture change, we sought perspectives from a wide array of stakeholders. Programs guided by the Fitness for Life curricular model (www.Fitnessforlife.org) included targeted professional development and were adapted to meet the needs of each school site (including classroom physical activity, additional physical activity opportunities, expanded equipment for semi-structured recess, learning opportunities for healthy behavior knowledge, community/family events, and the promotion of healthy food choices).\n\nMethod: Participants included 45 teachers and 62 students from four schools (18% to 27% of the participants from each school) in the Southwestern United States. Students ranged from Kindergarten to 11th grade [boys (n = 30) girls (n = 32); ethnic background (1 student missing response) Caucasian (n = 58.1%), Hispanic (n = 35.5%), and African American (n = 4.8%)]. Teachers participating in the study taught Kindergarten through 12th grade [male (n = 1) female (n = 44); ethnic background Caucasian (n = 22), Hispanic (n = 1), no response (n = 22)]. Participants completed a short questionnaire with open-ended questions. Students were asked what aspects of the program they liked best and what they considered to be their biggest success during the year. Teachers reported what factors they felt best assisted them in creating a healthier school culture and about their biggest successes of the year.\n\nAnalysis/Results: Constant comparison was used to identify overall themes across and within participant groups (students and teachers). Researcher triangulation and negative case searches were conducted to establish trustworthiness (e.g., Lincoln & Guba, 1985). Teachers frequently mentioned a combination of workshops, resources, stakeholder buy-in, and coordinator efforts as the most important factors contributing to the culture changes in their schools. Success themes across teachers and students included: (a) students enjoying leadership experiences (student physical activity break leaders); (b) student improved focus in the classroom; (c) fun/enjoyment (across all components of the project including recess changes); and (d) exercise (the opportunity for all stakeholders to be more active at school); while teachers alone identified important healthy behavior student learning outcomes.\n\nConclusions: Stakeholders mentioned experiences with several CSPAP components (e.g., Physical Education, physical activity during the school day [physical activity breaks, recess], and family/community programming) as contributing to creating healthier school cultures. Systems theory reinforces the need for a multi-perspective analysis of any organization. Through the varied perspectives (across grade levels, roles within the schools, stakeholder group, etc.) we can begin to appreciate areas of overlap such as biggest successes (e.g., student leadership, more physical activity opportunities at school). Responses suggest that teachers greatly appreciated professional development, resources and support while students enjoyed leadership opportunities and chances to get out of their chairs. These findings further support the need for comprehensive school physical activity programs to be customized to meet the needs of each individual school.\n\nAn Examination of Chinese Physical Fitness Status Considering Geographical Diversity\n\nChangliang Du, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics–Nanjing (duchangliang@nuaa.edu.cn)\n\nBackground/Purpose: Physical fitness has become an increasingly popular topic in modern China. More and more Chinese people think exercising as an important way to improve the quality of life. However, the physical fitness status of people from different areas of China may differ and there is a lack of study on evaluating current fitness status of citizens in China considering geographical diversity. In 2016, we conducted our research in four cities: Beijing, Shanghai, Dalian and Xi’an, using a pre-validated physical fitness level assessment based on the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) fitness index—a composite of indicators for personal health, availability of health care providers and community resources for physical activity. Our study aims to evaluate and compare the physical fitness status of Chinese citizens from different geographical areas.\n\nMethod: Citizens living in Beijing, Shanghai, Dalian and Xi’an aging from 3 to 69 are randomly selected as the research subjects. There are 13550 subjects in total, including both males and females. They are divided into four age groups including the children group (3–6 years old), the teenage group (7–17 years old), the adult group (18–59 years old) and the senior group (60–69 years old). The level of physical fitness of citizens in each group is evaluated by indicators from three aspects including personal health, availability of health care providers and community resources for physical activity. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) is further conducted to analyze the differences between groups.\n\nAnalysis/Results: The results from the study suggested: (a) people in Dalian enjoy the highest level of physical fitness out of four cities; (b) the changes of fitness status over age show different patterns in four cities: while in Dalian, Shanghai, Xi’an, the fitness level decreases first and then increases over age; in Beijing, it exhibits a monotonic decrease with age; (c) the rankings of fitness levels of each gender in four cities differ: for male citizens, Dalian ranks the top, followed by Shanghai, Beijing, and Xi’an; for female citizens, Shanghai ranks the first, followed by Dalian, Xi’an and Beijing. (d) the average fitness index of Chinese citizens is relatively low in comparison with that of people from developed countries like the United States.\n\nConclusions: Physical fitness plays an important role in ensuring the life quality and work efficiency. The physical fitness level differences in above four cities can be caused by geographical environment, climate conditions and living habits. The low average fitness index is a cause for concern. More efforts are needed to improve Chinese citizens’ self-perception on their physical fitness. Future interventions need to be developed with emphases on nutrition, and community resources for physical activity.\n\nEffect of AVG on Youth’s Physical Activity, Fitness, and Motivation\n\nNora Constantino, Karla Rodriguez, and You Fu, University of Nevada–Reno; and Ryan Burns, University of Utah–Salt Lake City (nlc@unr.edu)\n\nBackground/Purpose: There is evidence suggesting that Active Video Gaming (AVG) has the potential to improve health in children and adolescents. However, the use of AVG in school settings outside of physical education has not been extensively examined and the utility of AVG would significantly increase if it can be established that health-related fitness and physical activity can improve via its use within a classroom curriculum. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to explore the effect of an AVG classroom curriculum on health-related fitness, school day step counts, and motivation in sixth graders.\n\nMethod: A convenience sample of 65 sixth-grade students (Mage = 11.6 0.5 years; 36 girls, 30 boys) were recruited from two classrooms from a “Nevada Zoom” school located in the Western United States. Approximately 55 students were of Hispanic ethnicity (84.6%). One classroom served as the comparison group (n = 32) that participated in active free play, and one classroom served as the intervention group (n = 33) that participated in an AVG curriculum for 30 min per day, 3 days per week, for 18-weeks. Health-related fitness was assessed, consisting of BMI and PACER laps. School day pedometer step counts were recorded using Yamax DigiWalker CW600 pedometers, and motivational variables (Perceived Competence, enjoyment, self-efficacy, social support, task value, situational motivation, and outcome expectancy) were collected using established questionnaires. Measures were collected at baseline and at the 18-week posttest time-point. General linear mixed effects models were employed to test for a group x time interaction on each outcome measure, adjusting for student-level clustering and controlling for student ethnicity.\n\nAnalysis/Results: Girls had a higher BMI (Mean difference = 2.1 kg/m2, p = .001) compared to boys. Boys recorded a higher number of PACER laps (Mean difference = 7.2 laps, p = .007), a higher average school day step count (Mean difference = 823.8 steps, p = .001), and reported higher situational motivation scores (Mean difference = 0.60, p = .030) compared to girls. The general linear mixed effects model yielded that there were statistically significant group × time interactions for BMI (b = −0.44 kg/m2, 95% C.I. [–0.86—−0.03], p = .035), PACER laps (b = 20.7 laps, 95% C.I. [14.6–26.8], p < .001), and average school day step counts (b = 660.0 steps, 95% C.I. [52.8–1267.3], p = .033), suggesting greater relative improvements in these variables from pretest to posttest time-points in students within the AVG group (p < .05). No group x time interactions were found on any of the motivational variables.\n\nConclusions: An 18-week AVG classroom curriculum improved health-related fitness and school day physical activity in sixth grade students. These results showed the positive impact of AVG outside of physical education settings on the specific health outcomes in sixth graders. The use of AVG during class time can be effectively used to attenuate physical activity decreases and ultimately improve the health of youth.\n\nRecess Physical Activity: Associations Between Behavior, Executive Function, and Temperament\n\nGabriella M. McLoughlin, Caitlyn G. Edwards, Alicia R. Covello, Anne M. Walk, Amelia Mays WoodsF, Kim C. GraberF, and Naiman A. Khan, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (gmcloug2@illinois.edu)\n\nBackground/Purpose: Engaging in regular physical activity (PA) reduces risks for childhood obesity, fatty liver disease, and type II diabetes in children. Furthermore, recent evidence from randomized controlled trials reveals improved academic achievement and executive functioning in children who meet their daily PA recommendations. Schools have been cited as an optimal environment for promoting children’s PA behavior; however, little is known regarding PA during unstructured segments of the school day such as recess, and the relationship with executive functioning and temperament. The purpose of this study was to investigate the associations between recess PA, executive functioning, and temperament in elementary-aged children, controlling for individual and environmental factors.\n\nMethod: Children (N = 128) in fourth and fifth grade were recruited from two public elementary schools (school 1: 72% low income, school 2: 52% low income) in the Midwest (79 females, 49 males). Height (m) and weight (Kg) were gathered to calculate body mass index (BMI; kg/m2). Recess PA was measured over five days using ActiGraph wGT3x+ accelerometers worn above the right hip. Executive functioning was assessed using the Comprehensive Trail Making Test (CTMT). Participants completed five trails, each of which were timed and scored based on percentile for age according to their average reaction time. Temperament was assessed using the Early Adolescent Temperament Questionnaire (EATQ), targeting subscales of effortful control (component of executive functioning), affiliativeness (relationships with others), surgency (feelings of pleasure), and negative affect (negative emotions). Each question was ranked using a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (least like me) to 5 (most like me).\n\nAnalysis/Results: Accelerometer data were downloaded and analyzed using ActiLife software and the Evenson et al. (2008) age-adjusted algorithm to categorize activity in to sedentary, light, moderate, vigorous, and moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA). All data were analyzed using SPSS (Version 24; Chicago, IL). Chronbach’s Alpha analyses revealed good internal reliability with all EATQ subscales (a > .6) except surgency (a = .402), which was removed from subsequent analyses. Following descriptive analyses, partial correlations were run to assess relationships between PA, CTMT, and reliable EATQ subscales, controlling for BMI percentile-for-age, recess duration (mins), sex, and grade level. Following correlations, EATQ and CTMT data were entered in to a multiple linear regression model to predict MVPA. Partial correlations revealed significant positive associations between MVPA and CTMT percentile (r = .22 p = .04) and effortful control (r = .35, p = .00). Positive correlations were also observed between CTMT percentile and average step counts during recess. Negative associations were found between time taken to complete CTMT and effortful control (r = –.28 p = .00), affiliativeness (r = –.23, p = .03), and average steps taken during recess (r = –.23, p = .04). Linear regression analyses revealed a positive predictive effect between CTMT percentile and MVPA (Standardized Beta = .27, p = .03); CTMT percentile explained 27.8% of the variance in MVPA.\n\nConclusions: Results provide important information regarding children’s activity behavior, suggesting a predictive influence of executive functioning on PA. Relationships between PA and temperament provide rationale for considering intrapersonal factors in the design and implementation of school-based PA interventions.\n\nSchool Gardens: Improving Children’s Physical Activity and Nutrition\n\nHannah J. Kipfer, West Virginia University–Morgantown (hjkipfer@mix.wvu.edu)\n\nBackground/Purpose: As a nation with consistently high rates of obesity, Americans face an ongoing threat to their health and longevity. The need for prevention and intervention has become critical. Schools serve as prime locations for implementing obesity prevention programming by creating environments in which children eat healthfully and regularly engage in physical activity (PA). School gardens have proven to be a successful intervention tool that contributes to children’s knowledge of healthy lifestyle maintenance. This study aims how school gardens can influence children’s eating and PA behaviors.\n\nMethod: This review discusses the role of the school garden in obesity prevention efforts and explores the related literature including the benefits, impacts, and outcomes for using a school garden to improve children’s daily PA and nutrition.\n\nAnalysis/Results: School gardens are being utilized as a resource for teaching youth about nutrition and healthy lifestyles through fruit and vegetable production. Garden-enhanced nutrition programs in schools that incorporate hands-on garden experience, seem to increase the number of fruits and vegetable children eat on a daily basis, particularly in vegetable consumption and healthy snack choices. Exposure to a garden-enhanced nutrition education curriculum has shown to significantly improved students nutrition knowledge and vegetable preferences and is an effective tool for elementary aged children. When examining the difference between indoor and outdoor lessons, results showed that the children move more and engage in a variety of postures during the garden-based lesson; standing (53% versus10%), walking (14% versus 0%), sitting (15% versus 84%), and kneeling (9% versus 0%). Overall, it was reported that schools with gardens reduce sedentary behaviors and increase moderate PA during the school day. Time spent outdoors is a strong predictor of PA; however, there is a need for research explicitly examining the effects of school gardens on children’s PA, using valid, objective measures. Other significant findings from the study indicated that students’ increased engagement in learning, translated directly to positive changes in classroom behavior. Using school gardens as a place to promote PA and exercise can help fill the gaps when recess or physical education has been reduced or even eliminated.\n\nConclusions: Green schoolyards are diverse in size, content, and purpose but all share the same goals of being a living schoolyard that prioritizes education, health, and the overall quality of student life. These green schoolyards are being used to teach children about gardening, improve nutrition, encourage physical activity, engage the community, and give the entire neighborhood access to nature. These spaces provide a safe place to play and double-down as an outdoor classroom. They enhance, and many times make possible, physical education and nutrition programs.\n\nEcological Roadmap: Key Facilitators to Healthy School Changes\n\nJanelle M. Griffo, Shannon C. Mulhearn, Pamela Hodges KulinnaF, Hyeonho Yu, and Cees Whisonant, Arizona State University (jmweinbe@asu.edu)\n\nBackground/Purpose: Lormann’s (2010) school health ecology model guided this study (e.g., (individual, interpersonal, community, organizational, and policy factors) which aimed to identify important factors leading to school-wide adoption of healthy behaviors. Partnerships with seven schools resulted in individual Comprehensive School Physical Activity Programs (CDC, 2013)/Whole School, Whole Community, Whole Child model (ASCD, 2015) program implementation. School personnel used the elementary or middle school Fitness for Life curricular model (www.Fitnessforlife.org) and were involved in the project for one or two years. The purpose of this study was to analyze stakeholders’ perceptions as their school adopted practices leading to more healthy and active campuses (e.g., physical activity breaks and programming, health knowledge, school lunch changes) with specific attention given to components of the ecological model.\n\nMethod: Most participants (N = 48) were teachers (75.5%), with teacher aides (16.3%); office staff (4.1%); health instructors (2.0%) and tutors (2.0%) also providing their perceptions. Schools’ free and reduced lunch rates ranged from 37% to 78.6%, (higher than State average) in these rural Southwestern communities. Teachers were predominantly female (n = 46), with 1–42 years teaching experience (M = 11.82, SD = 11.7) and reported mostly Caucasian (99%) ethnic backgrounds. Participants were from seven schools (elementary = 3; middle = 3; high = 1). School personnel completed a previously validated ecological model survey with six items for each of the five school health ecology factors using a Likert-like perceptions scale of 1–5 (with 5 as the highest rating, Kulinna, 2016).\n\nAnalysis/Results: Strong internal consistency reliability was found across all survey items (Alpha = .93). Descriptive statistics were performed by item and for the five factors. ANOVA was used to explore differences by teaching level. Overall, stakeholders’ perceptions were positive. School personnel reported all five components of the school health ecological model were almost equally important ranging from organizational factors (M = 3.62, SD = .83; out of 5) to community factors (M = 3.21, SD = .97, out of 5). ANOVA results showed significant differences by school level for community F(2, 46) = 9.96, p < .01, organizational F(2, 46) = 14.31, p < .01 and policy factors F(2, 46) = 12.37, p < .01. Follow-up analyses showed elementary school personnel found all three of these factors as significantly more important than high school personnel.\n\nConclusions: Schools are one important avenue for increasing children’s health knowledge and experiences. To promote positive changes for stakeholders in these school initiatives, the complex ecology of the school must be understood. In particular, understanding factors teachers report as facilitating their willing involvement to this new school mission are critical. Findings provide insights into those facilitators and the role of all factors in the school health ecology model, with school personnel reporting that all ecological factors were quite evenly important. Findings also provide insights into influences of culture and context on school change as these school districts serve rural student populations.\n\nSchool-College Collaboration in CSPAP Project: Facilitators, Inhibitors, and Benefits\n\nTan Leng Goh, Central Connecticut State University–Enfield; and Michelle Moosbrugger, Springfield College (tanlenggoh@gmail.com)\n\nBackground/Purpose: Comprehensive School Physical Activity Program (CSPAP) was initiated to increase children’s physical activity (PA) in schools through a multi-component approach. School-college partnerships provide an effective and sustainable way to promote PA programs in schools (Webster, Beets, Weaver, Vazou, & Russ, 2015). To broaden our understanding of school-college partnerships, this study examined facilitators, inhibitors and benefits experienced by preservice teachers (PST) and physical education (PE) teachers who implemented CSPAP projects in the schools.\n\nMethod: Fourteen PSTs (6 females; 8 males) majoring in PE from a college in a Northeastern city designed, proposed and implemented a CSPAP project (i.e., classroom and recess activities) as part of their elementary methods course in four elementary schools in a local urban school district. Four groups of three or four PSTs implemented the CSPAP project at each school. Prior to the CSPAP project, the PSTs taught PE supervised by the course instructor and PE teachers at the four schools over the course of a semester. Upon conclusion of the project, the PSTs participated in a focus group discussion with their implementation group. Each CSPAP project collaborating PE teacher participated in an individual semi-structured interview. Each 30–60-min focus group discussion and interview was audio taped and transcribed verbatim. Data were analyzed for emergent themes and peer debriefing was used to establish trustworthiness.\n\nAnalysis/Results: None of the PSTs indicated that they had knowledge of CSPAP prior to the project implementation. The major themes were: (a) facilitators, (b) inhibitors, and (c) benefits. Facilitators include support from PE teachers, classroom teachers, principals, and children for project implementation; PSTs’ preparedness for the project and confidence; project was implemented in a relaxed atmosphere being a full-credit group assignment. Inhibitors include time such as short amount of time provided to implement project in schools, project implementation coincided with the school testing period, and difficulty in aligning course schedule with school schedule; logistical support such as technology failure and space constraints in the classrooms; organization of the project such as lack of knowledge of children’s skill levels prior to project implementation. Benefits experienced by PSTs include thinking “outside the box”, learning new ideas in different situations (i.e., classroom settings), and gaining hands-on experience implementing project reinforce willingness to implement in the future. The children benefited from learning and reinforcing concepts learned previously, more engagement with a smaller teacher: student ratio, and children becoming more aware of colleges. The PE teachers reported learning new ideas from the PSTs that can further advocate for PA promotion in the schools.\n\nConclusions: Children, teachers, and PSTs benefitted differently from participating in the CSPAP project. Incorporating a CSPAP topic within an elementary methods course through hands-on project implementation reinforced PSTs’ confidence and knowledge in future implementation. Future considerations include improved communication between schools and the college to provide more information (i.e., children’s levels and abilities) prior to project design and implementation. Considering the benefits of this project, it is recommended that colleges should continue to collaborate with schools for future implementation of CSPAP projects.\n\nRelationships Between Ajzen’s TPB Determinants and College Students’ Physical Activity\n\nAmy D. Linder, Andrea Woodson-Smith, and Jinhong Jung, North Carolina Central University–Durham (alinder@nccu.edu)\n\nBackground/Purpose: A majority of college students do not partake in the recommended amount of exercise according to the American College Health Association (2013). Both the obesity and overweight rates with college students were reported as 29% in 2000 and 33.7% in 2013 (ACHA, 2013). Given that physical activity behaviors developed in college can potentially influence a person’s lifestyle during and after college (Bhochhbihoya et al., 2014), it is important to examine what promotes physical activities among college students. This quantitative, correlational study aimed to determine whether Ajzen’s Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) model determinants can predict college students’ engagement in physical activity. A hypothesis tested in this study is there will be a relationship between Ajzen’s TPB model’s determinants and physical activity among college students.\n\nMethod: Participants were 100 college students who enrolled in lifetime fitness courses at two different universities in a Southern State. The sample size of 100 was determined by G power analysis with the power setting of .80, a medium effect size, and alpha of .05. The participants completed an online survey via Surveymonkey.com. The survey consists of two parts: The first part includes questions about five determinants from Ajzen’s TPB model (i.e., intention, attitude, subjective norm, descriptive norm, and perceived behavior control) to assess participants’ intention and behavior toward physical activity. The second part includes questions from Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire to measure how often each individual engaged in physical activity during a seven-day period. Each participant’s total weekly physical activity was calculated by adding the Moderate Intense (MI) and Vigorous Intense (VI) physical activities, which were designated by cut points. Next, each unit of the MI and VI activities was multiplied by their metabolic equivalent value, i.e., nine points for VI and five points for MI exercise (Fanning et al., 2016). Then, all of the values were added to obtain a weekly physical activity score of the individual.\n\nAnalysis/Results: Data were analyzed using partial correlations to examine whether a relationship exists between a dependent variable (physical activity) and the independent variables (five TPB model determinants). The results indicate the intention determinant had a significant impact on whether the college students engaged in physical activity. Ergo, the stepwise regression analysis showed the intention determinant scale score was one of the primary predictors of physical activity when compared to the other TPB model determinants. The attitude and perceived behavior control determinants show a strong relationship with physical activity engagement scores. Also, the descriptive norm determinant has a moderate correlation with the college student’s decision on whether or not to engage in physical activity, while the subjective norm determinant has no correlation.\n\nConclusions: This study revealed the intention and attitude determinants had the largest impact on the college students’ participation in exercise. The higher an individual’s attitude and intention toward exercise was, the higher the chance the person would participate in physical activity. Future studies should examine whether the determinants have substantial influence on physical activity of college students in other regions of the US with high obesity rates.\n\nA Systematic Review of Factors of Movement Integration and Service-Learning\n\nRobert D. Michael, Longwood University–Farmville; Collin A. WebsterF, Lynda Nilges, Ali S. Brian, and Robert L. Johnson, University of South Carolina–Columbia; Catherine A. Egan, University of Idaho–Moscow; and Russell CarsonF, University of Northern Colorado–Greeley (michaelrd@longwood.edu)\n\nBackground/Purpose: Research on using service-learning with movement integration is limited. A systematic review was conducted to identify facilitators and barriers to (a) using movement integration (MI) in elementary school classrooms and (b) using university-based service-learning (SL) in elementary school classrooms.\n\nMethod: Online databases (Educational Resources Information Center, Google Scholar, PsycINFO, and PubMed) served as data sources for the study. Following the PRISMA guidelines, relevant published research on MI and SL, respectively, was identified using two separate searches and screened for inclusion in qualitative syntheses.\n\nAnalysis/Results: Content analyses of the included articles (31 for MI and 5 for SL) were used to identify 26 facilitators and 15 barriers associated with MI and 22 facilitators and 24 barriers associated with SL. Facilitators and barriers for each area of focus (MI and SL) were then categorized based on conceptual consistencies and commonalities. The categories for MI include institutional and teacher-related. The categories for SL included interpersonal and intrapersonal factors, organizational demands, and university-related support.\n\nConclusions: This review can inform research and practice aimed at harnessing university-based SL as a key partnership approach to support CTs’ (CT) use of MI.\n\nThe Path Selection of Chinese Preschool Children’s Sport Development\n\nXiaojuan Tao and Xiaozang Wang, East China NormalUniversity–Shanghai, China (taoxiaojuan201012@126.com)\n\nBackground/Purpose: Preschool children are the future of a country, and their health level are the basic premise of if the future young people could obtain positive and healthy living. “sport” plays an important role in their health growth. However, in Asia, especially in China, where young children account for 20% of the country’s total population, “Preschool children” seem to have been neglected for a long time in the past.This study aims at finding the path of Chinese preschool children’s sports based on the strategy of “Healthy China 2030” to provide practical inspiration and the Chinese model for the common development of the world’s preschool children.\n\nMethod: (a) Literature: Search CNKI and ECNU Library and other scholar nets to get the documents about 30 articles in study; (b) Logic analysis: Analysis the development path of preschool sport in logical reasoning.(c) Interdisciplinary study: Integrate of Sports Science, Medicine and Preschool education subjects knowledge to do the comprehensive research.\n\nAnalysis/Results: (a) The basic connotation of “Healthy China 2030” and its connection with the kids’ sports: (1) Just as its name implies: program planning is responsible to the people’s health and fulfill commitment of the UN Sustainable Development Agenda 2030. It aims to promote the whole people’s health level (2) This strategy point out that: “By 2030, the main healthy indicators will achieve the level of moderately developed countries.” Based on it, from the perspective of life cycle of human development, the kids are the primary key group should be focused. it gives a powerful policy support and social environment. (b) Current problems exist in Chinese kids’ sports development: Lacking of (1) A comprehensive top design; (2) Appropriate and scientific preschool sport curriculum system; (3) The effective social support environment; (4) High-quality preschool P.E teachers; (5) A scientific and effective assessment and motoring system. (c) The strategic path should be select:（1）Strengthen the national enact good policies for kids and build a scientific and comprehensive top design involve kids’ sports, cognition, consciousness and habits;（2) Design quality courses for Chinese kids and stimulate the formation of the fundamental movement skills during the sensitive periods; (3) Mining community linkage effect, forming a development union integration of home, school and community. (4) Strengthen the fusion of P.E institutors and preschool education major, cultivating high-quality preschool P.E. teacher professional talents; (5) Combine P.E together with Medical Education and promote this subject develop in science and multiple.\n\nConclusions: (a) “Healthy China 2030”is a national development strategy aims to achieve the whole health maintenance and promotion. The implement of it is an crucial chance for Chinese kids sports; (b) Under this strategic background, China needs according to its own situation to joint school, family and even the whole society work together to form the network of integration of production and research, so as to gradually solve the current problems exist in the development and achieve the great rise of Chinese preschool kids’ sport.\n\nProgramming for Successful Aging of Baby Boomers in Church Settings\n\nSteven R. FurneyF, Texas State University–New Braunfels; and Randy Dale, University of Mary Hardin Baylor–Belton (sf02@txstate.edu)\n\nBackground/Purpose: Regular physical activity and proper nutrition can reduce risks for the development of chronic diseases. With age the effects of chronic disease tend to be exacerbated. This qualitative research study examined how the successful aging of senior adults is being encouraged and aided by the recreation ministries of Southern Baptist churches. The main research question of this study was: Based on the knowledge of the benefits of regular physical activity and proper nutrition for senior adults, what is the educational and activity programming response of church recreation ministries.\n\nMethod: This study utilized a bi-furcated research methodology. Utilizing the purposeful selection process, a survey instrument was created, tested for validity and reliability, and mailed to thirty selected Baptist churches in Texas. Those selected for the survey represented churches from all geographic regions in the state and included churches of all sizes. The survey was designed to provide a general snapshot of the current landscape. After compiling and analyzing the survey responses, site visits to three churches were planned and carried out. These three particular churches were selected because of their reputations for recreation ministry, their locations in different regions in the state, and because each church offered at least one program exclusively for senior adults.\n\nAnalysis/Results: Of the 30 surveys mailed out, 29 were returned (96.6%) Fifteen churches reported having a full time staff member dedicated exclusively to the ministry of recreation and sport, eight churches had a staff member who divides recreational responsibility with another area of ministry, and six of the respondents reported having no staff member overseeing a recreation ministry. The smallest church that responded reported an average Sunday school attendance of 110, while the largest reported over 6000. The median was 1203. The percentage of average Sunday School attendance comprised of senior adults ranged from a low of 8.5% to a high of 62%. The median was 31.7%. Twenty-five respondents indicated that their church did have a recreation facility and four responded that they did not.\n\nConclusions: The educational and activity programming for senior adults through recreation ministries were not as robust as would have been expected by the researcher. Those senior adults that did participate usually had a reason or motivation such as trying to lower blood pressure, lose weight, be better able to play with grandchildren, be able to work more around the house, or help with recovery from surgery. In many cases the social aspect of coming together was also a strong motivating factor.\n\nEffect of Recess on Fifth-Grade Students’ Time On-Task\n\nJenny K. Smith and Alicia C. Stapp, University of Mississippi (jksmith2@go.olemiss.edu)\n\nBackground/Purpose: Elementary schools across the United States have experienced an increase in instructional time due to educational mandates, resulting in school days filled with academic instruction. This reallocation of time during the school day to address academic concerns is not fading; if anything, the trend is increasing. As this trend continues, more than 20% of school districts across the United States have reported a reduction in recess time in order to allocate more time for English and math instruction (Brusseau & Hannon, 2015). The elimination of recess leaves students sedentary for a majority of the day, and the effects of such behavior can be detrimental to students’ physical activity levels, social development, and academic achievement (Ramsetter, Murray, & Garner, 2010). Thus, the purpose of this study was to determine the effect of recess on fifth grade students’ on-task behaviors in the classroom.\n\nMethod: This quantitative study was inclusive of twelve fifth grade students who were selected through non-probability purposive sampling. Selection was completed by the researcher, and was based on acquiring diversity among participants in order to accurately represent an average fifth grade classroom. This included students of various socioeconomic backgrounds, racial makeups, and academic achievement levels. Ages of the participants ranged from 10–12 years old. Participants were observed twice a week (Tuesday/Thursday) from September 12, 2016–October 19, 2016. Observations occurred for a 30-min period prior to recess and for a 30-min period following recess. At 5-min intervals throughout each 30-min period, the researcher documented the on-task or off-task behaviors of each participant using a self-created task frequency chart.\n\nAnalysis/Results: Upon final data collection, the number of minutes each participant spent on-task and off-task, both before and after recess was averaged. Overall, the percentage of time that each participant spent on-task on average before recess ranged from 18.7% to 64.5%, with the average amount of time spent on-task before recess among all participants being 36.6%. The average amount of time that all participants spent on-task increased from 36.6% before recess to 70.3% following recess. After recess, the percentage of time that each participant spent on-task ranged from 56.2% to 85.4%. On average, participants’ time on-task increased 33.7% when observed immediately before and immediately after a period of recess. Each individual participant’s increased time on-task ranged from 10.5% to 43.8%, with nine of the twelve participants showing an increase of between 30% to 45% in time on-task following recess.\n\nConclusions: Similar to results of previous research studies (Jarrett et al., 2002; Pellegrini & Bohn, 2005; Ramsetter, Murray, & Garner, 2010), this study supports the theory that following a period of recess, students are able to remain on-task for a longer period of time. Contrary to many arguments used by schools to eliminate recess, the findings of this study indicate that recess positively affects fifth grade students’ time on-task in the classroom. Thus, it is imperative that all elementary schools allocate time for a recess period during the school day to foster both physical, social, and cognitive development.\n\nChanges in Physical Activity and Recess Behaviors in New York City Schools\n\nWendy Siskin, Wellness in the Schools–New York; Kevin Mercier, Adelphi University–Garden City; and Priya Khorana, Teachers College Columbia University–Long Island City (wendy@wellnessintheschools.org)\n\nBackground/Purpose: The CDC and SHAPE America – Society of Health and Physical Educators support the implementation of CSPAPs to aid students in achieving the goal of 60 min per day of physical activity. Wellness in the Schools (WITS) is a non-profit organization which works with 31 NYC schools conducting aspects of CSPAPs within a school setting. The Tisch Center for Food, Education, and Policy of Teachers College, Columbia University conducted an evaluation of the impact of WITS programming on the physical activity and pro-social behaviors of students during recess. The purpose of this study is to report the findings of this evaluation on the impact of WITS.\n\nMethod: A non-randomized, controlled design to measure the impact WITS programming. Fourteen schools, 7 WITS schools and 7 matched Control schools comprised the sample. Each of the matched pairs has similar school demographics, including percent free and reduced lunch eligibility, percent minority, mean ELA and math scores, enrollment, and New York City (NYC) Borough. Physical activity levels and behaviors at recess are being measured through systematic observation by trained observers using SOPLAY and SOPEER respectively. Activity levels, recess time, and organized activities as well as four pro-social behaviors were measured. Data were collected at baseline and after one year of WITS intervention. Extensive process data were also collected through observation and questioning to better understand the context in which recess operated at each school and how school environmental factors may have influenced the study outcomes.\n\nAnalysis/Results: An ANOVA indicated WITS schools and Control schools did not significantly differ in recess play time (WITS = 16.4 mins, Control = 18.4 mins) or lost recess time (WITS = −9.8 mins, Control = −7.5 mins) due to transition or warm-up time. Repeated measures ANOVA indicated girls (WITS = 52%, Control = 45%, p < .05) and boys (WITS = 54%, Control = 54%, p,.05, note significant differences when controlling for baseline differences), were shown to have significantly increased vigorous activity in WITS schools than Control schools. More organized activities and amount of equipment were observed at WITS schools. Regarding pro-social behaviors which were analyzed with an ANOVA, no significant differences were observed between groups for physical sportsmanship or verbal sportsmanship. A decrease in physical conflict was observed for both groups. WITS schools had significantly less verbal conflict during organized activities (WITS = .68, Control = .72, p < .05).\n\nConclusions: Observed increases in students engaging in vigorous physical activity during recess is an important finding from this study. Additionally, it is encouraging that when students are engaged in organized activities that students have lower levels of verbal conflict.The number of tasks presented and the quality of task presentation during physical education have previously been shown to lead to an increase in student learning. Similarly, our findings suggest that having a trained recess coordinator develop organized activities and provide additional equipment during recess contributes to increased activity levels and less inappropriate behaviors. It is important to continue to document how programs, such as WITS, can work with schools to help students achieve higher levels of physical activity and develop the behaviors associated with lifelong physical activity.\n\nExercise Facilitators and Barriers Among African American Young Adults\n\nMaria Kosma1F, Louisiana State University–Baton Rouge; and David R. Buchanan, University of Massachusetts–Amherst (mkosma@lsu.edu)\n\nBackground/Purpose: Although exercise participation has multiple physical and psychological benefits, African American young adults (AAYA)—especially those of lower socioeconomic status (SES)—tend to exhibit lower exercise levels than their Caucasian counterparts. Drawing on the philosophical underpinnings of phronesis (practical reasoning) originated by Aristotle, we studied perceived exercise values in relation to exercise behavior among AAYA of lower education and income levels.\n\nMethod: All 14 AAYA (Mage = 32.07 ± 14.13; females = 8, males = 6) attended courses for the General Educational Development certificate in an inner-city center. Individual interview questions in this qualitative study included typical current exercise behavior (e.g., type, frequency, duration) and the value that the participants placed on regular exercise, including exercise experiences and reasons to be active or not.\n\nAnalysis/Results: The qualitatively derived levels of aerobic activity were as follows: active (exceeded the 150 min/week exercise guidelines; n = 3), insufficiently active (did not meet exercise guidelines; n = 3), and inactive (n = 8). According to the thematic analysis—informed by phronetic research—two themes emerged. The first theme was exercise facilitators: improved fitness and performance, skill development and knowledge (learning proper technique and form), physique improvement (toned muscles), enjoyment and comfort, health, weight loss, and utilitarian purpose (i.e., karate to work for campus security). Exercise barriers was the second theme: lack of time/other priorities (school, work, caretaking), personality (e.g., lack of discipline and motivation), costly to pay for gym membership, injuries and health issues, lack of transportation, minimal (if any) physique changes (e.g., absence of firm body or weight loss), low performance, and safety issues (unsafe neighborhood). All three active participants valued exercise (playing basketball with their friends) because of increased fitness, skill development and knowledge, and performance improvement. Although the rest of the participants were aware of the benefits of exercise, they were inactive or insufficiently active.\n\nConclusions: Based on the study results, exercise considerations for AAYA include: (a) exercise promoters should emphasize improvement of fitness, skills, and performance via play (e.g., basketball) and knowledge of the action (e.g., how to improve technique and why); (b) policy changes for increased safe neighborhoods, free-of-charge and accessible exercise programs—especially among people of lower SES, and assistance with caregiving may enhance exercise opportunities; and (c) although health tends to be the most commonly reported exercise facilitator, it does not seem to be a strong indicator to exercise participation. To summarize, exercise promoters should emphasize playful and meaningful exercises for skill and performance improvements while understating superficial goals, such as weight loss and firm physique, which may hinder exercise participation, especially if not accomplished.\n\nAspects of Depression Among African American Young Adults\n\nMaria Kosma1F, Louisiana State University–Baton Rouge; and David R. Buchanan, University of Massachusetts–Amherst (mkosma@lsu.edu)\n\nBackground/Purpose: Although exercise participation has numerous health benefits, African American young adults (AAYA) of lower socioeconomic status (SES) tend to be less active than their Caucasian counterparts. They also tend to experience increased depression levels linked to their lower income and education levels and high screen use (e.g., increased time with social media and video games). In this phronetic (pragmatic) study, we examined the relations among depression levels, exercise behavior, screen-viewing time, and educational challenges among AAYA of lower education and income levels.\n\nMethod: This was a mixed methods study incorporating quantitative data (depression levels) and qualitatively derived data (exercise behavior, screen viewing, and educational challenges) among 14 AAYA (Mage = 32.07 ± 14.13; females = 8, males = 6). Study participants were interviewed in an inner-city learning center where they attended courses for the General Educational Development (GED) certificate.\n\nAnalysis/Results: The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression continuous Scale was turned into a categorical scale based on its cut-off scores: <13 = no depression (n = 5); 15–21 = mild-to-moderate depression (n = 2); > 21 = severe depression (n = 7). The qualitatively derived levels of aerobic activity were: active (exceeding the 150 min/week exercise guidelines; n = 3), insufficiently active (n = 3), and inactive (n = 8). Time of screen viewing was also qualitatively derived, including limited use (≤ 1 hr/day; n = 4), moderate use (3 hr/day; n = 3), and excessive use (about all day; n = 7). Based on cross tabulation, depression was highly associated with aerobic exercise and screen-viewing time (Cramer’s V = .44 and .42, respectively). Surprisingly, all active people experienced severe depression while the participants of the other two exercise levels were more equally distributed across the different depression levels (e.g., 37.5% of inactive people reported no depression or severe depression, respectively). As expected, people with severe depression tended to be moderate and excessive screen users, whereas 75% of people with limited screen use were not depressed. According to the phronetic thematic analysis, participants exhibited several educational challenges toward their main goal of passing the GED exam for employment opportunities: disliking school and studying, being stressed and lacking confidence with the GED exam, having difficulty with GED subject matters (e.g., Math and English), feeling rejected and isolated, and having no time to study. It is notable that one inactive and non-depressed female participant felt academically competent and instead of playing online she found meaning in life via reading, poetry, and creative activity.\n\nConclusions: Based on the study results, exercise alone may not be enough to tackle depression among AAYA of lower SES. Programs to address depression should be multifaceted in nature, including exercise promotion in relation to limited screen-viewing time and increased value of education and creative activity—not only for employment opportunities, but mainly as a way to lead a meaningful and fulfilling life.\n\nUniversity Freshmen Enrollment in Physical Activity Education Courses\n\nMooSong Kim, Northeastern State University–Tahlequah; and Bradley J. CardinalF, Oregon State University–Corvallis (kimm@nsuok.edu)\n\nBackground/Purpose: The transition from late adolescence to early adulthood is marked by a precipitous decline in physical activity levels. One way that colleges and universities attempt to address this by offering physical activity education (PAE) courses to their students. Some do so through an elective program, whereas others do so through a required program. There are potential short- and long-term advantages and disadvantages to both approaches (Kim & Cardinal, 2016). The aims of this study were to attempt to elucidate this situation by determining entering freshmen university students’ physical activity motivation and competence between institutions with different PAE policies and to examine how motivation and competence were associated with freshmen’ enrollment in PAE courses.\n\nMethod: Participants (N = 261) were recruited from two universities with different PAE policies (i.e., one with a required PAE policy [N = 133] and one with an elective PAE policy [N = 128]). Participants completed questionnaires assessing types of PAE classes in which they enrolled (Barney, Pleban, Wilkinson, & Prusak, 2015), the Behavioral Regulation in Exercise Questionnaire (BREQ-2; Markland & Tobin, 2004), the perceived competence subscale of the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (McAuley, Duncan, & Tammen, 1989), and the Weekly Leisure Time Exercise Questionnaire (WLTEQ; Godin & Shephard, 1985).\n\nAnalysis/Results: One-way MANOVA yielded a significant main effect for PAE policy, F(7, 220) = 3.47, p < .01, η2 = .10. The follow up t-test for the PAE policy main effect revealed significant differences in amotivation, t(225) = 2.47, p < .05, introjected regulation, t(225) = 3.72, p < .001, identified regulation, t (225) = 2.87, p < .01, and competence, t (225) = 2.02, p < .05. In addition, the top three types of PAE courses enrolled in overall were: (a) fitness (31%), (b) mind body (26.8%), and (c) team sports (18.8%). Logistic regression analyses significantly predicted freshmen’ enrollment in: (a) team sports [i.e., amotivation (OR = 0.42, 95% CI = 0.18–0.97, p < .05), identified regulation (OR = 0.37, 95% CI = 0.18–0.79, p < .01), competence (OR = 1.93, 95% CI = 1.05–3.56, p < .05), and PE policy (i.e., a required PAE policy, OR = 4.88, 95% CI = 2.08–11.45, p < .001)]; (b) mind body courses [i.e., amotivation (OR = 2.00, 95% CI = 1.21–3.30, p < .01), competence (OR = 0.49, 95% CI = 0.32–0.74, p < .01), and gender (i.e., females, OR = 6.78, 95% CI = 2.12–21.67, p < .01)]; and (c) fitness courses [i.e., WLTEQ (OR = 1.01, 95% CI = 1.00–1.08, p < .05)].\n\nConclusions: Freshmen with lower self-determined forms of motivation (e.g., higher amotivation and lower identified regulation) were more likely to be enrolled in PAE courses at the institution with the required policy in comparison to the one with the elective policy. Furthermore, different types of motivation, competence, and PAE policies were associated with freshmen’ enrolling in PAE courses. These finding highlight the importance of multifaceted considerations (i.e., context, personal factor, and instructional approaches) when designing and delivering PAE classes under different policy arrangements.\n\nUnderstanding Physical Activity Awareness Among College Students\n\nRulan Shangguan, Xiaofen Deng KeatingF, Xiaolu Liu, and Jingwen Liu, University of Texas at Austin (rulan@utexas.edu)\n\nBackground/Purpose: Many lifestyle changes take place during college years that could greatly affect physical activity (PA) behaviors. College as a transitional period from adolescents to young adults, is the last educational stage for students to learn and establish healthy behaviors that may last for a lifetime. Unfortunately, previous studies on this topic reported insufficient behavioral changes in PA and inconsistent findings, which warrants more understanding of PA behavioral change among this unique population. Awareness emerged as a critical factor to initialize behavioral changes. To date, however, little is known about PA awareness, inhibiting our endeavor to promoting PA on campus. According to the self-awareness theory, an individual usually compares the self against standards to recognize the discrepancies to increase the tendency of a behavioral change, which may also be triggered by the environment. Based on this theory, the study aimed to explore how college students’ PA experiences and how they become aware of their own PA.\n\nMethod: A phenomenological approach using focus group interviews were employed to collectively gather information on students’ conception and experiences as they become aware of their PA within the unique campus environment. Five undergraduate classes with about seventeen students enrolled in each class participated. Two researchers were granted a visit to each class for 40 min. All interviews were audio recorded and transcribed into text for further analysis and interpretation.\n\nAnalysis/Results: A constant comparative analysis was employed with a structure of awareness as the analytic framework. All data were coded to identify emerging themes and group data were used as the unit of analysis, with argumentative interactions to ensure the validity, variety and richness of the data. Triangulation was used to ensure trustworthiness. Three major themes emerged to interpret college students’ PA awareness: personal concerns were the internal aspects (i.e. health status) while social interactions (i.e. peers and family members) and the environments (i.e. university resources and facilities) were the external aspects. Surprisingly, students rarely knew about the recommended PA standards for accruing health benefits (i.e. the PA guidelines), which was an important aspect of self-awareness.\n\nConclusions: Our study was the first attempt to qualitatively understand the critical elements of college student PA awareness, contributing to a more comprehensive understanding on college student PA awareness. The data from our study revealed that PA awareness consists of both internal and external components. By recognizing these critical elements in PA awareness, the results of our study could help college students explore their own strategies for achieving PA goals to maintain sound health. Moreover, the three essential components of PA awareness in college students would help us better design PA intervention programs to meet the unique educational, social, and cultural needs of students in the college setting. More importantly, the themes could be used to guide the development of psychometric scales to quantitatively assess PA awareness in college students. Administrators and policy makers could focus on these elements to develop effective strategies to foster a PA-supportive culture among college students.\n\nTrajectory Changes of Physical Activity and Weight Status in Children\n\nZan GaoF, University of Minnesota–Minneapolis; Jung Eun Lee, University of Minnesota–Duluth; David StoddenF, University of South Carolina–Columbia; Ping XiangF, Texas A&M University; and Peng Zhang, East Stroudsburg University (gaoz@umn.edu)\n\nBackground/Purpose: Despite increasing research attention over the past decade to the tracking of health behaviors, little is known regarding the trajectory changes of objectively assessed physical activity (PA), energy expenditure (EE) and weight status (BMI) from childhood to early adolescence. Therefore, this study was designed to help fill the knowledge gap in this area of inquiry. Specifically, the purpose of this project is to examine trends of children’s PA, EE and BMI over the course of three years.\n\nMethod: Participants were 260 second and third grade children (134 girls; Meanage = 7.81; 73% White) recruited from two Texas Title I elementary schools. Children’s 5-day PA and EE (8:00am-10:00pm) were assessed in fall of 2012 and spring of 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively. Their BMI was calculated by measured height in meter divided by weight in kilogram squared. The outcome variables were kilocalories per day (KPD), time in moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) determined by ActiGraph accelerometers, and children’s BMI percentile. To analyze the change in the outcomes over time, a latent growth curve model (LGCM) was adopted. AMOS version 23 and SPSS version 23 were used to conduct these analyses. Data from the four time points were used to construct a normative growth trajectory for MVPA. Similarly, two more models for EE and BMI percentile were constructed.\n\nAnalysis/Results: The three models (PA, EE, and BMI percentile) fit the data well. Overall, as children aged, a decrease in MVPA occurred (mean intercept = 44.17, p < .01; mean slope = −6.39, p < .01), indicating relative intra-individual variability in MVPA over time. Similarly, a decrease in EE was also observed (mean intercept = 286.47, p < .01; mean slope = −19.57, p < .01). Moreover, the covariate estimate between the intercept and slope factors (covariance of slope and intercept = 2333) proved signiﬁcant (p < .01), meaning children with higher initial EE had steeper decreases in EE over time. Interestingly, children’s BMI percentile decreased over time (mean intercept = 67, p < .01; mean slope = −1.5, p < .05), revealing a positive message for this population. Yet, the covariate estimate between the intercept and slope factors was not significant.\n\nConclusions: Over the study’s 3-year duration, MVPA declined from childhood to early adolescence. This finding is in accordance with many previous studies indicating a decline in MVPA in childhood. Also, trends of EE demonstrated similar change patterns over the course of the study.
