The Toronto story is told as one and is placed for convenience at the end of [383] the middle period (1900). Two groups growing concurrently after 1882 (up to which date they were nominally one) established the following places of worship:\n\nOne group, at Shuter St., Yonge St. halls, Alice St., Louisa St., Elm St., East Toronto, Bathurst St., Fern Avenue, Strathmore Blvd., and lastly at Bayview and London.\n\nThe other group at Richmond St., Pembroke St., Occident Hall, Queen St., Denison Avenue, Cecil St., Wychwood, St. Clarens Avenue, Hillcrest (Bathurst St. at Vaughan Road.) See \"The Disciple Cause in Toronto.\"\n\nPioneer Periods: Aldborough, Esquesing, Lobo, Clinton Tp.

Hillsburgh, N. Livingstone, Weston, Windsor, Windmill Point, Frederick House.\n\nAldborough Township, and Eagle, Elgin County, Ontario\n\nFor more than sixty years the word \"Aldborough\" has had significance to Ontario Disciples, of the informed variety. The name has for long been obscured or merged in two succeeding churches-West Lorne and Rodney. It is situated in Elgin county, which lies on L. Erie, and at a distance from Windsor of eighty miles. It is part of the \"Talbot Settlement\" known to history. There is probably no 'earlier' agricultural climate in Ontario than in that county. It was there, amidst the wilderness of a practically unbroken [384] bush, that sporadic re-turning to God was experienced by the lonesome Scotch settlers, who brought with them memories of ministrations of the Word in a distant land. It was this community that had attracted James Black, when he left his native Argyleshire in 1820, owing to exclusion from the teaching profession because of non-conformity with a creedal confession of faith not found Scriptural by him. So simple and vital a thing as that deflects a man from his natural habitat and sends him forth, a pioneer and a challenge to the faith of other men. Black arrived in Aldborough in October, 1820, and found a small community of Scottish People in a state of religious association, if not organization. The group included the families called McKillop, Ferguson, McKellar, and Robertson. A Scotch Baptist preacher named Donald McVicar ministered to them. The worshippers met in homes and barns for preaching, those of Duncan McKillop and Colin Ferguson being used. Our early historian, Jos. Ash, (who later resided in this county), has this to say about this early Disciple group: \"The church in Aldborough had an existence as far back as (1818). They met on Talbot St., near New Glasgow. In 1820 elder Black began to labor with them for a good deal, whilst teaching school nearby. The principle men there were Donald McVicar and John McKellar McVicar was their speaker for some years. In 1818, George Munro, Robertson, Duncan McKillop, and the Fergusons, and other came.\" (Christian Worker, Meaford, July, 1884).\n\nThe coming of Scottish settlers with reform ideas as in the year 1818, is further confirmed by David Oliphant, in the Living Laborer (in 1880), where he states that the grandfather of elder D. B. McKellar came with his family in that year. Ash goes on to say, that at the date of his writing (1884) all save Arch. and George Munro had passed away. \"The principal men in this church now are the Munros, McKillops, Fergusons, Purcells, Johnstons.\" The last sentence refers to Rodney, which at that date had been established from the Aldborough or (later) Eagle foundation. Thus we have here three men of formative character, who influenced beginnings in this district. It is not necessary to see in the teachings of James Black the completeness that afterwards characterized them, after they had been affected and re-formed by the influence of the Campbells, then unheard of by any of the group. In the early period of dominant Scotch Baptist influence and doctrine, the Aldborough group had fellowshipped with a similar one in the township of Lobo (nearby) and Mosa, both in Middlesex [385] County where, after the year 1831, Dugald Sinclair became 'ruling elder' in Lobo, and D. B. McKellar, the chief speaker and elder in Mosa. They visited each other, coming and going on horseback, holding meetings, and building up the faith and membership of these original pioneer churches. And here the writer avails himself of an opportunity to explain something long sought, as to James Black's work in Aldborough. It is from the pen of one who was but seven years junior to Black--George Munro, referred to in a previous sentence, and known as \"Squire Munro.\" It is in a letter of some length addressed to Law and Whitelaw, publishers of the Christian Worker, and dated Aldborough, 14 February, 1883. Parts only are quoted. \"With Brother Black I have been intimately acquainted since he came to Aldborough more than sixty years ago. Soon after his coming into the new and infant settlement he was (by my father and a few neighbors in reach) engaged to teach school, which he did for two or three years, with the greatest satisfaction to his employers and lasting benefit to his pupils (one of whom I was) being, six or seven years younger than my never-to-be-forgotten tutor. At that time his intellectual powers were keen and far above common . . . At the time he arrived there were in the community ten or eleven individuals (including my parents) who had been Baptist in Scotland, (whose creed was the Bible and the Bible alone) and they joined as a church in weekly communion, having Brother Black as the elder. At the time there were sixty or seventy families in the township, the great majority of them adherents of the Church of Scotland,\"--but some otherwise--\"and having no minister of their own, attended Bro. Black's meetings, highly esteeming him for his Christian character and amiable deportment.\" The writer of this letter goes on to state that Brother Black was not without opposition, after the experience of all reformers. What was opposed to his Scriptural plan was the Calvinistic teaching that salvation alone depended upon unconditioned selection for that heritage through the direct operation of the Holy Spirit. It took no account of an authoritative and revealed religion--the gospel of Jesus--by obedience to which a penitent and believing soul might find acceptance with the Maker of all souls: Black himself had once wrestled long with this belief. It was its manifest unfairness to the individual that stimulated him to search for a true interpretation of the message of the Bible. And to that interpretation he dedicated his life. A sermon or two he preached effectually disposed of the opposition, and [386] some five or six persons were introduced into the kingdom by obedience to Scriptural truth. The writer of the letter concludes a beautiful testimony to this remarkable pioneer of truth, one of which follows:\n\n\"I can never tire to think or speak of Bro. Black--one whom I shall never forget while memory lasts. Deep and sincere was the mourning in the little church in Aldborough when he removed to Eramosa (in 1825). He is (1883) the only survivor of that church in which his name was a household word.\" James Black also left in Aldborough another record, told in the words of the late John A. McKillop, in a memorial history of West Lorne church, May 2, 1937. \"Shortly after, James Black came out and took up a homestead on the Talbot road West, or what is now the Kelly farm. He moved (to the eastward) in 1825 and preached to the Disciples\" (and the public) \"in Wellington\" (and Halton) district. His name is perpetuated in the township (Aldborough) by 'Black's Lane', the name of the first cross road in the township west of Furnival road.\" (John A. McKillop, known and beloved by all in the writer's generation, was a lifelong collector of Disciple literature, and has contributed several of the facts in the foregoing.)\n\nRecords of the old pioneer churches, if any indeed existed in most cases, are very difficult to come at. (This chronicler, however, has reason to be grateful for many which in their detail seem to be providential. Formal records really matter little: but if we can secure the spiritual outlook of the forbearers, and something of their living background, we have the essentials of history.) Whatever our forbearers were, it is plain that their descendants manifest much the same traits. The old Aldborough church lives today in some bearing the same names--and some others who cannot be named. The elusive, but immanent thing in their past is the persistence in seeking the favor of the Almighty, and of exhibiting that trust in daily life. Thus the religious light set forth in Aldborough is still an illumination, though the group there has been dissipated throughout a larger area. Two, or likely three, churches grew from the first in Aldborough--West Lorne, Rodney, and another, called \"The Plains\", which is said for long to have been in a preaching circuit that took in all three.\n\nThrough the instrumentality of Duncan C. McKillop and others, a church building was erected on Main St. Eagle village, in the 'sixties' (likely 1865-6), where it stands today, though used for worship by the [387] United Church. The charter members were thirteen, eight men, five women (an unusual ratio in membership): Arch. McKillop, Sr., John Ferguson, Sr., Duncan McKillop, Sr., Dugald McPherson, Daniel M. Ash, John A. McKillop, William Stewart, Robert Currie, Sr., Margaret McPherson, Christina Ainsworth, Bella McKillop, Isabel Fuller, Mrs. D. M. Ash (of these only Mrs. Ainsworth survive in 1942). The earliest speakers that can be named are: Donald McVicar, Dugald Sinclair, and D. B. McKellar (later preaching in Mosa): then, somewhat in order, David Oliphant, (then of London), Archie Sinclair, Colin Sinclair, W. D. Campbell, as a young man, served well for several years. Percival Baker was, an able young preacher there, from 1887-90. The first regular minister was T. L. Fowler, in 1881, after graduation from Bethany College. Jos. Ash also served Eagle and Rodney, living at Rodney. S. Keffer was another. Students from Sinclair College, 1896-1900, frequently preached; and the early Wellington county preachers (Black, Anderson, Kilgour, and Sheppard) were heard proclaiming the new gospel in all the western churches whilst on their horseback tours, which ran from Howard township in the west to Prince Edward county in the east.\n\nThus the church in Aldborough becomes by origin and history one of the mother churches of Ontario. From its side went forth daughter churches helping to sustain the truth in various localities. Being a Scotch Baptist church it makes the fifth in Canada to be identified as a forerunner of the Disciples of Christ. It is not known whether this congregation was represented in the joint meeting at S. Dorchester in August, 1850, when an agreement was come to between Dorchester and Lobo (leaders Dugald Sinclair and Edmund Sheppard) to call the brethren by the name of \"Disciples of Christ\". But as these leaders were thereafter known to adopt and use the new name, it is likely that Aldborough did also. Joseph Ash, in his Reminiscences states that the groups \"all moved together\" in the matter of name (see Lobo church history).\n\nThe Aldborough group, along with the Disciples in Mosa, Howard, and Lobo, are to be thought of as a western group, in contrast to the Wellington and Niagara groups. This association practically lasted from 1840 to 1875. Correspondence by Black and Sinclair on the \"state of the Church\" was not infrequent, and, examples of the leisurely letter-writing of these bishops of the churches are extant, in the compiler's archives. A history of [388] Eagle church is said by Mrs. John A. McKillop, to exist but has not been found.\n\nThe surviving church at Eagle village was alive to the Christian Endeavor Movement. One was organized in November, 1895, with six active and 25 associate members. By February, 1889, these had grown to be ten active and twenty associates. The group contributed $35 annually to church expenses. Beside McKillop (later of West Lorne) was secretary.\n\nEsquesing Township, Halton County, Ontario\n\nJos. Ash, who first chronicled the churches of the Disciples in Canada (meaning for him, Ontario) wrote \"the church at Norval in the township of Esquesing, was planted in 1820, by the late elder John Menzies, on the principles and after the order of the Scottish Baptists; John Menzies, William Trout, and James Mitchell, being elders (Christian Worker, Meaford, November, 1883). The church's own records declare that the foregoing were \"ordained\", even though later years brought trouble elsewhere where ordaining was attempted. Ash attributes this rise of a new church to John Menzies having, about the year 1836, read certain numbers of the Millennial Harbinger, and that his son, James Menzies (afterwards clerk of the church) said the reading enlightened his father's mind very much, but no one knows when his views were altered.\n\nThe present writer in much later years, secured the loan of the church original and only book of record from a member of the Menzies family, living in Toronto; also the wooden 'offering' box and communion cup. The records are explicit about such matters as membership and of baptism, death, removal, and where removed to, and include the financial records and much other interesting information. The list is too long to print, but it revealed the names of many who helped to make Disciple history elsewhere in the Province, for many migrated to and from Esquesing. The aforesaid elders' constituted a church on 26 February, 1843, in the adjoining township of Toronto, and likely helped the cause to exist in another adjoining township, Chinguacoucy, as well. The Esquesing (Norval) record book was headed \"Church of Christ in Esquesing, instituted in 1820\", which seems to indicate that certain events, occurring before the compilation was begun, led up to the new title, for it was a Scotch Baptist church, not a Church of Christ, or Disciples. (Reason for this follows in a footnote.) Thus, elder John Menzies, actuated by Scriptural and pious motives began [389] to 'gather' a church together. He and his wife, Isabella, placed their names at the top of the roll, with himself as 'pastor'--evidently a Scotch Baptist office. The next entry is for Duncan McKinnon, deacon, in 1824. Mary McKinnon, and Grace Robertson, were added in 1826. James Mitchell, 'pastor' appears in 1835, and also Alexander Anderson who was later to go to Eramosa (after burning his fiddle as a sign of consecration to the Lord's cause) and afterwards became a member of the six \"Ontario Pioneer Preachers. William Trout, 'pastor' was added in 1838, and in 1845 he moved to St. Vincent township, Grey County, where he became a church founder. He himself had been baptized by elder MacLaren, of Erin, before coming to Esquesing. In St. Vincent, William Trout led with others in the founding of a church which became known as Meaford. He was an enterprising and energetic worker in the cause, and was called in special counsel with other churches. Besides this, he evangelized in new districts.\n\nReturning to the Norval story, on 15 November, 1839, James Menzies is called 'deacon'. This chronicler afterwards came to know and love him in Toronto, where he was for years beloved for his leadership in the West End work (Denison Avenue).\n\nFrom Jos. Ash's \"Reminiscences\", it seems clear that the church founded in 1820 and called the \"Church of Christ\" in its records, really was a Scotch Baptist church and came into the light of the Campbellian Reformation through John Menzies having exposed himself to the reading of copies of the Millennial Harbinger, sent by a friend in Ohio. He did not at once avow, his new belief. Associated with him were other elders: first, 'old' brother Stephens, father of W. A. Stephens, who moved to Owen Sound in 1850. Ash further records that elder Jacob Snure, of Jordon, and Z. F. Green, an evangelist from the Niagara and Pr. Edward County districts, visited John Menzies, carrying with them copies of the Christian, a monthly publication published by W. W. Eaton, St. John, N.B. Ash further records that Snure and Green expected a hard struggle with John Menzies, owing to his most extraordinary knowledge of the Bible. He was called the 'living, walking concordance', owing to his remarkable absorption by memory of chapter and verse of Scripture, most of it gained whilst working at his forge. He was said to be able to identify, upon hearing, any Scripture passage read from the Bible. But, he came easily to the new viewpoint, owing to an open mind. Briefly then, the Esquesing church grew peacefully into the principles of the Campbellian reformation, and [390] in June, 1843, the first June meeting of the Ontario Disciples, was held. On that occasion the name \"Disciples of Christ\" or \"Christians\" was used. The site of this meeting house was near Norval, actually on the Menzies farm, lot 8, tenth line, Esquesing. So small was the log building, that at the first June meeting, Ash records that numbers of the listeners had to vacate their seats in order to permit others to hear.\n\nThe church records relate that Wm. Stephens became a member in 1832 and Ash adds in his \"Reminiscences\" that he was baptized in the River Credit on 4 July, 1832, and that he afterwards associated with the church in Toronto. The family of Stephens became an important factor, and W. A. Stephens was a pillar in the Owen Sound church.\n\nThis Esquesing church was characterized by very strict discipline as to its members' conduct. For, with this strong desire to maintain the purity of the witness to the gospel, there was evident the air of exaltation and discovery which are elements in any youthful cause. There was not much experience to fall back upon, and the Bible was truly an honored medium of counsel toward maintaining a high standard of conduct with which to exalt the Christian profession; and who can deny the wholesomeness of such an aim? Consider the delicacy of the recording scribe who could indite upon his records about a sister that had erred and been removed from fellowship--\"for a crime mentioned in I Corinthians.\"\n\nThe writer notes here with interest the only reference he has seen in studies of a church or churches seeking to renounce fellowship with other churches. The affair, whatever it was, has been, kept under cover in the Wellington district, yet Norval records have a copy of a letter by its secretary, James Menzies, dated 11 April, 184 1, and addressed to the church at Eramosa. It is apparent that the church in Erin township had \"excluded from their fellowship both Eramosa and Esquesing churches.\" A desire was expressed that a delegation from both churches should proceed to Erin in order to secure a hearing and prevent a schism likely to \"cause the Way to be evil spoken of.\"\n\nWhen Norval church commended a brother by letter, it was signed by the elders and deacons. To ensure financial support, it was ordained on 27 October, 1841, that in order to meet expenses each brother shall pay into the hands of the treasurer one shilling on the first Lord's day of every quarter; the treasurer to render half-yearly statements, in May and November, on the first Lord's days respectively. On January 1, 1843, the treasury receipts (to give an example) were 4 shillings, 3½ pence, and less on the [391] next two Lord's days. But January 29 brought Is, 7d. The disbursements were largely for port wine, at 6s, 3d per gallon, some of it at 5s, 6d per gallon. On July 4, ten shillings was paid for 100 pounds of flour for \"T.S.\"--evidently for relief. On May 7, 1843, there were on hand of 'bad coppers', 12s, 6 d--reminding one of A. McLean's remarks after surveying the slight gifts of an audience to mark a missionary address: \"I perceive that Alexander the coppersmith has done me much harm.\" On June 23, 1845, is to be noted postage to Alexander Campbell, 1s, 2d.\n\nThis forest sanctuary to Christ which Esquesing folk raised, has long since passed from common knowledge, but the spiritual emanations from that Bible-loving people still grasp at the stars. Norval was the centre where was convened, on 24 February, 1854, a provincial gathering to promote the aim of the American Bible Union, and where a Canadian branch of that body was constituted, with appropriate officers, rules and constitution. Their aim was the raising of money \"to provide and circulate the most faithful versions of the sacred Scriptures in all languages of the world.\" The said version translated the Greek baptizo as \"immerse.\" James Black (as first agent in Canada for the British and Foreign Bible Society) was president, and proposed the following resolution (given in part): \"that we, as (being of) those who know and revere the Word of God, are fully convinced that it is the will of our Heavenly Father, that the revelation He has given in his Word, should be fully and correctly communicated to all nations in their respective languages. Carried.\" Up to April, 1858, a total sum of $1,290 had been sent to the parent Society. This expressed the convictions of Ontario Disciples who at that time felt they were handicapped by the Authorized version of the Scriptures. Norval was a foundation stone for the Disciples in Ontario. Yet missionary aims had been scarcely evoked beyond regional evangelizing; nor did the Esquesing folk have a Sunday School until later--1864.\n\nAbout membership. A report, sent to the Co-operation in 1864, noted that one hundred and twenty-five members at different times belonged to the church; thirteen since last report had died in the faith and twenty-one had made shipwreck of their faith. The February, 1868, report, (Disciples in Ontario held their business meetings in February and their gospelizing meetings in June) states that the membership was then forty; number died since last report two; none expelled, three moved, and seven baptized. The movement to Toronto at that period seems to have been strong. [392]\n\nThe latest date that appears in the records is of a business meeting on July 13, 1873. Ere long the group was to disappear, owing to deaths, removals, and likely aging leadership.1 (As a sort of living identification for all that precedes, the chronicler wishes liberty to record that as a mere child, and on a casual visit with his parents, he saw and heard for the first time in his life the proceedings of a 'church service'; and that many vocal and some mental remembrances of the occasion still linger in memory. That was in Esquesing log church, in or about February, 1866.)\n\nLobo Township, (Poplar Hill), Middlesex County\n\nThis was an indigenous church, the same as Eramosa, Mosa and Aldborough and a few more like it in Canada. It was at first merely an association of Christian believers, not yet organized. They were Scottish people from Argyleshire, and in their native land were members of the Scotch Baptist flock. Nine in all, they migrated to Lobo township in the year 1820. Colin Sinclair, second generation preacher, names them as John McKellar and wife; William Paul and wife; Dugald McColl and wife; John and Alexander Sinclair, and their widowed sister, Mrs. Sarah McCallum. Sinclair also records (Christian Messenger, January 15, 1906) that, \"the Scotch Baptists took the word of God as their only rule of faith and practice, without any human creed or articles of faith.\" From the commencement, of their sojourn in the land of their adoption these faithful Christians made a point of meeting on the first day of the week to break bread in their private dwellings, for the study of God's word, singing, prayer and exhortation. Brethren John and Alexander McKellar usually led these meetings. There was as yet no church organization. They only broke bread when there was an ordained minister present. Donald McVicar, of Aldborough usually visited them every six months. On one of these visits, said to be \"about 1827\", the late John Gray was immersed, being the first to cast in his lot with the little band of men and women. Thus they continued to meet until 1831.\" One can conjecture the warmth of the fellowship created under the conditions prevailing amongst the exiles, amidst the rough hardships of the bush lands through which Talbot Street runs on its western course. Rich as the Bible is, lonesome people hunger for the Word, translated into the medium of human life. There is a tradition [393] still that some of the early Gaelic-speaking folk thought it a better language than English with which to address their Heavenly Father. These good people could actually have no idea of the permanence of the thing they had started; and allowing for the ups and downs of history it is the starters who seem to count. This original group was enlarged as time went on, their names being given later. Their being no church organization there was no name beyond some Scriptural one, so far as there is reliable information. A century after their gathering in 1820, the Lobo \"Christian Church\" met in solemn assembly and honored their names and memories. It was in 1831 that the real leader, Dugald Sinclair, came on the scene. He brought his family and stayed with his namesake John Sinclair, whilst a log house was built for them. The brief memory records state that he \"set the church in order that is, gathered them\" as a Scotch Baptist church. As an ordained minister he assumed leadership, and John McKellar was appointed deacon. Dugald Sinclair though his life \"magnified his office\" as elder, and his practice was to administer the ordinances himself, without help. He is said to have been a stern man, unflinching in his loyalty to what he believed to be truth. In catechising those applying for membership he was strict to the point of refusal at times. On the other hand, there is memory of his courteousness in that he could forbear opposing new ideas held by others whom he could respect. The group as he found them, did not draw his entire approval religiously, but he is said to have admitted that they were nearer right than he; which admission marks a fine deference in the face of his Scotch Baptist faith, which has always been reported as somewhat inflexible. (Mrs. G. W. Graham, who is daughter of Ann McCall Ferguson, and a granddaughter of a charter member, Margaret Sinclair, is responsible for the foregoing statement.) But whatever the small differences the whole group were united in the idea that the Bible alone was a sufficient guide to religion. This belief shuts out creeds, confessions and confusion. The sources of this conviction must have been experiences that were often baffling. There is evidence elsewhere that the way of faith was being slowly re-discovered out of the mists of Calvinism. An example of how the new faith of Dugald Sinclair and of James Black was found, is related in the story of East Eramosa. They became active co-operators, and some letters of Sinclair to Black are extant, illustrating what Paul called \"the care of all the churches.\" At the beginning and for some years there seems to have been a suspension of complete conviction and a searching for the correct viewpoints. For example the name \"Baptists\" was [394] continued for a considerable time, and as Dugald Sinclair travelled as supervising elder to Mosa, Howard and Aldborough township, these groups were called \"Sinclair-Baptists \" and the name \"Disciple-Baptist\" has been heard from one born in the community. This is not hard to understand, since the principles of the Reformers, Christians, and Disciples of Ohio, Kentucky, and the South generally were not clarified until about 1835, after a preliminary agreement, made in 1832, but not lived up to at once. In remote Upper Canada, with slight means of communication, the change to a definite name was not made until later. About the time of the opening of a brick church, (1853), Colin Sinclair (son of Dugald) in his account before referred to, goes on to state that \"Father Sinclair had met with the writings of Alexander Campbell and found himself in full sympathy with the clear scriptural teaching of the latter. He at once saw the propriety of adopting a scriptural name for the followers of Christ. He knew well that denominationalism was one of the leading obstacles to the union of God's children. He asked an expression of the church in regard to taking the name 'Disciple of Christ', the result of which was that that it was unanimously adopted.\" Another testimony on this point is that of Joseph Ash, who in his Reminiscences places the date somewhat broadly as the year 1850. Another testimony from a living person is the boyhood memory of Prof. A. C. Gray (late Eureka College,) that his parents told him the change of name came as the result of a visit of Dugald Sinclair to London on the occasion of the visit of Alexander Campbell to that city in August, 1855. (Millennial Harbinger, confirmed this.) On Sinclair's return to his church he stated to his people his agreement with Campbell's teachings and said that thereafter the name of the church would not be \"Scotch Baptist\" but \"Disciple of Christ\". As action of a similar kind was taken at Dorchester church, through the co-operation of Sinclair and Edmund Sheppard, the reader is referred to that story for further light. There seems no doubt to the writer that any decision of Dugald Sinclair's regarding practice would be decisive.\n\nAdditional particulars of the life of this noted leader in western Ontario, are given in Chapter Ten, Biographies. He continued as pastor until his death on October 18, 1870, aged ninety-three years.\n\nArchie and Colin Sinclair, sons, followed their father into the ministry, but they had no opportunity to do so until after his death, owing to his personal practice. Archie Sinclair soon took over the the direction of the church, during a time of uncertainty, and is credited with being a sort of [395] anchor man. Colin Sinclair also began to serve, and in 1866-67 preached at various points and was provincial evangelist. He served in later years Ridgetown, Collingwood and some other churches; and in 1875-6 was teamed with Hugh McDiarmid in evangelism.\n\nA notable son of Lobo was Dr. W. E. Macklin. He had been reared an Anglican, but came to Lobo to practise medicine, and under the ministry of Archie Sinclair came into Christ. In the Christian Standard he read the appeal of Isaac Errett for a missionary to go to Japan and offered himself, but was sent to China instead, with results widely known and that cannot be re-stated briefly. His little office, and the hotel where he stayed, are to be seen in Poplar Hill--to be regarded with interest by all who see Romance in the life of a devoted Christian missionary. He went out under the presidency of his great friend, A. McLean, and that writer could have found in him a great name to exploit in the annals of the missionary (vide Epoch Makers of Modern Missions, A. McLean). The local treasurer, Eli Barclay (long deceased) was Macklin's oldest friend in Lobo.\n\nThe minister, Murdoch Gunn (an Australian) led the women to mission band work before the organization of the Women's Board. This was on July 12, 1886, and at that date Lobo was one of the very first churches in the province so to organize. Mrs. Belle Barclay, sister of the Sinclair brothers, and Mrs. E. McClurg, were great leaders here; and Grace McClurg Ferguson, long a missionary leader in Saskatchewan, may also be recalled by some. In 1882, a Sunday School was begun, Christian Endeavor in 1891, still meeting weekly, under the minister's care for Bible study. Evangelistic meetings, of great importance were held by W. D. Campbell (a son of the congregation), and W. D. Cunningham, when he was Ontario evangelist in 1895, also by W. J. Hastie, in 1920, with good results. Lobo (Poplar Hill) was the scene of the convention of All-Canada that in 1922, organized that national co-operative work. Altogether, Poplar Hill church seems to have been, and still is, an important one in Canadian Discipledom.\n\nFor thirty-four years this church worshipped without a home, save those of its members; but in December, 1853, a brick meeting house, costing $1,000, was set apart as the first home, to be followed by two others later on. It was a half-mile from Poplar Hill, on the Sarnia gravel road; and a frame house, larger, was afterwards built on the same site and dedicated on Christmas, 1875. The present fine brick structure was built in 1906, within Poplar Hill, and dedicated to God and the use of His people, on [396] July 1 of that year. Dr. J. M. Vanhorn, of Toronto, was speaker. The new church was called \"Christian\".\n\nFollowing is a list of brethren who have served the church as ministers since May, 1886, when Bro. M. Gunn was first employed: J. H. Brennenstuhl; J. C. Wright, 1889; James Lediard, 1888; T. L. Fowler, (two terms); John D. Stephens, J. H. Clark, Benjamin Merry (around 1920), with two terms; Arthur Stott, M. Browning; Cecil Harvey; A. W. Gray; and Howard W. Graham, preacher since before 1942. Among many who might be mentioned, the long service of Mr. Eli Barclay should be recorded; also name of Peter Mitchell, who led in Bible school and young people's work, besides being church secretary for many years. A long list of evangelists and preachers have served the church briefly. They include James Kilgour, Edmund Sheppard, James Black, C. J. Lister, O. G. Hertzog, Benjamin Franklin, T. D. Garvin (prominent American evangelist), Andrew Scott, Bro. Moore, Bro. Elmore, Neil McLeod, Colin Sinclair. Third generation preachers were produced here in the persons of three brothers, Colin C., Jack, and Elmore Sinclair, A. C. Gray, Henry Fonger. All these except Jack Sinclair had preaching careers in the U.S.A. Elmore Sinclair served Union Avenue, St. Louis, Mo. for a year before his lamented death, with fine memories left behind him. Colin C. Sinclair, has been an honored preacher in Western churches. A. C. Gray, after student service in Ontario, graduated from the University of Toronto and became an educator in U.S.A. giving some years to Eureka (Ill.) College. Henry Fonger originated here; received education at Eureka, afterwards went as missionary to the Philippines and later became agent for the American Bible Society. He with his wife and son, suffered a long interment during the war with Japan, where his son died.\n\nBy reverse order, we come to the \"praise of famous men\"--and women--pioneers. Their names are on the church's honor roll, because of the memory of Miss Margaret McCall, who lived past ninety-two years. Her list is dated 1886. Charter members: Mary Muir, wife of Alex. McKellar, Mrs. John McKellar, Mrs. Janet McCall, Dugald McCall, Mrs. Dugald McCall, Nancy Sinclair and her two sons--John Alexander; Mrs. Sarah McCallum, William Paul and wife (Catherine Paul); Donald Sinclair (brother of Dugald Sinclair; John McKellar (early 'Principal speaker'); John Gray (first convert 1827). This leads to the year 1831. After that, the following names are recorded: Dugald Sinclair and his wife Christina (who had been baptized by her pastor, Alex. McLeod, in Scotland in 1820); Miss Catherine [397] Campbell (afterwards Mrs. John Sinclair); Mrs. John Graham, Dugald McEwen: John Dewar, Mrs. Arch. McLean, Mrs. Duncan Sinclair, Nancy Sinclair, Nancy McPhedran, Hugh Brown, Malcolm Gray, Archibald Ferguson, Mrs. Arch. Ferguson, James McKirdy, Mrs. J. M. McKirdy, Mrs. Hugh Brown, Angus McKinnon, Gregor McKinnon, Mrs. Angus McKinnon, Roderick McKinnon, John McKinnon, Mrs. McKinnon, Martin McPherson, Malcolm McKellar, John Gray. (The list is said correctly to total 48 to the end of the early period.) During 1947 the church has had the loss by fire of its early records.\n\nClinton Township, Lake Shore, Beamsville, Lincoln County\n\nIt might be said that the church in Clinton township and 'along the lake shore', was planted almost directly by Alexander Campbell, owing to Baptist preachers in New York State who having read his Christian Baptist, then proceeded to go forth and proclaim the new gospel of Restoration in their localities. Daniel Weirs, was one preacher who first read and acted; he got his assistant, F. W. Straight to read, and he also began 'preaching along the lake shore.' They are credited with baptizing a number in 1830, and with having effected some organization in 1831.2 Lucien Moote, of Rosedene, read a paper at Niagara convention, in 1898, stating the foregoing, and Jos. Ash, in the Christian Worker, August, 1883, also affirmed the same. In addition, and confirmatory of the foregoing, Jos. Ash relates that he was visited by Weirs in the year 1834, coming from Clinton township then, where he was also thought to be interested in the old \"Christian Connexion.\" Weirs wished Ash to co-operate with him in the publication of a journal to aid the \"ancient gospel\". It seems that both Ash and Weirs were at that time interested in seeing what could be done to unite the Christians and the Disciples, as had been accomplished in the States about the years 1830-32. But the reaction by the Whitby Conference of the idea of union, discouraged Weirs and be left Canada. There is no doubt that these almost unknown evangelists were responsible for seed-sowing in the Niagara District, the fruits of which may still be reaped. After the bookish preachers had gone, they were in time succeeded by others, of which [398] Jos. Ash gives the names. He received them, apparently, as late as August, 1883, when he published the account in the Christian Worker. Their names are Marshall Wilcox, Porter Thomas and J. M. Yearnshaw. A church was organized in 183 1, so Ash avers, with some certainty. Its first members were Nathan Gilmore, Geo. Morris, H. G. House, John J. Culp, Erastus Derby, John Boughner, Cornelius Bertrand, Isaiah Bertrand, and their wives. Solomon Culp, N. Gilmore, H. G. House were elders: Erastus Derby, clerk: Bertrand and Boughner, deacons. Of the next few years we have no history and no printed records occur until August, 1843, on page 376 of Millennial Harbinger, edited by Alexander Campbell, appears a record of the various churches in Ontario, their membership and date of organization. This was a report of the first convention of Disciples held in or near Norval, Esquesing Township in June, 1943. The date of 1839 was given as the origin of the Clinton and Louth churches and (apparently) the combined membership was 85. The idea of treating these two churches as one organization may have been that they had been but one organization previously, or one \"gathering\" without complete organization. As a matter of fact we are informed by H. W. Hunsberry, of Jordon Station, that the earliest records of Clinton and Louth churches were combined in one book, entries beginning at the front for Clinton and at the back for Louth, or Jordon. Confirmation of the organization is given in the book, as follows: \"A book of remembrance containing the names of the Christian Disciples who have been brought together by the word of God in the township of Clinton, and also of such acts of the church as may be thought proper by them. The members having assembled together on the first Lord's day in June, being the second day of the said month in the year of our Lord, 1839, when brothers George Morris and Nathan Gillmore were chosen to the office of elder, brothers Cornelius Bertrand and Solomon Culp to the office of deacon, and Bro. Erastus Derby to the office of clerk.\" It is possible to look upon these two records of Clinton and Louth townships as merely an earlier and a later (and final) organization. The formal statement has the ring of truth about it, and it must have been a high moment for a movement that was so powerful in time within the Niagara district. By the same authority as I have quoted, we are informed that the Clinton (or Lake Shore) congregation met in a building on the shore of Lake Ontario at a point about three miles northeast of the village of Beamsville.\n\nBeamsville. Some very considerable time after Lake Shore was established, there was a need for another assembly for worship, and it was [399] located in Beamsville. Probably better roads had something to do with it, or \"going to town\". Both churches existed near together for many years, the latest record of Lake Shore being in the year 1885. The two groups made up the church in Clinton township. The exact time is not known. W. D. Cunningham, missionary evangelist, learned in May, 1900, that it originated \"about 1850\". In the year 1883, Jos. Ash in writing about all the churches (which he knew perhaps better than any) states Beamsville (Clinton) was one of the earliest in Canada; but he avers that the people there were unwilling to accord information; and this has a ring of truth in 1943. Ash goes on to say that the church grew healthfully, that the overseers were faithful and few \"apostatised\". Such carefulness recommends a church. An incident he relates about a meeting held by James Kilgour and Alex. Anderson. When the invitation to come forward was given no less than forty came, to the disturbance of Bro. Kilgour, who imagined the whole audience was coming. Such unanimity has seldom been witnessed; sounds like Acts, second chapter. Big meetings and streets on baptism accounted for ingatherings. H. B. Sherman, whilst local \"evangelist\" in 1885-6, reported forty-three baptisms in the first year. In May, 1900, W. D. Cunningham reports that the elder of the church was Robert Walker, the \"present evangelist\" was Samuel Whitefield. He was from Meaford, attended school in Nashville, Tennessee, and has entered the work in November, 1899. Other leaders reported were Peter Tallman, Paul Merritt and Walter Tinlin. \"I could secure no other particulars of their work,\" remarks W. D. Cunningham. From The Witness of Truth (D. Oliphant) we learn that brethren Kilgour and Anderson visited Lake Shore in 1853, and later Beamsville, but there they used the Baptist house. This indicates something about the date of Beamsville. What is more important than dates at either end of a church's history is (1) the spirit moving the body; (2) what has been accomplished for the Master. Beamsville congregation grew so well that a fine new church property, worth $5,000, was erected, and dedicated in October, 1885, when L. L. Carpenter, of Wabash, Ind. preached to a truly great audience on the Restoration Movement and what it had accomplished. H. B. Sherman declared that the meeting-house was the finest in Canada and that the congregation were well able to pay for it. Beamsville church was the scene of a discussion upon the subject of Christian Baptism, during June, 1887, lasting 12 days. John S. Sweeney, of Paris, Ky., represented the immersionist side and T. L. Wilkinson, of Toronto, the side of sprinklers. Sweeney was a very able [400] man and this was his second debate in Ontario. Wilkinson (Methodist) had also a debate with Hugh McDiarmid. The church's emphasis has been upon baptism, but so also were all the early churches. Up to 1880 none of them were interested in doing anything about missions and to many of them the idea of co-operating through an organization to promote efficient management in evangelism was dangerous. In days as early or as late as 1853, Beamsville, or its fellow-Christians, gave sums like ten pounds a year to general evangelism; but for sixty years Beamsville has been only a memory in organized co-operative work. Like many other churches it had once a serious division, in this case over S. M. Jones, but after a time the breaches were healed. Too great obsession with \"Restoration\" ideas may even prevent normal development of a religious body and prevent it going on to perfection in ways plainly charted by the Book. It is a sad and deterring fact for the brotherhood of Disciples, that Beamsville church has for sixty years lived within a narrow fellowship of ideas and efforts.\n\nEramosa East\n\nThis great church3--one of the few foremost in Canada--began its life in the year 1832. It was described by David Oliphant, Jr. in his journal, Banner of the Faith, in Nov.-Dec., 1859, as \"the first congregation in good part like those we read in the sacred writings in Canada.\" (The reader may note the writer's approximate language: what he meant was that it was partially like a New Testament church.) He knew it well, for it was his home church, as a boy, his father, David Oliphant, being an elder in it. He refers to other leaders in it, namely: \"W. Elliott, Robert Royce, Alex. Anderson, William Oliphant\". The writer has cause to accept his dating of the congregation as 1832 as the most accurate statement as to year that we have. The reader, however, should not fail to read a longer description in Chapter Four entitled Forerunners and Heralds in Ontario. Eramosa township, and its next easterly neighbor, Erin township, are the most southerly and most eastern townships of the great Wellington County, and both are based about on the line of the Canadian National Railway, passing westward from Georgetown to the city of Guelph. East Eramosa church was on the farm of James Black, west half of lot seven, concession seven; and on it he is said with certainty \"to have erected the first meeting-house put up by the Disciples of Christ in western Ontario\".4 [401]\n\nAnother authority in our history is Joseph Ash, (preacher, writer) who in December, 1883, writing in the Christian Worker, of Meaford, says as follows: \"When elder Black went to Eramosa the Scotch Baptists had a church there, and David Oliphant, Alexander Stewart, Thos. Stephens, Donald McLean and others were preaching advanced views before he went there. This was the Eramosa East church, organized in 1831.\"5 Jos. Ash goes on to state \"the circulation of A. Campbell's writings.6 among them opened their understandings greatly; and a visit from the late Jos. Snure, of Jordon, and Z. F. Green, helped to complete the change, and the whole church exchanged the name 'Baptist' for that of 'Disciples of Christ', or 'Christian', with corresponding teaching and action.\"7\n\nFor reason of space the ideas of the Campbells and others are not dealt with here. They have been fully set forth in another publication.8 A few more words are necessary to orient the leading man in East Eramosa church. Some notes appear in Biographies of Spiritual Leaders, and it should be noted that before his coming to Eramosa in 1825 he had been in Elgin Co., Ontario, since his coming to Canada in 1820. While there he was a teacher, preacher and laborer for a Scotch Baptist church in the process of being transformed into a New Testament church. (See Aldborough history for illuminating details.) It is not apparent that James Black was as yet a \"Disciple\"; he is said by Ash to have \"moved slowly\", but when he did change he held lasting convictions.\n\nJos. Ash says he was in advance of the Aldborough group, but there were some differences relative to ordination and Christian baptism. (This is noted as a sample of the ferment going on the minds of countless persons in Canada and elsewhere. The marvel of it is that no traces of dissension in this vital process have ever been noted by this writer. Surely the early church in Ontario is a model today in spirit for churches claiming the same foundation when fully developed.)\n\nThere comes in here the testimony of another Disciple, William H. Trout, son of elder Wm. Trout (See Erin Centre, Esquesing). William H. Trout, of Milwaukee, Wis., in 1916, published The Trout Family History, which contains much first-hand early Disciple history in this province. It is one of a few bits of contemporary writings relative to our pioneers. It [402] is pertinent here because, in a simple direct way, it throws light upon crucial struggles many persons were undergoing, regarding the essential teachings of the Book, with regard to personal salvation and the nature of the Church and its teaching. Wm. H. Trout in his book writes on page 49:\n\n\"Canada had a still more effective acquisition for religious teaching in the person of James Black, who left Scotland early in the second decade of the century, a young man and a Baptist, he settled near the city of Guelph, and taught school, and true to his Christian responsibilities he opened a Sunday School and taught the gospel and its duties from the New Testament. In a year or two he saw there were a number ready for Christian baptism. He wrote back to Scotland to a mission board to send out an ordained minister to preach and baptize. One was promised, but was several years in coming. He did not wait but kept on with his good work, and added preaching to his teaching, till quite a number were ready to take upon themselves the name of Christ and enter His service. His study of the New Testament showed him most plainly that no consistent follower of Christ was debarred from preaching the gospel or administering its ordinances. Accordingly after receiving their confession of faith he baptized the penitents, and formed a Christian church in apostolic fashion, and had it going in good working order when finally the Baptist missionary came and proclaimed James Black's course to be wholly unauthorized, his converts illegally baptized, and that they must now be baptized by himself as a lawfully ordained Baptist minister, in order to become a correct Baptist church. And, from this point of view, the minister was right. But did Bro. Black acquiesce? Hardly. He briefly but courteously told him to keep his holy hands off-or words to that effect. These people were already Christians, and there was not the least need of their becoming Baptists. So, Bro. Black left him to go elsewhere and make his Baptists out of raw material. This was in the early time of Alexander Campbell's work in west Pennsylvania. Bro. Black knew nothing of it then, but began to learn about it shortly afterwards. The marks of his influence were laid deep in the records of the Canadian Church of Christ\".9 [403]\n\nThe possibly casual time reference in the foregoing sentence may have a bearing on what is reflected in the foot-note quoted below. Beyond doubt, James Black had got to the Campbell's position on Christian baptism, \"its antecedents and consequents\", somewhat independently, and likely some time later. What seems likely is that in 1825, he may have brought from Aldborough to Eramosa these views, (though imperfectly developed), for the Scotch Baptist church in Eramosa was teaching and practising part of the same, as was likely the case in Esquesing, Lobo, and a few other points in Canada. It is interesting to record that James Black himself was brought to the adoption of immersion as a young man at Balanoch, Scotland, in 1817--by Dugald Sinclair, of Lobo, who at that time was a Baptist missionary in the Highlands. And what follows is still more interesting: that when Sinclair came to Lobo, in 1841, he was himself introduced to the Campbell position by James Black, whom he had helped to the Baptist position in 1817. It would seem that the spread of the Disciple views in early times was mostly by personal contacts.\n\nIt seems to the writer that one of the most important dates for Disciples to remember is the coming of James Black to Eramosa in 1830 and there settling for life--to teach, preach, and advance the cause of Christ to the utmost of his ability, in a life that was then to extend fifty-six years more. Traditionally, the date (1832) was cherished in Eramosa as that of 'our beginning', although James Black would have rejected with scorn that Disciples first appeared then in Canada.\n\nDuring the year 1825, (on his return from Aldborough in Elgin County, to Eramosa in Wellington County) he began teaching school and evangelizing in the adjoining township of Nassagaweya. There a church was started on the understanding that it would receive all immersed believers, whether Scotch Baptists or English (Association) Baptists, (Christian Worker, December, 1883). Here seems evidence of a liberal advance. It is likely that 'Scotch Baptist' designated the faith of James Black during the period before 1830. Jos. Ash hints at this. He was undergoing the serious problem of developing his lasting convictions which had been Calvinistic until his contacts with the clear and advanced views of the Campbells. This change, he admitted, began about the year 1833. His religious convictions after that never altered. Beyond question, he was the dominant man in the Wellington district, up to the year 1880. He was assisted in his task of ministering to the pioneer group by the leaders referred to by D. Oliphant, in the first paragraph. Of these mentioned, Robert Royce, the younger, [404] probably continued longer than the others as local preacher and elder--the presiding elder, in a sense, since he was always present, whilst other laborers, including James Black, were often away to the lure of fresh conquests of the gospel, in such areas as Erin and Nassagaweya. Robert Royce became a substantial man in the public life of the township, and in the Brotherhood, where he was frequently relied upon to undertake or sponsor anything important in the field of co-operation. He succeeded to the office of secretary-treasurer of the co-operation on 1869. Another early elder was David Oliphant, Sr., referred to by his son in Chapter 5. Lazarus Parkinson was another lay preacher and elder. Next to Black, was Alex. Anderson, as a preacher and evangelist; they frequently travelled together, as did also Black and Kilgour. Anderson came to Esquesing from Scotland in 1852. There he came into Christ and the Reformation. About 1836 he settled in Eramosa and as a farmer and pioneer preacher, made evangelistic trips in company with Black or Kilgour. His consecration to the new life was manifested by his burning his fiddle. An honored and able companion figure in the \"Pioneer Preachers of Ontario\" was James Kilgour, who came from Kirkcaldy, Scotland, in 1845. Thus in Black, Anderson and Kilgour, Eramosa church had three of the six \"Pioneer Preachers of Ontario\"--a title by which they have long been known. Something of these pioneer preachers is told elsewhere. It is known to the writer that absence of a register, until the Everton church took over two early churches, has occasioned the loss of names. Example: the name Whitehead became significant in the eighteen eighties in co-operative work. Moses Whitehead, of Eramosa, was a pioneer member, with his family. His son Thomas left Eramosa early in life and established himself in Dunkeld, Bruce County, where a church soon was begun. He removed to Walkerton and established a business, and along with it a church that was a light for many years. In the 1890's, Thomas Whitehead was prominent in Co-operation and other activities, extending to the Canadian West as well. Much other interesting material regarding the pioneer church must be omitted for lack of space: some of it was given first publicity in the pamphlet referred to in foot-note 1. A full recital of it would be an inspiration to all: there may have been and likely were, other congregations just as intensely loyal to the new found faith, but where in our annals will be found a church so productive and fruitful as old Eramosa? Its Christian vitality still persists, to the compiler's knowledge, a century after its primitive buildings became dust and many of its members had lain for many decades in scattered and unsought graves. [405]\n\nOur first Eramosa church (Wellington Co.) ended its career by uniting with Centre Eramosa church, in 1861. (See Everton.)\n\nEast Lake, Athol Township, P. E. County, Ontario\n\nThe above is one of the earliest churches 'gathered' by Benj. Howard or Z. F. Green about the years 1834-35, according to Jos. Ash in Christian Worker, October, 1883. Prince Edward County was well evangelized by such leaders as Hubbell, Moss*, Williams, S. E. Shepherd*, Hillock*, Anderson, C. J. Lister, James Kilgour, Jas. Black, Geo. Clendenan, Ben. Franklin*, W. T. Horner*, Marshall Stone*. (Those with asterisk (*) are from U.S.A.)\n\nThe early leaders in East Lake, or Cherry Valley as it was called, were J. Platt, James Ketchum, James Thompson, Willson Bentley, A. Palin and Hannibal Thompson. Hannah Thompson, a former Methodist woman, was at first much against the new preaching but having embraced it became an ardent advocate. She was the mother of Hannibal Thompson and Geo. Thompson, later of Wainfleet and a leader there (which see). The first elders were Jacob Platt, Wilson Bentley, and J. Ketchum; later Gilbert Trumpour. An exciting incident is told as occurring at the baptism of a young man in the year 1837. A brother of the young man rushed into the water and tried to prevent the baptism. Another sturdy Englishman, from New York, who was present, also rushed in to assist elder Silas E. Shepherd perform his duty. The opposition ceased and the baptism took place. Other incidents of this sort have occurred without a record in these memoirs. Opposition was intense then.\n\nA man who evangelized greatly in Pr. Edward County was David Oliphant. His service lasted for years. He began a long series of journals, the first called Witness of Truth, published at Picton, and continued publication almost until his death in 1886.\n\nAsh records in 1883 that the church had ceased to exist, and it had gone into the support of a younger church, West Lake.\n\nHillier, Prince Edward County, Ontario\n\nIn 1834, a church organization was effected by elder Benj. Howard, an American evangelist. He secured the aid of evangelist Z. F. Green, of Rochester, N.Y., and nearly the whole neighborhood was converted. Families that united were the Ainsworth, Post, Wannamaker, Doolittle, Burr, Whitney, Spencer, Lambert, Vincent, Hart, Covert, Pyne, Frier, Spafford, Blake. Great interest was manifested in the community. They believed \"that [406] all that was necessary to effect salvation in the days of the apostles was sufficient today\" and baptism by immersion became the practice, according to Scriptures. For 35 years this congregation met in log homes, school houses, barns and groves. Evangelists who served it were J. M. Bartlett, Silas E. Shepherd, of N.Y. State; John Doyle of Nova Scotia; elder Jasper Moss, Dr. Hillock and J. C. Stark, of Ohio; Benjamin Franklin, editor of American Christian Review; W. T. Horner, editor Herald of Truth, of Buffalo, N.Y.; elders J. W. Kemp and L. E. Brown, of Ohio; Joseph Ash, of Oshawa; David Oliphant, of Picton, editor of the Christian Banner; elders James Black and Alex. Anderson, of Eramosa; and George Clendenan, of Toronto. These names read as a roll-call of heroes of those early times. (The term 'elder' was always used to designate a preaching brother.) This church gave Henry M. Ainsworth to the Christian Ministry. He served in Mt. Carmel and various other Ontario fields. He died June 6, 1892, at age of 83. W. K. Burr when a student in Illinois, met Benjamin Howard and secured his assistance. (Burr was later a preacher who served in pulpits widely from the Maritimes to Chicago. He claimed to have baptized hundreds of persons in his ministry, was a prolific writer, a student of Disciple history, his parents having preserved the file of monthly parts of Ontario's first Disciple journal, the Gospel Vindicator, published at Cobourg, Ont., beginning in June, 1837 and running for ten months only.) Burr took the initiative in building a brick church building in 1872, long known as the Disciple church. It was dedicated in June, 1873, by Geo. Clendenan, of Toronto. Clendenan preached three times and a large number of other persons and families were added. Trustees were S. P. Doolittle, Eli Ainsworth, R. F. Ainsworth, W. K. Burr, Robert Welsh. During the church's life, of 78 years, about three hundred persons were members. The church was a co-operative one, supporting the Ontario co-operative plans. In the eighties Ontario rural churches suffered from migrations to the west and towards the cities. It need surprise no one to be told that churches like empires \"go to seed\" and pass out for causes beyond the strength of their holders. Even religious beliefs seem to have their cycles, the same as economic and political theories. But truth nevertheless is preserved. The moral is: be on guard. A cemetery cairn, placed by W. K. Burr's energy, marks the burial of pioneers. Though the church physically has been erased, like the record of many others, its spiritual directions carry on. Some descendents live and worship in Toronto and it may be said that this pioneer church lives on. [407]\n\nIn thoughts sublime that pierce the night like stars,\n\nAnd with their mild persistence urge man's search to vaster issues.\n\nWest Lake, Hallowell township, Prince Edward County\n\nSeveral churches on the eastern fringe of the Disciples' occupation of Ontario, illustrate the value of having a surrounding support. Those to be mentioned, have not that advantage, and they have been less generally known in modern times. Most likely the readers of these chronicles have never heard of churches planted in Pr. Edward County, Ontario, in Hillier, and Athol townships--and called by these names, or by Cherry Valley and East Lake. With West Lake we have been familiar. The biggest factors in their founding were two preachers from New York State, named Benjamin Howard and Z. F. Green.10 From the testimony of Jos. Ash, one of them was a renegade preacher who had been disowned by the Christian Connexion of their State, because of drunkenness and worse faults. And Green was in a similar category. (Christian Worker, Meaford, November, 1882). These men were clever speakers, and, according to Ash (as before stated) \"preached baptism for the remission of sins with great effect, but not its antecedents or consequents.\" Consequently, there was not much foundation for the upbuilding of the converts, through Scriptural facts, commands and promises. Ash relates the battle be waged to discredit men who would so dishonor their calling as preachers. Howard returned to Rochester and brought with him Z. F. Green, who lay under similar disgrace in New York State. Howard eventually left Ontario, but Green worked his way to the Niagara district and preached and baptized there, until excluded from several congregations. The two are credited with establishing the congregation in Hillier township, about the year 1835. Howard was the first preacher and secured the assistance of Green. A congregation was gathered by Howard and Green in Athol Township, (Cherry Valley) about the years 1834-5. Amongst the first converts were J. Platt, James Ketchum, James Thompson, Wilson Bentley, A. Palin, and Hannibal Thompson. One convert was a woman named Hannah Thompson, who had zeal for the Methodist cause and made opposition, but when she learned differently she embraced the gospel and, like Paul, sought to build up what she previously destroyed. (She was the mother of Hannibal Thompson and George [408] Thompson who are referred to in Wainfleet--Winger--chronicles.) The first elders were Jacob Platt, Wilson Bentley, and J. Ketchum and later on, Gilbert Trumpour succeeded. In 1861, the congregation was co-operating with others, and, on January 11, a very cold day, there were immersions. Nevertheless the cause at Cherry Valley finally disappeared and its membership largely went into the formation of West Lake church. Various factors may have caused this change, but the community received frequent preaching from regular Disciple preachers mentioned throughout. In August, 1848, Jos. Ash reports a preaching tour through all the churches in the county. In the records of West Lake church, still extant, the date of its beginning is June, 1863, although D. Oliphant, in his Banner of the Faith informs his readers that the meeting-house was complete enough to use in June, 1862. Records state: \"Meetings began, January, 1863, at West Lake, Disciples who worship here from date, as follows: Jacob Hicks, Mary Hicks, David McDonald, Lydia J. McDonald, Amos McDonald, Almira McDonald, Richard McDonald, Adeline McDonald, Robert McDonald, Sarah McDonald\". The church building was erected by the men, co-operatively. The land was given by Catherine McDonald; and her son, W. H. McDonald, later in life, left a legacy to the church in her memory, amounting to $10,000. A second list of early worshippers contains the following: elders: James A. Platt and Jacob Hicks: deacons: John Hyatt, Gideon B. Mastin, Robert McDonald: members, James M. Hyatt, Amos McDonald, David McDonald, James W. Trumpour, Richard Young, Henry Lambert, James Mastin, James Hyatt, Jr., John McCrimmon, Amos Mastin, Catherine Mastin, Rachael Trumpour, Lydia T. McDonald, Adeline McDonald, Sarah McDonald, Almira McDonald, Catherine McDonald, Harriet Hicks, Harriet Lambert, Mary Hicks, Elizabeth Graham, Almeda Mastin, Eliza Mastin, Rebecca Young, Nancy McCrimmon, Adeline Hyatt, Lydia J. Hyatt. James M. Hyatt was elder of the church for many years. Further additions to June, 1864, record Cynthia M. Oliphant, Laura Ann Oliphant. A long list of baptisms (forty names) follows in October, 1868, amongst whom may be named Cornelia Hyatt and Nathan Hyatt, both well-known to Toronto Disciples, to about 1920. At this point all sources of information have failed and it may be presumed the congregation carried on for years, perhaps in an imperfect way, owing to lack of regular preaching leadership. All through the sixties and later into the seventies, the Wellington county evangelists, made preaching their duty in the County. However long the lapse in church activities continued, it took on new life in the 1880's, [409] possibly owing to the creation of the third Co-operation in 1885, for the spread of the gospel. The Ontario brethren became possessed of a new urge to co-operate so as to establish the cause widely and particularly in centres. In the establishment of a new cause in the West End of Toronto in 1882, George J. Barclay, whilst a part of that group, undertook his first evangelistic meeting at West Lake. (For some years they had been having, mostly in summer, student preaching, in which A. C. Gray served.) Geo. J. Barclay's meeting ran over twelve days and there were eleven baptisms and two 'restored' to the faith. Apparently a renewal of worship and service occurred, because in the records appears the following resolution: \"We whose names appear below acknowledge ourselves as members of a Church of Christ at West Lake and take upon ourselves the appellation of 'Disciples of Christ'. We believe in the all-sufficiency of the sacred Scriptures for everything for the perfection of Christian character, whether in private or the social relations of life, in the church or in the world--Signed by James A. Platt, James M. Hyatt, overseers; Gideon Mastin, deacon.\" J. H. Mundy, a preaching brother from Port Hope, became 'evangelist' of West Lake in 1886, possibly assisting in reconstruction. On Nov. 4, 1886, he was set apart as authorized to solemnize marriage, under the new legislative enactment, specially made by the legislature for Disciples and others (R.S.O. Cap. 124, 1883). Frederick Warden was chairman of the meeting, Bryon Hyatt, secretary.\n\nHere follow the names of some preachers who served the church during periods stated. Benjamin Merry was known for his sheer devotedness to the cause. He was minister from 1907-1913. C. C. Mullins, who was minister from June 1913 to Sept. 1914, states that the membership in 1913 was 72, and that in 1924 it stood at 50. Thos. W. Bradt served a year, and J. M. Bumpus, of Johnson Bible College, two years. C. C. Mullins was again minister from April 1917 to sometime in 1919. Lancelot Zavitz came from the Baptist church, bringing a brief prosperity. C. C. Mullins returned in 1921 and continued until 1936. Thos. Ransom, of Yellow Grass served from April 1937 to August, 1938, and W. R. Macdowell served from October 1938 to January 1940, but was too poorly supported and could not stay. I. E. Cavendish came as minister from Prince Edward Island in May 1940, and closed April, 1942. In March, 1942 the membership stands at 30, with non-resident 15 members.\n\nEvangelistic meetings were a frequent feature. In June, 1912, G. F. Assiter, of Grand Valley, held a successful meeting, in B. Merry's time. [410] In C. C. Mullins' time Jos. Mackenzie, Keele St., Toronto held two very good revival meetings, (1926-7) and another in 1932. C. M. Smithson, of Hammond, Ind., held a meeting in June, 1933, when twenty-seven were baptized. (He was probably the strongest soul-winner of this period. He was beloved and respected.)\n\nWest Lake church in later years never developed fully a co-operative habit. Leadership is always responsible for this. Yet it cannot be said it was anti-missionary, since W. D. Cunningham (a free-lance revolter against the Foreign Christian Missionary Society in the states) was freely supported. Bro. Cunningham was a prince of 'independent missionaries'; He had no half-way measures; his personal organ, The Tokio Christian, was a social register and benevolent energizer for his group. In 1942 the church notably sent a fine contribution to a run-down Toronto church, from which a pastor had once come to them. Both causes mentioned here are appearing, but the church was not well-taught, and so was unbalanced in its policy. It is not so much impulsive generosity in missions that counts; it is intelligent, sustained purpose. James M. Hyatt has been mentioned as elder; it may be said that he was the church's best loved man. He was elder before 1900, until his death in 1919. Amos MacDonald was another well loved man. Arthur P. Hyatt was likely best known now, since he visited conventions and for a time was a member of the Ontario Board of Co-operation. Of women, two names of later years stand out.: Mrs. Amos MacDonald and Mrs. Florence C. Mastin. The church has steadily served its community throughout a long period, though it is now not strong in numbers. It maintains its witness, and that is vital. It has a comfortable parsonage, and a cemetery; it is in Prince Edward County an institution to be proud of and to strongly support.\n\nReminiscences of Jos. Ash, letters of Mrs. John DeLong, and A. P. Hyatt, are bibliography, along with file of Christian Worker.\n\nCobourg, Northumberland County, Ontario\n\nThis church, founded by Jos. Ash in 1836, always considered itself as being the first one in Ontario founded on New Testament principles, direct from obedience to the Word, without any connection with, or knowledge of, any previously founded cult. The date of founding is that given in an official statement to the first June meeting, held in Esquesing, in June, 1843; and the same was reported to and published by the Millennial Harbinger, Bethany, Va., in the August-September issue of that year. The number reported as members in 1843, was but eight; but the movement [411] started by Jos. Ash was much greater than that. In relation to Cobourg, Jos. Ash tells something of his background and how be came to be in the new movement. This occurs in his \"Reminiscences\" (No. 1) of the origin of the Churches known in Ontario as Disciples of Christ, or Christian (as he personally would have phrased it at that early date.) These \"Reminiscences\" were published in the monthly issues of the Christian Worker, of Meaford, and ran (21 in number) from November, 1882 to September, 1884. He states that in 1829, (raised as an Anglican) he \"gave his whole heart to the Lord and obeyed Him as far as I (he) knew\". He was led to accept Christian baptism through the efforts of a member of the \"New Lights\", or Christian Connexion, and was baptized in September, 1830. At that time he knew nothing of the Reformation offered by Thomas and Alexander Campbell, of Western Pennsylvania. Eventually he learned of these men, and of the work of Barton W. Stone, of Kentucky. He was introduced to their respective journals, the Millennial Harbinger, (founded in 1830), and the Christian Messenger, by Barton W. Stone, and John T. Johnson, founded in 1826. On November 1, 1830 he read portions of both publications, with gratifying excitement. Quite naturally Jos. Ash became a member of the Christian Connexion body. In 1833, he attended its Conference at Newmarket, Ontario, and learned of its operations whereby the Conference took oversight of the various churches. His studies in Millennial Harbinger, enabled him to see how contradictory this was to the freedom of churches founded on a New Testament pattern. In the Conference at Whitby, in 1834, when he was clerk of the same, he offered a proposal looking to union of the two bodies, Disciples and Christian Connexion, on the same lines already accomplished on Jan. 1, 1832, in Kentucky, when Barton W. Stone and John Smith (for the Christians and Disciples) agreed to walk together. The result at Whitby was a tie vote, broken by the chairman against the union. While no \"Christian\" churches joined the Disciples, many individuals did, and the effort at union was to be renewed several times later in our history. This check to Ash's attempts at unity was such that he gave his time earnestly to the establishment of churches founded on New Testament principles. In the February issue of the Christian Worker, 1883, he tells dramatically and fervently of his winning to his views John Ford, a Carson Baptist, from Ireland. These two began to teach a small group of men their new beliefs on Lord's days; and on a certain Lord's day excitement was caused, because one of them asked for baptism, which Ash and Ford had never yet practised. They [412] decided that, to cover possible errors, it should be in private. A place on L. Ontario's shore was selected. He describes the moonlight gathering by the lake with emotion: the group was God-conscious and possessed with a desire to do His will. Apostolic-like, they \"knelt on the shore, and prayed\" for direction in this first testimony to New Testament directions in the matter of coming into the kingdom. The convert was John Hancock, a Methodist local preacher. At this point, Ash had not learned that it was advisable at the end of an address to ask for confession of the name of Christ. But to be brief, out of a body of Methodists, numbering fifteen or sixteen, and led by Charles Pomeroy, a small church was founded. The writer knows of no reason why it should not be considered our first, gathered in that direct manner. Some of our stronger churches had graduated out of the Scotch Baptist style of thought and practice, as illustrated elsewhere. This infant church seems to have arisen directly from the Book, so free were the preachers of any other aid. At an early organization meeting, brethren Ford and Ash were chosen as elders, and Chas. Pomeroy, deacon. Ash states that in a short time so rapid was the growth that they counted forty. In 1833, James Radcliffe, editor of the Cobourg Reformer, was baptized and became an influential leader, afterwards going to Philadelphia, where he did a valuable work for the cause. Our press yields not much news, but in the August No., of the Christian Banner 1857, it is noted that evangelists James Kilgour and C. J. Lister held a meeting in the spring, with eight baptisms and nine otherwise taking membership, making a total of twenty-four members. The services of the church were two public preaching ones on Sunday, and a Bible class for the young as well; also a weekly meeting for learning singing, and one for prayer. Moreover, a \"neat little chapel\" was erected on Seminary St., and its opening services were on September 1. The church made no stir in a co-operative way, and its administration was in the hands of one or two. Towards the last H. T. Wood was credited with its oversight. (He afterwards removed to Toronto in December 1886, and became active in Louisa St. congregation.) He took a large part in current proposals in 1857 and thereabouts, for the establishment of a Brotherhood press in Ontario. The need for a controlled journal grew out of dissatisfaction with such voluntary publications as they had. The founder of the congregation, Jos. Ash, had transferred his efforts mostly to other churches, at Oshawa and Bowmanville; but Cobourg added its quota to Disciple strength in the province. In December, 1886, the church, although low in numbers, gave liberally to advance the work elsewhere. [413]\n\nThe two Disciple, or Christian periodicals which Jos. Ash read in 1830, and which so affected his career and the religious faith of many in later years, came to the writer's hands, through the courtesy of his daughter, Mrs. A. E. Purcell, of Rodney, Ontario. She is (1947) the only surviving member of the large family of Jos. Ash. His historical books have, with many others (numbering about 300) have been placed in the care of Victoria and Emmanuel Colleges, Toronto, under the heading 'Writings of the Disciples of Christ-Canadian and American Collection.\"\n\nOshawa, Ontario County, Ontario\n\nThis church grew out of the work of Joseph Ash in his stay with the Christian Connexion, and it seems to be related closely to the founding of the work in Cobourg, in 1836. That date was given officially at the first June meeting, held in 1843. Ash states that in 1841, when he removed to Oshawa, it was then called Whitby. The \"Christians\" and Disciples were trying to get along together wherever they were, but when they worshipped together, differences became evident. The school house was used in turn by various bodies. A number of the friends of Ash became dissatisfied that there was no weekly communion, and with lack of what corresponded with N.T. teaching. So they asked him to go with them and organize a Christian church on true principles. They promised fidelity for life, if he would. So, a church was organized with the following members: Abram Farewell and wife, Jos. Ash and wife, Abram Coryell, John McGill, Nelson Pickell, seven in all. Dr. McGill came in later on. The first two were named as \"overseers\". The Christian Connexion people naturally were indignant and promised reforms if the members would return. They did, for a time, but finally separated, owing to irreconcilable differences in doctrine and practice. The church flourished, particularly after building a new house of worship. This event happened in October 15, 1848, a brother Campbell preaching. The church drew into its membership a number of Christian Connexion preachers, of whom the following are named: Solomon B. Rose, Elijah Gleason, Marshall B. Stone, Robert Brown, G. W. Colston. In time these men were attracted to other churches as preachers. Stone, Colston and Coryell particularly are noted as among early evangelists in Ontario, (1845-75). Dr. McGill became an elder, holding office for thirty years, with Ash. Then Oshawa had the addition of a notable preacher from Kentucky, who has fled to Canada \"to escape this terrible war\"--the Civil War, then raging. In American Discipledom Moses E. Lard is noted for his scholarly writings, volumes of commentaries, and for Lard's Quarterly [414] (1863-8). Much of his teachings harmonized with the early teachings of Campbell, known today as \"anti\". Like other and lesser men, he saw new truths too intensely, and lost the perspective that time often yields. Lard preached Restoration principles effectively in the churches of Bowmanville, Oshawa, and Pickering, and stirred up great opposition by his power to draw people. Out of Oshawa and Bowmanville there grew small congregations at Butterfield, Charlesville, and Clark townline; but Ash concludes that it is not desirable to plant real churches so near stronger ones, as they were weakened by it. He suggested that such be \"preaching points.\" James Lediard visited Oshawa in December, 1888 and reported things at a low ebb, although the small body gave liberally to help the provincial work. The work has long ceased. Ash withdrew from the place in (about) 1865, owing to his wife's death; he went to Essex and Kent counties, where his influence was felt for many more years. During the years after 1891 the Christians of Oshawa were co-operative to a degree with the Disciples, and later discussed union with them (Christian Worker, April, 1883).\n\nFrom this congregation there came into the later Ontario provincial work, from 1890 onwards until his death, J. E. Farewell, who was county Crown attorney. His financial contributions during his life were meritorious, and he also, left a considerable bequest to the Ontario Co-operation. The Abram Farewell member bequeathed earlier five thousand dollars to Co-operation work.\n\nNassagaweya, Halton County, Ontario\n\nThis township church lay within the northwesterly section of Halton county, nearest Wellington county. It abutted upon Eramosa township, where since 1825, James Black had resided in his long career of preacher of the Reformation gospel, farming to \"pay expenses.\" In Nassagaweya, Norrish, in his History of Nassagaweya, relates that \"Elder James Black\" used to have regular circuits in that rural district, where he ministered to otherwise deprived people, what he could of the mysteries of the gospel of Christ. These were purely voluntary efforts and depended not the least upon financial support, which has never been heard of by the writer, James Black was a lover of the Lord and he desired that all men might enjoy his faith. (Here one finds a rarity.) And it is enlightening when it is known that at this period of his developed faith, Black was in a growing process, having difficulty in sloughing off inherited conceptions gained within a Scottish background (theology), and entering into the liberty he later enjoyed, within the fold of the Restoration principles announced [415] by the Campbells. So Bro. Black went on preaching, year after year, whilst he was a school teacher in Nassagaweya, and later, as a farmer, in Eramosa. Such energy and consecration had a reward in his being able to form a new group, devoted to the ideals plainly set forth in the New Testament, as to conversion and following the Lord. Let it be stated again, these ideas, as known now, were then both new and somewhat dangerous, in the minds of some who heard. Such simplicity as \"obeying the gospel\", in complying with plain requirements of \"faith, repentance and baptism\", and then going on to enjoy and receive the \"gift of the Holy Spirit\", was repulsive to those who had been desirous of seeing visions, hearing voices, and possessing certain inward \"feelings\", to assure them that God had received them as followers of Jesus. Black's first preaching would be in about April, 1857, according to Jos. Ash, who also states that Alexander Anderson, of Eramosa, in 1842-3, held a number of meetings and baptized Alex. McPhedran and family as the first fruits. Brethren Kilgour and Lister later organized the church.\n\nWhen the farmers of a pioneer township received gospel privileges, of whatever sort, it was no trouble to erect a suitable one-room sanctuary, of logs, and consecrate it to God. This happened in Nassagaweya and this group was of Black's creation and circuit. Norrish says \"the Disciples of Christ built a little church at Brookville in 1870\". A contemporary wrote of him (Jos. Ash, \"Reminiscences\", No. 12, Christian Worker, Dec. 1883) \"My desire would carry me with elder Black through the forests of Nassagaweya, Eramosa and Erin, on foot, travelling fifty miles and back to preach twice on Lord's days and be back on Monday to attend to his farm.\" (See Biographies11). Few records of this group are available. The McPhedran family is best known, but Wm. Close was a presiding elder as well. Alex McPhedran died June 3, 1901. His son John McPhedran was a leader. After his death, also, in 1901, his widow and daughters came to Toronto and entered for a long term of fellowship with Cecil St. (Thus did the rural churches minister to the city.) Nassagaweya church was co-operative, as were almost the entire group up to 1900. In Dec., 1883, Andrew Scott, evangelist, reports 6 additions there and 20 members. Their foreign missionary offering in September, 1886, was $100. In March, 1889, it was $23.50, and they were often in the news. To go back to 1863, the little church was one of 20 that gave funds to the Co-operation ($18). [416] Another and interesting thing in connection with Nassagaweya church is that one of its members, a young man named Francis Hutchinson, a Scotch Baptist, so listened to Black's presentation of the Reformation plea, that he went into it wholeheartedly, afterwards going to Bethany, W. Va. and entering into the employ of A. Campbell in his printing business. He became an expounder also of some worth; and A. C. printed a fine essay of his in the Millennial Harbinger, March issue, 1833, but without explanation that it was the work of an intelligent Canadian from rural parts. The little Nassagaweya church finally passed from view in the early years of the century, doubtless owing to loss of leadership and trek to the cities. The remainder were merged in the Ontario body in an unorganized way. But Nassagaweya is a part of the whole Wellington District, where laborers like the \"Ontario Pioneer preachers\" have made it sacred soil, at least to those who know it.\n\nMeaford, Grey County, Ontario\n\nMeaford, a port on the Georgian Bay, is adjacent to St. Vincent township, and to these parts of the early unsettled north came elder William Trout, about whom much of interest is recorded in the sketches of Erin and Esquesing churches. He was one of the \"pastors\" of the early Scotch Baptist church in Esquesing, during the years from 1838 to 1845, when he removed to St. Vincent township and at once led the way to the formation of a new group. Apparently elder MacLaren, who had baptized him in Erin, had preceded him to the neighborhood of Cape Rich and founded a strictly Baptist congregation, from which group William Trout had evidently doctrinally emerged, after mixing with the advancing Esquesing church. Trout found the practice of close communion repugnant to his ideas of Christian fellowship, with its freedom; so he with his family and others met in private homes for a time in the village of Hurontario (east of Collingwood), to observe the weekly communion. Here his associates were Findlay McNaughton, George Jackson, Thos. Compton, and their families. During a period of eighteen months they received others into the N.T. faith. These early pioneer communities saw frequent removals to new locations, and this group was broken up, probably in 1846-7. Wm. Trout removed to a point near Meaford and followed his work as millwright. Soon a new association was formed with D. L. Layton, John Williams, a bro. Jackson, and others including Richard and Joseph Cox, who had belonged to the MacLaren group. About this group Wm. H. Trout, in the \"Trout Family History\", records that Mrs. Williams, and Mrs. McDonald, were baptized [417] in the Big Head river, also James Dunn; and in April, 1847, Mary and John Trout, and then Mary Mallory--\"though her uncle sent her from home for it.\" This Trout historian records that the gospel was spread by the men with their employees, and by their women to their feminine helpers. \"Thus father at work and mother at home co-operated in Home Mission work--done now by others.\" To the same historian Trout (son of Wm. Trout), we owe some of the foregoing; and Jos. Ash, in Christian Worker, February, 1884, supplied most of the rest. It is recalled also that William Trout, following his trade to Durham, while there gathered a small congregation and even built a house of worship. William Trout returned to Meaford about 1852, and in his absence brethren Layton and Williams developed into excellent gospel preachers. Later a house was built which served until 1880, when a larger church was put up, used today. A former Meafordite tells me that the period of 1880-88 was one of the church's greatest growth, owing to the work of evangelists of the strongest type. He recalls that Benjamin Franklin (of the American Christian. Review) held meetings, one of them in 1876, with from forty to eighty additions. (In that year Franklin was chief speaker at Erin June meeting.) Much Missionary work was done in this northern church as far back at 1849, by James Black, James Kilgour, and Alex Anderson, with many additions following. At this time Meaford congregation was a \"Co-operating\" church, and as late as February, 1863, at the February meeting of the congregation, held at Everton, St. Vincent Church (Meaford), contributed $30. to the funds. In 1859 David Oliphant labored there greatly. The indefatigable C. J. Lister is credited with \"more missionary work in that country than any other person\", wrote Jos. Ash. Meaford also had the work of W. W. Eaton, Edmund Sheppard, and Alfred Elmore. The work of J. A. Harding, of Kentucky, at Meaford, was so disturbing to the community on the subject of Christian Baptism that debate was held at Meaford, for six days, beginning December 15, 1884, in which the Methodist view was advocated by Rev. T. L. Wilkinson, and the whole published by a syndicate, a 406 page book, printed by Wm. Briggs, Toronto. (Mr. Wilkinson debated also at Wiarton and Everton, with Hugh McDiarmid as an opponent, but there was no publication.) Principal men in the early times, in addition to those mentioned were James Stirling, and brethren Saunders and Mallory who migrated to Carman, Man. and founded the work there. Other leaders were James Trout, Charles Jay, Jos. C. Whitelaw, H. T. Law, J. J. Johnston. It is of record too that Meaford church in December, [418] 1881, was a member of a northern group which at Meaford instituted \"The Georgian Bay Co-operation\" and supported the efforts of H. B. Sherman, as paid evangelist and editor of The Christian Worker. H. B. Sherman's first number contained this reference: \"The Meaford church is working like a perfect piece of machinery, the bishops being the power behind the throne, as they ought to be everywhere\"--a statement that has peculiar connotations. Since that time not much \"co-operating\" with the brethren provincially has been placed to the credit of Meaford. One or two of its preaching brethren were responsible for starting causes at Cape Rich and Euphrasia township. Evangelist W. D. Cunningham visited Meaford in March, 1900, and reported a small church, much divided on various questions; no missionary spirit or work attempted. Much of the liberal spirit of its early founded had been lost in the attempt to route Christian thinking and duty through the idea that the N.T. record of the early church necessarily provided an authentic pattern \"as from the Mount\" of all succeeding churches as to polity and practice. Such suppositions and literalism have succeeded in strangling the \"spirit\" of the gospel and creating disunity, to the destruction of the progress otherwise possible. Regretfully also, it may be noted that some churches of the Niagara District have suffered from the same sort of leadership. And it might also be said that the enlightening spirit of enquiry born of the early Reformers and the Campbells, pointed eventually towards Christian liberalism in interpretation which would have made the Restoration Movement a greater instrument of reform that it has ever become so far. But, that effort at reform is still at work, and some men, at least learn through experience.\n\nCooksville, Peel County, Ontario\n\nPreaching here was done by the elder James Beaty, of Toronto, according to Jos. Ash (Christian Worker, July, 1883). He reports a gathering of a group \"many years ago\". It is learned from the Banner of the Faith, 1861, page 76, that the membership was then but eleven persons. If the forming of the group occurred \"many years ago\" it seems to perhaps point back to about 1840, at any rate a pioneer church, which met in the home of Bro. Ross. Mr. Ross had himself been baptized by Alexander Campbell, in Richmond, Va. A brother Wilcox was also active. Such a group meeting in this intimate fashion for so long, would accumulate much more of what is called 'fellowship' than occurs in many years of association with kirk and large congregation. Not to say that it is necessarily so. Whenever there was a preacher who could instruct, in addition to the regular weekly [419] exhortations of the elders, so much there was added to the experience. There is never embarrassment in the church that meets without its preacher regularly for the Lord's table. Another such group was in Toronto township, Peel County.\n\nErin Township (Centre), Ontario\n\nBack of Erin Church of Christ (Disciples) was a Scotch Baptist congregation originating in 1837.12 Of the Erin Scotch Baptists the \"Trout Family History\", (by William H. Trout, Milwaukee, Wis., 1919,) page 48, presents some significant 'early' material. The congregation had as elders Archibald McArthur and Donald MacLaren. MacLaren was of that Scotch Baptist type of mind which is bound by primitive concepts and can seldom venture beyond them. William Trout, a millwright, was for a time resident in Erin, and while there became desirous of a more definite religious experience, although he had tried without satisfaction the \"mourner's bench\". Trout was a very thorough sort of man and later proved to be a strong promulgator of the cause. Through reading the New Testament he became convinced that the way of salvation lies more in the region of study and reason than in the way of emotion. He learned that the New Testament connected salvation from sin, directly with baptism \"for the remission of sins,\" and that obedience seemed necessary. (Example; Acts 2:38). He was, therefore led to baptism by elder MacLaren, and to that immersion in a creek many persons came, some of them twenty miles. Such loyalty to the book produced scorn and hostility, and such became common for decades. His baptism must have occurred before 1837, as be removed to Esquesing and became one of the \"pastors\" of that congregation, according to its records in the writer's possession' in 1838. He remained there until the year 1845, when he moved to St. Vincent township, and with others was instrumental in starting the Meaford congregation. Returning now to the Erin Centre. No further history is to be found than that concerned with the development of its founder, James Black. The key to Black's activities and teaching lie within the associated Eramosa record when it was a Scotch Baptist church--ere it became Disciple. Teaching from the mind of James Black was said to be very loyal to the Bible text. Both Trout and Black, in their lives, deeply exhibit the character of 'living witnesses.'\n\nIn the year 1836 James Black, of Eramosa, started to preach in the old log school house that was situated on the N.W. corner of lot 17 in the seventh concession of the township, visiting that part once a week. (He had [420] other engagements in Eramosa and \"the adjoining township of Nassagaweya). Such a trip involved travel on Saturdays and Mondays over poor roads and often on foot--when roads were impassable. James Black's habit was to preach (teach) as much as possible, and allow worldly matters to take second place. His teaching ministry won him attention where mere oratory would have repelled. By 1840, he is said to have organized the Erin congregation, although he need not be credited with being the sole speaker, for there were other preachers. But James Black lived in adjoining Eramosa, and Erin was his Judaea. Some names of charter members are extant: Peter McDougall, Charles Munn, Dugald Thomson, Hector McLellan, John Bott, the Burtt family. Erin came into the Reformation program along with the congregations in Eramosa and Esquesing.13\n\nIn 1843, the church had progressed to the point where more accommodation was needed for worshippers, and the first building, of frame, was erected, near the brick building, now disused. Soon twelve feet had to be added, but that became insufficient. The leaders in spiritual matters at that time were chosen, as follows: Dugald Thomson and Hugh McMillan, and they were assisted by visits from James Black and others. Hugh McMillan also preached, and John Thomson, in early days. In 1851, Archibald McMillan and Charles McMillan, were appointed to assist the others in their duties, and the following were appointed as deacons: Peter McDougall, Peter Thomson, Lachlan McKinnon, John McDougall, and Colin McMillan. For a number of years this continued, until it was realized that the building was too small, even though a mission church had been established at Mimosa in 1863. The neighboring villages of Hillsburg and Erin had offered free sites on which to build, but the congregation decided to erect a stone church right in the centre of the township--on the property of Donald Ferguson, which he had offered. Thus the church became known as \"Erin Centre\". It was opened on Sunday, October 28, 1860. The brethren had built grandly, the floor space, according to the writer's estimate exceeding any known to him in Ontario. It housed a growing church, and when a new cause was organized at Marsville, taking away members who lived nearer that place, still the house was often crowded to capacity. The church at this date is credited with a membership of 250, hence it may be assumed that the people went to church in Erin whether or not they were members. The church was an outlet in those days, which at present it is not. Erin enjoyed the assistance of nearby preachers, such as James Kilgour, A. [421] Anderson, C. J. Lister, and Edmund Sheppard. Although spiritual oversight had been given by those mentioned in the earlier part of this account, \"no officers of the church had been set apart by prayer or imposition of hands. The reason assigned is that individuals should be thoroughly proved, and if their qualifications harmonize with those inspired criteria of a scriptural overseer or bishop--then they may, in primitive style assume that most responsible office.\"14 This timidity--for perhaps it was only that in individuals--is worth thinking over by congregations which sometimes seem to select spiritual leaders by other standards than character. Of Erin Centre, it is the writer's opinion, based on the scanning of financial reports of missionary co-operation for years, that this church exceeded in actual money reported all others in early years, although Eramosa and Toronto were about as good. And in later years, its members scattering with necessities of the times, gave themselves to other congregations in Ontario"
