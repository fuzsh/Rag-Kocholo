The large Hall was fitted up for the occasion. Three tables, capable of containing 62 persons each, were spread the whole length of the Hall, and furnished with all the substantials and dainties of the season, get up in splendid style, after beautiful models, and in the most approved manner. Near the head of the centre table was a very fine model of the first old fashioned Ramage Press used by Franklin, with a person dressed in pressman's garb, taking the impression. This article, which was quite a perfect thing of its kind, was constructed at the instance of the Messrs. Blossom, and by them ordered to be given to the author of the best original toast from abroad.\n\nThere were present on this occasion several of the Patriarchs of the Craft—Fathers of the Press in Western New York—who added much to the festivity of the occasion by their recollections of former times, and the hearty good humor with which, although long since immersed in other pursuits, they entered into the convivialities of the festival. Among those that were pioneers of printing in the early days of Western New York, were Augustine G. Dauby, editor and publisher of the first newspaper in Rochester in 1816, and now Postmaster at Utica; James D. Bemis, the Nestor of the Western New York Press, who was a publisher in Canandaigua near the commencement of the present century; L. H. Redfield, of Syracuse, an apprentice of Mr. Bemis, one of the earliest publishers of Onondaga county; Everard Peck, publisher of the second paper in Rochester, in 1818; Edwin Scranton, an apprentice of Mr. Dauby, and his successor as publisher; F. Follett, one of the earliest editors of Genesee county, who published a paper in Batavia in 1825; Ansel Warren, as old eastern printer and publisher, (now editor of the Perry Citizen,) who has seen much service in the profession, and is an antiquarian in the Craft; Franklin Cowdrey, who knows more of the ups and downs of a printer's life than any man living; Wm. A. Welles, an old eastern printer, who has passed through a great variety of fortune, not only in his profession, but in many other pursuits; and Philemon Canfield, an old Hartford publisher, who, although advancing in years, is still devoted to his profession in Rochester. The presence of these pioneers and patriarchs invested the occasion with an unusual degree of interest.\n\nThe festival was also honored by the presence of several Reverend gentlemen, formerly or still connected with the Press, viz: Rev. A. G. Hall, Pastor of the Third Presbyterian Church, of this city, formerly editor of the Rochester Observer; Rev. D. C. Houghton, of the Presbyterian Church in Le Roy; and Rev. J. Roxie, of the Methodist Church, editor of the Genesee Evangelist.\n\nA goodly number of editors and publishers from abroad were present, among whom we noticed Dr. Foote, of the Buffalo Commercial; A. M. Clapp, of the Express; Jas. O. Brayman, of the Courier; S. S. Blanchard, of the Warsaw New Yorker; A. Warren, of the Perry Citizen; W. A. Seaver, of the Batavia Times; D. D. Waite, of the Advocate; C. B. Thompson, of the Le Roy Gazette; J. M. Campbell, of the Republican, Geneseo; E. S. Palmer, of the Allegany County Advocate; C. W. Dibble, of the Dansville Whig; Messrs. Kinney & McDermott, of the Syracuse Star; E. T. Bridges, Editor Watchman, Brockport; Geo M. Dana, of Ithaca, and several others whose names are not recollected.\n\nAmong the guests were a large number of ex-printers, some of whom have been connected with the Press in other parts of the country.\n\nThe meeting assembled at the Drawing Rooms of the Hotel about four o'clock, where a couple ​of hours were spent in sharpening the appetite, by social converse. About six, the company, headed by Adams' Brass Band, moved to the dining room and organized as follows:\n\nPresident—A. G. DAUBY, Esq., Utica.\n\n1st V. Pres't—Dr. T. M. Foote, Buffalo.\n\n2d do—L.

Follett, 3d V. P. Capt. Adams A. Warren, 4th V.P.\n\n​All being seated in the order indicated in the diagram, the President rose and addressed the audience as follows:\n\nGentlemen, Fellow Craftsmen, Brethren—\n\nI am entirely unable to give expression to the feelings of my heart on this occasion. Never before have I experienced a more overwhelming sense of the poverty of language to express in adequate terms the emotions that are struggling in my bosom for utterance, but which can find no tongue. I thank you, gentlemen, for the honor you have conferred upon me, but to the pleasure which it affords, is added a weight of responsibility, that to one unaccustomed as I am, to scenes like these, is oppressive and embarrassing. But when I remember that I am standing, as I know I am, among my friends, all of whom are more anxious to conceal than expose my defects, I am reassured, and feel that whatever expectations may have been formed, you will all be satisfied with that spontaneous outpouring of the heart, which however much it may lack in worldly wisdom, is the best and clearest index of the soul, and perhaps the most gratifying response that friendship and gratitude can give. Again, I thank you, gentlemen, for the honor you have conferred upon me; but think not that I am so lacking in all proper humility as to be insensible of the cause to which I am mainly indebted for it. There is a circumstance in the life of the individual who is now addressing you, which although it may constitute no just claim of merit, has been regarded by you a sufficient reason for placing him in the situation he now occupies. The circumstance to which I have referred is perhaps no otherwise important than as connected with the early history of the city in which we are; a city that has sprung almost like Minerva from the head of Jupiter, full grown. No, gentlemen. I am mistaken. Rochester is not full grown. Its past history is replete with wonders, but its future destiny, I trust, will not be less marked by extraordinary progress and the development of all the elements of its manufacturing and commercial prosperity and greatness.\n\nWhen I look around, it is impossible for me to realize that I was the first printer who established business in this city. How brief a period in the history of a nation; how long in the life of man, has since elapsed. It is now more than a quarter of a century ago since I first came to this place. What were the precise motives that influenced me in choosing this as the place of my location, it is perhaps at this time difficult for me to say; nor can it be a matter of any consequence for you to know. It certainly had few attractions at that period; yet there were those even then who believed it destined to become a place of great importance, and their anticipations, sanguine and extravagant as they were supposed to be, have been in its rapid growth, more than realized. My main object, however, in coming here, was to establish myself in business, and to acquire, what every young man should be ambitious to acquire, not unearned and sudden wealth, but a hard earned competency, the just reward of labor and perseverance, and an unblemished reputation.\n\nIt would not be difficult for me to enumerate many incidents in the early history of this place. They are fresh in my recollection; but most of the actors have passed away: death has been busy here, and borne from you many of the \"first settlers,\" and I will not remove the covering that shrouds them from the living, and cause them to appear before you either for amusement or instruction. But when I remember what Rochester was, and what it is, so closely associated with its rise and progress is one individual, that I cannot disconnect him from it or fail to see in its prosperity the wisdom and forecast with which he always seemed to me eminently endowed. Well do I remember the impression he made upon my youthful mind. He was a venerable man, and now through the lapse of more than a quarter of a century, I distinctly recognize the grave and circumspect demeanor that distinguished him and impressed all who saw him with a deep sentiment of respect. I speak of the gentleman who was the founder of this city, and whose name it bears—Col. Nathaniel Rochester. Other individuals are perhaps entitled to nearly equal credit and distinction. Some of them are yet living actors in the busy drama of life; efficient and influential members of your society, but I cannot enumerate them all, and will not make a distinction that might seem invidious. Let me however, say to you, gentlemen, that Rochester in 1847, with its busy, thronging population; its well paved streets; its magnificent churches; its elegant private mansions; its well built rows of stores; its flouring mills; its manufactories, and its work shops, is no more the Rochester of 1816, than the most finished piece of sculpture is the unhewn, rough and shapeless marble of the quarry: that this wonderful change has not been the work of a few individuals. It is not my wish, nor is it my purpose, to detract from the merits of any person; but Rochester as it is, is the creation of a mightier power than individual effort. The prodigious results seen here have been produced by the active and combined energies of a whole people, and are in part the necessary consequence of advantageous local position, and the enterprise and industry of every section of the State.\n\nBut, I have been digressing. We have come not here to trace the history of Rochester, but to pay deserved honor to the illustrious dead. We have met as brethren of one profession; as printers, proud of the virtues and the fame of a member of our fraternity. Franklin was a printer; and is there a member of the craft who is not proud of the distinction which he acquired. He may not be the worthier by what was done by that great man, but as he catches a glimpse of the bright halo that encircles his name and character, he will feel that a reflected glory rests upon himself, and with a steadier eye and firmer step ascend the rugged pathway that leads to the goal of an honorable ambition. But Franklin was not only a printer, he was a philosopher, a statesman and a patriot. He did not belong to our craft alone; that was his starting point, but in the race of life, the apprentice boy placed himself among the most distinguished of men. How ​fruitful of instruction is his example; how strong the incentive to honorable exertion it affords.\n\nIt was said by a celebrated Frenchman, Voltaire; and there is not less truth than beauty in the expression, \"that some men are like statues, the higher they are elevated the smaller they appear.\" It was not so with Franklin. His statue has grown more colossal and imposing by the lapse of time and distance. There it stands on the proud summit of human greatness, and could that colossal form be invested with life and consciousness, and think, and feel, and see, as Franklin; thought, and felt, and saw, with what mingled emotions of amazement and delight would it contemplate the changed aspect and condition of the world, and how would its throbbing heart be filled with ecstacy and wonder as its vision rested upon its own loved native land.\n\nThe prescient mind of Franklin, great as it was, could not survey the boundless realms of unexplored learning and science; yet with a forecast that seems more the inspiration than the deduction of human reason, he foreshadowed the invention that has annihilated time and space—the magnetic telegraph—the wonder of the age, and which has inscribed the name of Morse, in letters of living light, on the same tablet upon which is emblazoned that of the immortal Franklin.\n\nThis discovery of the Telegraph I claim as purely American (by regular succession, as is said of the reign of kings) from the idea of Franklin, that electricity might be made the medium of thought, down to its inventor; and who is more worthy to hear the honors that gather round the name of the great philosopher and statesman than Professor Morse. They were not connected by blood, but their names are united by discoveries that will remain an unbroken chain of union while time shall last; and wherever the lightning's flash shall be seen or the roar of thunder heard, these two philosophers will be remembered as Americans whose scientific researches have benefited, enlightened, adorned and helped to give their country a name among the great, the learned, the wise, and the good in all time to come.\n\nOur country is emphatically a new country; yet it already stands out \"a bright and cheering example, the moral and political model and guide, the hope and admiration of the nations of the earth. But from the distant and shadowy past there comes to us no voice and no glory: we have not, in this new land, the mouldering tower and shattered column to awaken poetical interest; but the last quarter of a century, has it not been filled with what would have been considered, in ages gone by, events of thrilling romance? The most fertile imagination, one hundred years since, would have hardly dreamed of what is passing every day before our eyes; but time will not permit me to take even a hasty glance at the splendid and wonderful achievements of the human intellect; the peaceful acquisitions of science and art, and the general and rapid progression of the human race. Neither have I been able to more than barely alude to the general characteristics of the great philosopher and statesman whose birth-day we are assembled to celebrate. It is not necessary that I should have done so, for his history is familiar to you all. A knowledge of his fame and character is wide spread, not only throughout our land, but in every quarter of the habitable globe, where mental degradation and darkness have not interposed an impassable barrier to the light of truth, and vivifying rays of genius, of learning and of science. Who is there in a country where there is light, and knowledge, and civilization, that has not beard of Franklin, the printer, the philosopher, the statesman, and the patriot. His mind was cast in a peculiar die: his talents shone out in every department of thought, and he not only made a great and durable impression on human affairs, but there was an exuberant good nature, and a sweet and beaming benevolence in his disposition, that won the hearts of men. His soul was like a divine and noble temple, where truth, and candor, and virtue sat eternally enthroned.\n\nGentlemen, fellow-craftsmen, brethren; again I thank you.\n\nThe throne of grace having been addressed in an appropriate manner by Rev. Mr. Hall, the work commenced in good earnest. It is unnecessary to say that full justice was done to the viands, and that the castles, towers, temples and buildings of various shapes which the skilful hand of the cook had fashioned, fell like the walls of Monterey before the artillery of Gen. Taylor. The following is the bill of fare:\n\nOyster Soup.

Benjamin Franklin—A Star whose brilliancy is not dimmed by the effacing hand or Time; his life presents a perfect copy for members of the Craft in every land. May each one be as free from errors when revised by the Great Proof Reader of the universe.\n\n\"Auld Lang Syne.\"\n\n2. The Typographical Fraternity—Having Franklin for our guide, although made up of all sorts of matter, we challenge the world to produce one whose impressions will be as indelible, or who is as mighty.\n\n\"Come, brothers, arouse.\"\n\n3. The Union—A capital font of superior figures, set up by Yankees, and worked with balls. The thirtieth edition shows the work was well justified and the register good.\n\n\"Yankee Doodle.\"\n\n4. Washington—The brightest name in our country's history. No spot has ever appeared to mar its brilliancy.\n\n\"Washington's Grand March.\"\n\n5. The President of the United States—The head of the National column. May he always be able to justify his public matter by the line of integrity.\n\n\"President's March.\"\n\n6. The State of New-York—There are many stars of magnitude, but for large fonts, full cases, and abundance of sorts, politically, commercially, and typographically, thou excellest them all.\n\n\"March.\"\n\n7. The Governor of the State of New-York—A. YOUNG compositor. May his works justify the confidence reposed in him by the people.\n\n\"Governor's March.\"\n\n8. The Heroes of '76—Publishers of the History of the American Revolution: They set up their title at Bunker's Hill, and the last page at Yorktown, embellishing it with a spirited representation, of the surrender of an English army.\n\n\"Star Spangled Banner.\"\n\n9. The Press—Freedom's chase which locks together in one em-brace those who would defend the principles for the maintenance of which the leaders of the Revolution used their shooting-sticks so effectually.\n\n\"Printers' Quick Step.\"\n\n10. The Telegraph—Franklin caused the lightning to be obedient to his will, and Morse has made it the medium of thought.\n\n\"Moss Roe Waltz.\"\n\n11. Common Schools—Through them the non-pareils of to-day become the paragons of to-morrow.\n\n12. The Army and Navy of the United States.\n\n\"Hail Columbia.\"\n\n13. The Ladies—Truly unique and beautiful specimens of Nature's typography—the paragon type of Heaven's love to man.\n\n\"The Girl we left behind us.\"\n\nThe President having been called upon for a sentiment, said:\n\nGentlemen:—In responding to the call made upon me, I will detain you only for a moment.—It is not my purpose to make a speech. It is not necessary that I should do so, for the sentiment I intend to offer requires no explanation to be understood and appreciated by you all. It will find an echo in every bosom in which there is a heart that can feel and sympathise with that of its fellow-man. I have already spoken of the general and rapid progression of the human race; but much remains to be accomplished to complete its higher and more glorious destiny. It is an often repeated truism, that \"intelligence is the life of liberty.\" The degraded and ignorant mind is in bondage; it is fettered and stultified; and neither knows its own nor the rights of others; of every member of the community, and of the whole community; but the regenerating light of knowledge is spreading over the world, and commensurate with its progress is the advancement of the human race, in comfort and happiness, and in its moral, social and political condition. I give you then, gentlemen:\n\nThe Spirit of the Age: A spirit that seeks the melioration of the condition of the toiling millions, and ensures to them a better, happier and brighter destiny.\n\nThe volunteers then flowed in thick and fast, in the following order:\n\nBy Erastus Shepard—Our venerated guest, James D. Bemis, the father of the Press in Western New York: May his noble form long withstand the pelts which are beating it, and his last edition be well bound in the book of life.\n\nThis sentiment was received standing, as a, mark of respect to the venerable gentleman to whom it referred.\n\nMr. Bemis responded in the following manner:\n\nMr. President and Gentlemen:—I am unable suitably to acknowledge the kind regard you have manifested for one so unworthy of it. I can only thank you, and as your time will be better used by others, I will abridge what I intended to say by remarking, that he must deem it a happy event in his life, who is invited to participate in this \"Feast of Reason,\" prepared by our munificent friends of this beautiful city.\n\nWho and what do we here behold! would be the involuntary exclamation of one who saw this \"mill yard\" thirty-five years ago, when one small store, a saw and grist mill, and a few rude dwellings only were to be seen. If the visitor had been absent during that period, he would be as greatly amazed at the magic changes which have been wrought, as was Rip Van Winkle on returning to his altered native village after his twenty years' asleep. He would find, instead of the few rough buildings scattered about the old fording place, of the Genesee, a splendid and bustling town, of 25,000 people—a commercial mart—a manufacturing bee-hive. And, in one of the spacious halls erected by their enterprise and taste, a large and festive company, composed of a fair type of the intelligence, the talent, and the spirit of the age, whose vocation it is to enlighten the minds and mend the hearts of others—to spread knowledge, modify public sentiment, encourage industry, and to keep our Republican form from being thrown [?]. We have seen or read of ​disparties consisting of the learned, the scientific, and the witty; but we have here a Digest of them all bound together and lettered, if not gilt, and combining all that is useful or pleasing for a reading people—and such are the people of Old Genesee. Printers, Editors, Correspondents, and others, in some way connected with the \"art preservative of all arts,\" are met in this place to hear or be heard, and to commemorate the birth of the great Philosopher Printer—the immortal Franklin—a man, who,\n\nI offer you a sentiment:—\n\nThe Printers of Rochester: The tokens they have worked off to-day, have made impressions never to be erased.\n\nBy P. Canfield—Our Brethren in Buffalo: As our circular has not been responded to, we expect to hear a good report from them this evening.\n\nDr. Foote, of the Buffalo Commercial Advertiser, returned thanks, and, after apologising for being unaccustomed to public speaking, remarked that on an occasion like the present reference to those illustrious in the craft was both natural and becoming. The memory of Franklin had been honored in fitting and most eloquent terms by the President. In the career of that great and illustrious Philosopher and Patriot, printing was but an incident; but there are others whose fame was all our own, whose memory should never die. In the infancy of the Art, printers were among the most learned men, and to their profound scholarship the world owed elegant editions of the most renowned Greek and Roman classics, till then almost utterly unknown, which editions are even now recognised as the most valuable extant. Especially are we indebted for these labors—to them a labor of love—to the Printers of Venice, a republic, then distinguished like our own, for the extent of her commerce, and the valor of her arms. It could scarcely be otherwise than that printers should be men of much literary cultivation. Men cannot long be engaged in embodying, in dull metal, \"thoughts that breath and words that burn\" without partaking, in some degree, of the same animating spirit. Printing is, in truth, a learned and liberal profession, whose usefulness, influence and dignity should never be forgotten or degraded by its members. The speaker concluded by giving, and commending to the emulation of all—The Scholar Printers of Venice.\n\nL. H. Redfield, Esq., of Syracuse, 2d Vice President, responded to a call from the chair, as follows:\n\nMr President:—Not being accustomed to public speaking, I have, from recollection alone, collected together a few reminiscences, to which I have added some remarks, which, I hope, may not, on this occasion, prove entirely uninteresting. One of the earliest lessons, sir, which I learned in a printing office, was to follow my copy—even if it went out of the window. Early habits, sir, whether good or bad, are not easily dispensed with; I ask your indulgence, therefore, while I read my hasty and imperfect production.\n\nMy first acquaintance, sir, with the Press of Western New York, was in 1808. I commenced my apprenticeship in the office of the Ontario Repository, at Canandaigua, in the summer of that year. The only newspapers in existence at that early period, west of Cayuga Lake, were the Repository; the Geneva Gazette, by my respected friend, James Bogert; the Ontario Messenger, by John A. Stevens, and the Cornucopia, published at Batavia, by Benjamin Blodget. It is possible there may have been one or two others, but if there were I do not recollect them. The Repository, I believe, was established by Gould & Post, in 1803. Mr. Bemis became connected with the establishment about 1805. Under the direction of that good man, the Repository became one of the leading and most respectable journals in the State, and so continued for upwards of a quarter of a century, under his able and judicious management.\n\nAnd here permit me, sir, to digress one moment, while I attempt to pay a deserved tribute of respect to my early and valued friend. Mr. Bemis, aside from a thorough knowledge of the duties of his profession, possessed a mild and even temper, and a dignity of deportment, which rendered him peculiarly well qualified to educate and instruct those who were placed under his care for the purpose of acquiring a knowledge of our noble art. And well and nobly did he acquit himself of the difficult task. I hope there are many of his pupils still living to bear witness to the truth of what I say. For myself, I feel that I owe to that venerable and most excellent man, a debt of everlasting gratitude. Whatever of prosperity or success in life, I have enjoyed, I owe, mainly, to the early training and habits of business which he taught me, and to his judicious counsel and advice, in after years. My friend, (and the friend of us all, I trust,) is still living, and I rejoice that the severe malady with which (as you may know) he is afflicted, has permitted him to meet us around this festive board. All who know him will agree with me, that he is entitled to our sympathy in his afflictions, and to our grateful respect as a printer, and a man.\n\nExcuse me, Mr. President, for this digression. I could not say less for the friend to whom I owe so much.\n\nI think the Cornucopia must have been established about the year 1806 or 1807. Such a newspaper, at the present day, would be a curiosity—(I had almost said, a natural one.) It was about the size of a foolscap sheet, and frequently came to us on common wrapping paper—not such wrapping paper as is now made, but of the blackest and coarsest specimen of that quality of paper at that early day. And the type, (if they might be dignified with that appellation) were in keeping with the paper. Take it altogether, it was like a picture made for fun, and if a copy could now be found, it should be deposited in the museum.\n\nMr. Bogart's paper, at Geneva, was called the Geneva Gazette, and must have been established about 1806 or 1807. It was then a most ​respectable paper, both in size and mechanical appearance. It was conducted for nearly 25 years by Mr. B., its original founder, and is still in existence. Its worthy and amiable projector is yet living, and I regret that he is not here to make one of us on this interesting occasion. Mr. Bogert was one of the best printers in Western New York, as all printers, who were in the habit of visiting his office, can attest.\n\nThe Ontario Messenger was established by John A. Stevens, about the same time of the Geneva Gazette. It was printed on the old fashioned Ramage press, as were all the other papers I have named; indeed, there were no other presses in use at that early day. Mr. Stevens continued with the Messenger some 20 years. If I am not mistaken, Mr. S. was not considered a very good printer, but he was esteemed as a most kind and benevolent hearted man. I regret to add, that in after life, adversity overtook him, and yielding to intemperate habits, he finally ended his days in the poor house of this county. I well remember, that at the time I was an apprentice, it was a common practice to keep ardent spirits in the Messenger office, to be drank by those who visited the office on business, and by the hands. Is it strange, then, that the fate of our friend was thus melancholy?\n\nDavid M. Day, who afterwards established the Buffalo Journal, as good hearted a man as ever worked a token or composed a thousand, was an apprentice in the Messenger office. What printer of Western New York does not mourn over his untimely end, and regret the fatal cause?\n\nI see around me, sir, many younger members of the profession—they will pardon me in saying, Beware of the fatal rock on which these and other gifted brothers of our craft have been wrecked.\n\nI am happy in being able to say, that, as a class, printers of the present day are among the most intelligent and successful advocates of temperance. It is a very rare occurrence to find one who indulges in the use of ardent spirits; still more rare to see any kind of ardents in a printing office. I congratulate you, brethren, upon this proof of the superior intelligence and moral worth in our profession.\n\nI should have added, that in 1808 and '09, the Messenger was edited by Jesse Hawley, Esq., late of this city. It was in those years that Mr. Hawley published his articles on the (then) startling project of the Erie Canal. These publications did much towards creating a spirit of inquiry in relation to this splendid enterprise; but, unwilling as I am, to detract one jot or tittle of just praise from the efforts of Mr. H., history establishes the fact, that, to Joshua Forman, then of Onondaga, more than to any other man, belongs the credit of first originating, and afterwards assisting to perfect and accomplish this stupendous work—the pride of New York, and now the principal source of State wealth.\n\nThe next paper established in Western New York, was the Buffalo Gazette, by my fellow apprentice, Smith H. Salisbury, about 1812. We used to receive, in war time, our bulletins of news from the Gazette office. Smith was a right merry fellow—full of fun. But alas ! where now is he? He has worked his last sheet—his last proof has been taken—his form is unlocked by death, and he has passed to a new and final edition.\n\nAbout 1816, I believe the first paper was published in this place, and, as we have been informed, by our respected friend who presides over us on this occasion. Soon after followed the Telegraph, by Mr. E. Peck. Since that period, others have sprung up here, at Buffalo, Palmyra, &c. &c, all over the country, to an extent which I will not attempt to enumerate.\n\nIn 1814, my apprenticeship having expired, and with nothing to recommend me but industry and a good trade, I wended my way to the county of Onondaga, to seek a livelihood by the art and mystery of printing. At that period there was but one paper in Onondaga county—the Manlius Times, by Leonard Kellogg. A paper called the Lynx, by P. C. Fay, had been established at Onondaga Hollow, but was discontinued in a year or two after its commencement. It was in this office, that our respected friend, Thurlow Weed, made his debut in the art of arts. Mr. W., in the short space of about 12 months, became printer's devil, journeyman, editor, and I do not know but finally proprietor of the memorable Lynx.\n\nMy humble sheet, the Onondaga Register, made its appearance at Onondaga Hollow in September, 1814. The Onondaga Gazette, by Evander Morse, was established at Onondaga Hill, in 1816. It was edited for some time by the celebrated Wm. Ray. Mr. Morse sold the establishment to our friend C. S. McConnell, and soon after went to Cincinnati, where he died.\n\nThe next paper in Onondaga county was the Manlius Republican, and was established by Mr. Weed, now the able and talented editor of the Albany Evening Journal. After a year, Mr. W. not meeting with the desired success, discontinued his paper, and soon after connected himself with the Press of this city.\n\nThe history of Mr. Weed is one full of hope and encouragement to the younger members of the craft; one which they may study with profit. Unaided by adventitious circumstances, he has raised himself from the humblest walk of life to be a respected friend and equal of the first men in our State. Such men are an honor to themselves and to their profession, as well as to the free institutions of our country—those institutions which recognise virtue and talents as the only passports to honor and renown.\n\nFrom 1820, I will not attempt an enumeration of the newspaper establishments in Onondaga co. Many have come suddenly into existence, and disappeared as rapidly, while others, more favored, have stood quietly on, and are still in existence. The first Iron Press introduced into the county, I believe, was purchased by myself—and I also first introduced into Onondaga the composition roller, one of the most valuable improvements connected with printing ever invented. The county of Onondaga now numbers nine weekly papers—three daily and two monthly. Three of these establishments have Power Presses.\n\n​Without longer trespassing open your patience with these statistical facts, permit me to say in conclusion, the life of a Printer, Sir, as many of us well know by sad experience, is a life of toil, anxiety and self sacrifice—a life of great self denial. But, if it has its disadvantages, it has already its great advantage, and, as the art advances, will have greater.\n\nFor those who are willing to improve the mind, it affords a continued school for the acquisition of knowledge. It opens a wide field of influence and usefulness. There is, probably, no greater moral power than the power of the Press. Those who conduct it should be intelligent, virtuous, honest men. But to succeed in the profession, as a business, we must practice the most rigid rules of industry and economy, and learn to eat the bread of frugality and carefulness.\n\nAnd great as have been the improvements in the mechanical facilities of the profession, it has not yet been discovered that the business will go of itself. It requires punctual attention, untiring perseverence, rigid economy and frugality, none the less for the wonderful character of its improvements. It is a business, in reference to which, or the emoluments of which, most people, not practically concerned, more widely err in their estimates than respecting almost any other. Nor is any class of mechanics so inadequately compensated for their labor, time, exertion, and usefulness counted, as the printers.\n\nBefore I sit down, sir, allow me to say, that the conductors of newspapers, and all connected with them, are deeply interested in the manner in which they discharge their public duties. The American press is subject to the charge of not having always maintained that high and honorable standing which should belong to it. Editors have too often allowed themselves to become mere gladiators, beating and bruising each other for the benefit of political leaders and the amusement of the vulgar. They have not always exercised towards each other that respect and that tone of bearing which is best calculated to elevate the editorial profession. A course of vituperation and detraction, towards each other, for mere differences of opinion, can surely never be necessary; and if indulged in, must be productive of results which ultimately tend to lower the standing and lessen the influence of those engaged. In this manner, it is to be regretted, has the character of our newspaper press been greatly injured, and its influence paralized. It can be elevated only by manifesting a higher regard for truth, and by inculcating and practising a more gentlemanly tone of bearing among its conductors. If editors will learn to respect themselves, and each other, as they should, then will the profession become more dignified, honorable, and influential—and not till then.\n\nI offer, sir, as a sentiment -\n\nA Free Press—Free from Licentiousness, and unpurchaseable. Free institutions. Equal and just laws, free from partial and grinding acts of monopoly. A free people—free to enjoy their own opinions in politics and religion, unfettered by political or spiritual domination\n\nCol. Follett, of Batavia, being called upon, remarked that he had recently prepared a sketch of the press of Genesee county, and that he had exhausted himself on that subject, and should not therefore make a speech. He offered the following sentiment:\n\nBy Frederick Follett, of Batavia—Benjamin Franklin, the Sage, Philosopher and Printer: His name and his fame are coëxtensive with the limits of the habitable globe—time has not dimmed the effulgence of the one, or tarnished the lustre of the other.\n\nBy Ansel Warren, of Perry—Our Union: May her foul case (Slavery) be turned into pi, and together with her canon, balls, and all hell-ish instruments, be re-cast into rich fonts of pearl and diamond, and these re-set and imposed upon the impregnable bed of truth and securely locked in the chase of virtue, where it may produce an impression free of mackle, monk or frzar, and furnish full proof of her claim to stand as the head matter on the page of this world's history, and to a glorious and well justified form on the last great publication day.\n\nBy G. M. Dana—The Cause of Humanity: The printer has ever been found its true and zealous advocate, and while his hand can hold a stick and his arm work a press, he will never desert it.\n\nBy S. S. Blanchard, of Warsaw, editor of the Western New Yorker—The Magnetic Telegraph: The wonderful invention of the age; perfectly enigmatical to ordinary minds. The world is indebted to him whose natal day we have met to celebrate, for the astonishing discovery of bringing lightning from the heavens, and to the inventive genius of Prof. Morse for its incomprehensible adaptation to the purposes for which it is now used.\n\nBy C. W. Dibble, editor of the Dansville Whig—The Members of the Craft present to-night: The greatest assemblage of intelligence and public opinion Rochester ever had the honor to entertain.\n\nBy E. S. Palmer, Angelica—Editorial Courtesey: May editors remember that courtesey demands of them kindness and urbanity in their editorial intercourse. Let them, therefore, sheath the dagger, (†) and differ, as differ they must, like gentlemen who know each other to be honest but not unerring.\n\nMr. Dana, of Ithaca, here favored the company, at the request of the President, with a song, in excellent style.\n\nEverard Peck, Esq., prefaced bis excellent, sentiment with the following remarks:\n\nMr. President and Gentlemen:—It will not, I hope, be deemed inappropriate to the joyous occasion which has convened us together this evening to call up interesting remembrances of those who in this part of the country have, within the recollection of many who are present, been associated with the Press.\n\nAs the publisher of a Newspaper for several years, I had an opportunity of being acquainted ​with a large number of Printers, some of whom have gone to their last resting place, while others are occupying stations of influence in the world. Among the most prominent of those who assisted in conducting or printing the Rochester Telegraph, was a gentleman whose early history bears a striking resemblance to that of the illustrious member of the craft whose memory we have met this evening, to honor. Both were cast in their boyhood upon their own resources, and both alike struggled manfully and successfully with poverty, and its trials and difficulties. It was an incident in Franklin's life, which every printer's boy knows, and which will never be forgotten, that he trundled his paper on a wheelbarrow, from the warehouse in Philadelphia to his printing office. I have known the individual whose name I will present to you, carry bundles of newspaper to his place of business, which none but a stalwart man whose limbs had been inured to labor, could shoulder. More than this; I remember to have seen him, when he first came to Rochester with his small and dependent family, carry in his arms from the Carpenter's shop to his obscure dwelling place, a table, of which essential article it was till then destitute; and more than all, though I saw him daily, and knew him intimately, I never heard him repine at his hard lot, or complain of his misfortunes.\n\nIn the success of a man who possessed talent and intellect that raised him afterwards to important State offices, and of which he need not have been ashamed if he had, like his honored fellow craftsman, been called to \"stand before Kings,\"—who submitted with so much philosophy to circumstances of trial and difficulty in which he was placed,—in the success of such a man I say, I have always felt a deep interest, and such examples, may, I think, be held up for the imitation of young printers, who expect to carve their way by their own exertions \"to fortune and to fame.\" I give you\n\nThurlow Weed: Formerly Editor of the Rochester Telegraph, afterwards State Printer, and now Editor of the Albany Evening Journal.\n\nThis sentiment, it is hardly necessary to remark, was received with enthusiastic applause.\n\nWilliam S. Falls, Chairman of the Committee of Arrangements, being called on, remarked:\n\nMr. President—It has frequently occurred to me, that, after all, the great Typographic Brotherhood of this Nation have not, as fully as was befitting, appreciated the virtues, intelligence, and worth of their Immortal Patron—Benjamin Franklin—the good man and Printer, whose natal day we have met to commemorate. Had this been the case, would not the monumental slab indicate the fact? 'Tis true, sir, it may be said, his name occupies a position so prominent on the temple of Fame, and his memory is so indelibly engraven upon the hearts of his countrymen, that further mementos would be unnecessary. Yet, as fellow-craftsmen in the \"Art preservative of all arts,\" ought we to tolerate this objection, and permit the consideration to rest here?\n\nWe are happy to know, that the skill of the artist has frequently been brought into requisition in order to place before the view of succeeding generations, the statue of our beloved Washington, whose memory is also cherished and revered by every true American? Is not the memory of Franklin to the Printer, what that of Washington is to the Soldier?\n\nThese thoughts, sir, have been more especially suggested, from reading in a recent publication, the following:\n\nfranklin's grave.\n\nFranklin lies buried in the church-yard, corner of Fifth and Arch streets, Philadelphia, where an obscure stone, bearing his name, half obliterated, marks the spot. The Philadelphia Printers appear to have forgotten him. It is not alone, the Printers, however, but the whole city that is chargeable with gross negligence and ingratitude, in allowing his resting-place to go unmarked by a single monument. It appears that an obelisk was erected to his memory in Boston, in 1827, on the spot where repose the remains of his parents. The monument, we learn from the Transcript, is of granite, 27 feet in height and 7 feet base. In front is the name of Franklin in large bronze letters, and below it is a tablet of bronze, 32 inches long and 16 wide, sunk in the stone, on which is engraved his original inscription, upon the marble tablet which he placed there nearly a century ago. It is well known that Franklin wrote his own epitaph: we give it here, as it may be new to some of our readers:\n\nBefore submitting the sentiment which I wish to propose, I would respectfully ask: Would not the Printers of Western New York, so generally represented here this evening, esteem it a privilege to participate in the erection, in such place as shall hereafter be designated, of an appropriate memorial to the memory of him whose fellow-craftsmen we are proud to be? I submit the question, for the consideration of the members of the Profession, trusting that, on the gathering of the Craft, at our next Anniversary, they will be prepared to act in reference to the subject in question:\n\nFranklin, the Printer: His name and memory should be alike endearing and sacred to the members of the Profession in this Republic.—May his fellow-craftsmen in Western New York ​manifest their appreciation of the worth and virtues of their great Prototype, and perpetuate his memory by the rearing of a suitable column, and thus exhibit to the world, that they have not \"forgotten him.\"\n\nBy J. M. Patterson—Printers' Daughters: A pictorial edition of the book of nature. May they be bound (not in calf) but with the silken cord of love.\n\nBr H. L. Winants—Our Country: The brightest upon which the sun sheds its rays. Its present position as the * on which the nations of the earth are looking with! was only secured by dealing out to its former boss more leaded matter than he could justify in his form.\n\nJ. A. Hadley, of the Committee of Arrangements—The Mexican War: An attempt on the part of the foremen and jours of two neighboring offices to knock into pi the forms of each other. If a period can be put to the work, without the further battering of head lines or squabbling of columns, none but the devil will interpose bis opposition.\n\nBy A. Mann, (for a lady)—The Press: With its thousand tongues it proudly defies the ravages of \"Old King Time,\" and flourishes, and shall continue to flourish, with undecayed moral beauty and magnified power. While the most potent must submit to its mandates, the weak acknowledge its protection.\n\nBy J. E. Morey—Woman: The illuminated edition of a standard work, set up in pearl and bound in muslin. May she be locked up in the embrace of kindness and her form never be battered by man.\n\nBy D. D. T. Moore—The Plough and the Press: The main-springs of physical and mental life and improvement. May they ever be accompanied with sharp points and rich banks, and those who guide them possess sufficient skill to produce good register and an abundance of quoin.\n\nBy Geo. T. Frost—Clergymen Printers: Clear forms, exhibiting neither monks nor friars.\n\nBy J. W. Benton—Benjamin Franklin, Printer: The star of the craft without a parallel, who though poor, afforded the use of a \"golden rule\" for his guide. May the same rule glitter upon the works of each of the craft\n\nBy A. Bennett—Printers' Festivals: The daily occupation of the craft is a feast of reason. It is but right they should enjoy, once a year, a flow of soul.\n\nBy Isaac Butts—[Editor of the Daily Advertiser]—The Printers of Oregon and California: The first of a race who are destined speedily to diffuse the blessings of a republican civilization through vast regions yet unreclaimed from the primitive sons of the forest.\n\nH. Cook, of the Daily Democrat—Our Absent Brethren: The loss is mutual; ours the pleasure of pressing their ☞s; theirs a fat take.\n\nBy E. Scrantom—formerly an apprentice of A. G. Dauby—My own Case: The Master Printer who filled it, is with us to-night, at the head of the column.\n\nProf. Webster, formerly Editor of the American Medical Recorder, Philadelphia, then addressed the assemblage in the following language, and wound up with a sentiment:\n\nMr. Chairman—In rising to offer a sentiment, it is not my intention to trespass upon much of the time which can be so much better occupied by others; but as the sentiment I shall propose brings with it a series of historical reminiscences, it is hardly proper for me to restrain a few remarks.\n\nWhen we take a glance through the long vista of past ages, we see that even from the very dawn of creation to the present day, the solemn—the emphatic warning given in the Garden of Eden has hung heavily npon the memory of man—\"Dust thou art, and unto dust thou shalt return.\" We trace too in legible characters the history of individuals and of nations swept down before the scythe of time, and we cherish the legacy of intellect which they have bequeathed to us, whilst we are ever ready to acknowledge our indebtedness by keeping alive the memories of the benefactors of our race.\n\nIt is a pleasing task to turn over the historic page; to examine the records of ages past, and to dwell in fancy among the sages of former times. We are thus able to trace the most important eras which characterize the march of science and of art, and thus to award just meed of praise where due.\n\nIt is not my intention, however, to go back to the earlier periods of history. Rome, in her palmiest days, either as a republic or an empire, throws no light upon my subject She had her Tacitus for her historian—her Cicero for her orator—and her Virgil, Lucretius, Horace, Terence, and Juvenal, for her poets. At the fall of this proud mistress of the world, a moral darkness overspread the fairest parts of the earth; her language became corrupt; the sciences were neglected; the voice of wisdom and the splendors of poetry were either restrained, or prostituted to the meanest purposes, and liberty was altogether lost. The northern barbarians who rushed with the impetuosity of a torrent upon this once formidable empire, extinguished the last spark that glimmered on the confines of science, and the shock which produced this effect vibrated through centuries. A universal mental desolation followed—the successful impostor from Arabia affected to despise learning—his schemes were those of ambition—ignorance in his followers was necessary to his purpose. A heaven of sensuality was opened to their view, to which they were to float through oceans of human blood. The liberal sciences were not only discarded, but death was the doom of the student. But when, after this dark and gloomy period, the barbarous models of the middle ages were put aside, and the noble languages of antiquity revived, learning once more reared her head from beneath the pressure, and the votaries of science continued to march onwards conquering and to conquer.\n\nAfter the taking of Alexandria by the Arabians, learning fled the temple; the energies of mind seemed paralized; science and the arts drooped under the influence of barbaric sway, and it was ​leng ere the sun of science emitted a single ray of light to illumine the surrounding gloom. At length the returning warriors of the Crusades brought with them into Europe, a knowledge of Arabian literature; the fetters which so long had bound the genius of Greece were broken, and the revival of learning followed.\n\nIt is no part of my intention to follow the events which transpired between the Crusades of the 11th and 13th centuries, nor for a period long after; my object being principally to recall your attention to those which occurred in the 15th century of the Christian Era; and in so doing I shall endeavor to be brief, without, however, a strict regard to chronological order.\n\nMark a small portion of the history of this century, and what a spectacle do we behold to gladden the heart of the patriot and the philanthropist? We have arrived at that period when, by the adventurous spirit of a solitary individual, a new world was opened to view. The genius of Columbus presided at its birth; and where then the war whoop of the savage resounded through the stately forest, we now see the standard of science waving proudly with the flag that indicates its national existence.\n\nA new and powerful impulse was given to the progress of literature and science on the taking of Constantinople by the Turks in the middle of this century, when the learned men were forced to seek an asylum on the classic soil of Italy; it was the era which gave a Joan of Arc to Orleans, and marked the expulsion of the Moors from Spain.\n\nBut we roust pass over these and other interesting incidents of the period, to bring to your notice that invention which stamps the 15th century as the most important era in the annals of the world. To John Gutenberg of the town of Mayence, in Germany, we are indebted for the discovery of the Art of Printing by moveable types. Wherefore, however, need I attempt to point out the results which have followed this invention, when they are so familiar to all of you? Look at its influence in our own and other lands, and we shall find that, from the moment when the Pilgrims of New England, lauded at Plymouth in 1620, in the hope there to enjoy that liberty of conscience which they were debarred in the homes of their ancestors, this powerful engine has accumulated strength with each succeeding year; it has illumined the darkness of heathen lands; it has spread the genial rays of truth and knowledge to the remotest corners of the earth; it has given to almost every man in this western hemisphere the privilege not to choose his ruler, but to select the servant of his will; and if the signs of the times are not deceptive, the period is not very remote, when not a vestige of feudal tyranny will remain, and when we shall see, through the instrumentality of this mighty lever, even a world regenerated and disenthralled.\n\nAs the boundaries of knowledge were thus enlarged, a spirit of inquiry was imbibed, a powerful stimulus was given to exertion, and the human mind emerged from the eclipse which it once suffered, and again reflected the image of the divinity whence it emanated. This period, then, we mark as the most interesting and important in the history of the world; by one mighty effort of intellect, we see the shadows which had so long hung over the paths of the sons of science removed forever; we see improvement traveling in the car of time, and in the few generations which have followed, we trace a succession of the most brilliant discoveries ever announced for ameliorating the condition of the human race.\n\nBut I must forbear further remarks, and conclude by offering as a sentiment,\n\nThe memory of John Gurtenberg: His epitaph is stereotyped on the intellect and the heart of the whole civilized world.\n\nMr. C. G. Palmer, of Rochester, after raising the curiosity of the audience to a very high pitch, by the following remarks, ended with a sentiment that drew forth uproarious applause.\n\nIn rising to propose a sentiment, Mr. President, I beg leave to vary somewhat from accustomed usage. Instead of paying the usual homage to our chosen rulers, or offering an oblation to the memory of some giant mind of a by-gone age, who has contributed to the developement or progress of our art, (both of which have been, or will be, better done by others,) I wish to pay a passing tribute of respect to one who, in a more humble sphere, and in a more silent way, has benefitted the press of our country. The personage whose health I would propose, is, perhaps, but little, known in political circles, or to the great mass of the people. But to very many of those connected with the press he is well known, and his sterling worth appreciated. He is known to them by the efficient and timely, if not extensive aid, he has rendered to the newspaper press,—and has endeared himself to them by the modest and unostentatious manner in which that aid was given. Displaying thus an enlightened and discriminating liberality, it might be expected he should be known,—as, indeed, he is,—as a genuine philanthropist—an ardent advocate for the largest liberty, and a warm friend of universal education; and consequently the friend of an enlightened, efficient and independent press, as contributing to those ends more powerfully than any other single means. It is true, he has rarely interfered to suggest literary or political reforms in the press,—believing that editors are a thinking as well as a writing fraternity; and that when reforms or improvements become necessary they will be as apt to perceive it as he. But, in the war which printers have to wage against vice, ignorance and prejudice, he has directed his energies mainly to the supply of their \"commissariat\" department—well knowing that without those \"sinews\" this war can be no more successfully prosecuted than any other. It is in this way principally that he has given that essential aid to the press, for which myself, as well as many others who have been engaged in newspaper publication, hold him in grateful remembrance. Those now connected with the press, and still receiving tokens of his favor, might, perchance feel a delicacy their patron in this ​public manner. But having myself been for some years disconnected with the press, and this its patron, I feel a freedom in here giving voice to my gratitude; and therefore, Mr. President, I propose to you\n\nThe health of the Man who pays in advance for his newspaper.\n\nC.

May its benign influence continue to spread until the whole world is regenerated.\n\nBy C. Beach—Hon. J. Q. Adams: His nation's glory; a star of the first magnitude in the intellectual and political firmanent; brilliantly has he ran his course of honor and renown. As a detached star from that firmanent may he dash from earth to heaven, where it is hoped that he may find every error of his eventful life revised, corrected and registered in the book of life.\n\nBy John Smith—Babies: Pocket editions of humanity, issued periodically, and headed with small caps.\n\nBy Charles H. Carver—Apprentices: May they make the example of Franklin their guide. By following in the footsteps of so illustrious a leader their cases will never be foul, and their conduct will be bound in the cover of virtue and morality.\n\nBy C. T.

G. Dauby, our presiding officer: He deserves our grateful acknowledgement for the ability with which he has presided on this occasion. May his case never run out of sorts, his form never be battered, nor his shadow never be less.\n\nMr. Dauby replied in a happy manner; expressing his gratitude for the honor conferred in selecting him as the President of the Festival, and bidding the company farewell, left the chamber amid the cheers of the assemblage.\n\nThe meeting re-organized, with Dr. Foote as chairman and passed the following resolutions:\n\n​Resolved that a committee he appointed to superintend the publication of the proceedings, accompanied by a history of the Press of Western New York, in pamphlet form, and to solicit subscriptions to defray the expenses thereof.\n\nThe chair appointed the following named gentlemen such committee:—Everard Peck, A Mann, H.

The \"Connecticut Gazette,\" Jan. 21, 1758; published at New Haven. Name of the publisher not given. This is a very curious specimen of typography. It was presented some years since to the editors of the Democrat, by Mrs. Corey, of Chili.\n\n2. \"Essex Gazette,\" Nov. 1, 1774; published by Samuel and Ebenezer Hall, at Salem, Massachusetts. This paper is filled with revolutionary matter.\n\n3. \"Supplement to the Essex Journal and Merrimack Packet;\" Dec. 4, 1778, containing the proceedings of the meeting in Boston which threw the tea overboard. It is about seven inches by nine, and was distributed gratuitously. Printed at Newburyport, by I. Thomas and H. W. Tinges.\n\n4. \"Poughkeepsie Journal,\" of December 31, 1799, clad in mourning for the death of Washington, and containing a full account of his funeral.\n\n5. \"Columbian Centenial,\" of November 19, 1794; printed by Benjamin Russel, Boston, filled with general news of the day.\n\n6.

The music was appropriate and displayed great taste, in selection. Every sentiment, grave or gay, had its appropriate air. The presence of the Band gave additional animation to the Festival.\n\nSONG,\n\nWritten for the 141st Anniversary of Franklin's Birth Day.\n\nBY W. H. C. HOSMER.\n\n​\n\nCORRESPONDENCE.\n\nHis Honor, the Mayor of Rochester, sent in the following note in reply to an invitation to participate in the festivities of the occasion:\n\nFrom Hon. William Pitkin, Esq.. Mayor of Rochester.\n\nRochester, Jan. 18th, 1847.\n\nGentlemen—Your kind note of invitation to the \"Franklin Birth-day Festival\" was received with much gratification; and although precluded from joining in your festivities on this occasion, I sympathise most cordially in your respect for the memory of that distinguished Philanthropist and benefactor of mankind.\n\nIn political history, our country will ever boast of Washington and of Franklin, and you may well exult that one of those illustrious names stands enrolled in the catologue of your \"crafty\" fraternity.\n\nPermit me respectfully to offer the following:\n\nThe Craft—May they render due honor to the maxims associated with the name of {sc|Franklin}}, by issuing a new edition of clear proof that they are fonts only of virtuous intelligence, and of moral and political truth; then shall the imposing stone furnish a corrected impression upon the sheet of public sentiment, and register there a point of admiration!\n\nI am, gentlemen,\n\nYours, with every respect,\n\nWilliam Pitkin.\n\nTo Wm. S. Falls, Esq., and others, Committee of Arrangements.\n\nThe following Letters and Sentiments were received from the Craft abroad:\n\nFrom James Harper, Esq., Ex-Mayor of New York.\n\nNo. 52 Cliff street,\n\nNew York, Jan. 7, 1847.\n\nGentlemen:—It was with a lively sense of pleasure that I received your invitation to be present at the Festival of the Printers in Rochester, celebrating the anniversary of Franklin's birth-day, on the 18th inst. It is a gratifying honor to be remembered on such an occasion by a body of men so intelligent and so useful, and I find also a personal gratification in the reminiscence that, if I am not deceived, I worked in the same office with the worthy Chairman of your committee, some thirty years ago. If my arrangements permitted, I would gladly be with you in the body, as I surely will be in the spirit; for I love the craft, and, like all true sons of the craft, I honor and reverence the memory of him in whose name you invite me to be present.\n\nThis honor and this reverence, gentlemen, has dwelt in my mind from my earliest boyhood.—One of the first books I ever read—how well do I remember its worn-out type and coarse whity-brown paper—was a Life of Franklin; it was, in admiration of his character, that, before I had ever seen a printing press, my boyish determination to become a Printer had its origin; and for the measure of success that has attended my labor I am greatly indebted to the maxims of \"Poor Richard.\" All must appreciate the lofty fame of Franklin—the Statesman and Philosopher—but we, gentlemen, can do more than this; there is a warmer, a more genial feeling in our hearts, when we proudly recall the name of Franklin, the Printer.\n\nI beg leave to propose the following as a sentiment for recognition in your festivity:\n\nThe noble Craft of Franklin: With a child's toy he gathered fire from the clouds; but his mighty engine of the Press spreads abroad the fire and light of truth, dispersing the clouds of ignorance and error.\n\nWith the highest respect,\n\nI remain yours, truly,\n\nJames Harper.\n\nTo P. Canfield, &c., Committee.\n\nFrom Samuel Bowles, Esq., Editor and Proprietor of the\n\nSpringfield Gazette.\n\nSpringfield, Mass., Dec. 2, 1846.\n\nTo the Committee of Correspondence for the celebration of Franklin's Birth-day, at Rochester.\n\nGentlemen:—It would give me great pleasure to accept your kind invitation, and attend the celebration of the anniversary of the Birth-day of Benjamin Franklin, if circumstances should permit; but if I am not with you in person, I shall be with you in spirit. I should much enjoy an interview with so many of my fellow craft; with some of whom I am personally acquainted. The Chairman of your Committee is an esteemed friend, with whom I worked at press in early life, and in whose company I have spent many instructive and happy hours.\n\nNothing can be more appropriate than a Printers' celebration of Franklin's Birth-day. Though most of his life was spent in the public service, in eminent and highly responsible stations; though distinguished as a Patriot, Philosopher, and a man of Science, he never lost his first love for the Typographic Art: and to his latest day, showed that he enjoyed the sight and operations of a Printing Office. Till near the close of his life, he was a patron of the Art. He was indeed a paragon in our profession, and we cannot find a better model. It is as a Printer and Editor that I revere the character of Franklin, as much as in any other portion of his life. In that capacity he loved as well to guide the rays of mind, as he did afterwards, when a Philosopher, to guide the rays of lightning.\n\nYon have done well and deserve the thanks of the Typographic Brethren, for arranging a ​celebration of this kind, in Western New-York, where many of the Printers are Sons of New England; and I trust the time will come when this anniversary shall be regularly celebrated in the city of Franklin's Birth, and the scene of his first labors; for no where else on earth can it be done with more propriety than at the old American fount of Printing, of Science, and of sound principles.\n\nOn such occasions, it is customary to allude to one's own history and experience. My life, thus far, has been devoted to our profession. Five years an apprentice—one year a journeyman—and more than twenty-seven years in the business of editing and publishing a newspaper. Eleven years of my labors were passed in Connecticut, and the remainder in this Commonwealth, the home of my ancestors. Though not an old man, I happen to be one of the oldest in the profession now in service in Massachusetts.\n\nDuring the time that many of us have been connected with the business, we have seen many of our patriarchal brethren pass away from among us,to their long home. Isaiah Thomas, Benjamin Russeell, George Goodwin, Jesse Buel, Zachariah Poulson, John Lang, and many other stars of the American fount, have set—leaving us their character and examples for our imitation and benefit. We have seen the business keep pace with the rapid improvement of the Arts in the country. Great and rapid improvements have been made in the facility and execution of our works, especially that of the Press. Newspapers have quadrupled in number, and their circulation has become like the leaves of the forest in autumn. While we are conscious that the Press has been instrumental of immense good, in the spread of general intelligence, and enlightening the public mind, it is to be regretted that its moral character has been too often stained by corrupt and unworthy hands.—It is a mighty engine, for weal or woe, and would that all those who direct it, had a higher sense of their responsibility. As the first production of the American Press was the Freeman's Oath, so should it labor unceasingly to protect and defend the Freeman's Rights—to elevate his mind and improve his morals.\n\nI submit the following sentiment:\n\nThe Printing Press—May those who direct it, ever he faithful to the People's rights—to the principles of Virtue and Morality—to Truth—to Independence of action,—unaided by power, and uninfluenced by gain.\n\nWith my best wishes for your health and prosperity, accept assurances of sincere respect and regard.\n\nSamuel Bowles.\n\nFrom James R. Trumbull, of the Hampshire Gazette Office.\n\nNorthampton, Mass., Dec. 12, 1846.\n\nMr. Canfield and Gentlemen of the Committee:\n\nSirs—Yours of Nov. 9 was duly received. In reply, I forward the enclosed communication, which is at the disposal of your Committee.—Please forward an account of your celebration.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\nJas R. Trumbull\n\nWith the day that gave birth to the invention of Printing, dawned the brightest era the world ever saw. It broke upon the midnight darkness of the fifteenth century, like morning from a densely clouded sky. Its course was onward, destined, like the sun, to irradiate in its progress the whole habitable globe; yet more silent than twilight's gathering tints. Year by year, it increased.—Three centuries have rolled away since its introduction, and now it is the mightiest agent for weal or wo in existence.\n\nThe discovery of this art ranks third among the greatest events the world's history records. Its superiority consists in the immense difference between mind and matter. He who gave to the iron steed its panting breath, or he who drew down Heaven's own lightening and guided it along the wiry track, claims no partnership in Fame's award with him who placed the printed page before the mind. The inventions of others, in their greatest perfection, act only upon the ontward, the mortal man; while that of Faust operates upon the divine, the immortal, the soul. To it belongs the task of elevating the noblest part of humanity,—the intellect,—that which raises man above the brute, and renders him but \"little lower than the angels.\" So great are its advantages that it seems a drop from the overflowing cup of God's goodness, bedewing the earth, yet so tainted by sinful human nature, as to retain scarce an element of its original character. Never, since from chaos sprang this beautiful world, has there existed a power capable of such illimitable control over the passions of men. Like the irresistible music of the fabled Syrens, it lures the unsuspecting upon the quicksands and into the whirlpools of life, or, like the demi-gods of old, with brazen club uplifted, attacks vice in its strong holds, crushing with resistless force the monster's hydra heads.\n\nConsecrated in its first efforts to the cause of morality and religion, the Press holds no second place among the great renovating agents of the world. One of the first books printed was from the manuscript of the amanuensis of the Holy Spirit. Commencing with the greatest of books—the Bible—it has spread throughout the civilized world, alike instrumental in extending both religion and vice. Scarcely had the invention found an existence, ere it became mainly efficacious in perfecting one of the most beneficial reforms the world ever witnessed.\n\nWhilst this noble art was slowly spreading itself throughout Europe, a little barefooted boy was seeking his daily food, in a city of Germany, by singing from house to house. In subsequent years he entered the monastery. In the secret recesses of the Dominican cloister, was matured that mind, whose powerful workings borne abroad upon the pinions of the press, shook to its very ​centre the throne of the Caesars, drove the minions of Popery within the walls of Rome, and shook defiance at them as they stood cowering beneath the shadow of the Vatican. The true religion had become defiled. Its Omnipotent Author raised for its renovation, first the press, afterwards its operator. Had it not been for the aid of printing, the dark clouds of Popery, closing above the meteor flash of Luther's terrific struggle with the powers of darkness, would have hung with deeper gloom even now about our heads.—Dependant upon the imperfect pen of the scribe for its propagation of his writings, a single bonfire might have destroyed the slender frame-work of the reformation. But with the re-productive energies of the Press at its control, books—Phoenix-like—rose from the ashes of those burned before, and the Papal Bull, consigning the works of Luther to the flames, became the surest means of their immortality. The results of that glorious reformation, effected by the Press while yet in its infancy, will be felt at time's remotest boundary.\n\nThis great reformation was the first, but not the only achievment of the Press. It has raised the world from the midnight of heathenism to the noon-day brightness of civilization. \"But how are the mighty fallen!\" This powerful agent, degraded from the proud eminence of its youth, has become, in its crowning manhood, but a servile instrument for inflaming man's lowest passions.\n\nThe legitimate province of the Press is the formation of the literary taste of the public. Whatever reading is required by the community at large, the Printer furnishes. Those who wield the power of the Press, possess the ability to lead the minds of the people in their search after truth, or bid them grovel in the depths of licentiousness and crime. That their aim should be to elevate rather than depress, all will admit: but that the mass or reading put forth at the present day is debasing in its tendency, is equally true. Glance abroad for a moment. Crime seems to be increasing in rapid ratio. Every few days chronicle some new outrage, present to the public a further infringement of law and shows that human passion is gaining a fearfully powerful ascendency. Almost every public print brings to light some new development of human depravity. Yet the accounts of these cold-blooded murders, these heart-rending evidences of the wickedness of man's heart, are eagerly sought after, and devoured with avidity by the generality of readers. In fact, the publication of such articles has become one item, and that not a small one, of the subsistence of the newspaper press. The tendency of it is obvious. In the language of another: \"When some monstrous or unusual crime has been revealed to the public, it seldom passes without a sad repetition. A link in the chain of intellect is struck, and a crime is perpetrated, which else had not occurred.\" Thus the very reason urged, \"that crimes are published to prevent repetition,\" in the end accomplishes that which it sought to avert.\n\nSuch, then, is the present state of the newspaper press, making the everlasting misery of its readers a means of subsistence. But there is a greater and deadlier evil. Sin cloaked under the garb of holiness. Falsehood dressed in the habbments of truth. It is the world of fiction. The novels so eagerly sought after by all classes—the works of Sue, Bulwer, and a host of others. They stand before the public naked representations of the most degraded states of human society, with no plea for their recommendation except that the public taste requires them. Vitiated as public sentiment has become, it has been brought to that state in a great measure by such works published under the guise of representing the evils of society as a warning to others. Flint and steel when brought forcibly in contact, emit a spark: so \"the too close inspection of crime may grow into criminality itself.\" \"The object of the successful novel writer is to make a saleable book, and the cant about the amelioration of society is merely a trick of authors, whereby they hope to add a degree of dignity to their pages that shall gild the pill of their licentiousness.\"\n\nBeside the novels of foreigners we have authors of the same stamp among ourselves, capable of accomplishing even more evil in the limited sphere in which they move than their more gifted cotemporaries. The novelettes of Ingraham, what are they, as a general thing, but memoirs of \"her whose steps take hold on hell?\" Year after year the Press is sowing such trash broadcast over the land. The public will feast upon the demoralizing pamphlets of Ingraham, or the splendid conceptions of the more gifted Sue, and laying them aside, turn to the newly-printed Journal, yet damp, to gloat over horrid tales of seduction, murder and crime of every description. Is such a proper-state of society? Is this the grand mission of this greatest of agencies? No! the watchman has come down from his tower, and, mingling with the giddy throng, is hurrying them on to ruin and destruction.\n\nYet a reformation great as that commenced by the humble son of the miner of Mansfeldt, is required to purge our land from this evil. The renovation of the church was brought about by one of its most devoted followers, and who more appropriate to undertake this work than the Printers themselves"
