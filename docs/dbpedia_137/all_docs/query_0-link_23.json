But in 1814 or so the British Wesleyans sent some preachers to Britain to a post in Nova Scotia, at the request of the people in that area, but to the distress of the American Methodists. Over the next while more and more British Weslyans came. By 1817 there were some 166 followers of the Weslyans and about 3,301 followers of the American Methodists. By 1820 those numbers had grown to 744 British Weslyans and 5,991 Methodist Episcopals. (Oliver, 113)\n\nIn 1820 American Methodists in the Upper Canada were petitioning the American Conference to get the British Weslyans to stop competing with them. A number of them also wanted to have a separate annual conference for Canada. The former of those issues was dealt with first and an agreement was made that the American Methodists gave up Lower Canada to the British Weslyans and the British Weslyans gave up Upper Canada (with the exception of Kingston, which was a military location, and therefore had a lot of British soldiers). (Oliver 113)\n\nThe first Canadian Conference met on August 25, 1824 and a Missionary Society was formed as an Auxiliary to the Missionary Society of the Methodist Episcopal Church. By May 1827 the American General Conference decided to withdraw jurisdiction from the Canadian Methodists and in 1828 the first independent Canadian Methodist Conference met. (Oliver, 114)\n\nHowever, this separation from the American church caused some disagreement over whether the agreement with the British Weslyans still stood. The British decided it didn't stand, and they sent missionaries to Upper Canada. (Oliver, 117)\n\nIn 1833 the Articles of Union joined British and Canadian churches, making Canada a frontier of the British church. Indian Missions were not to belong to the English society. I. K. Mabindisa credits the British interest in Indian missions as having been largely because of Peter Jones, a Mississaugan missionary who made a fundraising trip to England in 1831. (Mabindisa 102)\n\nAnyway, the union of the two churches brought up more disputes and at the first conference of the Union there was a question about the ordination of local preachers. Five days after that conference ended some dissenters met nine miles North of Toronto claiming to be the legal conference of the Canadian Methodist Episcopal Church, and that those who had joined the British had actually seceded. (Oliver, 118) Because this lead to questions of ownership of church property the issue lead almost to violence and eventually went to court. Chief Justice John Beverly Robinson decided the case in favor of the Wesleyan Methodist Church. (Pidgeon, 12) Or, in other words, Chief Justice Robinson decided that the Canadian Methodist Episcopal Church had left the Wesleyan Methodist Church, and not vice versa.\n\nSo, at this point in the story, there was the Wesleyan Methodist Church in Canada, with its ties to Britain and the independent Canadian Methodist Episcopal Church, as well as several other splinter fractions.\n\nWithin the Wesleyan Methodist Church in Canada there grew up some new conflicts, some of them being over money. In 1840 the Union broke up, with the British maintaining possession of Indian Missions. Memberships to the church decreased and by 1847 they had negotiated to reunite. (Oliver, 124 - 126)\n\nIn 1840 the Wesleyan Methodists of Britain were invited into the Hudson's Bay territories. James Evans became the General Superintendent of the Wesleyan Missions in the Hudson's Bay Territories and took both Peter Jacobs and Henry Bird Steinhauer with him. Robert Rundle traveled out into the west where he worked for eight years. Benjamin Sinclair, a native teacher, joined Rundle in 1847 at Edmonton, and then established the Woodville mission at Pigeon Lake. (Dempsey, vii)\n\nIn 1853 the British Conference offered the job of the western missions to the Canadian Conference, promising to continue supporting it financially. The Canadian conference sent out John Ryerson and then Thomas Hulburt (to Norway House), Robert Brooking (to Oxford House) and Allan Salt (to Rainy Lake). Rev. Thomas Woolsey was sent in 1855 to Fort Edmonton and Pigeon Lake. (Dempsey vii - viii)\n\nSource:\n\nHeaven is Near the Rocky Mountain. Edited by Dempsey, Hugh A. Alberta.

His desire to minister to native people led him to the west coast of Canada where he arrived in Victoria in 1862 and in 1863 went to Nanaimo to take charge of an Indian school.\n\nHe traveled up and down the coast and into the interior, preaching in both native and English languages. He paddled a dugout canoe from Nanaimo to the mainland and traveled by pony and on foot for many miles. In 1869, he conducted a camp meeting on the banks of the Atchelitz Creek and from his works a church was built on land donated by Charles Evans and A.C. Wells.\n\nIn 1873, Crosby visited Ontario for a short while, then returned west, going north to Port Simpson, near Prince Rupert where he ministered for 25 years. His mission work on the coast took him north to Alaska, east to Hazelton, west to the Queen Charlotte Islands and south to Queen Charlotte Sound. Friends of his mission work provided him with a little steamboat named \"Glad Tidings\". He traveled many miles in the steamer, ministering as far south as Victoria. The \"Glad Tidings\" was wrecked while in service and was replaced by a new missionary boat named in his honor the \"Thomas Crosby\".\n\nThomas Crosby married Emma Douse in 1874. They had six children; three of whom died at a young age.\n\nReverend Crosby returned to Chilliwack in 1899 and retired to Vancouver in 1907.\n\nWall Street Methodist Church - Brockville\n\nInterior of the Georgetown Methodist Church early 1900's\n\nMethodist New Connexion Church of Canada 1829-1874\n\nThe \"Methodist New Connexion\" was the name given to the first accession from the Wesleyan Methodist Church in England in the year 1797, under the leadership of Alexander Kilham. Their Mission in Eastern Canada was begun in 1834 or 1835.\n\nThe \"Canadian Wesleyan Methodist Church\" originated in 1829, under the leadership of Henry Ryan and James Jackson, who seceded from the Canadian Methodist Episcopal Church. In the year 1840 the Methodist New Connexion Conference in England sent out to Canada the Rev. John Addyman, whose special mission was to establish a Mission in Western Canada. Through his instrumentality a union was formed in 1841 between the Canadian Wesleyan Church and the New Connexion Church in Canada East, under the name of the \"Canadian Wesleyan Methodist New Connexion Church,\" and the first united Conference was held in Cavan in June 1842. In 1843 the union was further enlarged by the admission of the \"Protestant Methodists\" of Eastern Canada. In 1864 the words \"Canada Wesleyan\" were, by resolution of Conference, dropped from the name and hereforth it was called \"The Methodist New Connexion Church in Canada\".\n\nGlossary - Church Terms\n\nChairman: The presiding officer of a Methodist district meeting or presbytry in the United Church\n\nCircuit: The field travelled by an itinerant; in the United Church called a pastoral charge\n\nCircuit-Rider or Saddle-Bag Minister: Names applied to early Methodist preachers who, on horseback with leather pouches attached to their saddles, travelled lengthy circuits.\n\nConference: A body of ministerial and lay representatives of the pastoral charges within the juristiction of the conference, having administrative and judicial functions, and meeting annually.
