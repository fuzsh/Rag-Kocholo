Also commonly with certain verbs (formerly sometimes without preceding article), as to read service, to say service, to sing service.\n\nThe interpretation of quot. lOE is not entirely clear. It refers to the participation of bishops in the ceremony of consecration of a fellow bishop; the use of a prescribed ritual may be merely contextually implied, in which case the quotation may be better placed at sense I.3. The bishops' participation is furthermore described as being in obedience to the summons of the presiding archbishop; it is therefore also possible to interpret service as here being closer in meaning to sense II.8a, although this seems less likely.\n\nIn quot. a1470: funeral obsequies (attested only in to give a person (his) service).\n\nÞa gewraðede hine se arcebiscop Landfranc & bebead þam biscopan ðe þar cumene wæran be ðas arcebiscopes Landfrances hæse þa serfise to donde, & eallan þan munecan, þæt hi scoldan hi unscrydan.\n\nAnglo-Saxon Chronicle (Parker MS.) anno 1070\n\nÞo come þe maistres..þe seruise for to do And þo hit was to ende ibrouȝt and þe bodi ibured .\n\nOxf.
