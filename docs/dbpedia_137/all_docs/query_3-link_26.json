        "text": "Hello, My name is Kimleng. I was born in TakÃ©o Province, along the border with Vietnam. TakÃ©o is sometimes referred to as â€˜the cradle of the Khmer civilization. In 2000, I moved to Siem Reap, to work as a tuk-tuk driver. Over time, I met many professional photographers from around the world, people who were seeking something more unique and authentic than the well-worn tourist trails. I developed a series of tours throughout Angkor that catered to their particular interests. My curiosity grew as I watched these photographers at work, and I began to practice photography myself. Since 2005, I have been tutored by a number of Western tutors, and have gone on to establish myself as a well-known professional photographer in Cambodia.\n\nI would very much like to share my expertise in both photography and the temples with you. Whether you are a complete beginner shooting in auto or a seasoned photographer, I can assist you. I can show you the best locations, away from crowds, and give you tips on how to capture the magnificent images of my beautiful country. I am happy to help you with settings, compositions, and lighting and I guarantee that anyone who comes to me shooting in auto, will leave using manual or semi-manual modes! I want you to go home not with touristy photos, but with beautiful authentic images to enhance your happy memories of Cambodia.\n\nYou will see when you visit, that Cambodian people do not understand that plastic rubbish does not simply go away. You will see rubbish everywhere â€“ it is a real problem, especially plastic. During covid, when no tourists could visit, we had no income and schools were closed and I knew I needed to help teach local kids English if they are to ever get a job. I also knew I wanted to educate locals about rubbish, so I charged the kids in â€˜rubbishâ€™ to come to school. I set up Rubbish School. And the BBC made a short film about Rubbish School!!\n\nWhen you tour with me, I donate 15% of my wages to help fund Rubbish School.\n\nThank you and I look forward to sharing Siem Reap with you. ðŸ™‚\n\nBunthan\n\nBorn in a village 25 kilometers from Angkor Wat (the largest religious structure in the world), education was not a priority. My parents made the huge decision to send me to city for a better education and opportunity. Stepping into the city, I realized becoming a tour guide was my dream job. To archive this goal, I work diligently to study the history and master relevant languages especially English.\n\nAfter completing my education, I work in the Tourism industry where I gain much experience tailoring tours to satisfy the need of the travelers. As a license tour guide, I have planned and guide visitors from all over the world for over a decade. Along with the knowledge of the history of my country. I am also a professional photographer who study the top photographer in Cambodia. I would love to share my visual perspective to the world, especially my guests. Join me for the unforgettable experience packed with the history and culture of my country, Cambodia. Leave with wonderful photos that will preserve your memory for a lifetime."
