        "text": "In early days a Methodist Missionary was quite a curiosity, the preaching of the itinerant Missionaries attracting congregations drawn from miles around. For many years, service was held in the log cabins and under the shade of the spreading forest; thus were the foundations of the church laid, which through successive generations has kept pace with the civilization and progress of the country.\n\nThe early Methodists were especially equipped for evangelistic success with a strong organization that went along with the passion - emphasis on lay preaching, camp meetings, organized in circuit or a series of communities linked together under one or two preachers, all under the broader umbrella of a conference or authorizing body.\n\nNote: Includes information from the Christian Guardian newspaper 1919-1925. There are over 1,500 Methodist ministers listed here from all of the different conferences and types of Methodism.\n\n| A | B | C |D | E | F | G | H I J | K L | M | N | O | P Q | R |S | T | U V | W | X Y Z |\n\nA\n\nABBS, George was born in 1823 in England and died in 1904.
