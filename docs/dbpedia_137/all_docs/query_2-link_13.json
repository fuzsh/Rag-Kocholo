        "text": "Summary\n\nWarehouses and offices, built 1884 for Matthew Whitfield, wholesale grocer. Converted into a mineral water works, c1900.\n\nReasons for Designation\n\nStandidge Buildings, built 1884, is listed at Grade II, for the following principal reasons:\n\nArchitectural interest * Distinctiveness: the building is a good example of a small-scale, late-C19, urban courtyard warehouse complex, built in brick with a good-quality terracotta office frontage; * Completeness: a little-altered integrated courtyard warehouse complex that remains largely intact; * Design: the plan form and appearance reflects the specific function the complex was intended to fulfil.\n\nHistoric Interest * Association with the Temperance Movement: built as a wholesale grocers warehouse for the storage of and distribution of goods within the City of Hull, its conversion into a mineral water bottling works reflected the substantial late-C19 and early-C20 demand for aerated waters, particularly by the Temperance Movement in this strongly Nonconformist city.\n\nHistory\n\nStandidge Buildings were built as a speculative development on part of the site of Dossor’s Brewery in 1884, for Matthew Whitfield, a wholesale grocer who had offices in Bishop Lane. The buildings were probably named after Sir Samuel Standidge (1725 – 1801), who had held the offices of both the Mayor of Hull and the Sheriff of Hull. The building was restored in November 1889 after it suffered a fire which destroyed much of the interior woodwork. The depiction of the property on the 1891 1:500 and 1893 1:2,500 Ordnance Survey maps, suggest that the complex once extended S as far as Bishop Lane, but by the 1910 map edition the extent had been reduced to the present plan. In 1893, it was occupied by Harker and Co, importers of mats and bags, and Revell and Co, bookbinders. Around the turn of C20, the property was obtained by James Hindle and Co Ltd, wine and spirit merchants, ale and stout bottlers, and aerated water & cordial manufacturer, whose trademark was the Wilberforce memorial.\n\nIn 1924 the company had become the agents for the sparkling fruit drink Vimto. The 1925 Goad fire insurance map indicates that the complex consisted of a courtyard enclosed by a store, a bottling house, a bottle washing room with a store over, and an office block with a central cart entrance and an empties store above. During the 1920s, the company’s fortunes declined and on Tuesday 19 November 1929, an announcement was placed in the Hull Daily Times indicating that the business had been bought by another aerated water manufacturer: Robinson and Speight Ltd of 15-18 Blackfriargate, Hull. The production and bottling of aerated water came to a close in 1935, when the owners opened a modern bottling plant at their works in Blackfriargate. The buildings were sold at auction on Thursday 28 November and were subsequently occupied by a number of businesses including, Messrs Peter Cassidy, Ltd, lifting equipment, and Messrs Gasschalk and Austin, solicitors. The pulley beam attached to the main elevation of building functioned as a business sign for Messrs Peter Cassidy, Ltd, who eventually transferred their business to Leeds in 1961. Standidge Buildings are currently (2017) occupied by a lighting supplier.\n\nDetails"
