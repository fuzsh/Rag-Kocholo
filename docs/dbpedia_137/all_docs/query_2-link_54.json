The committee decided to use articles which spoke more graphically of their periods than those written today as the chronological base for the history, and to enlist the aid of a number of people in researching and writing in the areas in which they were interested. The result is a collection of articles, both old and new, which supplements the earlier work, Beaufort County: Two Centuries of its History by Colonel Wingate Reed, and brings to print much data heretofore not published. Hundreds of people have been interviewed. Records, letters, ledgers and scrapbooks have been brought from attics and used. Old newspapers have been collected and consulted. Much had to be omitted but the committee hopes that further volumes of Beaufort County history will follow. Quantities of material are now available and more is constantly accumulating, which has not been touched in this volume. This material is in the files at the George H. and Laura E. Brown Library where the data used for this book is stored.\n\nThe collection and preparation of this effort has been, in large part, a community project. It is impossible to note the names of all those who have contributed, either material, pictures, advice or labor, but the help of a few must be acknowledged: Raymond M. Taylor, Marshal of the Supreme Court and Librarian of the Supreme Court Library, State of North Carolina; Lee Wallace, Jr., Historian with National Parks Services; Shirley Dunston Glover who typed and proof-read; Ethel Jensen, typist; Betsy Blount Swanner, typist and Betty Jean Brinson, typist.\n\nThe Bicentennial History Committee is composed of John Morgan, Chairman; Ysobel Dupree Litchfield, Louis May, Jill High, Daisy B.

These men, known as the Lords Proprietors of Carolina, promoted the settlement of this state. Settlers from Virginia began to push into the Albemarle region of eastern Carolina. As this area became inhabited some of the more adventurous settlers pushed southward and by the 1690's settlers had begun to appear on the Pamlico River. In 1696 the county of Bath was established and in 1705 the present Beaufort County was established as Pampticough precinct.\n\nInto the present area of Beaufort County came settlers moving up the Pamlico River and settling on the banks of this stream and its tributaries. By 1706 a town of about twelve houses and a public library had been established at Bath. In 1711 the Tuscarora Indian war brought death and destruction to the settlements along the Pamlico. Only the Lionel Reading plantation six miles below the present Washington on the south side of the river managed to survive. A garrison of troops was established there and for two or three years it marked the most westerly outpost of white settlement and the point from which expeditions against the Indians set out into the interior. With the defeat of the Indians about 1714 settlers once more began to push up the Pamlico and in 1726 a portion of the land on which Washington now stands was included in a grant of 337 acres made by the Lords Proprietors to Christopher Dudley. In the following year Dudley transferred his title to the land to Edward Salter who in turn conveyed it to one\n\nJohn Worley. Worley established a plantation on the old land grant but in 1729 he sold it to Thomas Bonner who established his home at Bonner Hill one mile north of the present Washington. At his death his son, James Bonner, inherited the site of Washington, established his residence there and it became known as Pea Town.\n\nJames Bonner soon came to realize the strategic location of his plantation for it was located at the head of navigation on the Pamlico. Beyond his plantation site it was impossible for ocean-going ships to go, as the twisting Tar filled with sand bars and snags baffled all efforts to navigate her waters. The Bonner plantation appears to have gradually increased in importance and several homes were established about the plantation. This scattered settlement appears on old maps as Bonner or Forks of the Tar.\n\nBy 1771 Bonner had decided to establish a town here, for in that year he petitioned the Colonial assembly for permission to establish a township. By 1776 James Bonner, now a Colonel in the Revolutionary militia, had completed his plans for establishing a town. He laid the town off in sixty lots with appropriate streets and sold the lots by lottery. The first town commissioners who were chosen by the lot purchasers, were Henry Bonner, Robert Salter, John Cowper and Joseph Blount. To these men in 1776, Colonel Bonner conveyed full title to the streets and to lot No. 21 which was to be for public use and to lot No. 50 as a site for a church building.\n\nThe first known reference to Washington in which the present name of the town appears, is to be found in the journal of the Council of Safety which was meeting at Halifax on October 21, 1776. The reference reads: —Resolved that Captain John Forster, commander of the armed brig, the general Washington, now lying at Washington, do proceed with all possible dispatch to Ocracock Bar and there protect the trading vessels.— It is on the basis of this brief entry that the town of Washington lays claim to being the first town named for General George Washington.\n\nBorn in the Revolution, Washington became a center of privateer activity. Such leading merchants as Richard Blackledge and John Gray Blount would fit out armed ships to cruise the Atlantic and prey on the shipping of Great Britain. The records contain numerous mention of the prizes taken by privateers arriving in Washington. In 1780 Benjamin Hawkins brought five hundred muskets to Washington from St. Eustatius where he had purchased them for the use of the Continental troops. From Washington and\n\nits vicinity came many officers and men who served valiantly and well in the struggle for independence.\n\nIn 1783 the Southern Post road which had gone from Edenton through Bath to New Bern was changed so that it now went through Washington to avoid the wide ferry crossing at Bath. Along this new route in 1783 came Johann Schoysf who was making a tour of the newly created nation and in his journal he notes that Washington has —perhaps 30 houses.— The trade of Washington he declared to be —trifling— and notes that most of the produce was carried out by New England shippers. —The chief occupation,— he says, —is the building of small ships and vessels, which are put together entirely of pine timber and sold very cheap, but they rot easily.—\n\nIn 1782 Washington was incorporated as a town by the Assembly at Hillsboro and in 1784 by act of the Assembly certain lands laid off by Thomas Respass, John Gladden and Hadrianus Van Norden, all of whom have streets named for them, were added to the town of Washington. Union Alley is the dividing line between these lands and the old Bonner property.\n\nIn 1785 on the motion of Nathan Keais, John Gray Blount, and Richard Blackledge, the county seat was transferred from Bath to Washington and a courthouse, jail, pillory and stocks were ordered erected.\n\nDuring the Confederation period of the 1780's, Washington's warehouses, which during the —Revolution had been filled with pork for the Continental forces, were filled with public tobacco which had been collected for taxes.\n\nIn 1787 William Attmore, a native of Philadelphia, visited Washington. He arrived by ship on muster day when the militia of the county gathered to drill. He found the town filled with people and many disorders and some fighting kept the authorities busy. By this time Washington had grown to about sixty families. The lots upon the river were laid out with one hundred feet front to each lot and the houses were built of wood some of which, Attmore reported, were large and convenient. To Attmore's horror there were no fire buckets in the town.\n\nBy this time Washington was developing as an important trading center. Several large wharves had been erected and sometimes as many as twenty sailing vessels could be seen lying in the harbor. From Washington a brisk trade was conducted with the upriver settlements as far as Tarboro. The goods were carried chiefly on large flats and scows which drew little water. Some of these\n\nflat-bottomed scows carried seventy or eighty hogsheads of tobacco.\n\nThe chief exports from Washington were tar, pitch, turpentine, rosin, Indian corn, boards, scantling, staves, shingles, furs, tobacco, port, lard, tallow, beeswax, myrtlewax and peas. The trade was chiefly with the West Indies and with the other states.\n\nTo the industrial life of Washington in 1787 had been added a rum distillery and Attmore remarks that —this is not likely to render the place more healthy.—\n\nDuring this period George Horn's Tavern served as the popular gathering place for the townsmen and here the visitor could receive lodging and board for about six shillings paper money per day. Here on some cold night seated about the fire in the tavern's public room could be found such leading townsmen as Thomas and Richard Blackledge, John Gray Blount, Nathan Keais, a recent settler from Rhode Island, Doctor Loomis, Colonel William Kennedy, whose home two miles above Washington was a social center, Captain John Wallace, seafarer, Mr. Arnett, the lawyer, and others of the Bonner, Whipple, Nuttle and Leland clans as well as the Grimes, father and son, and Mr. Shoemaker and the well-traveled and talkative Captain Eldredge.\n\nWithin the parlors of the homes along Water and Main streets and on the sprawling river plantations, a lucky young bachelor like William Attmore, under the sponsorship of the prominent Blackledges, could obtain a cup of tea and an interesting conversation with the young ladies of the community. There were the prim and proper Miss Grimes, the two pretty Misses Eastwoods, young Miss Sally Salter who could ride well and discuss religion until the wee hours, as well as the interesting Miss Lucy Harvey, who was to marry John Gray Blount.\n\nPerhaps a disappointment to the Washingtonians was the failure of President Washington to visit his namesake during his southern tour in 1791. There were two possible routes from Petersburg to Charleston. One was by Edenton which went through Washington and was an estimated five hundred and four miles, one by Halifax which was an estimated four hundred and sixty miles. Washington chose the shorter Halifax route and came no closer to Washington than Greenville which he called —a trifling little place.—\n\nThroughout the 1790's and 1800's Washington continued to grow and the great Blount firm composed of the three brothers, John Gray, Thomas and William conducted a thriving business. In 1790 Congress made Washington a port, and a customs house\n\nwas established in Washington about the end of the —War of 1812 with the arrival of the Fowle family from New England. Under the leadership of the enterprising S. R. Fowle, a great new mercantile house was established which continued to grow and prosper for many years.\n\nThus, by 1800, the pattern of Washington's business and social life had been set and for the next sixty years the wharves of Washington teemed with the river trade that was her very life blood.\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nTHEY FOUGHT FOR FREEDOM\n\nIn 1775 Beaufort Coutny was represented at the Congress which met in Hillsboro by Roger Ormond, Thomas Respess and William Salter. This Congress appointed the following officers to command the Beaufort County Regiment in the —Revolutionary War: James Bonner, Colonel; Thomas Bonner, Lieutenant Colonel; Roger Ormond, 1st Major, and William Brown, 2nd Major.\n\nOne hundred and twenty-five men and boys from Beaufort County walked from a starting point in Bath to New Bern to join the Revolutionary forces. Unfortunately their names have been forgotten. —Twas ever thus! Since Time began foot soldiers have been slugging it out in the mud to win the victories and suffer the defeats, while the names of their officers have gone down in history.\n\nThis, however, does not detract from the luster of the officers— names. The local Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution has located the names and most of the graves of eight Beaufort County men who served as officers in the —War for Independence.\n\nColonel James Bonner's grave in the corner of the Churchyard of St. Peter's Episcopal Church is a conspicuous local landmark. No birth or death dates are on his stone. The fact that he was the Founder of Washington is noted. Next to Colonel Bonner's grave is that of Elizabeth Bonner thought by some to be his wife. However, both of Colonel Bonner's wives were named —Mary.— The wife of his son, James Bonner, Jr. was named Elizabeth.\n\nNathan Keais, a native of Rhode Island, who was a member of Washington's first Board of Commissioners is also buried in St. Peter's Churchyard. He was a Captain in the Second Regiment of the Continental Army.\n\nIn Trinity Cemetery approximately three miles from Washington, is the grave of Israel Harding, who was a Sergeant in the 10th North Carolina Militia.\n\nSeveral miles from Washington, in the family burying ground at —Bellefont— is the grave of Reading Blount, who was born February 22, 1757, and died October 13, 1807, a Major in the Continental Army. Blount served for eighty-two months. He was cited for bravery at the Battle of Guilford Court House and again at the Battle of Eutaw Springs.\n\nColonel John Eborn is buried in the family plot at the edge of Machapungo Creek. This is located on the John Winfield plantation at Yeatesville. Eborn was born in 1742, died in 1796. He served under George Washington in the campaigns around New York and was with Washington during the winter at Valley Forge.\n\nColonel John Patton and his regiment distinguished themselves at the Battle of Kings Mountain. Patton is said to have been buried near Hill's Point. His grave has not been located.\n\nCharles Crawford was a Captain in the Continental Line. He is buried on the south side of the river on a farm formerly owned by W. J. Whitley, now the property of Texas Gulf.\n\nSimon Alderson (probably the grandson of Simon Alderson the first, who was one of the Incorporators of Bath), was the Captain of a Troop of Horse, and has gone down in history as —a daring Cavalryman.—\n\nCaleb Foreman, a Lieutenant in the 8th Regiment rests in the Old Snoad Burying Ground.\n\nThe grave of Lieutenant Richard Respess, who also fought with the 8th Regiment, has not been located.\n\nThe only Naval officer on record is John Bonner, who was born on September 15, 1746 and died on December 6, 1788. He is buried in St. Peter's Churchyard.\n\nP.M.W.\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nTHE TOWN DEVELOPS\n\nby\n\nPAULINE WORTHY\n\nIn 1775 James Bonner laid Washington off in half acre lots. Streets extended from Harvey Street to Union Alley and as far back as Third Street. The two blocks on Water Street between Harvey and Market were the first to be developed. The original streets were Water, Main (originally called First), Second and Third. These ran parallel to the river. Running northward were Market and Bonner.\n\nThe sixty lots were numbered and sold by lottery. Each lottery ticket cost five British pounds, approximately twenty-five dollars. There were no dollars at that time.\n\nIt was specified that each person buying a lot must, within two years after the close of the war with England, build on his lot one good habitable stone, brick, or frame house not less than sixteen feet square, and that it should have either a brick or stone chimney.\n\nLater, lots not sold by lottery went on sale for twice the original price and the first bought was lot 15. The purchaser was George Horn, a shoemaker. The deed was recorded on December 23, 1776 and was signed by James Bonner in the presence of John Fullin and Henry Lewcas.\n\nDuring this period when the —Revolutionary War was on, Washington was serving as a storage place for supplies for the Continental Army. A report to Congress on September 22, 1777 recorded the fact that four hundred and thirty barrels of pork and fifteen barrels of beef were stored at Port Washington in North Carolina.\n\nThe same year John Gray Blount was sent on a special mission to the West Indies to get supplies for the Army, primarily gun powder.\n\nOn his return in 1778 he married Lucy Harvey and built the sixth house in town. This house on the southwest corner of Main and Market streets was occupied by Blount descendents until progress demanded its demolition in 1923 nearly a century and a half later.\n\nIn 1782 Washington took out its incorporation papers. Two years later a part of the farm of Thomas Respess was annexed and soon thereafter some property belonging to John Gladden and Hadrianus Van Norden. Union Alley was the dividing line between Bonner's Old Part and the new lots in Respess town. It was decided that in order to keep the streets in repair residents must be taxed one shilling on every hundred pounds of property, the equivalent of twenty-five cents on five hundred dollars.\n\nBy 1785 this town had so outgrown Bath that the citizens petitioned the General Assembly to move the county seat. The Assembly, meeting in New Bern, passed an act to that effect and authorized the erection of a courthouse, a prison, a pillory and stocks. No crime or disorder was to be tolerated in this infant village.\n\nThe Courthouse was built prior to 1800 but the exact date is not on record. The act of the Assembly moving the county seat specified that the dimensions of the courthouse should be not less than forty by twenty-five feet. It also authorized Court to be held in the schoolhouse until the courthouse was completed.\n\nTradition says that a Mr. Bowen superintended the building of the courthouse and that the bricks were made in his brickyard. Wouldn't he be astonished to know that nearly two centuries later this building was placed on the National Register of Historic Places? (A list of sites and structures significant in American history.)\n\nNew Bern, now the thriving seat of North Carolina government, was amused at the pretensions of the village growing in a pea patch on the banks of the Pamlico. A few jokes were cracked along this line and this amusement was reflected in the first map of Washington which was drawn for John Gray Blount by a Frenchman named Pasteur. Using as background a military cape belonging to an officer in the British Army, Mr. Pasteur drew a plot of the town. An artist as well as a draftsman, the map maker drew in one corner a town in the clouds, painted in the center of a pea\n\npod. This perpetuated the nickname —Pea Town— which the Assemblymen at New Bern had bestowed upon New Bern's audacious little rival on the Pamlico.\n\nThe first Federal Census was taken in 1790 and population figures for Beaufort County were listed in 1791 as follows: free white males over sixteen years of age, nine hundred fifty one; free white males under sixteen years of age, nine hundred twenty six; free white females, one thousand eight hundred thirty four; slaves, one thousand six hundred twenty two; all other free persons, one hundred thirty nine; total population, five thousand four hundred fifty two.\n\nHow many of these people were actually living in Washington is not known but it is known that in 1787 there were at least sixty families within the city limits. Names prominent among them were Bonner, Blount, Keais, Blackledge, Moules and Ormond.\n\nBy 1790 the town had attained sufficient status as a port to have Congress, then meeting in New York, establish a customs house and a post office, the first post office in the United States for a Washington.\n\nPrior to this time Richard Blackledge had been serving unofficially as postmaster but there had been no regular mail service. Outgoing letters were taken to Mulberry Tavern to be entrusted to passing travelers and incoming letters were left at the Tavern to be called for. On June 2, 1790, William Groves was appointed as Washington's first official postmaster and a small post office was set up on the corner of Main Street and Union Alley.\n\nBy 1791 a fire department had been organized with a small handpumped engine plus volunteers willing to form a bucket brigade.\n\nAlthough the population was small, it held a number of different religious persuasions. All worshipped together in the Free Church on lot 50 until 1800.\n\nThere had been a bridge of sorts across the Pamlico since 1799, but in 1812 a charter was drawn up for a more substantial one. Stock was sold at twenty five dollars per share and profits were divided among stockholders. Toll rates were: five cents per person, fifty cents for a four-wheeled vehicle. Lumber and shingles were charged for by the square foot, and any commodity sold by the bushel was one and one-half cent per bushel.\n\nIn 1812, also, a pair of brothers from New England, Josiah and Luke Fowle, arrived in Washington where in time they would\n\nleave the Fowle imprint on the community. Soon they were joined by a younger brother, Sam, and in 1818 the Fowle brothers established a shipbuilding business on Castle Island.\n\nAs early as 1796 the Custom House had reported one hundred and thirty vessels entering Port Washington. These, however, were boats built elsewhere. Now in the 1820's and 30's Washington began to build her own vessels. The lumber came from the surrounding forests and the logs were cut with a ripsaw.\n\nTannyhill and Lavendar built the first sawmill and in 1831 built the Edmund McNair especially for towing rafts of logs to their own mill. Later this mill was bought by Benjamin Hanks, who as time went on owned eight canal boats which carried lumber from Washington to Norfolk and Baltimore.\n\nTurpentine distilleries developed. These were built across the river because of the danger of fire. Turpentine was exported as well as tar, pitch, pork, grain and bacon. The port products were brought down the Tar River on flats poled by slaves.\n\nAs the population increased and there was more coming and going by both water and stagecoach, there was increased demand for hotel services. Mr. Wiswall built a large frame structure with a ballroom on the corner of Main and Respess (where N.C.N.B. now stands). Here President James Monroe was entertained when he came South in 1819 on his tour of coastal defenses.\n\nWhen General Lafayette came from France on his nostalgic visit to the United States in 1825, he visited Washington and was a guest at the Lafayette Hotel.\n\nIt is probable that Lafayette came by stagecoach. Wiswall ran four-horse stagecoaches to both New Bern and Plymouth. The Plymouth road was the main road leading out of Washington as it connected with coaches going to Norfolk and Baltimore.\n\nThese coaches were drawn by four horses which were changed half way between destinations. The driver and the footman rode on a high seat up front, while the passengers rode inside. A coach could accommodate nine. The driver always came into town with a flourish, blowing his horn loudly.\n\nMail was also carried by stagecoach. Postage on a letter to New York or Boston was twenty-five cents.\n\nBy 1830 the population had doubled; according to this census, there were now ten thousand, nine hundred and forty-eight people in Beaufort County.\n\nWhat were all these people doing in addition to giving birth, going to church, burying relatives and trying to make a living?\n\nCertainly everything was not rosy. The County built a poorhouse in 1827 to care for the aged and the indigent. However, by and large, the area was prospering.\n\nThere were numerous craftsmen to provide both necessities and luxuries. When Benjamin Pyle died in 1813 and his things were sold at public auction his goods and chattels included watch and clockmaking tools and a variety of jewelry, such as earrings, finger rings and watches. In addition there was much flat silver such as lady's tea and dining spoons and sugar tongs.\n\nWhat of the furniture in Washington homes? Edward Long was making venetian blinds in 1823 as well as doing other cabinet work. Augustine Fair, a cabinet maker with a shop opposite the bridge, advertised in 1838 that he had plenty of mahogany on hand and was prepared to execute all work in his line of business.\n\nThe men gathered to discuss politics, and the fact that a Temperance Society was deemed necessary is suggestive.\n\nWhat of sports and entertainment?\n\nJohn Prime, a Washington gunmaker, advertised in the New Bern Spectator that he could make both double and single barreled guns in the best styles and that all his repairs were done in the neatest manner. So we can assume that hunting was a major sport. The James Sprunt Historical Publications say that in 1787 Rodman's Quarters was a favorite hunting ground and that Washington men would often gather there, divide into groups and go into the woods to track deer.\n\nFor ladies there were tea parties, but not with tea and sandwiches. The English High Tea was the fashion with a real supper served and men invited. For mixed groups there was square dancing.\n\nAlso there were cultural organizations such as The Literary and Scientific Circle. There was a dramatic society which put on amateur theatricals. Mrs. Phinney advertised in the American Recorder (July 16, 1819) that she would instruct young ladies in drawing, painting, gilding and embroidery. A French dancing master was giving dancing lessons in Selby's Hotel and Mrs. Cooke was teaching music.\n\nAnd so life moved along as life does in all times and places until 1843 when the yellow fever epidemic struck.\n\nMosquitoes were the carriers. They brought it from the West Indies in a cargo assigned to Lewis LeRoy, a prominent merchant. Unhappily Mr. LeRoy himself was one of the first victims. People\n\ndied like flies, as many as seven being buried in a single day.\n\nDoctors were hard put to manage. Dr. Norcom, Dr. Freeman, Dr. Shadrack Allen and Dr. Telfair were the physicians in town at that time.\n\nIn 1846 there was a smallpox scare but this did not develop into an epidemic since the patient was isolated.\n\nThere were no chronometers for measuring time. Ships used —dead reckoning— which was a lead line and an hourglass. Knots were tied in the line to measure so many feet of water. At the end of the line was a piece of lead containing a hole filled with soap. As this was put into the water the hourglass turned. When the lead touched bottom the line was drawn in and if sand was on the soap it could be estimated how many feet of water the ship was in. By the hourglass the time taken to reach bottom was estimated. A hard way to reckon longitude! Yet many successful voyages were made by —dead reckoning,— voyages to Point Petre, Guadaloupe, St. Kitts and Turks Island in the West Indies and to northern ports such as New York or Boston.\n\nNaval stores were the principal exports. However, corn was the principal crop in the county, and between forty and fifty barrels were sometimes shipped in a single year.\n\nCotton was a secondary crop. Not too much was raised in Beaufort County except by Bryan Grimes whose output was about fifty bales a season.\n\nOccasionally these returning ships brought hats or dresses for affluent ladies. There were no fashion plates or papers to indicate changes in fashion, but if a lady got a new dress she usually, with great generosity, let her friends copy it. Mrs. Sarah Quinn and Mrs. Elizabeth Orkney were the leading milliners, creating many fancy bonnets. Dresses could not be bought ready-made. Home sewing was a way of life for all women. Every garment worn by every member of the family and by every servant had to be cut and stitched at home. Short close-fitting waists and full straight skirts held out with hoops were the fashion in 1850.\n\nConversation and letter writing were the favorite avocations of both men and women. Since telephones were not available, servants carried notes from the east end to the west end of town, from mother to daughter, or from sister to sister, detailing the news of their particular neighborhoods.\n\nThere was plenty to talk about in 1845 when Henry S. Clark, candidate for Congress challenged Henry Dimock to a duel.\n\nDimock was editor of The North State Whig which, Clark claimed, had printed lies about him. Shots were fired but neither was wounded and friends patched things up between them.\n\nThe assumption is that Beaufort County had outlawed duels because both the Henry S. Clark-Henry Dimock affair and the William Kennedy-Fenner B. Satterthwaite duel were fought outside the county. Both were anti-climactic. Satterthwaite put three holes through Kennedy's hat. Kennedy put four bullets in Satterthwaite's leg and five in his coat tails before a recess was called and the matter settled by arbitration.\n\nPunctuated only by such occasional excitement, time rolled peacefully on until the nation was plunged into war. By the time Federal troops invaded Washington the town extended from the gate at —Elmwood— on Washington Street to the Bradford residence just beyond where the Baptist Church now stands. The northern limits were at Fifth. There were two main thoroughfares which were lined with giant elm trees with here and there an occasional cedar or sycamore. Streets were packed hard with crushed oyster shells. Planks along the sidewalks made walking possible in muddy weather. The population stood at three thousand, of whom few or none dreamed of the horror ahead.\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nBEAUFORT COUNTY'S CONTRIBUTION TO A\n\nNOTABLE ERA OF NORTH CAROLINA HISTORY\n\n(Selections from a series of articles)\n\nby\n\nCONGRESSMAN LINDSAY C. WARREN\n\nPrinted in the Congressional Record\n\nApril 29, 1930\n\n(Used with Mr. Warren's permission)\n\nThe county of Beaufort has always played a commanding role in the history of the Commonwealth. There have been periods when its leaders rose to great heights and left their indelible impress.\n\nSettled exclusively by the English, its trials and tribulations as an important section of the colony go hand in hand with the rebellion against colonial rule and the unconquerable desire for independence. Undaunted by the Indian massacres of the early days, which almost took her last man, the county rose nobly to the cause of the Revolution, sending more than her quota of fighting men, and furnishing from her great estates even the family plate brought from England. Two of her great public leaders stood out in these times—Col. James Bonner and John Gray Blount. The former commanded the Beaufort County Militia and was preeminent as a man and as a soldier. The latter as a boy from a distinguished family, seeking adventure, had accompanied Daniel Boone as a chain bearer in his pilgrimage to Kentucky, and during the administration of Thomas Jefferson was to become one of the largest individual landowners in America.\n\nIt was these two men who molded the sentiment and policy of the county in that early day. For the next 40 years, beginning with the accession of Jefferson, the sons of these men as well as other prominent figures came on the scene, and Beaufort County sat high in the councils of the State.\n\nThe purpose of these articles is to portray, historically correct, I trust, some of the happenings of that great era in North Carolina from 1845 to 1875 and to bring forth again those men who became dominant actors and who either lived in Beaufort County at the time or who were closely identified with it. Certainly no period in our history could be more interesting. They were the halcyon days before the war, and then the dregs and despair that followed it. Beaufort County shared in its pleasures, drank deep in its sorrows, and contributed greatly in its reconstruction.\n\nFor 40 years before the War between the States, Washington was a pleasure-loving but ambitious community. It was a port of no small repute. Out over the bar of Ocracoke Inlet to the West Indies, and northern points, when the fleet of Fowle ships carrying lumber and returning with merchandise, fruits, and molasses. Commerce teemed in the harbor and the docks were a busy scene. It was a day of large plantations, high living, fast horses, hard drinking, and political strife. The first day of court was always a gala affair, and set aside for political discussion. Any orator could get a crowd. The social reputation of the community was widely known. The people were hospitable to their hurt, and entertained lavishly. The slaves did the work. But withal, there was culture and refinement in the homes, and many of them were centers of attraction for learned people.\n\nAn outstanding event in its social life had been in 1819, when the town was visited by President James Monroe and his Secretary of War, John C. Calhoun. It was occasion for great celebration, the distinguished guests being met a few miles from town by a cavalcade of 100 citizens. Cannon boomed out the presidential salute. They were escorted to the courthouse lawn where the President spoke to thousands. That night, a dance, graced by ladies and gentlemen in resplendent dress, culminated the entertainment, Mr. Monroe taking part in the festivities and making himself most agreeable.\n\nThe town was included in the itineraries of many of the prominent men of the day, who came here to consult the great leaders and enjoy the social life. In the summer of 1836, Washington was visited by one of her native sons in the person of The Hon.\n\nChurchill C. Cambreleng. He was born here but moved to New York City at the age of 16, and subsequently engaged there in the mercantile business. He was elected to Congress as a Tammany Democrat and served for 18 years. At the time of his visit to Washington he was chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, enjoyed the friendship and confidence of Jackson, and had always been a tower of strength to him in his fight on the bank. Mr. Cambreleng spoke at Washington advocating the election of his close friend, Mr. Van Buren, but Beaufort County voted heavily against his candidate in the election. Two years later he was defeated for Congress and Van Buren thereupon appointed him as minister to Russia, where he served with great distinction. Judge Stephen C. Bragaw is one of his relatives and bears the name of his brother.\n\nA discussion of the men and measures of the age beginning in 1845 necessarily must be woven around the legal fraternity. At that time politics was an exalted profession and the bar, on account of their educational qualifications, were looked to by the people as leaders of thought and exponents of issues. For years the bar of Washington has been without a superior in the legal history of the State. The statement is made advisedly, but with knowledge of the groups that practiced there in each decade. Certainly this was true in the early fifties, when Edward Stanly, Thomas Sparrow, Edward J. Warren, William B. Rodman, Fenner B. Satterthwaite, Richard S. Donnell, and David M. Carter took their seats at the counsel tables in the same courthouse at Washington that stands today. Of this bar only William B. Rodman was born in Beaufort County. Aside from being a good place to live, there was considerable litigation in the county, and men like Stanly and Donnell forsook their native Craven and moved there.\n\nIn 1846 there came to Washington from the hills of his native Vermont a young man 20 years of age from a long line of Massachusetts ancestry. He had just graduated with distinction from Dartmouth College, founded by his maternal ancestor, Doctor Wheelock. His name was Edward Jenner Warren. The rigors of the cold northern climate had affected him and he was moved to seek a milder temperature. He was a part of that migration of young men from New England that came south in the early forties. All were graduates of Tufts, Dartmouth, Yale, or Harvard, and they settled in Elizabeth City, Washington, and in Wilmington, N. C., and in Charleston, S. C. The South was still in the\n\nprime of her importance in the life of the Nation, and these young men, some as lawyers, some as physicians, and others as schoolteachers, came seeking their opportunity and marrying into the older families. President Coolidge once told the writer that he became greatly interested in the southward trek of these able young men from his section during that period and used it as his subject when addressing the New England Society of Charleston when he was vice-president.\n\nEdward J. Warren came as a schoolteacher, finding time in his spare moments to read law, and was admitted to the bar in 1848. He shortly married Deborah Virginia Bonner, daughter of Col. Richard Bonner, a member of the council of state, long influential and powerful in affairs and the largest planter and wealthiest man in Beaufort County.\n\nHis contemporaries at the bar were: Edward Stanly, born in New Bern, and a graduate of Norwich University, possessed with all the force as well as logic that is generally given an able man. In his younger days he was hot-headed and ill-tempered and promptly met on the dueling ground a member of the House from Alabama over an imaginary insult, but which resulted in no harm to either. But in his latter days Mr. Stanly grew calmer.\n\nThomas Sparrow, likewise born in New Bern, had graduated with great distinction at Princeton, being the valedictorian of his class and receiving from that great institution both his A.B. and master's degrees. He read law under Judge Gaston, and moved to Washington and formed a partnership with Stanly. He was a profound student, and a forceful debator and orator. His appealing personality gathered men around him.\n\nRichard S. Donnell was also born in New Bern. He was a graduate of the University of North Carolina and of Yale, and was a grandson of Gov. Richard Dobbs Speight. He was a man of commanding appearance, quick and decisive in his actions, and thorough in the preparation of his cases. He was a clear thinker and went to the heart of every problem.\n\nWilliam Blount Rodman, a grandson of John Gray Blount, was born in Washington, and educated at the university. He was small of stature and rather rotund. He was a fluent speaker, possessing a concise and analytical mind and knew the history of his State such as few men did. Later as a writer of legal history he had few superiors.\n\nDavid M. Carter was nearly 6 feet tall and of large frame. He was born in Hyde County and attended the university. He\n\nhad red hair and blue eyes, and at times an ungovernable temper. When in a rage, his countenance was ugly beyond description. He was a good hater. To his friends he was as true as steel. He detested his enemies. He was as brave as a lion. He was a powerful, ruthless advocate who brooked no opposition. After the war he formed a partnership with Mr. Warren.\n\nFenner B. Satterthwaite lived just over the line in Pitt County, but practiced in Washington regularly and moved there after the war. He had a natural gift for the law. He rarely cracked a book, but depended on his commanding appearance and striking personality, his knowledge of the people, and his ability to speak. And quite successful was he.\n\nSuch was the bar of Washington in 1850. There was not a case brought in Beaufort County that these men were not pitted against each other, and at every courthouse in the eastern country where they appeared, one or more of them would arise and address his fellow citizens on the issues of the day. Warren, Stanly, Sparrow, Donnell, Satterthwaite, and Carter were Whigs, while Rodman carried the Democratic banner alone. Beaufort was a Whig county. In the earlier days it had stood by General Jackson, but it had annihilated Van Buren, Polk, Cass, Pierce, and Buchanan. Its members of the legislature had been Whigs, and the county always loyally supported Morehead and Graham.\n\nIn 1853, after five years at the bar and at the age of 27, Mr. Warren rose to great heights in his profession in the case of the State against the Rev. George Washington Carrawan, a Baptist minister of great influence, from Hyde County, owning large tracts of land and a number of slaves. He had killed a schoolteacher from Perquimans County named Lassiter, and though Carrawan's slave had aided his master in disposing of the body, his evidence was incompetent and the case was built up solely on circumstances. It was removed to Beaufort County and Messrs. Warren and Carter appeared with the solicitor, Mr. Stevenson, of New Bern, while Messrs. Rodman, Satterthwaite, Donnell, and James W. Bryan defended. Mr. Stevenson placed Mr. Warren in charge of the case, and he accordingly made the last argument to the jury. Judge Bailey presided. It will go down as one of the great criminal trials of America, consuming eight days and becoming famous on account of the arguments and the immediate happenings after the verdict.\n\nWhen the jury brought in a verdict of murder in the first degree (Carrawan had turned to his wife after Mr. Warren concluded his\n\nspeech and said, —That speech hangs me—), the prisoner, arising to be sentenced, calmly took a pistol from his pocket, aimed it deliberately at Mr. Warren, and fired. He was attired in the conventional broadcloth of the day, with heavy cardboard in the lapels of his coat. A large gold chain was thrown across his chest, holding a locket hanging just over his heart. The bullet struck the locket, caromed to his lapel, cutting out the cardboard, and, falling to the floor, left him uninjured. The shock knocked him down, but he was quickly on his feet, and in time to see Carrawan draw another pistol and kill himself in the court room. The speeches made by Messrs. Rodman and Warren in that case, outstanding for legal argument and oratorical ability, are published in a work well known to lawyers as Classics of the Bar. The complete history of the trial was written at the time by Mr. Sparrow, who did not appear. There is a copy in the Supreme Court Library, and the few that are still preserved are much sought after.\n\nIt was during this period that events began to shape themselves that unerringly pointed to secession. The eighth congressional district at that time was composed of the counties of Beaufort, Craven, Lenoir, Pitt, Greene, Tyrrell, Hyde, Washington, Carteret, Wayne, and Jones. For years it had been overwhelmingly Whig, and its leaders were standing squarely with Webster and Clay. The district was so pro-Union that the opposition to the dominant party was negligible. Mr. Stanly had served three terms in Congress with great ability, but in 1842 had been defeated for reelection. He returned home and was immediately sent to the House of Commons from Beaufort County for four terms, was speaker in 1846, and the next year was the attorney general of the State.\n\nIn 1848 he was again elected to Congress and served until 1853, Mr. Donnell, at the age of 26, having voluntarily retired after serving one term, and insisting that Mr. Stanly take the Whig nomination. The district had been taking no chance that anyone who subscribed to the South Carolina doctrine should represent it. But with the increased activity of Beecher, Garrison, and Mrs. Stowe in the North, the seeds of disunion were germinating even in conservative and Union-loving North Carolina; and the Democrats, taking advantage of the mistakes of the Fillmore administration, set about to seize the Whig stronghold, the eighth district. Mr. Stanly had previously announced his retirement at the expiration of his term but yielded to the importunities of his party and again became the candidate.\n\nMonths before the election the Democrats nominated Thomas Ruffin, of Wayne. Mr. Sparrow, as chairman of the district Whig committee, became the manager of his law partner's campaign and lost no time in launching it.\n\nIt was a great campaign. Sparrow, Warren, Carter, and Donnell took the stump for Stanly, all denouncing secession and breathing devotion to the Union. But Ruffin was elected and the Whig power in the district was at last broken. Beaufort County went for Stanly. Mr. Ruffin remained in Congress and went out when the State seceded. He was killed in one of the battles in northern Virginia. In 1853 Mr. Stanly moved to California, where he practiced law. His party having passed off the scene of action, he allied himself with the rising new Republican Party and was their unsuccessful candidate for Governor of California in 1857. North Carolina was to hear no more of him until five years later.\n\nAfter serving as Representative from Beaufort in 1858, Thomas Sparrow moved to Arcola, Ill., where, on account of his ability, a wide field of activity had been promised him, but with the war clouds gathering and feeling then the inevitability of the approaching conflict, he sorrowfully turned toward home within a year. But the lovers of the Union were not yet giving up. By this time Mr. Rodman was openly advocating secession, was writing prolifically, and making powerful speeches. Carter, Warren, Donnell, and Sparrow were making themselves heard, and wherever one spoke he was greeted with large crowds. Mr. Satterthwaite, living then in Pitt County, was quiet, but his near neighbor, Bryan Grimes, was using his great influence for dissolution. In the winter of 1861 the question of a convention was submitted to the voters of the State. The cotton states had gone out. On every stump in Beaufort County the question was argued. The people were at fever heat, but they were urged to vote down the call. Beaufort County did. And the State did. North Carolina was still in the Union.\n\nBut events were happening fast. Lincoln had made his call for troops. Virginia had seceded, and the war was already on. The next election on a convention was held. This time they were all together, all favoring it, and Beaufort County giving it a large majority along with the rest of the State. At the same time Edward J. Warren and William J. Ellison were elected as the county'sdelegates. Mr. Ellison was a Whig and strong Union man, and exerted tremendous influence in the county.\n\nThe personnel of the secession convention has been paid due\n\ntribute by the historians and writers. Certainly there has never been a greater or abler body of men gathered together in the history of the State, for in the crises North Carolina sent her best. Pitt County sent Bryan Grimes and Fenner B. Satterthwaite, Mr. Grimes reproaching his friend and neighbor, Mr. Satterthwaite, a few days before the convention assembled, because he did not seem to have the same ardor that he did. Martin County sent Asa Biggs, then a United States judge, and one of the State's ablest men. Hyde sent Edward L. Mann. Washington sent William S. Pettigrew. Northampton sent her able judge, David A. Barnes, and John M. Moody. On the vote for president of the convention, Messrs. Warren, Ellison, and Satterthwaite voted for Gov. William A. Graham, who was defeated by the venerable Weldon N. Edwards. Mr. Grimes voted for Edwards. After a few preliminary roll calls as to its form, the ordinance of secession was unanimously passed, the 115 members signing the enrolled parchment. North Carolina had gone out of the Union and then quickly ratified the constitution of the Confederate States.\n\nFor the duration of the war, at least, the old antagonists at the bar and in politics made their peace. Mr. Sparrow raised a volunteer company in Beaufort County. While stationed at Portsmouth, awaiting transportation to northern Virginia, he was ordered to take his company to assist in the defense of Fort Hatteras. He was surrendered there with the garrison, and was in a northern prison for six months until exchanged. He was then called to Fort Fisher and was made a major. When that last great fort of the Confederacy fell, he was at home on sick leave. In a small canoe he paddled alone 20 miles down Pamlico River, and never surrendered or took the oath of allegiance.\n\nOn May 16, 1861, Mr. Carter was commissioned as captain of Company E, Fourth North Carolina Regiment, and went quickly to the front. At the Battle of Seven Pines, May 31, 1862, his regiment suffered severely, and he himself received wounds that were feared fatal at the time. It was weeks before he sufficiently recovered to report for duty, and was then assigned as judge of Jackson's corps and made lieutenant colonel. Later he was presiding judge of the Third Army Corps (A. P. Hill's). He remained in the army until he was called home by his election to the legislature.\n\nMr. Rodman also raised a volunteer company of heavy artillery, which saw service in several sections. Later he was made president of a military court which held sessions in different parts of the\n\nSouth. Mr. Satterthwaite was not in the army, but gave three sons to the cause. Mr. Donnell was in the legislature during the period of the war and was elected to the convention upon the death of Mr. Ellison and also to the convention of 1865.\n\nImmediately after signing the ordinance of secession Mr. Warren was unanimously elected as captain of a cavalry company organized by his friends in the east. A similar company had been organized in another section, and it was decided to only commission one of them. Governor Clark appointed the other man, Mr. Warren always feeling that the governor had been actuated in his decision because they were political opponents. Later, when the entire convention tendered their services to the Confederacy, Mr. Warren was rejected on account of his physical condition. A brother who had remained in New England served in a Massachusetts regiment, while one who came South served in a Georgia Regiment. They faced at Chickamauga, and the southerner was killed.\n\nThe brilliant career of Bryan Grimes, who was inseparably connected with the life of Beaufort County, needs no elaboration in these articles.\n\nPART 2\n\nEdward J. Warren and William J. Ellison played important roles in the convention of 1861 and from the beginning were continuously pointing out the value of eastern Carolina to the future of the Confederacy, condemning the half-hearted efforts for its defense by the Davis government, and urging State action. Both of them actively participated in all of the proceedings and impressed the membership with their ability and courage. . .\n\nMr. Warren was elected as senator from Beaufort in 1862, 1864, and 1865. In the convention of 1865-66 Messrs. Warren and Donnell were again the delegates from the county; so they served in the dual capacity as members of the convention and as members of the legislature. He was Chairman of the Judiciary Committee during all of his terms in the senate and Mr. Donnell served in the same capacity in the house until he was elected speaker. Certainly no county in those strenuous times occupied a more powerful position in the legislative history of the State than Beaufort.\n\nFor the time being a new era began in North Carolina when on September 8, 1862, Zebulon B. Vance took the oath of office as governor, and a star of the first magnitude started its ascendency.\n\nDuring the progress of the war Governor Graham, Mr. Warren,\n\nRichard S. Donnell, Col. David M. Carter, and many others, were at times caustic critics of the Richmond government, and many of the war measures proposed both in the Confederate congress and in the legislature. They insisted upon a —vigorous constitutional war policy,— but protested throughout, both in speeches and resolutions, —against any settlement of the struggle which does not secure the entire independence of the Confederate States of America.—\n\nOn March 20, 1862, a week after the capture of New Bern by the Federals, the Twenty-fourth Massachusetts Regiment entered Washington, accompanied by a fleet of gunboats. At this time the town had been completely evacuated by the Confederates and no resistance was offered. The regimental band accompanied by several companies marched from the dock to the courthouse and raised the American flag. A banner alleged to have been placed there by citizens was stretched across Main Street, bearing the inscription, —The Union and the Constitution.— The Federal commander reported to the War Department that he had found Union sentiments among a few individuals. A garrison, consisting of infantry, cavalry, and artillery, was brought in and made permanent. A large fleet of gunboats was anchored in the river off the town. The occupation was continuous until the spring of 1864.\n\nWhen Federal occupation came, there were not over 700 people who remained in Washington, all of them being old people who were non-combatants, and a few children. The feeling was prevalent that the section was being handed over to the tender mercies of the invaders, and that the Richmond government was stripping North Carolina of her manpower for service in Virginia. The county had always loved the Union, but when the step to leave it was taken, bickerings ceased, and a united front was presented.\n\nOn March 30, 1863, the Confederates, under Gen. D. H. Hill, began the siege for the relief of the town. Unfortunately, he had no gunboats, and as a result the Union garrison was constantly relieved. The besieging force consisted of the brigades of Daniel and Pettigrew on the south side of Pamlico River, and the brigade of Garnett, of Pickett's division, upon the north side. The force under General Hill numbered about 9,000. The Confederates seized the forts below the town and held in check a large fleet of Union gunboats attempting to pass them. The Federal garrison in the town at the beginning of the siege numbered 1,500, which was increased to 2,000 when the transports ran the blockade.\n\nThe Federals marched overland from New Bern with a force\n\nof 8,000 under General Spinola, but were met by Pettigrew at Blounts Creek and driven back. Fearing to make a land assault with its consequent loss of life, the Confederates daily engaged the Union gunboats and forts, and Washington was again riddled with shells. On April 15 a large part of the Confederate forces were called to Virginia, and the siege was abandoned. Washington was to remain under Federal occupation for another year.\n\nThe brilliant feat of General Hoke in capturing Plymouth on April 20, 1864, caused General Harland, the Union commander at Washington, to receive an order to evacuate the town. On April 30 the last Federal troops, after firing the different portions of the town, embarked. The last dastardly act was setting the bridge on fire. The town was now desolate and ruined.\n\nIt is baseless calumny lodged both during and after the war that there was disloyalty on the part of the citizens of Washington to the Confederate government. It is a slander that is unworthy of denial, and though 65 years have elapsed, history is recorded truths, and there is documentary evidence to give the lie to every false charge.\n\nThe hoisting of the banner across Main Street welcoming the invading Federals can be dismissed as an act of a very few cowed and whipped citizens who felt that their government (Confederate) had deserted them. The fact that the banner was even raised by local people is not admitted, for immediately afterwards no one would take the responsibility for it.\n\nOn March 30, 1862, with the Federals in undisputed control of the town, six well-known and prominent citizens, all old men, were the guests at dinner of Captain Murray, of the U. S. gunboat Commodore Hull, lying in the stream off Washington. Every one of them had either sons or near relatives in the Confederate Army. It was a convivial affair. They pulled off a drunk that evidently required some time for recuperation. Captain Murray proposed a toast:\n\n—Here's to the reconstruction of the Federal Union, a plantation in Georgia with 100 —niggers,— and a summer residence in North Carolina.—\n\nThe Washingtonians drank to it with great zest, their liquor at that time having taken the proper effect. It is reported that the captain ordered them oared ashore and safely put to bed. This was a shocking and horrible act of disloyalty.\n\nOn April 3, Isaiah Respess, the mayor of Washington, was arrested by a raiding party and sent to Richmond by General\n\nHolmes, the Confederate commander, then at Greenville. Mr. Respess was an old man, long past the combatant stage. Faced by a court-martial, with seven charges presented against him, hundreds of miles from home, he successfully combatted them and was acquitted. Even then he was held and told that he could not return to eastern Carolina. He was accused of furnishing information to the enemy, or at least fraternizing with them. His arrest, contrary to the civil laws of North Carolina, and with a wanton disregard of his rights, caused an outbreak of widespread indignation. On May 1, Judge Badger, of Wake, arose in the convention and presented lengthy resolutions calling upon Governor Clark to make immediate inquiry and with a demand for his release. Messrs. Badger, Warren, and Graham made powerful speeches. After a debate of three days, the proceedings were terminated with a wire from President Jefferson Davis announcing the release of Mr. Respess. After the war Mr. Respess was a senator from Beaufort County.\n\nDuring the first week of May, 1862, Edward Stanly left his California home and was received at the White House by Abraham Lincoln. He was depressed and blue, for his home state, which he loved passionately, had been invaded, and both the place of his birth and that of his long residence were in possession of a conquering army. But he had a dream that his very presence there could bring peace out of destruction, and he painted to Mr. Lincoln a glowing picture.\n\nWere not Washington and New Bern, now held by the Union forces, former Whig strongholds? Had not their public men, even until the very last, suffered villification on account of their intense love for the Union? Was not this whole war brought on because the people had turned from their old and trusted leaders? What, then, would be easier, now that they were abandoned by the Confederacy, than to go down and wean and coax them back, and take them by the hand as erring brothers? And who, he argued with Lincoln, could better do this than Mr. Stanly himself?\n\nIt was no lust for office or for power that inspired Edward Stanly. Love for his old home, and for the Union, pervaded his being. He knew also that there was suffering in North Carolina, and he thought he could alleviate it. Mr. Lincoln was impressed. He felt that if he could drive a wedge into North Carolina that the war would quickly end. Just as he did not consult Congress when he made war neither would he consult that body now, and on May 26, 1862, he commissioned Edward Stanly as Provisional\n\nGovernor of North Carolina, with the rank of brigadier general.\n\nGovernor Stanly lost no time. He arrived shortly in New Bern, and spent a month conferring with General Burnside. He unfolded his plan. Idealism was to prevail. The military should play second fiddle, and there should be a minimum of restraint. In all of their acts they should play the part of the gentleman. They should fraternize freely with the citizens. No one should be called a rebel. The people should be told that they were simply misled, that the Union was ready to receive them with open arms and restore their property, including their slaves. This program had not been in effect three days before it clashed with the views of the Union general, and in ten days Stanly was complaining to Lincoln of the excesses of the Federal troops.\n\nHe then moved on to Washington, and set up his headquarters in the building occupied by the branch bank of Cape Fear. Mr. Stanly was a persistent, tenacious, and determined man. He forcibly presented his ideas and arguments to all he came in contact with, and there is no denying the fact that he made inroads on the morale of the comparatively few people remaining in Washington. He was received kindly in the town which was formerly the scene of his many triumphs, and his presence no doubt softened the occupation. He wrote letters to many of his old Whig friends in the convention and legislature, including Graham, Badger, and Warren; but they sent him word that his mission was futile.\n\nGovernor Stanly carried on a lengthy correspondence with Lincoln. He constantly protested the thwarting and overruling of his policies by the Army, was always mentioning the excesses of the troops, and complaining of their entire lack of cooperation with him. Soon Stevens and Sumner, on the floor of Congress, were interrogating the President as to —this man Stanly who is assuming to usurp the powers of the military.—\n\nThe provisional governor had accomplished nothing. Each day his disillusionment grew. On March 2, 1863, he resigned, no doubt upon the suggestion of Lincoln. He returned to California, entering into a large law practice, and was eminently successful. He died in 1872, at the age of 62, and was buried there. Edward Stanly was a great lawyer, and a wise statesman. He never lost his love and deep affection for the people of his native State. At least one of the votes for the acquittal of Andrew Johnson is accredited to his influence.\n\nThe banner incident, the social party of several old men on a Union gunboat, the arrest of Mayor Respess, and the visit of\n\nStanly, were all magnified, and mutterings were abroad that Washington was disloyal to the Confederacy. The truth is that the town and county were bled white, both of men and property, and the people displayed great stoicism and bore their sufferings heroically.\n\nParts 3, 4, and 5, have been summarized.\n\nThe war was now over, and William W. Holden was the provisional governor. North Carolina was to drink the bitter dregs for years to come.\n\nWhile no interest was taken, there was no objection to the call for a convention in 1865. Its personnel was selected solely by white votes, and many able figures were members. It was composed largely of men who were former Whigs, and it was imbued with a spirit of cooperation, and a desire to set the house in order again. Judge Edwin G. Reade, a former Senator in the Confederate Congress, was its president. Judge Warren and Mr. Donnell, as members from Beaufort, rendered able service.\n\nThe legislature met the latter part of November, Governor Holden having submitted his cause to the voters, and being defeated by Jonathan Worth. On November 29, General U. S. Grant visited the senate chamber of North Carolina, and was introduced to the body by Judge Warren.\n\nLittle did they dream at that time that lust for office would cause General Grant to adopt a policy a few years later that placed North Carolina and other Southern States under an iron heel that no conqueror had ever before been guilty of.\n\nThe legislature immediately went about to set up a stable government under the Constitution. But Congress had decreed that the —conquered Province— must have a new constitution, and General Canby, the military commander, initiated the enrollment of the Negroes for their first suffrage. Another great convention was held in Raleigh, this time composed of the Conservatives and Democrats. They denounced the determination for a Constitutional Convention and banded themselves to oppose it. Judge Warren wrote Governor Vance, and Judge Fowle, who had resigned, that his attendance would be incompatible for judicial propriety, but that he was in complete sympathy with their movement.\n\nThe election was held, and as expected, the call for the convention carried. William B. Rodman and William Stilley were elected as members from Beaufort. (Mr. Rodman had now joined\n\nthe Republican party.) Such a conglomeration of constitution makers had never before been gathered. Carpetbaggers, Negroes, illiterate whites with deep-seated prejudices, and about fifteen upper-class men made up the assemblage. In the latter class, besides Mr. Rodman, were Plato Durham, of Cleveland, John W. Graham, and E. M. Holt, of Orange, the last three having no influence, but making memorable fights on all controverted questions. There was a dearth of lawyers in the body. It is paying no compliment to William Blount Rodman to say that he towered above everyone there. He would have been a distinguished leader in any convention or legislative body, where his legal ability and forensic powers would have been in demand. When the convention organized he must have shuddered at the colossal task confronting him, for he had fully determined to battle every question and save the State, if possible, from those who were ready to despoil her. As a former Confederate soldier, with his disabilities still unremoved, and as a former well-known Democrat, he was looked upon with suspicion by the Negroes and carpetbag element. That section of the convention immediately set up as their leader the notorious but able Albion W. Tourgee.\n\nMr. Rodman was immediately appointed as one of the committee of seventeen to report on the best mode of proceeding to frame the constitution and civil government. He was then made chairman of the committee on the judicial department, and it was here he best served North Carolina.\n\nThe constitution of 1868, the organic law of the State today, conceived and born in prejudice and strife, and prepared by a convention, the overwhelming majority of which was hostile to North Carolina, has, notwithstanding its conception, stood the test. It is rather singular to note that Mr. Rodman, who wrote more sections of the constitution than any other man in the convention was not permitted to vote to ratify it. (Because former Confederates were not allowed to vote.)\n\nThe spring of 1870 rolled around, and the State was so shocked at the program of pillage and plunder inaugurated by the carpetbag legislature that it was literally on fire. On June 4 there assembled in the Beaufort County courthouse one of the largest and greatest political conventions held in the East. It was composed of old-line Whigs, Democrats, and many Republicans who were already leaving that party. It was called the —Conservative Democratic convention,— and a full county ticket was quickly and unanimously nominated. It proposed for the Senate Judge Edward J.\n\nWarren and for the House Maj. Thomas Sparrow. Enthusiasm was abundant, for regardless of past differences, the delegates were now united for a single purpose.\n\nThe legislature of redemption met in November, 1870. For another time the chairmanships of the judiciary committee in both senate and house went to Beaufort County. The Conservatives or Democrats had a wide majority in each body, and they immediately set about to undo what the despoilers had been doing for the last two years. They elected Thomas J. Jarvis, then of Tyrrell, and later to become governor, as speaker of the house.\n\nOn December 15, 1870, Maj. Thomas Sparrow, of Beaufort, appeared at the bar of the Senate and impeached Gov. W. W. Holden, in the name of all the people of the State. By reason of his commanding influence and legal ability Sparrow had been chosen chairman of the board of managers.\n\nThe trial proper of Governor Holden, with Chief Justice Pearson presiding, began on January 23, 1871. He was arraigned on eight articles for high crimes and misdemeanors, based on a gross usurpation of the duties of his office, the encouragement of the suspension of the writ of habeas corpus, and a general overriding of the constitutional rights of the citizens of the State. On March 22, 1871, Holden was convicted on six of the eight articles of impeachment.\n\nThe outstanding session of the General Assembly of North Carolina in the entire history of the State was that of 1870-71, when, under the leadership of brave and courageous men, the State was rescued from despotism and her bow once more pointed to ideals that Carolinians revere.\n\nJudge Warren returned home upon the adjournment of the legislature a hopeless invalid, his body racked with muscular rheumatism, and the wheel chair he had been forced to take in Raleigh now became permanent. But his courage did not abate, and daily he was rolled to his office and the courthouse, and the firm of Warren, Carter & Myers had a law practice requiring the time of all of them.\n\nIn 1872 Colonel Carter received the Democratic nomination for Congress from the first district, to oppose the incumbent, Clinton L. Cobb, of Elizabeth City. While dominant in a courthouse and in the legislature, he was handicapped by not knowing how to make a political speech. He and his friends made a thorough canvass of the district, but he was defeated. In the early part of July, 1876, two men rode into Washington in the same carriage,\n\nfollowed by a cheering throng on horseback and foot. They repaired to a grove to address the multitude. One was Zebulon B. Vance, the greatest of all war governors of the Confederacy, and for the time denied his seat in the United States Senate by the reconstruction acts. This former Whig leader and friend of the Union was now the Democratic nominee for Governor of North Carolina. The other was Judge Thomas Settle of the Supreme Court, an antebellum Democrat and now the Republican nominee.\n\nIt was a brilliant debate and issues were discussed, each side receiving equal applause from their partisans. It was the last political act of Judge Warren. He struggled out of his rolling chair and introduced Vance, at the same time paying tribute to Settle, who had been active in 1866 in making him a superior court judge. In the election, Beaufort County gave Vance 137 majority, the first time in the history of the county that it had ever given its popular approval to a Democratic candidate for governor. Three months later Tilden got a small majority, that also being the first instance where a Democratic candidate for President had ever carried it.\n\nOn December 10, 1876, Judge Edward J. Warren died. Physical suffering had made his last years ones of torture. He was only 50 years of age but he was considered an old man. Of stern exterior, with sharp likes and dislikes, he was not a popular man as the term is generally understood. But the people believed in him and delighted to do him honor.\n\nUpon the death of Judge Warren, his law partner, Colonel David M. Carter, moved to Raleigh, where he at once took the position his wealth, character, and capacity commanded. He became director of the Raleigh National Bank and Home Insurance Co., member of the executive committee of the Trustees of the University, the chairman of the Commission to build the Governor's Mansion, and chairman of the board of the State's prison.\n\nCol. Carter had been wounded at the Battle of Seven Pines and left on the battlefield for dead. His Negro slave, Jim, who had accompanied him to war, found him and carried him on his back to a place of safety where he nursed the Colonel back to life.\n\nOne of the most notable trials in the Beaufort County courthouse was Jim'strial some years after the war when Col. Carter defended him so brilliantly. In a recent election Jim had voted the Democratic ticket, and had ostracized himself with the colored population. He was finally attacked on Main Street by several of them with the result that Jim wielded his knife with great dexterity and stabbed one to death. So he was to be tried for murder, and\n\nhis former master, a ferocious old lion, sat by his side. For weeks before the trial the whole county had become either pro or anti Jim Carter, and the case had assumed a political aspect in that the Democrats were for acquittal and the Republicans for conviction. Over 200 Democrats sat in that courthouse with pistols in their pockets.\n\nWhen Jim was acquitted the whole town celebrated.\n\nCol. Carter died in January 1879 at the age of 49. His was another stormy life filled with combat.\n\nRichard S. Donnell, Edward Stanly, Edward J. Warren, Fenner B. Satterthwaite, David M. Carter and Thomas Sparrow were now all dead, and the last of the illustrious ante and post bellum bar had passed off the scene except William B. Rodman who lived until 1893. Most of them had seen the beginning of new faces coming on in their stead, for with 1870 and extending through the eighties, a procession of able, brilliant, and capable men began to constitute the Bar of Washington for another era. James E. Shepherd, George H. Brown, George Sparrow, Charles F. Warren, John H. Small, William B. Rodman, and Enoch S. Simmons made up this array and took high rank in the profession.\n\nMr. Warren closes with this statement:\n\n—Actuated by county pride, and with a deep appreciation of their works, these pen pictures of her sons are presented as Beaufort County's contribution to a notable era of North Carolina history.—\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nBY-GONE DAYS\n\nby\n\nLUCY WHEELOCK WARREN MYERS\n\n(MRS. RODMAN MYERS)\n\nFeb. 20, 1850-Apr. 27, 1937\n\n(The following article was written many years ago by Mrs. Rodman Myers, daughter of Edward Jenner Warren and mother of Mrs. Marcia Myers Knott. These are pre-Civil War Memories.)\n\nOf the early days of Washington I know very little, I have heard Miss Patsy Blount say that when her father, Mr. John Gray Blount, came here to settle he found already a flourishing though scattered settlement. The members of this settlement belonged mostly to the Bonner family.\n\nThese were prosperous people, living in comfortable style in large hiproofed houses, located within sight of one another, mostly outside of the present limits of the town, on the low hills surrounding it.\n\nOne residence, however, and that I suppose of the most influential and prominent member of the family, was located on the bank of the Pamlico River, facing it on what is now Water Street. This was the home of Col. James Bonner. Later this house passed out of the possession of the family and was occupied as a tavern and known as the —old Mulberry Tavern.— It took its name from the double row of Otaheite mulberry trees standing on each side of the walk leading from the gate to the entrance. This building stood, I think until after the War between the States, and then was burned down when a warehouse next door was destroyed by fire which was said to have been set for the purpose of getting insurance\n\non the warehouse. The Mulberry Tavern was a two-story house, with double piazza across the front, making both the upper and lower piazzas. I remember going to this house when a small child with my mother to have some dresses made. It was then occupied by a Mrs. Pugh Whitecar, whose daughter married a northern man, a Mr. Hamilton, who built the house now occupied by Mrs. Wynne on Main Street in front of the Mulberry Tavern lot.\n\nThe house in which I now live stands in —Bonner's Old Part— of the town, on a part of the Col. James Bonner farm. I have heard that a fence ran about on the line of Bonner Street and that when Col. Bonner would be at home on a furlough from the Continental Army he would have a half-witted negro servant keep watch, sitting on this fence, for any suspicious looking parties who might possibly be British or Tories. If the negro saw any signs of danger he would gobble like a turkey, which was the signal agreed upon, and the Colonel would retreat to a place of safety.\n\nMy earliest personal recollections of the town is of its beautifully shaded streets; the English elms, which in that day were used almost exclusively for shade trees, here formed a perfect arch the whole length of the streets. I have been told that persons who visited the town before the war preserved that picture as their foremost recollection of it.\n\nAnother characteristic was its closely fenced yards. All back yards had high close board fences which shut out all view of gardens, kitchens and out-houses; of which there were necessarily many (the smokehouses very important ones) on each lot. Each family kept many servants—cooks, house servants, laundresses, stable and lot boys, most of whom lived on the lots. These fences had closely barred gates with locks and chains, and were usually locked at 9 o'clock at night, after which time negroes were not allowed on the streets without a written permit from their owners. These permits they were required to show to the watchmen who were called the patrol. The negroes had a derisive song about this, beginning —Run, nigger, run, or the patroller catch you!— Even if it were necessary to send a servant for a doctor in haste at night, he dared not venture on the streets without this permit.\n\nSome of my most vivid recollections have to do with the water traffic, both on the upper and lower rivers, and at sea. In fact, in the early days, water communication was the principal way of keeping in touch with the outside world, except by stagecoach for the passengers, and by large canvas-covered wagons for the\n\ninland freight traffic. In my childhood a great event of the day was the passing through of the stagecoach from New Bern to Plymouth and the reverse trip. These stagecoaches were almost as large and heavy and as gaily painted as the circus bandwagon of today. The driver felt his importance and took great delight in blowing at the foot of the bridge a large horn to herald the approach of the stage. He would come into town at a dashing gait and cracking his whip over the four, or sometimes six, horses required to draw the heavy vehicle.\n\nIn those days, too, there was only one small steamboat plying on the upper river, but great quantities of products from the rich counties of Pitt, Edgecombe and Nash were freighted down on flatboats consigned to middlemen here, called commission merchants, to be shipped away on seagoing vessels. Those merchants found this business very lucrative, and were among the wealthiest and most prominent men of the town. Among them I recall Mr. B. F. Havens, Mr. W. A. Willard, Mr. S. R. Fowle, Mr. G. H. Brown, and Mr. John Myers. The flatboats brought a very important part of the trade of the town. These boats were propelled by manpower, they were poled along by negroes who walked along a plank footway along the side of the boat. As they walked, they chanted a most peculiar mournful song. These flatboats came down the river piled high with bales of cotton, barrels of tar, pitch and turpentine, bags of corn, sides of bacon and stacks of brick, staves and shingles. The making of barrels was an important industry here, and the town was dotted with noisy cooper shops. These barrels were used by the large distilleries located here.\n\nThe commission merchants, many of them, owned large seagoing sailing vessels—two and three vessels each which traded along the coast northward to Baltimore, Philadelphia, New York and Boston, and southward to the West Indies. All the ice we had in those days was natural ice, brought from Maine in these sailing vessels. I well remember how interesting it was to watch the stevedores unloading the great blocks of ice and storing them away in the two big ice houses owned by Mr. B. F. Havens and Mr. John Myers. Then, still more interesting, was the coming of vessels from the West Indies with sugar, molasses, oranges, tamarinds, limes and a treat of sticks of sugar cane for the children—with also an occasional monkey or parrot for sale.\n\nForeign sailors, who came on these vessels, were one of the bug-a-bears of the little children in my day. They were a drunken, noisy crowd, swaggering about the streets, making things very disagreeable\n\nwhile they were in port. Many of them were Portuguese, who looked very outlandish with their long hair and the big gold-hooped earrings they wore.\n\nThe block on which Mr. Jonathon Havens— oil mill stands was closely built up with stores kept by merchants who did a large business. On the side of Mr. Havens— mill (the lot and the buildings on it belonged at the time to Mr. Macon Bonner), Mr. Louis Labarbe carried on a business. Mr. Labarbe came here a small orphan boy whose parents had been murdered by the blacks in a negro insurrection in the French West India Island of Martinique. He and a little negro, or mulatto, boy managed to elude the frenzied blacks and made their way to a ship from this town which was lying in harbor. The captain treated them kindly and brought them with him. Mr. Lewis LeRoy (who married Miss Palmer, a granddaughter of Sir Robert Palmer) took charge of little Labarbe, raised him in his family, and Mr. Labarbe grew up to marry Miss Peggy LeRoy, daughter of his benefactor. The little negro was sold and bought by my great-grandfather, —Parson— Bowen, and became a trusted and valued servant in his family. My grandmother (Elizabeth Bonner, nee Bowen) always spoke of him as —good old Uncle Phil.—\n\nOther refugees from these insurrected islands found their way here and had much influence upon the social life and manners in Washington. One of them, a Mr. Chapeau, a very accomplished gentleman, taught here the French language and dancing—especially the stately minuet—for which the young ladies had a skirt especially made, opened on the sides so that in one of the figures they could catch up the skirt with the tips of the fingers and hold it out at arm's length. Mr. Chapeau married a Miss Singletary, sister of the Rev. Mr. Singletary, a clergyman of the Episcopal church. After order was restored in the French West India Islands, Mr. Chapeau went to France and recovered a portion of his estates. We own some silver which belonged to Mr. and Mrs. Chapeau—marked with their initial —C,— which was bequeathed to Miss Patsy Blount by her life-long friend, Mrs. Chapeau.\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nTHE CIVIL WAR ERA\n\nThe following article by Charles F. Warren, father of the Honorable Lindsay C. Warren, was published in The Confederate Reveille in 1898. It is used here by permission of the Pamlico Chapter, United Daughters of the Confederacy.\n\nPART 1\n\nWASHINGTON DURING THE —CIVIL WAR\n\nOn March 14th, 1862, New Berne was captured by the Federal forces under General Burnside. The cannonade could be distinctly heard at Washington. Just before the battle at New Berne the bridge over Pamlico River at Washington was partially destroyed by incendiary fire, at night, to prevent the Confederates from uniting with the command of General Branch defending New Berne. Upon the fall of New Berne the town of Washington was evacuated by the Confederate forces, which included a Georgia regiment, commanded by Colonel McMillan. All that part of Eastern North Carolina adjacent to Pamlico and Albemarle sounds and the rivers emptying into them passed under Federal control, and remained until the capture of Plymouth by the Confederates under General Hoke, a period of two years. The limits of Federal occupation, however, were closely confined to the sounds and navigable streams and to the garrisoned towns upon them.\n\nTHE ENTRANCE OF FEDERALS\n\nOn March 20th, 1862, the Twenty-fourth Massachusetts Regiment, Colonel Stevenson, was sent from New Berne to Washington on the transport Guide, accompanied by the gunboats, Delaware, Louisiana and Commodore Barney. This expedition was stopped the next morning six miles below the town by the blockade which\n\nthe Confederates had placed across the river at Hill's Point. This blockade consisted of rows of piling driven into the bed of the river and sawed off about three feet below the surface of the water. The gunboat, Delaware, with two companies, passed the blockade and landed at the wharves of the town. The transport and other gunboats remained at the blockade. At this time Washington had been entirely evacuated by the Confederates, and no resistance was encountered. The two companies, preceded by the regimental band, marched from the wharf to the courthouse and hoisted the Stars and Stripes. The band played national airs and the men cheered. They then marched through the principal streets to the gunboat, and the fleet returned to New Berne. These were the first Federal soldiers to enter the town. The Colonel in his report states that he saw some evidences of Union sentiment among the citizens of the town. It was probably confined to a few individuals. Soon after the return of the expedition to New Berne a permanent garrison, consisting of cavalry, infantry and artillery occupied the town and held it until the spring of 1864. Gunboats were anchored in the river in front of the town. After the occupation of the town there were a number of affairs between outposts, including a spirited action at Tranter'sCreek on June 5th, 1862, between the Forty-fourth North Carolina, Colonel George B. Singeltary and eight companies of the Twenty-fourth Massachusetts, Lieutenant-Colonel F. A. Osborn, one company of the Third New York Cavalry, Captain Jocknick, and two pieces of Marine Artillery, Lieutenant Avery.\n\nThe gunboat, Picket, Captain Nicoll, went up the river shelling the woods between the river and the Greenville road. She was too far distant from the scene of action at Hardison's Mill, upon Tranter's Creek, to take part in it. Colonel Singeltary was killed and several wounded on the part of the Confederates. Unfortunately there are no official Confederate reports of this action published in the War Records. The Federals lost 4 killed and 11 wounded, three of them mortally. From all accounts the Federals returned to Washington much demoralized. After the death of Colonel Singeltary, fearing a landing of troops in the rear from the gunboat, the Confederates also retreated.\n\nTHE SEPTEMBER ATTACK\n\nAbout 4 o'clock on the morning of September 6th, 1862, a Confederate force, consisting of infantry, cavalry and a battery of artillery, under the command of General J. G. Martin, attacked\n\nthe town. The Federal garrison then consisted of five companies of the Third New York Cavalry, Colonel Mix, two companies (G and H) of the Third New York Artillery, two companies of the Twenty-fourth Massachusetts, and two companies of the First North Carolina (Union). Two gunboats, the Picket, Captain Nicoll, and the Louisiana, Captain Renshaw, were anchored in front of the town. The Picket was just above the bridge, near the blockade, and the Louisiana just below the bridge, opposite the Havens— warehouse. The Federal garrison, including the crews of the two gunboats, numbered about 1,000 men. The Confederates had about the same number of men. There are no official Confederate reports of the engagement published in the War Records, and their strength, composition and losses are not given. The battery of artillery was the Adams battery, raised in Beaufort County. Among the cavalry was the company commanded by Captain Rufus S. Tucker raised in Wake and Johnston counties and recruited in Pitt County. There were detachments from the Seventeenth North Carolina and other infantry regiments. A number of citizens, who had moved away when the town was occupied by the Federals, accompanied the attacking force and acted as guides. The Confederates surprised the outer line of pickets, killing and wounding them, and, dashing into the town, surprised a company of artillery, in barracks at the Academy, capturing four brass 6-pounders and some prisoners. These guns had been captured from A. C. Latham's battery by the Federals at New Berne. The Confederate infantry approached the town through the Grist field and entered at the west end. The cavalry and artillery entered by the Greenville road. Just before the cavalry turned into Bridge Street from the Greenville road, Captain Booth, commanding the cavalry, was shot by one of the Federal pickets and was dangerously wounded. The command of the cavalry then devolved upon Captain Tucker. The attack was made with great spirit before daylight. There was considerable fog in the early morning which, together with the darkness, made it difficult to distinguish friend from foe. At the time of the attack there were some field works and blockhouses, but the formidable chain of forts and intrenchments around the town were constructed later in the war. The Federals were surprised, but still were not unprepared. As the Confederates entered the town from the west, four companies of cavalry and a battery of artillery from the garrison had formed and were marching from town at the east end for Plymouth to co-operate with the Federal gunboats upon Roanoke River in attacking Hamilton.\n\nThis column was just emerging from the town as the firing began at the west end. The column counter-marched at a gallop, and one company charged up Main Street, encountering some squads of Confederate cavalry near Market Street, driving them back upon the infantry, which by this time had advanced to Bridge Street. The Federal cavalry were then repulsed with loss. Two companies of Federal cavalry charged up Second and Third streets, but were driven back by the Confederates. Upon Second Street the Confederates planted a piece of artillery in front of the Methodist church and opened fire upon a Federal gun at the intersection of Second and Respess streets. The elms were in full leaf and the street between the two guns was filled with branches shot from the trees. On Main Street squads of Confederate cavalry and infantry advanced as far east as Market Street. Just after the fight opened the Picket blew up, killing her captain and nineteen of the crew and wounding six others. The cause of the explosion was not clearly ascertained, but was probably due to carelessness or accident in opening the magazine when her men were ordered to quarters. The wreck still lies in the river near the blockade. When Burnside's expedition entered Hatteras Inlet he had his headquarters upon this gunboat Picket. Colonel Potter, the commandant of the post, planted at the intersection of Main and Bridge streets a 12-pounder, supported by his entire infantry force, and opened fire upon the Confederates between Main and Second streets and around the Academy. The firing in this part of the town was very sharp and continued nearly three hours, the combatants approaching within fifty or sixty yards of each other and firing across lots from behind houses and fences. A number of men were here killed and wounded upon both sides and two sets of gunners were shot down at the Federal gun. Both sides held on with great tenacity. The Federal infantry were driven back to the warehouses upon the wharves under the cover of the guns of the Louisiana, but still kept up a hot fire. The Louisiana then turned her guns upon the town and threw shot and shell through that part from the Havens— residence westward. Few houses in the line of her fire escaped and after the fight that part of the town presented a shattered and wrecked appearance. What is now the Satchwell residence was completely riddled. At times the fire of the gunboat was silenced by the fire of the Confederate infantry. Cavalry fighting in the meantime was going on in the outskirts and different streets of the town, extending as far east as Market Street. The Federal cavalry made a dash down Bridge\n\nStreet and a hand to hand fight occurred in front of the James W. Redding and the DeMille residences. Several men were killed and wounded at this point and the Federal squadron was driven back with loss. Mrs. John Redding, in the front room of her house, was wounded. The marks of this fight are still to be seen upon the porch in front of the house. Failing to surprise the garrison by reason of the detachment for Plymouth being already formed and upon the march, and unable to silence the fire of the gunboat, the Confederates withdrew, carrying with them the four captured guns. It was a well contested action and creditable to the gallantry of both sides. The Federals lost twenty-seven killed, fifty-three wounded and four missing, according to their report. They claimed to have found twelve dead and twelve wounded Confederates upon the streets and to have captured twenty prisoners. The Confederates carried off a part of their dead and wounded. It is probable that the loss on each side was about equal. William O. Respess was severely wounded upon the porch of the Carraway residence, on the west side of Bridge Street, between Main and Second streets, while firing upon the Federal gunners serving the gun at the foot of Bridge Street.\n\nTHE SIEGE\n\nThe Confederate forces under General D. H. Hill began the siege of the town on March 30th, 1863. The object of General Hill's movement in Eastern North Carolina was to collect supplies of corn, meat and forage for the Confederate armies and to capture the town of Washington and its garrison. Unfortunately, the Confederates had no gunboats or ironclads, as at Plymouth the next year, to effectually close and command the river. This was the weak point in the investment of the town and permitted the passage at night of vessels and transports carrying ammunition, commissary stores and reinforcements to the garrison. The besieging force consisted of the brigades of Daniel and Pettigrew on the south side of Pamlico River, and the brigade of Garnett of Pickett's division on the north side. There were a number of batteries of artillery and some cavalry. In all the force under General Hill engaged in the siege numbered about 9,000 men. The Confederates seized Hill's Point, occupied the old fort constructed by them at the beginning of the war and held in check the large fleet of Federal gunboats and transports endeavoring to force the passage of the river and relieve the garrison of the town. Rodman's Quarter was also seized by the Confederates and a battery of Whitworth\n\nguns placed in position. The brigades of Daniel and Pettigrew, extending from Chocowinity Crossroads to Blount's Creek, covered the rear of the forts and prevented the relief of the garrison by the Federal forces at New Berne. The Federal garrison consisted of eight companies each of the Twenty-seventh and Forty-fourth Massachusetts, two companies of the First Nort"
