        "text": "The modern Order of St John’s Annual Reports were produced from the very early days of the modern Order’s inception. These records tell us about the Order’s members, their roles and ranks, promotions, admissions, and obituaries. It tells us about the work of the Order overseas, the insignia, statutes, and reports on the Chapter. The Annual Reports also play a key part in telling the history of St John Ambulance by providing information on medical training, reports on the health of the nation, information about technological advances in healthcare, and details of the formation and disbanding of various nursing and ambulance units over time. They tell us how important the work of our first aid volunteers is, how it was done, and where it took place."
