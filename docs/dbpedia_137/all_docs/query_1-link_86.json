During this period of time, every section of the State has been visited in person by the author. He has delved into the court house records kept at the most important county-seats in Geor gia; has gone through the files of old newspapers; has bent over crumbling tombstones in ancient church-yards and burialgrounds to decipher the almost obliterated epitaphs; and, leaving the beaten highways of travel, has followed the obscure bridle paths into many an unfrequented nook and corner of the State. Something- over one hundred libraries have been consulted, in addition to which thousands of letters have been written. There is not a patriotic society in Georgia which has not contributed substaiitially to the progress of this undertaking. Much of the rare information contained in White's two priceless volumes long since out of print has been transferred to this work, with due credit; while the essential portions of Sherwood's quaint little Gazetteer have likewise been embodied in ' * GEORGIA *s LANDMARKS, MEMORIALS AND LEGENDS. ''\n\nIt was the author's plan originally to restrict the present work to a single volume of six hundred pages. But the magni tude of the field was not realized in this ea.rly forecast; and to adhere to this original purpose would mean the sacrifice of more than half of the materials gathered through long and patient research. Two volumes, therefore, each of them con taining one thousand pages, will be required to meet the neces sary demands of this work. However, by eliminating an agent's commission, the cost of each volume is reduced to a nominal sum and placed within the means of every one who cherishes a just pride in the history of our great State. The first volume, wMch appears at this time, is divided into two parts, one of -which is entitled: ''Landmarks and Memorials,\" while the other con tains \"Historical Outlines, Original Settlers, and Distinguished Residents of the Counties of Georgia.\" The second volume -by far the richer of the two will be apportioned into eight parts\n\nvi\n\nPREFACE\n\nas follows: 1. \"Landmarks and Memorials;\" 2. \"Duels Fought by Noted Georgians;\" 3. \"Historic Burial-Grounds, Epitaphs, and Inscriptions;\" 4. \"Personal Recollections, Anecdotes, and Reminiscences;\" 5. \"Myths and Legends of the Indians;\" 6. '' Tales of the Revolutionary Camp-Fires;\" 7. \" Georgia Miscel lanies;\" and 8. an \"Analytical Index,\" containing every im portant name in any wise connected with Georgia's history, Colonial, Revolutionary, and Commonwealth.\n\nOn the very threshold of this work, the author desires to make grateful acknowledgements to those who from the start have given him not only sympathetic encouragement but sub stantial help, and whose generous co-operation, at each stage of the undertaking, has made an otherwise arduous task compara tively light.

At this point a wooded bluff over looks a wide expanse of verdant marsh lands, surrounded on either side by the encircling -waters of Cumberland Sound; and the shimmer of blue waves, caught in the dis tance, through trembling vistas of luxuriant foliage, is most enchanting to the eye, especially when a storm at sea curls them into feathery white-caps1. The little en closed area in which, with military honors, the famous hero was laid to rest, in the spring of 1818, was then a part of the estate of Major-General Nathanael Greene, a dis tinguished comrade-in-arms'whose family he was visiting at the time of his death. Years ago a large part of the island, including the historic tidewater home of General Greene, \"was purchased by Thomas Carnegie, a kinsman of the great steel king of Pittsburg and himself a man of millions. With the ample means at his' command the new owner proceeded to convert the famous estate into\n\n2\n\nGEORGIA'S LANDMARKS, MEMORIALS AND LEGENDS\n\none of the most beautiful retreats on the coast of North America. Magnificent walks and driveways were opened through a dense forest of live-oaks, festooned with long wisps' of trailing moss; rare bnlbs from, remote parts \"were transplanted in the rich soil of Dungeness; and whatever was calculated either to please the eye or to promote the comfort of a cultuj^ed gentleman of leisure, was sought by this wizard of finance, regardless of cost, to enhance the picturesque environment.\n\nToday the vast estate constitutes an independent com munity within itself, possessing every luxury of presentday life and suggesting the modernized country-seat of some aristocratic old English baron. The palatial mansion in which the widow Oarriegie spends the winter months is only a few yards distant from the little burial ground, in one of the brick walls of which a memorial tablet bears the name of the late owner. But the most historic spot on the whole island, around which for nearly a century has' centered a wealth of patriotic associations and to which thousands of tourists have flocked annually in the heated months of mid-summer, is the grave in which \"Light Horse Harry\" T^ce long rested. It was formerly marked by a plain marble headstone, on which the following brief inscription was chiseled:\n\n\"Saered to the Memory Gci eral Henry Le e, of Virginia. Obit, 25 M arch, 1818 Aetat 63.\n\nDuring a recent session of the Virginia Legislature a bill was passed appropriating the sum of $500 from the State treasury to defray the expenses incident to remov ing General Lee's body from Dungeness to Lexington. At the same time a committee was appointed to whom the oversight of this sacred task was entrusted. It is most likely that the ashes of the Revolutionary patriot\n\nDUNGENESS\n\n3\n\nwill occupy a crypt in the chapel of Washington and Lee University, beside the remains of his renowned son, General Robert K. Lee, the South 'a great military chief tain. The patriotic societies of Georgia have entered a vigorous protest against the proposed removal. But, the consent of Mrs. Lucy Carnegie having been obtained, the Commonwealth of Virginia cannot -well be estopped from claiming the dust of an illustrious son to whom she now offers a receptacle in her own bosom. As this work goes to press1, the transfer of General Lee's remains to Virginia is still an unaccomplished fact; but hope of keeping them in Georgia has been finally relinquished. It is not unlikely that the Daughters of the Revolution will mark the empty tomb with an appropriate memorial of some kind which, briefly reciting the facts, together with the date of disintenneiit, \"will serve to keep the hallowed spot perpetually sacred.\n\nGeneral Henry Lee was easily the foremost officer of cavalry in the first \"war for independence; and to his gallant bTfide Georgia owes a debt of gratitude which two centuries have not extinguished. At the head of an independent legion, he took part in the siege of Augusta and became an important factor, under General Greene, in the final expulsion of the \"British from Georgia soil. Later he wrote an exhaustive account of his operations in the Southern Department, a work of great value to historians1, comprised in two rich volumes. He also became Governor of the State of Virginia; and, on the death of \"Washington, pronounced upon his silent Commander-in.-Chief the famous culogium in which he characterized him in the often-quoted words: \"First in \"war, first in peace, and first in the hearts of his1 countrymen.' **\n\nWhile taking the part of a. friend, whom he was visiting at the time, in Baltimore, General Lee received\n\n*\"To the memory of the man, first in war, first in peace, and first in the hearts of his countrymen.\" Eulogy on Washington, December 26, 1799.\n\n4\n\nGEORGIA'S LANDMARKS, MEMORIALS AND LEGENDS\n\ninjuries from the effects of which, lie never recovered. The circumstances which culminated in this tragic affair were as follows:* \"In the stirring- times of 1812, Alex ander Contee Hanson, editor of the Federal Republican, strongly opposed the declaration of war against England. Feeling- ran so high among the war party that the news paper office was attacked :and the editors driven to Georgetown. Later IrTanson determined to return, and was accompanied by General Lee and other friends who volunteered to defend him. The residence leased \"by Mm in Baltimore was attacked, and to save the occupants from nmrder the authorities placed them in the old city jail for protection. But the rioters forced themselves into the jail, attacking- Hanson, General Lee, and seven others in the party. They -were beaten, mutilated, and according to an account in Scharf's history, were thrown down the steps of the jail, where they lay in a heap for three hours. General Lee's constitution was1 wrecked.\" In the hope of regaining his healths 'the ipld soldier embarked for the West Indies, where he remained for something- over four years; and it was wriile enroute back to his home in Virginia that he was put ashore at Cumberland Island.\n\n.General Lee did not expect to find here his1 old com rade-in-arms. The latter died at Mulberry Grove, near Savannah, more than thirty years prior to the time of General Lee's visit. The widow Gi-eenc, who afterwards married Phineas Miller, was likewise in her grave. But there was living at Duiigeness a daughter, Mrs. Louisa Shaw, by whom the old invalid was most graciously and gladly received; and here he remained until the death angel released him from his sufferings. For the account which follows of the last moments of the old hero, we are indebted in the main to Colonel Charles C. Jones, Jr., of Augusta, who obtained from an eye-witness, Mr. Phineas M. Nightingale, a recital of :the facts1. Mr1. Nightingale was a grandson of Genera] Greene and a\n\nDUNGENESS\n\n5\n\nmember of the household at the time of General Lee's sojourn on the island. The story, with additional par ticulars gathered from other sources, is as follows:\n\nWhen the second war with England began, ''Light Horse Harry\" Lee--though the foremost survivor of the first struggle for independence--found himself an invalid, nursing an old wound. Thus prevented by physical disabilities from assuming- an active command in the renewed contcst? his disappointment only served to aggravate his condition. He chafed under this restraint; and, in the hope that a change of climate might restore his failing health he sailed in 1813 for the West Indies. It was the cherished purpose of the old soldier, while in retirement, to revise his \"Memoirs of the War in the Southern Department'' and to prepare biographies of his two beloved commanders--Greene and Washington. Says Colonel .Tones:* \"It will ever be n matter of regret that ho failed to compass the execution of this plan. To his Memoirs be would doubtless have imparted additional value and interest but in their present form they possess the highest merit and constitute the best military record we possess of the heroic memories embraced within their scope. \"Lives of Washington and Greene have been carefully studied and well writ ten; bat for one I freely confess to the firm conviction that biographies of these heroes by their gifted and eloquent compatriot and friend would have far surpassed all others.\" More than four years were spent by General Lee in the mild climate of the sub-tropics. But the benefit which he derived from his long sojourn was only temporary; and he could do no writing while he here lingered among the ocean breezes'. At leng'th. it became evident to the \"wan sufferer that the end \"was near at hand. Accordingly, toward the close of the month of January, 1818, he took passage in a schooner bound from Nassau to Boston, the Captain--\n\nReminiscences of tho Last Days, Death and Burial of General Henry Lee, by Charles C. Jones, Jr., Albany, N. \"Y., 1S70.\n\n6\n\nGEORGIA'S LANDMARKS, MEMORIALS AND LEGENDS\n\nwho proved to be also the owner of the vessel--agreeing to put him ashore at the south end of Cumberland. Island. For this1 service the Captain refused to accept compensa tion, esteeming- it a privilege \"to minister to the comfort and to respond to the wishes of so distinguished a hero of the Revolution.''\n\nOriginally the name of Cumberland Island was \"Missoe\", a term which in tile language of the Creek Indians of the Georgia coast is said to have meant \"Sassafras,\" At the suggestion of Tomo-chi-chi 's nephew, the name \"was changed to Cumberland, in honor of the Duke of Cumberland, from whom the youth had received the gift of a watch. Ogletborpe was so pleased with this evidence of good-will on the part of the Indian that he is said to have erected near the southern end of the island a hunting lodge which he called Dungeness, after an English country seat of which he was the owner in the county of Kent. To quote a,n old record, Dungeness from this time until the outbreak of the Revolution \"was owned successively by peers of the realm.\" The place was acquired by General Greejie soon after he became a resident of Georgia, probably in 1784. Though he did not live to realize his dream of making this island retreat Ms summer home, he carefully planned both the original mansion and the grounds; and subsequent to his death it became the favorite abode and the last resting place of his widow, who years later smiled upon the suit of Phineas Miller. At the time of General Lee's visit, Mrs. Shaw, her daughter, a chai'ming hostess, presided over the mansion and dispensed the hospitalities of this farfamed seat.\n\nIt was early in the month of February, 1818, when, toward the hour of 4 o'clock in the afternoon, a grandson of General Greene, a lad some fifteen years old, who was amusing himself with boyish sports near the water front,\n\nDTTNGENESS\n\n7\n\nobserved a schooner wliicli seemed to be approaching the private docks at Dungeness1. Before reaching the wharf, however, the schooner came to anchor in the middle of the narrow channel, and a boat was lowered, into which a feeble old man was assisted by the captain and mate, who took scats beside him, and together they \"were rowed ashore by two sailors. The yonth hastened forward to ascertain the object of this unexpected visit and to welcome the guest. General Lee was tenderly lifted frbm the boat and brought ashore by the officers. He was plainly, almost scantily, attired. The sailors' placed upon the wharf an old hair trunk in a dilapidated condition and a cask of Madeira wine. General Lee brought no other baggage with him. Beckoning the youth to his side, he inquired his name. Learning that he was a grandson of his old' war comrade and that Mrs. Shaw was at home, the strange visitor threw his arms lovingly around the lad, 'who, withont knowing \"what it meant, returned the old hero's warm embrace. Then leaning heavily upon the stout arm of the youth, General Lee walked a short distance from the landing and sat upon a log, overcome by exhaustion. Too weak to proceed further, he bade the boy run at once to the house and to say to his aunt that an old friend and comrade of her father's--General Lee--was at the wharf and wished the carriage to be sent for him. \"Tell her,\" he added, \"that I am come pur posely to die in the house and in the -arms of the daughter of my old friend and companion.''\n\nLeaving the old hero seated upon the log, young Phineas Nightingale--for this was the lad's name-- hastened to the mansion, communicated the fact of General Lee's arriva] and delivered his message to the mistress of Dungeness. The carriage was immediately sent to the landing and in it General Lee and his little friend rode leisurely up together. When they arrived at the house, the old soldier was so weak that he had to be assisted both in getting out of the carriage and in ascend ing the steps. Having received a most cordial welcome\n\n8\n\nGEORGIA'S LANDMARKS, MEMORIALS AND XJEGENDS\n\nfrom the Shaws lie excused himself at once and retired to his room. Such \"was1 his extreme feebleness that he remained a recluse, emerging but once a day, and then only for a short walk in the ga,rden. On these outdoor excursions he always sent for young Nightingale to accompany him. It was seldom that he dined with the family, his meals as a rule being served in his room. A.t last he was unable to take his customary stroll in the open air, and the painful realization of the fact that he was a prisoner told unhappily upon the sensitive nerves of the high strung old aristocrat.\n\nThere happened to be at this time in the harbor to the south of the island--pending negotiations for the annexa tion of Florida--a number of naval ships; \"while at Fernandina, on the Florida coast, there \"was stationed a land force. The officers in both departments of the service called in a body upon the distinguished guest. But as a rule, General Lee wished no one to enter his room. At times he suffered paroxysms of extreme agony and when these occurred at short intervals his exhibitions of mingled rage and anguish were often something fearful to behold. To quote Colonel Jones, \"it was the strong man wrestling with the frailties of the falling tabernacle --the brave heart chafing- under the decadence of physical powers--the cag'ed and wounded eagle beating against the prison bars and longing for the sunlight and free air, the lordly plumage and sturdy pinions of former days.\" At such times his groans would fill the house and wring the hearts of the anxious friends \"who watched at the bedside of the srifferer. Many of the important remedies which modern ingenuity and professional skill have since contrived wore then unknown a,nd the patient languished amid physical tortures which medical science, at a later period, might have materially mitigated.\n\nDuring his illness, the old hero was constantly attended by two of the best surgeons from the fleet.\n\nTHE CARNEGIE MANSION. BUILT ON THE SITE OF GENERAL NATHANAEL GREENE'S OLD HOME AT DUNGENESS.\n\nSome of the incidents which occurred at this time would be really amusing- if they were not at the same time deeply pathetic. Tn moments of supreme agony, losing his' self-control, G-eneral Ijce 'would sometimes drive the servants from his presence and never after wards permit them to enter his room. At length an old domestic, formerly Mrs. G-reene's favorite maid, was selected to wait upon General \"Lee. She- was an esteemed and privileged family servant. Bnt the first thing\" the old soldier did when she entered the apartment was to hurl his hoot at her head and to order her ont iiistanter. Entirely unused to such treatment, the negrcss, without saying1 a word, deliberately picked up the hoot and threw it back at General Lee. The effect produced by thih strange and unexpected retort was instantaneous. The features of the stem, old warrior relaxed. In the midst of his pain and anguish a smile passed over his counten ance, and from that mo7nenl: 1121 til the day of his death he would permit no one except \"Mom Sarah\" to minister to his wants'.\n\nGeneral Lee's sojourn at Duiig-eriess lasted two months. He breathed his last on March 25, 181.8, and was laid to rest in Georgia's bosom.\n\nAs s'oon as the fact of his demise was made known, all the vessels in Cumberland Sound displayed colors at half mast. The funeral was attended by the army and navy officers who were on duty at the mouth of the St. Mary's River, and by detachments from both wings of the coast defence. Minute-guns were fired from the flag-ship-- the John Adams--while the body was being lowered, into the tomb and at the close of the services at the grave, a salute was fired. Nothing was omitted in the way of for mal honors, to show a nation's sorrow for the loss of an illustrious1 soldier and patriot. Sometime in the early thirties, two marble slabs, one to be put at the head and the other at the foot of the grave, were sent to Dung-eness\n\nGEORGIA'S IJANDMABKS, MEMORIALS AND\n\nby Major Lee, tlie old hero's eldest son; and they were at once placed in position by Mr. Nightingale over the last resting place of \"Light Horse Harry.\"\n\nPrior to the Civil War, the question of the removal of General Lee's body to Virginia, the State of his birth, was discussed by the Legislature in session at Richmond and commissioners to superintend the execution of the trust 'were duly appointed. But the outbreak of hostilities shortly ensued; and nothing further could be done at this time. For years after the war, the State was too harrassed by debt and too exhausted by the ravages of con flict, to undertake this labor of love. \"But in 1912 another movement looking toward the transfer of the old soldier's body to Virginia was successfully launched, and Georgia will be called upon in the near future to surrender the charge which for nearly a hundred years she has kept in her heart's core at Dnngeness.\n\nOver the ashes of General Greene's1 widow, in the little btirial ground at Dungeness. stands a marble slab some what dingy with age, on which the following inscription is lettered:\n\nCatharine Miller, -widow of Major-General Greene, Commander-in-chief: of the American Revolutionary Army, in the Southern Department, who died September 1, 1814.

His grave is marked by a substantial headstone, from the record carved upon which the following particulars in regard to him have been gleaned. He \"was born at Newton, Mass., April 23, 1767 and educated at Harvard. la the struggle for independence he was a comrnssioned officer,\n\nDUNGENBSS\n\n11\n\nand at the close of hostilities became a eounsellor-at-law.

Shaw, General Grrecne's1 daughter, is buried here beside her husband, James Shaw, Esq. The former died April 24, 1831, aged 44 years; the latter January 6, 1820, two year's after General Lee's visit, aged 35 years. Several other members of the immediate family connec tion are also here entombed.\n\nHistory often repeats itself. In the vernal months of 1870 another care-worn sufferer, embarking upon an ocean voyage, sought the healing- balm of the southern waters. He, too, was a soldier of the Virginia line. On an April day at Appomattox, worn by victorious combat, lie brought his tattered legions to a last pathetic halt. Fate wrote his name among the vanquished, but she qualified the record wTith this entry in a bold pen--\"over powered but not outgeneraled.\" The very bugles which told of the truce sang a pean to his genius which kindled an echo on the answering cliffs of the furthest mountain; while the prowess1 which enabled him through four longyears to withstand a world in arms travelled upon the ebbing tide of a Lost Cause to the remotest isles of the sea. Even in the judgment of his enemies, he towered a prince among the men of battle; and the foremost critics of his time have laid the palm of soldiership upon his surrendered sword. But the sublime self-abnegation which constrained this peerless leader of the embattled hosts to decline the most nattering overtures of for tune for a modest seat of learning in the Valley of Virginia, where he might lead the feet of his young countrymen in the gentle paths of peace--his majestic and serene poise of soul--his stainless' nobility of character--these crowned him above the wreaths of battle with the fadeless laurels of Lexington; and, if moral\n\n12 GEORGIA'S LANDMARKS, MEMORIALS AND LEGENDS\n\ngrandetir be the scale by which, we measure men, \"we must look in vain for his like even among the mail-clad knights of Homer's land of heroes.\n\nBut the burdens which weighed upon Ms shoulders were not alone those of his college. He bore the sorrows of his people. In the vain hope of renewing his strength, he sought the Bahama Islands; and, on his way back to Lexington, impelled by filial reverence, he made a pil grimage to his father's grave at Dungeness. It was not his first visit to this beloved shrine, but it proved to be his last. He was accompanied on the trip by an idolized daughter, \"who did not long survive him. At Savannah, he wrote a letter home in which he told of the visit to Dungeness1. It was dated April 18, 1870. Said he*: \"We visited Cumberland Island where Alice decorated my father's grave with beautiful fresh flowers. I presume it will be the last time I shall be able to pay it my tribute of respect. The cemetery is unharmed and the graves in good condition, but the house at Dungeness has been burned and the island devastated. I hope I am better.\" But it was not to be. He resumed his arduous duties, only to lay them down again in a few weeks. The end came gently but suddenly--almost in a flash. It \"was not disease in the ordinary sense by which the mysterious thread of life was severed, but anguish of soul. Six months from-the date when the above letter was penned, the renowned warrior fell asleep at Lexington, bequeath ing to his fellow-countrymen and to the -whole AngloSaxon race, the untarnished sword, the matchless example, and the immortal name of Eobert E. Tjee.\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nJefferson Davis's Arrest at Irwinville: The True Story of a. Dramatic Episode\n\nT WO miles to the we.at-Q Irwinville, in what is today a dense thicket of pines, there occurred at the close of the Qivjl_35ju^_ari_j_nejidgnt concerning which a host of writers have produced for commercial purposes an endless amount of fiction. It was here, in the gray morning twiligjit of May 10, 1865, while encamped on land today tlie prcTperTy oTTTudge 3. 15. Clement, of Irwinville, that Jeffexaoii_I^avisjMPre,id^iit\n\na, was overtak_en by ,\n\narrel.~ Store tharThalf a century has elapsed since then; and happily with the flight of time some of the fairy tales of this dramatic period, when the imagination was inflamed by passion, have been dispelled. To prejudice the popular mind against Mr. Davjs and to bring upon him speedily the punishment to which he was exposed by reason of his fallen fortunes, there appeared 4n the Northern papers a story concocted by some evil genius with malice aforethought to the effect that when arrested the President was clad in his wife's calico wrapper and that, among other articles of feminine attire which he wore at this time, were a hoop-skirt and a sun-bonnet.\n\nShades of Ananias! The facts are these: Mrs. Davis, with four of her children, left the Confederate capital,\n\n14 GEOHGIA'S LANDMARKS, MEMORIALS AND LEGENDS\n\nunder an escort, several days in advance of the final evacuation of Richmond. Mr. Davis followed in the course of a week's time, proceeding southward by slow stages. It was not until Lee and Johnston had both surrendered that he ceased to cherish some hope of ulti mate success. After the final meeting of the Confederate Cabinet in Washington, Gra., he leisurely resumed his journey toward the trans-Mississippi region, there quietly at home to await results. It was not in the charac ter of a fugitive that he bade adieu to his friends in the little Georgia town; and so deliberate \"was he in the matter of saying farewell that Dr. H. A. Tupper, an eminent Baptist divine, with whom he stopped, turned to Judge Garnett Andrews and said:\n\n\"I really believe that Mr. Davis \"wishes to be captured.\" 1\n\nIt is certain that he manifested every sign of indiffer ence, though he must have known that the country \"was full of armed men \"who \"were panting like blood-hounds upon his track. Word having reached him of a con spiracy on the part of desperate men to rob the wagon train in which Mrs. Davis was journeying, he hastened to overtake her, going some distance ont of the direct line of travel. Such a change in Ms plans meant that he was certain to be either arrested or killed; and, turning to the faithful comrades in misfortune who accompanied him, Mr. Davis urged them to feel in nowise bound to attend him upon this hazardous trip. But not a man in the party availed himself of this loop-hole to escape danger. Mrs. Davis, in the course of time, was' finally overtaken; and the President, with his party, was preparing to move in advance of her when, just at the hour of dawn, on May 10, 1865, he was suddenly halted. Besides the members of his family there were with Mr. Davis at the time the arrest was made, Postmaster-General John H. Reagan,\n\niLetter of Dr. H. A. Tupper to Dr. J. Wm. Jones, dated Richmond.

At this point we will let Postmaster-General\n\nEeagan continue the thread of the narrative. Says he :*\n\n\"Tinder cover of the darkness, Colonel Pritchard (a Federal officer) moved to \"where \"we \"were, and posted one battalion in front of us and another across the creek in our rear, and each took the other in the dimness of the morning for Confederates. Both battalions were armed with repeating- rifles and a rapid fusillade ,occurred! between them, with the result that one or two were killed and a .few wounded. When this firing- 'Occurred the troops in our front galloped upon us. The Major of the regiment reached the place where I and the members of the President's staff were encamped, about a hundred yards distant from where the President and his family were located. Wlien he approached me I -was -watching a struggle between two Federal soldiers and Governor Lubbock. They were trying to get his horse and saddle bags away from him and he was holding on to them and refusing to give them up; they threatened to shoot him if he did not, and he replied--for he -was not as good a Presbyterian then as he is now--that they might shoot and be damned but they would not rob him -while he \"was alive and looking on. I had my revolver cocked and in my hand, -waiting to see if the shooting was to begin.\n\n\"Just at this moment the Major rode up, the men contending with Lubbock disappeared, and the Major asked if I ha,d any arms. I drew my revolver from under the skirt of my coat and said to him, 'I have this.' He observed that I had better give it to him. I knew that they were too many for us and surrendered my pistol.\n\n*Memoirs of John H. Reag-an, pp. 219-220, New York and Washington,\n\n1906. Senator Reagan lived to be the last surviving member of the Confed\n\nerate Cabinet.\n\n16 GEORGIA'S LANDMARKS, MEMORIALS AND LEGENDS\n\nI asked him then if he had not better stop the firing across the creek. He inquired whether it was not our men. T told him that it could not be; that I did not know of an armed Confederate within a hundred miles of us, except our little escort of half a dozen men, who -were not then with us. We learned afterwards that they, or the most of them, had been captured at Irwinville. The Major rode across the creek and put an end to the skirmish.\n\n\"When the firing began, President Davis afterwards told me, he supposed it to be the work of the men who were to rob Mrs. Davis's train. So he remarked to his wife: 'Those men have attacked us at last; I will n;o out and see if I cannot stop the firing; surely I have some authority with the Confederates.' Upon going to the tent door, however, he saw the bine-coats, and turned to his wife with the words, 'The Federal cavalry are upon us.' \" He was made a prisoner of war.\n\n\"As one of the means of making tloe Confederate cause odious, the foolish and wicked charge was made that he was captured in woman's clothes; besides whieh his portrait, showing him in petticoats, \"was afterwards placarded generally in show cases and public places in the North. He was also pictured as having bags of gold oh him when captured. This charge is disproven by the circumstances attending' his capture. The suddenness of the unexpected attack of the enemy allowed no time for a change of clothes. I saw him a few minutes after his surrender, wearing his accustomed suit of Confederate gray.\"\n\nColonel William P. Johnston confirms the PostmasterGreneral's statement in regard to the President's apparel. Says he:* \"Mr. Davis was dressed as usual. He had on a knit woolen visor, -which he always -wore at night for neuralgia; and his cavalry boots. He complained of chilliness, saying that some one had taken away his\n\nTJavis Memorial Volume, p. 404, Atlanta, 1S90.\n\nWHERE PRESIDENT JEFFERSON DAV1S WAS ARRESTED, ON MAY 10, 1S65, NEAR IRWINVIULE, GA.\n\nJEFFERSON DAVIS'S ARREST AT IRWINVH.LE\n\n17\n\nraglan, or spring overcoat, sometimes called a water proof. I had one exactly similar, except in color. I went to look for it and eitlier I, or S'ome one at my instance, found it and lie wore it afterwards. His own was not restored.'' Governor Lubbock testifies to the same effect.1 Mr. James H. Parker, of Elburnville, Pa., a Federal soldier who witnessed the arrest makes this statement:2 \"I am no admirer of Jeff Davis. I am a Yankee, full of Yankee prejudice; but I think it wicked to lie about him or even about the devil. He did not have on at the time he was taken any such garment as is worn by women. He did have over his shoulders a waterproof article of clothing, something like a Havelock. It was not in the least concealed. He wore a hat and did not carry a pail of water on his head.\" Mr. T. H. Peabody, a lawyer of St. Louis, one of the captors of Mr. Davis, declared in a speech before Ransom Post, of the Gr. A. B. that the hoop-skirt story was purely a fabrication of newspaper reporters. 3 So the whole affair resolves itself into some thing like the compliment which an old parson paid one of his deacons in the church:\n\n'' Said Parson Bland to Deacon Bluff\n\nSeated before the fire:\n\nDeacon, I like you well enough\n\nBut you 're an awful liar.''\n\n^bid, 408. \"Ibid, 40?. \"Ibid, 402.\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nThe Old Creek Indian Agency: Where a Forgotten Patriot Sleeps\n\nO N a wooded bluff, to the east of the Flint Kiver, not far from the boat-landing, where the stream at this point is crossed by the old Federal wire road, there sleeps in an unmarked grave what is mortal of Colonel Benjamin Hawking, one of the most unselfish characters known to American public annals. The grave of the old patriot is on land which formerly constituted a part of the old Indian Agency, in what was then the territory of the Creek nation. Colonel Hawkins was a polished gentleman and a man of letters. During the AVar of the Revolution, he served on the personal staff of General Washington; and, \"because of his accurate acquaintance with the French language, he became the official interpreter of his Commander-in-chief, in the latter's frequent intercourse with the French officers. He was North Carolina's first United States1 Senator; and, after serving for six years in the world's highest legislative forum, this scholar in politics, while still at the height of his fame, accepted from President Washing ton an unsolicited appointment as resident agent among the Creek Indians. Despite the earnest protests of his large and influential family connection, Colonel Hawkins felt constrained, from motives of patriotism, to obey what -he considered a call of duty, especially at a time when the nation's peace \"was gravely imperiled; and, for six teen years,--until summoned to his final recompense--lie\n\nTHE OLD INDIAN CREEK AGENCY\n\n19\n\nburied himself among savage tribes in the deep heart\n\nof the Georgia wilderness. Two separate localities in -this State are fragrant\n\nwith the associations of this great man. The first of these is Fort Hawkins, on the heights overlooking the Ocmulgee River, opposite the present city of Macon. But the period of his residence at this place was compara tively short; and he next located at the old Indian Agency on the Flint, where his permanent headquarters were established. Included in the latter reservation-- which belonged to the Federal government until 1826-- there were ten thousand acres of land, divided into two nearly equal parts by the Flint River. The official residence of Colonel Hawkins was on the east side of the stream. Here important conferences were held with the Indians; treaties negotiated and signed; and various matters of business transacted. It was also in the nature of an educational farm, where he instructed the Indians\n\nin the agricultural arts. Subsequent to the treaty of Indian Springs, in 1825,\n\nwhen the Creeks finally ceded to the State the lands which still remained to them in Georgia, the old Indian Agency was acquired from the United States government and a part east of the Flint added to Crawford County; and afterwards, in 1852, when Taylor was erected, the section lying west of the Flint was made a part of Taylor. Thus the old Indian Agency passed by absorption into the counties above named, between which it was divided into two almost equal portion's. Near the site of the old home of Colonel Hawkins is the Flint River ferry, at which point the stream is crossed by the old Federal \"wire road, for years the principal highway of travel between Macon and Columbus, and still used extensively by vehicles.\n\nMr. N. F. Walker, while strolling over his uncle's plantation, in Crawford County, not long ago, happened by the merest chance to come upon the grave of Colonel\n\n20 GEORGIA'S LANDMARKS, MEMORIALS AND LEGENDS\n\nHawkins. It was found in the midst of a clump of bushes. The walls of the tomb above ground had commenced to crumble and detached brick lay in confused heaps upon the ground. The ravages of time, re-enforced by long neglect, had made it a pathetic spectacle; but the identity of the grave has been well established by evidence. Since the burial-place was discovered the Daughters of the Revolution have made it an object of reverent care; but the United States government owes it to the memory of this pure patriot who, for the sake of his country, lived and died among the savage Indians, to erect above his ashes a monument which will serve to keep his name in green remembrance; and when the shaft is bnilt let it contain an inscription similar to the one which follows-- \"Here lies the body of Colonel Benjamin Hawkins, a soldier of the Revolution, a friend of Washington, a Senator of the United States, a scholar and a man of letters. As a mediator of peace, in a time of great national peril, he abandoned the delights of civilized society and, for sixteen years, dwelt among .savage tribes. To him belongs the crown of life, for he was faithful even unto death.\"\n\nThe story of this extraordinary man's career needs to be told somewhat more in detail, for no missionary of the Cross, embarking upon the high seas, was ever impelled by a higher purpose or consecrated by a holier sense of duty to exile himself from home and kindred and to labor in foreign lands for the uplift of an alien race of mankind. Colonel Absalom H. Chappell, in his \"Miscellanies of Georgia,\" tells of the effect produced upon his boyish mind, when, in the sum mer of 1816, he first heard the news that Colonel Hawkins was no more. Says he* :\n\n\"One morning, in the month of June, 1816, during the summer vacation of Mount Zion Academy, when on a\n\n\"Miscellanies of Georgia, by Absalom H. Chappell. Colu\n\nTHE OLD INDIAN CREEK AGENCY\n\n21\n\nvisit to my venerated grandfather, I was sitting alone with him on his front porch. It was the time for the mail rider to pass1 on his weekly trip from Milledgeville to Greensboro; and my grandfather, having sent for his newspaper in the tree-box, \"was reading it--the old Georgia Journal, founded by the Grantland brothers, which he enjoyed all the more because they were Virgin ians. He had not been reading long before he suddenly stopped and said:\n\n\" 'Colonel Hawkins is dead.' \" \"The words were scarcely meant for me. They \"were the involuntary utterance of the soul. Letting his news paper drop to his lap and resting his elbow on the arm of his chair, he sat in silence, with his head bowed upon his half open palm, neither reading nor speaking another Tjrord. I had all my life known of Colonel Hawkius. I had become familiar with his name as important in some way in connection with the Indians. But it was now evident to me that the man who was then resting in his fresh grave in the midst of the Indian \"wilderness, on the little knoll by the Flint, was greater than I had dreamed; and ever since then I have felt an nndying interest in Colonel Hawkins--an interest which my subsequent knowledge of him has only deepened and intensified.\"\n\nTo quote this same authority, in substance, but not in esa,ct language, the office of Colonel Hawkins was media torial. He was a peace-preserver, a peace-restorer; and as such he was dear alike to civilized men and to savages. Though he was the resident agent for the Creeks only, Washington's estimate of his character and fitness for the place \"was such that he made him general superin tendent of all the tribes south of the Ohio. He was an apostle of friendship--\"unlike McGillivray, who belonged solely and intensely to the Indians, and with whom hatred of Georgia was a virtue--unlike Elijah Clarke, who was wholly a Georgian, and was to Georgia against the\n\n22 GEORGIA'S LANDMARKS, MEMORIALS AND LEGENDS\n\nIndians what McGillivray was to the Indians against Georgia.''\n\nIt was neither penury nor embarrassment in his affairs, nor thirst for wealth, nor disappointment which drove him into the wilderness. It was his own large nature; and he rises inestimably in our view when we consider what he gave up. For he was born to wealth and was experienced front the beginning in all its advant ages in one of the best sections of North Carolina. As early as 1780, the Tar Heel State made him her general agent for obtaining both at home and abroad all kinds of supplies for her troops. Successful in this trust, she sent him repeatedly to the Continental Congress; and, when ISTorth Carolina entered the Union under the new Federal Constitution, he was chosen one of the first Senators and served from 1789 to 1796.\n\nIt may be well to state in this connection that before the new government was organized and whilst he was still a member of the old Continental Congress1, he had been detailed, without interference with other duties, to per form an important commission. At the close of the Rev olution, the adjustment of relations with the various Indian tribes became a matter of the greatest interest; and Congress appointed Colonel Hawkins one of the commissioners plenipotentiary to open friendly relations with the four great Southern tribes, the Creeks, the Cherokees, the Choctaws, and the Chickasaws1. With the last three tribes the commissioners succeeded in negotiat ing satisfactory treaties, whereby they placed themselves under the protection of the United States government and gave to Congress the sole power of regulating trade with them. The attempt to conciliate the Creeks, how ever, failed, due to entanglement \"with Spain by virtue of the treaty of Pensacola and to difficulties with Georgia. Finally, however, in the treaty of New York, in 1790, by a master-stroke of Washington, the Creeks put them selves in like relation to the government.\n\nTHE OLD INDIAN CBEEK AGENCY\n\n23\n\nThus it became a matter of the utmost importance to cultivate these Indians. Washington fixed his eyes on the long-known and well-tried North Carolina Senator as the fittest man to take charge of the well advanced work of conciliation and to crown it by becoming the per manent agent. His family--one of the most influential and numerous in the State--opposed his accepting this appointment. Every inducement on the part of friends and relatives1 was brought to bear upon him in vain. He recognized in the appointment an imperative call of duty; and, like the great Hebrew law-giver, he put behind him the allurements of wealth and power and turned his face toward the wilderness. Nor was it his own flesh and blood whom he undertook to lead but an alien race of hostile savages. He looked upon the work as his mission. He gave to it the best there -was in him. He not only accepted the appointment but he made its life-long duties a labor of love and a source of high moral and intellec tual enjoyment.\n\nHis master-stroke was the treaty of Coleraine, nego tiated in 1796. It was the much-needed supplement to the treaty of New York and it laid the basis for happy and harmonious relations. He studied the country and the people and accomplished himself in all knowledge pertaining to both; and here the advantages of early education bore fruit. He surrounded himself \"with books; and, in his self-decreed, official exile, he labored with his pen, telling posterity of the people among whom he lived. Most of his manuscripts perished in the burning of his home after his death; but enough \"were rescued to attest the importance of the work, and these have been con fided to the Georgia Historical Society in Savannah. Says Colonel Chappell: \"The interest which they once excited has long since become extinct, with the melancholy fortunes of the rude people to which they relate; yet it may be that, when ransacked and studied hereafter, in distant times, they \"will furnish to some child of genius yet unborn both material and inspiration for an immortal Indian epic of which the world will not tire.''\n\n24 GEOBGIA'S LANDMARKS,. MEMORIALS AND LEGENDS\n\nThe Creek Indians, under the proconsular sway of Colonel Hawking, enjoyed for sixteen years an unbroken peace among themselves and with the people of Georgia. Much was done to encourage them in the arts of civiliza tion. They were taught pasturage and agriculture, and these supplanted in a measure dependence upon hunting and fishing as chief sources of food. He sought to win them by example as well as by precept. He brought his slaves from North Carolina and, under the right conceded to his office, he cultivated a large plantation at the Agency, making immense crops, especially of corn. He also reared great herds of cattle and swine, and havingthus1 an abundance he was enabled to practice habitually toward the Indians a profuse though coarse hospitality and to bind them to him by loyal ties of friendship. The sanctity with which the Indians throughout the nation regarded his cattle was pronounced. \"Whatever bore his mark or brand was absolutely safe. Milk was measured by barrels and churned by machinery, and great were the outcomes; yet not more than enough for his vast hospi tality to whites and Indians and his regal munificence to his negroes. Says Colonel Chappell: \"Had the great pastoral bards of antiquity not sung and died before his day they could have seized upon these scenes and cele brated them in strains more wonderful than anything to be found in the charming bucolics which they have left us.\"\n\nBut at length there arose adverse influences so power ful that it was impossible for Colonel Hawkins with all his weight of authority among the Indians to maintain peace in the nation. The war of 1812 began to stir the embers. Great Britain, through her numerous emissaries among the Indians, by liberal supplies of arms, and by other means at her command, had been fomenting hostility among the north-western tribes, toward the United States ; and, succeeding along the border, she next\n\nTHE OLD INDIAN CREEK AGENCY\n\n25\n\ndirected her attention to the Southern and \"Western tribes. The eloquence of the famous Indian warrior Tecumseh was enlisted; and since he was himself of Creek lineage he succeeded in arousing- the residuum of suppressed enmity and in kindling' the hostile fires. Still it speaks in attestation of the influence of Colonel Hawkins that a large portion of the Creek territory, viz., the rich domain between the Ocmulgee and the Chattahoochee, was never the seat of War.\n\nThis exemption was due to the fact that the official residence of Colonel Hawkins, having been first on the Ocmulg'ee, opposite Macon, and afterwards on the Flint at the place still called the \"Old Agency,\" his personal influence was here much greater than further to the west; and the Indians within this belt became the fast friends and allies of the whites. For the purpose of protecting' them the friendly warriors organized themselves into a regiment of which Colonel Hawkins became the titular head but lie never took the field in person, deeming it wiser to place the actual command upon the uoble chief, William Mclntosh. Like McGrillivray, the latter was only of the half-blood in the civilization of lineage but he was of the 'whole blood in the loftier and finer traits of character. The result was that the few hostile Indians scattered throughout this belt merged themselves into the belligerent elements on the upper tributaries of the Alabama. There they stood at bay and fought and fell in many a battle uuder the blows of Old Hickory. Eventually in 1814, at Fort Jackson, near the confluence of the Coosa and the Tallapoosa rivers, Jackson received the absolute surrender of the crushed nation. The spirit of the Creek Confederacy was broken. Colonel Hawkins was profoundly saddened by the fate of those \"whom he had long cherished as his children. Undoubtedly it hastened his death.\n\nKven the three great friendly chiefs, Big ^Varrior, Little Prince, and General Macintosh were cut to the heart by the stern demands from \"Washington City, dictating\n\n26\n\nGEORGIA'S LANDMARKS, MEMORIALS AND TJEGENDS\n\nthe terms of peace and marking the narrow bounds of the vanquished savages. How much was taken from them and how little was' left to them, constitutes one of the most pathetic events in our Anglo-American and Indian annals. Big- Warrior, regarded as one of nature's great men, perhaps the ahlest of Indian statesmen, upbraided Colonel Hawking for having' persuaded him and so niany of his chiefs to be neutral in the war against his people. For years afterwnrd the story nsed to be told of ho\\v the big tears stood in the eyes of the aged Indian agent as he listened in silence to a reproach \"which he did not deserve but which he was powerless to answer.*\n\n*Big \"Warrior was so named on account of his great size. Says Colonel\n\nhe was not so corpulent as to be unwieldly or ungainly. In fact, his corpu lency added to the magnificence of his appearance. Tn person, he was to a high degree grand and. imposing. Tus-te-nug-gee Thluc-co was his Indian name. Colonel Hawkins first met him a.t Coleraine in 1790, and they -were\n\nplain but civilized style, and was a man of wealth.\"\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nBarnsley Gardens: A Lost Arcadia\n\nSIX miles from Kingston, Gfa., 'may still \"be seen the picturesque ruins of one of the most palatial old homes in the South, a sort of Alhambra, in some respects, not unlike the wasted citadel of the Moors. The locality is today Imown by the name of Barnslcy Gardens ; and standing' amid the pathetic remnants of this old estate once feudal in magnificence it is not difficult for the imagination to picture here a castle with ivy covered walls such as might have overlooked the Rhine or the Danube in the middle ages. The story connected with it is full of romantic elements. To a resident of Kingston who has often visited this historic spot we are indebted for the following particulars:*\n\nThree quarters of a century ago, Mr. Godfrey Barnsley, one of Savannah's captains of industry, decided to establish such an estate as he remembered to have seen in England, his native land. So he purchased from the Oherokee Indians 10,000 acres of ground in what is now the county of Bartow. Gradually he cleared away the forest and turned the red hills into cotton fields and built a stately manor house where it overlooked a magnificent sweep of country, reaching far back until bine hills merged into bluer skies. He then planted around it the famous gardens which for two generations have been a Mecca for pleasnre seekers and holiday excursionists in this part of Georgia.\n\nMiss Belle Eayless.\n\n28\n\nGEORGIA'S LANDMARKS, MEMORIALS AND LEGENDS\n\nTo embellish the gardens, rare trees and shrubs and plants were brought hither from the most remote corners of the earth. Some of these still nourish amid the decay into which everything else has1 fallen. Hemlocks and spruces from Norway may still he seen brushing the old terraces \"with verdant branches of evergreen. Scotch rowans glow with scarlet berries' in the autumn. Lindens and other foreign shade trees' vie with those of the native woods in adding picturesqueness to the naturally beautiful location; while great lichen-covered boulders, hauled by ox-teams from the surrounding mountain-tops, form rookeries on either side of the main entrance to the grounds. The drive-way sweeps up the long hill and around the box-bordered area which encloses a central fountain just in front of an embroidered terrace. Mr. Barnsley, like his forebears, built always \"with an eye to the future and did not hasten his work. So the Civil War came on before the interior of the house was finished and the gold which he had Bent to TDngland came back to re-enforce the coffers of the Confederate government.\n\nDomestic industries were fostered on this baronial estate of IVTr. !BarnsIey; for not only the manor house itself but the quarters' for servants and the small office buildings on the estate were constructed of brick made by slave labor from materials found on the plantation. The palatial old home place was divided into three parts --the central being two stories in height and surmounted by a tower. The main entrance to the hou.se was ap proached by marble steps. On either side of the hallway were spacious drawing rooms, libraries, and the like, with sleeping apartments above, sixteen in all. The right wing contained an immense dining room or banquet ball, on the first floor, besides billiard and smoking rooms, with kitchen, store rooms, and cellars below. The left wing was used for temporary residence purposes while the rest of the building was in process of erection. The owner was not to be deprived of any of the luxuries of life\n\nBARNSLEY GARDENS\n\n29\n\nmerely because lie lived in the country; so, on the tower, a cistern was built to which pipes were laid and a reser voir constructed in one of the chimneys to furnish hot water for the lavatories. Plans 'were also made for lighting the house by means of a gas made from resinous pine.\n\nIn the rear of the manor house is another terrace; and here we find a ghost walk, for a castle without a prome nade for spooks at the 'witching- hour of midnight is romantically incomplete. Just over the brow of the hill is the grave of Colonel Earl, a Confederate officer, who was buried on the spot where he fell during the Civil War. Relatives came to remove his body but they could get no one to dig into the earth, so strong was the superstitious feeling among the mountaineers; and even to this day the locality furnishes material for weird tales among the country folks.\n\nAt tine foot of the slope is one of the prettiest spots in which the imagination could possibly revel. It is the ivycovered spring-house set against the out-cropping gray rock. Inside a bold spring bubbles up and finds' its way out and across the fields \"where it becomes a good-sized stream. And \"who could wish better dairy products than the milk and butter cooled in such pure water? One can almost fancy here a sprightly Lady Betty presiding over the burnished vessels and scolding her maids for some trivial neglect; or more realistic still, Madame Barnsley-- nee Miss Scarlctt, one of the South's great beauties-- standing in the shadow of the half-circle of live-oaks about the door, directing her servants as does her grand daughter, the present chatelaine.\n\nBut Mr. Barnsley, in gratifying his artistic tastes, did not stop \"with plants and flowers for his extensive grounds. He was also an industrious collector of rare curios, objects' of virtu, costly bric-a-brac, and expensive orna ments. His mahogany dining-table--which was large enough to seat forty people--and Ms elegant side-board,\n\n30 GEORGIA'S LANDMARKS, MEMORIALS AND LEGENDS\n\nwhich was of equally generous proportions, were made for Emperor Dom Pedro of Brazil. The gilt library clock once belonged to Marie Antoinette; and an exquisite marquetry table, together \"with several delicate wood carvings, had bits of history connected with them. Over the dining room fire-place Imng a rare painting. Its wealth of color undimmed by several centuries and its resemblance to Murillo's Madonnas told of the influence of the great Spanish master; while a built-in vault con tained a quantity of family silver. In one of the bed rooms was a mahogany bed-stead of huge proportions, but the four eagles intended to surmount the posts stood demurely in a corner, for not even the high ceiling of this spacious boudoir would permit them to occupy the places intended for them, as guardians of the curtains' of yellow satin damask. Wardrobe and dresser matched the bed, all heavy, hand-carved and handsome.\n\nBut these, together with a quantity of rare old wine, were taken to New York a decade ago and sold, the deal ers paying only a. song for what was worth almost a king's ransom.\n\nToday the Last Sigh of the Moor seems aptly to fit the old place. Time has wrought fearful havoc. The Barnsley household has scattered to every continent on the globe; a cyclone unroofed the main house years ago; members of a vandal picnic party daubed tar over the front walls, while others amused themselves by shatter ing window panes; and the one time immaculate flower beds are now \"waist-high in weeds. It is \"well nigh im possible to maintain so large an establishment now-a' days, \"when labor for necessary \"work can scarcely be obtained for love or money; but rich minerals recently discovered on the property may yet provide the means not only for making needed repairs but for realizing the splendid dream of the founder of Barnsley Gardens.\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nShellman Heights: A Romance of Sherman's March\n\nO N January 1, 1911, there fell a prey to the devouring flames a splendid old mansion on the Etowah, near Cartersville, known as Shellman Heights. It crowned an eminence overlooking the river and represented an investment of s'everal thousand dollars, not a penny of which could be recovered for lack of insurance. Little survives to mark the spot; but associa ted with it there is a romance of the sixties surpassing anything1 which has1 yet been reproduced in the melo dramas. Shellman Heights was built in 1861 by Captain Charles Sliellman, and the first mistress1 of the mansion was one of the famous belles of Bartow. As Miss Cecilia Stovall she spent her summers at West Point, and there she became a prime favorite among the young cadets at the military school. Within the circle of her most devoted admirers' \"were Joseph Hooker and William T'ecumseh Sherman, both of whom were enthralled by the charms of this bewitchingly beautiful Southern girl. They were both handsome youths, and both destined to attain to high honors in the iron days of battle \"which were soon to dawn upon the nation. But she married a man from the South, much to the chagrin of her disappointed worshipers.\n\nYears elapsed. In the spring of 1864, General Sher man and General Hooker both halted at Shellman Heights, en route to New Hope Church where one of the\n\n32 GEORGIA'S LANDMARKS, MEMORIALS ANI> LEGENDS\n\ngreat \"battles of the campaign was afterwards fought. Oil approaching the mansion, which he was about to ransack, General Sherman \"was attracted by the pathetic wails of an old negro servant who sat at the front entrance and, in accents hysterical with grief and fear, repeatedly sobbed:\n\n\"O, Lawd, what's Miss Cecilia gwine ter do now!\" Catching the sound of a name \"which was once charm ingly familiar to his ear, there flashed across the old soldier's mind a vision of ^Vest Point, and in a tone of inquiry -which betrayed some touch of tenderness he asked: \"What is the full name of your mistress? Come, answer me quick!'' \"Miss Cecilia Stovall Shellman,\" replied the dis tracted servant. \"Why, that's my old sweetheart!\" exclaimed the man of blood and iron. Tearing a leaf from his note-book, the grim warrior hastily scratched the following lines, addressed to Mrs. Cecilia Stovall Shellman:\n\n\"My dear Madam--You once said that you pitied the man who \"would ever become my foe. My answer was that I woiild ever protect and shield you. That I have done. Forgive all else. I am but a soldier.\n\nW. T. SHBBMAN.\n\nOrders were immediately given to the soldiers to replace what they had taken, while a guard was stationed about the mansion to protect it from further molestation. Bveu iron will melt in the heat of a blaze fervent enough to soften it; and for the sake of an old love affair of his youth, the grim despoiler spared Shellman Heights. Sentiment often crops out in unexpected places. Now and then we find violets growing in the clefts of volcanic rocks. Sherman moved on. Later came Hooker, who learning the same particulars in regard to the owner ship of the mansion issued the same order to his troops.\n\nHEIGHTS\n\n33\n\nIt is said that another unsuccessful suitor for the hand of this beautiful Southern woman was gallant Dick Garnett, a young West Pointer, in charge of the arsenal at Augusta, then the girlhood home of Miss Stovall. To the handsome youth's proposal of marriage, the fair object of his affection was by no means indifferent. But the young girl's father did not favor this match. The lovers were forbidden to meet and the obstinate lass was finally sent to visit relatives in South Carolina. There was probably no objection to the young man him self. The best Virginia blood rippled his veins; but his profession was hazardous and his income small. Mr. Stovall wished to see his daughter wedded to a lord of many acres. In this whim he was gratified. While visit ing the Palmetto State, Miss Cecilia smiled on the suit of a gentleman to \"whom her father interposed no objec tion and whos'e means enabled him to build for his bride the beautiful old home on the Etowah. But the young officer whose suit she was forced to decline always remained true to his first love. He never married; and when he fell on the battle-field of Gettysburg, in 1863, the image of sweet Cecilia Stovall still ruled the heart of General Richard B. Grarnett, one of the bravest soldiers in the Army of Northern Virginia.\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nThe \"Lone Star\" Flag of Texas Woven by a Georgia Woman\n\nI T is a well authenticated fact that the famous \"Lone Star\" flag of Texan Independence was born on the soil of Georgia; and the beautiful emblem which, was destined to win historic immortality at Goliad was de signed by a young lady of Grawford County : Miss Joanna E. Troutman. The following account has been condensed from a brief history of tlie flag written by Mason's pioneer historian, Mr. John O. Butler, who was thoroughly con versant with the facts from the Georgia standpoint and whose story is corroborated by ail article found in an old copy of the Galveston News. Says Mr. Butler :*\n\n\"On November 12, 1835, a public meeting was held in Macon. Robert Augustus Beall, John Rutherford, and Samuel M. Strong were among1 the speakers who endorsed the claims of Texas. Lieutenant Hugii M. McL-eod, from West Point, addressed the meeting in a spirited appeal, pledging himself to resign his commission and to embark as a volunteer. He declared that what Texas needed was soldiers--not resolutions.\n\n\"Captain Levi Eeldey, commander of the Bibb Cav alry, presided, with Simri Rose as secretary. Colonel William A. Ward, of Macon, proposed to form a company of infantry to enlist in the Army of Texas, whereupon thirty-two gentlemen came forward arid enrolled as vol-\n\n\"Historical Record of Macon, by John C. Butler, Macon, 1879, pp. 131-137.\n\nTHE \"LONB STAR\" FLAG OP TEXAS\n\n35\n\nunteers. On motion, the cliair appointed General It. A. Beall, Colonel H. G. Lamar, Colonel T. G. Holt, James A. Nisbet, Esq., and Dr. Robert Collins, a committee to solicit subscriptions; and before the meeting adjourned $3,150 was handed in to the committee, Dr. Colling paying in cash the greater part of the amount.\n\n\"As the company passed through other towns en route to Texas other recruits \"were added. At rxnoxville, in Crawford County, Miss Joanna E. Troutman--after wards Mrs. Vinson--a daughter of Hiram B. Troutman, made and sent a beautiful banner of white silk, with a blue lone star upon it, to Lieutenant McLeod to present to the company at Columbus. The following is a copy of the letter acknowledging the receipt of the flag:\n\nCOLUMBUS, GA. ? November 23, 1835.\n\n\"Miss JOAJNKA :\n\n\"Colonel \"Ward brought your handsome and appro\n\npriate flag as a present to the Georgia Volunteers in the\n\ncause of Texas and Liberty. I was fearful from the\n\nshortness of the time that you would not be able to\n\nfinish it as tastefully as you would wish, but I assure\n\nyou, without an emotion of flattery, it is beautiful,\n\nand with us the value is enhanced by the recollection of\n\nthe donor. I thank you for the honor of being the medium\n\nof presentation to the company; and, if they are what\n\nevery true Georgian ought to be, your flag will yet wave\n\nover fields-of victory in defiance of despotism. I hope\n\nthe proud day may soon arrive, and while your star pre\n\nsides none can doubt of success.\n\nVery respectfully your friend,\n\nSigned:\n\nHUGH:\n\n\"This patriotic standard, made in Crawford County, by Miss Troutman, became renowned in the history of the gallant young republic as the first flag of the Lone Star State ever unfurled on Texas soil! As they were not permitted to organize within the limits of the United\n\n36 GEORGIA'S LANDMARKS, MEMORIALS AND IJEGENDS\n\nStates, Colonel \"Ward proceeded -with his followers to Texas, where they were organized according to regula tions. He gathered about one hundred and twenty men who were formed into three companies. These were then organized into a battalion, the officers of which were: \"William A. Ward, major; William J. Mitchell, surgeon; David I. Holt, quartermaster; and Henderson Cozart, assistant quartermaster. The captains -were: W. A. O. \"Wads-worth, James C. \"Winn and Uriah J. Bulloch.\n\n\"After several engagements with the Mexicans, the \"battalion joined the command of Colonel Fannin and formed a regiment by electing- Fannin colonel and \"Ward lieutenant-colonel. The regiment numbered five hundred and was stationed at Fort GoJiad. On March 13, 1836, the original battalion, Tinder Ward, was sent thirty miles to the relief of Captain King who had thirty men pro tecting a number of families in the neighborhood of a church at the mission of Befiigio. On the arrival of the battalion, they found Captain King surrounded by a larg'e force of Mexicans who disappeared on discovering that he was re-onforeecl. Afterwards, on leaving the mission, King, with his command, was captured and Trilled.\n\n\"Re-enforced to the number of fourteen hundred men, the Mexicans then intercepted Ward, who retired to the church. Breast-works were made by the battalion of pews, grave-stones, fences and other things, and the fire of the Mexicans was resisted for two days, -with a loss to the enemy of one hundred and fifty men, and of only six to the Americans. But the ammunition of the battalion was exhausted on the third day of the battle, when Colonel \"Ward was reHictantly forced to capitulate, sig-ning the regular articles according to the rules of war.\n\n\"It wa,s stipulated that the battalion would be re turned to the United States in eight days. Colonel Fan nin, in the meantime, sent four different conriers to ascertain the cause of Wa,rd's delay, each of whom was captured and shot by the Mexicans. The latter -were again heavily re-enforced and advanced upon Fort\n\nTHE \"LONE STAB\" FLAG OF TEXAS\n\n37\n\nGoliad. (See elsewhere an account of the massacre of Fannin's men, a large percentage of whom were Geor gians). Ward's battalion was included in this massacre, having been brought in as prisoners of war.\n\n\"From an old copy of the Galveston Neivs the follow ing account is taken: ' The flag' of the Lone Star which was first unfurled in Texas was borne by the Georgia battalion, commanded by the late Lieutenant-Colonel Ward, who with almost his entire command was massa cred at Goliad, in the spring of 1836, in what is known as 'Fannin's Massacre,' he being- next in command to the lamented Colonel James W. Fannin. The flag was presented to Colonel Ward's command as they passed through I^noxville, Crowford County, Ga., by the beauti ful Miss Joanna E. Troutman. It was made of plain white silk, bearing an azure star of five points. On one side \"was the inscription in rich but chaste colors : 'Liberty or Death'; and, on the other, the patriotic Latin motto: 'Vbi Libertas habitat, ibi nostra patria est.' \"*\n\n\"The flag was first unfurled at Velasco on January 8, 1836. It floated to the breeze from the same liberty pole -with the first flag of Independence -which had just been brought from Goliad by the valorous Captain Wil liam Brown. What became of the flag of Independence we do not know, but the beautiful star of azure was borne by Pannin's regiment to Goliad, and there gracefully floated from the staff. On March 8, 1836, an express arrived at Goliad from Washington, on the Brazos, offici ally announcing that the convention then in session had formally made solemn declaration that Texas was no longer a Mexican province but a free and independent republic.\n\n\"Amid the roar of artillery, the beautiful 'Banner of\n\n\"Wllere Liberty resides, the\n\n38\n\nGEORGIA'S LANDMARKS, MEMOKIATJS AND LEGENDS\n\nthe Ijone Star' was hoisted to tlie top of the flag staff, where it proudly streamed over tlie hoary ramparts and the time-shattered battlements of Ija Balria. But just as the sunset gun was fired and the usual attempt was made to lower the colors, by some unlucky mishap, the beautiful silk banner became entangled in the halyards and was torn to pieces. Only a small fragment remained adjusted to the flag staff; and when Colonel E'V-mnin evacuated Goliad to join General Houston, in accordance with received orders, the last remnant of the first 'Flag of the Lone Star' was still fluttering at the top of the staff from which first floated the flag of Tcxan Inde pendence.\n\n\"With the capture of Santa Anna, at the battle of San .Tacinto, the silver service of the wily commander was also captured, and some of the trophies of victory, including his massive forks and spoons, were forwarded by Genera] Rusk to Miss Troutman, in token of the regard which this Georgia lady had inspired in the stern, scarred patriots of the Revolution. On the meeting of the first Congress, the Flag of the Tjone Star was adopted as the flag of the Republic and the seals of office ordered engraved with the star upon them. The public recognition of the maternity of the first Flag of the Lone Star as be longing to Georgia was made by General Memmican Hunt, the first minister from the Republic of Texas to the United States.\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\n\"Little Giffen of Tennessee\": How a Famous Ballad Came to be Written\n\nI X the opinion of literary critics, ' * \"Little Giffen of Tennessee\" deservedly ranks among1 the most famous war ballads of the Knglish language. The author of the poem, Dr. Frank O. Ticknor. \"was an eminent physi cian of Columbus, Ga.; and in going the rounds of his country practice, he often amused himself by dashing' off spirited lines, not a few of which were written on the backs of prescription blanks. His poems while lacking perhaps in literary finish are replete \"with lyric fire and sweetness. Most of them are merely song-skele tons but they possess a rythm \"most captivating to the ear. \"Little Griffon\" was written during the last year of the war and the circumstances which led to the composition of the famous ballad are narrated in the following- graphic sketch from the pen of Colonel Charles ,J. Swift, a resi dent of the city of Oolurribns, and a prominent member of the Georgia bar. The sketch contains the first authen tic account which has yet appeared in print.*\n\n' ' After the battl e of Ch i ckama uga, th ere \"was con tinual fighting between the two hostile armies from Dalton to the Chattahoochce River. The pressure of the advancing' enemy was persistent, but at every stand he\n\nrticle published in the Colu\n\n40\n\nGEORGIA'S LANDMARKS, MEMORIALS AND\n\n\"was opposed by the stubborn resistance of the retreating\" foe, under G-en. Johnston, \"who adopted the tactics of the famous Roman general Fabius Maximus, in order to draw Gen. Slierman from his base of supplies. Gen. Johnston was removed in the summer of 1864, and the determination of what the final issne of his plans might have been has become purely a matter of speculation.\n\n''Gen. Hood succeeded Gen. Johnston in command. Subsequent to the battles of Murfreesboro, Cliickamauga, etc., the cities and towns which could be conveniently reached by train from Atlanta began to receive a great many sick and wounded Confederate soldiers. These increased as Johnston's army approached Atlanta, and the battles1 between Hood and Sherman caused every available building\" in these cities and towns to be converted into Confederate hospitals. One of these in Columbus was the old Banks building\" on the east side of Broad street, nearly opposite the fire engine house. One of the inmates of this hospital was a mere youth., so badly wounded in one of his legs, that gangrene had supervened.\n\n''Dr. Carlisle Terry, then and afterwards a leading physician of Columbus, was the g-eneral surg'eon in charge of the hospitals. Mrs. Evelyn P. Carter, Mrs. ~W. D\"Woolfolk and Mrs. Rosa N. Ticknor \"were sisters, \"who, with other ladies of Columbus, made frequent visits to the hospitals to minister to the sick and wounded. These sisters were the daughters of Major Thos. M. Nelson, formerly of Virginia, and related to the Byrds, Pages and Nelsons, who have been distinguished in the Old Dominion from the earliest Colonial days.\n\n\"In going through the old Banks building hospital, Mrs. Ticknor and her sisters came to the cot on which was lying the wounded youth. He was very young, and was wasted away to a mere skeleton, and so weak and emaciated that he seemed more dead than alive. Moved by an unusual sympathy and motherly tenderness that the sacrifice of war and the toll of battle should include\n\n* ( LITTLE GIFFEN OF TENNESSEE\"\n\n41\n\none so young1, they asked permission to remove him and to take him to one of their homes. Dr. Terry looked at the apparently dying\" soldier lad and consented to his removal but said somewhat sardonically to the visitors, that they would probably be put to the trouble of sending him back dead, in a day or two.\n\n\"Following- these preliminaries at the hospital, New ton Giffen was taken to the home of Dr. and Mrs. Ticknor, at Torch Hill, five miles south of Columlms. For days and nights the unequal struggle went on, between the faintest signs of life in the patient and the gangrenous poison which pervaded his system. But Torch. Hill was on the heights where the breezes were refreshing and the air pure and balmy, and there 'Tjittle Giffen' had a physician's attention and the gentlest nursing' from the host, her sisters, and others in this 'Southern home. When he had somewhat advanced toward, recovery he told them that he was Newton Giffen from. East Ten nessee, where his mother AY as still living; that he could neither read nor write; that since he had enlisted in the army he had been in eighteen battles and had been wounded seriously for the first time by the one which had brought him to his present affliction.\n\n\"Dr. Douglas O. Ticknor, son of the poet, is UOAV a practicing- physician in Columbus. To avoid seeming' anachronisms in the recital, this Dr. Tickuor will be in several places spoken of as Douglas. He was about six years younger than Newton Giffen, but as the eldest of the Ticknor children, ho well, remembers the request his mother and aunts made to take Newton from the hospital, and he has never forgotten his impression of Dr. Terry's manner and expression, betokening- the utter uselessness of the change to save the life of the patient.\n\n\"At Torch Hill, Newton's improvement was slow and protracted. \"When he was able to sit up and to prop himself on his elbow, he took his first daily lessons in\n\n4:2\n\nGEORGIA'S LANDMARKS, MEMORIALS AND LEGENDS\n\nthe art of reading and writing\". This latter accomplish ment enabled him to pen liis first letter to his mother fa? away in the \"wilderness of her Tennessee mountain home. The second letter was to his captain. The one written to his mother probably never reached its destination, but the one to his captain did, and the answer \"was almost literally as the poem has it. \"When Newton was able to get out of doors, he and Douglas Ticknor were good chums and companions. The latter recalls that Newton was very industrious, gave a great deal of a ttention to the wrapping of the apple trees to keep the rabbita from eating the bark, and that both of them went forth on occasions to pick blackberry leaves to make green tea. ])r. Douglas Ticknov describes Newton as having very light hair, fair complexion, of unusual tallness for his age, and very thin.\n\n\".Before he had entirely recovered, Newton received a letter from his captain urging him to return to his company at the earliest possible moment. On receipt of this letter, Newton made preparations for an immediate start. Tie bade a tearful fa re well to T)r. and Mrs. Ticknor and all the members of the family and promised, if spared, to write to them. His manly character and bear ing, his sincerity and gratitude left no room for doubt that he would write at the first opportunity; but no letter ever came. Hence the inference by those who were look ing for a letter from their former charge, that he had been killed in the first engagement after his return to the front. This is the only statement in the poem which cannot be positively substantiated. All others are actual facts--so much so, indeed, that when Dr. Ticknor wrote 'Little Giffen,' he road the first draft of it to Mrs. Ticknor and was about to tear it up, remarking 'it was too true to be good poetry/ Mrs. Ticknor interposed and saved the poem from destruction.\n\n\"On the morning- when Newton Giffen left Torch Hill on his way to his company, passage was taken on an old\n\n\"LITTLE G-iPF'Eisr OF TENNESSEE\"\n\n' 43\n\ngray army horse, Newton riding in front and Douglas riding behind. Getting' near to T3ull Creek bridge, about half way between Torch Hill and Columbus, they found the waters of the creek at flood height and covering- all the lower lands on the wide of their approach to the bridge. The old horse, getting' a little off the road where the water covered it, fell into a big' washout and in strng'gling to extricate themselves, both of the boys were mihorsed, and came near being\" swept down the stream and drowned. Douglas Ticknor and the horse got ashore on the side next to home. 'Little Griffen' \"was carried by the current to a point whore he gained a footing1 close to the bridge. Abont the time the excitement and danger was over, a negro drove up with a four-mule team on his way to Columbus. .FTe kept in the track of the submerged road and met with no mishap such as that to the boys and the old gray horse. With no other possession than his dripping and muddy clothes, 'Little Giffcii' climbed into the four-horse wagon and standing up \"waved a last fare well to his friend, Doug'las, on the other side of the raging waters.\n\n\"It is said by some that Xewton was wounded in the battle of Mnrfrecsboro. However, it is raore probable that he was wounded \\n the battle of Chicktvmauga, Sept. 10, 1.8G3. This would not be inconsistent with the order' of time belonging to the events of which the poem treats. The letter that Newton received urging- his return, was very likely co-eval with the general order by Jolmston for bis officers and captains to g'et every man back to his command who migiit be able to return.\n\n\"Many of the surviving veterans of the army of Ten nessee under Jolmston remember the urgency of these recalls. It is very well established that * Little Giffen's' name \"was .Isaac Xewton Giffeii, and that his father was a blacksmith. He was brought to Columbus in September, 1863, and left Torch Hill in March, 1864. The big- over-\n\n44 GEORGIA'S LAKDMABKS, MEMORIALS AND LEGENDS\n\nflow at Bull creek bridge was presumably from the equi noctial storm.\n\n\" Johnston took command of the army of Tennessee in December, 3864. Tlie winter having1 ended, the opera tions known as the Dalton-Atlanta campaign commenced in the spring, after this; and it is more than likely that in making* readiness for this campaign, 'TAttle Giffen' and other absentees received notices to return to the front. Dr. Ticknor was born in Jones county, Georgia, and in 1874, he died in Columbus, Ga., in his fifty-second year. He is buried in Linwood cemetery, in Columbus. Mrs. Ticknor is in her eightieth year, (1909), and is living- in Albany, Ga., with her son, Mr. Thos. M. Tick nor.\"\n\nSuch in brief is the history of this famous ballad whose exquisite versification has charmed the ears of thousands oil both sides of the 'water. The poem has been translated into numerous foreign tongues. Though written at random, in the nervous style of one whose time was largely consumed by the \"weighty cares of his profes sion and whose incense to the muses was offered at odd intervals, this unpremeditated song1 is nevertheless one of the gems of the war period of American letters. It is practically certain that Little Giffen fell in battle soon after leaving Torch Hill. The character of the lad, his promise to write if spared, the kindness which was lav ished upon him by devoted friends, the sense of gratitude which he must have felt for favors received, and the long silence which followed his departure, these preclude the supposition that he could possibly have survived the clash into which he again plunged. Doubtless he was numbered among' the unknown dead in one of the battles which occurred soon thereafter; but Dr. Ticknor has happily rescued the lad's name from oblivion and blazed it im mortally upon the heights of song.\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nJames Ryder Randall: Origin of \"Maryland, My Maryland\"\n\nI T is not the least among the favors which Fortune has showered upon Augusta that it was long the home of the gifted poet who wrote the immortal war-lyric: \"Maryland, My Maryland.\" James Kyder Randall was by destiny a Georgian. Though, horn in Baltimore, Md., January 1, 1839, he died in Augusta, Q-a., January 15, 1908. For many years he was an honored and beloved editor on the staff of the Chronicle; arid his ashes today rest in Augusta's beautiful city of the dead. Between the dates which measured his useful life he saw much of the world. At Georgetown, 13. C., he received his educa tion; he taught for a while in Poydras College in Ijouisiana; and then he drifted to New Orleans. On account of hemorrhages from the lungs he was mustered out of the service shortly after enlistment in 1861; but there was not a soldier in the ranks who possessed more of the fire of battle. lie resided for a brief period at Anniston, Ala., an industrial center, \"where he edited the Hot-Blast; but, to quote the Macon Telegraph, \"for Kandall to be at the head of a journal devoted to such hard facts as pigiron looks to us like putting Saladin to carving1 gate-pegs with a scimitar.\"\n\nHe was at o"
