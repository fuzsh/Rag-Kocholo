There is a possible link between variation of different lipid parameters and depression.\n\nAIM: The aim was to compare variation of different lipid parameters in Drug-naive major depressive disorder patients in comparison to normal subjects.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: This case control study was conducted on outpatients in Department of Psychiatry, GMC Srinagar. A total of 100 subjects which included 50 Drug-naive major depressive disorder patients and 50 normal controls, were included in this study. Data analysis was performed using SPSS 16. Continuous variables and categorical variables were summarized, respectively, as mean and standard deviation and frequency and percentage.\n\nRESULTS: There was a significant variation in mean serum total cholesterol (TC) and mean serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) between the two groups with significantly low levels for both these lipid parameters in study group in comparison to the control group. There was a negative correlation between severity of depression and serum TC (r = −0.710; P = 0.0001), mean serum LDL-C (r = −0.608; P = 0.0001), and triglycerides (TGs) (r = −0.289; P = 0.042).\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Drug-naive MDD Individuals had significantly low serum TC and LDL-C in comparison to control subjects. A significantly negative correlation was there between the severity of depression and TC, LDL-C, and TG.\n\nKnowledge of Electroconvulsive Therapy and Attitudes toward it among Medical Interns and the General Public\n\nBackground: Negative view and unfavourable attitude about electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is common not only in the general public, but also in medical professionals.\n\nAim: We aimed to check knowledge of ECT and attitude toward it among medical interns posted in department of psychiatry on first day of posting and in the general public. Materials and Method: In this cross-sectional study, ECT knowledge and attitude questionnaire was used to assess the desired knowledge and attitude in medical interns and general public. A total of 36 participants from each group were included in the study. Results: The primary source of information were books among the medical interns (in 75%) and media in general public (in 88.9%). Participants from both groups had more knowledge about the consent, procedure and side effects part of the questionnaire. Medical interns were significantly more knowledgeable than the general public with mean score of 16.58 ± 4.78 and 9.94 ± 4.82 respectively (t=3.74; P= 0.001). Similarly, the mean score on attitude questionnaire was significantly high for medical interns with mean score of 9.94 ± 4.82 and 0.83 ± 8.56, respectively (t=5.56; P=0.0001). There was a significant positive corelation between total score on knowledge questionnaire and total score on attitude questionnaire (rs=0.542, P < 0.001 and rs=0.446, P < 0.006) respectively, for medical interns and general public.\n\nConclusion: Although medical interns had more knowledge and positive attitude toward ECT than general public, lacunae still exists in them. Our findings suggest that by improving knowledge about ECT, attitude becomes more favourable.\n\nRare case report and brief review of literature: Marchiafava-Bignami disease.\n\nBackground: Marchiafava-Bignami disease (MBD) is a rare condition marked by demyelination and necrosis of corpus callosum mostly due to chronic use of alcohol and malnourishment.\n\nCase presentation: In this study, we report a case of 54 years old male presenting to psychiatry OPD with chief complaints of aggressive behaviour and fluctuating orientation since one day. Patient had history of alcohol consumption since 30 years with increased quantity since 5 years. On examination, patient had deranged liver function test, low vitamin b12 with presence of upper motor lesion and impaired mental status examination. Patient scored low on Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) test and Mini mental status examination (MMSE) indication mild cognitive impairment. MR findings showed low signal in central area of corpus callosum with sparing of dorsal and ventral layers showing “ sandwich sign”. On the basis of clinical, laboratory and motor assessment, diagnosis of Marchiafava-Bignami disease was made. Patient was treated aggressively with thymine and multivitamins along with anti-craving agents. Complete resolution of psychomotor activities in 3 weeks and resolution of lesions in the period of 12 weeks was seen. Conclusion: MBD is a complication of chronic alcoholism with various clinical manifestations which is often misdiagnosed and mistreated. But recent advance in neuroimaging has made early diagnosis of MBD possible & helps in early initiation of treatment. Recognition of the imaging features of MBD is essential for proper diagnosis.\n\nKeywords: Marchiafava-Bignami disease, corpus callosum, sandwich sign.\n\nRemote technologies for mental health evaluation and treatment have been used for over 50 years in the United States (US). Initial barriers to widespread tele-mental health included cost, reimbursement, regulatory, privacy, and licensure issues; lack of infrastructure; technological limitations and illiteracy; and resistance to change. With technological advancements, increased adoption of videoconferencing occurred within the US in areas with limited in-person access (e.g., rural areas, corrections) and at large institutions/academic centers at the turn of the century. Although earlier studies indicated high levels of patient satisfaction and reliability, hesitation and concerns voiced by clinicians limited the usage of videoconferencing as a mainstream modality. In March 2020, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak led to an accelerated adoption of videoconferencing for mental healthcare, due to strict social distancing policies enforced by the US government. The entire mental healthcare system adapted to offer psychiatric services through video platforms. Now, three years post-COVID, many of these changes have persisted and there is a gradual shift towards hybrid platforms of mental healthcare delivery, with many providers offering “virtual-only” care. Patient surveys have indicated high levels of satisfaction with care delivered through telepsychiatry and this modality has been found to increase effciency at a lower cost. In this paper, I present a review of the research on use of telepsychiatry in the United States, describe the current trends in adoption of telepsychiatry and discuss why the future of mental healthcare lies in the virtual domain.\n\nAssessment of burden of caregivers of opioid dependence syndrome : a cross-sectional study from north-eastern India\n\nBackground: Long term opioid abuse may cause significant physical, emotional, social as well as financial distresses that, in turn, can lead to a trail of problems or adversities in lives of not only the abusers but also their caregivers, which can be termed as ‘burden’.\n\nAim: To study the burden of caregivers of patients with opioid dependence syndrome and find its association with socio-demographic background of caregiver and clinical profile of the patient.\n\nMethods: Caregivers of 100 patients of opioid dependence syndrome attending Psychiatry OPD or admitted in Psychiatry ward of a tertiary care general hospital were selected by convenient sampling and interviewed using a self-designed proforma. Caregiver burden was assessed by using Modified Burden Assessment Schedule.\n\nResults: Majority (40%) of the caregivers reported to have mild burden , followed closely by severe burden (39%). Significant association was found between burden perceived and occupation of the caregiver. Caregiver burden was also found to be significantly associated with few aspects of patient’s clinical profile, like duration and route of opioid use, presence of hepatitis and history of prior deaddiction.\n\nConclusion: Our study found that caregivers of opioid abusers experience substantial burden, more so if the patient is abusing since long, or uses intravenous route, or has comorbidity like hepatitis, or is a multiple treatment failure, and also if the caregiver is weak occupation-wise. These findings indicate scope of future research in this area.\n\nSRI DEVARAJ URS MEDICAL COLLEGE, TAMAKA, KOLAR: NARRATIVE REVIEW: DEPARTMENT OF PSYCHIATRY\n\nAre benzodiazepines “steroid like” in psychiatric practice?\n\nDr MOHAN REDDY M, Dr MANO RANJITHA.V\n\nDuring the acute phase of certain medical conditions, healthcare professionals may prescribe the use of steroids or benzodiazepines for a brief period of time. The former is commonly used to alleviate severe inflammatory conditions, while the latter is often prescribed to help individuals experiencing acute withdrawal symptoms due to alcohol dependence syndrome. Both classes of drugs are for short-term use only. Prolonged use can lead to abuse, dependence resulting in mental and behavioural symptoms. Prolonged steroid use can result in medical complications such as high blood pressure and impaired glucose tolerance among many others.. Abrupt cessation of benzodiazepines can lead to rebound anxiety and withdrawal symptoms. Similarly steroids should be gradually tapered off over several days. In some cases, benzodiazepines are used to treat delirium tremens, while steroids are used to treat septic shock or anaphylactic reactions. Both drugs should only be used for acute conditions and carefully monitored. Benzodiazepines are best suited for acute psychiatric conditions such as panic attacks, while steroids are indicated for acute medical conditions such as septic shock or Bell’s palsy. In conclusion, it is essential to use benzodiazepines and steroids judiciously and not prescribe them for prolonged durations. Healthcare professionals must exercise vigilance in monitoring their patients for any signs of dependence. Short-term use of these drugs can provide immediate relief for acute medical conditions, but their extended use can lead to detrimental outcomes.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe nonspecific initial presentation and variable progression often create a diagnostic dilemma. Among these, subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is still present in India due to forgetfulness of childhood measles infection and timely vaccination.\n\nAims\n\nTo emphasize that SSPE is not rare but rarely suspected hence underdiagnosed and underreported through a journey of 5 children diagnosed with SSPE. Although no definitive treatment is available, an early diagnosis can reduce the expenditure of managing undiagnosed cases.\n\nMethods\n\nAll atypical cases with bizarre behavioral abnormality, movement disorders, myoclonic jerks, seizure, and focal neurological deficit underwent MRI, EEG, CSF examination, etc., to rule out mimics. The SSPE can be diagnosed if three out of five criteria are fulfilled.\n\n(1)\n\nTypical clinical presentation with progressive intellectual deterioration with signs of myoclonus\n\n(2)\n\nCharacteristic electroencephalographic (EEG) pattern\n\n(3)\n\nelevated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) globulin levels\n\n(4)\n\nelevated CSF measles antibody titers; and\n\n(5)\n\nbrain biopsy suggestive of measles.\n\nResults\n\nAll 5 patients were male with 15.40 ± 1.67 years of age and the delay in diagnosis was 2.30 ± 1.20 years. The most common initial presentation was behavioral abnormality and seizures. Patient 4 had neither myoclonus nor seizure episodes. MRI showed white matter changes except for patient 2. The EEG revealed periodic discharges except for patient 4. The IgG measles antibody in CSF was highly raised in all.\n\nConclusion\n\nDetailed evaluation with imaging, CSF, EEG, etc. is a must in any child with atypical features and to strengthen vaccination policy to defeat SSPE.\n\nA Cross-sectional Observational study of Sexual dysfunction and self-esteem in Psychiatric Patients.\n\nBackground: Sexual dysfunction is remarkably prevalent amongst psychiatric patients than general population. The commonest dysfunction among women is sexual desire dysfunction complained by around 30 % of women. The commonest dysfunctions among men are erectile dysfunction and premature ejaculation. Despite the importance and high prevalence of the problem, these patients do not inform the problem either due to feeling that they do not view it as a treatable problem.\n\nMethods: This was a cross sectional study which was undertaken in the Psychiatry OPD of HAHC Hospital associated with Hamdard Institute of Medical Sciences and Research, New Delhi. A total of 100 patients selected by purposive sampling will be taken. The data was collected using questionnaires. A self-designed semi-structured Performa was used for socio-demographic details. The Changes in Sexual Functioning Questionnaire was used to assess sexual dysfunction and Rosenberg self-esteem scale was used for assessment of self-esteem. Data were collected and analyzed using Microsoft Excel 2010 and SPSS software Version 28 (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences, IBM Corp, USA).\n\nResults: The study was conducted on a total of 100 patients presenting to Psychiatry OPD. The prevalence of Sexual dysfunction was found to be 75% which was higher among males (63%) than females (12%). Majority Participants with sexual dysfunction were found to be on Antidepressants (89.3%). Further analysis also revealed that significant association of sexual dysfunction was found with > 1 sexual partner (p value: 0.019), those with porn addiction (p value: 0.015), masturbation once a month (p value: 0.006). Statistically significant association was found between sexual dysfunction and low self-esteem with p value 0.001.\n\nConclusions: Higher prevalence of sexual dysfunction is an issue of concern in psychiatric patients and has possibly affected their mental health. Management Strategies are to be devised on a priority basis for minimizing sexual dysfunction in these patients. Prevention of sexual dysfunction will contribute to increased self-esteem and happy lives.\n\nASSESSMENT OF CORRELATION BETWEEN DISSOCIATION DUE TO KETAMINE AND ITS ANTI-DEPRESSANT EFFECT\n\nBACKGROUND: Recent research has seen low-dose ketamine emerge as a novel, rapid-acting antidepressant. Ketamine, an N-methy-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, leads to effects on the glutamatergic system and abnormalities in this neurotransmitter system are present in depression. The literature demonstrates evidence supporting a rapid-acting antidepressant effect of low-dose intravenous ketamine in major depressive disorder, in bipolar depression and in depression with suicidal ideation.\n\nAIM: To find correlation between dissociation and antidepressant effect of ketamine.\n\nMETHODOLGY: 41 patients diagnosed with major depressive disorder using DSM-5 criteria attending OPD and IPD department of the tertiary care centre with inadequate response to oral medications were selected for ketamine therapy and the effect of intravenous ketamine was assessed by applying Hamilton Depressive rating Scale before and after ketamine application. The dissociation was measured using Clinician Administered Dissociative Symptom Scale (CADSS).\n\nRESULT: No particular co-relation was found between the changes in HDRS scores and the CADSS scores.\n\nCONCLUSION: No particular association between ketamine’s anti-depressant action and it’s dissociative effect.\n\n“The Study of Nomophobia, Self Esteem and Satisfaction of life in medical students “\n\nPresenting Author:\n\nDr. Pooja sapovadia\n\nResident Doctor, Department of Psychiatry, Government Medical College & Sir.

Total 700 students studying in MBBS,doing internship and postgraduation in government medical college Bhavnagar were assessed by proforma containing demographic detail,questionnaire of Nomophobia(NMP),Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale(RSES) and Satisfaction with Life Scale(SWLS)\n\nResult: We found all participants were having some degree of nomophobia.Amongst them 63.29%student were having mild nomophobia,31.29%having moderate and 5.43%students were having severe nomophobia.There is significant association between nomophobia with self esteem and also between nomophobia and satisfaction with life.\n\nConclusion: participants with nomophobia are more likely to experience low self esteem and poor satisfaction with life.\n\nA Comparative study of burnout and resilience between clinical and nonclinical postgraduates\n\nDr. SAI PRASANTH P1, Dr. N. ANNAPURNA2\n\n1.Junior resident, Department of Psychiatry, Andhra Medical College, Visakhapatnam\n\n2.Assistant Professor, Department of Psychiatry, Andhra Medical College, Visakhapatnam Corresponding address\n\nDr. SAI PRASANTH P,\n\nJunior resident,\n\nDepartment of Psychiatry,\n\nAndhra Medical College, Visakhapatnam.\n\nContact: 9791595399\n\nEmail id : moc.liamg@62htnasarpias\n\nBACKGROUND :\n\nBurnout is a pervasive and debilitating state that results from an unsustainable period of overwhelming stress. Burnout in doctors can lead to reduced care of patients, increased medical errors, and poor health.\n\nResilience refers to the capacity of psychophysiological systems to recover from challenging conditions and allow the organism to efficiently return to its health maintenance equilibrium\n\nAIM :\n\nTo assess the resilience and burnout and to compare the resilience and burnout between clinical and nonclinical\n\npostgraduates.\n\nMETHODOLOGY :\n\nIt is a cross sectional comparative study done in 142 medical postgraduates, between 25 and 35 years of age. 99 clinical postgraduates and 43 nonclinical postgraduates participated in the study. They were given the printed hard copies of the resilience (Connor Davidson resilience scale) and burnout (Copenhagen burnout inventory) scale. The mean scores of personal, work and client related burnout and total resilience score was compared between clinical and nonclinical postgraduates.\n\nRESULTS :\n\nAmong the 99 clinical postgraduates, the mean scores of personal, work and client related burnout are 49.28, 47.99 and 42.17 respectively. Among the 43 non clinical postgraduates, the mean scores of personal, work and client related burnout are 43.99, 35.66 and 26.66 respectively. The mean values of work and client related burnout are statistically significant while the mean values of personal burnout are not statistically significant. The mean value of resilience in clinical and non clinical postgraduates are 61.43 and 60.74 respectively which are not statistically significant. There is a weak positive correlation between working hours and burnout. There is a weak negative correlation between sleeping hours and burnout.\n\nCONCLUSION :\n\nOur study showed that there was a higher prevalence of work and client related burnout in clinical postgraduates compared to nonclinical postgraduates, while there is no significant difference in prevalence of personal burnout. Also, there is no significant difference in resilience between the two groups. Furthermore, prospective, controlled studies are needed to investigate the risk factors for burnout and other mental health disorders among clinical doctors, as well as the effects of treatment.\n\nRehabilitation: concept of comprehensive care\n\nS.R. Adhikari1\n\n1Medical Director, Beautiful Mind Institute of Psychiatry, Kharahani-11, Chitwan, Nepal\n\nBackground: Integrated treatment of patients with medical treatment / rehabilitation and possibilities of social recovery is the cornerstone of current scenario in psychiatry. Patients with psychiatric disorders encounter many hurdles in multiple domains of life which are not at all related to psychiatric symptoms and its consequences.\n\nAims: Medical improvement does not necessarily correlate with functional outcomes. This leads to negative impact not only on patients but also on family members and create a “toxic social environment”.\n\nMethods: This presentation will be discussing rehabilitation concept, with reference to Nepal and world scenario. Presenters will also highlight validity of rehabilitation in currently changing world.\n\nResults: Most of current treatment modality in psychiatry is confined to what can be labeled as “medical model” focusing less on “rehabilitation model”. Evidence based studies have shown that rehabilitation and medical models can be complemented with each other with greater treatment outcome. Medical treatment will achieve biological improvement whereas rehabilitation will increase self-esteem, decrease burnout, stigma and boast empowerment.\n\nConclusion: Rehabilitation leads to recovery and patients can become important member of the community, society and country. Rehabilitation should be started along with day first of medical treatment in every patient.\n\nKey words: rehabilitation, mental illness, substance abuse, medical model, co-morbidities\n\nAddresses of author\n\nShailendra Raj Adhikari\n\nMedical Director, Beautiful Mind Institute of Psychiatry, Kharahani-11, Chitwan, Nepal moc.liamg@1791ardniyrakihda\n\n‘The Healing Canvas: Art Therapy in Psychiatry’\n\nArt therapy has emerged as a powerful and holistic approach in the field of psychiatry, offering a unique avenue for individuals to express their innermost thoughts, emotions, and struggles. This paper explores the transformative potential of art therapy as a complementary treatment modality within psychiatric care. Drawing from a comprehensive review of existing literature and clinical evidence, we examine the theoretical foundations, therapeutic mechanisms, and clinical applications of art therapy in addressing various mental health disorders.\n\nThe paper delves into the theoretical underpinnings of art therapy and the role of creativity in promoting self-expression and self-discovery. We also explore the neurobiological basis of art-making, shedding light on the emotional and psychological benefits of engaging with art.\n\nFurthermore, the paper provides an overview of clinical applications, showcasing how art therapy can effectively complement traditional psychiatric interventions across a spectrum of disorders, including depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, and schizophrenia. Real-world case studies and empirical evidence are presented to illustrate the practical effectiveness of art therapy in facilitating emotional regulation, enhancing self-esteem, and fostering personal growth.\n\nIn conclusion, this paper underscores the transformative potential of art therapy as a valuable addition to psychiatric treatment protocols. It emphasizes the importance of a multidisciplinary approach in mental healthcare and advocates for the integration of art therapy as an innovative and person-centred tool for healing and self-discovery. As mental health continues to be a global concern, understanding the role of art therapy in fostering psychological well-being becomes increasingly vital for clinicians, researchers, and policymakers alike.\n\nPresenting author: Dr. Bhoomi Raval\n\nSecond year resident doctor\n\nMail: moc.liamg@811lavarimoohb\n\nGuide: Dr. Gopi Gajera\n\nAssistant professor\n\nDept. of psychiatry\n\nPDUMC, Rajkot.\n\nComparison of Sleep Quality in Remitted Bipolar Disorder Patients and Healthy Controls: A Cross-Sectional Study\n\nSavitha S1*, Karthik Vangal2, Rajesh Krishna Bhandary P1, Samir Kumar Praharaj1\n\n1: Department of Psychiatry, Kasturba Medical College, Manipal, Manipal Academy of Higher Education, Manipal, Karnataka, India\n\n2: Institute of Psychiatry and Human Behaviour, Goa\n\n*Presenting author\n\nBackground:\n\nBipolar disorder (BD) is a recurrent and chronic disorder characterized by fluctuations in mood state and energy that affects around 2.4% of the global population. Patients diagnosed with bipolar disorder often have sleep related problems, even when not in an episode.\n\nAim:\n\nThe objective of our study was to evaluate the sleep quality in patients with bipolar disorder, currently in remission and compare it to the control population.\n\nMethods:\n\nIt was a cross-sectional, observational study carried out on 86 remitted bipolar disorder patients in the age group of 18 – 55 years of both genders and 86 age matched healthy controls. All the study participants had given a written informed consent. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) was used to assess sleep quality over the last month in both the groups. Data obtained was analyzed using SPSS Statistics 20.0. PSQI scores between the groups were compared using MANOVA, followed by univariate ANOVA.\n\nResults:\n\nThe total PSQI score was higher for bipolar patients as compared to controls. Subjective sleep quality and sleep duration were the most affected domains in the bipolar patients. There was a statistically significant difference between the two groups in all domains of sleep quality as well as in total score.\n\nConclusion:\n\nOur study found that patients with bipolar disorder have poorer sleep quality as compared to healthy controls, even when in the euthymic phase of the disorder. While all domains of sleep quality were affected, subjective sleep quality and sleep duration were affected the most.\n\nCategory: Free Paper\n\nPresenting Author: Dr. Savitha S\n\nAffiliation and Designation: Additional Professor & HOU, Department of Psychiatry, Kasturba Medical College, Manipal Academy of Higher Education, Manipal, Karnataka\n\nE mail: moc.oohay@namosahtivas\n\nPhone Number: 9845240653\n\nCo-authors:\n\nDr. Kartik Vangal, Senior Resident, Institute of Psychiatry and Human Behaviour, Goa\n\nDr. Rajesh Krishna Bhandary P: Associate Professor, Department of Psychiatry, Kasturba Medical College, Manipal Academy of Higher Education, Manipal, Karnataka\n\nDr. Samir Kumar Praharaj, Professor & Head, Department of Psychiatry, Kasturba Medical College, Manipal Academy of Higher Education, Manipal, Karnataka\n\nBACKGROUND:\n\nThe growing presence of social media in the lives of young adults and its effect on mental health among this population has garnered negative attention. Since there is a dearth of studies in the Indian setting, this study is aimed at determining the prevalence of anxiety and depression, along with its association to severity of social media use and the relationship between resilience and psychiatric morbidity in students.\n\nMETHODS\n\nIn this study, 334 students studying in various disciplines were recruited through convenience sampling. A study proforma for collection of sociodemographic details and details about their pattern of social media use was used. Severity of social media use was assessed using the Social media disorder scale. Beck’s Depression Inventory and Beck’s Anxiety Inventory were applied to assess for Depression and Anxiety respectively. Brief Resilience Coping Scale was applied to assess the coping strategies used by the participants. Data was collected, compiled, tabulated, and analysed using appropriate statistical software.\n\nRESULTS:\n\nPrevalence of depression was found to be 32.6% in the study population and 71% in students with social media disorder, and that of Anxiety was 14% in the study population and 27.5% among those with social media disorder.\n\nCONCLUSION:\n\nThe study indicated a higher prevalence of Depression and anxiety in students having social media disorder compared to normal population and a significant association was seen between resilience and psychiatric comorbidities.\n\nEfficacy of a brief group intervention program for hazardous drinking\n\nDr Harpreet Singh\n\nIntroduction: Screening and Brief Intervention (BI) is the most cost-effective method to reduce the burden of disease due to hazardous alcohol use. In delivering BI at individual level, trained workforce as well as time is a limiting factor. This study was conducted to assess the outcome of a brief intervention program delivered at workplace in a group setting for the participants identified with hazardous drinking.\n\nMaterials and Methods: Study was a pre- and post-intervention study without a control group. Following an educational lecture, participants were screened using the WHO ASSIST questionnaire, V3.0 version. Those who screened positive for hazardous alcohol use were given BI in a group setting at their workplace which consisted of two semi-structured sessions of one hour duration each. Three months later, the outcomes were assessed using a semi-structured questionnaire and ASSIST was reapplied. The analysis was done using the R-commander from R-software.\n\nResults: Fifty (55.6%) participants stayed alcohol abstinent following second session and another 22 (24.44%) had reduced both the quantity and frequency of use. Paired t-tests revealed statistically significant reduction in all secondary outcome parameters (ASSIST scores, usual dose in one sitting, maximum dose, and number of days of use in month). Eighty (88.89%) participants reported the program to be effective.\n\nConclusion: The study showed that brief intervention for hazardous drinking in a group setting can be a cost and time effective method requiring less trained manpower.\n\nImpact of Habit Reversal Therapy in Alliance with Mindfulness Based Therapy for Adolescents with Trichotillomania\n\nDr. Maria Madiha1 (Presenter) & Dr. Deoshree Akhouri2\n\n1Research Associate, Defence Research & Development Organisation (DRDO), Delhi\n\n2Associate Professor (Clinical Psychology) Department of Psychiatry, Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College & Hospital, Aligarh Muslim University, Aligarh, UP, India.\n\nBackground: The amount of psychological issues skyrocketed at the time of outbreak of COVID-19. Its impact is still felt across the nations. Trichotillomania, was one those many issues encountered. It is characterized by frequent hair pulling, hair loss, and severe functional impairment in the patient. Cognitive behavioural psychotherapy (habit reversal training or acceptance and commitment therapy) and medication are available as first-line treatments for trichotillomania. Over the years, numerous intervention strategies have been devised for the treatment.\n\nAim: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the impact of habit reversal therapy (HRT) with mindfulness-based therapy (MBT) for adolescents with trichotillomania.\n\nMethods: Adolescents between the ages of 10-19 years were enrolled for the study. They were diagnosed either by clinical psychologist or psychiatrist. Total 45 patients of trichotillomania were randomly divided into 3 groups; HRT+MBT+Medication group, HRT+Medication group and MBT+Medication group. Socio-demographic details and clinical profile were collected. Severity of trichotillomania was assessed using NIMH Trichotillomania Symptom Severity Scale, WHO Quality of Life was used to assess patient’s quality of living and mindfulness level was assessed through Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire. Total 12 sessions were designed for the intervention. For statistical analysis, ANOVA was used.\n\nResults: The results showed that when combined with habit reversal therapy, mindfulness-based therapy reduces the severity of trichotillomania. The obtained results also show the improvement of level of mindfulness among the adolescents.\n\nConclusion: It is easy to conclude that combination of HRT and MBT is an effective intervention strategy for improving trichotillomania.\n\nKeywords: trichotillomania; habit reversal therapy; mindfulness-based therapy; adolescents;\n\nA study of prevalence of depression, anxiety and individual differences in emotional reactivity and coping in Rheumatoid arthritis (RA)\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nRA is a chronic autoimmune disease causing inflammatory polyarthritis leading to disability and premature mortality. Physical limitations, including fatigue and pain have significant effects on mental health of these patients. Individual differences in emotional reactivity and predominant coping style may also play a role in causing anxiety or depression.\n\nAIMS\n\n* To study the prevalence of depression and anxiety in the patients of RA and its correlation with disease activity of RA.\n\n* To study individual differences in emotional reactivity and coping in the patients of RA.\n\n* To study the association between depression, anxiety, emotional reactivity and coping in the patients of RA.\n\nMETHODS\n\n100 patients diagnosed with RA attending the Rheumatology clinic in the department of medicine at a tertiary care hospital in Mumbai were enrolled. Rheumatoid Arthritis Disease Activity Index (RADAI), Hamilton Anxiety rating scale (HAM-A), Montgomery and Asberg depression rating scale (MADRS), Perth emotional reactivity scale short form (PERS-S), Brief COPE inventory were applied.\n\nRESULTS\n\nThe prevalence of anxiety and depression in this study was 24% and 41% respectively. There was a significant association between disease activity and prevalence of anxiety and depression. Negative emotional reactivity had positive correlation with anxiety and depression. Most of the patients (40%) had approach as their predominant coping style.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nOwing to high prevalence of psychiatric co-morbidities in RA patients there should be integration of medical and psychiatric care for their screening.\n\nSIDE BIAS IN DEPRESSION : A STUDY USING DICHOTIC LISTENING MEASURE\n\nSubodh Kumar\n\nDepartment of Psychiatry, Bokaro General Hospital, Jharkhand, India\n\nBackground : Side bias, the preferential use of one of the paired organs such as hand, foot, eye, or ear while doing unilateral activities of daily life, is considered to be an important indicator of cerebral lateralization. Findings of the studies generally showed an association between anomalous (left, mixed or reduced rightward) lateral bias and depression. No Indian study has been conducted using both side bias measures and experimental dichotic listening test. Aims: To examine and compare the pattern of side bias on measures of handedness, footedness, eyedness, earedness and dichotic listening test in patients with depression, their first-degree relatives and normal controls. Methods: Thirty patients with depression, thirty first degree relatives of the patients and thirty normal controls were assessed on the Side Bias Questionnaire (for handedness , footedness, eyedness and earedness) and verbal dichotic listening test using thirty pairs of consonant- vowel (CV) syllables. Results: Patients and their first-degree relatives expressed reduced rightward bias on handedness , footedness and dichotic listening test, and mixed bias on earedness in comparison to the normal controls. The observed gradient in the magnitude of left hemispheric asymmetry (right ear advantage) exhibited by the three groups on the dichotic listening test is remarkable. Conclusion: Dichotic listening measure may be considered as a potential neuro-behavioural marker of depression and used to identify the at-risk population of depression.\n\nAbstract for free paper: A comparative study of frontal lobe executive function in forensic psychiatric patients with history of homicide\n\nDr Sreeraj K V, Dr Rajin T K, Dr Shynu\n\nIntroduction\n\nStudies suggest up to 90 % of homicide offenders suffer from some form of psychiatric illness.\n\nStudying the neurocognitive characteristics of such individuals will help to formulate laws and treatment protocols for these patients.\n\nThis being the first Indian study will focus on frontal lobe executive function as frontal lobe dysfunction has been associated with violent behavior and homicide can be considered as a severe form of violence.\n\nObjectives\n\nTo assess the frontal lobe executive functioning in forensic psychiatric patients with history of homicide.\n\nMethod\n\nA case-control study with 25 cases( psychiatric patients with a history of homicide ) and 50 matched controls, matching was done by selecting subjects of same demographic characters, diagnosis and disease duration to that of cases but without history of homicide. The subjects were compared using Frontal Lobe Assessment Battery (FAB)\n\nResult\n\nCase performed significantly poorer than that of control group in FAB Score (p<0.001), with significant impairment in subset tasks of similarities and difference, motor-series, conflicting instructions and inhibitory control, and with no significant difference in subset tasks of lexical fluency and environmental autonomy.\n\nConclusion\n\nOur study concludes that psychiatric patients with a history of homicide have significant frontal lobe executive dysfunction which poses the question of whether these individual are completely responsible for their crime or not.\n\nModel evaluation for preliminary assessment of a Child in conflict with law at tertiary care centre\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nAfter Nirbhaya Rape case 2012, Juvenile Justice Act 2000(amendment 2015) argued that adolescents of 16-18 years who commit heinous crime should be tried as an adult or not, by the provision of a preliminary assessment [Section15(1)] on the basis of evaluation of their mental capacity, physical capacity, ability to understand the consequences of offences and the circumstances under which it was committed. However, its implementation is faced with many practical challenges, as there is no universal accepted model for preliminary assessment of a Child in conflict with law(CCL).\n\nAIMS\n\nTo suggest a model evaluation for preliminary assessment of a CCL at tertiary care centre.\n\nMETHODS\n\nA preliminary assessment of CCL is to be conducted through Judicial Magistrate order in the department of Psychiatry.\n\nAge certificate, Social Investigation/Background Report and statement of witnesses are to be provided by the Probation officer.\n\nDuring observation period, detailed psychiatric and psychological evaluation to be done which includes daily MSE with clinical history and relevant scales, age appropriate assessment of IQ, personality traits, cognitive abilities and drug abuse screening.\n\nRESULT\n\nAfter thorough discussion with psychologists, psychosocial workers and consultant psychiatrists, an uniform age appropriate model evaluation for preliminary assessment of CCL is made.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nThis is to resolve variations in the opinion regarding preliminary assessment of CCL and adopt an universal model in this regard. However, its practical application on enough study sample is an undergoing process.\n\nInflammatory markers in Depression and its relationship with adverse childhood experiences\n\nBackground:\n\nMajor depressive disorder (MDD) is a complex psychiatric condition with different subtypes and etiologies. Exposure to adverse childhood experiences (ACE) is an important risk factor for the development of MDD later in life. Evidence suggests that pro-inflammatory processes may convey this risk as both MDD and ACE have been related to increased levels of inflammation. In the present study, we aimed to disentangle the effects of MDD and ACE on inflammation levels.\n\nAim:\n\nTo study the association between Inflammatory markers in Depression and adverse childhood experiences.\n\nMethods:\n\nThe study included 100 MDD patients who were newly diagnosed. Current depressive symptoms severity were captured by the Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). ACE was assessed by using a Adverse Childhood Experiences International Questionnaires(ACE-IQ). After the clinical assessment, participants were divided into 2 groups: The Depression without ACE and Depression with ACE. A blood sample was collected from all participants to measure CRP levels. CRP levels were compared between the 2 groups after adjusting for sex, age, BMI, smoking, alcohol, and chronic diseases.\n\nResults:\n\nWe observed the highest inflammation levels in MDD patients with a history of ACE. Our study revealed that MDD patients with ACE showed significantly higher CRP levels compared to MDD patients without ACE.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThese findings suggest that childhood adversity promotes the inflammatory signaling and it leads to a depression. Accordingly, MDD patients with ACE who not responded for Antidepressants might potentially benefit from anti-inflammatory therapies.\n\nA cross sectional study on prevalence and severity of Depression, Anxiety and sleep quality in COPD patient attending Tertiary care center.\n\nBackground: COPD(ChronicObstructivePulmonayDisease) is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in India and incidence and burden of COPD are rising owing to increasing air pollution in cities of India. The presence of anxiety and depression in COPD patients is associated with increased mortality, exacerbation rates, lengthy hospital stay, and poor compliance to medications, decreased quality of life and functional status. Very few studies have made a wholesome description of frequency and severity of depression, anxiety and sleep quality among various severity grades of COPD. In this background our study aims to describe the prevalence and severity of depression, anxiety and quality of sleep in various severity groups of COPD.\n\nAim: To assess the Prevalence and severity of depression, anxiety and quality of sleep in COPD patients.\n\nMethod: 50 consecutive COPD patients visiting respiratory medicine department in govt. rajaji hospital Madurai were graded into groups A,B,E based on latest global initiative for COPD(GOLD)criteria(2023). The patients were applied with Hospital anxiety and depression scale and Pittsburgh sleep quality index scale is applied to assess anxiety, depression and quality of sleep.\n\nResult: Depression, anxiety and poor sleep quality found to be a significant psychiatric comorbidity across all grades of COPD.\n\nConclusion: Depression, anxiety and poor sleep quality being important comorbidity in COPD necessitating screening of all COPD patients (especially those with increased symptoms and frequent exacerbations) and prompt referral to psychiatrist for treatment are recommended.\n\nA CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY ON PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECTS IN AMPUTEES WITH PHANTOM LIMB PHENOMENON\n\nBackground :\n\nPhantom limb phenomenon (PLP) is a common entity occurring after the amputation of a limb and can be accompanied by serious suffering. Psychological factors have been shown to play an important role in acquisition and maintenance of pain symptoms. The circumstances preceding amputation and the irreversible procedure of amputation may contribute to the occurrence of symptoms of psychological distress. Depression and anxiety are common problems among patients who have suffered from amputation. Compared to other types of pain, there has been little research on the role of psychological variables in PLP.\n\nAim :\n\nTo evaluate the psychological effects in amputees with phantom limb phenomenon\n\nMethods :\n\nCross-sectional study on patients who underwent amputation and presented with phantom limb phenomenon in Government Rajaji Hospital, Madurai. Scales used are Body Distortion Questionnaire, MINI (Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview)\n\nResults:\n\nOur results showed that patients with phantom limb phenomenon have significantly greater rates of psychiatric comorbidities, including Major depressive disorder, Generalised Anxiety Disorder, PTSD, and Suicidal ideation .\n\nConclusion :\n\nOur study revealed that patients with phantom limb phenomenon exhibit significantly higher rate of psychiatric comorbidities compared to those without documented phantom limb phenomenon. Major depressive disorder, Suicidal ideation, Generalized anxiety disorder, and Post-traumatic stress disorder were especially common, and consequently a multi-disciplinary approach is essential for proper management and comprehensive care of these patients.\n\nOlanzapine induced urinary retention in a young female with Schizophrenia: A Case Report\n\nIntroduction:\n\nSchizophrenia is a severe mental disorder characterized by a mix of multiple symptoms: positive symptoms, negative symptoms, cognitive symptoms and so on. Olanzapine is an atypical antipsychotic with 5HT2A/D2 antagonism used in the treatment of schizophrenia. Olanzapine induced urinary retention is a rare side effect, even rarer in young reproductive age group females.\n\nCase Presentation:\n\nA 27 year old female brought with complaints of suspiciousness, muttering and gesturing to herself, abusive behaviour, impaired self care and decreased sleep since the last 5 years. She was admitted to the psychiatry ward. All baseline blood investigations: WNL. Patient had a past history of treatment with Tab Olanzapine and had shown improvement with it so the patient was again started on Tab Olanzapine (10mg) initially which was gradually uptitrated to 20mg. On day 10 of admission abdominal distension was noted from the umbilicus till the hypogastrium. USG Abdomen: Overdistended bladder pressing on the portocaval system. Surgery referral was done and Foley’s catheter was inserted post which the urinary output was 4 litres. Tab Olanzapine was stopped and the urinary retention resolved. Patient was then started on Tab Ziprasidone (60mg) and showed improvement in psychotic features.\n\nDiscussion:\n\nOlanzapine induced urinary retention as a side effect has received little attention. This case shows that the physicians should be on the look out for this side effect with routine renal function monitoring of the patients on Olanzapine.\n\nClinical profile and treatment outcome in patients on opioid substitution treatment at an Addiction treatment facility in Goa, India\n\nOpioids are the major drugs of potential harm and health consequences with more and more people getting involved in it especially from rural areas. The objective of this study was to assess the sociodemographic profile, pattern of opioid use, and clinical profile in patients with opioid use disorders.\n\nMethods: This was a cross-sectional descriptive study conducted amongst patients with opioid use disorder between 18- 65 years of age, diagnosed as per the International Classification of Diseases 10, who visited the district drug de-addiction centre for treatment. A semi-structured proforma was used to record sociodemographic profile and clinical profile.\n\nResults: A total of 60 patients were included in this study. The mean age of our patients was 33.8 years (SD + or - 9.57). Most of the patients were males (88.33%) married (50%) from nuclear families (56.66%) from rural background (70%) belonging to upper lower socioeconomic status (56.66%).\n\nMean age of starting opioid use was 27.2 (SD + or - 7.2) with heroin an opioid used in 100% of patients. Majority of the patients (58.33%) were using inhalational route, mean amount of opioid used 1.2 gm [SD +or – 1.09], with relapses on substitution therapy being 2 [SD + or – 3.49]. Most common coexistent use of other substance was nicotine (80%).\n\nConclusion: Young male from rural areas is increasingly involved in opioid use disorders.\n\nHeroin use has increased significantly particularly through inhalational route.\n\nA case series of harm related obsessions and summary of ERP\n\nDr. Susmita Sen1, Dr. Aditi Gupta2, Dr. Arka Adhvaryu3, Dr. Payel Talukdar4\n\n1.Junior Resident, RG Kar MCH\n\n2.Junior Resident, RG Kar MCH\n\n3.Senior Resident, RG Kar MCH\n\n4.Associate professor and HOD, RG Kar MCH\n\nBackground\n\nObsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a heterogenous condition where patients present with broad range of obsessions and compulsions, with a prevalence of 1.6% - 2.3% in the community. SSRIs and Exposure Response Prevention (ERP) are main treatments for OCD. Harm OCD is a sub-type of OCD characterized by obsessive, intrusive thoughts of harmful acts towards oneself or others and active avoidance towards the same.\n\nAims\n\nTo observe treatment response to ERP and pharmacotherapy combined, in patients presenting with harm related obsessions.\n\nMethods\n\n5 patients taken from inpatient department and presenting with harm related obsessions. Case histories and evolution of symptoms (YBOCS & MADRS) along with management and treatment outcome discussed. Review of literature on harm OCD discussed.\n\nResults\n\nOut of 5 patients, 4 were females, giving female: male ratio of 4:1, with mean age of 26.4 years belonging to lower-middle SES. Mean total duration of illness is 14.4 months. All five patients presented with secondary features of anxiety and depression, two had suicidal ideation with multiple attempts of suicide. Three patients given T. Fluoxetine titrated upto 80 mg, two received T. Fluvoxamine titrated upto 200 mg. Augmentation with Tablet Risperidone(2mg) done for two patients. ERP (16 sessions) was given. >50% improvement in symptoms as well as insight after 6 months of combined therapy.\n\nConclusion\n\nResponse of ERP combined with pharmacotherapy was encouraging in the patients, showing efficacy of ERP in harm related obsessions. More studies needed to illustrate efficacy, safety and novelty of combined therapy in harm related obsessions.\n\nNeuroleptic Malignant Syndrome with Atypical Antipsychotics: A Rare Case Series\n\nBackground:\n\nNeuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) is rare but potentially most serious adverse response usually observed with the use of first-generation antipsychotics. NMS having an incidence rate of 0.01% to 3.2% in patients taking neuroleptic medications is characterised by hyperthermia, muscle rigidity, altered consciousness and dysautonomia. Atypical antipsychotics exhibit improved efficacy and safety when compared to conventional first-generation anti psychotics because of their pharmacologic modifications.\n\nAims:\n\nTo highlight the need to examine the patients on ‘atypical’ antipsychotics for fatal side effects like Neuroleptic malignant syndrome.\n\nMethods:\n\nIn this case series we observed three cases of Schizophrenia on atypical antipsychotics with NMS. The clinical progression and treatment of the cases have been discussed.\n\nResults:\n\nIn our case series, we evaluated three patients belonging to 20-30 years age group, two female and one male diagnosed with Schizophrenia of which one patient was on T. olanzapine(10mg/day) and other two patients on T. Aripiprazole 15mg & 20 mg/day respectively. All of these patients presented with symptoms of high fever, muscle rigidity, elevated creatine kinase and was diagnosed to be NMS within an average duration of one week of starting SGAs. Antipsychotics were immediately stopped and they were treated with tapering dose of T. Lorazepam, T. Bromocriptine 7.5mg/day and supportive therapy. The symptoms resolved within an average duration of 2 weeks.\n\nConclusion:\n\nIt is important to clinically suspect and stay vigilant even under therapeutic management with atypical antipsychotics for the signs and symptoms of NMS.\n\ndelusion of pregnancy\n\nDR.JITENDRA KUMAR DR.

NEHA RAMSINGHANI\n\nNETAJI SUBHASH CHANDRA BOSE MEDICAL COLLEGE JABALPUR\n\nBackground-\n\nA shared psychotic disorder is a system of delusions shared by two or more individuals.\n\nShared psychotic disorders typically develop in pairs or groups with a close relationship who are socially isolated.\n\nThe function and affect of those inflicted with shared psychotic disorders usually remain intact.\n\nAim-\n\nHow to diagnose and manage shared psychosis.\n\nMethod-\n\nIt is a Case report of daughter of schizophrenic mother who has shared psychotic disorder with belief of delusion of pregnancy.\n\nResult-\n\nShared psychotic disorder is seldom identified, diagnosed, and treated.\n\nThis case describes a shared psychotic disorder incidentally discovered in a medical unit.\n\nShared psychotic disorder (Folie a deux), is a rarely seen and poorly understood psychiatric disorder.\n\nConclusion-\n\nIt is characterized by the transfer of delusional belief from one (primary patient) , who is already suffering from a psychotic disorder to another person, ( the secondary patient) .\n\nIt is easily misdiagnosed and bigger challenge for management .\n\nThe treatment for shared psychotic disorders involves separation of the individuals and pharmacotherapy with antipsychotics.\n\nABSTARCT FOR FREE PAPER: Dependent personality disorders complicating comorbid mental illnesses\n\nDr Neeraj Zambare1, Dr Anuraag Aedma2, Dr Shalin Aghera3, Brig (Dr) P S Bhat (Retd) 4\n\n1,3 Junior Resident\n\n2Assistant Professor\n\n4Professor& HOD\n\nPresenting Author: Dr Neeraj Zambare\n\nJunior Resident\n\nDept of Psychiatry\n\nRural Medical College, Loni, Maharashtra-413736\n\nContact details: Dr Neeraj Zambare\n\nMobile: 9987301521\n\nEmail: moc.liamg@jareenerabmaz\n\nConflict of Interest: Nil\n\nWords: 239\n\nDependent personality disorders complicating comorbid mental illnesses\n\nDr Neeraj Zambare, Dr Anuraag Aedma, Dr Shalin Aghera, Brig (Dr) P S Bhat (Retd)\n\nBackground:\n\nPersonality disorders such as Dependent personality disorder have shown limited academic development in terms of its contribution as a condition associated with various mental illnesses. In many instances, an underlying personality disorder complicates both presentation and management of other mental illnesses in the patient.\n\nAim:\n\nTo discuss impact of Dependent personality disorder on comorbid longstanding adjustment disorder.\n\nCase vignette:\n\nA 34-year-old mother of two children from low socioeconomic status brought by relatives with history of childlike behavior of recent onset in the background of rebuke by a family elder. There was longstanding history for more than two decades in the form of multiple episodes of emotional breakdown and behavioural abnormality whenever faced with significant stressors, seeking reassurance repeatedly, not assuming responsible role functions, feeling excessively vulnerable leading to even separation from spouse. Physical examination was unremarkable. In the ward she exhibited irritability, inadequate selfcare, extreme clinging tendency, excessive tearfulness and deranged bio drives. Psychometry revealed high scores on dependent and anxiety traits. Managed with antidepressants, psychotherapy focusing on to change the negative thoughts and motivating to engage in more independent behaviours.\n\nConclusion:\n\nPresence of Dependent Personality Traits or Disorder makes the individual highly vulnerable to breakdown in the face of any significant life stressors. A high index of suspicion and detailed history taking coupled with appropriate psychometry will help in understanding the individual better and helps in providing illness specific interventions.\n\nABSTARCT FOR FREE PAPER: Depersonalization Derealization Disorder: Report on a case study and challenges in management\n\nDr Aboobacker Alphy K H1, Dr Shalin Aghera2, Dr Anil Korade3, Dr (Brig)P S Bhat (Retd)4\n\n1,2Junior Resident\n\n3Associate Professor\n\n4Professor & HOD\n\nPresenting Autor: Dr Aboobacker Alphy K H\n\nJunior Resident\n\nDept of Psychiatry\n\nRural Medical College, Loni, Maharashtra-413736\n\nContact details: Dr Aboobacker Alphy K H\n\nMobile: 8884545918\n\nEmail: moc.liamg@1002rekcaboobayhpla\n\nConflict of Interest: Nil\n\nWords: 250\n\nDepersonalization Derealization Disorder: Report on a case study and challenges in management\n\nDr Aboobacker Alphy K H, Dr Shalin Aghera, Dr Anil Korade, Dr (Brig)P S Bhat(Retd)\n\nBackground:\n\nDepersonalisation-derealisation disorder(DP/DR) is a distressing clinical condition with a pathophysiology that is not yet well understood. It is an alteration in the perception or experience of the self and the environment. In the management of this disorder, various approaches have been tried in small studies.\n\nAim:\n\nTo discuss DP/DR in the context of different management strategies across the literature, challenges in the management and approach to a case of DP/DR which showed satisfactory response.\n\nCase vignette:\n\nA 21-year-old male initially presented with complaints of repetitive thinking, excessive analysis of trivial things resulting in anxiety of about few months duration. He had family history of major psychiatric illness, anankastic traits, high score on Y-BOCS scale and initially managed with Fluvoxamine. Initial symptoms started improving but expressed strong feelings of unrealness around him that was changing in quality, as if his reactions were not of him, had become emotionally numb and was in severe distress. His Cambridge depesonalisation score was very high. Lamotrigine was added to the regime for which he gradually responded over the weeks.\n\nConclusion:\n\nIn the management of DP/DR, various approaches have been tried in small studies, with mixed results. One of the few pharmacological treatments that has shown some efficacy in recent clinical studies is the combination of SSRI with the mood stabilizer lamotrigine. In our case, we managed with a combination of Fluvoxamine with Lamotrigine along with other supportive measures and achieved satisfactory response.\n\nIntensive Care Unit stress and burnout among healthcare workers\n\nBackground\n\nWorking in an intensive care unit (ICU) environment is known to be stressful. For all ICU healthcare workers more than the physical work, it is the psychological factor of dealing with the seriously ill patients which leads to huge mental stress. This stress when persisting for quite some time can lead to burnout, which in turn can cause a decreased personal well-being, increased absenteeism, more mistakes and ultimately compromised patient care. Most studies from western countries have tried to correlate the level of stress and burnout but have not clearly elucidated the reasons for them.\n\nAims\n\nTo study stress and burnout among Healthcare workers in Intensive Care Unit (I.C.U.)\n\nMethods\n\nThis will be a cross sectional study, the sample taken will include all doctors (Faculties, Senior Residents and Junior residents) and nurses working in the I.C.U. of Santosh Medical College and Hospital, Ghaziabad by using sample size 62 by using the following psychiatric scales:\n\nSemi structured proforma for Socio demographic data\n\nCohen Perceived Stress Scale\n\nMaslach Burnout Inventory Scale (MBI)\n\nResults\n\nAs per the data collected, positive correlation between MBI and Cohen Scale has been established with a p value of >0.01 ( 0.036).\n\nConclusion\n\nThe degree of burnout among critical care providers is significantly correlated with both job satisfaction and stress levels. To avoid burnout, there should be a strong recommendation to reduce stress-causing factors and boost employee job satisfaction.\n\nEffect of excessive mobile phone use on IQ of children: A cohort study\n\nApoorva Nair1, Bageshree Seth2, Revathi N2, Parineeta Samant3, Indra Vijay Singh1, Sayali Mokal1, Vasant Bhasma1, Maninder Singh Setia1\n\n1MGM Institute of Health Sciences, Navi Mumbai, India\n\n2Dept of Paediatrics, MGM Medical College, Navi Mumbai, India\n\n3Dept of Biochemistry, MGM Medical College, Navi Mumbai, India\n\nBackground: Excessive use of cell phones has been linked to poor attention, memory, concentration, and cognitive functioning. It is also associated with various health issues such as headaches, poor sleeping patterns, and fatigue.\n\nAim: To study the association between mobile phone use and IQ in children 2-5 years of age.\n\nMethods: We present data from 64 children; IQ was assessed using the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scales-5 © (PRO-ED Inc, 2003). We assessed verbal IQ, non-verbal IQ, and full-scale IQ. The age at which children started using mobile phones and the hours of mobile use per day were recorded.\n\nResults: The mean (SD) age of children was 53.4(6.4) months and the median hours (IQR) of mobile use was 1.5(1.0, 2.75). The median age for initiating mobile use was 18(12, 30) months. The proportion of children with below-average verbal IQ was significantly higher in those with longer hours of mobile use (13.8% vs. 0%; p=0.037). Similarly, fluid reasoning (13.8% vs. 0%; p=0.037) and quantitative reasoning (17.2% vs. 0%; p=0.016) were significantly below average in these children. There was a negative correlation between total duration of mobile use (in months) and non-verbal IQ (r=-0.19, p=0.15), verbal IQ (r=-0.10, p=0.45), and full-scale IQ (r=-0.14, p=0.28) scores.\n\nConclusion: This study shows that longer hours of mobile use are significantly associated with poorer verbal, fluid reasoning, and quantitative reasoning scores in children. Adequate restriction of the use of mobile phones and cognitive monitoring of children is recommended; as excessive use is likely to affect children’s mental capacity.\n\nAssociation between mobile phone use and neurodevelopment in children: A cohort study\n\nApoorva Nair1, Revathi N2, Bageshree Seth2, Parineeta Samant3, Indra Vijay Singh1, Sayali Mokal1, Chandrakant Ughade1, Maninder Singh Setia1\n\n1MGM Institute of Health Sciences, Navi Mumbai, India\n\n2Dept of Paediatrics, MGM Medical College, Navi Mumbai, India\n\n3Dept of Biochemistry, MGM Medical College, Navi Mumbai, India\n\nBackground: Exposure to radiation from cell phone towers and mobile phone use may be associated with health problems such as sleep disturbances and headaches. Excessive screen time in children is also associated with developmental delays in children.\n\nAim: To study the association between mobile phone use and neurodevelopmental parameters in children 2-5 years of age.\n\nMethods: We present data from a cohort of 204 children. We assessed the level of radiation in the homes, mobile phone use, and the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) of the mobile phone. We evaluated the development of these children using the Ages and Stages Questionnaire-3 © (2015 by Paul H. Brookes Publishing Co., Inc.)\n\nResults: The mean (SD) age of children was 41.6 (10.0) months. The median (IQR) daily mobile phone use by children was 1.5 (0.5, 2.5) hours. The median (IQR) age of initiation of mobile phone use was 24 (12, 30) months. The median (IQR) SAR value was 1.16 (0.86, 1.60) W/kg. The proportion of children with communication problems was significantly higher in those with longer (>median hours) daily mobile phone use (15.6% vs. 3.6%; p=0.003). Similarly, personal-social problems were significantly higher in this group (18.5% vs. 7.2%’ p=0.015). Though gross motor (15.2% vs. 7.2%; p=0.068), fine motor (7.6% vs. 2.7%; p=0.10), problem-solving (25.0% vs. 18.9%; p=0.30), and social-emotional (17.4% vs 10.8%; p=0.18) problems were also higher, the difference was not statistically significant.\n\nConclusion: Strict adherence to screen time guidelines and closely monitored neurodevelopmental parameters is required for optimal cognitive and developmental outcomes.\n\nABSTRACT FOR PAPER PRESENTATION PREVALENCE OF DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY AMONG CANCER PATIENTS IN SOUTHERN RAJASTHAN.\n\n1-Dr Anurag Kaur Brar, Junior resident, Department of Psychiatry, AIIMS, Udaipur.\n\n2-Dr. ROHIT DOMINIC JAWAHAR REBELLO (MBBS, MD (RADIATION ONCOLOGY),\n\nDM-(MEDICAL ONCOLOGY), HEAD: DEPARTMENT OF MEDICAL ONCOLOGY, AIIMS Udaipur.\n\n3-Dr Abdul Sajid Mansoori, Associate Professor, Department of Psychiatry, AIIMS Udaipur.\n\nBACKGROUND:\n\nAnxiety and depression are the most common psychiatric disorders among patients with malignant cancer. Presence of depression and anxiety complicates the treatment outcomes due to poor adherence to treatment regimes.\n\nMETHODOLOGY:\n\nA cross sectional study was conducted on cancer patients of either sex presenting to AIIMS Udaipur, psychiatry department and oncology department. The participants were given liberal verbalexplanations and description about the topic of research. After obtaining informed written consent, semi-structured proforma was used to record socio-demographic data of patients. HAM-A and HAM-D were applied by the principal investigator.\n\nRESULTS\n\nThe questionnaires were completed by 30 patients receiving cancer outpatient care. The patients’ mean age was 52.57 years. The majority of the patients (n = 19; 63.33%) were older than 50 years. Males (n = 17; 56.67%) outnumbered the females (n = 13; 43.33%). A little under half (n = 14; 46.67%) of the patients had GAD or a depressive disorder as their primary psychiatric morbidity. In comparison to GAD (n = 11; 36.67%), depression (n = 13; 43.33%) was slightly more common. Only a small number of patients (n = 2, 6.67%) had severe depression and most patients (n = 10, 33.33%) had moderate depression. 61.5% patients met the criteria for both depressive disorders and GAD.\n\nCONCLUSION:\n\nDepression and anxiety can erode one’s ability to adhere to treatment plans, manage symptoms effectively, and engage in healthy lifestyle behaviors. It can exacerbate the severity of physical symptoms, increase healthcare utilization, and ultimately contribute to a lower quality of life.\n\nPrevalence of eating disorder and its association with depression, anxiety & stress in medical and paramedical students\n\nBackground:Eating disorders cause serious, disabling, life-threatening mental health burden that significantly reduce physical health and interfere with psychosocial functioning which often go unnoticed. Eating disorders are caused by poor body image, body weight, and eating habits along with psychological attributes which play a significant role in the development and persistence of the disorder. Paradox lies in the fact that medical and paramedical students who are otherwise connected to the subject of health sciences are significantly susceptible to eating disorders.\n\nAims: to evaluate the nature and extent of eating disorders and its association with depression, anxiety and stress in medical and paramedical students.\n\nMethods: This will be a cross sectional study, the samples taken will include students of both medical and paramedical fields-MBBS, PG, BOT, BPT & GNM of a medical college in Ghaziabad using sample size of 100 using the following scales:\n\nSemi-structured socio demographic data Performa\n\nEating Aptitude Test- 26 (EAT-26)\n\nDepression, Anxiety, Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21)\n\nResults: Positive correlation found between EAT 26 and DASS-21 established with p value <0.01 establishing a greater association of eating disorders with depression, anxiety and stress.\n\nConclusion: Data found that eating disorders are prevailing among the students of Ghaziabad and have significant effect on their mental and physical health.\n\na rare case of multiple neurocysticercosis presenting with depressive symptoms\n\nIntroduction – neurocysticercosis, the most common type of neuroparasitosis, is a condition in which the central nervous system (CNS) is infested with the pork tapeworm Taenia solium cysticercosis larvae. A variety of psychiatric problems induced by neurocysticercosis such as delirium, perceptive sensory changes, anxiety, depression, and personality disorders, have been identified. Neurocysticercosis is a standard differential diagnosis of most neurological, but not psychiatric, conditions in the endemic regions. However, the infestation results in complex physiological, neurosurgical, and psychological syndromes.\n\nCase details – we report a case of a 48-year-old male presented with complaints of headache, low mood, forgetfulness, one episode of seizure and was further evaluated and diagnosed with neurocysticercosis with depressive features and cognitive impairment due to underlying medical condition.\n\nConclusion – this case report describes finding of neurocysticercosis in a patient who presented with depressive symptoms with cognitive impairment, headache, episode of convulsion. This pleomorphism is predominantly associated with individual variations in the number and location of nervous system lesions and the magnitude of the host’s immune response to the parasite. It is important to consider NCC in differential diagnosis of patients in endemic areas presenting with psychiatric symptoms, especially those showing poor response to the standard treatment and in those with history of seizures.\n\nKeywords – depressive symptoms, neurocysticercosis\n\nSpectrum Of Skin Dermatoses Among Patients of Substance Use Disorder-A Hospital Based Study\n\nBackground:\n\nVarious substances of abuse are known to cause specific cutaneous manifestations. Cutaneous manifestations are associated with the use of cocaine, methamphetamine, heroin, marijuana, alcohol, anabolic steroids, and general signs of the drug abuse, including the stigmata of injection drug use, infectious complications, and vascular complications. However, the literature on the same is very limited from Indian subcontinent.\n\nAim:\n\nTo find out various dermatoses in psychiatric patients of substance use disorder.\n\nMethods:\n\nIn the present study, 46 Diagnosed cases of substance use disorder as per Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorder-5 (DSM-5)1 were taken. Cutaneous examination was performed accordingly. Laboratory investigations were done as per need.\n\nResults:\n\nMean age was 42.21±16.64. Majority of the patients were illiterate (41.3%) and 26.1% were either graduate or post graduate and 21.7% were high school pass and 6.5% were middle school and minority had primary school education (4.3%). All patients are taking substance in one or other form. Majority of the patients had complaints of raised lesions (56.5%) and followed by redness (23.9%), pain (19.6%), burning (13%) and oozing (13%) discomfort and flaking of skin (10.9%), rash (8.7%), light spots (6.5%) and fluid filled lesions (4.3%).\n\nConclusion\n\nFew substances were associated with specific dermatoses. However there is very little data on the same so this study will add upon minuscule literature on this topic.\n\nComparative study of delirium associated with alcohol withdrawal versus other medical illnesses: clinical profile, course of illness & outcome\n\nBackground: Delirium is a prevalent and serious condition observed in the medical intensive care unit (MICU), with various etiologies including alcohol withdrawal and other medical illnesses. However,limited research has compared the clinical profiles, course of illness, and outcomes between these different types of delirium.\n\nAims of study- To evaluate the symptom profiles and courses of alcohol withdrawal delirium and delirium associated with other medical illnesses, as well as to assess the correlation between cognitive status and psychotic symptoms.\n\nMethods: This is a longitudinal follow up study, conducted at Tertiary medical college. Consecutive subjects who were diagnosed with delirium were taken. Sample consisted of 152 subjects. Symptom profiles,course of illness,and outcomes were assessed using six scales: the Brief psychiatric rating scale,Kuppuswamy socioeconomic scale,Cognitive Test for Delirium, Severity of Alcohol Dependence Questionnaire,Delirium rating scale revised 98 and the delirium etiology checklist.\n\nResults: Findings indicate that alcohol withdrawal delirium and delirium associated with other medical illnesses exhibit distinct symptom profiles and courses of illness. Alcohol withdrawal delirium showed specific symptoms related to withdrawal state,while delirium associated with other medical illnesses displayed symptoms characteristic of the underlying medical condition.\n\nConclusion: This study provides valuable insights into the clinical profiles of delirium associated with alcohol withdrawal versus other medical illnesses. The findings suggest the importance of recognizing the specific features and courses of each type of delirium for appropriate management and interventions in the MICU.\n\n“Hormonal assay in postnatal women with psychiatric morbidity-A study in tertiary care hospital”\n\nDr. K.Raghav*, Dr.Lakshmi Sarath Chandra**, Dr. P.Ramya Keerthi***, Dr. N.Nageswara Rao****\n\n*Post-Graduate, Department of Psychiatry, S.V.Medical College, Tirupati. **Assistant Professor, Department of Psychiatry, Viswabharathi Medical college,Kurnool.\n\n***Associate Professor, Department of Psychiatry, Institute of Mental Health, Kadapa.\n\n****Professor and HOD, Department of Psychiatry, Kurnool Medical College.\n\nBackground\n\nPostpartum period is characterised by an increased susceptibility to psychiatric disorders.\n\nChildbirth causes trauma, sleep deprivation and adjustments in relationships and is a major life transition.\n\nA range of psychological disorders occur in women in the postpartum period including blues, depression, anxiety, psychosis, and posttraumatic stress disorders.\n\nThere are large changes in the levels of several hormones over the peripartum period which may also contribute to changes in mood in vulnerable women.\n\nThis study aims at identifying the relationship of serum hormonal variations with psychiatric morbidity of women in their postpartum period.\n\nAim Of The Study\n\nTo study the serum hormonal levels in postnatal women with psychiatric morbidity\n\nMethodology\n\nThe present study is a Case-control study using purposive random sampling method and the study sample consisting of 40 Postnatal women with psychiatric morbidity and 40 Postnatal women without psychiatric morbidity diagnosed as per Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I.) version 7.0.2.\n\nStudy Period is 6 months and the study was undertaken after obtaining approval from the Institutional Ethics Committee (S.V. M.C Lr No. 08/2022).\n\nAll the subjects included in the study were attending to Outpatient and Inpatient Department of Psychiatry, Tirupati and the Outpatient and Inpatient Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Tirupati.\n\nSemi-structured proforma was used to record socio-demographic profiles, and obstetric history.\n\nBlood sample was collected under aseptic precautions at 8am in the morning under fasting. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to estimate the serum levels of hormones T3, T4, Thyroid Stimulating Hormone, Luteinizing Hormone, Estrogen, Progesterone and Cortisol.\n\nResults\n\n60% of cases and 12.5% of controls had a past history of psychiatric illness which showed a significant P value=0.001.\n\n25% of cases and 2.5% of controls had a parity of 4 which showed a significant P value=0.031.\n\nThe mean serum T3 levels among cases was 1.00 ± 0.30y, while among controls was 1.47 ± 0.48y. On applying chi-square test P value is 0.001, Hence it is significant.\n\nThe mean serum TSH levels among cases was 3.34 ± 1.84y, while among controls was 2.50 ± 1.46y. On applying chi-square test P value is 0.031, Hence it is significant.\n\nThe mean 8 AM serum cortisol values among cases was 20.81 ± 7.30y, while among controls was 15.31 ± 6.05y. On applying chi-square test P value is 0.001, Hence it is significant.\n\nAmong the cases, 47.5% were diagnosed with major depressive episode of which 63.2% had 8 AM serum cortisol values over 22.6 microgram/dl which showed a significant P value= 0.032.\n\nDiscussion\n\nSerum hormones could play a major role in the onset of psychiatric disorders in the postpartum period.\n\nPatients with a known psychiatric illness are likely to experience a relapse during postpartum period.\n\nThyroid hormones and cortisol could be used as biomarkers for postpartum psychiatric disorders.\n\nCortisol looks to be a more specific marker for postpartum depression.\n\nLeveraging RCPsych International Volunteering as Catalyst Agents for Advancing Mental Healthcare: A Case Study from Bangladesh\n\nThis presentation will delve into a compelling case study showcasing the transformative impact of collaboration between judges and psychiatrists in Bangladesh, resulting in notable improvements in forensic psychiatry practices.\n\nAs the Chair of the Volunteer Psychiatrists’ Special Interest Group (VIPSIG), I am excited to share insights from a compelling use case that spotlights the collaborative efforts of judges and psychiatrists in Bangladesh.

More than 400,000 Australians live with dementia, and this figure is expected to double by 2058. More than 28,650 people have younger onset dementia and this is expected to double within the same timeframe; however, it is recognized\n\nAims and Objectives\n\nAssess changes in LOS of patients compared to previous 2017 audit\n\nEvaluate use of pathways for patients with suspected cognitive impairment including timely diagnosis and management of patients with dementia\n\nIdentify developmental needs of a local geriatric service to improve outcome of care\n\nMethodology\n\nEthics approval was sought to review data of 100 consecutive patients ≥65yo who attended MBH in 2022 were assessed. Assessment parameters used in the used 2017 audit were used. In addition, recommendations made previously were assess by cognitive screening tool usage. These parameters can be found as Table 1.\n\nthat many cases go undiagnosed.\n\nFrom 2015, the rate of hospitalization due to dementia increased 1.6% each year. The average length of stay (LOS)in hospitals due to dementia is 5x higher than all other hospitalizations (13 days vs 2.6 days). While younger onset dementia had a greater average LOS than older people (22 days vs 13 days).\n\nA 2017 audit done in Mackay Base Hospital (MBH) found high proportion of patients >65yo displayed cognitive impairment but weren’t screened appropriately and were missed dementia diagnoses. That resulted in increased LOS and re-admission rates. Recommendations made after were aimed at increasing screening, diagnosis and management pathways for dementia patients.\n\nDiscussion Points and Results:\n\nResultsLOSfordementia patients has largely remained unchanged since 2017 (The same applies to total hospital LOS)\n\nThe barrier to diagnosing dementia has improved relatively – where only 4% of our population did not receive a dementia diagnosis (Compared to 79% in 2017)\n\nACE-III and RUDAS remains the 2 main screening tool used, these were mainly performed by Occupational Therapist and Psychologists\n\nCategorizing into dementia types and it’s associated severity remains suboptimal\n\nReadmission rates albeit low would benefit from further improvement\n\nAll 100 patients selected were put through the tool. Some population demographics can be found in Table 2. Most patients had a diagnosis of dementia, while 13% of patients had newly diagnosed dementia shown in Figure 1. Dementia types were mostly not documented, while Alzheimer’s remains the most common type of dementia as shown in Figure 2. Dementia severity was also not documented in most cases, however where documented, most cases were severe as shown in Figure 3.\n\nThe LOS comparison can be found in Figure 4, the LOS for dementia has increased as compared to 2017. While the maintenance LOS for the various categories is found in Table 3, patients who were admitted from their usual residential aged care facility (RACF) had the longest LOS at 53 days. Home was the commonest discharge location as in Figure 5. 21% of patients were readmitted within 30 days.\n\nRecommendations\n\nThis completed audit cycle shows improvement in clinical acuity and a reduced barrier to screening and diagnosing dementia. There remains considerable work in the development of effective management of dementia and utilisation of health resources. Dementia underdiagnosis reduces the perceived importance of resourcing health services to manage cognitive impairment in older people.\n\nFurther development to help continue this improvement trajectory should be undertaken; such as continuous key stakeholder engagements, establishment of a geriatric service and to collaborate care approaches to utilize trans-disciplinary cadre of various clinicians.\n\nReferences\n\nDementia Australia. dementia prevalence and incidence projections, from 2011 to 2050, for Queensland, by Federal Electoral Division (FED), State Electoral District (SED) and Health Service District (HSD).

Severity of dependence was measured using Severity of Alcohol Dependence Questionnaire (SAD-Q)\n\nSemi structured proforma was used to record socio-demographic profiles\n\nBlood samples were collected under aseptic precautions and was thiamine levels was estimated by Enzyme linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA).\n\nRESULTS:\n\nOf the 30 subjects, 60% had moderate dependence when measured with SAD-Q and had no correlation or association with socio demographic factors assessed.\n\nThe withdrawal psychosis did not have any association with the severity of alcohol dependence with P value of 0.361.\n\nThere was no significant correlation between serum thiamine levels and the severity of alcohol dependence (P value of 0.692)\n\nThere was no significant correlation between thiamine values and psychosis during alcohol withdrawal (P value of 0.163)\n\nThe socio demographic factors also did not show any significant association to the alcohol dependence or thiamine levels\n\nDISCUSSION:\n\nThiamine deficiency in AUDs is vastly known to be associated with several neurological disorders like Wernicke’s encephalopathy and Korsakoff’s psychosis and its supplementation is known to prevent the development of these disorders\n\nThis study showed that there was thiamine deficiency in AUDs, although there was not any significant correlations between thiamine and severity of alcohol dependence and alcohol withdrawal psychosis, the sample size was small, diet habits were not assessed and only male patients were included\n\nHence, future studies are necessary to understand the above mentioned correlations and their clinical implications\n\nA comparative study of sociodemographic factors and depression among nulliparous and multiparous pregnant women\n\nPRESENTER: Dr Ashish Kumar Agarwal\n\n(2nd year Resident, Psychiatry Department, PDU Medical college Rajkot)\n\nBACKGROUND:\n\nDepression is a prevalent mental health issue that affects women across the lifespan. The susceptibility to depression is influenced by a complex interplay of biological, genetic, psychological, sociodemographic and environmental factors. Whether a female is nulliparous or multiparous can also be a factor, but it’s essential to understand that this is just one of many factors that can contribute to a person’s risk of depression.\n\nAIMS:\n\nTo compare the influence of sociodemographic factors on depression in nulliparous and multiparous pregnant women.\n\nMETHODS:\n\nData was collected through a cross-sectional survey conducted among women aged 20 to 45 years. Sociodemographic-variables such as age, education, occupation, socioeconomic-status etc were collected. Depression was assessed using Edinburgh-postnatal-depression-scale and diagnosis was made as per DSM-5. Statistical analysis was done and chi-square test was applied to examine the relationship between sociodemographic factors and depression in both groups.\n\nRESULTS:\n\nPreliminary findings suggest that sociodemographic factors may exert varying degrees of influence on depression. In multiparous women, being employed and living in rental house were significantly associated with depression, while no any significant association with depression was found in nulliparous women.\n\nCONCLUSION:\n\nThis study underscores the importance of sociodemographic factors when assessing depression in pregnant women. The findings suggest that nulliparous and multiparous women may have distinct risk profiles for depression, necessitating tailored approaches for prevention and intervention.\n\nA study of a risk factor for Delirium tremens among patients with alcohol withdrawal\n\n1)Dr. Varun Bansal, Junior Resident, Department of Psychiatry, J.L.N. Medical College, Ajmer\n\n2)Dr. Mahendra Jain, Senior Professor and Head, Department of Psychiatry, J.L.N. Medical College, Ajmer\n\n3)Dr. Parth Singh, Professor, Department of Psychiatry, J.L.N. Medical College, Ajmer\n\n4)Dr. Charan Singh, Associate Professor, Department of Psychiatry, J.L.N. Medical College, Ajmer\n\n1 : Presenting Author\n\n2,3,4 : Co-authors\n\nBackground- Delirium tremens (DT), is characterized by severe consequences and a high death rate. Identifying people at higher risk of DT would have significant therapeutic and preventative ramifications. Therefore, the goal of the current study was to find clinical risk variables that could foretell the emergence of DT.\n\nAim- To determine the prevalence of delirium tremens among in-patients admitted with alcohol withdrawal and to compare the sociodemographic and clinical correlates between those with and without Delirium Tremens.\n\nMethods- In this study, 300 consecutive in-patients diagnosed with alcohol withdrawal as per ICD-10 were included, out of which, 29 patients developed DT. The subjects were assessed using Semi-structured demographic profile, clinical proforma, Severity of Alcohol Dependence Questionnaire (SADQ) and Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment of Alcohol Scale, Revised (CIWA-Ar) on the day of recruitment. Two groups were made and comparison of different parameters within groups was done.\n\nResults- The mean age of patients in group without DT was 36.86 years and in group with DT was 44.59 years, which was found to be statistically significant. All subjects with DT had a high mean SADQ-C and CIWA-Ar score of 47.86 and 35.24 which was significantly higher than the score of 41.52 and 27.26 in the non-DT group respectively.\n\nConclusion- The risk of development of delirium tremens in patients with alcohol withdrawal should be carefully monitored by assessing the various variables which have been indicative of being a risk factor.\n\nStudy of risk factors in children with disruptive mood dysregulation disorder\n\nDr Sourabh Pal- Junior resident, Seth G S Medical College and KEM Hospital Dr Vinita Pawar - Ex resident, Seth G S Medical College and KEM Hospital Dr Ajita Nayak- Professor and HOD, Seth G S Medical College and KEM Hospital\n\nBACKGROUND:\n\nDisruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (DMDD) first described in DSM 5 is a condition occurring in children and characterised by severe aggression. It has been reported that the 3- month prevalence rates for DMDD ranged from 0.8% to 3.3%, with the highest rates in preschoolers. Some studies suggest that male children with a family member with a psychiatric condition are at higher risk. However Indian studies are lacking.\n\nAIMS: To study the sociodemographic profile, associated birth complications and parental psychopathology in children suffering from DMDD.\n\nMETHODS: 80 consecutive children satisfying the DSM-5 Criteria for DMDD and living with their parents were studied. A semi-structured proforma was used to note the details.\n\nRESULTS: Of the 80 children 74% were school aged children and 26% teens. A male preponderance was seen. No parental psychopathology was found in 95% children. 25% of children were found to have assisted deliveries at birth. 6.25% were found to be pre-term. Post birth around 31.25% of children had other complications (e.g., LBW, Jaundice, Febrile convulsions).\n\nCONCLUSIONS:\n\nOur study showed that DMDD occurs mainly in school aged male children. It was found to be associated predominantly with birth complications.\n\nComparison of Mental health literacy, Physical health literacy & Stigma among medical graduates & community: A Cross-Sectional study\n\nBackground\n\nMental health conditions contribute significantly to the global disease burden, with stigma and limited mental health literacy hindering early interventions and help-seeking behaviours. Mental health literacy encompasses various abilities, including recognizing disorders and fostering positive attitudes, while health literacy, in general, is essential for informed decision-making and positive health behaviours.\n\nAim\n\nTo assess and compare the mental health literacy, physical health literacy &stigma among medical undergraduates & community.\n\nMethod\n\nThis study conducted at tertiary hospital in Karnataka is an online cross-sectional observational study. It uses purposive sampling for medical students and snowball sampling for the community, excluding individuals with psychiatric illnesses. The study employs three instruments, including the Reported and Intended Behaviour Scale (RIBS) to assess mental health stigma, the All Aspects of Health Literacy Scale (AAHLS), and the Mental Health Literacy Questionnaire-Short Version for Adults (MHLQ-SVA).\n\nResults\n\nPhysical health literacy was more compared to mental health literacy in both groups of medical graduates and community. Stigma was higher in the community compared to medical graduates.\n\nConclusion\n\nPromoting mental and physical health literacy and reducing stigma in India necessitates a multifaceted approach grounded in scientific evidence. Empowering healthcare professionals with the expertise to identify and address mental health issues, coupled with community education on physical & mental health literacy and stigma’s detrimental effects, can substantially alleviate the disease burden and enhance population well-being.\n\nCross-sectional study of burnout in university exam attending students\n\nBACKGROUND – University life is a critical phase in a student’s life mixed with intellectual growth, personal development, academic demands, and peak stress-inducing events. The experience of burnout, a state of physical and emotional exhaustion, coupled with reduced performance has become a growing concern. The current study addressed this by assessing burnout in students during university examinations.\n\nAIMS – To assess burnout among university students during examination periods.\n\nMETHODS – The cross-sectional study recruited students of Narayana Medical College after obtaining informed consent. Online questionnaires including socio-demographic data of name, age, gender, and academic year along with the Maslach Burnout Inventory were sent to the students via social media. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics and necessary analytical measurements to identify the level of burnout in these individuals and their contributing factors.\n\nRESULTS – Our study found a substantial prevalence of burnout symptoms among the surveyed students, with a significant score between student academic burnout and perceived stress levels. Academic workload, poor sleep quality, and excessive social media usage were identified as the most significant factors.\n\nCONCLUSION – This cross-sectional study sheds light on the prevalence and factors associated with burnout in university exam-attending students and found a significant association between them. Interventions should encompass stress reduction programs, academic support, sleep hygiene, and adaptive coping strategies.\n\nRelationship between internet addiction and sleep quality among Nursing students : a cross sectional study\n\nBackground: The number of people using the internet has surged in the last few years and the internet has become a fundamental part of daily life for many of us. As of July 2023, there were 5.19 billion internet users worldwide (64.6 %). Of this total, 4.88 billion (59.9 %), were social media users. Excessive use of internet among adolescents often led to later bedtimes and poor sleep quality. This study assessed the relationship between internet addiction and sleep quality among nursing students of Madurai Medical College.\n\nAim: To study the relationship between internet addition and sleep quality among nursing students of Madurai Medical College.\n\nMethod: This structured questionnaire based cross sectional study enrolled nursing students of Madurai Medical College . We assessed sleep quality and internet addiction using Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index ( PSQI) and Young’s Internet Addiction Test (IAT)\n\nResults: Our results showed that internet addiction was significantly associated with poor sleep quality. Worse quality of sleep as reflected by PSQI was noted in students with moderate and severe degrees of internet addiction compared to those with mild or no internet addiction .\n\nConclusion: Our study revealed that internet addiction was found to be significantly associated with poor subjective sleep quality, increased sleep latency, reduced sleep duration, use of sleep medication, and daytime dysfunction. There is a need for programmes to raise awareness towards internet addiction as well as it’s impact on sleep among students.\n\nSubjective Happiness in medical students and correlations with Personality and Coping\n\nBackground: Students around the globe choose medicine in the hopes of leading a meaningful and happy life, but the journey is fraught with challenges. With increasing competition and academic demands, student stress levels are rising by the day. In this situation, being mentally healthy and feeling happy becomes paramount for growth and productivity. Various factors, including the student’s personality structure and coping strategies used, might play a role in determining whether he/she stays happy in the face of adversities.\n\nAim: To assess subjective happiness in medical students, and explore its relationships with various demographic factors, personality traits and coping strategies.\n\nMethods\n\n256 students from BJMC Ahmedabad were enrolled in the study. They filled a proforma with demographic details and three self-report scales: Subjective Happiness Scale for happiness, Big Five Inventory for personality traits, and Brief COPE for coping strategies.\n\nResults\n\nThe mean happiness score was 5.06 (range: 1.75-7). Males scored higher compared to females (p=0.009). Final MBBS part1 students had the highest scores (5.4). Extraversion, agreeableness, and conscientiousness positively correlated with happiness, while neuroticism was negatively correlated (all p <0.001). Active Coping, Positive reframing and Acceptance correlated positively, while Self-blame and Substance-use were negatively related to happiness.\n\nConclusion\n\nUsing mean as a cutoff, slightly more students felt unhappy (51.56%) than average, while 28.5% students had happiness levels below/equal to lower limit in general populations. Males, final year students, living with families with multiple hobbies were happier. Extroverts, agreeable and conscientious students, employing adaptive coping strategies like Acceptance were happier compared to neurotic ones using maladaptive strategies like Self-blame.\n\nCASE SERIES REPORT ON VIRTUAL AUTISM\n\nBACKGRO"
