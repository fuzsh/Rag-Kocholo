        "text": "In lieu of an abstract, here is a brief excerpt of the content:\n\n12 Sticks, Not Carrots The Discourse of Soft Power in Popular Chinese Cinema Katherine Chu The Chinese box office broke its all-time yearly record in 2019, with local films accounting for eight of the top ten movies, generating 64.1 percent of total box office revenue.1 Earlier that year, China’s first big-budget, outer-space, sci-fi epic, The Wandering Earth (Liulang diqiu, dir. Frant Gwo, 2019), earned a remarkable $699.8 million worldwide.2 That record did not last long. In the summer, it was surpassed by the incredible performance of the Chinese animated film Nezha (Nezha zhi motong jiangshi, dir. Yu Yang, 2019), which earned $710 million. In the following year, the early autumn of 2020—which included a clutch of patriotic movies with releases intended to celebrate the seventieth anniversary of the People’s Republic’s founding—turned into the blockbuster season for the Chinese film industry. The top-grossing films were My People, My Country (Wo he wo de zuguo, dir. Ning Hao, Xu Zheng, Guan Hu, Chen Kaige, Zhang Yibai, Wen Muye, Xue Xiaolu, 2019), The Captain (Zhongguo jizhang, dir. Andrew Lau, 2019), and The Climbers (Pandengzhe, dir. Daniel Lee, 2019). In the spring of 2021—the peak season for Chinese cinema screens—Hi, Mom (Ni hao, Li Huangying, dir. Jia Ling, 2021) and Detective Chinatown 3 (Tangren jie tan’an 3, dir. Chen Sicheng, 2021) both soared past the $600 million mark during their second week in theaters. From sales in just the Chinese market alone, both titles have not only become the secondand third-biggest grossers for any movie released in China behind Wolf Warrior 2 (Zhan lang 2, dir. Wu Jing, 2017)—which earned $870.3 million—but have now far surpassed the world’s highest-grossing film in 2020: China’s The Eight Hundred (Babai, dir. Guan Hu, 2020), which earned $468 million. Hollywood used to dominate China’s film market, but since the mid-2000s, its share has decreased due to protectionist policies combined with the improved quality of Chinese blockbusters. In 2020, domestic films accounted for 83.7 percent of China’s total box office revenue, with only 16.3 percent generated by foreign movies, down from 35.9 percent in 2019. Of the top ten films of 2020 at the box 224 Sticks, Not Carrots office, all were domestic-made films.3 Underneath the success of high-grossing Chinese films lies a force that could aﬀect everything from perceptions of nationality to the shape of foreign policy and transnational narratives: in his first speech as General Secretary, Xi Jinping launched a new mission; under his leadership, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) would lead China’s return as a global power. Choosing to establish a conceptual idea- rather than an economic target or policy is significant. His Chinese Dream also set the stage for elevating ideological work to a level perhaps not ever seen in Chinese history. There has also been a remarkable shift in China’s propaganda policies. Since the mid-2000s, the Party has launched a Grand External Propaganda Campaign, or Big Foreign Propaganda (Da Wai Xuan), by pouring billions of dollars into publicity agencies, including print media (e.g., by inserting China Daily into a newspaper such as the Washington Post for as much as $250,000 an issue), broadcasting (e.g., CGTN broadcasts in six languages), and social media (e.g., Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube),4 all while the film industry promotes a positive view of China and its place in global politics and culture. Strategies such as “Chinese Culture Going Global” in 2011,5 the Chinese Dream in 2012, “Telling Chinese Stories” in 2014,6 and “generate positive energy” in 20177 all aimed to enhance the appeal and influence of Chinese culture globally through multiple channels, levels, and forms. China’s miraculous economic growth supported the transformation from Deng Xiaoping’s low-profile and “hide-our-capacities” approach of power projection to a more assertive role at global and regional levels. China spread its footprints worldwide, but Beijing’s leadership also vigorously promoted Chinese language and culture as a cultural soft-power tool. As of January 2018, it had established more than 500 Confucius Institutes worldwide since the first Confucius Institute was opened in Seoul, South Korea, in 2004. Interestingly, the official Chinese discourse on soft power began in 2007 as a political strategy mainly to simmer domestic discontent in order to safeguard, sustain, and prolong the Chinese Communist..."
