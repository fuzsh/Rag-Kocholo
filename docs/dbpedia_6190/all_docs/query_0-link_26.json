These companies hail from 28 countries, with the largest numbers coming from the United States with 19 companies; nine from China; four from both Italy and South Korea; three from countries that include Canada, Germany, Spain, Taiwan, and Vietnam; and two apiece from Hong Kong, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands, and Sweden.\n\nA sampling of the new buying companies for this year includes: Blue Finch Film Releasing, DREAMAX MEDIA, Eagle Communication Co., Ltd., DYNIT, Elevation Pictures, High Octane Pictures, Indie Rights, Mango Films Vietnam, Sun Film Group, Tangren Cultural Film Group, Times Film Group, LLC, Vudu, Weltkino Filmverleih GmbH, and Youplanet Pictures.\n\nJonathan Wolf, AFM Managing Director commented, “Every year new distribution companies and platforms are launched, connecting independent films with audiences throughout the world. We look forward to welcoming all to their first AFM.”\n\nIn addition, the AFM today unveiled its official artwork for 2018 which will be used throughout the run of the market (see attached).\n\n# # #\n\nAbout the American Film Market®\n\nThe American Film Market (AFM®) is the world’s largest motion picture business event. Over 7,000 industry leaders from more than 80 countries converge in Santa Monica for eight days of deal-making, screenings, conferences, networking and parties. Participants include acquisition and development executives, agents, attorneys, directors, distributors, festival directors, financiers, film commissioners, producers, writers, the world’s press and all those who provide services to the motion picture industry.\n\nUnlike a film festival, the AFM is a marketplace – with over 200,000 square feet of exhibition space – where production and distribution deals are closed. In just eight days, more than US$1 billion in deals will be sealed – on both completed films and those in every stage of development and production.\n\nParticipants may view more than 500 screenings of 300+ films – 29 new films every two hours – the majority world or U.S. premieres. Titles range from big budget blockbusters that will be released by the major studios to lower budget art and genre films recognized at international film festivals.\n\nAbout the Independent Film & Television Alliance®\n\nThe Independent Film & Television Alliance (IFTA®) is the global trade association of the independent motion picture and television programming industry. Headquartered in Los Angeles, IFTA represents and provides significant entertainment industry services to more than 140 Member companies in 21 countries, consisting of independent production and distribution companies, sales agents, and financial institutions engaged in production finance.
