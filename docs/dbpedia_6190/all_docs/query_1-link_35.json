        "text": "1. Introduction\n\nEvery person has within his/her mind his/her own character or superhero such as Pinocchio, Cinderella, Mickey Mouse, Harry Potter or even Peppa Pig. Most tourists have a common denominator, the desire to travel where they have always dreamt under an adventurous spirit or calmed, a time of leisure and enjoyment, where they can rest and disconnect from daily routine, that is, a dream come true. For this purpose, theme parks were created and encouraged by animation, cartoon, superhero and fantasy movies. Stewart (2022) indicates that animation provides all recreational possibilities for tourists to enjoy a cheerful, active and interesting vacation. Movies induce tourists to travel to the locations where these were filmed (Kolasińska, 2020). The Themed Entertainment Association (TEA/AECOM) reported that in 2021 theme parks increased attendance globally by an impressive 72% compared to the previous years (TEA/AECOM, 2021). Some Destination Marketing Organizations (DMOs) promote their tourist attractions to attract more tourists, the famous Dracula’s Castle in Transylvania, Romania, is a living example of this. Film tourism is a marketing tool for promoting and selling tourist destinations, and an important differentiating factor in the marketing strategies of cities.\n\nFilm-induced tourism is defined by Hudson and Ritchie (2006) as a tourist visit to a destination or attraction due to the destination being featured on television, video, digital video disc or the cinema screen (Marafa et al., 2022). The concept of movie-induced tourism has received popular support (Mori, 2022; Zhou et al., 2023), the influence of movies in countries (Liu et al., 2020), how influences movie-induced tourism between different cultures to attract more tourists and visitors (Michael et al., 2020), the influence of cartoon movies on children’s gender (Gökçearslan, 2010), how film-induced tourism can improve tourist’s satisfaction and experience, because movies are one of the most important factors that motivate people to travel to a destination (Oshriyeh and Capriello, 2022), or even as a marketing tool and brand image for tourist destinations (Nakayama, 2022). Nostalgia is also effective in promoting theme parks associated with animations and animated characters to increase the number of visitors (Oh and Kim, 2020).\n\nKim et al. (2019) found that film tourists are motivated to experience historical reality of movies at destinations and tourist attractions where these were filmed. The subject of film-induced tourism and theme parks is underresearched, authors like Fu et al. (2022) and Florian (2017) investigated this topic, but not in-depth, especially in the interrelationship between film-induced tourism and theme parks by tourists. A study carried out by Milman (2001) solicited opinions from 122 general managers representing North American theme parks and attractions regarding the future of the industry, and the most managers answered that visitors seek interactive adventure, fantasy, mystery, science fiction and futuristic themes of movies. Animation is a prime way to promote tourism destination marketing (Chen et al., 2021), but how movies, animations and cartoons content affect theme park’s attractions has not been fully discussed.\n\nTo fill this gap, the main challenge of this paper is to analyze interrelationship between film-induced tourism and visits to theme parks by tourists, and to examine the most viewed movies worldwide (2010–2021) which are related with theme parks and their attractions. In other words, how movies and cartoons influence the number of tourists at theme parks. Moreover, to achieve this objective, this research examines the most viewed movies worldwide, due to the narrative of movies and their characters are related to the main attractions of theme parks and number of visitors. Shvartman (2022) claims that Disney’s movies continue breaking the box office, and its animated drawing people worldwide to its theme parks’ rides.\n\n4. Results of research\n\n4.1 The movie industry and its main films in the past 13 years\n\nSince the beginning of 2000s, several new characters and themes have emerged within movie industry, and the specter of film tourism research activity. Following data of Table 1 displays the top 20 movies at the Worldwide Box Office in 13 years (460 movies), and we selected representative movies that are staged and promoted in attractions, characters, live musical performances and main street music at theme parks, and these were 163 movies, that is, these represents 35.4% of total over the period considered. Although, if we add movies from Table A1 (67 movies), the total movies selected are 230 movies. Disney, Universal, Warner Bros and Marvel movies have been the most presentative in theme parks in the past 13 years, and these have traditionally dominated cinemas and theme parks, thanks to these famous characters of animation. In 2019, 24 movies related to theme parks were screened in cinemas around the world, and 27 movies more in 2016 (see Table 1 and Table A1), and the top 20 theme parks worldwide reached a new milestone with 215 million visitors in 2019, and 205 million visitors in 2016. Results shows that the theme park industry was booming until the COVID-19 pandemic arrived. However, Disney and Universal’s movies have a high representation in the Worldwide Box Office, and this favors the interest of knowing the new characters of movies by viewers in theme parks and their attractions.\n\nThese data demonstrate that movies can improve the number of visitors at theme parks through animation, cartoon, superhero and fantasy films as an incentive to visit theme parks. A general overview of Table 1 shows film-induced selection criteria and the importance of these in movies, theme parks and tourism industries. Movies that have dominated the first 20 places in cinemas’ worldwide box office ranking are represented in Table 1. Movies selected in this research have a dual purpose for Disney, Universal and Warner Bros, among many others. First, companies want to obtain the greatest benefit from cinemas, and second, promote these movies and their characters worldwide through marketing campaigns to attract a maximum influx of tourists to theme parks.\n\nMovies and cartoons like The Lego Batman, The Lego Ninjago, Asterix or Peppa Pig television series are good examples of best practices in educational and creativity in theme parks, mainly focused on children and teenagers. Asterix, Legoland and Peppa Pig theme parks are known around the world. Likewise, we have also seen that there is a lack of information, marketing strategies and promotion of theme park’s rides through digital channels and social media by some theme park operators such as Europa Park, Ocean Park, Everland, Lotte World, Nagashima Spa Land, Parc Asterix, Peppa Pig and Legoland, among many others in comparison with Disney and Universal theme parks, the latter are pioneers on marketing, promotion and communication campaigns of their theme park’s attractions and movies through digital media. Disney and Universal Studios operators are examples to follow in the theme park and entertainments sectors. For this reason, we urge the rest of theme park operators to promote new attractions related to movies as an added value through digital channels and social media to better visualize their leisure and entertainment activities and increase the number of visitors.\n\nNonetheless, Table 1 displays how in 2020 during the pandemic crisis, Disney released only two movies, Soul and Mulan related to theme parks, and Universal Studios did not present films which were linked to its attractions. Given this scenario, it is no coincidence that the problem of cinemas and theme parks were closed, both have not been excepting from global pandemic, and the effects of pandemic crisis caused a drastic slowdown in visitors and viewers worldwide, in fact, viewers were forced to stay home for their video entertainment and this situation favored the emergence of new streaming video services from such prominent studios as Disney+, Universal and Warner Bros joining and competing with Netflix, Hulu and Amazon platforms. Although in 2022, the film industry is picking up thanks to films like Top Gun: Maveric and Jurassic World Dominion, Elvis and Minions: The Rise of Gru, but there is a very long way to go until the sector recovers to prepandemic levels of custom (see Table 1). Movies are also considered as a marketing tool, and a new window to promote the new attractions in theme parks, the best examples of success are Minions, Marvel characters, Star Wars, Toy Story and The Beauty and the Beast films.\n\n4.2 Theme parks in a globalized context of economic crisis\n\nVisits to themed attractions are highly related to film theme viewed by visitors. In addition, the world’s most popular visitor attractions and theme parks are directly related to film (TEA/AECOM, 2021). Based on extant data of research, Table 2 provides an overview of the most important theme parks around the world, being Magic Kingdom in Florida/USA as the most visited theme parks with 212 million visitors in the world from 2012 to 2021, followed by Disneyland in California with 185 million visitors and third, Tokyo Disneyland with 173 million visitors. Results show us that the Disney World Company is the best company worldwide in theme parks, thus is, out of the top 20 theme parks, 10 belong to Disney company. The Universal Studios company ranks second with four theme parks, and the remaining of companies have one park in this study.\n\nIn 2019, over 215 million people visited these 20 parks. It is worth noting that this figure is higher than the number of international tourists who visited France, Spain and Thailand combined in 2019 (UNTWO, 2020). Figure 2 empathizes the positive progress of the numbers of visitors at top 20 parks from 2010 to 2019. Based on these indicators, theme parks are alive and well, and they are continuing growing around the world. But theme parks have not been excepting from COVID-19 pandemic, in 2020 the effects of pandemic crisis have caused a drastic slowdown by −69% on average in the number of visitors in the top 20 parks. Indeed, these data were especially devastating in California’s theme parks with −80% on average in the number of visitors, this tourist destination is highly dependent on tourism activities. Nevertheless, the pandemic crisis must be an opportunity by theme park operators, to introduce new products and services, tackle new challenges and goals with different responses, design and promote innovative marketing strategies and, finally, and very importantly, to unify movies and theme parks’ promotion campaigns through digital channels, TV and digital newspapers as a new entertainment package.\n\nIn 2021, the number of visitors at theme parks increased by 84% on average with previous year at the top 20 themes. Universal Studios Hollywood (California, USA) experienced the largest growth in number of visitors by percentage terms (324%), followed by Disney’s California Adventure with a 159%, Disney’s Hollywood Studios (Orlando, USA) by 133.7%, Disneyland (California, USA) with a 133.3%,and in fifth place Universal Islands of Adventure in Orlando with a 119%. These results are quite surprising, because Florida theme parks reopened in July 2020, while all theme parks in California remain shuttered (Whitten, 2020), it is because of each Disney and Universal Studios parks are dependent on local travel restrictions. Obviously, Disney and Universal Studios companies show that they are the great drivers of demand for theme parks and movies, and that these sectors (movies and theme parks) have an incredible capacity to recover and resilience to face pandemic crisis or times of economic uncertainty. Disney and Universal Studios operability and management are copied by most theme parks worldwide with the aim of attracting more visitors to parks. South Korea has its own theme park Everland, and it is ranked as the 14th theme park in the world having 75 million visitors (see Table 2), and is known for using their own characters and service strategies.\n\nOther relevant information about Disney and Universal Studios theme parks in Japan is also displayed in Table 2 and Figure 2. Tokyo Disneyland, Tokyo Disney Sea and Universal Studios Japan parks are close to reaching in number of visitors to American theme parks. Possibly, Japan theme parks shall exceed the number of visitors to American parks in the forthcoming years, because of its location and proximity to the Asian continent. Indeed, Manga characters are becoming more relevant and popular in theme parks and movies like Totoro, Dragon Ball or Doraemon; these characters are very popular and demanded in movies and theme parks worldwide. For instance, at Universal Studios Japan, the Japanification of attractions (e.g. Tatari, Hello Kitty, Dragon Ball) seems to be the key to arresting the decline in visitors’ numbers (Beeton and Seaton, 2018).\n\n5. Discussion and conclusions\n\nThe findings of this study revealed new insights and a close marketing and business relationship between the most viewed movies worldwide and theme parks’ attractions. Films have become an essential tool to create and develop new fictional characters and scenarios by the big movie companies under the watchful gaze of an enthusiastic public and fans that require new and best experiences of cinema and TV screens. Moviegoers/spectators/viewers/tourists demand a real and physical experience of transition from movies to theme parks or traveling to the locations where films were filmed. A more immersive experience based on movies’ knowledge, history and scenarios that viewers watched on cinema or TV screens. If there is one thing movies and entertainment industries can boast is to create a world of fiction where being able to transport people to a happy and fantasy world. Although we must acknowledge that books were the big drivers of this marvelous initiative.\n\nOur study’s first question (RQ1) was to analyze whether film-induced tourism can improve the number of visitors at theme parks. The foremost result of research is that film-induced tourism can be the perfect marketing tool to attract more visitors to theme parks through movies and their real or fictional characters represented in films. Moreover, this study confirmed these findings while at the same time revealing that animation, cartoon, superhero and fantasy movies are an incentive for children and families to visit theme parks through real or fictional characters represented on cinema and TV screens, as we can raise in RQ2. This correlation between film-induced tourism and theme parks and their attractions which are represented in Figures 3 and 4, and we can observe as Disney company designs and develops its movies, characters and imaginary scenarios with the aim of attracting more visitors to theme parks through film shown at cinemas. Disney parks are the ones that have the most attractions according to their showed movies. Indeed, Figure 2 showed us that the number of visitors at theme parks has not ceased to grow from 2010 to 2019, excluding 2020 because of the pandemic crisis. In this study, we defend that theme parks are an extension of movies, thus is, the end of the physical perfect experience at theme parks which began in a movie seat or on your TV/videogame/PC screens.\n\nThese results show what most people think about the Walter Elias Disney pioneer and its Disney theme parks has always been the best company worldwide in the fusion between movies and entertainment sectors, followed by Universal Studios company. The most popular movies in the past 13 years have stimulated tourism demand to travel to other destinations and visiting theme parks, thanks to movies developed by Disney, Universal, DreamWorks, Warner Bros, Columbia Pictures, Marvel Studios and 20th Century Fox companies. Consequently, the success of theme parks also depends on accommodation facilities like customized and thematized hotels and resorts, restaurants, shops, merchandising products, public and private transport, supporting product and services, safety and hygiene measures, among many others. Disney and Universal Studios parks have the largest number of rides related to movies analyzed in this research; these two theme park operators have successfully developed a differentiated adult and children’s literature and narrative focused on movies and theme park’s rides to attract a variety of customer segments like children and teenagers, families, students and professors, film lovers and geeks, among others.\n\nThese business and marketing strategies by Disney and Universal Studios operators are reflected in theme parks and movies every year, but not in the case of the rest of theme park operators, where they are only focused on increasing the number of visits, and without developing future scenarios, which allow them to prepare relevant business strategies to promote theme park’ rides. Figures 3 and 4 present the most important Disney and Universal’ rides which are linked to movies analyzed in Table 1 and Table A1; these famous rides are known worldwide, and one of the main purposes of theme park operators is to encourage audience’s interests and expectation of movies showed on cinemas, TV, streaming platforms, series and videogames to increase the number of visitors. This study displays the most important Disney and Universal’s attractions because these are the most representative attractions in the context of movies analyzed in this research. The rest of theme parks show a limited information and promotion related to rides and attractions, and movies in their official websites and social media.\n\nOur research’s third question (RQ3) was to explore whether animation, cartoon, superhero and fantasy movies are related to the main attractions of theme parks. This study reveals that the greatest potential of theme parks is that their attractions are associated with the most famous characters of movies. Like with other forms of storytelling like books, TV series, cartoons, documental and videogames, theme park narratives are closely tied to emotion, the idealized image of characters and idyllic environment of attractions.\n\nIn such times of economic uncertainty and wars like Russia and Ukraine, we would like to highlight that movies, theme parks, museums, sports and books help people to disconnect from the daily routine and troubles that our modern life causes. This is the perfect time to recognize the educational value of books, movies, theme parks and museums, with the aim of improving the present and future of people. Parents, children, educators, governments and companies have a great opportunity to explore how theme parks contribute to the construction of new ideas, characters, narratives, knowledge and innovative experiences through artificial intelligence (AI), virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), holograms and, most important of all, that all people really enjoy their learning experience, and they will be happy during their time at theme parks.\n\nFinally, we observed in this study that there is a high correlation between the most viewed movies worldwide and theme parks’ attractions (RQ4). This study found that more than 230 movies were presented at cinemas in the past 13 years, films which are the most representative in attractions of theme parks. Movies encourage viewers to visit theme parks’ attractions because people like to identify with movies’ characters, enjoy of scenarios and characters of movies at theme parks.\n\nNevertheless, the situation of pandemic crisis favored the large streaming platforms, and viewers were forced to stay home for their video entertainment, companies Netflix, HBO, Disney+, Amazon Prime and Tencent taken advantage of this favorable situation to increase the numbers of users. These large streaming platforms are seen as the prime deterrent to cinema and movie industry because they provide to users personalized services, better prices than cinemas, comfort and the availability to watch a film at any time by users. As stated by Martínez-Sánchez et al. (2021), these new audiovisual operators are breaking the hegemony of TV, cinema and movie industries.\n\nFinally, we would like to highlight the contribution made by this research in movie and theme park industries. First, we must recognize that film-induced tourism provides great benefits to the society, theme parks, cinemas and tourist destinations. Second, movies help to increase the number of visitors and tourists to theme parks and tourist destinations. In 2019, 215 million people visited the 20 theme parks analyzed in this study; this figure is quite lucrative to entertainment and tourism sectors, and local and regional economy where are localized these 20 theme parks. And third and last, this paper contributes to improve visitors’ satisfaction and experience at theme parks through animation, cartoon, superhero and fantasy movies. This research makes us very happy, because we want that children enjoy with movies through theme parks’ attractions and make their dream a reality, as well as parents would recover the kid in all of us, so they enjoy with their children in a fun, participative way.\n\n5.1 Theoretical and practical implications\n\nOn theoretical grounds, we recommend that the interrelation between film-induced tourism and theme parks should be improved considering the importance of entertainment and tourism literature at these two sectors. The effectiveness of VR, AR and AI technologies enhance consumer’s experience, promote his/her positive behavior, improve educational activities, encourage visitors to return or even promote new attractions of theme parks in social media. For instance, the metaverse will opens new possibilities in the theme park, music and videogames industries it provides substantially enhanced user experiences. Videogames are also marketing tools and a new window to promote the new attractions of theme parks. In 2022, Disney company reported that they have been granted a patent for providing metaverse functionality in their theme parks.\n\nPractical implications are considered in this study. New technologies like VR, AR or AI can help park operators to personalize each guest’s visit. Theme park operators may also offer exclusive promotions (discount price, gifts, fast track ticket or special prices) to customers who follow your park’s social media accounts, or their official websites and apps, and post about their experiences in theme parks and characters of movies and animations. Gamification and interactivity are part of the biggest technology trends in the attractions of theme parks. Another marketing strategy can be to create loyalty programs for customers who like films and videogames which are related to theme park’s rides (e.g. Avatar, Harry Potter, Peppa Pig, Mario Bros, among many others) to stimulate visitor demand, especially in this time of economic uncertainty.\n\n5.2 Limitations and future research\n\nThis study has limitations that can be addressed in future research. First, theme park operators do not show information related to the number of visitors (e.g. nationality, gender and age) in their official websites. And second and last, there is no data and surveys about why parents are motivated to take their children to visit theme parks; this information is very important to theme park operators and researchers because according to results of this information operators and researcher can analyze better visitors’ motivations and emotions.\n\nFuture research should shed lights on understanding how a specific kind of movie (action, drama, animation, cartoon, among many others), or videogames could influence the motivations, emotions and experience of visitors at theme parks. For example, movie characteristics perceived by viewers may influence their expectations when they visit theme parks. In addition, future studies need to tackle visitors’ motivations, visitors’ psychological mechanism and a direct correlation between movies and theme park’s rides through surveys in theme parks and cinemas."
