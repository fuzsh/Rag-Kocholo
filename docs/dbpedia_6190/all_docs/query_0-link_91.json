        "text": "Abang and Adi are undocumented orphans living in present-day Malaysia. While the older brother, a deaf mute, has resigned himself to a life of poverty, his younger sibling burns with indignation. A brutal accident upsets the fragile balance of their relationship.\n\nThis film is adapted from the 2010 South Korean blockbuster and tear-jerking comedy Hello Ghost. A lonely delivery man, A-wei, tries to commit suicide multiple times but fails no matter what he does. Through these failed attempts, he meets four ghosts — a smoker, a crier, a heartbroken ghost, and a mischievous ghost. In order for him to die, he learns that he has to first help these four ghosts fulfill their final wishes. In the process of doing so, A-wei befriends these four ghosts and overcomes his low self-esteem to step out of his comfort zone and experience many firsts in life.\n\nLust, shame, passion, lies and violence - the lives of individuals intertwine in an unyielding web under the red lights of Geylang. A desperate doctor searching for an organ for his daughter, a tormented prostitute paying off her lover's debt, a social worker with political inclinations willing to cross the line, and a ruthless pimp with a dark secret. Nothing is quite what it seems as a long night awaits.\n\nDriven by the desire for the huge reward, Tang Ren (by Wang Baoqiang) tricked Qin Feng (by Liu Haoran) to New York, to attend the World Detective Contest,. Later on, behind the crazy competition, Qin and Tang discovered the real hidden facts of this contest.\n\nA terminally ill man sets up his best friend, whom he has loved since high school, so that she will not be lonely after he passes away.\n\nThe fourth addition to the franchise sees the return of the army boys including Sergeant Ong, Lobang, Ken Chow and Aloysius, joined by a new female officer, as they are called back for in-camp training under the Armoured Formation of the Singapore Armed Forces. Hilarious situations happen when they are back training together and their military roles reversed. Their brotherhood is also put to the test when new enemy threats arise.\n\nMr Unbelievable tells the story of Eric Kwek Hock Seng, who takes it upon himself to the symbol of national pride. As his Shifu’s Getai business declines in popularity, Eric wants to spark new ideas by adding English lyrics into Chinese songs albeit to strong objection from his Shifu & friends. Undeterred, Eric Kwek sets on an unbelievable musical journey that sees him through mostly lows and finally hits a high when he is at the ripe old age of 50. The film aims to highlight that one must believe and persist in his aspirations regardless of age!\n\nWang Zi Hao, a Chinese Primary 6 student from Shanghai, China residing in Singapore, faces academic pressure when his new classmate Jayden Lee Jun Wei frames him for cheating to maintain his top-ranking status. Meanwhile, Zi Hao's Mother, Wen Ting, is falsely accused of illegal work by Jayden's competitive mother, Sophia. Amidst the turmoil, the two mothers realise the toll on their sons and unite to prioritise their well-being over grades, fostering reconciliation.\n\nWHAT IF, in the unforeseen future, when there are not enough boys in Singapore? If Girls have to serve National Service also, what will happen? The story will focus on the first batch of female recruits, a bunch of Gen Z teens and youngsters with different backgrounds and education. As they trained under the fierce leadership of Sergeant Chow and Lieutenant Roxanne, they find themselves being pushed to the limit of their potential. Together, they overcome hardship and initial resistance to serve NS and discover newfound abilities, using it to solve and mend relationships in their personal life as well."
