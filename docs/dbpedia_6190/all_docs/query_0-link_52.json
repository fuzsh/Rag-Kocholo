        "text": "In the realm of television, Chinese historical dramas stand as towering monuments to the country's rich heritage and storytelling prowess. As we step into 2024, the anticipation for new narratives that intertwine historical intricacies with the art of modern filmmaking has never been higher.\n\nWith leading platforms like iQIYI and Mango TV at the helm of broadcasting, viewers worldwide are on the edge of their seats, waiting to be transported back in time through the lens of these forthcoming masterpieces. This article aims to shed light on the most anticipated Chinese historical dramas of 2024, promising a blend of majestic settings, intricate plotlines, and characters that embody the depth of China's historical tapestry.\n\n1-iQiyi: The Trend is Unstoppable\n\nUnexpectedly, iQiyi is the platform with the most upcoming period dramas among the four major platforms, reaching a whopping 30. With rich themes and a powerful cast, it can be said that most highly discussed period dramas are here.\n\n\"Fox Spirit Matchmaker\" Series\n\nFirst is the \"Fox Spirit Matchmaker\" series. Adapted from the manga of the same name, it tells the love story between humans and spirits in a episodic format. As of now, the original manga has a popularity value of 18.2 billion, and the animated series of the same name has been viewed over 5 billion times across all platforms, boasting a large fan base and impressive reputation.\n\nEvery step of turning a big work into a film or TV series stirs people's hearts, from the cast to the production team. The \"Fox Spirit Matchmaker\" series can be considered top-tier in terms of configuration. This series is produced by iQiyi, Tencent Comics, and Stellar Media, with Stellar Media also being one of the producers and production teams. They previously achieved great success with the highly popular drama \"Love Between Fairy and Devil\" in 2022, and have accumulated a set of youthful creative methodologies in IP adaptation and visual presentation through multiple works. This time, taking on the task of adapting the immortal and ancient puppetry genre, many viewers have high expectations for the \"Fox Spirit Matchmaker\" series.\n\nThe casting of the three dramas in this series is also highly anticipated, generate high levels of discussion. The \"Yue Hong\" chapter stars Yang Mi (Tu Shan Hong Hong) and Gong Jun (Dongfang Yue Chu), the \"Zhu Ye\" chapter features Liu Shi Shi (Dongfang Huai Zhu) and Zhang Yun Long (Wang Quan Hong Ye), and the \"Wang Quan\" chapter stars Cheng Yi (Wang Quan Fu Gui) and Li Yitong (Qing Tong).\n\nYang Mi and Liu Shi Shi's prowess in portraying immortal and martial arts dramas is undeniable; Cheng Yi and Gong Jun are currently popular male actors born in the 1990s; Zhang Yun Long and Li Yitong may not have as much popularity as the previous actors, but they are excellent performers with excellent reputation among the audience.\n\nThe supporting cast is equally strong, with \"Yue Hong\" chapter featuring actors such as Chen Duling, Zhu Xudan, Guo Xiaoting, Zhang Linghe, and Wei Zheming, and the \"Zhu Ye\" chapter including Wu Xuanyi, Meng Ziyi, Zhang Ruonan, Shen Yue, Hou Minghao, Ding Yuxi, and Zhai Xiaowen. It's worth noting that these supporting actors have played leading roles in many dramas. With such a luxurious creative team, this drama is bound to be explosive in terms of viewership and topicality.\n\nIn terms of content, \"Fox Spirit Matchmaker\" tells its story in an episodic manner, with each chapter having a certain level of independence but also interconnectedness. For example, the three pairs of protagonists are not in the same period, but they have intricate connections. The three dramas can be roughly summarized as stories of two generations.\n\nFrom the released trailers, the makeup and styling in the \"Zhu Ye\" chapter is noticeably more refined, but the popularity and buzz surrounding Yang Mi and Gong Jun surpasses that. Both dramas have their own merits and explosive potential. Whether it's the original IP's popularity, the cast, or the buzz, \"Fox Spirit Matchmaker\" is definitely standby blockbuster, everything is ready, just waiting to be aired.\n\nFighting for Love\n\nAfter watching numerous love stories from different backgrounds, we finally welcome a major female protagonist in the historical drama \"Fighting for Love\". Adapted from the novel of the same name by Xian Cheng, the author of \"Go Princess, Go!\", this drama tells the story of A Mai, a female general who founded the Southern Xia dynasty.\n\nShe sheds her feminine attire, dons her battle robe, and undergoes arduous trials and extraordinary achievements, ultimately growing into the esteemed General Mai. Unlike typical female protagonists in period dramas, this \"warrior in battle attire instead of red garments\" is not immersed in personal affairs, but instead shoulders the responsibility of protecting her family and country, showcasing her uniqueness.\n\nThe film adaptation of this drama, also titled \"Fighting for Love\", has already begun filming, with Zhang Tianai reprising the role of the female lead. This drama is an important work in the exquisite strategy of Xitian Film and Television, and will subsequently expand into a comprehensive entertainment brand encompassing film, television, animation, and gaming. The drama is set to premiere on January 31st.\n\nThe Demon Hunter's Romance\n\nAdapted from Ban Ming Ban Mei's novel, \"The Demon Hunter's Romance\" is a rare combination of supernatural thriller and anthology format. The plot consists of six part, each telling a different supernatural story. It follows the mysterious exorcist Jiu Xuanye (played by Ren Jialun) as he encounters the young girl Ban Xia (played by Song Zu'er). Together, they navigate a world where humans and monsters coexist and embark on a romantic love story intertwined with thrilling mysteries.\n\nThe combination of supernatural elements, Chinese-style horror, and a blend of fantasy and suspense perfectly captures the aesthetic preferences of the audience, resulting in high levels of appeal. The anthology format not only enriches the content but also accelerates the pace of the series, aligning with the viewing preferences of the audience.\n\nThe chief director, Lin Yufen, is well-known for her highly successful works such as \"Chinese Paladin,\" and \"Eternal Love\". She demonstrates her expertise in this genre effortlessly. Director Liang Shengquan, who has previously directed \"Swords of Legends\" and \"Xuan-Yuan Sword\", often collaborates with Lin Yufen, making them a formidable duo.\n\nThe head screenwriter, Zhao Na, has written notable works such as \"Princess Agents\" and \"Love and Destiny\", showcasing her undeniable talent. With this reunion of the three seasoned collaborators, coupled with the professional performances of Ren Jialun and the rising star Song Zu'er, it is safe to say that \"The Demon Hunter's Romance\" has already won the race right from the starting line, starting from its exceptional creative team.\n\nA Moment But Forever\n\nTang Yan, has recently received high praise for her role as \"Miss Wang\" in \"Blossoms Shanghai\", with viewers expressing surprise at her excellent acting skills. Returning to the comfort zone of ancient drama, she is collaborating with Liu Xueyi in the adaptation of \"A Moment But Forever\". This novel adaptation, like the highly popular \"Love and Redemption\" and \"Love of Thousand Years\" from 2020, is also based on the works of Shisi Lang.\n\n\"A Moment But Forever\" tells the story of tens of thousands of years ago, during the great battle between gods and demons. The primordial god, Taihe, used the mighty artifact \"God's Left Hand\" to seal the demon god, but the artifact was broken and fell into the human realm. The gods of the primordial world fell into a deep sleep, and since then, there have been no more divine miracles in the three realms. Taking advantage of the chaos, the War Ghost Clan rose to power, triggering a great war. The goddess, Unparalleled, entrusted by the heavens, disguised herself as a human girl and entered the fox clan's dwelling as a servant to the priest, Yuan Zhong. Her plan was to retrieve the long-possessed God's Left Hand within him.\n\nHowever, unparalleled witnessed the isolation and defamation of Yuan Zhong, who could have resisted with God's Left Hand, by his own people. She felt pity and sympathy for him, and decided to protect Yuan Zhong and help him break the seal, so that they could spend the remaining time of their lives happily together. But the resurrected War Ghost Clan suddenly returned, causing panic within the fox clan.\n\nYuan Zhong, who had already been persecuted by his people and was on the verge of falling into darkness, took this opportunity to break the seal and leave the mountain. However, on the way down the mountain, he was healed by Unparalleled. The two of them expressed their feelings for each other and found mutual understanding. In the end, Yuan Zhong rescued Unparalleled, who was being persecuted by her love rival, and together they defeated Han Nü, bringing peace and order to the three realms.\n\nDirector Guo Hu's representative work in 2023 was \"Mysterious Lotus Casebook\", and his other works like \"One and Only\" have also received great acclaim. From the released trailers, the actors' performances are in excellent form.\n\nFollow Your Heart\n\nStarring Luo Yunxi and Song Yi, this drama tells the story of the cold and arrogant Prince Jiang Xinbai (played by Luo Yunxi), and his encounter with Yan Nanxing (played by Song Yi), a female traveling doctor who transforms every month. From initially being at odds with each other to working together to unravel the mysteries of the \"Wu Xiang Case\", their journey is filled with the quirks in the martial arts world. \"Yan Xin\" is not just a combination of their names, but also represents the clever idea that although appearance is important, it cannot compare to the connection of hearts.\n\nThey experience a unique and adventurous love story of \"three unions and three separations\". In the end, they join forces to eliminate the calamity of Wu Xiang, and through the challenges faced by Jiang Xinbai and Yan Nanxing, they show the audience the true meaning of love. Love is not about possession or plundering; the infatuation for love is not solely focused on external appearances. True love transcends physical attributes, social status, and grudges. It is a commitment to pursue justice and the willingness to shoulder the responsibility of protecting not only each other's love, but also the well-being of all people.\n\nThe story sounds quite interesting and novel, and it also aims to debunk the incorrect notion of judging people solely based on their appearance, emphasizing the importance of true justice. Director Yu Zhongzhong's works mostly consist of youth idol dramas, with the exception of the well-received historical drama \"Once Upon a Time in Lingjian Mountain\". It is difficult to predict the quality of \"Follow Your Heart\" due to the significant difference in style between these two works.\n\nFangs of Fortune\n\nDirected by Guo Jingming, \"Fangs of Fortune\" stars Hou Minghao, Chen Duling, Cheng Xiao, and Tian Jiarui. As a director known for his popularity, every work by Guo Jingming receives a great deal of attention from netizens. Although last year's \"My Journey to You\" had poor reviews, it generated a significant amount of buzz. \"Fangs of Fortune\" has been highly anticipated since the casting process, with every leaked frame creating a frenzy and showcasing the familiar Guo-style aesthetic. It must be said that under Guo Jingming's lens, the appearance of each actor seems to reach another level.\n\nMoonlight Mystique\n\nWhen it comes to costume dramas, one director that cannot be ignored is Zhu Ruibin. This time, he brings us \"Moonlight Mystique,\" which tells the story of Bai Shuo (played by Bai Lu), the youngest daughter of the general's manor, who unexpectedly saves the great deity of the demon race, Fan Yue (played by Aoruipeng). Their initial encounter leads to mutual utilization, and eventually, a story of mutual affection and mutual devotion unfolds. Adapted from the novel \"Bai Shuo Shang Shen,\" the author, Xing Ling, is also personally involved as the screenwriter, ensuring a reassuring plot.\n\nAlthough the official trailer has not been released yet, it is hard not to notice the exquisite and versatile appearance of the female lead in various leaked images. In charge of the styling for \"Moonlight Mystique\" is the highly acclaimed Yi Xiaoya team, responsible for the stunning Butterfly Demon in \"The Yin Yang Master\" and Guo Xiaoting's appearance in \"Love Between Fairy and Devil.\" The female lead in the original work was the goddess of the stars in her previous life and the daughter of a general in her reincarnated life, so most of the styling is delicate, with intricate hairstyles and noticeable attention to costume design.\n\nCrane Notes\n\n\"Crane Notes\" tells the story of Yang Wan, a female doctoral student in history who travels back to the Ming Dynasty and encounters Deng Ying, a eunuch from the Dong Chang, who has been the subject of her research for ten years. Deng Ying's character is described as having a \"scholarly spirit in a eunuch's body,\" and this conflicting identity and self-identity lead him to a tragic end.\n\nOn the other hand, Yang Wan, initially an observer who remains detached from the situation, gradually becomes moved and attracted by Deng Ying, attempting to change his tragic fate through her own actions. The strong sense of destiny in the original work is what captivates readers. However, it is questionable whether a time-travel drama can be made or if a eunuch can be the main character, so the plot will likely require significant revisions.\n\n2-Mango TV: Bright Creators\n\nOut of the 15 upcoming historical dramas on Mango TV, nearly half of them have yet to confirm their creators, and the original works also lack appeal, making it difficult to make predictions. Although the number of confirmed shows is only a fraction compared to iQiyi, the probability of producing a hit is not small.\n\nFlourished Peony\n\nYang Zi and Li Xian, following their collaboration in \"Go Go Squid!\" will star in this historical drama. Based on this actor pairing alone, it can be basically determined that this show will be a New Year's hit.\n\nDirector Ding Ziguang, known for works such as \"Go Ahead\" and \"Meet Yourself,\" is a talented young director. The post-90s screenwriter Zhang Yuanang, known for works such as \"Immortal Samsara\" and \"Being a Hero,\" also has considerable experience in historical works. We look forward to this young creative team bringing us a refreshing work.\n\nHe Weifang (play by Yang Zi), the daughter of a merchant, escapes from a marriage based solely on self-interest and enters the business world of Chang'an with her exceptional skills in cultivating rare peonies. With her business acumen and the help of the secretive imperial official \"Flower and Bird Master\" Jiang Changyang, He Weifang starts her floral business in the backyard of the Jiang family. With the addition of Qin Wuniang, Zhu Fu, and Lv Gengchun, He Weifang leads her sisters to showcase their talents, overcome difficulties, and together create the \"Hua Xiang Rong\" brand, allowing the fragrance of peonies to waft into every household in Chang'an in countless forms.\n\nHaving personally experienced the hardships of the people's livelihood, He Weifang redeems her ancestral property, sheltering women with troubled destinies and uncertain futures, helping them learn skills to support themselves. With Jiang Changyang's suggestion, He Weifang is determined to transform into an industrialist, establishing \"Wuyong Hall\" for oil production, medicine, and grain manufacturing for the benefit of the people. On Jiang Changyang's path of serving the country, He Weifang repeatedly assists from the sidelines, and their feelings for each other gradually grow. After experiencing numerous life-or-death situations, the two join forces to quell the rebellion and retire from the world together.\n\nShui Long Yin\n\nThis drama is adapted from Feng Ping's novel \"Enduring a Thousand Tribulations.\" It tells the story of Tang Lici (starring Luo Yunxi), a mysterious master who comes from an otherworldly place and travels and grows in the martial arts world and the land of China. In the complex and tumultuous world of intense struggles, it is a grand male protagonist narrative about his unwavering commitment to protecting the world. Apart from Luo Yunxi, the cast also includes Xiao Shunyao, Ao Ziyi, Xu Zhengxi, Xie Binbin, and others, all of whom are talented male actors.\n\nChief director Chen Zhoufei is a renowned photographer and director. The visuals presented in his photography work \"The Equation of Love and Death\" and \"Shadow,\" as well as the web drama \"The Forbidden Flower\" directed by him, are all of artistic quality. It can already be anticipated that the cinematography of \"Shui Long Yin\" will be highly enjoyable and worth looking forward to.\n\nPerfect Match\n\nThe drama is directed by Yang Huan, whose representative work is last year's sensational \"Lost You Forever\". His mastery of ancient historical drama is beyond doubt. Lu Yuxiao, Wang Xingyue, Dong Sicheng, Huang Yangdian Tian, Liu Xiening, Wu Xuanyi and others are the main actors.\n\nIt tells the story of the marriage of the five daughters of Lady Li in a historical costume romantic comedy, somewhat similar to \"Hilarious Famil\". During the reign of Emperor Renzong of the Northern Song Dynasty, Bianjing was prosperous and renowned throughout the world. Lady Li, a wealthy resident of Luoyang (played by Ni Hongjie), moved her family to Bianjing to seek refuge for her second daughter, Fu Hui (played by Wu Xuanyi), and to resolve a long-standing matter of the heart.\n\nLady Li's greatest pride in her life is having five beautiful and talented daughters, but unfortunately, her eldest daughter, Shouhua (played by Liu Xiening), became a widow at a young age and has no intention of remarrying; her third daughter, Kangning (played by Lu Yuxiao), is fierce; her fourth daughter, Haode (played by Ke Ying), is straightforward and has no filter; and her fifth daughter, Leshan (played by Huang Yangdian Tian), is overly spoiled and has high standards.\n\nThe daughters are famous in Luoyang for their beauty and talent, but their marriages have been difficult to arrange, which has become a source of distress for Lady Li. So she made a bold statement, vowing to go to the capital to find suitable matches for her daughters. Everyone eagerly rushed to Bianjing, but their confidence was shattered by reality. The second daughter was unreasonably rejected by her family, making it difficult for her to settle down. The Li family had no choice but to work together and revive their old business, gradually searching for suitable husbands who possess both virtue and talent.\n\nAlong the way, they encountered numerous setbacks and comedic moments. In the end, Lady Li's daughters all achieved their desired marriages, creating a lively comedy of love and marriage in the marketplaces of the Northern Song Dynasty. The plot is a family comedy that audiences love to watch, with the added charm of a group of handsome men and beautiful women. It is highly anticipated.\n\nUnder the Moonlight\n\nStarring Hu Bingqing and Zhai Zilu, \"Under the Moonlight \" is an original female-oriented detective drama produced by Tangren Film and Television. In the previously released trailer, titled \"Mysterious Mist\", a series of mysteries unfolded: the deep and cold prison, the figures walking in the dark night, the windows splattered with blood, the body wrapped in straw, the man struggling while hanging. Within just 30 seconds, the suspense was already heightened.\n\n\"Under the Moonlight \" takes a female perspective on detective stories, telling the story of Luo Shu, who has experienced a turbulent fate and courageously strives to save herself, meeting Qi Menglin, a spirited young man who aspires to explore the world. Together, they embark on a journey of investigating mysteries, often involving women. Whenever they see the plight of these unfortunate women, they spare no effort to seek justice for them. With perplexing cases and unpredictable human hearts, will they be able to uncover the truth behind the mysteries and discern each other's true intentions, finding true love and freedom?\n\nTangren Film and Television, as a well-known production company, should be familiar to everyone. They have produced hit dramas such as \"Time to Love,\" and \"Chinese Paladin.\" In recent years, Tangren's influence has gradually declined, with fewer self-produced dramas and fewer high-quality productions. However, Tangren's experience in historical dramas should be sufficient to support \"Under the Moonlight \" as an excellent and highly anticipated series.\n\nHistorical dramas have always been a popular genre, as they are the easiest to become hits and elevate actors to stardom. After experiencing ups and downs, historical dramas, which once reached a bottleneck, seem to have returned to their peak in the past two years, with a \"burst\" in quantity expected in 2024. Various platforms are deploying all kinds of strategies, with big IPs, all-star casts, and top-notch productions competing one after another.\n\nAs the curtains fall on our exploration of 2024's most awaited Chinese historical dramas on iQIYI and Mango TV, it's clear that this year is set to redefine the landscape of historical storytelling. These dramas, with their rich narratives, stunning visuals, and compelling performances, are not just entertainment; they are immersive experiences that invite viewers to traverse time and space, offering insights into the complexities of China's past. As we eagerly await their release, it's undeniable that these productions will captivate hearts, stir minds, and continue the legacy of Chinese historical drama as a pivotal genre in the global entertainment industry. Let us ready ourselves to be part of this extraordinary journey through history, culture, and human emotions, brought to life by the magic of television."
