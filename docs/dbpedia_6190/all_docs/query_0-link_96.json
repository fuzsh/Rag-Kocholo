For Monster Killer synopsis and ratings, see my 2015 list of best wuxia dramas.\n\nThe song choices are worth mentioning since it really fits the theme of the series that is eerily melancholic. Download Monster Killer OST here by typing the Chinese words below (no guarantee it’ll work though).\n\nLi Jian 李健 – Bei Jian Er Hu Pan 贝加尔湖畔 (Opening song)\n\nLi Qi 李琦 – Zui Chang De Li Tu 最长的旅途 (Ending song)"
