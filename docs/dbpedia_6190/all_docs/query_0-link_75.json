Thought I would share a list of popular ancient Chinese TV series, from my top 20 to the ones that you watch to pass time.\n\nThere’s just something special about the wuxia genre in addition to the exquisite costumes and beautiful scenery.

I decided to feature the most recent adaptation produced by Yu Zheng in 2013. Usually, Jin Yong novels are a must-watch for me but in this case, Yu Zheng took free reign at revising major plot points. I can accept some modifications such as Dong Fang Bu Bai being female rather than male but other story changes just didn’t make sense.\n\nIt was frustrating to see how the original pairing was supposed to be Ling Hu Chong and Ren Ying Ying but we spend a huge chunk of the drama watching the development behind Ling Hu Chong and Dong Fang Bu Bai’s possibly romantic relationship.\n\nChen Qiao En as Dong Fang Bu Bai is captivating and she quickly became my favorite character so I was quite appalled when it dawned on me how this drama was supposed to play out. I stopped watching shortly before that could happen.\n\nFemale Prime Minister\n\nIs it a must-watch, pretty good, just another drama, tolerable or downright boring?\n\nMy Ratings: Must-Watch\n\nTitle：Female Prime Minister / 陆贞传奇\n\nEpisodes and Genre: 59, Hunan TV\n\nStarring: May 2013\n\nZhao Li Ying as Lu Zhen\n\nChen Xiao as Gao Zhan\n\nSynopsis:\n\nLu Zhen is an intelligent and courageous young women who doesn’t let gender inhibit her from succeeding in business.

Will they be able to set aside their differences and save the world?\n\nComments:\n\nProduced by Tangren Media.\n\nVisually amazing as always, I watched it just for the sake of the cast and the colorful costumes. Can’t say the same about the story tho. More pictures below because it’s a waste not to post them.\n\nThe Emperor’s Harem\n\nIs it a must-watch, pretty good, just another drama, tolerable or downright boring?\n\nMy Ratings: Just Another Drama\n\nTitle：The Emperor’s Harem / Hou Gong / 后宫\n\nEpisodes and Genre: 46, Romance Drama\n\nStarring: 2011\n\nAdy An as Shao Chun Hua / Li Zi Yun\n\nFeng Shao Feng as Yang Yong\n\nSynopsis:\n\nDespite coming from a noble background, Li Zi Yun was forced to live on the streets after her father was accused of treason.

Gong is yet another time-travel drama which is a cross between Scarlet Heart and Boys Over Flowers. We have a feisty 21st century heroine constantly picked on by the boys / princes yet the stakes are much higher within the palace walls of Qing Dynasty where one wrong move can cost your life.\n\nIs it a must-watch, pretty good, just another drama, tolerable or downright boring?\n\nTitle：Legend of Zhen Huan / Empresses in the Palace / Zhen Huan Zhuan / 后宫甄嬛传\n\nEpisodes and Genre: 76, Historical\n\nBroadcast Period: 2012\n\nStarring:\n\nSun Li as Zhen Huan\n\nSynopsis:\n\nAn innocent young woman marries the Qing Dynasty emperor and learns to thrive amidst the scheming within the inner court until she ascends into a position of utmost power.—\n\nIs it a must-watch, pretty good, just another drama, tolerable or downright boring?\n\nMy Ratings: Must Watch\n\nTitle：Scarlet Heart / Startling By Each Step / Bu Bu Jing Xin / 步步惊心\n\nEpisodes and Genre: 35, Romance, Fantasy Time Travel, Historical\n\nStarring: 2011\n\nLiu Shi Shi as Maertai Ruo Xi / Zhang Xiao\n\nNicky Wu as Yin Zhen (4th Prince)\n\nSynopsis:\n\nZhang Xiao got into a fight with her boyfriend because she caught him cheating.

His group is called Yi Zhi Mei and they fight to protect the people.\n\nComments:\n\nProduced by Tangren Media.\n\nMeteor Butterfly Sword\n\nIs it a must-watch, pretty good, just another drama, tolerable or downright boring?\n\nMy Ratings: Just Another Drama\n\nTitle：Meteor Butterfly Sword / Liu Xing Hu Die Jian / 流星蝴蝶剑\n\nEpisodes and Genre: 30, Action Romance\n\nStarring: 2010\n\nBaron Chen as Meng Xing Hun\n\nSynopsis:\n\nMeng Xing Hun is an assassin of the Happy Forest led by Sister Ko. They are experts in the field but Xing Hun is tired of their lifestyle and wants to start anew.\n\nComments:\n\nBased on Gu Long novels. The movie version starring Tony Leung, Michelle Yeoh and many more is my favorite wuxia film but I didn’t like the drama version as much.\n\nIs it a must-watch, pretty good, just another drama, tolerable or downright boring?\n\nMy Ratings: Pretty Good\n\nTitle：Chinese Paladin 3 / Xian Jian Qi Xia Zhuan 3 / 仙剑奇侠传3\n\nEpisodes and Genre: 37, Action Romance / Fantasy\n\nStarring: 2009\n\nHu Ge as Jing Tian\n\nYang Mi as Tang Xue Jian\n\nSynopsis:\n\nJing Tian, a happy-go-lucky shop owner, embarks on a journey to save the world from darkness.\n\nComments:\n\nProduced by Tangren Media.

Wu Zi has to decide between principle or revenge, love or hate as he becomes entangled in the fight over the Heavenly Sword and Dragon Sabre.\n\nComments:\n\nBased on Louis Cha (Jin Yong) novels. Yang Xiao (杨逍) is my favorite character because of the 1993 version played by Sun Xing (孙兴). His portrayal of Yang Xiao left such an impression that I don’t think other versions can ever compare. Here’s Sun Xing from the 1993 version. Oh, the memories..\n\nDemi-Gods and Semi-Devils (Tian Long Ba Bu)\n\n2013 Version\n\n2003 Version\n\n1997 Version\n\nIs it a must-watch, pretty good, just another drama, tolerable or downright boring?\n\nMy Ratings: Must Watch\n\nTitle：Demi-Gods and Semi-Devils / Tian Long Ba Bu / 天龙八部 (天龍八部)\n\nGenre: Action / Romance\n\nStarring: 1997 (TVB)\n\nHuang Re Hua (黄日华) as Qiao Feng (乔峰)\n\nBenny Chan (陈浩民) as Duan Yu (段誉)\n\nCarman Lee (李若彤) as Wang Yu Yuan (王语嫣)\n\n2003\n\nHu Jun as Qiao Feng (乔峰)\n\nJimmy Lin as Duan Yu (段誉)\n\nLiu Yi Fei as Wang Yu Yan (王语嫣)\n\n2013\n\nWallace Chung as Qiao Feng\n\nKim Ki Bum as Duan Yu\n\nHan Dong as Xu Zhu\n\nSynopsis:\n\nQiao Feng is the leader of the Beggar Clan who defends the Han people from the Qi Dan. Duan Yu is a prince of Da Li who despises fighting and violence. Xu Zhu is a monk who inadvertently gains immense martial arts powers that he did not want. The three become sworn brothers and this is their story.\n\nComments:\n\nBased on Louis Cha (Jin Yong) novels. In my opinion, Jin Yong is like the Chinese version of George Lucas as he successfully created a franchise on stories filled with generations of unforgettable characters.\n\nI really think that if you like one, you’ll like them all.–\n\nThe Return of the Condor Heroes (Shen Diao Xia Lu)\n\n2015 Version\n\n2006 Version\n\n1998 Version\n\n1995 Version\n\nIs it a must-watch, pretty good, just another drama, tolerable or downright boring?\n\nMy Ratings: Must Watch\n\nTitle: The Return of the Condor Heroes / 神雕侠侣\n\nGenre: Action / Romance\n\nStarring: 1995 Version\n\nLouis Koo (古天乐) as Yang Guo (杨过)\n\nCarman Lee (李若彤) as Xiao Long Nu (小龙女)\n\n1998 Version\n\nChristopher Lee (李铭顺) as Yang Guo (杨过)\n\nFann Wong (范文芳) as Xiao Long Nu (小龙女)\n\n2006 Version\n\nHuang Xiao Ming (黄晓明) as Yang Guo (杨过)\n\nCrystal Liu (刘亦菲) as Xiao Long Nu (小龙女)\n\n2014 Version\n\nChen Xiao as Yang Guo\n\nMichelle Chen as Xiao Long Nu\n\nSynopsis:\n\nYang Guo is judged by society for being the son of a traitor. He meets and falls in love with his martial arts teacher, Xiao Long Nu, and their relationship has been deemed unacceptable by society.\n\nComments:\n\nBased on Louis Cha (Jin Yong) novels. I really like Yang Guo, a character who is not your typical protagonist. He has a dark side and in spite of society’s expectation that a traitor’s son can do no good, he embodies the characteristics of a true hero.\n\nI think the 2006 version by Crystal Liu (刘亦菲) is the most fitting for the part of ethereal beauty Xiao Long Nu but Fann Wong’s portrayal, which is the first version that I ever saw will always be my favorite.\n\nOn the other hand, the 2014 upcoming version starring Michelle Chen seems to be getting a lot of flak for her casting and unwanted changes in the screenplay. I guess it’s up to us to decide.\n\nA Step Into the Past\n\nIs it a must-watch, pretty good, just another drama, tolerable or downright boring?\n\nMy Ratings: Must Watch\n\nTitle：A Step into the Past / 尋秦記 / 寻秦记\n\nEpisodes: 40\n\nAir Date and Genre: 2001, Time Travel / Comedy / Action / Romance\n\nStarring:\n\nLouis Koo (古天樂) as Xiang Shao Long (项少龙)\n\nRaymond Lam (林峰) as Zhao Pan（赵盘）\n\nSynopsis:\n\nHong Siu Lung is a Hong Kong Police Agent afraid to commit to his long-time girlfriend Kam Ching. It was only until Kam Ching marries another that Hong Siu Lung realizes what he lost. Determined to win Kam Ching back, Hong Siu Lung volunteers to travel back into the past in hopes of undoing the present. However, things go awry when he finds himself stuck in ancient China many thousand years ago.\n\nComments:\n\nIt was hilarious to watch Louis Koo (古天樂) as Hong Siu Lung (项少龙) speak English and walk around in a T-shirt in ancient China.\n\nThe Prince of Lan Ling (Lan Ling Wang) – a ratings powerhouse!\n\nIs it a must-watch, pretty good, just another drama, tolerable or downright boring?\n\nMy Rating: Must-Watch\n\nTitle：Lan Ling Wang aka the Prince of Lan Ling / 蘭陵王 / 兰陵王\n\nEpisodes: 46\n\nAir Date and Genre: August 2013, Action / Romance\n\nStarring:\n\nFeng Shao Feng (冯绍峰) as Lan Ling Wang (兰陵王)\n\nAriel Lin (林依晨) as Yang Xue Wu (雪舞)\n\nDaniel Chan (陈晓东) as Yu Wen Yong (宇文邕)\n\nSynopsis:\n\nDuring the turbulent times of the warring states, there are four men with the potential to unite the lands and bring forth peace, one of which is Lan Ling Wang, a general of Qi. Lan Ling Wang meets Yang Xue Wu, the granddaughter of the last remaining priestess from the village of seers. It has been foretold that the one who gains her, gains the world.Despite the tragic prophecy that Lan Ling Wang will die in the hands of his own brother, Yang Xue Wu falls deeply in love. WIll they triumph against fate?\n\nComments: Loved the three leads & the supporting cast and hated Zhen Er with a passion thanks to her superb acting. It’s rare for me to find new dramas to like so Lan Ling Wang seriously reminded me of the good old times when I first discovered period dramas.\n\nThough I gotta admit, there was a fair-share of hair pulling moments when the drama started dragging midway but still an enjoyable ride overall.\n\nThe Legend of the Condor Heroes (She Diao Ying Xiong Zhuan)\n\n2008 Version – A Tang Ren Production\n\n2004 Version\n\n1994 Version\n\nIs it a must-watch, pretty good, just another drama, tolerable or downright boring?\n\nMy Ratings: Pretty Good\n\nTitle：Legend of the Condor Heroes / 射雕英雄传\n\nEpisodes and Genre: 1994 Version – 35, 2008 Version – 50, Action Romance\n\nStarring:1994 Version\n\nZhilin Cheung (张智霖) as Guo Jing（郭靖）\n\nAthena Chu (朱茵) as Huang Rong（黄蓉）\n\n2003 Version\n\nLi Yapeng (李亚鹏) as Guo Jing（郭靖）\n\nZhou Xun (周迅) as Huang Rong（黄蓉）\n\n2008 Version\n\nHu Ge (胡歌) as Guo Jing（郭靖）(main guy in Chinese Paladin)\n\nAriel Lin (林依晨) as Huang Rong（黄蓉）(main girl in It Started with a Kiss)\n\nSynopsis:\n\nGuo Jing is slow and dim-witted but he is persevering and has a good heart. He meets Huang Rong who is his antithesis, smart, pretty and cunning. This novel adaptation revolves around their love story as well as Guo Jing’s journey to becoming a great warrior who defends ancient China from the Jin empire.\n\nComments:\n\nBased on Louis Cha (Jin Yong) novels. This series is the prequel to the Return of the Condor Heroes.\n\nMy Fair Princess – a ratings powerhouse!\n\n2011 Version\n\n1998 Version\n\nIs it a must-watch, pretty good, just another drama, tolerable or downright boring?\n\nRatings: Must Watch\n\nTitle：My Fair Princess / Princess Pearl / 还珠格格\n\nEpisodes and Genre: 1998-1999 Version – 72, 2011 Version – 90, Romance / Family Drama\n\nStarring: 1998-1999\n\nVicki Zhao as Xiao Yan Zi\n\nRuby Lin as Xia Zi Wei\n\n2009\n\nLi Sheng as Xiao Yan Zi\n\nHai Lu as Xia Zi Wei\n\nSynopsis:\n\nXiao Yan Zi is a fun-loving young girl who likes martial arts. She meets Xia Zi Wei, prim and proper and her polar opposite in personality. Xia Zi Wei is actually traveling to the Palace to meet her father Qian Long, the Emperor of Qing Dynasy.\n\nEager to help, Xiao Yan Zi volunteers to go to the Palace but crazy circumstances lead the Emperor to assume that Xiao Yan Zi is his daughter hence granting her the title of Princess.\n\nComments:\n\nBased on Chiung Yao novels. Princess Pearl is a mega-hit back in 1998 that paved the way for Vicki Zhao and Ruby Lin to stardom. In fact, Fan Bing Bing who was a supporting character in this very successful drama also shot to fame and even starred in X-Men Days of Future Past as Blink. I read pretty negative reviews about the 2009 version though so it’s probably better to stick to the original.\n\nThis is not much of an wuxia but a classic in the Romance Drama genre. It has pretty one dimensional characters where the good are good and the antagonists Empress Dowager and Rong Muo Muo are monsters! Just kidding but you’ll know what I mean.\n\nJustice Bao\n\nIs it a must-watch, pretty good, just another drama, tolerable or downright boring?\n\nRatings: Must Watch\n\nTitle：Justice Bao / Bao Qing Tian / 包青天\n\nEpisodes and Genre: 1993-1994 Version – 236, Action Detective Drama\n\nStarring:\n\nJin Chao Chun as Bao Zheng\n\nKenny Ho as Zhan Zhao"
