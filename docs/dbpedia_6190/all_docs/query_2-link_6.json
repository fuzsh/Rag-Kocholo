        "text": "Veteran film executive Milt Barlow has left as CEO of Tangren Cultural Group, an Australia-based, multi-territory distributor of Chinese movies, amid allegations on both sides of breach of contract.\n\nBarlow sold his Asia Releasing company to Tangren in mid-2018 and became its CEO at the end of the year, but said he has now issued a breach-of-contract notice and plans to follow up with legal action against the company, possibly including a petition to shut it down.\n\n“It became obvious to me in January that the structure and funding of the company was not something that I felt comfortable with,” Barlow told Variety. “Multiple breaches of my contract with Tangren over the past three months with no offer of resolution unfortunately forced my hand to issue a breach-of-contract notification to Tangren at the end of April and to end my association with the company.”\n\nTangren has hit back, saying that...\n\nAfter a brutal first quarter for most Chinese movie studios, companies from the Middle Kingdom are still out in force at the Cannes Film Festival, but in search of quality and value for money instead of swagger and prestige.\n\nAbout 600 Chinese representatives have flocked to the Cote d’Azur, about the same number as last year, according to the festival. But industry execs say Chinese buyers are likely to be more circumspect and price-conscious, with their sights set on a limited number of plum acquisitions.\n\nThat contrasts with last year, when Fan Bingbing was still strutting her stuff on the Croisette and China rights to her “355” project with Jessica Chastain traded hands for a reported $20 million. A major tax crackdown, a new industry regulator and a slowing box office have since created a winter freeze in China worthy of “Game of Thrones.” Production has plummeted, financiers have fled and audiences have grown pickier,...\n\nSo far in its short history, Tangren Cultural Film is little known outside the specialty film corner of its Australian home base. But splashy branding, useful give-aways, and an events program at the American Film Market in Santa Monica are aimed at quickly raising its profile.\n\nThat is in keeping with the leap to another level that Tangren is already engineering in Australasia and which it is planning next to take to North America.\n\nThe company was established last year in Australia, and initially operated as a marketing partner on Chinese movies acquired and released by other companies. Tangren’s unique selling point was its connection between advertisers and the diaspora populations of ethnic Chinese in Australian cities.\n\nAfter getting its feet on the ground, Tangren took the decision to acquire rights on its own account and — after Madman Entertainment handled its first two titles — to operate as a distributor in its own right.\n\nVeteran film distributor Milt Barlow has been appointed as president and CEO of Tangren Cultural Group, a leading Australian distributor of Asian movies. He takes over as CEO following the exit of former CEO Kristy Wang.\n\nBarlow has been COO of Tangren since May, when the company acquired Barlow’s Asia Releasing. He was previously CEO of Village Roadshow between 1988 and 1998, launched\n\nNew Zealand-based Incubate, and co-found China Lion, a company which since 2010 released 50 Chinese films in North America.\n\nTangren began operating as a distributor in Australia and New Zealand last year and has rapidly scaled up, to claim a nearly 50% share of the Antipodean market for Asian theatrical content. Tangren is now planning an “aggressive launch” into North America and Europe in 2019. Plans include the opening of a L.A.-based HQ with some 35-40 staff.\n\n‘In a short space of time Milt has taken Tangren to new heights.\n\nBrisbane-based Tangren Cultural Film Group has acquired multinational company Asia Releasing, a distributor and marketing firm specializing in the handling of Chinese films. Milt Barlow, industry veteran and Asia Releasing founder, will stay on as COO of Tangren.\n\nTangren has quickly built up a 60% market share of the box office for Chinese and Korean movies in Australia. It recently released “Along With the Gods 1 & 2,” China’s “Operation Red Sea” and “How Long Will I Love You.” The company has a current slate of 25 to 30 films for the next year, in Australia, New Zealand, North America and the U.K.\n\nTangren expects to have a major presence at this year’s American Film Market in November. It will open a North American hub in Los Angeles in the first months of 2019 and is evaluating other markets.\n\nPreviously president and CEO of Village Roadshow Entertainment, Barlow was a co-founder and CEO of China Lion,...\n\nMilt Barlow’s Asia Releasing (Ar) will handle the theatrical release of Pang Ho Cheung’s Aberdeen in North America.\n\nAr is handling the film on behalf of Australian/New Zealand distributor and rights holder Magnum Films. The North America release is scheduled for May 8. Magnum will handle the Australia/Nz release.\n\n“I am delighted that Jason Lau, CEO of Magnum, has entrusted this wonderful picture to Asia Releasing,” said Barlow.\n\n“I was heavily involved in Pang Ho-cheung’s previous films Vulgaria and Love In The Buff with China Lion so it is a great personal delight to have been given the honour again. We will release day-and-date with China, Hong Kong and Australia & New Zealand.”\n\nMagnum Films CEO Jason Lau said: “Milt has a terrific depth of knowledge and relationships in North America with Chinese films and we are delighted to be partnering with Asia Releasing for this important release.

The goal: to bring more American movies to China and co-finance more Chinese films. China Lion Distribution, now partially owned by Huayi Brothers Media Corp. and Bona Film Group, is on the hunt for projects that resonate beyond China. \"We're looking for stories that will work in China and also have the ability to travel outside of China,\" Milt Barlow, China Lion's CEO, told TheWrap Monday. Barlow said...\n\nCraig T. Mathew China Lion Chairman Greg Coote, AMC President of Programming Robert J. Lenihan, China Lion President Jiang Yanming and China Lion CEO Milt Barlow\n\nHuayi Brothers Media Corp. and Bona Film Group Ltd., two of China’s largest film production companies, said Sunday they were each acquiring up to 20% of start-up distribution company China Lion Film Distribution, with the goal of introducing more of their films to the U.S. market. The terms of the deal were not disclosed.\n\nThanks again to Film Biz Asia and Patrick Frater for covering the subject to distribution models.

Milt Barlow, head of China Lion Film Distribution,…...\n\nA scene from “3D Sex and Zen”\n\nThe world’s first 3-D erotic film is about to hit American shores. China Lion Film Distribution said Thursday it acquired the U.S. and Canadian rights for “3D Sex and Zen: Extreme Ecstasy,” a Hong Kong soft-core adult film that opened in parts of Asia and other global markets last month. China Lion Chief Executive Milt Barlow said his company was “still in conversations with its theatrical partners” in the U.S.\n\nA box office record-setting 3D film, the first of its kind featuring groundbreaking anatomy and created buzz all around the world.\n\nNo, not \"Avatar.\" This one's bigger. America, get ready to enter \"3D Sex and Zen: Extreme Ecstasy,\" the Hong Kong-produced 3D porn film -- the first of its kind -- that beat out James Cameron's epic at the city's box offices.\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter relays that the film has been purchased for American distribution by China Lion Film Distribution, though a release has yet to be confirmed. The film, about a sexually frustrated teacher in ancient China who finds herself in a harem, made $351,000 on its first day in theaters in Hong Kong, selling out for its entire first week on screens.\n\nMore recently, it beat box office competition down under in Australia and New Zealand, beating out the likes of \"Scream 4\" and \"Fast Five\" in per-screen gross.\n\nWhen we ran the story about 3D Sex and Zen: Extreme Ecstasy beating the opening day box office [1] record in Hong Kong of the all-time box office champion, Avatar, it was just kind of a joke. Those of us in North American never actually thought we'd get to see the movie in theaters. But now, we just might. According to The Hollywood Reporter, China Lion Film Distribution has picked up the erotic Chinese blockbuster for North American distribution, though no release date has been set. As previously stated, 3D Sex and Zen: Extreme Ecstasy is a remake of a 1991 film of the same name about a sexually frustrated teacher in ancient China who gets wrapped up in the harem of a new friend. Featuring full nudity and “camouflaged lovemaking” but no actual penetration, Sex and Zen is billed as “the world’s first 3-D erotic film.” When it opened in April,..."
