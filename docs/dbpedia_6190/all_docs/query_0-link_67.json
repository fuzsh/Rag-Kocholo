        "text": "Life treasure rough man + genius young meat, a combination of scouts who repel each other\n\n\"Detective Chinatown\", written and directed by Chen Sicheng, started with a young Qin Feng (Liu Haoran) who was interviewed at the police academy and was half-forced by his grandmother to go to Bangkok, Thailand to find a distant cousin, known as \"the detective.\" Tang Ren (played by Wang Baoqiang) took a good time. Unexpectedly, Tang Ren said he was a detective. He was just a private detective who was afraid of rapists, looked for cats and dogs, and believed in Feng Shui. He was also suspected of stealing gold and killing his comrades. Wanted by the police... The relaxing vacation was completely immersed, but Qin Feng showed off his talented insight and reasoning ability. A serious case-handling, a serious trouble-making, the most messy partner of the old and the young is about to conquer the world!\n\nAlthough the theme is \"Chinatown\", the three episodes are each set in Thailand, the United States, and Japan. Under the circumstances where social culture and traditional characteristics are completely different, will it affect the style and narrative method of the movie? \"Detective Chinatown\", which features a rich plot, can it cover everything as the story map expands?\n\nBangkok gold theft and murder case: floating market, ladyboy show! The truth cannot escape the eyes of the Great Buddha\n\nAfter all, Thailand is the first stage of the \"Detective Chinatown\" series (including online dramas). The script is based on Chinatown. The victims, suspects, murderers, detectives and criminals are all Chinese. Tang Ren and Detective Kuntai Local The dress up, the old Chinese songs that sound from time to time in the soundtrack are cleverly integrated into the humanities of Southeast Asia, and the local floating markets, seductive men, and urban buildings and crowded buildings reflecting the gap between the rich and the poor are also arranged in the scene, not to mention that Thailand is based on Buddhism. The large, lofty and sacred Buddha statue has become an important clue to solving the case, but it is a pity that Tang Ren said that he would take Qin Feng to visit one of the landmarks-the Mangu Grand Palace, which was only slightly taken in the scene of chasing and fleeing.\n\nSudden change in comedy style! The girl's smile makes her back chill\n\nThe first episode took more time on character appearances, character setting, and relationship establishment. Although the case itself is not attractive, Qin Feng’s memory comparison skills and the technical special effects of the self-built GPS search network in the body are very interesting. The on-site technique highlights the immersive effect, and I won’t get bored after watching three episodes. Qin Feng’s serious personality and stuttering characteristics complement Tang Ren’s open mind and nonsense. The plot progresses smoothly under the balance that no one can drop the connection. However, when the two find the key figure in solving the case-the girl Sinuo (Zhang Zi Maple ornaments), a layer of mysterious and treacherous gauze covers the originally relaxed and joyful tone, leaving a meaningful reversal ending. The evil smile that flashed under the girl's innocent appearance must have made many viewers creepy, and it also laid the foundation for \"Chinatown Detective\" to think carefully behind the funny style.\n\nNew York City's unchallenged serial homicides: pinch your fingers! Come with beer, step on the heavy machine to catch the murderer!\n\nThe godfather of Chinatown in New York, United States, Uncle Qi, whose grandson was murdered in the Fire Temple, he held the \"World Famous Detective Competition\" to attract talents from all over the world to handle this case. The prize money is as high as 5 million dollars (Dollars)! Upon hearing this, Tang Ren deceived Qin Feng to New York on the grounds of marriage, and the detective partner was dispatched again.\n\nSpeaking of New York, it is naturally an important economic city, a symbol of the success of the so-called \"American Dream\"! Using Taylor Swift’s song \"Welcome to New York\" as the episode, Tang Ren wears a thick necklace with a dollar symbol, a leopard coat with loose knee-length shorts, a pair of sunglasses on his face, and a hip-hop look. It's not surprising that when shooting the MV, it's not surprising to come directly to the rap. Of course, many American elements are added to the film. For example, brawny men with turbans, denim vests and big beards gather in the bar, each with a glass of beer, all muscles, and a twist of the car key is a row of wild heavy machines; Or Tang Ren, Qin Feng, and Song Yi driving the New York Central Park carriage that is now invisible, chasing soldiers on the road, and generally speaking, the murderer of serial murders (Macdonald triad) is not \"Coke, French fries, Hamburg\", but \"bedwetting, arson, cruelty to animals\"!\n\nIn addition, when it comes to American criminal movies, it is naturally a slogan. Autopsy and scientific identification are required. With the addition of handsome white doctors and beautiful mixed-race criminal police officers, the whole atmosphere thinks which episode of CSI: Crime Scene Investigation is. That's not okay, how can our \"Tangren\" main Key be pulled away! In addition to the victims still having trouble with the Chinese, this episode also includes the most Chinese culture: Five Elements Fengshui, Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches, Altars and Cultivation... I pointed it out to you!\n\nThe Mysterious Preserved Egg ignites the fuse, officially exploding \"Tang Tan Universe\"\n\nThe director and screenwriter Chen Sicheng's ambition to build \"Tang Tang Cosmos\" stimulated the engine in the second episode. \"Crimaster\", who let Qin Feng bury his head on his mobile phone at the beginning of the scene, established a new story network in the movie. Detectives from all over the world are rushing to reason about the unsolved unsolved cases online to win the world rankings, and at the same time make a reasonable appearance under the call of Uncle Qi. Give full play to their strengths. For example, Crimaster ranked third, Japan’s Noda Hao (Tsumo Mu Satoshi), and the fifth Hong Kong female hacker KIKO (Shang Yuxian) all joined the protagonist group later, and actor Xiao Yang was based on \"Song The character \"Yi\" has rejoined the battle. Although it is only a small foot in 1998, it is with Qin Feng, the second-ranked mystery character \"Q\" (which is regarded as poker in the play). The \"Queen\" in the card, which Tang Ren called the \"preserved egg\") is closely related. In addition to the unsolved unsolved cases on the table, the huge gears behind it also began to rotate.\n\nTokyo Jidao Assassination: Don't break the secret room or call it a detective. Saint Seiya also appeared in surprise!\n\nSchool: \"Why do you want to be a policeman?\"\n\nQin Feng: \"Because I want to complete a perfect crime.\"\n\nA piece of paper cannot stand, it can only be done by folding it into two opposite sides. This is the main axis of \"Detective Chinatown\" from the first episode: light and darkness are two sides, good and evil are separated by a single line, you can be a good detective, and you can also commit a perfect crime that no one can solve. Facing the problem of choosing one of two, how does Qin Feng resist the temptation of the gods, resist the fall of the beast, and insist on his humanity?\n\nJapanese gang boss Watanabe Katsumi (played by Miura Tomokazu) and the Southeast Asian Chamber of Commerce eldest brother Suchawei made a one-on-one negotiation at Jushuitang for the management of the business district of Chinatown. They only heard a scream from Suchawei in the room, his secretary Kobayashi Kuna (Nagasawa Masami) broke into the room with his men, only to see that Suchawei had been stabbed and fell to the ground. The opposite seat was lying on the floor, fainted by the drug, and Watanabe Katsumi with traces of a murder weapon in his palm. Because there were only two people in the same room at the scene, there were a large number of people guarding the door. In this secret room murder case, Watanabe was listed as a suspect for reconnaissance. Noda Hao urgently called out the \"Chinatown detective\" partners-Tang Ren and Qin Feng flew to Tokyo, Japan to help. .\n\nYes, when it comes to Japanese original reasoning works, there are too many to mention, and the secret room technique is even standard. The actors in this episode, such as Yuka Miura, Masami Nagasawa, and Someya Masada, are all familiar faces in the reasoning drama, just like me. Movie fans who are familiar with Japanese works will definitely find it extra cordial. In addition, the elements that can be played in Japan and are well-known to the public range from tradition to trend and are enough to fill every scene of the entire movie: office workers with briefcases in hand, suits, and explosive combat performance; open money Tang’s curtains are full of tattooed extreme men; to quote the famous line of \"The Kindaichi Case Files\":\n\n\"I swear by my grandpa's reputation.\"\n\nThere are also ninjas, kendo, sumo, Akihabara, Cosplay... the final battle is to decide life and death in court. After all, the \"Gyakuten Saiban\" series produced by Japan's CAPCOM company is an extension of stage dramas, animations, movies, and comics. In the classic debating and reasoning game, even Qin Feng had to shout: \"Objection あり! (I protest)\" to burn!\n\nComedy with serious reasoning? Or a serious and funny reasoning movie?\n\nTomokazu Miura, Masami Nagasawa, Masami Someya...the famous actors from across generations gathered together, each has its own dazzling features, especially the wanted criminal Murata Akira, played by Masata Someya, who bears the burden of reversing the plot and reveals it. \"Q\"'s real pusher, although only appeared in a few short scenes, the lazy eyes of the signature make people hard to guess, and the calm but mocking tone and sentence shook Qin Feng's heart. However, although the rivalry between the actors is wonderful, and the addition of local features makes each episode have a different experience, what really affects \"Detective Chinatown\" still depends on its own direction setting.\n\nEach episode is more than two hours long. I not only want to develop the mystery and analysis of Qin Feng’s story axis, but also want to retain Tang Ren’s nonsensical laughter comedy. The first episode can maintain balance. With the advent of Q, it is written The plot is becoming more and more complicated, and it must take into account suspense, funny, reasoning and wit... In the third episode, it has been a little bit of self-consciousness. Coupled with the heavyweight actor who debuted at the end, there must be a bloody storm next. How to choose in the future, can only wait for the next episode to be continued.\n\nA holy place for reasoning fans, see you again in London!\n\nEven so, the third episode has been finalized and the sequel will be staged in London, England. As a fan of detective novels, Qin Feng is accustomed to putting his hands on his chest and touching his fingers while thinking. How can he be the same as the famous detective Sherlock Holmes? Let go of 221B Baker Street in London? As the hometown of \"Sherlock Holmes\" author Arthur Conan Doyle and \"Murder on the Orient Express\" author Agatha Christie, the United Kingdom, what kind of new stage \"Detective Chinatown 4\" will arrange, I still look forward to it!"
