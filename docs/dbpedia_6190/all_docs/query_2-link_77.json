Form Home Entertainment Joint Venture\n\nThose big-grossing Chinese releases don’t typically break out internationally but the second film did take $2m in North America, also via Warner Bros, opening in around 115 theaters.\n\nNow, the studio is betting it can surpass that total with the new film, and is giving it one of the widest releases of a Mandarin-language film in North America in recent years.\n\nThe pic rolls out on January 24, day-and-date with the film’s release in China via Wanda Pictures, which is timed to coincide with Chinese New Year, typically one of China’s biggest-grossing days at the box office.\n\nAs we revealed last week, the film is also receiving a UK release at the same time.\n\nIn the third movie, again written and directed by Sicheng Chen, Chinatown detectives Tang Ren and Qin Feng head to Tokyo to join Japanese investigator Noda Hiroshi on a high-profile case involving the murder of a powerful businessman.\n\nBest of Deadline\n\nStan Lee's Legacy: Ranking The Hollywood Heroes Co-Created By The Marvel Comics Icon\n\nDisney-Fox Deal: How It Ranks Among Biggest All-Time Media Mergers"
