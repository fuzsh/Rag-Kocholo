        "text": "I know there are no news on the other cast yet. But someone asked \"Cheng Yu\" (actress Wang Ting 王汀) on 25 Jan in her weibo....if she would be in the Pillow Book, Wang Ting replied a smiling face....w/o saying yes or no.\n\n* All in chinese.\n\nhttps://www.weibo.com/1984841003/FFh2KtG0z?filter=hot&root_comment_id=4200073363477770&type=comment#_rnd1517241350552\n\nFurthermore her weibo has followed the Pillow Book official weibo as well.\n\nFor the 3rd prince Lian Song , the actor Li Dong Heng 李东恒....someone also asked in his weibo but he didn't reply anything. The closest ref was in dec 2017, a short clip where someone asked him if his char and Cheng Yu would be together or not, he replied something like why u r so concerned? (the way he said it, think it's dialect or strange accent).\n\nhttps://www.weibo.com/1274104135/FAHBKyBSP?from=page_1003061274104135_profile&wvr=6&mod=weibotime&type=comment\n\nBtw he, Wang Xiao 王骁 (the actor as Si Ming) and Vengo Gao Weiguang attended a friend's wedding in nov 2017.\n\nSpoiler\n\n1st pic....Wang xiao (2nd guy), Li Dong Heng (bottom right).\n\n2nd pic. Vengo (left), Wang (right)\n\nSame, Wang Xiao was also asked about his Si Ming's role...he didn't reply. But one thing is he is under the same agency 嘉行传媒 as Vengo and Reba....all under Yang Mi. And this company is directly involved in the drama. So my guess is chances is quite high.\n\nWang's weibo : https://www.weibo.com/u/1505989231\n\n5 hours ago, Cedric Ong said:\n\nOriginal short black one....cenching is referring to his modern day hair, right?\n\nYa, as Donghua, think the long white hair piece mildly \"stretched\" his face....so less wrinkles....and maybe the lighting and some post-production enhancement, he look more \"immortal\".\n\nThen if referring to his human emperor appearance, perhaps the long beard didn't suit his look.\n\nFrankly speaking Gao has an unusual look (but he said he's 100% han chinese) which some chars' hairstyle and look doesn't look good on him (except Donghua of course)....eg Xuan-Yuan Sword - Han Cloud.\n\nReveal hidden contents\n\nYup, I am referring to his own hair.... I don’t like his human Emperor looks also. He looked the best as DH. He looks mixed though plus he got the height.\n\nChina is a huge country with equally huge population and thousands years of civilisation. I am sure somewhere along the line there was a cross breeding.... Me myself also a Chinese that doesn’t look like Chinese too....\n\nTbh, not many actors look good in ancient styling. The hair particularly can either made them extraordinarily gorgeous or extraordinarily dreadful....IMO, actors with classic Chinese features look best in ancient garbs. While almost all actresses look good in ancient styling.\n\nIn Peach Blossoms, I was a bit put off with YeHua’s Sadako hairstyle at first but MC made it up with his stellar acting....\n\nDang!! Can I unseen that picture of Gao in the spoiler?!?!? It destroyed my mental image of DH completely......\n\nI read that Dilireba fans are not happy that she is doing this drama, which was surprising to me. They sent a letter to the company with reasons why they think this is a bad choice for her. I dont think they like her company too much. But without her company I dont think she would be as popular since her company really pushed for her.\n\nI do agree that she has worked too many times with Vengo, which is something this company likes to do and it gets tiring, but this is the only time where I think she is set to gain a lot more. I honestly dont see a downside to this role even if it is a webdrama.\n\n17 hours ago, mrsyooknit said:\n\nI read that Dilireba fans are not happy that she is doing this drama, which was surprising to me.

I honestly dont see a downside to this role even if it is a webdrama.\n\nYa like they know best, being a fan doesn't make you an agent. I agree that she did many rules with Vengo, but this time their characters were a hit, and no one wants to see other actors portray them, like its custom made to fit them. besides, Dili pretty much did all the chasing before and was complaining, so maybe this time she can have her wish (maybe she did with P&P but didn't watch it?), and vengo can be the lead instead of a second or a third lead, and hope they will find other things to complain about besides this *rolleyes*\n\nI might not have read all her fans' comments....but one is she said before she wants to do challenging and different roles....while this Feng Jiu role is the same. But some do look forward to it b'cos she might act the role differently....i think it depends on how they retain or change the storyline of the Pillow Book...if it's a full reboot from the 1st drama....or is there continuation?\n\nThe other concern from some of her fans is of course the dispute of the originality of the Three Lifetimes series by that author....the dispute is she copied from other authors' work. And in China, there are many viewers who would just criticise the actors, their company etc for taking up such adapted dramas (from disputed novels). Here...her fans are not criticising anyone but just want to protect her from such criticism.\n\nAnd the one mentioned in previous post (by mrsyooknit)....that she is paired up with Vengo in too many dramas. This I think it shouldn't be the case where they don't like Vengo....but this scenerio reflects how she is almost always cast under her company-produced/involved dramas...it's mentioned that she is signed under them for 15yrs (this i don't know, it's really that long??).\n\nThus they feel she will miss chances to act in other dramas (or movies) which might help more in her acting career...or unable to pair up with different actors for versatility (think her other co-star from same company is Zhang Binbin). But for record, she also acted with other actors eg Peter Sheng, Deng Lun, Vic Chou etc.\n\nI know it's not distributed or produced by croton....and the director is different also. There's another related concern which i can't confirm....think the budget/resources used is lower than the 1st drama....so her fans are worried that the new drama would be not as good.\n\nWell, to me....same as some of u feel, Reba is Feng Jiu. I don't see much harm in taking up the role again. It's a well-received role. Perhaps as suggested, she can add something new and better to it in the new drama.\n\n@Cedric Ong\n\nI do agree that Jaywalk likes using all their artists over and over again on their dramas. Very few of them have roles outside their in house productions. Even for Dilireba, most of her roles are Jaywalk productions. So while I dislike the repetition of the same cast members they do it to make them popular. They put them all in YangMi's dramas, then the ones that they are heavily promoting, e.g.DLR, get their own drama and they stick the other ones there. So far it has worked for them, just look at how many of them got popular after TMOPB. Another company that has done this with success is Tangren Media.\n\nI personally wish they could tone it back a little, even Tangren spreads their artists out a bit more. But I don't think her fans made the right decision with this, even to me it is obvious that Jaywalk is putting 150% of their effort to make DLR popular. They push super had for her, which is why she had such a good 2017.\n\n@ReemKanabta\n\ntotally unrelated to this topic but I just love JCW, Poirot (which not many people love) and we share favorite Star Trek series <3"
