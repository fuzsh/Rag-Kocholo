        "text": "Hello folks, here‚Äôs a fun compilation series we are adding to the blog~\n\nThe surging of the dramas adapted from novels have pretty much been heavily populated in the Chinese entertainment industries with classic novels such as Journey to the West hitting both the small and big screens. In order to minimize the length of each part (hopefully this will be a series type of thing and we can write about older dramas later), we will pick more recent c-dramas adapted from novels to introduce/review for some of the viewers! As for folks that have seen any of these dramas so far, what‚Äôs your review for that drama(s)?\n\nNote: I‚Äôve put the links to eng subs of drama series (most of them have some sort of subtitles) along with the NovelUpdates link (which will provide links of any group translating the novel along with novel reviews).\n\nReviews from authors of this blog are highlighted in their own colors and are written after each drama.\n\nTitle: (Ê≠•Ê≠•ÊÉäÂøÉ ) Bu Bu Jing Xin | English title: Scarlet Heart | Also known as: Startling By Each Step | Genre: Romance, period drama | Broadcast network: Hunan TV | Episodes: 35 | Broadcast period: 2011-Sep-10 to 2011-Sep-29\n\nDrama Link: Scarlet Heart TV Series (Subbed by Viki team)\n\nNovel Translation Link: Startling By Each Step by Tong Hua\n\nChocolateCosmos: This drama pretty much introduced me to researching on Chinese romantic novels and revive my interest in Chinese entertainment. I remembered playing the ending song, Three Inches of Heaven, on repeat for months after watching this drama that was so memorable to me. Although some people who read the novel first have pointed out that the drama did not include all of the scenes from the novel, overall it was a solid adaptation and probably one of the better quality works from Tangren Media. It was the drama that propelled Liu Shi Shi to even greater fame and made me noticed more of her works after this drama. This was also the drama that helped blossom the love between Liu Shi Shi and her now husband, Nicky Wu who starred as fourth prince. Such a bonus for me who shipped Ruoxi and Fourth Prince since I felt sad after the drama ended lol.\n\nfireflymaoh: I didn‚Äôt read the novel, but I loved the drama. It was amazing and just beautifully done. A classic for me. The fact that Liu ShiShi married Nicky Wu made it even better, I felt like they had a fairytale ending. ‚ù§\n\niiangelx3: I didn‚Äôt read the novel either but this was one of the first few historicals that I watched. Still love it to this day!\n\nVictaorious: Bubujingxin was the first Asian drama I ever watched‚Ä¶ and I still consider one of the best dramas. Such high quality ‚Äì from the cinematography to the acting, I loved this drama. It made me giddy and broke my heart at the same time. Fair warning: it is not a happy ending. But, I would (and have) watched it again! However, the leads ended up together, which makes this drama even more amazing. It produced a reel-to-real couple who are happily married üôÇ I have to admit, I did experience second lead syndrome (absolutely adored Lin Gengxin‚Äôs 14th prince).\n\nTitle: (Èî¶Áª£Êú™Â§Æ ) Jin Xiu Wei Yang | English title: Princess Weiyoung| Genre: Romance, period drama | Broadcast network: Dragon TV | Episodes: 54 | Broadcast period: 2016-Nov-11 to 2016-Dec-9\n\nDrama Link: Princess Weiyoung (Subbed by Dramafever)\n\nNovel Translation Link: Princess Wei Yang by Qin Jian\n\nChexmix: Even though the drama and novel did not align at all (except for maybe some of the names and a little of the content), I still liked both nonetheless. Different but good in their own way. Though I still wish they could have translated Weiyoung‚Äôs ruthlessness to the drama even if slightly. She would be such a badass female lead if they did! hahaha\n\nChocolateCosmos: Definitely less female lead‚Äôs ruthlessness than the novel and less brutal lol. A bit PG in my opinion, which is not bad. I agree with Chexmix that I wanted Weiyoung to be even more badass. Everyone did her wrong except Luo Jin‚Äôs character aha. Luo Jin definitely shined in this drama and I love the couple‚Äôs bts ‚ù§\n\niiangelx3: I started the novel after watching the first few episodes but dropped the drama and finished the novel. I love the novel but I probably will never finish the drama.\n\nfireflymaoh: I also started reading the novel after the drama started. I thought the drama was really good at first but then it got draggy and repetitive and I ended up dropping it towards the end. I liked the main couple and both second leads, even if they were pretty evil. I really liked the novel and I wish the drama had adapted her ruthlessness, but I do realize it would have been hard to explain without the rebirth aspect.\n\nTitle: (ÊùâÊùâÊù•‰∫Ü) Shan Shan Lai Le | English Title: Boss and Me | Also known as: ÊùâÊùâÁöÑÁæéÂë≥Áà±ÊÉÖ Shan Shan De Mei Wei Ai Qing, ÊùâÊùâÊù•ÂêÉ Shan Shan Lai Chi| Genre: Romance, Modern Drama | Episodes: 34 | Broadcast network: JSTV | Broadcast period: 2014-Jul-08 to 2014-Jul-20\n\nDrama Link: Boss and Me TV Series (Episode 1) Unfortunately, Viki took down their channel for Boss and Me. I‚Äôve linked the first episode on youtube (thanks to the subbers), and I saw that the related videos help direct people to the next episode or so. There are other sites when google searched for this drama, but I will refrain from posting them since I can‚Äôt vouch for how safe their sites are.\n\nNovel Adaptation Link: Come and Eat, Shan Shan by Gu Man\n\nFireflymaoh: I have read the novel and seen the drama like a million times. In fact, I am rewatching it as I write this. It is just a feel-good romantic story. I did like the novel better because it avoided a lot of unnecessary drama. It was sweeter and even more centered around their relationship. That being said the drama was a really good adaptation of the novel. Zhao Liying really captured ShanShan for me.\n\nChocolateCosmos: Gosh Shan Shan and Feng Teng are so cute together. Such a feel good drama like what fireflymaoh said. I like how even when the secondary leads were annoying, but eventually problems were resolved and the secondary leads aren‚Äôt that bad (I was more forgiving on this drama lol). There was definitely more growth from Shan Shan in the drama compared to the novel that was more lighthearted.\n\nVictaorious: Before watching this drama, I did not know who Zhao Liying was. After watching this, I was intrigued and kept watching all of her works. I became a fan. Before that, I was not interested in C-dramas. However, Boss & Me is just such a touching and inspiring drama that was both fluffy and dark. Overall, it is a relatively light and sweet drama. Zhao Liying is so adorable as Shanshan‚Ä¶ I was impressed by Shanshan‚Äôs growth as a person, and Zhao Liying‚Äôs portrayal. In general, the other characters were funny and entertaining! Not too much angst. It‚Äôs one of my favourite dramas, and I adore Shanshan and Feng Teng together. It‚Äôs one of the most shippable OTPs. Plus, it‚Äôs a happy ending!\n\nChexmix: Love both the novel and drama! I‚Äôm really glad they kept her monologue from the novel in the drama because those humor made the drama much more interesting. Also Gu Man‚Äôs writing style made the novel a very easy read. Would definitely recommend her novels to anyone who want to do some light-hearted reading.\n\nTitle: (ÂæÆÂæÆ‰∏ÄÁ¨ëÂæàÂÄæÂüé) Wei Wei Yi Xiao Hen Qing Cheng | English title: Love O2O | Also known as: Just One Smile is Alluring | Genre: Romance (Campus Love Story) | Episodes: 30 | Broadcast network: JSTV | Broadcast period: 2016-Aug-22\n\nDrama Link: Love O2O TV Series (Subbed by Dramafever)\n\nNovel Translation Link: A Slight Smile is Very Alluring by Gu Man\n\nChocolateCosmos: Gaaaaah, so much pretty. This is one of the fluffiest dramas I have seen in recent years. I felt the romance for this was even more fluffy than Shan Shan sometimes lol. It was basically a smooth sailing romance story taking place on campus. The drama definitely did a solid job adapting the novel.\n\niiangelx3: Love, love the novel and drama! I agree it‚Äôs one of the fluffiest dramas, and that‚Äôs probably the reason why I love it so much. The two leads have so much trust towards each other they nothing gets in their way.\n\nfireflymaoh: I have not read the novel so far, but I am planning to read it one of these days. The drama has really pretty graphics, but I have been stuck on episode 19 for almost two years now, maybe one day. It looks fluffy and sweet.\n\nVictaorious: At first, I was not excited for this drama. Although I like both leads, I have never been able to finish any of Zheng Shuang‚Äôs dramas. While initially hesitant, I am so glad I watched it. If you‚Äôre looking for a light, fluffy drama with no angst, this is it! I liked how the leads faced no obstacles and were able to be together from the beginning. Although I did not read the novel, I highly enjoyed the drama! Beautiful people, beautiful cinematography, and amazing chemistry amongst the whole cast. Very entertaining and heart-warming. Yang Yang is definitely alluring in this drama‚Ä¶\n\nChexmix: This was the drama that got me into binge reading gaming novels! (Just this and King‚Äôs Avatar) hahhaa It was such a novelty for me when I first watched it. I had a hard time following all the actions in words tho‚Ä¶ I much prefer the visual in the drama.\n\nTitle: (‰Ωï‰ª•Á¨ôÁÆ´Èªò) He Yi Sheng Xiao Mo | English title: My Sunshine | Also known as: Silent Separation| Genre: Romance , Drama (School Life) | Episodes: 32 | Broadcast network: DragonTV | Broadcast period: Jan 10, 2015 ‚Äì Jan 25, 2015\n\nDrama Link: My Sunshine (It is subbed online thanks to Viki volunteers)\n\nNovel Translation Link: Heyi Shengxiao Mo by Gu Man\n\nFireflymaoh: Another Gu Man adaptation and I also really liked this drama. Like with Boss & Me, I think the novel was better but that overall the drama did a good job adapting it. In this case, Wallace Chung as He Yi Chen is spot on. The flashbacks and actors playing them added a lot to this drama. I think I learned to like Mo Sheng thanks to Wu Qian, which did a fantastic job playing young Mo Sheng. Her chemistry with Luo Yun Xi was really good.\n\nChocolateCosmos: Wallace was absolutely great! Thanks to this drama I‚Äôve discovered Wu Qian and Luo Yun Xi. I can see why this type of story always tops the online contemporary novels for readers and why this drama spun a movie adaptation (which was less great to me‚Ä¶but I love the movie‚Äôs songs lol).\n\nTitle: (Â≠§Ëä≥‰∏çËá™Ëµè) Gu Fang Bu Zi Shang | English title: General and I | Also known as: A Lonesome Fragrance Waiting to be Appreciated| Genre: Romance , Historical | Episodes: 62 | Broadcast network: Hunan | Broadcast period: Jan 2, 2017 ‚Äì Feb 10, 2017\n\nDrama Link: General and I (Subbed by Dramafever)\n\nNovel Translation Link: Gu Fang Bu Zi Shang by Feng Nong\n\nChocolate Cosmos: The novel was alright, but I got frustrated with some of the secondary characters by the second half of the novel. As for the drama‚Ä¶. I dropped it few episodes in lol. It started off with changing the storyline and I wasn‚Äôt in the mood to pick it back up since a lot of people gave rather negative reviews of the drama.\n\nfireflymaoh: I am also kind of stuck on this drama and novel. I am like halfway through both and been there for a while.\n\nTitle: (ÁêÖÁêäÊ¶ú) Lang Ya Bang | English title: Nirvana in Fire | Genre: Period drama, politics, revenge | Episodes: 54 |Broadcast network: Dragon TV, Beijing TV | Broadcast period: 2015-Sep-19 to 2015-Oct-15\n\nDrama Link: Nirvana in Fire (Subbed by the wonderful Viki volunteers)\n\nNovel Translation Link: Lang Ya Bang by Hai Yan\n\nChocolateCosmos: Superb costumes and scenery cinematography for a drama tv series. Although some of the scenes have slightly off lightning, overall, a solid drama. One of Hu Ge‚Äôs best performances for me. The novel itself has quality writing and dwells less on secondary characters. The drama adaptation focuses more on some characters such as Princess Nihuang. Wu Lei was so cute üòÄ\n\nfireflymaoh: I never read this novel, but I loved the drama. It had amazing cinematography. Hu Ge was amazing as Mei ChangSu and in my opinion this is his best role by far. The drama feels a bit like The Count of Monte Cristo and it does it really well.\n\nTitle: (Â§™Â≠êÂ¶ÉÂçáËÅåËÆ∞) Tai Zi Fei Sheng Zhi Ji | English title: Go Princess Go | Genre: Comedy, Historical, Time- Travel | Episodes: 35 | Broadcast network: Letv | Broadcast period: 2015-Dec-13\n\nDrama Link: I recommend typing ‚ÄúGo Princess Go Episode 1 Eng Sub‚Äù into your search engine. I cannot vouch for any of the other sites. Unfortunately, Viki has taken down the subbed videos for Go Princess Go. If you cannot find a site to watch it, I recommend reading recaps by dramakiwi, dramapanda, and others to get the feel of the storyline.\n\nNovel Translation Link: The Promotion Record of A Crown Princess by Xian Cheng\n\nChocolate Cosmos: My guilty pleasure lol. The novel itself centers more on character growth and the female lead‚Äôs turmoil of a modern day male turning into a female was definitely expanded upon in comparison to the drama. However, the drama did play up more on the comedy and you can tell the low budget of the drama which kind of adds to the tackiness of the drama‚Äôs comedy being played out to the viewers. Even though the endings were not that great, I didn‚Äôt really feel that frustrated because at the end of the day, I know that the novel has a nicer ending (lol) and that the drama itself was really aiming to make people laugh. They succeeded with me.\n\nfireflymaoh: I didn‚Äôt even know this had a novel, but I enjoyed the drama. It was silly fun and ridiculous at times. It never took itself seriously and that was what made it fun for me. It was very campy. However, I did not like the ending and I will just choose to ignore the last 15 minutes or so.\n\nWhich one of these are your favorite? What are your opinions of these dramas adapted from novels?"
