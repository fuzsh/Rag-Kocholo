        "text": "As the idea of creative city becoming a universal panacea for economic stagnancy and urban boosterism, the heavy dependency on creative fixes has widely spread to cities around the globe through urban networks and neoliberal urban policies. Since the late 1990s, Shanghai has expeditiously embraced the idea of making creative city and enthusiastically promoted the development of creative and cultural industries (CCIs). This research proposes the idea of 'the creative spatio-temporal fix' to interpret Shanghai's CCIs development over the last decade: under an overarching framework of creative entrepreneurial governance, the creative reconfiguration of the built environment (spatial fix) and temporal deferral of crisis and long term speculation on land (re)de-velopment (temporal fix) are in place to cope with the crisis of capital accumulation. Two rounds of creative spatio-temporal fix are discerned and epitomised in the case of Red Town, an iconic CCIs zone in Shanghai. Drawing on policy analysis and in-depth fieldworks, this study scrutinises into the creativity of the spatio-temporal fix and the spatiality and temporality of the creative fix in Shanghai. The findings are threefold. First, CCIs development is underwritten by a multi-scalar entrepreneurial network and its alliance with SOEs landlords and private developers. Second, the creativity of the spatio-temporal fix can be seen in the creative institutional design enabling CCIs development and forming an alliance with the SOE landlords, as well as the strategic speculation on the theme of creative city. Third, the spatiality and temporality of the creative fix are manifested in the temporal deferral of the crisis of deindustrialisation and limited spatial reconfiguration at the first stage, and a radical spatial restructuring with a temporal fix introducing financial capital at the second stage.\n\nRetaining the global mobile creative class has been considered a crucial strategy for driving creative economic development in inner cities. However, implementing the global creative city strategy overemphasizes the significance of amenity-based creative economic landscapes over institutional collaborations in contributing to the situated governance dynamics of creative clusters. Drawing on insights from an evolutionary perspective, this paper scrutinizes the extent to which creative city strategies foster the situated development of creative clusters based on a case study of Taipei. The paper argues that developing the urban creative economy requires a context-specific understanding of the urbanization process, and should involve an institutional collaboration to articulate the socio-spatial co-evolution between the diversified dynamics of creative clusters and urban form. This paper advocates reflexive thinking on neoliberal city strategies to develop a conjunctive, diverse and substantial creative policy to support alternative paths of creative city development.\n\nSince 1980, Shenzhen has grown in a record-breaking pace to the megacity it is today. Initially, Shenzhen&#39;s growth was based on low-cost mass industrial production. In recent years, however, the Shenzhen city government is trying to modernize and diversify its economy. Shenzhen has embraced the creative and cultural industries as one of the most promising sectors for its economic future. While many publications have appeared about Shenzhen&#39;s spectacular transformation from a fishing village to a megacity, much less is written about Shenzhen&#39;s ambitions in the creative economy and the implications this may have for its urban planning policies and strategies. This paper makes an inventory of Shenzhen&#39;s creative city initiatives, policies and strategies, explores which concrete evidence of a flourishing creative economy we can already witness in the city, and asks the question whether Shenzhen is not only an attractive location for creative companies, but also for creat...\n\nSupported by research and policy reform, Chinaâ€™s creative and cultural industries have seen explosive growth in recent years and this rapid expansion is anticipated to have an unprecedented and far-reaching influence on the future of the country and its economy. Researchers from Cultural Develop-ment Institute based at The Communication Univer-sity of China (CUC) and The College of Fine Arts (COFA) at the University of New South Wales (UNSW) present data and phenomenon analysis on Beijing as a case study focusing on the proliferation of art parks and creative clusters in the city."
