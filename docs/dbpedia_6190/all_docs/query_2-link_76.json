        "text": "Detective Chinatown 3 is only the latest Chinese blockbuster to show that China’s theatrical industry doesn’t really need Hollywood imports.\n\nDetective Chinatown 3 has broken the pre-sales record set by Avengers: Endgame ($110 million for an eventual $350 million Wed-Sun debut) with over $140 million in weekend pre-sales, including $100 million for the opening day. It could threaten the single-day and opening weekend record (for any movie anywhere) set by Avengers: Endgame’s $156 million domestic opening day and $356 million domestic Fri-Sun frame. Three years ago, while Hollywood was thrilling to the $242 million domestic launch of Black Panther, Monster Hunt 2 snagged a $97 million opening day in China on the way to a frontloaded $187 million weekend and a $356 million cume. 1.9 x $330 million is still $627 million.\n\nThat’s below the $387 million cume of Monster Hunt in summer 2015. Monster Hunt 2 isn’t nearly as good as Monster Hunt and I can see why, alongside other New Years biggies like Operation Red Sea ($579 million from a $72 million debut) and Detective Chinatown 2 ($544 million from a $156 million debut), it flamed out. Even if it drops as fast as Monster Hunt 2, a 1.9x multiplier from a $330 million debut would still be $628 million. But I saw Detective Chinatown 3, which was shot with IMAX cameras, last night at the IMAX offices. It’s really quite fun, especially for those who have seen and enjoyed the previous two action-comedy mystery capers.\n\nDetective Chinatown is focused on a mystery-solving genius (Liu Haoran) who ends up on the run with his uncle (Wang Baoqiang) who sells himself as the top detective in Bangkok but is merely an underworld swindler with connections to the local law enforcement. Yes there’s a murder to be solved and yes, it gives both the prodigy and the scoundrel a chance to prove their worth. It’s an enjoyable romp, and it’s streaming for free on Amazon Prime. But Detective Chinatown 2, set in a satirical version of New York, is where the series hit its peak. It’s only available (in America) via the Viki subscription service, but it’s worth the $4.99.\n\nThe second film brought the action to America, in a skewed inversion on Hollywood blockbusters finding an excuse to go to China. It features a host of eccentric detectives all racing against each other to solve the murder of a mobster’s son (and inadvertently teaming up with a seemingly innocent suspect) to claim a $5 million reward. Again directed by Chen Sicheng, the film is a more polished and more enjoyable flick with Qin Feng and “Uncle” Tang Ren getting to bounce off more comparatively eccentric characters. Detective Chinatown 2 was one of the first Chinese “breakout sequels.” It earned 4.35x the original’s $125 million gross. Eat your heart out, John Wick.\n\nThe first thing you’ll notice about Sicheng’s shot-on-IMAX Detective Chinatown 3 is its earned confidence and increased size and scale. The film opens with a fantastic ten-minute prologue which sees our heroes arriving in Tokyo and having to escape what turns into a mass fight scene at an airport. The whole set piece has a kind of “Because we can, dammit!” nerve that runs through much of the first act. That includes the sheer size and scale of this Japan-set adventure and a hilarious comic turn by none other than Tony Jaa, openly spoofing his image as an imposing action movie bad-ass in a way not unlike Jason Statham’s work in Spy.\n\nWhile Detective Chinatown 3 has higher highs than its predecessor, it’s less consistent. The 136-minute picture feels like three mini-movies. The first act is a standard Detective Chinatown movie, complete with a locked-room murder mystery, a comic competition between multiple crime solvers and an inspired slamming doors/clam shell game set piece inside a morgue. Much of the second act digresses into what turns out to be franchise-building, but the “fetch quest” chase ends on a surprising note by going serious far earlier than anticipated. Both predecessors go dark at the epilogue, but this one leans into melodrama for much of the third act as it reasserts itself to solving the primary puzzle.\n\nThe third act also reintroduces at least a couple of characters from previous Detective Chinatown movies. Not only are we invested in the journey for Qin Feng and Tang Ren, but we’ve seen the creation of an ensemble crime-fighting cast of potential “marquee characters.” That’s the path paved by the Fast & Furious and latter Mission: Impossible movies. It’s been part of the appeal of the Daniel Craig 007 movies. I’m counting No Time to Die as the marketing clearly expects you to smile when Ben Whishaw’s Q and Naomi Harris’ Moneypenny reappear just as we were happy to see Luthor, Benji and Ilsa and not just Ethan in Mission: Impossible - Fallout.\n\nDetective Chinatown 3 cost around $117 million, so it could drop dead after this weekend and still be profitable. Still, I wouldn’t be shocked if it flirts with single-territory grosses on par with Wolf Warrior 2 ($854 million), Avengers: Endgame ($858 million) and Star Wars: The Force Awakens ($937 million). Of course, no one should weep if it only ends up closer to The Wandering Earth ($699 million), Ne Zha ($723 million) or even Avengers: Endgame ($620 million in China). I’ll have lots more to say about this one over the weekend and beyond, but rest assured that we can probably expect a Detective Chinatown 4 on January 20, 2023. Maybe Jaa can invite Scott Adkins and Michael Jai White to the party."
