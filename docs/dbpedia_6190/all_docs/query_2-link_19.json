They include acquisition and development executives, agents, attorneys, directors, distributors, festival directors, financiers, film commissioners, producers, writers, the world’s press and all those who provide services to the motion picture industry.\n\nAt AFM, participants can discover the entire global catalogue of available films and projects, attend 40+ best-in-class class conferences, summits, roundtables and sessions, and connect with the independent film community’s decision makers, all in one convenient location without the distraction of a film festival.\n\nAbout the Independent Film & Television Alliance®\n\nThe Independent Film & Television Alliance (IFTA®) is the global trade association of the independent motion picture and television programming industry. Headquartered in Los Angeles, IFTA represents and provides significant entertainment industry services to more than 140 Member companies in 24 countries, consisting of independent production and distribution companies, sales agents, and financial institutions engaged in production finance.

Titles range from big budget blockbusters that will be released by the major studios to lower budget art and genre films recognized at international film festivals.\n\nAbout the Independent Film & Television Alliance®\n\nThe Independent Film & Television Alliance (IFTA®) is the global trade association of the independent motion picture and television programming industry.
