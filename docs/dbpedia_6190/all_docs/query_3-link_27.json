        "text": "CAPITOL OBSERVATIONS\n\nKatie Britt Becomes Alabama’s First Female Elected To U.S. Senate\n\nThe self-declared “Mama on a mission” – Republican Katie Britt – defeated Democratic challenger Will Boyd and Libertarian John Sophocleus on Nov. 8. She takes over long-time Senator Richard Shelby’s seat, becoming Alabama’s first female elected to the U.S. Senate. Two other females, both Democrats, served as U.S. Senators for the state after being appointed to this office.\n\nKatie defeated her Republican challenger, six-term Representative Mo Brooks, in the Republican Primary runoff earlier this year. Her campaign was a model of perfection.\n\nIn her inspiring acceptance speech before a huge crowd of supporters on Nov.8, Katie said:\n\nNo one will work harder than me in the United States Senate. I am going to listen to you, not lecture you. I know that every one of you is not going to agree with me on every single issue and that’s OK. I am going to be a voice for parents and families and hard-working Alabamians across this state, and I’m going to work tirelessly every single day to make Alabama proud.\n\nSen. Shelby retired after 35 years in the Senate and early on endorsed Katie, his former employee, for the seat. Katie recognized Sen. Shelby as “Alabama’s greatest statesman” and thanked him for giving her an opportunity 20 years ago. I totally agree with her on Sen. Shelby. Nobody will fill his shoes, and Katie will be the first to admit it.\n\nKatie, 40, stepped down as President and Chief Executive Officer of the Business Council of Alabama (BCA) to focus on the campaign. She took the position in 2018 when the organization was struggling to retain members. Susan Carothers, a spokeswoman for BCA, explained that in 2019 the BCA expected a $635,000 deficit, but under Katie’s leadership, the group “ended with a surplus of $447,000.”\n\nThe Enterprise, Alabama, native gained experience in politics when she worked as an intern in Sen. Shelby’s office while in college. She eventually became Deputy Press Secretary and later Press Secretary, serving as head of the department when she was only 23. Katie would later serve as Sen. Shelby’s Deputy Campaign Manager and Communications Director before rejoining his team as Chief of Staff in 2016.\n\nKatie reiterated her campaign promise to keep “Alabama First.” To do so, she said she is a “Mama on a mission” to get things done in Washington. I predict that Katie will be an outstanding Senator and will quickly make her own mark in the Senate. Alabama is blessed to have her representing all Alabamians.\n\nSources: Associated Press\n\nTHE CAMP LEJEUNE LITIGATION\n\nAn Update On The Camp Lejeune Litigation\n\nAfter the Camp Lejeune Justice Act was signed into law, several legacy cases were quickly filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina. These legacy cases involve individuals who previously filed for relief from Camp Lejeune-related injuries under the Federal Torts Claims Act and were subsequently denied. It is critical to note that these cases were all denied under the Federal Torts Claims Act and before the Camp Lejeune Justice Act was passed.\n\nBecause of these factors, the government moved to dismiss these legacy cases because there is a lack of subject matter jurisdiction since these cases have not filed an administrative claim under the exclusive Camp Lejeune Justice Act process. The government claims that these individuals have not exhausted the administrative claims process proscribed by the Camp Lejeune Justice Act but have complied with the administrative process for the Federal Torts Claims Act, which the government claims are unrelated to this current litigation.\n\nIn response, the plaintiffs claim that the plain language of the Camp Lejeune statute simply requires that an administrative claim be denied. In support, plaintiffs assert that their claims have been denied, and any additional administrative claim should be seen as a re-exhaustion of the administrative claims process and, therefore, redundant and outside the statute’s text. This issue has been fully briefed as of Nov. 17, 2022, but an order is still pending. Despite the contentious view between the parties, the government and the plaintiffs who filed these legacy cases have filed a joint motion to consolidate these cases, but the courts denied the motions pending resolution of the administrative claims issue.\n\nCamp Lejeune: A Practice Tip On The Administrative Claim Process\n\nThere are currently three options to file an administrative claim with the Judge Advocate General’s office (JAG) for claims made under the Camp Lejeune Justice Act. The first option is for a claimant, or a law firm on behalf of a claimant, to file a claim form individually.\n\nhttps://www.jag.navy.mil/organization/documents/CLJA_Claims_Form.pdf.\n\nhttps://www.jag.navy.mil/organization/documents/CLJA_Directions_Procedures.pdf.\n\nThe second option is to save the form on a CD-Rom and mail it to the JAG’s office. Law firms should submit claim forms for multiple clients via this CD-Rom process or the CSV process that is outlined below.\n\nhttps://www.jag.navy.mil/organization/documents/CLJA_Directions_Procedures.pdf.\n\nThe third option is to submit a batch claim submission via CSV. Law firms must register for batch filing.\n\n[email protected] with the subject line “Batch Filing Request” for additional instructions.\n\nThe administrative claims process outlined above is not final. There have been discussions by JAG that an online portal process is being developed, but it is not available at this time.\n\nBeasley Allen has an entire team of lawyers and staff dedicated to investigating, filing, and establishing causation for Camp Lejeune claims. The team is led by Julia Merritt and Leslie LaMacchia, lawyers in the Toxic Torts Section. Rhon Jones heads up the Section and works with the team. The timetable for filing claims for the exposure to toxic water at Camp Lejeune is limited to two years from the date the Act was put into law on Aug. 10, 2022.\n\nBeasley Allen Camp Lejeune Litigation Team\n\nIf you need help on a potential claim or more information on our Camp Lejeune litigation, contact one of the lawyers on the litigation team at 800-898-2034 or by email.\n\nThe Camp Lejeune Litigation Team consists of Julia Merritt and Leslie LaMacchia, who co-lead the team. Other members are Matt Pettit, Trisha Green, Will Sutton, and Elizabeth Weyerman. Rhon Jones (Section Head) works closely with the team. Additional lawyers will be added to the team as needed.\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA LITIGATION\n\nBeasley Allen Attacks Meta on Two Fronts of Litigation\n\nBeasley Allen lawyers have filed two separate types of litigation against Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram, and several other electronic information service companies. We are reporting on both sets of the Meta litigation below, but a brief explanation of each seems in order so as not to confuse the class action case with the personal injury cases.\n\nLawyers in our Consumer Fraud & Commercial Litigation Section have filed a consumer class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against Meta. The case alleges that Meta’s internet tracking code, called a pixel, is embedded into hospital websites and patient portals, illegally gathering personal health information that Meta uses to sell its targeted advertising.\n\nThrough the pixel, Meta has access to certain private information, such as some communications with physicians and possibly diagnoses. This information may allow Meta to profit from sales of targeted advertising to various businesses, including pharmaceutical manufacturers and other medical professionals. The primary lawyers on this consumer fraud class action are Rebecca Gilliland, Rachel Minder, Ali Hawthorne and Dee Miles, the Section Head.\n\nOur Mass Torts Section is involved in the In re: Social Media Adolescent Addiction/Personal Injury Products Liability Litigation. This litigation is not a class action, but many individual lawsuits are centralized into a single court for purposes of the litigation, known as a multidistrict litigation (MDL). Plaintiffs in this litigation allege that the social media defendants, which include not only Meta (Facebook, Instagram, etc.), but also TikTok, Snap, and YouTube, encouraged addictive and harmful use of social media as a result of algorithms deliberately designed to capture addictive behavior of its users. Social media addiction results in various emotional and physical harms, including depression, anorexia, mental trauma and even suicide, according to plaintiffs. This litigation is handled by lawyers in our Mass Torts Section led by Joseph VanZandt.\n\nDetails of each of these important cases being handled by our firm are presented below for our readers.\n\nLitigation Against Meta And Facebook For Violating Patient Privacy with Data Tracking Tool\n\nSeveral class action lawsuits have recently been filed against Meta, Facebook’s parent company, alleging illegal harvesting of sensitive health data. Specifically, the lawsuits involve the “Meta Pixel”—a tracking tool that can be embedded in the code of websites to provide analytics for use in selling Facebook and Instagram ads to third parties. This tool has been installed on the websites of several medical centers and doctors’ offices nationwide, including 33 of the top 100 hospitals in the U.S.\n\nMeta Pixel is coded onto these third-party websites to track users’ actions as they navigate the website. Not only is it on the public website, but in some cases, it is embedded inside the patient portal. The harvested information, which can include patient health conditions, doctor’s appointments, and medication allergies, is then sent to Meta, where it can be stored for years. Meta relies on this tool to earn advertising revenue, which makes up about 97% of its total revenue.\n\nBy adding this tracking tool to the websites of medical care providers, when a user enters sensitive health and personal information on the page, the Meta Pixel sends some of that data to Meta, where it is used to advertise targeted products to consumers. Users’ sensitive health information is thus being harvested through the Meta Pixel without users’ knowledge or consent anytime they enter information on these websites.\n\nAs a result of this illegal data harvesting, individuals are receiving targeted advertisements specifically related to the medical information they believe is secure on their medical care providers’ websites. However, “under the medical privacy law HIPAA, healthcare organizations need patient consent to share personally identifiable health information with outside groups,” according to The Verge. While Meta claims it requires groups using the Meta Pixel tool “to have the right to share data before sending that data to Facebook, the lawsuits allege that Meta is knowingly not enforcing those policies,” The Verge explained.\n\nFurther, despite Meta’s assertion that the Meta Pixel filters out sensitive health data, the lawsuits claim Meta knowingly permitted the use of “the Pixel on healthcare organizations’ websites despite knowing it would collect personal health information,” The Verge reported.\n\nBeasley Allen lawyers are vigorously pursuing these claims against Meta for such egregious infringement on sensitive personal information. If you believe you may have a similar claim or would like more information, contact a lawyer in our firm’s Consumer Fraud & Commercial Litigation Section. Dee Miles heads up the Section. Ali Hawthorne, Rebecca Gilliland, and Rachel Minder, lawyers in the Section, make up the team that handles these cases. Dee also works with the team.\n\nSource: The Verge\n\nSocial Media Litigation Update – Beasley Allen Appointed to Plaintiff Steering Committee\n\nOn Aug. 1, 2022, the Beasley Allen Social Media Litigation Team, led by Joseph VanZandt, filed a motion before the U.S. Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (JPML) to consolidate a multitude of lawsuits against Facebook, Instagram, and other related subsidiaries (collectively Meta) to redress product liability harms suffered by adolescents.\n\nThe suits claim that Meta designed platform algorithms to take advantage of human psychology —especially that of minors whose developing brains make them more impulsive and more likely than adults to be harmed by using social media.\n\nThe lawsuits further allege that Meta failed to warn underage users and their parents about the risks of addiction and a number of other injuries, including suicidal ideation, self-harm, eating disorders, anxiety and depression. Meta does not take reasonable precautions to keep children under 13 off its platforms, as the platforms have long been regarded as lacking effective age-verification protocols.\n\nAfter Beasley Allen filed its consolidation motion, dozens of additional cases were designated (or tagged) before the JPML as related actions. Many of these cases included as defendants TikTok Inc., Snap Inc., and YouTube, LLC, which also operate social media products that caused similar injuries to adolescents. On Oct. 6, the JPML issued a transfer order, instructing all social media cases involving defendants Facebook, Instagram, Snap Inc., TikTok Inc., and YouTube, LLC be transferred to a multidistrict litigation (MDL) in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, Oakland Division, before Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers. So far, at least 84 suits have been filed against social media companies over addiction claims, most of which have now been consolidated in the MDL.\n\nU.S. District Judge Gonzalez Rogers recently appointed a team of 22 lawyers from around the country to lead this litigation on behalf of all plaintiffs. Beasley Allen’s Joseph VanZandt was appointed by Judge Gonzalez Rogers to serve on the Plaintiff Steering Committee Leadership Counsel. Joseph and Beasley Allen’s Social Media Litigation Team will work with this national group of lawyers to seek justice for the plaintiffs in this litigation.\n\nSource: Law360.com\n\nA New Frontier For Product Liability Law\n\nParents of teenagers who became addicted to social media platforms, such as Facebook and TikTok, and subsequently suffered mental health problems are testing a novel claim in their lawsuit against the tech giants who own the platforms. They’re claiming that the intangible algorithms the companies used to trap teens in their social media webs can be treated like products, making the platforms liable for the damages they caused youth.\n\nPreviously, any product liability and personal injury claims targeting social media companies have focused on the content as the cause of injury to viewers. Those cases have not held up because of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which grants tech giants immunity from harm caused by third-party content posted to their sites.\n\nThis new strategy targets the technology instead — the algorithms that track users’ habits and then choose which content comes up on each user’s feed.\n\nIn October, lawsuits targeting Meta and other tech companies were consolidated into a multidistrict litigation. The question arose whether the algorithms were products for which their owners would face liability laws or are these laws a modern form of free speech protected by the First Amendment. If the former, then, in a world where many everyday products have algorithms that interact with users, just where is the line drawn?\n\nBeasley Allen is handling lawsuits for teenagers who became addicted to social media and suffered serious mental health consequences, including anxiety, depression, eating disorders, body dysmorphia, ADD/ADHD, self-harm, and suicidal ideation.\n\nSource: Law360.com\n\nThe Social Media Personal Injury Litigation Team\n\nIf you need help on a case or more information on the personal injury part of our Meta litigation, contact a lawyer on the firm’s Meta Litigation Team at 800-898-2034 or by email. Members of the team are:\n\nJoseph VanZandt, who heads the team, Jennifer Emmel, Suzanne Clark, Clinton Richardson, Sydney Everett, Davis Vaughn and Seth Harding. Andy Birchfield, who heads our Mass Torts Section, also works with the team.\n\nIt should be noted again that the class action aspect of the Meta Litigation is handled by lawyers in our Consumer Fraud & Commercial Litigation Section.\n\nDefect Class Wants Treble Damages From GM After $100 Million Win\n\nBeasley Allen’s Clay Barnett and lawyers from two other firms, represents the vehicle owners who have asked a California federal judge to award treble punitive damages following a $100 million verdict. In the class action against General Motors LLC, the vehicle owners argue that the vehicles have an oil-guzzling engine defect. The class members say awarding treble damages is “necessary to deter this kind of behavior from GM and other companies in the future,” Law360 reported.\n\nIn a motion filed on Nov. 15, the class, led by named plaintiff Raul Siqueiros, told the court that the $2,700-per-vehicle payout essentially puts the class back where they would have been if GM had fixed the defect years ago but doesn’t do enough to punish the company’s violations of the Idaho Consumer Protection Act or ICPA. The class wrote:\n\nA potential bad actor looking at this case will understand that if compensatory damages is all that they will have to pay for their ICPA violations, however egregious, then there is little economic downside in violating the act so long as there is any reasonable chance that they can avoid detection or liability.\n\nThe ICPA allows the court discretion to award punitive damages in cases of “repeated or flagrant” violations. The class argued that the class action nature of the suit in itself satisfies the “repeated” requirement.\n\nThe class further stated that the company’s conduct was flagrant and offensive because GM knew about the defect, the cost of the vehicles and how much people rely on them. The automaker sold thousands of people a product that it knew was inferior to what it advertised.\n\nOnly by making this conduct “uneconomical” can further violations be deterred, the class wrote, saying while the ICPA does not specify treble damage, it is up to the court’s discretion, other state consumer protection laws do recommend treble damages, and it is a good “rule of thumb” for deterrence. Dee Miles of Beasley Allen, representing the class, told Law360 on Nov. 16:\n\nWe believe that because of GM’s knowledge of this defect for years while they continued to sell these cars to consumers, punitive damages are more than warranted in this class case.\n\nThe trial started on Sept. 19 with class counsel claiming that GM knowingly hid a defect in an engine introduced in 2007 that results in excessive oil consumption, while the company’s counsel countered that GM disclosed that a problem was discovered and offered a solution to it.\n\nThe case involves certain SUVs and trucks made and sold by GM from 2011 to 2014 that had a particular engine — called the Generation IV Vortec 5300 LC9. The vehicles in question are Chevrolet’s Avalanche, Silverado, Suburban and Tahoe, as well as GMC’s Sierra, Yukon and Yukon XL.\n\nDuring the two-week trial, a GM engineer testified that a cleaning process the automaker chose over a costlier solution didn’t prove effective, while an economics expert for the plaintiffs estimated that owners were owed $2,700 in damages per vehicle.\n\nJurors also heard from the class representatives, one of whom testified that he stopped driving his truck long distances due to its excessive oil consumption, saying, “If I wanted an in-town commuter car, I would have kept my Prius.”\n\nIn early October, the jury returned a verdict in favor of the class, finding that GM had violated state consumer protection laws and awarding just over $100 million to the class.\n\nThe plaintiffs and proposed classes are represented by Dee Miles​, Clay Barnett, Mitch Williams, Rebecca Gilliland and Dylan Martin of Beasley Allen, Christopher S. Stombaugh, John E. Tangren, Adam J. Levitt, Daniel R. Ferri, Mark Abramowitz and Joseph Frate of DiCello Levitt LLC, Jennie Anderson of Andrus Anderson LLP and Anthony Garcia of AG Law PA.\n\nThe case is Raul Siqueiros et al. v. General Motors LLC, case number 3:16-cv-07244, in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California.\n\nSource: Law360.com\n\nCriminal Probe And Shutdowns Shake Self-Driving Vehicle Technology\n\nSeveral years of flawed presumptions and inflated promotional claims about the safety of autonomous driving technology appeared to implode in recent weeks upon the news that Tesla and its executives have been under a criminal investigation.\n\nMore than a dozen crashes involving Tesla vehicles, some resulting in death, triggered the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) probe. What attracted the attention of federal investigators to these crashes? Reports that they allegedly occurred while Tesla’s much-touted Autopilot was engaged. For years, Elon Musk has repeatedly touted the system that is supposed to assist drivers and help them avoid crashes.\n\nU.S. and California authorities have already been investigating whether Tesla’s Autopilot gives drivers a false sense of security. The system, so often hailed as fully self-driving, has the potential to be an effective safety backup for the human driver. Yet drivers who become too comfortable with Autopilot’s capabilities may leave the driving up to the vehicle, often with deadly consequences. One of the ongoing investigations, which NHTSA launched in August 2021, is looking into a series of 16 crashes involving Teslas crashing into roadside emergency and maintenance vehicles.\n\nHas Tesla lured drivers into making these fatal mistakes? That is one of the questions driving the criminal probe. Musk has described Autopilot as “probably better” than human drivers. Ahead of last month’s rollout of Tesla’s “Full Self-Driving (FSD) v11 update,” Musk said that the software would allow customers to drive “to your work, your friend’s house, to the grocery store without you touching the wheel.”\n\nTesla’s website also conveys that customers can safely let their vehicles drive themselves. Images on the website of the vehicles’ interior show movies displayed on the dashboard next to the navigation panel. One of the videos explains:\n\nThe person in the driver’s seat is only there for legal reasons. He is not doing anything. The car is driving itself.\n\nNo doubt, such claims entice customers and give them the confidence to disengage from driving, but evidence suggests that statements like this are deceptive and misleading. While there are several Autopilot crashes backing this theory, Tesla issues contradictory warnings telling drivers to keep their hands on the wheel and maintain control of the vehicle and disclaimers that the vehicles actually aren’t fully autonomous.\n\nNews of Tesla’s criminal investigation wasn’t the only setback for self-driving tech. The probe was announced on the same day that Argo AI, a multi-billion joint venture between Ford and Volkswagen, was shutting down. The company said some of its employees and resources would be reabsorbed by the two carmakers, which planned to develop advanced driver assistance systems, not self-driving vehicle technology.\n\nArgo disbandment deals a heavy blow to the push for fully self-driving vehicles, but it wasn’t the first. Zoox, which in 2018 became the first company allowed to operate self-driving transport services to the public in California, became a unit of Amazon in 2020. Shortly after, Uber gave up its self-driving unit, which became part of Aurora.\n\nBeasley Allen lawyers will continue to monitor developments in this area of concern.

He was driving his 2013 Elantra when another vehicle struck him from behind. The force of the collision caused Mr. Vanderventer to sustain a fractured vertebra, rendering him paraplegic. Three others in the Elantra, including Mr. Vanderventer’s wife, suffered only minor injuries.\n\nMr. Vanderventer sued Hyundai and the driver who rear-ended his car. His court arguments included the testimony of a biomechanics engineer and a neurosurgeon, who demonstrated how the vehicle’s seat allegedly malfunctioned to cause Mr. Vanderventer’s injury.\n\nThe jury sided with Mr. Vanderventer ad awarded him $32.8 million, finding Hyundai 84% responsible for his injuries and the other driver 16% at fault. Hyundai appealed the verdict, challenging the expert witnesses’ methodology, expertise, and validity and asserting that the court should have excluded their testimony.\n\nThe Wisconsin Court of Appeals rejected Hyundai’s arguments, finding the expert testimony credible and appropriate and that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing it. The judges also found that the court acted with discretion when it allowed evidence of prior Hyundai recalls involving different cars, as it demonstrated that vehicles may comply with federal transportation safety standards and still be defective.\n\nHyundai said it will ask the Wisconsin Supreme Court to review the appellate court’s decision.\n\nVanderventer is represented by Susan R. Tyndall, Timothy S. Trecek and Jesse Blocher of Habush Habush & Rottier SC. The case is Vanderventer et al. v. Hyundai Motor America et al., case number 2020AP1052, in the Court of Appeals for the State of Wisconsin, District II.\n\nSource: Law360.com\n\nContested Liability Personal Motor Vehicle Litigation\n\nBen Keen, a lawyer in our Atlanta office, recently settled a motor vehicle collision lawsuit for insurance policy limits. Our client, the plaintiff, was driving her child to school at the time of the accident. She was paying adequate attention to the roadway, driving within the speed limit, and had a green traffic signal providing her the right of way through an intersection. At that moment, as the plaintiff approached the intersection, the defendant driver attempted to make a left-hand turn, crossing the plaintiff’s lane of travel. The defendant collided with the plaintiff’s vehicle, causing her injuries.\n\nWe know that when a driver intends to turn left without a green left-hand traffic arrow, the driver is required by law to yield the right of way to oncoming traffic. This is true even if the plaintiff was speeding. However, in this case, she was not speeding.\n\nThe defendant’s insurance carrier contested liability, and a suit was filed. In the deposition of the defendant, it was evident there was no evidence to support the defenses in the case. While the defendant acknowledged that, his lawyers then attempted to direct fault upon construction workers who were positioned partially in the roadway where the defendant intended to drive. The defendant admits that he had a duty to scan the roadway for hazards and to keep a proper lookout ahead to ensure that the area of the roadway he intended to enter could be entered safely. He also acknowledged he had a duty to ensure that if he intended to turn across lanes of oncoming vehicles, he had to be sure that he made it across the roadway before attempting this maneuver.\n\nThe testimony from the defendant resolved the liability dispute, and a policy limit settlement resulted.

The lawsuit was settled just before the trial was to begin last month.\n\nThe victim was driving on a rural Alabama highway when she was struck and killed by a commercial motor vehicle. Her four adult children hired the Hayes firm and our firm to represent them in a lawsuit against the out-of-state motor carrier and the driver of the tractor-trailer, who was from Tennessee. Parker had this to say:\n\nWhen these wrecks happen, they are almost always fatal, and this accident was no exception. Obviously, you can never replace what was lost, but you can do your best to deliver justice to the clients, and that is exactly what we did here.\n\nWhile the settlement amount is public information and is available, the specific terms of the settlement, including the parties’ names, are confidential. The claims were vehemently contested, with the defendants disputing liability and blaming another driver for causing the wreck. In the end, justice prevailed. Jonathan Hayes of Goldstein Hayes, our co-counsel, observed:\n\nThis was such a tragic case. However, we were able to help our clients bring some amount of closure and hold the trucking company and driver accountable. I can think of only a few instances where a major truck wreck like this did not lead to a fatality, which is why it is so important that trucking companies follow the mandated safety rules and properly supervise their drivers.\n\nIf you need more information about big truck litigation or help with a case, contact Parker Miller.\n\nJudge Refuses To Dismiss A Georgia Wrongful Death Lawsuit Against Ford\n\nLast month, Georgia Federal Judge Clay D. Land rejected Ford Motor Co.’s motion to dismiss our clients’ case involving a defective tire that allegedly caused a rollover accident in a Ford Explorer Sport Trac vehicle. The accident killed the teenage driver and injured one of our clients.\n\nIn a Nov. 9 order, Judge Land said that plaintiffs Felicia Christian and Julia Alexandria Morris followed state law precisely when they voluntarily dropped their state court lawsuit and refiled it in federal court.\n\nMs. Morris was injured in the 2017 accident when a tire tread separation caused driver Jalin Lawson to lose control of the Explorer Sport Trac, which his grandfather owned. Jalin was killed in the rollover.\n\nMs. Christian filed the lawsuit against Ford, Goodyear Tire & Rubber, the automotive center that installed the tire, and Jalin’s grandfather in the Superior Court of Clay County, Georgia. All the defendants moved for summary judgment, but the trial judge granted it only to Goodyear in March.\n\nWe voluntarily dismissed the suit against the remaining defendants without prejudice the next day. Our clients refiled it in Federal Court within a week before any witnesses were called. Ford’s lawyers motioned to dismiss the federal lawsuit, pointing to an old real estate fraud case, Guillebeau v. Yeargin, that was decided in 1984. Ford contended that Georgia law does not allow an action to recommence after a codefendant has been granted summary judgment.\n\nHowever, Georgia law couldn’t be any clearer when recommencing a voluntarily dismissed lawsuit. According to the statute, “When any case has been commenced in either a state or federal court within the applicable statute of limitations, and the plaintiff discontinues or dismisses the same, it may be recommenced in a court of this state or a federal court either within the original applicable period of limitations or within six months after the discontinuance or dismissal, whichever is later, subject to the requirement of payment of costs in the original action.”\n\nJudge Land rejected Ford’s motion on several grounds, finding “the facts and holding of (Guillebeau v. Yeargin) are distinguishable from the present action. He said Ford’s rationale in seeking to have the case tossed was “wholly unpersuasive.”\n\nWe followed the Georgia statute to the letter in dismissing the case and refiling it in Federal court. Judge Land’s ruling is on a solid legal footing. We feel very comfortable that the ruling is the correct one and will be upheld if appealed. This is a very tragic case involving the death of a star athlete.

However, in some circumstances, your seat belt may have a defective component that, over time, fails and can have devastating consequences.\n\nA seat belt retractor is a component within the seat belt system that allows the seat belt webbing to extend out but also functions to pull the webbing back in. With respect to pulling the webbing back in, this occurs both when the seat belt is taken off and stowed and when you are wearing the seat belt, and it tightens up against you. Specifically, within the retractor is a spring that performs this function. Some manufacturers, however, intentionally make the spring force of the retractor weak for the comfort of the occupant wearing the seat belt. This can pose safety problems over time, causing the retractor spring to fail and, in some cases, within the first year of a vehicle being purchased.\n\nSo, what are the signs that your retractor spring may be failing?\n\nTypically, this condition is first noticed when your seat belt has issues retracting to stowage, which leaves it hanging loose after taking it off. This condition can also be recognized when the belt is worn. The retractor spring is supposed to tighten the belt against you; however, if you put the belt on and the seat belt remains loose and fails to tighten, there is likely an issue with your retractor spring. Failure of your seat belt to tighten against you when worn can have devastating consequences, as the seat belt will not protect you as intended in the event of a crash due to the fact you have too much belt webbing in your seat belt, allowing more movement in a crash than intended.\n\nBeasley Allen lawyers recently represented the family of a man who was fatally injured due to a defective retractor spring. He was wearing his seat belt, yet it had additional webbing in the system, which allowed him to be partially ejected out the driver’s side window in a low-speed, single-vehicle crash when the vehicle tipped onto the driver’s side. Sadly, the man’s head was crushed between the ground and the driver’s side roof rail.\n\nIf your seat belt is either failing to retract to stowage and hangs loose or remains loose when worn, it is crucial to take your car for service as you likely need to have the retractor of the seat belt system replaced. Failing to do so can have fatal consequences.\n\nIf you have questions or need help on a case, contact Mary Leah Miller, a lawyer in our Atlanta office who handles product liability lawsuits.\n\nThe Danger Of Reclining Seats\n\nThink about how many times in your life you have been a passenger in a car and decided to lay your seat back to take a nap. You wore your seatbelt, so you assumed it was safe. Unfortunately, many people are unaware that simply reclining their seat is putting their lives at risk.\n\nOnce a seatback is reclined, the standard seatbelt becomes much less effective, if not completely useless, because the shoulder harness of the belt moves away from the body. People do not realize or understand that the more space between the seatbelt and a person’s body, the greater risk of death or serious injury in an accident.\n\nThe seatbelt is designed to be worn snugly against the body to couple the body to the seat and safely ride down the forces of an accident. For this restraint plan to work effectively, the body must be securely seated in the chair at an upright angle so that the belt can secure the person’s body.\n\nThe general public’s lack of knowledge on this topic should not be blamed on ignorance. Automobile manufacturers actively lobby against regulation of seatback recline standards despite being very aware of the dangers of reclining seats for nearly six decades.\n\nAt a 1964 Stapp Car Crash Conference crash conference, two safety-equipment engineers presented a report analyzing the effect lap belts have on reclined-seat occupants. The report discussed sled testing in which the seatback was reclined almost fully. When the sled stopped suddenly, the test dummy submarined under the lap belt, or slid from beneath the belt, nearly 10 inches, driving the belt into the dummy’s abdominal cavity.\n\nIn 1988, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) conducted a safety study where one of the issues was the effect of reclining seatbacks. The NTSB examined 167 collisions involving passengers who had worn three-point restraints. The result showed that three-point restraints offered good protection only if worn properly. An occupant who wears a seatbelt while his seat is reclined is not “centered” in the belt, rendering the belt ineffective for spreading crash forces over the body.\n\nThe NTSB stated that the protection offered by any seatbelt is compromised when the seat is reclined, presenting a “potentially dangerous combination in a moving vehicle.” The NTSB noted, “since vehicles had been marketed with reclining seats, most adults and children were tempted to combine belt use with a reclined seat.” The study concluded that “at best, lap/shoulder belts, indeed, any type of seatbelt, offered reduced effectiveness when used with a reclined seat. At worst, a lap/shoulder belt in a reclined seat may be a potentially dangerous combination in a moving vehicle – proper fit is impossible.”\n\nDespite all of this knowledge, the Automotive Industry continues its efforts to prevent important safety warnings from reaching consumers.\n\nAlthough some vehicle owners’ manuals warn of the dangers of reclined seatbacks in moving vehicles, the warnings do not state specifically what degree of recline is dangerous. There are ways for the industry to address this dangerous problem. A simple warning pointing out the danger of reclining seats can be inexpensively incorporated into a vehicle design. Yet, it would convey the needed information to alert the passengers of the danger.\n\nA warning label can be the first step toward educating the public. But a warning would be unnecessary if the industry would start designing its restraint system in such a manner to alleviate the problem.\n\nFor example, GM has long incorporated into some of its vehicles, such as the Trailblazer, a seat design that mounts the seatbelt system within the seat itself. Known as “all belts to seat,” this design allows the shoulder harness to stay in position even when the occupant reclines the seat.\n\nAnother design incorporates an interlock within a vehicle’s gearshift, preventing the driver from putting the car in gear if a seatback is reclined. Interlocks are not yet used in any vehicles.\n\nAutomakers could also add a device that would warn the vehicle passengers of the hazards of reclined seats. In fact, years ago, a major manufacturer of seatbelts patented a device that would give a visual or audible warning if a passenger were to recline his seat to a dangerous degree. Emison, Kent J., “Reclining Seats Trade Safety for Comfort,” TRIAL, Vol. 39 No. 2 (Feb. 2003).\n\nA Jacksonville, Florida jury recognized this hidden danger and held Ford accountable when it awarded $16.9 million to a young college student who was rendered paraplegic in an accident. The student was a belted passenger who had reclined her seatback in a Ford Windstar. During the trip, the Windstar was involved in a low-impact collision. Because the seat was reclined, the passenger’s seatbelt did not hold her in place. As a result, this young college student was rendered paraplegic in a minor accident.\n\nAnother jury in Maryland awarded $59 million to a belted passenger in a Toyota vehicle who was also riding with his seat reclined. The car was involved in a frontal collision. During the crash, the belted passenger flew forward at the time of the impact. It resulted in the amputation of both of the passenger’s legs below the knee.\n\nEach of these cases spotlights this dangerous practice that automobile manufacturers have known about for decades.\n\nPeople are needlessly injured and killed due to the automobile industry’s inaction on this subject. The industry knows that vehicle motoring public does not understand or recognize the danger of reclining the seat while the vehicle is in motion. Yet, the industry blames the public for their own injuries, taking a “they should have known” approach.\n\nThe industry also knows that millions of families drive miles on the road every year. The industry also knows that the occupants in its vehicles will recline their seats to take naps, and by doing so, the occupants are all at great risk of serious injury or death in an accident.\n\nEven with this knowledge, the automobile manufacturers turn a blind eye to this danger knowing there are simple approaches they could take to educate the public and prevent such needless injuries and deaths each year.\n\nIf you need more information or help with a case, contact Personal Injury & Products Liability Section.

The agency said it is aware of other suspected Takata airbag explosions in vehicles made by other automakers.\n\nThe latest confirmed death occurred when the Ford Ranger was involved in a collision near Pensacola, Florida. The vehicle was already included in a “do not drive” warning that the NHTSA first issued in 2018 when regulators found Takata airbags in many older vehicles posed an immediate threat to safety.\n\nTakata airbags can deploy with excessive force, including during minor bumps and fender benders that don’t warrant airbag deployment. The force of the rupture blasts metal airbag fragments toward the vehicle’s occupants.\n\nEarlier last month, Stellantis STLA.MI, the parent company of Chrysler, urged owners of about 276,000 U.S. vehicles to stop driving them immediately. The warning came after the company became aware of three additional deaths linked to Takata airbags in seven months.\n\nTakata airbags have been tied to at least 23 deaths in the U.S. and more than 400 injuries, including critical injuries to the eyes and other parts of the head, neck, and face. Takata and automakers worldwide have recalled more than 100 million Takata airbags inflators, including more than 67 million in the U.S.\n\nBefore the most recent Takata crash death, Ford confirmed sending a hundred recall notices to the owner’s home. The company said it also sent multiple text messages and a canvasser visited the home to try and schedule the repair for this vehicle. Ford said:\n\nWe are urging all remaining affected owners not to drive these vehicles and to contact Ford to schedule a free repair.\n\nLaw360 reported that last year, NHTSA opened an investigation into 30 million additional vehicles built by nearly two dozen automakers with potentially defective Takata inflators. The agency’s Acting Administrator Ann Carlson said:\n\nWe need everyone to check right now for open Takata recalls – and if you have one, to schedule an appointment at your dealership immediately for a repair. Every day that passes when you don’t get a recalled airbag replaced puts you and your family at greater risk of injury or death. Don’t let an open recall cost you or your passengers your lives.\n\nSources: National Highway Transportation Safety Administration, Claims Journal, The Columbian and Auto News\n\nTire Pressure When The Weather Turns Cold\n\nThere are two things that people will generally notice in their vehicles when the weather turns colder: their batteries die, and the pressure in their tires decreases. Particularly in the southeastern U.S., the vacillating temperatures as fall progresses to winter can compromise tire safety.\n\nBeasley Allen has an office in metro Atlanta, and during October, this area has seen temperatures near freezing to nearly 80 degrees Fahrenheit within 24 hours. Such wide variations in temperature can have a drastic effect on tire pressure.\n\nIt is estimated that tire pressure drops about one pound per square inch for every 10 degrees Fahrenheit drop in temperature. A freeze warning at night but sunny and warm conditions the next day creates a perfect storm for people to get into their vehicles while entirely unaware of their tire pressure.\n\nDriving a vehicle in which the tires are grossly below the recommended PSI can be very dangerous. If tire pressure is significantly low, a greater amount of the tire’s surface will come into contact with the road, increasing friction. This can cause damage to the tire if the side wall is in contact with the road for an extended time.\n\nVehicle owners may want a tire specialist to check tires during drastic temperature changes. It is imperative to have tire pressure checked regularly by a tire professional. Owning and utilizing a tire pressure gauge can provide peace of mind that you are driving a vehicle with tires functioning as optimally as possible, regardless of the weather.\n\nIf you have questions about any aspect of tire safety or need help with a case, contact Ben Baker.\n\nSource: Consumer Reports\n\nWORKPLACE LITIGATION\n\nBeasley Allen Lawyers Investigate On-The-Job Death\n\nBeasley Allen lawyers Kendall Dunson and Wyatt Montgomery are investigating the death of a city employee who was killed while performing his duties as a waste collector on the job. The death occurred when the deceased employee was run over by a reversing sanitation truck. When catastrophic injuries or fatalities occur to employees on the job, the facts surrounding the injury or death must be thoroughly investigated to determine whether a potential third-party products liability case or co-employee case exists – especially when, as here, a piece of equipment or other machinery is involved in the incident.\n\nWorkers’ compensation laws provide medical care and death benefits to a deceased’s dependents; however, the compensation provided under the Workers’ Compensation Act falls drastically short of the amount often needed to compensate the worker or his family completely. Workers’ compensation laws typically do not account for damages such as mental anguish, pain and suffering, loss of consortium, loss of value of life, the full amount of lost wages, or punitive damages against those responsible. Inadequate compensation for the injured worker or their family makes investigating other avenues of recovery for the worker or their family imperative.\n\nIn the case of the sanitation worker, several potential avenues of recovery need to be investigated. For instance, commercial vehicles such as sanitation trucks should be equipped with back-up alarms to alert workers and others the vehicle is backing up to avoid injury. If the back-up alarm was inoperable or had been disconnected, the employee’s family has a potential co-employee claim for the removal of or failure to repair a safety device.\n\nSuppose the sanitation truck was not equipped with a backup alarm. There may be a potential products liability case against the designer and manufacturer of the sanitation truck.\n\nAny time a catastrophic injury or death occurs to a worker while on the job, and the incident involves a piece of equipment, potential third-party avenues of recovery must be thoroughly investigated.\n\nIf you know someone who has been catastrophically injured or killed while on the job or need help on a case, contact Kendall Dunson or Wyatt Montgomery. They would be glad to work with you.\n\nOn-The-Job Injury In A Tobacco Plant\n\nIn our firm’s Personal Injury & Products Liability Section, one type of case that our lawyers and support staff investigate quite often involves on-the-job injuries. Ben Locklar in our Montgomery office has one such case now.\n\nIn April 2019, our client was employed at a tobacco processing facility in Tennessee. On April 5, he was tasked with putting dust plates on four machines within the facility called hogshead breakers. These machines had been transferred from another facility and were being set up for use in the tobacco plant.\n\nFastening these dust plates required our client to crawl inside each machine. Our client and a co-employee had placed the plates on three of the four machines with bolts. Our client was required to stand inside the machine while his co-employee stood outside the machine. Our client had to stand near four large cylinders called doffers to install the plates. The doffers were equipped with sharp teeth, which were used to grind up bales of tobacco to process the product.\n\nWhen our client and his co-employee began installing the plates, they believed there was no electrical power to any of the machines. As our client climbed into the fourth machine, a person near the machine told him there might be power to that machine. Our client climbed out of the machine, notified his supervisor of what he had been told, and expressed concern about continuing to work in the machine.\n\nThe plant manager walked over to two individuals who were programming the fourth machine and requested that they halt the process until our client and his co-employee finished what they were doing. The two individuals worked with outside contractors and were engaged to complete the setup of the hogshead breakers.\n\nOur client was assured that it was safe for him to continue, and he climbed back into the machine to complete the installation of the final dust plate. Rather than stop the process, the programmer flipped a breaker inside the control panel but continued with the machine’s programming. As a result, the rotating cylinders were turned on, and our client was pulled into the machine. He suffered serious injuries to both legs, requiring partial amputation of his left leg and a portion of his right foot.\n\nIn the case of this tragic event, the two contractors who were engaged in programming the subject machine failed to follow recognized standards by blocking power to the machine so that no parts would move while our client and his co-employee finished their assigned task of installing dust plates. Knowing that people were working on and in the machine, the two outside contractors continued forward with their process, resulting in our client being seriously and permanently injured.\n\nEmployee safety must be a top concern in these types of workplace environments, which contain heavy industrial equipment. When individuals fail to follow instructions and block energy to machines, people can and do get hurt. In such cases, the responsible parties must be held accountable. Our Beasley Allen lawyers work diligently every day to secure justice for people like Ben’s client. He entrusted his wellbeing to his supervisor and fellow employees. His life was irrevocably changed as a result of their failures.\n\nIf you have questions or need help on a case, contact Ben Locklar, a lawyer in our Personal Injury & Products Liability Section.\n\nEvan Allen Shares On-The-Job Product Liability Knowledge With Fellow Lawyers\n\nEvan Allen, a lawyer in our Mobile office, handles on-the-job product liability cases. Those cases involve both personal injury and death. During a Lunch and Learn Event, Evan recently discussed some of these cases with the Mobile Bar Association’s Workers’ Compensation Section. Evan advised his fellow lawyers on identifying and tackling workplace injury cases.\n\nDefectively designed machinery causes accidents in the workplace, often resulting in permanent, lifelong disabling injuries. Many workers are injured because the machinery lacks or has poor safety guards. Workplace injuries include all sorts of bodily injuries and even result in deaths. Workplace injuries lead to medical expenses, the inability to perform normal activities, lost wages, compromised earning potential, severe pain, mental anguish, disfigurement, permanent physical impairment and lasting vocational impairment. Also, as stated above, some of the injuries result in the death of an employee.\n\nRecently, Evan helped Walter Robinson obtain a settlement for injuries he sustained while operating a machine during the ordinary course of his job duties at Thermalex, Inc. The Granco Clark Inc. manufactured machine dropped an aluminum log, crushing the worker’s foot. His foot required partial amputation.\n\nEvan also helped secure a $500,000 verdict for Gregory and Althea Bell after Mr. Bell stepped into the unguarded opening of a furnace at Union Foundry Co. The worker’s foot fell into hot melted iron and required partial amputation.\n\nIn addition, Evan led a team that obtained a $774,000 verdict for John Dees, who lost the use of his left arm and suffered disfigurement following a workplace accident. The worker in the case caught his hand in a Tenax SPA-manufactured machine.\n\nEvan shared with his fellow Mobile Bar Association lawyers that workplace accidents caused by defective machinery can be minimized or avoided. Machine manufacturers should follow The Order of Design Precedence – The Engineer’s Bible. It provides:\n\nFirst, manufacturers should design for minimum risk.\n\nSecond, they should incorporate safety devices.\n\nNext, they should provide warning devices.\n\nFinally, they should develop and institute operating procedures and training.\n\nIf you have any questions or need help on a case, contact Evan Allen, who is in our Personal Injury & Products Liability Section.\n\nAVIATION LITIGATION\n\nJudge: 346 Killed In Boeing 737 MAX Crashes Are Crime Victims\n\nA Texas federal judge ruled last month that the 346 people killed in two Boeing 737 MAX crashes are “crime victims” under federal law. In an Oct. 21 ruling, U.S. District Judge Reed O’Connor said that the crash victims’ families should have been told about closed-door meetings between Boeing and federal prosecutors that resulted in a January 2021 plea agreement. In addition to a $244 million penalty for defrauding the FAA, $1.77 billion in compensation to airlines, and establishing a $500 billion fund for crash victims, the agreement also sheltered Boeing from further criminal prosecution.\n\nAngered by the deal, some crash victims’ families argue that the government “lied and violated their rights through a secret process.” They are asking Judge O’Connor to revoke Boeing’s immunity and allow the company to face criminal charges for the crash. Beasley Allen lawyer Mike Andrews specializes in aviation litigation and represents some of the families of the Ethiopian Airlines crash victims. He observed:\n\nBoeing must be held fully accountable for the Ethiopian Airlines and Lion Air crashes, and that means ensuring the company owns the criminal wrongdoing that led to such a widescale loss of human life. These families have gone through the unimaginable, and it’s only fair that they have a voice in future proceedings against Boeing.\n\nThe full impact of Judge O’Connor’s ruling is yet to be seen, but it will determine what legal remedies the families will get. Addressing families angered by the secret settlement agreement, the U.S. Department of Justice said the relatives were not informed because they weren’t crime victims. However, Judge O’Connor said the 737 MAX crashes were a foreseeable result of Boeing’s misconduct, making family members the representatives of crime victims. Judge O’Connor wrote:\n\nIn sum, but for Boeing’s criminal conspiracy to defraud the FAA, 346 people would not have lost their lives in the crashes.\n\nMonths of federal investigations of the Bowing 737 MAX crashes found that Boeing had secretly installed its Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS) in the 737 MAX plans. The function of the MCAS was primarily to counter the new aircraft’s tendency to pitch upward automatically. Judge O’Connor said further:\n\nHad Boeing not committed its crime the Ethiopian Airlines and Lion Air pilots would have received training adequate to respond to the MCAS activation that occurred on both aircrafts.\n\nLawyers for the families contend that the DOJ’s secret deferred prosecution deal with Boeing violates the law and plans to take legal action. They hope to scrap the part of that deal that allowed Bowing to escape prosecution for lying to the FAA about the MCAS – lies that led to the deaths of 346 people.\n\nSources: Reuters and U.S. Department of Justice\n\nJudge Dismisses Suit From Pilots Harmed By Boeing’s 737 MAX Deception\n\nAn Illinois federal judge has granted Boeing’s motion to dismiss a proposed class-action lawsuit brought by pilots who claimed their careers were sidelined because Boeing lied to aviation regulators and airlines worldwide about the safety of its 737 MAX jets.\n\nU.S. District Judge Steven C. Seeger, a Donald Trump appointee, also denied a second bid by the pilots to have him recuse himself from the case over alleged conflicts of interest.\n\nThe pilots claimed that Boeing’s deceptive statements and actions after two deadly crashes involving its MAX 8 jets dealt a serious blow to their careers and income. MAX 8 jets were grounded worldwide following the Oct. 2018 crash of Lion Air Flight 610 in Indonesia and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 five months later in Ethiopia. The grounding had a ripple effect throughout the airline industry that pilots certified to fly the MAX 8 experienced.\n\nJudge Seger issued a blistering rebuttal of the pilots’ claims, calling them an example of how liability can be stretched beyond reasonable limits. He also painted the pilots in a way that belittled their complaints, comparing their suffering to that of the passengers aboard the doomed 737 MAX flights and their families. “Unlike the poor people on those planes, plaintiffs had everything, and they lost nothing,” the judge said.\n\nThe international group of pilots that filed the lawsuit accused Boeing of strict liability, negligence, fraudulent concealment, and fraudulent misrepresentation. While the judge was dismissive of their claims, the complaint nonetheless represents how hard and far-reaching fraud is felt when a corporation commits it as fundamental to the world economy as Boeing.\n\nThe pilots also said that Judge Seeger served as senior trial counsel with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission when he was confirmed to the federal bench in September 2019. At that time, the agency was investigating Boeing’s alleged misrepresentations of the safety of its 737 MAX aircraft. The judge rejected the recusal bid, calling it “way off base.”\n\nLawyers representing the pilots said that Judge Seeger’s multiple derogatory comments about the case show that he was incapable of ruling without prejudice and bias. The plaintiffs’ counsel said:\n\nHe is no expert at aeronautical engineering yet clearly presumes to be and overlooks the inherent design flaw in the Max, the reason it was selected and ramifications that had in human life and, albeit to a lesser extent, the effects it had on our clients’ lives and livelihoods too. This cannot be the view of a reasonable judge and is the style of dealing with plaintiffs that will underscore the impending appeal.\n\nIt will be interesting to see what happens further in this case.

The following story involving an email message received by one of our lawyers illustrates why the appeal involving J&J’s LTL Bankruptcy, pending before the Third Circuit Court of Appeals, really matters to thousands of women.\n\nOn Nov. 4, Matt Teague, one of the lawyers on the Talc Litigation Team handling the Talc litigation, received an internal email from a co-worker sharing that one of our talc ovarian cancer clients had passed away the day before in an emergency room.\n\nWe wish I could report that such types of phone calls and emails are rare, but lawyers on our Talc Litigation Team receive these types of phone calls and emails regularly. While our clients come to us from all different walks of life, each of them is journeying down the same treacherous road of ovarian cancer after years of continued use of J&J’s Baby Powder.\n\nIt is an unfortunate reality that many of our talc clients have died while waiting to exercise their constitutional right to confront J&J and its subsidiary, Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc. (JJCI), in a jury trial. Unlike these brave women who chose to stand up and seek justice while suffering from a dreadful disease, this powerful 130-year-old pharmaceutical giant has chosen to hide behind a bankruptcy stay that is currently preventing all trials against J&J involving talcum powder products. Preserving the constitutional right to trial by jury and allowing these women to tell their stories truly is what is at stake in this appeal to the Third Circuit.\n\nBut how is a bankruptcy stay even possible for a worldwide company worth an estimated half a trillion dollars that reported sales growth of 1.9% to $23.8 billion in the third quarter of 2022 alone? Currently, J&J victims are being blocked from litigating their cases, accusing the company of causing thousands of cases of ovarian cancer, mesothelioma and, in many instances, death based on a bankruptcy filing. But it’s not J&J’s own bankruptcy filing but that of LTL Management, a subsidiary company that J&J created for the sole, selfish purpose of shielding itself from all potential talc litigation liabilities.\n\nAbout 48 hours after its incorporation, LTL filed for bankruptcy. This legal maneuver, called the “Texas Two Step,” is now facing legal scrutiny before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. The stakes could not be higher for each and every brave woman who has taken a stand against corporate profit over consumer safety.\n\nOn Sept. 19, 2022, the Third Circuit heard oral arguments on whether it is proper for a solvent company, such as J&J, to attempt to limit its tort liability by moving its litigation expenses and liability into a new company and then promptly bankrupting that company. The appeals court also heard an argument on using LTL’s bankruptcy stay applied to non-bankrupt companies such as J&J and JJCI.\n\nJeffrey Lamken, representing the Official Committee of Talc Claimants, argued that LTL’s bankruptcy and the “Texas Two-Step” that preceded it had no valid, good faith purpose. Instead, Jeffrey argued that J&J’s filing of the LTL bankruptcy was for the sole purpose of gaining a litigation advantage. This strategy is considered per se bad faith under bankruptcy law. He correctly argued that this violated core principles of bankruptcy law because it placed only “one class of creditors [talc plaintiffs] at risk” and allowed J&J the benefits of bankruptcy without having to comply with the burdens and accountability of the bankruptcy court.\n\nA U.S. Department of Justice lawyer added, “LTL or Johnson & Johnson is trying to turn what should be that shield of bankruptcy into a sword by not complying with any of [its] obligations.”\n\nWhile our clients wait for the Third Circuit to rule on these legal matters, I am reminded of the J&J credo that states in its first line: “We believe our first responsibility is to the […] mothers and fathers and all others who use our products and services.” The credo closes by addressing its stockholders and noting that “mistakes [must be] paid for.” For decades, J&J has ignored its credo, selling J&J’s Baby Powder with talc despite clear knowledge that it can cause ovarian cancer and mesothelioma, both deadly cancers. Its actions have resulted in needless death and suffering. J&J should reverse course, follow its credo, take responsibility, and reasonably compensate the thousands of women and men and their families who are suffering or who have died from ovarian cancer or mesothelioma.\n\nHopefully, the Third Circuit will reverse the bankruptcy court’s decision, dismissing the bankruptcy and allowing trials to move forward, and ultimately, justice and fairness will prevail.\n\nSources: Johnson & Johnson and Law.com\n\nBeasley Allen Talc Litigation Team\n\nBeasley Allen lawyers Ted Meadows and Leigh O’Dell head the Beasley Allen Talc Litigation Team.

The settlement offer from the world’s biggest corporation and America’s third-largest pharmacy business falls in line with settlements involving CVS Pharmacy and Walgreens.\n\nThe settlement also covers any potential legal claims the government may bring in the future. Walmart, plaintiffs’ counsel, state attorneys general and the 238-page settlement agreement confirm the offer details. Local government lawyers said:\n\nWalmart has agreed to expedite its payment so that our nation’s communities can access the vast majority of these funds within one year of the agreement’s effective date.\n\nThe proposal allots $2.4 billion for addiction treatment and related services, $325 million in attorney fees and costs, and credits for previous opioid settlements. This includes $215 million for Florida.\n\nThe $3.1 billion offer amounts to less than two days of total revenue for Walmart worldwide. In 2022, the corporation reported a fiscal year income of over $570 billion.\n\nCVS and Walgreens indicated they would pay approximately $5 billion each to resolve opioid litigation.\n\nMultidistrict litigation in Ohio federal court encompasses most of the opioid suits against pharmacy chains. One of the MDL’s bellwether trials resulted in a $650 million verdict against Walmart, Walgreens and CVS in Ohio. The Sixth Circuit is reviewing the verdict.\n\nPlaintiffs have also sued drug manufacturers and wholesale distributors, the largest of which have agreed to settlements totaling $50 billion. Actual settlement payouts could be lower due to smaller drugmaker bankruptcies.\n\nEntities in addition to Walmart, Walgreens and CVS have announced proposed and final settlements, including wholesale distributors AmerisourceBergen Corp., Cardinal Health Inc. and McKesson Corp.; consulting firm McKinsey & Co. and drugmakers Johnson & Johnson, Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd. Allergan PLC, Purdue Pharma LP, Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc., Insys Therapeutics Inc. and Mallinckrodt PLC. The barrage of opioid cases has caused the latter four drugmakers to declare bankruptcy.\n\nThe focus moving forward is on pharmacies and drug companies that have avoided scrutiny.

Under Fed. In R. Civ. P. 9(b), plaintiffs involved in FCA cases must state “with particularity” the circumstances surrounding the fraud claims alleged in a complaint.\n\nAs we have previously reported, the federal circuit courts’ “split,” which was described in each of the three petitions, is based on the more stringent standard applied, which requires specific examples of fraudulent billing versus allowing cases to survive while providing less specific, but still reliable sources of the fraud. For instance, Judge Diane Wood wrote for the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals, in her majority opinion, that while 9(b) requires specificity, “it does not insist that a plaintiff literally prove his case in the complaint.”\n\nThis pleading standard issue has been weighed in on by the Solicitor General in 2010 and 2014 but remains fluid. Also, in 2014 the federal government agreed that there have been “inconsistent conclusions” about the Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b) issues in lower courts. At that time, the government suggested that the Supreme Court not step in to determine the 9(b) standard. So, the issue remains unsettled for now.\n\nBeasley Allen’s Whistleblower Litigation Team is monitoring issues related to the Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b) federal circuit split. Although the High Court has not decided to weigh in on the 9(b) standard at this time, it is still possible that the Court will address the issue in due time. We had hoped that the High Court would settle matters now, but that didn’t happen.\n\nIf you have a client who is alleging violations of the False Claims Act, we are ready to review these claims.

The lawsuit alleged that the clinic and its related businesses violated the Physician Self-Referral Law (Stark Act) and anti-kickback statute, which are designed to discourage medical professionals from placing profits over the patient’s best interest when deciding treatment.\n\nIn an amended complaint filed in 2018, Hockaday said the Athens Orthopedic Clinic’s corporate culture was characterized by “cheating and maximizing profits over compliance and professionalism,” billing coverups, and noncompliance with health care regulations.\n\nThe parties unsuccessfully petitioned the court to rule on some or all of the claims without going to trial first, but jury selection and trial started on Oct. 31. The parties reached an agreement to settle the case about halfway through the trial. The terms of the agreement are confidential.\n\nIt is uncommon for False Claims Act lawsuits to proceed to trial and rarer still for them to go to judgment without being settled first. Most defendants settle False Claims Act cases before trial because judgments can be harsh. Under the law, damages are automatically tripled, and every false claim or fraudulent bill to the government can result in a penalty of at least $11,000 each.\n\nThe case is U.S. ex rel. Hockaday and State of Georgia ex rel. Hockaday v. Athens Orthopedic Clinic PA et al., case number 3:15-cv-00122, in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Georgia.\n\nSource: Law360\n\nThe Beasley Allen Whistleblower Litigation Team\n\nBeasley Allen lawyers continue to be heavily involved in handling whistleblower cases.

Maginn Jr., who served as Jenzabar CEO until 2019. Jenzabar is an educational media company that creates products and services for higher education.\n\nThe court noted that some of the damage claims arose too late. However, it found that Maginn effectively barred other investors from participating in a subsequent “II-C” securities series after he attempted to tie releases of liability for himself to payments in 2013 that amounted to an involuntary cash-out of II-B rights.\n\nAccording to Law360, the investors accused Maginn “of discouraging exercise of the warrants in order to prevent dilution of his own shares in Jenzabar, as well as concealing details about the conflict and valuation of the warrants.” They also accused Maginn of hiding or destroying records related to the long-running dispute.\n\nVice Chancellor Will wrote:\n\nAfter trial, I find that Maginn breached his duty of loyalty when he usurped from New Media II-B the opportunity to obtain the new warrants. I award rescissory damages to remedy that harm.\n\nShe added that the “obscure and obfuscatory” transactions foiled other investors from accessing the new securities and that Maginn’s “furtive behavior” underscored the scheme.\n\nThe Vice-Chancellor also said that more proceedings would be needed to determine how aspects of the case will be handled, including how the payouts will be administered and locating the eligible investor beneficiaries besides the three that filed the complaint.\n\nAdditionally, considering the court’s previous ruling, it said the court had not found the three plaintiffs properly removed Maginn from the investor group. The court also explained that Deleware’s Limited Liability Company Act does not include provisions that support the investors’ request to have a receiver administer the process. Vice Chancellor Will determined that the court’s equitable powers extend to actions needed to “prevent further harm and carry out the court’s judgment.”\n\nIn addition, the court found the court had not found the three plaintiffs properly removed Maginn from the investor group. While Delaware’s Limited Liability Company Act lacks provisions supporting the investors’ request for the appointment of a receiver to oversee the process, Vice Chancellor Will wrote that the court’s equitable powers extend to actions needed to “prevent further harm and carry out the court’s judgment.”\n\nThe investors are represented by David H. Holloway, Colin R. Hagan and David J. Shlansky of Shlansky Law Group LLP.\n\nThe case is Deane et al. v.

JUUL appealed this decision, asking for their product to remain on the market while a final decision is made.\n\nJUUL recently published its administrative appeal of the marketing denial order (MDO), explaining FDA’s position on the ruling was substantively and procedurally flawed. JUUL believes that the deficiencies listed in the MDO were improperly evaluated.\n\nJUUL requests in the appeal that the FDA do a complete review of the science and evidence presented in its initial application to determine whether the product is appropriate for the protection of public health. This appeal, known as a 10.75 appeal, continues to be reviewed by the FDA.\n\nAdditionally, JUUL has recently expressed concerns about a potential bankruptcy due to the FDA ruling, regulations on flavors, legal challenges, and subsequent loss in sales. In November, JUUL reached a financing deal to stave off that bankruptcy. In doing so, the company intends to lay off 30% of its employees to reduce its operating budget.\n\nThe multidistrict litigation (MDL) against JUUL, JUUL’s founders and key company directors, Altria, Inc., is still underway. Currently, there are nearly 4,000 suits in the MDL, including personal injury suits and claims brought by school districts, government entities and tribes. The first personal injury bellwether trial is set to begin in January 2023. The first school district trial, previously set to start last month, has now been moved to April 2023.

(NARCO), according to a November U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Filing.\n\nAs part of the agreement, Honeywell will make a one-time lump sum payment of $1.325 billion to the NARCO Asbestos Personal Injury Settlement Trust. The trust was established on April 30, 2013, and began accepting claims on Oct. 15, 2013. In exchange, the company will be released from all further and future asbestos claims regarding exposure to asbestos-containing products manufactured, sold, or distributed by NARCO or its predecessors, Honeywell said in the filing.\n\nNARCO, which was founded nearly a century ago, filed for bankruptcy in 2002 after being hit by more than 250,000 asbestos lawsuits. The company emerged from bankruptcy in April 2013. The company manufactured refractory materials containing asbestos. The heat-resistant products were used to make furnaces, brake pads, and other products.\n\nHoneywell owned NARCO for several years in the 1980s. The company is responsible for funding the asbestos trust, including $140 million in annual payments to cover asbestos claims and expenses for the administration of the trust, totaling about $21 million in 2021.\n\nThe case is Honeywell International Inc. v. Narco Asbestos Personal Injury Settlement Trusts, adversary case number 21-02097, as part of In re: North American Refractories Co., case number 15-00204, in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania.\n\nSources: Law360, Narco Asbestos Trust and Honeywell\n\nEmployer Of Family Member Agrees to Pay $5 Million to Victim of Secondary Asbestos Exposure\n\nBeasley Allen’s mesothelioma lawyer Charlie Stern secured a $5 million settlement on behalf of a 56-year-old woman diagnosed with mesothelioma due to secondary asbestos exposure. Our client’s father had worked for the company for nearly 30 years in various positions, during which he was exposed to the known carcinogen.\n\nOur client’s father worked with and around asbestos-containing products and materials, during which his bib overalls would become covered in tiny asbestos fibers. Growing up, our client frequently rode with her mother to pick up her father from work. Upon seeing him approach, our client would jump out of the car to greet and hug him while he was still dressed in the same bib overalls he’d worked in all day. Additionally, our client routinely helped launder her father’s work clothes while growing up, resulting in her unwitting exposure to the deadly asbestos fibers.\n\nSecondary asbestos exposure — exposure to the cancer-causing mineral on the clothes of someone who worked in an environment contaminated with asbestos — can be just as dangerous as primary asbestos exposure. A 1997 study by Durham and Duke University Medical Centers among women diagnosed with mesothelioma found that half of them were victims of secondary asbestos exposure from either their spouse, parent, or child who worked in an asbestos-contaminated environment.\n\nCharlie had this to say about the settlement:\n\nDecades after the dangers of asbestos were widely known, some companies continued to cover up the fact that their workplaces were toxic to workers and their families. A lot of law firms shy away from cases like this. But we were not going to let our client down. This settlement is a small remedy to an otherwise terrible and unnecessary situation.\n\nIf you have any questions or need help with an asbestos case, contact Charlie Stern.\n\nCourt Orders Ford To Pay $6 Million In Asbestos Death Case\n\nA Missouri Circuit Court ordered Ford Motor Co. to pay $6 million to the family of a woman who developed mesothelioma and died after years of repeated exposure to asbestos in the factory where she worked.\n\nLinda Behling died from the rare, uncurable cancer in July 2019. She had spent decades working for Springfield, Missouri-based Executive Coach Builders Inc., which transformed new Ford Towncars into limousines.\n\nAccording to the family’s lawsuit, Ms. Behling worked at the limousine factory from 1985 to 2014. Her work there exposed her to dust from Ford-manufactured brakes, which contained asbestos fibers. The family alleged that repeated asbestos exposures stemmed from the “materials, products, equipment, conditions and activities” of her work, which caused her to inhale and ingest the fibers.\n\nThe family argued that Ford was liable for the deadly exposures because it failed to warn the public of the presence of asbestos in the brake dust emitted during brake repairs. Ford’s lawyers argued that Ms. Behling’s exposures were limited and that the role Ford allegedly played in her death could not be proven.\n\n“After examining the evidence, the jury found that Ford was a fault,” said the law firm representing Ms. Behling’s family in the case. “Nothing will bring Linda back. But this verdict is a statement that our system can hold companies accountable.”\n\nMs. Behling was 70 years old when she received her mesothelioma diagnosis. According to the family, Ms. Behling should have been enjoying retirement after decades of hard work at the factory. Instead, she had to cope with the debilitating effects of “asbestos-related diseases,” including mesothelioma, that eventually led to her death. She left behind two children, five grandchildren and one great-grandchild.\n\nThe Behlings were represented by Andrew Murrie and Brian J. Cooke, lawyers in the Simmons Hanly Conroy firm.\n\nThe case is Howard Behling et al. v. Ford Motor Co. et al., case number 1922-CC12004, in Missouri’s 22nd Judicial Court in St. Louis.\n\nSources: Law360 and Fox2Now\n\nThe Beasley Allen Asbestos Litigation Team\n\nAsbestos litigation continues to spread across the country.

Now, over one year later, the company is facing a new recall for the face masks of the recalled devices. Certain face masks for the CPAP and BiPAP machines have serious safety concerns due to the magnetic headgear clips that hold the mask in place.\n\nThe recalled devices are Amara View Full Face Mask, DreamWisp Nasal Mask, DreamWear Full Face Mask, Wisp and Wisp Youth Nasal Mask, and Therapy Mask 3100 NC/SP. The clips in these masks can potentially cause injury or death for people with specific implanted metallic medical devices or magnetic objects in the body.\n\nWhat is even more concerning is that it is not just the users of the mask that are in danger. Even those near a person using a recalled mask are at risk. Philips Respironics issued a press release on Sept. 6, 2022, recommending users of the recalled masks to stop their use immediately and switch to a non-magnetic mask if available. The list of devices placing users and those near a user at risk is extensive and includes pacemakers, insulin pumps, and implanted cardiovascular defibrillators.\n\nForty-three complaints, fourteen of which are classified by the FDA as serious injuries, were associated with this safety concern as of Sept. 9, 2022.\n\nBeasley Allen lawyers are investigating claims for the users of the recalled CPAP machines who have suffered from the adverse effects of the recalled Philips Respironics machines.

A National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) study recently found that women who used chemical hair straightening products, also called hair relaxers, more than four times per year were more than twice as likely to develop uterine cancer than those who did not. This is particularly shocking for the African American community, who use these products more than any other group.\n\nThe study relied on data from the Sister Study, a nationwide project of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), to learn how the environment and genes may affect a woman’s risk of developing breast cancer. For the latest study: Researchers identified 33,947 racially and ethnically diverse women aged 35-74 who had a uterus (also called the womb) when they enrolled. The researchers asked the women about the hair products they were using.\n\nAccording to the research conducted over nearly 11 years, women who reported using chemical relaxers were almost twice as likely to have been diagnosed with uterine cancer than those who did not. Women who reported being frequent users of straighteners (defined as more than four times in the previous 12 months) were about 2.5 times more likely to develop uterine cancer than those who did not use the products.\n\nHair relaxers are made by manufacturers such as L’Oréal, ORS, Revlon, Strength of Nature Global, Softsheen-Carson and many others. The hair relaxers are used to straighten, flatten and smooth hair. Most hair relaxers contain toxic chemicals such as formaldehyde, metals, phthalates, and parabens, which are associated with a higher risk of cancer, particularly hormone-sensitive ones such as breast and ovarian cancer.\n\nKey risk factors for uterine cancer include exposure to excess estrogen and a hormonal imbalance of estrogen and progesterone. It is believed that synthetic estrogenic compounds, such as endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), may contribute to uterine cancer risk because of their ability to alter hormones. Hair products that contain EDCs may provide a pathway for these chemicals to enter the body through scalp burns and abrasions often caused by chemical hair relaxers.\n\nPrevious studies involving data from the Sister Study have linked hair dye and chemical hair relaxers to breast cancer cases. Even more, hair relaxers aren’t just causing uterine cancer and breast cancer. The endocrine-disrupting chemicals, such as the phthalates, are also causing conditions such as endometriosis and uterine fibroids, which have been linked to infertility and pre-term deliveries.\n\nManufacturers raked in over $700 million in sales from hair relaxers in 2021 alone. The overwhelming share of users of chemical hair-relaxing products is Black women. Yet, manufacturers failed to warn women about the chemicals’ dangers despite studies dating back to 2011 that identified this risk. The FDA regulates cosmetics, including hair relaxers, based on the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act for products marketed for retail. Companies and individuals manufacturing or marketing hair relaxers are responsible for the safety and labeling of products and ingredients.\n\nBeasley Allen lawyers in our firm’s Mass Torts Section are actively investigating cases of uterine, ovarian, breast and endometrial cancers, endometriosis and uterine fibroids in women who developed these conditions after using chemical hair relaxers.

A vaginoplasty is a minimally invasive procedure designed to tighten the vagina and correct pelvic organs that drop from their normal positions. An alternative to vaginoplasty is a non-invasive vaginal tightening through heating tissues with radiofrequency waves or lasers. Laser treatments date back to the 1960s for various skin conditions, but beginning in the early to mid-2000s, the use of these lasers for vaginal rejuvenation procedures became increasingly popular. Laser vaginal rejuvenation companies boast that the process can improve vaginal dryness and urinary incontinence and also claim to create a firmer and more youthful vaginal area. Several manufacturers also claim that the procedure is painless.\n\nDespite these claims, many women experience severe pain in their vaginal areas due to thermal burns from lasers. The burns can subsequently cause scarring, muscle spasms, urinary issues, painful intercourse, infections, and inflammation. Several studies have investigated the use of laser vaginal rejuvenation procedures, and all are skeptical that they are safe and effective. In July 2018, FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, M.D., released a statement that laser devices used for these procedures have only been approved for removing precancerous cervical or vaginal tissue and genital warts, have not been formally approved for vaginal rejuvenation procedures and voiced concerns about inappropriate marketing of several devices used for these procedures.\n\nSources: Statnews.com and Food and Drug Administration\n\nAn Update On The Acetaminophen Litigation\n\nA leadership team of 22 lawyers has been selected for the acetaminophen litigation.
