        "text": "You don’t need to produce products to be an online retailer. In fact, many popular ecommerce strategies don’t require manufacturing at all.\n\nOne such business model is known as private labeling. Retailers work with private-label manufacturers to create unique products for their brands. Those private-label products are then shipped to a fulfillment partner, to the retailer for stocking, or directly to consumers.\n\nPrivate-label products are great for brands that have an established audience and want to expand their product catalog. Developing and selling private-label products is also a lucrative way for entrepreneurs to make passive income.\n\nIn this post, discover some of the best private-label products to sell, and learn how to kickstart your private-label brand.\n\nWhat is a private-label product?\n\nA private-label product is produced by a manufacturer and sold by a specific retailer under the retailer’s brand name.\n\nIt allows retailers to outsource production while collaborating on design, materials, and other manufacturing decisions.\n\nBrands may choose to sell private-label products to increase sales volume, cut costs, or offer items requiring specialist manufacturing techniques.\n\nPrivate labeling differs from white-label products, where retailers sell generic, mass-produced items.\n\n40+ private-label product ideas and manufacturers\n\nWorking with private-label manufacturers gives you access to millions of items to sell. But with so many potential items, sourcing products from a reliable supplier can be tricky.\n\nHere are some of the most popular private-label product categories. Each category contains private-label product ideas based on monthly search volume (MSV), as well as examples of relevant private-label and white-label manufacturers:\n\nPrivate-label apparel and accessories\n\nPrivate-label cosmetics and hair care products\n\nPrivate-label foods and supplements\n\nSell private-label apparel and accessories\n\nWith easily customizable designs and the potential for multiple color and material options, apparel products lend themselves to private labeling.\n\nHere are some of the most searched for apparel and accessories terms:\n\nBackpack (1,220,000 MSV)\n\nWomen’s jeans (368,000 MSV)\n\nMaternity dress (368,000 MSV)\n\nMen’s dress shoes (201,000 MSV)\n\nWomen’s hiking boots (165,000 MSV)\n\nWomen’s tank top (135,000 MSV)\n\nWomen’s yoga pants (49,500 MSV)\n\nWorkout shorts for men (9,900 MSV)\n\nPrivate-label apparel and accessory manufacturers\n\nIf you run a Shopify store and are interested in selling private-label apparel products, consider these suppliers:\n\nAOP+\n\nAvailable for retailers shipping to the EU, UK, and US, AOP+ is a platform for selling custom products on Shopify and Etsy.\n\nThis supplier specializes in organic print-on-demand (POD) products, where retailers add custom designs to clothing, home products, and accessories.\n\nBecause AOP+ handles manufacturing itself (unlike some other POD companies), you can work with it to create private-label apparel, furnishings, and accessories, including t-shirts, flip-flops, totes, and wall plaques.\n\nWhen you’ve designed your products, AOP+ syncs with your Shopify store to automate order processing and fulfillment.\n\nApliiq\n\nLos Angeles–based Apliiq is another private-label supplier and print-on-demand company specializing in apparel items. It focuses on trending products like woven labels, pocket tees, liner hoodies, and patch beanies.\n\nApliiq automates order processing and fulfillment, committing to shipping every order within a week. The Apliiq Shopify app also sends tracking information directly to your customers so they can see when orders will arrive.\n\nModalyst\n\nDropshipping supplier Modalyst works with US-based providers.\n\nFor private labeling, Modalyst specializes in athleticwear. Subscribing to the platform's Pro Plan gets you unlimited products, custom packaging and branding, and fast shipping—typically three to eight days for US orders and under 15 business days for international shipping.\n\nLike other manufacturer apps for private-labels, Modalyst automates order processing and fulfillment and offers live chat support for retailers.\n\nCreate private-label brands in cosmetics and hair care\n\nSome of the most successful ecommerce stores in recent years use private-label business models to sell cosmetics products.\n\nHere are the most searched-for keywords in the cosmetics and hair care niche:\n\nShampoo (673,000 MSV)\n\nHyaluronic acid (550,000 MSV)\n\nSunscreen (550,000 MSV)\n\nMoisturizer (450,000 MSV)\n\nHairspray (368,000 MSV)\n\nConditioner (246,000 MSV)\n\nDry shampoo (165,000 MSV)\n\nHair oils and serums (110,000 MSV)\n\nEye cream (110,000 MSV)\n\nHair wax (74,000 MSV)\n\nMousse (74,000 MSV)\n\nHair gel (60,500 MSV)\n\nExfoliating toner (18,100 MSV)\n\nNatural facial cleanser (6,600 MSV)\n\nCurl enhancing cream (1,000 MSV)\n\nCBD face oil (920 MSV)\n\nPolypeptide cream (590 MSV)\n\nPrivate-label cosmetics and hair care manufacturers\n\nTry this manufacturer for developing your own private-label cosmetics product line:\n\nThomasnet\n\nWith more than 500,000 suppliers and six million products, Thomasnet is a supplier directory for North America.\n\nTo use Thomasnet to find reliable private-label manufacturers, type “private-label manufacturing” or “contract manufacturing” into their search bar.\n\nYou’ll land on a results page with many product options, including beauty items, skin care products, dietary supplements, and CBD products.\n\nYou’ll find information about each manufacturer, including its capabilities, certifications, and contact info—as well as an option to request a quote.\n\nSell private-label products in food and supplement niches\n\nCompete with national grocery stores, who invest heavily in private-label brands, by targeting these popular food and supplement categories:\n\nCakes and pies (2,700,000 MSV)\n\nPasta (1,500,000 MSV)\n\nCandy and chocolate (1,200,000 MSV)\n\nProbiotics (673,000 MSV)\n\nSoup (550,000 MSV)\n\nNiacinamide (550,000 MSV)\n\nB vitamins (368,000 MSV)\n\nCondiments (165,000 MSV)\n\nGluten-free (135,000 MSV)\n\nBreakfast foods (110,000 MSV)\n\nOmega-3 fatty acids (90,500 MSV)\n\nOrganic foods (60,500 MSV)\n\nTri-Mag (22,200 MSV)\n\nFair trade (12,100 MSV)\n\nVitamin D3 liquid (3,600 MSV)\n\nZinc with elderberry (1,600 MSV)\n\nCBD (1,600 MSV)\n\nNon-dairy products (1,000 MSV)\n\nADK (480 MSV)\n\nLiposomal melatonin spray (390 MSV)\n\nPrivate-label food and supplement manufacturers\n\nDripshipper\n\nIf you want to sell coffee online using a private-label supplier, the Dripshipper Shopify app is a full-service solution.\n\nUsing Dripshipper, you can create and customize your own branded coffee packaging, logo, pricing, and labels.\n\nDripshipper is based in the US but ships worldwide. All shipments are sent within five days of an order—whole beans ship the same day they’re roasted, while ground beans are dispatched the next day.\n\nDepending on your monthly plan, Dripshipper also offers added support, coaching, and training. The Elite plan provides access to Dripshipper’s in-house design team.\n\nHow does a private-label business work?\n\nSuccessful private-label businesses have strong brands, efficient online checkouts, and good relationships with manufacturers.\n\nAfter researching a target market, retailers establish a brand and create sales channels to reach customers. Then, they’ll work with private-label suppliers to develop a product they can purchase, market, and sell for profit.\n\nMost private-label retailers serve a specific niche, where they can build an understanding of consumer needs and match products to those needs. Clothing and cosmetics stores often develop private-label product lines, as do grocery stores. Target has its Archer Farms private-label, for example. Walmart has Great Value, and Costco has Kirkland Signature.\n\nThe private-label business model continues to grow in popularity among national brands and small businesses—with store-brand private-labels making up a large proportion of many retailers’ total sales.\n\nAdvantages of selling private-label products\n\nBeyond outsourcing manufacturing, private labeling has several advantages, including:\n\nControl over production\n\nAs a retailer, you can work with third-party manufacturers to select materials and ingredients, as well as make decisions about product quality, production rate, and costs.\n\nControl over pricing\n\nOnce you know how much your private-label products will cost to produce, you have the freedom to develop your own pricing strategy and leverage your brand power to achieve a profit margin.\n\nAdaptability\n\nSmall retailers selling private-label products can move quickly in response to market demands. You could work with your supplier to add a new product feature or tweak a recipe.\n\nMeanwhile, larger companies with in-house manufacturing may be unable to pivot, giving you a window to secure market share.\n\nControl over marketing and branding\n\nWith private-label products, you have complete control over branding and marketing, including how they are presented to audiences and positioned in your catalog.\n\nDisadvantages of selling private-label products\n\nWhile private labeling has many benefits, it doesn’t come without its challenges. They include:\n\nDifficulty building loyalty from zero\n\nIf you’re a new brand, developing a following and customer base can take time. This is especially true for private-label retailers who don’t have a product development story.\n\nWithout a narrative about how you designed and crafted your products, you’ll need to find other ways to build a positive brand reputation.\n\nThis is one reason why private-label product lines are often launched by trusted names with established audiences.\n\nManufacturer dependency\n\nBecause a third-party manufacturer handles production, you’re largely at their mercy. Supply chain issues, price increases, and problems with product quality are all potential issues that impact private-label retailers—with retailers having little recourse to find solutions.\n\nThat’s why choosing a reputable, reliable supplier is so important. Quality can differ significantly depending on which private-label manufacturer you work with.\n\nHow to start a private-label brand\n\nSelling private-label products takes much of the effort out of product development. It lets retailers focus on the tasks they often excel at: branding, marketing, and selling to customers.\n\nOnce you've selected your products and manufacturer, here are the basic steps for retailers who want to open an ecommerce store using the private-label model:\n\nOrder samples\n\nSet up an online store\n\nAdd private-label products to your store\n\nLaunch and market your store\n\n1. Order samples\n\nIf possible, always test products thoroughly before making them available to your customers.\n\nWhile an item may look great online or in a manufacturer’s showroom, the reality may be completely different. Just as it may take a few orders to find the perfect fit for clothing, the same goes for working with private-label manufacturers.\n\nYou’ll want to do your due diligence to ensure the quality of products is up to your standards and expectations.\n\n2. Set up an online store\n\nNow it’s time to create your online store. With Shopify, you can build a store with a free trial using a variety of professionally designed website themes.\n\nOnce you’ve designed your store, set up sales channels on platforms like Instagram and TikTok to increase your brand’s reach.\n\nAfter setting up your website and sales channels, browse the Shopify App Store to find the apps you need to manage your private-label business. Many supplier apps will sync with your orders and inventory to automate shipping and fulfillment.\n\n3. Add private-label products to your store\n\nWhen adding products to your store, you’ll want to try these content marketing best practices:\n\nWrite compelling product descriptions. Product descriptions should be about the benefits customers will experience when they buy an item, not just the features and details of the product (although those are important, too).\n\nGet high-quality product images. Product photos are often the only way online shoppers can see what an item looks like. Try to step into your customers’ shoes and consider what images you’d need to make a purchasing decision if you’d never seen your product in the flesh. Sometimes, manufacturers can provide pictures for you.\n\nDetermine your pricing strategy. It’s crucial to price your private-label products high enough to make a profit, but not so high that you outprice your target market.\n\n4. Launch and market your store\n\nWhen you’re ready to reveal your store and private-label products to the public, it’s time to start marketing. You have to build awareness and drive traffic to your site to make your first sale.\n\nFor new stores, paid advertising on channels like Google, Facebook, and Instagram are a good way to promote your brand (and canvas competitors for future marketing and product ideas).\n\nOnce you have a baseline of site traffic, you can add to your outreach with email marketing, social media posts, SEO, and customer loyalty programs.\n\nLaunch your private-label brand\n\nStarting a private-label brand takes the hassle out of product development—a big challenge for many entrepreneurs. You can create an online store, build a following, and then work with manufacturing experts to design unique private-label products your customers will love."
