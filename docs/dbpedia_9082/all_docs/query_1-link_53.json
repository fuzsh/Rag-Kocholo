        "text": "The Philippine Standard (PS) Quality and/or Safety Mark and Import Commodity Clearance (ICC) Sticker serve as the consumersâ€™ guide and assurance that what they purchase are certified quality and safety products conforming to the relevant Philippine National Standards (PNS). Products covered by the BPS Mandatory Product Certification Schemes, whether locally manufactured or imported, are required to bear the PS mark or ICC sticker before being distributed in the Philippine Market.\n\nPS Marks\n\nICC Stickers\n\nActual\n\n2018-2020 version of ICC sticker\n\nAs a general rule, the PS mark or ICC sticker should be placed on the product itself, except in cases where affixing the mark/sticker to the product is not practicable, such as on ballasts, self-ballasted lamps, single/double capped fluorescent lamps, incandescent lamps, circuit breakers, electrical tapes, wires & cables, and flat cord; or if affixing the sticker to the product will cause damage to its original packaging such as on television sets, air-conditioning units, refrigerators, and microwave ovens.\n\nIf the sticker is affixed on the packaging, the importers, distributors, dealers, traders or retailers shall ensure that the corresponding box/package of the displayed unit is available for verification by monitors/enforcers of the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI).\n\nThe DTI monitors/enforcers regularly conduct monitoring and enforcement activities. They shall be given access to the stock room or store's warehouse to verify that all remaining originally packed inventories bear the corresponding ICC sticker or PS mark. Failure of the importers, distributors, dealers, traders or retailers to present the appropriate product's box/package to the authorized DTI personnel for verification during monitoring/enforcement activities shall be construed as a violation and shall be dealt with in accordance with established rules and policies.\n\nThe BPS encourages consumers to always look for the PS mark or ICC sticker when buying products covered under the mandatory certification and to report stores selling covered products without the said required markings."
