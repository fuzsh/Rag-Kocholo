        "text": "Philippine marking and labeling requirements are specified in the Philippine Consumer Act (Republic Act No. 7394) and Philippine National Standards (PNS). The Department of Trade and Industry (DTI)â€™s Bureau of Philippine Standards (BPS) is the national standards body that develops and implements the PNS.\n\nAll consumer products sold domestically, whether manufactured locally or imported, must contain the following information on their labels:\n\nCorrect and registered trade name or brand name,\n\nRegistered trademark,\n\nRegistered business name and address of the manufacturer, importer, or repackager of the consumer product in the Philippines,\n\nGeneral make or active ingredients,\n\nNet quality of contents, in terms of weight; and,\n\nCountry of manufacture, if imported.\n\nThe Philippine Consumer Act also requires related agencies to enforce additional labeling requirements for other products, including food, cosmetics, and hazardous substances. The Generics Act (Republic Act No. 6675) regulated labeling requirements for drugs.\n\nThe BPS implements a product certification mark scheme to verify conformity of products to PNS and other international standards. This includes critical consumer products such as chemicals, electrical and electronic products, as well as mechanical, construction, and building materials. Products manufactured locally must bear a Philippine Standard (PS) mark, while imported products must bear Import Commodity Clearance (ICC) certification marks issued upon inspection by BPS.\n\nFor list of products subjected to mandatory certification and additional information on labeling/marking requirements.\n\nContact:\n\nBureau of Philippine Standards - Department of Trade and Industry\n\n3F Trade and Industry Building, 361 Sen. Gil J. Puyat Avenue, Makati City"
