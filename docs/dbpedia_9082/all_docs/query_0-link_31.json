        "text": "Philippine trade organization\n\nThe Philippine Association of the Record Industry (Filipino: Kapisanan ng Industriya ng Plaka ng Pilipinas, abbreviated as PARI) is a non-profit and private trade organization, that represents the recording industry distributors in the Philippines.\n\nThe PARI was formed on February 10, 1972, and today is composed of 14 corporate members and 13 associate members. Since then, the association had worked with the Congress on drafting music copyright laws and had helped conduct raids on music pirates with the National Bureau of Investigation, Philippine National Police, Criminal Investigation and Detection Group and Optical Media Board.\n\nIt is also responsible for awarding music recording certifications in the Philippines. Annually, PARI organizes different music events such as the Awit Awards.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the early 1950s, music piracy started to grow in the Philippines. So, in 1952, major recording companies organized the first recording industry association in the country called the Record Industry Association of the Philippines (RIAP).[1] The association was mostly composed of foreign licensees.[2] The first president of RIAP was Manuel P. Villar of Mareco. In 1971, independent record companies decided to bond together and formed the Philippine Recording Industry Association (PRIA). Its primary goal was to promote local records. PRIA elected their first president which was Jose Mari Gonzales of Cinema-Audio.[3] In their years of existence, the two organizations had cooperated with each other in fighting piracy.\n\nOn February 10, 1972, another organization in the record industry was created called the Philippine Association of the Record Industry (PARI). Antonio Lustre of the Home Industries Development Corporation (HIDCOR) was elected as its first president.[4] After the first two organizations were disbanded, PARI became the only and legitimate association of the record companies in the Philippines, combining both major and independent record companies.\n\nIn 1990, the association began certifying recorded music in the Philippines. Constant Change by Jose Mari Chan was the first ever album to be certified. It was certified diamond on November 10, 1990. Since the awards program was launched, only eight albums were certified diamond by PARI.[5] Aside from Constant Change, the other seven are:\n\nChristmas in Our Hearts by Jose Mari Chan\n\nNina Live! by Nina\n\nA Wonderful Christmas by Christian Bautista\n\nAraw Oras Tagpuan by Sponge Cola\n\nDoo-Wops & Hooligans by Bruno Mars\n\nOther than certifying albums, the organization also certifies singles and music videos. On January 16, 2013, the first ever single was certified. It was \"I'll Be There\" by Julie Anne San Jose and it was certified quadruple platinum during that time.[6][5] On the other hand, no music videos are certified yet.\n\nThe Philippine Association of the Record Industry filed a complaint against the popular torrent website KickassTorrents, resulting in its seizure by Philippine authorities on June 13, 2013.[7]\n\nCertification levels\n\n[edit]\n\nBefore 1990, music certifications were only awarded by record labels in their artists through their own guidelines until PARI took the work.\n\nAlbum certifications include both physical and digital sales. Beginning in March 2012, PARI began to certify singles (both digital and physical) and music videos.[8] Before 2012, the thresholds for albums were distinguished between the domestic and international repertoire. Currently, domestic repertoire shares the same thresholds along with the international repertoire. For the full list of music certifications, please go to their database.\n\nAlbums\n\n[edit]\n\nCertification 1990 – \"mid 2000s\"[9][10] July 2004[11] – Oct. 2007[12] Oct. 2007 – Oct. 2008[13] Oct. 2008 – Apr. 2009[14][15] Apr. 2009 – Mar. 2012[16][15] Since Mar. 2012[17] Gold 20,000 15,000 15,000\n\n(10,000) 12,500\n\n(7,500) 10,000\n\n(7,500) 7,500 Platinum 40,000 30,000 30,000\n\n(20,000) 25,000\n\n(15,000) 20,000\n\n(15,000) 15,000 Diamond 400,000 300,000 300,000\n\n(200,000) 250,000\n\n(150,000) 200,000\n\n(150,000) 150,000 \"(number)\" or italicized numbers in parentheses represents international repertoire, if different.\n\nSingles\n\n[edit]\n\nCertification Since Mar. 2012[17] Gold 75,000 Platinum 150,000\n\nMusic videos\n\n[edit]\n\nCertification Since Mar. 2012[17] Gold 7,500 Platinum 15,000\n\nMembers\n\n[edit]\n\nThe members of Philippine Association of the Record Industry are divided into two: corporate and associate.
