        "text": "The model 910.33 adhesive label set for pressure gauges and dial thermometers enables the simple and individual marking of red and green on instruments.\n\nThe advantages for the user are freely definable scale ranges of red and green circular arcs for the required nominal size. The possibility exists for the required colour, length and position of the circular arcs to be applied from outside onto the window.\n\nThe simple attachment of the adhesive labels can also be carried out as a retro-fit on instruments that have already been installed.\n\nThe high-quality adhesive label material guarantees long-term stability and, in addition, the translucent properties permit the good readability of the underlying dial."
