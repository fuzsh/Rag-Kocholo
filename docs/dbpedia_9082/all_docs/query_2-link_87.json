        "text": "JTI began operations in the Philippines back in 2000 with JT International (Philippines), Inc. We have our market office and Global Business Services Manila (GBS Manila) in Taguig City, our manufacturing plant in Batangas, JTI Asia Manufacturing Corp. (JTI-AMC), and 38 sales branches spread across the country. Our portfolio includes international brands such as Winston, Camel and Mevius, as well as local brands Mighty and Marvels.\n\nWe have been awarded the prestigious Investors in People accreditation three times in recent years. Further to this, we have also been certified as a Top Employer two years in a row for 2022 and 2023. These accreditations cement our reputation as an employer that puts people first and harnesses their skills and talent to meet organizational objectives and shared goals.\n\nFootnotes: *including our Market head office, Global Business Services Manila, and the Asia Manufacturing Corp. factory\n\n**JTI Philippines’ calculation based in part on data reported by NielsenIQ through its Retail Index Service for the Cigarettes category for the 52-week period ending August 2021 for the Total Philippines.**(Copyright © 2021. The Nielsen Company (Philippines), Inc.).\n\n***Based on Volume % Share (M Sticks). Not a NielsenIQ endorsement.\n\nJTI’s investment in the Philippines\n\nJTI has been growing its presence in the Philippine market since its establishment in 2000. We have 4,500 employees working across our three entities including 38 sales branches in the country.\n\nWe set up a state-of-the-art manufacturing plant in Malvar, Batangas which began commercial operations in April 2017. JTI-AMC has been producing our brands efficiently and to the highest quality standards, addressing the demand for tobacco products both locally and globally.\n\nIn addition to our factory’s production of Winston, Camel, and Mevius, JTI-AMC also manufactures the Mighty and Marvels brands since 2017, when we acquired the home-grown tobacco manufacturing business of Mighty Corporation.\n\nWanting to help the market grow further, we established GBS Manila in 2020 in Taguig City. The launch of GBS Manila has helped us support the country in addressing unemployment, as we continued to hire individuals amidst the backdrop of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nFostering relationships with the community\n\nJTI has always been committed to giving back to the community. We continue to mount initiatives to foster relationships at the grassroots level to truly understand and help address the needs of communities where we operate. Our team has led relief operations during times of calamities, food aid programs to address hunger, mobility donations of pedal-powered bicycles to aid in their transport and logistics needs, and provided shelter by building houses, to name a few.\n\nWe also continue to expand our partnerships with local entities that aim to protect the environment. We believe that everyone has a role to play in protecting mother nature as we only have one planet to live on, and that caring for the environment ensures the future for generations to come. We have launched sustainability efforts like tree planting initiatives, a water infrastructure project, and our very own “Sustainability Days” in support of our sustainability goals.\n\nOur Sustainability Days celebrate the company’s many initiatives and programs related to sustainability. We share and promote efforts to spur sustainability in line with our day-to-day operations."
