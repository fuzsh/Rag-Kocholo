        "text": "Boeing has a long relationship with the Philippines and its national carrier Philippine Airlines (PAL) as well as the Philippines’ largest domestic carrier, Cebu Pacific Air.\n\nAs early as 1946, the PAL operated a fleet of five Douglas DC-3s and also chartered a DC-4 to ferry 40 American servicemen from Manila to Oakland, California, making PAL the first Asian airline to fly across the Pacific.\n\nSince 1946, PAL has operated DC-3/-4, DC-8, DC-10, MD-11, 727-100, 737-300/-400, 747-200B and 747-400 models. Most recently, the airline took delivery of two additional leased 777–300ERs in December 2017.\n\nThe national carrier currently operates several widebody 777-300ERs (Extended Range), including on routes between the Philippines, North America and Europe.\n\nCebu Pacific Air launched its original service with Boeing airplanes and has operated the DC-9 and 757-200."
