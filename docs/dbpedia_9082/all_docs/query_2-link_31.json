        "text": "The company started out in 2015 with the launch of Sacred Six Newborn Cleanser, a gentle cleanser specially developed for the first six months of a newborn’s life.\n\n“At the time, there were no products specifically for the needs of newborns. According to dermatologists, the first six months are the most crucial. We saw a gap in the market for a very simple, very gentle formula without ingredients like fragrances – formulated just for newborns,” ​said RJ Ceniza, co-founder of Read The Label.\n\nThe firm spent a year in the development of an effective yet simple cleansing formula, adhering to the ingredients ratings by the non-profit group, Environmental Working Group (EWG).\n\nThe result was a top-to-toe wash formulated with saccharide isomerate, a 100% naturally derived plant extract that has hydrating properties. It is able to strengthen the skin barrier and protect it from dehydration and skin sensitivity.\n\nSince launching Sacred Six Newborn Cleanser, the company has developed several more products, including Sacred 7+, a nourishing cleanser with antioxidant properties suitable for babies at seven months and above.\n\nThe company also expanded into mummy care with the Flourish range, which currently has two products: a prebiotic prenatal lotion and a baby bump mask.\n\nThis year, the company will add to the line-up with the launch of a new product, a four-in-one head-to-toe cleanser meant for children all the way to adults.\n\n‘Setting a standard’​\n\nWhile the company has been focused on mum and baby products, Ceniza told CosmeticsDesign-Asia​ that in 2021, it intends to expand its product line even further with the development of a range for teenagers.\n\nEventually, said Ceniza, the idea was to create an entire line of products that could service an entire family from birth to adulthood.\n\n“When we launched Sacred, we had a mission to develop a product to help newborns. We have since realised that in the Philippines, there are so many people with skin problems like atopic dermatitis and its has not been properly addressed. So, we want to develop products that can cover the whole family – maybe one day we will even have a Sacred grandpa line!”​\n\nCeniza added that the company is aiming to set a standard for beauty and personal care products in the Philippines, where consumers are growing increasingly concerned about product and ingredient safety.\n\nSince its launch, the company has grown 300% and has cultivated a strong following domestically, as well as in some countries overseas among Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs).\n\nWith solid brand awareness, Ceniza said the company was aiming to further strengthen its presence locally.\n\n“There’s definitely a big opportunity for the brand in the Philippines because the products are more mass market and there are few innovations in the market. We’re also seeing a trend for products with less harsh ingredients. Right now, we are more focused on the local market. We really want to dominate here.”​\n\nLocally, its currently available through retailers such as Mothercare, Mercury Drug and Robinsons Selections. Online, it is available on third-party retailers including Lazada, Shopee, Beauty MNL and Zalora, in addition to its official website. The brand is also distributed through a network of dermatology clinics.\n\nThe company is also open to expanding its presence to overseas markets."
