Philippine marking and labeling requirements are specified in the Philippine Consumer Act (Republic Act No. 7394) and Philippine National Standards (PNS). The Department of Trade and Industry (DTI)â€™s Bureau of Philippine Standards (BPS) is the national standards body that develops and implements the PNS.

All consumer products sold domestically, whether manufactured locally or imported, must contain the following information on their labels:

Correct and registered trade name or brand name,

Registered trademark,

Registered business name and address of the manufacturer, importer, or repackager of the consumer product in the Philippines,

General make or active ingredients,

Net quality of contents, in terms of weight; and,

Country of manufacture, if imported.

The Philippine Consumer Act also requires related agencies to enforce additional labeling requirements for other products, including food, cosmetics, and hazardous substances. The Generics Act (Republic Act No. 6675) regulated labeling requirements for drugs.

The BPS implements a product certification mark scheme to verify conformity of products to PNS and other international standards. This includes critical consumer products such as chemicals, electrical and electronic products, as well as mechanical, construction, and building materials. Products manufactured locally must bear a Philippine Standard (PS) mark, while imported products must bear Import Commodity Clearance (ICC) certification marks issued upon inspection by BPS.
