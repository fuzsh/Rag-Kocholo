Designed with Purpose, Inspired by Everyday Living.

With every design, there is purpose, there is inspiration, and there is you.

With a mission of extending beyond a family-brand concept, and establishing growth towards a more responsible and sustainable "community building" company, we strive to STAY LOCAL – in making use of local innovations, local textiles, and local labor. A brand that is proud to claim “Made in the Philippines, designed by Filipinos.”
