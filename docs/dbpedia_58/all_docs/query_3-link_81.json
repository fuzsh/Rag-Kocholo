        "text": "I signed up for RR.com so that the database will load into my programming software. Is there another database around that I can also use? There are too many errors in the frequencies I am attempting to use. For ex., Md Transit Authority Dispatch is one I'd use to listen to the Bay Bridge police, for lane closures and never-ending accidents. All I hear on it is Animal Control. I hear absolutely nothing using the Maryland State Police-Barrack \"P\", Glen Burnie frequency shown in the database. Maybe I'm doing something wrong. Prince George's Co police is also apparently missing dispatch frequencies. I was going to order the CD, but need to re-think that idea with the omissions and errors. Any ideas? Thanks.\n\nThere are no errors AFAIK. Assuming for a moment you are using a a handheld, hearing MSP on their low band frequencies is pretty much a waste of time if you are just using the duckie (the little antenna that comes with most handhelds). Such an antenna is extremely inefficient at such frequencies. You would have to be much closer to the unit (or the station) to hear them. I hear PG county dispatch constantly on my very old 895. And as for the MdTA- animal control?? What frequency are you using? Did you program the PL? That would be, I think 453.575 with a 127.3 PL. More often than not, the Port detachment (same frequency, PL 167.9) overrides the Bay Bridge detachment, at least where I live.\n\nIt would help if you were to dump your programming and attach it as a .zip file so others can look at it. You didn't mention what radio you are using, or if you are using software to program it...more specifics, please. Let's take this over to the Maryland forum, where this belongs. 73 Mike\n\nI hate to say it, but I'm such a newbie to this digital trunking stuff. I came from the old Bearcat 210 to the newer Pro-197. It's the desktop w/ expandable antenna. I even bought the rubber antenna, but noting gained by that.\n\nThis is the data brought over from Radio Ref, using Win500. The 1st one, 2256, only yields animal control traffic. Nothing heard on the others yet. The frequency you mentioned isn't even shown on this list. That's why I was wondering if there was a 2nd source.\n\nPolice Talkgroups\n\nDEC HEX Mode Alpha Tag Description Tag\n\n2256 08d A MTA PD Disp Dispatch Law Dispatch\n\n2288 08f A MTA PD Tac 1 Tactical 1 Law Tac\n\n2320 091 A MTA PD Tac 2 Tactical 2 Law Tac\n\n2352 093 A MTA PD Inves Investigations Law Tac\n\nAlso, this is what I used from RR for State Police. I can pick up Centreville and Easton Barracks, but not the Glen Burnie one for Annapolis area events.\n\nDEC HEX Mode Alpha Tag Description Tag\n\n6544 199 A MSP BarrackP MSP Barrack P Patch (Glen Burnie) Law Dispatch\n\nIncidentally, the look of RR seems different today than a week ago, and PG county now shows a host of frequencies. Lat week it only showed North, with a few freqs, none of which were dispatch, and nothing listed under South. So, I have some re-programming to try here.\n\nI went to Radio Shack in Annapolis to let them download their freqs in my scanner, in case they had the correct ones I was seeking, so I could upload them to my PC. What a mish-mash of stuff. Loads of public works and fire freqs, but none of AA Co N,S,E or W police dispatch. And, notably, MSP was absent.\n\nThanks\n\nI hear tg2256 constantly - on 2 seperate handhelds (a 396 and a 245). No 'animal control' .\n\nAnnapolis coverage by the GB barracks on low band would likely be very spotty at best, given how low their antenna is. I don't know what is being done about it, but I'm sure MSP is doing something - but what I have no idea. tg6544 was used a few times some months ago, but I haven't heard a peep out of it since. 73 Mike\n\n[edit] Let's be sure we're not mixing terms here - the Maryland Transit Admin trunk system doesn't cover the Bay Bridge - and is defined here...\n\nhttp://www.radioreference.com/apps/db/?sid=2539\n\nThe Bay Bridge detachment is under the Maryland Transportation Authority, and is defined here\n\nhttp://www.radioreference.com/apps/db/?aid=606\n\nIt's going to be tough to hear if you live in the Glen Burnie area, since, as mentioned earlier, the Port detachment, being closer, tends to override it.\n\nPG county's system is conventional in nature and has always had the North/South and district based freqs - and here's the link\n\nhttp://www.radioreference.com/apps/db/?ctid=1204\n\nThe 2 trunk systems are used for very special purposes - none of which I'm going to discuss on an open forum. They're kinda hard to hear around here on a duckie anyway.\n\nThanks ka3jjz. Sorry about my typo; I was referring to MdTA, MD Transit Authority. I listen to the police activity on the bridge.\n\nOK, to show you how new I am to this, I insert freq 453.575, and I can hear them Alot of static and the cars are weak. Dispatch is booming, however. But, I have no idea where/how to insert the PL 127.3 when I enter the prog mode/edit/curr. Maybe I'm missing something, but I don't see where to insert it. And, when I upload this to Win500, here is the line that appears:\n\nTUNE 453.575000 453.575000 FM Search 0\n\nThe squelch code is blank, and even here I don't see where to insert a PL.\n\nBut, how does this freq differ from the 2256? I just tuned in again, and the 2256 is AA Co animal control for me. No police activity like the 453.575, which is very busy. What are you hearing on 2256?\n\nThanks for you help.\n\nI wish I had one of the new GRE/RS scanners to help with Win500 and entering a PL - but that's what you need to do to have a chance at hearing the Bay Bridge detachment without hearing the others. I would go to the software forum and post a Win500 question there about where to enter the PL. Don Starr (the author of Win500, and the father of the firmware for the GRE radios, from which the RS radios are cloned) is often there, as is many other folks who use that software.\n\nYou should be aware that it will be a little problematic, however. Here's why - assume for a moment that you have just copied Bay Bridge, and the transmission just ends. Because it takes most scanners a fraction of a second or so to close squelch and resume scanning, there's a chance that you might get the tail end of a discussion from the Port detachment. You see, PL acts a little like a door - if the door is open, even a little, something else might bleed through. In addition, that frequency will be noisy as the 2 different detachments clash from time to time when 2 transmissions happen at the same time. On some Uniden scanners, there is the capability of 'blocking' unwanted PLs - I don't know if the GRE/RS scanners have that ability.\n\nI thought we might be crossing wires here, and we are. tg2256 on the Anne Arundel trunk is, indeed, animal control. However that same tg is also used on the MTA trunk (which I have in my scanners). To limit what you hear on a trunk system (any trunk system), you need to program a scan list. This is a list of talkgroups that represent only the things you want to hear. Once set up properly, you will ONLY hear things on a scan list, and nothing else. Again, if you have questions about how to set that up properly on Win500, go to the software forum and ask. There are LOTS of folks there that use Don's software.\n\n73 Mike\n\nHi 73 Mike. I just realized why I think [or thought] that the RR database was inaccurate. I went to the links you mentioned above. In fact, I even mentioned I thought the interface looked different than what I had seen earlier. But, when I use Win500 to web import trunk freqs, the information shown in the bottom description box is not necessarily what is shown on the reference links you provided. Using the web import feature, try going to United States/Maryland/Prince George's County North, for example. At the bottom you will see Sites and Talkgroups. If you import them, you will not see the freqs that are seen in the link you mentioned, which is more comprehensive. That'\n\ns why I didn't see any dispatch freqs. That's how I have been importing data, absent any user help files in the program. Is there an easier or better way - am I missing something? Perhaps this is why I still do not hear Md State Police-Glen Burnie Barrack, even when I am in their parking lot [they are;listed in Anne Arundel County]. And perhaps why I don't even see MSP-Hanover on the RR database anywhere, which is also in AA County.\n\nI'd appreciate any guidance.\n\nKarl\n\nI heard MSP GB quite frequently yesterday driving to and from work. But I am using a mobile antenna. That little duckie on these handhelds is extremely inefficient at VHF lo, but sitting right under their tower?? And what's this about MSP Hanover??? that's a new one on me, for sure.\n\nIf all you see are sites and talkgroups - no frequencies - when you import the PG County North system, something is amiss. I can just barely here them here with indoor antennas, but I can get them, so my programming is correct (I have a 396). As I mentioned before - go to the software forum and ask about Win500. I don't have a RS/GRE scanner, nor do I have Win500. I would also check out the Win500 import tutorial on the Utah scanner wiki (the link is on the GRE software page - see the link 'guide to win500').\n\nhttp://wiki.radioreference.com/index.php/Object_Oriented_Scanner_Software\n\nThe links are correct. This is, I'm pretty sure, a programming issue. It might be a good idea to dump your programming, zip (compress) it and attach it to the message when you ask on software forum. That way others can see what you are trying to do. 73 Mike"
