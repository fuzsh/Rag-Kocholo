        "text": "We all see the glamor and pomp of the big artists and imagine how wonderful their lives must be. Sometimes, we might even start wishing we had the talent to make a career like that happen. What many don't know is that there are thousands of artists, all brimming over with talent, that we've never heard of. While the global stars enjoy the backing of deep-pocketed record labels, many others have to do it all by themselves. We call them indie artists.\n\nIndie artists do not have the reach that the big record labels can boast of, so you're less likely to hear their music. That said, some radio stations have dedicated themselves to helping these young, talented artists find an audience, a stage, and a career. If you'd like to hear some indie music, you can tune into these stations. Also, if you're an indie artist looking for a platform to air your music, pay attention.\n\n7 Radio Stations That Play Indie Music\n\nAmazing Radio\n\nTrue to its name, Amazing Radio is one of the best radio stations for indie artists.

When it was founded in 2007, no other radio station bothered to play genres like alternative rock.

With about 90% of the music they play submitted by artists, they operate with the undiscovered artists of America in mind. They do not discriminate by genre or style, their only condition is that they love your song.\n\nYou can listen to Indie Radio FM online from anywhere in the world to get some of that indie juice. For artists, you can get in contact with them to see how you can submit your music.\n\nRadio Free Brooklyn\n\nRadio Free Brooklyn was founded in 2015 as a nonprofit, community radio station. Its main focus was to find young indie artists in Brooklyn and give them a platform to shine. Radio Free Brooklyn also featured shows and programs that educated people on the history and current affairs in the world of music. On Thursdays, for example, the schedule features shows like \"Black and Blues\" which talks about African American artists between the 1920s and the 1960s, and \"Vibe Architects\" which is an underground electronic music show.\n\nIf you're from Brooklyn, you already know what to do. If you're not from Brooklyn, you're not left out. The good news is that Radio Free Brooklyn has grown big enough to accommodate artists from other areas too.\n\nGrizz Radio\n\nWe started this list with a deep-pocketed station, and we're closing it with a student-run one. This small radio station is aimed specifically at providing the students of Adams State University, Alamosa, Colorado with a platform to showcase their talents. It's the perfect opportunity for a newbie artist or DJ to get good while building a vibrant fanbase. That said, it's a small station limited to the Alamosa area of Colorado and may not have a big enough audience to blow you up.\n\nRound Up\n\nOnline streaming platforms may be more popular in our time, but radio stations are still an effective way to enjoy music. Whether you're a music lover or an artist, you'd do well to pay attention to radio stations. For the listener, you might discover a gem of an artist. For an artist, it could be the breakthrough you've been looking for."
