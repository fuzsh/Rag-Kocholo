        "text": "Get The Led Out\n\nWeeknights at 10pm, you can be guaranteed a Whole Lotta Led. It’s always a different mix of songs from Led Zeppelin, as Mike Brilhart gives you some interesting twists on this once in a lifetime band and their music. You never know if a 2 minute song or a 10 minute song is up next!\n\nThe Vinyl Frontier-Monday-Friday at 11PM\n\nYes, we play vinyl…and why not? It’s the way the artists wanted us to hear this great music. Mike Brilhart spins a classic album side for you Monday – Friday at 11pm. You’ll hear the hits, the deep cuts and Mike will usually tell you where he bought the album and who spilled beer on it in his basement."
