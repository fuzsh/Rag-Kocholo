        "text": "Policy Area 1 - Early Childhood Education\n\nEach public prekindergarten program in Maryland is required to publish a rating of Level 4 or higher in Maryland Excels by July 1, 2025, with a five-year plan to achieve Maryland Accreditation. The accreditation of pre-K programs serves to uphold and promote high standards of early childhood education, benefiting both children and their families by providing assurances of quality and fostering continuous improvement in educational practices. In the spring of 2024, the following elementary schools achieved Maryland Accreditation: C. Paul Barnhart, Dr. James Craik, Dr. Thomas L. Higdon, Gale-Bailey, Indian Head, Malcolm, and Mt. Hope/Nanjemoy. These seven schools will publish in Maryland Excels in the fall of 2024. Dr. Samuel A. Mudd, Eva Turner, and J.P. Ryon also hold current Maryland Accreditation certificates and are published at a rating of Level 5 in Maryland Excels. The remaining schools are in the process of working toward achieving Maryland Accreditation by the end of school year 2024-2025.\n\nPolicy Area 2 - Diverse Teachers and Leaders\n\nPer the requirements of the Blueprint, each LEA was required to give teachers a 10% salary increase between July 1, 2019, and June 30, 2024, above the negotiated schedule of salary scales. CCPS was able to meet this requirement through a series of cost-of-living adjustments (COLA) over the last several years. An attestation was signed by both Dr. Navarro and President Commissioner Collins to prove this statutory requirement was met. A copy of this can be found under 2023-24 Yearly Reports on the system’s Blueprint webpage.\n\nPolicy Area 3 - College and Career Readiness (CCR)\n\nEach local school system is required to develop a comprehensive literacy plan for all students. This plan was due to MSDE by June 28, 2024. Components of the plan include curriculum and instruction, professional learning, multi-tiered systems of support (MTSS), instructional leadership, and community culture and engagement. System stakeholders including central officer personnel, teachers, and community members provided feedback on various components of the local plan.

The AIB had reviewed the MOU and provided feedback to the three organizations. Clarifications were requested from the AIB regarding the budget. While changes to the actual MOU were not made, budget clarifications were made. Because the MOU was already signed by CCPS, CSM, and TCCSMD when additional clarifications were requested, each agency had to provide additional permission that the budget clarifications were accepted by all parties. This delayed the submittal of the MOU to the AIB.\n\nPolicy Area 4 - More Resources to Ensure All Students are Successful\n\nThe three new schools in CCPS that have been identified as a community school have each hired a community school coordinator and additional nurse to help provide access for wrap-around services.

The schedule is as follows: June 16- Pillars 3 and 5, June 23- Pillars 1 and 4, June 30- Pillar 2.\n\nEarly Childhood Education\n\nCCPS has confirmed that no private providers in Charles County received any of the prekindergarten grants offered by the Maryland State Department of Education (MSDE). Three private providers in Charles County applied to receive grant funding intended to expand prekindergarten services to students, but all three did not meet the requirements set forth by the MSDE. MSDE has stated they intend to provide support to these private providers to help them meet the requirements for grant funding in the future. CCPS will also provide support to private providers to help them with the requirements of the grants in order to help expand prekindergarten services to students in our county.\n\nHigh Quality & Diverse Teachers and Leaders\n\nThe MSDE has convened a small advisory committee to make recommendations regarding the document titled Blueprint for Maryland’s Future Implementation Guidance: Initial Eligibility for National Board Certification Salary Increase Incentives (see April 2022 update for more information). Six school systems have been selected to provide feedback regarding current policy regarding National Board Certification (NBC) including representation from CCPS. All CCPS nationally board-certified educators have been notified regarding whether or not they are eligible to receive the additional $10,000 salary increase beginning next school year. Those educators that were not eligible had an opportunity to request a transfer to a position that allows them to earn the additional salary increase.\n\nCollege and Career Readiness (CCR)\n\nThe selection committee for early college entrance, comprised of representatives from CCPS and the College of Southern Maryland (CSM), convened to review the applications of students wanting to participate in the early college pilot program. The program is being piloted at Lackey, St. Charles, Stone, and Westlake high schools. In order to participate, students need to meet specific requirements including GPA, specific coursework, and number of high school credits. 72 students were accepted into the program.\n\nMore Resources to Ensure All Students are Successful\n\nDr. Mudd Elementary School, our first community school with additional funding for wraparound services for students and families funded by the Blueprint, held its first Community Wellness Day on Saturday, May 21st. Focused on advocating on the physical and mental health of the community, 30+ vendors were present and interacted with community members that attended. Participants were able to receive needed vaccines, COVID-19 tests, and food baskets. Opportunities to sign-up for various services included organizations that could help with food shortages, summer camps for students, and other needs expressed by the community. Approximately 263 families attended the event.\n\nGovernance and Accountability\n\nThe Accountability and Implementation Board (AIB) is seeking applications for its advisory committees. Four advisory committees will be formed around the following policy areas: early childhood education, high-quality and diverse teachers and leaders, college and career readiness pathways, and more resources to ensure all students are successful. Applications are due by midnight on June 20th.

Currently, AlphaBEST is only licensed for students five years and older and per the regulations, students in AlphaBEST under the age of five cannot be in the same space as those above the age of five. The Maryland State Department of Education (MSDE) Office of Child Care’s (OCC) will need to approve the expansion for students under five and visit every elementary school as a part of process. We are hopeful this can be accomplished in time for the start of the 2022-2023 school year. Dr. Navarro spoke at the public forum portion of the Maryland State Board of Education meeting on April 26th to highlight the feedback the school system has received from private childcare providers about why many providers have not applied to receive state funds to provide prekindergarten programs. The clip can be found at the 12 minute mark on the video below:\n\nClick here to view the video\n\nHigh Quality & Diverse Teachers and Leaders\n\nThe MSDE has provided a document called Blueprint for Maryland’s Future Implementation Guidance: Initial Eligibility for National Board Certification Salary Increase Incentives which aims to address unified language and understanding around those educators that are eligible to receive salary increases associated with National Board Certification (NBC) beginning July 1, 2022. This document is considered a working document; therefore, additional clarifications and/or changes should be anticipated. The most up-to-date version College and Career Readiness (CCR)\n\nThe proposed recommendation by the Accountability and Implementation Board (AIB) made to Maryland legislators to delay the requirement for districts to create a program of study for students that don’t meet the CCR requirement by the end of 10th grade until the 2023-24 school year has been passed and signed into law by Governor Hogan. The steering committee worked to identify current supports in place for students and is currently working in identifying the supports that are used effectively in other school systems.\n\nMore Resources to Ensure All Students are Successful\n\nThe steering committee recommends the following priorities be adopted in order to help with student achievement in Charles County Public Schools:\n\nProvide math and reading resources aimed at improving student achievement to students, teachers, and parents/guardians based on data iReady assessment scores that are administered to students throughout the school year;\n\nCreate a hybrid or virtual option for all students that includes the same rigorous options (AP) and allows students to participate in sports and other extra-curricular activities; and\n\nAlign hiring practices to ensure our best teachers are working with our neediest students.\n\nGovernance and Accountability\n\nDuring the past Maryland legislative session, House Bill 1450, which altered timelines for the Blueprint’s implementation, was passed. Specifically, this bill extends the State Implementation Plan deadline from Feb. 15, 2022 to Dec. 1, 2022; extends the MSDE deadline for plan criteria from April 1, 2022 to Sept. 1, 2022; and extends the local implementation plan deadline extended form June 15, 2022 to March 15, 2023. The MSDE plans to provide ongoing technical support to local districts as they develop plans that will begin this summer or early fall.\n\nEarly Childhood Education\n\nSeveral meetings with various stakeholders were held during the month of March. The Blueprint mandates that all instructional assistants in prekindergarten classrooms hold either a child development associate (CDA) or an associate’s degree by the 2025-26 school year. Meetings were held for all instructional assistants impacted by this mandate to share this information, as well as to gather input from them to help the district create pathways for staff to meet these requirements. Preliminary estimates show this will cost approximately $10,000 per employee. Representatives from CCPS presented to the Early Childhood Advisory Council (ECAC) of Charles County focusing on expanding access for prekindergarten students by private providers. Some hesitation on the part of private providers to participate was shared due to experiences private providers have had in the past with getting funds owed to them in a timely manner from the Maryland State Department of Education (MSDE). Our system is still greatly concerned that we could have no private providers in the county who apply to receive Blueprint\n\nHigh Quality & Diverse Teachers and Leaders\n\nThe team continues to work on possible scenarios to ensure CCPS is on a trajectory to meet salary requirements for staff as required in the Blueprint. There will be additional updates once the County Commissioners finalize the allocations for CCPS and the BOE finalizes the school system’s budget.\n\nCollege and Career Readiness (CCR)\n\nThe Accountability and Implementation Board (AIB) made recommendations to Maryland legislators to delay the requirement for districts to create a program of study for students that don’t meet the CCR requirement by the end of 10th grade. Currently, the law states districts must create a program of study for students by the 2022-23 school year. The proposed recommendation would delay the mandate for one school year. Because of standard setting due to a new Maryland assessment, districts would not have data by the beginning of the school year from the MSDE to place students in a program of study. The bill has been reviewed by both chambers and will go to Governor Hogan.\n\nMore Resources to Ensure All Students are Successful\n\nDr. Mudd Elementary School, our first community school in the district, will be hosting a Community Health Fair Day on Saturday, May 21 from 10:00am to 1:00pm at the school site. Community schools work with local stakeholders to provide wrap around services and supports to their students and their families. We are excited that Indian Head Elementary School has received funds to become a community school in school year 2022-23.\n\nGovernance and Accountability\n\nPer the Blueprint, each district is required to have a 9th grade tracker system that will measure each student’s progress towards graduating on time. A report in our current student information system, Synergy, is being used for this requirement and is now considered “live” for all 9th grade students since semester grades were completed. School administrators were provided training on how to access the report. Parents and students can access the report using ParentVUE or StudentVUE by clicking on the Documents tab. They can then click on the Graduation Tracker report to see testing requirements, student-service learning information, and information about credits attained and still needed.\n\nEarly Childhood Education\n\nThe Maryland State Department of Education (MSDE) opened two grant opportunities to both public and private childcare providers with the hope of expanding prekindergarten access to more students in Maryland. With help from MSDE’s Office of Childcare, CCPS invited all private, licensed childcare providers in Charles County to attend one of two informational sessions held on February 10th and February 15th. The purpose of these sessions was to ensure private providers had the information provided by MSDE about the upcoming grant opportunities, answer any questions they may have about the grant process and requirements, offer any assistance and support, and determine if any private providers may be applying for grants to expand prekindergarten. At this time, we are very concerned we will not have any private providers in Charles County to expand prekindergarten programs for residents and this could impact the number of tier two and tier three students that will not have access to prekindergarten in the future.\n\nHigh Quality & Diverse Teachers and Leaders\n\nSteve Roberts, Director of Accountability, presented information regarding the process for the current CCPS teacher evaluation system. Discussions focused on the alignment of the current teacher evaluation system to the requirements of the Blueprint. Changes, which would likely have financial implications, would likely need to be made including training for all observers, creation of a competency assessment for observers, and modifications to the current teacher evaluation system hub called The Evaluation and Assets Management System (TEAMS). An extensive plan for professional learning for all stakeholders will need to be implemented.\n\nCollege and Career Readiness (CCR)\n\nOptions for career exploration continues to be researched within the steering committee. February’s meetings focused on how to target access for students in elementary school. Several suggestions including themed early dismissal explorations, embedded curricular documents and lessons, and online programs that could be enhanced were discussed. More clarification is needed from Elementary Programs in order to make further recommendations.\n\nMore Resources to Ensure All Students are Successful\n\nThroughout the month of January, members of this steering committee spent time reaching out to colleagues and community members to seek input regarding services and/or programs that were needed to ensure students did not have barriers at school. A comprehensive list was shared within the steering committee, and participants were asked to prioritize the top three. These top three priorities will be shared as recommendations for the Blueprint plan.\n\nGovernance and Accountability\n\nChanges have been made in Synergy, the system’s student information system, for the prekindergarten registration. All families will be required to submit family income documentation as a part of the registration process. In the past, only families who qualified for free and reduced meals (FARMS) were required to submit this paperwork. Students in tier one, whose family income is 300% or below of the federal poverty rate, will qualify for prekindergarten with income verification. If space allows, students in tier two, whose family income falls within 301% and 600% of the federal poverty level, will be given next priority for acceptance to prekindergarten. Students in tier three, whose family income is above 601% of the federal poverty level, will be only accepted if space allows once tier one and tier two students have been placed. Prekindergarten registration for school year 22-23 opens on March 28, 2022.\n\nSchool Year Slot Federal Poverty Level Qualifying Income for a Family of Four 2021-22 Category 1 185% or less $49,025 and below 2022-23 Tier 1 300% or less $79,500 and below 2022-23 Tier 2* 301%-600% $79,501-159,000 2022-23 Tier 3* 601% and above $159,001 and above\n\n*Beginning in school year 2024-25, there will be a family share for tiers 2 & 3.\n\nEarly Childhood Education\n\nParticipants were divided into three subgroups to research information provided by MSDE from three states that currently use income eligibility guidelines for pre-kindergarten programs. Meetings have been scheduled for early February between CCPS staff and private childcare providers in Charles County. The purpose of these meetings is to establish partnerships and expand access to pre-kindergarten students. While the opportunity for private providers to apply for state money has not happened yet, MSDE is hopeful this will happen within the next month or two.\n\nHigh Quality & Diverse Teachers and Leaders\n\nThe steering committee finalized its work in four subgroups based on the four steps of the teacher career ladder. Subgroups reviewed and shared recommendations based on current career ladders in other school systems to help create possible guidance for the school system when career ladders must be implemented by the July 1, 2024 deadline. While there continues to be great discussion as it relates to the career ladder, some aspects of the career ladder will need to be negotiated by the local bargaining unit. The committee is making a recommendation that a local career ladder development board be formed per the recommendation of the Blueprint.\n\nCollege and Career Readiness (CCR)\n\nThe two subgroups that have been formed within this committee met as one large group for this month’s meeting in order to share information with each other and plan for upcoming agenda items. The two subgroups are focusing on creating differentiated pathways for students that are not CCR by the end of 10th grade and providing elementary and middle school students with additional CTE courses. The group has determined they would like more information about past and current supports for students who are not CCR by the end of 10th grade. They have requested additional information from content specialists, as well as information from a school’s perspective. Additional programs for elementary and middle schools will be explored to help determine how CTE will be expanded and the subsequent costs including training, personnel, and other costs associated with implementation.\n\nMore Resources to Ensure All Students are Successful\n\nInformation regarding current reading programs in elementary schools was shared with participants, as well as the data from the fall iReady assessment in reading. Participants were asked to assess how to best address the needs for students using the available data and share ideas that support research-based practices and programs. Updates regarding the progress of the other four steering committees was shared.\n\nGovernance and Accountability\n\nThe three subgroups that have been formed within this committee continued to meet on the following topics: pre-kindergarten registration, student scheduling best practices, and requirements to monitor the career ladder. The subgroups are continuing to work on recommendations for protocols that align with effective research-based practices. A quote to make customizations to the current registration platform for pre-kindergarten was received. It will cost the school system $7,500 to make the necessary changes for the pre-kindergarten registration process because of the Blueprint.\n\nEarly Childhood Education\n\nA review of the current pre-kindergarten registration process was shared with group members. Additional information about a family’s income will be needed from all pre-kindergarten registrants per the mandates of the Blueprint. The steering committee focused on providing recommendations for changes that would need to be made to the registration process and was shared with members of the Office of Accountability (the office responsible for school registration) and the policy area 5 subcommittee.\n\nHigh Quality & Diverse Teachers and Leaders\n\nWith the implementation of career ladders coming July 1, 2024, committee members worked to understand the requirements of each of the four levels of the ladder. Expert groups were formed to review the career ladders in place in another school system in Maryland to analyze its alignment to Blueprint and to determine if any of these practices should be implemented in Charles County Public Schools. This work will continue into the coming months.\n\nCollege and Career Readiness (CCR)\n\nThe steering committee has been split into two subgroups in order to best continue its focus on identifying pathways for students who are not CCR by the end of the 10th grade and creating introductory CTE courses in elementary and middle school. The first subgroup is focusing on learning about the State’s requirements to identify a student as CCR and are working to identify the needs of students to match them with appropriate supports. The second subgroup is researching existing CTE programs in other school systems for elementary and middle school students.\n\nMore Resources to Ensure All Students are Successful\n\nData regarding students’ fall performance on the iReady test in math and reading was shared with the committee to help determine where resources should be focused. Members of the steering committee provided feedback and additional questions about how the data is being used in schools. Steering committee members requested an update at a future meeting to learn about the work of the other steering committees.\n\nPolicy Area 5- Governance and Accountability\n\nUpdates were shared on upcoming due dates for the Blueprint. Information regarding the changes necessary for pre-kindergarten were shared including the need to collect income verification from all students who register. Information was also shared regarding the need for various information systems within CCPS to be able to “talk” to each other including Synergy, the system’s student information system (SIS), Insystech’s TEAMS, the teacher evaluation system, and the new human resources database.\n\nEarly Childhood Education\n\nAn overview of the policy area and important dates was shared with the steering committee. The Blueprint mandates requirements of both teachers and instructional assistants working in prekindergarten classrooms. The mandates of the instructional assistants require a minimum of an associate’s degree or a child development associates. These mandates will take effect for school year 2025-26. Questions were generated by the group for MSDE to answer. The next meeting will focus on this information.\n\nHigh Quality & Diverse Teachers and Leaders\n\nAgenda items for each meeting have been determined for the duration group. Because the Blueprint mandates salary increases associated with National Board Certification (NBC) begin in SY 2022-23, November’s meetings were dedicated to learning about NBC in Charles County, and discussions were focused on how to best expand and support NBC.\n\nCollege and Career Readiness (CCR)\n\nAn overview of the policy area and important dates was shared with the steering committee. A review of where the system is currently at as it relates to future goals of the Blueprint was discussed. Two areas of focus were identified for immediate future work:\n\nCreating CCR standards program of study for those who have not met CCR by the end of 10th grade;\n\nCreating introductory CTE courses in elementary and middle school.\n\nMore Resources to Ensure All Students are Successful\n\nAn overview of the policy area was shared with the steering committee. Participants in the steering committee were asked to share information about current programs that support the Blueprint including transitional supplemental instructional, equity, community schools, and mental health. Participants asked to review data at the next meeting to identify what schools and students need additional support.\n\nGovernance and Accountability\n\nAn overview of the policy and deadlines was shared with the steering committee. One of the items required in the Blueprint is a 9th grade tracker that measures each students progress towards graduating on time, including credit accumulation. Synergy, CCPS student information system (SIS), currently has several reports that meet the requirements of the Blueprint. The steering committee focused what additional information could be included in the current reports to improve them for various stakeholder groups, as well as how to best share these reports with necessary stakeholders including students, school counselors, and administrators."
