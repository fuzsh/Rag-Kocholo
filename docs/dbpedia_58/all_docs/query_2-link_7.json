        "text": "About the Baltimore Location Near Me\n\nYour dreams of becoming an on-air sportscaster, talk show host, DJ, programming director or station manager in Baltimore have the best chance of becoming reality if you can get into a real broadcasting facility as an extern. We’re the school that makes that happen for you.\n\nYou could part with 10-50 thousand dollars of your hard-earned money to go to a broadcasting training program in a college or trade school, or you could spend a fraction of that amount and learn the same thing from the professionals in a real radio station. The choice is clear! Get on the inside track and get connected to the radio industry by learning the ropes from inside it. No broadcasting school gets you closer to the action–for less money–than our radio school alternative.\n\nTo APPLY for our Baltimore Radio School, click here.\n\nHome to just over 600,000 residents, and anchoring a surrounding metro area of over 2 million people, Baltimore is the 21st ranked radio market in the United States, as well as the 27th ranked television market. While resting in the signal shadow of Washington, DC (Baltimore residents can pick up several DC stations), Baltimore is a major media market in its own right, with nearly 20 major radio stations and dozens of smaller ones, broadcasting such formats as Classic Rock, Country, Top-40, News/Talk, Hip-hop, Adult Contemporary and many others. With Baltimore’s long history with both baseball and football (home to both the Ravens and the Orioles, and the birthplace of Babe Ruth), sportscasters in particular have plenty to talk about in this market. Baltimore also has a special legacy with radio, television and music; the musical Hairspray was inspired by real-life DJ Buddy Deane who hosted a local dance show in Baltimore from 1957-1964, which came under fire for allowing a racially integrated dance floor.\n\nWhether your career path is toward becoming a talk show host, DJ, technician, marketing director or station manager, the pros generally agree that the best way to learn the skills and to make the connections you need is to learn the ropes inside an actual radio broadcasting facility. Baltimore offers plenty of real-world opportunities to learn, and the RADIO CONNECTION can help you make the most of these opportunities where other broadcasting schools can’t.\n\nCombining our innovative mentor-extern learning approach with the hundreds of working relationships we’ve forged in radio over the years, we are able to place each of our students as a working extern inside a real radio station, where a highly experienced radio professional trains the student one-on-one, combining our structured curriculum with plenty of hands-on experience in the studio. With our unique program, you will not spend a single day in a classroom; instead, during our six-month course, you will gain many hours of real-world studio experience while forming valuable connections within the radio industry. Our program has a long track record of success, with many of our graduates going on to successful broadcasting careers. Why wait? Enroll in our Baltimore radio school today, and find out what we can do for your career!"
