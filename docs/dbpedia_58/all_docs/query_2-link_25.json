The key is to know who your customer is, and why they like to do business with you. Once you know the characteristics of your best customers, you simply need to target your advertising in a way that converts prospective customers with similar characteristics into loyal customers. It is important to remember that most businesses are simply unable to effectively be all things to all people. Always keep in mind that when you select a particular advertising vehicle (radio, television, print, outdoor), you are buying an audience. The goal is to buy the right audience for your business and improve your chances for success. Advertising creates store traffic, attracts new customers, boosts and maintains morale, is an investment in success, encourages repeat business, generates continuous business, keeps your business top-of-mind, keeps you in the competitive race, gives your business a successful image, and businesses that succeed are usually strong, steady advertisers.[/su_spoiler]\n\n[su_spoiler title=”Is radio right for me?” style=”default” anchor=”FAQ”]If radio were invented today, it would be all the marketing rage. Why? Because we live in an on-the-go society, and unlike newspaper or television, radio is with us everywhere; in the car, at work, and in the home. Radio is an affordable, mobile, and intrusive medium that provides advertisers with the ability to target a specific audience. When used correctly, radio provides a cost-effective marketing platform for nearly any type of business.\n\nRadio can reach on-the-go consumers and allows you to establish a special relationship with consumers. Radio’s listenership remains strong, while time spent with other media declines. Radio can cost-effectively knock through the sea of media bombardment. Radio creates success with powerful and profitable on-location remote broadcasts. Radio’s unique formats allow you to target your best prospects. Radio reaches prospects closest to the point of purchase. Radio can bridge the gaps left by other media options. Radio provides unique specialized on-air promotions. Radio is king for establishing top-of-mind-awareness.[/su_spoiler]\n\n[su_spoiler title=”How do I get started?” style=”default” anchor=”FAQ”]Research our website to answer your basic questions. When you’re ready to take the next step, contact us so we can perform a custom marketing analysis for you. After answering a series of questions and telling us what you want to accomplish, we can put together a customized game plan for your business. Once you agree on the advertising schedule, we will develop a commercial that effectively tells your story or makes the case for your product or service.[/su_spoiler]\n\n[su_spoiler title=”What are the most frequent mistakes advertisers make?” style=”default” anchor=”FAQ”]Not having the right level of commitment and focus. Many business owners think they need to do a little of everything instead of doing one thing well. It’s been said, “I throw my advertising dollars against the wall and hope some of it sticks.” Almost any business can get all the customers they need by simply attacking and dominating the right radio station.\n\nThrowing in the towel before the advertising can work. Advertising is like trying to get in shape. Getting started is the hardest part, and the rewards for your time and effort are not always readily apparent. However, with a healthy dose of commitment and focus to your plan, you will eventually enjoy the results. Successful advertising is no different.[/su_spoiler]\n\n[su_spoiler title=”I want to build my business, what do you suggest?” style=”default” anchor=”FAQ”]Be realistic about your expectations and the investment that you’re willing to make. Then meet with one of our advertising professionals to do an in-person marketing analysis interview. We will then be able to assess how we can help you. Assuming that our audience is right for your business, we will develop an appropriate campaign and develop a commercial that effectively tells your story or makes the case for your product or service.[/su_spoiler]\n\n[su_spoiler title=”What’s the best way to advertise?” style=”default” anchor=”FAQ”]Unless you’re having a special event, TOMA (top-of-mind awareness) advertising yields the greatest long-term benefits. Not everyone needs your products or services today, so advertising for a month is a crapshoot. Reminding a large group of consumers who are most likely to do business with you about your Unique Selling Proposition over and over is most beneficial. When any of our listeners need your product, our goal is to have your business in their top-of-mind recall.[/su_spoiler]\n\n[su_spoiler title=”How long does it take for advertising to begin working?” style=”default” anchor=”FAQ”]This depends on what you are selling and the offer you’re making. Tell people to visit you for a free $100.00 bill, and you’ll have a traffic jam outside your business. Otherwise, advertising is similar to pushing a car. It’s tough at first, but the more you push, the easier it gets. Soon enough you can move the car along with minimum effort. We tell our new clients, “In three months you’ll hate me, in six months you’ll talk to me again, and in ten months you’ll be inviting me to your house for dinner.” Stick with your plan and you’ll be provided a healthy return on investment.[/su_spoiler]\n\n[su_spoiler title=”What is TOMA?” style=”default” anchor=”FAQ”]TOMA (top-of-mind awareness) advertising yields the greatest long-term benefits. Not everyone needs your products or services today, so advertising for a month is a crapshoot. Consistently reminding a large group of consumers, who are also most likely to do business with you, about your Unique Selling Proposition, is most beneficial. When any of our listeners need your product, our goal is to position your business in their top of mind recall.[/su_spoiler]\n\n[su_spoiler title=”What should I say in my commercial?” style=”default” anchor=”FAQ”]Ask yourself, “Why should someone do business with me?” Be specific. “What truly makes me a better choice than my competitors?” “What makes us special?” “What is our Unique Selling Proposition?” Take a look at your strengths versus your competitor’s weaknesses that can result in taking business from them. Our goal is to grow your business by getting you an unfair share of the market’s dollars from your competition. A marketing analysis with one of our advertising professionals can help us fine-tune your message.[/su_spoiler]\n\n[su_spoiler title=”How can I guarantee success?” style=”default” anchor=”FAQ”]After ensuring your business is in fine operating order, stick to a well-constructed advertising message month after month. If you deliver your message consistently to the right people, your advertising will yield rewarding results.[/su_spoiler]\n\n[su_spoiler title=”I’m a retailer, what’s best for me?” style=”default” anchor=”FAQ”]Do you live and die by sale events, or do you want more consistency for your business? Sale event advertising can drive customers, but it’s the “drug of marketing.” The more sales you have, the more advertising you need. However, if you want a steady, less fickle customer base, we recommend the safer consistent approach.[/su_spoiler]\n\n[su_spoiler title=”I’m NOT a retailer, what’s best for me?” style=”default” anchor=”FAQ”]Do you live and die by sale events, or do you want more consistency for your business? Sale event advertising can drive customers, but it’s the “drug of marketing.” The more sales you have, the more advertising you need. However, if you want a steady, less fickle customer base, we recommend the safer consistent approach.[/su_spoiler]\n\n[su_spoiler title=”I’m having an event, how should I advertise?” style=”default” anchor=”FAQ”]Heavy advertising works best for event marketing. We recommend eight to twelve commercials a day for a minimum of three days prior to an event or major sale.[/su_spoiler]\n\n[su_spoiler title=”What about television and cable advertising?” style=”default” anchor=”FAQ”]Although a sometimes effective marketing weapon, producing a good commercial that doesn’t look cheap runs thousands of dollars, and buying prime time can cost hundreds of dollars for just thirty-seconds. Television advertising that is effective, meaning acceptable frequency and good placement on a popular network or program, can be costly.[/su_spoiler]\n\n[su_spoiler title=”What is Imagery Transfer?” style=”default” anchor=”FAQ”]If you have been running on television, use the audio from your TV ad or let us develop a similar copy, and benefit from “imagery transfer.” Seventy-two percent* of consumers will visually see your TV ad while hearing your radio ad at a fraction of the cost. It works well for AT&T, Budweiser and Coke; it can just as easily work for you. *Coffin & Tuchman, NBC TV.[/su_spoiler]\n\n[su_spoiler title=”What about newspaper advertising?” style=”default” anchor=”FAQ”]Newspaper is more of an information medium than it is a motivational medium. What is important to remember is that your potential customers will read, see, note, or associate you advertisement or message at a time when they are already motivated to buy, but seldom before that. Newspaper was great twenty years ago when we had the time to sit and read it everyday, but unfortunately, it doesn’t play as well in today’s mobile and fast paced world. Newspaper does not afford you the ability to target your customers, so it tends to be a “Spray and Pray” medium. Additionally, in many instances, controlling the placement of your advertisement within the newspaper can be difficult at best.[/su_spoiler]\n\n[su_spoiler title=”What about yellow pages?” style=”default” anchor=”FAQ”]Like newspapers, the yellow pages is primarily an informational rather than motivational medium. Place your business’s name in the consumers’ sub-conscious prior to opening the yellow pages, and the yellow pages just might work better for you. Most consumers say they would be more likely to call a business with a smaller yellow page ad that they had previously heard of, from radio perhaps, than an unknown business with a larger yellow page ad. Radio can prime your prospects with your unique selling position prior to ever going to the yellow pages, giving you the best shot to receive their phone call.[/su_spoiler]\n\n[su_spoiler title=”What’s a positioning statement?” style=”default” anchor=”FAQ”]All successful marketers use a Positioning Statement. A Positioning Statement separates you from your competitors, and reminds consumers of what makes you special. You can use your Positioning Statement in all your advertising (radio, print, TV). Just remember to keep it simple and be sure it focuses on your Unique Selling Proposition.[/su_spoiler]\n\n[su_spoiler title=”What is image advertising?” style=”default” anchor=”FAQ”]When you advertise image, you’re establishing TOMA (top-of-mind-awareness), and avoiding the “another sale” syndrome. Establishing your unique selling position with clarity, creativity and consistency is at the heart of image advertising.[/su_spoiler]\n\n[su_spoiler title=”What is branding?” style=”default” anchor=”FAQ”]Branding is establishing in the consumers mind your Unique Selling Proposition. It helps prospects understand why they should do business with you rather than your competitors.[/su_spoiler]\n\n[su_spoiler title=”How does a buying cycle affect my business?” style=”default” anchor=”FAQ”]We all have needs that create buying cycles. As a business owner, you want the consumer to think of you when they need your goods or services. A specific listener may not need an attorney, dishwasher, new sidewalk, or retirement plan today. But, what about those who need these items next month.or next year? Create your business as a point-of-destination in the mind of the consumer. When they have forgotten about your competitor’s ad minutes after they pass over it in print, you’ll be there to TELL them your story; with consistency, day after day. That’s how you create top-of-mind-awareness and that’s how to fight through a consumers buying cycle.[/su_spoiler]\n\n[su_spoiler title=”What’s a radio demographic?” style=”default” anchor=”FAQ”]It’s a group or cell of the population who listens to our radio station. Our goal is to match your targeted demographic (target prospects/customers) to one or more of our programs.[/su_spoiler]\n\n[su_spoiler title=”I tried advertising once and it didn’t work, why would it work this time?” style=”default” anchor=”FAQ”]Experience has shown that if you consistently follow the basic rules for successful advertising, your chances for success improve greatly. If you choose not to have a good game plan for marketing your business, or if you choose to break the basic rules of advertising, than your chances for success are not good. Our job is to assist you in developing a game plan and to keep you focused on your marketing objectives. That’s why we go through a regimented process that includes our marketing analysis, the assembling of an effective schedule, and development of great copy for your message. This process stacks all the odds for success in your favor. Our account managers are trained not to be good salespeople, but good marketers. Suggesting a campaign that does not work is as unacceptable to us as it is to you.[/su_spoiler]\n\n[su_spoiler title=”What is co-op advertising?” style=”default” anchor=”FAQ”]Co-op advertising is advertising paid partially by you and partially by one of your vendors. For instance, you may carry a new widget from Acme Company. Acme would pay up to 50% or more of your advertising bill for promoting their product(s) in your ads. Contact your vendors and ask if you have co-op dollars available.[/su_spoiler]\n\n[su_spoiler title=”What is cause related marketing?” style=”default” anchor=”FAQ”]ause related marketing is promoting your business through advertising, while at the same time, providing support to your favorite non-profit, organization, or event.[/su_spoiler]\n\n[su_spoiler title=”I don’t have a large budget, what do you suggest?” style=”default” anchor=”FAQ”]First, contact us and set a meeting to meet with one of our account managers. We can then determine if we can help you. We will also tell you if we can’t help you. That’s what separates us from many of our competitors.[/su_spoiler]\n\n[su_spoiler title=”What is drive time?” style=”default” anchor=”FAQ”]Morning drive is 6am to 10am, and afternoon drive is 3pm to 7pm. The other primary radio “dayparts” are mid-day, 10am – 3pm and evenings 7pm to midnight.[/su_spoiler]\n\n[su_spoiler title=”Should I advertise during nights and weekends?” style=”default” anchor=”FAQ”]It’s not always cost effective to “anchor” your commercials in drive time only. When our clients buy “TAP” (Total Audience Plan), their commercials run in all dayparts; including drive times. Attacking a night and weekend audience is a great way to stretch a small advertising budget. Think we’re kidding? Just think about the large number of potential customers you could easily influence who work night and weekend shifts in our area, or the potential customers that are running errands on the weekends (driving in their cars listening to their favorite radio station!). Plus, there’s less advertising during the evening and on weekends, which means your commercial has the potential to be noticed even more than usual.[/su_spoiler]\n\n[su_spoiler title=”Is there a charge for an account manager to meet me?” style=”default” anchor=”FAQ”]Nope. There is no charge to meet with one of our radio account managers.[/su_spoiler]\n\n[su_spoiler title=”What is a Unique Selling Proposition?” style=”default” anchor=”FAQ”]A Unique Selling Proposition is some feature or benefit of your product or service that customers and prospective customers can associate with your business. A Unique Selling Proposition distinguishes you from your competitors, and is yours alone.[/su_spoiler]\n\n[su_spoiler title=”Why is Digital Important?” style=”default” anchor=”FAQ”]\n\n• Fully Trackable\n\n• Wave of the Future\n\n• Tangibility\n\n• Informative\n\n• Where the Growth is Coming from in Our Industry\n\n• New way to Purchase\n\n• Gives Visual to Audio Experience\n\n• No Geographical BoundariesPortable\n\n• Changes the way we live our lives, the way we receive info, the way we interact/communicate with each others, and the way we conduct our business.[/su_spoiler]\n\n[su_spoiler title=”What is Social Media?” style=”default” anchor=”FAQ”]Social media includes web-based and mobile technologies used to turn communication into interactive dialogue between organizations, communities, and individuals.\n\n• Two-way place people congregate on the web\n\n• Immediate pen-pal\n\n• Digital meeting place information dissemination\n\n• Interaction Pictures/videos/posts/comments, etc\n\n• Way to communicate\n\n• Way to promote\n\n• On-demand\n\n• Portable\n\n• Some of the social media platforms: Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, Pinterest, Instagram, Google+, Tumblr, Blogs/Vlogs, Websites, Texting, Mobile Apps, Emails/Eblasts, Myspace, LinkedIn, Four Square, Flickr[/su_spoiler]"
