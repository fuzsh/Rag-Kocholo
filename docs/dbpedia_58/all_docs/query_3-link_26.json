        "text": "EDUCATION DIVISION\n\nThe Education Division began as the Education and Telecommunications Department. In 1999, it became Education and Interactive Media, and in 2000 reorganized as Community Learning Ventures under the Division of Content. Renamed Education and Community Outreach Department in 2001, it reformed as Education Division in 2004.\n\nEducational services to all Marylanders are provided by the Division through programs, such as community preview screenings; distribution of licensed content from other public broadcasting organizations; and expanded on-air and on-line information. For students and their families, educators, and schools, the Division develops programs with educational content. Division programs serve all ages and degrees of educational achievement, from preschool through college, as well as life-long learners.\n\nTo community organizations and schools, the Division's Video Lending Library makes available copies of quality programming and related discussion materials.\n\nThe Division directs three departments: Early Childhood Education Services, Educational Media, and Pre-K-12 Professional Development.\n\nTECHNOLOGY DIVISION\n\nFunctions of the Technology Division originated from the Administrative and Engineering Division from which the Technology Division was carved in 2004.\n\nThe Technology Division oversees the technical production of broadcast programming. At six transmitters throughout the State, it also maintains transmission and communications, and ensures that equipment and infrastructure perform around the clock.\n\nUnder the Division are five departments: Facilities, Information Technology Services, Production and Maintenance, Production Services, and Transmission and Distribution."
