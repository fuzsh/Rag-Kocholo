        "text": "Robert Lewis has been with the Radio Reading Network of Maryland since 1980 and has since served as its Volunteer Coordinator, Production Manager, and Board Member. Mr. Lewis is a graduate of the Maryland School for the Blind and feels proud to have the studio located on their Campus. He has a deep passion for radio and it shows through his work.\n\nThe Radio Reading Network of Maryland went on the air in July 1979, broadcasting from studios provided by the Baltimore City Community College. Known as Baltimore’s Radio Reading Service. We could be heard only in the metropolitan area. In 1991 our name was legally changed to reflect this growth.\n\nBoth the Internal Revenue Service and the Attorney General of the State of Maryland recognize the Radio Reading Network as a private, non-profit 501 (c) (3) corporation. Baltimore City and Baltimore County provide a measure of our funding. For the most part private Foundations, a few corporations, several service clubs and many generous individuals support us.\n\nA Board of Directors governs the Network. Each member serves in a voluntary capacity to fulfill a particular need of the Network; legal, technical, financial, public relations, etc. Together, the members set policy and see that it is maintained. Meetings are held quarterly. The paid staff consists of an executive director and office manager. Our Volunteers work with the executive director to broadcast readings over the internet. The Network broadcasts current newspapers, magazines and books to persons who are blind, have low vision or are physically unable to hold printed material.\n\nBelow are excerpts of an article by Laura Lefavor, that printed in The Baltimore Sun on Monday, April 28, 2013.\n\nAs far back as Robert Lewis can remember, he has been fascinated by what he heard on the radio — he would even sneak a receiver under his pillow when he was younger so he could listen to music late at night. Decades later, he’s still feeling that joy of radio. As the executive director of the Radio Reading Network of Maryland, he’s bringing it to others who need it: fellow blind people in Maryland.\n\n“I enjoy going to work every morning,” says Lewis, 63. “I’ve always loved radio, so I’m blessed to be able to come back to where I’ve started.” The East Baltimore native was born blind. After graduating from the Maryland School for the Blind in Nottingham in 1971, Lewis held odd jobs throughout Baltimore before being connected with the Radio Reading Network, which broadcasts news. Lewis has been with the network since 1980, and was named to his position in March of 2013.\n\nThe service aims to provide visually impaired people with the same access to information that others have. A team of volunteers read publications over the air.\n\nStarting out as a production manager for the service, Lewis was in charge of interviewing and organizing the volunteers. He even wired the entire radio room himself. “We don’t have Braille on the system,” he says. “I work on everything by touch and memory.”\n\nAs executive director, much of Lewis’ focus has also been on raising money for the nonprofit, whose funding comes from grants and private donations. In addition to adding online broadcasting to the network, Lewis is working on getting a grant to have younger readers come in to read children’s books. “I know things like that have already been read, but having a human voice to listen to that you know is there reading makes it so much different,” Lewis explains.\n\nOutside work, Lewis loves to play the drums — a 15-piece kit that he sets up himself. He has performed in Detroit, on cruise ships, even alongside Stevie Wonder in Baltimore. Even though he’s no fan of the “new garbage” teens listen to these days, he also takes time to give kids percussion lessons."
