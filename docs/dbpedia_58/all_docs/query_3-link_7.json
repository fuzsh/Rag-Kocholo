Apart from just tuning through every station and waiting to see what kind of music it is, I thought asking here might be helpful.\n\nI don't mind if the station is your run-of-the-mill \"plays the same songs over and over\" kinda thing - because most of the time I use my Youtube Music account. But not always and I hate hearing static when I turn my car on."
