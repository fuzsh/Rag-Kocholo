        "text": "May 25, 2009\n\nOn Memorial Day, No On-Air \"Rewound\"\n\nMAINE\n\nNEW HAMPSHIRE\n\nMASSACHUSETTS\n\nVERMONT\n\nRHODE ISLAND\n\nCONNECTICUT\n\nNEW YORK\n\nNEW JERSEY\n\nPENNSYLVANIA\n\nCANADA\n\nCLASSIFIEDS\n\nFROM THE ARCHIVES\n\nNERW SPECIAL: BASEBALL ON THE RADIO - THE INDEPENDENT LEAGUES\n\n*For the last decade, it's been a Memorial Day tradition for fans of classic NEW YORK radio: tuning in to WABC (770) or its webstream for a full day (give or take a Yankees game in the early years) of vintage Musicradio 77 airchecks, carefully reconstructed and introduced by legendary WABC production guru Johnny Donovan.\n\n\"WABC Rewound\" began in 1999, following on a shorter \"WABeatlesC\" revival the previous year. But as New Yorkers mark the Memorial Day holiday today, they won't be greeted by the Beatles and the Stones on their AM dials. Instead, WABC's new management is sticking with the station's usual talk format, even though the holiday means Imus and Limbaugh and Hannity and the rest of the station's daily lineup will have the day off, replaced by third-string substitutes or canned \"best-of\" shows.\n\nBut while there won't be a \"Rewound\" on the AM airwaves for casual listeners, there's still a fat package of vintage audio available for die-hard Musicradio fans, thanks to collector (and former WHN/WQXR chief engineer) Herb Squire and \"Rewound\" producer Peter Kanze. These rarely-heard airchecks, largely from the early '70s, will get played at some point today on the HD3 subchannel of WABC's sister station, WPLJ (95.5) - but most people will hear them as downloads from WABC's own website, where at least one hour was apparently mislabeled as of Sunday night, or from Allan Sniffen's tribute site, which was offering faster downloads when we checked.\n\nIs this curtains for \"Rewound\"? From all indications, yes - the airchecks that went into the 2009 edition were prepared (a time-consuming process indeed) when the producers still expected the package to air over 50,000 watts of AM. What's more, the pool of \"new\" vintage airchecks is reportedly drying up; what was fresh and long-unheard in 1999 has been ricocheting around file-sharing sites for a decade now.\n\nBut if this is the end of \"Rewound,\" it's at least going out with some very impressive airchecks, and the memory of eleven years of fun holiday radio in New York.\n\nTUESDAY UPDATE: The word from listeners in the market is that \"Rewound\" never aired on the WPLJ HD subchannel at all...\n\n*In other news from the city, CBS Radio's move downtown has shifted into high gear. WCBS-FM (101.1 New York) became the first of the company's stations to broadcast from its new cluster studios at 345 Hudson Street on May 17; it will soon be followed by WXRK (Now 92.3), with WWFS (102.7), WINS (1010) and WFAN (660) making their own moves in the months to come.\n\nOn the air, WWRL (1600 New York) is now picking up one hour of the syndicated Stephanie Miller show, from 11 AM-noon on weekdays.\n\n*Moving upstate, Mindy Barstein's WXUR (92.7 Herkimer) has been granted a significant boost in power - and a transmitter change that will get it much closer to its target audience in Utica. WXUR's CP calls for a power increase from its present 6 kW/299' to 6.4 kW/659', bumping it from class A to class B1, and a site change to the tower behind WKTV's studios on Smith Hill in Utica, where most of the market's big FM signals are already located.\n\nOver at Ken Roser's Utica radio cluster, Eric Thomas is settling in as the new morning man on \"Kiss\" (WSKS 97.9 Whitesboro/WSKU 105.5 Little Falls) after a high-profile arrival last Monday. As we correctly surmised here at NERW, the announcement that \"Kiss\" would be changing formats last week turned out to be a stunt - but the station's three hours as \"beautiful music\" and \"Whatever FM\" fooled much of the Utica media world, with the local newspaper and at least one TV newsroom falling hard for it.\n\nSo who's Eric Thomas? He comes to the Mohawk Valley from what may be the only market in the country with an even more blighted economy, Flint, Michigan, where he worked at WWBN (\"Banana 101.5\") and did some work in nearby Detroit as well. Thomas' arrival allows the rest of the Kiss airstaff to get back to normal: Jesse Jordan returns to middays, while PD Shaun Andrews returns to his usual afternoon shift.\n\nIn Gloversville, mark down \"WNGG\" as the new calls for Northeast Gospel Broadcasting's construction permit on 90.9.\n\nIn Syracuse, \"Love FM\" is back on the air at its old home of 105.1, now that Craig Fox and Sam Furco have returned that signal to the airwaves after buying it back from Clear Channel. The DeRuyter-licensed 105.1 returned as WVOA-FM on the evening of May 19; \"Love\" also continues on 103.9 in Mexico, now under the calls WVOU.\n\nDown I-81 in the Cortland market, longtime WXHC (101.5 Homer) operations manager/PD/morning man Sonny King lost his job early last week, the victim of budget cuts at the small oldies station. CNYRadio.com reports that King's career included stops in the 70s and early 80s in Johnstown, Amsterdam and Cortland, then at WBEN and WECK in Buffalo before returning to Cortland in 1986 at WKRT. King had been at WXHC since 1999.\n\nJust east of Rochester, Bud Williamson's construction permit for WMJQ (1330 Ontario) was close to expiration - but under a new FCC policy, owners of expiring CPs can sell them to qualified small businesses and get an 18-month extension to complete construction. So the unbuilt WMJQ CP, for 1 kW days/2 kW nights beamed north from three towers in western Wayne County, is being transferred to Texas-based 21st Century Broadcasting, headed by Norma Jean Lewis, for $60,000.\n\nMore Rochester news: Clear Channel's cluster is midway through its move out of its longtime home in the otherwise-vacated Midtown Plaza. Most of the station's sales and business staffers have moved across Chestnut Street to the former CBS Radio/Stephens Media Group space at the HSBC Building, and about half of the stations in the cluster, including big gun WHAM (1180), have moved their studios as well, with the rest moving over the next few weeks.\n\nAnd a former WHAM weekend staple, the Sunday \"SoundBytes\" computer show, has found a new home: it's now being heard on jazz station WGMC (90.1 Greece), whose GM, Rob Linton, used to be the SoundBytes producer when he worked at WHAM.\n\nIn Buffalo, Kevin Hardwick is giving up his Sunday \"Hardline\" political talk show to enter the political arena for real. The Canisius College politics professor is running as a Republican in this fall's race for the Erie County Legislature.\n\nDown the road in Little Valley, Randy Michaels' RadioActive LLC has closed on its $250,000 sale of a construction permit on 105.9 to the Seneca Nation. That amount roughly doubles what RadioActive paid in the FCC auction for the frequency.\n\n*For years now, listeners to \"NEW JERSEY 101.5\" have heard announcements promoting the talk station's simulcast serving south Jersey - but the latest home for the simulcast, WXKW (97.3 Millville), is apparently on the verge of a format change.\n\nInstead of \"serving South Jersey on 97.3,\" the station's listeners have been hearing announcements promoting the station's webcast and its main Trenton-based signal, WKXW (101.5). What's in store for the big class B signal on 97.3? Stay tuned...\n\nTUESDAY UPDATE: Tom Taylor of Radio-Info.com reports that the new format on 97.3 will be ESPN Radio, presently heard on WXKW's sister station WENJ (1450 Atlantic City).\n\nAt the other end of the state, federal agents raided two locations in Paterson on May 11 in an attempt to shut down \"Fuego 90.5,\" a high-powered unlicensed station that's been causing interference to listeners of New York's WFUV (90.7) for almost three years now. The FCC first issued a notice of unauthorized operation to operator Jairo Diaz back in early 2007, but its administrative process takes time. Diaz and Frank Rodriguez now face $10,000 fines for the unlicensed operation. And of course even with their station shut down (for now), that still leaves several dozen more high-powered pirates causing daily interference to licensed operators in the region, as the cats continue to be far outnumbered by the mice in this ongoing cat-and-mouse game.\n\n*At least one MASSACHUSETTS victim of budget-induced layoffs has his job back: Tom Cuddy quietly returned to the afternoon sports shift at CBS Radio's WBZ (1030 Boston) last week, five months after he became part of the big staffing cuts at the station just before the new year. WBZ's afternoon news anchors had been reading the sports in the interim.\n\nAnother familiar WBZ personality is about to resurface on a different channel. Longtime WBZ-TV (Channel 4) anchor Liz Walker finally parted ways with that station late last year, and now she's placed her new show, \"Better Living with Liz Walker,\" on WCVB (Channel 5), where it will be seen four times a year. The first installment will air June 4 at 7:30 PM, in the \"Chronicle\" timeslot.\n\n*Another HD-subchannel-on-translator update from Keene, NEW HAMPSHIRE: Saga's classic rock format, heard on the HD3 of WKNE (103.7), is still being heard via analog translator, too - but it's moved from W281AU (104.1) to W256BJ (99.1), the translator Saga moved south from Claremont a few weeks ago.\n\n*The founder of the CONNECTICUT School of Broadcasting is buying the business back out of bankruptcy. Dick Robinson had sold the chain of trade schools to a group led by Credit Suisse back in 2006, for a reported $20 million, and he's paying just $1 million to buy it back. Robinson plans to reopen only 11 of the 26 campuses CSB was operating when it went belly-up in March, and he says students who were left stranded by the closures will have their outstanding deposits and tuition payments refunded.\n\n*There's a new low-power FM signal on the air in RHODE ISLAND. WIGV-LP (96.5 Providence) signed on May 18 with Spanish-language religion from the Casa de Oracion Getsemani...and of course we can count on our pal Mike Fitzpatrick's NECRAT.com to come through with exclusive first photos of WIGV-LP's antenna setup atop the storefront church on the city's south side.\n\n*Meanwhile, one of a small handful of LPFMs in MAINE is in danger of going silent. The \"Lakes Region Weekly\" reports that WJZF-LP (97.1 Standish) may cease operations this fall if it can't begin to generate some revenue from underwriters or listener donations. Program manager David Patterson, who operates the small community station from his home, tells the paper, \"We have absolutely no listener support, no underwriter support, and the costs are just escalating to the point where we can't operate even a low-power station on our own.\" He says it's costing about $500 a month to keep the station on the air, and he's set an October 1 deadline to turn the operation around or go dark.\n\nOn the flip side, a silent AM has returned to the air under new ownership. WCME (900 Brunswick) has moved from its longtime site in Brunswick, still in use by erstwhile sister station WCLZ (98.9 North Yarmouth), to a diplex on the South Bath tower of WJTO (730 Bath).\n\nWJTO's owner Bob Bittner, who recently sold the WCME license to Wall Street Journal Radio anchor Jim Bleikamp, kindly sent along these pictures of Bleikamp putting the WCME transmitter on the air for the first time at its new home Saturday night.\n\nWCME is operating under special temporary authority from the WJTO site for now, with 176 watts by day, 55 watts at night, non-directional.\n\nEdited by NERW's own Scott Fybush - on sale now as an e-book or printed volume!\n\n*In Erie, PENNSYLVANIA, the days are numbered for WSEE (Channel 35)'s separate operation. Now that the station's off-air technical employees have been laid off, the CBS affiliate will close its studio at 1220 Peach Street on June 1, with its remaining staffers moving in with sister station WICU (Channel 12) at its State Street facility.\n\nThat, in turn, will mean big changes to WSEE's news schedule: starting next week, its 6 PM broadcast will reportedly be moved to 7 PM, with a new live 10 PM newscast being launched on WSEE's CW subchannel, \"WBEP.\" That 10 PM show will be repeated at 11 on WSEE while WICU does its own live newscast.\n\n(That schedule matches almost perfectly with owner Brian Lilly's other operation, WENY-TV in Elmira, which offers live newscasts at 6 and 11 on its main ABC channel, a 7 PM newscast on its newly-launched CBS subchannel, and a 10 PM newscast on its CW subchannel.)\n\nMeanwhile across town at Erie's other commercial TV cluster, a transmitter failure came at the worst possible time for Fox affiliate WFXP (Channel 66): just as the season finale of \"American Idol\" was starting. WFXP made it back on the air just before the end of the show, but it also received permission from Fox to rebroadcast the entire finale on Saturday night.\n\nAcross the state, middayer Jason Lee is out at WBEN-FM (95.7 Philadelphia).\n\nWhere are they now? Veteran central Pennsylvania broadcaster Chris Lash, who recently lost his wife Karen to cancer, is keeping busy by launching a new FM signal just outside Dayton, Ohio. Lash just put WYNS (89.3 Waynesville) on the air as \"Hybrid FM,\" playing a mix of AC and country.\n\n*One of CANADA's first expanded-band AM stations wants to move down the dial. CJWI (1610 Montreal, aka \"CPAM Radio Union\") tells the CRTC that it's being battered by co-channel interference from CHHA in Toronto and that it needs more power to reach outlying portions of the Montreal market.\n\nAs a result, it's applying to move to 1410, the frequency that used to belong to multi-ethnic CFMB before that station moved to 1280. On 1410, CJWI would run 10 kW by day, 1 kW at night.\n\nIn Ottawa, we've heard several reports of a signal test being conducted on 94.5 by Industry Canada, with an announced power of 2000 watts, presumably an attempt to find another frequency that can be shoehorned into that city's crowded FM dial.\n\nIn Toronto, it appears that Bob Magee is out as afternoon jock on CHFI (98.1).\n\nAnd in Toronto and many other Canadian cities, CTV opened the doors of its studios to the public Saturday for a nationwide series of open house events. The events were designed to do more than just show off the stations' facilities and star talent, of course - the real purpose was to push CTV's efforts to \"save local TV\" by compelling cable and satellite providers to pay carriage fees for local TV signals.\n\nBut while the open houses drew big crowds at CTV's Scarborough headquarters, the CKCO studios in Kitchener, the CJOH Ottawa studios and elsewhere, CTV's on-air lobbying for the carriage-fee proposal is drawing fire from a coalition of cable companies. They've filed a complaint about what they say is improper advocacy for the proposal during CTV newscasts. CTV, unsurprisingly, says it will challenge the complaint.\n\n*As we contemplate spending our Memorial Day afternoon at a Rochester Red Wings minor-league ballgame, we continue our ongoing look at Baseball on the Radio, 2009 with a quick trip around the independent minor leagues in the region.\n\nThe Atlantic League started its season a few weeks back, and it appears that two New Jersey teams have lost broadcast outlets since last season. The Camden Riversharks were on Rowan College's WGLS (89.7) last year, while the Newark Bears were on WSOU (89.5), but both teams appear to be webcast-only this year, as are the Bridgeport Bluefish up in Connecticut. The Somerset Patriots continue on WCTC (1450 New Brunswick), while over in Pennsylvania the York Revolution remain on WSBA (910) and the Lancaster Barnstormers are still on WLPA (1490). The Long Island Ducks have a weekend-only schedule of 66 games on WNYG (1440 Babylon).\n\nIn the Can-Am League, which starts play this week, the Sussex Skyhawks are apparently still on WDLC (1490) just across the state line in Port Jervis, N.Y., while the New Jersey Jackals are webcast-only, though they're running a low-power signal on 87.9 so fans can hear the call of the game in the stands. In Massachusetts, the Brockton Rox and Worcester Tornadoes have full-season (94-game) radio coverage, on WXBR (1460) and WTAG (580), respectively. The former Nashua Pride in New Hampshire have become the American Defenders, and appear to have no radio coverage this year. And up in Quebec City, Les Capitales may or may not be on CHRC (800); it's hard to tell from either the team's or the station's websites.\n\nAnd there's one more independent league with a presence right at the edge of NERW-land: the Washington (Pennsylvania) Wild Things of the Frontier League remain on WJPA-FM (95.3) for another season.\n\nWe'll wrap up our Baseball on the Radio coverage in our June 15 issue, when we'll have the radio lineups for the short-season New York-Penn League. (Go Muckdogs!)\n\nFrom the NERW Archives (Yup, we've been doing this a long time now, and so we're digging back into the vaults for a look at what NERW was covering one, five, ten and - where available - fifteen years ago this week, or thereabouts. Note that the column appeared on an erratic schedule in its earliest years as \"New England Radio Watch,\" and didn't go to a regular weekly schedule until 1997. Thanks to LARadio.com for the idea - and thanks to you, our readers, for the support that's made all these years of NERW possible!)\n\nMay 26, 2008 -\n\nAnother Philadelphia morning host is out of a job: after just over two years in mornings at Clear Channel's WIOQ (102.1 Philadelphia), Chris Booker was abruptly let go on Thursday. That leaves Q102 with no wakeup show, but perhaps not for long - the rumor making the rounds is that the next Q102 morning-drive entry will be the Elvis Duran \"Morning Zoo\" from sister station WHTZ (Z100) up in New York City.\n\nBooker, of course, has New York history, too: he did mornings on the \"Blink\" incarnation of WNEW (102.7) and evenings on WXRK/WFNY-FM (92.3). Will he be headed back to 92.3 in its current \"K-Rock\" incarnation? An unsourced addition to Booker's Wikipedia entry on Monday claimed he's signed a new contract there...\n\nOn the other side of PENNSYLVANIA, WEAE (1250 Pittsburgh) afternoon sports talker Mark Madden was off the air for a couple of days after some controversial comments he made last week about Ted Kennedy. It's not clear whether Madden's absence was directly related to the comments; the Post-Gazette's Bob Smizik, no fan of Madden's, has been putting some public pressure on ESPN to respond to Madden's comments through columns such as this one on Friday. \"Pursuant to our contractual rights,\" ESPN announced Tuesday that it has fired Madden; no permanent replacement for the 3-7 PM shift has been named yet.\n\nOne of the most famous stations in NEW YORK radio history is one that never existed. WVWA (900 Pound Ridge) was a late-night lark created by staffers at WALL (1340 Middletown) and some friends back in 1974. The \"Nine!\" tape they created was a pitch-perfect parody of the consultant-driven AM radio of the era, and in the ensuing 34 years it's taken on a life of its own, spawning a parody sequel (\"Ninety-Nine\") in 1999, a WVWA tribute website, a Tower Site of the Week in 2004, and countless jokes from those in the know. But now, all these years later, WVWA is about to become a real radio station, just a few towns north of Pound Ridge, yet. For this, we can thank Dennis Jackson, the independent-minded station owner whose Foothills Public Radio applied for, and was granted, a construction permit for 100 watts on 90.1 in North Salem, NY as part of last year's noncommercial application window. NERW can now report, exclusively, that Jackson has applied for the WVWA calls for his new signal - and that the original \"Nine!\" braintrust is already hard at work tweaking the old jingles and shouts for the station that's already being dubbed...\"Ninety!\" No, Bob Roberts won't be doing mornings, nor will Johnny West be doing evenings. Instead, we're told Dennis has \"refined, molded, polished, honed, shaped and pulled out of left field a revolutionary new formatic programming concept\" that will likely include a lot of jazz, as well as community programming.\n\nWhen will the real WVWA hit the airwaves of metro eastern Westchester (and nearby Danbury, Connecticut, where it's likely to appear via translator)? We hear it'll take a while for chief engineer Ira \"Carts\" Finkelstein to put everything together, but word is that the auspicious date of 9/9/09 may bring the latest chapter in the bizarre (but extremely fun) story that is WVWA. Stay tuned... (2009 update: Dennis subsequently changed the calls on his construction permit to WJJZ, then to WJZZ. But could there still be something \"Nine\"-related on 09/09/09?\n\nOn the NEW HAMPSHIRE/VERMONT border, Great Eastern is swapping formats at several of its Upper Valley signals. The \"Pulse\" talk format that had been airing on WMXR (93.9 Woodstock VT) has moved to WTSL (1400 Lebanon NH), consolidating the separate talk lineups that had been on both signals. The new \"Pulse\" on WTSL will also have an FM simulcast, as translator W232AP (94.3 White River Junction) has been granted Special Temporary Authority to simulcast AM 1400.\n\nThe move frees up WMXR to flip to classic hits as \"MAXX 93.9,\" also carrying Red Sox and Patriots games.\n\nMay 24, 2004 -\n\nIt was a quiet week in NERW-land...so quiet, in fact, that we're leading with a not-all-that-exciting stunt just down the road from us. WNSA (107.7 Wethersfield) dropped its weeklong simulcast of sports WGR (550 Buffalo) on Friday and began running a repeating loop of splashing water and cricket noises. A cicada invasion? Nope - it seems to be the prelude to \"107.7 the Lake,\" or so the local rumor mill would have it.\n\nEntercom has reportedly hired Hank Dole (late of WZBA Baltimore and KHHL Leander-Austin TX) as PD of the station, which we're hearing will be a AAA-ish classic rocker. Across town at Citadel, they've gone and registered www.107thelake.com, which was being forwarded to the WHTT-FM site for a while. What next? Stay tuned...we'll be listening.\n\nMONDAY NIGHT UPDATE: WNSA relaunched at 3 PM as - yup - \"The Lake,\" with a rather esoteric blend of classic rock and 80s pop and whatnot. First two songs: \"Swimming in Water\" by Peter Gabriel and \"Radio, Radio\" by Elvis Costello; subsequent listening has turned up everything from Traffic to Bonnie Raitt. New calls are apparently on the way, too, judging from the bare-bones Web site (1077thelake.com), as the station picks up the WLKK calls that lived for many years down the Thruway in Erie, Pennsylvania.\n\nIn southeastern PENNSYLVANIA, a widely-heard pirate radio station is off the air - and it turns out that \"El Sol 95.3\" was actually operating from across the river in Pennsauken, NEW JERSEY. It took a team of federal agents to do it - and when they did, they found the station being operated by a group called \"The Moors,\" who say they're not subject to U.S. law because they've lived here for thousands of years. (They showed agents a \"license\" signed by one \"Queen Ali.\")\n\nMay 21, 1999 -\n\nNEW HAMPSHIRE's public radio network will soon have a new link. NHPR announced this week that it plans to purchase WXLQ (107.1 Gorham) from current owner Gladys Powell. WXLQ has been running a satellite classic rock format of late, although NERW still vividly remembers hearing the station with satellite country a few years back, complete with odd little cueing tones where they shouldn't have been heard. In any event, the addition of the Gorham signal will provide a significant northern extension to the NHPR network, whose WEVO (89.1 Concord) goes only as far as the southern flanks of the White Mountains, while WXLQ's signal is heard only to the north of Mount Washington. No word yet on when the sale will close.\n\nJust up the seacoast in MAINE, Steve Mindich has applied for the WPHX and WPHX-FM calls for what are now WSME (1220) and WCDQ (92.1) in Sanford. Expect the WFNX simulcast to start any day now on the FM side.\n\nThe top story in MASSACHUSETTS is the nasty rivalry between Infinity's WBCN (104.1 Boston) and Steve Mindich's WFNX (101.7 Lynn), which started when WBCN began running the \"Loveline\" show, long a WFNX nighttime feature. Mindich was telling Boston papers this week that he plans to sue Infinity for breach of contract -- and he's also been making loud noises about the rumors (apparently started on a Howard Stern fan page) that Infinity will soon require all Stern affiliates to clear a 24-hour lineup of talk radio. WBCN PD Oedipus told the Boston Globe this week that he'll wager $104,000 of his own money against Mindich's money that the rumor is untrue. Meanwhile, both stations are running \"Loveline\" for the moment.\n\nOver at 116 Huntington Ave., \"Star 93.7\" unveiled most of its new jock lineup this week, with Ann Duran coming back to the region (after a stint in Los Angeles that followed the demise of the old WBIX in New York) to do 10-3PM, Michael Knight doing 3-7PM, Danny Meyers coming from WPLJ in New York for nights, and sole Eagle survivor Steve York handling overnight duties. Still to be named is a morning show. A note, by the way, to the usually reliable Dean Johnson at the Herald: the calls on that Lawrence-licensed station are now WQSX -- or is this just payback for the Other Paper continuing to call 93.7 \"WCGY\" for years after it changed to WEGQ?\n\nDo Worcester TV viewers want to see religious programming from West Texas? Beats the heck out of us, but it's there if they want it, thanks to brand-new WYDN (Channel 48), which began operating late last month from Mt. Asnebumskit in Paxton, rebroadcasting the \"Prime Time Christian Broadcasting\" network from KMLM (Channel 42) in Odessa, Texas.\n\nVERMONT's newest TV news operation is beginning to fill some key staff positions. WVNY (Channel 22) in Burlington named Eric Greene as main anchor and executive producer, as the ABC affiliate prepares for an autumn expansion to a full news schedule from the current 5-minute newscasts twice daily.\n\nOn the national front, pencil in a new name for Chancellor Media just as the company swallows all them Capstar stations. Now Chancellor is changing its name to \"AMFM\", to match its NASDAQ ticker symbol -- which might make more sense if it weren't for those rumors that the company is about to move its stock to the New York Stock Exchange, where it will be known as simply \"AFM\".\n\nFrom CANADA this week comes word of a new owner for Ottawa's CJMJ (100.3) and CFGO (1200). Rawlco, which sold its Calgary stations to Rogers earlier in the week, will spin the outlets in the nation's capital to the CHUM group, which already owns CFRA (580), CKKL (93.9), and CHRO (Channel 43/Channel 5 Pembroke) in the market. CJMJ's soft AC \"Majic 100\" is the market's ratings leader, and CFGO's new sports format makes a nice complement to CFRA's news-talk dominance.\n\nNew England Radio Watcher, May 26, 1994 -\n\nAfter an admittedly poorly-concealed courtship, American Radio Systems (WRKO-680/WHDH-850/WBMX-98.5 Boston) has agreed to buy WCGY-93.7/WCCM-800 Lawrence MA from Curt Gowdy for a reported\n\n$12+ million. WCCM will have to be spun off to meet the two-AMs to a market standard. ARS says it's looking for someone in the Lawrence community. As for album-rocker CGY, which uses 50kw from a 131 meter stick in Andover MA (20 miles N of Boston), ARS is saying there won't be much in the way of format changes...\n\nat least until they see what Pyramid (WXKS-1430/107.9) does with its now-finalized purchase of CHuRban WJMN-94.5. ARS is promising technical improvements to pump more signal into downtown Boston and the southern suburbs, where the CGY signal is shaky.\n\nThe other sale in the works is WMFP-TV Lawrence/Boston, the very independent Channel 62 that transmits from One Beacon Street in Boston, putting almost no signal over its city of license. Owner and former radio talk host Avi Nelson is selling out, in every sense of the term, to Shop at Home network. No more \"interactive\" video vaudeville...no more overflow for the NBC shows WBZ-TV declines to carry...no more MSTV public-domain '30s movies.\n\nYou can sponsor this weekly feature!
