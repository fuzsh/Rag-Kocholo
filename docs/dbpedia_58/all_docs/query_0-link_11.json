        "text": "RadioDze said:\n\nHere's an interesting webpage on grandfathered superpower FM stations:\n\nhttp://members.aol.com/jeff1070/fm-max.html\n\nWhile I didn't see it here, Rocky Mount-licensed WRVA-FM (while not a superpower) has one of the nation's largest FM coverage areas. I actually picked them up Wednesday night about a mile or two south of the Capital Beltway/I-95/I-395 \"Mixing Bowl\" in Springfield, Virginia..and very clearly at that.\n\nWhen did WRAL-FM drop their power to the current 96 kW? Might this have been around 1978 when the first 2,000-foot Auburn tower was built (the one which collapsed in 1989)?\n\nThanks for the cool link. The station referred to as having the biggest FM coverage area--KRUZ is now Cumulus' KVYB running 105-kw @ 2971 feet, HAAT. There is no doubt that this is the greatest combination of ERP and HAAT in the U.S. However, since much of \"The Vibe's\" signal covers ocean, as do the stations in San Juan & LA, New Hampshire's WHOM is usually recognized as the FM with the greatest land coverage--with a mere 48-kw @ 3746 feet, HAAT. Roanoke's WSLQ is damn close though, with 150-kw @ 1993 feet.\n\nWRVA-FM (the old WTRG) is really just a standard-issue Class C, running 100-kw at about 2000 feet. What you are hearing on I-95 is sort of an accident of geography. Harrisonburg's WQPO is a Class B on 100.7 that gets blocked to the east by some very steep peaks of the Blue Ridge. And, to the north, Baltimore's WZBA is another B on 100.7 that operates directionally to protect adjacencies to the southwest (100.3 & 101.1 in DC???). All of this gives WRVA-FM an \"alley\" of non-interference allowing the signal to go further than it should.\n\nBack in the early days of FM--before the dial got so cluttered--this was a common occurence with B-or-C sticks that hadn't yet become \"hemmed-in.\"\n\nAnd, swinging back to the original topic, the same might be said of the former 740/WMBL. It was on a Canadian Clear and had very few co-channel and/or adjacent channel stations around it to interfere. So, yeah, it went forever!!!!"
