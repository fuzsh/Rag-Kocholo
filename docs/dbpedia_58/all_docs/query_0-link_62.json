Located at 102.3 FM, the station is licensed to Babylon, New York and is owned by Cox Radio. The station is also simulcast on WHFM 95.3 FM in eastern Suffolk County. Both WBAB's 102.3 and WHFM's 95.3 are broadcast in HD. The station also streams its signal worldwide at [http://www.wbab.com/ www.wbab.com] .\n\nWBAB first went on the air in 1958. It simulcasted with [http://www.wnygspiritofny.com WNYG 1440 AM] , then called WBAB AM, until 102.3 FM was sold.\n\nWBAB is best known for playing AOR-style rock and is considered one of the pioneering stations in the country to champion the format. Heritage bands like Pink Floyd, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Led Zeppelin and Van Halen are heard on a regular basis. Newer singles include cuts by Nickelback, Daughtry, Green Day, and Bon Jovi. This music receives a fair amount of play as the station does not limit itself to a strict classic rock format.\n\nThe station consistently manages to secure high numbers in the Arbitron ratings for the Nassau/Suffolk market, which is known for its competitive nature. (New York City radio stations which penetrate well within market confines).\n\nIn the latest monthly Aribtrend Ratings for June 2008 WBAB is #1 on Long Island with 25-54 year olds.\n\nAir Personalities Past & Present\n\nPRESENT ON-AIR LINE UP:\n\n* Roger Luce / John \"JP\" Parise \"Roger and JP\"\n\n* Edward \"Ted\" Lindner News/Traffic on Roger and JP Show\n\n* Donna Donna - Middays.\n\n* Fingers - Afternoon/Evenings.\n\nWeekends/Swing\n\n* Joe Rock\n\n* Steady Eddie\n\n* Pete Rizzo\n\n* \"Jamie\"\n\n* \"Raven\"\n\n* Rocky\n\n* Matt Wolfe (Morning Show Board Op)\n\n* Fingers/Donna Donna alternate *\n\nPREVIOUS ON-AIR PERSONALITIES\n\n* Bob Buchmann - Now PD/On-Air at Q104.3 (WAXQ-FM)- New York.\n\n* Peri Appollo - Bob's first co-host and female newscaster.

The station apologized that same day in a news conference outside the station. [ [http://wbab.com/inside/pirate.html wbab.com: Inside wbab.com WBAB radio signal hijacked] . URL accessed on May 17, 2006] The investigation of this matter is ongoing.\n\nThe incident made the newscasts of all the local tv outlets that night and also the front page on NEWSDAY on Thursday May 18th with the Headline- \"JACKED FM\"\n\nRoger Luce the station's morning host said at the time \"Whatever that was- it was very racist.....22 years at this radio station- I've never seen anything like this\"\n\nNew General Manager John Shea- \"I've only been here a week and we get hijacked\"\n\nFormer Program Director John Olsen \"This was not some child's prank, this was a federal offense.\"\n\nThe same incident occurred a couple of weeks earlier when the same song aired on sister station WBLI on a Sunday night.\n\nThe FCC's New york Field Manager Dan Noel made a visit to the Cox Radio Long Island building on Saturday May 20th 2006 to investigate the matter, which has never been solved.\n\nPirate broadcasters identified as \"RED HOT RADIO\" on 102.3 out of Flatbush Brooklyn, broadcasting many hours a day (especially after 5pm and all weekend) formerly from an apartment complex on East 35th street and Avenue H plague BAB's signal on 102.3 in Brooklyn, Queens and Western Nassau County.\n\nOn November 6th 2007 the FCC along with US Marshalls made a visit to the Red Hot Studios and seized equipment. The pirate \"RED HOT RADIO\" returned to the air less than a month later from a new location where they continue to broadcast from today. There are about 30 pirate radio stations on the air in Brooklyn interfering with radio stations on Long Island and the Hudson Valley daily.\n\nCox Radio Long Island has warned that they will move to go after any pirate broadcasters interfering with the WBAB signal on 102.3 or 95.3 FM, as well as sister 106.1 WBLI.\n\nThe investigation and follow up from the FCC continues.\n\nRecurring Segments\n\n* \"Long Island Led\", a block of three Led Zeppelin songs introduced by Jimmy Page and Robert Plant.\n\nReferences\n\nSee also\n\n*Opie and Anthony - Opie met Anthony when Anthony submitted a song parody while Opie worked at WBAB\n\nExternal links"
