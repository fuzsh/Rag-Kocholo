        "text": "THIS SOFA HAS SEEN A LOT.\n\nCovered in an ancient damask print, the well-worn couch has been parked for years in the lobby of WMUC-FM against a graffitied wall plastered with schedules and concert flyers. It’s roomy enough for DJs working the graveyard shift at the University of Maryland’s college radio station to catch a nap before morning classes or for bands waiting to perform in the station’s “live room.” Its permadented seats and patinaed armrests have endured countless staff meetings, greasy residue from takeout containers and more than a few meet-cutes, its crevices a catchment for guitar picks, misplaced blunts and crumpled playlists.\n\nWMUC’s couch is one note in the soundtrack of Maryland college radio, but it doesn’t begin to capture all of its greatest hits: the station’s arduous road to an FM license; the indie singers and punk bands that graced its studios; scripts being lit on fire; countless hours of reporting historic elections, riots and college sports; and even a promo spot by a mop-topped Brit.\n\n“It was one of the fundamental experiences of my life, and I’m still close with a lot of people from that time,” says former DJ and program director Jay Kernis ’74, who went on to found NPR’s “Morning Edition” and “Weekend Edition” and now is a “CBS Sunday Morning” producer. “You immediately recognize your tribe—like, ‘Oh my God, these are my people.’”\n\nOn the 75th anniversary of WMUC—and with stations and listeners around the globe celebrating World College Radio Day today—Terp turned to decades of station alums to chronicle milestones and mishaps, culture and influence, and its enduring community.\n\nTHIRD RAIL RADIO // During the alternative insurgence of the early 1990s, record labels pitching the next Nirvana flooded stations like WMUC, with stacks of demos coming in weekly. With Washington, D.C., limited to a handful of venues like the Black Cat or 9:30 Club, bands looking to land a local show found an ally in WMUC’s “live room,” a bare-bones space that could accommodate an audience but also broadcast. Sporadic at first, it became appointment listening in 1996 when Eric Speck ’97 launched “Third Rail Radio,” a weekly in-studio music show. Over the years, “Third Rail Radio” has hosted emerging—and now established—artists like Elliott Smith, Car Seat Headrest and Mitski.\n\n“The week before my first daughter was born, my band went back to WMUC and performed a solo set on ‘Third Rail Radio,’” says former DJ John Davis ’99, curator of Special Collections in Performing Arts for UMD’s Michelle Smith Performing Arts Library. “My wife was there, who I first met at the station, and there was so much power to that moment: a little bit of sadness to one ending, but gratitude to the journey and excitement for this whole new part of my life about to begin. And it was cool for it to be happening in this place where so much stuff in my life happened.”\n\nSIGNAL BOOST // WMUC’s 10-watt FM signal was strong enough to reach only a few miles beyond campus. Also situated at 88.1—but 30 miles north—was WYPR-FM, another college radio station run by Johns Hopkins University, which was converted into Baltimore’s NPR member station in 1995. In 2006, the FCC approved WYPR’s petition for a 5,500-watt power boost and redirection south, securing a firmer grip on the Baltimore-Washington corridor and nearly snuffing out WMUC. “You could be in a dorm on South Campus right next to the station and not be able to pick it up,” says former GM Scott Maxwell ’09. In 2016, then-station manager Jane Lyons ’18 rekindled conversations for more wattage and a new frequency; with the help of state Sen. James Rosapepe, administrative adviser Steve Gnadt and the station staff that followed, WMUC eventually secured 30 watts and a new spot on the FM dial in 2022 at 90.5.\n\nLAUNCH OF DIGITAL // In 2008, station staff cobbled together equipment to transform the abandoned AM control room into WMUC’s first digital streaming station. New DJs now hone their chops on the digital station, rather than the graveyard shift, before graduating to a primetime FM slot.\n\nPUMPED-UP HIT // In November 2010, WMUC played “Pumped Up Kicks” by Foster The People, marking its U.S. terrestrial radio debut; it later spent eight consecutive weeks at No. 3 on Billboard."
