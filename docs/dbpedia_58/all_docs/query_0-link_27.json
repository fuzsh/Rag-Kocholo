In his FB post, Ghomeshi said he has always been interested in a variety of activities in the bedroom'' but only engages in '(s)exual practices that are mutually agreed upon, consensual, and exciting for both partners.'' Ghomeshi said he has been open with CBC about the matter and that he has never believed it was anyone's business' what he does in his private affairs but he wanted his bosses to be aware of the situation. He wrote, 'On Thursday I voluntarily showed evidence that everything I have done has been consensual. Toronto law firm Dentons Canada LLP says the action will claim general and punitive damages for breach of confidence and bad faith in the amount of $50 million. The law firm said documents would be filed on (yesterday) in court but did not elaborate. `Q,'' which launched in 2007, is also broadcast on over 180 NPR/PRI stations and syndicated in the U.S. READ FULL ARTICLE HERE\n\nMOTION: Lulu & Lala Fill Afternoons On HITS 97.3 Miami; KOSI Denver Shuffles Lineup - Jonathan Wilde Moves To Mornings; Dom Giordano Extends With Talk Radio 1210 WPHT Philadelphia; Kramer Takes Over Afternoons At WIOT/Toledo; Talus Knight Joins KKND/NOLA As PD/PMD\n\nTHE MOUTH, OCTOBER 28TH, 2014 –– Lulu and Lala take afternoons on Cox Media Group Miami’s HITS 97.3 WFLC FM, beginning Nov. 10.

Following this past weekend's New Orleans Saints win over the Green Bay Packers, they now have a chance to gain control of NFC South. This brings up their longtime rival The Atlanta Falcons whose lackluster 2-6 season gives the Saints great hope for them to keep this drive alive when they meet on the road.

Three nurses just walked into my room in full biohazard gear\n\nTHE MOUTH, OCTOBER 27TH, 2014 –– Cox Media/WDBO Orlando host, Joe Kelly, had become Orange County's first official victim of the Enterovirus D68, and now post a photo the station's website (R) of the hospital where he was admitted on Friday, October 17th. He blogs:I have been placed in an isolation ward. I sit alone, on my hospital bed, where sticky tabs and wires monitor my heart rhythm, an IV drip runs cold into a vein in my arm (see photo below) and I continue to breathe oxygen through the assistance of a thin, green tube connected to a shiny, metallic wall plate. I'm powering through hospital food, trying to recall where I've placed my urinal bedpan, wheezing, coughing and going through episodes of extreme sleepiness and sober awareness. I'm missing contact with my wife and kids, my friends from work and my dog. I even miss my dog. I knew that last Friday was going to be unique because I felt my body waking up prior to my already-early 2:30 AM alarm. I felt the nagging chills of a fever. No amount of hogging the blankets would satisfy my chills. I stumbled to the bathroom; fumbled through the medicine drawer and found the family thermometer. It was bad. 102.9°. As a two-time cancer survivor, that kind of fever is not acceptable. Compounded with the fact that I lost my infection-fighting spleen in one of those cancer battles, I knew I had no choice but to get to the nearest emergency room. Fortunately, in spite of my delirium, I was able to safely drive to the local neighborhood hospital and quickly find the ER. Within moments of stumbling into the ER, I was peppered with questions about West Africa and whether or not I've been traveling in recent days. The ambient noises of the ER fell quiet as other staff and patients considered the possibility that Ebola had just walked in off the streets of Orlando.' Fortunately, he said by Sunday things were under control. But the bloodcurdling-coughing and associated pain continues to this day, a full 8 days later (Sat. 10/25). He adds that he's looking forward to getting his appetite back, enjoying food again, being able to hug my children and my wife, and of course, getting back to work. Until such time, remember to wash your hands… like… 1000 times a day.

He added: \"People don't listen to stations, they listen to personalities.\" According to detroitnews.com, AM-FM stations face a tipping point as Apple CarPlay, Google's Android Auto, and in-car Wi-Fi hot spots fundamentally change the user interface in vehicles from radio to Internet. \"The center stack has changed from two dials and three buttons to very complex systems that contain so many different options,\" says Jacobs, vice president of Jacobs Media. \"The radio industry needs to work very hard to make sure radio remains vital in the car of the future.\" On the heels of its second annual DASH conference in Detroit last week, other broadcast operators weighed in on the topic: \"It's a much more competitive landscape,\" says Steve Chessare, who manages Detroit's WRIF-101.1 FM, WCSX-94.7 FM, and Sports Radio 105.1 — for Greater Media. \"It's more important than ever to create content that people want to engage in.\" Writer Henry Paine notes that every new generation GM vehicle will come with a Wi-Fi hot spot that will allow up to seven devices to connect directly to the Internet. Hyundai Sonata's will be the first car compatible with Apple CarPlay and Android Audio so that drivers can plug in their iPhones and mimic their interface on a vehicle's screen. According to Jacobs Media, half of radio listening is in the car, with that percentage increasing with each new generation. For example, 45 percent of baby boomers get their radio fix in the car compared to nearly 60 percent of Generation Y. One-fifth of cars on the road are \"connected\" via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi. With 90 percent of Gen Y drivers carrying a smartphone — versus 65 percent of baby boomers — in-car connectivity for new cars is a must.\n\nBoston Legend Dale Dorman Passes Away\n\nTHE MOUTH 27TH, 2014 –– Dale Dorman who began as a top 40 jock in the '60's & '70's 1960s and 1970s then later playing those same songs as oldies, died at home last week after a long illness.

He worked at KISS 108 for over 20 years and finished his career at WODS. \"Dorman is one of those jocks who made it big in the RKO chain of stations back when personality really mattered. Once the Morning Show host at WRKO in it’s top 40 heyday, Dorman also spent time doing West Coast top 40 (KFRC),\" KISS 108 wrote on its website. Dorman was inducted into the Massachusetts Broadcasting Hall of Fame in 2010. Dorman is survived by his wife, Linda, son, Scott, a daughter, Christina, a stepdaughter, Alissa, and their families. A public memorial service will be held at a later date, his wife said.\n\nWPLJ'S Todd Pettengill And 'The Smithereens' To Headline Concert For Man Killed By Gunman\n\nTHE MOUTH, OCTOBER 27TH, 2014 –– WPLJ 95.5 morning host, Todd Pettengill, will host \"A Concert for Brendan,\" to raise proceeds for the Brendan Patrick Tevlin.

According to The New York Daily News, last week a section of West 121st St. in Morningside Heights, near where the comedian grew up, was renamed “George Carlin Way.” That’s where Carlin, who was 71 when he died in 2008, lived as a kid. Corpus Christi Church, also on that block, had opposed the change. Carlin had attended the church’s school and often targeted it in his humor. It was 41 years ago that Carlin caught the attention of the FCC when a routine called “Filthy Words” on his album “Occupation: Foole” was played uncensored on NYC station WBAI on Oct . 30, 1973. The telecast led to an indecency case that the federal agency took all the way to the Supreme Court. Ultimately, the skirmish helped set government guidelines for what words are unsuitable for broadcasts. Carlin began as a radio host on KJOE/Shreveport, LA and later KDAY/LA before launching his famous comedy album which poked fun at his radio career in \"Wonderful WINO!\" LISTEN HERE\n\nNETWORKS: Westar Music Launches New Website; KVAS Portland Joins Envision Sports Nework\n\nTHE MOUTH, OCTOB ER 27TH, 2014 –– Envision Networks®’ Westar Music Library is thrilled to reveal its newly updated website at WestarMusic.com.
