Its new call letters were inherited from a police radio station in Tiffen, Ohio, thus TOP, Tiffen Ohio Police.\n\nAfter going through a number of format changes in the 1960s, WTOP Radio went to an all-news format on March 9, 1969.\n\nWTOP’s website, WTOP.com, launched in 1996.\n\nAwards\n\nWTOP has received a multitude of awards for its news coverage over the years, including the 2018 National Edward R.

Murrow Awards by the Radio Television Digital News Association, including one for overall excellence. In the Digital category, WTOP.com nabbed a regional award for coverage of 2020 news events, such as the summer racial justice protests and the coronavirus pandemic. WTOP was also recognized for coverage of the June 1, 2020 clearing of protesters from Lafayette Square. J.J. Green and Chris Core — hosts of Colors: A dialogue on Race in America — won in the Podcast category.\n\nIn 2019, WTOP received six regional Edward R. Murrow Awards: Best Newscast, Overall Excellence, Feature Report, Hard News Report, Podcast and Excellence in Social Media.\n\nIn 2018, WTOP received the National Association of Broadcasters Marconi Radio Award for News/Talk Station of the Year.

To be recognized with the Heritage Award, radio stations must have won a total of five Crystal Radio Awards for year-round community service efforts.\n\nIn the community\n\nWTOP has a history of serving its community, partnering with a variety of organizations including the Komen National Race for the Cure, March of Dimes, Make-a-Wish Foundation and dozens more.\n\nListeners can ask elected officials and community leaders questions directly on WTOP programs such as “Ask the Governor.”\n\nMission & Vision statements\n\nWTOP’s Mission Statement:\n\nDeliver high-quality, unbiased news that shapes our region and connects our community across all media platforms.\n\nWTOP’s Vision Statement:\n\nTo be the No. 1 news choice for our Washington, DC region by offering continuously updated coverage of Top News – 24/7/365.\n\nWTOP also has diversity mission and vision statements:\n\nWTOP’s Diversity Vision Statement:\n\nTo be an industry leader and set the standard for equality and inclusivity for all races, genders, ages, ethnicities, abilities, sexual orientations and religions by creating and fostering principles that integrate our core values.\n\nWTOP’s Diversity Mission Statement:\n\nTo be proactive in providing a welcoming, professional environment; free of harassment, discrimination and marginalization with on-going habits that incorporate our unique experiences into the overall success and continuous evolution of this organization."
