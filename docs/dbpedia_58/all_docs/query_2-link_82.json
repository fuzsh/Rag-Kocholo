        "text": "2024 National Preparedness Month\n\nNational Preparedness Month is an observance each September to raise awareness about the importance of preparing for disasters and emergencies that could happen at any time. This September, the Howard County Office of Emergency Management will be presenting \"Preparing for the Unexpected\", an introduction to the four steps of preparedness: Get Informed, Write a Plan, Build a Kit, and Be Involved. We want to give you the tools to be #ReadyHoCo!\n\nThis presentation will be offered on two occasions with one being virtual. Please see the dates, times, and locations below along with the link to register!\n\nIn-Person \"Preparing for the Unexpected\"\n\nDate: Tuesday, September 17th from 6:30 PM to 8:00 PM\n\nLocation: Harriet Tubman Cultural Center at 8045 Harriet Tubman Lane, Columbia, MD 21044\n\nLink to Register: bit.ly/OEMNPM2024\n\nVirtual \"Preparing for the Unexpected\"\n\nDate: Thursday, September 26th from 6:30 PM to 8:00 PM\n\nLocation: Virtually via Webex\n\nLink to Register: bit.ly/VirtualOEM2024\n\nOutreach Event Request\n\nIf you would like to request that OEM attend your outreach event, please fill out the following form: https://forms.gle/cuJ7stYaXMK8kMNr7. Please submit this form at least three weeks in advance. We will do our best to attend, but our calendar does fill quickly!\n\nBusiness Disaster Preparedness Workshop Series\n\nOur next Business Disaster Preparedness Workshop will be hosted via Zoom on Tuesday July 30th from 12:00 PM to 1:00 PM. Join us as Vashti Pyatt of the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) shares information, resources, and loans available from SBA following a disaster. To register, please go to https://bit.ly/4aQbD43.\n\nEmergency and Non-Emergency Notifications\n\nWeather alerts are available through a variety of mobile applications which can be found at www.weather.gov/enterprise/. The County's Office of Emergency Management (OEM) also recommends that every home have a NOAA all hazards radio for personal alerting purposes. Working with the Federal Communication Commission's (FCC) Emergency Alert System , the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) created an \"All Hazards\" radio network, making it your single source for comprehensive weather and emergency information. In conjunction with Federal, State, and Local Emergency Managers and other public officials, it also broadcasts warning and post-event information for all types of hazards – including natural (such as earthquakes or avalanches), environmental (such as chemical releases or oil spills), and public safety (such as AMBER alerts or 911 Telephone outages).\n\nYou can also follow Howard County Government on a variety of social media platforms, including Facebook and Twitter, through email service, and on-line at www.howardcountymd.gov.\n\nEmergency messaging will be done through geographic targeting landlines and cell phones using a system known as the Integrated Public Alert and Warning System (IPAWS.) This is for emergency messaging only, and requires no action to be taken on your part. IPAWS was created through a Presidential Executive Order, which required our nation to have “an effective, reliable, integrated, flexible and comprehensive system to alert and warn the American people in situations of war, terrorist attack, natural disaster or other hazards to public safety and well-being.”\n\nIPAWS only works on cell phones that have wireless emergency alerts (WEA) enabled, to confirm your WEA are enabled please check your service provider’s website (due to the many mobile operating systems in use there are too many options to post here). You can also follow the Office of Emergency Management (OEM) on Facebook, and Twitter.\n\nUnderstanding HoCo Hazards\n\nPreparedness begins with understanding your local hazards. A hazard is any potential source of harm or difficulty and may be natural or human-caused. High-risk hazards have a high likelihood of local occurrence and may result in serious consequences to life safety, property, critical infrastructure, the environment, and the economy.\n\nRisk = Likelihood + Consequence\n\nFor detailed information on hazard risk in Howard County please see the following resource or visit our Hazard Information Page:"
