        "text": "These mutually exclusive situations will be resolved through the application of a point system. Points are awarded for (1) the organization's presence in the community for at least two years, (2) a commitment to broadcast at least twelve hours per day, and (3) a commitment to provide at least eight hours of locally originated programming each day. The applicant with the most points will be awarded the construction permit.\n\nIf there is a tie after the points are tallied, the competing applicants will be encouraged to share a license. Those competing applicants resubmitting their applications together will be permitted to aggregate their points. For example, three applicants tied with three points each would be given a total of nine points upon resubmission. This aggregated group of applicants with nine points would be awarded the construction permit over a single applicant with three points.\n\nIf the tied applicants cannot agree to share a license, the FCC will divide equally an eight year non-renewable license term among the applicants. For example, if there are four tied applicants, each will receive a two year, non-renewable license term. The first license term will be awarded to the first to complete construction of its facilities pursuant to its construction permit.\n\nIf there are more than eight tied applicants, the FCC will divide the eight year term among those applicants receiving a point for established community presence. If there are more than eight applicants, the FCC will award one year, non-renewable license terms to the eight entities with the longest community presence."
