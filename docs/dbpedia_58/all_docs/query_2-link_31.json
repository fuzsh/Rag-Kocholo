        "text": "What We Did: Implemented a comprehensive restructuring of the Division of Operations team and realigned the Procurement Specialist portfolio assignments. This restructuring aligned procurement specialists with departmental needs, moving away from the previous model of division by service and commodity types. This change streamlined the procurement process and improved inter-departmental collaborations, leading to more efficient operations.\n\nGood Things That Happened: The realignment has significantly enhanced customer satisfaction by improving the speed, accuracy, and quality of procurement processes. It has facilitated faster turnaround times for departmental procurement actions and has fostered a more knowledgeable and skillful workforce. This structural improvement has also led to a reduction in wasted time, creating a more effective and efficient workflow. This not only benefits the internal operations but also positively impacts our client relations and overall service delivery.\n\nWhat We Did: Established a new office specifically for grants management to optimize the process of securing and managing grants. The Office of Grants Management is a vital asset in the county's efforts to secure necessary funding and ensure these resources are utilized effectively for the betterment of the community.\n\nGood Things That Happened: The Office of Grants Management generates efficiency in multiple areas. Among other things, it centralizes the grant application process, leading to more efficient and effective funding acquisition; ensures adherence to grant requirements, reducing the risk of penalties and maximizing fund utilization; expands access to diverse grant sources, enabling the county to capitalize on more funding avenues; facilitates better coordination among county departments for grant-related projects, ensuring cohesive and strategic use of resources; and leverages data to improve grant management and inform strategic planning for future funding opportunities.\n\nWhat We Did: Initiated a strategic restructuring to improve human capital management by transferring five positions to the Office of Human Resources and reallocating $332,500 in funds to enhance recruitment and training capabilities.\n\nGood Things That Happened: The transfer of five critical positions into the Office of Human Resources (OHR) creates a robust core, driving efficiency in HR operations. With a fortified staffing capacity, OHR is better equipped to attract top-tier talent and implement effective job classification systems. Increasing funding expands OHRâ€™s strategic functions, particularly in recruitment and training. Soon-to-be developed tailored training programs will ensure that our workforce is skilled and ready to face the dynamic demands of our mission. This restructure is a clear indication of our investment in our people, aligning our HR practices with best-in-class standards. By centralizing HR, we are not just reacting to today's challenges but proactively preparing for future organizational needs.\n\nWhat We Did: The Montgomery County Department of Transportation's (MCDOT) Engineering Division and Transportation Engineering Division have implemented two significant improvements to streamline their processes and enhance service delivery: implementing an electronic correspondence system and developing a residential response form. The electronic correspondence system allows for electronic signing of all division correspondence, where before approval processes were managed via email. The residential response form was developed to reduce the length and complexity of written responses to residents. The form uses checkboxes and bullets for comprehensive resident responses, replacing the need for lengthy emails and letters.\n\nGood Things That Happened: The electronic correspondence system allows efficient tracking and signing of documents, enhancing project controls and accountability. This system has brought about fiscal savings and improved performance in terms of speed and accuracy, while also increasing transparency. Notably, it has halved the turnaround time for document processing, leading to more efficient project planning and construction phases. The residential response form delivery significantly improved the speed and accuracy of public responses, and boosted customer satisfaction. It has been vital in managing the increasing volume of residential requests for studies and traffic treatments, which have grown nearly fivefold since 2018. Both of these improvements have been implemented at no additional cost to the County.\n\nWhat We Did: Executed a comprehensive business impact analysis and risk assessment across County operations to identify crucial systems and acceptable downtime. We upgraded our data center to a Tier 4 facility with superior security and resiliency features, repurposing the old center for backup. We enhanced connectivity and established robust network failover systems. Additionally, we modernized our storage and computing, significantly reducing our carbon footprint.\n\nGood Things That Happened: This initiative has led to a remarkable reduction in recovery times for critical systems, from hours to minutes. Our technological advancements have not only improved internal operations but also positioned us as a service provider to other jurisdictions, creating potential for new revenue streams. The transition to Equinix and adoption of Nutanix have realized substantial energy savings, contributing to our sustainability goals. By consolidating workloads and upgrading technology, we've dramatically reduced our energy consumption and vulnerability to cyber threats.\n\nWhat We Did: The Office of Community Partnerships within the Community Engagement Cluster/Urban Districts created the Translations Unit and established an MCG Employee Limited English Proficiency (LEP) Class. The Translation Unit provides translation assistance in Amharic, Chinese, French, Korean, Spanish, and Vietnamese to County Departments. The LEP class trains County frontline employees to efficiently serve limited English proficient residents. The training includes topics such as cultural demographics and linguistic diversity, language access requirements and resources, and effective communication strategies with LEP populations.\n\nGood Things That Happened: The work of the Translations Unit significantly contributes to making the County more equitable and inclusive. It reduces language barriers and expands access to services and programs for residents with limited English proficiency. The employee training improves customer satisfaction, increases accuracy in employee performance, and enhances employee morale. Overall, these improvements by the Office of Community Partnerships contribute to a more inclusive and equitable community, ensuring better service and communication for residents with limited English proficiency. These initiatives enhance both the performance of County employees and the satisfaction of the diverse community they serve.\n\nWhat We Did: The Communications Division of the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) implemented a media training program to improve staff skills in promoting programs and interacting with the media. Recognizing that staff felt unprepared for media interactions, DEP Communications developed a training plan to educate and inspire them. This program, classified as \"employee training,\" aims to better prepare staff for interviews and on-camera presentations.\n\nGood Things That Happened: The media training program has resulted in improved employee skills and morale. Since its implementation, staff members have expressed overwhelming support for the media training, with requests for regular repeat training. This has led to better preparation for media interactions, evidenced by four staff members being interviewed by local media to promote various programs and projects. The success of this initiative highlights the importance of effective media training in enhancing staff capabilities and promoting departmental initiatives.\n\nWhat We Did: Developed the Community Connect Application to streamline client transactions and improve program efficiency in the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS). This application allows clients to access services 24/7 through a digital portal, update records, track application statuses, and apply for DHHS services. Clients can directly input household information and upload documents pertaining to their requested services and both the information and documents are automatically associated with other service. This significantly decreases application completion time. Validation of information and communication with the customer will be streamlined through our eligibility system to the client dashboard for transparency and efficiency in application processing.\n\nThe second phase of the project will introduce features for residents to apply for major County programs, including health, dental, and rental assistance. It will offer multi-lingual (Spanish, French, Vietnamese, Amharic, Mandarin Chinese, Korean) access, real-time application status updates, and virtual assistance for users on the portal.\n\nGood Things That Happened: The application has significantly reduced the need for clients to visit DHHS offices physically, improving the client experience. The client will have real-time presumptive eligibility status feedback for all applications. The customer will also have a 24/7 dashboard access of all detailed outcome of all application results, including benefit approval status and coverage time. It has also allowed Case Workers to focus more on client service rather than administrative tasks, resulting in a more efficient case management process. These improvements not only enhance service delivery but also increase accessibility and convenience for residents seeking DHHS services.\n\nUnder Construction: The Community Connect Portal is a dynamic and evolving platform that promises to be flexible to the needs of the community. With that same focus we want we are launching the site in multiple phases to receive feedback from the community regarding the current site functionality. There will be a provider portal phase of this project that will be encourage a transparency of approved services and vendor payments and invoicing. The customer will see the services that are being paid to providers on their behalf and providers will automatically see the approved benefits the client is authorized to access their services. To name a few future enhancements:\n\nMobile application:\n\nTraining Videos to help with site navigation.\n\nCross agency applications such as Early Head Start, MCPS, REC\n\nMCares Vendor eligibility solution\n\nVirtual Assistant Staffing (FAQ and Live Help)\n\nWhat We Did: Expand the School & Community Youth Services (SCYS) by implementing the Bridge to Wellness initiative. The initiative extends mental health services, case management, and youth development support to 19 Montgomery County Public Schools high schools that do not have high school wellness centers. This expansion, approved by the County Council, included hiring a full-time mental health professional, a case manager, and a youth development specialist for each school. HHS staff diligently worked on updated budgets, staffing plans, referral procedures, and provided continuous support and training to nearly 60 new staff members.\n\nGood Things That Happened: The program has increased access to vital services for families and students in need. It is anticipated that the program will contribute to reduced psychiatric hospitalizations, decreased school absenteeism and delinquency, and improved family self-sufficiency. So far, the initiative has provided 8,000 mental health support sessions to almost 700 students. Furthermore, 88% of students receiving therapy for at least 6 months showed significant improvement or maintained their condition, and 97% of students surveyed\n\nTransfer Station Radio Infrastructure Installation and Upgrade\n\nWhat We Did: Installed a new radio communication system, including new radios, five repeaters, antennas, and a dedicated Wi-Fi network.\n\nGood Things That Happened: Enhanced operational efficiency and safety across the 52-acre site.
