Hardcore Maryland football fans will love every minute.\n\n\"Welcome to a very special episode of IMS Radio, one of my most favorite things we've ever done with IMS Radio,\" he said. \"We're going to be doing the all-time Maryland Terrapins football team, and who better to do that with than coach Ralph Friedgen?\"\n\nFriedgen, one of the most successful coaches in Maryland football history, spent hours with France to produce a five-part series that will run on Monday and Thursday this week and next, followed by the finale the following Monday.\n\nFrance: \"I decided I wanted to do this project a little while ago and I spent three to four weeks collecting data, going everywhere I could over the Internet,UMTerps.com, College Football Reference and and I asked coach, would you be willing to do this with me? And unbelievably, you said yes. And not only did you say yes, you said, 'If we're going to do this, we're going to do it right.' And so we have spent a lot of time going through the data, analyzing, moving people around and it's been a lot of fun.\"\n\nOn several occasions, Friedgen doubled back and changed a selection because he'd thought of another more deserving player. He played at Maryland and coached the Terps to their best run ever, three straight 10-win seasons in the early 2000s.\n\n\"You know, Larry, it's never gonna be easy. It's never gonna be [with] so many good players. Especially when you're considering different eras and different styles of football and different players, so we did the best we could.\n\nIn the first installment (watch on YouTube), Friedgen picks the top quarterbacks and running backs in Maryland football history.\n\nTo learn more about listener data and our privacy practices visit: https://www.audacyinc.com/privacy-policy\n\nLearn more about your ad choices.
