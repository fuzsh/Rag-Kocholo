        "text": "Radio is about more than a voice and a microphone. It is about connecting to an audience through whatever audio media platform you use, whether it’s traditional radio broadcasting, podcasting, audio documentary, or other media formats. Columbia College Chicago’s Radio BA program will help you recognize and create dynamic and effective audio content for the audio media platforms of today and tomorrow.\n\nAs part of your degree, you’ll work in a professional radio station, WCRX-FM in the country’s third-largest broadcast market. You’ll gain experience in podcasting, voiceover work for commercials, narration, and animation, and learn to develop engaging copy for radio promos, how to pace a radio story, or record an insightful interview.\n\nSupported by faculty experienced in the industry as on-air talent, voiceover talent, writers, production experts, and program and content directors, you’ll leave the program with a well-crafted audio media portfolio and be prepared to work in radio broadcasting and its related fields. Our alumni enjoy successful careers as radio personalities, radio talk show hosts, podcasters, voice actors, content managers and providers, radio station directors, and audio producers.\n\nWhat to expect your first year\n\nYou’ll take Intro to Radio to learn about career options in professional radio and other audio media industries. In the Voice and Articulation class, you’ll hone your diction, enunciation, and your ability to communicate effectively to your audience. In Radio Workshop, you’ll develop your on-air skills as a radio host and see the behind-the-scenes activities of a radio station. You’ll apply your knowledge in Radio Production I by completing hands-on projects, which give you opportunities to master audio-production techniques such as recording, editing, and mixing. And in Podcasting, you’ll learn about unique content creation that leads to a success podcast by producing your own work.\n\nWhat to expect your junior and senior years\n\nThe highlight for Radio majors is the Practicum, which you might take as early as the first semester of your junior year. In this course, you’ll work at our award-winning station, WCRX-FM, to gain hands-on experience working in broadcast media. You’ll learn to do the jobs of show hosts, producers, music curators, sportscasters, newscasters, production directors, and online content producers. As you focus on your area of interest in Radio, you can also concentrate on voiceover, radio storytelling, and club-DJ mixing. Because we’re located in a major media market, many of our seniors and juniors intern at local radio stations."
