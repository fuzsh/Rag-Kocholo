Learning​ Key Principles of Truth

​What are you called to learn? Victor will discuss three simple principles of learning truth that can be applied to our physical, moral, and spiritual realms. He will show us what to learn first and then how to go about doing it. You will hear his conversion story and how it helped him learn the first great truth everyone should learn - God is real and He communicates with us here on earth! Victor will also share some of his Hebrew and German knowledge.​

You will learn about principles of learning and how to discover them, how to listen to the spirit and some simple and powerful analogies. You will hear about a First Presidency message given early in 1978 that could change your perspective on church history forever. As we are called to learn truth we will discover how truth can make us and our children free.
