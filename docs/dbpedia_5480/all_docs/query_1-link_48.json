        "text": "After being baptized into The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints at nineteen, almost fifty years ago, a passion for reading, learning, and studying has distilled upon my soul. This was not always the case.\n\nHave you ever found yourself reading a book, and even turning the pages, to discover that your mind has been elsewhere? That was frequently me.\n\nAs a fifteen-year-old adolescent non-member, I preferred to read comic books. I almost threw away my first copy of the Book of Mormon because it did not have enough visual aids. Gladly, the Spirit of the Holy Ghost prompted me to open that book and read Moroni’s promise which was then prominently displayed on the opening page.\n\nMy interest in the Hebrew Bible grew after I joined the Church. In my personal journal, I talk about studying the great Prophet Isaiah as early as 1983, almost ten years after my baptism. While the writings of Isaiah and the Prophets have always held a special appeal for me, it was in 1996, while reading the Book of Mormon, that the words of our Savior sank deep in my heart:\n\n“And now, behold, I say unto you, that ye ought to search these things. Yeah, a commandment I give unto you that ye search these things diligently; for great are the words of Isaiah”—3 Nephi 23:1\n\nLearning of the Jews, My Approach\n\nSince publishing the third edition of Isaiah Testifies of Christ in 2017, I have continued to study Isaiah, but have been mostly focused on improving my Biblical Hebrew… in preparation for what I hope will be the fourth edition.\n\nAs we approach the study of the great prophet Isaiah in Come, Follow Me, and as I get closer to the fiftieth anniversary of my baptism, some clarity has come to me about “the learning of the Jews” (1 Nephi 1:2). What it means and how each one of us can obtain it.\n\nWe are all familiar with the many Scriptures in the Book of Mormon related to Isaiah and to the Jews. For instance:\n\n“I know that the Jews do understand the things of the prophets, and there is none other people that understand the things which were spoken unto the Jews like unto them, save it be that they are taught after the manner of the things of the Jews” (2 Nephi 25:5, emphasis added).\n\nThe words save it be jump out off the page. It is clear to me that the Lord, through His prophet, invites all women and men to delve into His word, not just His Jewish children.\n\n“Whatever principle of intelligence we attain unto in this life, it will rise with us in the resurrection. And if a person gains more knowledge and intelligence in this life through his diligence and obedience than another, he will have so much the advantage in the world to come” (D&C 130:18–19).\n\nThis, and other invitations to feast upon the word (2 Nephi 31:20), comes with a warning that such learning may lead to “look beyond the mark” (Jacob 4:14), priestcraft, and teaching of false doctrine. Lest we are discouraged by such a warning, I wonder if there is not a similar pattern in the Oath and Covenant of the Priesthood.\n\nThe Lord’s blessings to those who magnify the Oath and Covenant of the Priesthood are sublime (D&C 84:33–40), yet the condemnation to those who break it are ominous (D&C 84:41). But lest individuals prefer to avoid the effort altogether, there is a second warning wherein the Lord says: “wo unto all those who come not unto this priesthood” (D&C 84:42).\n\nSimilarly, with gaining spiritual intelligence. There are pitfalls, but each of us needs to embark in this lifelong love for the Scriptures. It is never too late to begin.\n\nPresident Joseph F. Smith warned against both the lazy as well as the proud who look beyond the mark:\n\n“Among the Latter-day Saints, the preaching of false doctrines disguised as truths of the gospel, may be expected from people of two classes, and practically from these only; they are:\n\n“First—The hopelessly ignorant, whose lack of intelligence is due to their indolence and sloth, who make but feeble effort, if indeed any at all, to better themselves by reading and study; those who are afflicted with a dread disease that may develop into an incurable malady—laziness.\n\n“Second—The proud and self-vaunting ones, who read by the lamp of their own conceit; who interpret by rules of their own contriving; who have become a law unto themselves, and so pose as the sole judges of their own doings. More dangerously ignorant than the first.”[1]\n\nHere we will address the learning of the Jews, what it is, and how to acquire it. We must avoid looking beyond the mark, which is a combination of teaching false doctrine and priestcraft. We do so when we cease to follow the Brethren or stop listening to the Spirit of the Holy Ghost.\n\nUnderstanding the learning of the Jews\n\nMy father was Jewish, my paternal grandfather was a Lithuanian Jew and grandmother a German Jew. My first cousin is a Rabbi. My mother and maternal grandparents are Chilean. At one point my DNA test showed I was 70% Jewish, which would mean that some of my mother’s ancestors from Spain and elsewhere also have Jewish blood.\n\nBut I have often wondered what the learning of the Jews meant. Does it consist of knowing Hebrew and other ancient languages, understanding parallelisms, chiasmic patterns, semitic poetry, the history and geography of Israel, and such? Certainly, all these things play their part, but there is something much more basic.\n\nThat is because the learning of the Jews is all about a culture of learning. Such a passion for learning is a gift and if we do not yet possess it, we may plead with the Lord for it: “… seek ye earnestly the best gifts, always remembering for what they are given” (D&C 46:8b). This is especially so if we seek such gifts in order to bless the lives of others and to build up the Kingdom of God.\n\nPresident George Q. Cannon admonished:\n\n“How many of you … are seeking for these gifts that God has promised to bestow? How many of you, when you bow before your Heavenly Father in your family circle or in your secret places contend for these gifts to be bestowed upon you? How many of you ask the Father, in the name of Jesus, to manifest Himself to you through these powers and these gifts?”[2]\n\nOne can fly over Yosemite National Park on a commercial passenger plane, on the way West towards California, and see the beauty of Half-Dome flying at an altitude of approximately 10,000 meters. The view of Yosemite lasts only a few minutes and then it’s over. It is majestic, nevertheless. We can also drive within small portions of the park and see exquisite views. Or ride a bicycle or a horse through portions of the park.\n\nThere is something incomparable, however, about hiking in Yosemite National Park, going into the backcountry, and only coming across one other party of hikers in a day. Or, climbing to the top of Half-Dome, with the aid of the cables, and then stand on the lip looking out onto the valley. It is a breathtaking memory never to be forgotten. You get the idea. Both experiences are uplifting but very different.\n\nIt took me four days of reading all day to finish the Book of Mormon before I was baptized. And in the process, my heart was softened, and my world changed completely. I gained a testimony of Jesus Christ in doing so. I called the missionaries of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and asked to be baptized. Now, it is taking me months to work through 2 Nephi. Even one line may cause me to ponder for weeks, such as “Wherefore, I know that thou art redeemed, because of the righteousness of thy Redeemer” (2 Nephi 2:3), or “and the keeper of the gate is the Holy One of Israel; and he employeth no servant there; and there is none other way save it be by the gate; for he cannot be deceived, for the Lord God is his name” (2 Nephi 9:41).\n\nIn last week’s Stake Conference in the Chile, Puerto Montt Stake, the choir rendered Rob Gardner’s “My Kindness Shall Not Depart from Thee” (Isaiah 54:10). While I had heard this hymn rendered by the same choir multiple times over the years, last Sunday it touched my heart so deeply that I had to find out more about this cantata. When I discovered that the theme was Isaiah 54, it touched me even more.\n\nMy Suggestions for Learning of the Jews\n\nI would suggest, then, that the learning of the Jews is this (1) passionate intensity filled with questions, coupled (2) with a linger longer with the Scriptures. As Latter-Day Saints, we do all this with a prayer in our hearts and the help of the Holy Ghost as our comforter, teacher, and guide.\n\nThe first thing I learned when I began the study of Isaiah in earnest, was that this labor would be demanding. Like Oliver Cowdery, I had erroneously supposed that all I had to do was ask. When Oliver could not carry out the work of translation, the Lord taught all of us, “Behold, you have not understood; you have supposed that I would give it unto you when you took no thought save it was to ask me” (D&C 9:7).\n\nElder B. H. Roberts taught that “It requires striving—intellectual and spiritual—to comprehend the things of God—even the revealed things of God. In no department of human endeavor is the aphorism ‘no excellence without labor’—more in force than in acquiring knowledge of the things of God. The Lord has placed no premium upon idleness or indifference here … the truth here contended for—achievement in divine things, progress in the knowledge of them, comes only with hard striving, earnest endeavor, determined seeking.”[3]\n\nFor the first several chapters of Isaiah, I kept telling myself. “I will never understand this chapter.” Yet eventually I would get an understanding of sorts. With time I changed my notion to: “This chapter is just as hard as the ones I have completed, yet with work and God’s help I will, in time, come to an understanding.” That attitude is the learning of the Jews.\n\nTowards the end of the project, I was surprised when the Lord revealed to me what one of the chapters was all about before I had put in the effort to understand. This is what I had originally supposed would happen for the whole book. But the Lord wanted me to climb Half-Dome and not just fly over it. But through this tender mercy, He also wanted to tell me that He was pleased with my efforts.\n\nAt first, it was taking me seven months to complete each chapter. Not only did I compare each verse in the King James Version to dozens of other Bible translations, but I studied the words of the Brethren, examined the writings of the Jews and of fellow Christians from other denominations; I compared each verse to the English translations of multiple ancient languages, and even tried to get into the original Hebrew when needed.\n\nScripture study is much like entering a room and finding that there are adjoining doors and windows that offer additional insights. And those new rooms have yet more doors and windows, and so on.\n\n“For precept must be upon precept, precept upon precept; line upon line, line upon line; here a little, and there a little” (Isaiah 28:10). The scriptures seem to form one eternal round.\n\nAnd yes, I often wondered what this “learning of the Jews” was all about and considered it a curiosity. I had to work very hard for every little bit of knowledge. Only did it dawn on me this week that it was through this effort that I was acquiring the learning of the Jews. And that now I am applying this same approach to my study of the Book of Mormon and other Scriptures.\n\nAny gift we receive, we must work hard to fully develop and take advantage of. We need to seek the constant companionship of the Holy Ghost in the endeavor, most especially when it has to do with the study of the Word.\n\n[1] Widtsoe, John A, and Smith, Joseph F.

Fifth year, p. iv.\n\nA companion to your Come, Follow Me study of Isaiah\n\nIsaiah 13-14— Babylon will Fall\n\nChapters 13 and 14 are the first in a series, (which ends with Chapter 23), of prophecies warning nine ancient nations of their impending doom. But Chapters 13 and 14 both focus on Babylon, which is a ‘type’ or symbol of the world we live in. And these two chapters in this series, are the only two quoted in the Book of Mormon.\n\nMonte Nyman explains: “There is undoubtedly a dual message within them. The basic message is against the old Babylon, which existed before Isaiah’s time and became a world power under King Nebuchadnezzar after Assyria’s downfall and after the ministry of Isaiah.\n\n“Babylon became the epitome of wickedness in the ancient world, and was used in both the New Testament and the Doctrine and Covenants as the symbol of the wicked world (see Revelation 14:8; D&C 133:14). Thus a greater message is to modern-day Babylon, the wickedness of our world. It is often difficult to know which Babylon the text is referring to, and it may be that sometimes it refers to both at the same time.”[1]\n\nIsaiah 24–27—The Apocalypse of Isaiah\n\nIsaiah 24–27 expands the prophecies of individual nations found in Isaiah 13–23 to include the whole earth. And the Earth, explain Shon Hopkin and And Madsen, will be “profoundly affected by the wickedness of its inhabitants. The events described [in these chapters] will be universal. Neither wealth and power nor poverty and obscurity will allow anyone to escape.”[2]\n\nThese chapters also demonstrates Isaiah’s seership, as he records things not chronicled before his ministry. In fact, as Victor Ludlow explains, these chapters establish him as a “great seer” recording, “a cycle of prophecies that has no parallel in the writings of earlier Old Testament prophets.” However after his ministry, those prophets that follow (Daniel, Zechariah, and John the Revelator), reiterate many of his themes.\n\nIn these chapters, Isaiah “sees Isaiah 24–27.”[3] Sometimes chapters 24–27 are referred to as “the Apocalypse of Isaiah..”[4] Chapters 24 and 25 are contrastive as 24 tells of coming destruction and sadness, while 25 promises times of new life and gladness.\n\nAnd these chapters, Isaiah is not only acting as a prophet and seer, but he also exercises his poetic skill. Again from Ludlow, “…as a prophet he warns and testifies of the consequences of wickedness; as a seer, he reveals future events upon this earth and spiritual developments in the post-earthly spirit world; as a poet, he combines semantic parallelism, sound, repetitions, and symbolism to memorably portraying the condition of the earth in the last days.”[5]\n\nIsaiah 29 — A Voice from the Dust\n\nUnlike the previous chapters, in 2 Nephi 26–27, John Bytheway points out that, in quoting Isaiah 29, Nephi “likened” or applied passages this chapter “concerning the destruction of Jerusalem to the destruction of his own people in the Americas. It also appears that Nephi interjected his own commentary among the words of Isaiah. While Nephi applied certain Isaiah passages concerning the inhabitants of Judah to his own people, Isaiah clearly saw events specific to the latter days.”[6]\n\nIn this chapter, “Isaiah foretells the coming forth of the Book of Mormon, the visit of Martin Harris to Charles Anthon, the three witnesses, and other events of the Restoration. The prophet Isaiah is a wonderful Old Testament witness of the coming forth of the Book of Mormon.”[7]\n\nIsaiah 30 and 35—Further Warnings\n\nAccording to Monte Nyman, “Chapters 30 through 35 present the last three of the six ‘woes’” that began back in Isaiah chapter 28. “These three warnings appear to be based on actual historical incidents …The first warning speaks against trusting the wisdom of man, and the second against trusting the power of man, as shown in the following outline.”[8]\n\nIn his book, Isaiah Testifies of Christ, Gregorio Billikopf, reminds us that the focus of Isaiah 35 is embodied in the 10th Article of Faith, which states:\n\n“A substantial portion of this Article of Faith,” writes Billikopf, “is covered in Isaiah 35—and even more so when we consider Isaiah 35’s parallel text, D&C 133. This glorious chapter of Isaiah gives the blossoming of the Utah desert as a rose—along with other attendant blessings—as a type of the Earth being converted into its paradisiacal gory in the millennium.\n\n“From Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith: ‘The land of America is a promised land unto [the descendants of Joseph], and unto it, all the tribes of Israel will come, with as many of the Gentiles as shall comply with the requisitions of the new covenant. But the tribe of Judah will return to old Jerusalem, The City of Zion spoken of by David in the 102nd Psalm will be built upon the Land of America. And the ransomed of the Lord shall return, and come to Zion with songs and everlasting joy upon their heads.’ (Isaiah 35:10); and then they will be delivered from the overflowing scourge that shall pass through the land. But Judah shall obtain deliverance at Jerusalem. See Joel 2:32; ISAIAH 26:20–21; Jeremiah 31:12; Psalm 1:5; 10.\n\n“The testimonies that the Good Shepherd will put forth His own sheep, and lead them out from all nations where they have been scattered in a cloudy and dark day, to Zion, and to Jerusalem; besides many more testimonies which might be brought.\n\n“Elder Orson Pratt taught: ‘I say those who will travel through this Territory [Utah] may see some of the effects of the gathering out of the Saints who have made a covenant with the Lord by sacrifice. If we had gathered together into a country that was well timbered, where we could go out and get a load of fence poles or firewood before breakfast; if we had settled in a country that was not, comparatively a desert, and that was blessed with the rains of heaven, we could no doubt have accomplished far more than we now see. But the Lord purposely led us into this desert to fulfill prophecy.’ (Pratt, Elder Orson, JD 15:57-58). Horsley says that this chapter relates to the ‘final triumph of the Church over the apostate factions.’.[9]\n\nSince the published Old Testament Reading Schedule doesn’t include every chapter in the Book of Isaiah our team has not curated all resources from our site.

Why are they launching a billboard campaign on September 23rd along I-15 in Salt Lake and Utah County? How do they hope to accomplish their purpose? And most important, so what?\n\nWho is SearchIsaiah.org?\n\nLike you, we also have a lot of questions. We are a group of writers, artists, videographers, social media marketers, and entrepreneurs with the vision to help members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints search the book of Isaiah.\n\nBut it’s not about us. It’s about all of us. It’s honestly about Isaiah; probably the hardest book to understand in all of scripture.\n\nNone of us are scholars with any real background in academics, but we deeply value learning. We are reaching out for help from those who have invested their life in studying this complex book. We are looking for truth, and we don’t have a lot of time. None of us do, we are all busy.\n\nWe aren’t selling anything, at least nothing yet. But we do hope a lot of books from these authors and scholars get sold. (We hope to help this along a bit.) We aren’t in this for money, in fact, any profits from our work will go right back into this cause, and others.\n\nOne of the first questions we asked was, is it just us, or are there a lot of natural disasters and crazy things happening lately? And sorry to tell you, we aren’t evangelicals calling the LDS people to repentance, or doomsday people out on the fringe, far from it. We are probably on the edge though, after all, look at the lengths we went just to start this conversation with you. We are normal folks from here or right around here. You will laugh when you finally figure out who we are.\n\nThe most important who is you. We want feedback, questions, and ideas.\n\nWhat is SearchIsaiah.org?\n\nWe hope the name of the website explains it best. We want you to join us as we search Isaiah for answers together.\n\nLet’s mention some ground rules. We need to be civil and unified as we search for truth. That may be wishful thinking. The trolls and lurkers may swarm us, that’s ok. But here’s the deal, you need to come out from under your bridge and be who you are. Identify yourself in the light of day. Engage in real conversation. Be thoughtful. Let us all try to be our better selves.\n\nWe hope to see into the future, decipher what’s happening today, and understand the past.\n\nIn fact, that’s probably the first key to Isaiah.\n\nHe seemed to have an amazing knack for choosing types and shadows from his day, to prophecy about our day. The assumption is what happened back then is a pattern of what happens now, to us. Now that’s compelling.\n\nWhat if the whole book of Isaiah is written just for us? What if it was coded and hidden in a way to survive for thousands of years, perfectly intact, for this exact time, this very day.\n\nWhen is SearchIsaiah.org launching?\n\nSo why launch on September 23rd?\n\nHave you googled it? It’s all over the web… how the constellation Virgo is going through labor pains to deliver a man-child, and then some crazy things start happening. This same configuration amongst the stars hasn’t happened for thousands of years.\n\nMany on the web say it aligns exactly with Revelations 12, verses 1 and 2. Joseph Smith upped the ante, even changed the order a bit, moved verse 5 up to verse 3 and combined some things. But, you say, that’s Revelation, we are talking Isaiah. We thought so too.\n\nThen we found Isaiah 66:7.\n\nWow!\n\nDoes God speak to us through the alignment and rotation of planets and stars put in place millions or thousands of years ago? The odds of that thought are so enormous it blows circuits in our brain. But if there’s a God… it’s easy. It’s what He does. If there isn’t a God, it’s crazy even to think.\n\nWhy SearchIsaiah.org?\n\nIn 2 Nephi Chapter 14, Nephi says he saw our day, the last days, just like John the Revelator saw. He seemed almost desperate to tell us everything he could as plain as he could… to warn us. But he was forbidden to tell us more.\n\nSo what did he do?\n\nHe quoted Isaiah. Tons of Isaiah. And so did his brother Jacob.\n\nBut do you want to know the real reason we are doing this?\n\nChrist himself said that we ought to search these things. In fact, he said in 3 Nephi 23:1, that it is a commandment for us to search these things diligently; for great are the words of Isaiah.\n\nWe can’t find that about any other book… anywhere. It must be important.\n\nFull Disclosure: If it isn’t obvious, Jesus Christ matters to us. What He says matters to us.\n\nNext question.\n\nHow are we promoting SearchIsaiah.org?\n\nWe didn’t want to be hypocrites, so we have been searching pretty diligently ourselves.\n\nAnd we tested what to put on our billboards. Marketers do that. How? With Facebook. We tested what we said, what colors to use, what fonts… you get the picture. Results went up 400%.\n\nWe tested humor; jokes about Isaiah. Surprisingly, they didn’t work so well. We quickly figured out Isaiah isn’t very funny… or fun. We hope to change that.\n\nDoes Isaiah have answers that matter? We sure think so. Join us and let’s find out together.\n\nThe Book of Mormon doesn’t just include Isaiah’s words, it unlocks their deeper meaning. Both Christ and Moroni urged readers to “search them.” Why? By understanding how the Book of Mormon quotes and interprets Isaiah, we gain context, relevance, personal application, and a springboard to delve deeper into his rich prophecies. See Isaiah through the Book of Mormon’s lens and discover new clarity and meaning.\n\nIn their teachings, Book of Mormon prophets like Nephi, Jacob, and Abinadi, along with the resurrected Savior himself, frequently drew upon the words of Isaiah. Examining both their justifications for doing so and the chosen passages from Isaiah, we discover four key themes that their use of Isaiah emphasized:\n\nRepentance and Divine Judgment: Isaiah’s warnings about God’s response to sin resonated with these prophets, serving as a call to repentance for their people.\n\nCovenants and Promises to Israel: Isaiah’s prophecies about God’s enduring promises to the house of Israel offered hope and reassurance to these prophets and their communities.\n\nMessianic Prophecies: The Book of Mormon prophets found powerful support for their messianic teachings in Isaiah’s pronouncements about the coming Messiah.\n\nEvents of the Latter Days: Isaiah’s visions of the future resonated with the prophets’ understanding of their times as the “latter days,” prompting them to share his insights with their people.\n\nRepentance and Divine Judgment\n\nProphecy’s core function is to urge repentance and reveal God’s judgments. Nephi, understanding this, included Isaiah’s words in 2 Nephi 12-24. His aim, as he stated in 2 Nephi 25:3, was “that all those that shall receive hereafter these things… may know the judgments of God.”\n\nIsaiah implores Israel and other nations to repent and seek the Lord throughout his book. Nephi incorporated these passages to warn his people, the Lamanites, the Jews, and future Gentiles. He included, for example:\n\nJudah and Jerusalem: Isaiah 2:1-5:30 and 2 Nephi 12:1-15:30 prophesied repentance and impending judgment.\n\nSyria and Ephraim: Isaiah 7 and 2 Nephi 17 offer similar warnings.\n\nSyria: Isaiah 10 and 2 Nephi 20 reiterate this theme.\n\nBabylon: Isaiah 13-14 and 2 Nephi 23-24 deliver further pronouncements.\n\nDuring Isaiah’s lifetime, his prophecies of destruction against Syria, Ephraim, and Assyria came to pass. Jerusalem’s destruction followed in Nephi’s own time, which Nephi saw in his vision after arriving in the promised land. By including these fulfilled prophecies, Nephi likely intended to demonstrate to both his people and future readers the certainty of Isaiah’s remaining pronouncements about the future and his prophetic call to repentance by all people.\n\nCovenants and Promises to Israel\n\nThe Book of Mormon, as its title page declares, aims to teach “the remnant of the house of Israel” about God’s covenants. Within its pages, Isaiah’s writings stand out as a powerful voice echoing this theme.\n\nProphets like Nephi and Jacob urged their people to heed Isaiah’s words, specifically addressed to “all the house of Israel” (1 Nephi 19:24; 2 Nephi 6:55). They saw a mirror reflecting their challenges and destinies in Isaiah’s pronouncements.\n\nFor instance, Nephi quoted Isaiah 48 (1 Nephi 20), reminding his people of God’s promise to hold back his wrath and gather them even after their apostasy (1 Nephi 20:9, 11). He also turned to Isaiah 49 (1 Nephi 21) to highlight the glorious future awaiting Israel, including their gathering (1 Nephi 21:8-14). These messages resonated deeply as they embarked on a new journey in a new land (1 Nephi 22:7-12).\n\nYears later, Jacob echoed this focus, citing Isaiah 50 and 51 (2 Nephi 7-8) to illuminate God’s enduring covenants with Israel (2 Nephi 9:1). Centuries later, the resurrected Savior himself quoted Isaiah 52 and 54 (3 Nephi 15:1-17:3; 20:10-23:5) in major discourses about his covenants. He declared, “Then is the fulfilling of the covenant” (3 Nephi 20:12, 46), linking Isaiah’s prophecies directly to the fulfillment of God’s promises.\n\nMessianic Prophecies\n\nNephi and Abinadi, two powerful Book of Mormon witnesses of Christ, both drew heavily on the writings of Isaiah to bolster their testimonies.\n\nNephi’s Burning Desire to Witness Christ to His Readers\n\nDriven by a desire to “more fully persuade his people to believe in the Lord their redeemer” (1 Nephi 19:23), Nephi saw Isaiah’s words as a potent tool. Having himself seen the Lord (2 Nephi 11:2-3), he sought to link his testimony with that of Isaiah and his brother Jacob, who had also seen the Savior, fulfilling the principle that “by the words of three, God hath said, I will establish my word” (2 Nephi 11:3). He declared, “My soul delighteth in his words” (2 Nephi 11:2), finding joy in sharing them to prove the coming of Christ and ignite hope in his people (2 Nephi 11:4, 8).\n\nAbinadi’s Powerful Witness of Christ\n\nSimilarly, Abinadi, facing King Noah and his wicked priests, employed Isaiah’s profound “suffering servant song” (Isaiah 53) to illustrate Christ’s role as intercessor (Mosiah 14-15). His inspired insights unlock deeper understanding for Book of Mormon readers, revealing how Christ fulfills Isaiah’s prophecies.\n\nPrelude to Nephi’s Grand Testimony\n\nBeyond Abinadi’s specific use of Isaiah 53, Nephi quoted extensively from chapters 6-9 and 11 (2 Nephi 16-19, 21), building a powerful messianic foundation. These passages served as a prelude to His grand testimony of Christ in 2 Nephi 25 and 31-33, leaving no doubt about the Savior’s central role in God’s plan.\n\nEvents of the Latter Days\n\nBeyond bolstering their Christ-centered message, Book of Mormon prophets like Nephi saw immense value in Isaiah’s writings due to their relevance for “things that are, and which art to come” (2 Nephi 6:4). “Wherefore,” Nephi declared, “for their good have I written them” (2 Nephi 25:7-8), highlighting the importance of these prophecies for future generations, particularly those in the latter days.\n\nNephi selected and quoted passages that resonated deeply with his times and foreshadowed momentous events:\n\nThe enduring power of temples (Isaiah 2, 2 Nephi 12)\n\nThe triumphant return of Christ (Isaiah 2, 2 Nephi 12)\n\nThe glorious millennial reign (Isaiah 2, 2 Nephi 12)\n\nAn invasion from the north (Isaiah 10, 2 Nephi 20)\n\nThe rise of pivotal figures (Isaiah 11, 2 Nephi 21)\n\nThe collapse of spiritual Babylon (Isaiah 13-14, 2 Nephi 23-24)\n\nThe gathering of Israel under a sacred banner (Isaiah 49, 1 Nephi 21)\n\nThe coming forth of the Book of Mormon itself (Isaiah 29, 2 Nephi 27)\n\nNephi didn’t stop at mere quotes. He provided insightful commentary in 2 Nephi 25-30, illuminating these prophecies and their connection to his people and future generations. This tapestry of Isaiah’s pronouncements and Nephi’s interpretations serves as a beacon for Book of Mormon readers, allowing them to witness the marvelous fulfillment of God’s work in the latter days. As Christ himself affirmed, “And all things that [Isaiah] spake have been, and shall be, even according to the words which he spake” (3 Nephi 23:3).\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Book of Mormon doesn’t simply include Isaiah’s words; it elevates them as a key to understanding the prophet’s broader message. The resurrected Lord himself urged the Nephites to “search them” (3 Nephi 20:11), even calling Isaiah’s writings “great” (3 Nephi 23:1). Later, Moroni echoed this sentiment, urging readers to “search the prophecies Isaiah” (Mormon 8:23).\n\nWhy such emphasis? By understanding how the Book of Mormon quotes and interprets Isaiah, we gain valuable insights into the prophet’s message, applicable to our own lives today. Here’s how:\n\n1. Context and Clarity: The Book of Mormon often places Isaiah’s prophecies within their historical context, illuminating their original meaning and significance. This deeper understanding spills over when we read Isaiah independently, enriching our comprehension.\n\n2. Latter-day Relevance: The Book of Mormon highlights specific passages from Isaiah that resonate with our times, the “latter days.” By recognizing these connections, we can identify themes and truths relevant to our challenges and opportunities.\n\n3. Personalized Application: The Book of Mormon prophets often provide personal commentary on Isaiah’s words, offering their interpretations and insights. These interpretations can inspire us to find personal meaning and application within Isaiah’s broader message.\n\n4. Encouragement to Dig Deeper: The Book of Mormon’s emphasis on Isaiah serves as a springboard, encouraging us to delve deeper into the prophet’s entire writings. By understanding how the Book of Mormon utilizes Isaiah, we gain a powerful tool for unlocking the treasures within his prophecies.\n\nSo, the next time you pick up Isaiah, remember the Book of Mormon’s invitation to “search them.” You might be surprised at the clarity and meaning that unfold as you see Isaiah through the lens of the Book of Mormon prophets.\n\n“If, as many suppose, Isaiah ranks with the most difficult of the prophets to understand, his words are also among the most important for us to know and ponder. …\n\n“… His prophetic words can and should shine brightly in the heart of every member of the Church.” Elder Bruce R. McConkie, Ten Keys to Understanding Isaiah, Ensign, Oct. 1973\n\nIf you are seriously asking, how to understand Isaiah, The Church of Jesus Christ has published several suggestions:\n\nTen Keys to Understanding Isaiah by Bruce R. McConkie\n\nFive Keys for Studying Isaiah, by Ryan Gardner, Church Education System, and David Edwards, Church Magazines, offer\n\nThe Old Testament Student Manual Kings-Malachi has about a dozen suggestions.\n\nUnderstanding Isaiah and Other Challenging Scriptures, Elder Dallin H. Oaks converses with a group of seminary students about how to understand the book of Isaiah.\n\nWith all of these choices, we don’t have much to add, but first, let’s take Elder Oaks’ conversation with a group of seminary students shown above as he helps them with questions about understanding Isaiah:\n\nFirst Student: Ok, so it’s kind of hard to understand some of the Old Testament. How do you suggest to understand it for us, because some of the …like Isaiah, for example, it’s pretty hard to understand?\n\nElder Oaks: I agree. The Savior told the people in the Book of Mormon, “great are the words of Isaiah”, and he singled Isaiah out as the most important thing to study.\n\nIt is not easy to understand because, it’s written in, as Hebrew poetry. And it’s hard to understand. A lot of symbolism, but it must be important, or the Savior wouldn’t have said, “great are the words of Isaiah,” and wanted them to study it.\n\nAs I read Isaiah, I think the reason it’s important, is it’s filled with prophecies of the coming of Messiah, and the mission of the Lord, like those great chapters around 50 in Isaiah that speak of the Messiah suffering for our sins and being wounded for our transgressions, for instance.\n\nI think your student study guide serves you very well in its introduction, because it talks about the importance of looking for the meaning of words, how to use the Bible dictionary, and what to look for in the headings of the Scriptures, and how to use the footnotes, and it describes what I’ve called a type, which is something that represents a larger idea, like the serpent that Moses raised in the wilderness, and the people looked on the serpent and it’s representing a larger idea that’s simply a snake on a pole.\n\nIf you read carefully, these introductory pages, just the first half dozen pages, you’ve got a lot of help in how to understand some of these difficult-to-understand passages.\n\nReturn Missionary: Can I add onto that a little bit. Something that I appreciated on my mission, and I shared with you guys a little bit, I don’t know if you remember this in the beginning of our time together, but we did a study of the Book of Mormon where it was blessings and actions. And so instead of looking for those hard things in Isaiah that are difficult to understand, we would look through, ok, what do I need to do and then what’s the result of that where the Lord will bless me from that action.\n\nThat kind of pulls you away from the difficulty of it, and at least for me, that’s helped me so much, especially in Isaiah, because it is hard. Even me, as a teacher that’s supposed to teach you guys, it can be really challenging sometimes just trying to understand, ok, what is the main message that’s getting across here. So, with that poetry, it’s just difficult.\n\nHere are five other ideas from the Church to help you understand Isaiah:\n\nDon’t just read Isaiah, study his works and put in some real effort. The Old Testament Student Manual states: “When the Lord commanded the Nephites to study Isaiah’s words… He said, ‘Search these things diligently” (3 Nephi 23:1; emphasis added).” The manual states that it is not enough to just “read Isaiah’s writings. To come to an understanding of the book of Isaiah, you will have to diligently study and search by prayerfully pondering Isaiah’s teachings, analyzing them, and relating them to other scriptures.”\n\nUnderstand “The manner of prophesying among the Jews.” This phrase from 2 Nephi 25:1 has to do with the language and style Isaiah uses. The LDS Bible Dictionary says, “A major difficulty in understanding the book of Isaiah is his extensive use of symbolism, as well as his prophetic foresight and literary style; these take many local themes (which begin in his own day) and extend them to a latter-day fulfillment or application. Consequently, some prophecies are probably fulfilled more than one time and/or have more than one application.” Learning about Ancient Hebrew poetic styles and symbols will help you understand this prophet.\n\nCommit to studying by the Spirit. The prophet Nephi stated that “the words of Isaiah …are plain unto all those that are filled with the spirit of prophecy” (2 Nephi 25:4). We also learn from John the Revelator, “The testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy” (Revelation 19:10). The Old Testament Student Manual states: “prophets deliver their message through inspiration from the Holy Ghost, a correct understanding of their message must come from the same source (see 2 Peter 1:20–21; D&C 50:17–22). Righteous people who are serving the Lord and seeking to do His will can obtain the spirit of prophecy by searching the scriptures diligently and giving themselves ‘to much prayer, and fasting’ (Alma 17:3).\n\nTogether these verses promise that it will be easier to under Isaiah if we work to strengthen our testimony of Jesus Christ. Gardner and Edwards state, “Deepen that testimony and you’ll deepen your understanding of Isaiah.” This makes sense since Isaiah’s is the strongest messianic voice in the Old Testament. They concluded: “As you study by the Spirit, you will feel the truth of the Savior’s words: ‘Great are the words of Isaiah.’”\n\n“Use the Book of Mormon,” Elder McConkie suggests. He explained that because the works of Isaiah were preserved on the Brass Plates of Laban, those words were more correct than those we find in our Bible. He explained that 32 percent of Isaiah is found in the Book of Mormon in 414 verses with an additional 34 verses paraphrased, which is another three percent. But here is what is most important Elder McConkie wrote, “the Book of Mormon prophets interpreted the passages they used, with the result that this volume of latter-day scripture becomes the witness for and the revealer of the truths of this chief book of Old Testament prophecies. The Book of Mormon is the world’s greatest commentary on the book of Isaiah.”\n\nGet to know Isaiah’s world. Nephi knew that his since his people had left Jerusalem they would not understand Isaiah well unless they learned about “the regions round about” Jerusalem (2 Nephi 25:6). Throughout the book of Isaiah, the prophet refers to cities and other geographic features in and around the Fertile Crescent. To understand name places that Isaiah uses, turn to your Bible Maps 5–6 in the LDS scripture study helps. For example, look at this and read Isaiah 7:1–2, to see how understanding the “regions round about” helps with your understanding:\n\nKnowing some history along with the geography of the middle east around 700 BC will also go a long way in helping your understanding, check out our Historical Background of Isaiah for a timeline, charts, and other maps.\n\nThe Book of Mormon, a sacred text for members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, holds a unique connection to the Old Testament. In 1 Nephi 20, we encounter the first instance where an entire chapter from Isaiah (chapter 48) is quoted. This inclusion wasn’t a mere coincidence, but a deliberate act by Nephi, a prophet-historian, to bridge the gap between past and present. However, for many of us reading the Book of Mormon, this is a moment of confusion, as Isaiah can be difficult to understand.\n\nBut consider this before skipping the Isaiah Chapters in the Book of Mormon. Nephi made a mighty effort to etch these words onto the Golden Plates, including them to show his people (descendants of Lehi) and the Jews in Jerusalem (descendants of Israel) how God speaks to all His children throughout history, offering warnings and hope. He hoped this would strengthen their faith and future generations.\n\nSetting the Stage\n\nBefore delving into Isaiah’s words, Nephi establishes the context. He reveals that the LORD had shown the prophets of old, including Isaiah, “all things concerning those who are at Jerusalem.” These were the descendants of Israel who remained in the land, facing spiritual and physical challenges. Nephi then clarifies that the LORD also showed these prophets “concerning us,” referring to his people, the Nephites, who were descendants of Lehi, a prophet who had been led away from Jerusalem.\n\nProphecy for Two Houses\n\nNephi’s inclusion of Isaiah 48 and 49 serves a specific purpose. He explains that the LORD revealed future events to prophets of old, concerning both “those who are at Jerusalem” and “us” (1 Nephi 19:20-21). This distinction highlights the dual purpose of this and the following chapter:\n\nChapter 48, found in 1 Nephi 20, is directed towards “the house of Jacob,” or the Jews living in Jerusalem. Isaiah warns them against worshipping idols and reminds them of the LORD‘s foreknowledge and power. He expresses God’s love and desire to refine His people, highlighting the ultimate goal of salvation.\n\nHowever, it is a message steeped in both warning and hope. The LORD, through Isaiah, acknowledges His own omniscience and reminds Israel that He has always revealed their future, preventing them from attributing His works to false gods. He calls them out for their stubbornness and pride, even their tendency to worship idols alongside Him.\n\nYet, the message isn’t solely one of condemnation. The LORD expresses his love and patience, portraying himself as a refiner who purifies his people through challenges. He emphasizes his ultimate goal: salvation. He reminds them of their incredible potential, detailing the blessings they could have received if they obeyed his commandments – blessings like flourishing peace, righteousness, and abundance. The chapter concludes with a call to action – to leave Babylon and proclaim the message of redemption.\n\nThere is of course, an immediate connection to Chapter 49, covered in 1 Nephi 21, where he shifts the focus to “us,” the Nephites, who were considered “broken off” from the main branch of Israel. Isaiah’s message here becomes one of hope and restoration. He speaks of a servant, often interpreted as Jesus Christ, who will bring blessings and gather the scattered remnants of Israel. This chapter offers hope and encouragement, promising blessings for those who remain faithful to God. And it builds on the foundation laid in chapter 20, emphasizing the LORD‘s power and promises. It reassures Nephi’s people, reminding them that they are not forgotten or abandoned.\n\nOutline of 1 Nephi 20\n\nBaptized members of the House of Jacob have apostatized (20:1–2)\n\nThey swear by the name of the LORD, but not in truth or righteousness (20:1)\n\nThey claim to be of the holy city but do not rely on the LORD (20:2)\n\nThe LORD is omniscient (20:3–8)\n\nThe House of Jacob has and will be shown things to come (20:3,6)\n\nThe LORD revealed things to come to convince obstinate people that He is god, and they should rely on Him rather than upon their idols or their own wisdom (20:4–7)\n\nIsrael has seen prophecy fulfilled and has been told of the future, and yet they would not hear; this the LORD also knew (20:8)\n\nThe LORD‘s love for His covenant people (20:9–11)\n\nThe House of Jacob will be spared and refined in the furnace of affliction (20:9–10)\n\nThe LORD will not allow His name or his people to be polluted (20:11)\n\nThe omnipotence of the LORD (20:12–21)\n\nHe created the earth and the heavens, and they obey Him (20:12–13)\n\nHe raised up a servant to declare His word (20:14–17)\n\nBy the beloved servant the LORD will fulfill His words against Babylon (20:14)\n\nThe servant will declare God’s word and will be prospered by God (20:15)\n\nThe servant was sent by the LORD (20:17)\n\nThe LORD teaches the people the way they should go (20:17)\n\nBlessings are enumerated that Israel might have had if they had hearkened to the LORD (20:18–19)\n\nA warning to flee wickedness and testify of the LORD‘s redemption of this people (20:20–21)\n\nThe warning of the LORD: “There is no peace… unto the wicked” (20:22)\n\n(The ideas for the above content are sourced from Dennis Largey’s “Book of Mormon Reference Companion4 )\n\nA Comparison Between Book of Mormon Variants and King James, Iaaiah Chapter 48\n\nBy way of background for 1 Nephi 20–21, as Joseph Smith translated this part of the Book of Mormon, these words of Isaiah were dictated as a single chapter. Only later in 1879, by assignment from President John Taylor, Orson Pratt made much shorter chapters in the Book of Mormon.\n\nThis broke up the continuity of Isaiah’s message, (see Royal Skousen, Journal of Book of Mormon Studies). We suggest you read the three verses beginning at 1 Ne 19:22 and continue to the end of 1 Ne 21 as a single continuous unit.\n\nJudah’s Apostasy (Isaiah 48:1–8)Verses 1–2: Covenant Israel Has Apostatized 1\n\nReading just these two verses makes me want to ask why Nephi quoted this to his brothers and to his people? Was he warning them not to apostatize like the people back in Jerusalem? Is he speaking to us as Latter-day Saints to warn us of apostasy too?\n\nVerses 3–8:The Lord Knowing All, Uses That Power to Show Us He is God\n\nWe are just 8 verses into 1 Ne 20 and have seen how Israel was warned of God’s foreknowledge of their apostasy and how Nephi warns his people of the same potential, especially his older brothers. At the same time, he is inviting them to start anew as a covenant people.\n\nVerses 9–11: Through Our Afflictions, the Lord Make Us His Chosen People; The Lord Loves Covenant Israel\n\nNote how Isaiah’s metaphor introduced back in verse 4 still applies—those whose necks are iron and whose brows are brass need to be melted down and made pliable in the furnace of affliction—Bytheway, Isaiah for Airheads, Kindle Edition\n\nThe Savior’s “mission is to cleanse, purify, and refine the human soul so that it can return to his Father’s kingdom in purity, free from dross. (3 Ne. 27:19–21.) His cleansing power ‘is like a refiner’s fire, … And he shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver’ in that great day when he comes to judge the world. (Mal. 3:2–3; 3 Ne. 24:2–3; D.&C. 128:24)” Bruce R. McConkie, Mormon Doctrine, 2nd ed. [1966], 624\n\nVerses 12–21: The Lord Is All-Powerful (He Is Omnipotent)\n\nVerse 22: The Lord Warns Covenant Israel\n\nNephi’s Motivation for Using Isaiah\n\nNephi’s decision to quote Isaiah wasn’t simply historical documentation. He aimed to “more fully persuade his brethren to believe in the LORD the Redeemer.” Similar to Isaiah’s audience, some Nephites struggled with faith. By presenting these ancient prophecies, Nephi hoped to strengthen their belief and offer a glimpse into their future as part of the larger covenant people of God.\n\nIn Conclusion\n\n1 Nephi 20 is a powerful testament to the interconnectedness of God’s dealings with His children throughout history. Through the words of Isaiah, Nephi provides a message of hope, warning, and ultimately, the promise of redemption for all who turn to God. Ultimately, Nephi hoped these words would ignite a flame of trust and belief, reminding his people of God’s love, power, and promises.\n\nSources:\n\n1 Bytheway, John, Isaiah For Airheads, Deseret Book Company.
