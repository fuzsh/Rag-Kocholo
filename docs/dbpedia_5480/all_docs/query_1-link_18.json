        "text": "A few Key Events in the Ongoing Restoration\n\n2000 Early Spring: The 'Kingdom of God' within each of us is reveealed to me over. a three day period...., making key connecation betwen our health, our family history , and oneness with God. I realize this will change how the world looks at modern medicine.\n\n2000 Late Spring: I am told I will lead a separate parallel work to the Church. A work that will feed nations.\n\n2010. While on a family history vacation in California I feel the presence of Joseph and Emma and many or masses of Chinese ancestory in the spirit world. I am prompted to ask the name of two orgniations, the the first name Simple Living Centers is given and Habitat for Health...with the impression it will be a sister organization or Relief society like organization working with Habitat for Humanity....I later learn this partnership is needed to build or remodel neighborhood homes or churches into Simple Living Centers....facilities that are built tht they may be turned into small temples one day.\n\nfor the vision in more detail ....see simplelivingcenter.com\n\n1.0 For our First 2023 update -be prepared to consider a message that is out of the box,....or as one Isaiah scholar says,\n\nGod's end time servant will bring a message to those of the covenant - spiritual kings and queens, a message \"which had not been told them\" and \"which they had not heard\" (A. Gileadi: How Isaiah Impacts Gospel Theology page 1)\n\n-I came across Dr. Gileadi's work around 2014. ...and felt like two pieces of a puzzle were fitting together. Hear is some background regarding a Davidic servant in the last days.\n\nBefore 1990, it was generally taught in the Church of a latterday David figure to come before the second coming. One of the apostles changed that when he published that - that idea was a \"heresy.\" After that academia followed suit- leading to Dr. Gleadi's excommunication in 1993. (see \"How Isaiah Impacts Gospel Theology\". page 63-64 by Dr. Gileadi. )\n\nDr. Gileadi did not fight the Church but presented his case to Elder Maxwell several years later, resulting in his excommunication being canceled without any change in his position or academic conclusion. A commentary on Dr. Gileadi's work and Isaiah came be followed up at this link. More recently in Nov. of 2023 the Isaiah Instotite made the following statement.\n\n-------\n\n2.0 Another update is about a confirming witness that came in 2016, I was told by Sister White, an elderly women I baptized near the end of my mission in 1978, that the spirit revealed to her that I would be in a role like our prophet and apostles to lead a worldwide work, but not in the Church. I entirely forgot this experience , then this Sister came to me years later in 2016 - from the spirit world, in her prime - to remind me of this worldwide mission.Soon after that I was repreatedly prompted to proclaim this work to Endowed members worldwide. This came while living in Taiwan.\n\nDavid. Cassani\n\n3.0 Update Easter 2023 \"Clarity coming regarding a Women's Church\"\n\nClick here for April 6, 2023 messages to the Relief Society.\n\nSessions-- - 1,2,3 , 4, 5\n\n4.0 Baptisms for Health were practiced in Nauvoo in 1841, at times baptizing by immersion seven times. (see page 80 of link) I received a witness this baptism was into the Church of the First Born The first baptism for Health since this restoration of all things was for 10 year old girl who decided on her own a age 8 - that she did not want to live a life that contributed to the killing and eating of animals. Check this out in more detail at this link.\n\n5.0 Mormon Stories Plus- is new series of the Alta Vista Education Center being addded begiving June 25, 2023. Weekly - new series is being added.\n\n6.0 August 2023. Will the end time servant be announced over the pulpit.??? A leading Isaiah scholar says NO AND TELLS US WHY\n\n7.0 Sept. 2023. I am preparing the website for China and need translation support. \"Centers for the First Born \" is the organizational name for China. If you have not read the story click here. . \"Simple Living Center\"s the name used for neighborhood center for endowed mothers in other countries. .\n\nAttending BYU. A dream and message you may want to consider.\n\nThe new economy is coming . Click here.i\n\nDoes the Davidic Servant challenge the prophetic role of the Church./click here.\n\nOfficial Statement from the Isaiah Institute\n\nIn view of recent false online statements made against the Isaiah Institute, we wish to declare the following:\n\nProphecies of a Latter-Day David\n\nThe Isaiah Institute’s teachings concerning a latter-day David are firmly anchored in the Word of God—as evident in the prophecies of Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and others—and not on dreams or personal interpretations. We hold the conviction that the emergence of this anticipated Davidic servant will align with historical and scriptural patterns that serve as a hedge against counterfeits, and that his appearance will occur in the Lord’s own due time.\n\nThe Isaiah Institute has consistently maintained that we neither endorse nor encourage individuals to identify as the latter-day David nor validate any claims regarding his identity. We encourage people to search the Word of God for themselves, as all are commanded, and to avoid deception. We emphatically caution everyone against engaging with groups or individuals who profess to be this Davidic servant or who claim knowledge of his identity.\n\nWe encourage all to focus on the Lord Jesus Christ and his gospel of repentance and peace.\n\nOfficial Church Publications about a Latter-Day David\n\nQuestion: Have modern prophets, apostles or scholars written officially about a Davidic servant?\n\nAnswer: Yes. The following are five such official Church publications:\n\n“Although David was a King he never did obtain the spirit & power of Elijah & the fulness of the Priesthood, & the priesthood that he received & the throne & kingdom of David is to be taken from him & given to another by the name of David in the last days, raised up out of his lineage.” (Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith, p 339, also Joseph Smith, at the Temple, as recorded by Wilford Woodruff Journal, 10 March 1844, in Words of Joseph Smith, p 331)\n\nhttps://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/history-1838-1856-volume-e-1-1-july-1843-30-april-1844/293\n\n“According to the prophets the name of this king shall be David; not the patriarch David who was the son of Jesse; but a literal descendant of his. … Neither will any of the patriarchs act the part of an earthly king; although they will reign with Christ. Indeed, we have no reason to believe that Christ himself will act the part of an earthly king, or priest, to any great extent. … The idea is that the earth will be under the control of Christ and the glorified saints, and Christ will virtually reign over the whole earth, and this David will be subject to him.” (Times and Seasons, Feb 1842 with Joseph Smith as editor)\n\nhttps://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/times-and-seasons-15-february-1842/4\n\n“Let them know that it is Thy good pleasure to restore the kingdom unto Israel—raise up Jerusalem as its capital, and constitute her people a distinct nation and government, with David Thy servant, even a descendant from the loins of ancient David to be their king.” (Elder Orson Hyde, in his dedicatory prayer on the Mount of Olives, October 24, 1841, History of the Church 4:457)\n\nhttps://byustudies.byu.edu/online-chapters/volume-4-chapter-26/\n\n“King David (c. 1000 B.C.) remains today one of the most renowned Old Testament figures. His personality, spiritual sensitivity, creative abilities, military victories, and leadership carried him to the pinnacle of popularity. He had the potential to become an ideal king... However, prophecy states that a model ruler in the last days will be ‘raised up’ from David’s lineage.” (Encyclopedia of Mormonism, “David: Prophetic Figure of Last Days,” by Victor L, Ludlow, 1992.) https://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/digital/collection/EoM/id/5659\n\nhttps://eom.byu.edu/index.php/David,_Prophetic_Figure_of_Last_Days\n\n“A new leader named David (a descendant of the ancient King David) is to become a great leader in Israel. Ezekiel prophesies this, and there are additional references in Jeremiah, Isaiah, Hosea, and Zechariah. The Prophet Joseph Smith, only three months before his martyrdom, said: ‘… the throne and kingdom of David is to be taken from him and will be given to another by the name of David in the last days, raised up out of his lineage.’ The great hero of ancient Israel was David, the king of Israel; a new leader with this name will yet come forth.” (DHC, vol. 6, p. 253. Ensign, 1972, The Future of the Holy Land by Daniel H. Ludlow)\n\nhttps://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/1972/05/the-future-of-the-holy-land?lang=eng\n\nIsaiah Institute Disclaimer\n\nThe Isaiah Institute exists to teach the tools of literary analysis that enables people to better search the scriptures for themselves and to be guided by personal discoveries therein and by divine inspiration. Although the Isaiah Institute operates independent of any church or religious group, it encourages people in these goals to sustain their ecclesiastical leaders.\n\nThe Hebraeus Foundation and Isaiah Institute\n\nFounded in 1990, the Hebraeus Foundation and Isaiah Institute has a board of seven directors plus two legal counsel; 100 plus volunteers; thousands of donors; 4300 plus members in its Facebook Group; a new YouTube channel with 1000 plus subscribers; 300 plus active weekly book discussion participants; outreach programs in Europe and Asia; an Isaiah Explained app; fifteen books in print; translations in 5 languages; ten audiobooks; 3 full-length conferences series; Old Testament and Book of Mormon podcast series; and five websites: www.IsaiahExplained.com; www.BookofMormonIsaiah.com; www.IsaiahInstitute.com; www.IsaiahProphecy.com; www.JosephandJudah.com.\n\nA friend who worked with Governor Huntsman asked me to visit her friend, a previous Bishop .I went to his office at UVU. In handing a one page summary of this work to this past Bishop and key fundraiser at UVU, while just browsing it, he tells me ...oh my... I am receiving revelation. Summer of 2010\n\nAn Elderly Sister working at Seagull book learns of this work and says after reading it, her entire life now makes sense. 2014\n\nA economics professor at UVU and past CFO of Provo City, learns of this work as we chat during the July 4th parade. He says he starts receiving revelation regarding D and C. 45 July 4, 2010\n\nA return missionary from Taiwan (Christoper Caldwells says) I've been involved with David and this project since 2012 ...I have a testimony of this work we are engaged in, and have received a personal witness regarding Ezekiel 34:23 and how David Cassani is called to do this work. I cannot impress upon you how many time I have had spiritual impression upon spiritual impression working with David\n\nIn 2016, I am guided to take my wife and family to Taiwan to teach Simple Living Centers to those in Taiwan. The Stake Presidents counselors wife tells me .... The Holy Ghost told me to listen to you and have you teach our family. Xihu, Taiwan. 2016-17\n\nI am given a blessing from the Bishop, and after a long pause he says President Monson will help you. This happened in the Spring of 2010 just after receiving the two new names and feeling the presence of Joseph , Emma, and multitudes of Chinese. 3 months after being sent my story, President Monson released in November of 2010, the 3 volumes of minutes of the Political Kingdom of God to the historical department for publication. These records confirm to me the keys to the political kingdom of God lie in emotional integrity, and learning to listen to the Living Constitution within each of us, or our spiritual emotional anatomy. - a work given hints of in the initatory of the temple.\n\nAnother counselor in the Bishopric and my home teacher gives me a blessing ...that miracles small and large will come in the work . 2010\n\nHow this work can help awaken us, bring realignment to the Church, the unsealing (making plain) the endowment, the unsealing of Isaiah.
