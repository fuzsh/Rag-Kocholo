        "text": "Victor Ludlow, Keynote\n\nVictor Ludlow, Emeritus Professor of Ancient Scripture, BYU (Ph.D. in Near Eastern & Judaic Studies) Dr. Victor L. Ludlow is well known at BYU as a scholar on Isaiah and Judaism. He began teaching at Brigham Young University in 1972. Professor Ludlow developed and taught a variety of classes at BYU, with an emphasis on the Bible (especially the writings of Isaiah), the Book of Mormon, and Judaism.\n\nHe has authored numerous articles (including some in the Encyclopedia of Mormonism and the Book of Mormon Reference Companion) and the books: Unlocking the Old Testament; Isaiah: Prophet, Seer, and Poet; Principles and Practices of the Restored Gospel; and Unlocking Isaiah in the Book of Mormon. He has also prepared audio library lectures on covenants, the writings of Isaiah, the Middle East, the Bible, and, more recently, Latter-day Insights: The Middle East.\n\nLearning​ Key Principles of Truth\n\n​What are you called to learn? Victor will discuss three simple principles of learning truth that can be applied to our physical, moral, and spiritual realms. He will show us what to learn first and then how to go about doing it. You will hear his conversion story and how it helped him learn the first great truth everyone should learn - God is real and He communicates with us here on earth! Victor will also share some of his Hebrew and German knowledge.​\n\nYou will learn about principles of learning and how to discover them, how to listen to the spirit and some simple and powerful analogies. You will hear about a First Presidency message given early in 1978 that could change your perspective on church history forever. As we are called to learn truth we will discover how truth can make us and our children free."
