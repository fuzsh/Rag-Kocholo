        "text": "NIELS LARSEN.\n\nNiels Larsen is now living retired at Vineyard. He was for many years active as a farmer and now occupies a five acre tract of land, on which is a good brick residence. Here he is taking life easy after many years of arduous toil. He has advanced far on life's journey, having reached the seventy-eighth milestone. He was born at Kallehave, Praesto Amt, Denmark. March 13, 1841 a son of Lars Pedersen and Johanne Nielsen. When but a boy he went to sea and for eleven years lived the life of a sailor, making long voyages during that period. He also participated in the Danish-Prusrian war in 1864. He became a convert to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and. being very desirous of emigrating to Utah, started to work his way to Zion, leaving his wife and four children besides his parents and friends in their native country. His wife agreed to let him go, believing that he would soon return to her once more, as she did not hold a very good opinion of the \"Mormons.\" He gave her a deed to their house and four acres of land, also gave her all the money he had and on the 11th of September 1870 he embarked as a sailor on a Norwegian vessel which weighed anchor at Liverpool, bound for New Orleans. From that port he afterward returned to England and thence sailed for New York, where he received his discharge from the ship after serving for nine months and earning about one hundred and eighteen dollars. He paid fifty one dollars for his passage to Salt Lake City and crossed the plains in Captain Robert F. Neslen's company. He sent twenty dollars to his wife in Denmark and she then became desirous of joining him, telling him in a letter that if he would come to Denmark she would return with him to America, for she was afraid to travel alone. After obtaining counsel from President Brigham Young Mr. Larsen decided to return to Denmark, starting with just enough money to pay his passage to New York. He then shipped as a sailor on a German steamboat and on his arrival at Bremerhafen received a salary of about ten dollars, which was enough to take him to Copenhagen. On arriving there he reported to Canute Peterson, the president of the Scandinavian mission, who appointed him to labor as a traveling elder, which he did until the following year, when he once more sailed for America, this time accompanied by his wife and three children, his eldest son having died the previous year.\n\nOn the 24th of July. 1873. Mr. Larsen arrived in Salt Lake City and soon afterward located with his family on the Provo river, near the lake. Having previously been ordained an elder, he received his blessings in the Endowment House of Salt Lake City, May 4, 1874. when also his wife, Anne (Matbiasen) Larsen, was sealed to him. He was sent by the church authorities to work on the St. George Temple during the winter of 1874-6. When the Lakevlew ward was organized in 1877 he was chosen as second assistant in the ward superintendence of Sunday schools. He also presided over the deacons in the ward and in 1880 was set apart as first counselor in an elders quorum.\n\nIn August, 1888, Mr. Larsen was called upon to mourn the death of his wife, who had been the mother of thirteen children, six of whom have passed away, namely: Mathias, Hans, Peter, Christine, Matilda and Niels. Those who still survive are as follows: Oline, the eldest, is the wife of Harry Gammon, mentioned elsewhere in this work. Joseph married Madora Raddel, who is deceased and by whom he had two children, Joseph and Kenneth, and for his second wife chose Sarah Shirts. He resides at Escalante, Garfield county, where he is engaged in stock raising. Benjamin, twin brother of Joseph, married Elizabeth Stewart end they reside at Vineyard. They have seven children: Epiquis, Virgil, Ina, Rulon, Beth, Cleona and June. Hyrum, living at Murray, married Henrietta McClay and has four children. Hyrum, Thelma, Elmo and Zileta. Anna is at home. John, residing at Vineyard, married Nancy Stiekelberger. Mary is the wife of Hans C. Christensen, a farmer living on Provo bench. and they have seven children: Ira, Alvin, Anne, Jerda, Reed, Reva and Lloyd. Eleanora married Victor Anderson, residing at Provo, and their children are Anne, Mabel. Iris. Howard, Bernard, Lena, Lester and Naomi.\n\nOn the 5th of September, 1889, Elder Larsen married Sine Pedersen, who was born in Hormested, Hjorring Ami, Denmark, March 31, 1844. She had reared two children. Christian and Bine. Christian married Adelaide Prestwich and they reside in Huntington, Utah. They have eight children: Adelaide Ardell, Viola S.. James Rego, Herbert O., Zina A., Ida L., Alma L., and Alean S. Bine married Frederick Carl Linck and their children are Lucille, Frederick. Marie Irene, John Henry. Emma Adilie, Edmond Culbert and Helen Vilate. They make their home in Salt Lake City.\n\nElder Larsen was ordained a high priest January 14, 1900, and became second counselor to Bishop William Lewis of the Vineyard ward. In May, 1901. he was set apart as a home missionary and on the 25th of January 1902, he left home for a mission to Scandinavia and on his arrival at mission headquarters was appointed to labor in the Bergen conference of Norway. He spent the first year of his mission laboring in the Stavanger branch and the last year in the Copenhagen conference at Denmark, returning to Utah in 1904. This was the nineteenth time that Elder Larsen crossed the Atlantic ocean. In January, 1908. together with his wife, he commenced work for the dead in the Salt Lake Temple, which labor he has continued each winter during the past eight years. He has already done ordinance work for some eighteen hundred dead relatives, some of whom lived as far back as the year 1630.\n\nElder Larsen continued to reside near Provo Lake until 1892, when he removed to Vineyard, becoming one of the pioneers of that district. He was the first man to use drain tile, also the first to put down an artesian well in Vineyard and was the first in his neighborhood to build an enclosed barn for cows. He farmed quite extensively until recent years, when he sold his land, retaining possession of only five acres. On this he has a comfortable brick cottage and is now enjoying much of the ease of life with plenty of the world's goods to promote his comfort, in 1915. When seventy-five years of age in company with many young people from Provo, he climbed the Timpanogos mountain, which is twelve thousand feet high. That this was not too strenuous for him is shown by the fact that the next day be was able to go to work on his farm in the afternoon. At that time he was the oldest person that had ever ascended the mountain. In the Book of Mormon mention is made of eight barges described as carrying both the human beings and stock. The description speaks of an opening in the bottom and one on the top. To think of a vessel so constructed worried Mr. Larsen, so he sot about to try to demonstrate whether such a vessel were possible, for he believed that if it were not. It would not be mentioned by the prophet. Accordingly he sot about to make a model and soon discovered that it was very simple. He built a splendid model which shows very clearly how such a barge could be built. The little structure was made in 1904 and was given by him to the Salt Lake Museum on the 19th of September 1912. His life has been one of great activity and usefulness. In his business affairs he has carefully directed his labors, and success in substantial measure has come to him. As a worker in the church he has been most goalous and untiring and he became the founder of the Utah branch of the family, which is now a most numerous one, its members having contributed throughout the years to the substantial up building and development of the state along material, intellectual, social and moral lines.\n\nGEORGE LE BARON.\n\nWith various phases of business activity George Le Baron is connected at Santaquin, where he is engaged in general merchandising and dealing in hay, grain and provisions and is also carrying on farming and cattle raising. He was born in Salt Lake in 1863, a son of David and Esther M. (Johnson) Le Baron. The family is of English lineage and was founded in the new world by Francis Le Baron, who came from England to America with the Pilgrims who settled in Massachusetts. Today the Le Barons are numbered by the hundreds throughout the United States and Canada. David Le Baron was left an orphan when quite young and was at Nauvoo. Illinois, at the time of the martyrdom of the prophet Joseph Smith, he and his wife being caretakers of the mansion where Joseph Smith lived at the time. In 1852 they came to Utah and for years Mr. Le Baron was in charge of a carding mill owned by Heber C. Kimball. Later he removed to the southern part of Utah county, where he homesteaded one hundred and sixty acres and began the development of a new farm. His family numbered eight children, of whom George was the sixth in order of birth, the other children being David, Jr., Ella, Willism J., Don M.. Benjamin F., George, Mary and Edna. When but eight years of age George Le Baron began providing for his own support by peddling fruit. His father owned two acres in Salt Lake City, where Salt Air station now stands and thereon had an orchard and vegetable garden.\n\nLater George Le Baron located on his father's homestead and is now manager of his father's estate. From time to time he has purchased land until the possessions of himself and sons amount to seven hundred acres. They are among the largest cattle raisers of Utah county and have most carefully, wisely and successfully conducted their business. Through an active career, however, Mr. Le Baron has met with hardships and difficulties but these he has overcome by determined and persistent effort. Starting out as he did as a fruit peddler, he was thus employed until he reached the age of sixteen years and then took up the painter's trade but abandoned it later for the work of the farm, since which time he has been continuously connected with agricultural pursuits and stock raising. In 1909 he entered the commercial field, purchasing a general mercantile business at Santaquin, and this he conducts in connection with his ranch. He carries all branches of general merchandise and likewise deals in hay, grain and provisions, paying the highest market price for all kinds of produce. In business affairs he displays sound judgment and keen discrimination and whatever he undertakes is brought to a successful issue. His sons have remained in business with him and they are among the prominent as well as prosperous farmers and stock raisers of this section of the state, producing several thousand bushels of grain each year and feeding and fattening a good number of cattle annually. They have a tractor upon their place and full farm equipment and four hundred acres of their land is under cultivation.\n\nIn 1885 Mr. Le Baron was united in marriage to Miss Mary A. Oppenshaw, a daughter of Roger Oppenshaw, a farmer and sheep man, who also engaged in merchandising, and it was after the death of Mr. Oppenshaw that Mr. Le Baron bought his business from the heirs of the estate. To Mr. and Mrs. Le Baron have been born eight children who are yet living. May, the eldest, is the wife of Elmer Morrill, a farmer residing at Tridell, Utah, and they have six children: Le Von, Wilda, Delia, Alton, Wayne and Oren. George W., Jr., married Levina Greenhalgh and they have three children, Phyllis, Wendell and Merton. David R. married Hazel Bennett and has one child, Lilah. Edna is the wife of Arthur Hendricks, a farmer of Santaquin, and they have four children: Lamar, Welton, Lanita and Rulon. Olive is the wife of Dan Greenhalgh, a farmer of Utah county, and their children are three in number, Delsa, Carroll and Velda. Vera is the wife of Thomas Robbins, an electrician at the power plant at Santaquin. and they have one child, Le Baron. Ella and Raymond are at home. David has served on a two years' mission to the southern states. Mr. Le Baron is a member of the Seventy. He has served for two terms as a member of the town board and for nine years as a school trustee. He is deeply interested in all that has to do with the material, intellectual and moral progress of his community and his cooperation can be counted upon to further any project or enterprise for the public good.\n\nENOCH LUDLOW.\n\nOne of the attractive features in the landscape near Spanish Fork is the highly improved farm of Enoch Ludlow, whose home is at Benjamin. He is one of the substantial citizens that England has furnished to Utah, his birth having occurred in Yorkshire on the 20th of January, 1853, his parents being Nathaniel and Mary Ann (Niblett) Ludlow. The father was a mason by trade, following that pursuit in England, where he also engaged in contracting. At length he determined to come to the new world and in September, 1878, arrived in Utah, bringing with him his wife and three children. The life record of Enoch Ludlow is the story of earnest endeavor, for when but seven years of age he began work in a woolen factory, where he was employed for seven years. He war afterward apprenticed to a butcher and for a short time before he came to the new world he owned and operated a shop devoted to the manufacture of sausage, but having embraced the faith of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the family decided to cast in their lot with the people of that religious belief in Utah. For sixteen years the father remained a resident of this state, passing away in 1894 at the age of seventy-two years. He had been an active church worker and his business interests were those of farming.\n\nSince coming to Utah, Enoch Ludlow has given his time and energies to agricultural pursuits and is numbered among the pioneers of the vicinity of Spanish Fork. His brother Paul homesteaded in this district and Enoch Ludlow paid the costs of securing the homestead and became owner of the property. His first home was a log cabin and he also lived for a time in a dugout. He then built a residence of adobe brick, which was destroyed by fire in 1888, together with a granary that contained eight hundred bushels of grain, leaving Mr. Ludlow and his family without anything except the clothing which they wore. With characteristic energy, however, Mr. Ludlow faced the situation and at once began the building of a good brick residence, which he now occupies. As the years have passed he has continued his farm work with good success and in connection with his sons, Thomas E., Enoch, Jr., Richard and Fred, he is extensively interested in sheep and cattle raising, having two bands of sheep and thirty-four hundred ewes. He also has sixty-five head of cattle on the range. There are large shade trees upon Mr. Ludlow's farm, and it is one of the most attractive and beautiful places of the district. He has fifty acres in his home place and at one time was the owner of several hundred acres but has divided his holdings among his children. There are no modern improvements lacking upon his ranch, which has been brought to a very high state of cultivation. Upon it are all kinds of fruit and berries, which were planted by him.\n\nIn 1872 Mr. Ludlow was married to Miss Levina Horsefall, a daughter of Richard Horsefall, who was a native of England, where he engaged in business as an architect. Mrs. Ludlow was the only one of her family to come to America and is the only one now living. By her marriage she became the mother of ten children, nine of whom survive, John having been accidentally killed when but eight years of age. The others are: Thomas E., Paul, Nathaniel, Jesse, Walter H., Enoch Jr , Richard, Fred and Priscilla. The last named is the wife of Moroni Bingham. All of the sons are farmers of Utah county, as is the husband of the daughter. There are now forty-one grandchildren and one great-grandchild.\n\nIn the work of the church the family has taken a most active and helpful part. Mr. Ludlow served on a mission to England from 1904 until 1906 and had charge of the branch for a time. His son Paul was on a mission to the northern states and was president of the Illinois conference. Another son, Walter, was a traveling missionary in England for two years and Nathaniel also spent a similar period in that country in missionary work, while Enoch was recently on a mission to the southern states and was president of the Texas conference. Mr. Ludlow is president of the Seventy at Benjamin and is ward teacher. For twenty years he was choir leader and organized the Benjamin brass band, in which he played the tuba and drum. His children have inherited his musical talent and tastes and his son Paul was leader of the band, while Mr. Ludlow was its manager. All of the sons have farms of their own but work together more or less and Richard lives with his father upon the old homestead, while the others occupy homes of their own. In politics Mr. Ludlow is a democrat and keeps well informed on the questions and issues of the day, but the honors and emoluments of office have no attraction for him as he prefers to concentrate his efforts and attention upon other interests, especially his business and his church affairs.\n\nCHARLES D. MAAG.\n\nCharles D. Maag is one of the enterprising farmers living in the vicinity of Provo. His home is at Vineyard and he is associated with his brother Henry in the cultivation and development of a valuable farm property of one hundred and eighty acres. Mr. Maag was born September 6, 1898, on the farm where he still resides and where he has always lived, his parents being Conrad and Anna (Brachbuhl) Maag, both of whom were natives of Switzerland, his father having been born at Zurich and the mother in Bern. They came to America as young people at the same time with their respective families. The Maag family established their home in Salt Lake, while the Brachbuhl family became residents of Willard. Utah. It was in the fall of 1876 Conrad Maag and Anna Brachbuhl were married and they began their domestic life in Payson, where they resided until 1879. They then took up their abode upon the old homestead farm where Charles D. Maag now resides. The father homesteaded one hundred and sixty acres of land. He remained active in the cultivation and development of the farm until 1905, when he turned it over to the care of his son. He died in April, 1916, and the mother is now living with her sons, Charles and Henry. She has been quite active in the work of the church and is president of the Relief Society at Vineyard. The boys were given common school privileges while spending their youthful days in the home of their parents. Charles D. Maag was the fifth in order of birth in a family of six children who are yet living. Conrad, the eldest, is a farmer and well driller, residing at Vineyard and married Emma Johnson, by whom he had one child, Wesley. He afterward married Anna Williamson. Caroline, the next of the family, is the wife of Mathias Robinson, of American Fork, and they have five children, Maria, Earl, Glenn, Fern and Ray. Joseph is with the army in France, having arrived in that country just before the armistice was signed. Annie is the wife of William Madsen, a resident of Idaho, and they have three children, Ray. Louis and Bert. Charles D., whose name introduces this review, married Aretta Patton and they have two children, Dora and Benjamin. Henry married Leverne Forbes and they have three children, Harold, Tate and Helen. The two brothers, Charles D. and Henry, have won a well earned reputation as most enterprising and progressive farmers. They now own the old home place which today comprises one hundred and eighty acres of excellent land, of which they have seventyfive acres planted to diversified crops, while the remainder is hay land. They are engaged very extensively in the raising of hay and annually harvest a wonderful crop. They also conduct a dairy business, keeping twenty cows for this purpose. The farm is splendidly improved according to modern methods and scientific ideas of farming They have over two miles of drain tile on the place, they use a tractor and have full farm equipment. There is an immense silo upon the place, also a hay barn one hundred and eight feet in length. They have fifty-five acres of their land planted to beets and annually gather a good crop. They keep Holstein cattle, with a full blooded registered sire at the head of the herd. Every progressive feature of farm life is found upon their place and the brothers are regarded as most capable and energetic business men, carrying forward to successful completion whatever they undertake. Each has his own home upon the place and their mother divides her time between the two households.\n\nJESSE MANWARING.\n\nJesse Manwaring, chief of police of Provo, prompt and efficient in the discharge of his duties, was born in England, on the 26th of June, 1862. His father, Henry Manwaring, was one of the early settlers of Utah who arrived in 1872, coming to this state as a convert to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints. He established his home in Springville and continued to reside there until called to his final rest, his death occurring in 1905, when he had reached the age of seventy-five years. In early life he had learned the trade of shoemaking, which he long followed as a source of livelihood. He was ever an active and earnest member of the church and was president of a branch in England, serving also as a traveling elder. The mother, Sarah (Barbar) Manwaring, came to America with her husband and children, the family numbering seven sons and two daughters, of whom Jesse Manwaring was the sixth in order of birth. The mother died in this state in November, 1918, at the very advanced age of eighty-seven years.\n\nJesse Manwaring supplemented his public school training received at Springville, Utah, by a course of study in the Brigham Young University. From the age of fifteen years he has been dependent entirely upon his own resources and whatever success he has achieved or enjoyed has been attributable to his individual labors. He was apprenticed to the harness maker's trade and for thirty-five years engaged in work along that line. In fact he followed harness making until 1907. In 1911 he became connected with the police force as an officer and was appointed in April, 1915, to the position of chief to fill out the unexpired term of W. F. Giles. He was again appointed in 1917 and has since continuously filled the position. His thorough understanding of the work of the department, his desire to be of real service and benefit in crushing out crime and his resourcefulness in methods have made him largely an ideal officer in this position.\n\nIn 1885 Mr. Manwaring was married in Salt Lake Temple to Miss Louisa E. Jacques, a native of Utah and a daughter of Thomas and Hannah (Philipps) Jacques, representatives of one of the old families of Nova Scotia. Mr. and Mrs. Manwaring are the parents of three children: Jesse Vernon, Grace and Leona. The family reside at No. 592 West Third street, North, where they own an attractive home. Mr. Manwaring is a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints of the third ward, in which he has served as elder. His political endorsement is given to the democratic party and he has been an earnest worker in its ranks because of his firm belief in its principles. Having spent the greater part of his life in Utah, he is well known in this section of the state and the substantial traits of character which he has always displayed have gained for him warm friendship and high regard.\n\nEDWIN J. MARCHBANKS.\n\nOne of the garden spots of Utah county is the farm of Edwin J. Marchbanks. It has been transformed from an arid waste into a most rich, fertile and productive tract of land and the labor bestowed upon it by the owner has made it a splendid property. Mr. Marchbanks is a native of Essex, Wales. He was born January 18, 1853, of the marriage of James and Mary Ann (Ordcastle) Marchbanks. The father's birth occurred at Portsea, England, March 30, 1824. He came to America September 16, 1868, making his way to Utah. His early life from boyhood had been spent upon the sea until he accepted a position as policeman in England, so serving for eighteen years. He represented one of the old families of that country. The Marchbanks as far back as known were seafaring men and the great-grandfather of Edwin J. Marchbanks was born at Tweed, in Northumberland, England, in 1760, while the grandfather was born at Plymouth, England, June 9, 1800. His son, James Marchbanks, was the first of the family to embrace the Mormon religion and it was this that brought him to the new world. After two years spent in Salt Lake City he went to Springville, where he took up the occupation of farming. His family numbered but two children, his daughter being Mrs. John Stewart, of Salt Lake City.\n\nEdwin J. Marchbanks was a youth of fourteen years when the family home was established in Utah. His educational opportunities were limited, owing to the fact that he preferred to work rather than attend school and the only whipping that his father ever gave him was his punishment for hiring out to work in a printing office at the age of eleven years. He worked there for a time and later was employed in a leather factory until he came to America. He had been in Salt Lake for but a brief period when he hired out to drive stage for Gibb Spencer, making the trip with a mule team from Salt Lake to Echo canyon, and as he was unacquainted with the ways of mules he had some exciting times with them. In 1869 the family went to Springville and Edwin J. Marchbanks entered the employ of Milan Packard, hauling lumber from the sawmills in Hobble creek canyon to Provo, this lumber being used in the construction of woolen mills. During those days he had several narrow escapes from the Indians. Later he was employed by Bishop William Bringhurst for five years, working at farming and at hauling timber from the canyon. He thus became well acquainted with the Indians and they called him the bishop's boy and liked him, for the bishop was very good to the Indians in many ways and won their friendship, which was extended to his employment. Thus through the period of his boyhood and youth Edwin J. Marchbanks continued to work. He was the only son in the family, for his elder brother, George, had disappeared at the age of twenty-one years and was never found, and a younger brother, John had been killed in a molasses mill in 1871, when nineteen years of age. For a time Edwin J. Marchbanks worked on the Oregon Short Line and on the Denver & Rio Grande Railroad, spending fifteen years in that way. He assisted In grading and building the railroad from Springville to Pleasant Valley and afterward commenced as engine wiper for that road and gradually won advancement, serving as engineer at the time when he left the railroad. During this period he lived at Springville and in 1890 he purchased the fifty acre farm upon which he now resides at Mapleton. He has a modern bungalow upon his place, good barns and all modern conveniences and his land has been converted into a most productive tract. His life has been one of untiring activity and his diligence has constituted the basis upon which he has builded a substantial success.\n\nOn March 3, 1871, Mr. Marchbanks was married to Miss Mary E. Allan, a sister of Charles E. Allan, mentioned elsewhere in this work. They have become parents of six children, of whom four are living: Emma, the wife of Earl Hamond, a farmer near Mapleton; Hilda, the wife of Charles Everett, also farming in the same locality; Zillah Ann, who died in infancy; Eva, the wife of Freeman Bird, a farmer residing at Lake Shore; Willis, who died at the age of twenty years; and Leo, who cultivates the home farm.\n\nMr. Marchbanks is very active in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, was choir leader for some time and for some years has been a teacher in Springville. He is also elder in the church and his wife is a teacher in the Relief Society. They are people of genuine worth, enjoying the warm regard of all who know them.\n\nJAMES F. McCLELLAN.\n\nJames F. McClellan, of Provo, is identified with farming interests. He was born in Payson, Utah, in 1859 and is a representative of one of the old pioneer families of the state, his parents being Samuel W. and Almeda (Stewart) McClellan. The father was born in Tennessee and the mother in Missouri, and James F. McClellan is a representative of old southern and Yankee families. His father came to Utah in the early '50s and was a pioneer settler of Payson, where he served for several terms as a member of the city council and otherwise was prominently associated with public affairs, being regarded as one of the valued and substantial residents of that community. He followed the occupation of farming and was for a time a partner of Jesse Knight at Tintic. He was also interested at Dixie in the early days during the settlement there.\n\nJames F. McClellan acquired a common school education and followed mining at Park City, Utah, for several years. He was also engaged in mining at Tintic for Jesse Knight for a number of years and from 1892 until 1897 was in Montana, acting as foreman at a quartz mill for a year and as watchman during the remainder of the time spent in that state. He afterward proved up on land in the Uinta reservation, where he resided for several years. He now resides at No. 407 North Seventh street, West, in Provo, in a comfortable residence, and is devoting his attention to farming, owning a half interest with Frank Eastman in sixty-five acres of rich and valuable land.\n\nIn 1890 Mr. McClellan was married to Miss Hattie Taylor, a daughter of George and Eliza (Nichols) Taylor, who still survive. Her mother is now president of the Taylor Brothers Dry Goods Company, the largest business in Provo. Mr. McClellan is the oldest representative of his family in Utah and is the possessor of a gold badge which was originally given to his mother in 1897 by the Pioneer Association of Utah, at which time she was the oldest representative of the family in the state. Mr. McClellan formerly gave his political allegiance to the populist party but now votes with the democratic party. For sixty years he has been a resident of Utah and therefore a witness of the greater part of its growth and development, his influence and aid being at all times given on the side of progress and improvement.\n\nD. P. MCDOWELL.\n\nD. P. McDowell, who is the owner of fifty acres of irrigated land three miles west of Payson, was born in Morgan county, Ohio, February 4, 1862, a son of William and Elizabeth (Pierce) McDowell, who were also natives of that county, where the father followed the occupation of farming. Their family numbered seven children, of whom D. P. McDowell was the third in order of birth. Those elder than himself were: Marion, who died at the age of twenty-three years; and J. H., while the younger members of the family were Frank, Mary, Claire and Lottie.\n\nD. P. McDowell acquired his education in the public schools of his native state, where he resided until he attained his majority, when he removed to Henry county, Missouri. He afterward went to Guthrie county, Iowa, and later to Smith county, Kansas, working in these various sections by the month as a farm hand until 1885, when he began learning the stonemason's trade in Smith county, Kansas. There he followed that pursuit for a time and also at Cheyenne, Wyoming, and at Ogden, Utah. In 1894 he took up his abode in Payson, Utah, where he became a mason contractor, continuing in the business there until within a few years. At the present he gives his entire attention to farming, but for several years he was in partnership with Henry Erlandson in the contracting and building business. They executed many important contracts, including that of the Payson high school and other large buildings. Concentrating his efforts and attention upon agricultural pursuits, Mr. McDowell is now the owner of a fifty-acre farm under a high state of cultivation, pleasantly and conveniently located within three miles of Payson. The entire tract is irrigated and is devoted to the raising of sugar beets, wheat, oats and lucerne. Mr. McDowell makes his home in Payson, where he occupies a modern brick residence that was built in 1902. Aside from his farming interests, he is a director of the State Bank of Payson and has been one of its stockholders since its organization.\n\nIn 1901 Mr. McDowell was married to Miss Lizzie Powell, a daughter of William Powell, a pioneer of Payson and a leading contractor and builder. Mr. and Mrs. McDowell have become parents of four children: Lottie, Emma, Powell and Frank. Fraternally he is connected with Payson Lodge, No. 19, I. O. O. F., of which he is a past grand, and he has also been representative to the grand lodge of the state. His political allegiance is given to the republican party where national questions and issues are involved but at local elections he casts an independent vote. He is an enterprising farmer whose methods are at all times practical and progressive and whose labors constitute an element in the utilization of the natural resources and the substantial development of the county.\n\nSHERMAN McGARRY.\n\nSherman McGarry is one of the owners of a seventy-two acre fruit farm at Spanish Fork and is very extensively and successfully engaged in horticultural pursuits. He was born at Beaver, Utah, September 8, 1885, a son of James and Elizabeth (Twichell) McGarry. The father was a native of Vermont and a son of James McGarry, who was born in Ireland, whence he emigrated to America. James McGarry, responding to the call of the country for aid to preserve the Union, fought under General Sherman In the Civil war and for ten months and two days was held as a prisoner in Andersonvllle prison. He was afterward with Sherman on the celebrated march from Atlanta to the sea and in battle was wounded in both ankles. After the war he removed to Beaver county, Utah, settling near Milford, where he engaged in mining and later concentrated his efforts and attention upon farming and stock raising. He was a very prominent and influential resident of his community, doing much to mold public thought and action and shape the history of the district. He served as probate Judge and as district judge and was also United States deputy marshal during the enforcement of the Tucker polygamy law for a period of eleven years. He likewise filled the position of county clerk. Although a Gentile, he was well liked by his Mormon neighbors and was always fair and just in his dealings with them. He became a large owner of mining and iron claims in Iron county, holding valuable property of this character at the time of his death, which occurred in 1902. His widow survives and yet makes her home at Beaver. In the family were five sons and two daughters:\n\nJames C, who is now a veterinary surgeon practicing at Burley, Idaho; Lillian, the wife of Samuel Wilson, a resident of California; E. C, a mining engineer of Salt Lake City; Edna, the wife of Russell Westerman, of Beaver; Sherman and Sheridan, twins, the latter a farmer of Beaver; and Ambrose, who is one of the professors in the University of Utah at Salt Lake City.\n\nSherman McGarry was reared upon his father's farm and obtained a high school education, which was supplemented by two years' study in the University of Utah, where he pursued a course in mining engineering. He afterward following mining for three years and has since devoted his attention and energies to farming. In 1916 he disposed of his interests at Beaver and removed to his present place of residence, which is situated near Spanish Fork. Here he now owns seventy-two acres of fruit land in connection with his brother, E. C. McGarry, and they also have some farm land. Twenty-five acres of the home place is planted to peaches and ten acres to apples and cherries. There are altogether seven thousand trees upon this property and. in the year 1919 they harvested a very extensive crop of cherries, peaches and apples, producing many thousands of bushels. Mr. McGarry is most progressive in the care and propagation of his orchards and is making a most careful and scientific study of fruit production. Already he is ranked among the leading horticulturists of his section of the state.\n\nIn 1916 Mr. McGarry was united in marriage to Miss Alverda Jones, daughter of Thomas Jones, a cattleman of Spanish Fork. They have two children, Mary E. and Fred J.\n\nIn politics Mr. McGarry is a republican and was an active worker in party ranks while at Beaver but is now concentrating his energies and attention mostly upon his farm work, leaving political activity to others. His father was a thirty-second degree Mason and a man of prominence and influence in the district. Sherman McGarry has guided his life according to the teachings of his father and mother who gave all her attention to the rearing of her family, and in his business career has made steady advance, winning not only success but an honored name. He is today one of the capable fruit raisers of Spanish Fork, his place constituting one of the fine fruit farms in this section of the state.\n\nEMERY McKELLlP.\n\nEmery McKellip, one of the trustees of the Orem town site and a prominent fruit grower of Utah county, was born at Nauvoo, Illinois, in 1865, a son of Darwin and Martha (Wittekiend) McKellip. The father was a native of Buffalo, New York, while the mother was born in Germany, whence she was brought to America by her parents when a small child. Darwin McKellip was twenty years of age when he accompanied his parents on their removal westward to Princeton, Illinois, whence they afterward went to Carthage and later to Nauvoo, that state. On leaving the last named place he became a resident of David City, Nebraska, where he homesteaded and engaged in farming and fruit growing. He was a very successful horticulturist and took great pleasure in raising all kinds of fruit, in which work he won very substantial prosperity.\n\nThe early training which Emery McKellip received was obtained in his father's orchards and has constituted the foundation upon which he has built his later success. He acquired a common school education and remained at home to the time of his marriage. He then took up farming at Albion, Nebraska, where he was engaged in business for seven years, at the end of which time he came to Utah and made his way to the reservation in the Uinta valley, where he continued for a year. He next purchased his present place, which consists of twenty acres planted to apple orchards, containing about sixteen hundred trees. He devotes his entire time and attention to horticultural pursuits and is also a chicken fancier, keeping several hundred hens. His business affairs have been wisely, carefully and successfully conducted and in the year 1918 he sold over seven thousand bushels of No. 1 apples, largely Jonathans and Winesaps, highly renowned for their excellent quality.\n\nIn 1897 Mr. McKellip was married to Miss Emma Moon, who was born in Marion county, Iowa, a daughter of J. E. and Mary Jane (Newell) Moon, who removed to David City, Butler county, Nebraska, when Mrs. McKellip was but six years of age and there she was reared and married. To Mr. and Mrs. McKellip have been born four children: Bernice, now a student in Whitman College at Walla Walla, Washington, where she has entered upon the second year of a four years' course; Bernard, who is at home; Marion, attending high school; and Raymond, who is also in school.\n\nMr. McKellip is a progressive citizen, interested in everything pertaining to the welfare and up building of the community in which he makes his home, and his genuine worth, his business enterprise and his progressiveness are recognized by all with whom he comes in contact.\n\nWILLIAM A. McKENZIE.\n\nWilliam A. McKenzie, a cattle raiser and bank director living in Springville. was born in this city, August 14, 1860, a son of George and Elizabeth (Wood) McKenzie. The student of history cannot carry his investigations far into the records of Utah county without learning of the close connection of the McKenzie family with this district. The grandfather, Murdoch McKenzie, was born near Perth, Scotland, February 8. 1805, and came to Utah with his family in 1852. He was one of the first city councilmen of Springville but remained in Utah only until 1858, when he removed to California, where he resided until his death, passing away in San Bernardino on the 9th of April, 1890. George McKenzie was a youth of seventeen years at the time the family home was established in Utah. He became a freighter and railroad contractor, freighting to and from Montana, California and Nevada. With the building of the railroad he took up contract work in connection with the Union Pacific and the Denver & Rio Grande. When his son, William A. McKenzie, was fourteen years of age he and his brother. G. L. McKenzie drove mule teams for their father in freighting, hauling salt from Snake valley, Juab county, Utah, to the smelters at Cherry creek, Pioche and Ward, Nevada. Our subject was thus engaged during the greater part of each year for a period of seven years.\n\nWilliam A. McKenzie remained at home with his father up to the time of his marriage and was engaged in freighting and railroad construction work with him. He then became interested in farming and also in railroad contracting in connection with Joseph Thorn, of Springville, and for ten years the partnership between them continued.\n\nLater he and others organized the Ely Construction Company, in which he was active for eight years, and during this period they took big contracts in several of the western states, securing grading contracts for smelters at Ely, Nevada, at Tooele, Utah, and railroad contracts in Arizona and New Mexico for the El Paso & Southwestern Railroad and for the Denver & Rio Grande in Colorado. The nature of their work was of a most important character and contributed much to the development of the west. Mr. McKenzie is still interested in contracting with the Reynolds Ely Construction Company, and is also devoting considerable time to his farming and stock raising interests. General farming claims the greater part of his attention but he also feeds about a hundred head of cattle in the winter seasons and has an equal number upon the range in the summer. He has been quick to recognize the business opportunities of the west and to utilize them not only for the benefit of himself but for the up building and development of the district as well. Aside from his agricultural and stock raising interests at the present time he is well known in other business connections, being a director of the Springville Banking Company, a director of the Utah Wholesale Grocery Company and a stockholder in the Springville-Mapleton Sugar Company. His father died December 8, 1915, having remained active to within the last ten years of his life, continuing throughout the entire period in railroad contract work. During his declining days he took special care of his home, having one of the finest yards to be found in the state. The same neatness and care was manifest in the back yard as well as on the front lawn and it was said that he had the cleanest back yard in Utah.\n\nThe home of William A. McKenzie is a most comfortable brick residence in Springville, built in 1893. On leaving home Mr. McKenzie was united in marriage in 1888 to Miss Ella Falkner, of Springville, a daughter of John Falkner, who was a shoemaker and gardener. Mr. and Mrs. McKenzie had two children. Their son Willis, an accountant with the Utah Wholesale Grocery Company of Salt Lake, was graduated from the Brigham Young University at Provo and enlisted in the aviation branch of the Signal Corps in December, 1917. He was honorably discharged February 13, 1919, at Fort Logan, having been trained in Texas. Bertha is a graduate of the Brigham Young University at Provo, where she specialized in art and music. She taught art in the Manti school tor a year and has since been a teacher of art in the graded and high schools of Utah. When at home she has classes of piano students. Having lost his first wife, Mr. McKenzie was married in 1897 to Grace Sumsion, of Springville, a daughter of George Sumsion, a pioneer of that place. They have four living children: Leland. a student in the Brigham Young University at Provo; Thelma and Ray, who are attending high school; and Electa, who completes the family. One daughter, Clara E., born May 27, 1907, died September 15, 1910.\n\nThe foregoing record indicates that the McKenzies have long been actively and prominently associated with the up building of this state, and the work instituted by the grandfather and carried on by the father is now being continued by William A. McKenzie, who is reaching out into still broader fields of usefulness, cooperating heartily in every plan and project for the benefit of his city and the commonwealth at large.\n\nJAMES L. MELDRUM.\n\nJames L. Meldrum, a successful farmer and horticulturist of Utah county, was born in Leslie, Scotland, August 5, 1853, a son of George and Jane (Barclay) Meldrum, who were also natives of the land of hills and heather, where the father learned and followed the shoemaker's trade until 1860, when he bade adieu to friends and native land and sailed for the new world with Utah as his destination. He traveled across the plains with a handcart company under the command of Edward Martin and Daniel Tyler, this being the last handcart company to make the trip. Mr. Meldrum and five other men were engaged in manufacturing shoes at Provo for a period of ten or twelve years. He had removed to Provo after a month spent in Salt Lake City. Later he became interested in farming and as his financial resources increased invested more and more largely in property until he was an extensive landowner. He remained an active and earnest worker in the church and was sent as a missionary to Scotland, where he remained from 1877 until 1879, while in 1880 he labored as a missionary in the Shetland islands. He was second counselor to Bishop John E. Booth for twenty years in the fourth ward of Provo and put forth every possible effort to advance the interests of the church. He was also an active factor in the business development of the community and was a shoemaker, farmer and fruit grower. He was likewise connected with the Provo Woolen Mills and with the East and West Cooperative Stores and other mercantile enterprises.\n\nJames L. Meldrum acquired a common school education and remained upon the home farm with his father to the time of his marriage, which occurred when he was twenty-one years of age. He has since followed farming, at first renting land, but, carefully saving his earnings, was enabled to purchase the tract where he now lives in Pleasant View in 1879. He owns forty-five acres in the home place and also a tract of one hundred and twenty acres devoted to dry farming and situated adjoining the foothills of the Wasatch range. This is one of the best dry farms in Utah. The land is especially adapted to wheat growing and has yielded as high as fifty and sixty bushels per acre, the yield in the present year (1919) reaching sixty bushels. The first home upon the farm was a log cabin but this was later replaced by a frame dwelling. His work has largely been of a character that has contributed to public progress and benefit as well as to individual success. He planted the first orchard in Pleasant View ward and helped build all the irrigation canals in his section. He is now a director of the Timpanogos Canal Company and one of the stockholders in the Fawcett Field Canal Company. In early life he had charge of the Holdaway sawmill and logging interests in Spanish Fork canyon, furnishing railroad ties and lumber for the Denver & Rio Grande. He was thus employed for several years, working on the railroad. He was a most powerful man in his younger days and at one time on a bet he lifted eleven hundred and thirty pounds. This was during the days when he was working on the Denver and Rio Grande. In recent years he has been engaged at different periods in the cattle business as well as in general farming. He has twenty acres planted to orchard, largely pears, and he also raises cherries and apples. His dry farming methods are most successful and in all of his business affairs he is meeting with well deserved prosperity.\n\nOn the 5th of August, 1873, Mr. Meldrum was married in Salt Lake City to Miss Sarah H. Haws, a daughter of William W. and Barbara (Mills) Haws, who became pioneer residents of Utah, arriving in this state in 1848. Mr. and Mrs. Meldrum have had a family of eleven children, nine of whom are living. Their first born, James, died in infancy and Donald W. reached manhood and was married but has now passed away. The others are: Lilly May, the wife of Frank Sackett, a resident of Sterling, Idaho; Elmer Cm who has charge of a part of his father's farm; Nellie, who married Owen Hull, a farmer of Idaho; George, who is in the war risk insurance department of the government service at Washington, D. C; G. Gilbert; Effie, the wife of Chauncey Collier, living at Bingham; Calvin, at home; Fleta, the wife of Thomas Richie, of Salt Lake; and Vernal, who has been a member of the navy since 1917, being an engineer and mechanic on one of the battleships in Pacific waters. All of the children have attended the Brigham Young University.\n\nMr. Meldrum has been quite active and prominent in community affairs. He was county fruit tree inspector from 1903 until 1905 and was supervisor of the Provo-Olmstead county boulevard. His political allegiance has always been given to the democratic party and his position upon any vital question is never an equivocal one, as he stands loyally for any interest which he believes to be of benefit to the community at large. His religious faith is that of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, in which he is serving as an elder.\n\nRICHARD L. MENDENHALL.\n\nRichard L. Mendenhall is one of the prosperous farmers and sheep raisers of Utah county, making his home at Mapleton. He was born in Nauvoo, Hancock county, Illinois, August 19, 1845, a son of William and Sarah (Lovell) Mendenhall. The father was born in Delaware, while the mother was a native of England and in Delaware they were married before making their way westward to Nauvoo. In 1852 they crossed the plains to Utah, at which time their family numbered five children. Four others were born in Utah and Richard L. Mendenhall was the fourth in order of birth in the family. The others are: Mary; Thomas; A. H. M., who died in Nauvoo, Illinois, before the family moved west to Utah; John; Elizabeth; Sarah; William; and Hannah. The family spent one night at Salt Lake City and then proceeded to Springville, where the father worked at his trade as a bricklayer and mason. He was active in the work of the church and was presiding teacher of the third ward of Springville for many years. He died in 1906 at the venerable age of ninety-one.\n\nRichard L. Mendenhall had but limited educational opportunities. When but nine years of age he began herding sheep in the mountains and was thus employed until he reached the age of fifteen. He remained upon his father's farm until he was twenty-five years of age, when he married and for seven years thereafter he resided at Springville. He next went to Mapleton, where he homesteaded one hundred and sixty acres and built there a small frame house. In 1888 he replaced this structure by a large modern brick residence, two stories in height-at that time the largest house in Mapleton.\n\nHe has prospered as the years have gone by, by reason of his close application, unfaltering industry and indefatigable effort. He and his son are engaged in sheep raising and his son works the home farm. As the years have passed Mr. Mendenhall has prospered and there is every evidence of comfort upon his place. He has a large barn as well as a large dwelling and there is every equipment for the care of his stock and his grain. His flocks number two thousand head and Mr. Mendenhall and his son are regarded as representative sheep raisers of their section of the state.\n\nIn early manhood Mr. Mendenhall wedded Maria Catherine Boyer, a daughter of Augustus S. Boyer. She passed away in 1915, leaving two children, Irena and Richard Lovell. The daughter is now the wife of Joseph Jensen, a former teacher in the Agricultural College at Logan, but now a farmer of Tremonton. They have four children: Joseph R., Robert S., Eleanor and May. Richard married Hannah Bird, a daughter of Charles M. Bird, mentioned elsewhere in this work, and they have five children: Wendell. Louise, Arthur. Earl and Erma, the last two being twins. Richard Mendenhall, Jr., was on a mission to the southern states covering a period of two years and was president of the conference in Kentucky during the latter part of that period.\n\nMr. Mendenhall of this review was on a mission to Colorado from 1902 until 1904. He is a high priest in the church and his son is an elder. Mr. Mendenhall was one of the first to join the republican party at Mapleton. He is a pensioner of the Black Hawk war, having served during a part of two years in Sanpete county with the rank of lieutenant. With almost every phase of development and progress in this section of Utah he has been closely associated and the worth of his work is widely acknowledged.\n\nERNEST A. MENLOVE.\n\nErnest A. Menlove, of Provo, a photographer of recognized ability, is of English birth. The place of his nativity is St. Albans, England, and the date May 25, 1876. His father, Joseph Menlove, is a resident of Payson, Utah, having come to this state in 1889 as a convert to the faith of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. He settled in Payson and through the intervening years has been engaged very successfully in farming. He remains an active and devout member of the church and has done everything in his power to advance its cause. Prior to coming to America he served in the London conference as a traveling elder. The mother of Ernest A. Menlove was prior to her marriage Miss Ann Streaton, also a native of England. She came to America with her husband and children, the family numbering seven sons and five daughters, ten of whom survive and are residents of Utah.\n\nErnest A. Menlove, the sixth member of the family, was educated in the schools of England and was graduated from the Payson public school. He afterward spent a year in study in the Brigham Young University of Provo and when eighteen years of age took his initial step in the business world. He was first engaged in mining and followed that pursuit, working as a miner for twelve years and spending the last two years of that period as foreman of the Centennial Eureka mines. While thus engaged he utilized his leisure for the study of photography and in 1909 he established a photograph studio, which he has since continuously and successfully conducted. He has developed his business until he has now the leading photographic establishment in Provo. He keeps in touch with the latest approved methods and inventions having to do with photography and the work that he turns out is of such excellence that his patronage is most liberal. From 1912 until 1917 he was also engaged in the notion and novelty business, handling pictures and other goods of that character.\n\nOn the 22d of December. 1897, in Salt Lake Temple, Mr. Menlove was united in marriage to Miss Ines Selman, a native of Payson, Utah, and a daughter of M. B. and Jane (Daniels) Selman, the latter now deceased. She belonged to one of the old and well known pioneer families of Payson. To Mr. and Mrs. Menlove have been born seven children: Beulah, Ernest Lavon, Clyde Harold, Roy Alfred, Walden S.. Cleon Thomas and Ruth Ines.\n\nThe parents hold membership in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in the sixth ward and Mr. Menlove is first counselor of the elders quorum. He is identified with the Provo Commercial Club and stands for all that works for the up building and improvement of the city, for all that makes for civic cleanliness and righteousness or advances its material and moral progress. His personal characteristics, his geniality, his unfeigned cordiality and uniform courtesy make for popularity among all who know him and he and his wife occupy an enviable position in social circles, while in the line of his chosen art he has gained well deserved prominence and success.\n\nEPHRAIM ARTHUR MITCHELL.\n\nThere are many attractive shops in Provo carrying a well selected line of goods and bespeaking the enterprise and progressiveness of the proprietors. A leading merchant tailoring establishment is that of Ephraim Arthur Mitchell, who is conducting business at No. 101 North Academy avenue. He has been a lifelong resident of Utah, his birth having occurred at Payson. August 4, 1874. His parents were David A. and Christiana Gertrude (Frost) Mitchell. The father was born in South Africa of Scotch parentage and became an early settler of Utah county, Utah, where he resided to the time of his death, which occurred in 1891, when he was fifty-four years of age. He was a shoemaker by trade but through much of his life followed farming and stock raising and was very successful in the conduct of his business affairs. He belonged to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints, becoming a convert to that faith in Grahamstown, Africa, where he was born. On leaving that country he sailed from Port Elizabeth with the intention of taking up his abode in the colony of people of his own faith in Utah. He was president of the Elders Quorum and of the Seventy and was very active in Sunday school and church work. The mother was also born in Africa and was of English lineage. She came to America with her husband and they reared a family of eleven children, five sons and six daughters, of whom Ephraim Arthur Mitchell was the youngest son and the seventh child. The parental grandfather, David Alexander Mitchell, went to Africa with a Scotch regiment, serving with the rank of captain in the British army. The maternal grandfather, Mr. Frost, went to Africa when on a whaling expedition and there the grandparents in both lines remained to the time of their demise. The mother of Ephraim A. Mitchell passed away in Utah in 1895, at the age of fifty-five years.\n\nWhen a lad of six Ephraim A. Mitchell entered the public schools of Payson and after mastering the branches of learning therein taught he became a student in the University of Utah, from which he was graduated with the class of 1896, having completed a course in the normal department. Following his graduation he took up the profession of teaching in Utah county and was thus engaged for three years. He was afterward apprenticed to the tailor's trade, which he thoroughly learned, and subsequently he began business on his own account. He first opened a tailoring establishment in Payson and continued there successfully for three years. In 1901 he removed to Provo, where he has since carried on business with gratifying success. He has today the largest establishment and enjoys the most liberal trade in the city and he ranks among the leading merchant tailors of southern Utah. The workmanship of his shop is ever of the highest order and his earnest efforts to please his customers, combined with his thoroughly reliable business methods, have gained for him a most gratifying patronage.\n\nIn Salt Lake City, on the 16th of June, 1898, Mr. Mitchell was married to Miss Kate Johnson, a native of England and a daughter of William Johnson. They now have three children, namely: Harold, who was born in Payson on the 27th of March, 1898; Donald, whose natal day was February 7, 1905; and Leicester, whose birth occurred February 17, 1915.\n\nThe parents belong to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and Mr. Mitchell also has membership with the Knights of Pythias, in which he has held all of the offices, including that of grand chancellor of the domain of Utah. He is likewise identified with the Benevolent Protective Order of Elks and is a past exalted ruler of Lodge No. 849. He is a most active and earnest worker in the Provo Commercial Club and has taken the initial step in bringing about many interests which have had the strong backing of the club. His political support is given to the republican party and during the European war he served on all important committees in connection with the Red Cross drives, with the sale of bonds and War Savings Stamps. He has delivered many addresses in support of these organized projects for the upholding of the government, speaking in many different sections of the country, while his logic and his arguments have carried conviction to the minds of his listeners.\n\nHENRY IVEN MOORE.\n\nHenry Iven Moore, vice president of the Orem lines, which he has also represented as general counsel since 1912, has through the years of an active business career made for himself a creditable position in legal circles and as a representative of railway interests.\n\nHe was born in Austin, Texas, on the 9th of March, 1878, and is a son of M.

In the meantime he was called upon for public service in the line of his profession, filling the office of prosecuting attorney at Del Rio from 1900 until 1905. In 1905 he became county and probate judge of Val Verde county, Texas, and in 1906 he was nominated for the office of district judge of the sixty-third judicial district of Texas.\n\nIt was in September, 1912, that Mr. Moore became a resident of Salt Lake City and through the intervening period he has not only been a representative of the legal profession here but has also become actively identified with railroad and mining interests of the west. He is now general counsel and assistant general manager for the Nevada Copper Belt Railroad Company, also for the Nevada Douglas Copper Company and vice president of the firm of A. J. Orem & Company of Boston, Massachusetts. He is likewise general counsel for the Salt Lake and Utah Railroad Company and since 1912 has been general counsel for and vice president of the Orem lines. His activities through these relations are of an important character, having to do largely with the development of the natural resources of the state and the improvement of general business conditions\n\nOn the 25th of December, 1910, Mr. Moore was united in marriage to Miss Mabel Shirley, of Dallas, Texas, and they have two sons, Aubrey I. and Henry I., Jr. Mr. Moore belongs to the Salt Lake City Commercial Club and along fraternal lines is connected with the Masons and with the Elks. His political allegiance is given to the republican party and he has been a stalwart worker in its ranks but has neither sought nor desired office outside the strict path of his profession. As the years have advanced and he has recognized opportunities in the business world he has extended his efforts into railway and mining circles, where his legal knowledge has been of great worth, while his executive ability has also constituted an important element in successful administration of railroad and mine affairs.\n\nA. T. MONEY.\n\nA. T. Money, president of the Farmers Cooperative Association of Spanish Fork, who is also engaged in farming and cattle raising, is identified with the moral development as well as the material progress of Utah county inasmuch as he is serving as bishop of Palmyra ward of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

The family numbered five children who yet survive, of whom A. T. Money is the third in order of birth, the others being Margaret S., Richard W., Euphemia and Andrew.\n\nA. T. Money acquired a common school education and when eighteen years of age started out in the business world by entering the employ of Deal Brothers & Crandall at Springville in connection with railway contract work. He remained with that firm in its operations in Colorado, Arizona and New Mexico and subsequently became a. partner in the Springville Grading Company, engaged in making grades for the railroad into the Tintic district. Subsequently Mr. Money did business as a member of the firm of J. O. Thomas & Company and afterward became senior partner in the firm of Money & Roach, engaged in building railways and doing irrigation and canal work in Idaho. They also represented the Cache Valley Land & Canal Company. At a later period Mr. Money was employed by the city of Spanish Fork as street supervisor and also served as policeman and water master, his public duties in these connections covering a period of thirteen years save that during a part of the time he was away on contract work. In 1899 he purchased the farm upon which he now resides. It was then an undeveloped tract of land with no improvements save that there was a small log house upon the place. He now has a beautiful home, standing in the midst of fine shade trees, while in the rear are substantial barns and all the necessary outbuildings for the shelter of grain and stock. He engages quite extensively in raising fruit upon his place and its present fine appearance is attributable entirely to his labors, persistency of purpose and sound judgment. He owns sixty-five acres in this place and also has one hundred and eighty acres in a farm on Lake Utah and is interested in seven hundred acres of cattle range in the mountains. He is regarded as a big operator in farming and stock raising and is one of the most progressive agriculturists of this section of the state. He has thirty acres of his land planted to beets. He follows the most progressive and scientific methods in the care of his crops and his labors are bringing to him justly merited success. He is also a director of the Commercial Bank of Spanish Fork and was the vice president of the Jex Lumber Company for several years. He is the president of the Westfield Irrigation Company and is deeply interested in the subject of irrigation. Upon his own place he has artesian wells which furnish water for the home with good pressure. His residence is at Palmyra, three miles northwest of Spanish Fork.\n\nIn 1889 Mr. Money was married to Miss Ann M. Jex, a daughter of William Jex. a pioneer settler of Spanish Fork, mentioned at length elsewhere in this work. They have become parents of the following children, eight of whom are still living: Albert Edward, who is manager of the Jex Lumber Company at Spanish Fork; Margaret, the wife of Ammon Ferguson, of Spanish Fork; Ann: William J.; Richard B.; Reed J.; Miles: Myrl and Zina.\n\nThe family is identified with the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and Mr. Money was the first bishop of Palmyra ward, which was organized August 11, 1901, and still fills that position. His wife is president of the Relief Society and was counselor in primary work previous to taking her present office. Mr. Money was president of the Third Ward Young Men's Mutual Improvement Association at Spanish Fork before he removed to Palmyra. He is now high priest and his son, Albert E., served on a mission to Ireland covering two years and was secretary to Rodger Clawson while there and also conference clerk. Mr. Money gives his political allegiance to the democratic party and keeps well informed on the vital questions and issues of the day but does not seek nor desire office as his time and attention are fully occupied by his business interests and his church duties.\n\nLARS NIELSEN.\n\nLars Nielsen, president of the Spanish Fork Cooperative Institute and at one time mayor of Spanish Pork, where he is regarded as a most progressive citizen and an outstanding figure in public affairs, was born in Denmark, June 5, 1857, a son of Peter and Kersten (Larson) Nielson, who on coming to America in 1865 made their way at once across the country to Utah. He had been thirty-five days in crossing the Atlantic ocean on the sailing vessel Kimball from Hamburg to New York city and then he made his way across the plains in Captain Atwood's company. He and a man by the name of Huffany bought ox teams at Wyoming Hill, Nebraska, to make the journey, which they completed with only one skirmish with the Indians, who shot one man and took his wife away with them, nothing being heard of her afterward. On their emigration to America Mr. and Mrs. Nielsen brought with them three children: Lars, the eldest of the family; Mary, the deceased wife of William Vier, of Salt Lake; and Mrs. L. L. Bailey, of Salt Lake. The father became a pioneer farmer of Utah county and for years he was president of the old cooperative store. He exercised considerable influence over public thought and opinion in his community, and his worth was widely acknowledged by all, so that his death, which occurred in 1913, was the occasion of deep and widespread regret. The mother had passed away a few years before.\n\nLars Nielsen remained with his father upon the home farm until he had attained his majority, when he was married and took up farming and cattle raising on his own account. As the years have passed he has become recognized as one of the big cattlemen of the state and now has two hundred head of cattle upon the range. His farm comprises one hundred and ten acres of rich and productive land, of which forty acres is planted to beets. The place is thoroughly modern in its equipment and in the methods of farm work carried on. His residence is a modern brick dwelling, which was erected in 1913 and is one of the most attractive homes of Spanish Fork. Aside from his farming and stock raising interests Mr. Nielsen during the building of the Strawberry irrigation project by the government was a director on the board of the Water Users Association. He is also a stockholder in the Gem Roller Mills at Spanish Fork, and was elected president of the Spanish Fork Cooperative Institute in March. 1919, which position he still holds.\n\nMr. Nielsen was united in marriage to Miss Mary J. Beckstrom, a native of Sweden, who came to Utah with her parents when young, her father being Hogan B. Beckstrom. a carpenter by trade. To Mr. and Mrs. Nielsen have been born eleven children: Lars, who is principal of the school at Bingham, Utah; James, who is employed by the Consolidated Wagon & Machine Company at Spanish Fork; Peter, who died at the age of eighteen years; Mary, the wife of David H. Jones, of Spanish Fork; Rebecca, now the wife of Arthur McKell, of Spanish Fork; Annie; Eleanor, now Mrs. Rulin J. Creer; and Harvey, Ralph, Clarence and Ardella, all at home."
