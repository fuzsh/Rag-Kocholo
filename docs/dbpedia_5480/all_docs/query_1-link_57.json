I was, therefore, instructed that whenever we had cases of this kind, except where the students were really repentant and immediately working out their problems, that we should suspend them from the university.” (Ernest L. Wilkinson diary, May 21, 1959)\n\n4307:\n\n“[Meeting with David O. McKay] President McKay consented to us engaging an expert on our campus to try and detect those who are guilty of homosexual acts.” (Ernest L. Wilkinson memorandum, in David O. McKay diary, April 25, 1962)\n\n4116:\n\nSeptember 12, 1962: Ernest L. Wilkinson, President of BYU, met with BYU general counsel Clyde Sandgren, the new Dean of Students, J. Elliott Cameron, and Apostle Spencer Kimball and Mark E Petersen ‘on the question of homosexuals who might possibly be part of the student body.’ They developed a cooperative system where Mormon General Authorities and other Church administrators would give BYU any information they obtained about homosexuals on campus and BYU would give Church administrators information about homosexual church members. They decide ‘as a general policy that no one will be admitted as a student at the BYU whom we have convincing evidence is a homosexual.’ (Ernest L. Wilkinson journal, September 12, 1962)…” (Seth Anderson, “Timeline of Mormon Thinking About Homosexuality,” NoMoreStrangers.org, December 8, 2013)\n\n4158:\n\n“Nor do we intend to admit to our campus any homosexuals. If any of you have this tendency and have not completely abandoned it, may I suggest that you leave the university immediately after this assembly; and if you will be honest enough to let us know the reason, we will voluntarily refund your tuition. We do not want others on this campus to be contaminated by your presence.” (Ernest L Wilkinson, BYU Convocation speech, September 23, 1965; published in Church News, November 13, 1965, p. 11)\n\n4304:\n\n[Concerning the BYU Honor Code. The meeting included Ernest Wilkinson, David Haight and the First Presidency.] “The only item which consideration was given by the First Presidency was item 6, which they had suggested read as follows:… ‘and no self-abuse (masturbation) or homosexual activity…’\n\nAfter some discussion of the matter, the Brethren were in agreement that the paragraph should read as follows:… ‘Homosexuality will not be tolerated.’” (David O. McKay diary, August 18, 1967)\n\n1736:\n\n“The homosexuality problem at Brigham Young University campus was reviewed for members of the Boards. President Oaks reviewed past Board and General Authority actions on this matter. He then indicated that it was his understanding from past actions that there was clear directions that no known overt homosexual was to be enrolled or permitted to remain at Brigham Young University. However, he expressed concern with regard to the following subjects:\n\nWho is authorized to make exceptions?\n\nWhat effect should a policy give to the enormous variety in the intensity of homosexual problems?\n\nWhat, if any, effect should a policy give to the fact that a person has confessed and is being counseled and making progress?\n\nHow should the enormous practical problem of handling homosexuals when there is only a suspicion that a person is homosexual, or when a person is a confirmed homosexual but this fact is known only to his bishop.\n\nPresident Oaks then asked for specific authorization to work with the following students, allowing them to continue enrollment at BYU:\n\nStudents with homosexual tendencies, but who have had no overt experiences, or whose overt experiences were so long ago (followed by sincere repentance) that they have satisfactorily separated themselves from the category of ‘overt homosexuals.’\n\nStudents without homosexual tendencies, but who have had some overt experience, have confessed, and are in the process of repentance.\n\nAction: Elder Marvin J. Ashton was asked to work with Brigham Young University in defining a policy relative to homosexuals. A clarification will help the Church Educational System, bishops and stake presidents with this problem.” (Minutes, Board Meeting, December 6, 1972)\n\n2611:\n\n“Under BYU’s President, Dallin Oaks, campus security was instructed to find homosexual students and bring them before standards to be treated or expelled.…” (Ben Williams, “One-way ticket to Provo,” Q Salt Lake, October 23, 2014)\n\n1737:\n\n“President Oaks reviewed with members of the Boards the action of the Executive Committees on April 19, 1973, which is indicated in the following excerpt from the minutes of that meeting:\n\nPresident Oaks sought direction from the Executive Committee on how he should deal with some specific problems of irregular sexual behavior on the part of BYU employees and students. This matter had been discussed by the Executive Committee and board some months ago, but had been deferred until after preparation of a general statement on homosexuality printed in the February 1973 issue of the Priesthood Bulletin. After considering the most recent action by the Board of Trustees on this subject (January 16, 1969) that homosexual students would not be admitted or retained at BYU without approval from the General Authorities, the Executive Committee instructed President Oaks that no known overt homosexuals were to be enrolled or permitted to remain at BYU as students or employees, but that the following persons were not to be treated as ‘overt and active homosexuals’ for the purpose of this policy:\n\npersons who had repented of evil acts and totally forsaken them for a suitably lengthy period of time, and\n\npersons who had been guilty of irregular sexual behavior not equivalent to fornication or adultery and who were repentant and showed evidence that their irregularities would not be repeated.\n\nThe retention or dismissal of employees or students falling in the latter two categories should be a matter of decision on an individual basis by the administration at BYU, after considering the nature and duration of involvement, the circumstances of the student’s or employee’s work at the University, and the recommendation of the ecclesiastical officer having jurisdiction over the case.\n\nAction: It was the consensus of the Boards that Brigham Young University should proceed as counseled in this matter.” (Minutes – Board Meeting, May 2, 1973)\n\n1265:\n\n“Dallin H. Oaks, president of the 25,000 student, Mormon-owned school, admitted drug users and active homosexuals are ‘two influences we wish to exclude from the BYU community.’\n\nOaks’ statement was in response to claims by a former undercover agent for BYU’s security force that agents had used electronic devices to spy on students, made searches of dorms and other student housing unites without bone fide search warrants, and conducted ‘witch hunts’ for gay people and drug abusers.\n\nJoseph ‘Skip’ Morrow, a recent graduate of BYU, told an Associated Press reporter he quite the security force ‘in disgust’ when asked to take spying assignments he considered ‘beyond the responsibilities of a law enforcement agency.’…\n\nBYU Security Chief Robert Kelshaw denied that Morrow was ever employed by his department. He admitted that agents have checked ‘homosexual haunts’ looking for BYU students as far away as Salt Lake City 40 miles north of Provo. He also said a self-contained body microphone has been used on officers and informants during investigations.…\n\nAccording to Oaks, a purpose of the security fore is to help protect the university from influences that ‘we try to exclude from our university community.’\n\n‘Two influences we wish to exclude from the BYU community are active homosexuals and drug users, and these subjects are therefore among those with which our security force is concerned,’ he said.…\n\nAccording to gay students subjected to the school’s discipline, students are required to visit the counselor for homosexual problems of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (Mormon) in Salt Lake City. They are asked to give a complete history of their sexual experience and to give the names of other gay people. They are told that homosexuality is a serious sin and that they must repent. Psychiatric counseling is advised, and students report that many of the doctors recommended practice shock therapy and treat homosexuality as ‘an illness.’\n\nThose students who refuse to follow BYU’s policy or the church’s ‘call for repentance’ are generally expelled from BYU and either disfellowshipped or excommunicated from the Mormon Church.” (The Advocate, June 18, 1975, p. 15)\n\n4034:\n\n“The ‘buyer’ should ‘beware’ when he selects a psychotherapist, says Dr. Allen E. Bergin, professor of clinical psychology at Brigham Young University.\n\n‘Like any form of intervention such as X-rays or drugs, psychotherapy can be helpful or harmful depending on who uses it and how,’ Dr. Bergin says.” (“Therapist Selection No Simple Choice,” Salt Lake Tribune, March 12, 1976)\n\n1743:\n\n“[p. 3] The present study is an effort to investigate only one treatment factor used in aversive conditioning of male homosexuality. The principal focus will be to determine whether the use of nude male and female pictures is a necessary requisite for successful treatment using Behavioral techniques.…\n\n[p. 4] Despite criticism and expressed need for modification of the technique, the success rate for aversion therapy has been encouraging. Feldman and MacCulloch (1965) found that their approach was successful with approximately 60 percent of their patients.…\n\n[p. 42] Seventeen male subjects were used in the study, 14 completed treatment.… The nature and extent of homosexual activity ranged from frequent sexual activity with multi-partner involvement to covert activity.…\n\n[p. 43] It was mandatory that all subjects chosen to participate sign and have witnessed a prepared statement explaining (a) the experimental nature of the treatment procedure, (b) the use of aversive electric shock, (c) the showing of 33 mm slides that might be construed by subjects as possibly offensive, and (d) that Brigham Young University was not in any direct way endorsing the procedures used.…\n\n[p. 46] A graded series of discrete shocks were delivered to each subject at the “belly” of the bicep.…\n\n[p. 54] Male and female nude visual-cue stimuli were chosen randomly by the experimenter from a series of pictures taken from recent Playboy/Playgirl-like magazines.…\n\n[p. 70] Analysis of differences between groups on the sexual orientation measure indicated a highly significant therapy effect only (F=17.54, p<0.001), showing that at the conclusion of treatment, both treatment groups evaluated themselves as significantly less homosexual than heterosexual (see Table 6). This finding suggests [p. 71] that the type of Behavior Therapy used in the present study was highly effective in changing subjective evaluation of sexual orientation, as measured two weeks subsequent to treatment termination.…\n\n[p. 82] It can be assumed that Behavior therapy involving aversive conditioning, specifically Thorne’s (1968) EAT procedure, is an effective treatment for male homosexuality.… (Max Ford McBride, “Effect of Visual Stimuli in Electric Aversion Therapy,” PhD Dissertation, BYU, August 1976)\n\n1744:\n\n“Institute of Human Behavior\n\nPresident Oaks indicated that in response to the fact that personal problems of Church members were increasing in number and seriousness, and that revealed truth about human behavior was not being used systematically by professionals to combat these problems, it was proposed that an Institute for Studies in Values and Human Behavior be established at BYU to sponsor and conduct research that would assist in preventing and changing problem behaviors which lead people away from eternal life.… Dr. Allen Bergin of BYU was recommended as the director for the Institute.\n\nACTION: Approved.” (Minutes – Combined Boards’ Meeting, September 1, 1976)\n\n4035:\n\n“President Dallin Oaks said the institute will counter secular trends that explain human behavior without reference to God or traditional values.…\n\nBergin also said the institute will accept contracts from the LDS Church’s social services and will research social and emotional problems within the LDS value system.” (“Y. Launches Institute On Behavior,” Salt Lake Tribune, September 30, 1976)\n\n1746:\n\n“An Institute for Studies in Values and Human Behavior has been established at BYU with Dr. Allen E. Bergin, one of the nation’s leading clinical psychologists, as its director.…\n\n‘The program will involve theory construction, beginning with the scriptures as a basic frame of reference.’ He pointed out that there are no other institutes in the world exactly like this one.… (“Behavior institute established at Y,” Daily Universe, September 29, 1976)\n\n1745:\n\n“[p. 6] Reference was made to a letter on homosexuality which was circulated several weeks ago to all General Authorities purportedly from the Department of Psychology at Brigham Young University. [Initially called The Payne Papers, it was later published under the title, Prologue.] It has been determined that the letter did not come from the BYU Psychology Department, and all indications are that the person who anonymously planted this letter in the mailroom in the Church Office Building attempted to implicate the BYU Psychology Department. It was reported that the publication, “The Open Door,” which purports to be the voice of the Salt Lake City ‘gay’ community, has begun to reprint that letter in a series of articles over the next six months. It was indicated that [Church] Commissioner [of Education Jeffrey] Holland and President Oaks are working very closely with Elder Boyd K. Packer concerning this matter. It was also reported that Dr. Allen Bergin of BYU had prepared an excellent paper refuting the major claims made by homosexuals and that this paper could be helpful to the University and the Church in counteracting the rather sophisticated pro-homosexuality platform espoused by the anonymous [p. 7] letter which the General Authorities and others had received.” (Minutes – Executive Committee Meeting, September 15, 1977)\n\n579:\n\n“[p. v] The Mormon culture lags far behind as born out by the lecture given by Dr. Reed Payne to his beginning psychology class at BYU in the Spring of 1977.… My letter to Dr. Payne has given me hope.…\n\n[p. 1] I was homosexual long before any kind of sexual experience.… I obeyed all the counsel of the Church explicitly and faithfully. No one could have been more determined or confident. It was an absolute desire. Prayer, fasting, and faithful allegiance to the Church were to the spirit and to the letter. I developed stomach ulcers as a result and came close to bleeding to death several times before the doctors could get the hemorrhaging stopped. No one could understand why I had ulcers, and I couldn’t bring myself to tell anyone about my horrible problem. My parents were desperate, and the doctors helpless but I was determined to change. I finally went to one of the General Authorities. He counseled me to put those thoughts out of my mind, to date, to think manly thoughts, be faithful to the Church, and not to wear tight pants. I could see he didn’t grasp the problem or understand its depth.…\n\nI had felt confident that through complete devotion to the Lord on a mission I would be blessed in return with the fulfillment of the greatest desire of my heart. I knew I could not marry under the circumstances, and after an excruciating evaluation, I broke my engagement. I returned to BYU and in desperation, went to the counseling services. Again, the counsel was followed but nothing changed. I sought out several other General Authorities who were supposed to be specialists in helping young men with this problem. I followed their council and that of the special professional counselor they had for this problem. Nothing changed.…\n\n[p. 2] Implicit in your lecture is the subscription to the Church-held position that homosexuality is a matter of conscious choice, an exercise of free agency.…\n\n[p. 5] At no point did I ever choose to be homosexual. I cannot count the times I have determinedly chosen to be heterosexual. I remain homosexual. I say confidently that at no particular point did you choose to be heterosexual. Your heterosexuality precedes any such superficial decision. You cannot now choose to be homosexual.…\n\n[p. 12] BYU Pre-eminent in Shock Therapy\n\nLet me tell you briefly of a young man who recently successfully completed this treatment at BYU under the direction of Dr. Ford McBride, whose work you are familiar with. He is, according to Dr. McBride, one of his ‘star cases.’… After completing a successful mission, he returned to BYU as homosexual as before. He dated, socialized and studied hard, but his desires were becoming increasingly insistent in spit of his vigorous efforts to put them behind. Try as he might, the advice given him by the Church was totally without any effect. He knew under the circumstances that he could not marry. With trepidation, he finally went to the counseling service. He was given a battery of tests and interviews, then was set up on a conditioning therapy program coupled with hypnosis and supportive counseling. He was sent to Salt Lake to magazine stores to find pictures of naked men that excited him. These were made into slides and flashed on a screen while he sat in a chair with electrodes strapped to his arms. As the pictures were shown, he was given a shock; the purpose being to couple the pain of the shock with the stimulating picture in order to condition him so that he not only disliked the shock but also the picture. This was the first time he had ever looked at pictures of naked men. He was given a [p. 13] dial to determine the strength of the shock, and was soon keeping it on full strength, as he was determined to be cured as quickly as possible. He came out of these sessions nauseated, shaking, and with mild burns on his arms. He was hypnotized and told he would no longer think homosexual thoughts but would instead have heterosexual ones. The therapy sessions progressed well, and he was sent again to Salt Lake to find pictures of nude girls which were shown to him without the shock. He was counseled to let his imagination have free play on these pictures and was to let them be the basis of his sexual fantasies. He understood what they meant.\n\nFor nearly two years this therapy lasted, during which time he felt confident that he was changing and that homosexuality was behind him. His therapist was extremely pleased and had him write a letter, stating that he was now cured through these reconditioning techniques.\n\nShortly after this, a girl friend introduced him to a friend whom I shall call Bob. Bob was talented, intelligent, and handsome. He was about to leave for a mission. Immediately upon his introduction to Bob, he knew that nothing really had changed. He felt so intensely attracted that he could no longer deny the fact to himself. They were soon great friends, and he knew that all his years of resistance to this experience and all of what had happened in therapy, painful as it had been, had not even scratched the surface of who he really always was.…\n\n[p. 14] Dr. McBride has never bothered to conduct any follow-up with my friend though an extended and detailed post-therapy program was originally promised. This young man, like many others, had never had a homosexual experience prior to therapy.… According to conditioning and ‘appetitional’ theories, he should have become heterosexual. His therapist and the counseling department believe him to be; they have his letter to prove it. He knows differently. His story can be and is duplicated over and over. Right now, young men are going into the Smith Family Living Center to be strapped with electrodes and shocked out of homosexuality.…\n\nRegardless of all official disclaimers, the Church has unwittingly come to support a ‘Playboy therapy’ of the type carried out by Drs. Thorne and McBride…” (Cloy Jenkins et al., Prologue: An Examination of the Mormon Attitude Towards Homosexuality. This was first published in 1978, as referenced above, #1745)\n\n1751:\n\n“Dear Elder Packer:\n\nI am delighted to know that you will be ‘taking on’ the sensitive subject of homosexuality in your forthcoming fireside address at BYU.…\n\nAfter our phone conversation this morning, it occurred to me that you should be informed about a recent national publication attacking Brigham Young University and the Church on the subject of homosexuality.… In view of this national publication [The Advocate], and the accusations it makes (such as ‘that the incidence of homosexuality is higher at BYU than on other college campuses across the country,’ which I doubt), your remarks are likely to get wide newspaper coverage and to be viewed by many against the background of this article and these charges. I thought you should be aware of that.” [This apparently refers to “The Heterosexual Solution: A Dilemma for Gay Mormons,” published in the February 22, 1978 edition of The Advocate, which is a distillation of The Payne Papers.] (Dallin H. Oaks to Boyd K. Packer, February 14, 1978)\n\n1754:\n\n“This is my final report on this matter [Prologue], unless you have counsel or direction on what further we might do.…\n\n2. Hal Visick and I continue of the opinion that any direct legal action by the University against the publishers would be counter-productive, arousing greater public attention and resentment than any benefit to be gained.\n\n3. We are still unaware of the identity of the authors.…\n\nI believe it would be best for us now to let this matter drop.” (Dallin H. Oaks to Jeffrey R. Holland [Church Commissioner of Education], November 9, 1978)\n\n1755:\n\n“May I briefly report what we have already given to the Presiding Bishopric and will be giving to the First Presidency this Friday.\n\nThe assignment was to recommend specific steps the Church might take in combating homosexuality and other sexual misconduct. Our basic theme is that truth lies with the scriptures and prophets, not with secular data or debate.\n\nOur specific response is in two parts. Part one is a review of the means by which the ‘opposition’ attempts to indoctrinate our people. Among our exhibits are fallacious claims in the Payne papers, examples of LDS people unwittingly legitimizing worldliness (inconsistent messages from Church-related documents, the Universe advertising Seals & Crofts the same day it reported President Kimball’s talk on standards) and ‘macho’ behavior of priesthood holders as reported by their long-suffering wives.\n\nThe second part consists of examples of truth being on our side. Among the factors are:\n\nThe consistent and clear statements of inspired men.\n\nData from our own work. Dr. Elizabeth James’ dissertation, commissioned by LDS Social Services and supervised by Allen Bergin. This comprehensive study documents considerable success in treatment of homosexuality (from 33 to 60% success) even when using rather primitive, secular methods.\n\nExplication of the developmental pattern of sexual deviance.\n\nCreation of a clinically oriented document in which sacred and secular data are gathered for guidance of parents, individuals, curriculum writers, etc.\n\nCreation of an LDS book on human behavior after the manner of Articles of Faith.\n\nCreation of a political action kid for use of member-citizens in local legislative efforts.\n\nOur presentation is two hours long so this memo is rather concise.\n\nWe hope we are properly aware of the need, when invited, to serve loyally and well without either assuming an inappropriate role or ignoring the need to firmly establish professional foundations irrespective of ties with Church headquarters.” (Victor Brown, Jr. to Robert K. Thomas [Academic Vice President, BYU], November 14, 1978)\n\n1436:\n\n“[Abstract] Bisexuality and long-term treatment were consistently associated with greater improvement than were exclusive homosexuality and short-term intervention…”\n\n[p. 108: James’s meta-analysis showed that 58% (213/370) of “exclusively homosexual – Kinsey 5-6” were “not improved,” vs. 19% (38/200) of “bisexual – Kinsey 1-4.” (Elizabeth C. James, “Treatment of Homosexuality: A Reanalysis and Synthesis of Outcome Studies,” PhD dissertation, BYU, December 1978. Note that the dissertation, as stated in #1755 above, was commissioned by LDS Social Services and that Allen Bergin was her supervisor.)\n\n1756:\n\n“I am writing you because I am informed that Elder Thomas S. Monson, in behalf of the committee that President Marion G. Romney chairs, has suggested that we work through you on the financial details of this important project, which was the subject of separate presentations to the First Presidency, the Twelve, the Presiding Bishopric, and the Presidency of the First Quorum of the Seventy.\n\nI understand that the work of Daniel H. Ludlow on an ecclesiastical document is contemplated to conclude by December 31, 1979, and that the work of Victor Brown, Jr. and Allen Bergin on a book with professional standing, to be published with an eastern publisher, is contemplated to be completed at that same time. [A total budget of $96,577.00 was requested.]” (Dallin H. Oaks to Bishop J. Richard Clarke, March 7, 1979)\n\n1757:\n\n“President Oaks also made reference to recent Utah State legislation, House Bill No. 80 which amended Section 53-45-5 of the Utah Code, which now provides that ‘Members of the police or security department of any college or university shall be appointed by the governing board of such institution and when so appointed shall be peace officers and shall also have all of the powers possessed by policemen in cities and by sheriffs.’ Elsewhere in the Act, any ‘police officer employed by any college or university’ is characterized as a Category I officer with statewide jurisdiction, subject only to other provisions of the Code which require cooperation, notice to local officers, etc.…\n\nThe following resolution was proposed:…\n\nIt is further resolved that the designation and appointment as set forth in this resolution shall extend, hereafter, to all officers of the Brigham Young University Security/Police who are duly and routinely employed by Brigham Young University.\n\nAction: Resolution approved.”\n\n(Minutes – Board Meeting, May 2, 1979)\n\n1758:\n\n“Statewide Jurisdiction of BYU Security\n\nElliot Cameron reported on the Chipman case and on the status of the statewide jurisdiction of BYU Security. It was suggested that President Oaks might discuss the statewide jurisdiction of BYU Security and also clarify the statement concerning BYU’s policy regarding homosexuals at both the student assembly and at the annual fall faculty meeting.” (Minutes of the President’s Weekly Meeting, August 1, 1979)\n\n1760:\n\n“Dear Elder Monson,\n\nLast week Professors Victor Brown, Jr. and Allen Bergin met with Robert K. Thomas and me, at their request, to express reservations about their ability to achieve the goals of this project under the arrangements previously established. After hearing their concerns and considering other things known to us, Brother Thomas and I share their concerns. Consequently, I am writing this letter to suggest significant modifications in the goals and procedures for carrying out this important project.\n\nAs you recall, this project was launched at the suggestion of Messrs. Brown and Bergin, communicated first to the First Presidency, then with the Twelve, and finally with a large group of General Authorities. The first detailed information I had of this project was what I learned when I was invited to hear the presentation to the General Authorities. Since it did not come through educational channels, responsible B.Y.U. administrators were not part of the original definition of the project, though we were asked to carry it out according to the terms and conditions defined by the Brown-Bergin presentation. My letter of March 7, 1979 to Bishop J. Richard Clark submitted a request for funding, which was granted in a sufficient amount to support Messrs. Brown and Bergin and the related work of Dan Ludlow through December 31, 1979. I understand that Brother Ludlow’s work will be completed by that date.\n\nThe objective of the project was to prepare a manuscript along the lines outlined by Victor Brown, Jr. in his oral presentation, which would set forth significant empirical evidence in support of the Church’s position on homosexuality. The Church would fund the project. The resulting book was to be published by a press having nothing to do with the Church in order to magnify its acceptability in the scholarly community and among non-Mormons.\n\nSubsequent events have persuaded Messrs. Brown and Bergin—and Robert K. Thomas and I agree—that our objective to present the evidence in this manner with maximum effect cannot be achieved. During recent professional conferences involving related scholarly work, Allen Bergin has been specifically questioned about whether he lacks objectivity because his scholarly work was thought to be supported or directed by the Church. He is persuaded—and we think he is right—that for him to complete this book under the conditions outlined (including direct Church funding and the necessary review by persons representing the Church) would seriously erode his professional standing—a major loss in the credibility with which he will continue to serve the Church during his entire scholarly career—and significantly reduce the desired impact of the book.\n\nWhile we are persuaded that we cannot achieve the original objectives to the extent hoped, we also believe that these objectives are so important that we need to achieve them to the maximum extent possible. After discussing the matter thoroughly, Robert K. Thomas and I propose the following, which has the full support of Brown and Bergin, as the best possible alternative:\n\nDrop Allen Bergin as a co-author of the book, but retain him as a consultant, whose input will increase the quality of the book.\n\nComplete the book with Victor Brown as sole author, with consultation by Allen Bergin and with such review and suggestions by a General Authority(ies) consultant as are deemed appropriate for a university publication on this subject.\n\nDiscontinue direct Church funding of the project as of December 31, 1979 (when the current funding runs out). Thereafter, complete the effort on the book through the normal funding channels pertaining to scholarly work in the Church Educational System.\n\nPublish the book in the BYU Press, if acceptable for such publication.\n\nEncourage Allen Bergin to continue research and writing in this subject area, using conventional University procedures and resources and conventional scholarly outlets.\n\nThe foregoing proposal will put this whole project back into the channels in which, in my judgment, it should have originated—the normal Church Educational System and the Brigham Young University creative channels as to funding and supervision.…” (Dallin H. Oaks to Thomas S. Monson, September 13, 1979)\n\n2233:\n\n“Brigham Young University says its security police staked out homosexual bars in Salt Lake City to investigate homosexual activity at the Mormon-owned school, but stopped the practice once administrators learned of it.\n\nPaul Richards, director of public relations for the university, confirmed yesterday allegations by the American Civil Liberties Union that security officers ventured off campus and wrote letters to a homosexual-orientated newspaper soliciting responses as part of a crackdown on homosexuals.\n\nThe Mormon Church has a strict ban on homosexuality.\n\n‘Those things were done,’ Mr. Richards said. ‘But when President [Dallin] Oaks got involved, he said, “Cut that out right now.”’\n\nMr. Richards said the surveillance had occurred more than a year ago, before the Utah Legislature approved a controversial bill giving peace officer status to campus police.” (“Brigham Young U. Admits Stakeouts on Homosexuals,” September 27, 1979, p. A16)\n\n3070:\n\n“Sunday’s demonstration lasted 45 minutes and was the first gay rights march to be approved by the Salt Lake City Council.…\n\n‘We were expecting about 40 demonstrators, but as it turned out fewer came,’ he said. ‘This march was orderly and legal.’” (Daily Universe, October 5, 1981)\n\n1434:\n\n“[p. 1] In the early 1970s students who confessed homosexual tendencies were referred to the BYU Counseling Center. Steve, then a BYU professor, went through this counseling program and received what he called ‘the shock treatment,’ similar to the therapy sometimes used by psychologist to help patients stop smoking.\n\nJon, a former BYU student who is gay, described this treatment as experiencing an electrical shock well viewing a pornographic picture of a male. The patient would then be shown a pornographic picture of the female without electric shock.\n\nWhen asked about this treatment, a former BYU counselor said that ‘aversive therapy—not shock treatment’—had been used in the past. Mild electric stimulus was used in conjunction with slides of males and females in various stages of dress.\n\nBut, according to this counselor, ‘Even the raciest pictures wouldn’t be considered pornography.’…\n\nDave, a former BYU student, said he knew two gay students in 1973 who, threatened with expulsion from the University, we’re persuaded to work for security as spies. ‘Security was obnoxious and new how to push people into things they didn’t want to do,’ said Dave. Apparently a few of the spies became fed up with such tactics and went to TV stations in Salt Lake City to tell their story publicly. ‘After that blew over things were quiet for a while,’ said Dave.…\n\n[p. 12] Wrote Williams, ‘No one knows what causes homosexuality. However, we do know one thing that does not cause homosexuality and that is free choice. Until the cause or causes are known it is grossly inappropriate to moralize about it.’…\n\nOne month later on March 5, Elder Boyd K. Packer addressed a BYU 12-stake Fireside in which he directed his talk toward homosexuals.\n\nElder Packer’s comments, published by the Church under the title ‘To the One,’ reflected and emphasized the Church’s policy on homosexuals. He used the word ‘homosexual’ only once in his address. ‘Please notice that I use it as an adjective, not as a noun. I reject it as a noun. I repeat, I accept that word as an adjective to describe a temporary condition. I reject it as a noun naming a permanent one.’…\n\nAnother significant event during this time concerned action taken by the Utah Legislature. During its 1977-78 interim the Transportation and Public Safety Study Committee headed by Public Safety Commissioner Larry Lunnen made a study to re-define the authority of various law enforcement agencies throughout the state, including BYU Security.\n\nAs a result of the study the Legislature passed House Bill 80 giving BYU Security officers 24 hour jurisdiction throughout the state.\n\nIn addition to that, the bill read ambiguously, ‘Members of the police and security department of any college or university shall also have the power to enforce all rules and regulations promulgated by the governing board of such an institution.’…\n\nThis rebuttal [to the Payne letter] also gave a brief conclusion of the unfinished study being done for LDS Social Services. ‘There is no scientific evidence that homosexual behavior is the inevitable product of biological or environmental influences. However, there is evidence that agency is involved. Homosexuality can be changed.’\n\nAccording to one BYU professor, the rebuttal was so poorly done that ‘it was an embarrassment to all involved,’ and most of the copies were given back to the authors at their request.…\n\nIn Homosexuality, a Church handbook distributed to stake presidents and bishops, the Church policies and procedures are spelled out. ‘As we have previously stated, homosexuality is a sin in the same degree as adultery and fornication.’\n\nThe handbook emphasizes that ‘homosexuality is a learned behavior, and as such can be changed.’ The handbook states that ‘Modern day prophets have clearly promised that homosexuality can be changed. You should convey this positive attitude because it encourages change.… Be careful not to label people “homosexual.” It is better to refer to their “homosexual behavior” than to call them a homosexual.’…\n\nBecause the modern day prophets have clearly promised that homosexuality can be conquered, those ‘rebellious’ homosexuals who believe otherwise are subject to excommunication from the Church.\n\nIn Welfare Services Packet One, instructions to bisohps and stake presidents concerning homosexuals include, ‘An attitude of stiffneckedness and rebellion is almost always a clear indication of the need to be sternly disciplined, even to excommunication, so that others are not contaminated by unclean habits.’\n\nAnother procedure of repentance was outlined by the Church handbook. ‘Since homosexual behavior is possible only with others, the individual should disclose his sexual partners as an essential part of repentance. The purpose is to help save others.…\n\nElder Boyd K. Packer said the following: ‘There is a falsehood that some are born with an attraction to their own kind, with nothing they can do about it. They are just “that way” and can only yield to those desires. That is a malicious and destructive lie. While it is convincing to some, it is of the devil.’” (Dean Huffaker, “Homosexuality at BYU,” Seventh East Press, April 12, 1982)\n\n2253:\n\n“[p. 224] Instead of simply offering advice church leaders began to encourage practicing or would be homosexuals to undertake a new type of therapy introduced to BYU in the 1970s. This method, known as aversion therapy, involved the use of electric shock treatment to change behavior.…\n\nAlong with aversion therapy, the church also stepped up surveillance and spying, particularly at BYU, which became a focal point of the attack against gays. In one famous incident, an undercover agent for the BYU security department placed an ad in the gay newspaper asking to meet gay students. A student responded to the ad, an advance was made, and the student was arrested.…\n\nAt the peak of the campaign against gays, the BYU security force was granted statewide power by the Mormon-dominated legislature, an action that was widely interpreted as directed against gays. Soon after this authority was granted, BYU security joined the Utah highway patrol in a raid at a rest stop on Highway I-15 between Provo (where the BYU campus is situated) and Salt Lake City. Acting on the tip that the rest stop and its bathroom were a gay hangout, several people were rounded up, including, as it turned out, a BYU instructor. That night, according to members of the gay community, the instructor hanged himself in jail. Though hushed up publicly, word about the incident quickly spread on the gate underground with devastating effect. Fears about discovery, already deep, further intensified.…\n\n[p. 225] Aversion therapy was suspended, although a less intensive practice, described by a psychologist in the BYU Comprehensive Clinic as ‘coversive therapy,’ that is the association of negative thoughts with pictures, was employed.… (Robert Gottlieb and Peter Wiley, America’s Saints: The Rise of Mormon Power (New York: G. P. Putnam’s Sons, 1984))\n\n3072:\n\n“Leon, a convert to Mormonism and a former BYU student, was asked to leave the university after one of his roommates informed on him. ‘My biggest mistake was having another gay roommate along with two straight ones, he says. ‘I was told I could stay at school if I informed on other gays. I just couldn’t do that.’…\n\nAnother headline event was the apprehension of a man in drag who was found cruising the men’s washroom in the university’s Phys Ed building. A clear plastic door has since been placed on the men’s sauna room so school officials can monitor what goes on inside, undercover security police patrol the swimming area and locker rooms, and the old witchhunts of the past are starting up again, Steve says, but this time it’s a lot quieter.” (Jonathan Stevens, “Mormon Gays,” The Body Politic, September, 1985, p. 35)\n\n2336:\n\n“Brigham Young University may soon have to face the question of what to do about an avowed homosexual, but celibate, professor.\n\nThree weeks ago, officials at the Mormon Church-owned school summoned Thomas Matthews, an assistant professor in the Spanish department, to a discussion about his homosexuality.…\n\nAnd though Matthews says he has been celibate, he is increasingly public about being gay.\n\n’I started coming out in private conversations about a year ago,’ he said this week. ‘I was tired of answering questions about why I am 39 and not married.’…\n\nThe discussion was prompted by another person’s call to the church’s general authorities, Matthew said.\n\nHe said he did not know who that person was.\n\n’But rather than calling me, the authorities called my department chair,’ he said.…\n\nBYU has no policy on celibate homosexuals among the faculty, said spokeswoman Carrie Jenkins.” (“BYU May Face Decision On Gay, But Celibate, Language Professor,” Salt Lake Tribune, July 22, 1995)\n\n4056:\n\n“[p. 267] One of the projects which grew out of the Institute for Studies in Human Behavior and Values was a book written by Victor L. Brown, Jr., Human Intimacy: Illusion and Reality. Alan E. Bergin originally worked on this book is a co-author, but moved into the background when the project became a church-sponsored product, instead of a more narrowly focused professional work. The book was [p. 268] published by Parliament Publishers in Salt Lake City, Utah, not by the church publishing arm, Deseret, in an attempt to dissociate the book from the official church, and thus promote an acceptance of its contents by non-LDS therapists. Despite this dissociation, church headquarters sent copies of this book to every bishop and stake president in the entire church, thus promoting the work as a quasi-official LDS philosophy of sex.…”\n\n(Eric Gottfrid Swedin, “‘You are healing souls:’ A History of Psychotherapy Within the Modern Latter-day Saint Community,” PhD dissertation, Case Western Reserve University, January 1996)\n\n3082:\n\n“A piece called ‘The Cure Program’ is more ominous. The work was inspired by Meyers’ research into aversion therapy, a homosexual ‘cure’ program performed for several years at BYU (a program whose existence is still denied by many Mormons) that began as part of the dissertation by Max Ford McBride in 1976, who called his program ‘Affect of Visual Stimuli in Electric Aversion Therapy.’ The process required gay male subjects to be strapped to an electroshock machine with a rubber ring attached to their penises. Photos of naked men were flashed on a screen and if the subjects got an erection, they would receive a shock on the arm.\n\nMeyers’ piece consists of three large wooden ‘electric’ chairs, replete with menacing metal headpieces. The chairs sit on rubber triangular platforms (representative of the pink triangles Nazis tattooed on homosexuals on their way to concentration camps). In front of each chair sits a podium. Scrolls of paper hang over the front of each podium, onto which slides of nude men from gay porno magazines will be projected during the gallery installation. The scrolls of paper become shredded and will cover the gallery floor. Meyers means the shredded paper to represent secrecy. ‘Although aversion therapy has long since been discontinued,’ Meyer says, ‘I think shock treatment is a metaphor for what the church still does by denying homosexuality—it’s a way of killing off part of our humanity.’\n\nThe electric-chair imagery in ‘The Cure Program’ is more starkly brutal than Meyers’ other pieces. The center chair’s front legs rise up to form a cross, implying that the church’s attempts to quash homosexuality is a mind of modern-day crucifixion. It is with this piece that any questions are put to rest about how viscerally damaged Meyers feels.” (Marsha Barber, “Gallery of Defiance,” Private Eye Weekly, April 4, 1996, p. 16)\n\n3086:\n\n“Don Harryman attended BYU in the mid 1970’s and went through the aversion therapy program. ‘The way the Mormons viewed it, {homosexuality} was practically worse than being a murderer, and it was spoken about as often,’ he tells me. ‘I was desperate to change my sexuality.’ A school counselor promised that aversion therapy would do the trick. ‘They have an instrument that you put on {your penis} that measures an erection. The shock would come to your arm randomly, {and it was} very painful.’ At first, the therapy seemed to work. ‘I hadn’t ever had sex {with a man} to begin with,’ Harryman recalls, ‘and I just got used to not thinking about it.’ But the ‘cure’ didn’t last long, Harryman notes: ‘Six months later, a new roommate moved in and I fell in love and was sexual with him within 24 hours. It was like the lights going on and me saying, “Wow, this was all a sham!”’\n\nWhile BYU has since abandoned electroshock treatments for homosexuals, Harryman—who now lives in Hawaii, where he is involved in the Hawaii Equal Rights Marriage Project—claims that some church leaders as recently as two years ago were quietly referring people to outside doctors who perform electroshock therapy. And the Mormon Church today promotes its own kind of Aversion Therapy Lite, offering counseling and group therapy aimed at ‘curing’ Mormon men and women who have same-sex desires.” (Michelangelo Signorile, “The Secret History of Mormons,” Out magazine, August, 1996, p. 26)\n\n4033:\n\n“In July 1995, after an unidentified person called a general authority, BYU officials met with [Thomas] Matthews to discuss his sexuality. ‘There are a lot of reasons why I’m leaving BYU,’ Matthews recently told the Associated Press. ‘Obviously, the most crucial one is that I’m gay and I’m out of the closet and BYU doesn’t like it.” (“Gay Professor Leaves University,” Sunstone, December 1996, p. 74)\n\n1422:\n\n“Professor O’Donovan:\n\nBYU provides counseling to students with same-sex attraction and does not use aversive therapies, torturous or otherwise. Shock therapy is not used at BYU. We have not been able to verify your assertion that electric shock therapy was being used as late as 1986, or that electric shock was ever used on gay and lesbian students at BYU. If you have documentation of such treatment you may wish to share that information with us.” (Merrill J. Bateman, BYU President, to Connell O’Donovan, April 9, 1997)\n\n597, 2628:\n\n“At the outset of this lecture I feel it is imperative that you all know of my agenda, since I do not subscribe to the theory of academic objectivity. First, I am Queer, and by that I mean that I participate politically, spiritually, socially, and intellectually in a community of men-loving-men. (But don’t ask me to define what a man is! I’m still working on that one!) Second, I was raised a Mormon, completed a mission for the Latter-Day Saint Church, and married a woman in the Salt Lake Mormon Temple, but due to the homophobia and heterosexism I encountered in the church, I came to realize that for me the only viable solution was to explore spirituality on my own path. I was later officially excommunicated by the Mormon Church for my stance opposing their oppression of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered people.…\n\nI am not here to whine about my own victimization at the hands of the homophobic Mormon patriarchy. I am here to document and publicize the hypocrisy of an institution that publicly proclaims “family values”, compassion, honor, and love while privately destroying the lives of tens of thousands of people because they happen to love those of their own sex.…\n\nThrough interviews I conducted with older Lesbian and Gay Mormons, I learned that in the mid-1940s, during the administration of BYU President Howard McDonald, there was a large social network of about 30 Lesbians and Gay men, most of whom were staff and faculty, and only included a handful of very trusted students. They gathered informally at private homes to meet for support and to find partners. In the spring of 1948, two members of this group, Kent Taylor and Richard Snow, met with Mormon Church President, George Albert Smith (who was also allegedly a homosexual). During this meeting, the church president told the two lovers that they need only live their lives honorably and God would accept them. These two men came back to their social network and joyfully reported their experience.…\n\nIn early 1959, as a way of controlling student behavior, Wilkinson vigorously proposed and supported a plan to have the Dean of Students send questionnaires to all Mormon bishops affiliated with BYU. The questionnaires would have required that the bishops report to the school administration the names of all students who had confessed privately to the bishops “any propensity for stealing or immorality of anything of that kind”, effectively breaking the secrecy of the confessional. On May 21 1959, according to his own office journal, Wilkinson met with BYU’s Executive Committee of the Board of Trustees to discuss two controversial topics: Wilkinson’s plan to implement the questionnaires, and “the growing problem in our society of homosexuality”. Wilkinson reported that “these two problems interested the Brethren very, very much”.\n\nA member of the Executive Committee informed Wilkinson that Mormon Church president David O. McKay, in a recent secret meeting in the Salt Lake Temple, had said that “in his view homosexuality was worse than immorality; that it is a filthy and unnatural habit”. Thus Wilkinson was informed by the Executive Committee that whenever a student had this “problem”, unless the student was “really repentant and immediately working out their problems”, the BYU administration “should suspend them from the University”. This was the first of several similar policy decisions made covertly by the Board of Trustees and Executive Committees.…\n\nOn July 10, 1964, apostle Spencer Kimball gave a speech at BYU to all religion teacher entitled “A Counselling Problem in the Church”. Seven out of the 20 pages of this speech deal specifically with homosexuality. In his speech Kimball notes that he is “persuaded to consider briefly [an] area of trouble which has been more in the background but which now is being written about…and is being brought out into the limelight….including deviates called ‘peeping toms’, exhibitionists, homosexuals, and perverts in other areas.” Kimball then admonishes the religion faculty to “be helpful in these areas as you indoctrinate in the preventive spiritual medicine”, acknowledging that in reference to the “abominable and detestable crime against nature…we know such a disease is curable”.\n\nAix months later, Kimball was back at BYU to speak, but this time the entire student body heard his lecture called “Love versus Lust”. Indicating that “sometimes masturbation is the introduction to the more serious sins of exhibitionism and the gross sin of homosexuality”, Kimball wishes to avoid mentioning “these unholy terms and the reprehensible practices” but he has a “responsibility to the youth of Zion that they be not deceived”. Here is a lengthy quote from this speech:\n\nGood men, wise men, God-fearing men everywhere…denounce the practice [of homosexuality] as being unworthy of sons of God; and Christ’s Church denounces it and condemns it so long as men have bodies which can be defiled….This heinous homosexual sin is of the ages. Many cities have gone out of existence because of it. It was present in Israel’s wandering days, tolerated by the Greeks, and found in the baths of corrupt Rome. In Exodus, the law required death for the culprit who had sex play with animals, the deviate who committed incest, or the depraved one who had homosexual or other vicious practices.\n\n“This is a most unpleasant subject to dwell upon, but I am pressed to speak of it boldly so that no student in this University, nor youth in the Church, will ever have any question in his mind as to the illicit and diabolical nature of this perverse program. Again, Lucifer deceives and prompts logic and rationalization which will destroy men and make them servants of Satan forever….Let it never be said that the Church avoided condemning this obnoxious practice not that it has winked at this abominable sin. And I feel certain that this University will never knowingly enroll an unrepentant person who follows these practices nor tolerate on its campus anyone with these tendencies who fails to repent and put his or her life in order.”\n\nThis extremely homophobic speech later appeared in the 1965 BYU Speeches of the Year and a decade later was made into a pamphlet for general distribution to the church.…\n\nThis dramatic increase in identified Gays and Lesbians spurred the BYU administration to begin what is often referred to by Gay Mormons as the “Witch Hunts of ’68”. Authorities were convinced that a large “homosexual ring” was located on campus. Extensive security files were kept on students suspected of homosexuality, and all new prospective teachers had to be interviewed by a general authority before being offered a position at BYU.…\n\nOne former Gay BYU student referred to only as LML reported to a newspaper that in 1968, he was coerced into turning over names of other Gays at BYU to the church administration in order to help absolve him of his “sins”. A week later, the same newspaper received a letter to the editor by one of the people whom LML had turned in, confirming the story in a very dramatic and emotional manner.…\n\nOne year after his appointment to the presidency, Oaks brought the issue of homosexuality to the Board of Trustees for further discussion. Specifically, Oaks wanted to know what to do with students or school personnel who were not “overtly” homosexual.\n\nThese questions brought up several issues that the church had yet to deal with, so apostle Marvin Ashton was given the task of helping BYU clarify their policies on homosexuality.\n\nAfter working with Apostle Ashton, on May 1973, the Executive Committee instructed President Oaks that “no known overt homosexuals were to be enrolled or permitted to remain at BYU as students or employees”.…\n\nAnother tactic taken by BYU administration was the creation of extensive student spy networks. The BYU Honor Code of the 60s and early 70s mandated that students report any infractions of the Honor Code to the Standards Office, even if anonymously. This allowed the Standards Office and BYU Campus Security to engage in practices that were anything but honorable, in order to maintain the honor code. Campus security visited Gay bars in Salt Lake City, noting car license plate numbers with BYU parking stickers and turning that information over to the Standards Office. Decoys were used to entrap male students in bathrooms. Students could even gain credit for posing as Gay decoys by signing up for the Justice Administration 299R course. In 1973, for example, two Gay BYU students were caught and threatened with expulsion from the school. However, they were then informed that they could remain at BYU if they would “work for [BYU] security as spies” to entrap other Gays attending BYU. They decided to do this. A man named David, who knew these two students, reported to a newspaper that BYU “Security was obnoxious and knew how to push people into things they didn’t want to do”. Apparently, several other Gays who had been coerced into spying for security became “fed up” with the situation and went to TV stations in Salt Lake City with their stories. With such negative publicity focused on BYU, the Security Office became less aggressive in their tactics for awhile.…\n\nIn a 1975 interview with the Salt Lake Tribune, President Oaks was asked “if BYU security agents checked known homosexual haunts looking for BYU students”. Oaks replied that he personally didn’t know, but “he wouldn’t be surprised if security officers had made such investigations over a period of time”. Joseph Morrow, a BYU security guard in 1973, claimed that such investigations of Gay spaces were commonplace in the early 1970s. Morrow stated that once he was asked by his supervisor, Paul Tanner, “to go to Salt Lake City to check for BYU Parking permits on cars gathered around specific bars. The bars…were known homosexual haunts.” When Morrow expressed reticence over the assignment, he was told “it was a regular weekend practice”.…\n\nIn January 1975, BYU administration decided to begin another purge of Queer people on campus. The first target of the purge was the Drama Department.…\n\nOthers however, found no humor in this situation at all. The October 1975 issue of the Advocate, carried an article by Robert McQueen about the Mormon Church and homosexuality. McQueen, a former Mormon would later become the editor in chief and then chairman of the Board of Trustees of the Advocate until his death from AIDS in 1989. In this 1975 article, McQueen reported that five Gay men he had known at BYU had gotten caught in the Purge of ’75, were coerced into therapy, expelled from BYU, outed by church officials, and then excommunicated. Rather than face the bigotry of family, friends, church, and state, each one committed suicide. Another man who was caught in that purge remembers that a BYU professor shot and killed himself that year after being entrapped at a local off campus restroom.…\n\nIn 1976, Ford McBride completed his 102 page doctoral dissertation on the “Effect of Visual Stimuli in Electric Aversion Therapy”, under the direction of the aforementioned D. Eugene Thorne. For his dissertation, McBride and Thorne used 14 Gay male subjects in electric aversive conditioning and assertion training. The purpose of this study was to discover whether using pornographic photos of men and women was helpful in aversion therapy. In the Mormon weltannschaung, the end certainly justifies the means: heterosexuality must be attained AT ANY COST – even if it means using pornography, which the Mormon Church is usually vehemently opposed to.\n\nThe 14 Gay men were compared after being “treated” on an out-patient basis during 22 sessions of shock therapy. Each of the 22 sessions lasted 50 minutes. 10 of those minutes were spent in “assertive training” and the remaining 40 minutes in “aversive conditioning”. the average duration of treatment for the men was three months. As you can see here in the transparency, the release form these men were required to sign informed them that “damage to tissure or organs may occur”, that they would be looking at “sensitive materials” possibly contrary to their values [ie. pornography], and that BYU would be released from any responsibility for any damages done to them.…\n\nBYU and church officials grew so alarmed about the homosexual “ring” on campus that in 1976 they established the Institute for Studies in Values and Human Behavior on campus (hereafter Values Institute), with psychology professor Allen Bergin as director. The Values Institute was charged with producing a manuscript “which would set forth significant empirical evidence in support of the Church’s position on homosexuality”. This book, funded by the church, would be written for a “New York Times type of audience” by Bergin and Victor L. Brown Jr., approved of by at least one general authority, published by a popular eastern press, and made to appear as though it had no ties at all to the church. The resulting book would then be available as “secular evidence” to back up the church’s anti-Gay stance.…\n\nUltimately the institute’s greatest challenge came from an unexpected quarter: Gay BYU undergraduate student Cloy Jenkins. About June 1977, after attending an anti-Gay lecture by BYU psychology professor I. Reed Payne (coincidentally a member of the Values Institute), Jenkins quickly prepared a lengthy but thoughtful response to Payne’s lecture, calling for a “well reasoned dialogue on these issues”. After getting help from two friends in editing his essay (now published by Prometheus Press as a pamphlet entitled Prologue), Jenkins had copies of it mailed to various church officials. Jenkins’s paper was soon circulating among faculty and administration at both BYU and Ricks College, as well as television and radio stations, and newspapers throughout Utah and Idaho.\n\nhe church’s reaction was immediate. According to a social services counselor at BYU, Jenkins’s paper caused “a real stir at BYU and in the Church – officials in both places are very touchy over it”. Allen Bergin, as director of the Values Institute, was directed by LDS Social Services and the BYU Comprehensive Clinic to prepare a rebuttal. This proved to be difficult, however, because Jenkins had made several “really good and undisputable points”, his figures on the numbers of Gays at BYU were accurate, and, according to BYU’s Executive Committee, he had used a “rather sophisticated pro-homosexuality platform”. Bergin finished his rebuttal on August 22, 1977 and titled it “A Reply to Unfounded Assertions Regarding Homosexuality”. BYU’s executive committee immediately hailed it as “an excellent paper refuting [the] major claims” of Jenkins. Despite this initial optimism, one BYU professor said that Bergin’s rebuttal on behalf of the church was actually so poorly written that “it was an embarrassment to all involved”. Word went out that “all copies be returned [to Bergin] as he hopes to rewrite his reply.” Apparently, Bergin did try to rewrite his response, but without much success. Bergin’s colleague, Victor L. Brown, Jr., also tried to rebut Jenkins, but his response was so poorly done that it was never released to the public.\n\nWhen it became apparent that no authoritative response was forthcoming from the Values Institute, the church hierarchy decided to intervene personally. Church President Spencer Kimball asked Apostle Boyd K. Packer to “specifically address the local problem of homosexuality and to offer solutions” to BYU students. Packer at first declined the assignment, something almost unheard of in the higher church councils, but when pressed again urgently by Kimball, Packer decided to speak to an assembly of BYU students in early March, 1978. At the same time, the Advocate, a national Gay news magazine, was also preparing to publish excerpts from Jenkins’s paper in its 22 February issue. When BYU president Dallin Oaks found out about the upcoming Advocate article he then drafted a letter to Packer, warning that “in view of this national publication, and the accusations it makes…your [upcoming] remarks are likely to get wide newspaper coverage and to be viewed by many against the background of this article and these charges.”\n\nOn March 5, 1978, Packer delivered his now-infamous “To the One” speech during a twelve-stake fireside at BYU. [EXCERPT p. 2]Although the entire speech dealt with homosexuality, Packer used the word “homosexual” only once because he felt that Mormons “can very foolishly cause things we are trying to prevent by talking too much about them”. This is not Packer’s only theory about the causes of homosexuality – and causation was vital, because, for Packer, finding the cause was an “essential step in developing a cure”. Packer theorized that the cause of homosexuality “will turn out to be a very typical form of selfishness”.…\n\nMeanwhile, church and BYU administrators were desperately trying to find Cloy Jenkins to bring a law suit against him – for “the misleading representations in this publication [as] a violation of the postal laws and regulations”. In a November 1978 report to LDS church commissioner of education Jeffrey R. Holland, Dallin Oaks summarized BYU’s unsuccessful attempts to track down the author, and recommended that “it would be best for us now to let this matter drop” because “any direct action by the University against the publishers would be counterproductive, arousing greater public attention [than] any benefit to be gained.”…\n\nOn September 13, 1979 Oaks wrote to Apostle Thomas Monson to explain the problems of the “Bergin-Brown Book on Values” and to inform church officials that school administrators had become persuaded “that we cannot achieve the original objectives to the extent hoped” by having the book appear through the “independent popular publisher”.…\n\nThat same year [1992] the BYU Counseling Center was up for reaccreditation by the American Psychological Association. All staff members at the Counseling Center were told during a staff meeting to destroy and/or falsify all records pertaining to homosexual clients, so that the Center could maintain its accreditation.…\n\nEven when confronted with the various documents from out of BYU’s own archives, including Ford McBride’s 1976 Phd dissertation at BYU, Merrill Bateman refused to recant his statement that electric shock therapy was never used at BYU on Queer students.…” (Connell O’Donovan, “Private Pain, Public Purges: A History of Homosexuality at Brigham Young University,” Delivered April 28, 1997, University of California, Santa Cruz)\n\n3098:\n\n“U.N. councils face substantial pressure to adopt legal norms that pose a threat to family stability — pressure coming as a result of often one-sided influence of lobbies hostile to traditional family, religious and cultural values, said Richard Wilkins, BYU law professor and director of NGO Family Voice: The World Family Policy Center.\n\nWilkins has been involved with the center for three years. The center is a joint project of the J. Reuben Clark Law School, the David M. Kennedy Center for International Studies and the School of Family Sciences.…\n\nThe center hosts the annual World Family Policy Forum for world leaders and diplomats every January in Provo.

Eugene Thorne, head of BYU’s Psychology Dept. By 1968, he had gained enough information to report his findings from BYU in a paper given in San Francisco that year for the annual convention of the American Psychological Association. Then in 1969, school administration became more careful in its use of controversial therapies for treating “sexual deviancy” as they put it. The administration publicly claimed that use of such therapies had been curtailed but unofficially they continued unabated. BYU’s Academic Vice President, Robert Thomas, advised college deans to alert those who were using aversive therapies to be “particularly cautious in utilizing them” not because they might prove harmful per se, but out of fear for law suits.…\n\nMax Ford McBride’s PhD dissertation, completed in August 1976 under the direction of BYU psychology professor D. Eugene Thorne (note that Dr. I. Reed Payne, of the “Payne Papers” infamy, was also on his dissertation committee), is an excellent example of clinical dehumanization practiced by Mormon “therapists”. In the Mormon worldview, the end certainly justifies the means: heterosexuality must be attained and maintained AT ANY COST – even if it means using pornography (which the Mormon Church is usually vehemently opposed to) and physical torture.\n\nUnder the oversight of his committee chairman, Dr. Thorne, McBride experimented on fourteen Gay male subjects to determine if using photographs of nude men and women from Playgirl- and Playboy-type magazines was helpful in electric shock therapy. The 14 Gay BYU students in McBride’s study were compared after being “treated” on an out-patient basis during 22 sessions of shock therapy. Each of the 22 sessions lasted 50 minutes. 10 of those minutes were spent in “assertive training” and the remaining 40 minutes in “aversive conditioning.” The average duration of treatment for the men was three months. The release form these men were required to sign informed them that “damage to tissue or organs may occur,” that they would be looking at “sensitive materials” possibly contrary to their values [ie. pornography], and that BYU would be released from any responsibility for any damage done to them.\n\nThe longterm effects of the electric shock “therapy” these men were subjected to has been crippling. Two of the men committed suicide soon after completing this torturous study. Every survivor I have interviewed has suffered life-long emotional, spiritual, and sometimes physical damage. In 1999, John Cameron, one of the 14 men who went through this horrific experience in 1976 when he was a 23 year old BYU student and member of the Young Ambassadors, wrote to me, “For 22 years now I have lived with the scars of the experience – unable to articulate a personal suffering and longing that have almost crippled me….I didn’t completely come out of the closet until I was 34, and only after much angry, pissed-off therapy. I spent a lot of money just so I could yell at my psychologist and break things in his office for an hour every week for two years. But it was a hell of a lot more fun than Ford McBride and the electrodes.”\n\nA Gay psychology intern at BYU named Ray actually assisted in giving electric shock therapy to fellow Gay men in the late 1970s. In an interview he did for Sean Weakland’s documentary on aversive therapies at BYU called Legacies, Ray gave the following report on his activities and their results (which I quote here extensively because Ray has so much “insider” knowledge):\n\n“A lot of times BYU security would catch people in compromising positions on campus. Those people would have the choice to either be kicked out of school and have their families notified about what they had done or they could go through this therapy. We had quite a few people who were going through it. There were others in the therapy who felt so much guilt for being the way they were or they had been promised that if they underwent the therapy they would be able to marry and have children and they would be turned. Of course they had to have the desire to change, and if the therapy failed (which it always did), it was their fault for the failure since they didn’t have enough desire.\n\n“Anyway, they would come in usually three times a week. I would be behind a glass one-way mirror, and they would be on the other side of it. They had their choice to look at pornographic magazines or watch porno videos. We would tape electrodes to their groin, thigh, chest and armpits. We had another machine that would monitor their breathing and heart rate. If there was a difference in their heart rate when looking at homosexual pornography, we would turn a dial which would send a current to shock them. If they were a new patient, we would use a very low current. From the reaction that I saw there were muscle spasms which looked very painful.\n\n“After that was over, we would switch the pornography over so that it was a man and a woman having sex, and we would play very soothing music in the background to try and get the mind to relate to that. For the people that had been doing the therapy longer we turned the voltage way up so that you could see burn marks on the skin and quite often they would also throw up during the therapy. This is speculation, but most of the students at BYU probably hadn’t even seen pornography before.\n\n“After undergoing that kind of pain over a number of months, everyone said that they had completely changed. They kept records for as long as the people were at BYU. After they had graduated, there was no records kept to see what kind of success rate they had. The BYU statistics were wrong because the people were lying. They were desperate to get their degree and get out of the situation. They had been blackmailed into the situation in the first place.\n\n“We did have some people who became completely asexual after undergoing the therapy. But no, we never changed anyone from gay to straight….We had several people who committed suicide during the therapy. We had three different people who hung themselves in the Harris Fine Arts Center on BYU campus.”\n\nIn the late 1970s, Carol Lynn Pearson, a famous Mormon poet whose husband Gerald Pearson was Gay, met one of Gerald’s Gay friends at BYU named Sam. Sam told Carol Lynn that “they strapped me in a chair and attached wires to me. Then they showed me porno movies of men in sexual activity. When I got turned on, they gave me a shock.” At first they just shocked his hands. “After that they added my forearms, and then my calves and thighs. That was when they started cranking up the voltage. I had to go in two or three times a week….Only it didn’t work. All I wanted was not to touch anybody, not to be with anybody. I felt like I was being turned into a zombie. I would walk down the street and be freaked by everyone. The idea of touching anyone, even my family, made me sick.” After enduring several “treatments”, Sam started to question his participation in his own torture. “I made myself walk up those steps and go into that building and sit down in that chair. And take the shocks. Until I gave up….There were burns on my arms but inside there was nothing different. Nothing! Just more pain.” Sam left and never went back.\n\nLater, Sam told Gerald and Carol Lynn Pearson about another Gay BYU student named John who had committed suicide after going through electric shock treatments at BYU. After leaving BYU both Sam and John had decided to move to Los Angeles together, although just as friends, not lovers. “We were going to drop everything and go make a new life. [John] told that to the General Authority that was on his case, and the man told him he’d be better off at the bottom of the Great Salt Lake with a millstone tied around his neck than to stay a homosexual. John believed him. He believed everything they said to him. He drove back to Provo, told his roommates he was going to the laundromat, drove up Rock Canyon, laid out a blanket, and blew his brains out.” Sam fared almost as badly as John. In 1981, after leaving a Gay bar in San Francisco, without any warning he was attacked in a vicious anti-Gay hate crime by two young men wielding a crow bar. He nearly died when they smashed his head in. Sam went through five major surgeries and $70,000 in plastic surgery to repiece his face together again. He was also blinded in one eye, which was replaced by a glass eye.\n\nI also personally recall an Affirmation meeting in 1988 when a man showed up calling himself only David. He sat alone in a corner during our meeting and became extremely jittery when anyone approached him. I spoke with him but he requested that I remain at least six feet in distance away from him. He then rolled up his shirt sleeves and showed me his arms. The deeply-scarred skin on the inside of his arms looked like raw hamburger and I almost vomitted from the sight. He informed me that he had participated in electric shock therapy at BYU in 1977 and had been allowed to turn up the voltage as high as he wanted to. The results were badly burned arms and a complete inability to come physically close to any male without him emotionally breaking down from the trauma. His homosexual desires were as strong as ever but he was unable to touch another man even for a simple hug, he had no heterosexual desires whatsoever, and he was constantly on the verge of suicide. David never returned to Affirmation and I suspect from his fragile emotional state that he did not survive his ordeal for much longer. I also met two Lesbians in 1990 at the Gay Pride festivities in Salt Lake who claimed that they had also gone through electric shock therapy at BYU in the 1970s but I was not able to conduct a formal interview and we lost contact. That is the only knowledge I have of women being subjected to this torturous treatment at the hands of so-called therapists.\n\nAnother Gay BYU student named Randy Smith went through aversion therapy at BYU in the late 1970s, but when it failed to make him heterosexual, he was excommunicated and expelled from the school. Disillusioned by his treatment by the church and school, in 1981 he organized a protest against the LDS Church during it’s semiannual conference in October. After he got legal permits to do so, he and 16 other protesters marched around Temple Square with signs and banners protesting the unethical treatment of Gays by the Mormon Church and then held a press conference, calling for the end of aversion therapies. Almost all Mormons present simply ignored the vocal protest in their midst.\n\nRobert McQueen, a Gay returned missionary and editor in chief of The Advocate, published an article on Gays at BYU called “The Heterosexual Solution: A Dilemma for Gay Mormons”, accompanied by a very intense depiction of the shock therapy, as well as a scandalous cartoon depicting Spencer Kimball, Brigham Young, and Joseph Smith showing a picture of a naked woman to two Gay men in bed together (which is essentially what McBride was doing with his “therapy” at the Y).\n\nAndrew Welch, a former Daily Utah Chronicle staff member, produced a 16 minute documentary on electric shock therapy at BYU in 1977 and early 1978. San Francisco public television station KQED helped produce the documentary, which they broadcast in July of 1978. For the documentary, Welch interviewed 40 Gay men and two BYU psychologists, and showed the electric shock therapy device being used at BYU. Utah’s PBS station, KUED, refused to air the program on these torturous practices however, citing religious differences, and the belief that the program had nothing to do with civil rights – only “morality”. (In 1982, BYU student Keith Mitchell also produced a three part documentary on homosexuality at BYU. However only the first two parts were aired. Part 3, scheduled to air on August 6, 1982, was cancelled for not meeting “the standard of accuracy set by the station”. Part 3 simply contained interviews with Gay BYU students and was thought to be “too sensational”.)\n\nDr. Eugene Thorne’s career after BYU has continued to be controversial. Thorne became co-owner and Executive Director of the Provo Canyon School (for severely “troubled teens”) in March of 1979. In Milonas v. Williams, two students named Timothy Milonas Jr. and Kenneth Rice sued Provo Canyon School administrators, including D. Eugene Thorne, for causing Milonas, Rice, and other students at the school to “suffer and to be subjected to cruel and unusual punishment, anti-therapeutic and inhumane treatment, and denial of due process of law.” The school (and Dr. Thorne) were found guilty of violating the students’ First and Fourteenth Amendment rights by monitoring and censoring student mail, using isolation rooms unnecessarily, and using physical force to coerce behavior modification. The guilty verdict was appealed but the rehearing was denied by the Court of Appeals on November 9, 1982. Despite being successfully sued for inhumane treatment of students, Thorne left the Provo Canyon School and became director of the Discovery Academy, a school similar to Provo Canyon School, but located in the city of Provo itself. Dr. Ford McBride is also currently in practice in Provo, Utah.\n\nIn April 1997 I made a call for BYU to admit what had been done to these people, apologize, and make financial reparations to them. However despite the massive evidence to the contrary, Merrill Joseph Bateman, then President of BYU and a high ranking LDS General Authority, issued a statement to me via email on April 9, 1997 in response to my call, indicating that, “we have not been able to verify your assertion that electric shock therapy…was ever used on gay and lesbian students at BYU.” At least a dozen other people over the course of several years thereafter received similar denials from Bateman or his office, when they have contacted him about this issue. To my knowledge, Bateman has never retracted his denial. Bateman is currently a member of the First Quorum of the Seventy.” (Connell O’Donovan, “’The Abominable and Detestable Crime Against Nature’: A Revised History of Homosexuality & Mormonism, 1840-1980,” 2004)\n\n3272:\n\n“… Brigham Young University, rated by the Princeton Review is the 10th most homophobic college in the US.” (Hugo Salinas, “Gays and Lesbians to Protest at Brigham Young University,” www.Affirmation.org, January 2006)\n\n3275:\n\n“The organizers of the Soulforce Equality Ride have just announced the venue for the rally they will hold in Provo.

Bergin as its Director. Although the public was not informed of the true nature of the ironically named ‘Values Institute,’ its goals were to produce an anti-Gay scientific book, written by Bergin and Victor L. Brown Jr., funded by church tithing monies, which would be printed by an eastern press and made to appear as though it had no ties to the Church. This would then be used as ‘secular evidence’ to back up the church’s homophobic stance. Other Values Institute goals were to prepare anti-Gay papers and rebuttals, support academic and scientific research vindicating the church’s stance on homosexuality, and lastly to recommend to the First Presidency ‘specific steps the Church might take in combating homosexuality and other sexual misconduct.’\n\nAnd most horribly, at BYU in 1976, Dr. D.
