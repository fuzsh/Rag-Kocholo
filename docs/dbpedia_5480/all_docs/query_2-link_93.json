As you read these promises and hearken unto what you must do and act on it, the promise is not just a guarenteed blessing. If you scincerely do what you must do and keep at it, you will receive the stated promise. The promise won't always come at once and it may take months or even years to see the result, but it will come. (Modify this - I'm not sure if that works but I think we should have something like that on every promises page, just kind of a disclaimer that its not exactly just a go do once and then you reap the promises.)\n\nPics and Quotes\n\nÂ© 1997- MargiesMessages.com\n\nThis is NOT an official site of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints.
