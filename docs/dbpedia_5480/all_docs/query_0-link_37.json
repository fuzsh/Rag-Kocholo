Expressions of Faith: Testimonies of Latter-day Saint Scholars. Salt Lake City/Provo, UT: Deseret Book and Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies, 1996.\n\nDisplay Abstract\n\nThe news media often characterizes some detractors of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints as “Mormon intellectuals” and presents them to the public as the thinking Mormons who know the inside story of the church. In this rush to produce controversial news, an obvious truth has been overlooked—that the LDS intellectual and academic communities are composed of strong believers in the Prophet Joseph Smith’s revelations and solid supporters of LDS Church leadership. Only at the fringes is there noticeable dissent.\n\nReaders of Expressions of Faith will discover a marvelous, uncoached unity in these testimonies of LDS scholars. Although most of the 24 contributors are persons of substantial learning, none base their beliefs in scholarly insights. Rather, all point to an inner conviction that has come through life experience and God’s gift. As they explain, these testimonies enlighten their entire lives, including their scholarly endeavors. None feel conflict between the canons of scholarship and religious belief, but rather find the two mutually reinforcing and even necessary.\n\nThis unique book aims to strengthen people’s faith by precept and example as they pursue their own efforts to know the Lord and to understand his love and dealings with humankind.\n\nID = [6984] Status = Type = book Date = 1996-01-01 Collections: farms-books Size: Children: 0 Rebuilt: 8/5/24 7:09:37\n\nBradford, Miles Gerald.

In an insightful response, Daniel C.

Paradigms Regained: A Survey of Margaret Barker’s Scholarship and Its Significance for Mormon Studies. Vol. 2 of Occasional Papers, edited by William J. Hamblin. Provo, UT: Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies, 2001.\n\nDisplay Abstract Display Keywords\n\nSome years ago I bought Margaret Barker’s The Great Angel on the last day of an annual meeting of the Society of Biblical Literature. (On the last day of each conference, hundreds of booksellers—Cambridge and Brill being notable exceptions—sell their display copies at a fifty-percent discount, creating the Bookanalia, a book-buying frenzy among otherwise staid and boring academics that is a wonder to behold.) As I began reading through the book on the flight home, I would come across passages that made me stop and ask, “Could Barker be a Mormon?” Reading further I would conclude she probably wasn’t. But a few pages later I would again be forced to wonder, “Well, maybe she really is a Mormon.” Every Latter-day Saint I’ve talked to about Barker’s research has had a similar reaction. The truth is, however, Barker is a Methodist preacher and a past president of the Society for Old Testament Study, who has had no extensive contact with Latter-day Saints. I have long believed that Barker’s books deserved to be more widely known and read by Latter-day Saints. Kevin Christensen’s “Paradigms Regained,” the second in the ongoing series of FARMS Occasional Papers, is an excellent introduction to Barker’s works and their possible implications for Latter-day Saints.\n\nKeywords: Deuteronomist Reforms; Isaiah (Book); Isaiah (Prophet); Josiah’s Reforms; King Josiah; Messiah\n\nTopics: Old Testament Scriptures > Isaiah\n\nID = [8422] Status = Type = book Date = 2001-01-01 Collections: bmc-archive,farms-books,old-test Size: 300019 Children: 0 Rebuilt: 8/5/24 7:09:43\n\nClark, David L.

Under ordinary circumstances it would be dificult to traverse eastward from Indonesia to America as the ocean currents flow westerly. But a natural occurrence that happens every two to ten years changes the flow of currents to an easterly direction—it is called El Niño. Had Lehi traveled from the Arabian Peninsula in August at the height of the monsoonal cycle and reached the Paciic in time to catch the El Niño he would have landed on the west coast of Central America.\n\nID = [81091] Status = Type = book Date = 1991-01-01 Collections: bom,farms-books Size: Children: 0 Rebuilt: 7/22/24 11:15:04\n\nEggington, William G. “Our Weakness in Writing”: Oral and Literate Culture in the Book of Mormon.

Romans 1: Notes and Reflections. Provo, UT: Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies, 1999.\n\nDisplay Abstract\n\nThe book of Romans can be difficult to understand, and it is used more than any other biblical book to challenge LDS doctrine. “When we understand Romans, it is obvious that not only need we not fear having others discuss Paul’s teachings, but we can use those very teachings to teach the truthfulness of the gospel understood through latter-day revelation.”\n\nIn commenting on Romans 1 verse by verse, author James E. Faulconer touches on such topics as faith, holiness, obedience, service to Christ, personal conversion and repentance, and becoming true saints.

Faulconer. Rich scripture study is facilitated by tools and techniques that help us focus on what the scriptures can teach us. This study aid offers pointers and suggestions that will familiarize beginning students of the scriptures with the many resources available to them, as well as help more experienced students improve the overall effectiveness of their scripture study.\n\nIn this fascinating book, Faulconer discusses a helpful method and the purpose of outlining, an in-depth method of cross-referencing, how to ask cogent and thought-provoking questions about the scriptures, the benefits of using dictionaries and concordances, the relation between words and ideas apparent through rhetorical studies, and using the valuable reference tools in the LDS edition of the scriptures. He then provides sample notes developed using the study tools he describes to show how research and pondering can make scripture study even more meaningful.\n\nID = [6994] Status = Type = book Date = 1999-01-01 Collections: farms-books Size: 219122 Children: 0 Rebuilt: 8/5/24 7:09:37\n\nGee, John.

The author cites examples from the missions of the sons of Mosiah, as well as the mission to the Zoramites and the preaching of Nephi and Lehi. In each case, war ceased and prosperity was regained after the gospel was preached to the instigators of war.\n\nKeywords: Missiology; Doctrinal history, peace; Book of Mormon\n\nID = [82134] Status = Type = book article Date = 1990-01-01 Collections: bom,farms-books Size: Children: 0 Rebuilt: 7/22/24 11:15:59\n\nNibley, Hugh W. “Warfare and the Book of Mormon.” In Warfare in the Book of Mormon, edited by Stephen D.

Salt Lake City/Provo, UT: Deseret Book and Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies, 1990.\n\nDisplay Abstract\n\nOriginally presented at the FARMS Symposium on Warfare, 24 March 1989.\n\nCompares the descriptions of warfare in the Book of Mormon with the writings and axioms of Karl von Clausewitz’s military treatise, Vom Kriege, that served the military as a bible for 150 years and was published in 1833. Descriptions of Book of Mormon warfare match von Clausewitz’s principles very well. Again the internal evidence of the Book of Mormon establishes its accuracy in describing technical subjects unknown to Joseph Smith.\n\nSee also: “Warfare and the Book of Mormon” (1994)\n\nTopics: Hugh W.

Such attempts examine parallels in the geographies, cultures, and literatures of the Middle East and ancient America (especially parallels to knowledge that have become available only since Joseph Smith’s time). These parallels are used to prove that the Book of Mormon is consistent with ancient knowledge and forms which Joseph Smith could have known only through an ancient manuscript and revelation. This essay takes a different approach, based essentially on internal evidence provided by the book itself. My reflections, stimulated by the work of Mormon scholars such as John Welch, Noel Reynolds, and Bruce Jorgensen, examine techniques developed by non-Mormon literary critics Northrop Frye and Rene Girard in their work on the Bible.\n\nKeywords: Atonement; Literary Criticism; Logos\n\nTopics: Hugh W.
