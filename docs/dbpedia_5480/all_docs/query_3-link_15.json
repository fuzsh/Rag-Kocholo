        "text": "Synagogue(s) The word synagogue is of Greek origin (synagÅgÄ) meaning âassemblyâ or âgathering.â In early Jewish tradition, the building where one worshipped, prayed, and studied in a communal gathering was usually identified in Hebrew as a âhouse of assemblyâ (beth-knesset). One could go to the house of assembly or synagogue to hear the word of God and to discuss us meaning in open dialogue. For example, Jesus and Paul taught openly in synagogues (e.g., Matt. 13:54; Luke 4:16â21; John 6:59; Acts 13:14â16; 17:1â2). Nephiâs use of the phrase âhouses of worshipâ as a synonym for synagogues seems appropriate (2 Ne. 26:26).\n\nScholars are uncertain exactly when formal places of regular or weekly assembly developed in Jewish worship. Some Jewish traditions point to temple worship and the public assemblies of the early prophets as prototypes (e.g., Deut. 1:1â5; Josh. 24:1; 1 Sam. 7:5â7). Others see the communal practices beginning with the religious reforms of Jeremiah1 (627-585 B.C.) and king Josiah (640-609 B.C.) as a time when groups of Jews outside Jerusalem would father for study, prayer, and worship. Some scholars believe the reference to the âhouses of the peopleâ in Jeremiah 39:8 to be a form of synagogue. There is an early reference to Psalms to an enemy burning 2all the synagogues of God in the landâ (Ps. 74:8).\n\nAlthough some types of communal worship in buildings other than the temple may have been practiced while Lehi lived near Jerusalem, most scholars suggests that the use of synagogues became institutionalized in the Jewish community during and after the Babylonian captivity. This was about the same time that early Nephite synagogues are first mentioned (2 Ne. 26:26). Perhaps the appearance of synagogue worship among these two widely divided peoples, the people of Lehi and the Jews o the Babylonian captivity, suggests that some types of assembly buildings were in use among the Jews before they both left Jerusalem.\n\nThe term âsynagogueâ (or âsynagoguesâ) is found throughout the Book of Mormon, with 26 references ranging from 2 Nephi 26:26 to Moroni 7:1, although most are in chapters 16â33 of Alma. Synagogues are often mentioned alongside temples and sanctuaries. It is not clear what distinctions existed between the buildings, rather in use or design. It is clear that the temple was used as a place of instruction from as early as Jacob (Jacob 1:17) and at least down to Christ (3 Ne. 11:1â10), but how this use differed from that of a synagogue or a sanctuary is not specified. Perhaps the synagogues were used more for regular study and worship (e.g., 2 Ne. 26:26; Alma 16:13; 21:20), whereas temples were used for larger gatherings on special occasions (e.g., Jacob 1:17; Mosiah 1:18; 2:5â7; 3 Ne. 11:1â10).\n\nSynagogues were used both among the faithful Nephites and their Lamanite converts, as well as among the apostate Amalekites and Zoramites, but their purposes appear to have been very different. Some Nephite synagogues were apparently built âafter the manner of the Jewsâ (Alma 16;13) and used for similar purposes such as reading the scriptures, praying, and giving sermons. Thus the Nephites did âhumble themselves before God, and began to assemble themselves together at their sanctuaries to worship Godâ (Alma 15:17). Alma2 reminded the poor and humble of the Zoramites that such worship was not limited to a physical structure (Alma 32:10). Aaron3 and his brethren preached their gospel message in the Lamanite synagogues (Alma 21:3â6). That Nephites were allowed to speak in Amalekite and Lamanite assemblies suggests that the custom of open dialogue was a part of synagogue practice in the Book of Mormon (Welch, 193â95).\n\nAs a contrast, the Amalekites and Zoramites assembled in synagogues as places of vain public worship and social prominence (Alma 21; 31; 32). Their apostate practices followed the order of Nehor, and they rejected the study of the scriptures Alma 14:8; 21:4, 12). They adapted the synagogue to their own purposes and through these people, the synagogue was introduced to the Lamanites. It is clear from Alma 23:2 that the Lamanites knew of synagogues and perhaps even attended the Amalekite synagogues from time to time. Alma 21:16 suggests that they also met in their own assemblies, perhaps in homes or outdoors."
