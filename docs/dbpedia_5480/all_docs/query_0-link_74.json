        "text": "Recently, Elder David A. Bednar spoke of the temple, and how our homes need to be the location of our children and grandchildren’s most meaningful temple preparation. Too many Latter-day Saints go to the temple for the first time unprepared for the experience.\n\nElder Bednar quoted President Ezra Taft Benson, who also expressed his concern about how poorly we prepare the youth for their temple experience. President Benson said: “Because of its sacredness we are sometimes reluctant to say anything about the temple to our children and grandchildren. As a consequence, many do not develop a real desire to go to the temple, or when they go there, they do so without much background to prepare them for the obligations and covenants they enter into.\n\nI believe a proper understanding or background will immeasurably help prepare our youth for the temple.” Similarly, President Boyd K. Packer wrote, “Members of the Church are not willing to talk about [temple] matters . . . Lacking knowledge, some [who have not been through the temple] develop strange explanations about the work of our temples.” In 1971, the First Presidency of the Church sent out a circular letter stating, “It has come to our attention that many of those planning to go to the temple for the first time are not properly oriented as to what to expect there. Under such circumstances they may fail to receive adequate understanding from their experience in the temple.” A lack of preparation certainly increases the likelihood that those attending for the first time will not have the positive experience the temple is intended to provide.\n\nWith all of this in mind, and with a sincere desire to help those who are preparing for any ordinance of the temple (i.e., baptism for the dead, initiatory and endowment, or sealing)—so that they will have a good and Spirit-filled experience—I wanted to share that my temple preparation book, “75 Questions and Answers About Preparing for the Temple,” will be released this week. I hope it will be a blessing to you and to those whom you know that are preparing for the temple, have recently gone through the temple, or are seeking to better understand the temple.\n\nHere are a few comments about the book from various reviewers.\n\n“Brother Gaskill’s careful approach to the questions addressed in this book will equip parents, grandparents and church leaders to help those they love to have more meaningful experiences in the temple. There are principles in this book that will help the newest deacon or beehive have a more powerful experience as they participate in baptisms for the dead, and there are principles that will touch the heart and expand the mind of the most seasoned temple worker. This book is for everyone!”—G. Shad Martin, Director of Preservice Training, Brigham Young University\n\n“‘75 Questions and Answers About Preparing for the Temple’ should be required reading for everyone preparing to receive their Endowment. Dr. Gaskill’s answers to these tough questions can put every member at ease and allow them to feel the Spirit and be prepared their first experience in the temple. Even if you have already attended the temple for years, you need this book. I’m serious, buy this book and read it with your children, your quorum, your missionary, and your friends. You’ll be grateful that you did.”—Hank Smith, Assistant Teaching Professor of Ancient Scripture, Brigham Young University\n\n“Alonzo Gaskill has created a most welcome and needed book for your preparation to attend the temple. He has skillfully addressed questions that are on the minds of all who are preparing to enter the Lord’s holy house. This book not only covers question you might have about preparing for the temple, but it also lets you know what you can expect once you enter the temple. Being ready to attend the temple is your sacred responsibility, and this book will be a wonderful asset in your preparations. It contains vital information for everyone who is planning to receive their temple endowment or the sealing ordinances. And it is a great review for lifetime members as they seek to understand and appreciate the doctrines, ordinances and covenants received in the house of the Lord. This book will help relieve the anxiety and stress associated with the initial experience of attending the temple; and it will bless your life by helping you to have a glorious experience in the house of the Lord. It is the perfect book to assist you in your preparation to enter the Lord’s holy house.”—Ed J. Pinegar, former Manti Temple President (2009-2012)\n\n“For members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, making and keeping temple covenants is critical for their exaltation and eternal life. Dr. Gaskill does a commendable job asking and answering essential questions for those who are planning to attend the temple—especially for those attending the temple for the first time.”—David K Fossum, Counselor in the St Paul Temple Presidency, 2010-2013.\n\nFriends!\n\nI am leading a tour to Israel and Jordan April 28, 2020 to May 8, 2020.\n\nThere are only 46 spots and I would love you to come!\n\nSpaces tend to go a year early, so please sign up and we can walk where Jesus walked.\n\nSign up here.\n\nBelow is a current list of publications.\n\nBooks Authored\n\nAlonzo L.

This is, in part, no doubt due to the social function of clothing, meaning that we often use clothing as a form of communication in which we inform others as to how we define ourselves and then define the relationship between us and them. Apparel associated with the feet is particularly symbolic of abstract principles such as movement and ownership. Alonzo Gaskill’s paper addresses the investiture and divestiture of the shoe in its biblical context and demonstrates that something as simple as taking off a shoe could establish, via ritual, a profound covenantal relationship.\n\nThe “Ceremony of the Shoe”: A Ritual of God’s Ancient Covenant People.”\n\n“Put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground” (Exodus 3:5). So spoke the premortal Jehovah to the prophet Moses—and so practiced ancient and modern Hindus, Muslims, Hare Krishnas, and various other faith traditions. Shoes have played an important role in establishing sacred space and sacred rites from the beginning of time. However, the removal of one’s shoes as a ritual act or gesture is not always about sacred soil. As a singular example, the ancient practice of levirate marriage is often associated with the removal of the shoes—but entrance into sacred space is not at the heart of the act. Indeed, an entirely different connotation is implied. In this paper we will examine the “ceremony of the shoe” as it appears in Ruth 4, with its common interpretations, likely implications, and significant relations to Latter-day Saint temple practices.\n\nLevirate marriage is the name given to the ancient law requiring the surviving brother of a deceased man to unite in an intimate relationship with the childless widow of his brother. This was done in order to raise up seed unto the name of his prematurely deceased sibling (see Deuteronomy 25:5–6).1 As with many Hebrew laws, levirate marriage had accompanying rituals requisite for its formal and legal enactment. Thus, near the end of the Deuteronomic passage dealing with this law comes an explanation of what a woman should do if her surviving brother- in-law (or levir) refuses to marry her. We read: “Then shall his brother’s wife come unto him in the presence of the elders, and loose his shoe from off his foot, and spit in his face, and shall answer and say, So shall it be done unto that man that will not build up his brother’s house. And his name shall be called in Israel, The house of him that hath his shoe loosed” (Deuteronomy 25:9–10).\n\nWe know that the practice of levirate marriage was known in biblical times at least as early as the writing of the Pentateuch and remained culturally acceptable perhaps as late as the penning of the gospel of Luke (see Luke 20:28). Unfortunately there is some confusion surrounding this rite; namely, it is common for scholars to make blanket assumptions about this law and its ritual enactment in scripture and history—perhaps in part because what does appear in scripture regarding levirate marriage is scant at best. Thus commentators will sometimes see in certain cultic practices or biblical passages what appear to be parallels between those rites or verses and the law of levirate marriage. However, many of these suppositions are not necessarily warranted.\n\nFor an example of one such unwarranted assumption, we turn to the book of Ruth and the story of Boaz’s marriage to that icon of faithfulness and devotion, Ruth. In the fourth chapter of Ruth we read: “Now this was the manner in former time in Israel concerning redeeming and concerning changing, for to confirm all things; a man plucked off his shoe, and gave it to his neighbour: and this was a testimony in Israel. Therefore the kinsman said unto Boaz, Buy it for thee. So he drew off his shoe” (Ruth 4:7–8).\n\nAt least as early as the first century of the Common Era, commentators were reading the Ruth passage as an example of levirate marriage. Josephus clearly saw the ritual portrayed in the book of Ruth as a representation of this rite, as is evidenced by his comments in his work Antiquities of the Jews. He wrote that Boaz “bid the woman to loose his shoe and spit in his face, according to the law; and when this was done [Boaz] married Ruth, and they had a son within a year’s time.”2 Likewise, Methodist commentator Adam Clarke (circa 1760–1832) wrote that the laws explaining what was happening in Ruth 4 are “given at large in Deut.xxv.5–9.”3 Like Josephus and Clarke, most scholars, whether LDS4 or non-LDS,5 tend to see the rite described in Ruth 4 as a biblical example of levirate marriage.\n\nAdmittedly, on a superficial level there appear to be significant correlations between the passages in Ruth 4 and those in Deuteronomy 25. In the end, however, there are a number of reasons why Ruth chapter 4 is likely not intended to be a representation of a traditional levirate marriage ritual.6\n\nFirst of all, unlike the widowed woman in Exodus chapter 25, Ruth does not spit in the face of the man who refuses to marry her, which many sources indicate is a requisite part of the ceremony of levirate marriage.7 One commentator noted that the Boethusians, or Sanhedrin, “held that the yevamah is required actually to spit in the levir’s face and this is also stated in two manuscripts of the Septuagint, in Josephus’s Antiquities, and in some of the apocryphal books, but the talmudic scholars held it to be sufficient if the elders see her spitting.”8 Thus, since Ruth neither spits in the face of her intended, nor on the ground, hers cannot be a levirate marriage. It will also be noted that the unnamed male kinsman-redeemer (gō’ēl) in the story of Ruth incurs no disgrace when he declines to play his part.9 If this is an example of levirate marriage, it runs contrary to scripturally dictated practice.\n\nSecond, in the story of Ruth and Boaz it is not the woman who removes the man’s shoe. 4\n\nRather, the unnamed male kinsman-redeemer (gō’ēl) is depicted as removing his own shoe. This too is contrary to the law surrounding levirate marriage and contrary to what happens in the Deuteronomic passage in question.10 Thus, again, something other than the standard levirate marriage ceremony is being depicted here.\n\nThird, in the book of Ruth the unnamed kinsman-redeemer (gō’ēl) is not Ruth’s husband’s brother—as is required by Jewish law. He appears to be, at best, a distant relative.11 Thus, again, this cannot be an effort to fulfill the custom of levirate marriage. Something entirely different is being depicted here.\n\nFourth, the root words for the levirate obligation (yābām) and for the kinsman-redeemer (gā’al) are totally unrelated. Yābām can mean either “husband’s brother,” or to perform the duty of such to “a brother’s widow.”12 However, the book of Ruth does not use yābām but rather the term gā’al, which indicates a redeemer (particularly of consecrated things or people) or an avenger and signifies that these roles are performed based on the authority of kinship. A “kinsman-redeemer” purchases a relative from slavery (actual or potential); a “kinsman-avenger” provides justice on behalf of a relative.13 Of course both concepts are in the image of God as Redeemer—but the implications and linguistic connotations are entirely different. Thus, again, the connection between levirate marriage and the rite depicted in Ruth 4 seems stretched.\n\nFifth, Obed—the son born to Boaz and Ruth—is spoken of as the son of Boaz rather than as the son of Ruth’s deceased husband, Mahlon (see Ruth 4:18–22; Septuagint Ruth 4:13). This would be contrary to levirate marriage, which is primarily for the purpose of raising seed up to a deceased brother.14 In other words, when the levir fathers a child through his sister-in-law, it is not considered his offspring, but rather the offspring of his deceased brother. Since Obed is described as being Boaz’s son, the rite performed in Ruth 4 cannot be an example of levirate marriage. 15\n\nFinally, one text notes: “In biblical law the levir [or brother-in-law] does not require a formal marriage (kiddushin) to the yevamah [or sister-in-law] since the personal status tie, the zikkah between them, arises automatically upon the death of the husband of the yevamah.”16 Elsewhere we read: “If a man died childless, his widow was not free to remarry but was considered to be already betrothed to his brother.”17 Thus, whereas levirate marriage did not require—nor allow—a marriage contract to be initiated (as the couple were considered already married), in the book of Ruth a formal marriage is expected and, in the end, performed. So, again, the rites depicted in Deuteronomy 25 and Ruth 4 appear to be different—one having to do with the loss of a family member and the other to do with something that is potentially different altogether.\n\nSo if Ruth 4:7–8 is not an example of levirate marriage, what is it? While we cannot say for certain, and the chapter offers us little by way of clues,18 there are a couple of elements which may at least help us to form a hypothesis about what the author intended his audience to understand. Our primary focus here will be the removal of the shoe. However, we must be cautious to approach the passage exegetically rather than eisegetically19 if we wish to avoid the pitfalls encountered by previous exegetes.\n\nIn modern as well as ancient cultures, shoes have served not only a practical function but also an aesthetic one. However, when employed in Biblical ritual, shoes have an almost exclusively symbolic purpose.20 For example, they can represent one’s preparation for a task (see Exodus 12:11; Ephesians 6:15; Matthew 10:10; Mark 6:9). Sometimes they imply the status of the wearer—freedom for the shod (see Luke 15:22) and enslavement or poverty for the barefoot individual (see 2 Chronicles 28:15; Isaiah 20:2). In contrast, going barefoot is occasionally utilized as a sign of mourning (see 2 Samuel 15:30; Ezekiel 24:17, 23).21 Finally, perhaps the most commonly associated meanings have to do with the removal of shoes when one enters hallowed ground (see Exodus 3:5; Joshua 5:15; Acts 7:33).22 Thus, we see footwear as more than a convenience and more than an accessory. Shoes, slippers, and sandals are important symbolic articles for ancient and modern Israel—God’s covenant people. Aside from the aforementioned symbolic uses of the shoe or slipper, there is one additional use worthy of our examination. It is the ceremony of the shoe23 alluded to in the Hebrew Bible, in the records of ancient Mesopotamia,24 and in the sacred rites of modern covenant Israel.\n\nIt appears from a number of sources, scriptural and otherwise, that the transfer of property in ancient times was accompanied by a rite or ritual consisting primarily of the removal of shoes. The Hebrews referred to this ritual by the name of halitzah (“to draw off”).25 One text notes, “When someone sells his property . . . he loses permanently or temporarily his legal right to it . . . and he ‘lifts up his hand or foot from it, and places that of the new owner in it.’ Thus it is logical to conclude that this expression which had at first only a legal meaning developed into a symbolic meaning. Then the biblical tradition took a further step. The ‘lifting up of the foot’ became more concrete and real with the ‘pulling off of the shoe.’”26 This act before witnesses was a legal attestation27 that the party divesting itself of a particular piece of property was doing so willingly—and had formally and officially relinquished all future claims to that particular piece of property.28 The removal of the sandal, slipper, or shoe at the end of the rite signified that the transaction was completed and that the ritual was legally binding.29 One commentary described the meaning of the rite as follows: “A person’s garments are, so to speak, part of himself, and . . . if a person removes his garments in order to show his willingness to deprive himself of everything in life, he ought also to remove his shoes.”30 This same author continues: Amongst the Hebrews business transactions took place publically in the market-place so that the presence of the whole community, or at least ten of the elders, served to confirm them. (Gen. xxiii.) . . . As an aid to the memory, therefore, there arose the custom of drawing off the shoes in transferring a possession or domain. (Ruth iv, 7.) The idea was that the person who gave up a possession should show by removing his shoe that he was thus divesting himself of something before the witnesses. This could then be regarded as a public declaration that he was withdrawing from the property and handing it over to another person.31\n\nBecause the shoe was a natural symbol of possession, the removal of the same implied divestment.32 As noted, this act (although symbolic) had binding, legal implications clearly understood by all who were called upon to witness the rite,33 and in a time when the ability to write was greatly limited, it allowed even the illiterate to participate in legal transactions. Because of biblical evidence and extracanonical support, scholars believe that this rite was at one time very widespread in the ancient Near East.34\n\nAlthough the common assumption that the rite depicted in Ruth 4 is traditionally seen as an example of levirate marriage, it appears likely that it is instead a prime example of the ceremony of the shoe. The salient portion of Ruth reads: “(Now in earlier times in Israel, for the\n\n8\n\nredemption and transfer of property to become final, one party took off his sandal and gave it to the other. This was the method of legalizing transactions in Israel.) So the kinsman-redeemer said to Boaz, ‘Buy it yourself.’ And he removed his sandal” (New International Version, Ruth 4:7–8).35 One commentary on this passage states:\n\nWhen the unnamed36 kinsman-redeemer (gō’ēl) arrives the next morning at the city gate, Boaz is waiting for him. The dialogue is brief. Boaz brings together the kinsman-redeemer and 10 elders. In typical patriarchal fashion the subject matter is not the women—Naomi and Ruth—but rather the dead man Elimelech’s land. Boaz tells the kinsman-redeemer that Naomi is selling it and he is the first in line to acquire it. . . . The kinsman-redeemer agrees to redeem Elimelech’s land. Boaz, however, counters that the Moabite Ruth is part of Elimelech’s property. Since Elimelech’s daughter-in-law is still able to provide an heir for her dead husband’s name and land, the kinsman-redeemer is, in effect, committing himself to providing that heir by buying the land. . . . This new information changes things. It is one thing to buy land—and convenient that being a close relative to the deceased gives one the first option to do so. It is quite another thing to realize that the land will ultimately belong to the son whom one will raise up for the deceased. The kinsman-redeemer understands the purchase of Elimelech’s land to entail risk to his own inheritance and so declines the opportunity to purchase it. He then passes on to Boaz the right to redeem the land. . . . A narrative parenthesis explains the significance of what happens next. . . . Transfer of right or ownership of property was solemnized not by a handshake nor by a written contract as it is today but by each party’s removing his sandal and giving it to the other.37\n\nSo the subject is the transfer of property—specifically land (traditionally associated with this ritual), but also Ruth, who, in an ancient patriarchal milieu, would have had the status of property in such circumstances.38 Here the removal of a shoe symbolizes the fact that rights to the land Elimelech once owned—and rights to his daughter-in-law (who might provide a legal heir)—are now being transferred.39 Indeed, one commentator noted that Ruth 4:7 “is best understood as an overly terse way of describing shoe symbolism in two different kinds of transaction; in an exchange transaction, the parties exchanged shoes, while in the matter of giving up the right of redemption, the one ceding the right gave his shoe to the one taking over the right.”40 As noted above, the right to freely walk on or dwell upon an estate belonged only to the owner—and the shoe served as the perfect symbol of the right of possession.41 Anciently, the foot symbolized power or possession (see Psalm 8:6; Psalm 36:11; Joshua 10:24) as well as territorial claims (see Deuteronomy 1:36; 11:24; Joshua 1:3; 14:9).42 Here the kinsman-redeemer (gō’ēl) was acknowledging that he had willingly divested himself of his natural right to Elimelech’s former property. Thus, one commentator states that the book of “Ruth has preserved the older meaning of the shoe ceremony—a renunciation of a right.”43\n\nOf course, it is possible that at some point in history there was a connection between, or blending of, the ceremony of the shoe and levirate marriage44—after all, the latter of these was not solely concerned with producing a male heir for a deceased relative. It was just as concerned, if not more so, with the perpetuation of family property within the immediate family.45\n\nRegardless, clearly the meaning of the rite described in the book of Ruth is different from that of levirate marriage, and it appears that there are limited connections that can be made between these two rites. Despite involving the removal of a shoe, the context of the Deuteronomical rite shows that what is intended is significantly different from what is represented in the book of Ruth.\n\nThe connections sometimes made between the ceremony of the shoe and the removal of footwear when entering sacred space are not so tenuous, however. As noted above, a prime message in the removal of shoes during ritual is that one is divesting oneself of ownership or property. It is a legally binding acknowledgment that what was once yours is no longer such, of your own free will and choice. We see examples in scripture of individuals removing their shoes upon entering sacred space, Moses (see Exodus 3:5) and Joshua (see Joshua 5:15) being the chief among them. In what sense are they divesting themselves of something when they perform such an act? The answer to that question seems obvious. In his fourth-century Instructions to Initiates into the Mysteries, Cyril of Jerusalem stated, “As soon, then, as ye entered [the inner chamber], ye put off your tunic [or street clothes]; and this was an image of putting off the old man with his deeds.”46 In the spirit of Cyril’s comments, it seems fair to say that the removal of shoes upon entering sacred ground symbolizes the temporary divesting of oneself of the world and its ways—exchanging temporal property for a spiritual residence. It is a symbolic effort to set aside the natural man and the things of this fallen world in order to consecrate one’s life and embrace the things of God, including his presence, glory, and Spirit. Thus, one typologist wrote, “putting off shoes on entering a holy place represents leaving earthly contact outside . . . and [divesting] oneself of vice.”47 Another source states, “Shoes are necessary only on the earth because of the filth of the ground. By removing them, we symbolically leave the world outside the Lord’s sanctuary.”48\n\nElsewhere we read of a connection between the ceremony of the shoe and the removal of one’s footwear when entering sacred ground; anciently, “washing was a symbol of consecration, and it was necessary for the worshiper to wash his garments previous to his taking part in any special sacred function (Lev. xvi, etc.), but as shoes, on account of the material from which they were made, could not be washed, they were removed as an act of consecration.”49 Thus, when you and I participate in the ordinances of the temple, we technically divest ourselves of the world via approaching the temple physically clean and also via removal of not only our street clothing but also our shoes. Such actions do not constitute the ceremony of the shoe, but they do prepare us to participate in that rite when it is introduced to us in the house of the Lord—and they do suggest a subtle connection between the ceremony and our actions of preparation.\n\nWe now turn our attention to the specifics of how this ancient rite of property transferal specifically relates to God’s modern covenant people and their worship patterns today. The symbolic meanings underlying the ceremony of the shoe, as delineated in this paper, seem germane to modern temple worship.\n\nFirst of all, removing shoes as part of the covenant-making process in ancient Semitic societies signaled the participants’ willingness to divest themselves of some possession—often property which they formerly had a right to. Then is it not possible that the rite manifests their hope of gaining something better through the fulfillment of their part in the covenant?50 For example, when Adam and Eve willingly partook of the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, they divested themselves of Eden (with its ease and luxury) in hopes of gaining the celestial kingdom. They made a choice to renounce that property because they knew something better awaited them.\n\nSimilarly, in the holy temple, patrons symbolically divest themselves of their inheritance in the premortal existence (i.e., the “first estate”) so that they can live in the “lone and dreary world” (the “second estate”)—all in the hopes of gaining the celestial kingdom. Thus, like Adam and Eve—or Ruth’s unnamed kinsman-redeemer—we once willingly covenanted to relinquish our right to remain in the premortal existence because we knew something better awaited us, namely, the celestial kingdom. We made a trade, as it were. We took a calculated risk. In the temple, when entering into that covenant with God, we physically remove our shoes as a symbolic statement that such was done of our own free will and choice, and with the knowledge and belief that God will fulfill his portion of that covenant by preparing for us a “promised land,” even the celestial kingdom. John Tvedtnes has suggested that “the Hebrew for sandal (na‘al) is probably a wordplay with (nahal), meaning ‘inheritance.’”51 So the removal of the footwear when participating in the ceremony of the shoe actually highlights what that rite is about. It suggests to the participant that inheritance (or land) is the focus—and in a temple context those lands are the premortal existence, Eden, and the yet-future celestial kingdom.52\n\nOn a related note, David R. Mace explained that in Biblical times, “possession of the land and marriage with the widow went together.”53 As it relates to the story of Ruth, there appear to be symbolic implications in this concept. Just as the land and the bride are connected in the story, so also do the promised land (or celestial kingdom) and membership in the Church (which is the “bride of Christ”—see, for example, Ephesians 5:22–33) go together. It is through the restored rites of the fullness of the gospel of Jesus Christ that those who believe become Christ’s “bride” and lay hold upon an inheritance in the land which belongs to him.54 We each seek a place in the celestial kingdom of our God. The ceremony of the shoe highlights that desire and our commitment to connect ourselves to the Bridegroom, that redemption might take place and an inheritance might be received. Of the symbolism inherent in the story of Ruth, one commentator wrote that Boaz “is a type for the Lord Jesus who owns the field and who marries those who were formerly foreigners and strangers, but who put their trust in Him and become His bride, the church.”55 Symbolically speaking, removal of the shoe is a ritualistic way of exhibiting faith in the Bridegroom and his ability to save or redeem. The early twentieth-century Scottish linguist and typologist Harold Bayley saw connections between the shoe or slipper and Christ. He noted that just as a shoe protects the wearer and shields him or her from dirt—“by taking it upon itself”—so also does Jesus shield those who seek to be his bride from the spiritual dirt we call sin.56 This has relevance in the story of Ruth, both because Ruth and Boaz seem to typify the Church and her Bridegroom, and also because of Boaz’s role to redeem Ruth via shouldering her burden and taking upon himself her trial—just as Christ willingly shoulders our burdens and takes upon himself our trials. Significantly, as in the story of Ruth, we must seek out a covenant relationship with Christ (our Bridegroom) and, metaphorically speaking, offer him our shoe as a representation that we have given up all we have because we trust in him and in all that he has promised to do for us and give to us.57\n\nAs the evidence shows, levirate marriage and the ceremony regarding the transferal of property are not equivalent, or even harmonious, rites. Indeed, as one commentator noted, “they are in open conflict” with each other.58 Thus, rather than assuming that the book of Ruth preserves a traditional example of the former Deuteronomic rite, it seems more fitting to draw from Ruth’s experience a message about property or inheritance rites and their application to our modern covenant relationship with Christ and the work which we do in his holy temples.\n\nNotes\n\n1.

One might argue that the temple rite during which one removes one’s shoes is different from the rite of removal of shoes depicted in Ruth 4—particularly since during the endowment all ceremonial temple clothing is removed, not just the shoes. However, in Ruth 4 it is only the shoes which are taken off. Nevertheless, it should be remembered that in the temple the removal of the shoes is its own rite, even though it is performed alongside the ritual of clothing. This is evidenced by the fact that one puts on ceremonial clothes twice during the temple endowment, but one removes and replaces the shoes only once—specifically when Adam and Eve leave Eden and you and I metaphorically leave the premortal realm. Thus, the rite of clothing and that of the removal of shoes are separate, even though they are once placed side by side in the temple. Therefore, the distinctions between the ceremony of the shoe in Ruth 4 and that which takes place in the holy endowment are more perceived than real.\n\n53. Mace, Hebrew Marriage, 106.\n\n54.

Their covenant depicted by the removal of the shoe appears primarily focused on the surrender of temporal things, or property. However, the connotation or implications in temple worship is that we are surrendering more than just property (that is, the premortal abode), but also our personal wills. In return Christ is said to offer us the celestial kingdom and to make us as he is. Thus today something highly spiritual is implied through a rite that initially had a rather temporal focus.\n\n58. Mace, Hebrew Marriage, 104. See also Hamlin, Theological Commentary, 58, 59. As another example of the misapplication of the “ceremony of the shoe,” some see connections between this rite and the selling of slaves in Hebrew Bible times. For example, in Amos 8:6 we read: “That we may buy the poor for silver, and the needy for a pair of shoes.” See also Amos 2:6. Of this verse David Noel Freedman and Francis I. Andersen wrote: “The circumstances of this nefarious and strictly illegal practice of buying and selling debtors into slavery is what the prophet [Amos] is talking about.” Andersen and Freedman, Amos, 801. E. A. Speiser, however, noted: “The ordinary interpretation of this saying that the poor could be enslaved for so trifling a thing as a pair of shoes is unconvincing . . . and economically improbable.” Speiser, “Shoes,” 18. See also Andersen and Freedman, Amos, 312. Speiser rejects a literal reading of the verse, insisting instead that some connection to the ceremony of the shoe is intended by the text. Speiser adds this: “Shoes . . . must be regarded in such instances as token payments to validate special transactions by lending them the appearance of normal business practice.” Speiser, “Shoes,” 17. True, slaves were seen as property and thus the owner had a right to them—and in this regard one might conjecture some connection between the passage and the “ceremony of the shoe.” However, the context of the passage at hand suggests that these were not slaves in the proper sense of the word (i.e., those without legal rights). Rather, these were individuals who had incurred debt through the dishonesty and trickery of corrupt merchants. Thus, they were not slaves in the traditional sense of the word—and therefore the ceremony of the shoe would have had no place in this context. Indeed, the traditional interpretation of this passage (Amos 8:6) has to do with sandals as representations of the derisory amount of money a human’s worth had been reduced to. See, for example, C. F. Keil and F. Delitzsch, “The Twelve Minor Prophets,” in Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament (Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans, 1954), 1:315; Robert Martin-Achard and S. Paul Re’emi, International Theological Commentary: Amos and Lamentations—God’s People in Crisis (Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans, 1984), 58–59; Andersen and Freedman, Amos, 801–2; Buttrick, Interpreter’s Bible, 840; Clarke, Clarke’s Commentary, 675. See also David Allan Hubbard, Tyndale Old Testament Commentary: Joel and Amos (Downers Grove, IL: InterVarsity Press, 1989), 220–21. Thus, contra Speiser’s interpretation, most commentators see nothing ritualistic taking place in this passage.\n\nAlonzo L. Gaskill\n\nFor many Latter-day Saints, their first awareness of the Roman Catholic scholar Stephen H. Webb came through his 2012 First Things article, titled “Mormonism Obsessed with Christ.” In that piece—which surprised Latter-day Saints and non-Latter-day Saints alike—Webb pointed out that “what gives Christianity its identity is its commitment to the divinity of Jesus Christ. And on that ground Mormons are more Christian than many mainstream Christians. . . . Mormonism is obsessed with Christ, and everything that it teaches is meant to awaken, encourage, and expand faith in him.” Within a week of that article’s publication, my inbox was flooded with emails from friends and acquaintances asking me things like “Have you seen this?!” or “What do you know about Steve Webb?” and “Wow! I love this guy!”\n\nIn rapid succession, Steve published several books and other materials of considerable interest to Latter-day Saints, and he spoke twice on campus at Brigham Young University. A chapter from his Oxford book Heavenly Flesh and the Metaphysics of Matter was published in BYU Studies in 2011, under the title “Godbodied: The Matter of the Latter-day Saints.” In 2012, he delivered the Truman G. Madsen Lecture on Eternal Man for the Wheatley Institution, and in 2014 he was a keynote speaker at the annual BYU New Testament Commentary conference on S. Kent Brown’s The Testimony of Luke.\n\nThe story of Steve’s lifelong spiritual journey is too complex and lengthy to tell here. But, suffice it to say, he was a man who surveyed the landscape—and who thought deeply about the teachings of many traditions. He was reared as an independent Christian—part of the Stone-Campbell Restoration Movement. As an undergrad, Steve attended Wabash College, and there he evolved, becoming quite liberal for a time. During his undergraduate years, he joined the Disciples of Christ Church. According to his former research assistant, Adam Brasich, when he returned to Wabash (as a professor), Steve even tried to start a Disciples of Christ Church in the Indianapolis area. Steve later became a member of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America; and, finally, in 2007, he converted to Roman Catholicism. He once noted, “Becoming a Roman Catholic opened the door for me to begin appreciating Mormonism, while becoming immersed in Mormonism has helped me to retrieve the value of my evangelical youth.”\n\nSteve’s initial interest in the LDS Church began when his research assistant at Wabash College began investigating Mormonism. Starting in the summer of 2009, Steve and Adam had frequent and deep conversations about Latter-day Saint theology and scripture, and Steve began to think in more serious terms about what practicing Mormons believe. He had known about the Church prior to that—and even taught about it at Wabash—but up to that time Steve never took the LDS faith seriously. He once confessed, “I . . . used to think of Mormonism as little more than an exotic and abnormal addition to Christianity. When I taught Mormon history to my students, . . . I regret to say that I did not try to hide my condescension. I have come to repent of this view, and not just because I came to my senses about how wrong it is to be rude toward somebody else’s faith. I changed my mind because I came to realize just how deeply Christ-centered Mormonism is.” Oddly, one who would not have initially classed himself as a “friend of the faith” turned out to be one of our greatest non-Mormon defenders. Like Saul before him in his conversion to Christianity, Steve was able to see the hand of God moving in his life to change his attitude about Latter-day Saints and their theology. I suppose one reason that Steve and I connected so well was that we shared a similar history in this regard. Neither of us were ever ardent anti-Mormons, but—in our younger and more naïve days— both of us failed to see the good in the LDS Church, and each of us made little effort to hide our condescension. We both found reasons to repent and to praise God for opening our eyes.\n\nSteve was, on all accounts, very eclectic. He wrote on a variety of topics, from soccer to vegetarianism, and from environmentalism to Bob Dylan. In one of his pieces, he warned about the dangers of cultural relativism—and the loss of moral education in the academy. Steve tackled movements that seek to erase any meaningful differences in gender, instead suggesting that gender is not simply an “accident of biology.” He wrote about how, in heaven, you and I will most likely have the “freedom to move through time.” Steve conjectured that, there, “the past will become a land we can inhabit for as long as it takes to experience the healing power of God’s love.” Finally, in one of his most moving pieces—written only two weeks before he passed—Steve wrote about the “God of the depressed.” Steve described depression as a “deeply religious experience, but it is an experience of God’s resistance to your most pressing personal petitions. The more you cry out for help, the more distant God can appear to be. is is negative theology gone deeply awry.” Steve added:\n\nJesus himself must have experienced depression while being famished for forty days and nights in the wilderness, praying while his disciples slept, and descending into hell.\n\nHe also spent many years hidden from public view, his mission kept secret, his life so obscure that the Gospels tell us nothing about them. He had a long time of waiting, and he knew what awaited him. It is this time of hiddenness, I think, that most captures the depressant’s emotional state. The depressed wait for the long night to end and the anguish to subside. e depressed, like Jesus during his so-called lost years, are hidden from sight, waiting for their lives to begin.\n\nSteve’s writings could be very deep and were often poignant. Some in the academic community liked what he wrote, while others attacked his work with vigor. Because he enjoyed a good debate, he largely took the criticisms in stride—but, where he felt he was misunderstood or misrepresented, Steve was very comfortable pushing back.\n\nSadly, Steve passed away on March 5, 2016. While attending his funeral in Indiana, I was approached by several non-Latter-day Saints to let me know that Mormonism was the only subject that Steve ever chose to write more than one book on. It was unusual for him to stay focused on one subject in his research and writing. Thus, his fixation on LDS theology was a curious thing, noted by many. There were many aspects of Mormon theology that drew Steve, chief among them being the idea of a material, embodied God. He was also enamored with Joseph Smith’s native genius, in addition to the power he found in the Book of Mormon’s witness of Christ. Where many non-LDS scholars scoff at the shallowness of LDS theology, Steve saw a depth, and that drove him to delve deeply into Mormon thought. One of his associates pointed out, “In his final works he reached out to the LDS community with gusto and sincere goodwill.” “Mormonism [might be] obsessed with Christ”24 (to borrow a line from Steve), but those who knew him best knew that in the last few years of his life Stephen Webb was quite “obsessed” with all things LDS. He could not get enough of it. He had developed a great love for the Church’s doctrine, history, and people.\n\nEvidence of that is found in the book we coauthored together: Catholic and Mormon: A Theological Conversation. Time and again in that book Steve extolled what he loved about Mormon theology. I had to chuckle when we began writing the rst chapter of the book. We mutually decided that Steve would write the first section (describing Catholic views of authority), then I would write the LDS response, Steve would respond to that, and finally I would finish up the discussion. Steve got to work on his portion of the chapter, and emailed it to me. As I read it, I was puzzled. Much of his first installment on authority in Catholicism focused on how amazing Joseph Smith was as a spiritual leader and prophetic figure. After reading what Steve had written, I had to exclaim, “Steve, I thought I was going to write the LDS portion of the chapter!” Steve Webb had a gift for being able to see the good in Mormonism, Joseph Smith, the Book of Mormon, and even in our unique culture. That showed in how he spoke about the Church, but also in what he wrote about it.\n\nSteve was inordinately insightful. He saw what the average person missed. He found profundity in what others perceived as mundane. As a singular example, in a May 2014 lecture at Brigham Young University, Steve reviewed S. Kent Brown’s commentary on the Gospel of Luke. In that lecture, he dwelt on the question of where Christ’s soul was dur- ing the three days in which his body lay in the tomb. Professor John W. Welch has re flected on Steve’s insights as follows:\n\nSome scholars have argued that Christ descended, but only into the forecourt of hell, the so-called limbo of the fathers, but not actually into hell itself. Steve gladly pointed out his own previous argument that 1 Peter 3:19 “clarifies the descent by telling that Jesus preached to the spirits in prison,” and therefore he must have gone further and done more than just to unlock the gates of hell in its forecourts. Steve saw this preaching by Jesus to the prisoners in hell as “the culmination of Jesus’ ministry,” and not simply as a “prolongation of his cruci xion.” Having spent time, as he did, ministering in jails to incarcerated prisoners, Steve was sure that, “Jesus would have felt right at home in hell, and the prisoners would have been glad to welcome him. The sharing of the good news is a joyful event, especially in a place where its message is most needed.”\n\nAt the end of his self-revealing comments two years ago, Steve went on to embrace the even more expansive idea offered by Mormon doctrine. “Imagine my joy in discovering, after I worked on von Balthasar’s theology of Christ’s descent into hell, the Mormon understanding of spirit prison and the idea that Jesus indeed preached in hell, but he did more than that. He organized the righteous to preach in his absence. This is an astounding claim that has no precedence, as far as I know, in traditional theology, and yet it makes absolute theological and exegetical sense. To me, it means that even in hell the church is active in carrying out God’s plan. The Catholic Church believes that salvation comes through the church, and thus it makes sense that Jesus would not have left the spirits in prison without access to the church. The Mormon explication of the descent thus gives me a new delight in the passage from Matt. 16:8, where Jesus says he will build his church and not even the gates of hell will prevail against it.”\n\nWhat a testament this insight is to the inspiration of our friend and to the goodness of the God whom Steve and all Latter-day Saints worship.\n\nThose who knew Steve well knew that he was incapable of leaving religion alone. If he was invited to a party, he would turn it into a theological debate; and he really didn’t care which side of the argument he was defending, so long as there was an argument. He was really not a contentious man, but he was passionate and simply felt the need to think and challenge and discuss religion at all places and at all times. At his funeral, it was pointed out that some actually quit inviting him to social events for fear that he would turn a light-hearted get-together into a theological colloquium. It was his nature; and, for those of us who are similarly hardwired, this aspect of Steve’s personality was charming. For those other-minded souls, this could be quite annoying. Of course, that would be their loss!\n\nThere are certainly those within the ranks of the LDS Church who do not know the name Stephen Webb. However, a number of the General Authorities were certainly aware of him. On more than one occasion, I was inadvertently copied on an email to Steve from one of the Twelve Apostles or a member of the Seventy. ( The “Reply All” feature has allowed me to eavesdrop on more than one intriguing conversation!) I joked at a lecture Steve and I were giving in Indiana that “I’ve been a member of the Church for more than three decades now and I have less access to the presiding Brethren than does my friend Steve.” In addition to several General Authorities he was friends or acquaintances with, our brightest Latter-day Saint scholars have taken note of both his remarkable life and his untimely death. Thus, I thought I might share a few thoughts from various academics who have taken note of Steve’s impact upon Mormonism.\n\nSteve’s former research assistant, Adam Brasich, described Steve’s fascination with Mormonism this way:\n\nIn a way, I don’t think any other theologian has taken Joseph Smith as seriously as a conversation partner as Steve—in terms of taking Mormon theology as an open possibility for other Christians. He treated it as an alternative version of Christianity that can teach Catholics, Orthodox, and Protestants a lot about themselves and about the weak- nesses of their own theology, particularly in a post-Christian world. For example, new discoveries in physics contradict 3rd and 4th century Christian ideas of matter. The Christian Church is stuck in those 3rd and 4th century views of the material. How are we to deal with this? Steve would say, well, you have Joseph Smith and Mormonism to help you resolve this. He saw Mormonism as a way of dealing with the post- Christian world and the breaking down of different orthodoxies. Here were some alternative ideas that Joseph Smith came up with that over some solutions. I think Steve was unique in that particular way.\n\nIndeed, the LDS view on matter—and a material God and resurrection— were ideas that Steve saw as logical, ancient, and yet abandoned by the bulk of Christianity. He felt others could learn from what Joseph taught on these subjects.\n\nPhilp Barlow, the Leonard J. Arrington Chair of Mormon History and Culture at Utah State University, rst met Steve in the mid-1990s and had become well acquainted with him and his writings. He described Steve as\n\ntransparently brilliant, articulate in an on-the-spot sort of way. . . . He was also a bit feisty in an appealing way, ready to stand up and hold his intellectual ground, without being sectarian, when religious belief was occasionally condescended towards by other equally rigorous minds. His mind operated on warp drive, at three times the pace of my own. e range of provocative, high-level, cogent, informed, imaginative, o en experimental books that he produced—let alone his shorter works— leaves me slack-jawed. . . . Hence, when he became provoked by the richness and promise of Mormon thought and culture, and enamored of Mormon people in the latter years of his life, Mormonism received the attention of an extraordinarily knowledgeable, dramatically far-reaching mind. The result was a splash of illumination for Mormons and their observers, an implicit putting into context of more shallow and narrow attention to the Latter-day Saints, and a courageous, sometimes defiant reimagining of the Mormon and Christian past and present. He was an uncommon mind, an uncommon person. I will evermore miss a new Webb title on my shelf on an almost annual basis.\n\nSteve absolutely was an “uncommon mind” and “an uncommon person.” Writing with him was a delight. He wrote with passion and energy—and ideas seemed to burst forth from him like water from a hydrant. He was broad in his knowledge base, but he could see how all of it was interconnected. He was quite remarkable in this regard.\n\nJohn W. Welch—the Robert K. Thomas professor of law in the J. Reuben Clark Law School, and the founder of the Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies (FARMS)—spoke of Steve’s contributions in this way:\n\nThe death of Stephen Webb, which is nothing short of tragic, leaves me and all who even remotely knew him weakened and diminished, wondering what might have been. . . . With meteoric brilliance he swept across the open skies of the Mormon intellectual landscape. . . . Steve contributed so much to so many people, and had so much more yet to offer to all of us on this side of the veil of mortality, that one can only have faith, with glowing hope, that millions of souls on the other side will enjoy and embrace his knowing smile and collegial companionship as much as we have here. . . .\n\nSteve had a special knack for seeing virtuoso performances where lesser minds could see only trivial or marginal comments. This trait of Stephen’s no doubt explains his gripping fascination with Mormonism, the theology of which has been overlooked by so many others but which for Steve promised extraordinary usefulness to all the rest of Christianity. Steve recoiled against the unfortunate points of departure in modern scholarship that typically begins by doubting credible witnesses, dismisses God’s direct involvement physically in history, and that “claims, probably worst of all, an unearned sense of moral superiority over our spiritual and academic forefathers,” as Steve puts it.\n\n. . . The ligatures that bind us together with God and with each other have the potentialities and actualities to save and exalt this world which fell but not without plan and purpose. Stephen Webb lived, and lives, as solid evidence that this is so. I consider myself blessed by God that our lives intersected.\n\nDavid Paulsen, emeritus professor of philosophy at BYU (and the contemporary Mormon theologian whose writings were most in influential upon Stephen Webb) and Hal R. Boyd, special assistant to the president at Eastern Kentucky University, offered this tribute:\n\nLatter-day Saints have made many friends and allies with scholars of different faiths. Some laud Mormon piety and our pro-social communitarianism. Stephen H. Webb, however, was the rare Christian scholar to go beyond cultural commentary and methodically evaluate LDS theology, publishing multiple books and articles on the subject. . . . Stephen saw the Latter-day Saint doctrine of divine material embodi- ment as a novel way to reintroduce the Christian God to those whose worldview rejects the existence of anything outside the material uni- verse. Stephen was, in the words of Paul, an “example of the believers,” and his personal interactions among the Latter-day Saints were marked by Christian charity and goodwill. We are continually inspired by Stephen’s life as well as his theological legacy.\n\nIndeed, few outside of Mormonism have treated us more fairly—or taken us more seriously—than Steve. He didn’t shy away from pointing out our warts; but he could see beyond those, as he plumbed the depths of Mormon thought and surfaced with what he perceived as the gems of this unique brand of Christianity.\n\nTerryl Givens, who holds the James A. Bostwick Chair in English at the University of Richmond, shared this about Steve and his ability to see the good and valuable in the beliefs of others:\n\nKrister Stendahl famously spoke of “holy envy” as a vital but rare capacity in religious understanding. As with politics, few persons deeply vested in religion can demonstrate the moral generosity of appreciating the beautiful in another’s belief system. Steve was a shining exception, who had the magnanimity to unabashedly admire much he loved in Mormonism, and the intellectual acumen to recognize its theological strengths and early Christian precedents. We all benefitted from his friendship as well as his scholarship. With Steve, interfaith dialogue was genuinely beneficial to both parties with no condescending, and he will be sorely missed.\n\nScott Petersen, former director of the Rollins Center for Entrepre- neurship and Technology at Brigham Young University, said of Steve that he “was a very spiritually aware person who cherished the Savior.” Scott added that Steve\n\nrecognized that not everything from early Christianity was as neat and tidy as many churches wanted to make it. Accordingly, his open-minded approach allowed him to build bridges with many faiths and many individuals, even when they di ered somewhat from his own personal beliefs. Steve’s authentic approach allowed him to explore Mormonism objectively. He passionately shared his view that Mormons were sincere Christians who contributed signi cantly to the Christian community of believers. He was willing to stand rm against the popular culture that Mormons were not “orthodox” Christians. Steve engaged and collabo- rated openly with Mormon scholars, and he took seriously the Savior’s directive to seek Christian unity (John 17). He will be greatly missed.\n\nAs the greatest minds of Mormonism attest, Stephen Webb’s passing is a loss for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints—not simply because he was such a wonderful defender of our faith, but also because he was such a Christian man. Steve loved the Church, but each of us who knew him also felt his love for us as individuals. And so, at his passing, I look back on his life in solemn contemplation. I wonder how I might adequately summarize the remarkable life and contributions of this most extraordinary friend. Steve’s own words summarize what he believed was the reason he was so drawn to Mormonism.\n\nOne day, as Steve and I walked across the campus of Brigham Young University, he said to me, “Alonzo, I think I have a mission—a calling from God—to write on behalf of the Mormon Church. I can say things as an outsider that no Mormon could say or write; and people listen to me because I’m a Catholic—not a Latter-day Saint.” I remember thinking he just might be right about that there was nothing casual about this declaration from Steve’s lips. It was not something he had just thought up; it was something that he felt deeply. It was something the Spirit of God had revealed to him—and he was faithful to that calling. I will never forget an experience we had as the two of us knelt in the basement of his Brownsburg home to invite the Spirit to be with us as we prepared to leave for a lecture we were giving that evening in Indianapolis. Steve asked that we pray before we left and requested to offer the prayer himself. Without going into details, I will simply say—if I ever doubted before—I knew then that this was a man who felt deeply that God had called him to do something sacred, and he wanted desperately to magnify that calling in a way that was pleasing to his Father in Heaven. In his book Mormon Christianity: What Other Christians Can Learn from the Latter-day Saints, Steve wrote: “I am not a Mormon, but sometimes I wish I were one.” Each of us who knew him could feel that about Steve.\n\nFinally, in a tribute to Stephen, one of his former colleagues wrote: “He left his mark wherever he went.” That he did. Steve certainly left his mark upon my soul, and upon the minds and hearts of many Latter-day Saints. The scholarly world will never see Mormonism quite the same because of the teachings and testimony of our friend, Stephen H. Webb. And so, I close with Steve’s own words regarding Christ, Joseph Smith, and the Mormons—a personal testimony he penned only a few months before his passing:\n\nI believe that Jesus Christ is my Lord and Savior, and I would not intentionally believe anything that detracts from that. I also believe that surely many, perhaps most, maybe all of the things I believe about Him are incomplete, distorted, maybe even untrue, but that I will grow in the truth of Him and about Him in heaven. I would never say or do or believe anything that takes away His honor and glory as my God, the Messiah of the Jewish people, the source of the whole world’s salvation, who took upon Himself our sin on the cross, and indeed, the one who is the very reason and purpose of all of creation. I hope to be with Him forever. My journey with the Saints and into Mormonism is motivated solely by the hope and conviction that Joseph’s own journey was blazed by the light of Jesus Christ and that he understood his ministry as an attempt to be of service to Him. All glory be to Jesus, now and forevermore. Amen.\n\n“Clothed Upon With Glory”\n\nSacred Underwear and the Consecrated Life By Alonzo L. Gaskill\n\nThere are three ritual acts that pre-modern religions traditionally have in common: eating, washing and clothing. Ancient peoples engaged in rites of communion, wherein covenants with God and/or man were made and renewed through the partaking of food. Similarly, among most of the ancients, ceremonial washing was a requisite rite of passage with salvific connotations. The ritual act of clothing, receiving clothes, or being clothed has also held a sacral place in the faith of many of our predecessors.1 While each of these acts is sacred and symbolic, our attention here will be on the latter of the three—the idea of clothing as a symbol of consecration.\n\n“The transforming effect of clothes,” one source informs us, “has always given them considerable emblematic power.”2 The significant role played by clothing in ancient society is particularly apparent in the Bible, where prophets used clothing metaphorically to make ethical exhortations, send theological messages, or to show the status or character of significant figures.3 The importance of apparel in scripture and ceremony can be physical, economic, social, moral, or spiritual.4\n\nPriestly or religious clothing is often intended to represent “the garb of God”, and dressing in “special clothing” can denote a change in role or status.5 The changing of one’s clothes has long been a sign of consecration and preparation for “spiritual duties.”6 Thus, in the fourth century, Cyril of Jerusalem explained this about the Christian act of clothing: “As soon, then, as ye entered, ye put off your tunic; and this was an image of putting off the old man with his deeds.” Cyril then added: “May the soul which has once put him off [i.e., the ‘old man, which waxeth corrupt in the lusts of deceit’], never again put him on…”7 Thus, the sense for early Christians was that donning religious articles implied that one was a new person; committed and consecrated to his or her God. In many cultures, sacred garments are seen as a representation of the wearer’s moral and spiritual qualities—qualities developed largely because the wearer has faith in and devotion toward his or her God. Obviously not all clothing, in scripture or in life, is symbolic. Much of it is nothing more than practical. Nevertheless, literal and figurative meanings are intertwined in nearly every category of clothing.8 The apparel we wear speaks as loudly about who we are, what we desire, and what we will become, as does perhaps anything else.\n\nA Subject of Ridicule\n\nWhile members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints do not publicize the fact that they wear covenantal clothing—sacred, symbolic undergarments—it is no great secret either. Adult Latter-day Saints, as one of their most hallowed and significant rites of passage, enter into one of their Temples to receive their “Endowment”—a term which means “gift”.9 This rite of passage was defined by Brigham Young, the second president of the Mormon Church, as follows:\n\n“Your endowment is to receive all those ordinances in the house of the Lord, which are necessary for you, after you have departed this life, to enable you to walk back to the presence of the Father, passing the angels who stand as sentinels, …and gain your eternal exaltation in spite of earth and hell.”10 In other words, when a Mormon attends the Temple, he or she enters into covenants to live a moral, honest, faithful and Christian life. They hold that making these covenants helps them in their efforts to lay hold upon salvation. As part of that covenant-making process, Mormons receive a symbolic garment that they wear as a reminder of the covenants they have entered into—somewhat like a Roman Catholic priest and the clerical clothing he dons once he has taken holy orders. Catholic priests wear their clerical collars on the outside; Mormon’s wear their garments underneath their clothing. But the concept is not dramatically different.\n\nAs it relates to their symbolic value, beyond representing the wearer’s promises to God, for many Latter-day Saints the Temple garments are also a symbol of the flesh of Christ and the need for the wearer to seek to live a life of holiness. As faithful and consecrated living requires always keeping such truths at the forefront of one’s mind, Latter-day Saints feel it appropriate to wear the garments every day. Of course, Mormons do not wear them when bathing, swimming or doing similar activities. But if an activity can be performed while wearing them, Mormons will leave them on, much like traditional underwear. What is sacred in the minds of LDS- Christians is not the underwear itself, but what the underwear symbolizes. Thus, there is nothing “magic” about these items of covenantal clothing. They are simply a sacred reminder of one’s promise to try to be better; to be more holy in his daily walk.\n\nWhile sacred covenantal underclothing is not unique to Latter-day Saints, their use of such apparel tends to be misunderstood, as similar clothing often is by those “outside” of Judaism, Zoroastrianism, Sikhism and Eastern Orthodoxy. As a singular example on August 24, 2012, NBC’s “Rock Center” (with Brian Williams) aired a segment entitled “Mormons in America.” A portion of the program probed the fact that Temple endowed members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints wear special underwear. As part of the program, interviewers asked members of the Church the purpose of the garment and then, in an apparent effort to inform the audience, a man and woman were shown wearing nothing but a pair of LDS Temple Garments. Whether intentional or not, the NBC segment presented the concept of religious underwear (common to many ancient and modern religions) in such a way so as to make the practice of wearing such clothing seem not sacred, but somewhat weird—even cultish. In all probability, the producers of the NBC piece were unaware of the fact that millions upon millions of people today—whether Jew or Gentile—wear symbolic undergarments to remind them of the covenants they have entered into. Thus, though sometimes misunderstood or even mocked, the practice is foundational to many traditions—and serves as a powerful means of consecrating and focusing the life of the wearer.\n\nPriests of the Ancient Jewish Temple Cult\n\nAs attested in the Hebrew Bible, the priests and High Priest who served in the ancient Israelite Temple wore various articles of ritual clothing. It is widely accepted that one of those items of sacred apparel was a “special undergarment” in the form of “linen breeches” or underpants.11 One text refers to these as “femoralia” or “drawers.”12 The books of Exodus (28:42) and Leviticus (6:10) both tell us that the priests were to wear these “linen breeches,” which extended “from the loins even unto the thighs” (Exodus 28:42). In addition to the linen underpants, the priests also wore a “coat” or “shirt” on the upper half of their bodies, beneath their other liturgical vestments. In AV Exodus 28:39 we read: “And thou shalt embroider the coat of fine linen.” One source suggested that this coat or shirt was worn next to the skin and had sleeves. While scholars are not in complete agreement as to whether this sleeved shirt extended just slightly past the hips (like the Roman tunic), or perhaps all the way to the ankles (like the Greek chitōn),13 what is evident is that it was an undergarment of sacred significance.\n\nThe biblical text itself makes it clear that this priestly underwear was received as part of a process of consecration and induction into the holy priesthood. And while the scriptural text does not elaborate on their symbolic meaning, scholars almost universally hold that these garments were not simply practical: there was some emblematic meaning to the various articles donned by the temple priest.14 One text interprets the meaning of this holy underwear as follows: “The subject of holiness…is seen typified in each of the garments made of the fine twined linen, giving us an appreciation of the term ‘Holy Garments’. The coat [or undershirt] that clad his person would signify an holiness of the heart that beat beneath it…whilst these linen breeches [or underpants] that covered his nakedness declare an holiness of the flesh” or “desires and passions.” This same source adds: “The white coat” worn as an undergarment was “the emblem of righteousness.”15 One text on rites of passage noted that exchanging things or receiving gifts—including the receipt of ritual garments—binds the receiver to the giver. The receipt (or exchanging) of such items is equivalent to “pronouncing an oath” or entering into a covenant.16\n\nOrthodox Judaism\n\nDrawing on their own scriptural tradition and liturgical heritage, modern male Orthodox and Ultra-Orthodox Jews also wear an undergarment required of the faithful men in Hebrew Bible times.17 In Deuteronomy 22:12 we read: “Thou shalt make thee fringes upon the four quarters of thy vesture, wherewith thou coverest thyself.”18 The garment of contemporary Orthodox and Ultra-Orthodox Jewry is not the “breeches” of the Levitical priest but, rather, an undershirt, of sorts, which they call tallit katan—sometimes translated “small tallit” or “little covering.”19 This holy article has the appearance of a small poncho-like shirt, and is worn under the outermost clothing by pious Jewish men.20 On its four corners are twisted and knotted tassels called ẓiẓit (or tzitzit)—meaning “fringes.” The 613 knots in the four tassels or cords are symbolic of the 613 commandments in the Law of Moses—commandments that Orthodox Jews seek to live each day.\n\nWhile the wearing of this sacred undergarment is tied to the Torah, Jewish tradition also explains how and why God (i.e., YHWH) commanded the Jews to wear special underwear— different from that found among their non-Jewish neighbors.\n\nThe sin of the Sabbath-breaker was the occasion that gave rise to God’s commandment of ẓiẓit to Israel. For He said to Moses, “Dost thou know how it came to pass that this man broke the Sabbath?” Moses: “I do not know.” God: “On week days he wore phylacteries on his head and phylacteries on his arm to remind him of his duties, but on the Sabbath day, on which no phylacteries may be worn, he had nothing to call his duties to his mind, and he broke the Sabbath. Go now, Moses, and find for Israel a commandment the observance of which is not limited to week days only, but which will influence them on Sabbath days and on holy days as well.” Moses selected the commandment of ẓiẓit, the sight of which will recall to the Israelites all the other commandments of God.21\n\nThus, according to this traditional account, for Jews who wear the tallit katan, it is a gift from God. It is a daily reminder of the covenants, promises and obligations the wearer is under. It is a constant reminder of what God expects of him, and what he has promised his God he will seek to be. As the Encyclopaedia Judaica states, “strictly observant Jews wear the tallit katan under their upper garment the whole day, so as constantly to fulfill the biblical commandment of ẓiẓit (Num. 15:39), a reminder to observe all the commandments of the Torah.”22\n\nFor many of the most faithful, this undergarment has powers—powers by which the wearer can be protected.23 Illustrative of this is the following story from the Babylonian Talmud.\n\nThere was a man who was very careful in his observance of the mitzvah (i.e., the Law). He was ever found wearing the tallit katan, as the God of Israel had commanded. One day he heard of a prostitute in a far-off city and determined to make a visit. As the moment of his indiscretion arrived, now wearing nothing but his sacred undergarment, a miracle took place. The four knotted cords of his garment “struck him across the face”, thereby awakening him to the sinful choice he was about to make. Stunned by the miraculous occurrence, he and the prostitute dropped to the floor to contemplate what they had just witnessed. As the man explained to the harlot about how his fringes had testified of his evil desires, she was spiritually moved. She left her life of sin, followed him home, earnestly studied the Torah, converted, married him, and they lived happily ever after.24\n\nThe Jewish undergarments (tallit katan) are not only a powerful symbol of the covenant relationship of the Jew with his God, they are also a gift from that God to protect and deliver the wearer from sin, temptation and, therefore, damnation. As one source notes, “to be enfolded by the tallit is regarded as being enveloped by the holiness of the commandments of the Torah, denoting a symbolic subjection to the Divine Will.”25 The ẓiẓit, or “tassels” attached to the four corners of the sacred undergarment serve as a “talisman” or “amulet” for many who wear it. For the faithful, they function “as a protection against immoral conduct (an interpretation derived from Numbers 15:39).”26\n\nUnique in our day, and different from the underwear of his neighbors, the Modern- Orthodox and Ultra-Orthodox Jewish man wears his tallit katan as a symbol and reminder of his commitment to live a holy, faithful and obedient life; and as a help in so doing. As one encyclopedia points out: “The rabbis regarded the ẓiẓit as a reminder to the Jew to observe the religious duties…”27\n\nZoroastrianism\n\nLike Orthodox Jews, faithful Zoroastrians also have a sacred undergarment that is worn throughout one’s adult life, and as a representation of the wearer’s commitment to Ahura Mazda (i.e., God) and the ways of the Parsee tradition. Unlike in Judaism, however, in Zoroastrianism the garment is worn by men and women.\n\nSomewhere between a child’s seventh and fifteenth year28 he or she participates in the Navjote (or Naojot) initiation rite.29 During that rite the youth is washed and endowed with a rather plain white “sacred undershirt” which is to be worn next to the skin the remainder of the Zoroastrian’s life. This undergarment, known as a sudreh (meaning “protection” or “advantageous path”), has a small pocket on the front side, in the center and right at the neckline. This pocket is called the gireh-bân (meaning “purse” or “bag of righteousness”), and the wearer is to metaphorically fill it with good works, good thoughts and good deeds each day of his or her life. It is a reminder to the wearer that while he or she is free to pursue wealth, seeking personal righteousness is even more important.30 It is a “symbol of the necessity of (a) obedience to God, (b) closing up the door against sin and (c) breaking up the power of destruction.”31 Consequently, one text states that the wearer “makes his ‘sudreh’ an armor, a protection against which all attacks of demon or evil forces become futile. Thus he becomes the real conqueror of evil powers.”32 For Zoroastrians, then, this garment is a gift which provides the wearer with protection when it is utilized as God intended.\n\nIn addition to the sacred undershirt, initiates also receive a belt of sorts to be worn over the sudreh. This cord/belt is called the kusti (meaning “boundary” or “limit”—as it divides the upper body from the lower regions). Symbolically speaking, it is a reminder to the wearer of the need to nurture the body’s “higher characteristics” (i.e., the things of the heart and brain), while controlling (and, in some cases, suppressing) the “lower characteristics” or physical appetites (e.g., greed, lust, etc.).33 One Zoroastrian text informs us that “it is incumbent on all those of the good religion, women and men, every one [sic.] who attains to fifteen years [of age], to wear the sacred thread girdle.” By this “girdle” it is believed “the whole of demons and fiends” are “made extinct.”34 Because the “sacred thread girdle” or kusti has traditionally been made out of wool, it represents to the wearer the need for innocence and purity. The 72 threads with which it is woven are symbols of the 72 chapters of the sacred Zoroastrian scriptural text known as the Yasna. During his daily prayers, the wearer of the kusti unties and reties the knots of the “sacred girdle.” This ritual untying and tying serves to “cement” the wearer’s “commitment to the faith”35 and protect him from sins.36\n\nFor practitioners of the Parsee faith, wearing this garment serves to remind them of their covenantal responsibilities to their God (Ahura Mazda). As they daily untie and retie the kusti (while reciting their prayers), their obligations to live a holy life are brought to their remembrance, as is their promise to fill the gireh-bân with good things—holy things. In Zoroastrian belief, God had twin sons: one “beneficent” and one “hostile.” The good son sought for good things; the bad son for that which was evil. Just as these two sons chose different paths, each Zoroastrian has two paths presented to him—the good and the evil. The sacred undergarments of the Zoroastrians (the sudreh and kusti) are a protection from evil, helping the practitioner to focus on the path of God, and to not be seduced by the path of sin.\n\nSikhism\n\nIn the year 1699, the last of the mortal Gurus—Gobind Singh—founded the Khālsā; an initiated body of believers who had participated in the Amrit Sanchar (a rite of initiation appearing much like a Christian baptismal ritual). These initiated members of the order served as members of the 18th century Sikh military.37 As part of their formation, Gobind Singh introduced the “Five Ks”; five articles worn by members of the Khālsā as a statement to the world about who they are, and as a reminder to the wearer as to what he was obligated by covenant to be. From that time forward, Sikhs who have been initiated into this “castless fraternity” stood out, because of their unique appearance.38 The “Five Ks” consist of:\n\nKesh—Uncut hair. This is a symbol for naturalness before God. For some Sikhs it represents the need to accept who you are and the way God has made you; to accept God’s will, even if it seems to be different from your own.39\n\nKangha—A comb, more symbolic than functional. It highlights the need for the faithful practitioner to exercise “mental order”; to control the mind and, thereby, control the body; to exercise “controlled spirituality” (i.e., to consciously live a spiritually centered life).\n\nKirpan—A steel dagger, sometimes worn in the form of an actual knife, and other times worn as a pin or brooch. This is emblematic of the Sikh’s willingness to stand up for the truth, and to push back on aggression toward their faith.40 When a brooch made of two crossed swords is worn, it is sometimes seen as a symbol for the combination of political and religious authority—acknowledging that man would do better if his civil laws were God’s laws, rather than trying to create his own.\n\nKara—A steel bracelet, typically worn on the right wrist. This is representative of the need to be disciplined in one’s actions, thereby developing unity with God. It implies that what one does or pursues should be in accordance with God’s will and wants. Consequently, the bracelet also denotes the human who seeks to develop the attributes of the Divine by living in harmony with the divine.\n\nKach—Knee-length, baggy, white underpants. These stress the need to have “moral strength” and a chaste life. They are a representation of the Sikh commitment to not have sexual relations outside the bonds of marriage.41\n\nWhile each of these items were originally associated solely with the Khālsā, today the “Five Ks” are commonly worn by many Sikhs—and by both sexes. One scholar noted: “Not all Sikhs have been members of the Khālsā. Nevertheless, the institution has come to define the image of the Sikh to outsiders and to be regarded by many within the community as the orthodox expression of its identity.”42\n\nElsewhere we read:\n\nThose Sikhs who elect to take initiation as members of the Khālsā must swear when they undergo the pāhul ceremony always to observe the Five Ks. Women as well as men can undergo this ceremony and the women who do so must also promise to wear the Five Ks. These are the Amrit-dhari Sikhs (those who have drunk the amrit of initiation), as opposed to the Kes-dhari (those who [simply] maintain the Kes [or uncut hair]). All Amrit-dhari Sikhs are also Kes-dhari, but only a small proportion of Kes-dhari are Amrit-dhari, for only a small proportion of Sikhs take initiation. No one knows precisely just what that proportion is…\n\nAre those who are not Amrit-dhari Sikhs therefore freed from observing the Five Ks? In theory they may be released, but the strict variety of Sikh thinking certainly does not agree. According to this strict view every Sikh, whether formally a member of the Khālsā order or not, is bound to observe the Five Ks.43\n\nTechnicall"
