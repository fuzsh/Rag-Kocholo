        "text": "Alexander L. Baugh is a professor and former chair of the Department of Church History and Doctrine at Brigham Young University, where he has been a full-time faculty member since 1995. He received his BS from Utah State University and his MA and PhD degrees from Brigham Young University.\n\nHe specializes in researching and writing about the Missouri period of early Church history (1831–39). He is the author, editor, or co-editor of twelve books, including three volumes of the Document series of The Joseph Smith Papers (Documents, volumes 4, 5, and 6).\n\nDr. Alonzo L. Gaskill was reared in Independence, Missouri (as a practicing member of the Greek Orthodox Church). His grandparents came to the United States (from Greece) at the turn of the 20th century, and he was reared in a traditional Greek home in the heart of what early members of the Church called “Zion.”\n\nConverting to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints during his college years, Alonzo served a full-time mission to Great Britain one year after his baptism. Upon returning from his mission, he decided to change his career path—dropping his longtime dream of being a mortician (no kidding) for a career teaching religion. He earned degrees in Philosophy, Theology/World Religions, and Biblical Studies, and has taught Seminary and Institute, but has spent the majority of his career as a professor of World Religions at Brigham Young University.\n\nI grew up in a family that had the opportunity to travel quite often. My father worked in the airline industry so we were able to take family trips every year to Hawaii, Mexico, or other great destinations. When I was 16 my father and I had the opportunity to travel to Kenya, Africa on a wildlife safari. I was so amazed to see all of the different animals in their natural setting and surroundings. I think at this point in my life I was hooked on travel! I started working at Beehive Travel in 1988 delivering airline tickets while attending college. After graduating from BYU with a B.S. in marketing, I decided to stay in the travel Industry with Morris Murdock. I have been blessed to be able to travel to so many different areas of the world and to experience different cultures, different life styles, and remarkable scenery.\n\nChad S. Hawkins began his series of temple artwork in 1989, at the age of seventeen to support his two-year mission in Frankfurt, Germany, for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Upon his return in 1993, he continued with his artwork while pursuing his education of becoming a dentist. Just prior to his application to dental school, Chad realized that he would be sacrificing his art career to the discipline required in dental school. It was at that time that he made the adjustment from being a zoology and chemistry major to an art major, graduating from Weber State University with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree.\n\nDr. Craig James Ostler and his wife, Sandy, have a special love for sharing sacred and meaningful sites with fellow travelers. They help others to feel the power of being on site as they read, study, and ponder the scriptures on their tours. Participants return home with increased appreciation and understanding of the lives of the Savior, prophets, apostles, and every-day people, ancient and modern. Dr. Ostler has been a religious educator for more than 40 years, teaching with the Seminaries and Institutes for 15 years and as a Professor at Brigham Young University for 28 years. He has authored over 30 books and articles, produced more than 50 videos, as well as taught Adult Religion classes and at BYU Education Week. He was co-director of the BYU Church History Travel Study program before retiring from BYU in 2020. He has served on a General Church Writing Committee, as a Bishop, and on three High Councils.\n\nDean Garner's educational experiences reflect a great love of learning and of ancient history. He earned a bachelor’s degree in art, with an emphasis in education and photography, from Weber State University in 1987. He received a master’s degree from Lesley College in Cambridge, Massachusetts, focusing on curriculum development in education. His graduate work was performed at the University of Arizona in Near Eastern studies, with an emphasis in archaeology. His experience with the Holy Land has been a lifetime pursuit in and out of formal settings, developing into a great interest in Holy Land peoples and other ancient cultures.\n\nDr. L. Dean Marriott has taught the Life of Jesus from Holy Scripture to thousands of students at BYU, Univ. of Utah and other colleges for over 30 years. His love of the scriptures and knowledge of biblical locations enables him to present a powerful and unique holy land experience for the many travelers on the tours he directs.\n\nHis well-planned itinerary is not a typical drive-by tour of the holy lands. It attempts to provide interactive scriptural experiences by (1) placing participants at the actual scriptural settings of events in the sequence they were experienced by Jesus, (2) staying at on-site guesthouses (in Galilee at water's edge, and inside old Jerusalem adjacent to the wailing wall, etc.), (3) walking in the very pathways of Jesus (down the Mt. of Olives into the Old City, then following his footsteps from the pavement stones where he was scourged to the crucifixion site at Golgatha then to the Garden Tomb, etc.), (4) experiencing special settings (including a twilight devotional at Bethlehem's shepherd's field, a Passover style meal in an upper room inside the old city, followed by evening reflection in the Garden of Gethsemane). Other Bible events shared at appropriate times.\n\nDennis Leavitt married Nykele Gagon in 1985. They are the parents of 4 children and 4 grandchildren. Dennis was employed by the LDS Church Educational System from 1985 – 2011. His assignments included the MTC, various seminaries and institutes of religion, EFY, and adult religion. He was also part of the S&I Curriculum and Training Team from 1995-2000.\n\nThe Leavitt’s have been directing tours for the past 25 years to the sacred sites of the Restoration and the Holy Land. His knowledge, focus, and comfortable teaching style help make each trip a meaningful adventure for every participant.\n\nDr. Brady Allred is Artistic Director and Conductor of the Salt Lake Choral Artists, an organization of seven choral ensembles.

Dirkmaat is an assistant professor of Church History and Doctrine at Brigham Young University. He received his PhD in American History from the University of Colorado in 2010 where he studied nineteenth-century American expansionism and foreign relations. His dissertation was titled “Enemies Foreign and Domestic: US Relations with Mormons in the US Empire in North America, 1844–1854.”\n\nHe worked as a historian and writer for the Church History Department from 2010 to 2014 with the Joseph Smith Papers Project and served as a volume editor/historian for Documents Volume 1, the lead historian/volume editor on Documents Volume 3, and as a historian/editor on Administrative Volume 1, Council of Fifty, Minutes.

Holm now finds himself traveling the world to share the experiences of America's World War II-era soldiers, sailors and airmen.\n\n\"After spending so many years telling my own bobsled story and showing my gold medals, it is an honor and a pleasure to get to share their stories and display their medals,\" Jeremy says. \"We owe so much to The Greatest Generation and while it was a privilege to wear a uniform with 'United States' on it, it was nothing compared to what they did on the islands in the Pacific, on the beaches of Normandy, in the sands of Africa and on oceans around the world and the skies above.\"\n\nJeremy is the author of three books on the 11th Airborne Division in World War II, frequently lectures at military museums across the nation, and serves in the 11th Airborne Division Association. His YouTube videos have brought a deeper understanding of the airborne arm of America's military during World War II, especially for his grandfather's 11th Airborne Division. Before his passing at age 99, Jeremy had promised his grandfather, 1LT Andrew Carrico, that he would do all he could to tell the story of the 11th Airborne. After over a decade of interviewing the last living Paratroopers and troopers of this division, Jeremy has expanded his knowledge and understanding of World War II to include the European Theater, especially D-Day, as well as the entire Pacific Theater and the North Africa Campaign.\n\nKay Godfrey is a period historian of the life of the prophet Joseph Smith.\n\nHe is a graduate of Brigham Young University.

Each time we visit an archaeological site or view an ancient artifact that might have existed during the time of the Book of Mormon or Bible, our understanding, appreciation, and desire to study the Word of God increases.\n\nRoger C.
