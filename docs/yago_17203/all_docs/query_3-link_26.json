Americans watched in record numbers as the epic aired on eight consecutive nights and went on to receive an unprecedented 37 Emmy nominations (winning for nine, including Outstanding Limited Series). Haley wrote in TV Guide: ' 'Roots' speaks of the American human drama, in which ancestrally we all came from somewhere across the ocean.'"
