Bodies that copulate, bodies that reproduce, bodies that replicate, change, decay—or divide—produce anxiety about the boundaries of self and identity. Reproduction, like evolution, reminds us that we are ever in flux, that change is inevitable. Birth, like death, forces us to acknowledge the limits of our bodies and our 'selves.' Additionally, this age of epidemics and viral warfare incites dystopic visions of a future where the effective reproducers are micro-organisms, where humans have been replaced by a replicating other. We seek to explore not only the biological imperative of preserving a species, but also our search for origins, our search for ourselves, our desires, our sexual identities, our gods.\n\nWe invite perspectives that explore identity, bodies, boundaries, sexuality and futurity. We likewise invite reflections on whether the nature of our origins tells us anything about who and what we are; whether it lays the ground for understanding what we will become and how our future will unfold. What is the nature of our transition from birth through life to death? Is the end present in the beginning, and does this complicate our notions of evolutions and transitions as forward progress? What does it mean to be pregnant? To impregnate? What concerns are raised about a woman's body historically, culturally, politically, her ability to feed, grow and harbour new life, as well as her control over her own reproductive destiny? What about bodies that replicate without sex? Cloning? Hermaphroditic reproduction? What about non-human reproduction, about invasive species, about viral epidemics?\n\nWe encourage scholarly contributions from inter, multi and transdisciplinary perspectives, from practitioners working in all contexts, professionals, ngo's and those from the voluntary sector. We will entertain submissions drawn from literature, medicine, politics, social history, film, television, graphic novels and manga, from science to science fiction.\n\nTopics may include but are not limited to:\n\n-Historical medical discourses about reproduction\n\n-The monstrosity of birth: monstrous births\n\n-Birth in the dystopic narrative\n\n-Freak(s) – of nature; of technology; accidents of birth\n\n-Religious discourse of reproduction\n\n-Gender and biomedicine\n\n-Queering reproduction\n\n-Motherhood/fatherhood/parenthood\n\n-Technologies of and for the body\n\n-Reproduction and ethical practice\n\n-Managing reproductive bodies: law, health care and medical practice\n\n-The \"changing\" body: rebirth and metamorphosis\n\n-Invading and possessing bodies\n\n-Eugenics, social biology and inter-racial generation\n\n-Genetic engineering and \"nightmare\" reproductions\n\n-Science fiction: inter-species reproduction: non-human reproduction\n\n-Viral reproduction and pandemic\n\nWhat to submit:\n\nThe Steering Group particularly welcomes the submission of pre-formed panel proposals. Presentations will also be considered on any related theme. 300 word abstracts should be submitted by Friday 4th January 2013. 300 word abstracts should be submitted simultaneously to both Organising Chairs; abstracts may be in Word, WordPerfect, or RTF formats with the following information and in this order:\n\na) author(s), b) affiliation, c) email address, d) title of abstract, e) body of abstract, f) up to 10 keywords.\n\nE-mails should be entitled: BR1 Abstract Submission\n\nPlease use plain text (Times Roman 12) and abstain from using footnotes and any special formatting, characters or emphasis (such as bold, italics or underline).

Work on women, LGBT and black modernists, as well as marketplace, magazine and middlebrow studies, have expanded the canon, and yet such 'alternative' modernisms are often studied and discussed in isolation, leading to a splintering of the field. This fragmented approach to modernist studies is in danger of not reflecting – or taking into account – the wider cultural and public sphere which modernisms existed in and engaged with. Furthermore, many modernisms, in particular national and regional forms and movements in Europe, still remain largely uncharted.\n\nThis conference attempts to provide a common forum for the exchange of ideas and examples across fields, disciplines and nationalities. It will give scholars an opportunity to explore both underexplored modern(ist) forms, mediums, texts, writers and artists, and the relationships between them, working towards a more holistic conception of how 'alternative' modernisms operated.\n\nIndeed, the conference will consider the extent to which all modernisms can be viewed as part of a network of alternatives – to tradition, realism, representation, mass culture or even to each other. As such, the conference hopes to reassess – and problematize – modernisms's approaches to the past, to modernity (or 'modernities'), to other modernisms, and their position within modern culture, exploring new theories and approaches for studying modernisms.\n\nConsidering that Welsh modernism in particular still resides on the margins of British modernism – geographically and intellectually – Cardiff is the perfect place for such a reassessment. The conference will also host the inaugural meeting of the Welsh Network of Modernist Studies, a new umbrella organisation which will organise and promote interdisciplinary events that foster links between modernist scholars in Wales.\n\nSubmissions are invited that engage with all aspects of the title. Papers might include (but are not limited to):\n\n• Modernisms as alternatives to realism, representation, religion, tradition, linearity, mass culture, 'grand narratives' etc.\n\n• Modernism/modern(ist) thought as an alternative way of seeing/theorising the world\n\n• 'Alternative' modernisms – modernisms outside the modernist canon or mainstream, whether for reasons of race, ethnicity, nationality, language, gender, sexuality, class, geography, aesthetics, ideology, chronology etc.\n\n• Middlebrow, 'intermodern' or popular forms as an alternative to High Modernism\n\n• Alternative ideologies and aesthetics within the (retrospectively applied) field of modernism and the historical avant-garde – differences and contradictions in beliefs and approaches\n\n• Alternative ways of living/lifestyles by modernist figures\n\n• Alternative chronologies, definitions, canons or readings of modernism\n\n• Movement of modernism from an alternative to its contemporary position in the academic, artistic and literary mainstream canon.\n\nSubmissions are encouraged on all modern(ist) forms and disciplines, including art, design, fashion, film, literature, drama, music, performance and architecture, as well as modern theory and philosophy. We especially welcome interdisciplinary approaches, ranging across literary studies, history, cultural history, art history, philosophy and critical theory as well as other disciplines in the humanities.\n\nProposals for papers (20 minutes) should include the paper title; the delegate's name, address and email; a summary of the proposed paper (300 words); and a short bio (100 words). Panel proposals (3 speakers) are also welcome; please send the above details for each speaker plus a short description of the panel as a whole.\n\nProposals should be sent to Emma West at modernisms@cardiff.ac.uk by 31 October 2012.\n\n** UPDATE: We are pleased to announce four postgraduate bursaries for students studying outside the UK, funded by the School of English Literature, Communication and Philosophy, Cardiff University. Bursaries will be awarded to postgraduate research students who have had a paper accepted at the Alternative Modernisms conference and will include both a conference fee waiver and a contribution to travel.

Her pivotal work situates Melville's most famous novel among \"an impressive array of interpretive discourses—from literary renditions of biblical texts to traditional commentaries (among them, Calvin's commentaries and rabbinic lore), Gnostic mythos, popular sermons, political speeches, comparative accounts of religions and mythologies, and biblical encyclopedias\" (2). A recent surge of scholarly interest in Clarel—Melville's primary statement on matters of faith and spirituality—foregrounds the need to extend this work of religious contextualization beyond Moby-Dick, and this panel seeks papers that reconsider Melville's engagement with religion in his short fiction, poems, lectures, or other novels. Essays might address questions such as: Do Melville's religious views evolve over time and in response to the emergence of new exegetical tools or texts? How does Melville represent non-Christian religions? What role does genre play in the battle between Darwin's \"prosing Science\" and Rama's unearthly \"verse\"?\n\nPapers responding to these or other, related questions are solicited for one of two panels sponsored by the Herman Melville Society at the 2013 meeting of the American Literature Association (May 23-26) in Boston. Please send proposals of up to 300 words and a CV or brief biography to Zach Hutchins (hutchinz@byu.edu) by January 3, 2013.\n\ncfp categories: americanethnicity_and_national_identitygeneral_announcementsinterdisciplinaryreligionscience_and_culture 48262Panel/Roundtable on Teaching Latina/o Literature, 10/25/12 (for Haciendo Caminos conference, NYC, March 7-9, 2013)Jane Hseu, Assistant Professor of English, Dominican University (River Forest, IL)jhseu@dom.edu1349886424americancultural_studies_and_historical_approachesethnicity_and_national_identitygeneral_announcementsinterdisciplinarypostcolonialfull name / name of organization: Jane Hseu, Assistant Professor of English, Dominican University (River Forest, IL)contact email: jhseu@dom.edu\n\nSeeking participants for a panel/roundtable on teaching Latina/o literature for the 1st Biennial U.S. Latina/o Literary Theory and Criticism Conference: Haciendo Caminos: Mapping the Futures of U.S. Latina/o Literatures at John Jay College of Criminal Justice,City University of New York, March 7-9, 2013 (http://call-for-papers.sas.upenn.edu/node/45902).

If you're interested in novel to film adaptations, short story to television adaptations, film to novel adaptations, stage play to radio adaptations, theme park attraction to film adaptations, video game to blog adaptations, or any other kind of adaptation you can think of then kindly submit them!\n\nThis year we are particularly interested in \"cultural adaptations.\" But you may want to imagine \"culture\" as a fairly broad category. Bakhtin argues that any time an author includes a distinct voice in a work of art then aspects of culture cannot help but follow. When Sally Hays tells Holden Caulfield that \"There'll be oodles of marvelous places to go,\" readers almost instantly know something about her as a person and as member of a particular class. In other words, her culture begins to show. How have adaptors dealt with these cultural aspects of particular works, particularly as those works have been adapted for different audiences, time periods, and countries?\n\nAs always, we consider \"adaptation\" a way of looking at texts more than a particular brand of texts. Thus we welcome papers on video game adaptations, new media adaptations, literature to literature adaptations, and radio adaptations along with film adaptations. Papers on any and all aspects of adaptation will be considered.\n\nALL PROPOSALS AND ABSTRACTS MUST BE SUBMITTED TO THE PCA DATABASE http://pcaaca.org/national-conference-2/proposing-a-presentation-at-the-....\n\ncfp categories: african-americanamericanchildrens_literaturefilm_and_televisiongeneral_announcementsgraduate_conferenceshumanities_computing_and_the_internetinterdisciplinarymedievalpopular_culturetheatre 48266EREID 2013 - Sustainability Research in the Social and Human Sciences : Why ?

Dialogue between the various disciplines within the SHS is unavoidable, as is exchange with researchers in the life sciences. Even if there currently exists a general consensus on the reality of a multidimensional ecological crisis (radical climate change, depletion of resources, loss of biodiversity…), the positioning of the social sciences researcher is more controversial. The aim of this conference is to give researchers in all areas of SHS (management sciences, economics, sociology, the philosophy of science, political science, law, psychology…) the opportunity to dialogue on these questions: what position should they adopt on the issue of sustainability? What is their role and what mission should they assign themselves?\n\nConference website : http://ereid2013.sciencesconf.org/?lang=en\n\ncfp categories: interdisciplinaryinternational_conferences 48267Mapping Animality II: Considerations of Animal and Human Space (ACLA Annual Meeting, Toronto, April 4-7 2013)Sundhya Walther/Sarah Henderson, University of Torontosundhya.walther@utoronto.ca1349900926cultural_studies_and_historical_approachesecocriticism_and_environmental_studiesethnicity_and_national_identityfilm_and_televisiongender_studies_and_sexualityinterdisciplinaryinternational_conferencespopular_culturepostcolonialscience_and_culturetheorytwentieth_century_and_beyondvictorianfull name / name of organization: Sundhya Walther/Sarah Henderson, University of Torontocontact email: sundhya.walther@utoronto.ca\n\nFor full information: http://www.acla.org/acla2013/mapping-animality-ii-considerations-of-anim...\n\nAcross disciplinary, geographical, and linguistic boundaries, scholars have united to ask: where is the animal? From the animal's place in philosophical discourse, to its position as one of literature's key metaphorical concepts, to the troubling presence of animal bodies in contemporary art, the animal's centrality to centuries of human discourse is undeniable. At the same time, the dwindling space that animal bodies occupy in the world is increasingly under human surveillance and control. At this juncture of science and the humanities, of visual and literary arts, of wildness and enclosure, of flesh and machine, is it ever possible to locate the animal?\n\nThis panel will operate in conjunction with Mapping Animals I, which is more broadly interested in the politics of cultural representations of animality. While we share these interests, we wish to orient them more particularly around questions of space. This panel invites papers that consider the physical, ontological, or ethical location of the animal from a diversity of perspectives.\n\nTopics may include (but are not limited to):\n\nTracking devices that create animal maps\n\n'Crittercams' and the documentation of animal perspectives of space\n\nThe location of animality in the body\n\nReservation of land for wildlife\n\nAnimals in human space (strays, feral animals, urban wildlife, companion animals\n\nPractices of enclosure (zoos, circuses, laboratories, factory farms)\n\nThe animal within the human\n\nThe location of the animal in philosophy, literature, or visual art\n\nThe position of the animal vis à vis the human\n\nSEMINAR KEYWORDS: animal; space; ecology; technology; surveillance; posthumanism; conservation; food; speciesism; ethics; representation; mapping; enclosure\n\ncfp categories: cultural_studies_and_historical_approachesecocriticism_and_environmental_studiesethnicity_and_national_identityfilm_and_televisiongender_studies_and_sexualityinterdisciplinaryinternational_conferencespopular_culturepostcolonialscience_and_culturetheorytwentieth_century_and_beyondvictorian 48268CFP---Beyond Tattoos & Scars: Breaking the Stereotypes of Tattoos within Latino Representations on StageSubmitting Panel for the 37th Comparative Drama Conference; Text & Presentation in Baltimoredsicre@bmcc.cuny.edu1349901911cultural_studies_and_historical_approachesethnicity_and_national_identitytheatrefull name / name of organization: Submitting Panel for the 37th Comparative Drama Conference; Text & Presentation in Baltimorecontact email: dsicre@bmcc.cuny.edu\n\nCFP; For the 37th Comparative Drama Conference; Text & Presentation (April 4-6, 2013 in Baltimore)\n\nWe invite proposals of individual papers to submit for a panel at the conference.\n\nOur working title is : Beyond Tattoos & Scars: Breaking the Stereotypes of Tattoos within Latino Representations on Stage\n\nWe would like to organize a session panel that would look at breaking Latino stereotypes found on stage in relevance to tattoos and scars.\n\nWe would like to do a call for papers from scholars or artists who would be interested in participating and presenting a paper.\n\nPlease send your a 250 word abstract with paper title, author's name, institutional affiliation, and status by Nov 1 to:\n\nDaphnie Sicre\n\ndsicre@bmcc.cuny.edu.\n\ncfp categories: cultural_studies_and_historical_approachesethnicity_and_national_identitytheatre 48269CFP Archiving ActivismSpecial Edition of Archival Sciencebenjamin.alexander@qc.cuny.edu1349906146african-americanamericancultural_studies_and_historical_approachesecocriticism_and_environmental_studiesethnicity_and_national_identitygender_studies_and_sexualityhumanities_computing_and_the_internetinterdisciplinaryjournals_and_collections_of_essayspopular_culturescience_and_culturetwentieth_century_and_beyondfull name / name of organization: Special Edition of Archival Sciencecontact email: benjamin.alexander@qc.cuny.edu\n\nCFP\n\nSpecial Edition, Archival Science: Archiving Activism\n\nEditors: Ben Alexander and Andrew Flinn\n\nThe proposed Special Edition will explore the myriad connections between contemporary archival practice and activism. This is a topic which although not new is one of rising contemporary significance as archive materials, the institutions which hold them and the many archivists which look after them are increasingly recognized and actively recruited in the cause of political and social justice. This comes at a time when notions of a more active, collaborative and participatory archival practice is gaining currency in the professional archival world.\n\nArticle topics may include but are not limited to:\n\nthe ways in which mainstream archives and archivists work to preserve activist struggles of the past (including for instance the civil rights movement in the American South, struggles for equality and against discrimination, radical political movements of the left and right as well as across divided and antagonistic communities);\n\nhow the establishment of archives and the use of history is considered by some activists (including community, feminist, queer, social movement, anti- discrimination and civil rights activists) to be a core component of their political activities either in independently‐controlled and autonomous archives or in partnership with mainstream memory‐sites in universities and elsewhere;\n\nand finally global moves to ensure preservation and use of the documentation of social and political atrocities (including genocide, human rights abuses and repressive regimes) in Truth and Reconciliation, criminal tribunals and other social justice processes has increasingly involved archivists as key active participants in on-going struggles for Human Rights and Justice.\n\nPlease send paper proposals to either Ben Alexander (Benjamin.Alexander@qc.cuny.edu) to Andrew Flinn (a.flinn@ucl.ac.uk).\n\nProposals of no more than 250 words are due no later than November 15.

Diasporas forge and decimate local communities, call into question the boundaries of the nation-state, and reconfigure international relations. Ideally, they can result in the creation of new modes of social relations by producing opportunities for education and work and also encouraging the cross-fertilization of peoples, ideas, and arts. Yet migration has historically often been the result of forced labor, persecution, war, environmental degradation, decolonization and neo-imperialism, and the unrelenting spread of global capital. In response, the modern nation-state, obsessed with securing its borders against external threats, polices boundaries through a proliferation of documentation (passports, visas, identity cards, birth certificates).\n\nAgainst the backdrop of this tumultuous history, this seminar is particularly interested in exploring all incarnations of the contemporary migrant: exile, expatriate, alien, refugee, and undocumented worker. We are interested in how diasporic communities have been imagined and represented in literature or visual arts during the last century. Possible topics may include the following: How do diasporic communities re-configure national boundaries? How do networks of global capital, trans-nationalism, and cosmopolitanism put pressure upon, undermine, and/or complicate the creation of diasporic communities? In what ways are diasporas inclusionary or exclusionary and how do those within the diaspora negotiate integration, assimilation, and/or multiculturalism? How can we read the \"feminization\" of contemporary diasporas? And how do migrants deal with complicated ideas of home and belonging while crossing state lines?\n\nPlease direct any questions to Sheshalatha Reddy sheshalatha.reddy@Howard.edu and Parama Sarkar parama.sarkar@utoledo.edu.\n\ncfp categories: cultural_studies_and_historical_approachesecocriticism_and_environmental_studiesethnicity_and_national_identityfilm_and_televisiongender_studies_and_sexualityinterdisciplinaryinternational_conferencesmodernist studiespoetrypopular_culturepostcolonialscience_and_culturetheatretheorytravel_writingtwentieth_century_and_beyond 48273[UPDATE] disClosure Journal: Security disClosure: A Journal of Social Theorydisclosurejournal@gmail.com1349958686african-americanamericanchildrens_literaturecultural_studies_and_historical_approachesecocriticism_and_environmental_studiesethnicity_and_national_identityfilm_and_televisiongender_studies_and_sexualitygeneral_announcementshumanities_computing_and_the_internetinterdisciplinaryjournals_and_collections_of_essaysmodernist studiespoetrypopular_culturepostcolonialprofessional_topicsreligionrhetoric_and_compositionscience_and_culturetheatretheorytravel_writingtwentieth_century_and_beyondfull name / name of organization: disClosure: A Journal of Social Theorycontact email: disclosurejournal@gmail.com\n\ndisClosure: A Journal of Social Theory • Issue 22: Security\n\nSUBMISSION DEADLINE: November 16th, 2012\n\nThe editorial collective of disClosure seeks submissions that explore SECURITY as it is understood in a variety of areas and disciplines.

What this seminar presupposes is…maybe he didn't. We will examine the ways in which experience and representation have been historically opposed to each other, leading the latter to be deemed as a merely counterfeit or artificial version of the former. Our goal is to consider the different ways that \"realism\" has come to dictate conceptions of reality, and further, the ways in which media, genres, and theoretical traditions have come to challenge reality as a concept.\n\nThe questions we might consider along the way include: If, as thinkers as diverse as Kant, Baudrillard, and Philip K. Dick have posited, the self is ultimately unknowable, how are we, as humans, to locate or define any single reality in which we exist? This, of course, leads scholars of posthumanism and speculative realism to beg the question: is human reality the only reality? Do avant-garde movements such as surrealism or more popular genres such as science fiction, which offer various \"hyperrealities,\" simply provide counterfeits of reality, or rather, come to augment prescribed definitions of reality? Is it possible to maintain stable boundaries between fiction and nonfiction—in terms of the documentary film or literary journalism, perhaps—or do these boundaries inevitably collapse? What is authenticity? How does the counterfeit aid and/or problematize theorizations of an authentic self, or an authentic reality?\n\nWe invite participants to reflect on these, and similar questions, as they may arise in considerations of literature, cinema, visual art, and theory.\n\nPROPOSALS may be sent via the ACLA's website here: http://acla.org/submit/index.php\n\nNote: The ACLA works in a seminar format, meaning that this seminar will run over three days, so as to facilitate more conversation between participants.\n\nSEMINAR KEYWORDS: realism, surrealism, reality, hyperreality, media, counterfeit, authenticity, artificiality\n\ncfp categories: americaneighteenth_centuryfilm_and_televisioninterdisciplinaryinternational_conferencesmedievalmodernist studiespoetrypopular_culturetheorytwentieth_century_and_beyondvictorian 48276@Harvard U. - Cultural Materials / Material Culture: Abstracts due Nov. 23rd 2012CHIASMI Graduate Student Conference in the Italian Studies, a Harvard and Brown Collaborationchiasmi@fas.harvard.edu1349971547childrens_literatureclassical_studiescultural_studies_and_historical_approachesecocriticism_and_environmental_studiesethnicity_and_national_identityfilm_and_televisiongender_studies_and_sexualitygeneral_announcementsgraduate_conferenceshumanities_computing_and_the_internetinterdisciplinarymedievalmodernist studiespoetrypopular_culturepostcolonialrenaissancerhetoric_and_compositionromantictheatretheorytravel_writingtwentieth_century_and_beyondfull name / name of organization: CHIASMI Graduate Student Conference in the Italian Studies, a Harvard and Brown Collaborationcontact email: chiasmi@fas.harvard.edu\n\nPreface!\n\nFOR A QUICK SYNTHESIS OF OUR CONFERENCE VISION, see our CfP poster at http://chiasmiconference.com/?page_id=25\n\nAnnouncement!\n\nWith this edition of Chiasmi we aim to de-provincialize the Italian Grad Student conference by taking it out of Italian departments (metaphorically, but not only).\n\nWe do not want to talk of interdisciplinarity in the abstract: we prefer to activate our tactile sensors & deal / communicate with fellow grads from diverse research environments;\n\nWe ask participants to engage in different presentational modes that go beyond the reading of a paper ex cathedra (a short documentary, prezi presentation, word cloud, show & tell, audience participation, sound clips, music, etc.);\n\nwe are gluttons for multi-medial, interactive, thought-provoking formats.\n\nCall for Papers!\n\nOn behalf of the graduate students of the Italian Section of the Department of Romance Languages and Literatures at Harvard University and the Department of Italian Studies at Brown University, We are pleased to announce the sixth joint Graduate Student Conference for Italian Studies, to be held on Friday March 8th and Saturday March 9th, 2012 at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts.\n\nThe conference is aimed at exploring the role of materiality in Italian culture. We welcome submissions from any related fields of research (literary studies, Anthropology, Art History, Comparative Literature, Fine Arts, Gender Studies, History, Philosophy, Religious Studies, Theater and Performance Studies, etc.), in order to establish\n\nan interdisciplinary dialogue among the panelists. Our approach to the material culture/cultural materials Chiasmi will particularly highlight three major subsets for investigation: the presence of objects and their semiotic role within cultural systems of signs; the role of materiality in the production of cultural items and its influence on\n\ntheir creation; the commodification and objectification of culture. With our focus on materiality, we also want to elicit papers that make use of diversified presentational resources (digital, multimedial, visual, etc.), in order to create a more culturally relevant, interactive, and thought-provoking space for sharing and learning.\n\nTopics may include (but are not limited to):\n\nObjects in literature and the arts\n\nCorpus, corporeal, ethereal\n\nManuscripts, print and the new media\n\nCultural property\n\nParaliterature and letteratura di consumo\n\nUrban environments and architecture\n\nPhotography and film\n\nDigital vs. analogical\n\nCommodification of literature\n\nConsumerism\n\nPedagogy: teaching with things\n\nFashion\n\nThe body as object\n\nPresentations should not exceed 20 minutes (approximately 8-10 pages, double-spaced). Papers and presentations may be in Italian or English. We strongly recommend that participants use the language in which they feel more confident and make an explicit reference to the pertinence of their paper to the topic of the conference.\n\nPlease send an anonymous abstract (no longer than 300 words) and a cover sheet with the title of your paper, your name, affiliation, contact information, one sentence presentation proposal (documentary, film clips, prezi presentation, word cloud, artifacts to pass, music) and technical equipment needed as a Word file attachment to chiasmi@fas.harvard.edu.\n\nAbstracts must be received no later than November 23rd, 2012.\n\ncfp categories: childrens_literatureclassical_studiescultural_studies_and_historical_approachesecocriticism_and_environmental_studiesethnicity_and_national_identityfilm_and_televisiongender_studies_and_sexualitygeneral_announcementsgraduate_conferenceshumanities_computing_and_the_internetinterdisciplinarymedievalmodernist studiespoetrypopular_culturepostcolonialrenaissancerhetoric_and_compositionromantictheatretheorytravel_writingtwentieth_century_and_beyond 48277The Crime Comics of Frank Miller (12/10/12; PCA/ACA 3/27/13-3/30/13)Terrence Wandtke / Popular Culture Associationtwandtke@judsonu.edu1349974039americanmodernist studiespopular_culturetwentieth_century_and_beyondfull name / name of organization: Terrence Wandtke / Popular Culture Associationcontact email: twandtke@judsonu.edu\n\nPanel Title: \"The Crime Comics of Frank Miller\"\n\nDeadline for submissions: December 10, 2012\n\nOften cited as a creator responsible for bringing a gritty aesthetic to superhero comics, Frank Miller is also a creator responsible for bringing crime comics back to the forefront of the comics industry.

Since the 1980s, technological developments and changes in the economics of film distribution have eroded classical models of film spectatorship, and in recent decades this trend has only picked up speed. Contemporary viewers encounter cinema across a variegated landscape; they are exposed to moving images in taxis, on portable devices, in art galleries, and as part of large-scale public artworks.\n\nOur moving image culture has broken significantly with the 'classical' mode that most scholars agree dominated motion picture production between the 1920s and 1970s. Yet at the same time, alternative and experimental filmmaking and exhibition practices have kept 'non-classical' spectatorship in constant play. Throughout the 20th century, a diverse array of filmmakers, artists, and exhibition venues have experimented with 'expanded' notions of cinema: Lazlo Moholy-Nagy's imagined three-dimensional cinema, Ken Jacobs's projector-based performances, and Andy Warhol's informal screenings in the Factory are just a few examples. Arguably, exhibition space is a formal feature of these works. Analyzing such experimental practices often requires we attend not only to film texts, but also to the audiences and exhibition environments that structured the cinematic event.\n\nBecause artists and filmmakers often propose unique and carefully-considered relationships between moving images and their spatial environments, studying such practices can help us better theorize the spatial dimensions of cinema. Experimental exhibition practices could even help us historicize the many possible spaces and publics that coalesce around moving images today. Moreover, a consideration of 'space' as an aesthetic feature of cinema (in terms of on-screen space, production space, and exhibition space) could help us devise means of close-reading that augment the textual and linguistic models that long dominated film analysis.\n\nThis conference doesn't restrict itself solely to experimental cinema; we invite any project that aims to engage theoretically with the spatial dimensions of cinema as it expands beyond its traditional theatrical environment and classical forms. We hope that such discussions can help conference participants entertain an expanded, flexible account of film spectatorship – the psychic interplay between film text, exhibition situation, and viewer.\n\nTopics for presentations include, but are not limited to:\n\n- Experimental film and alternative exhibition venues\n\n- Expanded cinema (light shows, projector-based performance, etc.)\n\n- Cinema in the museum and art gallery\n\n- The moving image in public space, from public art to advertising and surveillance\n\n- The materiality of film exhibition (projector, celluloid, screen)\n\n- Cinema's life on television and the internet\n\n- Relationships between early cinema, the avant-garde, and \"post-cinema\"\n\n- Spatial elements of film form and filmmaking practice\n\n- Critical practice as an extension of cinema (video blogs, video essays, etc.)\n\n- Technological change and the emergence of new forms and genres\n\nWe seek papers that engage theoretically or historically with cinema's expanded forms, both in the past and today.\n\nPlease send an abstract of 200-300 words to conference co-chairs Mal Ahern, Luca Peretti, and Andrey Tolstoy at expandingcinema@gmail.com by December 10, 2012. Acceptances will be sent out by December 20, 2012.\n\ncfp categories: film_and_televisiontwentieth_century_and_beyond 48283Vocal Positioning: Mapping the Fictional Voice - ACLA, Toronto - April 4-7, 2013Elizabeth Alsop, Western Kentucky University and Leah Anderst, Queensborough Community Collegeelizabeth.alsop@wku.edu, landerst@qcc.cuny.edu1349986007americanmodernist studiestheorytwentieth_century_and_beyondfull name / name of organization: Elizabeth Alsop, Western Kentucky University and Leah Anderst, Queensborough Community Collegecontact email: elizabeth.alsop@wku.edu, landerst@qcc.cuny.edu\n\nCall for Papers - Vocal Positioning: Mapping the Fictional Voice\n\nAmerican Comparative Literature Association\n\nApril 4-7, 2013\n\nUniversity of Toronto, Canada\n\nPaper Proposal Deadline: Saturday, November 1, 2013 - 10am EST\n\nThis seminar aims to explore the diverse ways voices have been \"positioned\" both in fictional discourse, and in critical discourses about fiction. Beginning with Genette, narrative theorists have been centrally concerned with \"locating\" a point of origin for utterances in literary texts: of answering the question, \"who is speaking?\" But considerably less attention has been paid to those texts in which voices are not assigned a clear point of origin. If what Barthes calls the \"classic\" text has – as Mary Ann Doane suggests of the Classical Hollywood film – historically attempted to \"spatialize the voice, to localize it,\" what about those texts that obfuscate the voice's location?\n\nWe invite papers that consider this phenomenon of vocal dislocation, and its potential consequences for literary theory. We especially welcome papers that either propose alternative means of \"mapping\" voice, or that challenge the theoretical usefulness of such spatial metaphors altogether.\n\nPossible topics include:\n\n-Plural or Choral Voices\n\n-Visible Voices in Graphic Narrative\n\n-Narratorless or \"Denarrated\" Narratives\n\n-Multi-narrator novels\n\n-Voice and Translation\n\n-Vocal Positioning and Genre\n\n-Fictional Voices in Nonfiction\n\n-Posthuman or Non-Human Voices\n\n-Critical/Theoretical Voices\n\n-Dialect and speaking voices\n\n-Reader's experiences of voices\n\nSeminar Co-Organizers\n\nElizabeth Alsop, Western Kentucky University - Elizabeth.alsop@wku.edu\n\nLeah Anderst, Queensborough Community College, CUNY - landerst@qcc.cuny.edu\n\nConference Information\n\nThe ACLA's annual conferences have a distinctive structure in which most papers are grouped into twelve-person seminars that meet two hours per day for the three days of the conference to foster extended discussion. Some eight-person (or smaller) seminars meet just the first two days of the conference. This structure allows each participant to be a full member of one seminar, and to sample other seminars during the remaining time blocks. Previous conference programs that show this pattern are available at the ACLA website. The conference also includes plenary sessions, workshops and roundtable discussions, a business meeting, a banquet, and other events. Members may only submit one paper proposal per year. It is not necessary to be a member of ACLA in order to submit a seminar or paper proposal. However, all presenters and seminar leaders who participate at the 2013 Annual Meeting in Toronto must be registered for the conference and current members of the ACLA for 2013 in order to participate.\n\nConference Website: http://www.acla.org/acla2013/\n\nPaper Proposal Website: http://acla.org/submit/index.php\n\nTo propose to this seminar, be sure to choose \"Vocal Positioning\" from the drop down menu following the 250 word paper proposal blank.\n\nWe look forward to reading your proposals.\n\ncfp categories: americanmodernist studiestheorytwentieth_century_and_beyond 48284Rhetoric and Technical Communication at 2013 SWTX PCA/ACASouthwest Texas Popular Culture/American Culture Associationsean.zdenek@ttu.edu1349986275film_and_televisioninterdisciplinarypopular_culturerhetoric_and_compositionfull name / name of organization: Southwest Texas Popular Culture/American Culture Associationcontact email: sean.zdenek@ttu.edu\n\nCall for Papers: Rhetoric and Technical Communication\n\n34th Annual Conference February 13‐16, 2013\n\nSouthwest/Texas Popular and American Culture Association\n\nhttp://swtxpca.org/\n\nSubmission Deadline: 11/16/12\n\nConference Hotel:\n\nHyatt Regency Albuquerque\n\n330 Tijeras\n\nAlbuquerque, NM 87102\n\n505.842.1234\n\nIndividual papers and panels are now being accepted on topics related to Technical\n\nCommunication and Rhetoric in Popular Culture for the 34th annual Southwest/Texas Popular\n\nand American Culture Association to be held in Albuquerque, NM.\n\nPapers and panels that connect to the conference theme of \"Celebrating Popular/American\n\nCulture(s) in a Global Context\" are particularly welcome.

And while setting has long been a central and defining convention of Gothic literature, until very recently scholars have largely ignored the Gothic mode's engagement with (or reflection of) environmental concerns. Such an oversight is interesting, given the pervasive contemporary cultural interest in environmental dread, collapse, and catastrophe, and the Gothic's emphasis on fear, excess, transgression, trauma, and violence. This panel seeks to address these connections, and welcomes paper proposals about any topic exploring intersections between ecocriticism and the literary Gothic.\n\nPlease send a 300-400 word abstract, contact information, and a brief C.V.

Cummings Rendóncontact email: mexicanhorrorfilms@gmail.com\n\nProposals are sought for an edited collection on Mexican Horror Films, a collection that explores the historic and/or cultural relevancy of theatrically released Mexican horror films. This collection is slated to be published by a well-established American press with a long history of publishing on horror and fantasy films. The editor seeks essays on each of the following films that explore why they are important and enduring. The term \"Mexican horror film\" applies to those cinematic works that were produced/directed in Mexico or whose major creative force is of Mexican origin. The \"horror\" element of each film can be gore, the supernatural, monsters, suspense, etc. We encourage examination of the film itself (the plot, questions of fidelity between the script and the finished product, topics related to film grammar) and other topics or themes within Mexican Horror Film Studies surrounding representation, audiences, political and social references, identity, violence aesthetics, genre, patriarchal institutions, religious allegories, gender, queer, feminism, post-colonialism, temporality, fetishism, \"the Other\" or \"Máscara metaphor\", and the film's central \"terror\" (monster, horror element, etc) as an allegory for Mexico, its post-revolutionary growing-pains, or its labyrinthine identity paradox-dichotomy.

The common denominator between this and other projects and scholars/academicians who collaborate with me, is their strong passion for horror film.\n\ncfp categories: cultural_studies_and_historical_approachesfilm_and_televisiongender_studies_and_sexualitygeneral_announcementsinterdisciplinaryjournals_and_collections_of_essaystheory 48287ACLA 2013: Postcolonial Mediterranean Subjectivity, April 4-7 Maria Hadjipolycarpouhadjipol@umich.edu1350005155cultural_studies_and_historical_approachesethnicity_and_national_identitygender_studies_and_sexualitygraduate_conferencesinterdisciplinarypostcolonialtwentieth_century_and_beyondfull name / name of organization: Maria Hadjipolycarpoucontact email: hadjipol@umich.edu\n\nDear colleagues,\n\nI am writing to solicit applications for the 2013 conference of the\n\nAmerican Comparative Literature Association (ACLA), which will take place\n\nApril 4-7 in Toronto. This is a great opportunity for those interested in 19th and 20th century Mediterranean Literature and Culture and in postcolonial studies in general to propose a paper for a series of panels with the general title: \"Postcolonial Mediterranean Subjectivity\" (see the description below.)\n\nComparative perspectives within the Mediterranean or of the Mediterranean with other regions, are particularly encouraged.\n\nIf you are interested in submitting a proposal or have questions about the conference, please contact me directly (hadjipol@umich.edu)\n\nYours,\n\nMaria Hadjipolycarpou\n\nPostcolonial Mediterranean Subjectivity\n\nThe Mediterranean remains an unexplored region in postcolonial studies for two reasons: 1) the geopolitical emphasis on Africa, India and Southeast Asia in postcolonial studies; 2) the emphasis, in Mediterranean Studies, on the Mediterranean as a space of co-existence and connectivity. The Mediterranean however, is also a region heavily colonized both by European empires and by Mediterranean regimes like the Ottoman, the Byzantine, the\n\nVenetian, and others; something that historian David Abulafia calls \"the cataclysm of conquest\" (2003).\n\nThis seminar explores questions of postcolonial subjectivity and identity in the Mediterranean in the 19th and 20th century. It explores the ways in which the subject incorporates imperial and colonial pasts and the ways in which it (re)claims its individuality in forms of artistic expression such as literature, film, performance, installation art.\n\nResearch questions:\n\n- What conditions shape Mediterranean postcolonial subjectivity?\n\n- Could the study of postcolonial Mediterranean subjectivity\n\nrefine the existing methodology in postcolonial studies?\n\n- What new literary and artistic examples the Mediterranean puts\n\non the postcolonial literary map?\n\n- In which new ways we can think about the relationship between \"self\" and \"other;\" colonizer and colonized.\n\n- What is the role of history in postcolonial mediterranean subjectivity?\n\nPossible Topics:\n\nthe self and its relationship to history; autobiography; biography; the body; layers of the historical past; ruins; archaeology; the palimpsest; (imaginary) mapping; geography; women and homosexuals as alternative voices\n\nwithin the nation; stories, storytelling and their embodiment; fascism; resistance through art; hellenism vs hebraism as the two major intellectual trends of the mediterranean; the coexistence of Islam, Christianity and Judaism; the Balkans; the Andriatic; the Black Sea; the Iberian Peninsula; transition from Empire to democracy; corruption; identity and representation in and across the sea; self and other; political/economic relations between the North and the South;\n\nKey words: postcolonialism; empire; nationalism; history; postcolonial subjectivity; the body; storytelling; resistance; temporality.\n\ncfp categories: cultural_studies_and_historical_approachesethnicity_and_national_identitygender_studies_and_sexualitygraduate_conferencesinterdisciplinarypostcolonialtwentieth_century_and_beyond 48288Perceptions of Self in Society as viewed through Literature and the ArtsSt. John's University Humanities Review (Vol. Eleven, Issue 1/ Spring 2013)meghan.punschke12@stjohns.edu1350014795african-americanamericancultural_studies_and_historical_approachesethnicity_and_national_identityfilm_and_tele"
