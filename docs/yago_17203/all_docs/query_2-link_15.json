        "text": "The first major medical sci/fi movie in Mexico, loosely based on the Frankenstein story but injecting gory surgical motifs into it, laying the foundations of the genres that came to dominate Hispanic Science Fictionin the 60's and 70's, as exempified by the work of Jesus Franco from 'Gritos en la Noche' (1962) onwards. Set in the Balkans, this story concerns a bored journalist, Nora (miroslava) who is ordered by her boss (Wagner) to follow up a mysterious advertisement placed by Dr Ling (Linares Rivas). Ling turns out to be a misshapen creature who, rejected by his peers, has become the stereotypical mad scientist, here specializing in plastic surgery. He falls in love with Nora but fearing she will betray him he resuscitates a young man who committed suicide, Ariel (Navarro) by transplanting a new brain into him, and order him to fetch Nora so that he can kill her. However, Nora and Ariel fall in love, and the zombiesque youth rebels against the orders of his master, turning on him and kill him, whereupon Wagner saves Nora from the beautiful young zombie.\n\nIn modern day Mexico, a man on the street is supernaturally killed after hearing the eerie sound of a wailing woman. We then arrive at the manor of an upper class family, who are celebrating their young son's birthday. A mysterious cloaked figure is eavesdropping on them, taking advantage of secret rooms and passages. Eventually, the intruder (who appears to be possesessed) kidnaps and attempts to murder the boy at a pagan altar using a sacrificial knife and stone. While this story unfolds, two flashbacks to the Elizabethan and Inquisition era are related, explaining the origins of the \"wailing woman\". In one, a woman with an illegitimate child has been abandoned by her lover. His formerly faithful friend forces him to a duel over this betrayal. The woman kills her baby and herself, and upon her death a wraith ascends skyward from her corpse. In the other story, an Indian woman has her baby taken from her by the authorities, and she descends into madness and suicide, with her spirit also leaving her body upon death. An ancient ring worn by the principals, as well as the knife and stone, are the bonds between the stories.\n\nWhen the Monk Javier acts violently in a gothic monastery, the Prior asks the Monk Juan to calm him down since he believes that Javier is possessed by demons. When Juan comes to Javier's cell, they recognize each other and Javier runs after him. Javier reaches Juan and hits his head with a heavy crucifix, and returns to his cell. Later, Javier confesses to the Prior that Juan was his best friend when he was a tubercular musician and how their friendship ended when his beloved fianc√© Ana died. Then, Juan confesses to the Prior that Javier's confession is correct, but he would like to tell the same story through his eyes.\n\nThis cult-classic was Director Rene Cardona's attempt to capitalize on the popularity of professional wrestling and on of its biggest stars of the 1950's, known as \"El Santo\". However it is not about wrestling. It chronicles the adventures of a crime-fighting duo known as El Enmascadero de la Plata,,( The Silver Mask), and his adolescent sidekick Pecas (Freckles), as they take on a murderous Mad Doctor and an evil gang-leader called El Lobo,(The Wolf). It also features some low-budget but creative, sci-fi type of special effects and was written by the creator of the El Santo comic book series.\n\nCasimiro, night watchman at a wax museum of horrors, is even more sleepy than his usual laziness makes him - because his boss, the Professor, is secretly draining blood from him while he dozes to use in experiments in raising the dead. These haven't worked so far, and the bodies have been waxened and placed on display in the museum to cover his crimes. His big chance seems to come, however, when he learns that the mummified body of a modern man has been found in an Egyptian sarcophagus. The professor and his two henchmen steal the body and take it back to his lab - where the experiment flops again. Or it seems to. While the villains are out of the lab, and Casimiro sleeps on duty, a bolt of lightning gives the electrical boost which the Professor's machinery has needed, and the body comes back to life. Then the clouds part, the full moon shines through, and the resurrected one becomes a were- wolf. When Casimiro sees it wandering the museum, no one will believe him, not even Paquita, his girlfriend. But the professor finds his subject alive and soon witnesses a transformation. Eventually, the creature escapes him and makes off into the night, terrorizing the city and ending up at Paquita's apartment..."
