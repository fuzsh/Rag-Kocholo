        "text": "Roots is an American television miniseries based on Alex Haley's 1976 novel Roots: The Saga of an American Family. The series first aired on ABC in January 1977. Roots received 37 Primetime Emmy Award nominations and won nine. It also won a Golden Globe and a Peabody Award. It received unprecedented Nielsen ratings for the finale, which still holds a record as the third-highest-rated episode for any type of television series, and the second-most watched overall series finale in U.S. television history. It was produced on a budget of $6.6 million.\n\nA sequel, Roots: The Next Generations, first aired in 1979, and a second sequel, Roots: The Gift, a Christmas television film, starring Burton and Louis Gossett Jr., first aired in 1988. A related film, Alex Haley's Queen, is based on the life of Queen Jackson Haley, who was Alex Haley's paternal grandmother.\n\nIn 2016, a remake of the original miniseries, with the same name, was commissioned by the History channel and screened by the channel on Memorial Day.\n\nCast and characters[]\n\nLeVar Burton – young Kunta Kinte\n\nOlivia Cole – Matilda\n\nLouis Gossett Jr. – Fiddler\n\nBen Vereen – Chicken George Moore\n\nVic Morrow – Ames\n\nJohn Amos – older Kunta Kinte\n\nJi-Tu Cumbuka – Wrestler\n\nEd Asner – Capt.
