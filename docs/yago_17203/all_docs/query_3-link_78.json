LeVar Burton played Kunta Kinte in the original series.\n\nRoots is being written by Lawrence Konner (Boardwalk Empire), Mark Rosenthal (Mona Lisa Smile), Alison McDonald (Alpha House) and Charles Murray (Sons of Anarchy).\n\nCasting director is Vickie Thomas (The Hateful Eight, 42, Django Unchained).\n\nThe series is an A+E Studios production in association with Marc Toberoff and The Wolper Organization, the company that produced the original Roots.\n\nExecutive producers are Will Packer, Marc Toberoff, Marc Wolper, Lawrence Konner and Mark Rosenthal. LeVar Burton and Korin Huggins are co-executive producers.\n\nA+E Networks is distributing internationally under the A+E Studios International banner.\n\nKirby is repped by Femi Oguns and Jonathan Hall of Identity Agency Group, which also reps Star Wars: The Force Awakens star John Boyega and Urban Hymn actress Letitia Wright - both former Screen Stars Of Tomorrow."
