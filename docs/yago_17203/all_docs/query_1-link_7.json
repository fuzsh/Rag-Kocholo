It was produced by Cinematográfica Calderón S.A. The screenplay by Alfredo Salazar is an uncredited adaptation of the novel Burn Witch Burn! by A. Merritt.[1]\n\nPlot\n\n[edit]\n\nThe story surrounds four men who are cursed by a voodoo priest for stealing a sacred idol from his temple. Soon after being surrounded, evil 'doll' people begin to kill their family members.\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nElvira Quintana as Karina\n\nRamón Gay as Dr. Armando Valdés\n\nRoberto G.
