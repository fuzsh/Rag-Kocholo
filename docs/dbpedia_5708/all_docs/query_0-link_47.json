        "text": "Alison Myers@ AlisonM_110Correspondent I\n\nNHL 2011-12 Kickoff: The Ultimate Hockey Fan Playlist\n\n0 of 34\n\nThe NHL season is under way, and I'm sure that if you're anything like me, you've already arranged your schedules to ensure that you can watch your favorite team and have made it very clear you are not to be bothered on certain days and times.\n\nBut here's another question about how ready you are: Have you updated your iPod (or music player of choice) with all your favorite hockey songs?\n\nFor me, there's nothing like a good song to get me pumped up for game day. It gets me excited to watch my team to take the ice or to go sit in an arena.\n\nOver the last 10 years, many of the songs I've heard at games or watched videos of have made it into my iPod. Not only do the songs get me excited for a game, they also help me hold me over during the offseason, keeping my favorite sport in the front of my mind 24/7.\n\nWith this in mind, I decided to create the ultimate hockey fan playlist. Now, while we all have varying music tastes, these songs are my must-haves, and I hope you agree.\n\nIf you don't, or you think I missed something, let me know what songs get you in that hockey mood!\n\nBlow Me Away: Breaking Benjamin\n\n1 of 34\n\nBreaking Benjamin got their start in my hometown, so for a while, their songs were staples at our team's hockey games. I fell in love with this one and decided I should download it right away.\n\nThe song starts off quietly and then goes right into a head-bobbing drum and guitar riff. The lyrics talk about survival of the fittest and running right off to a new adventure. They even mention that if you stumble, you should just shake it off and keep going. It speaks perfectly to what your team is trying to do every night on the ice.\n\nBoys of Winter\n\n2 of 34\n\nPens fans will appreciate this song more than most. When we're in Consol Energy Center waiting for our team to come to the ice, Boys of Winter starts off quietly and slowly while the lights are still down. Then the music picks up and the team races on to the ice, causing Pens fans to go wild.\n\nThis is an instrumental piece that really gets you excited to see Sidney Crosby and company score a lot of goals. If you're one of those people that doesn't openly dislike the Penguins, you'll fall in love with this song.\n\nBrass Bonanza\n\n3 of 34\n\nIf you were a Hartford Whalers fan back in the day or you just love hockey history, you'll want this song. This was used to welcome the Whalers on to the ice and is still in use today, as the AHL's Connecticut Whale play it after every goal.\n\nThere are no lyrics, but the beat gets stuck in your head fast, especially when it's played six times in one game. And trust me, I would know.\n\nChelsea Dagger: The Fratellis\n\n4 of 34\n\nThe Chicago Blackhawks goal song became a love it or hate it anthem for hockey fans during the 2010 Stanley Cup Finals, as we heard it quite a bit.\n\nThe only part of the song worth knowing if you want this on your playlist is the chorus. The lyrics in that part are really easy to learn, and you can clap your hands or snap your fingers along. I bet it's really fun after you have a few drinks, too.\n\nCrowd Chant: Joe Satriani\n\n5 of 34\n\nCrowd Chant starts out on a beat with guitar and drum sounds meant to get everyone clapping along. The two lyrics it has also make it a good goal song or just one to help fire up the fans during a stop in play.\n\nCum on Feel the Noize: Quiet Riot\n\n6 of 34\n\nWho doesn't love a little 80s rock mixed in with their hockey?\n\nThis song will get you in a partying mood, and you'll be drawn right to the idea of going to a game and letting loose. This is another good stop in play song that almost everyone knows and will get into when it blares over the speakers.\n\nDon't Stop Believin': Journey\n\n7 of 34\n\nNothing like a classic Journey song that is usually played when your team is trying to pull off a come-from-behind victory.\n\nThe Detroit Red Wings especially love to play this so their fans can yell a certain part when the music stops (guess which one). For other teams, it's a crowd pleaser that everyone gets into, even if it's not played when the team is losing.\n\nIf you don't have this one, what are you waiting for?\n\nEnter Sandman: Metallica\n\n8 of 34\n\nThis is another well-known classic that can be used for a variety of purposes at a hockey game. The guitar introduction draws everyone right in and helps the crowd get loud as the team enters the ice or a fight breaks out.\n\nLike it or not, hockey wouldn't be hockey without some form of hard rock music. Metallica gets the job done here.\n\nGame Day: RBK Productions\n\n9 of 34\n\nEven if you don't like the Canucks, their song still beats the awful original song it was based on. It gets you ready to get down to the arena and cheer your favorite team to the Cup. Replace Canucks with whoever you cheer for if need be.\n\nAnd the debate about who will play on what line is miles better than wondering if you should sit in the front seat or the back seat. Don't you agree?\n\nGet Ready for This: 2 Unlimited\n\n10 of 34\n\nWe've had 80s rock and a parody of an awful pop song from 2011. Why not throw in some 90s pop?\n\nJust admit it. You like this song and it gets you pumped up at a hockey game.\n\nBonus points to anyone who will comment and say they do the spirit fingers dance.\n\nHey Baby (If You'll Be My Girl)\n\n11 of 34\n\nSadly, I've only ever heard this song at one hockey game out of the hundreds I've been to over the years. I've heard it's popular at soccer and high school and college football games, though.\n\nI think we need to hear this great crowd participation song in NHL arenas more often. It's easy to learn, and if you like any of the sports I just mentioned, you can be the one to lead the fans in it.\n\nHit Somebody: Warren Zevon\n\n12 of 34\n\nHit Somebody tells the story of a boy who grew up in rural Canada, as many NHL players do, who wanted to be a goal scorer. But he didn't have that goal-scoring touch, so he was encouraged to become an enforcer. The player comes to embrace his job, but he still dreams of getting that one career goal.\n\nThe story has a happy ending, as Buddy, the player who the song is about, gets his first goal during the final game of his final season.\n\nIn an age where it feels like the sport is discouraging less and less hitting, it's nice to hear this song and remember part of what we love about the game.\n\nHockey Night in Canada Theme (AKA Canadian Gold by Colin Oberst)\n\n13 of 34\n\nHearing this song makes me wish I lived in Canada and could hear it every week.\n\nAlas, I live south of the border and have to settle for the YouTube...and a spot on my playlist.\n\nWhen you hear this song, it can only mean one thing: hockey time on Saturday night. There's nothing better.\n\nI Gotta Feeling: Black Eyed Peas\n\n14 of 34\n\nThis is a great song to get the party going before your team takes the ice for warmups. You can play it before you leave your house or try to ask if it can be played in the rink. It may be a bit cliche to use it at this point, but it just never seems to lose its luster.\n\nBack in 2010, students at Plum High School in Pittsburgh, Penn. used the classic to make a lipdub in preparation for the Pens' playoff run. The video has over 300,000 views to date.\n\nI Wanna Drive the Zamboni (Zamboni Song): Gear Daddies\n\n15 of 34\n\nNormally, hockey and country music just don't mix.\n\nBut the Gear Daddies' song about one of the most well known symbols of the hockey culture just works. Who doesn't want to at least get on the Zamboni and go for a ride around the rink?\n\nI Wanna Rock and Roll All Night: Kiss\n\n16 of 34\n\nThe chorus of this song is great for crowd participation. There's so much that can be done: fist pumping, clapping, singing along...it's an instant classic.\n\nBonus points if you paint your face before rocking out, whether you look like a member of Kiss or an ardent supporter of your favorite team.\n\nKernkraft 400: Zombie Nation\n\n17 of 34\n\nWhile this song has also become cliche in recent years, we just can't get away from it, whether it's used as a goal song or during a stop in play.\n\nPlus, it gets the crowd going. It's cool to imagine thousands of fans waving rally towels as this song plays in celebration in the background.\n\nLet's Get It Started: The Black Eyed Peas\n\n18 of 34\n\nThe Black Eyed Peas make their second apperance on this list with another song that will get everyone going.\n\nOnce you hear this at warmups or before the team comes out for the start of the game, you'll be ready to take in hockey in style.\n\nLiving on a Prayer: Bon Jovi\n\n19 of 34\n\nThe ultimate song to play, besides Don't Stop Believin' (see earlier slide), when your team is looking to squeak out a win. No one wants to give up until the final horn, so this song reminds us that it can be done.\n\nPlus, everyone's probably sang along with this one at a party or a karaoke night, making it an easy go-to song for the arena.\n\nNew York Rangers Goal Horn\n\n20 of 34\n\nRangers fans probably already love their goal horn, but if you haven't heard it, you really should.\n\nUnlike other teams, which try to make their celebrations \"different\" with the same song half of hockey already uses, the Rangers actually made up their own unique song. It cheers the goal and gets the crowd chanting \"LET'S GO RANGERS!\"\n\nEven though I'm a Pens fan, I have to give the Rangers credit for their creativity.\n\nNot Afraid: Eminem\n\n21 of 34\n\nThe song was well used in a montage video for the 2010 Stanley Cup Finals that pitted the Chicago Blackhawks against the Philadelphia Flyers. The lyrics follow the theme of making sacrifices and rising above adversity to reach a common goal.\n\nIt was one of the most well-done NHL promotions of the playoffs, if not the best one.\n\nOle: Bouncing Souls\n\n22 of 34\n\nThe Montreal Canadiens fans enjoy singing this classic soccer chant when they are about to win a game. It's a great crowd participation song and can get everyone loud right away, rather than just using manufactured noise on the Jumbotron. Plus, it's fast paced and has both rock and club versions, so there is an \"Ole\" for everybody.\n\nRenegade: Styx\n\n23 of 34\n\nAt my team's games, the arena music crew would play this song as our mascot took the ice for a pre-game skate. The fans cheered him on as he took a lap around the ice with a flag bearing our team's logo.\n\nThis meant the introduction video wasn't too far off and our starting lineup would soon be announced.\n\nIt's best used prior to the game, but anytime during the three periods you can hear this Styx classic is a good time for it.\n\nRock and Roll Part 2: Gary Glitter\n\n24 of 34\n\nCould you imagine sporting events without this song, let alone hockey, where it's one of the most used goal celebration songs in almost any league?\n\nNeither can I.\n\nSong 2: Blur\n\n25 of 34\n\nSong 2 has become another common goal song over the years. Although it's not as widely preferred or used as Rock and Roll Part 2, it's still hard to get out of your head.\n\nIt's also used at a stoppage in play to keep everyone rocking through the horn signaling the end of the game.\n\nStart Me Up: Rolling Stones\n\n26 of 34\n\nThis Rolling Stones classic, used prior to puck drop, sets the tone for a good game. The team is sending a message that once they get going, it will not be easy to slow them down, and they will wreak havoc on their opponents for 60 minutes.\n\nMost people probably have at least one Stones song that they love. This is my favorite.\n\nThe Best Is Yet to Come: The Scorpions\n\n27 of 34\n\nThis is a good video montage song. Two seasons ago, my team used it during their (albeit brief) playoff run to get fans excited for the real hockey season.\n\nHowever, it can be used at any point to show that while individual games are great, no champion is crowed after just one game.\n\nThe Game: Motorhead\n\n28 of 34\n\nI've never watched wrestling, but I've discovered through my years as a hockey fan that some of my favorite hockey songs were also used in the WWE. The Game by Motorhead is one of them.\n\nThe Good Old Hockey Game (The Hockey Song): Stompin' Tom Connors\n\n29 of 34\n\nIt tells the story of a night out at a game, from an intro declaring \"It's hockey night tonight,\" to telling how the game is still tied going into the third period of the last game of the playoffs. Of course, the home team (we don't actually know who they are) scores the game-winning goal to send the fans into a frenzy. Overall, the song celebrates what we love about hockey and why.\n\nIt is the ultimate hockey song. But, we're still not done.\n\nThe Place'll Be Rockin' Cause It's Saturday Night: Carpet Frogs\n\n30 of 34\n\nI apologize in advance for using the far inferior version of this song with less than stellar female vocals. So if you find the original by the Carpet Frogs hidden on YouTube somewhere, just let me know.\n\nThe Carpet Frogs originally performed this song for Hockey Night in Canada back in the mid 1990s. It's an instant classic because it talks about how the hockey game is the only place to be on a Saturday night. It doesn't matter if you live in the U.S. or Canada; everyone wants to be at the arena checking out the action from the hottest stars in the NHL.\n\nThe version used on TV includes announcer calls from various games, even ending with an intro from the final game at Toronto's Maple Leaf Gardens.\n\nUnder Pressure: Queen and David Bowie\n\n31 of 34\n\nThe duet between one of the greatest rock bands and one of the most eccentric singers in history became an instant classic in 1982.\n\nIt makes a great song to play at a game during a situation when a team is trying to come back into the game, or when someone is going on the penalty kill. Every game counts, and everyone is feeling the heat to win big or go home.\n\nWe Will Rock You: Queen\n\n32 of 34\n\nAny in-arena DJ needing an easy pump up the crowd song is going to reach for this classic. It will get everyone stomping their feet, clapping their hands and singing along as soon as the opening chords come over the speakers.\n\nWhat I love most about this video is the guitarist wearing a Blackhawks jacket. It makes you think this song was just destined for NHL arenas.\n\nWe're Not Gonna Take It: Twisted Sister\n\n33 of 34\n\nIf your team is on a losing skid or you feel like the refs are letting every call go your rival's way, break out this 80s classic. I guarantee at least one person will agree with your feelings, pump their fists and shout the main rally cry.\n\nWelcome to the Jungle: Guns N' Roses\n\n34 of 34\n\nLet's face it, every team thinks their fans are the best and that their arena is the loudest out of every other in whatever league they play in.\n\nThis song reminds everyone at the game of that fact.\n\nX"
