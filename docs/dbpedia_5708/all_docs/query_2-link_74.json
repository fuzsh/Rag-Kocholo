For the first time, young people could listen to and see their favorite artists on a range of new mass media: the radio, television, and even massive outdoor concerts. This seismic period in music history gave birth to iconic musicians and bands whose influence continues to shape the music styles of the modern era.",

        "text": "In the early 1950s, there was a sudden boom in new musical artists who were experimenting with up-beat music that was popular with young people.\n\nInitially there was no name for this style of music, but then the Radio DJ Alan Freed coined the term 'rock 'n' roll' for it, which has then stuck.\n\nThe first song to make a significant impact was performed by Bill Haley and the Comets, called Rock Around the Clock, which was released in 1954.\n\nIt became a massive hit and is often credited with bringing rock 'n' roll into mainstream culture.\n\nHowever, most commonly, rock 'n' roll's inception is now often linked to another event in 1954 when Elvis Presley, later dubbed the 'King of Rock and Roll', recorded his first single, That's All Right, at Sun Records in Memphis.\n\nPresley's unique amalgamation of country, gospel, and rhythm and blues, known as 'rockabilly', became an important defining characteristic of early rock 'n' roll.\n\nMeanwhile, other artists like Chuck Berry and Little Richard, with their energetic performances and rhythmic, blues-influenced songwriting, brought a new level of excitement to popular music.\n\nIn particular, Chuck Berry's Maybellene (1955) and Little Richard's Tutti Frutti (1955) are often listed as some of the most influential rock 'n' roll recordings.\n\nTo help spread the popularity of these new song and artists, the television show American Bandstand, which was hosted by Dick Clark began in 1957.\n\nTV shows like this played a crucial role in popularizing rock 'n' roll music and dance across the United States.\n\nAt the very end of the 1950s, as rock'n'roll was gaining in popularity, three of its most popular artists met a tragic end.\n\nIn a sudden plane crash in 1959, known as 'The Day the Music Died', Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens, and The Big Bopper were killed.\n\nIt was Buddy Holly's innovative approach to songwriting and recording, that had made him incredibly respected in the industry.\n\nIn particular, his use of double-tracked vocals would influence future legends like the Beatles, who were becoming a sensational new band in the UK at the time.\n\nAs more artists began performing and experimenting with this new musical genre, a number of key cities became known as hubs for rock'n'roll.\n\nMemphis, Tennessee, often recognized as the birthplace of rock 'n' roll, played a pivotal role in the genre's formation.\n\nIn particular, the company known as Sun Records, which was led by Sam Phillips, launched the careers of numerous rock 'n' roll artists, including Jerry Lee Lewis and Johnny Cash.\n\nHowever, rock 'n' roll was not confined to Memphis. By the early 1960s, Detroit had become a hotbed of a new, soul-infused type of rock thanks to Berry Gordy's Motown Records.\n\nProducer Phil Spector, known for his 'Wall of Sound' recording technique, revolutionized rock 'n' roll production in the early 1960s.\n\nHis willingness to experiment with new technologies created a rich and layered sound that would influence countless artists over the next two decades.\n\nFor example, the Beach Boys, who became known for their distinct harmonies and surf rock sound, brought a unique Californian twist to rock 'n' roll, achieving massive success with hits like Surfin' USA in 1963.\n\nWhile all of the major developments and artists in rock'n'roll in the 1950s came from America, the period from 1964 to 1966 saw rock 'n' roll sweeping across continents during the 'British Invasion', when bands like the Beatles and the Rolling Stones dominated the U.S. charts.\n\nTheir innovative styles, coupled with the Beatles' sophisticated lyricism and daring production techniques, ushered in a new era of artistic growth and experimentation in rock music.\n\nIt was the Beatles' iconic televised performance on The Ed Sullivan Show in February 1964, viewed by an estimated 73 million Americans, which was a major turning point in the British Invasion and cemented their status as global superstars.\n\nThen, other British bands like The Rolling Stones, The Kinks, and The Who continued the success of the British Invasion.\n\nBy the late 1960s, people had become used to rock'n'roll, and it was no longer as exciting as it had been ten years earlier.\n\nAs a result, newer artists began experimenting with strange new ways of manipulating the rock'n'roll sound.\n\nOne of the new styles that became popular was known as 'psychedelic rock': a sub-genre characterized by extended solos, exotic instrumentation.\n\nA number of influential bands like The Doors and the Jimi Hendrix Experience championed this movement.\n\nLarge, outdoor musical festivals became a key feature of this movement. For example, the Monterey Pop Festival in 1967, featured groundbreaking performances by Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, and The Who, which all helped showcase its vibrant musical experimentation.\n\nThis shift in musical tastes was part of a broader counterculture movement in American, that had begun to reject mainstream values and norms, advocating for peace, love, and freedom.\n\nOther famous bands like Pink Floyd, Jefferson Airplane, and the Grateful Dead were also key figures in the psychedelic rock movement.\n\nThe most famous event from this time was the Woodstock Music Festival in 1969.\n\nIt drew a live audience of over half million people who came to watch the artists perform and to celebrate of peace, music, and communal living.\n\nUnfortunately, when The Rolling Stones held their own live event at the Altamont Free Concert in December 1969, violence broke out among their audience and one of their fans died.\n\nThis tragedy is often seen as the end of the 1960s' idealistic counterculture era."
