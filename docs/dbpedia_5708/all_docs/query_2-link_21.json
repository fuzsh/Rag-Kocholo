        "text": "Music for Everyone\n\nDating as far back as the mid-1950s, people all over the world have been rocking and rolling. There’s no question why rock and roll is one of the most popular and influential styles of music in history. Combining elements from several genres including rhythm and blues, jazz, boogie-woogie, as well as gospel and country, rock and roll boasts an undeniable groove and soulful energy that is hard for anyone to ignore. Rock and roll has left its mark on language, lifestyles, fashion, attitudes, and many other facets of life. Beyond being fun to listen to, there are many rock and roll benefits that are highly rewarding, no matter who you are. Rock & roll music has a way of uniting cultures and bringing people together!\n\nIt’s Great Exercise Music\n\nRock and roll is an excellent soundtrack to your workout! The solid, upbeat tempos and strong backbeat found in rock music provide the perfect backdrop for any physical routine. With its pounding rhythms and energizing guitar riffs, rock and roll will get you moving! The genre boosts a powerful forward momentum that calls the body to action and keeps the listener motivated while they focus and power through strenuous activity or a tough workout. Also, the lyrics found in rock and roll music are often inspiring, uplifting, motivational, or filled with angst; telling a story of perseverance and triumph. In the original Rocky movie, the fictional boxer, Rocky Balboa, ended his morning run with an epic ascent up the steps of the Philadelphia Museum of Art to the tune of “Eye of the Tiger” from the rock band, Survivor. The end result is one of the most inspiring moments in film history, set to a rock tune that has become an anthem for aspiring and professional athletes all over the globe. Rock music can help anyone charge ahead while achieving their goals!\n\nSchool of Rock AllStars perform \"Eye Of The Tiger\" by Survivor\n\nRock and Roll Benefits that Help Eliminate Stress\n\nA large amount of research has been conducted regarding the effects of music on both the psychological and physiological well-being of all types of people, from all walks of life. Rock music has long been found to possess therapeutic properties and can undoubtedly have a soothing effect on our bodies and minds. Medical studies have shown that rock music can help reduce stress, increase positive emotions, and even regulate mood. Rock music can act as an effective tool in stress management by increasing the production rate of dopamine, effectively reducing levels of stress hormones. Rock music has also been shown to increase the production of serotonin which can help fight depression, anxiety, panic, and anger. People sometimes refer to dopamine and serotonin as the “happy hormones” due to the roles they play in regulating mood and emotion. Getting lost in rock and roll is a great way to cast out negative attitudes and gloomy forecasts!\n\nRock and Roll is Music that Touches the Soul\n\nWhen you really listen and “feel the music,” rock and roll often strikes a chord within that resonates with our heart, mind, and spirit. Nothing touches the soul quite like rock and roll music, because it expresses at times what we cannot express ourselves. Music can also provide a major distraction, which helps us forget our trials and tribulations for a moment, and take us to another place. Perhaps it reminds you of a pleasant memory or gives you hope and courage to press on against your daily struggles. It not only carries an infectious groove but rock and roll conveys profound emotion and meaning. Words and lyrics are combined with the instruments and melodies to create something special, something one of a kind. Rock music is beautiful and emotional and has the potential to “speak to you” if you’re willing to listen!\n\nRock and Roll Benefits that help Boost Brain Activity\n\nWhen we’re rocking to a great song, our limbic system, which supports long-term memory, emotion, and behavior, is rocking with us. The “happy hormones” we get from listening to our favorite music can impart on our brain's motivation, registering as rewarding. Neuroscientists have found that listening to all types of music, including rock music, is effective in improving cognitive and motor skills, spatial-temporal learning, and neurogenesis, which is the brain’s ability to produce neurons. Some neuroscientists have even reported that people with neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s respond positively to music. Rock and roll is good for brain health!\n\nMusic is Good for your Heart\n\nListening to and playing music have both demonstrated benefits for cardiovascular health in a growing area of research. Listening to music, rock and roll in particular, often has a cathartic effect on the listener. Past studies have found that not only can music help to reduce pain and anxiety, but in many cases, it can help improve blood circulation and may also help with lowering heart rate and blood pressure. Music may even improve the health of patients living with various heart-related illnesses. Music therapy has been used throughout history to promote positive emotional and mental health, but it may also drastically improve the quality of life for people with physical health problems, such as heart failure. Music can also help with relaxation which helps patients undergoing cardiac rehabilitation. Whether rock music is getting you moving or helping you move toward a more relaxed and peaceful state, it’s evident that music is good for your heart!\n\nSchool of Rock 2022 Students perform \"Come on Eileen\" by Dexys Midnight Runners\n\nAttending Live Music Concerts Improves the Mood\n\nResearch exists that says people who go to more live concerts are happier and healthier than people who don't. Live music is medicine for the mind, body, and soul. Attending a live music performance can decrease the release of stress hormones and increase endorphins, neurotransmitters that block pain. Joining the crowd and being a part of the audience has a communal effect that makes you feel a connection with other people. This can certainly have a positive effect on your mental outlook and longevity. With all the walking, running, jumping, and dancing you’ll potentially be doing, you’ll get plenty of exercise in the process. Even your diaphragm may get a good workout when you cheer or sing along! Not to mention, the positive memories you’ll gain from special experiences can last a lifetime. Going to a rock show can provide waves of excitement and a rush of energy, it’s a feeling that will surely lift your spirits!"
