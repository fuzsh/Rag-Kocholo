        "text": "1997/98 'Rock'n'Roll Carnival' Tour Setlists\n\nThe previous few years had seen pretty basic shows with a minimum of theatrics. The 'Rock'n'Roll Carnival' changed that with it's fairground theme, clowns and all. The set list also saw a few old favourites resurface after many years.\n\nThe normal set list went as follows:\n\nCircus Intro Tape - Hello Hurray\n\nSideshow\n\nBillion Dollar Babies\n\nNo More Mr Nice Guy\n\nBe My Lover\n\nLost In America\n\nI'm Eighteen\n\nFrom The Inside\n\nOnly Women Bleed\n\nHalo Of Flies\n\nNothing's Free\n\nCleansed By Fire\n\nPoison\n\nPublic Animal #9\n\nCold Ethyl\n\nUnfinished Sweet\n\nSchool's Out\n\nUnder My Wheels\n\nNotes:\n\n'Cleansed By Fire' was played at the first show in San Diego on July 30th and in Minneapolis on August 3rd. It becamse a standard part of the set from August 12th.\n\nFor the first two shows 'Poison' was performed between 'School's Out' and 'Under My Wheels' but afterwards it move to before 'Public Animal #9'.\n\n'Public Animal #9' moved around a bit. It started out before 'Cold Ethyl', moved to after 'No More Mr Nice Guy', then switched places with 'Be My Lover', before switching back. All this moving around made the band mess up in San Francisco when the drums started 'Be My over' but the guitars started 'PA #9'. In the end 'Be My Lover' won, and the other song was skipped for the night.\n\n'From The Inside' also moved around slightly a couple of times but was always played.\n\nWhen the tour arrived in Australia on September 5th 1997 'Department Of Youth' was added between 'School's Out' and 'Under My Wheels'. It was dropped again after the five Australian shows though.\n\nAt the end of the year Alice again played three New Year shows. The first two had the normal setl list, but the third added 'Desperado', 'Clones' and a cover of 'Jailhouse Rock' at midnight on New Years Eve in Detroit.\n\nAs 1998 arrived Alice returned to Europe with a slightly changed set list:\n\nCircus Intro Tape - Hello Hurray\n\nSideshow\n\nBillion Dollar Babies\n\nNo More Mr Nice Guy\n\nPublic Animal #9\n\nBe My Lover\n\nLost In America\n\nI'm Eighteen\n\nFrom The Inside\n\nOnly Women Bleed\n\nSteven\n\nHalo Of Flies\n\nNothing's Free\n\nCleansed By Fire\n\nPoison\n\nCold Ethyl\n\nUnfinished Sweet\n\nSchool's Out\n\nJailhouse Rock\n\nUnder My Wheels\n\nNotes:\n\n'Steven' and 'Halo Of Flies' in the same set!!\n\n'Jailhouse Rock' became a standard part of the encore.\n\nAt the Sweden Rock Festival on June 6th 'Public Animal #9' was replaced by 'He's Back'.\n\nWhen the tour went back to the USA in June 1998 they kept the same set list.\n\nOn December 18th 1998 Alice Cooper'stown in Phoenix opens with a low key show featuring Michael Bruce and Neal Smith. Together they playedtwo short sets. The first included 'Be My Lover', 'Under My Wheels', 'I Saw Her Standing There', 'I'm Eighteen', and 'School's Out'. The second featured 'No More Mr Nice Guy', 'Muscle Of Love', 'Is It My Body', 'Desperado, and 'Billion Dollar Babies'.\n\nThere were three end of year shows which featred the standard set list.\n\nFull Show Listing\n\nJuly 30th 1997 El Cajon, San Diego, CA Sycuan Casino\n\nSetlist: Circus Intro / Hello Hurray / Sideshow / Billion Dollar Babies / No More Mr Nice Guy / Be My Lover / Lost In America / I'm Eighteen / From The Inside / Only Women Bleed / Halo Of Flies / Nothing's Free / Cleansed By Fire / Public Animal #9 / Cold Ethyl / Unfinished Sweet / School's Out / Poison / Under My Wheels\n\nNotes: warm up show (w/ Warrent, Loverboy)\n\nAug 1st 1997 Pershing Field, Fort Carson, CO (Marlboro Music Festival (w/ Joe Walsh, Eddie Money)\n\nSet list for this show only was a shorter set\n\nAug 2nd 1997 Chicago, IL (Tinley Park); New World Music Theatre\n\nSetlist: Circus Intro / Hello Hurray / Sideshow / Billion Dollar Babies / No More Mr Nice Guy / Be My Lover / Lost In America / I'm Eighteen / From The Inside / Only Women Bleed / Halo Of Flies / Nothing's Free / Public Animal #9 / Cold Ethyl / Unfinished Sweet / School's Out / Poison /Under My Wheels\n\nNotes: (w/ Slaughter, Warrent and Dokken)\n\nAug 3rd 1997 Minneapolis, MN (St. Paul); Roy Wilkins Auditorium\n\nSetlist: Circus Intro / Hello Hurray / Sideshow / Billion Dollar Babies / No More Mr Nice Guy / Be My Lover / Lost In America / I'm Eighteen / From The Inside / Only Women Bleed / Halo Of Flies / Nothing's Free / Cleansed By Fire / Poison / Public Animal #9 / Cold Ethyl / Unfinished Sweet / School's Out / Under My Wheels\n\nNotes: Glen Buxton in attendence (w/ Slaughter, Warrant and Dokken)\n\nAug 5th 1997 Detroit, MI (Clarkston); Pine Knob Music Theatre\n\nSetlist: Circus Intro / Hello Hurray / Sideshow / Billion Dollar Babies / No More Mr Nice Guy / Be My Lover / Lost In America / I'm Eighteen / From The Inside / Only Women Bleed / Halo Of Flies / Nothing's Free / Poison / Public Animal #9 / Cold Ethyl / Unfinished Sweet / School's Out\n\nNotes: Assumed Setlist (w/ Slaughter, Warrant and Dokken)\n\nAug 6th 1997 Cincinnati, OH; Riverbend Music Center\n\nSetlist: Circus Intro / Hello Hurray / Sideshow / Billion Dollar Babies / No More Mr Nice Guy / Be My Lover / Lost In America / I'm Eighteen / From The Inside / Only Women Bleed / Halo Of Flies / Nothing's Free / Poison / Public Animal #9 / Cold Ethyl / Unfinished Sweet / School's Out\n\nNotes: Assumed Setlist (w/ Slaughter, Warrant and Dokken)\n\nAug 8th 1997 Milwaukee, WI; Eagles Ballroom\n\nSetlist: Circus Intro / Hello Hurray / Sideshow / Billion Dollar Babies / No More Mr Nice Guy / Be My Lover / Lost In America / I'm Eighteen / From The Inside / Only Women Bleed / Halo Of Flies / Nothing's Free / Poison / Public Animal #9 / Cold Ethyl / Unfinished Sweet / School's Out\n\nNotes: Assumed Setlist (w/ Slaughter, Warrant and Dokken)\n\nAug 9th 1997 Oakland City, IN; Oakwood Theatre\n\nSetlist: Circus Intro / Hello Hurray / Sideshow / Billion Dollar Babies / No More Mr Nice Guy / Be My Lover / Lost In America / I'm Eighteen / From The Inside / Only Women Bleed / Halo Of Flies / Nothing's Free / Poison / Public Animal #9 / Cold Ethyl / Unfinished Sweet / School's Out\n\nNotes: Assumed Setlist (w/ Slaughter, Warrant and Dokken)\n\nAug 10th 1997 Columbus, OH Buckeye Lake Music Center\n\nSetlist: Circus Intro / Hello Hurray / Sideshow / Billion Dollar Babies / No More Mr Nice Guy / Be My Lover / Lost In America / I'm Eighteen / From The Inside / Only Women Bleed / Halo Of Flies / Nothing's Free / Poison / Public Animal #9 / Cold Ethyl / Unfinished Sweet / School's Out\n\nNotes: Torrential rain and crowd problems, apparently last show ever at the venue (w/ Slaughter, Warrant and Dokken)\n\nAug 12th 1997 Washington DC (Columbia, MD); Merriweather Post\n\nSetlist: Circus Intro / Hello Hurray / Sideshow / Billion Dollar Babies / No More Mr Nice Guy / Be My Lover / Lost In America / I'm Eighteen / From The Inside / Only Women Bleed / Halo Of Flies / Nothing's Free / Cleansed By Fire / Poison / Public Animal #9 / Cold Ethyl / Unfinished Sweet / School's Out / Under My Wheels\n\nNotes: (w/ Slaughter, Warrant and Dokken)\n\nAug 13th 1997 Wantagh, NY (Long Island); Jones Beach Amph.\n\nSetlist: Circus Intro / Hello Hurray / Sideshow / Billion Dollar Babies / No More Mr Nice Guy / Public Animal #9 / Be My Lover / Lost In America / I'm Eighteen / From The Inside / Only Women Bleed / Halo Of Flies / Nothing's Free / Cleansed By Fire / Poison / Cold Ethyl / Unfinished Sweet / School's Out / Under My Wheels\n\nNotes: Joe Greenburg in attendance (w/ Slaughter, Warrant and Dokken)\n\nAug 14th 1997 Holmdel, NJ; P.N.C.
