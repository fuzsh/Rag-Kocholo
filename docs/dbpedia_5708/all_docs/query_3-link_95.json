        "text": "Overview\n\nEmerging as a powerful force on the American music scene in the 1950’s, rock music has evolved with the decades and now includes many variations that sound different from the likes of Chuck Berry and Elvis Presley. Join Active Minds as we return to the roots of Rock ‘n’ Roll and trace its history and cultural impact through the years, and discuss its uncertain future.\n\nKey Lecture Points\n\nRock and roll began as a new style of dance music aimed at teenagers in the 1950s, and by the end of the 1960s it had transformed the American cultural and political landscape. A blend of African-American and white musical traditions, rock and roll challenged existing social norms, including the segregation of the races. Rock and roll also became the soundtrack of a youthful generation defying the expectations of their parents.\n\nThe roots of rock and roll go back to rhythm and blues and country music. Because rhythm and blues musicians were African-American and the music was considered suggestive, it was not generally accepted by white audiences.\n\nThe history of rock and roll includes (but is certainly not limited to) the stories of Elvis Presley, the Beatles and the Rolling Stones. Elvis made the new music popular with white America, notwithstanding its origins in the African American musical traditions. And just when it appeared that the new craze was about to die out in 1959, the “British Invasion” of bands inspired by the American rock of the 1950s injected a new energy into Rock and ensured the music would endure.\n\nThe heyday of rock and roll is generally defined as the 1950s and 1960s, but the genre’s legacy can be seen across the landscape of American popular music through the 20th century and into the present day. The emergence of numerous subgenres, including prog rock, punk rock, grunge, and even rap, carried the influence of rock and roll beyond its initial confines.\n\nIn contemporary American culture, rock has largely receded from the preeminent position it once held. Today, most music charts are topped by hip-hop, R and B, and “pop” artists.\n\nExploration Questions\n\nWhat makes rock and roll different from other music genres?\n\nWhat are the origins of rock and roll?\n\nHow did rock and roll change American culture?\n\nReflective Questions\n\nWho do you think is the greatest rock and roll artist of all time? Why?\n\nDo you think rock is dead? Will it make a comeback if so?\n\nHow do you define “rock and roll”?\n\nMore to Explore\n\nRock and Roll Hall of Fame Click here\n\nStory of Woodstock Click here\n\nElvis Presley official website Click here\n\nBooks For Further Reading\n\nMiller, Steve.
