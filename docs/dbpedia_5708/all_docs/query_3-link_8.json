Thank you!\n\nRock can mean many different things to different folks.\n\nAccording to RockMusic.mu\n\nMost popular genres are Rock & Roll and Classic Rock\n\nRock Music Genre\n\nRock is a popular genre of music that originated with rock and roll in the 1940s and 1950s, but it encompasses a wide range of musical styles today. Rock and roll started drawing inspiration from blues, folk, and country music in the middle of the twentieth century, for example. What began as rock and roll in the 1940s and 1950s came from boogie-woogie, jazz, jump blues, gospel, country music, and rhythm and blues.\n\nIt’s also sometimes written as rock & roll or rock ‘n’ roll.\n\nIn early rock and roll, the piano or the saxophone was the lead instrument, but by the late 1950s, they had been replaced by the guitar. Rock and roll is identified by a dance rhythm, with a snare drum providing the accentuated backbeat.\n\nRock and roll had a contribution to society far beyond the music. It influenced attitudes, fashion, lifestyles, and language. It even contributed to the civil rights movement as both white American and African American teenagers shared an enjoyment of the music.\n\nSince the 1960s, it has spawned several other genres including the rock music of today. These genres are no longer identified with the same accentuated backbeat but have a similar set of instruments including guitars, bass, and drums.\n\nOrigins of Rock Music\n\nRock and roll origins are a point of contention with historians. The general agreement is that it began in the southern regions of the United States, where most popular rock and roll performers began. It was produced by a meeting of influences, like traditional African music and European instrumentation.\n\nThink you know rock music???\n\nI highly recommend this book for some great trivia / facts! (click to buy)\n\nAfrican Roots\n\nMany descendants of former slaves moved to major urban areas during this time and brought the music with them. Large numbers of black people were living closer together than at any other time in history, and they began to imitate fashion and hear each other’s music.\n\nA cultural collision burgeoned as whites began to take up black music, like jazz and swing. While rock and roll’s immediate roots are in rhythm and blues and country, influences were widespread.\n\nJazz and swing from the 1930s were some of the first music forms that presented African American styles to white audiences. In the 1940s, the sounds of blaring horns, boogie-woogie beats, and shouted lyrics burgeoned.\n\nEconomic and Technological Influences\n\nSoon, the effects of World War II made large jazz bands less economical because of shortages in fuel, personnel, and audiences. Bands were downsized to include a guitar, bass, and drums, or a similar combination.\n\nSimultaneously, in the Midwest and on the west coast, the jump blues emerged, featuring guitar riffs, shouted lyrics, and prominent beats. The marriage of these ideas created the foundation for rock and roll.\n\nAs it would happen, rock and roll showed up during a time of great technological change with the electric guitar with its amplifier, microphones, and the 45 records. Changes in the recording industry were happening with independent labels emerging.\n\nRock and roll was getting airtime on radio stations, regardless of the artist’s ethnicity, and when affluent white teenagers began listening, it defined a distinct genre of its own.\n\nMusical hybrids of Rock (1950-1960)\n\nRockabilly appeared in the mid-1950s and was popularized by white performing artists such as Elvis Presley, Johnny Cash, Jerry Lee Lewis, and Carl Perkins. They drew their roots more from country music, but their styles were influenced by many rock and roll musicians as well.\n\nDoo-wop is also compared to rock and roll but places more emphasis on vocal harmonies. It is characterized mostly by its meaningless background lyrics and light instrumentation.\n\nRock and roll took a brief hiatus in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Instead, the genre saw more British rock influences and a faded into soft R&B. Rock reemerged in the late 1960s, but it had already changed.\n\nDivergence of Rock (1960 – 1980)\n\nIn the late 1960s, rock and roll began to move away from the idea that it was comparable to popular music. The term pop began to identify a genre that was commercial, accessible and aimed at the teenage crowd.\n\nRock music instead focused on extended works, like albums, and was associated more with subculture and counterculture. It valued artistic emphasis and authenticity. It stressed live performances and vocal or instrumental virtuosity.\n\nThere were also a few garage rock bands beginning to develop with lyrics about lying girls and aggressive delivery. In the 1970s, rock returned in part to its roots with what was coined roots rock. They moved away from the psychedelic scene, returning to the basics of rock and roll with the original influences like folk and country.\n\nCountry rock and Southern rock developed out of this movement and with it a natural division between soft rock, hard rock, and other sub-genres. The punk rock era also began in the 1970s. This gave way to other types of alternative rock and grunge, which came about in the 1980s and was characterized by a dirty sound, rebellion, and unkempt appearance.\n\nRock used elements of heavy metal and punk but relied on fuzz, distortion, and feedback, too.\n\nIndie Rock (1990s)\n\nThe 1990s were an age of mainstream indie rock, which seems like an oxymoron. Being alternative, or indie, was popular, and many artists moved to private or independent labels to maintain control of their careers.\n\nToday, there are still many subgenres of rock music. It’s nearly impossible to say the term rock without having to classify what you mean. It’s also rare that a person likes just one type of rock music because they all share the same roots and have similar qualities.\n\nList of Famous Rock Artists\n\n“Weird Al” Yankovic\n\n2Pac\n\n3 Doors Down\n\n3OH!3\n\nADELE\n\nAerosmith\n\nAl Green\n\nAlan Jackson\n\nAlanis Morissette\n\nAlice In Chains\n\nAll Time Low\n\nAretha Franklin\n\nAvenged Sevenfold\n\nAvril Lavigne\n\nB.o.B\n\nBeastie Boys\n\nBeck\n\nBee Gees\n\nBeyoncé\n\nBig & Rich\n\nBilly Currington\n\nBilly Joel\n\nBlake Shelton\n\nBlink-182\n\nBob Dylan\n\nBob Marley\n\nBon Jovi\n\nBoston\n\nBoys Like Girls\n\nBrad Paisley\n\nBreaking Benjamin\n\nBrooks & Dunn\n\nBruce Springsteen\n\nBryan Adams\n\nBuckcherry\n\nCee Lo Green\n\nCéline Dion\n\nChicago\n\nChris Brown\n\nChris Tomlin\n\nChristina Aguilera\n\nCobra Starship\n\nColdplay\n\nCounting Crows\n\nCreed\n\nCreedence Clearwater Revival\n\nDaft Punk\n\nDarius Rucker\n\nDaughtry\n\nDave Matthews Band\n\nDavid Bowie\n\nDavid Cook\n\nDavid Guetta\n\nDeath Cab for Cutie\n\nDepeche Mode\n\nDestiny’s Child\n\nDierks Bentley\n\nDisturbed\n\nDixie Chicks\n\nEagles\n\nEarth, Wind & Fire\n\nEli Young Band\n\nElton John\n\nElvis Presley\n\nEnrique Iglesias\n\nEric Clapton\n\nEtta James\n\nEvanescence\n\nFaith Hill\n\nFall Out Boy\n\nFat Joe\n\nFinger Eleven\n\nFive Finger Death Punch\n\nFive for Fighting\n\nFleetwood Mac\n\nFoo Fighters\n\nForeigner\n\nFrank Sinatra\n\nGavin DeGraw\n\nGnarls Barkley\n\nGodsmack\n\nGood Charlotte\n\nGorillaz\n\nGrateful Dead\n\nGreen Day\n\nGuns N’ Roses\n\nGwen Stefani\n\nGym Class Heroes\n\nHank Williams, Jr.\n\nHeart\n\nHinder\n\nHollywood Undead\n\nIncubus\n\nIngrid Michaelson\n\nJack Johnson\n\nJackson 5\n\nJames Blunt\n\nJames Taylor\n\nJanet Jackson\n\nJason Mraz\n\nJay Sean\n\nJay-Z\n\nJimmy Buffett\n\nJimmy Eat World\n\nJohn Denver\n\nJohn Legend\n\nJohn Mayer\n\nJohn Mellencamp\n\nJohnny Cash\n\nJonas Brothers\n\nJosh Groban\n\nJosh Turner\n\nJourney\n\nJustin Moore\n\nJustin Timberlake\n\nKaty Perry\n\nKeane\n\nKeith Urban\n\nKelly Clarkson\n\nKenny Chesney\n\nKevin Rudolf\n\nKings of Leon\n\nKISS\n\nKorn\n\nLed Zeppelin\n\nLifehouse\n\nLinkin Park\n\nLupe Fiasco\n\nLynyrd Skynyrd\n\nMadonna\n\nMariah Carey\n\nMarilyn Manson\n\nMaroon 5\n\nMartina McBride\n\nMarvin Gaye\n\nMary J.
