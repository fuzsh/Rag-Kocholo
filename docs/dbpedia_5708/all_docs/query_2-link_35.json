        "text": "Rock 'n' roll is a style of popular music that emerged from America in the 1950s. It has its roots in various African-American styles of music, such as blues, jazz and gospel, and in country music. It was played by both African American and white musicians.\n\nThere were many technological developments during this era. Audiences could listen to rock 'n' roll music on the radio and increasingly watch them on television. Mass production of 45 rpm vinyl records, or singles, meant that music could be bought cheaply and easily.\n\nTeenage culture started to develop in the 1950s. Rock 'n' roll was the first style of music to appeal to the new young audience. It was often disapproved of by the older generation, and so represented a sense of youthful rebellion.\n\nTeenagers could identify with rock 'n' roll songs. Lyrics were about subjects such as young love, school, parents and cars. Rock 'n' roll songs allowed young people an opportunity to express their emotions and experiences.\n\nListen to 'Rock Around the Clock' by Bill Haley and His Comets. This was one of the first major rock 'n' roll hits, reaching number one in the UK and US charts in 1954. As in many other rock 'n' roll songs, a saxophone joins the guitars and drums as a prominent instrument â listen for the riffs played throughout the song."
