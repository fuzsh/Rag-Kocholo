        "text": "Burton Cummings brought the house down at Caesars Windsor on January 20th, 2023 for a one-off performance that has been his only announced performance so far this year. The legendary Canadian musician and former Guess Who frontman delivered a powerhouse performance for the packed crowd, delivering hit after hit from both his solo career and his time with the legendary Canadian band.\n\nOpening with the classic “Runnin’ Back to Saskatoon,” Cummings set the tone for an unforgettable night of rock and roll. His voice may have been a bit weathered at times, but it only added to the raw emotion the 75-year-old superstar brought to classics like “American Woman,” “Share The Land,” “These Eyes,” “Albert Flasher,” and “Clap For The Wolfman”, as well as some cover songs such as Louie Louie (a favourite he’s been playing live for years) and Smoke Gets In Your Eyes from The Platters.\n\nCummings and his backup band, The Carpet Frogs from Toronto, were in top form, with each member showcasing their incredible musicianship when given the opportunity. The chemistry between Cummings and his bandmates was undeniable, making for a seamless and cohesive performance.\n\nFans of all ages were shakin’ all over (a song he didn’t perform this time by the way), singing along and dancing to the music. It was clear that Burton Cummings still has what it takes to put on an unforgettable concert, even after all these years. Live music by a consummate professional and his killer band.\n\nIf you missed out on this one-off performance, you missed out on a truly special night.\n\nBurton Cummings\n\nCaesars Windsor\n\nWindsor, ON\n\nJanuary 20, 2023\n\nAll photos by Dan Savoie\n\nSetlist:\n\nRunnin’ Back to Saskatoon\n\nClap for the Wolfman\n\nHand Me Down World\n\nLaughing\n\nBlue Is the Night\n\nSour Suite\n\nMy Own Way to Rock\n\nBaby, Come Back\n\nYour Back Yard\n\nBreak It to Them Gently\n\nTrouble in the City\n\nAlbert Flasher\n\nSmoke Gets in Your Eyes\n\nThese Eyes\n\nAmerican Woman\n\nNo Time\n\nEncores:"
