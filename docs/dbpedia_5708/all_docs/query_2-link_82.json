        "text": "Rock music is a genre of popular music. It developed during and after the 1960s in the United Kingdom and the United States. It originally started in the 1940s and 1950s with the start of rock and roll. Rock and roll grew out of rhythm and blues and country music. Rock music is related to a number of other genres such as blues and folk. It has influences from jazz, classical and other music genres.\n\nMusically, rock mostly uses the electric guitar as part of a rock group with bass guitar and drums. Rock music is song-based. It has a 4/4 beat and it has verse-chorus form. However, rock has become very different and it is hard to say what its common musical instruments are. Like popular music, rock music lyrics are mostly about \"romantic love\". They can also have social or have political themes, however. Rock focuses on musical skill, live performance, and it tries to be more real than pop music.\n\nBy the late 1960s, a number of different rock music below-genres had come out. These included hybrids like blues rock, folk rock, country rock, and jazz-rock fusion. In the second half of the 1970s, punk rock both intensified and reacted against some of these trends to produce a raw, energetic form of music characterized by overt political and social critiques. Punk caused other below-genres to come about into the 1980s, including New Wave, post-punk and eventually the alternative rock movement. From the 1990s, alternative rock began to be the most popular type of rock music. It broke through into the mainstream in the form of grunge, Britpop, and indie rock. More merging of below-genres have since emerged. These include pop punk, rap rock, and rap metal, as well as conscious attempts to revisit rock's history, including the garage rock/post-punk and synthpop revivals at the beginning of the new millennium.\n\nRock music has also helped cultural and social movements. This led to large sub-cultures including mods and rockers in the UK and the \"hippie\" culture that spread out from San Francisco in the US in the 1960s. Similarly, 1970s punk culture made the goth and emo subcultures. Rock music has the same folk tradition as the protest song. Rock music has been involved with political activism.\n\nImages for kids\n\nRed Hot Chili Peppers in 2006, showing a quartet lineup for a rock band (from left to right: bassist, lead vocalist, drummer, and guitarist)\n\nA simple 4\n\n4 drum pattern common in rock music\n\nChuck Berry in a 1958 publicity photo\n\nThe Everly Brothers in 2006\n\nJames Brown performing in 1969\n\nThe Beach Boys performing in 1964\n\nThe Beatles arriving in New York at the start of the British Invasion, January 1964\n\nThe D-Men (later the Fifth Estate) in 1964\n\nEric Clapton performing in Barcelona in 1974\n\nJoan Baez and Bob Dylan in 1963\n\nThe Jimi Hendrix Experience in 1968\n\nProg rock band Yes performing in concert in Indianapolis in 1977\n\nJaco Pastorius of Weather Report in 1980\n\nThe Eagles during their 2008â€“2009 Long Road out of Eden Tour\n\nDavid Bowie during the Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders Tour in 1972\n\nCarlos Santana, New Year's Eve 1976 at the Cow Palace in San Francisco\n\nLed Zeppelin live at Chicago Stadium in January 1975\n\nBruce Springsteen in East Berlin in 1988\n\nPatti Smith, performing in 1976\n\nDeborah Harry from the band Blondie, performing at Maple Leaf Gardens in Toronto in 1977\n\nU2 performing on the Joshua Tree Tour 2017\n\nR.E.M. was a successful alternative rock band in the 1980s/90s\n\nNirvana performing in 1992\n\nOasis performing in 2005\n\nFoo Fighters performing an acoustic show in 2007\n\nGreen Day performing in 2013\n\nLo-fi indie rock band Pavement\n\nLinkin Park performing at 2009 Sonisphere Festival in Pori, Finland\n\nTravis in 2007\n\nThe Strokes performing in 2006\n\nSuzi Quatro is a singer, bassist and bandleader.
