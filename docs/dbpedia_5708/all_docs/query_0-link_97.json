Just FYI, BuzzFeed and its publishing partners may collect a share of sales and/or other compensation from the links on this page.\n\n31 Things From Amazon Our Readers Are Loving Right Now\n\nIncluding a camera lens coffee mug, pastel unbreakable plates, and other popular products from BuzzFeed Shopping posts.\n\n1. A pack of Nespresso capsules with three different flavors so you don't have to decide on a favorite. You can try a new one each day and love all your little coffee cappies equally.\n\n2. A skin spatula to help you clean out the debris that's trapped in your skin. This ultrasonic facial skin scrubber is meticulously crafted for deep cleansing, pore extraction, skin lifting, and serum infusion. Your pores will never look better!\n\nPromising review: \"Great results! I washed my face, kept my face damp/moist, and used the cleaning setting. I was able to get into my pores, especially around my nose creases, along with between my forehead and chin! I love this product! Can’t wait to see how much better my pores will get with continuous usage. Plus, the cost is a steal!\" —coco\n\nGet it from Amazon for $15.99+ (available in three colors).\n\n3. An acai and dragon fruit boob polish, a vegan and cruelty-free potion that works to smooth the skin and nips while helping reduce the appearance of stretch marks and fine lines.\n\nAmazon, Ulta\n\nPromising review: \"I actually got this to help tighten my stomach from the stretch marks and skin wrinkles I got from pregnancy. It really works great!! Since getting it, I use it every time I shower, and I use the Buns of Glory serum each day, and I’ve noticed a substantial change in my skin. Much fewer wrinkles, and honestly, my stomach looks almost back to normal, and it’s only been a few weeks! Super glad I bought this!\" —Kimberly Stumbaugh\n\nGet it from Amazon for $31.09.\n\n4. A bright foam cleanser from The Face Shop that really foams up with just a dime-size amount of product. It's formulated with rice water to cleanse the skin and brighten its appearance.\n\n5. A set of resistance bands perfect for workouts in smaller spaces. Resistance bands help focus your control and are a good alternative to workout machines.\n\n6. An electric candle lighter with an LED indicator that lets you know how much juice is left in its charge. It's also flexible for lighting candles that have burned down to the near end and is windproof!\n\n7. A camera lens coffee mug for a new spin on picture-perfect coffee. Try not to ~shutter~ at its cuteness each time you take a sip.\n\n8. A Callaway Golf 300 Pro Laser range finder that's a golfer's dream here to help them know the distance their ball needs to travel to hit that hole-in-one.\n\n9. A luggage set just begging to accompany you on your next excursion. Reviewers note how light and roomy the luggage is — a perfect set for a week-long trip.\n\n10. A pack of Touchland hand sanitizer mist because keeping our hands as germ-free as possible is on everyone's priority list. And it helps that this little pocket sanitizer comes in such fun colors. Reviewers love how the mist doesn't give them that grimy *there's something sticky on my hand* feeling.\n\n11. A 12-pack of Sharpie markers for writing \"GARAGE SALE\" on a piece of cardboard, labeling storage bins, or just doodling for fun. Having a pack of Sharpie markers should be added to the category of must-have everyday household items.\n\n12. A pack of interactive chirping cat toys that mimic animal sounds so your cat can channel their inner hunter and wrestle the toy around as if it were an opponent. The sounds are touch-activated, which makes it even more lifelike. And if that isn't enough to make your cat go absolutely wild, you can add catnip to it, too.\n\nPromising review: \"We'll be purchasing again! Our cats love these! Both cats will chase after them, and one will even retrieve the ball and bring it back to you to throw again. He hasn't done that in a long time. They love the sounds they make when you throw them! Great idea and a great toy! Thanks!!! : )\" —Randy Garner\n\nGet it from Amazon for $9.98+ (available in two styles).\n\n13. A double-layered litter mat to trap litter so it doesn't scatter all over your floor. Afterward, press the sides to open the mat and dump the trapped litter back into the litter box or into the trash. Easy peasy.\n\n14. A label maker ready to keep organization at your fingertips. Whether you're at work or reorganizing the pantry at home, this wireless label maker will go where you go and stay ready for your use. It's inkless, so no worries about running out of ink.\n\nSince you're about to become obsessed with making cute labels, here's a refill if you need some more.\n\nPromising reviews: \"I love how easy it is to use! You can customize your labels how you please on their app, or you can use their lite mode, and with those you can do simple labels. I really like how easy and quick it is. I think I'm going to label EVERYTHING in my house! LOL.\" —Stephanie Lopez\n\n\"This is a must-have. Very simple to get started. The app that is required is very user friendly. No bells and whistles to distract you. It allows you to save label templates, which is good for labels you will need often. It comes with a starter roll of pre-cut label tape (12mm x 40mm). I recommend purchasing a roll of continuous label tape, as well.\" —Mandi\n\nGet it from Amazon for $18.98+ (available in five colors).\n\n15. A pack of Nick's Protein Bars so tasty you'll feel like you're eating candy for breakfast when actually you're eating something nutritious while getting 15 grams of protein in your system.\n\nPromising review: \"These are akin to Mars bars and actually are much better than the current 'real' candy bars I've tasted in the USA. There are whole, crunchy almonds, caramel, and creamy chocolate. Sometimes they arrive a bit squished and are messy to eat, but they're still scrumptious and by FAR the best keto/low carb protein/candy bars I've had!\" —Samantha S.\n\nGet a 12-pack from Amazon for $18.85.\n\n16. A big ol' family-sized bag of Nerds Clusters because the second they hear the bag crinkle, they'll come running around the corner for a share of your delicious candy bounty.\n\n17.

An LCD writing tablet your little artist can use for endless creativity without having to carry their entire lunchbox of crayons and colored pencils with them. And unlike a traditional tablet, the battery on this one lasts 3–6 months!! Did this just become the parent's new favorite item? I think so.\n\nPromising review: \"This tablet has entertained my 4-year-old grandson for hours at a time. He loves that he can erase at will and that the drawings are multicolored. I highly recommend this item for 18 months old and up. I bought a pink one for our 18-month-old granddaughter, and she, too, is just as enthralled with it and the 'power' she has to erase, create, erase, create! They loved them so much, that we bought another set of two different colors so that they would have them at home as well as at 'Grammy's.'\" —Kindle Customer Red Heart\n\nGet it from Amazon for $19.99 (available in four colors).\n\n21.

From cutting poultry to removing gristle from the bottom of a tri-tip roast and any number of other kitchen items. I'm left-handed, and the grip is comfortable. They're very easy to clean, and the plastic sheath that comes with them is a plus, preventing me from gouging myself when looking for other items in the 'sharp object' drawer. I'm thinking about getting a second pair. I highly recommend these kitchen shears!\" —Suzy-Q666\n\nGet it from Amazon for $8.99+ (available in seven colors).\n\n24.

It'll also work on muffins, buns, croissants and rolls. If you can never get the slice right with a knife, then this will be a welcome addition to your kitchen.\n\nPromising review: \"My boyfriend can’t cut bagels. He literally butchers these poor baby bagels all up. I saw this on TikTok, and I was like oh, we need that. So I bought it. And it was a good investment. Now, we can enjoy nicely sliced bagels that fit in a toaster and aren’t jagged across. Yay, bagel slicer!\" —C DiPalma\n\nGet it from Amazon for $19.90+ (available in four colors).\n\n25.

Pucker up, boo boo. 💋\n\nYou'll get one lip plumper and one minty sleeping mask for your lips.\n\nPromising review: \"I discovered this product from TikTok, and I had to give it a try. I tried the day lip plumper, and within a few seconds, there was a subtle tingling/burning that lasted for a few minutes, but as it occurred, the plumping started to happen! It made a noticeable difference and made my lips look like I had filler! I'm obsessed!!\" —Amazon Customer\n\nGet it from Amazon for $9.98.\n\n27. A pack of Bissell Stomp 'N Go pads so easy to use, you'll wish you'd bought them sooner. All you have to do is set the pad down, stomp on it, then toss it. It works on both fresh and set-in stains.\n\nPromising review: \"It is actually working! I almost cried when I picked up the first pad!! Some genius builders put white carpets in our condo bedrooms. It's now 15-years-old, so it's definitely not the original white. We knew we were going to get a dog, so we didn’t want to replace it right away, though. Well, we rescued a dog who was barely potty trained and she did a number on the carpet. Luckily, the smell didn’t linger, but the stain did. We’ve tried numerous products and none of them helped the stain. The stains are now over a year old. We're waiting to replace the carpet but I still wanted it to look nice in the meantime. I was skeptical for sure, but holy goodness, it’s working!! You can literally see the rectangle where I used (and moved) the first pad!!!! I have a long way to go, but these pads are nothing short of a miracle! I just wish they were bigger because laying them out looks and feels like we’re laying tiles on the floor. Just buy it. You won’t regret it.\" —Kimmy\n\nGet a pack of 20 from Amazon for $27.48.\n\n28. A bottle of Batiste Dry Shampoo mousse on the lazy days when your to-do list is filled with only the absolute must-do items = get rid of your oily roots. Quick and easy — now back to loafing on the couch.\n\nAmber\n\nPromising review: \"This dry shampoo is amazing! I have tried so many brands over the years and was so dissatisfied with all of them that I thought dry shampoo just wasn't for me. To give context, I have a very oily scalp with long, fine blond hair. Batiste saves the day! I don't like washing my hair every day and this product helps me last two to three days from my last shampoo. It gives good volume and doesn't feel loaded with product. Also, it does leave some white residue, but a blow-dryer on cool gets almost all of this out. I highly recommend this dry shampoo to anyone with an oily scalp! It's amazing for the price and for how frequently I need to use it. And for anyone worried about buildup, I have never had an issue with this dry shampoo, and I use it about four times a week.\" —Laurel A\n\nGet it from Amazon for $7.45.\n\nIt was also selected as our low-price point pick for the best dry shampoos.\n\n29. A set of reusable soda can covers if you can never finish a full soda in one sitting and hate when it ~fizzes out.~ These covers create an airtight seal so your soda will still be poppin' when you come back to it.\n\nPromising review: \"I was pleasantly surprised with this purchase! I originally purchased it because I am afraid of bees getting into my soda can while I’m outside. I didn’t know that it would also keep my soda airtight and leakproof — such an awesome bonus! I love that it came in a six-pack. I keep one in my purse for on the go!\" —Carley Lesinski\n\nGet a six-pack from Amazon for $11.99.\n\n30. A set of family-friendly pastel \"unbreakable\" deep plates if you wanna add personality to your dinnerware, even though most of the time you're eating your Totino's Pizza Rolls right off the pan. They're lightweight, making them easier for kids to use, but are still dishwasher-safe and microwave-safe for up to three minutes.\n\nPromising review: \"These are microwaveable and light to carry. I love the colors. I wish they were available in one color only, but I can’t complain. I primarily bought these for microwave purposes but they can be used for salads, hot soup, etc. Also, it’s an in-between size, like a medium. Just right for me.\" —M. Zolnosky\n\nGet a set of four from Amazon for $9.55 (also available as bowls!).\n\n31. A pack of Shout dye-trapping sheets because laundry is already a dreaded task, having to wash separate loads just makes it even longer. Mix whites and colored clothing together, and throw one of these sheets in the mix so your crispy white tee isn't tainted by your floral socks.\n\nBy reducing the number of necessary washes, you'll save on laundry, water, and electricity.\n\nPromising review: \"I’ve used color catchers for many years, so I can wash darks and lights together. They save time and money. You can tell they work because you see the color they soak up. If I have a garment that I know runs badly, I still wash it separately so as not to tempt fate. Recently, however, a new purple shirt took me by surprise and ran profusely. I had two color catchers in that load. They both turned deep violet. The only purple stain was on a white dish towel that had ended up next to the shirt and sat there with it for a couple of hours after the wash cycle finished. Everything else was fine. These are seriously one of the best home inventions of the modern era.\" —Go Steelers\n\nGet a box of 72 from Amazon for $10.95 (also available in packs of two and four boxes).\n\nThe reviews for this post have been edited for length and clarity.\n\nShare This Article"
