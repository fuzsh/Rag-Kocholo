        "text": "Music encompasses a wide range of genres that came out and developed over long periods of time. Two of the most popular music genres in today’s modern world are rock and metal. Although rock and metal are entirely distinct and separate genres of music, many people still seem to confuse or mix them up with each other. This comes as no surprise since the two genres share a few similarities.\n\nHowever, if you are taking music classes in Singapore, then you should be aware that rock music is not metal music. Despite their similarities, there are lots of aspects that make the rock genre different from metal. If you are still not so familiar with these two popular music genres, this article might interest you! Here are some of the essential things that make rock and metal music different from each other.\n\nWhat is Rock?\n\nRock, also popularly known as “rock and roll,” is a famous genre of music that is extensively influenced by rhythm and blues and country music, and bears resemblances with classical, blues, jazz, and folk music genres. Generally, rock music is centered on the drums and electric guitar, and its songs are often associated with a verse-chorus style and a time signature of 4/4. The usual themes of rock songs include romance and other distinct political and social themes.\n\nWhat is Metal?\n\nMetal, also formally called “heavy metal,” is a sub-genre of rock music that emphasises volume, speed, and power. Like rock music, the characteristics of metal music consist of large sounds, emphatic beats, long and complex guitar solos in between the songs, and extreme loudness. When it comes to their themes, heavy metal songs usually focus on aggression and masculinity.\n\nThe Difference Between Rock and Metal Music\n\n1. Rock began in the 1950s, while metal started in the 1960s\n\nThe origin of rock and roll dates back to the 1950s. Later on, several subgenres of rock music began to emerge, such as country, blues, folk, hard, alternative, and psychedelic rock, among others. In the late 1960s, metal music was then introduced. Both rock and metal music originated and evolved in the 1950s and 1960s. During this time, musicians like Chuck Berry and Elvis Presley were considered prominent figures.\n\n2. Rock is the main genre, while metal is a subgenre\n\nBetween rock and metal music, rock was the first to emerge as a popular genre. Since its introduction to the music scene, the genre has then continuously evolved, with new subgenres emerging every now and then. One of the most well-received sub-genres of rock music is heavy metal. As a subgenre, metal has noticeable traces of rock music.\n\n3. Rock does not use power chords on the guitar, unlike metal\n\nThe rock genre of music is a combination of famous music styles, with bass or electric guitars, drums, and vocals as the principal instruments. Modern rock bands usually draw their inspiration from blues, country, folk, and jazz music, as well as from electronic instruments, such as synthesisers. On the other hand, metal music may also contain synthesisers, but it is often more focused on the double bass or electric guitars and keyboards.\n\n4. Rock has a less deep and resonant sound than metal\n\nPerhaps the most obvious difference between rock and metal music lies in their sound. Compared to rock, metal is usually heavier, specifically in the extreme subgenres of death and black metal. Moreover, while rock music often features an electric guitar with cleaner and softer tones, metal usually has pulsating, double bass, and distorted guitars. Hence, when taking guitar learning classes, it is important to identify which music genre you wish to focus on.\n\nAdditionally, when it comes to vocals, metal songs are commonly more aggressive, with male vocals that snarl or shout. Although metal songs can also be about social issues and love, they are often heavier and contain fast tempos. Therefore, the vocals of metal music range from clean to death growls.\n\nConclusion\n\nOverall, while they may seem confusing at first, it is actually fairly easy to distinguish rock music from metal music. For one, rock music often does not focus on electric guitars and drum kits nor produces much loudness. Meanwhile, the usual aim of metal music is to create amplified loudness through electric or bass guitars and drum kits. Knowing these differences between rock and metal music can help you identify which genre best fits your music taste."
