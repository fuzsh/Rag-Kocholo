[1]\n\nThe profound sacred and spiritual meaning of the great music of the church must never be mixed with the transitory quality of rock and roll music.

And it's a... it's a term that's based on contempt; it's a term that's based on fashion, style, elitism, satanism, and, everything that's rotten about rock 'n' roll.\n\nIggy Pop Iggy Pop, punk pioneer, on Peter Gzowski's 90 Minutes Live (March 1977)\n\nRock and roll is dead, and we don't care.\n\nThe Rubinoos, quoted in: New Times, Vol. 9 (1977), p. 64\n\nIn fact rock, rather than being an example of how freedom can be achieved within the capitalist structure, is an example of how capitalism can, almost without conscious effort, deceive those whom it oppresses....So effective has the rock industry been in encouraging the spirit of optimistic youth take-over that rock's truly hard political edge, its constant exploration of the varieties of youthful frustration, has been ignored and softened.\n\nMichael Lydon, \"Rock for Sale\"; quoted in The Sociology of Rock, Simon Frith, 1978, ISBN 0094602204\n\nRock and roll music ... is not rhythm and blues music; it's not country and western music; it's not jazz; it's a combination of these things.\n\nBill Haley, The History of Rock and Roll, 1978: Hour 2: Early Rock & Roll.\n\nIn fact rock, rather than being an example of how freedom can be achieved within the capitalist structure, is an example of how capitalism can, almost without conscious effort, deceive those whom it oppresses.... So effective has the rock industry been in encouraging the spirit of optimistic youth take-over that rock's truly hard political edge, its constant exploration of the varieties of youthful frustration, has been ignored and softened.\n\nMichael Lydon, quoted in The Sociology of Rock by Simon Frith, 1978, ISBN 0094602204\n\nNo matter how long you play rock and roll, songs might change just as long as the balls are there, the rock balls.

Wiener (1986) The Beatles: a recording history, p. 252, from RKO Radio interview, December 8 1980.\n\n[Rock music] is apparently the fulfillment of the promise made by so much psychology and literature that our weak and exhausted Western civilization would find refreshment in the true source, the unconscious. … Now all has been explored; light has been cast everywhere; the unconscious has been made conscious, the repressed expressed. And what have we found? Not creative devils, but show business glitz.\n\nAllan Bloom, The Closing of the American Mind (New York: 1988), p. 79.\n\nI'd like to live off the band, but if not, I'll just retire to Mexico or Yugoslavia with a few hundred dollars, grow potatoes, and learn the history of rock through back issues of Creem magazine.\n\nKurt Cobain As quoted in The Daily Of The University Of Washington (1989-05-05)\n\nNo change in musical style will survive unless it is accompanied by a change in clothing style. Rock is to dress up to.\n\nFrank Zappa, quoted in: //Real Frank Zappa Book, (1989), p. 203\n\n1990s\n\n[edit]\n\nAs I define it, rock and roll is dead. The attitude isn't dead, but the music is no longer vital. It doesn't have the same meaning. The attitude, though, is still very much alive -- and it still informs other kinds of music.\n\nDavid Byrne in Rolling Stones magazine, December 13, 1990; cited in: Edward Cheung (2007) Baby Boomers, Generation X and Social Cycles, p. 49\n\n\"Tonight I am going to defecate on stage because I think that is the only way to express the nature of my soul according to rock and roll.\"\n\nSonic Youth From \"1991: The Year Punk Broke\"\n\nHey kids, where are you?\n\nNobody tells you what to do, baby.\n\nHey kids, rock and roll,\n\nNobody tells you where to go, baby.\n\nR.E.M. Automatic for the People (1992) Drive\n\nHypodermics on the shores, China's under martial law / Rock and Roller cola wars, I can't take it anymore\n\nBilly Joel, quoted in: Diane Ecker et al.

It attracts women. It doesn't repel them.\n\nCamille Paglia, cited in Stephen K. Sanderson (2001) The Evolution of Human Sociality, p. 177\n\nI like rock and roll, and I don't like much else.\n\nJohn Lennon, quoted in: Maury Dean (2003) Rock and Roll: Gold Rush, p. ix\n\nRock and roll doesn't necessarily mean a band.

It's that question of trying to be immortal.\n\nMalcolm McLaren, cited in: Robert Andrews (2003) The New Penguin Dictionary of Modern Quotations, p. 1107\n\nEver since I was 12 years old, I've had to defend my love of heavy metal against those who say it's a less valid form of music. My answer now is that you either feel it, or you don't. If metal doesn't give you that overwhelming surge of power and make the hair stand up on the back of your neck, you might never get it. And you know what? That's ok; because judging by the 40,000 metalheads around me, we're doing just fine without you.\n\nSam Dunn, Metal: A Headbanger's Journey (2005)\n\nRock and Roll: Music for the neck downwards.\n\nKeith Richards, quoted in: Mike Evans (2005) Rock & Roll Facts, Figures & Fun, p. 102\n\nRock and roll outfits, commence!\n\nTré Cool Bullet in a Bible (2005) (backstage in England)\n\nIf it's illegal to rock and roll, throw my ass in jail!\n\nKurt Cobain, quoted in: Noel Botham (2007) The Best Book of Useless Information Ever, p. 33\n\nI thought rock and roll was an unassailable outlet for some pure and natural expression of rebellion. It used to be one channel you could take without ever havin' to kiss arse, you know?\n\nKeith Richards, quoted in BBC NEWS, Entertainment, In quotes: Keith Richards, on news.bbc.co.uk, 4 April 2007.\n\nBlackboard Jungle is perhaps best remembered for its theme song, “Rock Around the Clock,” performed by Bill Haley and the Comets over the film’s opening title sequence. The song, written by Max C. Freedman and Jimmy DeKnight (a pseudonym for James E. Myers), was first recorded by Sonny Dae and His Knights, but it was not until Haley’s 1954 version was used on the film’s soundtrack that it held the #1 spot on the Billboard Chart for seven weeks (July 9–August 20, 1955). After receiving national airplay (the first for a rock song), “Rock Around the Clock” became the bestselling single to date. An expression of teenage defiance and rebellion against authority, coupled with its link to a film about juvenile delinquency, “Rock Around the Clock” was adopted by teenagers around the world as their official anthem.\n\nStephen Tropiano “Obscene, Indecent, Immoral, and Offensive 100+ Years of Censored, Banned and Controversial Films”, Limelight Editions, 2009, ch.4\n\n2010s\n\n[edit]\n\n\"Rock and Roll\" is about me. If I hadn't heard rock and roll on the radio, I would have had no idea there was life on this planet. Which would have been devastating to think that everything, everywhere was like it was where I come from. That would have been profoundly discouraging. Movies didn't do it for me. TV didn't do it for me. It was the radio that did it.\n\nLou Reed, quoted in: Richard Overy (2012) 20th Century, p. 193\n\nThe heart of rock and roll is the beat.\n\nHuey Lewis, quoted in: Nicolae Sfetcu (2014) American Music, p. 49\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nSoul music\n\nWikipedia has an article about:\n\nLyricWiki\n\nRock's Backpages"
