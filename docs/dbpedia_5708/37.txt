I've often contemplated writing a work of rock fiction, but I've always been put off by how few good ones there are, and how easy it appears to be to become mired in the kind of moronic clichés that Spinal Tap lampooned so mercilessly. Which perhaps explains why, in the fifty-something years since Elvis told his mama it was all right, the Great Rock 'n' Roll Novel remains defiantly unwritten.

Sure, there are countless examples of novels that use specific musical references as scene dressing or as a cultural compass — few things more effectively establish time and character than dropping a song title into the narrative; and, it allows authors the chance to show off their record collections. And there have been several novels told from a fan's unique perspective, most notably High Fidelity. But I've yet to read a novel that convincingly sums up the experience of making popular music, or that captures the weird, savage compulsion that keeps everyone from Bloc Party to Bob Dylan traipsing around the world, year-in and year-out.

There have been some notable contenders: Iain Banks — whose brilliant, bloody, and darkly hilarious novel Crow Road is offered as part of Powell's Indiespensable box in October, alongside a unique mini-edition of I Shot a Man in Reno — did a great job with Espedair Street, a cautionary tale about fictional Scottish prog-rock band Frozen Gold, who form, soar, and — inevitably — combust.

What else? Don DeLillo's Great Jones Street? Salman Rushdie's The Ground Beneath Her Feet, Roddy Doyle's The Commitments (Vintage Contemporaries), or Emma Forrest's Namedropper? John Niven's wicked Kill Your Friends created a buzz recently in the UK, but ultimately it felt like too much sub-Easton Ellis style and far precious little substance (although there were plenty of substances). Or what about less high-profile titles such as Alan Arlt's The Carpet Frogs and Michael Turner's Hard Core Logo? Some have been better than others, a few have been excellent, but none have truly convinced. And here's why:

• Writing about music is hard enough at the best of times; try writing about music that doesn't exist. The basic, inescapable flaw in every rock novel is the fact that the reader can't hear the music and thus struggles to identify with the artist. Strip away any audible, self-evident sign of talent — the songs, in other words — and most rock stars simply become posturing bores. Hardly the stuff of great fiction.

• Good novelists have a tendency to get sloppy when they write about popular music; it sometimes comes over like an exercise in cultural slumming that almost inevitably lends itself to unoriginal plots and indulgent writing, clicking through the tropes of standard rock behaviour with a nod and a self-congratulatory wink. From their names on down — Ormus Cana? Bucky Wunderlick? — the characters rarely ring true, apparently hell-bent on playing out the author's own fantasies rather than attempting to illuminate what the great rock 'n' roll circus actually means.

• Rock novels are pitched at an enormously demanding readership. If the atmosphere and language aren't spot on, we turn off. If we don't share the musical tastes of the writer, we struggle to engage. We're so acutely aware of the tiniest rituals of a gig, or the peculiarly nuanced language deployed by musicians, that an author has to avoid a minefield of cliché while still creating something familiar enough to convince — and that's a tough tightrope to walk.
