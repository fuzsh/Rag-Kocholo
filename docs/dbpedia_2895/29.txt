Delays are expected after a Metra Rock Island train struck a vehicle Monday morning in Chicago's Morgan Park neighborhood.

Inbound and outbound trains were halted around 7:30 a.m. after Train #302 collided with a vehicle near the 115th Street station, officials said.

So far, there are no reported injuries.

Metra said Mainline trains will operate on the Beverly Branch until further notice.
