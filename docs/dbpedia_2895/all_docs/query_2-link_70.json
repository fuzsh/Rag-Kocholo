Until 1971, Baltimore & Ohio passenger trains used this route between Elizabeth Street (formerly Brainerd Jct.) and Beverly Jct. East of Brainerd Jct., now abandoned trackage crossed the Rock Island main line, connecting with the former Rock Island South Chicago Branch, which is now Chicago Rail Link. And northwest of Beverly Jct., now abandoned trackage connected with what now is the CSX Blue Island Subdivision at 79th Street. Until 2018, that line had an unusual method of operation which involved time spacing. There were basically no block signals, and control operators at the Gresham Jct. and Blue Island towers were required to not allow following trains to enter the line until after 10 minutes.\n\nCLICK FOR RAILFAN TIPS AND PHOTOS\n\nRadio Frequency - 161.340 (AAR Channel 82)\n\nStations/Former Stations/Milepost Locations\n\n(Current Metra stops are capitalized)\n\nDirection is westward from Gresham Jct. to Western Avenue Jct.\n\nDistance is from Chicago\n\n9.9 Gresham Jct.
