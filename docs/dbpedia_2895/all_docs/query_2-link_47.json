        "text": "Quote:\n\nOriginally Posted by Bali Hai\n\nConsidering a work transfer and the one place I found with a good price point was right by the station. I would be moving from the region but out of state, in WI.\n\nDon't take this question the wrong way, (this question has to do with the Chicago's historic racial segregation patterns and not meant to be a personal endorsement of segregation) are you African American? If the answer is yes then living in that neighborhood might suit your needs, it is a relatively stable (by inner city standards) middle class black neighborhood. It is near Chicago State University and that along with CTA and Metra access helps that immediate area, of course there are still pockets of bad areas and problems and because the 95th Red line is such a feeder station for buses from all kinds of neighborhoods sometimes suspicious people will be near the station. If you are not African American you might feel like a fish out of water in that area and given the unfortunate segregation patters in Chicago you might become a target to the lesser elements who live there even though a vast majority of the people living there are just average working and middle class families who will live and let live. There is a slightly more upscale area called Pill-Hill a bit further to the east but still almost all African American, just more exclusively middle to upper middle class. The area with the largest non African-American population nearby would be in the Pullman Historic District which is bounded by 111th Street, Cottage Grove, 115th Street and I-94/Calumet Expressway, this area has a Metra station right there and the 95th Red Line station is a short bus ride away.\n\nI have experience with this conundrum because I have a friend who works at Chicago State University who happens to be white and takes public transportation from the near west side everyday and while he wouldn't want to live there for reasons I stated earlier he has no problem with working there nor with interacting with people in the neighborhood on a daily basis."
