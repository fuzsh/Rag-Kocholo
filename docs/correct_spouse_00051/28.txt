After secretly marrying in 2006 in Los Angeles, USA, Charlene Choi and Ronald Cheng will be obtaining a divorce. Despite each of their own sizeable fortunes, the pair separate on good terms and will not split their property assets.

Ronald, the son of billionaire Norman Cheng (CEO and Chairman of EMI Music), owns a million dollar home in Repulse Bay. When Charlene married Ronald in 2006, she could have retired from the entertainment industry and lived the life of a socialite due to Ronald’s wealth.

However, Charlene insisted on working and accumulated a sizeable personal fortune as well. After marrying Ronald, Charlene sold her waterfront luxury home and profited $5 million (HKD) from the sale. She secretly moved in Ronald’s house afterwards. In 2009, Charlene earned approximately $50 million (HKD) from her album sales, movies, ad endorsements, theater engagement, and other sources of income. Charlene is a millionaire in her own right.

With their upcoming divorce, Charlene is eligible to split Ronald’s wealth and assets. However, the pair did not want to argue over financial matters and have decided not to divide their assets.

In a recent press conference, the pair also clarified that the divorce was not due to Ronald’s involvement with a third party.
