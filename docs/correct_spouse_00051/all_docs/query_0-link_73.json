        "text": "HONG KONG, Sept 23 — The rumour mill has gone into overdrive as to the exact reason why William Chan and Charlene Choi officially called time on their nearly five-year relationship on Sunday.\n\nIn a joint statement on their respective Weibo blogs, Chan and Choi put the blame squarely on the shoulders of the media and fans, citing a lack of privacy and respect for their relationship as the main pressure points that drove them apart.\n\nIt read, in part, according to IHTV: “Every artiste would hope that they would get recognised for their own hard work, but no matter how hard you try, your relationship life would always end up taking the most focus.\n\n“You always tell yourself that ‘those who eat salted fish must put up with the thirst,’ but in the end, it becomes a kind of intangible pressure.”\n\nIt continued, “Please stop with the hurt. Stop putting focus on things outside of our work. Stop the endless guessing and the smearing. Give us more space so we can do our jobs well, live well, and feel the beauty that this world has given us.”\n\nVarious media reports, however, have alleged that the 29-year-old actor, who has found fame in China recently, had fallen for his co-star, popular Chinese actress, Zanilia Zhao.\n\nRumour has it Chan was caught holding hands with Zhao while practising lines from a script.\n\nAt rehearsals for a charity fundraising programme organised by TVB, a reportedly downcast Choi refuted the claims and emphasised to reporters that her split with Chan was not due to another woman coming between them.\n\nThe 32-year-old was quoted by On.cc as saying, “There was never any [third party]! None! It was mainly because we were both really busy and saw very little of each other.”\n\nAfter stating emphatically that they remain friends, she reiterated that their relationship became strained due to the constant onslaught of negative remarks by fans.\n\nShe added, “I don’t mind receiving personal attacks on myself, but it was heart-breaking when fans would attack [him]. That was really the last thing I wanted.”\n\nChan and Choi began dating in late 2010. The pair allegedly grew close after starring together in the 2010 Wong Jing film “Beauty on Duty!”\n\nIt is understood that fans disapproved of the union because at the time of filming, Choi was still married to Ronald Cheng while Chan was dating Angelababy, with many accusing the actor of riding the coattails of Choi’s fame as one half of female double act, Twins."
