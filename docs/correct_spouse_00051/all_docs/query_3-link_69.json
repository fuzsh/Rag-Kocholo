        "text": "Give Them a Chance is bookeded by megastar Andy Lau. The opening sets up the Heavenly King of Cantopop as a benevolent Hong Kong entertainment deity who, grateful for all the opportunities and behind-the-scenes support through the years, wishes to bestow the same to others so that they can find success in the industry. Fast forward 95 minutes and there’s Andy, living out his dream of helping people make it big. The credits roll to footage from his 2001 concert featuring a group of background dancers shaking it like there’s no tomorrow. And they are the real stars of this movie.\n\nThe film gets an A for effort, not for Andy Lau’s altruism. It suffices as the feel good, based on a true story movie of the week, and though it occasionally tries to push those boundaries a little too far, it succeeds in corralling its audience’s sympathy towards the talented lower class teens who want a little more out of the life they’re dealt.\n\nDespite their break dancing ambitions, the kids face one dead end after another. They’re hardly ace students, and the one healthy interest they have gets thwarted by adults who think they’re up to no good. Even the city won’t give them a break. During an outdoor performance, a cop tells them in the politest terms to shove off because wealthy tourists at a nearby hotel have complained about the noise, and we know who takes priority there.\n\nLuckily there are some people who see potential in Hong Kong’s youth, including aspiring dancer turned action director Sam (Andy Hui) and injured former dancer Jack (Osman Hung), a pair of quarrelling brothers who try to put aside their grudges for the greater good and build a practice studio. Their story threads together the patchwork of teens who flock to the new dance haven. Brothers Durian and Kenny, each with his own medical issue, vie for the attention of longtime friend Money, who develops feelings for Jim, who is also on shaky terms with his older brother.\n\nThe amount of teen angst can be a little overpowering and is not helped by some of the actors, particularly Andy Lau’s goddaughter Ellis Tang who babbles like a preschooler. Howard Kwok, on the other hand, is very affecting as Kenny despite not saying anything. This could also have been a more inspiring and artistically successful film with stronger dance sequences and better music, but this was never supposed to be Step Up. Instead, the movie works from ground up and, like the kids, doesn’t have the package or polish of other commercial films. This doesn’t necessarily make it better but it does make it more satisfying to watch.\n\nReleased: 2003\n\nProd: Sam Wong 黃明昇, Ng Kin-Hung 伍健雄\n\nDir: Herman Yau 邱禮濤\n\nWriter: Yeung Yee-Shan 楊漪珊; Herman Yau 邱禮濤\n\nCast: Andy Hui 許志安; Ellis Tang 鄧肇欣; Johnathan Cheung 張穎康; Walter Wong 黃家倫; Howard Kwok 郭浩東; Osman Hung 洪智傑; Eddie Pang 彭懷安; Anna Yau 丘凱敏; Jason Wong 黃益平; Joe Cheung 張同祖; Liu Kai-Chi 廖啟智; Anthony Wong 黃秋生; Mark Lui 雷頌德; Alex Fong Lik-Sun 方力申; Ronald Cheng 鄭中基; Stephanie Che 車婉婉; Wayne Lai 黎耀祥; Amanda Lee 李蕙敏; Andy Lau 劉德華\n\nTime: 98 min\n\nLang: Cantonese\n\nCountry: Hong Kong\n\nReviewed: 2014\n\nSomewhere, a fung shui master is thousands of dollars richer after conning the makers of My Lucky Star into going ahead with this project. The movie feels twice as long as its 100 minutes, and not even stars Tony Leung Chiu-Wai and Miriam Yeung can add much life to it. Of course, this might be expected when the entire story rests on the minutiae of fung shui and people’s obsession with avoiding bad luck or, as some see it, reality.\n\nThe Chinese New Year comedy tries to capitalize on the audience’s appetite for anything auspicious, and the transformation of one of Hong Kong’s unluckiest residents seems like a good start. Yip Koo-Hung (Yeung) can’t get a break in any area of her life. She’s on the brink of being fired, she can’t leave the house without tripping over herself, and she’s been held up multiple times. It’s a case for top fung shui master Lai Liu-Po (Leung), except he refuses to see anyone surnamed Yip owing to some fung shui cock up generations back.\n\nShe sneaks by anyhow, and Liu-Po agrees to help her because that’s what the story requires. It also demands that they fall in love, though the romance pops out of nowhere. Hung literally jumps into the screen and, armed with nothing more a crayon map of her house, a cute smile, and a lot of chutzpah, the two have the makings of a beautiful friendship.\n\nThey hit a few road bumps, but then the movie shuffles to the second major conflict involving a scheming stepmother (Teresa Carpio), a spoiled pop star (Chapman To), and a rival fung shui master (Ronald Cheng). With their powers combined, they conspire to make Hung’s life miserable where fate will not. There’s a message somewhere in this about kindness and karma, but it’s not beaten into the audience the same way it’s been with recent holiday films.\n\nMy Lucky Star is also missing the other elements that make New Year’s movies fun, if not intellectually demanding. It’s so cluttered with fung shui references that anyone who isn’t an avowed fan or practitioner will have a hard time relating to the characters. And though the film has a few funny moments regarding Hong Kong’s state of affairs, it is mostly short on comedy.\n\nBesides an unamusing script, Hung and Liu-Po don’t really click as a couple. While the ever suave Leung delivers his dialogue with crisp, rapid fire precision, Yeung’s interpretation of Hung rests on scrunching up her face and throwing fits like a seven year old who’s grounded from Chuck E Cheese. She had proven herself a capable comedienne with hits like Love Undercover, but at this point in her career, Yeung was a better fit for the Daniel Wus of the world.\n\n“Hold On at All Costs” (有愛錯無放過) theme song by Tony Leung and Miriam Yeung:\n\nReleased: 2003\n\nProd: Vincent Kok 谷德昭; David Chan 陳錫康\n\nDir: Vinent Kok 谷德昭\n\nWriter: Vincent Kok 谷德昭; Patrick Kong 葉念琛\n\nCast: Tony Leung Chiu-Wai 梁朝偉; Miriam Yeung 楊千嬅; Ronald Cheng 鄭中基; Chapman To 杜汶澤; Vincent Kok 谷德昭; Teresa Caprio 杜麗莎; Alex Fong Chung-Sun 方中信; Mark Lui 雷頌德; Anya 安雅; Ken Wong 王合喜; Ken Cheung 張智堯; Sammy Leung 森美; Kitty Yuen 阮小儀; Josie Ho 何超儀; William So 蘇永康; Patrick Tang 鄧健泓; Alex Fong Lik-Sun 方力申; Peter So 蘇民峰; Steven Fung 馮勉恆; various celebrities\n\nTime: 99 min\n\nLang: Cantonese, some English\n\nCountry: Hong Kong\n\nReviewed: 2014\n\nI own two copies of this movie and can’t really justify either. That’s not to say Dance of a Dream is terrible, but you’ll need to find a few good reasons for watching – and the story is not one. Poorly plotted and weak in character development, the movie relies heavily on the attraction of its three stars, who allow the film to limp from start to finish.\n\nAndy Lau’s smooth talking ballroom dance instructor Namson and his partner Faye Wong (Gordon Lam) run a small studio that’s feeling the financial pinch. A one night gig turns into a long term opportunity though when an uptight but wealthy executive, Tina Cheung (Anita Mui), hires Namson as her personal coach. She wants to dazzle at an upcoming party and, for reasons unknown, goes with him instead of an internationally renowned teacher. At the same time, happy-go-lucky Kam (Sandra Ng) becomes smitten with the tank-over-tee clad dancer and also splurges on lessons. Rather than some much hoped for private instruction, however, Kam ends up in a class with a lovable bunch of misfits.\n\nThe midsection of this film substitutes story with showcase, and while a love triangle brews in the background, the stars do their thing and play to their strengths. Lau as Namson gets to be the center of attention, adored by all despite some pretty egregious character flaws. He’s condescending and selfish but comes off cool as a Jet. One gets the feeling Andy Lau just wanted an excuse to slink around; he certainly puts his hips to good use in this picture.\n\nHis costars also deliver the goods. Mui’s icy stares keep Tina wrapped in her own haughty bubble, content with staying an arm’s length away from Kam and her bouncy classmates. Mui is equally comfortable playing the caring confidant, in a character shift that is just assumed and never fully explained.\n\nNg is the effervescent heart of this movie though, infusing this Christmas release with the most feel good factor. She pulls Kam upward in many ways. Her character is goofy, neurotic, insecure but also so transparently positive that her main fault – being a giddy fangirl – seems endearing and almost virtuous. Even in her disappointments, Kam manages to find a smile.\n\nWhich is a good thing because there are a lot of question marks in this movie. The main function of the weak plot is to shuttle the characters from beginning to end, with some song and dance diversions in between. Besides Namson’s desire to dream big, little attention is paid to motivations and meaning of everyone and everything else. Supposedly he helps Tina and Kam realize themselves but it’s never clear why they are unfulfilled and what he does to improve this. Dance helps, but this isn’t really a dancer’s movie, and it is treated more as a pastime than as a passion.\n\nA fun supporting cast that includes Ronald Cheng, Lam Tze-Chung, and Cherrie Ying do what they can, which isn’t much. Gordon Lam comes off the best, playing a cheeky second fiddle to Lau and stealing at least one scene with his spot on Jacky Cheung impression. At least there is the music, with contributions from the three leads. It’s not award winning stuff, but it’s light and pretty, like a dream.\n\n“Dance of a Dream” (“愛君如夢”) by Andy Lau and Sandra Ng:\n\n“Do You Still Remember Me” (“還記得我嗎”) by Andy Lau:\n\nReleased: 2001\n\nProd: Andy Lau 劉德華; Andrew Lau 劉偉強\n\nDir: Andrew Lau 劉偉強\n\nWriter: Felix Chong 莊文強\n\nCast: Andy Lau 劉德華; Anita Mui 梅艷芳; Sandra Ng 吳君如; Gordon Lam 林家棟; Edison Chen 陳冠希; Ronald Cheng 鄭中基; Cherrie Ying 應采兒; Halina Tam 譚小環; Belinda Hamnett 韓君婷; Lam Tze-Chung 林子聰; Wong Yue 黃蕊\n\nTime: 94 min\n\nLang: Cantonese, some English\n\nCountry: Hong Kong\n\nReviewed: 2014"
