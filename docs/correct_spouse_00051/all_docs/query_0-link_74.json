The elder Shi is reportedly worth billions, which explains his son's moniker.\n\nIf the reports are to be believed, it will be the second marriage for Charlene, who was briefly married to Hong Kong singer Ronald Cheng before they divorced in 2010.\n\n[embed]https://www.instagram.com/p/Bt-hz7SgBCU/[/embed]\n\nCharlene and Anthony reportedly began dating in 2017, following her break-up with singer-actor William Chan in 2015.\n\nAccording to Eastweek magazine, the couple have blended well into each others' families and social circles. Anthony's family, in particular, is said to dote on Charlene.\n\nRumours of the couple's impending nuptials have been swirling since late last year, with latest reports pushing it to the top of Weibo's trending topics today (March 7).\n\nThe wedding is said to be held at the end of the year as Charlene will be busy with several film projects till then.\n\nHowever, in its reply to media on Thursday, her management agency Emperor Group has denied reports of the impending nuptials, stating that they are \"not true\".\n\ncandicecai@asiaone.com"
