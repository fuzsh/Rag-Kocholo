        "text": "Hong Kong actress and singer\n\nCharlene Choi Tsoek-jin[1] (Chinese: 蔡卓妍; born 22 November 1982[3]) is a Hong Kong actress and singer. She is a member of Cantopop group Twins, along with Gillian Chung.[4]\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nChoi was born in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. She moved with her family to Hong Kong a few years later.[when?] She was educated at Marymount Secondary School and Rosaryhill School. She is fluent in Cantonese, English and Mandarin.[2] After graduating from Rosaryhill School, where many other would-be pop stars had attended, she started working full-time as a model in Hong Kong. She was scouted by Emperor Entertainment Group (EEG), and was then linked with Gillian Chung to form the Cantopop group Twins.\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nActing\n\n[edit]\n\nAside from her musical career, Choi has become a successful actress in the Hong Kong film industry. She wrote an article describing her acting career:\n\nEarlier, I shared with everyone some of my acting experiences. This time, I want to talk about movies. As an artist, whenever I'm working, I have to show my best side and give my best performance. I have to show the fittest side of me and hence, I'm often in \"battle mode\". When free, I like to watch slow-paced movies. I can't stand movies with too much excitement. I'm the type who can be easily sucked into the world of the movie. That type of fast-paced movie will end up making me tense and nervous so comedy, romance or movies centered on issues of humanity all suit me better.\"\n\nChoi's first acting gig was a starring role in the 2000 television drama Youth Y2K. Choi made her first film debut in 2001 in Funeral March (filmed prior to Twins' debut), which drew rave reviews from critics and earned her a Best New Performer nomination at the 21st Hong Kong Film Awards. Choi's next big acting break was in 2003 with her earnest and pretence-free portrayal of a young girl who battles through all odds in hopes of becoming a singer in Diva – Ah Hey.[citation needed]\n\nChoi has taken Jim Chim as a mentor, and portrayed a kind and comedic porn star in the comedy film Simply Actors (2007). Her breakthrough role in the Pang brothers' psychological thriller Diary (2006) earned her many film award nominations and she received the Best Actress award at the 11th Bucheon International Fantastic Film Festival (BiFan Korean Movie Award). Choi's acting was identified by film critics with her portrayal of Dani Dan in Simply Actors. She won the Best Actress and Favourite Actress awards at the 2007 Golden Bauhinia Awards for her performance. Choi also played the leading role alongside the Taiwanese singer Jay Chou in the 2008 comedy-action film Kung Fu Dunk.[citation needed]\n\nChoi co-starred with Wu Chun and Hu Ge in The Butterfly Lovers, based on the Chinese legend of the same name, which was released on 9 October 2008. Throughout the filming, rumors of an off-set romance between Choi and Wu Chun developed. Though they have denied such rumors, Wu stated that the pair reached an agreement with director Jingle Ma to collaborate once again in the future.[citation needed]\n\nIn December 2008, she began filming her first Taiwanese television drama, Calling For Love, produced by Angie Chai, co-starring with Mike He. The series was first aired in May 2010.[citation needed]\n\nIn December 2009 after over a year of post-production, positive response at the Shanghai International Film Festival, The Storm Warriors was released with Choi taking on the main female lead role as Second Dream and starring alongside Aaron Kwok, Ekin Cheng, Simon Yam and Nicholas Tse. Though it was only released on 10 December, The Storm Warriors ranked fifth in the Hong Kong Chinese-language box office of the year.[citation needed]\n\nIn 2010, after having concentrated heavily on music in the previous year, Choi started taking on more acting projects. Her first film for that year was Beauty on Duty, which she co-starred with Sandra Ng. Following that, Choi appeared in Triple Tap with Daniel Wu and Louis Koo. Choi's next film, The Jade and the Pearl, saw her co-starring with Raymond Lam and her close friends Joey Yung and Wong Cho-lam, as well as a collaboration between Choi and Lam in singing a duet theme song. Choi concluded work on God of Fortune's Inn with Nicholas Tse and Nick Cheung. She again co-starred with Nicholas Tse in Mainland Chinese television series Sword Heroes' Fate, which was aired in 2011.\n\nStarring as Chan in Detective vs Sleuths, the latest film from director Wai Ka Fai, co-founder of Milkyway Image. As per the director's comment during interviews, Choi took the risk by performing many of the stunts herself while shooting.[citation needed]\n\nMusical career\n\n[edit]\n\nChoi's first solo song, Diva, Ah Hey!, was released in Twins' 2003 album Touch of Love. The song received a nomination for Best Song at the 23rd Hong Kong Film Awards and won a place in the Top 10 Songs at the Jade Solid Gold Songs Awards Ceremony. Choi's second solo song, Watching Movie Alone, was released in Twins' 2006 Mandarin album Around the World with 80 Dollars. Choi's third solo song, You are Not a Good Lover, was released in Twins' 2006 Cantonese album Ho Hoo Tan. This was Choi's first recorded personal composition and Twins' recorded version earned the place of Hit Song at the Metro Showbiz Hit Awards and one of the Top 10 Songs at the Jade Solid Gold Songs Awards Ceremony.\n\nChoi's remaining two solo songs, \"Little Sister\" and \"60 Percent\", were released before the Edison Chen photo scandal in their 2008 Mandarin album Tong Hua Yan Yu. Both solo songs were extremely personal, \"Little Sister\", in particular, recounts Choi's relationship with her mother throughout the years despite her parents' divorce at a young age and won Choi several music awards at the Metro Showbiz Hit Awards and TVB8 Music Awards.[citation needed]\n\nChoi's first solo single was released in 2008 with the award-winning \"Make a Wish\", which sold 5000 copies within a span of 30 minutes with all proceeds going to the Make-A-Wish Foundation. Meanwhile, her two hit songs, \"Little Sister\" and \"Make a Wish\" ranked first in music charts and remained in the top 10 for four music charts over 11 weeks. With Twins placed on hiatus, Choi went on to be awarded with a variety of solo singer awards in 2008: Favorite Idol and Most Voted Singer at the Metro Showbiz Hit Awards, Most Popular Female Singer at the Vanguard Music Awards and Most Popular Hong Kong Female Artist at the Sprite Music Awards.\n\nTowards the end of 2008, Choi further expanded her career, entering new fields of the entertainment industry. In the musical Knight Star she stars as the female lead Rose. Acting as her lover, she reunited with Jimmy Lin after seven years. Lin first collaborated with Choi in her first series The Monkey King: Quest for the Sutra when she first entered the industry. Other stars in the musical include Julian Cheung, and Alice Liu. The musical served as a promotional event for the Chivas company to expand in China with their \"Live with Chivalry\" campaign.[citation needed]\n\nChoi's first musical collaboration as a solo singer with another artist was the duet \"Little Dimples\", released in late September 2008, which she performed with JJ Lin. The song received six awards in the remaining three months of 2008.[citation needed]\n\nChoi released her debut solo album Two Without One on 9 April 2009. In less than one week, the album sold 10,000 copies in Hong Kong and has been certified \"Gold\" in Hong Kong. In less than a month, the album sold a total of 30,000 copies in Hong Kong and was certified \"Platinum\". Due to high sales and demand, a second version of the album is slated to be released on 6 May as a limited edition with 5,000 copies available.[citation needed]\n\nFollowing the success of Two Without One, Choi released her next EP, titled Another Me, on 15 October 2009. Consisting of five tracks and three music videos, the overall theme of the EP is an evolving process as an individual. The release of Another Me marked new territory for Choi with a black-and-white cover and a largescale photo exhibition open to the public. As with Two Without One, Another Me was also certified \"Platinum\", selling nearly 60,000 copies in Hong Kong, in addition to high sales in Asia and overseas. Choi's success as a solo female singer in 2009 was best displayed at the 2009 IFPI HK Top Sales Music Awards, where she was awarded \"Top 10 Best Selling Hong Kong Singers of 2009\". In addition, Two Without One and Another Me were each awarded \"Top 10 Best Selling Cantonese Albums of 2009.\"[citation needed]\n\nFollowing her success in 2009 as a solo singer, Choi released her debut Mandarin album As A Sa in 2010. With more than HK$1 million spent on producing the album, As A Sa was released across China on 15 June. Consequently, Choi launched her country-wide promotional tour with a multitude of mini-concerts, autograph sessions, performances, recorded television programs, national radio interviews, and talk shows.[citation needed]\n\nChoi has released her third Cantonese album Beauty Remains on 15 October 2010.[citation needed]\n\nChoi reunited with Gillian and released a new song titled \"Femininity\" to celebrate Twins' 20th anniversary. The music video was released on 18 May 2021, featuring Twins' songs including \"Strawberry Apple Orange\", \"Summer Frenzy\", \"Thank You So Much\" and \"Love is Bigger than the Sky\". Affected by the pandemic and quarantine policy, an online concert \"TME live Super Live Twins 20 Love You Anniversary Celebration\" was held that month, broadcast live exclusively with Tencent's TME and JOOX.[citation needed]\n\nLater in the same year, Choi and Gillian went on recording the theme song for the movie \"Sunny Sisters\" and released a new song \"Nice to Meet You\".[citation needed]\n\nCharlene signed up for the comeback survival reality show Sister Who Make Waves season 3 with her long time bandmate Gillian Chung. They were competing against a lineup of a total of 28 female artists with diverse talents. On 5 August 2022, Charlene Choi debuted at 7th place for the third season of Sisters Who Make Waves which premiered on May 20, 2022, on Mango TV.[citation needed]\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nCharlene Choi and Ronald Cheng knew each other through the film The Pursuit of August 15, scandals are spread that they are dating in the set of this film. At the beginning of 2010, a news broke out on the internet that they got married. On March 17, 2010, at the promotion of the film The Secret Order of Beauty, she said that she had broken up with Cheng for some time, and the two were separated because of mutual understanding. Cheng admitted that he had been separated from Choi during the promotion of the film The Treasure Box of Yue Guang. On March 27, 2010, the Apple Daily in Hong Kong published the marriage certificate that the two married in the Van Nuys, Los Angeles as early as January 31, 2006.[5] In the evening of the same day, the two attended a press conference and admitted that they were married as early as 2006 and had completed the divorce procedures for several months.\n\nAfterwards, Charlene Choi and William Chan publicly kissed each other after their collaboration in the film The Secret Order of Beauty, and they publicly admitted their relationship on October 10, 2010;[6] on September 20, 2015, they both issued a statement on Weibo announcing their breakup[7]\n\nIn the fall of 2017, Charlene Choi was rumoured to be dating Shi Hengcong, and later confirmed her new relationship in person during the event.[8] In 2019, Charlene Choi completed her second egg freezing procedure.[9]\n\nPhilanthropy\n\n[edit]\n\nAs a donor to the Make-A-Wish Foundation since 2001 and a Make a Wish ambassador in 2008, Choi released the hit single and award-winning 'Make a Wish', which sold 5000 copies within a span of 30 minutes with all proceeds going to the foundation. Choi also sold clothing from her own \"SAL\" clothing line to fans to raise more money for the foundation.[citation needed]\n\nChoi also wrote an autobiographical book about her teenage years as a child of divorced parents. Although she remains close to both her parents, Choi lived with her father after her parents' divorce. However, following her decision to become a singer-actress, the time she spent at home and with her parents rapidly diminished. As a result, the means of communicating with her father became all the more special. In her book Single Family's Love, many little notes exchanged between her and her father over the years can be seen. Through the autobiography, readers are encouraged to find happiness in single parent families. The money raised from the 5000 Limited 1st Edition copies sold were all donated to the Make a Wish Foundation. Choi thanked her friends and fans for the good sales of her autobiography. Her friends such as Jay Chou (who wrote her book's introduction), bandmate Gillian Chung (who also put her thoughts into Choi's introduction), Niki Chow, Mani, and Wu Chun were big supporters as well, buying copies for their friends and families. As of now, a new edition of her book is being printed and will be distributed overseas.[citation needed]\n\nChoi became an ambassador for the 30 Hours Famine charity in the beginning of February 2009. She went to Nepal for a week to help the locals by bringing supplies to schools. In return, she was taught the local gardening technique. In April 2009, Choi performed at the 30-Hour Famine Concert, opening the concert and performing an assortment of new Chinese and English songs, as well as old Twins songs for nearly an hour.[citation needed]\n\nDiscography\n\n[edit]\n\nFor Choi's work with Twins, see Twins discography.\n\nYear Title Notes 2008 Make a Wish Cantonese single 2009 Lonely Me Cantonese album Another Me Cantonese EP 2010 As A Sa Mandarin album Beauty Remains Cantonese EP 2011 Sweetest Day Cantonese CD + Cantonese & Mandarin DVD Collection 2012 Montage Cantonese CD + Cantonese Bonus DVD 2013 Blooming Cantonese CD + Cantonese Bonus DVD\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\nFilm\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Role Notes Ref 2000 What Is a Good Teacher 自從他來了 Student Cameo 2001 Funeral March 常在我心 Wong Kwan-yee Heroes in Love 戀愛起義之不得了 Charlene 2002 Just One Look Nam My Wife Is 18 Yoyo Ma Suk-ling Summer Breeze of Love 這個夏天有異性 Choi Kei 2003 The Twins Effect Helen The Death Curse Nancy Ting Diva...
