        "text": "A recent egg freezing procedure may be the reason why Charlene Choi looks a little chubbier than usual.\n\nThe Hong Kong singer-actress revealed on Tuesday (May 14) that she had completed a round of the fertility treatment.\n\nThe cause of her weight gain? 10 hormone injections that she had to take before the procedure.\n\nShe was afraid of administering the jabs herself but eventually got the hang of it, Charlene said.\n\nThe 36-year-old shared that she once miscalculated the date for injection when she was on vacation at Sun Moon Lake, Taiwan.\n\nThere were no clinics nearby so she had to call her doctor in Hong Kong to ask for medical advice. Although the ovum was not lost, the incident left her in shock.\n\n[[nid:439989]]\n\nBut it hasn't deterred her from going for a second round of egg freezing.\n\n\"The number of eggs is just nice right now. It's safer to do another round. I am not young anymore,\" she said.\n\nSince they can only be stored for 10 years, when will Charlene be using her frozen eggs?\n\nThe singer said that she \"still does not have plans\" for a baby although she has been in a steady relationship with billionaire Anthony Shek since 2017.\n\nCharlene was previously secretly married to singer Ronald Cheng for four years, and it only came to light when they announced their divorce in 2010.\n\nALSO READ: Christy Chung, 48, reveals IVF journey behind weight gain; wants 4th child\n\nasiaone@mm2entertainment.com"
