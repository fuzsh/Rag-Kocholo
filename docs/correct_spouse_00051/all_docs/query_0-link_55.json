        "text": "Choi's remaining two solo songs, \"Little Sister\" and \"60 Percent\", were released before the Edison Chen photo scandal in their 2008 Mandarin album Tong Hua Yan Yu. Both solo songs were extremely personal, \"Little Sister\", in particular, recounts Choi's relationship with her mother throughout the years despite her parents' divorce at a young age and won Choi several music awards at the Metro Showbiz Hit Awards and TVB8 Music Awards.[citation needed]\n\nCharlene Choi and Ronald Cheng knew each other through the film The Pursuit of August 15, scandals are spread that they are dating in the set of this film. At the beginning of 2010, a news broke out on the internet that they got married. On March 17, 2010, at the promotion of the film The Secret Order of Beauty, she said that she had broken up with Cheng for some time, and the two were separated because of mutual understanding. Cheng admitted that he had been separated from Choi during the promotion of the film The Treasure Box of Yue Guang. On March 27, 2010, the Apple Daily in Hong Kong published the marriage certificate that the two married in the Vannes District of Los Angeles as early as January 31, 2006.[5] In the evening of the same day, the two attended a press conference and admitted that they were married as early as 2006 and had completed the divorce procedures for several months.\n\nCharlene Choi Scandal Video\n\nDOWNLOAD ↔ https://bytlly.com/2zcc6k\n\nChoi's Twins group mate Gillian Chung was embroiled in a photo scandal with Edison Chen, when intimate photos of them were leaked onto the Internet in 2008. Since then, Chung has kept her distance from Chen to avoid further controversy.\n\nIn 2008, intimate and private photographs of Hong Kong actor Edison Chen with various women, including actresses Gillian Chung, Bobo Chan, Rachel Ngan, and Cecilia Cheung, were unlawfully distributed over the Internet.[1] The scandal shook the Hong Kong entertainment industry and received high-profile media attention locally and around the world. Many local newspapers headlined the story consecutively during the first fortnight of February 2008, relegating coverage of the 2008 Chinese winter storms to secondary prominence during Lunar New Year.\n\nOn 3 February, a small group led by Leung Kwok-hung protested the abuse of power by the police. One week later, there was a larger protest demonstrated against alleged \"discriminatory\" law enforcement against Internet users. The involvement of local celebrities led to complaints that the wave of arrests were indicative of a legal double standard:[74] protesters claimed that the police failed to investigate other cases of nude photos being published without their subject's permission.[75] Approximately 300 people marched on police headquarters in Wan Chai. They petitioned the police to apologise publicly, to release Chung Yik-tin, to stop \"an abuse of power\",[76] and also demanded the resignation of Commissioner Tang.[77] In the wake of the scandal, some citizens also became more concerned about the integrity of the law[78] and some citizens felt that some were more equal than others in Hong Kong.[77]\n\nAs a consequence of the scandal, Chen was pulled from the upcoming Stephen Fung movie Jump;[80] credit card company Manhattan Titanium withdrew all advertisements featuring Chen,[81] and Chen's appearance in The Dark Knight was downgraded to a cameo.[82] the LA Times reported that Pepsi China, Standard Chartered Bank, Samsung, Levi's and the Hong Kong Metro, had dropped Chen or declined to renew ad campaigns involving him.[83]\n\nOn 26 February 2008, the South China Morning Post, citing the Dalian Evening News, reported that Chung and Nicholas Tse (husband of Cecilia Cheung) had been dropped from the Beijing Olympics opening ceremony by artistic director Zhang Yimou.[95] Tse did appear at the closing ceremony, sharing the stage with Jackie Chan, Emil Chau, Andy Lau, and others.[96] Twins \"temporarily\" dissolved in late June 2008, four months after Gillian was caught up in the scandal.[97]\n\nInterviewed in an episode of TVB's Be My Guest in March 2009, Chung admitted she loved Chen, and let him take photos of them engaging in sex because she feared to lose him.[100][101] It was reported that Chung, under contract with Emperor Entertainment Group in 2008, did not receive any salary for the duration of the scandal,[102][103] and even struggled to pay rent.[103][104]\n\nAfter Chen's statement to court, Cheung broke silence in the matter on a televised interview on iCable on 27 February. She heavily criticised Chen for shedding crocodile tears, saying that he had not returned calls and had switched off his telephone when the incident came to light. She accused him of hypocrisy in a bid to win the public's forgiveness while hurting others caught up in the scandal.[105] She denied rumours of a rift with her husband and in-laws.[106]\n\nThe scandal shocked the general public and ignited debate about sexual morality. The blanket coverage of the local press, their reporting style, and the appearance of photographs has also been met with public complaints to TELA.[48][65] TELA suspected that at least two journals violated the Obscene Articles Ordinance, and sent copies of issue No. 936 of Next Magazine and issue No. 531 of the Oriental Sunday magazine to the OAT for classification.[110] The Tribunal returned an interim classification of \"Class I\", meaning the magazines were \"neither obscene nor indecent\", and TELA demanded a full public hearing to review its decision.[111] The OAT, the method of selecting its adjudicators, and the Obscene Articles Ordinance, came under fire. It reportedly classified Michelangelo's David as \"indecent\" by adhering rigidly to a definition.[112]\n\nChen's photos of Cheung, 34, surfaced more than a year into her marriage to actor Nicholas Tse, 34. A year after the scandal broke, she berated Chen in an interview. But in 2011, the year she split up with Tse, she reached out to Chen when she saw him on the plane. She was said to have asked to sit with him and taken selfies with him.\n\nSeven years after the scandal, Chung's career is still recovering. Her fellow Twins singer Charlene Choi has gone from strength and strength, and picked up a Hong Kong Film Award nomination for her new R-rated drama Sara.\n\nTwins are a Hong Kong Cantopop duo that was created in the summer of 2001 by Emperor Entertainment Group (EEG). Twins are made up of two girls, Charlene Choi (蔡卓妍) and Gillian Chung (鍾欣潼).[1] They are a popular group in Hong Kong and a top band in mainland China. Their fanbase have included Taiwan, Japan, Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia, Canada, Australia, United States, Vietnam and Philippines. Their music was generally targeted at young teens, but in 2004 they began to attract a wider audience by venturing into different styles of music. In February 2008 the duo temporarily separated after the Edison Chen photo scandal involving Gillian Chung.[2] The group reunited two years later in 2010.[3]\n\nIn early January 2008, Twins won two major awards at the 2007 Jade Solid Gold Top 10. They earned the most popular group award as well as the most popular Asia Pacific region female artist award.[13] That year, Twins released their third Mandarin and final album before their hiatus, titled Twins Language. The group was dragged into the fray when Gillian was involved in the Edison Chen photo scandal. Her private images were among those which found their way onto the internet at the end of February 2008. With Gillian deciding to duck out of the public eye, Twins announced its \"temporary dissolution\" in July 2008. Charlene said she was highly optimistic that they would reunite some day in the future.[2]\n\nThis is the first rumours of break-up since their debut 7 years ago. Ever since the sex-scandal incident broke out, Charlene Choi has been attending events by herself, including a prize presentation ceremony last night in which Twins won 3 prizes. She emphasized that these prizes were won by the two of them and that Gillian had put in as much as effort as she had.\n\nIf the Chinese people will not forgive these people in the scandal, then I guess we will never move forward. For crying out loud, the U.S. forgave Bill Clinton, the president of the United States! Sure it all leaves a bad taste. Clinton will forever be scorned, Paris Hilton may never get a real actress job. But they are not publicly condemned or killed off. It is just old news, old gossips. Can the Chinese people do the same?\n\nI am not saying that this scandal was innocent. It was kind of sleazy. But if their lives are forever destroyed without any second chances, then the U.S., Japanese, Europeans will think that the Chinese will never be a free-spirited country. Of course, we should have a moral code. But let the people decide, not the media, not the industry, not the government.\n\nGarg N; Inman JJ; Mittal V, 2017, 'Emotion effects on choice deferral: The moderating role of outcome and process accountability' European Journal of Marketing, vol. 51, pp. 1631 - 1649, -12-2015-0861\n\nSpiliopoulos L; Ortmann A; Zhang L, 2018, 'Complexity, attention, and choice in games under time constraints: A process analysis' Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning Memory and Cognition, vol. 44, pp. 1609 - 1640,"
