        "text": "2 Feb - While Ronald Cheng happily performed with ex-girlfriend Miriam Yeung together again on stage, the wish of fans who hoped to see him reunited with his ex-wife, Charlene Choi didn't come true.\n\nAs reported on Mingpao News, the singer, who spoke to the media at his post-party after the show seemed uncomfortable when asked about Charlene's absence.\n\nHe admitted that he is rarely in contact with the singer, and would see her father more often than Charlene herself.\n\nAs for Miriam, Ronald stated that he invited her because she previously sang a cover of his song, \"Close Your Eyes\" at a show.\n\nHe also admitted to have consulted his wife, former TV anchor Sammie Yu, before deciding on the guest.\n\n\"We greeted each other cordially. All of us have moved on, so it doesn't matter,\" he said.\n\nRonald and Charlene started dating after working together on the 2004 movie, \"Hidden Heroes\", and secretly tied the knot in 2006. Their secret marriage was exposed back in 2010 just as Charlene announced that the two of them are ending their relationship.\n\n(Photo Source: Ronald Cheng Instagram)"
