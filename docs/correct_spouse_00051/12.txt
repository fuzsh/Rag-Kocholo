Hong Kong singer-actor Ronald Cheng secretly married girlfriend Sammie Yu on July 22, 2011, 10 days after she gave birth to a baby girl, Hong Kong media reported on September 6, 2011.

The 38-year-old actor announced the news during a promotional event for his new film "Treasure Hunt" in Hong Kong, adding that he plans to hold a wedding banquet when their daughter turns one.

Cheng is very secretive about his personal life. He even kept his first marriage to Charlene Choi a secret until they divorced in March 2010.

Choi, Cheng's ex-wife and a Hong Kong singer, sent her greetings to him, saying she believes Cheng would be a good father. Choi is currently dating Hong Kong singer William Chan and says she too would like to have many children, but that the time was not right yet.
