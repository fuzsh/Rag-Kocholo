Still 4Up after 30 holes it appeared the Spaniard would win comfortably but a few loose shots and a lot of fight from Kent saw the match eventually go down the 18th for the second time. Ballester played this final hole superbly to win the hole and take the title.\n\nKent v. Ballester Match Play Final Scoreboard (Graphic: USGA)\n\nClick here to view the – 2024 U.S. Amateur Championship Match Play Results\n\nBallester, the 2023 European Amateur champion, who is coached by Victor Garcia, Sergio’s father, became the first Spanish champion.\n\nBy reaching the Final both players earned exemptions into next year’s Masters Tournament at Augusta National Golf Club and into the U.S. Open at Oakmont.\n\nBallester, the champion, also earned an exemption into The 2025 Open Championship at Royal Portrush Golf Club.\n\nNoah Kent and Jose Ballester (Photo: Chris Keane / USGA)\n\nME.\n\n___________________________________\n\nMatch Play – Semi-Finals\n\n19 year old Noah KENT (USA) ranked 560th in WAGR surprised Jackson BUCHANAN (USA), 22, ranked 17th in the first Semi-Final game, winning the tie by 2 Holes. Buchanan made four bogeys over the first six holes of their game which gave Kent all the encouragement he needed.\n\nThe all-Spanish affair between Jose Luis BALLESTER (ESP), 20, ranked 10th in WAGR, and Luis MASAVEU (ESP), 21, ranked 23rd went the way of Ballester. The Arizona State man scrambled superbly and over the 16 holes he required for victory recorded four birdies and no bogeys.\n\nAll four Semi-Finalists earned exemptions into the next two U.S. Amateur Championships which will be played at The Olympic Club in San Francisco and at Merion Golf Club in Ardmore.\n\nThe losing semi-finalists receive bronze medals for their efforts.\n\nSemi-Finals Results (Graphic: USGA)\n\nME.\n\n___________________________________\n\n16th August 2024\n\nMatch Play – Round 4 (Quarter Finals)\n\nNoah KENT (USA) made six birdies and an eagle on his way to beating Ethan FANG (USA) in the opening Quarter Final match. Showers during the morning had softened the course up making scoring a little easier.\n\nJackson BUCHANAN (USA) beat Jacob MODLESKI (USA) by 4&3 not needing to play all 18 holes for the first time in match play.\n\nJose Luis BALLESTER (ESP) eventually got the better of 36 year old Bobby MASSA (USA), a personal trainer from Texas, over the closing holes and was grateful for a 3&1 victory over the 2,969th WAGR ranked player.\n\nLuis MASAVEU (ESP) ensured there would be two Spanish players in the Semi-Finals by overcoming Brendan VALDES (USA) by 3&2 in the final Quarter Final tie. Masaveu fought back well from being 2Down after four holes.\n\nIt was the first time that two Spaniards had reached the Quarter Finals in the U.S. Amateur. Sergio Garcia reached the Semi-Finals in 1998.\n\nAll eight Quarter Finalists are exempt into the 125th U.S. Amateur Championship which will be played at The Olympic Club in San Francisco.\n\nQuarter Finals Results (Graphic: USGA)\n\nME.\n\n___________________________________\n\n15th August 2024 – Afternoon\n\nMatch Play – Round 3 (Last 16)\n\nThis morning’s conquerors of Calum Scott and James Ashfield, Omar MORALES (MEX), seeded 61st, and Phichaksn MAICHON (THA) 46, both lost in the Round of 16.\n\nJose Luis BALLESTER (ESP) and Luis MASAVEU (ESP) both played very well to continue their runs at the Championship.\n\nIn a game where neither player ever led by more than one hole Bobby MASSA (USA) birdied the 23rd (5th) from 25 feet to finally beat Ashton MCCULLOCH (CAN).\n\nHere are the Last 16 results: –\n\nRound of 16 Results (Graphic: USGA)\n\nME.\n\n___________________________________\n\n15th August 2024 – Morning\n\nMatch Play – Round 2 (32)\n\nHere are the Round of 32 results: –\n\nRound of 32 Results (Graphic: USGA)\n\nJackson BUCHANAN (USA), seeded 53rd, ended the hopes of WAGR No. 1 Luke CLANTON (USA) 21 with a narrow 1 Hole victory in the Round of 32.\n\nEuropean Amateur champion Tommy MORRISON (USA) 52 was also a casualty on Thursday morning, losing by 3&2 to Jacob MODLESKI (USA) 20 who led from the 2nd hole.\n\nWhilst GB&I interest ended in this round (see below) Bastian AMAT (FRA) 17, Jose Luis BALLESTER (ESP) 47 and Luis MASAVEU (ESP) 3 kept European fires burning with solid wins.\n\nDespite getting off to an excellent start which saw him 2Up after four holes Calum SCOTT (SCO) 36 succumbed to Omar MORALES (MEX) 61, a rising senior at UCLA 2023, by 3&2. Morales produced four birdies in a row from the 6th hole to completely turn the contest around. Scott immediately bounced back with two birdies of his own to tie the match up after 11 holes. However, two badly timed bogeys by the Nairn man on 12 and 13 handed back the initiative to the Mexican and ultimately proved to be insurmountable for him.\n\nMorales v.

The Nairn man battled back well after a slow start which saw him 2Down after both four and nine holes. A par 5 on the 3rd hole, second time around, finally got the job done with Scott taking the lead for the first time in the game.\n\nChirravuri v. Scott Match Play Round of 64 Scoreboard (Graphic: USGA)\n\nThe other remaining GB&I player, James ASHFIELD (WAL) 51, beat Matthew MANGANELLO (USA) 14, who has recently graduated from Fresno State University and is ranked 211th in WAGR, by 3&2. Like Calum Scott Ashfield got off to a poor start before consecutive birdies on 7, 8 and 9 enabled him to restore parity. Bogeys on 12 and 13 from the American handed the Welshman the advantage which he saw out comfortably.\n\nManganello v.

The R&A use a combined back nine count back approach to ties where two qualifying courses are used in their Championships.\n\nNiall SHIELS DONEGAN (SCO) produced one of the best rounds of the Stroke Play Qualifying competition, a 2-under 70 at Hazeltine National which included four birdies. Sadly he had left himself too much to do and missed out by 1-shot on the play-off.\n\nConnor GRAHAM (SCO) got off to a bad start at Hazeltine National in Round 2, dropping 3-shots in his opening four holes, but despite battling back well for a 75 missed out.\n\nRhode-Island based Bobby LEOPOLD (ENG) shot a 1-under 69 at Chaska Town Course but his +2 aggregate total always looked like being too high.\n\nIreland’s Matt MCCLEAN and Max KENNEDY, who both started the day tied 24th, will be disappointed to have missed out after making too many mistakes at Hazeltine National in Round 2.\n\nGB&I Stroke Play Qualifying Results (Graphic: USGA)\n\nClick here to view the – 2024 U.S. Amateur Championship Stroke Play Qualifying Results\n\nME.\n\n___________________________________\n\n12th August 2024\n\nStroke Play Qualifying – Round 1\n\nOn a perfect day for golf Paul CHANG (CHN), 23, and Tom FISCHER (USA), 20, both shot 6-under 64’s at Chaska Town Course to take the Round 1 lead in the Stroke Play Qualifying.\n\nOnly 19 of the 156 competitors beat the par of 72 at Hazeltine National G.C. in Round 1 whilst 63 of the other 156 did so at Chaska Town Course, which is nearly 700 yards shorter than it’s big brother.

It’s tough to win and we are going to celebrate.”\n\nGB&I captain Dean Robertson said “The result obviously didn’t go our way but I couldn’t have asked any more from my team in terms of preparation. On the week we were just beaten by a team that played better.”\n\nLuis MASAVEU (ESP) from the Continent of Europe was the only player to complete a 100% 4-from-4 record over the two days. Compatriot Pablo EREÑO PÉREZ was also undefeated, winning all three of the games he was selected for.\n\nGB&I’s Dominic CLEMONS (ENG) and Connor GRAHAM (SCO) won both of their Singles and finished the match with three wins in total.\n\nHere is an analysis of all of the individual performances from both sides: –\n\nClick here to view the – R&A St. Andrews Trophy Match Results\n\nThe Final Scoreboard (Graphic: The R&A / Golfbox)\n\nThe updated St Andrews Trophy match record now reads – 26 GB&I wins, 7 Continent of Europe wins with 1 draw.\n\nThe Continent of Europe will defend the trophy at Puerta De Hierro in Madrid, Spain next year as the biennial match moves to odd years.\n\nFriday PM Singles (9)\n\nContinent of Europe confirmed their victory over GB&I in style by taking the Day 2 Singles 7.0-2.0.\n\nFilip JACUBČIK (CZH) obtained revenge for his loss against James ASHFIELD (WAL) in yesterday’s Singles. Jakubčk again birdied the opening hole but this time proceeded to put together a very tidy round of golf which proved too much for the Welshman who in his defence did little wrong.\n\nJakubcik v. Ashfield Scores (Graphic: The R&A / Golfbox)\n\nDominic CLEMONS (ENG) beat the previously unbeaten Richard TEDER (EST) by 4&2 in Game 2 this afternoon. In a tight match the Englishman pulled away on the back nine with a string of birdies to complete an impressive debut for the GB&I team.\n\nTeder v. Clemons Scores (Graphic: The R&A / Golfbox)\n\nConnor GRAHAM (SCO) destroyed another unbeaten match record when he outclassed Tim WIEDEMEYER (GER) by 4&3 in their Day 2 Singles. Three birdies on the front nine set up the win which the Blairgowrie man saw out with comfort.\n\nWiedemeyer v. Graham C. Scores (Graphic: The R&A / Golfbox)\n\nLars Van Der VIGHT (NED) and Jack BIGHAM (ENG) were again drawn together in the Singles and as on Day 1 both played relatively poorly with way too many bogeys evident on the scorecard. The Dutchman ultimately won by 1 Hole and it seems appropriate that the 18th was halved in bogeys.\n\nVan Der Fight v. Bigham Scores (Graphic: The R&A / Golfbox)\n\nIn a high quality match Jerry JI (NED) edged out Charlie FORSTER (ENG) by 2&1. Forster again made some mistakes on the back nine which derailed any hopes he may have had of gaining his first point in the match.\n\nJi v. Forster Scores (Graphic: The R&A / Golfbox)\n\nBastian AMAT (FRA) just got the better of Seb CAVE (ENG) by 2 Holes. In a tight match Cave played well but will be rueing his inability to hole some putts and a a couple of mistakes on the back nine which handed the initiative to the Frenchman.\n\nAmat v. Cave Scores (Graphic: The R&A / Golfbox)\n\nSadly for Gregor GRAHAM (SCO) Jacob Skov OLESEN (DEN) finally turned up at Royal Porthcawl. The Amateur champion, who had lost all three of the games he had participated in up until this point, made a strong start to the match and thereafter refused to give Gregor any comeback encouragement.\n\nOlesen v. Graham G. Scores (Graphic: The R&A / Golfbox)\n\nThe steadier play of Pablo EREÑO PÉREZ (ESP) this afternoon enabled him to overcome Max KENNEDY (IRL) by 2&1. Despite coming to life towards the end of the game the Irishman simply made too many bogeys to threaten a victory for GB&I.\n\nEreño Pérez v. Kennedy (Graphic: The R&A / Golfbox)\n\nLuis MASAVEU (ESP) is a class act and ran out a 3&2 winner against Caolan RAFFERTY (IRL) who typically fought to the very end.\n\nMasaveu v.

Filip JACUBČIK (CZH) was again left out.\n\nDespite a 3.0-1.0 defeat in the Day 1 Foursomes GB&I captain Dean Robertson generally kept faith with his pairings. The only exception being Gregor GRAHAM (SCO) who replaced Seb CAVE (ENG) as Jack BIGHAM‘s (ENG) partner.\n\nTim WIEDEMEYER (GER) and Richard TEDER (EST) recorded their second Foursomes win of the contest in Game 1. They took control of the match against James ASHFIELD (WAL) and Connor GRAHAM (SCO), who were GB&I’s sole winners yesterday morning, with a run five birdies and six holes on the front nine.\n\nWiedemeyer & Teder v. Ashfield & Graham C. Scores (Graphic: The R&A / Golfbox)\n\nDominic CLEMONS (ENG) and Caolan RAFFERTY (IRL) recorded a welcome win for GB&I in Game 2 against the Dutch pair of Lars VAN DER VIGHT and Jerry JI. The Anglo-Irish pair played consistently well through out with four birdies ensuring the door remained firmly closed to their opponents.\n\nVan Der Fight & Ji v. Clemons & Rafferty Scores (Graphic: The R&A / Golfbox)\n\nFour birdies in the closing five holes from Jack BIGHAM (ENG) and Gregor GRAHAM (SCO) saw them secure a potentially critical 2 Holes win over Bastian AMAT (FRA) and Jacob Skov OLESEN (DEN). The GB&I pair needed seven birdies to win what was arguably the best game of the match so far.\n\nAmat & Olesen v. Bigham & Graham G. Scores (Graphic: The R&A / Golfbox)\n\nLuis MASAVEU and Pablo EREÑO PÉREZ pulled away from Max KENNEDY (IRL) and Charlie FORSTER (ENG) down the home stretch to secure a 3&2 win.

Ashfield got off to a poor start, bogeying the first three holes, but once he started to reel off the pars and sprinkle in a couple of birdies the game quickly turned in GB&I’s favour.\n\nJakubcik v. Ashfield Scores (Graphic: The R&A / Golfbox)\n\nThe repeat of the recent Amateur Championship Final saw Dominic CLEMONS (ENG) gain a modicum of revenge over Denmark’s Jacob Skov OLESEN with a 3&2 win in a game where they both played well.\n\nOlesen v. Clemons Scores (Graphic: The R&A / Golfbox)\n\nA six birdie blitz from Connor GRAHAM (SCO) proved too much for Bastian AMAT (FRA) who didn’t do too much wrong in his 2 Hole defeat and even enjoyed a hole-in-one on the short par 3 7th.\n\nAmat v. Graham C. Scores (Graphic: The R&A / Golfbox)\n\nGregor GRAHAM (SCO), who was rested in the Foursomes this morning, would have been hoping to send a message of defiance to his captain but could only present a disappointing 6&5 loss to Estonia’s Richard TEDER. After being given every encouragement in the opening holes by the out of sorts Scotsman Teder produced four birdies in the 13 holes he required for victory.\n\nTeder v. Graham G. Scores (Graphic: The R&A / Golfbox)\n\nBirdies on the 6th and 9th holes helped Tim WIEDEMEYER (GER) pull into the lead and when Charlie FORSTER lost his way on the back nine he soon ran out a 4&3 winner.\n\nWiedemeyer v. Forster Scores (Graphic: The R&A / Golfbox)\n\nGame 6 proved to be a very poor quality affair with both players struggling around Royal Porthcawl this afternoon. Jack BIGHAM (ENG) won’t care too much though as his 3&1 victory over Lars Van Der VIGHT (NED) was very welcome to a GB&I side on the comeback trail.\n\nVan Der Fight v. Bigham Scores (Graphic: The R&A / Golfbox)\n\nJerry JI (NED) and Caolan RAFFERTY (IRL) returned the standard of play to a more acceptable level with the Dutchman just keeping one step ahead of the experienced Irishman throughout a close contest.\n\nJi v. Rafferty Scores (Graphic: The R&A / Golfbox)\n\nCaptain Robertson will be disappointed that the final Singles game got away from Max KENNEDY (IRL) who was 1Up with four holes to play. Going into tomorrow tied at 6.0-6.0 or even down 6.5-5.5 would have meant the momentum was with his side after this morning’s Foursomes loss. However, Luis MASAVEU (ESP), fresh from The Open Championship is no mug, the closing holes at Porthcawl are no push over and in Kennedy’s defence he had played very well up until the 15th.\n\nMasaveu v. Kennedy Scores (Graphic: The R&A / Golfbox)\n\nSeb CAVE (ENG) and Pablo EREÑO PÉREZ (ESP) were respectively left out of the GB&I and European Singles teams when the draw was made last night.\n\n_____________________________________\n\nThursday AM Foursomes\n\nContinent of Europe won the Day 1 Foursomes series 3.0-1.0 to take the early lead against GB&I in the St. Andrews Trophy Match.\n\nDay 1 Morning Scoreboard (Graphic: The R&A / Golfbox)\n\nCaptain’s Dean Robertson and Carlos de Corral rested Gregor GRAHAM (SCO) and Filip JACUBČIK (CZH) from their opening Foursomes line-ups.\n\nThe GB&I pairings didn’t look a natural fit on paper last night and this largely proved to be the case on the course this morning.\n\nJames ASHFIELD (WAL) and Connor GRAHAM (SCO) didn’t have to work too hard to secure the first point of the match as the European pairing of Bastian AMAT (FRA) and Amateur champion Jacob Skov OLESEN (DEN) never got going.\n\nAmat & Olesen v.

I guess that’s something I’ll have forever, which is super cool.”\n\nJacob Skov Olesen (Photo: Oisin Keniry / R&A / R&A via Getty Images)\n\nHe beat Dominic CLEMONS (ENG), 22, WAGR #310, by 4&3 in the 36 hole Final staged on the Glashedy Course in dry but windy conditions.\n\nOleson, assisted on the bag by fellow Danish international Jamie Tofte Nielsen, played very steadily this morning finishing the morning session 2Up against the more inconsistent Clemons.\n\nThe critical period in the Final came early on in the afternoon round when Olesen won four holes in a row, the 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th. 6Up with 13 holes to play was always likely to prove too big a margin to recover for Clemons and this proved to be the case.\n\nThe experienced Olesen made few mistakes in the remaining holes and whilst there were moments of brilliance from the Englishman, most notably when he drove the 10th green and holed for eagle, the match came to a close on the 15th green.\n\n“I usually pride myself on playing my best golf when it matters and when the pressure is on, and I didn’t do that today. I didn’t play well enough to win, simple as that.” said a disappointed Clemons.\n\nMatch Play Final – Clemons v.

Having completed his U.S. college education it will be interesting to see whether he maintains his amateur status long enough to take up his U.S. Open invite next June.\n\nClemons will receive an invitation to compete in a future Challenge Tour event and will be exempt into Final Qualifying for the 2024 Open Championship.\n\nJacob Skov Olesen and Dominic Clemons (Photo: Oisin Keniry / R&A / R&A via Getty Images)\n\nME.\n\n_______________________________________\n\nFriday 21st June 2024 – Afternoon\n\nMatch Play – Semi-Finals (2 games)\n\nDominic CLEMONS, who has recently transferred from Stetson to Alabama on the U.S. College circuit, got the better of his English compatriot Jack BIGHAM by 1 Hole in a competitive opening Semi-Final.\n\nAfter a nervy start in difficult windy conditions both players only really settled over the closing six holes, producing some really impressive golf. They each had chances over these holes but with neither able to get their putts to drop it was Clemons who came out on top after refusing to make any mistakes.\n\nBigham was a tad unfortunate late on; his approach to the 15th hit the flag stick and spun back to 20 feet away when it had appeared it may have ended up in close proximity (a par save becoming a critical bogey) and then on 18 when his birdie putt lipped out.\n\nMatch Play Semi-Finals – Clemons v. Bigham (Graphic: The R&A / Golfbox)\n\nIn the Semi-Final between the two Championship debutants Jacob Skov OLESEN (DEN) deservedly beat Luke SAMPLE (USA) to become the first Danish player to reach the Final of The Amateur.\n\nThe left handed Dane, who has played for Texas Christian University and in his final year of eligibility for Arkansas in the States, was better able to control his ball in the strong winds playing some great irons down the stretch. Whilst he made a number of putts he also missed a few chances which could have brought the game to an earlier close.\n\nMatch Play Semi-Finals – Olesen v. Sample (Graphic: The R&A / Golfbox)\n\nThe two losing Semi-Finalists, Jack Bigham and Luke Sample, assuming they stay amateur, will receive an invitation to compete in a Challenge Tour event next season and will now be exempt into Final Qualifying for the 2024 Open Championship.\n\nME.\n\n_______________________________________\n\nFriday 21st June 2024 – Morning\n\nMatch Play – Quarter Finals (4 games)\n\nAll four Quarter Finals proved to be a real battle as they were played in strong winds and occasional squally showers at Ballyliffin G.C. All of the games required the full 18 holes and in the opening one two more.\n\nDominic CLEMONS (ENG), WAGR #310, got off to a great start with two opening birdies and could have gone 3Up on the 4th save for a poor three putt from 20 feet. However, Laurenz SCHIERGEN (GER), WAGR #2,054, fought back well and eventually took the lead on the 16th as Clemons struggled to get to grips with the conditions. After the 17th was halved Schiergen had a 2 foot putt for a par and a match win on the 18th. He sadly missed and Clemons seized on his good fortune after some good play over the two extra holes.\n\nMatch Play Quarter Final – Schiergen v. Clemons Scorecard (Graphic: The R&A / Golfbox)\n\nJack BIGHAM (ENG), WAGR #69, always looked to be one step ahead of his less experienced opponent Marcel FONSECA (ESP), WAGR #682, but found it hard to pull away from him. A clutch birdie putt on 17 brought the Spaniard level but problems on 18 saw him concede the match to the Englishman before he needed to putt.\n\nMatch Play Quarter Final – Bigham v. Fonseca Scorecard (Graphic: The R&A / Golfbox)\n\nCalum SCOTT (SCO), WAGR #28, will be disappointed to have lost his match against Denmark’s Jacob Skov OLESEN, WAGR #88, having been 2Up with four holes to play. Unfortunately the Nairn man lost is form badly over the last four holes opening the door for the Dane to walk through without having to do too much.\n\nMatch Play Quarter Final – Scott v. Olesen Scorecard (Graphic: The R&A / Golfbox)\n\nMatty DODD-BERRY (ENG), WAGR #211, came out on the wrong side of a competitive match against Luke SAMPLE (USA), WAGR #121. Dodd-Berry missed a short putt on the 17th which handed the initiative to the American who was then good enough to see the game out down the last.\n\nMatch Play Quarter Final – Schiergen v. Clemons Scorecard (Graphic: The R&A / Golfbox)\n\nThe four losing Quarter Finalists, on the basis they remain amateur, will have the consolation of earning exemptions into Final Qualifying for The 2024 Open.\n\nME.\n\n_______________________________________\n\nThursday 20th June 2024 – Afternoon\n\nMatch Play – Round 3 (8 games)\n\nLaurenz SCHIERGEN (GER) parred his way to victory against an up and down Charlie FORSTER (ENG) in a tight opening Last 16 game.\n\nDominic CLEMONS (ENG) earned a statement 4&3 win against James ASHFIELD (WAL). Three birdies in the opening six holes gave him a platform and with the Welshman clearly a little off his game this afternoon he was never put under any pressure as the bank nine unwound.\n\n20 year old Jack BIGHAM (ENG) built a 4Up lead after nine holes with some of his best golf of the Championship against Lev GRINBERG (UKR) and whilst there were a couple of missteps on the back nine I am sure he will be delighted with an energy conserving 5&4 victory.\n\nMarcel FONSECA (ESP), 19, made hard work of beating Gunnlauger Árni SVEINSSON (ISL); 3Up after 12 holes he stumbled a little before closing with three matched pars for a 1 Hole win.\n\nCalum SCOTT (SCO), with Gregor Graham on the bag, proved too strong for Dylan SHAW-RADFORD (ENG) down the stretch. Three consecutive hole wins on 13, 14 and 15, the latter two by way of birdies, saw him take a 3&2 win.\n\nIn a topsy-turvy Game 6, where neither player could gain any more than a one hole advantage it was left handed Jacob Skov OLESON (DEN) who overturned a 1Down with two to play margin to overcome Tom OSBORNE (ENG). Oleson birdied the 17th before Osborne conceded the match on the 20th hole.\n\nMatty DODD-BERRY‘s (ENG) consistency enabled him to get the better of giant American Tommy MORRISON (USA), who for the second year running lost in the Last 16. In a match he was never behind in the Cheshire star ultimately required a bogey from his opponent on the last to get over the line. Morrison recorded an eagle, three birdies but most importantly four bogeys in his round compared with Dodd-Berry’s four birdies and just a single bogey.\n\nLuke SAMPLE (USA) played 31 holes on the treacherous Glashedy Course today and had just two bogeys. Harry CROCKETT (ENG) simply couldn’t match this level of play this afternoon and fell to a 4&3 loss. Playing very tidily at the bottom of the draw the 121st WAGR-ranked American could well prove to be the surprise package at this year’s Championship.\n\nMatch Play Last 16 Result (Graphic: The R&A / Golfbox)\n\nME.\n\n_______________________________________\n\nThursday 20th June 2024 – Morning\n\nMatch Play – Round 2 (16 games)\n\nNine GB&I players, including six from England, were successful in the Round of 32.\n\nMatch Play Round 2 – Upper Half Results (Graphic: The R&A / Golfbox)\n\nLaurenz SCHIERGEN (GER) ended the hopes of medalist Connor GRAHAM (SCO) helped by winning birdies on the 4th, 6th, 11th and 12th holes. Laurenz has his Irish Kansas State University teammate Luke O’Neill, who missed the cut, on the bag.\n\nFour birdies from Charlie FORSTER (ENG), who didn’t drop a shot in the round, saw him easily close out the remaining home player Max KENNEDY (IRL) by 5&4.\n\nIn Game 3 Scottish Amateur Open champion Dominic CLEMONS (ENG) dropped two early shots to fall 2Down to Kent HSIAO (CTP) after five holes. However, a bogey from Hsiao on the 8th and a birdie from the Cambridgeshire player on the 9th turned the momentum around and set him on the path to a 2&1 win with par golf on the back nine.\n\nAfter both players made a fast start to this encounter it was the more experienced James ASHFIELD (WAL) who maintained his form to eventually pull away from Josh HILL (ENG).\n\nOscar LENT (ENG) will be wondering how he managed to lose Game 5 against Lev GRINBERG (UKR). Birdies on 1 and 5 saw the Walton Heath member initially move into a 3Up lead. Some sloppy play from both players around the turn then saw this lead extended to 4Up with six holes to play. At this point Grinberg settled whilst Lent was unable to turn his game around. A bogey on 18 and a concession on the 19th Hole disappointingly handed the game to the Ukrainian.\n\nJack BIGHAM (ENG) was 3Down after nine holes in his match against South Africa’s Jordan BURNAND, having bogeyed four of them. Given the season he’s had at Florida State few would have blamed him for wanting to go home but he showed real character to bounce back with birdies on 10, 11, 13 and 15 to completely turn his match around and win by 3&1.\n\nMarcel FONSECA (ESP) beat Markus VARJUN (FIN) 2&1 in a high quality encounter which saw the two players share seven birdies and make few mistakes.\n\nIn the Upper Half of the draw’s final game Gunnlauger Árni SVEINSSON (ISL), who yesterday signed for the LSU Men’s Golf team, got the better of Tim WIEDEMEYER with a 1 Hole victory after the German bogeyed both the 16th and 18th to throw away a 1Up lead with three holes to play.\n\nMatch Play Round 2 – Lower Half Results (Graphic: The R&A / Golfbox)\n\nA competitive match between Michael Alexander MJAASETH (DEN) and Dylan SHAW-RADFORD (ENG) finally went the way of the Englishman after he birdied their 2nd extra hole.\n\nAfter both players bogeyed the opening two holes it was Calum SCOTT (SCO) who pulled away from Seb CAVE (ENG) for a 5&4 win helped by par golf and birdies on the 4th, 6th and 10th holes.\n\nJacob Skov OLESON (DEN) beat Tomi BOWEN (WAL) by 3&2 in a poor quality match littered with bogeys.\n\nTom OSBORNE (ENG) and Nevill RUITER (NED) both started Game 12 nervously. Thankfully Osborne, who is enjoying a breakout season, birdied four of the holes on the back nine as play settled down to eventually take a 2&1 win.\n\nEngland’s Matty DODD-BERRY got off to a dream start with three birdies in his opening four holes to quickly move 3Up against last year’s Quarter-Finalist Richard TEDER (EST). Whilst Teder fought back well on the back nine to get to 1Down with four to play the Royal Liverpool man had enough in the tank to secure a 2&1 win.\n\nTommy MORRISON (USA) blew Kristian HJORT BRESSUM (DEN) away with eight birdies in the 15 holes they played on the Glashedy Course.\n\nEnglish pair Freddie TURNELL and Harry CROCKETT surprisingly only managed three pars between them in the opening six holes of Game 15. They made up for it afterwards with nine birdies seen in the remaining regulation holes, the most important one coming from Somerset’s Turnell who birdied the 18th to take the contest into extras. Crockett birdied the 3rd to take the win on the 21st Hole.\n\nLuke SAMPLE (USA), a rising senior at Duke who is playing links golf for the first time this week, continues to go from strength to strength. A great performance and a 3&2 win against Conor GOUGH (ENG) means he enters the Last 16 no longer under the radar.\n\nME.\n\n_______________________________________\n\nWednesday 19th June 2024\n\nMatch Play – Round 1 (32 games)\n\nPlay got under way on Ballyliffin’s Glashedy Course at 8.30am. The final game in Round 1 teed off at 1.19pm.\n\nConnor GRAHAM (SCO) fought back on the back nine, holing a 25 foot birdie putt on the home hole, to avoid the ‘curse of the medalist’ and secure a narrow 1 Hole victory over Mark STOCKDALE (ENG).\n\n22 year old Max KENNEDY (IRL) kept the home fires burning with a solid 3&2 win over France’s Oscar COUILLEAU.\n\nEngland’s Charlie FORSTER and Dominic CLEMONS required extra holes to beat Jose BALLESTER (ESP) and Niall SHIELS DONEGAN (SCO) respectively. Clemons holed lengthy putts on 17 and 18 to keep his game alive before seizing the initiative when they returned to the 1st Hole.\n\nJames ASHFIELD (WAL) earned an impressive 6&4 win against in form Harley SMITH (ENG) in their Battle of Britain encounter.\n\nThree more Englishmen, Josh HILL, Oscar LENT and Jack BIGHAM, were successful in the Upper Half of the draw. Hill enjoyed a narrow win over Nicklaus MASON (USA), Lent surprised the 2023 Asia-Pacific Amateur champion Jasper STUBBS (AUS) 6&4 and Bigham took out young Scotsman Sam MUKHERJEE by 3&1.\n\nMatch Play Round 1 – Upper Half Results (Graphic: The R&A / Golfbox)\n\nIn the Lower Half of the draw there were good wins for Dylan SHAW-RADFORD (ENG), Calum SCOTT (SCO), last week’s St. Andrews Links Trophy winner Seb CAVE (ENG), Tomi BOWEN (WAL), Tom OSBORNE (ENG), Matty DODD-BERRY (ENG), Freddie TURNELL (ENG), Harry CROCKETT (ENG) and Conor GOUGH (ENG).\n\nCave’s 1 Hole win against Albert HANSSON (SWE), who won the 2022 Boys’ Amateur Championship, Dodd-Berry’s 2&1 victory over South African Ben VAN WYK and Turnell’s 3&1 win against Daniel SVARD (SWE) were the most noteworthy, their three opponents all being ranked within the WAGR top 100.\n\nMatch Play Round 1 – Lower Half Results (Graphic: The R&A / Golfbox)\n\nThe template for a 64 player Match Play draw is as follows: –\n\nME.\n\n_______________________________________\n\nTuesday 18th June 2024\n\nStroke Play Qualifying Sudden Death Play-Off\n\nAll of the players were advised on their 1st tees today that should a Stroke Play Qualifying (SPQ) Play-Off be required to finalise the Match Play (MP) field it would be played tonight. The original Championship Schedule had indicated that it would take place on Wednesday morning before MP Round 1 but it now appears this was changed earlier this week, albeit The R&A were optimistically expecting to get any extra holes underway at 8.00pm.\n\nThe 19-for-18 spots sudden death play-off eventually commenced at 9.10pm. Three groups of 5 players and one group of 4 were asked to play the 1st on The Old Links and the 9th on the Glashedy Links, in rotation, to bring the SPQ to a conclusion.\n\nThankfully matters were resolved after just one hole had been completed and before the light had gone.\n\nBob VAN DER VOORT (NED), who went out in the first five ball, made life a little easier for everyone else by taking a 3-over 7 on The Old Links’ par 4 1st hole. With this news quickly filtering back to the tee the rest of the field were able to manage their play accordingly and the Dutchman was sent packing just after 10.00pm.\n\nPlay-Off Results (Photo: The R&A)\n\nME.\n\n_______________________________________\n\nTuesday 18th June 2024\n\nStroke Play Qualifying\n\nConnor Graham with The R&A’s John Miller (Photo: Oisin Keniry / R&A / R&A via Getty Images)\n\nRound 2\n\nConnor GRAHAM (SCO) earned medalist honours at the 129th Amateur Championship with a 136 (-7) total score. A 1-under 71 on the Glashedy Course, which included four birdies, was a good follow up to his positive start on The Old Links yesterday.\n\nConnor Graham’s SPQ Scorecard – Old Links (Graphic: The R&A / Golfbox)\n\nMichael MJAASETH (DEN) -4 earned the 2nd seeding with Ben VAN WYK (RSA), last year’s medalist, taking 3rd place on -3.\n\nVan Wyk produced the low round on the Glashedy Links on Day 2; after bogeying the 1st hole he produced an eagle and four birdies to post a 5-under 67.\n\nMatteo CRISTONI (ITA) bounced back well from a disappointing opening round to record the lowest score on The Old Links in Round 2. His 5-under 66 included six birdies and helped him comfortably make the match play cut.\n\nOn a cold and windy day in north west Ireland just 10 players out of the 288 starters finished the Stroke Play Qualifying competition with an under par score.\n\nPleasingly amongst these were GB&I’s Oscar LENT (ENG) -2, Eliot BAKER (ENG) -1, Freddie TURNELL (ENG) -1, Tomi BOWEN (WAL) -1, Dominic CLEMONS (ENG) -1, James ASHFIELD (WAL) -1 and Tom OSBORNE (ENG) -1.\n\nTo the disappointment of the home crowd Max KENNEDY Ev and Seán KEELING +2 were the only Irish players to advance out of their 28 starters.\n\nThe average score in Round 2 on the Glashedy Course was 77.45 (+5.45) (Rd 1: 77.17) whilst on The Old Links it was 74.92 (+3.92) (Rd 1: 73.01).\n\n65 players finished on 146 (+3) or better, 19 of these on the +3 score itself. With 64 competitors required for the Match Play Stage a 19-for-18 spots sudden death play-off was required (see above).\n\nOne of the 19 players required to stay on for the night shift was Jose BALLESTER (ESP) who started the day in 2nd place. Amazingly he birdied his final three holes to post an 8-over 80 on the Glashedy Course, eventually scrapping in on the +3 mark.\n\nHere are the Stroke Play Qualifying results (leading players only): –\n\nStroke Play Qualifying Results (Graphic: The R&A / Golfbox)\n\nNotable players to miss out on Match Play were Christiaan MAAS (RSA) +4, Hugh FOLEY (IRL) +5, Kris KIM (ENG) +5, Matt MCCLEAN (IRL) +6, Luis MASAVEU (ESP) +6, Cameron ADAM (SCO) +6, Liam NOLAN (IRL) +6, Altin VAN DER MERWE (RSA) +6, Gregor GRAHAM (SCO) +8, Tyler WEAVER (ENG) +8, Gregor TAIT (SCO) +10 and Matt ROBERTS (WAL) +13.\n\nClick here to view the – 2024 Amateur Championship SPQ Results\n\nME.\n\n_______________________________________\n\nMonday 17th June 2024\n\nStroke Play Qualifying\n\nRound 1\n\nConnor GRAHAM (SCO), who teed off at 7.51am, leads the Stroke Play Qualifying Stage of the 2024 Amateur Championship after he produced a 6-under 65 on Ballyliffin’s The Old Links course (OL).\n\nFive birdies in the closing six holes of his front nine set up his round. His great score will have done the 17 year old Scotsman’s confidence the world of good as has missed most of the 2024 season due to a stress fracture in his hand.\n\nConnor Graham’s Round 1 Scorecard – Old Links (Graphic: The R&A / Golfbox)\n\nOverseas entrants Jose BALLESTER (ESP), -5 OL, is 2nd and Michael MJAASETH (DEN) & Sergio JIMENEZ (ESP), both -4 OL, tied 3rd.\n\nGB&I’s Charlie FORSTER (ENG), Harry CROCKETT (ENG), Harley SMITH (ENG) and James ASHFIELD (WAL), all -3 OL, and Cameron ADAM (SCO), -2 OL, joined Graham in the top 10 after the opening round. Max KENNEDY and Seán KEELING, -1 OL, are the best placed Irish players.\n\n33 players finished the opening day under par with all but three of those rounds taking place on the easier Old Links Course.\n\nBob VAN DER VOORT (NED), who teed off in one of the opening groups at 6.45am, recorded the lowest score on the Glashedy Course (G). His 2-under 70 included an eagle and two birdies.\n\nBob Van Der Voort’s Round 1 Scorecard – Glashedy (Graphic: The R&A / Golfbox)\n\nSouth African’s Jack BUCHANAN and Jordan BURNAND were the only other players to break par around the Glashedy. They both finished with 1-under 70’s.\n\nCooper SCHULTZ (USA) didn’t get off to the best of starts on the Glashedy Course (+5) but at least had the consolation of recording a hole-in-one on the 168 yard par 3 7th.\n\nCooper Schultz’s Round 1 Scorecard – Glashedy (Graphic: The R&A / Golfbox)\n\nThe average score in Round 1 on the Glashedy Course was 77.17 (+5.17) whilst on The Old Links it was 73.01 (+2.01). In other words there is still a lot of golf to be played in this Qualifying Stage, particularly for those players down the leaderboard but now moving over to The Old Links course.\n\nHere are the leading Stroke Play Qualifying scores at the end of Round 1: –\n\nRound 1 Leaderboard (Graphic: The R&A / Golfbox)\n\nReserves Patrick KEELING (IRL) 1st, Conor BYRNE (IRL) 2nd and Ben BROOKES (ENG) 3rd were called up to the field following the late withdrawals of Jye HALLS (AUS), Attieh KHALED (KSA) and Nels SURTANI (USA) over the weekend. Therefore 41 players who competed in Friday’s 72-man Pre-Qualifying event made the final Championship field.\n\nME.\n\n_______________________________________\n\nFriday 14th June 2024\n\nPre-Qualifying (PQ)\n\nPQ Results\n\nKeith EGAN (IRL) earned medalist honours at the PQ event with a 69 (-2) score around The Old Links at Ballyliffin.\n\nSam MUKHERJEE (SCO) -1 was the only other player in the field of 72 players to break par.\n\nWith 38 spots available a 13-for-3 sudden death play off was required to finalise the Championship’s 288 player field. These 13 men all finished with 75 ‘s (+4). Charlie DAUGHTREY (ENG), Cian O’CONNOR (IRL) and Kipp POPERT (ENG) were the three successful players.\n\nIt is worth remembering that any further withdrawals before the Championship commences next Monday will see the highest finishing PQ players on a card count back basis rather than by reference to the play-off results called upon. This means that Patrick KEELING (IRL) is now 1st Reserve, Conor BYRNE (IRL) 2nd Reserve, Ben BROOKES (ENG) 3rd Reserve and Max SHIRVELL (ENG) 4th Reserve.\n\nHere are the full Pre-Qualifying Results: –\n\nPre-Qualifying Results (Graphic: The R&A / Golfbox Scoring)\n\n(Q) = Qualified\n\nRed Box = Players involved in the 13-for-3 play-off.\n\nClick here to view the – 2024 Amateur Championship Pre-Qualifying Results\n\nPQ Background\n\nThe R&A ran a PQ event for the third time to offer some of the players not allocated an original place in the field an opportunity to earn one.\n\nThe R&A again limited the PQ field to 72 players with the event played over 18 holes of stroke play on The Old Links course at Ballyliffin.\n\nThis field was made up of the 15 highest ranked WAGR players (who sit between 1,500th – 1,796th) not originally accepted into the Championship field followed by a lowest handicap ballot for the remainder.\n\nThe number of spots available rose from the guaranteed 10 to 38. This is because 28 players withdrew from the original Championship line-up before the PQ had been played (288-278+28).\n\nAmongst this 28 were (in alphabetical order with entry WAGRs) Paul BEAUVY (FRA) #440, Ben BROWN (ENG) #1044, Luke CLANTON (USA) #8, James CLARIDGE (ENG) #199, Paul CONROY (IRL) #293, Charlie CROCKETT (ENG) #135, Wenyi DING (CHN) #6, Nicola GERHARDSEN (SUI) #236, James NASH (WAL) #940, Joe PAGDIN (ENG) #1201, Luke POULTER (ENG) #394, Luke POTTER (USA) #61, Carl SIEMENS (GER) #502, Hiroshi TAI (SNP) #70 and Keaton VE (USA) #209.\n\nME.\n\n_______________________________________\n\n8th June 2024 (Updated 13th June 2024)\n\nChampionship Preview\n\nThe 129th Amateur Championship will be played at Ballyliffin G.C. in County Donegal, Ireland on 17th-22nd June 2024.\n\nThe Amateur is the most prestigious amateur golf event played outside of the United States and the highlight of the Great British and Irish (GB&I) amateur season.\n\nI will be updating this article as more information becomes available and providing daily reports throughout the Championship.\n\nThe Amateur Championship Trophy (Photo: The Nairn G.C.)\n\nChampionship Format\n\nStroke Play Qualifying\n\nTwo rounds of stroke play will be completed on Monday 17th June and Tuesday 18th June to determine a match play field.\n\nEach contestant will play 18 holes around Ballyliffin’s Glashedy Links and The Old Links courses with three-ball tee times between 6.45am and 3.37pm on both days.\n\nThe 64 lowest scores will advance to the match play stage.\n\nIn a decision that I applaud The R&A are going to use a sudden death play-off this year to break ties for the last qualifying place. Previous year’s have generally seen all ties advance to the match play stage with a Preliminary Round then having to be played.\n\nTies for all other match play seedings are resolved by reference to the combined back nines (then six, three and one) from each course.\n\nMatch Play Stage\n\nThe Match Play stage will be contested between Wednesday 19th and Saturday 22nd June solely on the Glashedy Links course.\n\nEach match will consist of one round of 18 holes except the Final which will be played over 36 holes. Any tied matches will continue into sudden death extra holes to determine a winner.\n\nField\n\nNB. All WAGR’s quoted below were at the close of entries on 23rd May 2024\n\n288 male amateur golfers from 42 countries will contest the Championship.\n\n278 competitors were offered places in the Championship when entries closed on 25th May 2023. These players were drawn from 1) a number of exempt categories covering various historic Championship performances and representative team selections and 2) allocated to those highest ranked players 1st-2,000th in the WAGR as at Week 20 2023 (i.e. the Wednesday 17th May release), and then via WHS Handicap index at the date of entry.\n\nAt entry players were offered the opportunity to play in a Pre-Qualifying (PQ) event, should they not make the initial line-up, for which the remaining 10 spots were originally allocated. This will be played on 14th June 2024 (see above).\n\nThere are 5 players from the WAGR top 50, 19 from the top 100, 46 from the top 250, 89 from the top 500 and 184 from the top 1000 competing this year.\n\nThe 2023 champion Christo LAMPRECHT (RSA) turned pro in early June, surprisingly foregoing his exemption into the 2024 U.S. Open Championship being played at Pinehurst Golf Resort.\n\nClick here to view the full – 2024 Amateur Championship Terms of Competition\n\nBallyliffin G.C.

It becomes the 23rd to do so.\n\nBallyliffin – Glashedy Links\n\n7,314 yards (Amateur) / Par 72 / Slope Rating 136 (Black) / Course Rating 77.4 (Black)\n\nThe Glashedy Course, named after the nearby Glashedy Rock, was designed by Tom Craddock & Pat Ruddy and opened for play in 1995.\n\nThe course sits in magnificent sand dunes. The fairways were flattened out to make them fairer but the deep revetted bunkers and large and undulating greens are challenging.\n\nThe course has previously staged the 2016 Boys’ Home Internationals, the 2018 Irish Open Championship, which was won by Scotland’s Russell Knox, and the 2022 R&A Women’s and Men’s Home Internationals.\n\nBallyliffin G.C.

Pat Ruddy made some improvements, including building a new 7th, 8th, 13th and 15th holes, when he was on site with the Glashedy. Nick Faldo Design added new revetted bunkers and back tees to the course in 2004.\n\nBeing the original course on this large site means it has the benefit of taking in the picturesque coastal land for four of its closing holes.\n\nSchedule\n\nThe R&A have laid out the following provisional schedule for the Championship: –\n\n2024 Amateur Championship Schedule (Graphic: The R&A)\n\nWeather Forecast\n\nCool and showery weather is forecast with winds gusting to 25mph at times.\n\nClick here to view the – Latest MET Éireann Weather Forecast for Ballyliffin\n\nTee times between 7.00am and 3.52pm mean that any changes in the weather during the opening two days can have a material impact on the stroke play qualifying competition.\n\nPrizes / Exemptions\n\nA momento (a framed championship flag) is presented by The R&A to the leading player in the stroke play qualifying competition, with any ties for this prize decided on the lowest aggregate score for the second nine holes on both courses (or the last six or three or one if necessary).\n\nThe winner of the match play stage will become the Amateur Champion receiving the Championship Trophy and a Gold Medal.\n\nThe runner-up receives a Silver Medal and each losing semi-finalist a Bronze Medal.\n\nThe winner of The Amateur Championship, on the basis they remain an amateur, will receive the following exemptions / invitations into: –\n\na) the 152nd Open Championship at Royal Troon G.C., Scotland on 18-21 July 2024;\n\nb) the 2025 Masters Tournament at Augusta National G.C., Georgia on 10-13 April 2025;\n\nc) the 2025 U.S. Open Championship at Oakmont C.C., Pennsylvania on 12-15 June 2025; and\n\nd) a DP World Tour event.\n\nThe Runner-Up and two losing Semi-Finalists, on the basis they are still an amateur, will receive an invitation to compete in a Challenge Tour event and will be exempt into Final Qualifying for the 2024 Open Championship.\n\nThe losing Quarter Finalists, on the basis they are still an amateur, will also receive exemptions into Final Qualifying for The Open.\n\nThe Open Championship Amateur Series Winner\n\nFor the second year running The R&A will be running The Open Championship Amateur Series.\n\nThe player who gains the most WAGR points in the 2024 St. Andrews Links Trophy (won by England’s Seb Cave), Amateur Championship and European Amateur Championship will earn an exemption into the forthcoming Open at Royal Troon G.C.\n\n2024 St. Andrews Trophy\n\nShould a Great Britain & Ireland player win the Amateur Championship they are guaranteed a place on the GB&I St. Andrews Trophy team for the match against Continent of Europe being played on 24th-225th July at Royal Porthcawl G.C.\n\nMore Information\n\nClick here to view the – R&A Amateur Championship Official Website\n\nThe latter stages of the match play will be live streamed on The R&A You Tube channel.\n\n2023 Amateur Championship\n\nMatch Play Stage\n\nChristo LAMPRECHT (RSA), who was 22 at the time, won the 128th Amateur Championship at a sun-drenched Hillside G.C., beating Ronan KLEU (SUI), 23, 3&2 in the 36 hole Final.\n\nRonan Kleu and Christo Lamprecht (Photo: Octavio Passos / R&A / R&A via Getty Images)\n\nFellow South African player Christiaan Maas achieved a notable double too.

Allan Macfie (SCO) was the first champion beating Horace Hutchinson (ENG) 7&6 in the Final.\n\nUp until the Second World War it was a hugely prestigious event and in many of these early years was afforded a much higher standing in the game than The Open Championship. Players like Johnny Ball (ENG), Harold Hilton (ENG) and Freddie Tait (SCO) were all amateurs and as good if not better than most of the professionals of the day.\n\nWith only modest rewards available in the professional game many of the better players simply stayed amateur. The great American Bobby Jones, who won The Amateur in 1930 on the way to his Grand Slam, remains the most well known career amateur.\n\nEven after the war players remained amateur for much longer and famous names like Frank Stranahan (USA), Joe Carr (IRE), Sir Michael Bonallack (ENG) and Peter McEvoy (ENG) all built their reputations on Amateur Championship wins.\n\nWith the growth and transformation of the professional game from the early 1980s onwards both the better players and the media increasingly started to turn their backs on the amateur game.\n\nSave for exceptional cases like Gary Wolstenholme (ENG) all continuity has been lost over the last 30 years and most of the young golfing stars of today rarely play any more than 2 or 3 Amateurs before being lured into the pro ranks by the potentially huge rewards on offer.\n\nPast Winners\n\nThe greatest player in the history of The Amateur is Johnny Ball. The Hoylake man won the Championship a record 8 times between 1888 and 1912.\n\nOnly three other players have won the competition more than twice; Sir Michael Bonallack (5), Harold Hilton (4) and Joe Carr (3). Bonallack amazingly won it three years in a row between 1968-1970. The last person to retain The Amateur was Peter McEvoy in 1977 and ’78.\n\nPrior to Christo Lamprecht’s win in 2023 the previous 10 winners of The Amateur Championship were: –\n\n2022 Aldrich Potgieter (RSA) – Royal Lytham and St. Annes G.C.\n\n2021 Laird Shepherd (ENG) – Nairn G.C.\n\n2020 Joe Long (ENG) – Royal Birkdale G.C.\n\n2019 James Sugrue (IRL) – Portmarnock G.C.\n\n2018 Jovan Rebula (RSA) – Royal Aberdeen G.C.\n\n2017 Harry Ellis (ENG) – Royal St. George’s G.C.\n\n2016 Scott Gregory (ENG) – Royal Porthcawl G.C.\n\n2015 Romain Langasque (FRA) – Carnoustie G.C.\n\n2014 Bradley Neil (SCO) – Royal Portrush G.C.\n\n2013 Garrick Porteous (ENG) – Royal Cinque Ports G.C.\n\nA great achievement and honour for all of the players listed above. However, looking through the names reminds us of how incredibly tough golf is and that wins in the biggest amateur events are no guarantee of success in the professional game.\n\nClick here to view a complete list of – Past Amateur Championship Winners\n\nClick here to view a complete list of – Past Amateur Stroke Play Qualifying Medalists\n\nME.\n\nCopyright © 2014-2024, Mark Eley.

All rights reserved.\n\nSaturday 24th June 2023\n\nChristo LAMPRECHT (RSA), who is 22, won the 128th Amateur Championship at a sun-drenched Hillside G.C., beating Ronan KLEU (SUI), 23, 3&2 in the 36 hole Final.\n\nAs the lowest WAGR-ranked player in the field of 288 players and one of the obvious pre-Championship favourites Lamprecht (#6) did remarkably well to finish top of the pile.\n\nKleu, who is ranked 376th, will be disappointed not to have played a little better in the Final but a runner-up result and a third place seeding after the Stroke Play Qualifying represents an excellent week’s work for him and a real boost for golf in Switzerland.\n\nRonan Kleu and Christo Lamprecht (Photo: Octavio Passos / R&A / R&A via Getty Images)\n\nFour birdies in the opening nine holes helped Kleu take an early 2Up lead but Lamprecht fought back strongly with a string of birdies to close out the opening 18 holes and turn the match around.\n\nHeading into the afternoon session with a 2Up lead the giant South African never really looked like he would be caught as he continued to overpower the course with his driver off the tee.\n\nTo Kleu’s credit he finally started to apply some pressure when all seemed to be lost, producing some world class recoveries and finally holing a few putts.\n\nHowever, the Georgia Tech student wasn’t to be denied and with a great pitch on 15 for birdie and solid long two putt for par on 16 the title was his.\n\nFellow South African player Christiaan Maas achieved a notable double too. Last year he missed the Match Play Stage cut and caddied for the eventual champion Aldrich Potgieter. This year the same thing happened and he picked up Lamprecht’s bag and ended up again helping a teammate to victory.\n\nIt was the third South African winner in the last 6 years; Jovan Rebula also won at Royal Aberdeen in 2018.\n\nTalking to The R&A afterwards he said “I’m over the moon. I haven’t won something big in a long time and it’s one to definitely win for sure. I’m ecstatic. I cannot kind of comprehend my feelings right now. I’m guessing South Africans like playing links golf. We kind of like being creative so I guessed that flowed over into this Championship. It’s always nice to be part of history with South Africa and enrich it.”\n\nChristo Lamprecht v. Ronan Kleu Final Results (Graphic: The R&A / GolfBox)\n\nWith his win Lamprecht secured exemptions into The 151st Open Championship at Royal Liverpool G.C., the 2024 Masters Tournament at Augusta National G.C. and the 2024 U.S. Open Championship at Pinehurst No.2.\n\nThe 129th Amateur Championship will be played at Ballyliffin G.C. in County Donegal, Ireland on 17th-22nd June 2024.\n\nClick here to view the – Match Play Draw / Scores\n\nME.\n\n___________________________________\n\nFriday 23rd June 2023\n\nMatch Play Stage – Semi-Finals (4)\n\nPerhaps unsurprisingly after his superb scoring and putting this morning TK CHANTANANUWAT (THA) was a bit flat this afternoon and certainly not as effective on the greens. Ronan KLEU (SUI) took advantage with an outstanding performance which included five birdies in the 12 holes completed at Hillside G.C.\n\nIn a long week of golf Kleu will be pleased to get through today playing just 26 holes. He will now be hoping that the second semi-final becomes a drawn out affair.\n\nTK Chantananuwat v. Ronan Kleu Semi-Final Results (Graphic: The R&A / GolfBox)\n\nIn a remarkable comeback Christo LAMPRECHT (RSA) fought back from 2Down with three holes to play to beat Frank KENNEDY (ENG) by 1 Hole on the 18th. It was hard on the Englishman who had played beautifully for most of the round and who has enjoyed great Championship. The Florida-based Kennedy will rue a clumsy putt from off the 16th green when he appeared to be on the verge of victory and a poor approach on the 18th which left him short-sided in a green side bunker. However, Lamprecht applied pressure just at the right time, finishing the round magnificently with a great up and down on 16, an eagle on 17 and a tap in par on the home hole.\n\nFrank Kennedy v. Christo Lamprecht Semi-Final Results (Graphic: The R&A / GolfBox)\n\nClick here to view the – Match Play Draw / Scores\n\nMatch Play Stage – Quarter Finals (8)\n\nYou could have got very good odds on Switzerland being the most represented nation in the Quarter Finals at the start of this week. Well done to Max SCHLIESING and Ronan KLEU for flying the Swiss flag so proudly at The Amateur Championship.\n\nMax SCHLIESING performed very well in the opening Quarter Final but despite dropping no shots and recording six birdies fell to an inspired TK CHANTANANUWAT. Nine birdies including three over the closing three holes at Hillside G.C. represented a superb effort, under pressure, from the Thai star.\n\nMax Schliesing v. TK Chantananuwat Quarter Final Results (Graphic: The R&A / GolfBox)\n\nSchliesing’s compatriot Ronan KLEU fared better in his game against Tobias JONSSON (SWE). Kleu started well but it was Jonsson’s collapse on the back nine that ultimately handed him a comfortable victory.\n\nRonan Kleu v. Tobias Jonsson Quarter Final Results (Graphic: The R&A / GolfBox)\n\nThe clash between two of our most in form players, Alex MAGUIRE (IRL) and Frank KENNEDY (ENG), was the highlight of the Quarter Finals from a GB&I perspective. Frank KENNEDY (ENG) won the game 3&2 with his steadier play. Given the performances and victories that Maguire has delivered in recent weeks it is perhaps no surprise that he tired a little coming down the stretch this morning.\n\nAlex Maguire v. Frank Kennedy Quarter Final Results (Graphic: The R&A / GolfBox)\n\nChristo LAMPRECHT (RSA) went on his own birdie blitz to steam roller Richard TEDER (EST) who made few mistakes but simply couldn’t live with Lamprecht’s consistency and quality. Christiaan Maas, who caddied for last year’s champion Aldrich Potgieter, remains on course for a unique double having picked up Christo’s bag since his surprise early exit at the Stroke Play Qualifying stage.\n\nChristo Lamprecht v.

Max Schliesing Round 4 Results (Graphic: The R&A / GolfBox)\n\nTH CHANTANANUWAT (THA) looks to have played a superb 16 holes of golf to see off Will HOPKINS by 3&2 after the Englishman had shocked him with a birdie-birdie start to go 2Up after two holes.\n\nTK Chantananuwat v. Will Hopkins Round 4 Results (Graphic: The R&A / GolfBox)\n\nRonan KLEU (SUI), who by way of reminder, shot the low round (64 -8) at Hillside in the Stroke Play Qualifying, continues to excel although Clément CHARMASSON (FRA) handed him the initiative this afternoon with some loose play on the opening nine.\n\nRonan Kleu v. Clément Charmasson Round 4 Results (Graphic: The R&A / GolfBox)\n\nAfter a slow start Tobias JONSSON (SWE) quickly found his form and after three late birdies got the better of Australia’s Josh GREER in a tight game.\n\nJoshua Greer v. Tobias Jonsson Round 4 Results (Graphic: The R&A / GolfBox)\n\nIreland’s Alex MAGUIRE must surely have secured his GB&I Walker Cup team selection with this dramatic victory over Daniel RODRIGUES (POR). 1Down with two holes to play he birdied the par 5 17th hole to take the match in to overtime. Two more birdies on par 5’s saw Maguire secure victory on the 5th extra hole.\n\nAlex Maguire v. Daniel Rodrigues Round 4 Results (Graphic: The R&A / GolfBox)\n\nMarc BOUCHER (IRL) and Frank KENNEDY enjoyed an exciting rollercoaster of a match which the Englishman, winner of the Lytham Trophy earlier this year, came out on top in despite some nervous play from both players down the 18th.\n\nMarc Boucher v. Frank Kennedy Round 4 Results (Graphic: The R&A / GolfBox)\n\nSouth Africa’s Christo LAMPRECHT was made to play his best golf to overcome Adam WALLIN (SWE), who clearly did very little wrong in the 17 holes that were played.\n\nAdam Wallin v. Christo Lamprecht Round 4 Results (Graphic: The R&A / GolfBox)\n\nRichard TEDER (EST) and Tommy MORRISON (USA) played out a high quality encounter at the back of the Last 16 field with three of the opening eleven holes halved in birdie 4’s. The Estonian finally picked up the win with a par on the first hole as they started out again.\n\nTommy Morrison v.
