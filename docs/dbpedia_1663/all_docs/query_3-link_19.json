        "text": "Below is a format summary and rules explainer for Emirates NBA Cup 2024. For more information, read the NBA Cup FAQ article.\n\nI. Summary\n\nThe Emirates NBA Cup 2024, the NBA’s second annual in-season competition, will tip off on Tuesday, Nov. 12 in team markets and culminate with the Semifinals (Saturday, Dec. 14) and Championship (Tuesday, Dec. 17) taking place at T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas. The complete schedule will be released in August.\n\nThe Emirates NBA Cup will consist of two stages: Group Play and the Knockout Rounds.\n\n> A. Group Play\n\nAll 30 teams have been randomly drawn into groups of five within their conference based on win-loss records from the 2023-24 regular season. Beginning Tuesday, Nov. 12 and continuing through Tuesday, Dec. 3, each team will play four designated Group Play games on “Cup Nights” – one game against each opponent in its group, with two games at home and two on the road.\n\n> B. Knockout Rounds\n\nEight teams will advance to the Knockout Rounds: the team with the best standing in Group Play games in each of the six groups and two “wild cards” (the team from each conference with the best record in Group Play games that finished second in its group). The Knockout Rounds will consist of single-elimination games in the Quarterfinals (played in NBA team markets on Tuesday, Dec. 10 and Wednesday, Dec. 11) and Semifinals and Championship (played in Las Vegas on Dec. 14 and Dec. 17, respectively). The Knockout teams will compete for a prize pool and the NBA Cup championship trophy.\n\nAll 67 games across both stages of the Emirates NBA Cup will count toward the regular-season standings except the Championship. Each team will continue to play 82 regular-season games in the 2024-25 season, including those games that are part of Group Play and the Knockout Rounds.\n\nFourteen games in Group Play (two games on each Cup Night) and all seven games in the Knockout Rounds will be televised nationally. The game and broadcast schedules for the Emirates NBA Cup Group Play stage will be announced in August.\n\nMore details about the Emirates NBA Cup are below.\n\nII. Tournament Detail\n\n> A. Group Play Draw\n\nTo determine each team’s opponents in the Group Play games, the 15 teams in each conference were divided into three groups of five teams via a random drawing. The six groups were unveiled by ESPN on Friday, July 12.\n\nBefore the drawing, each team was placed into a “pot” based on its record from the prior regular season (2023-24). In each conference, one team from each pot was randomly selected into each of the three groups in that conference. The pots were as follows:\n\n• Pot 1: The teams with the three best prior-season records in a conference.\n\n• Pot 2: The teams with the fourth- through sixth-best prior-season records.\n\n• Pot 3: The teams with the seventh- through ninth-best prior-season records.\n\n• Pot 4: The teams with the 10th-through 12th-best prior-season records.\n\n• Pot 5: The teams with the 13th-through 15th-best prior-season records.\n\n> B. Group Play\n\n“Cup Nights” will take place every Tuesday and Friday from Nov. 12 – Dec. 3. The only NBA games played on Cup Nights will be Group Play games. Group Play games will count as regular-season-games for all purposes.\n\nA team will play each of the other four teams in its group in one Group Play game. A team’s record in these four intraconference games will determine whether the team qualifies for the Knockout Rounds.\n\nIn the event two or more teams are tied within a group, the tie among the teams will be broken according to the following tiebreakers (in sequential order):\n\n• Head-to-head record in Group Play;\n\n• Point differential in Group Play; ^^\n\n• Total points scored in Group Play; ^^\n\n• Record from the 2023-24 NBA regular season; and\n\n• Random drawing (in the unlikely scenario that two or more teams are still tied following the previous tiebreakers).\n\n^^ Overtime scoring will not count towards the point differential and total points tiebreakers in the Emirates NBA Cup. A team’s point differential will be “0” in Group Play games that go to overtime, and a team’s total points scored will exclude points scored in overtime.\n\nEight teams will advance to the Knockout Rounds: the team with the best standing in Group Play games in each of the six groups and one wild card team from each conference. The wild card will be the team from each conference with the best record in Group Play games that finished second in its group.\n\nIn the event two or more teams are tied for the wild card in a conference, the tie among the teams will be broken following the same tiebreaker protocol as described above (with the exception of the head-to-head record in Group Play). Ties within groups will be broken before the calculation of wild card tiebreakers.\n\n> C. Knockout Rounds\n\nThe Knockout Rounds will consist of single-elimination games for the eight teams that advance from Group Play, beginning with the Quarterfinals on Dec. 10-11. Teams that win will progress to the neutral-site Semifinals on Dec. 14, and then the Championship on Dec. 17.\n\nGames played in the first and second rounds of the Knockout Rounds (i.e., Quarterfinals and Semifinals, respectively) will count as regular-season-games for all purposes. The Championship will not be counted as a regular-season game, meaning that the game will not count toward a team’s regular-season record, and a player’s or team’s performance will not count toward regular-season statistics.\n\nIn each conference, Quarterfinal games will be hosted by the two teams with the best record in Group Play games, and the team with the best record in Group Play games will host the wild card team. In the event two or more teams are tied for the higher seed in a conference, the tie among the teams will be broken following the same tiebreaker protocol as described above.\n\nDuring the Knockout Rounds on days when Emirates NBA Cup games are not scheduled (Dec. 12-13 and Dec. 15-16), the 22 teams that do not qualify for the Knockout Rounds will each play two regular-season games.\n\nA formulaic approach will determine the matchups for these games using the Group Play standings in each conference (5th-15th). Two of the 22 games will be scheduled cross-conference since there will be an odd number of teams in each conference that do not advance to the Quarterfinals. These cross-conference games will be scheduled between bottom- finishing teams in the Group Play stage subject to travel constraints, and no team will play more than one of its two games cross-conference. The other 20 games will be scheduled within conference featuring teams that are otherwise scheduled to play each other three times over the course of the season wherever possible.\n\nThe losing teams from the Quarterfinals in each conference will play each other in a regular-season game on Dec. 12, 13, 15 or 16.\n\nIII. Prizing and League Honors\n\nThe Emirates NBA Cup prize pool will be allocated to the players on the teams that participate in the Knockout Rounds, with allocations increasing depending on how far a team progresses in the tournament.\n\nAt the conclusion of the Emirates NBA Cup, a media panel will select the Most Valuable Player of the competition and the All-Tournament Team. Selection will be based on the players’ performance in both Group Play and the Knockout Rounds"
