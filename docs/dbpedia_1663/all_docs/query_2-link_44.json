        "text": "Martina Navratilova (USA, b. Czechoslovakia) won 167 singles and 177 doubles titles during her professional tennis career (1975-2006). Among her 344 tournament victories on the WTA (Womenâs Tennis Association) Tour are an open-era record 59 Grand Slam titles (18 singles, 1978-90; 31 womenâs doubles, 1975-90; 10 mixed doubles, 1974-2006) and 21 year-end championships (currently known as the WTA Finals) between 1977 and 1991 (8 singles, 13 womenâs doubles).\n\nNavratilovaâs 167 singles victories â an all-time record, ahead of Chris Evert (157) and Steffi Graf (107) â were achieved from the 239 WTA finals she contested (1974-94), while in doubles her 177 titles â an all-time record, ahead of Rosie Casals (112) and Pam Shriver (106) â came from 223 finals (1973-2006). In Grand Slams, she converted 18 of her 32 singles final appearances, 31 of her 37 womenâs doubles final appearances and 10 of her 16 mixed doubles final appearances into title-winning success, finishing her career with 59 Grand Slam titles from a total of 85 finals.\n\nOutside the Grand Slams, the Virginia Slims/Avon Championships of Chicago (12 titles in 1978-92), the Eastbourne International (11 titles in 1978-93), the Virginia Slims/Avon Championships of Washington (9 titles in 1975-90) and the Virginia Slims/Avon Championships of Dallas (9 titles in 1979-89) were the WTA tournaments at which Navratilova claimed the most singles titles. The Avon Championships/Virginia Slims of New York City (11 titles in 1980-91), the Avon Championships/Virginia Slims of Dallas (8 titles in 1974-83) and the Porsche Grand Prix (now more commonly known as the Stuttgart Open) in Filderstadt, Germany (8 titles in 1979-91), were among her most prolific wins on the womenâs doubles tour.\n\nNavratilovaâs 59 Grand Slam titles: Australian Open (3 singles, 8 womenâs doubles, 1 mixed doubles); French Open (2 singles, 7 womenâs doubles, 2 mixed doubles); Wimbledon (9 singles, 7 womenâs doubles, 4 mixed doubles); US Open (4 singles, 9 womenâs doubles, 3 mixed doubles).\n\nBetween 1981 and 1989, Navratilova won 20 womenâs doubles titles with Pam Shriver (7 Australian Open, 4 French Open, 5 Wimbledon, 4 US Open).\n\nThe left-hander finished her career with 2,189 match wins in total (1,442 singles, 747 doubles)."
