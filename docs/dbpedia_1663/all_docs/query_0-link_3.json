We don't need pretty tennis draw tables, just ones which work. It makes no sense to me just to change one set of draw brackets and not all; so seeing as this is such a big change in mark-up, I would appreciate input from other project members. Jared Preston (talk)\n\nMaybe it's just me but I do not find Trest's version \"prettier\" at all... I really dislike it. Maybe it looks better with names in the bracket, but I don't think so. Those heavy lines are what I'm gonna notice instead of the players names. The old way works well and looks better, and I don't even like the blue color changes for the rounds. If it ain't broke... Fyunck(click) (talk)\n\nThe outline is way too bold. Lajbi Holla @ me • CP\n\nNow there is a slightly different change that needs comment on at template talk]. This is just a slight change to distinguish the groups of four. I didn't have a problem before but I can see that some might find this very slight change as being better. Comment over at the bracket talk page. Fyunck(click) (talk)\n\nI am proposing the deployment of the module to provide a consist look across all the templates (apart from those with added features like Template:8TeamBracket-Compact-Tennis5). To try, use {{ #invoke: TeamBracket-Compact-Tennis | teamBracket | rounds = 4 | sets = 5 }} and the usual arguments of RD1-team01, etc. --SocietyBox (talk)\n\nI noticed you did a change at 16teambeacket that changed \"1st round/2nd round\" to \"Round of 16/Quarterfinals\". Not sure I like that so I changed it back for discussion. Fyunck(click) (talk)\n\nI totally understand that. Defaults can be changed in the individual templates. So, for 16TeamBracket, it would look like: {{ #invoke: TeamBracket-Compact-Tennis | teamBracket | rounds = 4 | ... | RD1 = {{{RD1|1st round}}} }}. Or I can change the default in the module itself. All suggestions welcome. But if we can tweak this to perfection, you are in favour of doing this in general, right? --SocietyBox (talk)\n\nI am curious between the difference of the two championships. Both claim to be the main official indoors tournament back in the days with the former being established in 1907 and only for women and the latter in 1898 for both gender. Although the 1898 is only claimed in the infobox and no refernce given (official site doesn't back this up). My problem is: which one the legal successor of the pre-open era indoors tournament? and second what's the situation of the years, which has been overlapped by both tournaments (e.g. 1984)? The we have two national indoors champions? What do you think? Lajbi Holla @ me • CP\n\nHi Lajbi, about a year ago I posted on the same topic (see WikiProject Tennis/Archive 11) but never really followed up on it. The men's tournament began in 1898 in Newton Center. There was no men's tournament in 1899 but in 1900 they moved to the Seventh Regiment Armory in Manhattan, New York where it was played until 1963 with the exception of 1941 (Oklahoma City) and 1942-1945 (no tournament). In 1964 the tournament moved to Salisbury and was organized by Jimmy Connors' manager Bill Riordan. The last move occurred in 1977 when Memphis became the host and where it has been played since. Men's doubles were introduced in 1900. The women's tournament started in 1907 (doubles in 1908) at the same location as the men so in those days it was a combined tournament. According to Robertson's Encyclopedia of Tennis the women moved to Longwood in 1942 and remained there until 1966. Newspaper archives show it's a bit more complicated, indicating that they played periods in New York (1907–1920, 1934–1940, 1947–1953) and Longwood (1921–1933, 1941–1946, 1954–1966). From 1967 to 1972 the women played in Winchester. In 2002 the women rejoined the men in Memphis and in 2012 Memphis announced that it was renaming (restoring) the tournament to U.S. National Indoor Tennis Championships. The men's tournament should not be confused with the U.S. Pro Indoor which was played in Philadelphia and was initiated by the WCT tour. Hope that helps.--Wolbo (talk)\n\nWow. I remembered that thread an year ago but didn't remembered what really went down in it. Thanks for your response. I was a bit trouible with the 1930 in tennis and 1931 in tennis articles where the sources identified the US Indoors (same results) but there were men's tournament at almost the same time. Now my question is, which one should be linked in those articles as the main tournament. Or shouldn't we merged these two championships? I mean with a short story-sidenote like the one you told in your reply. Lajbi Holla @ me • CP\n\nNot easy to determine but for now you could link the women's tournament to US Indoor Championships and the men's tournament to U.S. National Indoor Tennis Championships. Perhaps they could be merged but I don't know enough about the Virginia Slims of Oklahoma to be able to judge if that should be part of the women's indoor history or not. It's listed at U.S. National Indoor Tennis Championships but does not show at US Indoor Championships and neither on tennisforum. In any case the men's part should be augmented with the tournaments from 1898 to 1971. If the articles do remain separate than it seems they should be renamed to a men's and women's version like e.g. the US Clay Court Championship. The current naming is confusing. --Wolbo (talk)\n\nHere's a nice photo from 1908 of the tournament at the Seventh Regiment Armory.--Wolbo (talk)\n\nAnd what about the mixed doubles? Which one's authority is that? The problem is so multilayered that it needs to be solved somehow. If there's no official stance on it then shouldn't we just handle it our way? Even if it means merging the two? Lajbi Holla @ me • CP\n\nI have no info on the mixed doubles and don't even know exactly when they were played. We probably could/should merge the two articles but I need to educate myself first on the women's tournament to confirm this. In the meantime the missing years (1900–1970) of the men's singles results have been added to the U.S. National Indoor Tennis Championships article. According to the Spalding and Wright & Ditsons annuals the 1898 tournament in Newton Center was not seen as an official national tournament and is therefore not added.--Wolbo (talk)\n\nAccording to Shannon's USTA Encyclopedia the mixed doubles were played from 1921 until 1968 and were first won by the world class team of Molla Mallory and Bill Tilden. I changed my mind on the 1898 men's tournament and decided to add it after all because both Robertson's Encyclopedia of Tennis and Shannons official USTA Encyclopedia list it. It seems the Oklahoma tournaments listed on US Indoor Championships should not be considered official US Indoor Championships with exception of the 2001 edition. If this can be confirmed, as well as the status of the 2002–2012 women's Memphis tournaments, I will propose to (selectively) merge US Indoor Championships into U.S. National Indoor Tennis Championships.--Wolbo (talk)\n\nWow really great work. Let's merge them then based on your research. Lajbi Holla @ me • CP\n\nIn the ATP rankings Nadal finished first but ITF named Djokovic as its World Champion. Some editors think Nadal and Djokovic are ranked equally, others disagree, so there has been an edit war over the article World number 1 male tennis player rankings. BoDu (talk)\n\nThis is the first tough one in a long time. In the old days there were many many champion sources/opinions where co-ranking could happen more frequently. These days we really look at two...ATP and ITF. And when they've been different it's either a resentful snub (which we ignored) or the points were lopsided in other departments. In this case it's really really close everywhere. We have ATP champion Nadal and ITF champion Djokovic. Djokovic won 1 Major, Nadal 2 Majors. That looks much better for Nadal. But we have the Australian that Djokovic won and Nadal didn't play. The French that Nadal won but Djokovic lost in semis to Nadal 7-9 in the 5th set. We have Wimbledon where Djokovic lost to Murray in the finals and Nadal lost in the first round. We have the US Open with Nadal beating Djokovic in the finals. So Nadal won two Majors but didn't play or make it out of the first round in two other Majors. Djokovic won one Major and had 2 finals and a semi-final. That looks pretty close. But also to point out that Djokovic was 0-2 against Nadal in Majors, though Nadal wasn't around in the Majors with better surfaces for Djokovic.\n\nWe look at the ATP points, where they might decide it because they include points from all tournaments and its 13,030 to 12,260 in Nadals favor. That's very close. The next closest player was Ferrer with 5,800. How about a drop off to the Masters 1000 events? Nadal won 5 to Djokovics 3, but in their only finals meeting (at the Monte Carlo Masters), Djokovic won in straight sets. Murray was the only other players to win a single Masters 1000 event in 2013. And to culminate the season at the year-end championships, Djokovic beat Nadal in the final in straight sets. If we go further the Davis Cup, Djokovic was 7–0 and Nadal was 1–0.\n\nThis was simply a very close year and for me the only thing that could edge it to Nadal are the 2 victories over Djokovic in Majors. But to be honest this is probably a good candidate for a split number one, just like the ATP and ITF have already done for us. Neither entity seems to be blatantly wrong in their conclusions. Fyunck(click) (talk)\n\nOne other thing. I'm not so sure about the \"edit war\" at noted article. We seem to have an inordinate amount of just created accounts in that war. Frodeno34, Jerseyboy30, Tennisskatinggymnasticsfan, Findingneverland01, plus anon ip's 76.64.17.49, 62.200.73.61... all look to exist only to fight over this article. They were all created in the last few days except 62.200.73.61 and he's been blocked. Very strange and suspicious group of editors. Fyunck(click) (talk)\n\nNadal defeated Djokovic in the Rogers Cup semifinals in 3 sets (6:4 3:6 7:6) so their Monte Carlo meeting wasn't their only meeting at the masters this year.There really isn't any dispute over this.Almost all of the most important stats are in Nadal's favour.If we go by number of titles,Nadal won 10 and Djokovic 7.Nadal reached 14 finals in total and Djokovic 9.The only tournament where Nadal lost before the semifinals was Wimbledon so that speaks about his amazing consistency.Nadal won a record 5 masters( reached 6 finals total and 2 other semifinals and in doing so became the only player who reached atleast the semifinals of 8 masters in a single year)while Djokovic won 3 and the WTF but lost early at Indian Wells (SF to Del Potro),Miami (4th round to Haas),Madrid (2nd round to Dimitrov),Rome (QF to Berdych),Canada (SF to Nadal) and Cincinnati (QF to Isner).He did have a greater consistency at the slams but Nadal had the much greater consistency at masters.In the span of half a year,from the month of April and his Monte Carlo title to the month of October and his Beijing title Djokovic didn't win a single title but was still ranked number 1.That's to much of a hole to overlook,that the number 1 ranked player couldn't win a single title in 6 months out of 7 tournaments played in that period and only reached 2 finals.Nadal won 7 titles in that same period.\n\nIf we go by their win/loss record in 2013 it's 75-7 (91,5%) for Nadal and 74-9 (89%) for Djokovic.If we go by their record against top 10 opponents it's 24-5 (82,8%) for Nadal and 24-6 (80%) for Djokovic.If we go by their head to head record in 2013 against each other it's 3-3 but Nadal won their most important matches (RG SF (a slam), Rogers Cup SF (a masters) and US open F (a slam)) while Djokovic won the Monte Carlo F (a masters), Beijing F (a 500 tournament)and the WTF F (the year ending masters).\n\nOut of his 7 loses,Nadal lost 5 times to top 10 players (3 Djokovic,1 Del Potro,1 Ferrer) while the only loses to lower ranked players were to Zeballos in the first tournament after his comeback and Darcis at Wimbledon.Djokovic lost to more players outside of top 10 (Haas,Dimitrov,Isner) and more top 10 opponents as well (3 Nadal, Del Potro 1, Berdych 1 and Murray 1).\n\nSo in conclusion, the only thing that Djokovic has over Nadal in 2013 is his greater consistency at slams but even there Nadal won 2 slams to Djokovic's 1 and defeated Djokovic both times on his way to the title.Nadal had the greater consistency at masters and all other tournaments.He didn't play the Australian open because of injury and that's the only reason the ranking points are close.He didn't play the Miami masters either while Djokovic played all 9.So even though he missed 1 slam and 1 masters while Djokovic played all of them,he still outperformed him.That's just a testament to his incredible year.\n\nOther important sources such as newspapers,articles,journalists etc. etc. - Tennis magazine France, L'equipe champion of champions, US sports academy, 2013 BTB SI awards (Courtney Nguyen), ESPN Tennis (Peter Bodo blog), 2013 TENNIS.COM AWARDS (Steve Tignor) all name Nadal their player of the year.Only the ITF named Djokovic their player of the year and that's because he played all ITF tournaments (4 slams and Davis Cup).\n\nRegarding Davis Cup,Spain lost in the first match against Canada while Nadal was still injured and out of the tour.So Nadal couldn't play more matches for his country even if he wanted.But he did play the World Group playoffs in September.Davis Cup is a team competition and shouldn't be taken into singles results as you depend on your teammates to advance.\n\nI don't think there should be a dispute over this.Titles won,finals reached,slams won,masters won,win/loss record in 2013, win/loss record against top 10, head to head against each other,overall consistency,rankings,ranking points (Nadal finished 1st,Djokovic 2nd) all favour Nadal.And those are the most important stats.Even the most important awards (except ITF because of their special criteria) went to Nadal. Findingneverland01 (talk) 20:03, 27 December 2013 (CET)\n\nYeah yeah yeah. Do us a favour and shut up. Ok I'll bite. Novak won the ITF award for performing BETTER in the ITF events. Won Melbourne. Finalist New York and Wimbledon and SF Roland Garros. Also won Davis Cup and World Tour Finals (result of a merger between ATP and ITF season ending tournaments). Nadal only played a singles and a doubles match of a relegation/promotion tie in Davis cup. Zero pointed in Melbourne and effectively did the same in Wimbledon. Despite his maxi at Roland Garros and New York and a runner up spot at the WTF, Novak performed more consistently than Nadal at events that matter to the ITF. That's why Novak is ITF world champ. So please be quiet and stop causing issues by going against the source with your agenda as apparently two of the sources apparently settle the breaker in Nadal's favour. — Preceding unsigned comment added by 92.22.86.22 (talk)\n\nI would just like to point out that Djokovic didn't win the Davis Cup, Serbia lost in the finals to Czech Republic.So please correct your post,this is addressed to the user before Tennisfan8787.And Nadal doesn't have a zero pointer at Wimbledon,he won 10 points for his Wimbledon loss.A zero pointer means you skipped a tournament and didn't play.And nobody's questioning Djokovic's ITF award.Under the criteria established by the ITF it was deserved.\n\nBut the discussion revolves around the question who the best tennis player in 2013 is.And that's why I took all tournaments into account(ATP and ITF), the whole season and the most important stats.Numbers don't lie even if opinions are subjective.And almost all of them (except slam or ITF consistency however you want to call it) support Nadal.That is the only thing Djokovic has over Nadal in 2013. He wasn't even more consistent than Nadal when you take all tournaments into account ( again ATP and ITF).In my opinion, Djokovic's slam consistency is just not enough to put him at the same level as Nadal in 2013,not when Nadal has all the other and many more stats in his favour.The rankings reflect that.\n\nI don't know.Why don't other users try to refute the numbers and stats.Give your arguments why you think Djokovic should be on the same level, but not subjective opinion,it has to be supported by numbers and stats.And in my opinion, the whole season must be taken into account (ATP and ITF)tournaments because that's the most objective criteria. Findingneverland01 (talk) 1:05, 29 December 2013 (CET) — Preceding unsigned comment added by Findingneverland01 (talk • contribs)\n\nHey, it could very well be that Nadal winds up here in the number one spot, but it's very very close and we have the two governing bodies of tennis split on who is number one. The ITF obviously puts a lot of stock into a player like Djokovic who played great in all the Majors (winning one), won the year end tour finals, and had a 7-0 record in Davis Cup (the premier international team event). It measured against Nadal who played great in two Majors (winning both), but won zero matches in two other Majors, played great but lost the Tour Finals to Djokovic, and was 1-0 in Davis Cup. Per the ITF, Novak Djokovic narrowly edged out Rafael Nadal \"based on an objective system that considers all results during the year, but gives special weight to the Grand Slam tournaments, and two ITF international team competitions, Davis Cup by BNP Paribas and Fed Cup by BNP Paribas.\" The ATP uses a points system where Nadal narrowly edged out Djokovic. This was a great year for Tennis (unless one is a Federer fan), and I'm looking forward to 2014. I expect Murray to regain some traction after his surgery but I expect Federer may well drop out of the top 10 as age and another child ebb at his concentration and skills. Fyunck(click) (talk)\n\nWikipedia is using 4 sources to identify the number one. Tennis Magazine (France), Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) awards and ATP year-ending computer rankings consider Rafael Nadal as the number one. International Tennis Federation (ITF) award consider Novak Djokovic as the number one. The result is Nadal 3 - Djokovic 1. — Preceding unsigned comment added by 83.165.163.195 (talk)\n\nNot really. It has used several different sources throughout 130 years. ATP awards and ATP rankings are simply different feathers of the same duck. And since there are two governing bodies they are always given the most weight. By the way, welcome to wikipedia new user. Fyunck(click) (talk)\n\nWould someone else like to weigh in? We really shouldn't leave it blank and we have to be careful with a sockpuppet in our midst. We have one person here pushing for Nadal #1 and Djokovic #2. I really don't care as long as it's sockpuppet-free, not in the middle of an edit war, and we are consistent. I think the ladies tables split the no. 1 players every time they have a difference in the WTA and ITF champions... at least over the past 30 years. I would lean for co-champions, but if I had to use my opinion to make a very hard choice I'd go with Nadal. It's obviously not an easy pick since we have top people at the ATP and ITF looking at all aspects of their respective years... and they split. Let's get a couple quick thoughts here and plop in the decision before the Australian Open starts. Hope you all are having a great start to the new year. Fyunck(click) (talk)\n\nWhat you all forget is that Djokovic could have easily won the ATP rankings if he hadn't concentrated so much on the Davis Cup. Djokovic still has two more tournaments to add it to the mix according the ATP best 18 rule. Nadal won the season with 19 tournaments (out of 20), while Djokovic has 17. Djokovic's performance is better based solely on the fact that he reached the same points with fewer tournaments. All Djokovic should have done is enter an 500 and 250 tournament more and win it. Then you have 20 points difference only. And the fact that Djokovic's Davis Cup performance bonus (125 plus points awarded for 8 victories) was only missed on one rubber against Belgium when Serbia already won the tie 3-0 and the remaining two rubbers were \"dead\" so Djokovic didn't have to play more...I guess David Goffin couldn't have had a chance to defeat him. If it wasn't for the fatigue factor Djokovic is easily the ATP number one right now. But no matter what we think anyway or the \"justness\" if we have two governing bodies then we have to put both number 1 on the map. Lajbi Holla @ me • CP\n\nI think we should put Nadal and Djokovic as co-champions. BoDu (talk)\n\nOne thing though. Just because the ITF and ATP split doesn't mean they are 100% of the time correct. The ATP completely blew it in the 70's with Conners when the points didn't match the prowess, and the ITF has done things like punish Edberg for no good reason. So we always have to look at sourcing and common sense. But in recent years all differences have been pretty darned close. Fyunck(click) (talk)\n\nNadal only played 1 more tournament than Djokovic in 2013. He played 17 tournaments to Djokovic's 16.It's even listed here on Wikipedia, I'm surprised you haven't noticed it yet.The ATP counts both singles and doubles tournaments that you play and lists it like that and that's why it seems that Nadal played more, but he played only 1 more. Check it in their career statistics. Djokovic received ATP points for his Davis Cup performance, 430 to be exact so it only benefited him. And take into account that Nadal missed 1 slam and 1 masters, Djokovic played all of them but Nadal still outperformed him.In 8 months he achieved more than Djokovic did in 10, playing the whole season.\n\nOne more thing.If you put Nadal and Djokovic as co-champions, then you will have to do the same with the Edberg - Lendl case in 1990. It's almost identical to this situation.The ATP picked Edberg and ITF (which was strongly criticised) Lendl.Edberg lost in the 1st round in 2 majors ( RG and US open) but I guess you didn't consider him having a 'hole in his resume' in that case. He only won 1 major and less titles overall and even has a weaker resume compared to Nadal, but still you put him number 1. So what, 1 set of rules in 1 case and totally different one in another.This is a fair question.I would like it to be answered. Are the 3 of you going to make the decision? Because there are more tennis fans who don't agree with the co-champions decision (about 90% of them) but are not registered here. And yes,I've seen your page about number 1 ranked female tennis players where you put ATP and ITF combined but you haven't done that in the male's category.You would've to change the whole page in this case. Findingneverland01(click) (talk) 22:07, 3 January 2014 (CET) — Preceding unsigned comment added by Findingneverland01 (talk • contribs)\n\nI think we've hashed out the whys or why-nots and so far it's only you who disagree here. Remember that Lendl wasn't even 2nd in the ATP... he was 3rd. And the ITF was hammered by Tennis Magazine, and several sports networks for punishing Edberg for his verbal abuse of an ITF tournament. Maybe there's more editors here who think as you, and I'm cool with that. That's why I asked for more input over the next several days from some dedicated \"long term\" tennis editors here. I want to know their thoughts about what we've all talked about here. We have a split champion as it stands between the ATP and ITF... and we're trying to establish if there's reason to believe that either of the governing bodies used really faulty data or were vindictive in some way in coming to their conclusions. Fyunck(click) (talk)\n\n-On the topic on who is the Best Player of 2013, which is under \"World number 1 male tennis player rankings,\" there is no question about who is the CONSENSUS (read:in general agreement) Best player of the Year. Year-End Number 1, ATP Player of the Year, and Player of the Year Awards from major media organizations (L'equipe, ESPN, Tennis Magazine, etc) all went to Nadal. The ITF is the only one that proclaimed Djokovic World Champion based on \"criteria\" that is not even consistent (as in the case where they awarded Wozniacki ITF Champion in 2010 where she got less Grand Slam Points that Serena but was Year-End Number One. This is the not the first time that they have rendered a controversial decision for which they have been broadly criticized, as was the case in 1990). However, in this case, there is no question that Nadal is Year-End Number 1, has more Grand Slam points, more majors, and has a better head-to-head in Grand Slams against his nearest rival. Even the table for Wikipedia uses \"Consensus Number 1\" and \"Consensus Number 2\" and pretty much there is consensus that Nadal is Number 1 while Djokovic is Number 2. -Marley2525 — Preceding unsigned comment added by Marley2525 (talk • contribs)\n\nI believe our sock has made another appearance. Fyunck(click) (talk)\n\nNo, Mr. Fyunck. I am here to join this discussion. The entries were blank that's why I added the edits, which I only made today (you can check my IP address and username). Now, the evidence as to who is the Best Player of 2013, even the entries that accompany the said table in the Wikipedia page, point to Nadal as the consensus best player, with the ITF award as the only inconsistency (it has a particular history for controversies). I've stated the reasons why I edited the entry as such above. Besides the ITF, I have not seen Djokovic named as the Best Player of the Year, and the ITF have rightly been criticized for this decision. Now, in case the \"long term tennis editors\" decide otherwise, then I would just make sure that the criteria are both consistent and clearly spelled out. What were looking for here is \"consensus\" based on awards and what the hard data shows, not rationalizations. Thank you.-Marley2525 — Preceding unsigned comment added by Marley2525 (talk • contribs)\n\nThe entries were blank because of the open discussion here since Dec 23. You were reverted and chose to add it back. Fyunck(click) (talk)\n\nI see a lot of personal opinions about who should be ranked no. 1 but this is an encyclopedia and not a fanboy forum like menstennisforums or talktennis which means that our own opinion on who was the better player of the two and deserves to be ranked no. 1 for 2013 is irrelevant. As mentioned by others we need to reflect what is said on the subject in reliable sources and weigh the importance of those sources. It is obvious that the media sources have chosen Nadal as the no.1 player and based solely on that it would be a clear consensus. But the two most important sources by far on this subject are the official tennis organizations ATP and ITF and their vote is split so unless there is a valid reason to discard or downplay the ITF vote we have to follow suit and place Nadal and Djokovic as joint no.1. Had the ITF vote been based on their own tournaments only (Grand Slam, Davis Cup), ignoring all others, then we would have a case to ignore it or give it less weight but they clearly state it is \"based on an objective system that considers all results during the year\". --Wolbo (talk)\n\nThe other thing is that many are saying we should only look at what Nadal did as opposed to what he didn't do. Well neither the ATP or ITF work that way. Case in point is that even with what Nadal did accomplish this year, the ATP would have awarded Djokovic the no.1 year end ranking had Nadal not made the semis of the YEC. Every placement rung matters. It would have been a clean sweep for Djokovic no matter Nadals two majors to one. It was razor thin. Going into the last event of the season the ATP and ITF no. 1 was up for grabs. The difference being the ATP only needed Nadal to reach the semis to get no.1, where the ITF (likely) gave no.1 to the winner. It doesn't get much closer than that and I don't see any reason to think that either the ATP or ITF didn't do their homework. Fyunck(click) (talk)\n\nFirst of all, personal preferences, subjective views or biased assumptions on who is the best player, who is from the “best” (maybe your own) country, who deserves it more, who in ones opinion should be the no. 1 ranked tennis player in 2013 etc., have no place in this discussion. It is completely irrelevant, as Wolbo mentions. Objectively, looking at the stats, and the WHOLE 2013 tennis season there really should be no dispute over this. As “Findingneverland01” correctly displays it in his comment/text above, Rafael Nadal leads almost every stat there is and for sure all the important ones for 2013, not least the official ATP ranking system that determines who is No. 1. Nadal is thus the undisputed Year End no. 1 for 2013! The fact that Nadal was not able to play the first part of the season due to injury, thus missing the Australian Open, just strongly emphasizes how great his achievement is and makes it even more impressive that he was able to exceed Djokovic – who himself had a great season – in the rankings. If the roles were to be reversed in 2014, I would argue for Djokovic to be the undisputed Year End No. 1 for 2014 as I did in 2012 where some – supposedly strong Federer fans – kept arguing that Federer should be the Year End no. 1 for 2012, because he had a great season, regained the no. 1 ranking and broke the overall rankings record, won Wimbledon again etc..https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Capricornmanager1\n\nActually only looking at all the stats and determining no. 1 is original research, especially when we have two (relatively) objective governing bodies telling us we have two no. 1's. Missing the AO is a big minus for both the ATP and ITF... not a plus by any stretch except in personal opinion. Rewarding something for what a player doesn't do is crazy. Heck he could play one tournament in a season like the AO, win it, and you could extrapolate that his percentage is amazing. It took the last tournament of the year to determine no.1 for the ATP and the ITF. That's CLOSE. A knee injury to Nadal during the round robin YEC would have 100% given the ATP no. 1 to Djokovic so all your objective feelings for what went before wouldn't mean anything. By your totals even if Nadal didn't play the YEC he should have easily been no.1 in both bodies, and that would be completely wrong. It came down to that last tournament for both the ITF and ATP. Fyunck(click) (talk)\n\nAnother week gone by here, and in the final week of the AO the crazy anon ip's will start editing everywhere, as often happens. We either need to lock the article again or put something in the empty spots right away. This weekend is a month of discussions here. I would go ahead and put in co-champs, but I'll change my vote rather than leave it a blank hole forever. This is the time readers are looking at this section of our encyclopedia... during the heart of a Major tournament. And them seeing a blank space doesn't really show us in a good light imho. Fyunck(click) (talk)\n\nHello Fyunck. I do not know if you have been reverting posts on this issue (World no. 1 tennis player 2013) but I have seen your posts on \"Who's the best men's player in 2013?\" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Tennis). Wolbo has been reverting my posts to begin with. I am only reverting them back. It is a silly \"edit war\" as you call it, but it is hardly a \"consensus decision\" that you and Wolbo think, that Nadal and Djokovic should be joint no. 1 for 2013. Who should decide this then? Apparently, some of us do not agree on this. And Wolbo, please stop reverting another editor's work! I will write another post here later. Capricornmanager1\n\nIt is a done deal. You'll even note that in box two I didn't even say \"No consensus among the sources\" or \"both ranked equally.\" To make it more general it just says ATP champion and ITF champion. That seems to be as good as it's gonna get. 45 days of blankness would be too much. You are far far past the 3RR and I suggest you stop edit warring there. Fyunck(click) (talk)\n\nThere is a move request at talk Li Na that could potentially affect thousands of articles. Our player articles that need disambiguation have traditionally use (tennis)... a one word moniker for everything tennis related. We have only used (tennis player) if it needs to be even more refined because someone like a tennis coach has the same name. Then we would need to use (tennis player) and (tennis coach)... or (tennis umpire), (tennis commentator), etc... That's what we have been doing, good or ill. There is a proposal to move Li Na (tennis) → Li Na (tennis player). The first attempt at this failed in February 2011. I lean towards \"if it ain't broke don't fix it\" but perhaps most everyone else would like this proposed change. In the scheme of things this is no big deal and per wikipedia guidelines, both ways are acceptable as long as we are consistent...\n\n\"The disambiguation used varies between sports, but should either describe the persons role\n\nwithin the sport (\"bowler\", \"cyclist\", \"acrobat\", \"chess player\", \"martial artist\", etc.) or the\n\nsport itself (\"basketball\", \"baseball\", \"tennis\" etc).\n\nThe style used should be consistent within each sport.\"\n\nI'm sure 90% of our players have no disambiguation at all. This move is only about one person, Li Na, but since this \"could\" affect so many tennis articles I thought I would bring this to the attention of our many editors in case they want to comment at talk Li Na. Fyunck(click) (talk)\n\nI would use tennis player, because the article is about a tennis player, not about tennis. --Stryn (talk)\n\nAlready settled at (tennis), as we do all other articles. Fyunck(click) (talk)\n\nThere are two sportspeople named Adrian Sikora - a Polish football player and a Slovakian tennis player. The tennis player does not have Wikipedia article yet. (I don't think he fulfills notability criteria. If you check What links here in the article about the footballer, you will see that some tennis articles link to that page. What is a better solution to this?\n\nSimply remove the links from tennis articles. (Replace Adrian Sikora by Adrian Sikora in those articles.)\n\nReplace those links by Adrian Sikora (tennis), which will be a redlink.\n\nCreate a disambiguation page Adrian Sikora, which will lead to Adrian Sikora (football player) and Adrian Sikora (tennis). (In this way it was done on German Wikipedia: [1]).\n\n--Kompik (talk)\n\nI'd say the second option. No point in #3 (de.wiki works differently, and I suppose the footballer is the primary topic), and although #1 might be OK in some articles, #2 would be the best for now. As per Slovenský Tenis, I note that the tennis player's name is spelt Adrián. Jared Preston (talk)\n\nI think the general criteria that we use is... if the tennis player isn't notable yet but is really extremely likely to meet notability requirements in the future (obviously a little subjective), then we can red link it. Otherwise we normally remove the links completely. Fyunck(click) (talk)\n\nI did some searching and in looking at MOS and Wikipedia Guidelines: \"create a red link to indicate that a page will be created soon or that an article should be created for the topic because the subject is notable and verifiable.\" also \"Use of red links should be limited on disambiguation pages. The whole point of such a page is to direct the reader to the correct article, and a red link does not help.\" So unless someone is notable, it should be unlinked. But again, some leeway should be maintained. Maybe a newspaper mention that says a player is likely to be on a Fed Cup team next season.. or a junior that is ranked No. 4 or 5 and has been climbing in the rankings rapidly. But normally a red link is telling an editor that finds it, that we'd like them to create an article on this player... and if the player is not notable that would be the wrong thing to be showing and explaining to new editors. Fyunck(click) (talk)\n\nIf there is a link then it should always be a red piped link [[Adrian Sikora (tennis)|Adrian Sikora]]. Special:WhatLinksHere/Adrian Sikora (tennis) already shows four articles. Per Help:Pipe trick, you only have to save [[Adrian Sikora (tennis)|]] to make the link. PrimeHunter (talk)\n\nHello, tennis experts! This old Afc submission is slated for deletion as a stale draft. It needs to have a lot of unnecessary detail removed, but other than that, is this a notable player, and should the article be kept? —Anne Delong (talk)\n\nDelete it. It's 100% bogus. It's actually the profile of tennis player Jo-Wilfried Tsonga but with the name changed to fictitious player Matt Ustas. It was originally declined for good reason. Fyunck(click) (talk)\n\nThanks! I will make it go away. —Anne Delong (talk)\n\nFor the second time in recent history Davis Cup changed its URL sequence again. This time from www.daviscup.com/en/draws-results/tie/details.aspx?tieId=XYZ to www.daviscup.com/en/draws-results/tie/details.aspx?tieId=XYZ. Unfortunately we don't have template for tie details so the 115 pages that Google lists need to be fixed manually. Anyone interested in giving some help? Lajbi Holla @ me • CP\n\nAlmost none of those results are for this English wikipedia. I think 5 were for articles here (which I did just fix). The rest were from the swedish wikipedia. I think what needs to be searched is this http://www.daviscup.com/en/results. There we get 711 hits that need correcting. Daunting to say the least. Fyunck(click) (talk)\n\nThanks for your help at the bot request. Lajbi Holla @ me • CP\n\nI've fixed two! I've been filling missing content from the historical Davis Cup pages, so I'll keep fixing this as I go (so far I've added all missing tournament brackets and tie results - for all groups - for 1900-1987 and 2004-2012).Dlharmsworth (talk)\n\nI guess the bot is working. It fixed the link in this convo . Lajbi Holla @ me • CP\n\nWould you be interested in participating in a user study? We are a team at University of Washington studying methods for finding collaborators within a Wikipedia community. We are looking for volunteers to evaluate a new visualization tool.

If you would like to participate in our user study, please send me a message at Wkmaster (talk) .\n\nMaybe policy/guidelines/consensus has changed in regards to updating rankings before the ATP/WTA/ITF have done so. In prior conversations I thought we had agreed to updating the rankings ONLY AFTER the various bodies of tennis had done so. Otherwise we can show no proper sourcing to our readers and it would be original research (which is against wiki policy). IF an editor can show a source then of course it's fine and dandy, but otherwise we must wait until published. That's the way it's always been done and it's easy to follow... no source no update. The last two days I have been scolded for reverting these premature updates (pu's) and I don't want to keep feeling like the bad guy. While there are a couple others here who revert when they see them, I feel like I'm being attacked for doing my job with little backing from fellow editors. the editors who are doing the pu's say they do it because it's a convenient time and that if they don't do it early, no one else will. That's a very valid point... it's possible the updates will get missed for a week or two. But doing it early with no sources seems intrinsically wrong to me at wikipedia. Plus if a player retires on a Saturday they will not be ranked on Monday. We shouldn't be a WP:Crystal Ball and we aren't in some monumental hurry that we can't wait till they publish results every Monday.\n\nNow, I have no problem continuing to be the bad guy, and if I have to do multiple reverts from the same editor I leave a 1st or 2nd stage warning on their talk pages to let them know. I'm cool with that as it's part of being a wikipedian. But if everyone at Tennis Project is against what I'm doing and are actually cheering on these pu's then I can certainly stop. Heck I actually bend the rules a lot that even if the ATP/WTA sites haven't published their updates, if it's the same day (pst) I let the WP:OR go. I use pst because that's how wiki edit times shows up on my screen. So I'm asking my fellow editors what we should do about this? I know each of us tends to work on different aspects of wikipedia so no one should change their contribution style, I just want to know I'm still following Tennis Project consensus by keeping rankings to published sources. Thanks. Fyunck(click) (talk) .\n\nKudos to you for taking the heel role I'm absolutely and 100% with you in this. No need to update rankings as soon as a player hit the match ball in a final. Although I understand that some people are curious about the rankings changes and look for blogs that calculate it for them but when it comes to Wikipedia one must think as an editor and drop his/her fandom for the better quality, which in this case are the reliable sources. You are interpreting it correctly and following the proper wiki guidelines. No miscommunication here. Lajbi Holla @ me • CP\n\nI concur rankings should only be changed when they are updated from official sources ATP/WTA. --Navops47 (talk)\n\nAlthough one can argue that the race rankings as e.g. the one in 2014 ATP World Tour Finals#Singles can be easily updated as it requires simple maths to add new points to it. For the record I tend to accept that logic and let that pass. Lajbi Holla @ me • CP\n\nRanking updates before the offical site should only be allowed with a reliable source stated in the edit, but I have never seen any source at all in such edits. The official site is often kept from earlier as alleged reference but that means we lie about what the source says and that's even worse. Many of the premature updates contain errors and have to be corrected when the real rankings are published. PrimeHunter (talk)\n\nHas been discussed several times before and it should be a no-brainer that rankings are only updated once the relevant reliable sources, in this case per consensus the ATP and WTA websites, do so.--Wolbo (talk)\n\nI'm looking to possibly try and get the 2013 ITF Men's Circuit (including ITF Men's Circuit (Jan–Mar), ITF Men's Circuit (Apr–Jun), ITF Men's Circuit (Jul–Sep), ITF Men's Circuit (Oct–Dec)) articles to FL sometime hopefully in the near future which is a long shot but I think it's attainable, other than tracing down third party sources which I'm currently in lack of, any additional suggestions or help would be appreciated. Aureez (Talk)\n\nAll I know is that when I went to the 2013 ITF Men's Circuit article it's in horrible shape. First flag icons cannot be used for anything other than player nationality... they all have to be removed. Second, there is no earthly reason to link to countries over and over in that article. In normal article we don't link to countries, only the tournaments, but these tournaments are not notable in the least... so they can't be linked to. The same goes for articles like 2014 ITF Men's Circuit (January–March). While the player flags can stay, the country flags must go per consensus and protocol. Fyunck(click) (talk)\n\nGive me time and I'll have most of these issues sorted out, the only reason for Overlinking is solely down to the template used. Aureez (Talk)\n\nI realize that. All the other years have the same error and I'd have probably used the same overlay on a sandbox page to start the new year. Good luck. I'll stop by to help when I can. Fyunck(click) (talk)\n\nI changed up the 2014 ITF Men's Circuit article to fit more like the layout of a TV season, it's just a starting idea as far as getting some kind of content onto the article. Aureez (Talk)\n\nThe current navboxes for Grand Slam tournaments are split into two separate versions:\n\nPre Open Era\n\nOpen Era\n\nI propose to replace these with a single navbox that combines both periods into one navbox:\n\nSee an example of the proposed combined navbox at 1954 U.S. National Championships.\n\nThis is the same setup as the German, Italian, Polish and French wikipedias use.\n\nThe new navbox has a number of benefits:\n\nEasier navigation from pre open era tournament to open are tournament. There is currently no direct way to navigate from eg 1954 Wimbledon to 1970 Wimbledon. This setup solves that issue.\n\nThe articles relate to an edition of the tournament, not to an edition of the period (pre open or open) of the tournament and logically the navbox should follow.\n\nLess vertical scrolling required.\n\nThe bottom of the navbox has easy direct links to the list of men's singles, men's doubles, women's singles, women's doubles and mixed winners of that Grand Slam.\n\nThe design is responsive to the screen resolution i.e. it adapts the width to different screen sizes incl. tablets.\n\nThe design still clearly identifies the pre open and open era (via two subgroups).\n\nWhat are your thoughts and opinions on this navbox? Should we implement it?--Wolbo (talk)\n\nI'm 100% behind you on that, Wolbo! Jared Preston (talk)\n\nI agree, I never understood why the templates couldn't be more comprehensive, other than a stylistic reasons. Aureez (Talk)\n\nI guess the original reasoning is that the tournaments used different name. You will be listing the 1925 tournament under the navbox \"US Open\" when that was not it's name. I like it much better your way with one box but should we title the navbox itself \"U.S. National Championships – US Open\" instead of just US Open? Fyunck(click) (talk)\n\nYou're right Fyunck(click). That needs to be addressed somehow. Lajbi Holla @ me • CP\n\nI guess it would easy to fix with a title like \"U.S. National Championships – US Open\" or U.S. National Championships/US Open.\" But if the same is done to the other Big Four then Australia would need to have 3 titles like \"Australasian Championships/Australian Championships/Australian Open.\" Otherwise navigating a single navbox, as opposed to two, would sure be easier. Fyunck(click) (talk)\n\nIt's easy to adapt the title if required. As you point out Australia would need three, France two and Wimbledon only one. If we are very nit-picky the US would need three as well to include the 1917/1918 \"National Patriotic Tournament\". I'm not entirely convinced it is necessary, after all the Grand Slam tournament articles themselves only have the current name, but it can be done.--Wolbo (talk)\n\nHow about sidebar wise it as \"Pre Open Era (U.S. National Championships)\" and \"Open era (US Open)\", some adjustments would of course need to be made for Australia which I'm sure subgroups would accommodate. Aureez (Talk)\n\nHere are two versions for the Australian Open. The first has the same setup as the US Open but shows all the titles instead of just Australian Open. The second shows the different periods as groups within the navbox and has Australian Open as title. Combined with the US Open navbox that gives us three options. I have a slight preference for the first option because it's the cleanest / least cluttered but option two works for me as well. Consistency is important so if option three is chosen we can not mix that with the Pre Open Era / Open Era setup for the other slams.--Wolbo (talk)\n\nPreferences?--Wolbo (talk)\n\nI like the first one... it's cleaner, basic, and lets us know all we need to know. Fyunck(click) (talk)\n\nAgree. Seems we have a consensus for the concept. I'll wait a bit to see if there's more feedback, in the meantime here are the Wimbledon and French Open versions.--Wolbo (talk)\n\nOne thing... is it me (probably is) or does the gold color scheme of the AO seem much more harsh than the other three? It seems it would look better if we used a color closer to #FADB7F instead of #F9D251. Fyunck(click) (talk)\n\nFair point but knowing how these discussions on colors sometimes go it's probably best to pick this up in a separate topic.--Wolbo (talk)\n\nStarted updating the tournament navboxes. All these articles also have a succession box in the footer (see below). Do we still need the second row of that box which points to the previous and next edition of that particular tournament now that we have the new navbox directly below it (see example)? Seems redundant to me.--Wolbo (talk)\n\nPreceded by Grand Slams Succeeded by Preceded by Wimbledon championships Succeeded by\n\nNo point in having the s-box as well as the navbox. Delete the former while implementing the latter. Well done for your work! Jared Preston (talk)\n\nThe first row of the succession box still has a purpose as it points to different Grand Slam tournaments (in this case the French and US Open). Would not advocate deleting the entire box, just the second row with the duplicate info. Updated succession box would then look like this.--Wolbo (talk)\n\nPreceded by Grand Slams Succeeded by\n\nSorry Wolbo, that's what I meant. Just didn't make it clear. The Grand Slam to Grand Slam s-box could obviously be useful for navigational reasons... You're doing fine there! Jared Preston (talk)\n\nI proposed to add Suzanne Lenglen to the extended list of Wikipedia's Vital Articles. This extended list covers 10,000 subjects for which Wikipedia should ultimately have high-quality articles. Currently the following 14 tennis players are listed: Björn Borg, Margaret Court, Chris Evert, Roger Federer, Althea Gibson, Pancho Gonzales, Steffi Graf, Billie Jean King, Rod Laver, Rafael Nadal, Martina Navratilova, Pete Sampras, Bill Tilden and the Williams sisters. If interested you can support or oppose the proposal to add La Divine by casting your vote.--Wolbo (talk)\n\nNice... how Suzanne and Helen Wills are missing is a mystery. Fyunck(click) (talk)\n\nSince the discussion by other editors has moved to different fronts I thought I would add this info. It seems to add Lenglen we had to remove Althea Gibson. For me that was a no-brainer given that parameter, but it also got me thinking about why we should have to remove people in order to add tennis players to \"Vital Articles.\" Take a look at Suzanne Lenglen section and the discussion below it and add your voice. Considering how many rock stars and other entertainers there are, I don't see why tennis players should get the short end of the stick. Rock has been around for 50 years and tennis 140 years. I could be way off the radar here so give an honest opinion over there. Fyunck(click) (talk)\n\nGiven that the number of vital articles is limited to 10,000 it's normal that there will be discussions about the weight each (sub)category of articles should have within the total. Just looking at the sports categories I'd say that a total number of vital tennis articles between 12–15 seems sensible and justified.--Wolbo (talk)\n\nOh, and Suzanne Lenglen now has four votes but needs five to be included. You can still vote to include (or exclude) her.--Wolbo (talk)\n\nDone, Lenglen has now been added (replacing Althea Gibson).--Wolbo (talk)\n\nIt seems to me that it would make sense if the tables at ITF Rankings, Davis Cup#Current ITF rankings and Fed_Cup#Current rankings were in a consistent format. It would also make them easier to update as you wouldn't need to do both, just one and then copy across. The ITF Rankings tables in particular seem to be neglected and not updated consistently. I know the ATP rankings are in a template, so perhaps the ITF rankings could be put into a template as well? Fazzo29 (talk)\n\n{{Infobox college tennis team}}, {{Infobox Davis Cup team}} and {{Infobox Fed Cup team}} are being discussed for merger at TfD. Participation is welcome. —PC-XT+\n\nCommented at TfD. Not sure if all three can or should be merged but merging Davis Cup and Fed Cup should be straightforward.--Wolbo (talk)\n\nAnother series of tennis templates has been added at templates for discussion with a proposal to merge them. We do have an awful lot of tennis event templates and it's probably a good idea to clean that up provided it is done with care and we don't lose any functionality. --Wolbo (talk)\n\nHi, it seems like ATP id's are not working anymore. If you try [2], the link does not work. So all links with template {{ATP}} are now broken. Are those links just temporarily broken or is it permanent now? --Stryn (talk)\n\nNot good news. I hope it's temporary. In looking I see you can't access the players from the actual site either (except for a few top players) so I guess it's an ATP site glitch that they will fix. Fyunck(click) (talk)\n\nI just found this somewhat new kind of template, which is currently added to all \"notable\" Scottish players' articles. I'm curious of your take on this. Do we encourage editors to create similar topic-ensembles based on nationality alone? I mean basicly tennis is not so into national but individual performances and I guess it is also unprecedented to list tournaments held in a particular country (which includes the defunct ones as well). Imagine what a US navbox would look like if made in a similar style. Also and it is rather a geopolitical issue Scotland doesn't have his own Davis Cup team so all the notable players here seem to be hand-picked. If we go with \"national players\" why not do it with an official Davis Cup navbox instead like the second one (note that it is not an existing template just a proposal). Lajbi Holla @ me • CP {{Tennis in Scotland}}\n\nThe navbox is clearly based on Category:Tennis in Scotland. The tournaments are the same as in Category:Tennis tournaments in Scotland. The lists of Scottish players are identical to Category:Scottish male tennis players and Category:Scottish female tennis players, so \"notable\" must mean those with articles. That is common in lists and navboxes. {{Tennis in Scotland}} was created 9 July 2013‎ by User:MacRusgail who is Scottish and probably only wanted to create this one. Special:PrefixIndex/Template:Tennis in doesn't show others. It wouldn't work for large tennis nations but Scotland may be OK. PrimeHunter (talk)\n\nYou're background search proves to be true but we still need a general rule for such templates. Or can we tell a Latvian editor that he/she can have a Tennis in Latvia template but a Canadian don't (unless we want the navbox to contain more text than a start-article)? Also how to draw a line between Scottish and Tennis in Catalonia (e.g. Catalonia national football team exists) or Bavaria? That's why I chose the Davis Cup as a basis otherwise \"sky's the limit\" in a derogatory sense. Lajbi Holla @ me • CP\n\nAs the creator of the template I can give the inside view. No, it wasn't based on the category as such. Even though I put a lot of the articles into the category to begin with, but the only part which I used to create part of the infobox was the section about Scottish tennis players.\n\nScottish tennis is quite simple in this regard. We don't have many decent players, so it's not a problem to have all of them on the template. Two of them right now are brothers, and the third, Ms Baltacha is probably terminally ill. -MacRùsgail (talk)\n\nThank you for your contribution here as well as in creating the template. I don't have problem with its structure basicly I'm just trying to settle a general formatting rule, which would be suitable for e.g. a \"Tennis in the US\"-template. Personally I like the template however I'm thinking in its wider usage in a longer term. Your further feedback and ideas on how to make it applicable for all tennis articles is welcome. Lajbi Holla @ me • CP\n\nAn editor is trying to alter the first sentence of Monica Seles article, by putting the Hu name before the Sr name [3]. Can you please intervene? 79.117.171.50 (talk)\n\nTo be honest I have no idea why it leads with Monika Seleš. She lives in the US, this is an English wikipedia, she signs her own name Monica Seles, her own webpage is Monica Seles and her own biography is Monica Seles. It should be Monica Seles (Serbian: Monika Seleš, Моника Селеш; Hungarian: Szeles Mónika). Fyunck(click) (talk)\n\nYou are right. Change done. 86.127.26.117 (talk)\n\nRemember that's just my own opinion... not any statute or peer review. It's just that it's pretty clear that when she uses English she specifically uses Monica Seles. Fyunck(click) (talk)\n\nI agree with Fyunck(click) on this one. Monica Seles (Serbian: Monika Seleš, Моника Селеш; Hungarian: Szeles Mónika) is the correct lead here (as far as I am concerned).

Fyunck(click) (talk)\n\nWe have a problem editor who keeps moving Elena Tatarkova to Olena Tatarkova. Not sure what the agenda is. I changed it back once and asked for a discussion but it was moved again anyways. This seems like a slam dunk to me and I was going to call in an administrator but I thought I'd post it here first for help. There is discussion on the talk page. Fyunck(click) (talk)\n\nI am confused by the chart at 2014_French_Open#Point_and_prize_money_distribution. Suppose you win the qualifyier or are a lucky loser, it seems that you are eligible for 25 or 16 points. However, if you lose in R1 do you only get 10 points?--TonyTheTiger (T / C / WP:FOUR / WP:CHICAGO / WP:WAWARD)\n\nQualifiers add the points from the qualification and the main draw. Most main draw participants enter the main draw directly without qualification so they only get the main draw points. PrimeHunter (talk)\n\nThanks.--TonyTheTiger (T / C / WP:FOUR / WP:CHICAGO / WP:WAWARD)\n\nBack in the day when we were setting up most of the Tennis Guidelines something got missed. Consensus at Tennis Project has been to confine \"yearly\" player articles to those who have won a Major (or pro Major pre-1968) during their careers. This has kept things manageable here yet allowed special players to have special info. We didn't want 100,000 \"1973 Fred Kididlehopper tennis season\" articles. It gets talked about in the forums from time to time but the biggest one I can recall was at Roger Federer yearly articles. I didn't really like them at all except for exceptional years but consensus seemed to be that we allow a \"Career Statistics\" page for any players who have overflowing stats that have won a main tour ATP/WTA event, and that yearly articles be limited to those singles players that have won a Major at some time in their careers. Some had suggested a player ranked number 1 might also get yearly pages but it's few and far between that they wouldn't also have won a Grand Slam tournament. Certainly there might always be a really special circumstance to allow it otherwise but that's why we have this talk page... just in case an editor can plead a great case for inclusion without the normal parameters being met.\n\nAnyway, I noticed it's missing in our guidelines and it could help new editors when they create articles. The question is where to put it and how to word it. I would suggest under \"Article types and recommended practices\"... Maybe a section under \"Single-year tournament articles\" with a title \"Single-year player articles\" with the proper stipulations being stated? How to word it? Maybe Navops47 or Wolbo or Lajbi have some ideas? You all seem to be good at phrasing things properly so our new editors understand. I would also include a sentence on who gets Career statistics articles too since I don't see that in the guidelines either. Something that makes clear that career stats are for main draw winners (if overflowing on their main article), and yearly pages for Major winners. I guess Major winners would also include the pre-1968 pro slams also? Like I said I noticed it lacking in the guidelines as opposed to consensus so I brought it here to fine tune. I'd do it but I wasn't fond of a lot of these yearly articles to begin with and I thought maybe others here could write it more straight forward than my own typing fingers. Fyunck(click) (talk)\n\nI have no problem with any of your recommendations and headings I think they make sense and should be included in the guidelines if they are not there. The yearly articles I think fit the purpose for giving readers current in depth analysis but once they go into decline and retire \"are people still going to read through them as attentively\"? I doubt it, some new future super player will always rise at some point--Navops47 (talk)\n\nIt would be beneficial to have some sensible guidelines on these player season articles, it's getting a bit out of hand when articles like 2014 Roberto Bautusta-Agut tennis season start to appear. Limiting it to Grand Slam tournament winners seems sensible enough although I wouldn't object to including World no. 1 players if that's preferred by other editors. To get some more feedback perhaps we should alert the editors who have created these player season articles. There is a group of editors in the tennis project who do a lot of work on tournament articles and player (season) articles but who don't often participate in these discussions. Would be good to get their feedback as well on this issue.--Wolbo (talk)\n\nAdded \"Player career statistics articles\" and \"Player tennis season articles\" to the list of article types on the Guidelines page and gave a few examples of each. No criteria and/or recommended practices have been added yet, pending outcome of this discussion.--Wolbo (talk)\n\nHi, folks! I have a major question about the Grand Prix Championship Series. The article describes it as the predecessor to the ATP Masters 1000. But several articles don't mention it at all, for example Grand Prix tennis circuit and History of tennis. Also, Grand Prix season articles doen't mention Championship Series tournaments either. Can you explain it to me? Thanks! --NaBUru38 (talk)\n\nThe user above has caused havoc on the Queens singles page with a C&P move. An admin is needed to put the title at it's proper name as the editor who (used the correct way) moved the page has typoed. This is not the first time that I've seen him do a C&P move. I've left a message at his talkpage. Disability expert (talk)\n\nWe've had a group of 85 HQ images of players uploaded to Commons who played on May 22, on day 3 of the quallies. About 70 of these images don't give the name of the player. Any help in identifying the players would be great! I've linked on the category talkpage to the Roland Garros website listing of the players who played in the qualies that day. Here's the links:\n\ncommons:Category:2014 Roland Garros Qualifying Tournament\n\ncommons:Category talk:2014 Roland Garros Qualifying Tournament\n\nI've identified a couple, but it's pretty difficult. INeverCry\n\nI noticed these both on flickr before they were uploaded and later on Commons, thinking it would be a whole lot easier if the photographer had added captions! Admittedly, the only ones I recognised were 4 each of Golubic and Witthöft, which have been categorised accordingly. I'll keep looking back in the next few days/weeks and compare them to google search as an extra help-tool. Good luck! Jared Preston (talk)\n\nAt a first glance, I've identified Heather Watson, Irina Falconi and Laurent Lokoli. I'm guessing Evgeny Donskoy should be there as well since he was playing Lokoli (I think it might be him on the top row in the white shirt but I'm not 100% sure). I'll try and have a better look later when I've got more time. Username of a generic kind (talk)\n\nI've managed to identify Grace Min, Jonathan Eysseric and Jan Mertl thus far. I'll have another look later.

Should be the games separated into own sections, or everything put together into one section? Regards. --Tomcat (7)\n\nI don't quite understand what you've meant here. Are you asking if they need separate sections within an article like Mixed doublels career because if that's the case I'll say all under Tennis career will be sufficient. Especially if a player enters two or three events within a tennis tournament it fits better if all the results from the same tournament are listed in one place. But that's for the written prose part for the statistics see below. Lajbi Holla @ me • CP\n\nOn the other hand if you were referring to the scoreboard only then there should be a section dedicated to each event. One for singles, one for doubles and one for mixed. Like in Martina Navratilova career statistics. Lajbi Holla @ me • CP\n\nI meant the main article, such as Elena Vesnina, who is active in all three events.--Tomcat (7)\n\nThen the first option . All in one. Lajbi Holla @ me • CP\n\nI just read an article in SI about Francis Tiafoe who has been hyped as the next US tennis star. I came to Wikipedia to read more about Tiafoe and realized he didn't have an article. Then I figured I would create it, though I know little about tennis. My question is if he fits Wikipedia's tennis player notability guidelines. It appears as though he passes GNG, but I just want to double check here to see if he is notable.--Yankees10\n\nThere was an article about him, which was deleted in 2012. However, according to his ITF junior profile, he was ranked second in the world in April of this year, so that would pass the tennis notability guidelines. Jared Preston (talk)\n\nOk great, I'll create it when I get a chance, thanks.--Yankees10\n\nFor the future you can check the Tennis notability guidelines at Wikipedia:WikiProject_Tennis/Article_guidelines#Notability. Fyunck(click) (talk)\n\nAlright I started it, but like I said I don't know much about tennis so the article needs improvement.--Yankees10\n\nIt seems that ITF does not differ between youth and junior competitions. In tennis, what is the junior age, what the youth age. I think pro era starts by switching to WTA/ATP. Also, should I put all the results into one section? Regards. Tomcat (7)\n\nWhat do you mean by \"one section?\" I agree that the ITF is a bit unclear about youth/junior since tournaments can have \"Youth\" in the name, but I believe it is officially called the Junior Circuit. There are age group tournaments. You must be 13-18 to enter the junior circuit and after 18 you're done with jrs. The jr. events are ranked from low to high, 5,4,3,2,1,A. There is something called \"Junior Exempt\" if you're ranked in the top 10 but I forget how that works. Fyunck(click) (talk)\n\nI mean merge the youth/junior results into a section. Thank you for defining those terms. --Tomcat (7)\n\nSeems to happen every grand slam tournament or so. I've seen removals against consensus on a few articles like Federer, Djokovic and Nadal plus Eugenie Bouchard's now too. Keep an eye out. One or two editors. Thanks Fyunck(click) (talk)\n\nIn the infobox, is the line Highest ranking and Current ranking intended for junior or pro ranking? Regards.--Tomcat (7)\n\nAs far as I know we have always used pro ranking. So someone like Francis Tiafoe would have a current ranking of 1138, and a career high of 1125. Fyunck(click) (talk)\n\nThis is an FYI post. An editor started removing every flag from multiple draw articles/or adding flagathlete instead of flagicon. This certainly changes the appearance of thousands of articles so I thought it should be discussed here first. For instance the draws boxes with flagathlete and long names cause a new row to form which detracts from the draw style. On the otherhand it adds the 3 letter country code which some like better. I expressed my distaste for changing something that wasn't broken by reverting. Other editors reverted also. Now a bit of a compromise was done and that's what I wanted to discuss. Articles he changed today thus far:\n\n2000 Wimbledon Championships – Women's Singles\n\n2001 Wimbledon Championships – Women's Singles\n\n2002 Wimbledon Championships – Women's Singles\n\n2003 Wimbledon Championships – Women's Singles\n\n2004 Wimbledon Championships – Women's Singles\n\n2005 Wimbledon Championships – Women's Singles\n\n2006 Wimbledon Championships – Women's Singles\n\n2007 Wimbledon Championships – Women's Singles\n\n2008 Wimbledon Championships – Women's Singles\n\n2009 Wimbledon Championships – Women's Singles\n\n2010 Wimbledon Championships – Women's Singles\n\n2011 Wimbledon Championships – Women's Singles\n\n2012 Wimbledon Championships – Women's Singles\n\n2013 Wimbledon Championships – Women's Singles\n\n2014 Wimbledon Championships – Women's Singles\n\nAs you can see he removed the redundant flags in the draw boxes... only using them in the first column, but using flagathlete instead of flagicon. I don't have a problem with this either way, but I think I would also like the flags in the quarterfinal first columns also if it were to be changed. He also changed the main seeds to flagathlete. Do we need flagathlete and these other changes?... NO. You could easily argue if it ain't broke don't fix it. Is it better esthetically or more coherent?... that is a matter of opinion and it's why I ask everyone to comment. I don't care as long as it's the consensus as to what we will be doing for thousands and thousands of draws and player articles. You'll note that the article 2013 Wimbledon Championships – Women's Singles has an additional item below the draw. A flag key. With an added flag key to the draws we could keep them as they are now (with flagicon) and give those that want it the full names of every country by clicking the flag key. That's just another way to do it other than adding flagathlete to every player. It is an interesting adjustment to the draw though in keeping the flags isolated to the first column... one I hadn't thought of before so think on all the ramifications and please express your thoughts here. Thanks and happy editing. Fyunck(click) (talk)\n\nDoes the floating question mark above the Olympic 3-digit country code should jump to the flag key? (It doesn't for me) If not than what is the purpose of the question mark? Lajbi Holla @ me • CP\n\nThat would be cool if it did, but no. I have no idea what the heck the floating ? is. Strange. I had put the flag key in BEFORE before it was changed to flagathlete as a way to keep flagicon yet allow those without mouseover ability to see the full country listed with the flags. It was just another option to try. But now that you mention that floating ?... clicking on the flagathlete 3 letter code or the flag does absolutely nothing! Zip! Hovering on the often useless country code gives the full country name. When we use the standard flagicon, hovering over the flag gives the same full country name, but clicking on the flag gives the added bonus of forwarding a person to the wikipedia country article. So we gain 3 letters but lose that country forwarding with flagathlete. Like I said, if everyone loves this new way better I can live with it. I would probably prefer the actual draws the old way with flagicon on all, and the seeds with no flags at all since they have flags in the draw. The flag key template was simply something I whipped up that could certainly be improved upon. I wish it was smaller in width but my coding skills are kinda poor. Fyunck(click) (talk)\n\nPros and cons. The advantage of the removal of some flags from the draws would save bytes, which is always a main goal. On the other hand one have to \"track down\" e.g. a GS finalist nationality all the way back to the first round, which is annyoing. Changing all articles will take an immense time so I will only support it if there's other advantages for it. Right now it's annyoing>bytes. I will also check when the change has been made to the Flagathlete template code and maybe we'll get a better view on the idea behind of the \"?\" mark. I think it would function better if it jumped to the flag key. That way it'd still save bytes because one nation's flag would appear only once and would keep the player's nationality within sight in the same time with the help of the 3-digit. Others agree with me/us? Lajbi Holla @ me • CP\n\nTwo things. Imho the country codes only help for some countries as they can be confusing in their own right. The full country names would help but there is rarely room. Even with the country code some of the Wimbledon charts have names that crush the tiny boxes into another row. As for having to trace the flag all the way back that could be alleviated somewhat by showing the flag at the beginning of the quarterfinal draw, at least in Major tournaments. In the tournaments with 5 or 6 rounds without the extra quarterfinal bracket, then yes you'd have to trace all the way back. Fyunck(click) (talk)\n\nI think there is no need to change the current draw system. As Fyunck(click) said, it's more coherent and, at the end of the day, it's nice to watch. Yesterday editor tried to simplify draw for reader saying reader doesn't need to click on the flag to know which country it is (using Flagathlete in Seeds section and in Draw too). Today he's continue to dally with flagremoving. Maybe he should play on other pages? Arbeit10 (talk)\n\nThe flagathlete template was changed in March from a hyperlink to a tooltip and the main argument for that change was to prevent overlinking. I use the hoovercards and moving the mouse over the country code brought up a popup with concise info about the country in question. It also does this with the flag when using flagicons. The tooltips are a step in the wrong direction in that sense but the overlinking argument is in itself a valid one. --Wolbo (talk)\n\nI was just having a look around some tennis articles and was surprised at the lack of articles maintained by this project which have good article status, let alone featured article. There are certainly some of this quality which could do with being nominated. I'm planning on nominating Andy Murray for GA but I just thought I'd bring it up as, for example, I think Djokovic and Nadal could probably get GA status and Federer could be looked at for FA status. There are probably many other pages but I just thought I'd bring up these ones as a few examples.Username of a generic kind (talk)\n\nI think for many, the rings and hoops one has to jump through to get to FA aren't worth it. Many articles are great articles no matter the labels that get put on them. Good luck. Fyunck(click) (talk)\n\nI remember requesting a peer review for Giorgio de Stefani back in the days then it got no response then it got relisted with zero feedback again then it got scratched without any comments. Then I remember several editors tried to push the 2011 Novak Djokovic tennis season article in team work to FA but it received reviews about it having a \"wrong article title\" and such nonsense. The last effort was made by Wolbo (kudos) who made the 1877 Wimbledon Championship promoted to Good Article. But I guess it has something to do with the probability that no other editor owns those dozen rare tennis books it uses. I experienced myself that reviewing editors just aren't that picky when they lack the backgound knowledge or access to sources and all they can check is the grammar, which is disappointing. The fact that e.g. the Ante Pavelić non-tennis article failed to pass GA tells all about the \"process\". It was that time I turned my attention to the DYK project and worked there instead. But I'm happy to help if you need assisstance in one of those articles you've mentioned. Lajbi Holla @ me • CP\n\nI am proposing that we keep results from the WTA Tier I events in the performance timelines of retired players but remove them from the performance timelines of active players for the following reasons:\n\nThe Tier I events have been replaced by the WTA Premier Mandatory and/or Premier 5 events so only the latter two types of events should be included as they reflect the current structure of the WTA Tour.\n\nMost of the Tier I events (with the exception of a few) have retained their status as \"masters\" tournaments as they are part of the Premier Mandatory or Premier 5 event categories anyway.\n\nSome of the Tier I events e.g. Berlin are no longer held whilst others such as Charleston and Moscow have been demoted to Premier status, so their inclusion in the performance timelines of active players could confuse readers that are new to the topic of tennis. The inclusion of discontinued tournaments such as Berlin would also be redundant as they no longer exist.\n\nThe general consensus seems to be that Tier I events should not be included in performance timelines as the vast majority of articles on wikipedia tend to have performance timelines that include Premier Mandatory and Premier 5 results but omit Tier I events. This has been the norm for quite some time now.\n\nSome readers may question why some active players have Tier I results included whilst others do not, so removing the WTA Tier I events would encourage consistency across the board and would also be the logical option given the current structure of the tour – younger players cannot obtain results from Tier I events as their \"masters\" results will come from the Premier Mandatory and Premier 5 events.\n\nEliminating the Tier I events from performance timelines would keep this table as clear and concise as possible as these charts tend to be placed in \"career statistics\" articles, which tend to be quite lengthy and detailed as well.\n\nA few other notes\n\nWTA Tier I events should remain in the performance timelines of retired players such as Lindsay Davenport as these tournaments were relevant when she was most active, and she cannot obtain results from Premier Mandatory or Premier 5 events (the current structure of the WTA Tour) as she is no longer active.\n\nIf players have won and/or finished as runner-up at a WTA Tier I event, these results should remain within their career finals tables and \"masters\" finals tables for obvious reasons.\n\nWhat does everyone else think about this proposal? If there is consensus to remove the WTA Tier I tournaments from performance timelines, then I will add to this to the project's article guidelines. JayJ47 (talk)\n\nHmmm... my first inclination would be to say \"I don't agree.\" We have the performance timelines to indicate how a player does in the biggest tournaments of their generation... regardless of what they are called. Today for the ladies those are the Majors, Premier Mandatory&5, YEC, Olympics, Fed Cup. But before then it was the Tier 1 events. My thinking is that if they overlap in a players' career we would show both unless a player didn't enter them at all. Why would you think it would be that difficult for our readers? If some feel it is, we could always add a sentence to the mandatory performance key. It already has NMS. Right now our standard is to include only a Grand Slam tournament performance chart on a player's main page, and the full chart on the Career Statistics page. I think the Tier 1 events fit ok on the Career Statistics page but maybe I'm alone in this. Fyunck(click) (talk)\n\nIsn't it a bit ambiguous to say we should remove them from active players and keep them for retired players. Say, for example, your proposal goes ahead and we remove them from active players such as Serena Williams. When she retires do we then add her Tier 1 events back in or leave them missing, even though they were relevant when she was playing them? For what it's worth, I'd also be against this anyway for the same reasons stated above although I'm probably not the best person for an opinion on this as I don't do much editing to WTA players articles. Username of a generic kind (talk)\n\nIt was just an idea. The main reasons why I'm proposing this is because I think it's a bit redundant to include tournaments (irrespective of their status) that do not reflect the current structure of the WTA Tour and that are no longer held in performance timelines. Like I've said before, most of the Tier I events have retained their masters status by being categorised as \"Premier Mandatory\" and \"Premier 5\" events, so if the Tier I events were to be removed, then we'd only be losing results from a few tournaments such as Berlin and Moscow. As for your comment on Serena Williams, that's a good point that I hadn't considered before. In cases like hers, I'd still be in favour of keeping just her results from the Premier Mandatory and Premier 5 events, as this would reflect the most recent structure of the WTA Tour. So I guess my main argument would be to have performance timelines reflect the most recent structure of the WTA Tour, as I personally feel that this would be most beneficial to the vast majority of readers who are probably only interested in finding out the results of an active player during this particular day and age. I'm not saying I'm completely right though and I stress that my proposal is merely a suggestion not an affirmation of something that is set stone and about to be implemented. JayJ47 (talk)\n\n@JayJ47, confused readers can search on Wiki for extra information about what, why & when. There is no need of removing, we can keep it in this way of thinking - Dementieva's performance timeline - just in another subsection. Arbeit10 (talk)\n\nI disagree with JayJ47's comments. Keeping just the tournaments in the performance timeline that are part of the current structure while leaving out older tournaments of the same standing and importance is a textbook case of recentism. The example of Dementieva's performance timeline mentioned above is also far from ideal. It anachronistically misrepresents the editions of certain tournaments up to 2008 (e.g. Indian Wells and Key Biscayne) as WTA Premier Mandatory tournaments while they were in fact Tier I tournaments. And in doing so it also misrepresents the number of Tier I tournaments during that period. --Wolbo (talk)\n\nI propose to merge the article Grand slam champions who saved match points (from 2000) into the List of Grand Slam related tennis records and remove the 'from 2000' limitation. This was already proposed in 2012 by MakeSense64 but got no reactions which is why I am posting it here. I see no reason or justification for having a separate article on this specific Grand Slam statistic and it clearly fits the scope of the Grand Slam related tennis records article. In my view we already have too many tennis records and statistics articles and would do well to limit that list to make it less confusing to our readers. This could be an easy start to that. Thoughts? --Wolbo (talk)\n\nI would agree. Fyunck(click) (talk)\n\nGrand slam champions who saved match points (from 2000) has been merged into List of Grand Slam related tennis records.--Wolbo (talk)\n\nI have a difference of opinion with another editor on what we should do when a notable men's event is joined with a non-notable ladies event. Per our guidelines the ladies section is not notable so it's inclusion should be voided. There was a discussion of this at Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Astra Italy Tennis Cup where the ladies $10,000 ITF event had actually broken off to form a separate article. It was agreed to merge it with the mens event to at least list the ladies champions. I'm not sure this was ideal to list the gals non-notable winners but there aren't all that many of these dual-level joined events, so a list of winners seemed no big deal as a compromise. Now it appears we have another of the same things at the 2014 Tampere Open. The men's event is a challenger event while for the women its the non-notable lowest level ITF event. I have the same issues as I did with the former discussion, but again, since they are rare, to have a list of the non-notable ladies winners seemed no big deal. BUT... not with separate non-notable draw articles for ladies doubles and singles as has been done at 2014 Tampere Open – Women's Doubles and 2014 Tampere Open – Women's Singles. To me that's gone too far against our Guidelines. I redirected the articles but they were redirected back. Do we want to tighten up our guideline wordage to make sure this doesn't keep happening or do we want to change our guidelines to allow these articles? As I said, I can live with the Ladies champions being listed on the main article page (but even that is really against our guidelines as they stand now) but to include draw page articles for the non-notable event seems way over the top unless rules are changed. Fyunck(click) (talk)\n\nI completely agree with everything you're saying. The winners can be listed on the tournament page as the tournament itself is notable so there's nothing wrong with having them there. The draw pages should definitely be removed as they are stand alone articles with no notability. I think just an extra sentence in the tennis notability guidelines explaining this should suffice. Username of a generic kind (talk)\n\nIf the women's event is indeed not notable per our guidelines then logically there should be no separate draw articles such as 2014 Tampere Open – Women's Doubles and 2014 Tampere Open – Women's Singles. I see no reason for creating them. The presence of a notable men's event does not in itself lend notability to the women's event.--Wolbo (talk)\n\nOf course I see it differently but can't say more than I already have done at User talk:Fyunck(click)#Not happy. Jared Preston (talk)\n\nBecause my talk page gets deleted from time to time it's probably best if I post your keys points here for others to consider since they are reasonable concerns. You had said:\n\nI hope that works for you Jared. While I don't agree with it, they are points worth noting in this discussion. Fyunck(click) (talk)\n\nThat's very forthcoming, thank you. Obviously I spend a lot of time editing on the ITF tour events, and I'm very much an inclusionist. The line has to be drawn somewhere, so I'm not alluding to creating drawsheets or articles on all sub-$50,000 tournaments, as is done on the Italian Wikipedia (crazy, and what a mess too!), but when a larger event such as one on the Challenger Tour is organised with women's events too, I (stubbornly, maybe) cannot see why the women's events shouldn't be included. Just like at Grand Slams, we have the junior draws – and I'm well aware of the difference that a winner of a junior slam is notable whereas the winner of an ITF sub-50k tournament isn't, but my argument is about all the events at what is otherwise a notable tournament. In fact I created these to be comprehensive, even though I understand the refutations. It's not that I feel completely exonerated in this position, but other members of the tennis project have even helped with updating the scores of the events in question, so they are of interest to some people even if others are against. Anyway, that's the way I see it and it's always good to have dialogue. Jared Preston (talk)\n\nThe Women's tennis article I think needs additional help any would be welcome. Dwanyewest (talk)\n\nMeh, why do we need an article for Women's tennis? --Stryn (talk)\n\nI think that is the question that first needs to be answered. I am not (yet) convinced that we need a separate article for women's tennis, anymore than we need one for men's tennis. I realize other sports have separate articles for women but the situations are largely different. In many of those sports the women only started participating at a (much) later date and/or don't have the same coverage and attention as the men. In comparison in tennis the women's game has been an integral part of the sport since almost the very beginning (even if it didn't always have equal footing) and this is reflected in our tennis articles. Also we already have the ATP and WTA articles that cover the men's and women's tours respectively.--Wolbo (talk)\n\nAny thoughts from other editors as to whether we should have a separate Women's tennis article or not?--Wolbo (talk)\n\nI'd say no. Women's Tennis Association suffices. Username of a generic kind (talk)\n\nHello, WikiProject Tennis.\n\nI looked at a few articles (ex Maria Sharapova and Roger Federer), and something in the infobox struck me as odd. Under \"Other tournaments\" we have either \"Championships\" or \"Tour Finals\". Thanks to the wikilinks I now know what that meant in this context, but on the face of it, it looks weird, perhaps more so (for me) since english is not my first language and I don´t know that much about tennis.\n\nI realize that Championships/Tour Finals can be practical because they´re short, but would it benefit readers in general to have the longer description, or a clearer (if that´s possible) abbrevation in the infobox? Gråbergs Gråa Sång (talk)\n\nGood point. I understand the desire to keep the tournament name on a single line in the infobox. If possible it is preferable. The \"Tour Finals\" label for the men is fine, accurate and unambiguous, but the women's label \"Championships\" is way too ambiguous and therefore confusing and needs to be changed. A logical option could be \"WTA Championship\". Another option is to use \"Tour Finals\" just like the men if that is considered generic enough or, alternatively, \"Year-end Finals\" for both the men's and women's tournaments. I tried the last option and it does fit on a single line.--Wolbo (talk)\n\nThanks for talking! You say that \"Tour Finals\" is unambiguous. It doesn´t seem that way to me, since Tour Finals/ATP World Tour Finals and the four tournaments above that in the infobox are all described as \"tennis tournaments\". But then again, I may not really know what I´m talking about here, so I´ll trust what you say. Gråbergs Gråa Sång (talk)\n\nYes they are all tennis tournaments but they are placed in different categories (Grand Slam, Other tournaments) to clarify the distinction. And \"Tour Finals\" is both distinctive and descriptive which makes it unambiguous, in contrast to the generic label \"Championships\" which could apply to any tennis tournament. Given that the WTA Tour Championships will be renamed to WTA Finals per the 2014 edition it makes sense to change the \"Championships\" label to \"Tour Finals\".--Wolbo (talk)\n\nI proposed the change on the infobox template talk page. Please add any feedback there.--Wolbo (talk)\n\nThe label for the field WTA Championships has been updated from \"Championships\" to \"Tour Finals\".--Wolbo (talk)\n\nWhilst I'm here, I'd quite like to make a suggestion about something which I've thought about a few times before. We have Category:Hopman Cup competitors, so why not have categories for Davis Cup and Fed Cup competitors? Broken down into competitors by country, I know that would mean a lot of new categorisation for starts, but any tennis player correctly placed in these categories would confirm they are notable by project standards. It works well on the German Wikipedia, as can be seen at de:Kategorie:Davis-Cup-Spieler and de:Kategorie:Fed-Cup-Spielerin and works quite well for comprehensive categorising of tennis players who have represented their country internationally. Other sportspeople are categorised similarly too (Category:United States men's international soccer players, Category:Germany international footballers, Category:Canada men's national ice hockey team players etc etc.)... so would anyone counter this idea? Jared Preston (talk)\n\nSounds like a good idea, it's significant enough to warrant a separate category. A while back I thought about creating a category for Davis Cup / Fed Cup winners but didn't act on it. Could become a subcategory of David Cup / Fed Cup players. In contrast I'm not convinced that participating in a Hopman Cup competition is significant enough to warrant a Category:Hopman Cup competitors.--Wolbo (talk)\n\nTheir is a request open to change the name of the Grand Prix Championship Series article to Grand Prix Super Series. Comments are welcome.--Wolbo (talk)\n\nThe RM has been relisted to allow more feedback.--Wolbo (talk)\n\nExcluding Grand Slam tennis tournaments, are there notability criteria about the other tournaments played from 1877 to 1968, namely before the Open era of tennis?--Matlab1985 (talk)\n\nGood question. The Article Guidelines don't give any guidance on this and that shortcoming should be addressed. The pre-Open era non-Grand Slam tournaments that are currently handled as notable are the team competitions Davis Cup, Federation Cup and Wightman Cup and we have pre-1968 articles for those. Almost all other tournaments do not currently have year articles going back further than 1968 with a few exceptions like the Trofeo Conde de Godó which has some year articles from the 1950s. Other tournaments, like the Pacific Southwest Championships, have a navbox at the bottom of the page with links to their pre-1968 editions but, as yet, no pre-1968 year articles for those tournaments exist. In my view the present situation, where at least 95% of all tournament articles are Open era, is unbalanced and amounts to recentism. Pre-Open era tournaments mostly did not have all the best players (they excluded the professionals) but that does not mean they are not notable, certainly not by definition. To address this unbalance we could add a simple guideline stating that if a certain tournament is notable in the Open era all pre-Open era editions of that tournament are notable as well and articles for those editions can be created (provided that reliable sources are available). This does not cover everything but it would be a decent starting point. In the absence of explicit guidelines as always it is best to just use common sense.--Wolbo (talk)\n\nI would probably use the term \"usually\" in the sentence \"all pre-Open era editions of that tournament are <usually> notable as well\" It's a little more subjective back then. Or possibly start it with \"As a general rule of thumb...\" I think Wolbo's addition is a good place to start because it is pretty unbalanced as it stands. Usually the biggest events were the tournaments named after their nation... the Irish championships, the Scottish championships, but many of those exist today with slight name changes. I would think that most older tournaments listed in Tennis Archives would be notable. Fyunck(click) (talk)\n\nHow about: \"If a certain tournament is notable in the Open era all pre-Open era editions of that tournament can be considered notable as well if supported by reliable sources.\"--Wolbo (talk)\n\nMembers of this project may be interested in participating in Talk:Grand Prix Championship Series#Requested move. Jenks24 (talk)\n\nHi I came across this name refering to a WCT \"Triple Crown Concept\" from the New York Times in 1981 found here: http://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/01 whilst looking for sources for the discussion regarding the GP championships series RM. I also came across the term being used on the GP tour in from the London Telegraph Newspaper in 1977 found here: London Telegraph July 26 1977., this from the Saraosta Herald Newspaper in 1976 stating the French Open, Wimbledon and Forest Hills as \"Triple Crown\" events: Saraosta Herald Jan 23 1976 does anyone know anything about this and can you please share your knowledge. --Navops47 (talk)\n\nEarly reference here from the Sydney Morning Hearld in 1975:Sydney Morning Herald Nov 5 1975 applied to Majors but this diversifies later on the tour to included a combination of Slam and non-slam events. There are also references to the name regarding the womens tour found her in January 1977 Valley News .\n\nI've been noticing a new template being employed by an editor (Vencin)... especially on yearly articles. There seem to have been a whole bunch of templates made based on Template:Tennis sm match. Maybe it loads better or codes smaller, but for some reason it's uncomfortable for me to work with. If everyone loves it then I guess I'll just have to learn how to cope with fixing incorrect scores and such. Examples would be, original coding 2013 Novak Djokovic tennis season new coding 2014 Novak Djokovic tennis season. Andy Murray and Nadal 2014 season have been changed to this formatting, but the Roger Federer 2014 season isn't affected yet, but I'm"
