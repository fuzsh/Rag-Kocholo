        "text": "2023 ACC Football Championship Game Information\n\n2023 ACC Football Championship Game Tickets\n\nCHARLOTTE, N.C. (theACC.com) – The Florida State Seminoles clinched a spot in the 2023 ACC Football Championship Game with their win over the Pitt Panthers on Saturday. The nationally ranked Seminoles are 9-0 overall and 7-0 in ACC play this season.\n\nIt is the Seminoles' sixth trip to the ACC Football Championship Game and the first since 2014 (2005, 2010, 2012, 2013 and 2014) when they won their third consecutive ACC Championship title with a 37-35 win over Georgia Tech.\n\nThe 2023 ACC Football Championship Game will kick off at 8 p.m. on ABC on Saturday, Dec. 2, at Bank of America Stadium in Charlotte, North Carolina. This is the 14th time in the last 15 years that the game will be held in primetime.\n\nTickets to the 2023 ACC Football Championship Game are on sale via Ticketmaster.com and through the ACC’s official website at theACC.com.\n\nAs the first team to clinch a spot in the championship game, Florida State’s bench will be on the north side of the field, while the second team to clinch will be on the south side.\n\nThe 2023 ACC Football Championship Game will feature the top two teams based on the highest winning percentage in regular-season conference play. If necessary, the league’s tiebreaker policy will be used to determine the participants.\n\nRanked No. 4 in the first College Football Playoff (CFP) rankings on Tuesday, Oct. 31, the Seminoles have been ranked all season long in both the Associated Press and USA TODAY Sports AFCA Coaches top 25 polls, including nine consecutive weeks ranked in the top five of the AP Top 25 poll.\n\nThe Seminoles have three games remaining this season, including their final conference matchup of the year versus Miami on Saturday, Nov. 11, in Tallahassee, Florida.\n\nIn 2018, the ACC, Charlotte Sports Foundation, and Carolina Panthers announced a 10-year agreement to keep the ACC Football Championship Game in Charlotte through the 2030 season. The game is played annually at Bank of America Stadium on the first Saturday in December.\n\nNot including the 2020 game, which had limited attendance due to the pandemic, ACC Football Championship Games played at Bank of America Stadium have had an average attendance of nearly 70,000 fans. The game’s attendance record is 74,514 for the 2015 contest between Clemson and North Carolina, which also set an attendance record for Bank of America Stadium at the time.\n\nThe winner of the conference championship game has gone on to play in the National Championship Game or compete in the College Football Playoff in eight of the last 10 seasons, including two teams in 2020. The ACC has the second-most CFP appearances of all time of any conference.\n\nACC fans of all ages can take part in festivities surrounding the 2023 ACC Football Championship Game, including Fan Fest, which will take place in uptown Charlotte at Romare Bearden Park on Friday, Dec. 1, from 3-9 p.m. and Saturday, Dec. 2, from 10 a.m.-7 p.m. Free and open to the public, fans can enjoy pre-game fun with appearances by ACC Mascots, tailgate games, giveaways, and more!"
