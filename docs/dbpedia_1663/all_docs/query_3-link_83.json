        "text": "Roman Reigns’ reign as WWE Champion was dominant to say the least, but the longest reign of the modern era finally came to an end at the hands of Cody Rhodes at WrestleMania 40. But how exactly how many days was Roman Reigns WWE Champion?\n\nPrior to his record run, Roman Reigns first won the WWE Universal Championship on August 19th 2018 at SummerSlam, pinning Brock Lesnar to avenge the loss against ‘The Beast’ earlier in the year at WrestleMania 36.\n\nUnfortunately, Reigns’s grip on the title was cut short due to a re-diagnosis of Leukaemia. During an episode of Raw on October 22nd 2018, he vacated the championship after 64 days in an emotional address to the live crowd. The WWE Universe were left wondering when, or even if, they would see ‘The Big Dog’ again.\n\nOn February 25th 2019, Reigns made his return to Raw to a huge ovation, revealing his leukaemia was once again in remission. Later that night, Reigns and Seth Rollins came to the aid of former Shield ally Dean Ambrose, thwarting an attack by Bobby Lashley, Drew McIntyre, Baron Corbin and Elias.\n\nFollowing a brief reformation of The Shield, Reigns was drafted to SmackDown and announced as “SmackDown’s greatest ever acquisition”.\n\nWhen did Roman Reigns become WWE Universal Champion?\n\nDuring the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, Reigns stepped away from the ring to focus on his health but returned to attack newly-crowned Universal Champion The Fiend at SummerSlam 2020.\n\nAt WWE Payback on August 30th 2020, Roman Reigns defeated The Fiend and Braun Strowman in a No Holds Barred Triple Threat match to win the WWE Universal Championship for the second time, starting his long and commanding reign.\n\nSince then ‘The Tribal Chief’ has obtained the services of Paul Heyman as his Special Counsel, and joined forces with The Usos to rule SmackDown with an iron fist.\n\nHow many days was Roman Reigns WWE Champion?\n\nRoman Reigns was WWE Universal Champion, and later Undisputed Champion, for 1,316 days, successfully defending the championship against all challengers, including Drew McIntyre, Rey Mysterio, John Cena and Goldberg, among many others.\n\nOn January 16th 2022, Reigns surpassed Brock Lesnar’s record of 504 days to become the longest reigning WWE Universal Champion and the sixth longest world title reign in WWE history.\n\nFollowing a long feud throughout the ‘Road To WrestleMania’, Reigns defeated Brock Lesnar at WrestleMania 38 in a match billed as the ‘biggest WrestleMania match of all time’ to win the WWE Championship for the fourth time.\n\nVictory over Lesnar added another achievement to Reigns’s incredible run, becoming the first WWE Superstar to hold both the WWE Championship and WWE Universal Championship simultaneously.\n\nAfter this, Roman Reigns’ dominant run only continued. His next challenger for the combined titles (henceforth known as the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship) was against “King of Bros” Matt Riddle, whom Reigns dispatched in just under seventeen minutes on the June 17th, 2022 episode of SmackDown. The champion’s evening was not done yet, however, as he was attacked by a returning Brock Lesnar in the post-match. This sparked the Reigns/Lesnar rivalry anew, and led to a Last Man Standing match at SummerSlam on July 30th, 2022.\n\nReigns emerged victorious over Lesnar once again, but the victory certainly didn’t come easy. To defeat Brock Lesnar at SummerSlam 2022, Roman Reigns had to call on assistance from his cousins the Usos. The trio buried “The Beast” under a mess of broken announce table parts, steel chairs and more, before Reigns stood on top of the carnage to ensure the ten count. This would end their seven-year long feud. At the time of writing, the two have not met in-ring since this match.\n\nThe next challenge for Roman Reigns appeared in the shape of Scotsman Drew McIntyre, who challenged Roman Reigns for the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship at Clash at the Castle. With the event being held in the United Kingdom, Drew McIntyre had the crucial “home advantage,” but it was still not enough to overcome Reigns, who managed to defeat McIntyre after help from a debuting Solo Sikoa.\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, Roman Reigns’ next title defence pitted him against an unconventional challenger: YouTube sensation Logan Paul. Despite Paul’s relatively brief stint in WWE, he had already made waves by securing victories against established names like The Miz and the formidable duo of Rey & Dominik Mysterio. Reigns met Logan Paul at Crown Jewel in Saudi Arabia, and though it was a hard-fought bout from both sides, Roman Reigns was once again announced as the victor.\n\nThe Undisputed WWE Universal Championship was not defended again until over two months later, at January 2023’s Royal Rumble. This defence hiatus was due to Roman Reigns and The Bloodline’s participation (and subsequent triumph) in a War Games encounter during Survivor Series 2022. At the aforementioned Royal Rumble event, Reigns showcased his dominance once again by defeating Kevin Owens in a nineteen-minute bout, aided by Sami Zayn‘s unwilling interference.\n\nHowever, the Royal Rumble drama would soon take an even more dramatic turn in the post-match. Sami Zayn, formerly aligned with The Bloodline, would shock the WWE Universe by betraying his “Tribal Chief,” whacking him in the back with a steel chair. The live crowd erupted in an electrifying response to this twist. A Zayn babyface turn had been teased for a long time, thus they were delighted to see it come to fruition.\n\nSami Zayn’s defiance against the Bloodline leader positioned him as the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship’s next contender at Elimination Chamber 2023. But alas, like those before him, Zayn failed to dethrone Reigns from his championship pedestal. Reigns escaped from the Montreal event with his perfect record unscathed.\n\nAfter dispatching Sami Zayn, Roman Reigns was soon faced with another daunting challenge. WrestleMania 39 saw him square off against the resilient Royal Rumble 2023 victor, “The American Nightmare” Cody Rhodes, who had been on an impressive streak following a horrendous injury to his pectoral muscle. However, Cody Rhodes could not overcome The Bloodline’s dirty tactics. Echoing the pattern seen in Reigns’ clash against Drew McIntyre, Solo Sikoa once again appeared as Roman Reigns’ advantage. Sikoa’s intervention tilted the balance of the match, securing yet another victory for Reigns in the WrestleMania Night 2 Main Event.\n\nNow well over 1,000 days into his championship reign, “The Tribal Chief” would spend the next couple of Premium Live Events in tag matches, teaming with Solo Sikoa, as the Bloodline dissolved even further with the alienation of The Usos.\n\nIn the main event of SummerSlam 2023, Reigns faced off in an epic thirty-six-minute bout against cousin Jey Uso. Just when it looked as though Jey Uso was about to defeat Reigns and lift the Undisputed Universal WWE Championship, he was betrayed by his brother, Jimmy Uso. In this moment of opportunity, Reigns capitalized on the chaos, emerging victorious and retaining his championship.\n\nFollowing his victory over Jey, Reigns took some away from television. He returned two months later to confront John Cena, who was feuding with Jimmy and Sikoa, to tell him he would refuse a title challenge. However, Cena revealed it was not him who was challenging Reigns for the title, because LA Knight was.\n\nDuring Reigns’ absence, Knight had become one of the company’s most popular stars and was more than ready to insert himself into the champion’s business, which is exactly what he did. Knight was then beaten down by Reigns resulting in a title match between the two at Crown Jewel 2023.\n\nThe title bout headlined the show in Saudi Arabia and as per usual Reigns successfully defended the title with the help of his family. The victory marked Reigns’ third consecutive retention of the Universal Championship at Crown Jewel, and his second with the WWE Championship.\n\nThe champion then took another extended break from the road and allowed Jimmy and Sikoa to continue to deal with Knight, who claimed he was not finished with Reigns or his title. A returning Randy Orton and AJ Styles, who were both taken out of action by the Bloodline, were also gunning for The Head of the Table.\n\nReigns returned to SmackDown: New Year’s Revolution on January 5, 2024, to find himself with all three as opponents at Royal Rumble. Despite being disadvantaged, Reigns ensured he finished the match with his historic championship run intact with Sikoa on hand to interfere on his behalf and aid him in his win.\n\nThat same night Cody Rhodes won his second Royal Rumble match in succession and made it immediately clear his WrestleMania 40 opponent was to be The Tribal Chief. However, just when it seemed as though the two enemies would meet in the main event on the Grandest Stage of Them All once again, Rhodes shockingly relinquished his title shot and allowed The Rock to take his place.\n\nThe fan backlash resulted in Rhodes reclaiming his right to face the champion at WrestleMania while The Rock turned heel and joined forces with his cousin. Together, the family stacked the odds against the American Nightmare and promised to end his story for him. Reigns watched as The Rock mercilessly beat and bloodied his ‘Maina opponent on the way to their tag team match at WrestleMania XL Saturday.\n\nAfter beating Rhodes and Seth Rollins in the biggest tag team match in WrestleMania history, Reigns went on to face Rhodes in a Bloodline Rules match on Sunday, April 7th, 2024 in Philadelphia in what would be his last outing as the Undisputed WWE Universal Champion.\n\nThe enthralling 30-minute-plus match was filled with drama and emotion as it was the culmination of a two-year-long storyline that ended Roman Reigns’ epic 1316-day Universal Championship reign."
