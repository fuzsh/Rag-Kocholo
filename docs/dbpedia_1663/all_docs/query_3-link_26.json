        "text": "Dangerous weather conditions from remnants of Hurricane Debby have originally forced tournament organizers at the 2024 Wyndham Championship to bar fans from entering the property to watch the first round of the tournament Thursday at Sedgefield Country Club in Greensboro, North Carolina.\n\nThat announcement, which came Wednesday evening, stated that the first round will start on time at 6:50 a.m. ET on Thursday and officials said that \"play will continue as long as conditions allow.\"\n\nThursday morning, a delay to the first round was announced, with the first tee shot not being expected till 3 p.m. ET.\n\nAbout six hours later, they called the entire first round off, as the PGA Tour sent a one-sentence update:\n\n\"The first round of the Wyndham Championship is postponed to Friday, August 9, due to Tropical Storm Debby. Updated first-round starting times will follow.\"\n\nFor those fans with tickets for Thursday, they can return any other day this week and use their ticket to get in.\n\n\"This decision was a difficult one for us to make with our partners at the PGA Tour, but everyoneâ€™s safety is our top priority,\" Tournament Director Bobby Powell said Wednesday in regards to fans not being allowed in. \"The most recent forecast looks like the storm could clear our area sometime Friday.\"\n\nThe Wyndham Championship is the final regular-season event on the PGA Tour's 2024 schedule."
