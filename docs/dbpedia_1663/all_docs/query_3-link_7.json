        "text": "Max Homa\n\nMax Homa kept hearing from his coach, caddie and other supporters that he needed to carry himself with more confidence, an attitude befitting a multiple PGA Tour winner.\n\n“All of a sudden last year I get in the top 50 in the world and you start looking around and it’s a new crop of people and you start thinking to myself, ‘Am I as good as these guys?'” Homa said. “So I’ve always struggled with it, but I have great people around me who bash me over the head telling me that I am that guy. I tried to walk around this week believing that and faking it a little bit until I made it.”\n\nThis marked his fourth win overall, third in 15 months and second Wells Fargo Championship victory in his last three starts. He joins Rory McIlroy, who has three wins, as a multiple champion of the event.\n\nHoma played solid, steady golf during a week of cold, wet conditions and a back-and-forth Sunday duel with Keegan Bradley, closing with a 2-under 68 for a two-shot victory.\n\nTPC Potomac, which last hosted the tour in 2018, held up well despite torrential rain on Friday and Saturday and unseasonably cold temperatures most of the week.\n\nBradley started the day with a two-shot lead, gave it away on the par-5 second hole and got it back on the par-4 eighth before Homa finally took command for good on the back nine. A bogey on the closing hole gave Bradley a 2-over 72 and a tie for second with Cameron Young and Matt Fitzpatrick.\n\nHoma, 31, won on Mother’s Day two weeks after he and wife Lacey announced they are expecting their first child, a boy.\n\n“Sometimes my life feels too good to be true, and this is one of those cases,” he said.\n\nFinal StandingsPosPlayerParR1R2R3R4Total1Max Homa-867667168272T2Matt Fitzpatrick-668687167274T2Cameron Young-668716966274T2Keegan Bradley-6706567722745Rory McIlroy-467736868276\n\nRory McIlroy\n\nRory McIlroy won when he least expected it and, in the process, collected his third Wells Fargo Championship at Quail Hollow Club.\n\nHis one-shot victory was his first in 18 months and only after he won, did he reveal a neck injury he sustained in a practice session that nearly caused him to withdraw from the tournament prior to starting his road to victory on Thursday.\n\nHe seized control Sunday afternoon with back-to-back birdies from the bunker down the stretch on holes 14 and 15. He admitted he did get ahead of himself thinking how cool it would be to see his wife and 8-month-old daughter waiting to celebrate with him on their first Mother’s Day.\n\nHowever, the finishing stretch at Quail Hollow snapped him back to reality. With a two-shot lead, he hit a 7-iron safely over the water on the 17th.\n\nBut on 18, his drive went left of the winding stream into a deep hole of shaggy grass near the water. He started to try to gouge it out toward the fairway when his caddie Harry Diamond stepped in to offer a few alternatives. Diamond wisely talked him into taking a penalty drop from a dangerous lie in a hazard on the closing hole. He two-putted from 45 feet for bogey, a 3-under 68 and a one-shot victory with a 10-under par 274 total.\n\n“This is one of my favorite places in the world,” said McIlroy, who picked up his first PGA TOUR title at Quail Hollow in 2010. “To break the drought and win here, it’s awesome.”\n\nIt was McIlroy’s 19th PGA TOUR career victory and 27th overall. He remains the only multiple winner of the Wells Fargo Championship. Abraham Ancer finished second at 9-under 275. It marked the fourth runner-up finish for the young, winless Mexican star.\n\nFinal StandingsPosPlayerParR1R2R3R4Total1Rory McIlroy-10726668682742Abraham Ancer-969707066275T3Viktor Hovland-869726867276T3Keith Mitchell-8677166722765Gary Woodland-767697071277\n\nMax Homa\n\nMax Homa, a talented player who had hit the depths of professional golf, showed a lot of mettle Sunday at the 17th Wells Fargo Championship by closing with a 4-under 67 to pull away from the field and win his first tournament on the PGA TOUR.\n\nHoma began the back nine with two birdies to build a four-shot lead and didn’t make any mistakes while Joel Dahmen saved par with a tough chip over the creek on the final hole at Quail Hollow Club for a 70 and finished three shots behind.\n\nThere was a lot of firepower chasing Homa on Sunday. Justin Rose finished alone in third with a final-round 68. Sergio Garcia (68), Rickie Fowler (68), Paul Casey (69) and Jason Dufner (73) all were tied for fourth. Two-time Wells Fargo Championship winner Rory McIlroy was tied for 8th.\n\nHoma, who won the NCAA title at Cal in 2013, won for the first time in his 68th start as a pro. The victory earned him a spot into the PGA Championship two weeks after Charlotte at Bethpage Black and an invitation to the Masters Tournament next April.\n\nThe first week in May was quite the turnaround for the 28-year-old Californian.\n\nHoma was at No. 829 in the world when he got his third crack at the PGA TOUR in October. Two seasons ago, he made only two cuts in 17 tournaments, missing the 54-hole cut in one of them and finishing last at an opposite-field event in the other. But he made six of seven cuts coming into the Wells Fargo Championship and played like he belonged.\n\n“Confidence takes a lot of anxiety away,” he said Saturday night as he prepared to play in the final group for the first time.\n\nHoma never flinched, effectively sealing it with a long shot up the hill and onto the green at the par-5 15th for a two-putt birdie, saving par to keep a three-shot lead going to the final hole and drilling his tee shot down the fairway. He wrapped it up with a 10-foot par putt to finish at 15-under 269.\n\n“Over the moon, man,” he said before going to sign his card. “It means a lot to do it under pressure, and job security is great. I haven’t had that.”\n\nThe victory was worth $1,422,000 — about $454,000 more than he had made in his previous 67 starts — and gave him a two-year exemption. Homa became the fifth player to make the Wells Fargo Championship his first PGA TOUR victory, joining Anthony Kim (2008), McIlroy (2010), Rickie Fowler (2012) and Derek Ernst (2013).\n\nFinal StandingsPosPlayerParR1R2R3R4Total1Max Homa-15696370672692Joel Dahmen-12666670702723Justin Rose-1170676868273T4Rickie Fowler-969736568275T4Sergio Garcia-971706668275\n\nJason Day\n\nThe 16th edition of the Wells Fargo Championship marked the return to Charlotte, NC and Quail Hollow Club.\n\nIt also was a positive step in the resurgence of former world No. 1 Jason Day. After a winless 2017, his win here was his second of the season and moved him from world No. 14 to No. 7. Although, he enjoyed a two-stroke cushion on the final hole and eventually won by that margin over 21-year-old South African Aaron Wise and five-time TOUR winner Nick Watney, it was not easy.\n\nHeading into the final round, Day held a two-stroke lead but a majority of his Sunday round was a struggle. He missed more than half the fairways, hit only eight greens in regulation and made four bogeys.\n\nAfter squandering a three-shot lead on the back nine and experiencing some self-doubt, Day toughed it out on the Green Mile, gathering inspiration from Lebron James’ buzzer-beater shot the night before against the Toronto Raptors in the NBA Playoffs. The 30-year-old rolled in a 20-foot birdie putt on the 16th hole and then effectively won the tournament when his 7-iron tee shot on the 230-yard, par-three 17th hole bounced four times before hitting the flagstick and settling 3 feet away. He was the only player to make birdie on No. 17 at Quail Hollow in the final round, and his two-stroke margin returned.\n\n“Things like that are what you need to win tournaments,” Day said. “That is what I am most happy about. When you are called on to do something good and you pull it off, to be clutch like that, with a lot of heart… I’m glad I watched Lebron James make that shot.”\n\nHe would finish the final round with a 2-under 69 and a 12-under 272. He also became only the second player in tournament history to record four sub-70 rounds, joining 2011 champion Lucas Glover.\n\n“It was one of the best wins I have ever had,” Day would say later. “I felt like I went 10 rounds out there just fighting against myself.”\n\nIt was Day’s 12th career victory on the PGA TOUR and his 11th win since he last competed here in 2012.\n\nWise, a PGA Tour rookie, saved par on his last two holes for a 68 and the best finish of his career so far. Watney made a 59-foot birdie putt on the last hole for a 69 and his best finish in three years.\n\nMeanwhile, Phil Mickelson made noise again on the weekend only to come up short in his bid to win the Wells Fargo Championship in his 15th attempt. With rounds of 72-72-64-69 for a T5 finish, Mickelson recorded his eighth top-five finish and 11th top-ten finish, the most for any player in tournament history. Mickelson also improved his career earnings at the Wells Fargo Championship to $3,310,223 keeping his spot at 2nd in all-time tournament money behind Rory McIlroy, who has earned $3,484,117.\n\nWith Day’s victory, the Wells Fargo Championship now has seven champions of its own who have also won major championships, including David Toms, Vijay Singh, Jim Furyk, Tiger Woods, Rory McIlroy and Lucas Glover. Count the two victories here by McIlroy and 8 of the 16 winners of this tournament through the years are also major championship winners.\n\nDay earned $1,386,000 and 500 FedExCup points with his victory. Perhaps more importantly, he took another step towards reaching his goal of being world No. 1 again.\n\n“When you’re walking around and there’s so many golfers in this world and you know that there’s no one better than you, that’s a pretty awesome feeling,” Day said. “I know the feeling and what it felt like to be No. 1 and I know what I had to do to get there. This is a good kick in the right direction, having two wins this kind of early in the season. My next step is to try to win a major this year.”\n\nFinal StandingsPosPlayerParR1R2R3R4Total1Jason Day-1269696769272T2Aaron Wise-1068687068274T2Nick Watney-10726766692744Bryson DeChambeau-875656670276T5Phil Mickelson-772726469277T5Paul Casey-769686971277T5Peter Uihlein-7727262712778Patrick Reed-671716769278T9Luke List-570726770279T9Samuel Saunders-570696872279T9Charl Schwrtzel-570677072279T9Emiliano Grillo-568717168279\n\nBrian Harman\n\nWith World No.1 Dustin Johnson and Pat Perez sitting in the clubhouse tied for the lead, Georgia’s Brian Harman put on a show during his final two holes that will likely be remembered for decades in the coastal town of Wilmington, NC.\n\nFor the first time since 1971 the PGA TOUR returned to the eastern part of the state and the 5-foot-7 Harman, born on the coast in Savannah, electrified a sellout crowd at Eagle Point Golf Club on a brilliant Carolina Sunday afternoon.\n\nTrailing by one shot with two holes to play, Harman birdied the 17th hole to reach 9-under-par for the tournament and move into a tie with the two clubhouse leaders.\n\nOn the par-five 18th hole, Harman decided to go for the green on his second shot and get into a position for either eagle or birdie to take the lead and likely win the tournament. His shot landed wide-left of the green near a live oak tree. His third shot was a tough one.\n\n“Well, I didn’t hit a great chip, but I didn’t hit a horrible chip, either,” he explained later. “I had some tree limbs. I needed to go vertical with it. I had a good lie to go vertical with it and it would have been no problem, but I couldn’t keep it up underneath those limbs, so I was kind of caught in between. If you get something that’s too low, it’s going to run through, which I wasn’t too afraid of that because I at least had an uphill putt coming back. But I did my best there and it didn’t turn out very good, but I guess it was right where it was supposed to be.”\n\nHarman, along with several other players from the Sea Island area, had made a trip to Eagle Point Golf Club two weeks prior to the tournament. He fell in love with the course and knew coming in that he could do well.\n\nAs he stood over his ball for a 28-foot birdie putt, he also knew what he had to do to win. As his putt started downhill toward the hole and the crowd stood on its feet and started to cheer, Harman felt like he had a great chance for his second victory on the PGA TOUR. When the ball went straight into the cup, emotions took over.\n\nWith the Wilmington crowd cheering wildly, Harman screamed and threw his arm into the air multiple times in celebration.\n\n“I blacked out, I don’t know what happened” he said. “I can’t wait to watch it. I mean, I have no idea what happened. I don’t know what I did after the ball went into the hole.”\n\nWinning on the PGA TOUR is never easy. Johnson was making it seem that way. After opening with rounds of 70-75, the top player in the world, who grew up in nearby Columbia SC and attended Coastal Carolina just down the road from Wilmington, appeared to be human. But on the weekend, his pair of 67s moved him into a chance to win his fourth consecutive tournament.\n\nIn the end, he was one shot shy.\n\n“He’s a tough cookie, man,” said Harman. “Whatever he shot, 3 over in the second round and then the weekend he shoots 5 under and 5 under. He’s tough.”\n\nBut also in the end Harman did it his way.\n\n“Yeah, it’s surreal,” he said. “Just, you know, I three-putted that 15th hole. Knew it was going to be tough to birdie those last couple, but I stuck to my game plan and just did it, did the best I could.\n\n“It’s a lot of emotion, for sure. I’ve been fighting really hard. I thought I had a good chance a couple weeks ago at Harbour Town, really wanted that one. Yeah, I’ve been working really hard. This feels really good.\n\n“I think just having a little more belief in myself and just trusting that I’m pretty good at what I do and just trying to stay in the moment and do the best that I can.”\n\nFinal StandingsPosPlayerParR1R2R3R4Total1Brian Harman-1071697068278T2Dustin Johnson-970756767279T2Pat Perez-9726970682794Jon Rahm-869716971280T5Smylie Kaufman-770717268281T5Kevin Tway-772706970281T5Seung-Yul Noh-769746771281T8Jonathon Randolph-669737367282T8Billy Hurley III-670697271282T8Nick Taylor-671697171282T8Byeong Hun An-672706971282\n\nRory McIlroy\n\nRory McIlroy, the No.1 player in the world, had the best performance in Wells Fargo Championship history on his way to becoming the first repeat champion with his victory in 2015.\n\nThe 26-year-old Irishman, whose maiden PGA TOUR victory occurred at Quail Hollow Club in 2010, broke numerous records during his four-rounds in Charlotte under sunny and warm conditions. Perhaps the most important was the 18-hole masterpiece he played on Saturday when he took hopes of winning away from the rest of the contenders that included Charlotte’s Webb Simpson, Phil Mickelson and young guns Patrick Rodgers and Justin Thomas. In the third round he shot a blistering 11-under-par 61 to break his old 18-hole record of 62 and built a four-stroke lead that would never be challenged on Sunday.\n\nBy the time the final round was over, McIlroy not only had his 11th PGA TOUR title, but he had broken the 72-hole tournament scoring record by five strokes but won by seven strokes, the most in tournament history.\n\n“I am obviously delighted to get the win. You know, the way I played yesterday (Saturday) really set me up to go out there today,” said McIlroy after his second victory in three weeks of play. “I was in control of the golf tournament and I just needed to shoot a solid round and that was going to get me over the line”.\n\n“I accomplished a lot of things this week or the last few weeks”.\n\nFinal StandingsPosPlayerParR1R2R3R4Total1Rory McIlroy-2170676169267T2Patrick Rodgers-1468687068274T2Webb Simpson-1467676872274T4Phil Mickelson-1271667168275T4Gary Woodland-1270716867276T4Robert Streb-1265697171276T7Geoff Ogilvy-1169697168277T7Justin Thomas-1169736570277T9Jason Bohn-1072686969278T9Brendan Steele-1069696872278T9Kevin Streelman-1069717068278T9Shawn Stefani-1069707069278\n\nJ.B. Holmes\n\nOn his 71st hole of the Wells Fargo Championship, J.B. Holmes sank a 9-foot par putt that proved to be necessary and critical in securing a personal comeback and a victory that will long be remembered.\n\nIt was a beautiful day for golf and the thousands of fans who lined the fairway. And, it was an even better day for a wonderful story of perseverance and for one of the most popular players in the game.\n\nIt has been a long road back for the Kentucky native. Since his last victory in 2008, Holmes has endured two brain surgeries, a broken ankle that kept him away from competitive golf for a year and surgery for tennis elbow.\n\n“He worked so hard,” said Holmes’s wife Erica. “There were days he had to go to rehab twice, then to acupuncture, then to his workout. He’s worked so hard to get to where he is.”\n\nThe par putt provided the margin he needed as he stood over a 3-foot putt for bogey on the final hole in the fading sun. He made the putt and earned a one-stroke victory over past champion Jim Furyk and his first win on the PGA TOUR since 2008.\n\nHolmes said he felt confident over the putt at 17, a left-to-right breaker he faced after chipping short.\n\n“Yeah, that was huge,” said Holmes, who collected his third PGA Tour win. “It gave me a two shot lead going into the last hole, and then that was big. So I felt comfortable over that putt. I felt like I was going to make it, and I had a good stroke and it went in.”\n\nBut on Sunday, Holmes built a healthy enough margin over the first 15 holes to weather a pair of bogeys over the last three, a brutal finishing stretch known collectively as the Green Mile. Holmes finished with 71 for a 14-under-par total of 274, 1 shot better than Jim Furyk’s 13-under 275.\n\nOn this Sunday with large crowds and beautiful weather, Furyk provided much of the spark. He started the day 7 shots back but fired a 7-under-par 65 to become the clubhouse leader at 13-under-par and gain the attention of players in contention and still on the golf course.\n\nFinal StandingsPosPlayerParR1R2R3R4Total1J.B.

And once again Sunday was a special day.\n\nRickie Fowler, seeking his first win on the PGA TOUR, discovered something with in himself and earned a victory that became instantly popular among his peers.\n\nIn a three-way playoff that featured the tournament’s 2010 champion and the 2011 U.S. Open champion Rory McIlroy, the 23-year-old Fowler selected a 51-degree wedge that had to be perfect on the 18th hole at Quail Hollow that had allowed only four birdies on a beautiful Sunday in Charlotte.\n\nHitting second from the fairway, Fowler stuffed his approach shot within 4 feet for a birdie on the first extra hole to beat McIlroy and D.A. Points for the victory. It was his first PGA TOUR win in his 67th start as a pro and at the age of 23 years, 4 months and 23 days, became the third player to make the Wells Fargo Championship his first PGA TOUR win (Anthony Kim/2008, Rory McIlroy/2010).\n\nHe is also the third-youngest winner of the event, behind McIlroy (20 years, 11 months, 28 days) and Kim (22/10/15).\n\n“I didn’t want to play it safe,” Fowler said. “I had a good number (133 yards), and I was aiming right of the hole with the wind coming out of the right, and if I hit a perfect shot, it comes down right on the stick. … I hit a perfect shot at the right time, and I was going for it.”\n\nMcIlroy, who returned to No. 1 in the world thanks to his runner up finish Sunday, also used Quail Hollow as a launching pad toward stardom when he won here two years ago.\n\n“I’m looking forward to playing with Rory for a long time,” said Fowler, who closed with a 3-under 69. “It’s awesome. It’s a long wait, but well worth it.”\n\nFinal StandingsPosPlayerParR1R2R3R4Total1Rickie Fowler-1466726769274T2D.A.

This time it came down to two former Clemson teammates and friends Jonathan Byrd and Lucas Glover. Glover would be the winner in a one-hole duel, capping off a brilliant week of putting and a comeback on Sunday that was peppered with drama after a wild day of leaderboard movement.\n\nGlover’s victory meant many things. He became the first player in tournament history to record all four rounds in the 60s (67-68-69-69). His opening-round 67 is the lowest start by a champion. Glover led the field in a new TOUR statisticâ€”strokes gained puttingâ€”by gaining 10.506 strokes on the field. He also became the fifth champion of the Wells Fargo Championship, who also has a major championship victory on his resume.\n\nThe 31-year-old Glover, who was born in Greenville, SC, had not won on TOUR since the 2009 U.S. Open, when he came from three strokes back early in the final round. Glover did the same at the Wells Fargo Championship as he entered the final round three behind Byrd, the 54-hole leader.\n\nGetting the title was an adventure for Glover. He and Byrd finished 15-under-par, one stroke shy of the tournament record.\n\nBut ahead of them several players were creating a buzz throughout the grounds of Quail Hollow Club. Phil Mickelson and Padraig Harrington made early moves and Pat Perez, who trailed by one heading into the final round, hung around until a double-bogey at No.7 sent him in another direction.\n\nAlso, first round leader and Charlotte native Bill Haas resurfaced. He nearly made a hole-in-one at the par-three 17th and after making his short birdie putt there pulled within striking distance before a bogey at 18 left him two strokes out of the playoff.\n\nRory Sabbatini also provided fireworks ahead of the final groups. He posted a final round 65 and finished 14-under-par to give the others a number to chase if they were going to win on this Mother’s Day Sunday.\n\nByrd and Glover would get the job done. But both came home in different fashion.\n\nWhen Glover birdied the par-5, 15th hole he took a one-stroke lead with his 15-under total. Meanwhile, Byrd bounced back from a bogey on 14 with a birdie on 15 to get within one. Ahead of him, Glover was making impressive par putts and getting out of trouble to do so.\n\nOn the 18th, hole Glover hooked his tee shot left of the creek with his ball landing near a spectator’s back. From a tough sidehill lie, Glover took his position to hit the ball but it rolled down the slope. He had not grounded his club and hit his second shot from the better position. His approach did go over the green. However, a chip shot from the fringe and a 6-foot par putt saved the par and made him the new leader in the clubhouse.\n\nByrd made par from the trees at 16, then a par at 17. On the 18th, he made a dramatic birdie for the tie and the Clemson faithful were alive. Byrd’s birdie on the 18th was one of only three recorded by the field on Sunday. And, for the ninth straight year, the par-four was the toughest hole on the course all week.\n\nIn the playoff, the two once again visited the 18th hole. Byrd’s tee shot found a left-side bunker and his 5-iron approach went left over the creek causing a bogey. Glover, on the other hand, was able to find the middle of the fairway this time and a two-putt par was good enough.\n\nFinal StandingsPosPlayerParR1R2R3R4Total1Lucas Glover-15676869692732Jonathan Byrd-15666867722733Rory Sabbatini-14727166652744Bill Haas-13647071702755Kevin Na-1269696771276T6Bobby Gates-1169706969277T6Pat Perez-1167657075277T6Zach Johnson-1173696768277T9Carl Pettersson-1068687270278T9Stewart Cink-1071656874278T9Robert Garrigus-1072677069278T9Padraig Harrington-1069726968278T9Vijay Singhn-1068687369278T9J.B.

His final-round 62 included six consecutive threes on his scorecard over the final six holes as he shattered the course record by two strokes and won by four shots over Masters Champion Phil Mickelson.\n\nThe 20-year-old, two days before his birthday, became the youngest winner on Tour since Tiger Woods in 1996 to capture a championship. He also became the third straight player in his 20s to win the Wells Fargo Championship and the youngest winner in tournament history.\n\n“To win this tournament as my first is something quite special,” said McIlroy. “I received so much support all day and this crowd is quite special. It feels quite Augusta-like here. It’s such a great tournament.”\n\nMcIlroy made the weekend special at Quail Hollow Club. He needed an eagle on the par-five 7th (his 16th hole of the day) to make the 36-hole cut on the number with a one-over-par total. His six-foot eagle putt gave him a chance on the weekend. He was nine strokes behind the leader.\n\nThe first two rounds created several storylines.\n\nTiger Woods was making his second start of the season and after opening with a 74, he struggled Friday to a 79 for his worst-ever 36-hole score and only the sixth missed cut as a pro.\n\nOn the flip-side, there was Billy Mayfair – a past multiple champion on the TOUR who had to qualify Monday afternoon to get into the field because he is not exempt this year for the first time since 1988. He earned a spot in the field with birdies on the final three holes and did not stop there.\n\nBy the weekend, Mayfair was the 36-hole leader at 8-under-par and heading into Sunday he had a two-stroke lead. Lurking behind him, however, were three major championship winners – Davis Love, III, Angel Cabrera and Phil Mickelson.\n\nMcIlroy, meanwhile, made a decent Saturday move himself. A six-under 66 moved him into a tie for seventh and only four strokes behind Mayfair.\n\nThen the fireworks began.\n\nOn Sunday, McIlroy birdied the final three holes on the front-nine to post a 32 and followed with birdie at No.11 to tie Cabrera for the lead at 10-under-par. He sank an 8-foot birdie putt at 14 after nearly driving the hole. At 15, he hit a 5-iron from 207 yards to four feet for an eagle on the 566-yard, par-5 and the roars were just beginning. From a fairway bunker on the 16th, his 7-iron shot from 170 yards rolled to within five feet and he made the putt to move to 14-under-par.\n\nOn the par-three 17th, McIlroy, after nearly holing out a long putt from the other side of the green, tapped in for his fifth consecutive three and headed to the 18th hole with tremendous fan support and the look of a champion. But he was not finished. After hitting his second shot safely on the final green, McIlroy made an improbable 43-foot birdie putt that sent the Quail Hollow faithful into a frenzy.\n\nMeanwhile, Mayfair and Love were struggling and would eventually each shoot 76 and Cabrera struggled to make putts. Mickelson could not mount a strong enough charge, though he did finish second.\n\n“He was in a total zone,” said 2008 champion Anthony Kim, who was McIlroy’s playing partner on Sunday.\n\nFinal StandingsPosPlayerParR1R2R3R4Total1Rory McIlroy-15727366622732Phil Mickelson-11706871682773Angel Cabrera-10706773682784Brendon de Jonge-9707370662795Bo Van Pelt-8657671682806Rickie Fowler-773707168281T7Scott McCarron-670756770282T7Mark Wilson-673727067282T7Anthony Kim-672697071282T7Padraig Harrington-672727068282T7Jim Furyk-675657171282T7Matt jones-671716968282T7J.J. Henry-668717172282\n\nAnthony Kim\n\nAt the age of 22, Anthony Kim became not only the youngest champion of the Wells Fargo Championship, he became the youngest first-time champion on TOUR since 2001.\n\nOn Saturday, the Los Angeles native broke from the pack with a flawless six-under-par 66, giving him a four-shot lead heading into the final round. The highlight of the round came on Quail Hollow’s toughest hole, the 478-yard, par-four finishing hole. Kim pounded a 324-yard drive down the fairway, then stuck a pitching wedge to six feet and made the putt for birdie. His playing partner Jason Bohn called the round, “almost Tigeresque.”\n\nWhat followed on Sunday was one of the most dominating performances in the tournament’s six-year history. Kim needed only 11 putts as he recorded four birdies on the first nine holes and pushed his lead to seven shots. On the par-4 9th hole he found a fairway bunker off the tee and had to lay up. However, his approach shot hit the flagstick and he saved par.\n\nComing home on the back-nine, he did record two bogeys on the final three holes as several champions of the Wells Fargo Championship have done so before. However, he still finished five shots ahead of former British Open champion Ben Curtis and broke Tiger Wood’s tournament record with a 16-under 272 score.\n\nFinal StandingsPosPlayerParR1R2R3R4Total1Anthony Kim-16706766692722Ben Curtis-11697172652773Jason Bohn-10686772712784Robert Allenby-970707366279T5Heath Slocum-871686873280T5Dudley Hart-8716770722807Jim Furyk-771677172281T8Fred Couples-672696972282T8Rod Pampling-673706574282T8Stewart Cink-673706574282T8Adam Scott-672736671282\n\nJoey Sindelar\n\nJoey Sindelar, one of the most popular players on the PGA TOUR, enjoyed a rebirth of his career at the 2004 Wells Fargo Championship.\n\nHe arrived at Quail Hollow Club with 370 starts since his last victory at the 1990 Hardee’s Golf Classic. Moreover, the 22-year veteran was ranked 222nd at the start of the tournament and jumped to 74th by week’s end. Add a winner’s check of $1,008,000 and the week made Sindelar’s victory one of the most well received among TOUR players during the 2004 season.\n\nWhen Sindelar, at the age of 45, beat the likes of hard-charging Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson and then defeated 29-year-New Arron Oberholser in a playoff, he became the Newest winner on the PGA TOUR in 2004. Earlier that season, he tied an all-time record when he recorded four eagles in one round at the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic to prove he remains a fierce competitor.\n\n“I never did give up hope. I’ve understood my swing for 12 or 14 years now, so when the lug nuts get loose, I am able to tighten them up pretty quickly,” said Sindelar. “The problem is the competition out here has gotten so good. It’s different than when I was in my hey-day. They come out here so good, so well rehearsed. So, the competition thing gets scary, and that’s why I badly wanted to win. I don’t have any other skills. I have to keep plugging.”\n\nSindelar won 10 collegiate titles at Ohio State University, including a win at the 1981 Big Ten Championship by 12 strokes. He is a member of the Ohio State University Athletic Hall of Fame.\n\nFinal StandingsPosPlayerParR1R2R3R4Total1Joey Sindelar-11696970692772Arron Oberholser-1169686872277T3Carlos Franco-1068716970278T3Tiger Woods-1069667568278T5Notah Begay III-967706973279T5Steve Flesch-972726669279T5Phil Mickelson-970707267279T5Jeff Maggert-9716967722799Mathias Gronberg-869717169280T10Geoff Ogilvy-769716675281T10Lucas Glover-774706869281T10Kevin Sutherland-771687171281T10Heath Slocum-767756772281T10Vijay Singh-768707172281"
