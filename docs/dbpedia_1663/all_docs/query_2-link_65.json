        "text": "Good you are being cautious about betting on Coco especially with the servicing demons inside her head.. She does have a favorable draw. I see Miss Baby Face is in the middle of her half and probably will get thru a few rounds to face Keys again. Keys has to say this is her best chance to get to the final. Only Coco and Saba are all around BETTER tennis players than her.\n\nI think you forgot Rybakina? she is great on the grass and has to be up there as one of the strong contenders to win Wimbledon again, she is also the WTA top server., Rybakina also has a favorable draw at Wimbledon this year?\n\nBTW Gauff is yet to advance past the round of 16 at Wimbledon\n\nI think you forgot Rybakina? she is great on the grass and has to be up there as one of the strong contenders to win Wimbledon again, she is also the WTA top server., Rybakina also has a favorable draw at Wimbledon this year?\n\nBTW Gauff is yet to advance past the round of 16 at Wimbledon\n\nNo No I was just looking at CoCo half of the draw. Everyone knows Rybakina is one of my favorites but she needs to start winning again consistently before Keli dubs her as another one of AP's scrubs.. Be quiet this post might get pass her. jajaja\n\nJust looking at this list of players with the most winners at women's singles Grand Slams during 2024 ( so far)\n\nSabalenka 309\n\nZheng 276\n\nKostyuk 268\n\nSwiatek 263\n\nPaolini 239\n\nI'm not surprised by those numbers, Sabalenka is by far must see tv..I have to give her credit, she has great problem solving skills. It very rarely that she looses in straight sets. I would think that most payers do not sleep well the night before an encounter vs her. However, I am surprised by Paulini numbers being so high be such a shorter player. I guess with her , SIZE DOESNT MATTER. jajaja\n\nFrom Wim Fissette ( Osaaka's coach)\n\n\" For me Naomi was competing to win 1 of the 2 hard court slams in her 1st career. I believe in the future, in the next 5 years, she will compete to win 1 of the 4 Grand Slams.We will go to all the slams now where we believe we have a chance\"\n\nIf you are going to slams right now where you both believe you have a chance, that would be AO and USO no?\n\nOsaka did play RG and has played lead up grass tournaments prior to Wimbledon, still she is a long way off to be competitive, her transition and volley game on the grass is missing for starters, she has the serve no doubt, she hasnt really tried to improve those areas at all., playing doubles will enhance her singles game another area she choose not to participate in.\n\nI'm not surprised by those numbers, Sabalenka is by far must see tv..I have to give her credit, she has great problem solving skills.

I guess with her , SIZE DOESNT MATTER. jajaja\n\nI am not surprised Saba is leading the list, Jazz especially on a HC regardless of her size can punch out those winners\n\nIf I was coaching any player or was trying to find a new coach. I would suggest foot work drills that Iga is probably able to complete. Yes, everyone can't move like IGA but you can work on taking the quick little steps to put foot to ball to always be able to give yourself ample to time to prepare for your stroke shot. Keys and Naomi need to improve on theirs. Coco footwork is fantastic but not as strategic as Iga.. @don_fabio Don_fabio Does this make sense to you?\n\nI think you forgot Rybakina? she is great on the grass and has to be up there as one of the strong contenders to win Wimbledon again, she is also the WTA top server., Rybakina also has a favorable draw at Wimbledon this year?\n\nBTW Gauff is yet to advance past the round of 16 at Wimbledon\n\nRybakina can be vulnerable to unknown players.This year she lost to Blinkova and Paolini,she can wake up with an ailment or just have a bad day at the office.This year she has been very vulnerable .\n\nThis year it's still wide open,and if Kerber was still very active I would put her name down as a contender because she is a true grasscourter. I think a lot has to work out to win Wimbledon. housing,practice time,court assignments and weather.\n\nCzech players are good on grass too.\n\nRybakina can be vulnerable to unknown players.This year she lost to Blinkova and Paolini,she can wake up with an ailment or just have a bad day at the office.This year she has been very vulnerable .\n\nThis year it's still wide open,and if Kerber was still very active I would put her name down as a contender because she is a true grasscourter.

Then she's in real trouble. You don't want to have to rally on grass every point for 2-3 sets."
