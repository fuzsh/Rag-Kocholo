USA’s Chris Evert holds the record with seven title followed by Germany’s Steffi Graf (6).\n\nThe clay Major was the first one to join the Open Era in 1968, allowing both amateurs and professionals to participate at the event. Since then, 31 different women have lifted the coveted Suzanne-Lenglen Cup."
