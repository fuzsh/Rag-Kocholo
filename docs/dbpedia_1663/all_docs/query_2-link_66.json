The Swedes have been having an incredible run here in Paris but the second seed Japanese will be a huge hurdle. Will Japan prevail, or will Sweden continue their dream run?\n\nFrance Advances to Men’s Team Semifinals with Victory Over Brazil\n\nThe French men’s team has secured their place in the semifinals with a convincing 3-0 victory over Brazil. Simon Gauzy and Alexis Lebrun delivered a strong performance, defeating Guilherme Teodoro and Vitor Ishiy 3-0 in the doubles match. Felix Lebrun, fresh from his singles bronze medal win over Hugo Calderano, continued the momentum with a 3-1 victory over the Brazilian again. Alexis Lebrun then sealed the deal with a 3-1 win over Vitor Ishiy. The French team, buoyed by the home crowd, will now face a tough test against China in the semifinals."
