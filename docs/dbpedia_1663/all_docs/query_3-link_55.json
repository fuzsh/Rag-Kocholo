        "text": "Tyler Mawhinney takes solo lead by two following second round\n\nin Saskatoon\n\nSaskatoon, Sask. – The battle for the Willingdon Cup came down to the wire as Team British Columbia pulled away from Team Ontario to claim the Inter-Provincial team title at the 119th Canadian Men’s Amateur Championship, presented by BDO in Saskatoon, Sask.\n\nTeam British Columbia was led by Wyatt Brook of Heffley Creek, B.C. who shot a 4-under 68 on Tuesday to help push his team to a collective 9-under, four shots clear of Team Ontario.\n\n“The putter made everything, I couldn’t miss it felt like, it was just one of those days and you just ride it out until the end and finished four under, so it was good,” said Wyatt.\n\nJames Fahy of Vancouver, B.C. enjoyed the team experience and competing for his home province while developing new friendships that can be made while playing at the national championships.\n\n“I think it’s important for a team situation even though golf is very individual, but we’ve seen each other in the clubhouse and our tee times were close together and seeing each other on the range and wishing each other luck, I think that makes a difference,” said Fahy.\n\nTeam Canada NextGen member Cooper Humphreys of Vernon, B.C. shot rounds of 66-73 to have also have his scores count both days for Team British Columbia fittingly added on to Fahy’s comments.\n\n“Good vibes on and off the course,” he said as he held the Willingdon Cup with his teammates right beside him.\n\nTeam Ontario finished second with a collective 5-under, with Team Manitoba rounding out the top three at even par. The teams battling for the inter-provincial title played their rounds at Riverside Country Club (Riverside) on Tuesday after opening at Saskatoon Golf and Country Club (Saskatoon). The two lowest scores from the teams of three counted towards the team total each day.\n\nIn the battle for the Earl Grey Cup, first round co-leader, Tyler Mawhinney of Fleming Island, Fla. has taken the solo lead following a 3-under 69 on Tuesday to move to 10-under. The 16-year-old birdied three of his final four holes to take a two-shot lead into Wednesday’s third round.\n\nRight behind Mawhinney are four golfers at 8-under, including Nathaniel Gray-Lamont of Guelph, Ont. who was co-leader with Mawhinney after round one. Also tied for second are Mackenzie Bickell of Richmond, B.C., Braxton Kuntz of Winnipeg, Man. and defending champion, Ashton McCulloch of Kingston, Ont. who posted a second consecutive round of 4-under 68.\n\nFour others are tied for sixth at 7-under including Owen Kim of Oakville, Ont. who fired a 6-under 66 at Saskatoon on Tuesday. Along with Daniel Choi of Westlake, Texas, Sam Easterbrook of Tomworth, England and Baron Szeto of Moraga, Calif.\n\nRylan Shim is among five golfers tied for ninth at 6-under, after tying for the low round of the day with a 7-under 65 at Saskatoon. Harrison Davis of Fort Payne, Ala. also posted a 65 at Saskatoon on Tuesday and is tied for 14th at 5-under with four others.\n\nPlay was delayed 45 minutes on Tuesday due to early morning lightning in the area. The first two rounds of this year’s tournament were contested on both courses with the 264-player field playing each course once. The field has now been reduced to the top 90 players following a cut line of 1-over, a total of 55 players are currently at 1-under or better. Wednesday and Thursday’s rounds will both played at Riverside Country Club.\n\nThe 2024 Canadian Men’s Amateur champion receives an exemption into the 2025 RBC Canadian Open at TPC Toronto at Osprey Valley (North Course) in Caledon, Ont. and the 2024 U.S. Amateur Championship taking place at Hazeltine National Golf Club in Chaska, Minn. from August 12-18. The winner will also receive an exemption from local qualifying for the 2025 U.S. Open and U.S. Amateur Championship. In addition, the winner will receive $1,200 CAD."
