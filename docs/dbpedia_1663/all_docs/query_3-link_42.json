        "text": "A second-round exit has added motivation for a veteran-laden 49ers team\n\nA taste of success in November has only made the 49ers want action in December.\n\nCharlotte's hunger comes from how last season ended in the NCAA tournament's second round against eventual College Cup-winning Clemson. The 49ers experienced unique success with their first tournament title in the American Athletic Conference, and it took a road win over No. 2 SMU to do so.\n\nThe sweetness of success and the bitter taste of a loss to the Tigers have fueled them. It's a group with a few new faces surrounding a trove of returners.\n\nLessons in the program's soccer schemes have been hand-in-hand with teachings about motivation.\n\n\"You're going to feel pain as a soccer player,\" Head Coach Kevin Langan said. \"But can you use that pain to fuel you through your summer workouts? Can you use it to help the newcomers get on board faster and ensure the approach and training intensity are spot-on?\n\n\"It's about preparing so you don't have to feel that pain; if you do, you feel it on the front end and not the back end.\"\n\nTime away from the practice pitch felt longer than normal this year.\n\nThe team's bonding in a hotel for fall training was long awaited as the sting of last year waited to be washed away. Langan didn't waste time, he used it to ensure the latest graduating class would have its best chance yet to break through.\n\nHe's no stranger to the highest levels of Charlotte's success.\n\nLangan was associate head coach in 2011 when the 49ers reached the College Cup — the first time in school history that a program reached the national championship stage in a sport. He took over the following year and has reached the tournament's second round in nine of his 12 seasons en route to becoming the winningest in program history.\n\nClemson, the No. 1-ranked squad in the pre-season polls, is first on Charlotte's exhibition slate. It's a rare opportunity for the university to host a reigning champ, but it's commonplace for the men's program under Langan.\n\nVirginia, the No. 11 ranked program in 2023, No. 13 in pre-season polls, and a fellow entrant in last year's tournament's second round, awaits the 49ers a week later.\n\nThe opportunity to bond extends outside the team's hotel and onto the pre-season pitch.\n\n\"It's perfect, we get to play against the best teams right away,\" said senior Filip Jauk, who scored the clinching goal of Charlotte's AAC tournament win over SMU. \"That will give us a good idea of what we need this season.\n\n\"Last year was the first time a lot of us have played in the national tournament. It was great to experience that atmosphere, (Clemson) was one of the four best teams in the nation and we saw that we could compete with them.\"\n\nPlayers have been grouped in training to build chemistry.\n\nThe domestic and international newcomers have their respective groups. The senior returners have another, and the non-seniors have one too.\n\nCoaching each group has allowed a personalized touch for players with different career trajectories. It helps with their development and creates a shared message through different wording.\n\nThe returning seniors have the taste of last year's loss and pending graduation to fuel them. New additions have their pasts too — look no further than Division III transfer and national championship leader Casey McCloskey. He was named the tournament's top player after leading St. Olaf to a double-overtime win over Amherst College for the title in 2023.\n\nHis wisdom, matched with the drive passed down from Charlotte's returners is the mix Langan is looking for.\n\n\"We have some guys who are onto their new adventure, and others who have built and learned from their experiences here,\" Langan said. \"There are always going to be different messages for different journeys.\"\n\nJauk's journey hit a high note with a header to win the 49ers' first-round tournament game as part of four game-winning goals as a junior. Fellow now-senior Brigham Larsen's second season with Charlotte featured a career-high 15 points.\n\nThe highs were noteworthy and will be admirable to look back on when soccer ends one day. But the latest goals are loftier and require plenty from both, and the teammates surrounding them.\n\nOne year didn't satisfy their hunger.\n\n\"We won a championship, which is great, but we want to go further,\" Larsen said. \"Having 10 seniors for this year is huge, not only for the experience but to teach the other guys who we are.\n\n\"We talk about last year a lot, we talked about it every day during the preseason. We believe we have the opportunity to do something great this year.\"\n\nPlayers Mentioned"
