The world number one from Poland brushed aside Italian underdog Jasmine Paolini 6-2 6-1 in and hour and eight minutes.\n\nKing of Clay Rafael Nadal may have played his last French Open this year but Swiatek comprehensively proved once again she is also Roland Garros royalty. She is the first woman to win three consecutive Roland Garros titles since Justine Henin in 2007 and only the third to achieve the feat in Open history, along with Monica Seles.\n\nSwiatek is undefeated in Paris since 2021, 21 matches ago, and has won 34 of her 36 matches here, a record matched only by Seles and Chris Evert. Follow all the latest reaction from Roland Garros below:\n\nFrench Open 2024: Swiatek v Paolini\n\nPaolini also in the women’s doubles final alongside Italian partner Sara Errani\n\nPaolini breaks Swiatek’s serve in just the third game - but the Pole immediately breaks back\n\nSwiatek wins five straight games to claim first set 6-2\n\nWorld No1 fires through second round to win fourth Roland Garros title\n\nSwiatek wins French Open final 6-2 6-1 vs Paolini\n\nSaturday 8 June 2024 15:40 , Karl Matchett\n\nIga Swiatek swept to a fourth French Open crown to keep her Queen of Clay title at Roland Garros.\n\nThe world number one from Poland brushed aside Italian underdog Jasmine Paolini 6-2 6-1 in and hour and eight minutes.\n\nKing of Clay Rafael Nadal may have played his last French Open this year but Swiatek comprehensively proved once again she is also Roland Garros royalty.\n\nReport from the final:\n\nSwiatek races to third straight French Open title with victory over Paolini\n\nSwiatek wins French Open final 6-2 6-1 vs Paolini\n\nSaturday 8 June 2024 15:29 , Karl Matchett\n\n18 winners to 7... and 13 unforced errors to 18. That’s really the story of this final, with Swiatek just maintaining her consistency and keeping the points rolling over all game long.\n\nShe managed a streak of ten straight games during this final.\n\nFor Paolini it’s a great improvement in Grand Slam terms - but the distance to the top is clearly still large.\n\nShe does, however, have another final tomorrow for the doubles!\n\nSwiatek wins French Open final 6-2 6-1 vs Paolini\n\nSaturday 8 June 2024 15:26 , Karl Matchett\n\nA brave performance from Paolini who did start this match well, but she just didn’t have the endurance or class in her game to match Swiatek - few do, in truth.\n\nAnd especially not on clay.\n\nThat’s three straight wins and four overall at Roland Garros from Swiatek, the world No1 who is untouchable on this surface.\n\nSwiatek wins French Open final 6-2 6-1 vs Paolini\n\nSaturday 8 June 2024 15:22 , Karl Matchett\n\nPaolini this time gets a fortunate bounce off the net but can never really position herself on the court in the point and Swiatek is ruthless, volleying then smashing to go 30-15 up.\n\nAnother fine rally tests both players to their limit and Paolini forces Swiatek backwards and to each corner - a long lob goes long and it’s 30-30.\n\nSwiatek is always the slow and steady one though, biding her time and playing through points - and she wins the next to go to Championship point.\n\nHer serve is powerful, the return is long...Iga Swiatek is French Open champion yet again!\n\n*Swiatek 5-1 Paolini - French Open women’s final second set (6-2)\n\nSaturday 8 June 2024 15:17 , Karl Matchett\n\nLast chance saloon then for Paolini to stop this procession of Swiatek’s and to prolong this final.\n\nShe shows the required fight alright, taking a point with a well-placed shot down the line and another to the baseline - then Swiatek shows that weakness of hers at the net to send a volley wide. 40-30 to Paolini. Can she pick up one more?\n\nYes she can! Tremendous fired forehand down the line, massive power and this time perfect precision.\n\nSwiatek to serve for the game, set, match, title and trophy.\n\nSwiatek 5-0 Paolini* - French Open women’s final second set (6-2)\n\nSaturday 8 June 2024 15:11 , Karl Matchett\n\nSwiatek serving to go within a game of the title.\n\nPaolini produces one big winner into the corner and another to win a brilliant rally, both players initially from the baseline but the Italian eventually moving in and volleying from the net. Fine play for 30-30.\n\nBut Swiatek will not be denied, and she duly wins the next two points to go within a game of a fourth Roland Garros success.\n\n*Swiatek 4-0 Paolini - French Open women’s final second set (6-2)\n\nSaturday 8 June 2024 15:07 , Karl Matchett\n\nHuge, deep breath time for Paolini. If she’s to make another fight of this final, she needs to find a way to hold her serve this time. Easier said than done, of course.\n\nThe Italian wins the first point and gives a wry smile, but the grimace is back when Swiatek barrels through everything she’s got in the next two points, wins them both - then even a shot which clips the top of the net falls Swiatek’s way. 15-40 now and another couple of break points.\n\nShe needs them both, but it’s 4-0.\n\nSwiatek 3-0 Paolini* - French Open women’s final second set (6-2)\n\nSaturday 8 June 2024 15:02 , Karl Matchett\n\nThe Pole is just in scintillating form now and blazes through an eighth straight game. We’ve had 11 minutes of this second set and it’s 3-0.\n\nSwiatek absolutely rolling towards another Grand Slam title.\n\n*Swiatek 2-0 Paolini - French Open women’s final second set (6-2)\n\nSaturday 8 June 2024 14:59 , Karl Matchett\n\nAnother double fault from Paolini who looks disheartened. The crowd respond to try and lift her, but Swiatek is just rattling through the points and games now.\n\nPower, poise and precision all in her game to fire point after point into the corner or to unreachable parts of the court.\n\nTwo more from the Italian go into the net on the stretch and it’s two break points - the first goes with a brilliant ace. First of the game for Paolini, then Swiatek’s return goes long and it’s back to deuce!\n\nIt doesn’t last though and Swiatek comes through for another break and seven straight games won now.\n\nSwiatek 1-0 Paolini* - French Open women’s final second set (6-2)\n\nSaturday 8 June 2024 14:54 , Karl Matchett\n\nSecond set underway, Swiatek serving first. On course for a third straight title at Roland Garros and her fourth overall.\n\nPaolini isn’t finished yet though and her fighting spirit has been on show today - and it’s here again for the first point, forcing Swiatek short and then into the net.\n\nA mis-hit apiece gets the second set off to a slightly strange start, but Swiatek simply keeps moving Paolini side to side, forcing it into a match from the baselines and that’s one she’s always going to win.\n\nSwiatek *6-2 Paolini - French Open women’s final first set\n\nSaturday 8 June 2024 14:47 , Karl Matchett\n\nServing to stay in the set, then.\n\nPaolini has a somewhat pained look now on every point, no doubt the reality of facing the super consistent Swiatek simply grinding down that optimism and confidence that reaching the final itself has produced.\n\nThe unforced errors are coming much quicker now and Swiatek goes 40-0 up, three break points to win the set.\n\nShe needs only one, with Paolini’s awkward shot after the service is returned going into the net - that’s 6-2 and first set to the reigning champion!\n\nSwiatek 5-2 Paolini* - French Open women’s final first set\n\nSaturday 8 June 2024 14:44 , Karl Matchett\n\nComprehensive. Crosscourt winner, unforced error hit long, same again long on backhand. Swiatek quickly into control.\n\nPaolini hits back though, a really good volley and passing shot on the forehand when Swiatek comes to the net, for 40-15. But it’s not enough to really get back into the game, with Swiatek coming short again next point to pat one into the opposite corner and go three clear. The first set well within her grasp now.\n\n*Swiatek 4-2 Paolini - French Open women’s final first set\n\nSaturday 8 June 2024 14:40 , Karl Matchett\n\nAn attempted lob goes slightly long from Paolini, but then a neat pair of forehand shots gets her back level. That’s her first forehand winner of the match so far.\n\nThis is a vital game for the Italian you feel, mentally as well as in the contect of the first set - needs to stay in it while Swiatek is raising her level.\n\nAnother long rally follows - already the third or fourth really high-quality one involving both of them - and this time Paolini triumphs, but that’s as good as it gets. Swiatek earns a break point and a double service foul finishes matters, with the Pole a break up.\n\nSwiatek 3-2 Paolini* - French Open women’s final first set\n\nSaturday 8 June 2024 14:35 , Karl Matchett\n\nBrilliant tennis from both, Swiatek forcing Paolini from side to side but the Italian responding fantastically each time. It’s a 25-shot rally, the longest of the game so far, but it ends in Swiatek absolutely hammering one into the far corner, no chance for her opponent.\n\nThe Pole looks in the groove suddenly and she hits another winner - her eighth to Paolini’s one - to go clear in this fifth game.\n\nBoth players firing back with a lot of power now but Swiatek closes matters out and she has won back-to-back games since losing her serve last time out.\n\n*Swiatek 2-2 Paolini - French Open women’s final first set\n\nSaturday 8 June 2024 14:30 , Karl Matchett\n\nImportant game for Paolini then - can she hold her service and make the most of her good start?\n\nSwiatek shows her focus by winning the first two points, one after a long strike beyond the base line. Then it’s an erratic strike wide by Paolini, who grimaces - now perhaps she’s facing the real Swiatek, one with a challenge in front of her.\n\nIt’s a formidable response and the Pole lashes a backhand down the line to break back immediately, game to love.\n\nSwiatek 1-2 Paolini* - French Open women’s final first set\n\nSaturday 8 June 2024 14:27 , Karl Matchett\n\nPaolini’s aggressive early stance is seeing Swiatek produce a few unforced errors here - two send the third game to 0-30 and the crowd sound their appreciation for the Italian.\n\nSwiatek gets one back but a brilliant strike to the back of the court and a cheeky, well-timed drop-shot from Paolini see her take the next to earn two break points.\n\nShe only needs one - Swiatek wallops one super long and that’s a break of service for the underdog!\n\n*Swiatek 1-1 Paolini - French Open women’s final first set\n\nSaturday 8 June 2024 14:23 , Karl Matchett\n\nPaolini looking strong and hitting hard. She sends Swiatek both sides with her service and keeps her moving cross-court after those first returns, some really good range into the corners on both forehand and backhand to storm into a 40-0 lead. Swiatek takes a point after a lengthy rally, before another looks like Paolini hits a brilliant backhand winner.\n\nIt’s called out though and a check confirms it - back to deuce.\n\nNo fear and no problem for Paolini though who comes through it and holds her service game - now she’ll feel she belongs in the final! Big fistpump to accompany the winning point.\n\nSwiatek 1-0 Paolini* - French Open women’s final first set\n\nSaturday 8 June 2024 14:16 , Karl Matchett\n\nPaolini guesses where a Swiatek volley at the net is going and gets it right to power her first point of the final into the corner. Some big serves from the No1 are impossible to return, however, and the Italian has started on the back foot, but hitting powerfully.\n\nOne unforced error from Swiatek takes it to 40-30, but an ace gives the response required. First game to Swiatek.\n\n*Swiatek 0-0 Paolini - French Open women’s final\n\nSaturday 8 June 2024 14:13 , Karl Matchett\n\nIga Swiatek serves to start. A few last cheers and then we’re underway in the 2024 Roland Garros final!\n\nA good return initially but then a strong backhand sends Paolini wide and she sends one long. First point to the Pole.\n\nSwiatek v Paolini: French Open women’s singles final LIVE\n\nSaturday 8 June 2024 14:11 , Karl Matchett\n\nA few serves and returns for both players, a few final words from the umpire. We’re very close to go-time.\n\nSwiatek is ranked world No1, Paolini is seeded 12th for this tournament.\n\nIs a fourth French Open title in the offing for Swiatek?\n\nSwiatek v Paolini: French Open women’s singles final LIVE\n\nSaturday 8 June 2024 14:06 , Karl Matchett\n\nHuge applause as the players come out onto the court.\n\nA wave and a smile from Paolini ahead of her first Grand Slam final - her start today is going to be so important.\n\nPre-final photos at the net and then we’re about ready for the final warmup.\n\nSwiatek v Paolini: French Open women’s singles final LIVE\n\nSaturday 8 June 2024 14:03 , Karl Matchett\n\nPlenty of pre-match appreciation for the strong forehand and good footwork from Paolini. That’s where the improvement has come, while Tim Henman says the return of serve is another area which is key today.\n\nThe players are warming up in the tunnel while the pre-match entertainment wraps up.\n\nSwiatek v Paolini: French Open women’s singles final LIVE\n\nSaturday 8 June 2024 13:50 , Karl Matchett\n\nWe are closing in on start time for the women’s singles final. Swiatek vs Paolini, Poland vs Italy, multiple Grand Slam winner against first-time finalist.\n\nIt could be a fantastic match but the Italian will really have to bring her A-game.\n\nSwiatek v Paolini: French Open women’s singles final LIVE\n\nSaturday 8 June 2024 13:46 , Karl Matchett\n\nBig chance today for Swiatek too, though. She can move level with Justine Henin with four triumphs at the French Open and she has claimed 20 straight wins after becoming champion the last two years and reaching today’s final.\n\nShe could also become just the third player, male or female, to win the first five Grand Slam finals she has contested, following Roger Federer and Monica Seles.\n\nWomen’s singles titles at Roland-Garros, Open era:\n\nChris Evert, 7\n\nSteffi Graf, 6\n\nJustine Henin, 4\n\nIga Swiatek, 3\n\nMonica Seles, 3\n\nSerena Williams, 3\n\nMargaret Court, 3\n\nArantxa Sanchez Vicario, 3\n\nSwiatek v Paolini: French Open women’s singles final LIVE\n\nSaturday 8 June 2024 13:40 , Karl Matchett\n\nMuch has been made of Jasmin Paolini’s run to this final compared to previous Grand Slam events - she had never been past a second round at any of the four until earlier this year, when she reached the fourth round at the Australian Open.\n\nBut she’s not without success: Paolini won the 2024 Dubai Championships to claim her first-ever WTA1000 singles title, while also appearing in the final of the Billie Jean King Cup in 2023, losing her match there to Leylah Fernandez as Canada beat Italy.\n\nPaolini is also an Italian Open champion in doubles and, of course, has her final here in Paris tomorrow in the same event.\n\nSwiatek v Paolini: French Open women’s singles final LIVE\n\nSaturday 8 June 2024 13:30 , Karl Matchett\n\nIn terms of their French Open histories, one is obviously considerably better than the other - indeed the scope of Paolini’s improvement this year shows how far she’s come, but still the scale of her task today.\n\nSwiatek at Roland Garros (singles):\n\n2019 4th round\n\n2020 Winner\n\n2021 QF\n\n2022 Winner\n\n2023 Winner\n\n2024 finalist so far...\n\nPaolini at Roland Garros (singles):\n\n2019 1st round\n\n2020 2nd round\n\n2021 2nd round\n\n2022 first round\n\n2023 second round\n\n2024 finalist so far...\n\nSwiatek v Paolini: French Open women’s singles final LIVE\n\nSaturday 8 June 2024 13:20 , Karl Matchett\n\nRoute to the final:\n\nAs for Paolini, she has dropped more sets along the way and of course has had that doubles run too, but there have been some excellent wins for the No12 seed...\n\n1st round bt D.Saville 6-3 6-4\n\n2nd round bt H.Baptiste 6-4 7-6\n\n3rd round bt.

It would also be her fourth championship in five years at the clay court major and fifth Grand Slam trophy overall.\n\nShe is 4-0 in Grand Slam finals so far. She won the U.S. Open in 2022.\n\nItaly's Paolini will be participating in a major final for the first time at age 28.

Start time, channel and how to watch\n\nFrench Open women’s singles final LIVE\n\nSaturday 8 June 2024 12:00 , Karl Matchett\n\nMirra Andreeva’s teenage dreams were shattered by Jasmine Paolini at the French Open.\n\nRussian 17-year-old Andreeva, the youngest grand slam semi-finalist since Martina Hingis in 1997, froze on the big stage as Paolini, 28, reached her first major final.\n\nIt was a match with the biggest age gap between two women in a Roland Garros semi-final since Chris Evert, at 30, defeated 15-year-old Gabriela Sabatini in 1985.\n\nPaolini is also inexperienced at this level, though, having until this year never progressed past the second round at a grand slam.\n\nBut she held her nerve where Andreeva’s deserted her, the youngster squandering all six of the break points she created.\n\nRead how Paolini reached the final:\n\nMirra Andreeva’s dream dashed as Jasmine Paolini reaches first grand slam final\n\nFrench Open women’s singles final LIVE\n\nSaturday 8 June 2024 11:45 , Shrivathsa Sridhar\n\nFew things have been as certain as a Rafa Nadal triumph at the French Open over the last two decades but Iga Swiatek has emerged as a sure shot among women and is eyeing a fourth title in five years when she meets Jasmine Paolini in Saturday’s final.\n\nBarring a blip in a blockbuster second-round clash against Naomi Osaka where she saved a match point to go through, Swiatek has crushed opponents with her all-court game and 12th seed Paolini will need something special to deny her.\n\nSuch has been Swiatek’s dominance on clay that the top seed from Poland has won her last 20 matches at Roland Garros, as she bids for a third successive trophy to add to her maiden Grand Slam triumph in Paris four years ago.\n\nThe Madrid and Rome champion can also extend her winning streak on the surface to 19 matches, with fans and analysts suggesting she is well on the way to becoming a claycourt great like 14-times French Open champion Nadal.\n\n“We’ll see in 14 years if the journey is similar,” four-times Grand Slam champion Swiatek told reporters after thumping third seed Coco Gauff in the semi-finals on Thursday.\n\n“That’s obviously really nice. I’d never expect anybody to compare me to Rafa because for me he’s above everybody, and he’s a total legend.\n\n“We’ll see... but I’m proud of myself that I’m playing consistently here and that I’m mentioned in the same sentence as Rafa. That’s cool.”\n\nSwiatek’s semi-final win put her in elite company as she became only the third player since 2000 to make three straight French Open finals after Justine Henin (2005-07) and Maria Sharapova (2012-14).\n\nAt 23, she is also the second-youngest player in the Open era to reach four title clashes, older only than German great Steffi Graf in 1990.\n\n“After the tournament it usually hits me what I achieved, but during it, I feel like I just need to play another match,” said Swiatek.\n\n“Sometimes, it’s hard not to see what’s at stake and what the atmosphere is around these matches. I’m not used to it. It’s not the routine. On the other hand, when I’m focused on work, I can make it a routine because that’s easier to do.”\n\nFrench Open women’s singles final LIVE\n\nSaturday 8 June 2024 11:30 , Karl Matchett\n\nSince surviving a match point in the second round against Naomi Osaka, in arguably the match of the tournament, Iga Swiatek’s route to the final has been more like a procession.\n\nShe won 20 games in a row over three matches against Marie Bouzkova (6-4 6-2), Anastasia Potapova (6-0 6-0) and Marketa Vondrousova (6-0 6-2), before rolling over Coco Gauff 6-2 6-4 in the semi-final.\n\nPaolini may just have the element of surprise in her favour, though.\n\nSwiatek said: “We played a long time ago, so I need to prepare tactically and see what her game is at now because for sure she’s playing... she has the best season, so she must have changed something.\n\n“We’ll see because, honestly, I haven’t watched her matches, so there’s not a lot for me to say. I’ll just focus on myself and prepare tactically and try to be consistent with my tactics.”\n\nFrench Open women’s singles final LIVE\n\nSaturday 8 June 2024 11:15 , Andy Sims\n\nJasmine Paolini faces mission virtually impossible when she takes on world number one and defending champion Iga Swiatek in the French Open final.\n\nWhile few would have bet against Swiatek reaching a third successive Paris final, Italian Paolini’s emergence from the other side of the draw was a huge surprise.\n\nThe 28-year-old had never even been past the second round at a grand slam until this year, and her 6-2 4-6 6-4 win over fourth seed Elena Rybakina in the quarter-final was one of the shocks of the tournament.\n\nBut the late bloomer has enjoyed a breakthrough year, beginning with a run to the fourth round in Australia and taking in a WTA 1000 title win in Dubai in February.\n\nAs an experienced Tour player, Paolini is certainly not likely to suffer a bout of the nerves which crippled 17-year-old Mirra Andreeva in their semi-final.\n\n“Iga is an unbelievable player,” said Paolini. “So young, but so many achievements and grand slams.

There were a lot of good women’s matches.\n\n“Obviously not four hours, but who said it’s healthy to play past 1 a.m. and who said the stadium was full for 1 a.m. or 2 a.m.? I don’t know who is watching the matches at that time.\n\n“I would suggest to start earlier and then put nice matches on both sides. It’s not healthy also for players to play past, I don’t know, midnight.”\n\nNot all women’s players prefer evening matches, however, with Swiatek saying she was much more comfortable playing in warm weather during the day.\n\n“I like playing during the day, so it’s comfortable for me that I can be scheduled that way,” she said.\n\n“Probably there are many factors, a lot of requests... I understand some decisions, like me and Naomi being in the day when Richard Gasquet played during the night.\n\n“It’s obvious that a French player might have priority in terms of night sessions.”\n\nThe key to Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner’s ‘weird’ French Open semi-final\n\nSaturday 8 June 2024 08:30 , Karl Matchett\n\nYesterday evening in the men’s semis, Carlos Alcaraz edged Jannik Sinner over five sets - here’s Jamie Braidwood’s rundown of how another epic unfolded...\n\nAs Carlos Alcaraz advanced into his first French Open final, the 21-year-old broke into a wide smile. He had beaten rival Jannik Sinner in five sets, overturning a rocky start to outlast the player who will be turning world No 1 on Monday. Alcaraz’s victory, 2-6 6-3 3-6 6-4 6-3 in four hours and nine minutes, was not the classic that was expected between the two finest players of their generation, but it was a victory to display the vast amount of experience the Spaniard has already accumulated on these stages, acquiring the physical and mental tools to progress.\n\n“You have to find the joy in suffering, that’s the key, even more on clay in Roland Garros,” Alcaraz grinned. “Long rallies, four-hour matches, five sets, you have to suffer. But you have to enjoy suffering.” He is now the youngest player in tennis history to reach grand slam finals on all three surfaces, after winning the US Open and Wimbledon. Unlike the 22-year-old Sinner, this was not his first time in a French Open semi-final. While Sinner struggled with cramps, stretching out his hand and arm due to “tension” in the third set, Alcaraz had been there before.\n\nThe key to Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner’s ‘weird’ French Open semi-final\n\nFrench Open women’s singles final LIVE\n\nSaturday 8 June 2024 08:20 , The Independent\n\nViewers in the United Kingdom can watch the final live on Eurosport 1, with build-up on the channel from 1.30pm BST.
