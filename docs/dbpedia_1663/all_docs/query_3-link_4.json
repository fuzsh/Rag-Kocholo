        "text": "Championship is a form of race present in Star Stable Online. A championship is a competition every player can participate in, as long as they have access to the area of the championship. All participating players are divided into groups of up to 20, sorted by progress in the game; the higher the number of the group the player is sorted in, the higher their skill. At the end of the competition the three players with the best times in each group get a ribbon, while the rest gets a participation reward of 200 Jorvik Shillings. In addition, as of 2024, players also receive Victory Points which count towards an overall score for that period. This is known as your Championship Rank, which resets every 33 days and grants rosettes based on your overall score.\n\nChampionships\n\nMoorland Championship\n\nFort Pinta Championship\n\nGoldenhills Valley Championship\n\nJorvik Stables Championship\n\nPony Championship\n\nFirgrove Championship\n\nValedale Championship\n\nSilverglade Village Championship\n\nNew Hillcrest Championship\n\nBaroness' Racetrack Championship\n\nTimes\n\n*NOTE: The times of the races are based on the time of your server.
