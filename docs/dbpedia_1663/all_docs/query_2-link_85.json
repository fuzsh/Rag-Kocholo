        "text": "Coco Gauff made history on Friday after reaching the fourth round of the French Open by beating Dayana Yastremska.\n\nGauff looked in fine fettle as she beat the hard-hitting Yastremska in straight sets to book herself into the next round of the French Open.\n\nThat has seen the American reach the round of 16 - claiming an impressive record in the process.\n\nIt saw Gauff become the second American in the Open Era to reach four consecutive Womenâ€™s Singles R16s at Roland Garros before the age of 21.\n\nThe first woman to do it was Jennifer Capriati, who managed the feat from 1990 to 1993 - an astonishing 31 years ago.\n\nIt simply shows how accustomed to success Gauff has become at the French Open, a notoriously difficult Grand Slam for competitors from across the pond due to its clay surface.\n\nBut the 20-year-old cruised into the next round against Yastremska, who was sometimes guilty of unforced errors.\n\nNevertheless, the 30-seed still pulled off some remarkable shots but it was not enough as Gauff triumphed 6-2, 6-4.\n\nGauff has been in fine form recently, having won the US Open in 2023 and the semi-final of the Australian Open earlier this year.\n\nHer last appearance in the final of the French Open came two years ago, losing to world No. 1 Iga Swiatek in emotional circumstances, who is regarded as the 'Queen of Clay', having won three times in Roland Garros (2020, 2022, 2023).\n\nGauff, who was defeated by Swiatek last year in the quarter-finals of the French Open, will now face Elisabetta Cocciaretto in the last 16.\n\nSwiatek, meanwhile, celebrated her 23rd birthday with a 6-4, 6-2 victory over Marie Bouzkova in the third round.\n\nThe Pole is aiming for three straight titles in Paris, while she was also serenaded by the crowd with a rendition of 'Happy Birthday' on Court Philippe Chatrier."
