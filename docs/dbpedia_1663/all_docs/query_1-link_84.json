        "text": "According to a New York Times article published earlier this year, only about 10 percent of the world's population is left-handed. When you think in terms of the small microcosm of tennis in that respect, one can easily deduct that the number of players who are left-handed is quite small.\n\nTo give some perspective, that same article also mentions that in the 125 years of Wimbledon only eight left-handed players have won the singles title. Of those eight, six were men and two were women.\n\nThis article will take a look at some of the best left-handed female players to ever take the tennis court. And of course, those two female champions mentioned above will be a part of this very special group of women.\n\nAs with any article, there are players who may not be listed, but in no way is that any disrespect to their career. In fact, if you know of a player who is not listed who you feel should be, do leave feedback.\n\nThe list is comprised of players from both the pre-Open Era and Open Era, and are listed from earliest to the present."
