Her best finish at the senior tournament is the quarter-final defeat she suffered against Elina Svitolina last year.\n\nAlthough, Swiatek does have pedigree – she won the Junior title at Wimbledon in 2018.\n\n5-0 record in Grand Slam finals for Swiatek\n\nAnother victory for Swiatek today means she remains unbeaten in Grand Slam finals.\n\nAnd, in those five finals, she has only lost one set: against Karolina Muchova in last year's French Open final.\n\nSwiatek is only the second female player to win all five of her first five Grand Slam finals in the Open Era after Monica Seles.\n\nSwiatek ranks joint-sixth in all-time French Open titles\n\nAs for the French Open in isolation, there are only five female players who have won it more than Swiatek.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, she is more than halfway to Chris Evert's Roland Garros record.\n\nMost women's French Open titles\n\nIncludes pre-Open era\n\nSeven titles – Chris Evert\n\nSix titles – Steffi Graf, Suzanne Lenglen\n\nFive titles – Margaret Court, Adine Masson\n\nFour titles – Iga Swiatek, Justine Henin, Kate Gillou, Jeanne Matthey, Helen Wills\n\nSwiatek moves onto five Grand Slam titles\n\nWe have mentioned that today brings up four French Open titles for Iga Swiatek and when added to her 2022 US Open triumph, she has five in total.\n\nThere are now 21 female players in history that have more Grand Slam titles than the Pole. And only 10 female players with more Grand Slams in the Open era.\n\nShe will certainly be hoping to add at least another one in the second half of 2024.\n\nWomen's final stats pack\n\nHere are the key stats from the 2024 women's French Open final.\n\nSwiatek 6-2, 6-1 Paolini\n\nAces: 1 – 1\n\nDouble faults: 0 – 2\n\nFirst serve percentage: 62% – 67%\n\nBreak points converted: 5/9 – 1/1\n\nTotal points: 57 – 31\n\nWinners: 18 – 7\n\nUnforced errors: 13 – 17\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSwiatek's 2024 clay court clean up\n\nAnd that game brings an end to a memorable season on clay for Swiatek.\n\nThe world No 1 arrived in Paris on the back of WTA-1000 triumphs in both Madrid and Rome — she becomes just the second woman after Serena Williams (2013) to win all three in the same year.\n\nSwiatek: 'I love this place'\n\nThen, the champion thanked her team and spoke about what it meant to her to win again in Paris.\n\n\"I want to thank my team, my family. Without them, I wouldn't be here,\" she said. \"I want to thank everyone who made this tournament possible, it's amazing to be here. I love this place, I wait every year to come back here.\n\n\"Merci Beaucoup. I was almost out of the tournament in the second round, so thank you guys for staying behind my back and cheering me. I also needed to believe that this one was possible. It's been a really emotional tournament, so thank you for supporting me.\"\n\nSwiatek starts with praise for Paolini\n\nSwiatek started her champions' speech with praise for Paolini and her team.\n\n\"Congrats for an amazing tournament,\" she said to her opponent. \"I'm really impressed with how you have been playing over these two weeks. With your game, I think you can do a lot, especially on clay.\n\n\"I hope we're going to have many more matches in final rounds. And congrats for your team as well.\"\n\nPaolini: 'I'm really proud of myself'\n\nPaolini continued.\n\n\"It has been very intense and I'm really happy, proud of me and my team to be here,\" she said. \"Today was tough but I'm really proud of myself anyway.\n\n\"Merci Beaucoup, Paris! You were cheering for me and that was unbelievable.\"\n\nPaolini: These have been the best days of my life\n\nTwo finals, with one still to come, are the yield of Paolini's time in Paris.\n\n\"I want to thank my team, my family, everybody who is there cheering for me and believing in me,\" said the Italian. \"Thank you very much. Congratulations to everybody who made this tournament possible.\n\n\"It's been 10, 15 days that I've been here and (they're) the best days of my life, I think. They're still going because tomorrow I have the doubles final.\n\n\"This is an unbelievable tournament.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPaolini: 'Toughest challenge in this sport' to play Swiatek in Paris\n\nFirst, Paolini addressed the crowd inside Court Phillipse-Chatrier.\n\n\"Hello everybody, thanks for coming! I really enjoyed playing on this court today,\" she said.\n\n\"Congratulations to you, Iga. To play you here is the toughest challenge in this sport. Congrats to your team. You're doing an amazing job; world No 1, many Slams.\n\n\"Just congratulations.\"\n\nInstant reaction to Swiatek's fourth French Open title\n\nHow Iga Swiatek turned around a first-set deficit\n\nThe bakery oven switched on, but only a breadstick (baguette?) emerged\n\nThree French Opens in a row for the world No. 1\n\nThe Athletic's Matthew Futterman and Charlie Eccleshare were on hand to deliver immediate reaction to another famous win for Iga Swiatek — check it out at the link below.\n\nGO FURTHER\n\nFrench Open final analysis: Iga Swiatek beats Jasmine Paolini at Roland Garros\n\nSwiatek lifts her French Open trophy high into the air!\n\nAnd now it is time for the champion to step forward.\n\nSmiling from ear to ear, she soaks in the adulation of the crowd, the appreciation of the two legends on stage and lifts the Suzanne-Lenglen Cup high into the Parisian sky.\n\nA formidable four-time champion and one we will surely be seeing again on the winners' podium at Roland Garros.\n\nJasmine Paolini is given the runner-up trophy\n\nThe crowd rise for Jasmine Paolini as she greets Martina Navratilova and Chris Evert and receives her trophy.\n\nThe Italian herself admitted that she never imagined she would have made the final at Roland Garros and what a fortnight she has had in Paris.\n\nFor some, a runners-up trophy might not be considered enough but the 28-year-old looks chuffed with her silverware, and rightly so!\n\nThe Suzanne-Lenglen Cup is on the court\n\nWith both players waiting patiently to speak after that final, the two trophies — led by the The Suzanne-Lenglen Cup — are brought out onto Court Philippe-Chatrier.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat a champion!\n\nIt is so easy to forget that Swiatek is only 23 years old when you watch a performance like that.\n\nShe gets it done in an hour and 10 minutes, winning 11 of the last 12 games of the match.\n\nIt brings up a fourth title for the world No 1 and a third in a row — she is only the third female player in the Open era to win this title in three consecutive years.\n\nPaolini gets on the board in the second set\n\nSwiatek 6-2 *5-1 Paolini\n\nPaolini, attempting to avoid a Grand Slam final bagel, starts well as she wins out the first baseline exchange of the game.\n\nAnd she has too much power again from the baseline for Swiatek two points later, moving to 30-15. But the Italian is pegged back by her own error again, sending a backhand harmlessly long under no real pressure from her opponent.\n\nAnd she avoids conceding a Championship point, firing a pass into the feet of Swiatek who had perhaps expected an easy volley having approached the net.\n\nPaolini then comes up with arguably her point of the match, stinging a brilliant forehand winner down on the line right into the corner of the court.\n\nLoad more updates"
