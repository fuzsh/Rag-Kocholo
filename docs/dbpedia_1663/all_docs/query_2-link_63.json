        "text": "Photo: Courtesy ITTF\n\nGermanyâ€™s women's team, plagued by injuries, sensationally reached the semifinals of the Olympic Games. Annett KAUFMANN, Xiaona SHAN, and Yuan WAN defeated Romania's conqueror, India, with an outstanding team performance in front of 6,400 spectators in the South Paris Arena in the morning, winning 3:1. The trio, competing in Paris without their top players Nina MITTELHAM (disc problems) and Ying HAN (Achilles tendon tear), will now fight for a spot in the final against the highly favored Japan on Thursday evening at 8 PM and will thus be competing for medals.\n\nIn place of HAN and MITTELHAM, Annett KAUFMANN and Yuan WAN, originally intended as substitutes, seamlessly filled in alongside the experienced but not in top form Xiaona SHAN in Paris. The German champion from Erfurt and the runner-up solved their tasks brilliantly, as they did in the 3:2 round of 16 thriller against the USA and again today against India. High school graduate KAUFMANN shone as the team's number one with impressive victories over the favored top-30 players Manika BATRA and Sreeja AKULA, while Yuan WAN, alongside Xiaona SHAN, contributed an immensely important point for Germany's 1:0 lead with a strong performance against Sreeja AKULA/Archana KAMATH. India, which had previously defeated European Games winner Romania, could only manage a hard-earned point for 1:2 from KAMATH against SHAN today.\n\nNational coach Tamara BOROS said after the victory, \"Today, we showed our best table tennis in the doubles and Annett's two singles. Yuan and Nana played a very good doubles match again. Last Friday, we tried this combination in training for the first time, and yesterday we played it officially for the first time. We couldn't be sure, but now we know: it works great.\"\n\nAnnett KAUFMANN received special praise: \"What Annett is playing here is world-class. It was a demonstration of how to play against long pimples. She knew exactly when to push and how to place her shots. I didn't have to say much between the sets. I am really proud of my girls and all the coaches who helped us reach this semifinal. \"\n\nWomen's Quarterfinal\n\nGermany - India 3:1\n\nYuan WAN/Xiaona SHAN - Sreeja AKULA/Archana KAMATH 3:1 (5, -8, 10, 6)\n\nAnnett KAUFMANN - Manika BATRA 3:1 (-8, 5, 7, 5)\n\nXiaona SHAN - Archana KAMATH 1:3 (-17, 1, -5, -9)\n\nAnnett KAUFMANN - Sreeja AKULA 3:0 (6, 7, 7)"
