        "text": "The final showdown of a thrilling Wimbledon 2024 women’s singles competition is set.\n\nAfter two weeks of great shots, shocks, and rising stars, the women’s tennis final takes place at SW19 on Saturday (13 July). For the seventh consecutive year, there will be a new name on the Venus Rosewater Dish: Barbora Krejcikova or Jasmine Paolini.\n\nKrejcikova of Czechia, who has already achieved her best ever Wimbledon result, is eyeing up a second career grand slam to add to her 2021 French Open title. On the other hand, Paolini is aiming to become the first Italian woman to win the grass court tournament in London, and just the third to win a singles grand slam.\n\nRead on for the key thing you need to know about the 2024 Wimbledon Championships women’s singles final.\n\nWimbledon 2024 – Olympic champion Barbora Krejcikova targets more silverware\n\nDo not be deceived by Krejcikova’s tournament seeding of 31, for she has proved that it is just a number.\n\nThe Czech has beaten three higher-ranked players en route to the final, most impressively defeating 2022 Wimbledon champion Elena Rybakina in a three-set semi-final thriller. She also overcame 11th seed Danielle Collins and 13th seed Jelena Ostapenko, both in straight sets, on road to the final.\n\nShe was emotional after booking her place in the final, paying tribute to her late coach and friend Jana Novotna, who passed away in 2017.\n\nKrejcikova said of the three-time Olympic medallist, “She won here in 1998. I remember thinking about her a lot. I have so many beautiful memories. When I step on court here I’m just fighting for every single ball. Because I think that’s what she’d want me to do. I just miss her so much.”\n\nThis is her first singles final of the 2024 season and her second grand slam final, winning on her sole appearance so far at Roland Garros in 2021. Krejcikova has grown comfortably into the tournament as she prepares for her first Wimbledon women's singles final.\n\nKrejcikova is a proven winner in doubles tennis. She has won all four grand slams in the women’s doubles and completed a threepeat in the Australian Open mixed doubles between 2019 and 2021.\n\nKrejcikova is also an Olympic champion, winning gold in the women’s doubles competition at Tokyo 2020 held in 2021. With Paris 2024 right around the corner and Krejcikova competing in the singles and doubles competitions, she would love to wrap up her preparations with a second singles grand slam title.\n\nTwo months ago, Paolini had never reached a grand slam final. Now it is two back-to-back.\n\nComing into Wimbledon 2024 as seventh seed and off the back of her 2024 French Open final appearance, expectations were high. But she managed to captivate fans in South West London and battle her way into Saturday’s showpiece final.\n\nPaolini’s road to the final saw her earn a walkover in the third set against the injured Madison Keys, before defeating Emma Navarro and then prevailing in a thriller against unseeded Croat Donna Vekic in the semi-final. That victory over Vekic is one to remember for the ages, winning a dramatic 10-8 tiebreak in the final set to progress to the final.\n\nNo Italian woman has ever reached the Wimbledon final, and now Paolini will aim to become the first Italian to win the Wimbledon women’s singles title.\n\nShe could also become just the third Italian female tennis player to win a grand slam, joining esteemed company in Olympians Francesca Schiavone and Flavia Pennetta, who won the 2010 French Open and 2015 US Open respectively.\n\nPaolini’s achievement to make consecutive grand slam finals, on different surfaces, in the same year, is a feat not to be underestimated. She joins the likes of Roger Federer, Serena Williams and Rafael Nadal in reaching both the French Open and Wimbledon finals in the same calendar year.\n\nWith a chance to put her name in the history books and win her first grand slam, Paolini will be raring to go as she vies for glory."
