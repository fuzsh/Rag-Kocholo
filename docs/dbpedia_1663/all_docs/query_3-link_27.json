        "text": "Event: 7th Hope Valley Junior Invitational\n\nHost Site: Hope Valley Country Club, Durham, N.C\n\nPlaying Dates: August 6-7, 2024\n\nSocial Media: @CGAgolf1909\n\nRelated: Championship Website | Scoring | History | Photos\n\nDURHAM, N.C. - Congratulations to Tanner Cadieux of Greensboro, N.C. and Rachel Joyce of Pinehurst, N.C. on winning the 7th Hope Valley Junior Invitational.\n\nThe 54-hole event was originally scheduled to take three days, but impending storms and inclement weather throughout the week shifted things around. Nearly two full rounds were played on Tuesday even with a two-hour rain delay during the first 18 holes.\n\nRound 2 was wrapped up Wednesday morning and participants played straight through to Round 3, setting up an exciting finish in both divisions.\n\nJoyce finished at even par for the championship with scores of 68-72-70 for a total of 210. She dominated the field and won by eight shots.\n\nCadieux reached 10-under, shooting 65-67-68, but needed four playoff holes against Aidan Wilson of Winston-Salem, N.C. before he officially secured the title.\n\nPlay was conducted in a shotgun format to attempt to beat out the storms headed Durham’s way. While it rained for most of the day on Tuesday, the sun actually made an appearance by the time the champions were crowned Wednesday afternoon.\n\nRound 1 kicked off at 9:30 a.m. Tuesday and players were shuttled to their starting holes before their long walk of the day began.\n\nNearly three hours later, play was suspended with storms in the area. To fill the time, players ate lunch and played cards together in the clubhouse.\n\nDespite it all, both Joyce and Cadieux reached red figures.\n\nToward the end of the opening round, Joyce grinded out birdies to shoot the only under par score of the girls’ division. Playing right into Round 2, she completed 14 holes before play was cut short due to darkness at 7:45 p.m.\n\nBy the end of Round 2 Wednesday morning, Joyce was at even-par overall. With some bumps in the road to start her Final Round, she rallied with a birdie on her tenth hole, getting back to even, before parring out the rest of the way.\n\nJoyce was most proud of her putting and said she converted some that she doesn’t normally make which helped propel her down the stretch.\n\nThe Hope Valley Invitational grants exemptions to other tournaments and Joyce is excited for those upcoming opportunities.\n\nCadieux similarly got off to a hot start and finished Round 1 strong with birdies on three of his last four holes. Wilson matched him at 5-under but both were two shots off Ryan Curran of Waxhaw, N.C. who fired an opening round 63, the lowest round of the week.\n\nWilson’s birdie on the 53rd hole matched Cadieux at 10-under to force the playoff. They played the par-three 18th four times before Cadieux ultimately won by making par.\n\nThis was Cadieux’s last junior event since he is starting his collegiate career at NC State this fall.\n\n“It means a lot, feels good, you know,” Cadieux said. “I didn’t win that much as a junior so winning this feels pretty good.”\n\nThe Carolinas Golf Association would like to thank the members and staff of Hope Valley Country Club. A special thanks goes out to Tournament Director, Allen Smith, Head Pro, Bob Byrnes and the HVCC professional staff, and Agronomy Team who worked incredibly hard preparing the course for this event.\n\nAbout the Carolinas Golf Association (CGA)\n\nThe CGA is a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit educational organization founded in 1909 to promote and protect the game of golf in the Carolinas by providing competitions, education, support, and benefits to golf clubs and golfers.
