Please review Wikiquote:Templates, especially the standard format of people articles, to determine how to edit this article to conform to a higher standard of article quality.\n\nAlthea Gibson (August 25, 1927 – September 28, 2003) was an American tennis player and professional golfer. She was also one of the first Black athletes to cross the color line of international tennis. She was the first African American to win a Grand Slam event (the 1956 French Championships). She won both the Wimbledon Championships and the US Nationals in 1957 and in 1958. She was voted Female Athlete of the Year by the Associated Press in both years. In all, she won 11 Grand Slam tournaments: five singles titles, five doubles titles, and one mixed doubles title. Gibson was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame and the International Women's Sports Hall of Fame. In the early 1960s she also became the first Black player to compete on the Women's Professional Golf Tour.\n\nQuotes\n\n[edit]\n\nPeople thought I was ruthless, which I was. I didn't give a darn who was on the other side of the net. I'd knock you down if you got in my way.\n\nI was lean, mean, and hungry.\n\nDuring a women in sports conference at Catonsville Community College (February 1980)[1]\n\nIt takes a lot to become a champion. You need to be a killer. If you can't look over that net and see Public Enemy Number One, then you aren't going to be a champ.\"\n\nDuring a women in sports conference at Catonsville Community College (February 1980)\n\nQuotes about person/work\n\n[edit]\n\n\"She is one of the greatest players who ever lived. . . Martina couldn't touch her. I think she'd beat the Williams sisters.\"\n\nBob Ryland\n\nWikipedia has an article about:\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\n↑ Brown, Ashley (2023).
