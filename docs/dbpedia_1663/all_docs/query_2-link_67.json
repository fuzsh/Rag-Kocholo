        "text": "Too many errors from the racket of Jabeur now as she nets a mid-court forehand, 30-15. Rally of the match so far, both players slicing and trying to move each other out of position then Jabeur fires a backhand winner down the line, 30-30.\n\nAnother lengthy rally and Jabeur comes out on top as Vondrousova nets a backhand, break point.\n\nGreat rally ends with Jabeur netting a drop shot, deuce. More aggressive tennis from Jabeur and Vondrousova slices a defensive forehand into the net.\n\nJabeur has a chance to hit a backhand down the line but net, deuce. Another beauty of a backhand winner down the line from Jabeur brings up a break point.\n\nBig first serve by Vondrousova and Jabeur’s return goes wide. Vondrousova slices another defensive forehand into the net with Jabeur on the attack, third break point. Jabeur return goes wide. She is furious with herself.\n\nJabeur nets an attempted drop shot and Vondrousova survives a very tough service game.\n\nBy Simon Briggs\n\nIn the absence of a political grudge match on finals weekend, Saturday promises to deliver a feelgood story instead: the “ons-stoppable” rise of Tunisia’s Ons Jabeur.\n\nNicknamed “the minister for happiness”, Jabeur is the most upbeat and enthusiastic tennis player to emerge since Roger Federer. There is a buoyancy about her, an irrepressible spirit which deflects the challenges of this stressful, globe-trotting lifestyle.\n\nLast month, the Netflix documentary series Break Point released an episode based around Jabeur’s near-miss at last year’s Wimbledon. The cameras followed her three-set defeat to Elena Rybakina, as well as the bitter aftermath: Jabeur weeping in the arms of husband Karim. Within minutes of the presentation ceremony, her coach Issam Jellali was assuring her that “Our big objective is next year. What you’re doing is historical, keep working like this.”\n\nRead more about Jabeur’s journey here.\n\nHello and welcome to coverage of the women’s singles final at Wimbledon between Ons Jabeur and Marketa Vondrousova.\n\nI think it’s fair to say not many experts would have predicted a showdown on the final Saturday of the tournament between the Tunisian and Czech.\n\nBut both players came through their respective draws and are a few hours away from claiming their first grand slam title.\n\nJabeur, a beaten finalist last year, has been driven by revenge and a desperation to join the esteemed list of Wimbledon champions. “Last year was my first final of a Grand Slam,” she said. “Definitely getting closer to winning the Grand Slam that I always wished.\n\n“I would say I always believed. But sometimes you would question and doubt it if it’s going to happen, if it’s ever going to happen. Being in the last stages, I think it does help you believe more. For me, I’m going to learn a lot from not only Wimbledon’s final but also US Open final, and give it my best. Maybe this year was all about trying two times and getting it right the third time.”\n\nFor Vondrousova, this is her second major final having lost to Ashleigh Barty in the 2019 French Open final and she hopes that experience will help today.\n\n“Yeah, I think it can definitely help in tough moments,” she said. “Also, like, I’ve been through it. Once I was very young, so I think it was just too much for me back then. Yeah, I think this can help you also on the way. You know what to do. You know you have to have good people around you.\n\n“Yeah, I mean, definitely it can help. I mean, I’m a bit older now also. Yeah, I think I’m a bit different person. Yeah, I’m just very happy to be through this again.”\n\nStay with us for build-up and analysis ahead of the final at 2pm."
