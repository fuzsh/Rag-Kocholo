        "text": "The 2024 FedEx St.Jude Championship will be played August 15-18, 2024\n\nTPC Southwind is the proud host of the FedEx St. Jude Championship.\n\nAs the first event in the 2024 FedExCup Playoffs, the FedEx St. Jude Championship will host the top 70 players in the FedExCup standings at the conclusion of the FedExCup Regular Season. With only 50 players advancing to the following week’s BMW Championship, the penultimate Playoffs event, the action at TPC Southwind promises to be hard-fought throughout the four days of competition. Lucas Glover is the defending champion and the top talent will be back to battle it out for this pristine title.\n\nThe PGA TOUR has held a tournament in Memphis every year since 1958 with Colonial Country Club playing host until the event moved permanently to TPC Southwind in 1989. FedEx first became the title sponsor in 1986 and has supported the tournament ever since. FedEx has been involved with the event for more than 30 years and has helped raise more than $38 million for St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital."
