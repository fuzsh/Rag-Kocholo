        "text": "More diving gold for China today? Yes, plus silver too, and while the rush of medals has slowed to a bit of a trickle, the one other certainty in life, apart from the two big ones, is Quan Hongchan standing on a podium.\n\nThe Chinese teenager and teammate Chen Yuxi battled it out for the top two spots in the women’s 10m platform, with Quan successfully defending the title she won as a 14-year-old in Tokyo.\n\nElsewhere, there were some big fights lined up, not least Yang Wenlu’s gold medal bout against Ireland’s Kellie Harrington in the women’s 60kg.\n\nAnd of course, we were back at the Stade de France for track and field, with finals in the women’s 200m, the men’s 1,500m and the women’s hammer throw.\n\nRead on for our coverage of day 11 at the Paris Olympics.\n\nMore from our coverage:\n\nReporting by Mike Chan and Paul McNamara in Paris, and Josh Ball, Ira Gorawara, Meredith Chen, Sylvia Ma, Angeline Jiang, Lars Hamer, Andrew Richardson and Tom Bell in Hong Kong"
