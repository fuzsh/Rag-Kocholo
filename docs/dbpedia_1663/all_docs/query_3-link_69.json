        "text": "Padraig Harrington’s personal reflections on the PGA Championship\n\nMy victory at the 90th PGA Championship at Oakland Hills Country Club on August 10, 2008, in Bloomfield Township, Michigan—when I became the first European to win the tournament since Scotland’s Tommy Armour in 1930—is one of the highlights of my career. My chief competitors that day were Sergio García, whom I had defeated in a play-off the year before at the Open Championship to win my first major, and Ben Curtis.\n\nThe 2008 PGA Championship occurred just three weeks after I successfully defended my Open Championship, and it was hard for me to believe that I was so quickly in contention for a third major. Fatigue and dehydration, however, were my enemies that week, and for logical reasons. First, I was still struggling to get over the excitement and events surrounding my second Open Championship win. Second, the course was exceptionally difficult, leading several competitors that week to complain about the length of the rough and “unfair” pin placements. Winning championships in golf is often more of a mental feat than a physical accomplishment, and the PGA Championship that year would prove no different.\n\nAfter the second round I was six shots off the lead and felt awful. I was mentally fried, and my coordination had gone. I spoke to my trainer, and, after a few questions, he decided that I must be dehydrated. This actually made me feel better, as hydration was something I could control. I immediately drank more liquids and rested as much as possible.\n\nThe third round was tough, and, due to thunderstorms, play was stopped after nine holes and delayed until Sunday morning. This was fine by me, as I could get more rest and everyone would be playing in similar conditions the next morning. I ended up shooting 66 for my third round, making me one over par for the tournament. I returned home and slept for a few hours while the leaders were still playing, and by the time I got up the leaders had finished. I was now four strokes off the lead and positioned in the second-to-last group, with Sergio and Charlie Wi, for our final round. I was in a good position to get into contention.\n\nIn the major championships, the real tournament begins on the final nine holes on Sunday. Due to my group’s finishing the third round earlier that morning, our final round did not begin until the afternoon. I started out well, making a par on the first hole and then a birdie on the second. In my mind Sergio, my playing partner, was the man to chase. On the eighth hole I hit the green in two with a good five wood, and on the ninth I made a par from the right bunker. But it still seemed like Sergio’s tournament to win, as he had played well on the front nine and made several good saves. However, the back nine was still to come.\n\nI birdied the 10th hole after hitting an eight iron to within about 15 feet (4.6 metres) of the pin to get me to one under par. I then parred the 11th but had a bad drive on the par-five 12th. I had a risky second shot but felt at this stage that I needed to make some birdies, so I hit a big hook with a five wood around a tree. The ball hit the middle of the green and ran over the back, from where I got up and down for a birdie. This got me to one behind Sergio as he made a par. I finally caught him on the 13th but then bogeyed the next hole. Sergio hit the flagstick with his second shot on the 15th, and I hit my second shot to within about 12 feet (3.6 metres) from the pin, just beyond Sergio’s placement; we both missed and tapped in for pars, leaving me still one shot behind.\n\nThe tournament reached a critical stage on the 16th hole. After two good drives, Sergio was first to play. He was farther back than me, and his second shot landed in the water. It was a critical opening, yet in trying to play safe I pulled my eight-iron second shot into the bunker. I hit a good bunker shot, but a stone got between the clubface and the ball, causing my ball to not spin and check, which meant I was left with a long 14-foot (4.3-metre) putt for par. Sergio made a 4-foot (1.2-metre) putt for bogey. I knew this was the opportunity I had to seize. I hit a great putt and saved par, drawing even with Sergio with two holes to play.\n\nAs I walked to the 17th tee, I finally felt that the tournament was there for the taking. I hit a five iron at the pin, as did Sergio. In fact, when we walked onto the green, there were two balls close to the hole, and neither of us knew which ball was whose. In fact, mine was farthest away, which meant that I would putt first. I holed it for a birdie, while Sergio missed his putt. I now had a one-stroke lead, and I felt victory would be mine if I could simply make par on the 18th, one of the most difficult and demanding holes on the course.\n\nClosing out a victory on the 72nd hole of a major tournament is seldom easy, and I did myself no favours as I pushed my drive and landed in a bunker. My ball was close to the bunker’s face, and I was forced into an awkward stance, so shooting for the green was out of the question. I hit an eight iron but caught it fat and landed in the rough. Fortunately, I was left with a good lie and was able to get a club on the ball. I hit a good seven iron just right of the pin to about 18 feet (5.5 metres) from the hole. Sergio had hit his drive to the right and his second stroke into the greenside bunker, from where he played to within 9 feet (2.7 metres) of the hole. As I lined up my putt, I felt this was the stroke to win the coveted Wanamaker Trophy. It was a nice putt to have, as I saw the line immediately, but it was a double breaker and one I knew would come back from the left at the very end. I hit an excellent putt, and I felt I had holed it as soon as it left the club. Watching the ball roll in is a memory for a lifetime.\n\nSergio bogeyed the 18th, leaving him two strokes behind me, and from the reporters’ hut I watched Ben Curtis bogey the 17th, which meant he needed an eagle on the 18th hole to catch me. Once his second shot came to a stop on the green, a third victory in a major tournament was mine. I was PGA Champion, and the exhilaration I felt is still hard to describe."
