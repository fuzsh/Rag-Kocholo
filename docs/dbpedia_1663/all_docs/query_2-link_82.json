        "text": "Male Tennis Players\n\nThere are plenty of active French tennis players on the men’s side of the game, but some of the country’s most successful and famous players are now retired.\n\nDuring the 1920s, one group of men nicknamed The Four Musketeers had a significant and lasting impact on the game. They included doubles specialist Jean Borotra and singles players Jacques Brugnon, Henri Cochet, and René Lacoste.\n\nBeyond their success, the four also helped lead the French Davis Cup team to victory over the United States in 1927, resulting in the country building out a new venue in Paris, now the location of Roland Garros a.k.a, the French Open.\n\nKeep reading to learn about 11 influential male French tennis players that are well worth knowing as a tennis fan.\n\nRené Lacoste\n\nAlthough he’s not the most successful French tennis player ever, his legacy extends far beyond the court as a businessman whose name is the best known of any on this list.\n\nHe is responsible for the start of the iconic fashion brand with the crocodile logo and created the first patented steel tennis racquet with tubes instead of solid metal. This frame became known as the T-2000, famously used by Jimmy Connors and Bill Jean King during their careers.\n\nOf course, René wasn’t a slouch on the court, and he’s undoubtedly one of the best to come out of France. Having reached world No. 1, he won seven singles and three doubles Grand Slam titles.\n\nAt the 1924 Olympic Games in Paris, he claimed a Bronze medal in doubles with Jean Borotra, and as one member of the Four Musketeers, he helped France win the 1927 and 1928 Davis Cup.\n\nBirthday July 2, 1904 Retired 1932 Highest Rank 1 Career Titles 24 singles Grand Slam Titles 7 singles / 3 doubles Olympic Medals Bronze doubles\n\nHenri Cochet\n\nBy far the most successful male tennis player to come out of France, Henri Cochet’s resume speaks for itself.\n\nDuring his career, he reached world No. 1, earned seven singles, five doubles, and three mixed doubles Grand Slam titles, and helped France win the Davis Cup for six years straight from 1927 to 1932. He also earned a silver medal in singles and doubles with René Lacoste at Paris’ 1924 Olympic Games.\n\nIn 1933, Henri moved from amateur to professional, so it’s likely he would have achieved more success at Grand Slam tournaments which the pros weren’t allowed to play until 1968, well after he retired.\n\nBirthday December 14, 1901 Retired 1958 Highest Rank 1 Career Titles 90 singles Grand Slam Titles 7 singles / 5 doubles Olympic Medals Silver singles and doubles\n\nJean Borotra\n\nAnother member of the Four Musketeers, Jean, only reached world No. 2, but his success on the court goes down as one of the best.\n\nHe achieved plenty of success in singles with four Grand Slam titles, but he was also a highly accomplished doubles player with nine additional Grand Slam titles and five in mixed-doubles.\n\nJean’s legacy lives on with the Jean Borotra Sportsmanship Award, given annually since 1998 at the Wimbledon Championships in London.\n\nBirthday August 13, 1898 Retired 1956 Highest Rank 2 Career Titles 69 singles Grand Slam Titles 4 singles / 9 doubles Olympic Medals Bronze doubles\n\nMax Decugis\n\nUp until 2014, Max Decugis held more titles at the French Championships, now known as the French Open, than any other player, with eight. Rafael Nadal surpassed this record and currently has 13 wins.\n\nHowever, it’s worth noting that the tournament was only open to French club members up until 1925, so logically the record books don’t consider Max’s wins Grand Slam titles.\n\nBeyond his 41 titles throughout his career, Max also achieves more success at the Olympics than any French player. He has gold in mixed doubles and silver and bronze in doubles.\n\nBirthday September 24, 1882 Retired 1926 Highest Rank 10 Career Titles 41 singles Grand Slam Titles 1 doubles Olympic Medals Gold singles, Gold doubles, Bronze doubles\n\nAndré Gobert\n\nIn 1909, André Gobert joined the amateur tour, and throughout his career, he’d win 26 titles. He never managed to win a Grand Slam in singles, but he did reach the finals of Wimbledon in 1912, losing to Arthur Gore of Great Britain in four sets.\n\nThe year prior, Gobert did manage to claim a doubles Grand Slam title at Wimbledon with his partner and fellow Frenchman Max Decugis.\n\nPerhaps André’s crowning achievement was his double Gold medals in singles and doubles at the 1912 Stockholm Olympics.\n\nBirthday September 30, 1890 Retired 1926 Highest Rank 3 Career Titles 26 singles Grand Slam Titles 1 doubles Olympic Medals Gold singles, Gold doubles\n\nYannick Noah\n\nOne of France’s most celebrated tennis players is Yannik Noah, who won the French Open in 1983, breaking a 37-year drought for a male tennis player to win the tournament.\n\nOf course, his success extended far beyond his sole Grand Slam singles crown in France. Yannick won 23 titles throughout his career and achieved a career-high world ranking of No. 3 in 1986.\n\nHe also attained a world No. 1 ranking in doubles that same year and won the French Open in doubles in 1984.\n\nSince retiring, Yannick has achieved moderate success as a singer, having released several albums, and he continues to perform.\n\nBirthday May 18, 1960 Retired 1996 Highest Rank 3 Career Titles 23 singles / 16 doubles Grand Slam Titles 1 singles / 1 doubles Olympic Medals –\n\nJacques Brugnon\n\nThe fourth member of the Four Musketeers, Jacques Brugnon, was a successful singles player with 21 titles and a career-high ranking of No. 9. However, he primarily goes down in the history books as a doubles specialist who won ten Grand Slam titles for the discipline.\n\nJacques also helped lead the French team to five Davis Cup titles from 1927 to 1932, missing out only in 1929.\n\nBirthday May 11, 1895 Retired – Highest Rank 9 Career Titles 21 singles Grand Slam Titles TBD singles / 10 doubles Olympic Medals Silver doubles\n\nYvon Petra\n\nUntil Yannik Noah’s triumph at the French Open in 1983, Yvon was the last Frenchman to win the title at the Grand Slam in 1946. Soon after, in 1948, Yvon turned pro, so he couldn’t contest additional Grand Slam events as they were exclusively for amateurs.\n\nAt the end of his career, he had claimed 18 titles and reached a career-high world No. 4 ranking in 1946.\n\nBirthday March 8, 1916 Retired 1955 Highest Rank 4 Career Titles 18 singles / TBD doubles Grand Slam Titles 1 singles / 2 doubles Olympic Medals –\n\nAndré Vacherot\n\nDuring his career as a tennis player, André won the French Championships four times in 1894, 1895, 1896, and 1901. However, it’s worth noting that the tournament was only open to French club members until 1925.\n\nBirthday June 5, 1877 Retired Unknown Highest Rank Unknown Career Titles Unknown Grand Slam Titles 4 singles / 2 doubles Olympic Medals –\n\nPaul Aymé\n\nLike André Vacherot, Paul Aymé won the French Championships four times during his career. However, what distinguished his results from André’s is that he did it consecutively from 1897 to 1900.\n\nBirthday July 29, 1869 Retired Unknown Highest Rank Unknown Career Titles Unknown Grand Slam Titles 4 singles Olympic Medals –\n\nMaurice Germot\n\nMaurice is a three-time French Championship winner and doubles Gold medalist from the 1912 Stockholm Olympic Games. That year he partnered with countryman Max Decugis.\n\nBirthday November 15, 1882 Retired Unknown Highest Rank Unknown Career Titles Unknown Grand Slam Titles 3 singles Olympic Medals Gold doubles\n\nFemale Tennis Players\n\nSome of the most famous female tennis players from France competed and achieved success more recently, so you may be familiar with their names.\n\nHowever, to track down one of history’s most celebrated French tennis players, we have to step back to the early 1900s.\n\nSuzanne Lenglen\n\nKnown as the greatest female tennis player during the Open Era, i.e., before 1968, Suzanne Lenglen is one of the game’s most highly accomplished and best-known athletes.\n\nNicknamed La Divine, she became the inaugural world No. 1 in 1921 and held that position until 1926. Much of her success came at Wimbledon, where she won singles and doubles six times from 1919 to 1925.\n\nOne of her most intriguing wins was against prominent American tennis player Helen Wills in the United States, dubbed the Match of the Century, which she won. Suzanne is also well-known for helping lay the foundation for the professional tours before the Open Era began in 1968.\n\nShe earned 83 singles and 74 doubles titles throughout her career, and at the 1920 Olympic Games, she won gold in singles and mixed doubles and bronze in women’s doubles.\n\nBirthday May 24, 1899 Retired 1926 (amateur) Highest Rank 1 Career Titles 83 singles / 74 doubles Grand Slam Titles 8 singles, 8 doubles Olympic Medals Gold singles, Bronze doubles\n\nAmélie Mauresmo\n\nThe most recent world No 1. on our list of women tennis players from France, Amélie Mauresmo, competed until December 2009.\n\nIn 2004, she ascended to world No. 1, becoming the first French tennis player to hit the mark since the WTA tracked rankings on computers. Uniquely, she did so without having won a Grand Slam title.\n\nOf course, all that would change in 2006 when she logged a hugely successful year that included titles at the Australian Open and Wimbledon.\n\nPost-retirement, Mauresmo has continued to make a name for herself coaching a range of successful tennis players, including Michaël Llodra,\n\nVictoria Azarenka, Marion Bartoli., Andy Murray, and Lucas Pouille.\n\nIn 2022, Amiélie Mauresmo became the first female tennis director at the French Open, solidifying her as one of the most famous French players to ever step on a court.\n\nBirthday July 5, 1979 Retired 2009 Highest Rank 1 Career Titles 25 singles / 3 doubles Grand Slam Titles 2 singles Olympic Medals Silver singles\n\nMary Pierce\n\nThe last French tennis player, male or female, to win the French Open, Mary Pierce, achieved a high level of success during her career.\n\nIn 1995 she ascended to a career-high world No. 2, and she claimed four total Grand Slam titles, two in singles, 1 in doubles, and 1 in mixed doubles. In total, she won 18 singles and ten doubles titles.\n\nBorn in Canada to her French mother and American father, she has citizenship in all three countries. However, she chose to represent France in team competitions, including the Fed Cup, in which she helped lead the team to wins in 1997 and 2003.\n\nBirthday January 15, 1975 Retired 2006 Highest Rank 3 Career Titles 18 singles / 10 doubles Grand Slam Titles 2 singles / 1 doubles Olympic Medals –\n\nMarion Bartoli\n\nKnown for her unique style of play, using two hands for her forehand and backhand, Marion Bartoli became one of the most famous French tennis players on the women’s side of the game.\n\nDuring her career, she reached the quarter-finals of every Grand Slam event but only managed to win one at Wimbledon in 2013, defeating Sabine Lisicki in straight sets.\n\nUnfortunately, shortly after her victory, Marion retired from tennis due to ongoing pain and injuries from her time in the sport. Although she attempted a comeback in 2018, it didn’t go super well as injuries continued to set her back.\n\nBirthday October 2, 1984 Retired 2013 Highest Rank 7 Career Titles 8 singles / 3 doubles Grand Slam Titles 1 singles Olympic Medals –\n\nJeanne Matthey\n\nA successful French tennis player in the early 1900s, Jeanne Matthey is a four-time French Open Champion in singles and doubles. She won all of her titles in consecutive years from 1909 to 1912.\n\nAfter being wounded in World War I serving as a nurse on the front lines, she gave up tennis, but her success remains noteworthy.\n\nBirthday January 25, 1886 Retired Unknown Highest Rank Unknown Career Titles Unknown Grand Slam Titles 4 singles / 4 doubles Olympic Medals –\n\nKate Gillou\n\nFrench tennis player Kate Gillou goes down in history as a four-time winner of the French Championships from 1904 to 1908.\n\nBirthday:\n\nRetired: –\n\nHighest Rank: –\n\nTitles: –\n\nGrand Slams: 4 singles\n\nOlympics: –\n\nBirthday February 19, 1887 Retired Unknown Highest Rank Unknown Career Titles Unknown Grand Slam Titles 4 singles Olympic Medals –\n\nAdine Masson\n\nThe first-ever winner at the French Championships, Adine Masson, claimed five wins at the tournament, even though two were uncontested in 1898 and 1899. In 1907, she won in doubles as well.\n\nBirthday Unknown Retired Unknown Highest Rank Unknown Career Titles Unknown Grand Slam Titles 5 singles / 1 doubles Olympic Medals –"
