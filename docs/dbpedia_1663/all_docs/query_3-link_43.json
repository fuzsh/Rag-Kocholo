        "text": "Humphrey, Conway take titles\n\nMILLSBORO, Del. – Tom Humphrey never forgot the moment when he lost it. He didn’t know how he could get it back.\n\n| Scorecards | History | Photo Gallery | Round One Recap |\n\nClose to 30 years ago, Humphrey teed it up for the first time in the Delaware Amateur. It was the first time he experienced the yips with the putter. In his first real competitive test, nonetheless. A brilliant driver of the golf ball and a steadfast iron player, Humphrey wasn’t sure how he could hit 14 greens and shoot 90.\n\nBut it motivated the University of Virginia graduate to work to find a solution.\n\n“Putting has always been a weakness for me,” Humphrey said. “I have gone back and forth with putters over the years. At the time, I wanted to use a long putter but I didn’t like the thought of using one. But now the long putter has helped me remain competitive. When you are under the gun, you learn what parts of your game you have. It was nice to feel like I had my putter today.”\n\nHumphrey, aided by a newfound trust and consistency with his flatstick, claimed the 9th Delaware Super-Senior Championship Tuesday at Plantation Lakes Golf & Country Club (par 72, 5,836 yards).\n\nIn the Women’s Division (par 72, 5,324 yards), Little Mill Country Club’s Anne Conway took the title after a two-day total of 193.\n\n“It means a lot,” Humphrey, 72, of Rockland, Del., said. “I am proud of the way I played, which was quite steady. My putter held up pretty well. I wasn’t in too much trouble. That’s easy to do out here, so I am pleased.”\n\nHis final round of 74 was good enough for a two-day total of 147 and a two-shot victory over Mike Moser of Kennett Square Golf & Country Club and Kevin Sartell of Wild Quail Golf & Country Club.\n\nTwo clutch 4-footers for birdie on Nos. 7 (par 5, 467 yards) and 9 (par 4, 336 yards), steadied a wobbly ship for Humphrey after bogeying two of his first three holes. Bogeys on Nos. 10 (par 4, 287 yards) and 11 (par 3, 157 yards) put Humphrey in a step on the gas mindset.\n\nHe capitalized on No. 13 (par 5, 483 yards) after canning a 15-footer for his third and final birdie of the day. Humphrey closed out his round with three consecutive pars. Including a nice two-putt par on No. 17 (par 4, 378 yards) from 30 feet that had to navigate a steep slope. He buried a nervy 4-footer on the last (par 5, 466 yards) for par and the title.\n\nWith the victory, Humphrey joins Wilmington Country Club clubmate Steve Walczak as the only players to win the Delaware Senior Amateur and Delaware Super-Senior Championship. Humphrey claimed the Delaware Senior Amateur in 2018 at Deerfield Golf Club. Walczak claimed this championship in 2023 at Frog Hollow Golf Club and the Delaware Senior Amateur in 2015 at Wild Quail.\n\n“Golf is just a game I love,” Humphrey said. “No matter where you are in your own game, you can always try to get a little bit better. What I have been enjoying lately is playing more golf with my wife, Mary. She has been a golf widow since she was 16 but because of the time she spent with our grandkids she never had time to get better. The last couple of years she’s started playing more and has been doing well. That has meant a lot to me to see her improve and want to play more.”\n\nMary, a former yoga instructor, has been helpful in keeping Humphrey on the golf course. He places a priority on his health and wellness. He lifts weights and stretches to remain flexible. A primary reason he’s been able to stay competitive for so long.\n\n“To be able to play competitive golf at my age is truly a blessing,” Humphrey said. “I have tried to keep myself in good shape. I love to compete and love to play golf. I want to do it as long as I can. All of the effort I put into being able to play golf is worth it on days like today. Days like this don’t come along very often. We play in a ton of events and to win is a special day.”"
