        "text": "A new college football champion will be crowned on Monday.\n\nThe Michigan Wolverines and Washington Huskies will square off in the 2024 College Football Playoff National Championship at NRG Stadium in Houston. Both teams will look to cap off undefeated seasons after winning thrilling CFP semifinals.\n\nNo. 1 Michigan came from behind to win an overtime thriller against No. 4 Alabama in the Rose Bowl. No. 2 Washington then fended off No. 3 Texas in an exhilarating Sugar Bowl to set up the championship matchup.\n\nWhile both schools are making their debut in the CFP National Championship, Michigan brings much more championship experience into the 2024 title game. The Wolverines have nine national championships in their history with the last one coming in 1997, when they were co-champions with Nebraska. The Huskies have only been named consensus champions, earning the title with Miami in 1991.\n\nAs indicated by split championships, the sport went through several systems to determine a top team before landing on its current College Football Playoff format. More change is on the way, too, with the Michigan-Washington matchup serving as the end of an era for the CFP.\n\nAhead of Monday’s showdown, here’s a look back at recent national title winners and the system in place for their championships:\n\nBowl Coalition and Bowl Alliance champions by year\n\nNCAAF\n\nFrom 1968 (the year the AP poll began crowning its champion after bowl games) to 1992, the No. 1 and No. 2 teams entering bowl season only matched up in a bowl game six times.\n\nAfter Consensus National Champions were announced for the 1990 and 1991 seasons, the Bowl Coalition went into place beginning with the 1992 season. The coalition was formed through an agreement between conferences and bowl games to set up a national championship game between the top two teams each season. After three seasons, the coalition was reconfigured and became the Bowl Alliance, which lasted for three seasons, as well.\n\nThere was a major flaw in the Bowl Coalition and Bowl Alliance being used to crown a national champion: the Big Ten and Pac-10 were not involved since both conferences were contractually obligated to play in the Rose Bowl. The Tournament of Roses Association did not allow either conference champion to play in a title game, even if one of them was ranked No. 1 or No. 2.\n\nHere are the championship game results from the years under the Bowl Coalition and Bowl Alliance:\n\n1993 Sugar Bowl: No. 2 Alabama 34, No. 1 Miami 13\n\n1994 Orange Bowl: No. 1 Florida State 18, No. 2 Nebraska 16\n\n1995 Orange Bowl: No. 1 Nebraska 24, No. 3 Miami 17\n\n1996 Fiesta Bowl: No. 1 Nebraska 62, No. 2 Florida 24\n\n1997 Sugar Bowl: No. 3 Florida 52, No. 1 Florida State 20\n\n1998 Orange Bowl: No. 2 Nebraska 42, No. 3 Tennessee 17\n\nEven with the Bowl Coalition in place, it still did not lead to a consensus champion. For the 1997 season, Nebraska was named the national champion via the Coaches’ Poll following its Orange Bowl win over Tennessee, but No. 1 Michigan was named the national champion via the Associated Press after winning the Rose Bowl over No. 7 Washington State.\n\nBCS National Championship winners by year\n\nThe Bowl Championship Series was put in place beginning with the 1998 season. The Big Ten and Pac-10, along with the Rose Bowl, joined Bowl Alliance’s member conferences to create a system that determined five bowl matchups between 10 of the top-ranked teams.\n\nKnown for its combination of polls and computer selection methods, the BCS did not have a standalone title game until the 2006 season. For eight years, the top two teams squared off for the national championship via a rotating group of four elite bowls: the Fiesta Bowl, Sugar Bowl, Orange Bowl and Rose Bowl.\n\nHere are the BCS Championship contests from 1999 through 2006 (games listed by the year in which the game was played, not the season as a whole):\n\n1999 Fiesta Bowl: No. 1 Tennessee 23, No. 2 Florida State 16\n\n2000 Sugar Bowl: No. 1 Florida State 46, No. 2 Virginia Tech 29\n\n2001 Orange Bowl: No. 1 Oklahoma 13, No. 2 Florida State 2\n\n2002 Rose Bowl: No. 1 Miami 37, No. 2 Nebraska 14\n\n2003 Fiesta Bowl: No. 2 Ohio State 31, No. 1 Miami 24 (2OT)\n\n2004 Sugar Bowl: No. 2 LSU 21, No. 1 Oklahoma 14\n\n2005 Orange Bowl: No. 1 USC 55, No. 2 Oklahoma 19\n\n2006 Rose Bowl: No. 2 Texas 41, No. 1 USC 38\n\nBCS National Championship Game winners by year\n\nThe national title was determined through the BCS National Championship Game for the 2006 season through the 2013 season. The championship was a standalone contest that pinned the top two ranked teams entering bowl season.\n\nHere is the winner from each BCS National Championship Game (the BCS named its championship games based on the year in which the game was played, not the season as a whole):\n\n2007: No. 2 Florida 41, No. 1 Ohio State 14\n\n2008: No. 2 LSU 38, No. 1 Ohio State 24\n\n2009: No. 2 Florida 24, No. 1 Oklahoma 14\n\n2010: No. 1 Alabama 37, No. 2 Texas 21\n\n2011: No. 1 Auburn 22, No. 2 Oregon 19\n\n2012: No. 2 Alabama 21, No. 1 LSU 0\n\n2013: No. 2 Alabama 42, No. 1 Notre Dame 14\n\n2014: No. 1 Florida State 34, No. 2 Auburn 31\n\nCollege Football Playoff National Championship winners by year\n\nThe College Football Playoff system replaced the BCS beginning with the 2014 season. The CFP puts the top four ranked teams in a single-elimination bracket with semifinals being played in bowl games. The winners of the two semifinals then match up in the CFP National Championship.\n\nHere are the final scores for the CFP National Championship game since it crowned its first champion in the 2014 season (the College Football Playoff also names its championship games based on the year in which it is played):\n\n2015: No. 4 Ohio State 42, No. 2 Oregon 20\n\n2016: No. 2 Alabama 45, No. 1 Clemson 40\n\n2017: No. 2 Clemson 35, No. 1 Alabama 31\n\n2018: No. 4 Alabama 26, No. 3 Georgia 23 (OT)\n\n2019: No. 2 Clemson 44, No. 1 Alabama 16\n\n2020: No. 1 LSU 42, No. 3 Clemson 25\n\n2021: No. 1 Alabama 52, No. 3 Ohio State 24\n\n2022: No. 3 Georgia 33, No. 1 Alabama 18\n\n2023: No. 1 Georgia 65, No. 3 TCU 7\n\nWhat is the new College Football Playoff format?\n\nAfter a champion is crowned Monday night at NRG Stadium, the College Football Playoff will move to a 12-team format.\n\nTeams seeded Nos. 1-4 will get a bye to the quarterfinals, while teams seeded Nos. 5-12 will play first-round games at the home field of the higher-seeded team. The quarterfinals and semifinals will be played in the following bowl games: the Fiesta Bowl, Peach Bowl, Rose Bowl, Sugar Bowl, Orange Bowl and Cotton Bowl.\n\nThe semifinal winners will then face off in the College Football Playoff National Championship.\n\nWhere will next year’s College Football Playoff National Championship be played?\n\nThe first title game under the new format will be played at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta on Jan. 20, 2025."
