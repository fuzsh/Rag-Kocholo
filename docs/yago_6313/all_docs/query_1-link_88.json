        "text": "Craig Ferguson is best known as the funny host of CBS’ Late Late Show, but his new role voicing a character in Disney/Pixar’s Brave may be more reflective his personality.\n\nPHOTOS: From ‘Toy Story’ to ‘Brave’: Your Essential Guide to Pixar’s 13 Best Movies\n\nThe comedian, who voices Lord Macintosh, one of three Scottish lords in the film, tells The Hollywood Reporter that the artists at Pixar got his inner personality just right.\n\n“They drew me like I am on the inside,” he tells THR. “Also, I think that when you see drawings — and you see them quiet early on — they show them to you before they even begin the animation process, I think everyone thinks, do I look like that? And I suppose I do a little bit.”\n\nFerguson, who describes his character as a “cantankerous traditionalist, a pompous, angry, difficult human being,” admits to THR that he can sometimes be a bit on the cranky side himself.\n\n“Plus, as a I get older, crankiness becomes more fashionable,” he adds.\n\nFILM REVIEW: Brave\n\nBrave follows a rambunctious young Scottish princess names Merida (Kelly Macdonald) who bucks the tradition of being wed to the lord who wins the local games competition. When she makes a wish to change her fate, she’s forced to use her bravery and skills as an archer to undo a terrible curse and right her wrong.\n\n“I think sometimes that people think brave means not being afraid, which of course it doesn’t mean that at all. It means that you’re afraid, but you move past that and do it anyway, do what you think is right,” Ferguson tells THR about the concept of bravery.\n\nSTORY: LAFF: Dolby Atmos Debuts at Disney/Pixar’s ‘Brave’ Premiere\n\nThe voice cast features several Scottish actors other than Ferguson and MacDonald, including Kevin McKidd and Billy Connolly, who plays the king, Fergus. Ferguson tells THR that working with Connolly on a film was a special highlight for him.\n\n“To me, Billy is like Elvis to a musician,” he says. “Before Billy, there was nothing. Billy’s my hero. He was a standup comedian in Scotland when there were no standup comedians in Scotland that I knew of.”\n\nBrave opens in theaters on June 22.\n\nWatch THR’s complete interview with Craig Ferguson above."
