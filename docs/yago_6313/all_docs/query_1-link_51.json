        "text": "3.4K\n\nKathie Lee Gifford hasn’t had a day off in four decades. Between Live! with Regis and Kathie Lee and The Today Show, she woke up with America for almost 30 years.\n\nThat’s a lot of caffeine (and wine!) On April 5, 2019, America’s favorite morning show host/author/singer/actor/friend/and mom said farewell to her Today Show family. Artistically, she was looking to grow. “If you’re not being artistic, you die on the vine… I want to do something beautiful, and brand new and learn something brand new on the day I die,” she told her NBC family.\n\nCue Then Came You. Then Came You is a romantic comedy that is written, produced by and stars Kathie Lee Gifford. It was a special project for Kathie that was inspired by her friend, Craig Ferguson. After working together for a week at NBC, Kathie Lee tells The Knockturnal’s Kinsey Schofield, that she was motivated to create an opportunity for the both of them. “He brings out something in me,” she smiles. The chemistry was there, they love working together. After a week at The Today Show, Craig got on an airplane back home to Los Angeles. By the time his plane landed, Kathie Lee had written six scenes out for the two of them!\n\nCraig shared the script with his wife, Megan. She loved it! After 40 years in the business, he admits that playing the role of the love interest is a unique opportunity… but not really when he’s one to Megan every day! “Don’t let her tell you otherwise,” Ferguson jokes. “She’s the luckiest woman in the world!”\n\nCraig also wants to set the record straight about a nasty rumor that has yet to actually be circulated… he does not use a foot double. He told The Knockturnal that the “sexy” feet seen throughout Then Came You actually belong to the man, the myth, the legend… Craig Ferguson. Hopefully, you heard it here first.\n\nThen Came You is sincerely sweet and the objective… even sweeter. Kathie Lee explains, “Once you reach a certain age, you become an invisible person. You’re just invisible. No one is really interested in what you have to say, nobody asks you how you’re doing. There are 17 million widows in the world, in America, 5 million widowers. No one writes movies for them. I wanted to write about loneliness.”\n\nIf that doesn’t inspire you to pick up the phone and tell someone you love them, I don’t know what will.\n\nThen Came You is available for one night nationwide via Fathom Events September 30th, 2020 then available on-demand/digital October 2nd, 2020. The film stars Kathie Lee Gifford, Craig Ferguson, and Elizabeth Hurley.\n\nPS. If you haven’t watched the interview at the top of the screen yet, you must. It is hilarious."
