        "text": "Some fun news for fans of stand-up comedy. A comedy and TV talk show legend is coming back to Evansville. Craig Ferguson is bringing his 2023 The Fancy Rascal Tour to the Victory Theatre later this year.\n\nFerguson, of course, is a Scottish-American comedian, actor, writer and TV host. He's likely best known for hosting The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson on CBS. That show ran from 2005 through 2014 and won him a Peabody Award. He snagged that award for his interview with African archbishop Desmond Tutu.\n\nIf you missed that interview, check it out here.\n\nIn addition to a Peabody Award, Ferguson won two Daytime Emmy Awards for his work on Celebrity Name Game!\n\nRemember this? This show was a blast.\n\nCelebrity Name Game ran from 2014 through 2017.\n\nIn addition to being in front of the camera, Ferguson has also voiced some popular animated characters behind the scenes as well. He was the voice of Gobber in the How to Train Your Dragon film franchise (I love those movies). He also voiced Owl in 2011's Winnie the Pooh and he was the voice of Lord Macintosh in the 2012 movie Brave.\n\nCraig is rolling into The Victory Theatre, a venue he's played before, on Thursday, November 9th. Tickets for the show go on sale to the general public this Friday, June 23rd at 10am CST. There's also an Artist Presale that runs Wednesday, June 21st from 10am to 10pm and a Venue Presale which runs Thursday, June 22nd from 10am to 10pm."
