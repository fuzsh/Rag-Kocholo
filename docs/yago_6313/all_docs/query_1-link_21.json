        "text": "EXCLUSIVE: Today show host Kathie Lee Gifford is starring alongside Craig Ferguson (The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson) in Love Me To Death, a feature Gifford wrote and will film next month in Scotland. Adriana Trigiani is on board to direct the pic, which is being produced by Matthew T. Weiner.\n\nIt follows Annabelle (Gifford), a lonely widow who plans a trip around the world, with her husband’s ashes in tow, to visit the places they loved in the movies. When she arrives at the Inn in Loch Lomond, run by a curmudgeonly Scotsman (Ferguson), the first stop on the journey changes her life forever, as a family secret is revealed, one wedding is derailed, another is planned, and two unlikely people get a second chance at love.\n\nThe film will feature original music composed by Grammy-winning producer Brett James with lyrics written by Gifford. George Shinn of Whiskey and Wine Ltd will serve as the film’s executive producer.\n\nGifford is best known as the Emmy winning co-host for the fourth hour of Today and her 15-year run as the co-host of Live! with Regis and Kathie Lee. She’s made a number of film and TV cameos including most recently in Bravo’s Girlfriends’ Guide to Divorce, TVLand’s Younger, and Nashville. In addition, Gifford is a four-time NYT bestselling author and penned the Broadway musical, Scandalous: The Life and Trials of Aimee Semple McPherson.\n\nAfter his tenure at CBS’ The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson, Ferguson hosted the syndicated game show, Celebrity Name Game, in which he was awarded the Emmy for Outstanding Game Show Host two years in a row. On the acting side, he appeared as himself on Sony’s The Ugly Truth and recurred on TVLand’s Hot In Cleveland and Showtime’s Web Therapy.\n\nGifford is repped by Greenberg Traurig, Ferguson is with WME and Gang Tyre Ramer & Brown, and Trigiani is a client of WME and Bloom Hergott, Diemer Rosenthal & LaViolette."
