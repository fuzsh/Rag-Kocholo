        "text": "The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson\n\nMy Great Web page\n\nI think Craig Ferguson is one of the funniest guys. He is one of my favorite guys on TV, and he also is a drummer! His parents are from the same area as my grandparents: Donegal, Ireland & Scotland.\n\nCBS: The Late Late Show\n\nCraig Ferguson began on the Late Late Show on January 3, 2005, and the show set all-time viewer records, achieving the highest ratings since the shows inception in 1995. Born in Glasgow, Scotland, Ferguson was a drummer for a punk bands in the U.K. for several years. Then Craig was a bartender in a local pub in Glasgow.\n\nFerguson later discovered he had a knack for comedy and was soon the star of his own BBC television show, The Ferguson Theory. He came to America in 1995 to star with Betty White and Marie Osmond in the ABC comedy Maybe This Time. After that, ABC added the talented Scotsman to The Drew Carey Show, playing Drew Carey's boss, Nigel Wick, from 1996-2003.\n\nFerguson wrote the feature films The Big Tease and Saving Grace. He made his directorial debut in 2003 with I'll Be There, which he also wrote and starred in. I'll Be There received the Audience Award for Best Film at the Aspen, Dallas and Valencia film festivals. Craig was also named \"best new director\" at the Napa Valley Film Festival. Ferguson's other film credits include, Niagra Motel, Lenny the Wonder Dog, Prendimi l'anima, Life Without Dick, Chain of Fools and Born Romantic.\n\nIn April 2006, Ferguson debuted his first novel entitled Between The Bridge and The River, which became a critically acclaimed bestseller. Since coming into his own on Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson and winning his first Emmy nomination in 2006, Craig achieved a personal milestone in February 2008 when he was sworn in as a US Citizen. Soon after, Craig hosted the White House Correspondents' Dinner, performing before political journalists, celebrities, and Washington power players. In Fall of 2009 Harper Collins is set to publish a memoir by Craig Ferguson American On Purpose - a memoir of living the American dream as he journeys from a small town in Scotland to the entertainment capital of the world. \"American on Purpose reads as if Ferguson had snorted Angela's Ashes,\" says David Hirshey, Senior Vice President and Executive Editor. \"It will make you laugh, cry, and sing The Star Spangled Banner with a Scottish burr.\" Ferguson also serves on the board of the Lollipop Theater Network. The mission of the Lollipop Theater Network is to bring movies that are currently in theatrical release to hospitalized children facing chronic and life threatening illness nationwide.\n\nFerguson lives in Los Angeles with his wife and son.\n\nCraig is also an author and I have been reading his book: American on Purpose"
