        "text": "In choosing James Corden on Monday to replace Craig Ferguson as the host of “The Late Late Show,” CBS seems to be making a statement.\n\nThe statement: Nothing mattered more than finding a standout talent for the 12:35 a.m. show; not the fact that Mr. Corden is a virtual unknown in the United States, nor that CBS has again passed over every female comic in the business to add another man to the long roster of late-night stars. (The current tally: 12 men, zero women.)\n\nCBS made the long-anticipated appointment official after concluding extended talks to secure Mr. Corden, an award-winning actor and comedian whose work is most widely known in his native Britain. (Mr. Corden’s prospective selection was mentioned a month ago on the Hollywood trade website The Wrap.)\n\nMost Americans have probably neither seen nor heard of Mr. Corden, unless they made it to Broadway two seasons ago and caught his Tony Award-winning performance in “One Man, Two Guvnors,” or ran into some episodes of a BBC series he co-created called “Gavin and Stacey,” in which he played a supporting role. He also starred in the cult hit Hulu series “The Wrong Mans.”\n\nBut Mr. Corden, who is 36, is one of the most popular young comics in England, with credits in television, theater and film. He is in the current film “Begin Again” with Keira Knightley and the coming movie “Into the Woods” with Meryl Streep. He has been widely praised as a host of televised events like the Brit Awards, a British pop music award show. He hosts a comedy game show based on sports called “A League of Their Own.” Mr. Corden also sings.\n\n“We looked at many and diverse candidates and he just blew us away,” said Nina Tassler, president of CBS, citing especially Mr. Corden’s range of talents. She said that given the access of the Internet, CBS was able to track his career closely. She also saw him on Broadway.\n\n“James told me he would have swum across the Atlantic and walked across the U.S. barefoot for this opportunity,” she said.\n\nCBS has not yet decided if the show will remain in Los Angeles, Ms. Tassler said.\n\nIn adding Mr. Corden, CBS is keeping a British Isles accent on the show. Mr. Ferguson, who was born in Scotland, won a Peabody Award and built a loyal following over 10 years as host. He announced in April that he was leaving. His last show will air in December. Mr. Corden’s start date has not been determined but will come sometime early in 2015, said Chris Ender, a CBS spokesman.\n\nMr. Corden will be introduced to American viewers while David Letterman is still the host of the network’s 11:35 p.m. show, finishing his 21-year run on the network. CBS has hired Stephen Colbert to succeed Mr. Letterman at a date later in 2015, still to be determined."
