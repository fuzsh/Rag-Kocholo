        "text": "From its humble beginnings—one night, 5 bands at The Kennel Club (now The Independent)—to the present: one week, 160+ bands, 80+ events, 25+ venues—the Noise Pop Music & Arts Festival has become a San Francisco staple.\n\nFeaturing non-stop music from electronic to jazz to good ol’ rock n’ roll, the festival offers an opportunity for everyone and anyone to enjoy the celebration. Complemented by art shows, film scores, talks, happy hours, after hours and more, Noise Pop truly champions independent culture.\n\nJoin us for an unforgettable night of melodies and rhythms at our annual music extravaganza, set against the backdrop of the city's most iconic venue. This event promises to be a harmonious blend of live performances, featuring a diverse lineup of renowned artists and emerging talents from across the globe. Whether you're a fan of rock, pop, jazz, or classical music, our festival offers something for every music enthusiast. Experience the magic of live music as you explore various stages, each offering a unique auditory journey. Alongside the musical performances, enjoy a curated selection of food and beverage vendors, offering local and international delicacies to complement your experience. Mark your calendars and prepare to be part of a celebration that brings together music lovers from all walks of life.\n\nFor one day in San Francisco’s true summer, we showcase the neighborhood in which we live and love: bringing the best of our micro-hood and all of her hidden flavors. With a focus on local, we highlight the small businesses, food, music, and art that inspires 20th Street and beyond.\n\nCarved from a former limestone quarry in the 1960’s, the historic Quarry Amphitheater located at the heart of the UC Santa Cruz campus reopened after a major renovation in October 2017, welcoming its first ever night time concert with LA based rockers Chicano Batman. With a deep history of hosting legendary artists, activists and authors including Angela Davis, Ravi Shankar, Alfred Hitchcock and Cesar Chavez, the Quarry has reopened as a critical gathering space to celebrate live music and community. Referred to as the “Red Rocks in the Redwoods”, The Quarry is the largest outdoor venue with an existing stage and seating in the greater Santa Cruz community.\n\nJoin us for an unforgettable night of melodies and rhythms at our annual music extravaganza, set against the backdrop of the city's most iconic venue.
