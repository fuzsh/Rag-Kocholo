        "text": "From Good Housekeeping\n\nKathie Lee Gifford and Craig Ferguson star in the new romantic comedy Then Came You, available on demand October 2.\n\nThe film follows a traveling lonely widow who meets an innkeeper that changes her life forever.\n\nBoth the former Today show cohost and former late-night talk show host are great friends in real life.\n\nChances are, you've been seeing Kathie Lee Gifford popping up on TV a lot recently. That's because she's promoting her new movie Then Came You, which she costars in alongside former late-night talk show host Craig Ferguson.\n\nWithout giving too much away, Then Came You is about a widow named Annabelle (Kathie's character) who goes around the world with her late husband's ashes visiting all the places they loved from their favorite movies. While in Scotland, she meets Howard (Craig's character), an innkeeper at an estate, and the two form an unshakable — and *possibly* romantic — bond.\n\nWatching the trailer alone, the chemistry between Kathie and Craig is undeniable. But rest assured, the two are nothing more than close friends. Craig has been happily married to his wife, Megan Wallace Cunningham, since 2008. And Kathie, who lost her husband, Frank Gifford, in 2015, told USA Today that there's no news to report in the love department for her.\n\n\"There's nothing to talk about,\" Kathie Lee assured the outlet. \"If there was, I'd shout from the rooftop like Maria in West Side Story. I'd be open to falling in love again. I'd love to. But it hasn't happened.\"\n\nAlas, Craig and Kathie Lee's friendship is certainly a special one. When Jenna Bush Hager asked Craig about working with Kathie Lee on the film, he emphasized how much he admired the former Today cohost.\n\n\"We are great friends ... we kind of have nothing in common except that we adore each other and we're friends,\" Craig gushed on the Today show. \"I can't explain our friendship more than she can. But I think what it is, is if you genuinely adore someone, you just do.\"\n\nThe idea of Then Came You first started when the two were on a lunch date. After Craig filled in for Hoda Kotb on the Today show in 2017, they sat down and talked about the idea of doing a movie together. The next day, Kathie Lee had a script in the works. Just like that, they were off to the races.\n\n\"Literally what I put down on paper was coming to life in real-time with this human being that I want in my life for the rest of my life,\" she told Fox News. \"His wife, Megan, and his family, Scotland. I just want to keep making movies in Scotland with Craig.\"\n\nYou Might Also Like"
