Additionally, Ferguson has three widely acclaimed standup comedy specials: A Wee Bit o’ Revolution which premiered on Comedy Central and was released on Home Video in 2009, Does This Need To Be Said, which premiered on Epix in February 2011 and was released on Home Video in Fall 2011 and I’m Here To Help, which premiered on Netflix in March of 2013 and was nominated for a Grammy for Best Comedy Album.\n\nFerguson has written the feature films The Big Tease and Saving Grace. In 2003 he made his directorial debut with I’ll Be There, which he also wrote and starred in. I’ll Be There went on to receive the Audience Award for Best Film at the Aspen, Dallas and Valencia Film Festivals. Craig was also named “Best New Director” at the Napa Valley Film Festival. Ferguson’s other film credits include Niagara Motel, Prendimi ‘lanima, Life Without Dick, Chain of Fools, Born Romantic and The Big Tease. Craig was in DreamWorks’ animated feature, How To Train Your Dragon, as the Viking, “Gobber”, a role he reprised in the 2014 sequel. In 2011 Craig portrayed “Owl” in the Disney classic, Winnie The Pooh, and also played “Lord Macintosh” in Pixar’s Oscar winning animated feature, Brave.\n\nIn April 2006, Ferguson debuted his first novel, Between the Bridge and the River, which was on the New York Times bestseller list. In 2009, Harper Collins published Ferguson’s memoir, American On Purpose, which debuted at Number Four on the New York Times bestseller list and received a Grammy nomination for Best Spoken Word Album.\n\nPresently he hosts The Late Late Show With Craig Ferguson on CBS.
