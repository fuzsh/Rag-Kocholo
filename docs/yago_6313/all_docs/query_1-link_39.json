Because we rap off each other so well. When we do press together, we have a blast. And when we were in that studio together it was just great. We knew we were on fire.\" CRAIG FERGUSON POSING FOR PHOTO WITH A FAN DIRECTORS TALKING TO MEDIA ACTOR ERIC MCCORMACK WALKING INTO PREMIERE\n\nEmbargoed: 6th April 2010 13:00\n\nKeywords:\n\nLocation: Usa\n\nCountry: USA\n\nReuters ID: LVAW4AENX9L0XNR0C4LVN46UI73\n\nStory Text: Gerard Butler and Craig Ferguson walk the red carpet at the premiere of their new animated 3D film \"How To Train Your Dragon.\"\n\nGerard Butler and Craig Ferguson enjoyed reminiscing about the time they spent working together on \"How To Train Your Dragon\" at the premiere of the new 3D film.\n\nThe Scottish actors are long-time friends. Both say their relationship off-camera helped to create the on-screen chemistry between their characters.\n\nButler plays the voice of a massive Viking leader named Stoick who focuses his strength and energy on keeping his seaside village safe from dragon attacks. And, Ferguson portrays his right hand man, Gobber. After years spent fighting dangerous battles against the huge reptiles, both men learn to look at the fire-breathing beasts in a different light when Stoick's son begins to tame them.\n\nButler said sometimes having too much fun behind-the-scenes can pose a unique challenge.\n\n\"Well, it's hard to get any work done,\" smiled Butler. \"But I think that what was really important was the relationship between myself, Stoick, and him as Gobber. And you couldn't have gotten any better than when we were working together. Because we rap off each other so well. When we do press together, we have a blast. And when we were in that studio together it was just great. We knew we were on fire.\"\n\nThe 40-year-old actor also talked about the other reason he was interested in making the film.\n\n\"I love that, you know, the message behind the story that danger doesn't always lurk in places that you think it does. And sometimes there's a lot of love that lies behind it as well if we just give it a chance. There's a really powerful message in that about tolerance and patience and friendship and also following one's own heart.\"\n\nButler's career was launched into the spotlight with his role as a Spartan king in the 2007 film \"300.\"\n\nFerguson admitted that the main draw for him was that Butler was going to be involved. He also joked about his acting abilities.\n\n\"Part of the reason I wanted to do the movie is because Gerry is in it. And, also we play old friends. And we are old friends, so it kind of very easy. So I got a Scottish accent, and I play an old friend with my old friend. Fine. Because that's the kind of range I've got, isn't it?\"\n\nThe comedian also noted that the closeness between he and Butler helped create an authenticity in the movie.\n\n\"I think it really establishes the intimacy between the two guys, and you get a sense that they have a past together. And I think it really works.\"\n\nFerguson, 47, hosts the Emmy Award-nominated American television program \"The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson.\"\n\nCanadian actor Jay Baruchel plays the misunderstood teenage Viking, Hiccup, who learns that befriending the dragons is better than slaying the fiercesome creatures.\n\nBaruchel talked about what attracted him to the script.\n\n\"Namely the opportunity to make a bunch of kids happy, ideally,\" noted Baruchel, 27. \"And I think back to the movies when I was a little kid, the movies that I liked then, I like more than anything I've ever liked period the rest of my life. And so, to be a part of something that might make that kind of connection with one kid, that's why you become an actor.\"\n\nActress America Ferrera shared shared how portraying a voice character helps actors grow.\n\n\"Well, it's certainly is a challenge to learn how to kind of express just solely through your voice versus all the other tools that you generally have when you're acting. But it was really fun. And after the initial kind of nervousness of 'Oh God. Can I do this?' it just became very like liberating,\" she said.\n\nFerrera, who was born in Los Angeles to parents who immigrated to California from Honduras, earned her fame playing the lead in the television series \"Ugly Betty.\"\n\nThe 25-year-old became the first TV performer to ever win all three major lead actress awards in a single year. In 2007, Ferrera won the Emmy, Golden Globe, and Screen Actors Guild (SAG) awards for her performance as Betty Suarez in the hit comedy.\n\n\"How To Train Your Dragon\" is based on a book by British author Cressida Cowell.\n\nThe film opens across North America on Friday, March 26, 2010.\n\nCopyright Holder: REUTERS\n\nCopyright Notice: (c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2013.
