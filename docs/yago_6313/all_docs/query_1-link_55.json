        "text": "Martin Clunes and his portrayal of eccentric Doc Martin in the ITV comedy drama has transported the fictional village of Portwenn and the beautiful coastal scenery of North Cornwall into the living rooms of viewers all over the world for the past 18 years.\n\nBut delve back a bit further and the seeds of this curmudgeonly, yet strangely lovable, character were actually sown, along with a conservatory full of marijuana plants, in the acclaimed British and US box office hit Saving Grace.\n\nShot in Port Isaac, Boscastle and St Tudy in 1999, it hit cinemas in 2000 with a successful US debut at the Sundance Film Festival in the States and had its “world premiere” at the Regal cinema, Wadebridge, accompanied by a proper feast of pasties, saffron cake and local ale.\n\nREAD MORE: Photos capture the day Arctic snow storm brought Cornwall to a standstill\n\nIt stars the highly-acclaimed Brenda Blethyn as destitute widow and lady of the manor Grace Trevethan whose husband has killed himself and left her with a mountain of debts. The supporting cast featured well-known British actors including Leslie Phillips, Tchéky Karyo (TV’s Baptiste), Bill Bailey and Phyllida Law and seriously talented Cornish rising stars like Tristan Sturrock.\n\nDirected by Nigel Cole, Saving Grace was produced by Cornish actor Mark Crowdy who hails from Trebetherick, near Rock and also co-wrote the script with Craig Ferguson, the Scottish actor who plays the co-lead as Grace’s gardener and partner in crime, Matthew.\n\nWhen the desperate Grace is about to lose her home - the 18th century Grade II listed Wetherham Manor at St Tudy, fictionalised as Lilac House - she swaps her prize-winning orchids for marijuana in the hope that she can grow her way out of trouble with the help of resourceful Matthew and supportive villagers.\n\nMartin Clunes, best known at that time as Gary, one of the idle, beer-guzzling flatmates in Men Behaving Badly alongside Neil Morrissey, was cast as Martin Bamford, a London doctor who had come down to take over the village GP surgery.\n\nSo far, so familiar, but personality wise Bamford was a friendly, smoking, drinking, life and soul of the party who hands out sweets to his patients and gives his full support to Grace’s new horticultural adventures - a million miles away from the straight-laced Martin Ellingham he went on to play in the Doc Martin TV series.\n\nAfter the success of Saving Grace, the Dr Bamford character appeared in two made for TV movies, produced by Martin Clunes’s wife Philippa Braithwaite. Doc Martin in 2001 saw the affable London obstetrician Martin Bamford decamp to the village to clear his head after discovering his wife had been unfaithful to him with all his best friends. Doc Martin and the Legend of the Cloutie followed two years later, with the doctor trying to distance himself from village life by buying a remote farmhouse.\n\nLeaving Bamford floating somewhere in the ether, Dr Ellingham arrived on the small screen in 2004 and has never looked back. But one Doc Martin definitely did morph from the other as acknowledged whenever the Doc Martin credits roll. And it was Saving Grace that set the precedent for the fishing community of Port Isaac becoming a perpetual filming location over the next two decades.\n\nThe tenth and last ever series of Doc Martin will start shooting there this year, after the schedule was delayed because of Covid. Perhaps there could be yet another twist in the tale of the Doc Martin saga… watch this space."
