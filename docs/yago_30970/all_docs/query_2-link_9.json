        "text": "(@)ard.de\n\nGregor Mann\n\nGregor von der Waldenau (born as Mann) was portrayed by actor Andreas Jancke. He made his first appearance on screen on February 16th 2005 and left the show on March 15th 2010.\n\nBackground\n\nGregor's childhood was far from easy. His mother committed suicide when he was young and his father was a gambling addict who was frequently in trouble with the law. The only person he felt he could rely on was his brother, Christian, who later went to prison for a crime their father committed, devastating Gregor.\n\nStorylines\n\nCharming and intelligent, Gregor can have any woman he wants. Gregor arrives in Düsseldorf to visit his old friend Nathalie Käppler (Jenny Winkler) and makes Lars Schneider (Herbert Ulrich) jealous over his relationship with Nathalie. Gregor was also best friends with Ansgar von Lahnstein (Wolfram Grandezka) when he was young. Ansgar finds in Gregor a confident, who he can tell all his worries.\n\nGregor wants to move into a little apartment, but the landlady Elisabeth Brandner (Martina Servatius) wants proof of his income. This is a problem Gregor since nobody knows that he works as a call-boy.\n\nAfter she can't have the man she wants, Sarah Hofmann (Sina-Valeska Jung) begins to have strong feelings for Gregor. In the beginning, Gregor tries not to make a big deal out of his relationship with Sarah, but he eventually falls deeply in love with her. But Sarah still has to deal with her feelings for her half-brother Leonard von Lahnstein (Lars Korten). Leonard and Sarah know that they can never be together and he rushs into a relationship with Jana Brandner (Vanessa Jung). Sarah begins to concentrate on her relationship with Gregor, when his former fiancèe Max comes back to Düsseldorf. She begs for a second chance and Gregor begins to realize that he still has feelings for her. Sarah sees that and breaks up with him. But after a night with Max, Gregor knows who he really loves Sarah Max leaves Düsseldorf again and Sarah gives Gregor a second chance.\n\nBut Sarah is still not over Leonard and can't hold her feelings any longer. Both drive to Paris to say a final goodbye to each other. In Düsseldorf, Adrian Degenhardt (Klaus Zmorek) receives a letter from the late Francesca, Leonard's mother. In this letter, Adrian reads that he is Leonard's biological father. That means that after all, Sarah and Leonard are not related to each other. They come back from their Paris trip and want to start a new life with their partners. Gregor proposes to Sarah and she says \"yes\". But before they are married, Sarah wants to tell Gregor the truth about her trip with Leonard. Gregor forgives her and they get married. Soon afterwards, Jana and Leonard want to get married too. Adrian finally realizes that Leonard needs to know that he is his father, and comes to the wedding. He tells Johannes von Lahnstein (Thomas Gumpert) the truth and he is shocked. Now, Johannes wants to tell Leonard that Sarah and him aren't brother and sister, but he comes too late. Jana and Leonard are already married.\n\nLeonard and Sarah eventually give in to their feelings one night and sleep together. Shortly after, Sarah finds out she is pregnant with Gregor's baby and both her and Leonard realize they can't walk away from their marriages.\n\nSadly, Sarah is seriously injured in a car accident with Jana and loses their baby. Jana has a pulmonary embolism and right before she dies she unites Leonard and Sarah. Gregor leaves Sarah after she tells him about her and Leonard's one-night-stand.\n\nEventually, Gregor even forgives Sarah and the two remain close with each other.\n\nCurrently, Gregor is married to Luise von Waldensteyck (Mascha Müller).\n\nsource wikipedia\n\nscreenshot me\n\nall rights reserved to das erste.de\n\nLuise von Waldensteyck\n\nLuise Letizia Katharina von Waldensteyck was portrayed by actress Mascha Müller. She made her first appearance on screen on January 21st 2009 and left the show in March 2010.\n\nThe character is first mentioned weeks before Luise appears on-screen. In the end of 2008, the production announced that actress Mascha Müller was cast for the role and will be introduced together with the character of Maria Galdi, played by Simone Ritscher. With the press release it was also announced that actor Hubertus Regout would portray Luise's fiancé Eduard von Tepp and that Mascha Müller and Andreas Jancke, who plays the role of Gregor Mann would become the new main couple. With her arrival it is also mentioned that Luise is a distant relative of the Lahnstein Family.\n\nPersonality\n\nLuise von Waldensteyck is a young and beautiful woman, who is described as being very popular because of her aristocratic title as princess. She is also described as \"very loyal and duteously\". A woman that defers her own needs for others. Luise's passion are planes and the flying. Her life as princess is characterized by etiquette and tradition. Mascha Müller said in one of her interview that she rewatched old recordings of Princess Diana to make her role believable and show how a real princess acts in front of the press and in public.\n\nLuise and Gregor\n\nWhen Luise arrives in Düsseldorf she takes care of her father's business. Her father, Wilhelm von Waldensteyck (Michael Tietz), is mentioned to have serious health issues and Luise doesn't know if he will get any better anytime soon. With the worry of her father she tries to stay strong and to not disappoint him. She hides her true feelings and is always smiling in front of the press and the Lahnstein family. Only when she is alone with her private secretary Maria Galdi, she shows parts of her true feelings and about her inner strife. Luise tries to have as much time for herself as she can, but that's difficult in the life of a real princess. When she takes a break from all in a park, she is photographed by some paparazzi when she cries. Luise runs away and finds herself on an unknown place. However, Luise falls and is found by Gregor Mann. He carries her in his arms, when she wakes up and is fascinated by her savior. She welcomes him with a hug and the words \"my prince\", which she later wished she could refused to have said and is embarrassed by it. Luise is excited when she sees that Gregor's hobby are planes and he is about to repair an old one. She sees it as a chance to maybe run away her traditional life for a few hours and help Gregor with his work. Gregor is skeptical, but agrees when Luise shows him that she knows her stuff and can be helpful to him. Even though Luise seems attracted to Gregor from the beginning, they start a work relationship. Luise introduces herself as \"Katharina\" to him - saying nothing about her title or what she is doing besides from their time together. Gregor seems fine with it and doesn't see Luise as a woman he could fall in love with. He rather sees her as a buddy that is working with him. They both can laugh a lot together and Gregor gets a little bit astonished sometimes when Luise doesn't know how to deal with the - for him - easiest things; like making coffee.\n\nCurrently Luise is married to Gregor Mann.\n\nsource wikipedia"
