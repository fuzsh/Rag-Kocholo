Susanne Brandner (Claudia Scarpatetti), the best friend of his mother, decides to take care of him. She adopts Paul together with her husband Alex Wiegand (Frank Behnke). Together with his adoptive sister Lisa (Lilli Hollunder), who was a friend of his before, they become a real family, living in Buenos Aires. But their perfect world falls apart, when Alex keeps sleeping with another woman. Susanne tries to rescue their family and wants to hold on to her marriage. But when her company goes bankrupt, Susanne decides to leave Alex. Against his will, Susanne wants to take the children back to Germany, where her father Arno (Konrad Krauss) lives and she sees the chance to start over. She hides Lisa and Paul at a friend's place, while she flies to Germany and prepares their arrival.\n\nIt doesn't take long and Susanne brings Lisa and Paul to Germany. While Lisa thinks they are only visiting Arno, Paul discovered the one-way tickets and knows that Susanne came to stay. When Lisa finds out the truth, she has a huge fight with Susanne. Paul tries to interfere and reassure Lisa. But she stays mad for a while. On their first night at Arno's house, they meet Susanne's cousins Robin (Nils Brunkhorst), Jana (Vanessa Jung) and Jana's half-sister Nico, who brings Constantin von Lahnstein (Milan Marcus) with her. Lisa immediately begins to fall for him. Paul and Constantin seem to have a good connection as well and the three arrange to meet each other the very next day.
