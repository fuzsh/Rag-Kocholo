        "text": "Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, Ukrainian society has remained in limbo, caught between communism and nationalism, between the former identity of Ukraine as a Soviet socialist republic and its current identity as a formally independent nation state. The conceptualisation of (post-)Soviet Ukraine appears to be an extremely difficult task. Both Ukrainian national space and time belong to several overlapping symbolic geographies and to various transnational, intertwined histories. Accordingly, they are viewed from a great variety of different research perspectives. No wonder the field of contemporary Ukrainian studies is replete with such terminology as ‘contradictions’, ‘paradoxes’, and even ‘schizophrenia’. Obviously, something must be wrong either with Ukraine or with Ukrainian studies."
