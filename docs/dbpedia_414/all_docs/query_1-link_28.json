        "text": "To hear more audio stories from publications like The New York Times, download Audm for iPhone or Android.\n\nIn the final few days of February, as the Russian Army advanced toward Kyiv, Ukrainian forces blew up the Irpin bridge, ripping open its latticed metal insides so that their edges buckled and curled. A suburb of Kyiv, Irpin was the last city that the Russian Army would have had to conquer to reach the capital; the bridge provided the fastest route from the city center to the Kyiv ring road. “It was the main bridge that stopped the invasion of Kyiv,” says Slava Balbek, a Ukrainian architect who is volunteering as a drone operator with territorial defense forces. “It’s like if you cut your arm off so the rest of your body will be saved.”\n\nIrpin was retaken on March 28, one month and a day after the invasion. They retreated north toward Belarus, leaving a trail of devastation in their wake. Their tank tracks still mark the asphalt on the highways. In Irpin, gleaming modern apartment buildings were incinerated; residential homes reduced to rubble; schools shelled, burned and flooded. Destroying the bridge prevented further Russian advances, but it also deprived Ukrainian civilians of their primary escape route, trapping them in the line of fire.\n\nDefense forces collected spare planks and driftwood to quickly fashion an improvised path across the freezing water. Some were killed while making the crossing. Others were hit by artillery fire on their way to the bridge, or as they hurried toward the buses that were waiting for them on the other side. Their deaths are marked by rudimentary wooden crosses fashioned from pieces of debris and driftwood and nailed to the railings. The first cross went up while Russian soldiers were still in Irpin, camped out in school dormitories and residential basements, their tanks parked in apartment courtyards and private driveways. The rest went up quietly, anonymously, once the Russians were gone. Approximately 300 residents died during the occupation; about 200 are still unaccounted for.\n\nMikhail Sapon, the 30-year-old chief municipal architect of Irpin, watched the Russian retreat from his home north of the city. He had been shot on the fourth day of the occupation, when he emerged from the basement where he and his family were hiding to drive to the store for some food and medical supplies. His windshield and the driver’s side of his car were riddled with bullet holes. A week later, his best friend was killed on a similar outing. When Sapon went to take his friend’s body to a cemetery, a Russian checkpoint tried to stop him: “They said: ‘Why is he here?’ ‘Who killed him?’” he recalled. “And we said, ‘You did.’”\n\nOn a recent Friday afternoon, Sapon walked beneath the shattered remains of the Irpin bridge, his hands in his pockets, his gaze toward the river, its bend now rudely exposed to the sky. Behind him, workers cut steel strips for the frame of the new bridge that is under construction, the materials provided by a Turkish company, the cranes, drills and tractors all on loan from Istanbul. A cold rain bore down upon the river, but Sapon did not even hunch his shoulders.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
