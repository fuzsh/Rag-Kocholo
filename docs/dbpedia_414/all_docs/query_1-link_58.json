        "text": "Ukraine, in the wake of its Orange\n\nRevolution, has earned the image of a leading post-Soviet country\n\nregarding the pace of liberal reform. However, this perception of\n\nthe country is to a large extent a kind of payment in advance\n\nrather than a reflection of actual results. Kyiv would not likely\n\nbe in this leading position if one looks at the current integral\n\nindex that draws together the indicators of political\n\ndemocratization and economic reform, both of which are of crucial\n\nsignificance when measuring the rate of the so-called ‘democratic\n\ntransition.’ Moreover, Ukraine is lagging behind some of its\n\nregional neighbors in several aspects of the transformation (see\n\nTable 1). Yet it is rightfully and unambiguously in the lead in\n\nterms of expectations.\n\nOn the one hand, Ukraine still says\n\nthat it is committed to change along the Central European model, a\n\nfactor making it radically different from other former Soviet\n\nrepublics where tendencies toward political and economic\n\ncentralization have prevailed. Ukrainian politics is based on\n\nplurality; elections have turned into an instrument for settling\n\npolitical differences and presidential power is greatly restricted\n\nby the Constitution and parliament.\n\nUnlike in Moscow, the political leaders\n\nin Kyiv have come to a consensus on joining the World Trade\n\nOrganization and launching talks with the European Union on more\n\nextensive free trade. This proves that Ukraine has accepted a\n\nuniversal method of engaging in international economic relations\n\nand feels confident of its own ability. Finally, Ukraine has made a\n\nchoice in favor of full integration into European and\n\nNorth-Atlantic organizations instead of selective cooperation with\n\nthem.\n\nOn the other hand, if one compares\n\nUkraine to other post-Soviet countries with similar types of\n\ndomestic and foreign policy – Moldova and Georgia – it naturally\n\nhas a greater potential for implementing its plans. It has a\n\nrelatively large and developed economy, and since its declaration\n\nof independence Ukraine has managed to avoid ethnic tensions and\n\nhas kept a balance of interests between regions and political\n\ngroups.\n\nHow did Ukraine manage to assume the\n\nrole of the engine of the democratic – and not just\n\nmarket/capitalistic – transformation in the territory of the former\n\nSoviet Union? It seems there were no prerequisites for this at the\n\nstart. The country has a large percentage of ethnic Russians (22\n\npercent in 1989 and about 18 percent in 2001) and a still bigger\n\nshare of the population are Russian speakers, which implies\n\nRussia’s strong political and cultural influence. Like other CIS\n\ncountries, Ukraine’s Soviet-era party and economic elite remained\n\nin power by and large after independence. The initial reforms were\n\nmore than just painful – they were so ineffective that Ukraine\n\nreceived the status of a market economy later than Russia\n\ndid.\n\nA system based on clans and oligarchies\n\ngradually took shape in the country. The authorities mastered\n\nmanipulative technologies to reproduce themselves – an illustrative\n\nexample of this is the 1999 election, in which President Leonid\n\nKuchma was “placed” to run against a Communist contender in the\n\nrunoff, which automatically guaranteed him victory. By 2000,\n\nUkraine had become a country with a governable democracy and\n\nvirtual politics where the ruling elite could only emulate reforms.\n\nThe main thing is that Ukraine did not have very many possibilities\n\nfor becoming a full-fledged member of the EU at that time (and does\n\nnot have any now either), while this very promise served as the\n\nmain stimulus for and a trigger of transformation processes in\n\nCentral European and Baltic countries.\n\nThere must be an answer – albeit an\n\nambiguous and multifold one – to this question of “how.” Some of\n\nits elements are axiomatic and lie at the surface, while others are\n\ntheoretical and obviously disputable. It seems, though, one can\n\nsingle out three main components.\n\nThe first one is the logic of\n\nindependence. There has been a drift away from Russia after it\n\nbecame impossible to build a structure of alternative leadership\n\nwithin the CIS. This has led to an ever-increasing need to accept\n\nWestern norms and rules.\n\nSecond, there is Ukraine’s\n\npolycentrism. If constructs of this kind do not fall apart at once,\n\nthey become flexible and pluralistic. It is against this background\n\nthat the Western Ukrainian region of Halychyna plays a very special\n\nrole and factors like this are not found in any other\n\ncountry.\n\nThird, there was a chain of\n\ncircumstances. This means that Kyiv’s choices could not have been\n\npredicted in 1992, but they can be explained in 2008.\n\nA DRIFT AWAY FROM RUSSIA TOWARD THE\n\nNORTH ATLANTIC CHOICE\n\nThe basic impulse that determined the\n\ncourse of Ukraine’s development was set in many ways by the 1991\n\nreferendum, where nine-tenths of the population voted in favor of a\n\ndivorce from the Soviet Union. For Ukraine, genuine independence\n\ncould only mean independence from Russia and that is why Russia\n\nalmost immediately found itself in the position of the main – if\n\nnot the only – challenger to Ukrainian statehood. Moscow’s\n\nimmediate territorial claims to the Crimea aggravated the\n\nsituation.\n\nThe majority of the then-ruling\n\nUkrainian elite viewed independence as an instrumental and not as\n\nan all-sufficient goal. Those people treasured sovereignty because\n\nof the economic opportunities and power inherent in it, and not\n\nbecause it meant a victory over a foreign or even “occupational”\n\nforce, as the Baltic countries saw it. Yet this factor does not\n\nmatter much since the defense of power and property is no less a\n\nmotivating factor than one’s self-identity or ethnic/religious\n\nincentives.\n\nMoscow and Kyiv were embedded in\n\narguments over the splitting of the Black Sea Fleet and the\n\ndeployment of the Russian part of the fleet in Sevastopol, over\n\nsupplies and payment for natural resources and over humanitarian\n\nproblems. The two countries have still not resolved these\n\nissues.\n\nThe perception of Russia as a\n\nchallenger and of Ukraine’s geo-strategic situation as being highly\n\nvulnerable could not but have prompted a search for interaction\n\nwith Western institutions as a counterweight to Russia’s influence.\n\nThat is why Ukraine signed an agreement on partnership and\n\ncooperation with the European Union already in 1994; it became the\n\nfirst CIS member-nation to join NATO’s Partnership for Peace\n\nprogram in 1995; and it signed a Special Partnership Charter with\n\nthe alliance in 1997. In general, Kyiv was in favor of NATO’s\n\neastward expansion, and this added to the Ukrainian-Russian\n\ndivisions. The logic of building partnership relations with the\n\nNorth-Atlantic Alliance paved the way to signing a number of\n\ndocuments with the goal of Ukraine joining NATO. They were signed\n\nat the time when Leonid Kuchma was president and Victor Yanukovich\n\nwas a first-term prime minister. Ukraine officially requested a\n\nMembership Action Plan for itself in 2008. All of this took place\n\nwhile the very idea of such membership was supported by a very\n\nsmall portion of Ukrainians.\n\nIt is worth noting that the West has\n\nnever initiated a policy of drawing Ukraine into NATO. It is true\n\nthat in the 1990s, the U.S. and NATO espoused Zbigniew Brzezinski’s\n\nidea that Russia would never be an empire again without Ukraine and\n\nthey gave direct or tentative support to Kyiv. But they would\n\nrather consider making Ukraine a buffer zone than including it in\n\nthe Western security zone as such. This purely geopolitical\n\napproach was counterbalanced by a perception of Russia as the\n\nflagship of transition in the region and the realization – to a\n\ncertain extent – that Moscow, with its traditions in state-building\n\nand resources, could take on the responsibility of maintaining\n\nstability and preventing a collapse of post-Soviet countries. All\n\nthe more so that Ukraine, which was reluctant to carry out real\n\nreforms and aroused suspicions that it was supplying weapons to\n\nregimes unfriendly to the U.S. and the EU, caused serious\n\ndisenchantment in the Western ruling milieu.\n\nThe situation changed in 2003 and 2004,\n\nhowever. After a number of East European countries joined the EU\n\nand its borders reached Ukraine, Brussels was forced to consider\n\nways of stabilizing its new frontier. Simultaneously, Russia made\n\nan unambiguous claim to revise the status quo and launched a\n\ntougher and more conflict-oriented policy toward Ukraine. As a\n\nresult, the West’s policy toward Ukraine became complicated and\n\nmultifaceted and offered more flexible responses to the calls\n\ncoming from Kyiv. Still, the EU’s reaction did not go beyond the\n\nformat of the so-called European ‘neighborhood policy.’ Its very\n\nname speaks of its anti-integration essence, and yet it would not\n\nbe correct to ignore the potential for a rapprochement embedded in\n\nit.\n\nInteraction with the EU and the U.S.\n\nwas not the only resource that Ukraine tried to make instrumental\n\nin its search to counteract Moscow’s influence. It conscientiously\n\nsought the position of leader in the territory of the former Soviet\n\nUnion. In 1992-1994, Ukraine procrastinated with a renunciation of\n\nnuclear weapons, although its inability to maintain the status of a\n\nnuclear power and the fact that this scenario was unacceptable for\n\nthe West was obvious. The same reason was behind its willingness to\n\ntake the reins of power in GUAM – an association of countries\n\nhaving serious problems with Russia.\n\nBut as betting on the alternative\n\nleadership in the CIS became more and more of an illusion and the\n\nplans for regional integration in Central Europe turned out to be\n\nunworkable after Ukraine’s western neighbors joined the EU and\n\nNATO, Ukraine had no other options than the limited cooperation\n\noffered by the West.\n\nAt the same time, NATO’s own experience\n\nshows that a rapprochement stimulated by geopolitical factors and\n\ntaken per se does not imply a democratic change. EU membership is a\n\ndifferent story in this sense. It looks like Ukrainian society and\n\nthe political class shifted their accent to the “European choice”\n\nat the beginning of this decade. This shift envisions acceptance of\n\nreforms along European standards.\n\nPolls taken over many years by\n\nUkraine’s Razumkov Center for Economic and Political Research show\n\nthat since 2002 more Ukrainians are in favor of the country joining\n\nthe EU. In the fall of 2002, when the EU was preparing its final\n\ndecision on incorporating Ukraine’s neighbors, the positive\n\nattitude toward a United Europe hit 65 percent.\n\nIt is also true, however, that\n\nUkrainians have been much more critical of the European Union in\n\nthe past few years. In the first place due to the EU’s reluctance\n\nto respond to Kyiv’s aspirations to become integrated in Europe.\n\nStill, the majority of respondents younger than 59 years old – and\n\nespecially those younger than 39 years – answer with assuredness\n\nthat they personally, and the country as a whole, stand to gain\n\nfrom EU membership. The huge changes in neighboring countries and\n\nthe millions of Ukrainians who have left the country to find jobs\n\nin the West have furnished Ukrainians with the invaluable\n\nexperience of assessing the advantages of the European model. The\n\nprocess did take some time, but most Ukrainians acknowledge the\n\nbenefits of integration today, and the national debate on this\n\nproblem has evolved toward a realization that reforms should be\n\nviewed as an internal necessity and not as a ticket for admission\n\nto Europe.\n\nIt is still an open question whether\n\nMoscow could prevent or at least slow down the drift of its\n\nsouthern neighbor. Theoretically such a possibility existed – for\n\ninstance, as part of the concept “To Europe with Russia!” which\n\nKyiv put forth at the beginning of this decade – but in reality\n\nthis option was scarcely possible. Moscow failed to accept the\n\nprinciple of equality and its policies boiled down to bribery and\n\nforceful pressure. Nor did it find ways to attract partners for\n\ncooperation without sinking into full-scale subsidizing, which the\n\npartners used quite skillfully – and which Belarus is still doing\n\nto this day.\n\nA transition to genuine interstate\n\nrelations between Russia and Ukraine began only after the Orange\n\nRevolution in Kyiv. Moscow had to admit that the opportunities for\n\ncoexistence with Ukraine in a single economic and political space\n\nand with Moscow retaining its role of the leader have been\n\nexhausted, while Kyiv had to recognize that reforms require a\n\nrenunciation of privileges in the field of energy\n\nresources.\n\nUNITED IN DIVERSITY\n\nThe main trait of Ukraine’s internal\n\nstructure is polycentrism. Not a single center of power found in\n\nthat country is capable of monopolizing all the power and resources\n\nor even holding the top position for a long time. Political\n\nplurality matches this type of structure best of all. This\n\nstructure has not been stable, as centers of power have alternately\n\nappeared and disappeared, or at times they become stronger or\n\nweaker.\n\nThe competition between the centers of\n\npower is more pronounced in the regional factor. Russia has\n\ntraditionally spoken of a contention between the so-called\n\nLeft-Bank Ukraine and Right-Bank Ukraine – a reference to the banks\n\nof the Dnieper River. Yet the current breakdown of electoral\n\npreferences actually reflects a division between the “historical”\n\nand “newly populated” (i.e., populated after the 18th century)\n\nparts of the country. Although the full picture is far more\n\ncomplicated, this does not change its essence.\n\nRegional leaders are not seeking a\n\nbreach of the state – they put the emphasis on coming to power in\n\nthe center and proliferating their influence through the capital\n\ncity and the central agencies of power. To achieve this, even the\n\nstrongest ones need allies and the skills to make arrangements with\n\nothers. Attempts to preside over all others rather than being the\n\nfirst among equals soon lead to a political defeat – as the\n\nrepresentatives of the largest – Donetsk-based – regional group\n\ncould perfectly see in 2004 and 2007.\n\nIn addition, conflicts between regions\n\nand regional elites have an element that plays a unique role in\n\nsettling the question of the European choice – the Halychyna\n\n[Eastern Galicia – Ed.] factor or, in a broader sense, all of\n\nWestern Ukraine as a political phenomenon.\n\nHalychyna is smaller and weaker than\n\nEastern Ukraine, but it has an advantage – a homogeneous vision of\n\nthe world and a cohesive self-identity. For Western Ukrainians, the\n\ncountry’s independence is a value in its own right and the return\n\nto Europe is as natural as for the Poles, Estonians, Latvians and\n\nLithuanians, since the western parts of what is now Ukraine were\n\nincorporated in Soviet/Russian imperial territory only in\n\n1939-1945. By contrast, Eastern Ukrainian leaders view independence\n\nas an instrumental thing. They are unable to create a new ideology\n\nfor the new state or to explain to their Russian-speaking voters\n\ntheir own choice for existence outside of the Russian state, and\n\nthis compels them to rely on the political leaders from the western\n\nregions in that sphere. While the “Halychyans” can configure their\n\nnation state with the European choice, Eastern leaders are unable\n\nto combine their country’s independence and its integration with\n\nRussia (a logical end to that option would be subordination, if not\n\nterritorial incorporation) and hence they have to call on their\n\nproponents to exercise an amorphous “cooperation” and\n\n”rapprochement” with Moscow.\n\nThere is ample observation to\n\nillustrate the homogeneity and consistency of Western Ukrainian\n\npoliticians. Some Eastern Ukrainian leaders have joined the\n\ncountry’s Western power-wielding quarters on quite a number of\n\noccasions after 2004. The last person in that resounding sequence\n\nwas Raisa Bogatyryova, a key figure in the Regions party, who\n\nagreed to take the post of Secretary of the National Security\n\nCouncil in President Victor Yushchenko’s administration. There are\n\npractically no instances of a reverse West-to-East movement. One\n\ncan hardly imagine, for example, that Borys Tarasyuk, leader of the\n\nPeople’s Movement of Ukraine, or Rukh, would accept the post of\n\nSecurity Council Secretary in the administration of a President\n\nVictor Yanukovich.\n\nWestern Ukraine is thus winning the\n\nideological competition step by step. Suffice it to recall\n\npresidential elections where the candidates would be associated\n\neither with the “Western” or “Eastern” set of values.\n\nThe nationalist daydreamer and Rukh\n\nleader Vyacheslav Chornovil received only 23 percent of the votes\n\nin December 1991 in a contest with Soviet-era party bureaucrat\n\nLeonid Kravchuk who received 62 percent. The latter got only 45\n\npercent of the votes in a runoff election in 1994 as he tried to\n\nlean on slogans close to the hearts of Western Ukrainian voters. He\n\nlost to Leonid Kuchma – a representative of the Eastern regions who\n\npromised among other things to make Russian an official language –\n\nand got 52 percent of votes. Since Kuchma reneged on his electoral\n\npromises, he could not run as a representative of Eastern Ukraine\n\nin the 1999 election and the campaign took place under the slogan\n\nof “preventing a Communist relapse.” In the repeat runoff in 2004,\n\nVictor Yushchenko, who was viewed as an advocate of the nationalist\n\ndemocratic ideology, got 52 percent against the 44 percent taken by\n\nPrime Minister Victor Yanukovich, a native of Donetsk [the cradle\n\nof the Eastern political elite – Ed.] whom Leonid Kuchma had chosen\n\nas his successor.\n\nSince the divisions among regions are\n\ngetting narrower, it cannot be ruled out that this election was the\n\nlast one in which the issues of language, culture and foreign\n\npolicy will play a significant role. One could predict that the\n\n2009 election will focus on social and economic issues and have\n\nstricter requirements for the personalities of the\n\ncandidates.\n\nThe nature of Ukraine’s oligarchic\n\nsystem was directly linked to the mutual positioning of different\n\ngeographic and administrative regions – and not so much along the\n\nWest-East line. Business empires not only embedded themselves in\n\nthe country’s polycentric construction, they magnified this\n\npolycentricity. Financial and industrial groups based in Donetsk,\n\nMariupol, Dnipropetrovsk, Kharkiv, Zaporizhia and Kyiv have\n\nincessantly looked for models of coexistence that would match the\n\npresent-day reality. No guarantees of their mutual loyalty – and\n\nall the more so subordination – have ever existed. It is well known\n\nthat some of the clans gave feeble support to the seemingly common\n\ncandidate Victor Yanukovich. They feared that he would facilitate a\n\nsteep rise of his own group.\n\nOn the other hand, big business, which\n\nfrom time to time overtly sponges on the government, has never been\n\nstrong enough to subjugate it. The clans did recognize Leonid\n\nKuchma’s role as an arbiter in the fighting within their own ranks,\n\nbut his personal closeness to the Dnipropetrovsk group (his\n\nson-in-law, Victor Pinchuk, is one of the richest people in\n\nUkraine) made it difficult to draw a line of division between the\n\npresidential and business aspects of his activity. Still, the\n\nfinancial and industrial groups proved strong enough to survive\n\nafter the Orange Revolution, although protests against oligarchies\n\nwere one of its driving forces. The repartitioning of property\n\nended with a re-privatization of the Krivorizhstal steel mill,\n\nwhich international steel major Mittal Steel bought from\n\nbusinessmen close to Kuchma.\n\nA possible explanation for this\n\nsituation is that the interests of Ukraine’s big business and\n\nreformist authorities overlap today. Unlike in the mid-1990s,\n\nUkrainians can make huge fortunes now in areas other than the\n\nselling of Russian natural gas. Liberation from “oil and gas\n\naddiction” pushes businesses to search for new markets and\n\ninternational legitimization of their revenues, while a gradual\n\nslimming of Russian energy subsidies makes them think of a\n\ntransition to civilized rules of conducting business and\n\nmodernization programs at large. It was not accidental that Victor\n\nPinchuk became a major lobbyist for Ukraine’s pro-European choice\n\non the international scene.\n\nFinally, systemic rivalry between the\n\npresident and parliament also played a role in the rise of\n\nUkrainian polycentrism. The head of state has never had an\n\nopportunity to resort to forcible policies since the very\n\ndeclaration of independence, however dismal the repute of various\n\nsessions of Ukraine’s parliament – the Verkhovna Rada – might have\n\nbeen.\n\nAgainst this background, the positions\n\nof the president have been gradually weakening. The 1995\n\nConstitutional Agreement gave the president more powers than the\n\n1996 Constitution. Kuchma’s attempt in 2000 to beef up presidential\n\npower by introducing constitutional changes through a referendum\n\nfailed. The referendum did take place, but the authorities did not\n\nfind any legal mechanisms for enforcing its results, which once\n\nagain exposed the weakness of the head of state. Next came\n\nconstitutional amendments adopted during the Orange Revolution.\n\nThey made the cabinet of ministers unaccountable to the president\n\nand turned Ukraine into a mixed parliamentary/presidential\n\nrepublic. A new redistribution of authorized powers may take place\n\nin the next few years, but full subordination of executive power to\n\nthe office of president has been simply ruled out, and this feature\n\nobjectively brings Ukraine closer to the Central European models of\n\nstate governance.\n\nTHE POWER OF CIRCUMSTANCE\n\nThe aforesaid external and internal\n\npolitical environment may not have been enough for choosing and\n\nmaintaining Ukraine’s democratic course had it not been for an\n\nentire chain of events and circumstances, which were mostly\n\naccidental (although lovers of conspiracy theories will likely\n\ndisagree with this). Let us mention a few of them.\n\nIn the first place, there was the 1994\n\nelection. What matters here is the fact that Leonid Kravchuk agreed\n\nto an early election. As a result, state power went over to the\n\nopposition – a factor that was critical for the country’s future\n\ndevelopments. Even more important was the fact that the losers\n\nstayed in the political arena. In spite of the scale of the\n\nstandoff, Kravchuk returned to national politics and eventually\n\nemerged as a leader of the pro-Kuchma forces in 2002–2004. Thus a\n\ntradition of tolerance to opposition was created, opportunities for\n\ncooperation between former adversaries emerged, and the\n\ntotalitarian principle “the winner takes all” was\n\ndumped.\n\nPressure was exerted on former Prime\n\nMinister Pavlo Lazarenko, Yulia Tymoshenko (who was closely linked\n\nwith him in the mid-1990s) and on businesses affiliated with them,\n\nbut this was more the exception than the rule. Yet those two people\n\nhad an opportunity to take part in the 1999 election, with\n\nTymoshenko eventually taking the post of a deputy prime minister in\n\nVictor Yushchenko’s cabinet. Thus political differences did not\n\nbecome synonymous with personal animosities, and this laid the\n\nfoundation for a flexible and steady political system.\n\nIt is worthwhile in this context to say\n\na few words about Leonid Kuchma’s personality – a most ambiguous\n\none that still awaits a biographer to explore it. During the Orange\n\nRevolution most Ukrainians passed negative judgments on his stay in\n\npower and rejected his successor. Yet it is important that several\n\nof his decisions – whether taken by instinct or upon scrutiny –\n\nwere in line with the country’s general ideological and political\n\nevolution and did not contradict it.\n\nFirst, Kuchma learned to speak\n\nUkrainian and used the language in public, thus reasserting his\n\nwillingness to be a president of an entire Ukraine and not just one\n\npart of it. This was a profoundly symbolic precedent that compelled\n\nVictor Yanukovich to do the same.\n\nSecond, Kuchma refused to use\n\nforce to suppress political protests. He took this line during the\n\nescalation of tensions in the Crimea in 1994 and 1995. The\n\npeninsula reverted to Ukraine’s legislative realm through\n\nagreements.\n\nThird, Kuchma had enough\n\nresolve to publish a book called Ukraine Is Not Russia that said\n\nthe divergence between the two countries is unavoidable. He did it\n\nin spite of his frequently stated eagerness to bridge positions\n\nwith Moscow and to pursue a multifaceted foreign policy.\n\nFourth, Kuchma did much to\n\nstreamline Ukraine’s relations with the West. In 2002, when his\n\nreputation in the West had already collapsed, he went as far as to\n\nsuffer personal humiliation as he took part in a conference of the\n\nEuro-Atlantic Partnership Council in Prague to confirm the\n\nsincerity of his country’s Euro-Atlantic choice. The participating\n\nheads of state and government were then purposefully seated\n\naccording to the French alphabet, not the English one, so that the\n\nU.S. president and the British prime minister would sit at a\n\nspecific distance from the Ukrainian president.\n\nLast but not least, Kuchma\n\ndispelled fears when he resigned as required by law.\n\nThe next critical episode after the\n\n1994 election came in 2001 when Major Mykola Melnychenko, a former\n\npresidential bodyguard, published his audio recordings. Although\n\nthe outburst of oppositionist activity it produced subsided quickly\n\nenough, the ‘cassette scandal’ changed the context of Ukrainian\n\npolitics. People started looking at the Kuchma regime as not simply\n\nimmoral, but as criminal. Public opinion interpreted those\n\nrecordings as proof of Kuchma’s involvement in the assassination of\n\nopposition journalist Heorhiy Gongadze – even though the details of\n\nthe crime, which had a serious impact on Ukraine’s development, are\n\nstill not clear to this date.\n\nThe scandal had specific political\n\nrepercussions. As rightfully noticed by Ukrainian political\n\nscientist Mykhailo Pohrebinsky, then liberal Prime Minister Victor\n\nYushchenko, the West’s enfant cheri, lost his chance of becoming\n\nKuchma’s successor. Pohrebinsky says that the campaign demanding\n\nKuchma’s resignation made sense only for as long as the power could\n\ngo over to the prime minister, who was popular with the opposition.\n\nAs Kuchma rescued himself, he had to fire Yushchenko.\n\nThe dismissal of Yushchenko, a person\n\nwho was completely loyal to the president, provided the opposition\n\nwith a leader and a banner at the same time. It also forced Kuchma\n\nto lean more on the oligarchs, shift the balance of forces toward\n\nthe Donetsk clan, and seek ways of rapprochement with Moscow. But\n\nmost Ukrainians and their political leaders did not support either\n\nof these steps.\n\nThe West, on its part, paid more\n\nattention to developments in Ukraine in general and to the 2002\n\nparliamentary election in particular. Since Kuchma did not really\n\nwant a fight with the West – it would produce greater dependence on\n\nRussia eventually – he did not use his administrative resources in\n\nthat election very actively. As a result, the election propelled to\n\nparliament the radically anti-Communist Yulia Tymoshenko Bloc (7.3\n\npercent of the votes on the party ticket). Tymoshenko thus obtained\n\nimmunity and access to the public rostrum. Yushchenko’s Our Ukraine\n\nparty received 23.6 percent – even more than the Communists did,\n\nand became the tentative winner in the election. This circumstance\n\nmade regional bureaucracies disorganized and they lost confidence\n\nin the ruling party’s ability to keep the situation under control.\n\nThe political process was no longer “successfully\n\ngovernable.”\n\nThe road to the Orange Revolution was\n\nopen now. Its outcome was logical and the causes of the events in\n\nthe fall of 2004 have been described in great detail. However,\n\ngiven the polarization of electoral preferences and the approximate\n\nparity of forces at the start of the campaign, Yanukovich’s victory\n\nwas not altogether impossible. Two factors eventually seem to have\n\ntipped the scales in Yushchenko’s favor:\n\nThe attempt to poison him in September\n\n2004 that evidently gave him the people’s sympathy and made\n\nbehind-the-scenes arrangements impossible for him\n\npersonally;\n\nRussia’s interference in the election\n\ncampaign on Yanukovich’s behalf.\n\nThe latter factor caused an\n\nunparalleled protest, above all in Kyiv, where a new generation of\n\nRussian-speaking proponents of Ukrainian statehood had matured by\n\nthat time.\n\nWHAT’S NEXT?\n\nUkraine’s democratic transition may\n\nhave been reversible before the Orange Revolution, but that is\n\nhardly possible now considering the events in the years after it\n\nconsolidated the nation’s choice.\n\nFirst, Ukraine will continue\n\nits step-by-step integration into Europe, both economically and\n\npolitically. Ukraine’s “European choice” will remain the core of\n\nthe country’s foreign policy. A breakthrough may be possible by the\n\nintroduction of broader free trade between Ukraine and the EU –\n\nalthough this will not take place earlier than 2012 or 2014 – and a\n\nmajor liberalization of travel restrictions may come in its wake.\n\nUkraine’s self-adjustment in the European system of energy security\n\nwill continue. Ukraine will co-host the European Football\n\nChampionship in 2012 along with Poland and this will give a boost\n\nto Ukraine’s infrastructure, raise the level of its compatibility\n\nwith Europe and, most importantly, will help the country foster the\n\nimage that it is an inalienable part of Europe.\n\nAll of that will not furnish Kyiv with\n\nsufficient grounds for making guaranteed claims to a full-fledged\n\nintegration in the EU and relevant influence inside it, yet it\n\ncould open up the prospects for a Norwegian style of integration,\n\nsuggesting incorporation in the European economic space combined\n\nwith NATO membership. It looks like Ukraine would be quite happy\n\nwith this.\n\nSecond, the country will not\n\ndiscard political plurality and the democratic electoral system.\n\nAfter three successive opposition victories in the elections of\n\n2004, 2006 and 2007 the situation apparently pleases all political\n\nforces, as it leaves them a chance to regain power.\n\nThird, external conditions,\n\nincluding a growth in prices for energy resources, will continue to\n\ndictate the need for economic reforms.\n\nDevelopments in Ukraine pose a serious\n\nchallenge for Russia, since the historical paths of the two\n\ncountries are diverting. While previously the case in hand was\n\nconfusion and the sorting of economic issues between political\n\nleaders, today one can speak of a growing misunderstanding between\n\nthe two societies which still speak one language and have similar\n\ncustoms, but have different values and view their future\n\ndifferently.\n\nCurrently, this challenge is confined\n\nto sporadic outbursts – compensation for devalued Soviet-era bank\n\ndeposits, paying child benefits that exceed those paid in Russia by\n\nseveral hundred percent, and an upcoming military reform that will\n\nabolish mandatory military service – that are easy to cushion off.\n\nBut if the reforms facilitate Ukraine’s transition to European\n\nsocial policies in general and, correspondingly, improve people’s\n\nlives, the challenge will take on a systemic character. As people\n\nin both countries continue to keep close contacts, contrasting the\n\ntwo “verticals of state power” and “electoral democracies” will be\n\ninescapable. This factor may appear more crucial than the now\n\nhypothetical shifting of the borders of the Euro-Atlantic zone\n\ntoward Ukraine’s eastern frontiers.\n\nIt does not pay to make far-reaching\n\nforecasts though. The rate of Ukraine’s further transformation may\n\nbe too slow and it is too early to judge its overall success. It is\n\nunclear where the limit of the Ukrainian economy’s adaptation to\n\nnew prices for gas lies. Polycentrism may degenerate into endless\n\nblocking among political forces and a desire to untangle all the\n\nknots through elections may breed populism. A liberal political\n\nsystem does not guarantee efficient governance, while systemic\n\ncorruption can reduce the reformers’ efforts to naught. Also, it is\n\nequally unclear now if the EU can offer Kyiv a policy that will\n\ncorrespond to the progress of reforms."
