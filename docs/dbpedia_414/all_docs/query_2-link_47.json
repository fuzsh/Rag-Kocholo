President Clinton has led international efforts to promote the independence, sovereignty and prosperity of the NIS, secure within their borders and at peace with their neighbors. To address the nuclear threat, President Clinton has successfully curbed the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and reduced the dangerous legacy of Cold War weapon stockpiles. United States support has enabled the NIS leaders to undertake economic reform, adopt new constitutions providing for the rule of law and advance their integration with the West. Due to President Clinton's effort, the NIS have achieved significant progress towards democracy, free market and regional stability.\n\nA RECORD OF ACCOMPLISHMENT\n\nDismantling Nuclear Weapons\n\nPersuaded Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan to return former Soviet nuclear weapons to Russia and to forswear nuclear weapons forever. Belarus achieved nuclear weapon-free status in November 1996, Kazakhstan in April 1995 and Ukraine in June 1996.\n\nProvided $1.865 billion since 1992 to the Cooperative Threat Reduction (CTR) Program to help the NIS transport and destroy nuclear weapons and build national systems to safeguard weapons-usable fissile material. Approximately 5,000 nuclear warheads have been deactivated and over 1,100 long-range missile launchers and bombers have been dismantled.\n\nRatified the START I agreement 1994, which will eliminate or transfer back to Russia from Ukraine 46 bombers and 176 launchers carrying over 1,500 nuclear warheads. START I has eliminated 7 bombers and 104 launchers in Kazakhstan carrying over 1,040 warheads. START I will transfer back to Russia from Belarus 76 launchers carrying 76 warheads.\n\nStopping the Spread of Nuclear Weapons from the NIS\n\nEnlisted Ukraine in the global nonproliferation effort, supporting its accession to the Missile Technology Control Regime in July 1998 and securing its accession to the Non-Proliferation Treaty as a non-nuclear weapon state in December 1994.\n\nObtained Ukraine's commitment to cease collaboration with the Government of Iran on the Bushehr nuclear power project.\n\nAirlifted nearly 600 kilograms of highly enriched uranium in Operation Sapphire - enough for dozens of bombs - from Kazakhstan for safe disposition in the United States.\n\nProvided training in export control, border security and counter-proliferation to over 2,500 Customs and Border Guard personnel from the NIS to counter smuggling of weapons of mass destruction, their components and technologies, enhancing their detection and interdiction capabilities.\n\nPromoting Regional Peace, Security and Cooperation\n\nBrokered agreements that withdrew Russian troops from Lithuania (1993), Latvia (1994) and Estonia (1994) and resettled 2,500 Russian officers out of the Baltic States. The Clinton Administration also supported decommissioning of two Soviet nuclear submarine training reactors in Paldiski, Estonia and the demolition of Soviet missile radar facility in Skrunda, Latvia.\n\nBrokered the NATO-Ukraine Charter, signed on July 9, 1997, which creates a strategic partnership between NATO and Ukraine, enhancing democratic values and promoting stability in Eastern Europe.\n\nHelped Ukraine integrate into Western security systems. With U.S. financial support, Ukraine is an important partner in peacekeeping in Bosnia and KFOR. The United States improved the interoperability with NATO of the Ukrainian-Polish peacekeeping battalion through training and equipment, enhancing its ability to serve in SFOR since 1996.\n\nSupported the sovereignty and independence of Ukraine and other NIS, as reiterated by President Clinton during his June 5, 2000 Summit with Ukrainian President Kuchma in Kiev.\n\nFacilitated Russia's removal of its border guards from Georgia. In concluding the adapted Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty, the United States brokered agreements between Russia, Georgia and Moldova reducing Russian troops in Georgia and closing two of four Russian bases in Georgia in 2001, and removing all Russian troops and equipment from Moldova by the end of 2002. For Moldova, the Administration helped secure a Russian pledge to delink troop withdrawals from the political settlement of the Transnistrian separatist problem.\n\nLed efforts, together with our allies, to strengthen requirements in the Conventional Forces in Europe Adaptation Agreement for host nation consent to the presence of foreign forces, including notifications to all parties as to whether such consent has been granted. This addresses a key security concern of a number of states, including Ukraine, Moldova, Georgia and Azerbaijan.\n\nHelped to achieve a cease-fire in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict in May 1994, ending six years of violence between Armenians and Azeris.\n\nWorked with three Central Asian states (Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan) to create, train and conduct exercises with CENTRASBAT battalions to support international peacekeeping efforts.\n\nBrokered a multi-year water sharing agreement for the Syr Darya River Basin - a major tributary feeding the Aral Sea - signed in 1998 by the Prime Ministers of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan and facilitated through United States support and technical assistance.\n\nSigned a Memorandum of Understanding, together with our G-7 partners, which led Ukraine to close the Chornobyl Nuclear Power Plant on December 15, 2000. The United States and other G-7 partners, working with international financial institutions, also helped mobilize over $2 billion in energy sector lending and provided more than $1 billion in assistance to facilitate Chornobyl closure and improve nuclear safety in Ukraine. The July 1997 Chornobyl Shelter Project pledging conference, which was chaired by Vice President Gore and Ukrainian President Kuchma, secured $360 million for the construction of a new Chornobyl sarcophagus. A second pledging conference, chaired by Germany in spring 2000, brought total pledges to over $700 million.\n\nSupporting Democratic Reform\n\nProvided timely assistance for Ukraine's parliamentary and presidential elections in 1994, 1998 and 1999, which established the principles of democracy and choice in Ukraine's nascent political system.

Today, 75% of people in the NIS live under democratically- elected governments.\n\nSpearheaded OSCE efforts to encourage the Government of Belarus to introduce democratic reforms and implement the rule of law. Promoted international consensus within OSCE on not sending observers to the October parliamentary elections if the government in Minsk did not take the necessary steps to make these elections free and fair -- which they did not.\n\nSupported more than 71,000 NIS citizens to travel to the United States on United States Government-funded academic and professional exchange programs since 1993. These programs target current and next generation leaders from public and private sectors and encourage support for of democracy, market ideas and foreign investment after their trip.\n\nPromoted democratic transition in the NIS through judicial reform programs and by supporting programs on voter information and political party and NGO development.

Encouraged the Government of Ukraine to move forward with much-needed energy sector reform.\n\nCreated private sector growth in Ukraine and Moldova through the Western NIS Enterprise Fund, a venture capital fund established in 1994 and capitalized with $150 million by the U.S. Agency for International Development, by investing in companies that support central and local governments with their taxes. The Central Asia American Enterprise Fund, established in 1994 and operating in all five Central Asian republics, has invested more than $65 million in 35 companies.\n\nAgreed with Ukraine to implement an action plan to suspend the operations of compact disk pirating facilities and to enforce intellectual property rights.\n\nBased on Ukraine's solid progress on nonproliferation commitments, agreed with Ukraine to lift its Space Launch Quota, creating the basis for stronger bilateral commercial ties.\n\nHelped Moldova develop a model land reform program to privatize farmland through U.S. assistance. Already over 100,000 land titles have been issued to Moldovan farmers.\n\nProvided technical assistance to Georgia, Armenia and Kyrgyzstan for accession in the WTO.
