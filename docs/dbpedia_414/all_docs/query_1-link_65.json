        "text": "Ukraine, which marked its thirtieth anniversary of independence in 2021, cannot be described as a stable, consolidated democracy. But the country demonstrates dynamism in making active moves backward and forward in its democratic development. Even during the year, there were both achievements and pitfalls in Ukraine’s core areas of democratic transit. For example, the adoption of laws and strategies respecting civil society, ethnic minorities, and human rights was accompanied by the imposition of sanctions on a record number of Ukrainian citizens, businesses, and media. Such unusual measures were initiated by the National Security and Defense Council (NSDC), which, in performing its consultative and coordination functions, gained more influence over interior affairs in 2021.\n\nIn September, a new law on countering oligarchs was hastily passed by the Verkhovna Rada, Ukraine’s unicameral parliament. Meanwhile, the opposition and civil society experts were critical of initiatives empowering the president and the NSDC in procedures for identifying said oligarchs. In response to his apparent wariness of the legislation, Rada Chairmen Dmytro Razumkov, who had previously opposed some sanctions as an NSDC member, thus putting his role as parliamentary speaker before party affiliation, was formally removed from his leadership role by the ruling Servant of the People majority in October.\n\nRazmukov’s removal was a stark example of concerning trends in Ukrainian national governance: first, the desire of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to control the parliament and have a loyal speaker willing to turn on the legislative “turbo-mode” if needed, as in 2019; second, the perception of opposition and critical voices within the president’s own team as potentially harmful and not above punishment for disloyalty. These trends could be seen in the government’s reshuffling of 10 ministerial positions during the year. Similar personnel policy was applied to regions, where the highest officials—heads of regional state administrations—could be easily dismissed by the president for lack of loyalty or for poor results from Servant of the People candidates in the 2020 local elections. Impacted by the pandemic lockdowns and the decline of public support in regions, 14 heads among the 25 regional administrations were removed since the previous local elections, while 7 more were appointed in 2021.\n\nZelenskyy’s fight with oligarchs, which began in February with sanctions and the May arrest of People’s Deputy Viktor Medvedchuk, continued in the form of a public confrontation with Rinat Akhmetov, the wealthiest person in Ukraine. In the fall, Akhmetov-owned media outlets were critical of the ruling party, and on November 26, the president alleged Akhmetov’s participation in plotting a December coup d’état that failed to materialize. The prosecutor general announced plans to launch numerous investigations, including against former president Poroshenko, who was accused in late December of treason and financing terrorism.\n\n“Deoligarchization” efforts led to changes in Ukraine’s media landscape: outlets affiliated with Medvedchuk were sanctioned, and Poroshenko and Ihor Kolomoisky formally transferred ownership of their TV channels; meanwhile, the public broadcasters disclosed instances of government pressure and attempts at reorganization, and owners of private media like Bukvy and Kyiv Post fired entire editorial offices. However, the journalistic community remained committed to providing critical yet accurate reporting on domestic events.\n\nThe Pandora Papers—revelatory files obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) and published in early October—claimed that President Zelenskyy and his partners, including the president’s adviser Serhiy Shefir and Security Service leader Ivan Bakanov, had established a network of offshore companies in 2012. After publishing the leaks, the National Agency for Prevention of Corruption (NAPC) began examining financial declarations by Zelenskyy and Bakanov, and NAPC Chairman Oleksandr Novikov stated that the agency would take into account the information published in the Pandora Papers. Zelenskyy claimed that there was nothing new to be found out from the Pandora Papers as reported by the Ukrainian investigative journalists of Slidstvo.info, and he denied that companies had been used for money laundering. Yet it was hard for the president to deny the uncomfortable fact that former owners of his off-shored companies had received high-level posts in his administration. Dismissing the “Offshore 95” investigation, Zelenskyy commented, “To be honest, the story is not good enough.”\n\nAnother scandal, “Wagnergate,” brought to light in mid-November by Bellingcat investigative journalists, involved special operations of the Main Intelligence Directorate and the delivery of dozens of mercenaries from the paramilitary group Wagner PMC into the country. Featuring accusations of misusing state residence and emergency-service helicopters for private purposes, these investigations negatively affected the positive image of Zelenskyy and his administrative chief Andriy Yermak, and led to mass protests demanding their resignations in early December. While support for Zelenskyy and his Servant of the People party had significantly declined since the triumphal elections of 2019—by 17 and 11 percent, respectively, as of December 20 —their popularity nevertheless remained the highest among Ukraine’s political forces.\n\nDecentralization, which showed positive results in 2021, still needs to be completed through the decomposition of authorities on regional and sub-regional levels. In March, new draft constitutional amendments on local state administrations were approved in the parliament, and then numerous public consultations and regional discussions were held with the broad involvement of stakeholders, the expert community, and local activists. Similar broad consultations were held to discuss laws on national or local referendums, youth policy, and transitional justice, as well as the creation of a strategy to promote civil society development and action plans for human rights and Roma minorities, with the wide-ranging engagement of think tanks and activists. This legal framework, newly adopted or significantly revised in 2021, promises to empower civil society with public funds and instruments of direct and deliberative democracy.\n\nEconomic decline and healthcare issues related to the COVID-19 pandemic forced the digitalization of public services and e-democracy development at the central and local levels. In July, marketing of agricultural land through the e-auctions platform ProZorro, thereby delivering services to decentralized communities, was a long-awaited step. The tax amnesty begun in September, however, was a much disputed move that may legalize as much as $20 billion in shadow capital and raise an additional $1 billion. Critics argue that such measures could negatively affect established anticorruption policies, foster money laundering, and discourage law-abiding taxpayers. Economic fallout from the pandemic hastened Ukraine’s need for supplementary IMF loans and dependence on foreign macro-financial assistance, which were granted on the grounds of intensifying reforms, specifically in the areas of justice and anticorruption. As a result, the Rada backed legislation to relaunch changes in the judiciary that would engage foreign professionals in selecting members to Ukraine’s judicial self-governance bodies. In the fall, this process of cleansing was sabotaged by the Council of Judges and the Supreme and Constitutional Courts, which led to the increasing standoff between the executive and judicial branches. On November 2, the Ethics Council of the High Council of Justice was finally established after months of stalled nominations. The Ethics Council will consist of three international experts and three Ukrainian judges, and represents an important step in the Judicial Reform Strategy approved by Zelenskyy in June; it is also required by the Law on the Reform of the High Council of Justice passed by the parliament in July.\n\nIn 2021, Ukraine still suffered from the ongoing violent conflict in its eastern regions and threats of Russian aggression, which claimed 3 to 5.9 percent of GDP in military expenditures according to different assessments. The consequences of the conflict—reflected in more than 1.4 million internally displaced persons (IDPs) and 400,000 veterans —are a tremendous burden on the country’s humanitarian and socioeconomic policies. Meanwhile, progress was made during the year towards a strategic vision for the reintegration of Crimea; economic development of Donbas, which has suffered from the conflict; and drafting the transitional justice and legal status of Crimean nationalities. The launch of the “Crimean Platform” diplomatic initiative with an inaugural summit in Kyiv on August 23 gathered representatives of 47 countries and organizations, providing a positive message of international support for Ukrainian territorial integrity.\n\nThe European Union (EU)–Ukrainian Summit, held on October 12, confirmed progress in the normative harmonization and growing mutual economic ties of the Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area (DCFTA) and the positive effect of decentralization. The Treaty on Open Skies for civic aviation was signed to unite Ukrainian and European airspace, and the EU’s Horizon Europe and Creative Europe programs were prolonged for Ukraine for another cycle. While support for EU and NATO integration remains high in Ukrainian society, it decreased somewhat during the year despite mounting threats of a military invasion by Russia in late December. The current government is committed to the geopolitical orientation set in 2014, while also attempting to apply these aspirations in practical terms, on the ground, through financial and military assistance from allies, participation in the Digital Single Market and joint programs funded by the EU, export expansion, and diplomatic support.\n\nUkrainians face many challenges, but they continue to demonstrate enthusiasm for civic engagement and their commitment to a democratic future: in a 2021 poll, 76 percent admitted that it is important to them that Ukraine become a fully functioning democracy, with equal justice for all and human rights protection. That sentiment is high in every region of the country and has been stable over time, which shows that the democratic transition of Ukraine may be debated in the particulars but not as a general ambition."
