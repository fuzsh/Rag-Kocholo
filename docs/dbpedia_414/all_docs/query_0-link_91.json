        "text": "Introduction\n\nThe Alma-Ata conference in 1978 placed primary health care high on the international agenda as a means of strengthening health systems, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (WHO, 2008). This chapter examines key aspects of primary health care in the countries of the former Soviet Union, including settings and models of care, patient choice and gatekeeping, and accessibility. It begins by giving a brief historical overview of how primary care evolved in the Soviet Union.\n\nHistorical background\n\nThe primary health care model inherited in 1991 by the newly independent former Soviet countries was based on the centrally planned and hierarchically organized Semashko system. In rural areas, primary care services were provided at rural health clinics and feldsher–midwife points (FAPs), while in urban areas they were provided at polyclinics. Indeed, primary health care was one of the strengths of the early Soviet health system, enabling the great majority of the population, in both cities and rural areas, to gain access to basic health services. However, after the Second World War, health policy increasingly focused on secondary and tertiary care, leading to a neglect of primary care and rural areas. Referral systems, financial flows and the physical infrastructure all favoured large urban hospitals and secondary care (Borowitz et al., 1999).\n\nAnother challenge was that the gatekeeping function of primary health care was not properly established and patients could easily self-refer to many specialists (Holm-Hansen, 2009). Apart from this, however, there was little choice; patients were allocated to a health professional and had little say in their treatment (World Bank, 2005a). Parallel health systems for employees of certain ministries and large state companies exacerbated inefficiencies (see Chapter 3). Primary care was further fragmented by the existence of vertical disease management programmes and there were often separate facilities for adults, women (for reproductive health services) and children.\n\nThere was no specific training for primary care specialists, so that terapevt (primary care internist) or pediatr (primary care paediatrician) were physicians working in primary care but without relevant advanced medical education. The state achieved comprehensive primary care coverage in rural areas through the obligatory placement (raspredelenie) of new graduates in posts throughout the country, giving them little or no choice as to where in the Soviet Union they would be practising. Although not trained in general practice or family medicine, these physicians were de facto working as family doctors. In urban areas the situation was quite the opposite: partly because there were no financial incentives for primary care physicians to treat patients, and partly because of population preferences, conditions that would elsewhere be treated at the primary level were referred straight to specialists in polyclinics or hospitals (Rechel et al., 2013). Because primary care tasks were frequently provided by specialists in different polyclinics, primary care physicians were often no more than ‘dispatchers’ in the system. They were poorly paid, had limited access to equipment or medicines and had very little say over organizational aspects of the health system. Under these circumstances, it was almost impossible for primary care to be either comprehensive or continuous (Langenbrunner, Cashin & O’Dougherty, 2009).\n\nReform trajectories\n\nAfter the break-up of the Soviet Union, the newly independent states endeavoured without exception to strengthen their primary care sectors ( ). The nature and extent of these reforms, however, has varied between countries. All the states have been struggling to increase cost–effectiveness and improve outcomes but with mixed results (Boerma et al., 2012).\n\nTable 7.1\n\nIntroduction of general practice/family medicine and the current status of reform.\n\nStrengthening primary health care has also been a firmly established policy goal for international institutions working in the former Soviet countries, including WHO and the World Bank, but also bilateral agencies such as the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). These international organizations have promoted a model of primary health care delivery based on the specialties of general practice or family medicine. This approach (referred to as the ‘family medicine model’ throughout this chapter) seeks to increase the role of first-access ambulatory care, providing the majority of health services for all patients and acting as a gatekeeper to secondary and tertiary care. The overall aim is to reduce utilization of hospital and specialist services, increase the technical efficiency of health systems, provide better access to the population and improve the equity of health service provision (Atun, 2004).\n\nThese goals have been embraced by all 12 countries, acknowledging that the establishment of good-quality primary care should be a priority for reform and spending (Smith & Nguyen, 2013). While this has not always translated into the realities of budget allocations, where secondary and tertiary care providers have greater lobbying powers, and where hospitals still receive the lion’s share of the health budget (Kulzhanov & Rechel, 2007; Belli, 2003), most former Soviet governments have been slowly introducing policies to shift health systems towards the family medicine model (Rechel & McKee, 2009).\n\nAs this chapter will demonstrate, this transition has not been completed in any of these 12 countries, and has been a slow process everywhere. This hesitant pace of reforms reflects the political, economic and social challenges that accompany the fundamental restructuring of health systems. Currently, family medicine is more common in rural areas where patients are geographically bound to their primary care providers and cannot easily self-refer to specialists. In many former Soviet countries elements of family medicine have been introduced in pilot regions (Rechel et al., 2013), such as the Chuvash region in the Russian Federation (Popovich et al., 2011). Two notable exceptions to this very partial implementation of family medicine are the Republic of Moldova and Kyrgyzstan (World Bank, 2005b; Ibraimova et al., 2011; Rechel et al., 2013), where Soviet primary care facilities have been fully transformed into family medicine centres and the gatekeeping function of primary care is operational. The Armenian government was one of the first in the former Soviet Union to introduce family medicine but it is still not fully implemented. This incremental approach to reforms in most countries of the region has resulted in primary care provision that is often characterized by an uneasy and ill-functioning alliance between elements of the Semashko system and reformed approaches in line with family medicine ( ).\n\nCurrent settings and models of primary care\n\nSince gaining independence in 1991, the foundation structures for the provision of primary care have not changed substantially in Azerbaijan, Belarus, Kazakhstan, the Russian Federation and Turkmenistan, where the structure of primary care is still largely based on the old Semashko system. In Georgia, Kyrgyzstan, the Republic of Moldova, Tajikistan, Ukraine and Uzbekistan far-reaching reforms to the general settings and models of primary care have been initiated.\n\nIn most countries, the most basic facilities and the first point of contact for remote rural areas are feldsher-midwife points (FAPs), which are usually staffed by at least a nurse, a midwife and a feldsher (physician’s assistant) who, unlike a nurse, is able to prescribe medication for certain conditions, especially when there is no doctor available. The activities of FAPs are usually supervised by a physician working in the nearest physician-staffed facility (Ibrahimov et al., 2010). Across the former Soviet republics that have retained them, feldshers often also carry out home visits. The Republic of Moldova is one of the countries where FAPs no longer exist. The lowest level of primary health care there is the health office, staffed by a nurse trained in family medicine and serving a population of up to 900 people. Similarly, in Tajikistan health houses now serve as the first point of contact in rural areas, covering areas with a catchment population of up to 1500 people, while in Uzbekistan rural physician points serve the same function.\n\nSolo practices have been introduced as part of the move towards family medicine and are a more common model of care in Armenia, Georgia, Kyrgyzstan and the Republic of Moldova, although in all countries except the Republic of Moldova old and new models coexist side by side. In Georgia, for example, old primary care centres offer consultations, home visits, some essential medicines, rapid laboratory tests and referral to contracted specialists, while new health centres, funded by international donors, employ GPs and offer a broader range of services (Chanturidze et al., 2009). Kyrgyzstan also runs a mixed model, whereby some GPs now operate as individual legal entities (Ibraimova et al., 2011). In the Republic of Moldova solo practices are not common but are sometimes run as subdivisions of family medicine centres and health centres, which have replaced the FAP (in rural areas) and polyclinic model (in urban areas) that is still dominant in many other post-Soviet countries (Turcanu et al., 2012). In the Russian Federation, Belarus and Ukraine solo family medicine practices are found predominantly in rural areas. In Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan there are no licensed solo practices offering primary care.\n\nBeyond FAPs or family medicine practices, the next largest facilities serving the rural population are outpatient departments, for example rural physician clinics or small village hospitals in Azerbaijan, health houses in Tajikistan and primary care centres in Ukraine. They are typically staffed by physicians – often a combination of primary care internists (terapevty), paediatricians, nurses and midwives. In some cases these facilities are staffed by other specialists, such as surgeons, dentists (Katsaga et al., 2012) or gynaecologists and obstetricians (Popovich et al., 2011). Occasionally, the terapevty may have been replaced by retrained GPs (Popovich et al., 2011). Small village hospitals, for example in Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan, are similarly staffed but also provide a few inpatient beds (Mamedkuliev, Shevkun & Hajioff, 2000; Ibrahimov et al., 2010). As part of the push for the family medicine model, family group practices have been introduced in Armenia and Kyrgyzstan and piloted in Ukraine and Azerbaijan. However, the distinction between these and other rural outpatient facilities is often not clear. Group practices in Kyrgyzstan, for example, were created on the basis of the Soviet-era FAPs, rural doctor ambulatories, polyclinics and rural district hospitals, and are today staffed by a similar mix of health workers as other outpatient centres, that is at least one physician, in addition to nurses and midwives. These group practices were established as separate business affiliates under a legal entity called family medicine centre (Langenbrunner, Cashin & O’Dougherty, 2009) and serve groups of villages with a population of 2000 people or more. In Ukraine in 2013, family doctors served between 900 and 2600 people in rural areas and between 800 and 2300 in urban areas (Ministry of Health, 2014).\n\nFor conditions that cannot be treated by providers of primary health care in rural areas, patients travel to polyclinics, which are usually located in larger towns or cities. Polyclinics serve as the first point of access for the urban population. Whilst many have been refurbished or renovated, their underlying operating principles have remained largely unchanged since Soviet times. Polyclinics are large organizations, in which primary care physicians work jointly with a range of narrow specialists representing approximately 10–20 specialties, supported by diagnostic and laboratory services. In most cases, patients are first seen by a primary care internist (terapevt) and then referred on to a specialist within the same polyclinic. Patients living in the polyclinic’s catchment area are assigned to a terapevt, who serves approximately 1800–2000 patients (Ibrahimov et al., 2010). In four countries the polyclinic system has seen substantial changes: it has been gradually replaced by polyclinic–ambulatory unions or hospital– polyclinic unions in Georgia, by family medicine centres in Kyrgyzstan (Ibraimova et al., 2011) and Ukraine, and by family health centres in the Republic of Moldova (Turcanu et al., 2012). In Azerbaijan, Belarus, Kazakhstan and the Russian Federation some urban polyclinics are still separated into care provision for women or children, as during the Soviet period. Elsewhere these services have been merged under one roof. The Republic of Moldova is the only country in which the whole system of primary care providers has been completely transformed in both rural and urban areas, with health points in small communities, family doctor’s offices, health centres and family medicine centres replacing the old infrastructure of FAPs, outpatient clinics and polyclinics.\n\nProvision of services\n\nFAPs often have only rudimentary equipment and provide first aid, antenatal and postnatal care, basic disease prevention activities, such as immunization and health education, and simple medical procedures, such as injections and wound dressing (Ibrahimov et al., 2010; Ibraimova et al., 2011; Popovich et al., 2011). In Belarus FAPs are also part of the state-owned pharmacy network at district level and are thus able to dispense medical supplies to the community (Richardson et al., 2008). Physicians working in rural clinics offer primary care services for most common conditions, as well as antenatal and postnatal care. Village hospitals also provide obstetric care and some laboratory services, although many of those have been closed down or converted to outpatient clinics.\n\nRural facilities tend to lack staff and be chronically under-funded. In response, the system of raspredelenie has been reintroduced in Belarus in 2008 (Richardson, 2013) and in Kyrgyzstan, creating problems of continuity, when young doctors leave as soon as they are able to do so, and reinforcing the impression that primary care does not offer high quality services. This system of allocating physicians to rural areas has been abolished in all other countries, but many have introduced incentives such as bonus payments to attract and retain health workers to rural areas (see Chapter 5).\n\nUrban polyclinics usually provide access to a number of specialties, typically cardiology, rheumatology, oncology, ophthalmology, otolaryngology and obstetrics/gynaecology, as well as a full range of diagnostic and laboratory services (Ibrahimov et al., 2010; Popovich et al., 2011).\n\nPrimary care staff have always been involved in disease prevention and health promotion activities, such as immunization, screening for sexually transmitted diseases and monitoring of schoolchildren (see Chapter 6). However, in a few countries, such as Kazakhstan, family doctors are now more involved in public health activities (Boerma et al., 2011). Since the introduction of the family medicine model, FAP staff in Kyrgyzstan have been assigned a much larger remit for health promotion activities, involving the local community and NGOs (Ibraimova et al., 2011). In Belarus, too, the workload of primary care physicians has expanded significantly over the last few years, as they coordinate annual routine check-ups for the whole adult population, with a special emphasis on those of working age (Rusovich & Richardson, 2009). At the primary care level in all twelve countries there are large gaps in the risk factor management for non-communicable diseases. This includes general medical advice on issues related to alcohol, diet, tobacco and exercise (Smith & Nguyen, 2013).\n\nChoice in primary care\n\nAn ideological rejection of the past led politicians to promote choice as a value in its own right following the collapse of the Soviet Union. As of 2014, all post-Soviet states have formally introduced a right to choose primary care physicians, and some had also introduced choice of specialists ( ).\n\nTable 7.2\n\nChoice of primary care physicians and specialists.\n\nChanges have also taken place in the registration of patients, which is no longer universal in all post-Soviet countries. In those countries that still have a system of registration with primary care physicians, most are covered by terapevty rather than GPs.\n\nIn the field, however, policy and practice rarely fully coincide. Patients are still often assigned to ambulatory care facilities in their area of residence and therefore have very little choice. Although the introduction of a right to choose has been one of the cornerstones of primary care reform in all post-Soviet countries, this is only meaningful if there is excess capacity, which is not the case in many places. Especially in rural areas choice is constrained by the sheer lack of providers, while in urban areas patients have been slow to exercise their right of choice, in part because little information is available on which to base such choices. As a result, the formal right of choice has not made a substantive impact on primary care.\n\nGatekeeping and referral\n\nDuring the later years of the Soviet Union, patients were registered with the terapevty in whose catchment area they lived but they could also queue to make an appointment with a specialist at the polyclinic without referral (Moore & Busing, 1992). In their primary health care reforms, most post-Soviet countries have formally acknowledged the importance of primary care as a gatekeeper for higher levels of care. Yet, the implementation of gatekeeping has been held back by a shortage of general physicians, a lack of incentives to seek or provide services within primary care and the Semashko-era habit of patients bypassing primary care altogether. Often, patients do not trust the expertise of generalists (Richardson et al., 2008) or resist their choice being restricted (Rusovich & Richardson, 2009). Nowadays it is only in rural areas that patients habitually first address primary care, mainly due to geographical proximity rather than post-Semashko gatekeeping policies.\n\nIn four countries (Kazakhstan, the Russian Federation, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan), gatekeeping has not been formalized within health policy ( ). Although the system of gatekeeping is not legally binding in the Russian Federation, the majority of patients in rural and urban areas first seek care from the GPs or internist with whom they are registered because, for historical reasons, they often assume referrals to be necessary (Popovich et al., 2011). In Kazakhstan, too, although no gatekeeping policy has been formally introduced, patients generally visit first their GP (89%) or terapevt (77%) with new health problems, before they seek specialist care (Boerma et al., 2011). In Ukraine, gatekeeping has been introduced in the country’s pilot regions, with certain exemptions, such as paediatric, obstetric or dental care.\n\nTable 7.3\n\nGatekeeping and referral functions of primary care.\n\nYet, as in the Soviet period, patients often prefer to consult a specialist directly without referral from their primary care physician, even if this involves formal or informal payments. This practice has been reported in several countries that have formally introduced gatekeeping, namely Armenia (Richardson, 2013), Azerbaijan (Ibrahimov et al., 2010), Georgia (Chanturidze et al., 2009) and Turkmenistan (Rechel, Sikorskaya & McKee, 2009). Self-referral has seriously weakened the gatekeeping function of primary care, leading to significant overuse of specialist and inpatient care. Self-referrals have been reported even in Kyrgyzstan (Ibraimova et al., 2011) and the Republic of Moldova, although both have been regarded as models for the transition to a family medicine based system (World Bank, 2005b; Boerma et al., 2012). In the Republic of Moldova, for example, patients can self-refer for specific diseases or if they take on the full financial burden of specialist care (Turcanu et al., 2012).\n\nVertical coordination and integration between primary and higher levels of care are highly problematic in post-Soviet countries. Patient records and discharge summaries are often not shared between health-care providers and follow-up of patients treated in secondary or tertiary care is often provided at the discretion of these institutions. Primary care physicians are rarely obliged to followup patients receiving care elsewhere in the system.\n\nThe need for a referral to access secondary care is an official requirement – but not necessarily practised – in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Turkmenistan, as well as in pilot regions in Tajikistan.\n\nIn contrast, the use of referral mechanisms is financially incentivized in Georgia and the Republic of Moldova, where insured patients are covered for secondary and tertiary care when referred by a primary care physician but have to bear the full costs of care if they self-refer. In Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia health care is mainly funded OOP so patients have few incentives to pay twice (first a primary care doctor to obtain a referral, as well as a specialist; see Chapter 4).\n\nPatients also perceive the quality of primary care to be low (Chanturidze et al., 2009). Indeed, the main source of resistance to the gatekeeping and referral system that form the backbone of the family medicine model has come from patients themselves. While the lack of trust in generalist physicians is particularly well documented in Belarus (Richardson et al., 2008; WHO Regional Office for Europe, 2008), across all former Soviet countries the persistence of self-referrals to specialists and secondary care is testimony to the low prestige of general practitioners or primary care internists (Rechel et al., 2013) and the fact that patients are not prepared to relinquish the right to seek care from whomever they deem most appropriate. Another source of resistance are specialist physicians, such as paediatricians and gynaecologists, who have been opposed to gatekeeping and referral reforms because they fear a decline in the importance of their profession and also because they are concerned that patients will not receive care of high enough quality from generalists (Holm-Hansen, 2009). With the exception of the Republic of Moldova and Kyrgyzstan, gatekeeping and referral reforms have only been fully implemented in rural areas, such as in Azerbaijan and Belarus (Richardson et al., 2008; Ibrahimov et al., 2010), where merely by dint of geographical proximity patients first seek care from primary care facilities.\n\nLegal status and payment of primary care providers\n\nIn contrast to most of Eastern Europe, primary care in the former Soviet Union is mainly still provided in public practices and most primary care providers are salaried. Georgia is exceptional in providing private outpatient care (Smith & Nguyen, 2013). In Azerbaijan, Belarus, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan primary care workers are employed by the state, which sets salary scales and makes all budgetary decisions. This has remained largely unchanged since the Soviet period (Rechel et al., 2013). In Armenia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, the Republic of Moldova and the Russian Federation primary care providers have been moved from the integrated model (in which health workers are salaried state employees) to the contracting model. Purchasers, such as mandatory health insurance funds (Kyrgyzstan, the Republic of Moldova and the Russian Federation) or state health care agencies (Armenia, Georgia and Kazakhstan) pay providers according to predetermined payment mechanisms, such as capitation or fee-for-service (see Chapter 4 and ). However, private OOP payments (both formal and informal) also play a substantial role in many countries of the region, so neither the integrated or the contracting model really capture the full picture of how health services are purchased (see Chapter 4).\n\nTable 7.4\n\nLegal status and payment mechanisms for primary care providers.\n\nHealth facilities have gained increasing autonomy in those countries that have moved towards the contracting model, where they are independent budget holders, as in Georgia (Chanturidze et al., 2009), or state economic enterprises, as in Kazakhstan (Katsaga et al., 2012) and Ukraine, which has made primary care facilities legally autonomous. Often, this has changed the employment structure of health workers. While in the Republic of Moldova the district and municipal administrations employ health workers, in Armenia, primary care physicians are employees of state-owned joint stock companies (Hakobyan et al., 2006).\n\nThe split between purchaser and provider in these countries (Armenia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, the Republic of Moldova, the Russian Federation and, partly, Ukraine) was intended, among many other aims, to create incentives for health professionals to provide better quality care and to retain patients at the primary care level unless otherwise clinically indicated. Yet, as discussed above, patients who self-refer and bear the cost of specialist treatment illustrate that financing and legal reforms alone have not been sufficient to change the health-seeking behaviours of patients.\n\nAccess to primary care\n\nThe post-Soviet countries inherited an extensive network of health facilities from the Semashko system, including FAPs in rural areas (see Chapter 5). This brought health care, in line with the aspiration formulated at the Alma Ata conference, close to where people lived and worked. Today, geographical access to primary care varies considerably across the region with particular problems in rural areas. In most countries, geographical access in urban areas has generally not been as problematic, as polyclinics have on the whole not been closed down – often despite severe overcapacity in urban areas. As in Soviet times, some population groups (such as employees of certain government ministries) are still granted access to parallel health systems, although these are slowly being wound down in most countries.\n\nIn some countries the general population has retained good geographical access to primary care in both urban and rural areas because health facilities are evenly distributed, facilitated by rigorous targets for geographical coverage. This is the case, for instance, in Belarus, the Republic of Moldova, Tajikistan and Ukraine. Other countries have moved away from the broad geographical coverage achieved in the Semashko era and now struggle to provide for the rural population although this is also in large parts due to the challenging geography of some countries (including deserts and mountainous terrains) and the failure to attract health workers to rural areas. In Georgia, the primary care network has functionally disintegrated following heavy budget cuts and decentralization in the mid-1990s.\n\nIn addition to geographical barriers in accessing primary care services in some countries, financial barriers have emerged in the form of both formal and informal OOP payments since the collapse of the Soviet Union (see Chapter 4). Although this is predominantly a challenge for hospital services (see Chapter 8), payments for pharmaceuticals (with outpatient pharmaceuticals usually excluded from basic benefit packages) have become a major obstacle to access in primary health care (Balabanova et al., 2012).\n\nQuality of primary care\n\nA number of challenges have emerged that create difficulties in ensuring the quality of primary care in the post-Soviet countries, including outdated infrastructure and equipment, lack of health workers in rural areas and underdeveloped mechanisms for quality assurance (Rechel et al., 2011). One of the main concerns across the region is the poor management of cardiovascular risk factors in primary care. Surveys have shown that only a very low percentage (less than 10% in many post-Soviet countries) of those with high blood pressure take the necessary medication regularly (Roberts et al., 2012) and treatment rates for those with high levels of cholesterol are even lower (Smith & Nguyen, 2013).\n\nA legacy of the late Soviet period, which emphasized inpatient care and technological solutions, is that primary care facilities were relatively neglected. Only since the end of the Soviet Union have efforts been made to improve primary care and refurbish the physical premises in which it is provided. Despite major progress in many countries, there is still some way to go and there continue to be major gaps between urban and rural areas. A possible exception is Belarus, following the Ministry of Health’s large investments in rural health care. In Ukraine in 2013, 29% of primary care clinics in rural areas and 50% in urban areas were found to be in need of major repairs (Ministry of Health, 2014). In Azerbaijan, many urban polyclinics have been rehabilitated or newly built, while rural facilities have been neglected and their infrastructure is lagging behind; one study found that only 8% of all primary care facilities in rural areas had a piped water supply and almost no facility had a mains sewerage system (Ibrahimov et al., 2010). In Georgia, too, facilities in rural areas have been shown to lack modern equipment (Chanturidze et al., 2009). In Kazakhstan, in 2009, only 35% of rural medical posts complied with national standards for equipment and supplies in primary care (Katsaga et al., 2012). In 2000, many rural primary care facilities in Turkmenistan did not have running water, toilets or fire exits (Mamedkuliev, Shevkun & Hajioff, 2000). In some countries, such as Armenia, Georgia and the Republic of Moldova, donor agencies such as USAID and the World Bank have provided financial assistance to rehabilitate or build facilities, which has significantly improved the situation, especially in Armenia (Richardson, 2013; Chanturidze et al., 2009).\n\nOutdated equipment and a poor supply of pharmaceuticals are additional challenges. In Kazakhstan, until recently, some rural facilities were not supplied with pharmaceuticals (Katsaga et al., 2012). In Armenia, Georgia and Tajikistan facilities lacked more than two-thirds of basic laboratory services and essential equipment for the management of common noncommunicable diseases (Smith & Nguyen, 2013).\n\nOne of the biggest problems in some countries is the inappropriate staffing of primary care facilities in rural areas. There is a severe shortage of physicians, mainly due to the challenges of rural life but also because of a lack of opportunities for professional development (Ibrahimov et al., 2010). In Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan these challenges are exacerbated by large-scale outmigration of health workers leading to critical brain drain.\n\nThere are fewer accountability mechanisms in primary care of the former Soviet Union than in Eastern Europe (Smith & Nguyen, 2013). In the former Soviet countries, only very few national policies have sought, explicitly, to improve the quality of primary care. In Azerbaijan only polyclinics and primary care facilities in Baku and other major cities have seen rehabilitation and re-equipment (Ibrahimov et al., 2010). Belarus, Kyrgyzstan, the Republic of Moldova, Tajikistan and Ukraine embarked on more systematic attempts at improving primary care facilities but sometimes these were mainly directed at renovating facilities rather than improving clinical practice. In Belarus, the Programme for the Revival and Development of Rural Areas aimed to improve the condition of ambulatory care, which was much enhanced (Richardson et al., 2008). In Kyrgyzstan a quality assurance programme monitors indicators such as patient satisfaction; the Moldovan government has introduced a validation scheme for primary health services, whereby a share of the cost is only reimbursed if they meet certain predetermined criteria (Turcanu et al., 2012), and similarly in Ukraine an accreditation system has been introduced for all facilities (Lekhan, Rudiy & Richardson, 2010), although effective implementation remains a challenge in both countries. In Georgia, health-care standards and quality assessment are absent, and weak regulatory systems make it difficult to measure or ensure quality of care (Chanturidze et al., 2009). However, with a renewed emphasis on regulatory oversight, this may now be changing.\n\nConclusions\n\nThe remaining gaps in access to high quality primary care in many former Soviet countries are in part a reflection of the fact that monetary support for primary care has been lagging behind rhetoric. However, many (particularly in central Asia) are low-income countries and their poor infrastructure is an indication of a general lack of resources and not unique to primary care. That primary care has been constrained by a lack of resources has, however, aggravated the lack of trust that populations are willing to bestow on it, particularly when secondary and tertiary care facilities are in better physical condition, better equipped and better staffed. The rural population suffers disproportionately from this situation and physicians, feldshers and nurses often act as de facto generalist staff, even when they are not fully trained to do so. While recognizing the magnitude of reforms in primary health care over the last two decades, on the whole, primary care facilities in the former Soviet countries are not yet in a position to take on the bulk of health services, as would be necessary for the full implementation of the family medicine model.\n\nThere are a number of steps that would need to be taken to achieve this goal. In addition to the appropriate allocation of resources for human resources and equipment, as well as investments in the training of staff (see Chapter 5), these will include revised payment allocation mechanisms (see Chapter 4), improved quality of care through the development and implementation of clinical practice guidelines and the enforcement of quality assurance mechanisms (see Chapters 3 and 11), more clearly delineated levels of care, and improved gatekeeping and referral mechanisms."
