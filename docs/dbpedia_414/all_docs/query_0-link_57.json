This article reflects upon the experience of Ukraine in its attempts to reform the police, and argues that it is more a story of continuity than change, with pre-independence structures, cultures and power elites predominating. It suggests that political and ideological ambiguity has led to uncertainty about how the police should be reformed from one previously focused on serving the state and ‘collective’ interests to one meeting the needs of the individual and local communities. The article begins by highlighting some of the key reforms that have been undertaken by the Ukrainian police in the years since independence, and then goes on to detail the significant factors that have impeded this process. It concludes by reflecting upon future priorities and the prospects for developing a more democratic policing model in Ukraine.",

        "text": "4It will be interesting to observe how the recent election of the so called reforming President Viktor Yushchenko will impact upon the police reform agenda in Ukraine, and whether he has the political will to take on the entrenched power elites within the Ministry of Interior, and bring about more widespread change within the militia.\n\n5This article begins by highlighting some of the key reforms that have been undertaken by the Ukrainian Militia in the years since independence, and then goes on to detail the significant factors that have impeded this process. It concludes by reflecting upon future priorities and the prospects for developing a more democratic policing model in Ukraine.\n\nMilitia Reform\n\n6Prior to formal independence, a new law governing the work of the militia was passed by the Parliament of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic in December 1990. Article 1 of this law outlined the main role of the militia as being: ‘… the state armed body of executive authority that protects the life, health, rights and liberties of citizens, the property, environment and interests of society and the state from illegal encroachments upon them’. The Act publicly stated the key activities and responsibilities of the militia, which included: the maintenance of public order; carrying out preliminary investigations and holding inquests on cases within its jurisdiction; crime prevention; the protection of individual, collective and state property; administration of gun permits; the managing of special facilities for homeless people and isolation wards for infected offenders; the administration of immigration control (passport control and registration of foreigners); managing traffic safety; and supervising recently released prisoners. It also put the rights of the citizen before those of the state, a significant change in emphasis from the previously accepted doctrine that the militia were the ‘punishing sword of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union’.\n\nThe militia should focus on protecting the life, health, rights and freedoms of the individual and the interests of society and the state;\n\nthe structure of the MIA should be simple, flexible and cost-effective;\n\nthe work of the MIA should be focused at the local level;\n\nthe public should have free access to information about the work of the MIA;\n\nconsideration should be given to the way in which support services are organised and the pay and rank structure should be reviewed;\n\nthere should be close co-operation between the militia and local authority bodies in order to maintain public order.\n\n9The key notions of democratic policing (legitimacy, accountability and professionalism) can be seen within these statements. Legitimacy in terms of meeting the needs of the individual first, and being focused at the local level; accountability in terms of access to information and to a certain extent in co-operation with local authority bodies; and professionalism in the recognition of the need to review structure and pay, and become more flexible. How these sentiments were to be transformed into policy and practice was less clear, however, although Ukrainian academics and police practitioners at the time felt that their should be a general move away from the previous Soviet model towards the development of a system based upon accepted best practice from the rest of the world.\n\nObstacles to Reform\n\nThe Sovietised Reform Process\n\nOrganisation and Management\n\nPerformance Indicators: The Soviet Mythology of Success\n\n19This mythology of success causes three key problems in the reform process. First, it acts to perpetuate existing practices (if it works don’t fix it). Second, it undermines societal confidence in the extent to which the militia have become more accountable and transparent (a service-oriented approach is seen to be subservient to organisational priorities). Third, it can undermine attempts to persuade Ukrainian politicians and indeed oversees agencies that additional funding is required to reform the militia (existing levels of funding are already producing outstanding results).\n\nMilitia – Public Relations\n\nTraining and Selection\n\n21When independence was declared in 1991, Ukraine did not have a recognised structure of law-enforcement training and research. Most of the high-level research and training centres were located in Russian cities such as Moscow, Leningrad and Omsk, leaving a vacuum that needed to be filled. There was only one militia higher school in Kyiv, and militia schools in some regions, which carried out basic training of rank and file militia, and provided some special courses for militia officers responsible for fighting economic crimes (for example in Kharkiv).\n\n22This situation has since been improved and there is now a network of training and research institutions, with the two most significant being the National Academy of Internal Affairs based in Kyiv and the National University of Internal Affairs in Kharkiv. These two centres annually train more officers than all the other institutions in Ukraine put together, and now employ a wide range of specialists carrying out a wide range of research and training programmes.\n\n24The relatively poor level of pay and the significant reduction in social status associated with the militia has also had a negative impact upon the number and quality of candidates applying to join the militia. The Ukrainian militia is currently 12 per cent under strength and there is widespread concern that the current selection process is admitting candidates who are unsuitable for work in the police, often lacking basic levels of education.\n\nProblem of Corruption\n\n26The gravity of the problem of corruption cannot be underestimated and will play a major role in undermining efforts to develop a more democratic policing system in Ukraine. The impact on the public perception of police integrity and efficacy is considerable and no doubt helps contribute to the scale of unreported crime and the public’s ongoing scepticism about the militia’s raison d’etre.\n\nOversight and Control\n\n28In June 2003, a new law was adopted entitled ‘On Democratic Civilian Control Over Military and Law Enforcement Bodies of the State’. According to Article 7 of the law, the system will consist of control by: parliament; the president; executive authorities and local authorities; judicial bodies and the prosecutor’s office; and the public. This new act continues to give primary responsibility for overseeing observance of the law to the Prosecutor’s Office, although Articles 19 and 20 give the public and the media (in theory) greater access to information about the militia: ‘the mass media can, as laid down, ask for and receive (free of charge) from … law enforcement bodies open information, documents, and materials within their competence…’ (Article 20). In addition, the MIA have begun to make more information available to the public through the annual publication of regular reports on its activities and a new ethical code has been introduced for MIA employees. It is too soon to say how these new initiatives will work in practice, although it is hoped that it will bring about greater levels of accountability and control over the militia.\n\nFuture Priorities\n\n31More specifically, emphasis needs to be given to developing the service function of the militia, which is not only concerned with partnerships between the militia and the public, and the development of a respectful and attentive attitude to all citizens, but is also focused on putting individuals’ rights and interests at the centre of all militia activity. This in turn will help to overcome some of the hostility ordinary citizens have for the militia and improve levels of accountability.\n\n34In terms of the ruling elites within the Ministry of Interior and the Ukrainian militia, there is a pervading sense of continuity of power, control and influence. The years of transition have realised little change in the mechanisms through which the previous Soviet elites have continued to sustain their lineage. The opportunity to be promoted to the highest ranks continues to be more about whom you know, how much cash you can pay and what favours have you done than personal ability, leadership skills or scholarly activity. The situation was neatly summarised by a young Ukrainian militia officer when responding to a question about his likelihood of becoming a general: ‘you must be joking, I’m not the son of a General, my father is not rich, and I don’t take enough bribes!’."
