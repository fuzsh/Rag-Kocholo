        "text": "Overview\n\nIn 1991, the Soviet Union collapsed. The Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, a constituent republic of the Soviet Union, drafted a declaration of independence, which was overwhelming supported through a popular referendum, and became recognized as an independent state in December of 1991. Since independence, Ukraine has struggled to form a stable democracy, economy, and has struggled to deal with government corruption. Additionally, it has been caught between pro-Western and pro-EU visions of the state and movements that support a pro-Russia focus.\n\nFor further information on Ukraine's Declaration of Independence, see:\n\nCommission on Security and Cooperation in Europe. “The December 1, 1991 Referendum/Presidential Election in Ukraine.” Accessed March 8, 2022. https://www.csce.gov/sites/helsinkicommission.house.gov/files/120191UkraineReferendum.pdf.\n\nFor a brief overview of Ukraine since independence, see:"
