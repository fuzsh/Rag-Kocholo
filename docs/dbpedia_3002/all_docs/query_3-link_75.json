        "text": "After World War II, a yeshiva, known as the Sunderland Yeshiva, was established in Sunderland, followed some years later by the founding of the Sunderland Kolel. (The yeshiva was, in fact, the second yeshiva to be established in the town. In 1905, a yeshiva had been established in Sunderland by Rabbi Hirsch Hurwitz, being Britain's first ever yeshiva but it was short-lived and closed following Rabbi Hurwitz's departure from Sunderland in 1911.)\n\nFor some year there was a functioning synagogue at the Sunderland Yeshiva.\n\nIn the 1980s, due to the dwindling size of the Jewish community in Sunderland, in particularly the orthodox section of the community, the Kollel and then the Yeshiva relocated to Gateshead, where the yeshiva is still known as the Sunderland Yeshiva .\n\nThe Sunderland Kolel\n\nName:\n\nKolel Institute of Higher Rabbinic Studies(xli)\n\nOther Names:\n\nCentre for Advanced Rabbinics (from about 1986)(xlii)\n\nSunderland Kolel - Institute of Higher Rabbinic Studies (after move to Gateshread)(xliii)\n\nAddress:\n\nThe Oaks, Sunderland, until about 1986(xliv)\n\n2 The Oaks West, Sunderland SR2 8HZ, from about 1987 until move to Gateshead(xlv)\n\n139 Prince Consort Road, Gateshead NE8 1LR, from at least 2003(xlvi)\n\nWhen Formed:\n\nIn 1960, when a number of dedicated scholars from the Sunderland Yeshiva, who had reached Kolel standards, wanted to continuew their studies to more advanced levels. At the time the only other Kolel in the UK was in Gateshed.(l)\n\nPrincipals:\n\nRabbi (later Dayan) Chanoch Ehrentreu - from 1960 until 1979 and again from about 2005(li)\n\nRabbi M.
