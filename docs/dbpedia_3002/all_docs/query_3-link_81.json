        "text": "Trent Perry, a standout senior guard and McDonald’s All-American has officially committed to UCLA for college basketball, as confirmed in his interview with ESPN on Wednesday.\n\nDecision Process\n\nInitially, Perry had pledged to USC in October, but he reconsidered his decision when Andy Enfield left USC to coach at SMU. The Los Angeles native player has now opted to join UCLA, USC’s crosstown rival.\n\n“What attracted me was that there’s a good opportunity to turn things around after this past season, and I want to do that for my hometown,” Perry said.\n\nWhile exploring his options, Perry visited Virginia in late April, and although the Cavaliers seemed promising, his bond with coach Mick Cronin ultimately led him to choose UCLA.\n\nCoach Cronin’s Influence\n\n“Throughout the process, Cronin expressed how much he wanted me but he also cares about me outside of basketball. That was a big thing,” Perry said. “He values me and my game. Whatever he says, he means. He’s an honest and straightforward guy. He does not beat around the bush. He is demanding but it comes from a good place and heart.”\n\nHigh School Achievements\n\nNamed the Gatorade Player of the Year in California, Perry led Harvard Westlake High School to two CIF open division state championships. He’s ranked No. 27 overall in the ESPN 100 and holds the No. 5 spot among point guards in his class.\n\nPerry’s Skills and Performance Highlights\n\nPerry showcased his skills in high-profile games during his senior season, including an impressive 24-point, 9-rebound, and 4-assist performance against Perry High School (Arizona) at Hoophall West in December. He also excelled on the Nike EYBL circuit last spring and summer, averaging 12.5 points, 3.9 rebounds, and 3.1 assists while shooting 36.4% from 3-point range.\n\nIn the early stages of evaluation, it was clear that Perry is mentally strong and aims to excel as a versatile guard. He’s skilled at shooting both when catching the ball and dribbling. Perry is a smart point guard, making good decisions on the court and adept at understanding defensive strategies during screenplays. He knows when to pass, set up opportunities for teammates, or take a shot himself.\n\n“Trent Perry is a big-time winner and person,” Harvard-Westlake coach David Rebibo said.\n\nUCLA’s New Recruits"
