        "text": "The awards keep rolling in for USC men's basketball signee Trent Perry.\n\nPerry, who plays point guard at Studio City (Calif.) Harvard-Westlake, was named the California MaxPreps High School Basketball Player of the Year on Friday after leading his Wolverines team to Open Division section and state championships. Perry has also been named the Mission League Player of the Year for the second straight season.\n\nThe McDonald's All-American averaged 18.6 points, 6.1 rebounds and 5.9 assists per game this season for Harvard-Westlake. He shot 55 percent from inside the arc and 47.2 percent from deep as a senior. At the foul line, Perry made 86 percent of his free throws.\n\nBECOME A USCFOOTBALL.COM VIP MEMBER TODAY!Right now you can subscribe for 50% off the regular annual membership price!

The Southern California native is part of a three-player recruiting class for USC that also includes Draper (Utah) Corner Canyon power forward Brody Kozlowski and Meridian (Idaho) shooting guard Liam Campbell. Kozlowski is the No. 112 player nationally in the class and Campbell comes in at No. 152.\n\nPerry will compete to take over USC's point guard duties next season with Isaiah Collier almost certainly declaring for the NBA Draft. The Trojans will have a new look roster in 2024-25 with Boogie Ellis, DJ Rodman and Joshua Morgan all moving on. Expect Andy Enfield to add multiple players from the transfer portal.\n\nTRENT PERRY SEASON HIGHLIGHTS\n\nPerry scored 17 points to lead Harvard-Westlake to a 50-45 Open Division state championship victory over Richmond (Calif.) Salesian on March 9 in Sacramento. Perry had a steal in the final minute, hit a shot with 1:17 left to give the Wolverines a lead, made another shot with 26 seconds left to put his team up by three points, then made two free throws with 9.2 seconds remaining to clinch the win. The victory gave Perry and Harvard-Westlake its second straight state title.\n\nIn Harvard-Westlake's 63-59 Southern California Open Division regional final win over Eastvale (Calif.) Roosevelt a week earlier, Perry scored 28 points, which included 14 in the fourth quarter.\n\n“He refuses to lose,” Harvard-Westlake coach David Rebibo told the LA Times. “He’s putting his imprint all over this place and it’s so fun to see.”"
