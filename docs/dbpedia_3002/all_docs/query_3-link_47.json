        "text": "What better time to announce Draftboard’s $4.1M funding round than under the shadow of attack drones and cruise missiles? 🤣 About 2 years ago I was sitting on my couch and had an idea to completely disrupt how companies hire. I sat on it for almost 6 months. Because I was afraid I’d actually have to go build it. Like lots of other people, I kept a list of startup ideas, even though I had zero desire to be a founder. When I consulted that list after leaving IAC, I confirmed what I thought: they all sucked. But when this new idea hit, it was different. Finally, after months of hesitating, I decided to explore it, however tentatively. I fleshed out the vision & opportunity in a 3-page essay - I needed to test if the logic withstood the rigor of actually writing it out. I asked a close friend (Shlomo Dalezman) about the technical feasibility of it. I sketched dozens of wireframes on a whiteboard. I found a great designer in South Africa to build out some super simple mockups and put together a 13-page deck. And then it was go time. 18 months later we’ve got thousands of scouts referring candidates. We’ve had 70 companies list their roles. We’ve had almost $1M in referral bonuses posted. And we’re just getting started. But I wouldn’t be here with my incredible investors, and that’s why I’m thrilled to announce this round of funding. Taylor Greene knew within ten seconds that Twelve Below was all-in. Amanda Herson met me for coffee on a brisk fall day and I knew she & Founder Collective would be an incredible asset. David Stark & Ground Up Ventures are just as incredible as partners as I knew they would be, and deserve serious credit for getting me to - for the first time - seriously consider taking the founder leap. And Nico Berardi and Antonio Osio at ANIMO Ventures are avid - and active - supporters every day. Between them and the dozens of angels and friends & family, I and my amazing team count ourselves incredibly fortunate to get to build this vision out with all their support. The journey is long and arduous, but the goal is worth it. Onwards and upwards.
