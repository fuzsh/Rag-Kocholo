        "text": "Senior guard Trent Perry, a McDonald's All American and the highest-ranked uncommitted prospect in the 2024 class, has committed to UCLA, he told ESPN on Wednesday.\n\nPerry had originally committed to USC in October but reopened his recruitment when Andy Enfield left the Trojans to take over at SMU. The Los Angeles-area native is now headed to USC's crosstown rival.\n\n\"What attracted me was that there's a good opportunity to turn things around after this past season, and I want to do that for my hometown,\" Perry said.\n\nWhile Perry visited Virginia in late April and the Cavaliers seemed to have momentum, it was the point guard's relationship with coach Mick Cronin that gave UCLA the edge.\n\n\"Throughout the process, Cronin expressed how much he wanted me but he also cares about me outside of basketball. That was a big thing,\" Perry said. \"He values me and my game. Whatever he says, he means. He's an honest and straightforward guy. He does not beat around the bush. He is demanding but it comes from a good place and heart.\"\n\nThe Gatorade Player of the Year in California, Perry led Harvard Westlake High School to two CIF open division state championships. He's a 6-foot-4 player from North Hollywood who ranks No. 27 overall in the ESPN 100 and as the No. 5 point guard in the class.\n\nPerry had impressive performances in high-profile games during his senior season, including a 24-point, 9-rebound, 4-assist performance in a win over Perry High School (Arizona) at Hoophall West in December. He also averaged 12.5 points, 3.9 rebounds and 3.1 assists in 23 games on the Nike EYBL circuit last spring and summer, shooting 36.4% from 3-point range.\n\nEarly in the evaluation process, Perry's mental toughness and desire to be a complete guard were evident. He shoots equally well off the catch and the dribble. The cerebral point guard is steady and a great decision-maker, playing with a high basketball IQ and effectively reading ball-screen coverages. He understands when to move the ball, create for his teammates or score.\n\n\"Trent Perry is a big-time winner and person,\" Harvard-Westlake coach David Rebibo said.\n\nPerry is the eighth newcomer to UCLA, joining six transfers -- Kobe Johnson (USC), Skyy Clark (Louisville), Eric Dailey Jr. (Oklahoma State), Tyler Bilodeau (Oregon State), William Kyle III (South Dakota State) and Dominick Harris (Loyola Marymount) -- and ESPN 100 recruit Eric Freeny. They will combine with returning starters Sebastian Mack (12.1 PPG), Dylan Andrews (12.9 PPG) and Lazar Stefanovic (11.5 PPG) on what should be a top-25 team.\n\nThe Bruins are expected to bounce back after last season's 16-17 showing -- Cronin's worst single-season record since he was at Cincinnati in 2008. And Perry should be at the heart of that turnaround.\n\n\"I'm going to bring all that I have to impact winning,\" Perry said. \"Going through the process was pretty hectic and got stressful at times but I'm very blessed to now have peace and clarity.\""
