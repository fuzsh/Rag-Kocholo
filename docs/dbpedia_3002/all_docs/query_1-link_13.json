This would leave only Algeria among North African former colonies of France where the traditional family code continues to significantly limit women's civil rights. \"How can society achieve progress while women, who represent half the nation, see their rights violated and suffer as a result of injustice, violence and marginalization?\" asked the king in his address to the opening session of Morocco's parliament last month. Since the promulgation of a series of family laws in 1957 and 1958, the status of Moroccan women in civil law has been governed by the Code of Personal Status, known as the Mudawwana and based on the Malikite school of Islamic law. Under the code, women are treated as legal minors, have no say in their marriage contracts, have very limited access to divorce and are required to obey their husbands in all matters. \"The personal status code, part of Morocco's civil law, establishes a system of inequality based on sex and relegates women to a subordinate status in society,\" said Human Rights Watch in urging the Moroccan government to change its legal code. \"Women face government-sponsored discrimination that renders them unequal before the law ... and restricts women's participation in public life,\" the group said.

In particular they are present in the Jamaa El Fna Square, which has a long-standing reputation as a carnival centre in an increasingly conservative country. \"They do it for survival,\" Moroccan travel writer Yusuf Elalamy told BBC World Service's Masterpiece programme. \"It's performance, it's open-air, it's spontaneous, but they expect you to give something in return....\n\nA Moroccan feast! Gulf Daily News\n\nIt was in Morocco that I had my first exposure to Arab hospitality. I was a 19-year old student wandering around Europe by train and had ventured across to North Africa. It was the month of August, it was scorching hot, and it was Ramadan. I have to admit that in those days I knew very little about Islam, and on my first day in Rabat, the capital, I was so fascinated to see people scurrying about as sunset approached, that I sat down on a step to watch the crowds rushing home. Suddenly, I was approached by a young Moroccan, who stopped in front of me, said something in Arabic which I didn't understand, and then grabbed my hand. ...\n\nMorocco: A camel's-eye view\n\n05 November 2003 By Denis Horgan LA Times-Washington Post\n\nWhen a camel's left front leg goes out, its right rear hip bounds sideways while its front left shoulder rises skyward and its rear end sags and its right rear knee bends the opposite way entirely, causing a general swaying, surging, lunging and tossing. This process is reversed when the camel uses another hoof, the camel being blessed or cursed with four legs, all moving languorously but no two bending in the same direction at the same time.\n\nSeasick atop the ship of the desert, you will be tossed about like a rag doll or a marionette in a windstorm. You will ache everywhere. The camel, meanwhile, ambles along genially, its mind in the clouds, chewing away like an American teenager with gum and plotting new ways to make you uncomfortable  like scraping you against a wall or the only tree within 300 kilometres.\n\nYet anyone who skips a camel trip in Morocco is cheating themselves of an enormous treat. You might as well skip the labyrinthine souqs (markets) of ancient Fez or skip the astonishing greenery of the oases at Zis, startling explosions of colour amid the terrific bleakness of sand and rock. You might as well, skip, too, Fez's tanneries, which give a preview of hell, or the bizarre bazaars of Marrakech's Djemaa el Fna or the Valley of 1000 Kasbahs. ... more\n\nHomegrown change in Morocco\n\nFrederick Vreeland IHT Thursday, October 30, 2003\n\nA monarch's vision MARRAKECH, Morocco While the Defense Department is dreaming of how its Iraq policies will transform Arab states into democracies, one Arab country is quietly working a democratic revolution without any apparent outside influence. King Muhammad VI of Morocco opened this autumn's session of Parliament by laying before the legislators a sweeping reform that effectively grants women equality with men. Since the early 1990's, civil rights groups have clamored for reform of the 1957 decrees that institutionalize the second-rate status of Moroccan women, but no one had predicted that Morocco's centuries-old discrimination against women could be reversed in one fell swoop.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\nTry some exotic styles from Morocco\n\nPosted on Sat, Nov. 01, 2003\n\nMorocco, the northwest African country set between desert and sea and bordered by the Mediterranean and the Atlantic, is a true melting pot of civilizations, populated by diverse ethnic and religious groups with 11 official languages. The very word - Morocco - conjures exoticism. Being at the coastal crossroads of Europe and Africa, it represents many cultures, traditions and styles, and has long provided inspiration for artists and designers captivated by its multitude of flavors.\n\nI've never been to Morocco, but that hasn't hampered my enthusiasm and appreciation for the artifacts, colors and designs from that country. In the U.S., Moroccan influences can be seen in many design styles - in looks both ancient and modern. What makes Moroccan style so exotic and distinctive is its singular use of color, pattern, and texture, and how these ingredients are blended to produce their incredible architecture and furnishings.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\nLow prices lure directors to Morocco\n\nANGELA DOLAND Associated Press MARRAKECH, Morocco\n\nTake a warrior king or a crusading knight. Throw in lots of sandy desert, some grisly battle scenes and an army of extras. The sword-and-sandals flick is getting a Hollywood revival, thanks to \"Gladiator.\" There's only one problem: Many upcoming movies are set in the Middle East, where \"shooting a movie\" could take on a whole different meaning right now.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn Morocco, medieval meets modern\n\nBy G.G. LaBelle The Associated Press FEZ, Morocco\n\nIt's impossible not to get jostled in the narrow alleys in the old city of Fez. Coming toward you, or trying to squeeze past, are formidable Moroccan ladies in black, grizzled men pulling hand carts and boys tugging donkeys.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Languishing Language of Morocco's Northern Coast A Story of Stews, Siestas, Social Clubs, Spanish Exiles and a 1,300-Page Jaquetia Dictionary The Food Maven\n\nBy MATTHEW GOODMAN Like an archaeologist painstakingly mapping the contours of a ruined city, Alegria Bendelac spent 10 years of her life creating a dictionary for a language that is no longer spoken. Ms. Bendelac, a petite, energetic woman who looks much younger than her years, was born and raised in Tangier, Morocco. Her family was among the last few hundred Jews in a city in which some 10,000 once resided. As André Aciman wrote about his own family living in Egypt, they were \"at the very tail end of those whom history shrugs aside when it changes its mind.\".................\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMarrakech Expressions THE HOUR\n\nBy LEONARD FEIN\n\nYes, I know there are important things, perhaps even cataclysmic things, happening in the world. But here in Marrakech their urgency somehow recedes. A well-informed guide delights in a receptive client; ours is a fountain from which everything pours out: political history and art history, sociology and archeology, economics and agriculture, irrigation systems and theology. I drown in data on the dynasties, the wars, the conquests, the defeats, in seemingly endless and mindless succession, am wearied by it all, when suddenly it occurs to me that 500 and a 1,000 years from now, our times will seem no less mad, no less bloody, no less given to folly than the times of the Berbers, the Almoravids, the Almohads, the Wattasids and the rest. One weeps for the endlessness of it all, wonders whether peace is inherently veiled, slaughter our more common condition.............\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nReimagining a World of Bittersweet Splendor Poignant Morocco Exhibit Portrays a Lost Realm of Intermingled Cultures\n\nBy MARC MICHAEL EPSTEIN\n\nRabat, Fez, Mogador, Tangier - the very names of these cities evoke the play of light and shadow on white stucco in narrow alleyways, ancient wooden doors opening on exquisitely tiled courtyards. Merely allude to Morocco and the imagination conjures up a host of associations - romantic and orientalist, literary and musical, sensory and culinary. If one could only bottle the rich essence of the setting and its cultures! Many have, in fact, tried and failed, but The Jewish Museum's exhibition \"Morocco: Jews and Art in a Muslim Land,\" on view through February 11, 2001, succeeds brilliantly, allowing more than 180 spectacular objects their own space to breathe. Each artifact, be it sumptuous or humble, stands on its own as an art object, an ethnographic document or a relic of a culture, yet all come together to form a coherent picture of a larger society.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGo with the grain: Vegetarian discovers beauty of couscous in exotic Morocco\n\nBy Lee Zucker October 23, 2003 Vegetarian Kitchen The Register-Guard, Eugene, Oregon\n\nI have eaten couscous in North African homes and restaurants on four continents during the past 30 years - usually to the point of gluttony. I've loved it in almost all its infinite variety: No two cooks season the crowning stew with the same hand - there's always a little more of this, a little less of that. A succulent adventure. The rare occasions when couscous has been underwhelming or even truly awful have been on our continent, where it's common to play fast and loose with tradition to save time and effort, even on great classics.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nA King's Appeal By Jim Hoagland Washington Post Thursday, October 16, 2003; Page A25\n\nWestern democracies won the Cold War by shaking open closed societies and exposing their failures and crimes to citizens who then refused to go on living that way. The great political challenge of today is to induce similar change in Arab nations and other Islamic countries that do not respect the rights and dignity of their own citizens.\n\nThink of it as collateral repair: The coming wave of epochal change must also be driven by internal forces, with restrained but committed support from abroad. The ultimate goal is reform within Islam conceived and carried out by Muslim leaders, scholars and civic groups, substantively welcomed by the West.\n\nAnd that reform must begin with the role and rights of women in the Islamic world. A question posed last week in as important a speech as I have read recently makes that unblinkingly clear: \"How can society achieve progress while women, who represent half the nation, see their rights violated and suffer as a result of injustice, violence and marginalization, notwithstanding the dignity and justice granted them by our glorious religion?\"\n\nThe irrefutable logic about the high cost of institutionalized gender discrimination was voiced by Morocco's King Mohammed VI last Friday at the opening of Parliament in Rabat. He then outlined far-reaching changes in family and divorce laws for the kingdom that would effectively lessen the intrusive reach of religious authorities into gender issues. .....

On the one hand, many are eager to continue the democratization process started toward the end of the reign of King Hassan II, which was given a boost by King Muhammad VI when he ascended the throne. Opposition newspapers and new political parties flourished. But the transition period was short-lived. Soon after the September 11 attacks on America, security forces started to regain their influence as the kingdom's traditional elite  the makhzen - began to worry that Al Qaeda's ideas might spread to Morocco. By the time the May 16 attacks took place, democratization was put on hold.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMovies in Morocco, The 3rd Marrakech International Film Festival by Howard Feinstein\n\n\"I'm a real bitch when it comes to my rights,\" says brash singer/belly dancer/hooker Sahar in the Egyptian film \"Lace.\" Sahar is played by the great icon of Arab cinema, Yousra. This five-year-old film, which belongs to the catfight genre, was part of a homage to the legendary thesp at the third edition of the Marrakech International Film Festival (October 3-8)\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHidden Agendas in the Sand\n\nIan Williams and Stephen Zunes, September 24, 2003 Guerrilla News Network\n\nAfter much wrangling from the French, the UN Security Council unanimously passed resolution 1495 right on the July 31st deadline for the rollover of the MINURSO peacekeeping operation in Western Sahara. In the best diplomatic tradition, the resolution affirmed the commitment to provide for the self-determination of the people of Western Sahara, even while it seriously compromised on it by supporting a peace plan that would allow the Moroccan settlers in the territory to vote on independence in five years. As with Israeli settlers on the West Bank, these Moroccan colonists are there in violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention, which prohibits countries from transfering their civilian population onto territories seized by military force. The Security Council had fought off a similar plan last year, but this time former U.S. Secretary of State James Baker, UN Secretary General Kofi Annan's special representative, adjusted the plan to provide for a genuine Sahrawi autonomy in the five years before the proposed referendum. This was an ominous sign for the increasingly autocratic rule of King Mohammed in Morocco itself, not to mention leading to uncertainty about the result of the referendum: one fixed principle of Rabat's policy has been never to allow a vote that its principals cannot control.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nA Couscous of Cultures, Simmered for Centuries in Morocco\n\nSeptember 22, 2003 By ANNE MIDGETTE New York Times\n\nIt is a sign of Western cultural bias that the term \"classical music\" is commonly understood to apply to only the music of North America and Europe, although \"world music\" (an equally catchall term) includes many traditions that are even older. The Orchestra of Fès, which played at Zankel Hall on Saturday night, was founded in Morocco in 1946, but the Arab-Andalusian music it plays goes back to the ninth century. For Western audiences the word orchestra conjures up visions of vast ensembles, but here it was six male instrumentalists joined by a singer, Françoise Atlan. Since the Middle Ages the instrumentation of ensembles devoted to this repertory - notable for its blend of Spanish, Muslim and Jewish influences - has changed considerably. The original diminutive lute morphed into the six-stringed oud of Egypt; the traditional tar, a small tambourine that sets and accents the tempo, was joined by a goblet-shaped drum called a darbuka; and in the 19th-century Western violins and violas were added, here held upright on the players' knees and bowed like violas da gamba. But there was nothing the least bit antiquated about the performance: this group could teach classical music a lot about keeping traditions alive. The Andalusian repertory was codified in the 18th century into 11 lengthy cycles called nubat; because the shortest of these extends over five CD's when performed in its entirety, the usual practice is to play individual movements from a cycle, and a more recent trend is, as this orchestra did, to combine parts of several nubat in new sets, allowing the ensemble to put its stamp on the music. Texts range from Spanish-Jewish folk songs to songs about the prophet Muhammad. The components of each set are separated by vocal or instrumental solos: musings on the oud, or cascades of minor-key runs descending on the violin over a sustained drone from the viola; or the silvery singing of Ms. Atlan, delicate as filigree, drawing the strings behind her in echo. At other times the instruments joined in rousing ensembles, and Ms. Atlan's slender voice was swallowed up by the rougher sandpaper burr of the voices of the men in chorus, dominated by a cracking countertenor. The virtuosity was as undeniable as the appeal. At the end of this nearly two-hour concert the ensemble was joined for its encore by the rhythmic clapping of the audience in raucous accompaniment.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWashington Times has featured a special report on Morocco on its summer issue.

They are old and their cool is subtle, carrying hints of wisdom and poise. Johnny Cash, Marlon Brando, Georgia O'Keeffe: We behold their weathered sangfroid and we are ineluctably intrigued. As I was, years ago, watching the 1990 film \"The Sheltering Sky.\" Based on a 1949 novel of the same name by the American expat Paul Bowles (1910-1999), the movie follows three aimless Americans who land in Bowles's adopted home, Tangier, Morocco, and wander south, only to be destroyed by primal Third World realities: thieves, mystical religion and illness. Bowles makes a cameo appearance as narrator, and, in the end, we see him watch one of the stars drift into an ancient Tangier cafe. He just stands there, motionless, an old man with white hair and rheumy gray eyes. All he says to the woman before him is, \"Are you lost?\" And yet somehow he embodies existential grace, and a link to a bygone era.\n\nPost Magazine: The Allure of Tangier Bill Donahue Special to The Washington Post Monday, September 22, 2003; 1:00 PM Author Paul Bowles helped to establish Tangier as a world center of cool and mysticism.

Britain got Egypt, Italy took Libya, and Morocco went to France. The high-level landgrab left its cultural mark, as Arabs will be the first to tell you. Respectable Egyptians suffer from the stigma of being stuffy and unexciting, the big bores of the Middle East, while the lower-class Egyptian, like your average English yob, is a soccer hooligan. And Egyptian food, while we're on the subject, is nothing to write your mummy about. So there. Libyans, like Italians, became enamored with the cult of the charismatic and deranged dictator. Mussolini is long gone, but Libya is still stuck with Col. Muammar Qaddafi. But Morocco! Morocco got lucky and inherited the French flair for food . So while the rest of the Maghreb is busy coming to terms with its colonial past, Moroccans have conquered the world with a secret weapon: couscous. If you, gentle Seattleite, haven't been won over yet by this classic Berber banquet dish, it's likely because until recently there was no real Moroccan restaurant or couscouserie hereabouts. But Marrakesh has arrived in Belltown. So line up to be won over............................\n\nFACTBOX-What to watch for in Moroccan local elections\n\nRABAT, Sept 12 (Reuters)\n\nMorocco's 14.6 million voters are being asked to elect 23,689 local councillors on Friday. These are the first local elections since King Mohammed came to the throne in 1999, pledging to continue democratic reform in the North African country. Polling stations are open from 8 a.m. (0800 GMT) to 7 p.m. (1900 GMT) Following are key points:\n\nTHE ISLAMISTS The Justice and Development Party (PJD) emerged in parliamentary elections a year ago as the main opposition force. Emphasising conservative family values and ethics in public life, it was successful in lower-income suburbs of large cities. The PJD condemned the Casablanca suicide bombings in May, which were carried out by a fringe radical Islamist group. But after opponents accused the party of having sown the seeds of extremism, it toned down its rhetoric. It fields candidates for only 20 percent of seats and has made it clear it is not aiming for an electoral breakthrough.\n\nGOVERNMENT PARTIES AND ALTERNATIVES The Socialist Union of Popular Forces (USFP) and the centre-right Istiqlal (Independence) party head the coalition government. With 23 smaller parties also presenting candidates, the political landscape remains highly fragmented. VOTER APATHY,\n\nFRAUD After decades of political repression until the early 1990s, with a tame parliament and local government still perceived as riven with corruption, Moroccans need convincing their vote counts. Only 52 percent of registered voters turned out for last year's parliamentary polls, despite heavy government publicity. The authorities say they want a fair vote, but irregularities have been reported, including promises of jobs or free pharmaceuticals in some cases.\n\nWESTERN SAHARA High turnout in disputed Western Sahara would be seen by Rabat as boosting its territorial claim, at a time when it has been backed into a corner by its rejection of the latest version of a U.N. peace plan. Western Sahara has been largely controlled by Morocco since 1976 but the Algerian-backed Polisario Front wants independence. In last year's elections to the Rabat parliament, Morocco said turnout there was 70 percent of 140,000 registered voters. In Laayoune, the territory's main city, candidates from various parties said there had been fraud.\n\nWHAT ELSE IS NEW? The minimum voting age was lowered to 18 from 20 this year. For the first time, voters will elect city councils for the country's largest cities: Casablanca, Fez, Marrakesh, Rabat, Sale and Tangiers. They will each have a mayor, elected by the new council.\n\nSlaying of Jewish merchant shocks Muslim Morocco's small Jewish community\n\nCASABLANCA, Morocco September 11, 2003\n\nTwo masked men killed a Jewish wood merchant Thursday at point blank range, the first time in memory that a Jewish citizen of this Muslim kingdom in North Africa has been gunned down, the official MAP news agency said. The motive for the killing of 55-year-old Albert Rebibo was not known. However, it came as a blow to Jewish leaders here. Morocco's small but ancient Jewish community - some 3,500 members - was targeted in five nearly simultaneous suicide bombings on May 16 that killed 33 bystanders and a dozen bombers. No Jews were killed in the attacks. However, a Jewish social club, a restaurant run by a Jew and a Jewish cemetery were among the targets. \"The Moroccan Jewish community has been hit on this anniversary date of Sept. 11,\" said Serge Berdugo, head of the Council of Israelite Communities of Morocco. He was referring to Thursday's second anniversary of the terror attacks in the United States. \"I hope our community will have the needed wherewithal to overcome this challenge,\" Berdugo said. Police were searching for the two masked men who fired with a pistol at Rebibo as he was closing his shop about midday. The men were then surrounded by a crowd, but dispersed the gathering with shots in the air, police said. The suspects were then reported to have stolen a car to flee via the highway. Morocco and Israel have begun a process of normalization, marked by the Sept. 2 visit of Israeli Foreign Minister Silvan Shalom.

Although shaken by the terror attacks, the country is busy forging stronger economic links with the West. James Badcock reports.\n\nThe terrorist bombings in Casablanca in May were a terrible shock to Morocco, especially given the government's recent course towards greater political freedom within the country and the extension of trade links with Western nations.\n\nAt least 43 people were killed. Ominously the suicide bombers themselves and all those so far detained in connection with the attacks against foreign targets are Moroccans.\n\nPrime Minister Driss Jettou's government has since stressed the extraordinary nature of the attack, pointing out that Morocco has always been tolerant towards foreign residents and the country's remaining Jewish population. However, the Prime Minister also criticised the PJD, the leading Islamist party, for the \"systematic manner\" in which they condemn security measures against suspected terrorist organisations.\n\nIn other words, Morocco is not another Algeria, and the authorities will not allow fundamentalism to threaten the process of opening the country up to increased partnership with Europe and Washington.\n\nThe general economic picture, however, continues to be one of a country hamstrung by debt and the need to generate growth in the economy to provide work for the many unemployed, particularly amongst the young. Officially last year's unemployment rate was estimated at 11.6%, against 12.5% the previous year, but it is commonly considered to be far higher, perhaps as high as 40%. News of a good 2002 for tourism with travel receipts of $2.3bn, up 18.8% on 2001, was welcome, as were the winter rains which mean the cereal harvest for 2002/2003 will be 59% greater than the previous season.\n\nAccording to the annual IMF report, published in May, the country's economic conditions improved in 2002. Real GDP growth reached 4.5% thanks to a rise in agricultural output and somewhat higher growth than before in the non-agricultural sectors.\n\nDespite the good news in the vital sectors of agriculture and tourism, the truth is that in international trade, Moroccan exports are slipping in comparison with imports. Figures released by Morocco's Exchange Office in May showed a 68.8% increase in the national trade deficit in the first quarter of 2003, following a 9.6% drop in exports and a 9.3% rise in imports. Excluding Morocco's staple export commodity, phosphates and derived products, exports fell by 10.6% compared to the same period last year.\n\nMorocc - US trade accords on the way\n\nUndaunted by the fragility of domestic industry, Prime Minister Jettou vowed in April to press on with the liberalisation of the economy to prepare the way for a future of free-flowing international trade and competition.\n\nHe made special reference to privatisation, one of the keystones of international trade agreements, announcing the onset of a fresh round of de-regulation. Public industrial and trade services, water distribution networks, electricity, waste collection and public transport will all be gradually \"transferred to the private sector whenever this will draw profit in terms of investments, job opportunities and quality\".\n\nNegotiations with the US over a free trade accord have been moving apace with three rounds concluded before the halfway point of 2003 and talk of the agreement being finalised before the end of the year. Morocco would become only the fifth country to have reached such terms with the US, alongside Canada, Mexico, Israel and Jordan.\n\nThe first talks took place in Washington in January, while the second round was held in Geneva in March during a sensitive period in relations between the Arab world and the US as the build-up to war in Iraq got underway.\n\nThe Moroccan Minister of Foreign Affairs and co-operation told the upper house of parliament that the agreement aims to integrate the Moroccan economy in the regional and international environment, upgrade Moroccan enterprises by sharpening their competitive edge, attract more foreign investment and generate more jobs.\n\nThe head of the Moroccan delegation, Khalid Sayah, stressed the importance of freedom of movement for individuals between the two countries, seeking \"an easier and greater accessibility to the US market for qualified personnel, technicians and professionals; be they craftsmen, doctors, lawyers, engineers, or accountants.\"\n\nThe eleven thematic groups involved in the negotiations deal with market access, textile, services, agriculture, customs, environment, copyright, investments, legal, social issues and public appropriations. Encouragingly, in March the US congress lowered import duties on Moroccan carpets.\n\nTrade with the US, however, constitutes at present a very small part of Morocco's foreign exchanges. According to recent figures, France is the kingdom's dominant trade partner with 23.7% of exchanges, followed by Spain (12.7%), The United Kingdom (5.9%), Italy (5.5%) and Germany (4.2%) all ahead of the US. Relations with Morocco's closest neighbour, Spain, have recovered this year, after the breaking-off of all diplomatic contact in 2002 over a disputed island in the Strait of Gibraltar. Ambassadors for the two countries returned to their posts in early February and there have been several talks at governmental level since then.\n\nFisheries, agric will be sticking points\n\nThe rapprochement was sealed by the joint presentation of a document by France and Morocco to the 5x5 forum of Maghreb nations and their five nearest European neighbours. The paper broached the prickly topic of migration under three headings: the contribution of migration flows to the emergence of a feeling of belonging to a common Euro-Mediterranean space; gradual standardisation of legal migrants' statutes; free movement of people favouring the dynamism of North-South relations.\n\nDespite past accusations that the Moroccan government was not doing enough to stem the flow of migrants northwards, the Spanish Foreign Minister, Ana Palacio commented that Spain \"share[d] the three axes of reflection proposed by the document\".\n\nPortugal has also been courting the Moroccan government, perhaps motivated by the proximity of fishing waters at present off-limits to European fishermen with the exception of those from the oil-slick affected region of Spain invited to compensate for their lost business since December last year. In May, the two countries wound up, in Rabat, the 7th session of their high joint-commission with the adoption of a package of agreements meant to upgrade bilateral co-operation, including plans for a financial accord worth E100m to fund Portuguese projects in Morocco.\n\nIndeed, fisheries and agriculture are likely to be the two biggest sticking points in Morocco's discussions with the EU over the eventual implementation of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership Agreement for a free commercial zone.\n\nOriginally signed in February 1996, the agreement is set to come into force in 2012 after a process of gradual liberalisation of markets in the meantime. Morocco and the EU had a fisheries agreement, allowing European ships to operate in Moroccan waters between 1995 and 2000, but despite incessant wrangling since then, it has not been renewed. Morocco wishes to build up the industry, which employs over 400,000 people with an annual turnover of $1.6bn, before being forced to allow a return to competition for stocks.\n\nSimilarly in the case of agriculture, Morocco argued in negotiations in January that the total openness of competition demanded by the EU is inappropriate between the hi-tech European agri-food industry and Morocco's poorer farmers.\n\nThey insist that the level of development in rural areas, where over half of the kingdom's population lives, be taken into account in the final terms of the accord. Morocco has received over $1bn from the EU under the current agreement, about half in direct aid and half in the form of loans from the European Investment Bank.\n\nAnother reason for the stalling of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership Agreement is the lack of cohesion between the Maghreb states concerned.\n\nThe Maghreb Union (UMA), which also includes Libya, Tunisia and Mauritania, has been frozen since 1995 as a result of tension between Algeria and Morocco due to the former's support for the Polisario in their fight for an independent Western Sahara. Despite some recent low-level contacts between the two largest nations in the Maghreb, there are still no plans for a meeting between the Heads of State. Likewise, a resolution of the disputed status of Western Sahara could still be a way off.\n\nThe Moroccan authorities' dream of becoming a Muslim nation with highly-developed commercial links with the West is still alive, albeit a little shaken by the violence in Casablanca. Clearly, increased prosperity and employment are almost certainly the best weapons against unrest and extremism, and it is essential to restore international confidence in Morocco as an economic partner of the future © African Business 2003 17-Jul-03 Article originally published by African Business 17-Jul-03\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------\n\nThe United States and the Kingdom of Morocco negotiate free trade agreement as old friends with new priorities\n\nThe United States and the Kingdom of Morocco Negotiate Free Trade Agreement as Old Friends with New Priorities In an April 23, 2002, White House ceremony, President George W.

After all, the town we see today was born out of disaster. When an earthquake flattened the Atlantic port in 1960, Agadir was rebuilt from scratch. Le Corbusier was selected to design low-rise, tremor-proof buildings. His functional constructions are rarely beautiful, but Agadir's skyline is dominated by the Atlas foothills rather than hotel blocks. Two hundred miles from Casablanca, the town shares a similar latitude to the Canary Islands. Year-round sun attracted 70,000 Brits last year, mainly couples or families.\n\nDue to fly out two days after the 16 May bombings, Sadie Turner and Matt Lewery, from Brighton, couldn't change their destination. 'Our travel agents said the Foreign Office only warned of 'higher risk' so we couldn't cancel, and at such short notice everything they offered as an alternative was too dear.' When the couple arrived, though, they found the locals welcoming and enjoyed a Berber feast in the desert.\n\nMatt Lowe and Rebecca Fox, from Highbury, said: 'We decided to risk lightning not striking twice: Casablanca was a commercial centre - this is a resort.' Chantel Ostler, from Portsmouth, and boyfriend Chris Wilson, from Winchester, had no hesitation. 'We don't think twice about going to London, and that's just as dangerous.' They had found an unmissable deal: one week half-board at a three-star hotel for £160 through Panorama on Teletext four weeks ago.\n\nExchange rate is 14dm = £1.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMorocco: When the Spirit Moves By Satellite\n\nBy David Kithcart\n\nFor CWNews\n\nJune 6, 2003\n\nThe Muslim world may restrict the Gospel, yet the Christian message is still getting through to hungry people.

They walked-men and women, Muslims and Jews, atheists and Christians, Berbers and Arabs, children and the elderly -to show how national pride and coexistence are experienced in daily life. They carried flags and pictures of the king; they displayed slogans condemning terror; and they chanted Allah Akbar and la ilalha illa allah. It was, in my opinion, the most momentous act of courage Moroccans have displayed in modern history. Just like anti-colonial nationalists and Green March volunteers were willing to give their lives to liberate their country from foreign occupation, those who marched in Casablanca did so to reclaim their rich heritage from the reign of terror. They are our heroes, entitled to the same accolades and wisams. They are torch bearers in a region out of focus and a world without compass.\n\nThose marchers were also the best messengers for Islam that I have seen in my lifetime. They were patriotic without being chauvinistic, proud without being arrogant, peaceful without being weak, and Muslim without being prejudiced. One veiled woman carried the picture of the victims and showed her utter contempt for the so-called Muslim perpetrators of the act. Our Jewish brothers and sisters (who, as we all know, lived in Morocco way before Islam) came out in huge numbers to reaffirm their unshakable commitment to their homeland and join ranks with their Muslim compatriots. A 17-year-old Jewish woman marched to defend the land of her ancestors. When did anyone witness such a scene before?\n\nThe march was, by far, the best concrete demonstration that Islam has nothing to do with terror. All the declarations and disclaimers by Muslim officials before this momentous day were not taken too seriously by many skeptics and Islamophobes. But this event is different. Now the nations of the world could see for themselves. Here was a shining example of \"moral clarity,\" a perfect illustration of conviction without hatred, national solidarity without scapegoats. It's as if the marchers were marking a new day of independence, forging a new charter for the 21st century and the rest of the millennium. They were affirming that human oneness is more important than ideological purity; that human beings, regardless of faith, are more precious than theologies. God's creation, in whatever color or idiom it appears, is always sacred. To destroy the beautiful but fragile fabric of life in such a reckless manner is nothing short of satanic.\n\nNo event has vindicated Islam more powerfully since 9/11 than this historic march. What misguided Muslims have destroyed the brave marchers in Casablanca have begun to mend. Raised in a melting pot at the crossroads of civilizations, Moroccans know how to live with difference. Only last week, the U.S. House of Representatives introduced a resolution expressing solidarity with Morocco because, among other things, it \"has chosen the path of diversity and tolerance.\" The march in Casablanca will not only confirm this tradition, but it may also become a textbook model in the struggle for peace and justice in the Islamic world.\n\nThe long and painful road to global coexistence begins in Casablanca.\n\nMay 26, 2003.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThey don't mention the war\n\nReassuringly, in these post-conflict days, Moroccans are as welcoming as ever to British tourists.

Decorated by a deep-brown pattern of henna dye, Ms. Aicha's nimble fingers prod, adjust, and flip the flaky Moroccan pancakes that are cooking perfectly before her eyes in the kitchen at Argana, a popular Moroccan restaurant in Cambridge, Mass.

If nothing else, it's a reminder of the sheer size of the Sahara region. It stretches from the Atlantic to the Red Sea. It touches no fewer than 10 countries: Western Sahara, Morocco, Mauritania, Algeria, Mali, Niger, Tunisia, Libya, Chad, Egypt and Sudan.
