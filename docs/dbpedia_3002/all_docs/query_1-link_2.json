        "text": "This nostalgia-soaked piece in The Guardian is the latest fruit of the amba-addicted Rachel Shabi's publicity machine for her controversial book Not the enemy. Shabi usefully breaks down the 'white-colonial' stereotype by pointing out that Mizrahim (she irritatingly calls them Mizrahis) are half of Israel's Jewish population; but although more nuanced and less political, this offering still cannot resist denigrating but misleading generalisations and digs at the 'European ruling minority'. For instance, hebraizing your name was not an exclusively Mizrahi phenomenon: one David Green did it too. He is known to us as David Ben-Gurion. (With thanks: Niran)\n\n\"Those reservations about being far from \"home\" (I was never sure which one - Iraq or Israel) were sometimes nudged by the sort of migrant experiences that were typical of British life in the 1970s. Back then, Britain wasn't especially interested in my parents being Iraqi, or Israeli, or whatever. Perhaps they were just \"foreign\" - at any rate, that was how I tended to perceive them as a child. There were long trips in search of pitta bread and long waits for visiting relatives to bring us bottles of amba, the radioactively bright mango pickle that Iraqis seem addicted to. My mum admits that she would go to a pet-food shop for the unhusked sunflower seeds that she'd roast for us to crack open between our teeth as a snack. (\"Yes, that's right, for the budgie,\" she'd tell the shopkeeper.)\n\nI didn't realise then that the seed-cracking was a hallmark oriental habit - or that, in early Israel, public transport operators were so confounded by the carpets of seed husks that lined the buses, courtesy of passengers, that they erected signs to discourage the practice. When I was young, I didn't know the pet-shop story, either. Had my mum told me then, I'd have been embarrassed, as I was by all things that made me appear \"foreign\". A migrant kid, I assumed that blanding out my background would somehow make me more British, whereas all it could possibly achieve was to make me more bland.(..)\n\n\"As it turns out, scores of Israeli children were experiencing something similar at that time. Approximately half the population of Israel is from Arab or Muslim countries: Iraq, Iran, Syria, Lebanon, Turkey, Egypt, Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia and Yemen. Known as Mizrahi (\"Eastern\") or Sephardi Jews, they arrived in Israel during various periods following its creation in 1948. Jews of Mizrahi origin were for many years the majority in Israel - until the arrival of just under a million migrants from the former Soviet bloc during the early 1990s reshuffled the ethnic pack. Mizrahis grew up in a Jewish society that was desperate to yoke to Europe and belittled the Arab world as an uncivilised cultural desert. The majority Mizrahis were assumed by the ruling European minority to be bearers of an inferior culture that should not come to represent or define the Jewish state. And, inevitably, many of those Mizrahi children internalised this story.\n\n\"Interviewing for my book, it was easy to understand the Mizrahis who described how they had spent childhoods faking their own identities - in a country that encouraged its Mizrahi population to ditch those \"backward\" oriental habits. One professor told me he'd badgered his father into changing the family surname to something that wasn't a telltale mark of Mizrahi origin, and now feels shame each time he visits his father's grave and sees the bogus name on the headstone. Another, of Moroccan origin, described how she invented a French persona for herself, forbidding her parents from speaking Arabic or playing oriental music. Others described how they erased their guttural oriental accent: vocals that are integral to Hebrew - a Semitic language, the sister of Arabic, but which Israel decided would be tonally \"wrong\" for the Jewish state. (I remember how I used to practise my English vowels until they lost the slightest foreign twang.) And these stories repeat so many times over in Israel - recollections of masked origins, buried roots, trashed biographies; blanded-out backgrounds.\n\n\"This wasn't uniformly the case. Countless Mizrahis retained their home culture in Israel, often in defiance and against the odds. When their Europeanised co-nationalists pronounced Mizrahi culture to be inferior, some just said: \"And who are you, exactly, to decide on that?\" Meanwhile, many of those Mizrahis who did sever roots are now trying to reconnect with those forsaken origins - reclaiming their real family names, reinstating the oriental vocals, rediscovering their home culture. Yair Dalal, a world-acclaimed Israeli musician of Iraqi origin, describes a realignment process that occurs when he sends his Mizrahi students home to practise a piece of oriental music. \"They come back a week later and say: 'My dad started to sing the song I was playing.' And that's the connection. That person is back on track.\"\n\nRead article in full\n\nThis thoughtful piece by Barbara Kay in The American Thinker was obviously timed to coincide with the Palestinian 'Nakba' anniversary on May 14th. I have set out my thoughts on their so-called 'right of return' here; I should add that Jews have been offered a 'right of return' to some Arab countries, but have spurned it. Who in their right mind would return to a country where their security is not assured and the population is basically hostile?\n\n\"The word \"Zionist\" is now a heavily freighted word, but what does it actually mean? Eminent sixth-generation Israeli writer A.B. Yehoshua says that in its essence it means nothing more than the law of return. It's not about love of Israel or a belief that Jews are in some way \"better\" than others. He pointed out that it would surprise many people to know that Israel is not the only country in the world with a right of return, although Israel's enemies like to give that impression. Hungary and Germany also have laws of return, and so do many others. Google \"right of return\" and check out the long, long list. Ethnicity lies at the heart of all of them, so in that sense Israel is a country like most others.\n\n\"Palestinians argue that since they were living on the land at the time of its elevation to statehood, they too have the right of return. Return to what? To a homeland or to lost property? For lost property does not constitute a homeland. Hundreds of thousands of Iraqi Jews lived in Baghdad for centuries, but when they were summarily ethnically cleansed in 1948 (those who were not murdered) without compensation for their homes, businesses or bank deposits, they didn't kid themselves that they'd lost a homeland. They were absorbed in their homeland, Israel, and are indistinguishable from other Israelis. The same would have been true of Palestinians if they had been absorbed into their ethnically appropriate enclaves — West Bankers to Jordan and Gazans to Egypt.(...)\n\n\"Palestinians who fled or were pushed from their homes in war must obviously be materially compensated, just as the descendants of the 900,000 ethnically cleansed Jews from Arab lands, absorbed by Israel, should be compensated (and never will be). If and when the Palestinians gain statehood for the West Bank and Gaza — and they'd have an excellent chance if they recognized Israel's right to exist and gave up plans for its extermination — they should by all means establish a law of return in their first and only politically sovereign domain.\n\n\"Just like most countries, including Israel.\"\n\nRead article in full\n\nThere are only two Jews listed on the electoral register in the Lebanese town of Sidon. But where are they? And if this report in the Beirut Daily Star is to be believed and the last Jew left Sidon in 1985, why are these Jews still entitled to vote?\n\nSIDON: Isaac Elijah Diwan and Jack Samantoubi Zeitouni are the only two Lebanese Jewish voters in the coastal city of Sidon for the June 7 parliamentary elections. Only the names of two Lebanese Jews are listed on the civil registry records in Sidon, though the city was home to a large Jewish community before the outbreak of Lebanon's Civil War in 1975. The port city's Jews were mainly concentrated in a neighborhood of the old downtown, known until today as the \"Jews Quarter.\"\n\nThe neighborhoods Jews fled to North America and Europe (and Israel - ed) and were replaced by residents from other religions.\n\nA large Hizbullah flag hangs from one of the balconies adjacent to the quarter's synagogue, which has become the residence of a family. Pictures of Hizbullah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah and others resistance figures are plastered on almost all the walls of the Jews' Quarter.\n\nOne of Sidon's long-time residents, Saeed Safadi, recalls that the relationship between the southern city's Jewish community and other confessions \"was based on mutual respect.\"\n\nHe points out that most of Sidon's Jews did not flee the city after Israel's creation in 1948, but rather abandoned the city in large groups from 1975 to 1978, during the early phases of the Civil War.\n\n\"The last Jew left Sidon in February 1985 as Israeli troops were withdrawing after the invasion of 1982,\" Safadi says.\n\nUnlike Jewish communities in other Middle Eastern countries, the Lebanese community largely remained and even grew in the aftermath of the 1948 Arab-Israeli war, and began emigrating during the civil wars of 1958 and 1975.\n\nAfter political stability collapsed in Lebanon, Jews flocked to places with existing Lebanese expatriate communities, such as Paris, New York, Montreal or Sao Paulo.\n\nDespite the 1948 war, the Jewish community grew to almost 9,000 by 1951, largely as a result of an influx of refugees from Iraq and Syria. Lebanon was the only Arab state that saw its Jewish community increase after the establishment of Israel.\n\nSafadi recalls that Sidon's Jewish community was mostly made up of tradesmen.\n\n\"Sidon's Jews were known to be rich and sharp and they had a habit of closing their quarter's gate at night,\" he says.\n\nWhile the Jewish community never played a decisive role during elections in Sidon, Safadi remembers, \"they always voted wisely and made sure not to upset all candidates.\"\n\n\"The Jews would split their votes between Sidon's two candidates for the elections so as not to upset any of them and receive services from both of them,\" Safadi says.\n\nRead article in full\n\nHabib Elghanian z''l\n\nThirty years ago this week, philanthropist Habib Elghanian became the first Jew executed by Iran’s radical Islamic regime after he was falsely charged and convicted of spying for Israel. Karmel Melamed interviews friends and relatives who recall the trauma of this event in the Jewish Journal of Los Angeles:\n\nHis death by firing squad on May 9, 1979, sent shockwaves through Iran’s tight-knit Jewish community, which once lived in relative peace under the Shah. It prompted scores of Iran’s nearly 80,000 Jews to immediately sell off or abandon their assets and flee the country.\n\nAt least 13 Jews have been executed in Iran since Elghanian.\n\nThis week, as local Iranian Jews commemorate Elghanian’s death, The Journal spoke with family members, close friends and community activists who knew him affectionately as Haji Habib, a 66-year-old industrialist and community leader.\n\n“My father wanted to return to Iran despite the turbulence there, even though we all implored him to stay in the U.S. He wanted to continue helping the Jewish community that had still remained in Iran and he also wanted to attend to his businesses there.\n\n“After he was arrested I remember going to Washington, D.C., with my uncle seeking help from politicians on behalf of my father. We met with Sen. Ted Kennedy and he expressed his support for us but said he was unable to really help us.\n\n“His own employees and people in the business community who were not Jewish even came out in protest after the government in Iran arrested him. Our family still remembers him and so does the community after so many years because of the tremendous impact he had on our lives.“\n\n—Karmel Elghanian, Habib Elghanian’s son\n\n“He was in America, and 10 to 15 days before Khomeini returned to Iran, he returned to Iran. Everyone asked him not to go, but he said ‘I was born in Iran and I love my country. I have treated Muslims and Jews alike, everyone knows me, and I have not done anything that was illegal.‘ Despite what people told him, Haji said, ‘Iran is my homeland, I love it and what is most important to me is that the Jews in Iran’s eyes are upon me. I, therefore, must be protective of them and if I leave they will be in danger.‘\n\n“Haji knew, in the end, that they were going to execute him. Through friends and family members we relayed messages to him while he was imprisoned and even offered to find a way to have him sprung from jail. He flatly refused these suggestions and said the lives of the Jews of Iran would be at risk if he had escaped from prison. He sacrificed his life for the good of [the] country’s Jews.\n\n“Before he was executed, he asked that he be given his tallit and kippah to wear and then be executed. He recited the ‘Shema Israel’ prayer and then they executed him.\n\n“The Iranian government repossessed every single penny we as members of the Elghanian family owned and passed laws that even the smallest belongings of the Elghanian family were to be seized by the regime. With force and great difficulty they got his body and buried him in the Jewish cemetery. When they buried him there were not more than two or four people, and there were not enough people to even say Kaddish for him because everyone was so frightened to come to the burial.\n\n—Sion Elghanian, Habib Elghanian’s brother\n\nRead article in full\n\nMichael R Fischbach, an academic writing in the Middle East Report (Fall 2008), argues that the newly-formed World Organisation of Jews from Iraq (WOJI) is controversial: it clashes with the interests of other Jewish organisations; it is not representative of Iraqi Jews in spite of its 120 General Assembly representatives (80 from Israel, 40 from the diaspora) ; it is on a collision course with American interests. Lastly, its Israeli-ness provokes antisemitism. Although his material is well-researched and detailed, Fischbach's conclusions are muddled and not a little tendentious. My comments in italics.\n\n\"On June 23, 2008, representatives of Iraqi Jewish communities in several countries met in London to form a new group, the World Organization of Jews from Iraq (WOJI). According to a press release issued shortly after the meeting, the purpose of WOJI was to “protect, preserve and promote Jewish communal assets remaining in Iraq and to protect, preserve and promote Iraqi Jewish heritage, including holy sites and shrines remaining in Iraq.”(..)\n\nFischbach downplays the persecution faced by the Jews of Iraq, seven of which remain today of 150,000. The Jews did not 'flee', they 'emigrated'. The 1941 Farhoud massacre is rationalised as 'attacks on Jews in the wake of the British invasion' . Mordechai ben Porat, a founder of WOJI, is portrayed as a rather dubious character engaged in cloak-and-dagger operations to smuggle Jewish artefacts out of Iraq. No mention of Ben-Porat is complete without the 'Zionist bombs' affair also being dredged up ( although, to be fair, Fischbach cites both pro- and anti- sources).\n\n\"Ben Porat took the first steps toward the formation of WOJI, and raised the issue of the fate of Jewish communal property in Iraq, in 2005. He and BJHC officials were likely influenced by the fierce intra-Jewish dispute over who should control the communal assets of the dwindling Jewish community in Egypt. In contention today are the hundred or so Jews still in Egypt and the various Egyptian Jewish heritage groups abroad, including the Historical Society of Jews from Egypt in New York, the World Congress of the Jews of Egypt in Israel and the Association Internationale Nebi Daniel in France.[2] No comparable group existed for Iraqi Jews, so Ben Porat and two other Iraqi Jews—former WOJAC Chairman Moshe Shahal and BJHC Deputy Chairman Aryeh Shemesh—arranged for meetings among Iraqi Jewish expatriates in Israel, New York and London to discuss the matter.[3] \"More controversial, however, is what another BJHC official, Zvi Gabay, claimed publicly: that WOJI intends to become “the official presentative of Jews of Iraqi origin in matters concerning the community as a whole” now that Jewish life in Iraq is virtually extinct.[4] Gabay stated that this will include submitting “an official claim to community property in Iraq,” a claim presumably to be made to the new Iraqi government.[5] According to Heskel Haddad, the Iraqi Jewish head of WOJAC’s office in New York, the plan is to sue the Iraqi government.[6] This could pit WOJI against a number of parties, not the least of which are the governments of Iraq and the United States, as well as other Jewish groups.\n\nThere is no evidence to suggest that WOJI will sue the government of Iraq.\n\n\"One of WOJI’s primary interests is control over and renovation of Iraqi Jewish communal properties, shrines and artifacts, both inside and outside Iraq. Ben Porat maintains that he and BJHC possess lists of Jewish communal real estate in Iraq, probably a reference to a report that he himself commissioned five decades ago while still operating as an underground Mossad agent in Iraq. In 1951, he arranged for three Iraqi Jews to conduct a survey of Jewish communal assets. Their March 1951 report detailed Jewish communal endowments (waqf) in Baghdad, and family endowments in al-Kifl, al-Hilla and al-Hindiyya. Among these properties were hospitals, cemeteries and synagogues. The report determined that the total value of these waqf holdings was 2,567,620 dinars or $10,347,508 (1 dinar was equal to $4.03 in 1951).[7]\"\n\nIslam has a history of appropriating Jewish sites: just because Muslims venerate a Jewish site does not give them a stake in its control. For instance, as early as the 19th century, there was a struggle for control at Ezekiel's tomb - a struggle which the Jews won until their mass exodus in 1950. Furthermore it is odd for Fischbach to claim that Chaldean Christians venerate the tomb of Nahum when this site has fallen into ruin.\n\n\"WOJI also intends to “salvage” and “repossess” moveable Jewish assets such as Torah scrolls and marriage registers.[8] Many Jewish religious artifacts remained in Iraq after the mass exodus of Jews in the early 1950s. Some were placed in museums; others were confiscated and warehoused by Iraqi security officials. After the fall of Baghdad in April 2003, a number of them disappeared. A number of Torah scrolls were stolen from the Iraq Museum in Baghdad in the looting after the US invasion. Some were later returned; others resurfaced in New York. The Shi‘i cleric Sa‘id Kamal al-Din al-Muqaddis al-Ruwayfi issued a call to Shi‘a to relinquish stolen museum goods; twenty-two scrolls and other manuscripts, plus dozens of other items, were subsequently returned to museum officials.[9] Saad Eskander, a Kurdish exile who returned to become director of the Iraq National Library and Archive, further managed to locate and collect a large number of Jewish books that Saddam’s regime had removed from synagogues.[10]\"\n\nFischbach appears to see the Jewish heritage of Iraq as belonging to Iraq and that any claim to recover it for the Iraqi Jewish community might alienate the Americans and the new Iraqi government. But American sources have argued that the Iraqi claim is not absolute and Iraqi Jews outside the country have a perfectly valid claim to their communal property.\n\n\"WOJI also seeks to gain control of the Jewish community’s marriage and death registers, as well as property lists maintained by the community’s office in Baghdad that continues to oversee the assets of the tiny Jewish community still living there. At the time of the US invasion, the office was staffed by Naji Diwaniyya, the acting rabbi of the Jewish community in Baghdad, along with representatives of Iraqi intelligence and the Ministry of Awqaf (the Arabic plural of waqf). Persons residing in properties still registered in the names of the original Jewish owners paid rent to the office.[11] By 2005, they were paying the rent to an elderly Jewish woman.[12]\n\n\" Ben Porat and the BJHC themselves possess other Jewish artifacts that they arranged to be smuggled out of Iraq in recent years. Ben Porat admitted in June 2008 that the BJHC paid approximately $25,000 for some 300 old Jewish books in Iraq, having dispatched an agent to purchase them from what he called “thieves.” After American occupation authorities, anxious to stem further smuggling of Iraqi cultural items, put a stop to the agent’s direct shipments to Israel, Ben Porat’s operative resorted to more shadowy methods to send the items to Israel.[14]\n\n\"Potentially even more controversially, WOJI has sought to claim a cache of Jewish books and documents that American occupation officials shipped out of Iraq to the United States. On May 6, 2003, US soldiers from the Army’s Mobile Exploration Team Alpha, along with members of the Iraqi National Congress (INC), descended into the flooded basement of the bombed-out Department of General Intelligence in Baghdad. (...) What they had found were the archives of two offices within the General Intelligence Department: the Israel-Palestine and Jewish Sections.[15]\n\n\"As they were not official government documents, the National Archives solicited private funds to aid in the process. Donors were hesitant to commit, however, because of the uncertain future of the manuscripts. The future of these religious artifacts thus remains in limbo. Doris Hamburg, the National Archives official who was overseeing their restoration, stated in late 2007 that the American government had taken the documents with “the expectation of the return of the materials to Iraq,”[17] but final arrangements for their repatriation have yet to be made.\n\n\"However legitimate WOJI’s campaign may be, making a public claim to Jewish communal assets is certain to stir up considerable opposition in Iraq. The fact that Israelis play a major role in WOJI will only add fuel to that fire. In fact, the prospect of Jewish property compensation and Jews buying up land in Iraq already has engendered a hostile reaction. Rumors of “foreign Jews” (presumably former Iraqi citizens) seeking to buy land were rife in Iraq in mid-2003. Sunni Muslim clerics in Mosul issued a fatwa in July 2003 forbidding the sale of real estate to non-Iraqis for fear it might end up in Jewish hands.[18]\n\n\"Exiled Shi‘i cleric Ayatollah Kazim al-Husayni al-Ha’iri issued a fatwa in June 2003 from Qom, Iran demanding death for any Jew seeking to buy land in Iraq.[19] And in late 2003 and early 2004, the Iraqi Turkmen Front claimed that Kurdish Jews in Israel were repurchasing their former properties with the help of the Kurdish Credit Bank.[20] The veracity of these reports aside, they indicate the depth of hostility to Jews seeking the restitution of properties abandoned long ago.\n\nOf all Fischbach's attempts to discredit WOJI this argument must be the lamest. Jews sticking up for their rights risk provoking antisemitism. So Jews had better not, and perhaps Arab hostility might go away. The involvement of Israelis in WOJI (even though 96 percent of Iraqi Jews went to Israel) is a particular red rag to a bull.\n\n\"The WOJI claim to the Jewish documents at the National Archives further puts the Americans in a quandary. Claimants to the artifacts could include WOJI, the few remaining Jews in Baghdad and the Iraqi government. Given high-profile international efforts to return Iraqi cultural heritage items plundered after the invasion, the US cannot avoid this quandary by maintaining possession of the items.\n\n\"Finally, WOJI’s efforts are controversial within Jewish circles as well, particularly as many Jews (Iraqi or otherwise) might not recognize WOJI as their representative. Moreover, WOJI’s claims collide with parallel property compensation and restitution efforts by other Iraqi Jewish groups. In September 2005, the Iraqi-Israeli lawyer David Nawi filed a suit with the Israeli High Court of Justice on behalf of the group Shemesh-Shalom ve Shilumin. The suit seeks to force the Israeli government to enter into compensation negotiations with the new Iraqi government.[22] Other Iraqi Jews, like WOJAC officials ‘Oved Ben ‘Ozer in Israel and Heskel Haddad in the United States, are similarly against WOJI’s efforts, believing that suing Iraq would only stir up anti-Semitic feeling.[23]\"\n\nThere is every reason to believe that Justice for Jews from Arab Countries (JJAC) supports WOJI. Indeed WOJI have publically acknowledged their help. JJAC's primary aim is recognition, not restitution, but nothing suggests that WOJI could 'fall foul' of JJAC. When all's said and done, the only people who really object to WOJI (and have been willing to talk to Fischbach) seem to be WOJAC, who are known to have fallen out with JJAC.\n\n\"Since its inception in New York in 2002, it (JJAC) has mounted a vigorous campaign to categorize all Jewish emigrants from the Arab world after 1948 as “refugees” whose fate, and property losses, should be linked to any diplomatic discussion about the 1948 Palestinian refugees. JJAC is supportive of Israel’s long-standing assertion that any Israeli obligation to the Palestinians should be connected to property losses sustained by Jewish emigrants from Arab countries. JJAC has argued that there was an irreversible Jewish-Arab population and property exchange during and after 1948. Insofar as former Jewish citizens of Arab states are not seeking a “right of return,” JJAC asserts, neither should the Palestinians demand a right of return to Israel.[24] The efforts of WOJI and other Arab Jewish groups seeking property compensation and restitution thus threaten Israel’s justification for not compensating Palestinians for their losses. On the other hand, WOJI’s efforts might strengthen JJAC’s claim of a population and property exchange by offering an example of Jews demanding property restitution from Arabs.\"\n\nSo perhaps WOJI is not that controversial after all?\n\nRead article in full\n\nAs a new monument is unveiled in Israel to victims of terrorism and hate crimes around the world, Moshe Hassan reflects in The Jerusalem Post on the father he never knew:\n\nMoshe Hassan's father knew the process of aliya inside and out.\n\n\"My father tried to come here from Tunis in 1946, but was caught by the British and sent to Cyprus,\" Hassan told The Jerusalem Post by telephone on Sunday. \"He was put in a camp there, and that's where he met my mother. They immigrated to Israel in 1948.\"\n\nThey settled in Beit Hagadi, a religious moshav next to Netivot, but the elder Hassan would spend little time in his new country. Asked by the Jewish Agency to help bring Moroccan Jews on aliya, Ya'acov Hassan returned to North Africa in the mid-1950s to begin work as an emissary for Israel.\n\n\"He knew the area well,\" Moshe said. \"By 1956 he was well-established in Morocco, going to far-flung places like the Atlas mountains, and beyond, and helping entire families come here. Sometimes, he was able to get hundreds of people out of Morocco a day.\"\n\nHis father would go to a synagogue on Shabbat, give a speech about Israel, and then ask people to sign up with him after Shabbat was over, Moshe said.\n\n\"Once they signed up, he would also teach them different agricultural techniques to prepare them for their aliya. He had a lot of success in Morocco - the communities there were very connected to the idea of coming to Eretz Yisrael, so many of them were anxious to come, and he assisted in thousands of cases of aliya.\"\n\nBut in 1958 - the same year that Moshe was born - King Muhammad V of Morocco joined the Arab League, and the aliya process became much more difficult. Around that time, the Jewish Agency decided to send Ya'acov to Algeria.\n\n\"You know, one gate was closing, so they looked to another one,\" Moshe said. \"But Algeria posed difficulties as well. The Algerian communities were more rooted; many of them declined to leave, or preferred to go to France, so my father had a more difficult time there.\"\n\nIn any case, Ya'acov was made manager of the entire aliya project in Algeria, and along with Rafael Ben-Gera, another agency worker, they continued with the work of bringing Jews to Israel.\n\n\"But Algeria was also different than Morocco in that it was unsafe,\" Moshe said. \"They knew it was dangerous, but they went anyway.\"\n\n\"Then, on February 17- we know this now - \"my father and Ben-Gera were kidnapped by members of the FLN [the Algerian National Liberation Front], who, while they were fighting the French occupation of Algeria, were also staunchly anti-Israel. They informed the [Israeli] government of the capture and the government even negotiated with them. At one point they offered to pay a $1 million ransom for them both, but the FLN was hard to deal with, they kept delaying the process until the government just lost contact with them.\"\n\n\"We still don't know exactly what my father did,\" Hassan said. \"We know it was probably something more than just aliya work, because he was recognized as a fallen intelligence officer by the army, but his files are closed - they pertain to activities conducted in an enemy country.\n\n\"We also know that they were murdered. The Red Cross told us that was the likely outcome after the negotiations fell apart, and the FLN later confirmed, in August of 1958, that they had been killed about six weeks earlier.\"\n\nRead article in full\n\nYoussef Gaon, the youngest 'Jew' in Egypt (Photo: The National)\n\nThe Emirates newspaper The National is the unlikely source of this portrait by Jack Shenker of Egypt's dying Jewish community, 'Bearers of a dimming torch'. Shenker interviews Paris-based Yves Fedida of Nebi Daniel, who is fighting, not for compensation, but for access to Egyptian Jews' historical records. The cracked headstones and marble tombs around him bear witness to people who first made this Egyptian city their home more than 2,300 years ago, and in their heyday numbered almost 80,000. Last summer, the final remnants of that vibrant community gathered here to bury their leader. So few of them were left that the Kaddish, a Jewish funeral blessing, could not be recited. The significance of that was obvious to all who attended; this once-cosmopolitan corner of the Arab world will soon entomb its final Jewish resident, and Mr Salaam (who tends the cemetery) will be left alone with the graves.\n\nThe death of Max Salama, 92, an Egyptian Jew who once served as King Farouk’s personal dentist, leaves 18 surviving Jews in what was once one of the religion’s greatest cultural capitals. The majority of those remaining are in their 70s or 80s and reside in old people’s homes, no longer interacting with the city they have always called home. At the tender age of 53, the new leader, Youssef Gaon, is now the youngest Jew in Alexandria by a considerable margin, and he is childless.\n\nThe overgrown El Shatby cemetery in Alexandria bears witness to a Egyptian Jewish community that once numbered almost 80,000. Earlier this year the community buried its leader here, leaving just 18 surviving Jews in the city. (Photo by Jason Larkin for The National)\n\n“What can I say?” he shrugs, as he gives a tour of a beautifully decorated but deserted synagogue in the old city centre.\n\nJews have been an integral part of Alexandria’s history ever since the port city was founded by Alexander the Great in 332BC. Their numbers have ebbed and flowed over the years but reached a zenith in the early 1900s, when Jews from across Europe and North Africa flocked there to escape persecution.\n\n“It was an immigrant community drawn from all corners of the world, especially the remnants of the old Ottoman Empire,” said Yves Fedida, an Egyptian Jew now living in France, whose grandparents emigrated to Egypt from Palestine at the turn of the century in search of work.\n\nThese were the rekindled glory days of Alexandria, an urbane melting pot of nationalities where poets, scientists and intellectuals mingled freely on the Corniche.\n\nEgyptian Jews lay at the heart of the city’s revival, with individuals such as the anti-colonial Egyptian nationalist Yaqub Sana and the prominent psychologist Jacques Hassoun becoming household names in the region. But after revolutionary fervour swept Gamal Abdel Nasser to power in 1952, the ancient city’s worldly reputation began to fade and subsequent hostilities with the newly founded state of Israel gradually eroded Alexandria’s Jewish population.\n\nMr Fedida’s parents were forced out in the first wave of expulsions, prompted by the outbreak of the Suez conflict. As Israeli tanks advanced on the Suez Canal, his father, previously the financial director of the national Egyptian Petroleum Company, was given 10 days to leave the country.\n\n“He had to take us away and start again in England with just 20 Egyptian pounds in his pocket,” remembers Mr Fedida, who now works for the Nebi Daniel Association, a French group that brings together Egyptian Jews from around the world.\n\nThe exodus of Alexandria’s Jews continued following wars with Israel in 1967 and 1973, and many of those who clung to their homeland were imprisoned by the Egyptian state, suspected of being Zionist spies. Today, the remaining Jews at the magnificent Italianate synagogue of Eliahou Hanabi are vastly outnumbered by policemen and officials from the Egyptian ministry of the interior, who pay for the site’s security.\n\n“We are in very good hands,” said Mr Gaon, anxious not to upset the fragile working relationship the surviving community has established with the Egyptian government. “Even after we have gone I know they will look after this place.”\n\nBut as the final echoes of Alexandria’s Jewish ancestry die out, a new battle is raging over their heritage. At stake is the set of religious and civil registers maintained by Egyptian Jewry under the Ottoman Empire, which devolved such record-keeping to its non-Muslim communities.\n\nMr Gaon and his elderly compatriots are the final custodians of these logbooks, which run to 60,000 pages detailing all the births, deaths and weddings of the community stretching back to the 1830s.\n\nThese documents are of vital importance to descendants of Alexandrian Jews such as Mr Fedida, as the Jewish faith requires individuals to prove their maternal Jewish bloodline in order to get married. The problem is that issuing such certification from Alexandria is increasingly burdensome for the small number of Jewish pensioners left and the process is often hampered by local bureaucracy. The Nebi Daniel Association is lobbying the Egyptian government to allow copies of the archives to be placed in a European institution where they could be more easily accessed, but so far their efforts have met with failure.\n\nThe reluctance of the current Egyptian regime to enable easy access to the documents springs from fears that the offspring of Alexandria’s Jews will use them to make financial compensation claims against the government for Jewish property confiscated under Nasser’s nationalisation programmes.\n\nThe issue is a sensitive one; last year an unspecified amount was paid by the state to the Jewish family who originally owned The Cecil, a luxury Alexandrian hotel immortalised in Lawrence Durrell’s novels The Alexandria Quartet and seized by the government in 1957. Earlier this summer, a planned Cairo conference of Jews hailing from Egypt was cancelled after local media questioned the intentions behind the event.\n\nAccording to Mr Fedida, however, fears of compensation demands are misguided.\n\n“We are absolutely not interested in financial claims,” he said. “Our generation are the children of those who really suffered from expulsion and imprisonment. Although our parents tried to reconstruct their lives elsewhere, we saw their grief and we need to do them justice by giving them back the identity that led to them being uprooted in the first place.”\n\nRegardless of the outcome of this tussle over the logbooks, the human element of this once grand community will soon be extinguished and there will be no more burials at Abdul Salaam’s overgrown cemetery.\n\nFor Mr Fedida though, who was born in Alexandria, optimism prevails that Jews might one day make a return to the city.\n\n“You never know; we lost it once before when the Byzantines kicked us out in 400AD,” he said. “I think it’s a wonderful city, and I long for it on a daily basis. But deep down I know I’m longing for a world that no longer exists.\"\n\nRead article in full\n\nThe first Jews to settle in Shanghai were Baghdadi merchants. But traces of all Jewish settlement are vanishing as the city develops dizzyingly fast. JTA reports on an Israeli photojournalist's race against the clock to salvage headstones from the Jewish cemeteries (with thanks: Pablo):\n\nSHANGHAI, China (JTA) -- In Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, Western philanthropists and volunteers are restoring dozens of historic Jewish cemeteries.\n\nBut in Shanghai, there are none to restore.\n\nThe four cemeteries that once served this city’s small but prosperous Jewish community disappeared in the late 1960s during China’s Cultural Revolution. The sites were paved over to build a factory, park, hotel and Muslim cemetery, their history forgotten.\n\nIsraeli photojournalist Dvir Bar-Gal is trying to change that.\n\nWhile the cemeteries may be gone, since 2001 Bar-Gal has made it his mission to track down as many of the original headstones as possible. He has located 85 and hopes to use them in a memorial to Shanghai’s Jewish past.\n\nThe project has kept Bar-Gal in Shanghai for more than seven years, and he is waiting for government permission to erect the memorial. The clock is ticking, he says.\n\n“In a few years, the area where I found these stones will be gone,” Bar-Gal told JTA. “The villages I first visited have been redeveloped and are now upscale residences.”\n\nShanghai, a major port that is now China’s largest city, has had three waves of Jewish immigration. The first began in 1845, when David Sassoon, an Iraqi Jew living in India, moved his family business to Shanghai, which was China’s first city to open to the West. He was joined by two other Baghdad Jews, Elly Kadoorie and Silas Hardoon, and as the community grew they built Shanghai’s fortunes and their own.\n\nRead article in full\n\nScion of a Jewish family from Algeria who sailed to Palestine in the 19th century, Yosef-Eliyahu Chelouche - pictured here with his wife and children - was perhaps the first peacenik. Through his writings and the founding of Hamagen, a group of Arabic-speaking Tel-Avivians aiming at coexistence, he tried to steer the Arabs of Palestine away from extremism until his death in 1934. Alas, in vain. Sarah Honig writes in The Jerusalem Post:\n\n\"In 1880, 10-year-old Yosef-Eliahu was lured out of Jaffa's winding alleyways by his father's Arab acquaintance and marched through the undulating shadeless wilderness beyond. It was a horrendous, almost impassable and seemingly interminable tract, without landmarks or signs of habitation. The kidnapped boy's feet kept sinking in the sand; he was thirsty, beaten and terrified. At night, however, salvation came to Yosef-Eliahu as a silhouetted figure on a donkey approached. It was Yisrael Simhon, guard of the Montefiore orange grove, near where the Azrieli Center currently dominates Tel Aviv's skyline.\n\n\"To his last day, despite decades of distinguished public service, Yosef-Eliahu was known as the \"abducted child.\" The barren expanse through which he was forcibly dragged now lies beneath bustling downtown east-central Tel Aviv, intersected by the country's busiest traffic arteries.\n\n\"His early trauma notwithstanding, Yosef-Eliahu tirelessly campaigned for coexistence. He was perhaps the first peacenik. In 1913, to counter already rife judeophobia and incendiary agitation in the Arab press, Yosef-Eliahu, along with other Arabic-speaking Tel Avivians, founded Hamagen (the shield), an organization dedicated to persuading Arabs that they and Jews share economic and cultural interests and can only improve each other's lot.\n\n\"Yosef-Eliahu published an Arabic-language daily in Jaffa, Saut el-Othmania(Voice of the Ottomans), and cultivated close contacts with leading local Arabs in the hope of stemming already-rampant hate mongering.\n\n\"The unprovoked five-day Jaffa-generated Arab riots of 1921, in which 49 Jews were massacred and more than 150 wounded, effectively brought down the curtain on Jaffa's Jewish community and boosted adjacent Tel Aviv as a separate, independent, viable, modern and thriving alternative entity. The carnage should have disheartened Yosef-Eliahu, but he wouldn't abandon his peace-quest.\n\n\"It seemed mission-impossible after Yom Kippur 1928, when notorious Jerusalem Mufti Haj Amin el-Husseini raised a shrill cry over a flimsy cloth partition positioned to segregate male and female worshipers at the Western Wall. The British lost no time in tearing down the offensive screen. Jewish opinion of all political shades was outraged.\n\n\"On October 6, 1928, Yosef-Eliahu published an article entitled \"To the Arabs,\" his last-ditch plea for sanity. \"You crudely disrupted and battered congregants who came to pour out their souls to their Father in Heaven at the place and date holiest to them,\" he wrote. \"Then you declared holy war against your victims, charging they assailed your holy shrines... You prepare for outright bloodbath and jihad against the infidel desecrators. What desecration?... How can such absurdity be allowed to foment religious hostilities between Jews and Muslims? My good brothers, you are manipulated by wily politicians... How can anyone begrudge Jews the pitiable remnant that is their Western Wall, the sole relic of the brokenhearted?\"\n\n\"But the mufti's disciples didn't heed Yosef-Eliahu. Their premeditated harassment grew increasingly violent, till trumped-up tales of Jewish takeover attempts at the Temple Mount sent Arabs rioting countrywide on August 23, 1929. The slaughter lasted an entire week.\n\nThe rampages began in Jerusalem, but the most notorious carnage took place in Hebron, where 67 men, women and children were hideously hacked to death in a homicidal frenzy. Hebron's centuries-old Jewish community was dispossessed. Smaller Jewish enclaves in Gaza, Jenin, Tulkarm and Nablus were likewise dislodged.\"\n\nRead article in full"
