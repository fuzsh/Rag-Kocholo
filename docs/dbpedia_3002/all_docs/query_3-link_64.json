        "text": "The perception that local City Section schools can’t compete with area Southern Section opponents was thrown out the window at the 15th annual War on the Floor boys’ basketball tournament as Sylmar and Chatsworth outlasted a strong field of challengers, before the Spartans prevailed 59-56 in Tuesday night’s final at Pierce College.\n\nMarquis Salmon – who attended Village Christian of Sun Valley last year – contributed 13 second-half points for Sylmar, including three free-throws in the final 11.2 seconds to seal the victory.\n\n“I can’t believe how fast this group came together,” said Sylmar coach Bort Escoto, who received 19 points and 11 rebounds from Alex Moreno.\n\n“We are going to get back on top.”\n\nSylmar led 56-51, before Jordan Rosales hit a 3-pointer and made two free throws to tie for Chatsworth, which made a surprising run to the final with five straight victories.\n\nDerrick Hector had 15 points and Terrell Funchess added 14 points for the Chancellors, who advanced to the final with a 74-54 semifinal win over rival El Camino Real of Woodland Hills.\n\nChatsworth received 17 points from Jason Monje, 14 points from Hector and Rosales, along with 11 points from Bryan Figueroa against ECR.\n\n“We are all trusting each other and playing well,” Hector said. “We just had great chemistry this tournament.”\n\nTemjae Singleton scored a game-high 31 points to lead ECR, but received little support from a young, inexperienced lineup looking to establish its own identity.\n\n“Our youth showed today,” ECR coach David Rebibo said. “We need to learn from this and get better.”\n\nCrespi of Encino appeared on its way to a spot in the final, but couldn’t protect a 12-point lead with nine minutes remaining in its semifinal game against Sylmar, resulting in a 59-51 setback.\n\nSylmar used a 17-0 run over a four-minute stretch to turn the tide. Chad Thomas had 17 points and seven assists and Kevin Ward added 17 points and seven rebounds in the win.\n\nMatt Mounier led Crespi with 25 points, including 14-for-14 at the free-throw line.\n\nChris Connelly and Kenny Stenhouse had 11 and 10 rebounds respectively for Crespi.\n\nLions coming together\n\nUsually during the summer, Oaks Christian of Westlake Village doesn’t have the services of many of its football players because of a demanding practice and passing league schedule.\n\nThings have changed since Andre Chevalier took over as head coach five weeks ago.\n\nBlair Holliday and Dillon van der Wal have been regulars at workouts and games, giving the Lions a more steady lineup.\n\nOaks Christian split a pair of pool-play games and split two silver bracket contests, defeating Calabasas and falling to Dorsey of Los Angeles.\n\n“The team is still learning a whole new system but we are playing pretty well,” Chevalier said. “We have a lot of work to do to get where we want to be next year.”\n\nOn to the next one\n\nAfter competing in the War on the Floor, Taft of Woodland Hills quickly transitioned to the Fairfax tournament, defeating Harvard-Westlake of Studio City 75-65 in its opener Tuesday."
