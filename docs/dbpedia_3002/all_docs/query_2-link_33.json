        "text": "What better time to announce Draftboard‚Äôs $4.1M funding round than under the shadow of attack drones and cruise missiles? ü§£ About 2 years ago I was sitting on my couch and had an idea to completely disrupt how companies hire. I sat on it for almost 6 months. Because I was afraid I‚Äôd actually have to go build it. Like lots of other people, I kept a list of startup ideas, even though I had zero desire to be a founder. When I consulted that list after leaving IAC, I confirmed what I thought: they all sucked. But when this new idea hit, it was different. Finally, after months of hesitating, I decided to explore it, however tentatively. I fleshed out the vision & opportunity in a 3-page essay - I needed to test if the logic withstood the rigor of actually writing it out. I asked a close friend (Shlomo Dalezman) about the technical feasibility of it. I sketched dozens of wireframes on a whiteboard. I found a great designer in South Africa to build out some super simple mockups and put together a 13-page deck. And then it was go time. 18 months later we‚Äôve got thousands of scouts referring candidates. We‚Äôve had 70 companies list their roles. We‚Äôve had almost $1M in referral bonuses posted. And we‚Äôre just getting started. But I wouldn‚Äôt be here with my incredible investors, and that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm thrilled to announce this round of funding. Taylor Greene knew within ten seconds that Twelve Below was all-in. Amanda Herson met me for coffee on a brisk fall day and I knew she & Founder Collective would be an incredible asset. David Stark & Ground Up Ventures are just as incredible as partners as I knew they would be, and deserve serious credit for getting me to - for the first time - seriously consider taking the founder leap. And Nico Berardi and Antonio Osio at ANIMO Ventures are avid - and active - supporters every day. Between them and the dozens of angels and friends & family, I and my amazing team count ourselves incredibly fortunate to get to build this vision out with all their support. The journey is long and arduous, but the goal is worth it. Onwards and upwards. Draftboard team: Steven Sosnick Dzmitry Shokel Dzmitry Shavel Estee Rebibo Mikalai Rudak Siarhei Rudak Yasmin Levin Sam Goldberg Alexey Kibrik #hiring #techcrunch #funding\n\nWe are excited to announce our lead investment in Draftboard, a recruitment marketplace for referral-based hiring. The premise of the platform is simple. More than 80% of companies offer referral bonuses for new hires, but they limit those bonuses only to their own employees. Draftboard wants to change that: employers can post their referral bonuses publicly for the world to see; any user can then join the platform as a ‚Äòscout‚Äô and refer quality candidates within their network in exchange for a referral bonus upon a successful hire. We think it is a win-win-win situation: companies can tap into a completely new pool of talent; scouts can act as ‚Äúheadhunters‚Äù by monetizing their network of friends and family for real rewards; and job-seekers can more easily find new employment opportunities. At Twelve Below, our belief is that recruiting, at its core, is about people, networks, and trust. That‚Äôs the premise behind Draftboard, and we couldn‚Äôt be more thrilled to partner with Zach Roseman, his team and our friends at ANIMO Ventures, Founder Collective and GroundUp as the company sets out to democratize recruiting for everyone.\n\nEvery day, I write a lot of cold emails and LinkedIn messages to acquire new clients for Hiretal. Some of them say yes Some of them say no. There's this founder who gave me a detailed explanation of his company situation on why it isn't the right time to reach out to him. I was surprised he took a lot of time to draft the reply and send it over. I asked him what made him write the response, and he said this: \"We are a start up too - going through the same challenges of additional revenue - i have to treat you the same way, i would like to be treated by prospects.\" It reminded me of a very important lesson by my teacher, GMCKS: 'Treat others as you want to be treated I receive a lot of NO's everyday, but this NO is truly special as it made me feel 10x better As a startup founder, did any of your prospect say NO and you felt special? Comment down\n\nAs we announce our recent fundraise, I would like to talk about one of the biggest pillars that make any startup work. Early customers! Any entrepreneur can attest to the fact that how difficult it is to fund early customers. Product doesn‚Äôt exist. Early customers can‚Äôt even visualize what the solution will look like. A lot of them just try out the product because of goodwill. And some people go beyond their way to give support to early startups. Even more than revenue, it‚Äôs this validation that a lot of times makes the founder go on in their journey. I would like to thank a few of Weekday‚Äôs early customers who just took a bet on us and hopefully we have not let them down. I was just going through our Airtable base (that's how we started off) and sorted by Created On and these names popped up. Abhishek Nayak One of the first customers we had who also was kind enough to give us a shout out to his network. Saurav Swaroop Gave us a lot of feedback which helped build a lot of our features Satjot \"SJ\" Sawhney Tried us when we didn't even have an iota of product. Thank you for trusting us üôè Ananda Bhyravan K N Gave us a shot when he was at Dgraph. Prathamesh Juvatkar I remember we used to manually connect him on email threads with prospective candidates and sometimes goofed up also but he was always so kind in ignoring those. Vedha Sayyaparaju and Bharath Varma We ran into a bunch of hiccups when we just started and Zuddl was so patient with all our inefficient processes Palash Soni Goldcast would be our oldest customer who we continue to work with even now. Support for us has not dipped even once. Surya Oruganti I have met so many people who have told me that they heard of Weekday through Surya. It's always a delight when people spread the word just out of the goodness of their hearts. Prateek Swain While I have not worked directly with Prateek but my cofounder always keeps on saying he is one of the best customers to work with. Harshvardhan Mandad He has tried out so many versions of our product that whenever we think of any new feature. We know that he would definitely be willing to give that a try. And it's always so reassuring to know that there are some customers you have like that. There have been so many others who have supported us as well. But if anyone in my network is looking for great places to work or be associated with them in any way. I would highly recommend them. Thank you so much üôè https://lnkd.in/gvRW4bT2\n\nHow it started: in the first five years of my career, I placed software engineers at 36 different NYC start-ups. My two best clients hired in the double digits and accounted for 36% of my total placement fees. 80% came from the top 16 companies. Twenty-one of the companies hired a single person from me. How it's going: for the last five years, my partner Ryan Brewer and I (Keen) have worked with just 8 companies. Two accounted for 70% of our revenue, three for 85%, and four for 90%. The other four hired a single person. I'm ecstatic because this is precisely what we set out to do. We despised the agency culture and were convinced that we could do more for our clients (and in turn, for ourselves) by aligning ourselves with just a few teams we believed in. We take great care of our candidates. That's a given. But our mission is specifically to help founders make necessary hires and (hopefully) increase a startup's likelihood of success. To wit, in five years, we've had a single competing offer among our clients. That gave us more heartburn than joy. Most agencies want multiple offers because their goal is to place a candidate and secure a commission. We're more interested in our teams successfully hiring the person we found for them and we prefer not to undermine that effort by introducing competition. This won't make sense to most agency recruiters, and I'm okay with that. It works for us. Founders: if you want someone in your corner, let's chat. We're looking for our next 2-3 long-term partners.\n\nLate last year we (Lottie) implemented the basics of our referral program. Now as we scale again, we‚Äôre exploring new ways to optimise and improve. So far it has led to a number of great hires, but my favourite has to be Eva + Robin. üëè It all started with the wonderful Eva Taylor-Jones, one of Lottie‚Äôs most loved employees. After a few drinks at the office she was chatting (loudly) about Lottie on her train ride home. Little did she know, Robin Hill (a total stranger) was eavesdropping. They got to chatting and Eva told Robin all about Lottie ‚û° Then on Monday morning Robin messages me, referencing the Lottie employee who told him about this fantastic company (but didn‚Äôt say her name). After some digging we realised it was Eva... Robin was hired and the rest is of course history. üíò While this serendipitous encounter was slightly unconventional, the 'regular' referral hire is such an important sourcing method, particularly for startups. They're easy to implement, cheap and often to lead to a better ‚ÄòQuality of Hire‚Äô. So, how can you make your referrals more effective? The basics ‚ñ∂ Create a referral bonus structure to share with the business. ‚ñ∂ Announce the program publicly providing key info on the process and where to find specific info about the open positions. ‚ñ∂ Build a (slack/teams) channel, where new roles can be announced. ‚ñ∂ Make it part of the onboarding process. A 6 week check in with the talent team to chat through any referral ideas. Some other ideas... ‚ñ∂ Referral Lunches. Order some food and invite your employees to join with their laptops. Ask them to run through LinkedIn connections and see if there‚Äôs any relevant referrals in their network. ‚ñ∂ Higher bonuses for niche roles. Its not something we've done at Lottie, but one I know a few startups do. Might be one to explore? Tips to implement ‚úî The downside to referrals is the negative impact they could have on DE&I. This is an issue prominent in start ups as they can perpetuate implicit biases and result in a lack of diversity. Make sure referred candidates go through the same (objective and inclusive) process and ensure interviewers are aware of any unconscious bias. ‚úî Employees often forget about the referral program. It needs to be front and centre. Remind people every week on slack and in your all hands. ‚úî Offer to help your employees write reach out messages and provide them with useful materials (such as decks, presentations and investor info). ‚úî Do the lunches but have a plan. Make sure to track the names employees reach out too so you can follow up and keep an eye on CX. I‚Äôd love to hear other ideas people have. We‚Äôre always looking to improve our referral strategy ‚¨á P.s - please excuse the graphic. I designed it all by myself... #referrals #sourcing #sourcingstrategy #inclusion"
