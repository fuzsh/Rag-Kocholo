This study aims to evaluate the effect of chronic oral nitrates on the clinical presentation and short-term outcomes of patients admitted with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). A retrospective cohort study was conducted in patients with ACS admitted to 62 acute care units from 2010 to 2011. A propensity score-matched samples analysis was performed. We analysed 3171 consecutive patients, of whom 298 (9.4%) were chronically treated with nitrates. Patients previously treated with nitrates had higher comorbidity and disease severity at admission, lower prevalence of ACS with ST elevation, lower troponin elevation, higher prevalence of initial Killip class 2-4 and higher hospital mortality. The propensity score-matched analysis confirmed that previous use of nitrates is independently associated with a lower prevalence of ST-elevation ACS [odds ratio (OR) 0.53, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.36-0.78; Pâ=â0.0014] and a lower troponin elevation (OR 0.61, 95% CI 0.41-0.92) but not with Killip class on admission (OR 1.18, 95% CI 0.83-1.67, Pâ=â0.3697) or mortality (OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.37-1.38, Pâ=â0.3196). The results support the hypothesis that nitrates have a protective effect on acute ischaemic injury.\n\nAlectinib salvages CNS relapses in ALK-positive lung cancer patients previously treated with crizotinib and ceritinib.\n\nPubMed\n\nGainor, Justin F; Sherman, Carol A; Willoughby, Kathryn; Logan, Jennifer; Kennedy, Elizabeth; Brastianos, Priscilla K; Chi, Andrew S; Shaw, Alice T\n\n2015-02-01\n\nLeptomeningeal metastases (LM) are an increasingly frequent and devastating complication of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-rearranged non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Currently, the optimal management of LM in ALK-positive patients remains poorly understood as these patients have been routinely excluded from clinical trials. We describe four ALK-positive patients with LM who were treated with the next-generation ALK inhibitor alectinib through single-patient, compassionate use protocols at two institutions. All patients had previously been treated with both FDA-approved ALK inhibitors--crizotinib and ceritinib. Patients received alectinib at a starting dose of 600 mg twice daily. Four ALK-positive NSCLC patients with symptomatic leptomeningeal disease were identified. Three of four patients experienced significant clinical and radiographic improvements in LM upon treatment with alectinib. A fourth patient had stable intracranial disease for 4 months before eventual systemic disease progression. Overall, alectinib was well tolerated. One patient required dose reduction due to grade 2 hyperbilirubinemia. Alectinib is active in ALK-rearranged NSCLC patients with LM, including in patients previously treated with crizotinib and ceritinib. Additional prospective studies of alectinib in ALK-positive patients with LM are warranted.\n\nAlectinib Salvages CNS Relapses in ALK-Positive Lung Cancer Patients Previously Treated with Crizotinib and Ceritinib\n\nPubMed Central\n\nGainor, Justin F.; Sherman, Carol A.; Willoughby, Kathryn; Logan, Jennifer; Kennedy, Elizabeth; Brastianos, Priscilla K.; Chi, Andrew S.; Shaw, Alice T.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nBackground Leptomeningeal metastases (LM) are an increasingly frequent and devastating complication of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-rearranged non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

Since the combination of etoposide with an alkylating agent produces a synergistic and tolerable activity in various malignancies, in the present study, ifosfamide and etoposide were administered to patients with advanced breast cancer to evaluate the response characteristics and the toxicity profile. The combination of ifosfamide, mesna and etoposide was prospectively administered to 41 previously treated patients with stage IV breast carcinoma. The treatment schedule consisted of ifosfamide, 1500 mg/m2, infused over 24 hrs with 1500 mg/m2 mesna on days 1 to 5 and 120 mg/m2 etoposide, infused over 1 hr on days 1 to 3, to be repeated every 4th week. After a median follow-up of 10 months, an objective response rate of 23% (overall 2.5% complete remission and 20.5% partial remission) and a median response duration of 5.3 months were obtained in 39 assessable patients. The non-responder group consisted of 28.3% stable disease and 48.7% progressive disease. The prior status of chemotherapy was the only significant prognostic factor with an impact on the response rate. The overall toxicity was generally mild, with grade 3 myelotoxicity encountered in 25.7% of patients. The tolerable side effect profile of the ifosfamide and etoposide combination might be advantageous as regards the quality of life. To improve the rate and/or the duration of response and to clarify the precise role of the ifosfamide-etoposide combination in previously treated advanced breast cancer, further trials are warranted.\n\nVenetoclax in Patients with Previously Treated Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia.\n\nPubMed\n\nRoberts, Andrew W; Stilgenbauer, Stephan; Seymour, John F; Huang, David C S\n\n2017-08-15\n\nVenetoclax is the first BCL2 inhibitor to enter routine clinical practice. It is an orally bioavailable small molecule that binds BCL2 very specifically. Acting as a pharmacologic mimic of the proteins that initiate apoptosis (a so-called BH3 mimetic), venetoclax rapidly induces apoptosis in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells, which express high levels of BCL2 and rely on it to maintain their survival. As a single agent, daily venetoclax treatment induced durable responses in 79% of patients with relapsed or refractory CLL or small lymphocytic lymphoma in a phase I study, including complete remissions in 20% of patients. Its use was approved by the FDA in April 2016 for patients with previously treated del(17p) CLL on the basis of a single-arm phase II trial demonstrating a 79% response rate and an estimated 1-year progression-free survival of 72% with 400 mg/day continuous therapy. This review focuses on venetoclax, its mechanism of action, pharmacology, and clinical trial data and seeks to place it in the context of rapid advances in therapy for patients with relapsed CLL, especially those with del(17p) CLL.

However, the efficacy of nivolumab and other agents in melanoma remains limited. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of retreatment with nivolumab in metastatic melanoma patients who previously progressed on nivolumab. A retrospective review was performed on eight consecutive metastatic melanoma patients retreated with nivolumab who progressed on previous nivolumab. These patients received nivolumab 2Â mg/kg every 3Â weeks. Best responses to each treatment were assessed using RECIST 1.1. Of eight metastatic melanoma patients, three patients received chemotherapy before first nivolumab. The median first nivolumab treatment period was 4.1 months. During first nivolumab, 3 (37.5%) patients achieved a partial response and 3 (37.5%) patients achieved stable disease as their best response. First nivolumab was discontinued due to disease progression in seven patients and grade 3 colitis in 1 patient. Patients were subsequently treated with ipilimumab (nâ=â6), vemurafenib (nâ=â1), or no other medical treatment (nâ=â1). The median treatment period between first and second nivolumab was 3.0Â months. Four patients received radiation therapy between first and second nivolumab. The median second nivolumab treatment period was 4.3 months. Among the eight patients who received second nivolumab, 2 (25%) patients achieved a partial response and 3 (37.5%) patients achieved stable disease as their best response. Second nivolumab was discontinued due to disease progression in seven patients. One patient continues to receive second nivolumab. Among the four patients treated with ipilimumab and radiotherapy between first and second nivolumab, the response rate was 50% and the disease control rate was 75%. This study showed that retreatment with nivolumab is an option for select metastatic melanoma\n\nQualiCOP: real-world effectiveness, tolerability, and quality of life in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis treated with glatiramer acetate, treatment-naÃ¯ve patients, and previously treated patients.\n\nPubMed\n\nZiemssen, Tjalf; Calabrese, Pasquale; Penner, Iris-Katharina; Apfel, Rainer\n\n2016-04-01\n\nTreatment of symptoms and signs beyond the expanded disability status scale remains a major target in multiple sclerosis. QualiCOP was an observational, non-interventional, open-label study conducted at 170 sites in Germany. Of the 754 enrolled patients, 96 % had relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS) and were either disease-modifying therapy naÃ¯ve (de novo, n = 481) or previously treated (n = 237) with once-daily, subcutaneous 20-mg/mL glatiramer acetate (GA). Assessments of relapse rate, disease progression, overall functioning, quality of life (QoL), cognition, fatigue, and depression were performed over 24 months. GA treatment over 24 months was associated with reduced annual relapse rate for previously treated (from 0.98 to 0.54 relapses) and de novo (from 0.81 to 0.48 relapses) patients. Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite scores showed slight improvement in both cohorts (all p < 0.01). Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test and Multiple Sclerosis Inventory Cognition scale scores showed robust improvement in cognition among previously treated and de novo cohorts (all p < 0.001). General Depression Scale scores showed significantly reduced depressive symptoms (p < 0.001). Disease severity, fatigue, and QoL were stable over the observational period. These real-world findings suggest that patients with MS show benefit from GA treatment in important QoL parameters beyond standard measures of relapse and disease severity.\n\nAnalgesic Effect of Botulinum Toxin A in Myofascial Pain Syndrome Patients Previously Treated with Local Infiltration of Anesthetic and Steroids.\n\nPubMed\n\nCartagena-Sevilla, JoaquÃ­n; GarcÃ­a-FernÃ¡ndez, MarÃ­a R; Vicente-Villena, Juan P\n\n2016-12-01\n\nThe purpose of this study was to evaluate the analgesic effect of botulinum toxin A (BoNTA) injections in patients with myofascial pain syndrome (MPS) who were previously treated with the local infiltration of anesthetic and steroids (LIAS). The study included a retrospective phase and a longitudinal open-label prospective phase, which were conducted on consecutive patients with MPS previously treated with the local infiltration of anesthetic (levobupivacaÃ­ne 0.25%) and steroids (triamcinolone 40 mg). Eligible patients were treated with a single intramuscular injection of BoNTA (Botox; Allergan, Inc., Irvine, CA). The treatment efficacy was determined according to the degree of pain relief obtained. Eighty-two patients met the inclusion/exclusion criteria and were included in the study. Successful results were obtained for 32 (39.0%) and 30 (36.6%) patients, during treatment with BoNTA and LIAS, respectively. The mean (standard deviation) length of the analgesic effect was significantly longer with BoNTA (29.6 [SD = 17.7] weeks) than with LIAS (8.5 [SD = 6.4] weeks), P <.0001. As regards the side effects, 19 (23.2%) patients reported transient soreness at the injection site for 2 to 3Â days with BoNTA. The MPS patients previously treated with a local infiltration of anesthetic and steroids who then received a single injection of BoNTA experienced significantly reduced pain for a relatively long time.\n\nAbobotulinumtoxinA Efficacy and Safety in Children With Equinus Foot Previously Treated With Botulinum Toxin.\n\nPubMed\n\nDabrowski, Edward; Bonikowski, Marcin; Gormley, Mark; Volteau, Magali; Picaut, Philippe; Delgado, Mauricio R\n\n2018-05-01\n\nThe effects of botulinum toxin are transient, and repeat injections are required in children with lower-limb spasticity. However, the efficacy of botulinum toxin in patients who have received previous injections has remained largely unexplored. We present subgroup analyses of a phase III study conducted in ambulatory children (aged two to 17) with spastic equinus foot. Patients were randomized to single doses of abobotulinumtoxinA 10Â U/kg/leg, 15Â U/kg/leg, or placebo injected into the gastrocnemius-soleus complex (one or both legs). The first analysis was prespecified to review the effect of abobotulinumtoxinA in children previously treated with botulinum toxin versus those children new to the treatment; a second post hoc analysis evaluated the effect of abobotulinumtoxinA in children who changed botulinum toxin formulation. Of the 241 randomized patients, 113 had previously received botulinum toxin, including 86 who had been treated with another formulation. In both analyses, muscle tone (Modified Ashworth Scale) and the Physicians Global Assessment, at week 4, improved with abobotulinumtoxinA treatment versus placebo, regardless of baseline botulinum toxin status. Placebo responses in patients new to treatment were consistently higher than in the previously treated group. These results demonstrate similar abobotulinumtoxinA efficacy and safety profiles in children with spasticity who are new to botulinum toxin treatment and those children who were previously treated. The efficacy and safety of abobotulinumtoxinA treatment in these previously treated patients were comparable with the overall trial population, indicating that doses of 10 and 15Â U/kg/leg are suitable starting doses for children with spasticity regardless of the previous botulinum toxin preparation used.

We aimed to investigate the frequency and pattern of drug resistance among previously treated patients with smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis at the Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital Chest Clinic, Accra. This was a cross-sectional survey of mycobacterial isolates from previously treated patients referred to the Chest Clinic Laboratory between October 2010 and October 2013. The Bactec MGIT 960 system for mycobactrerial culture and drug sensitivity testing (DST) was used for sputum culture of AFB smear-positive patients with relapse, treatment failure, failure of smear conversion, or default. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize patient characteristics, and frequency and patterns of drug resistance. A total of 112 isolates were studied out of 155 from previously treated patients. Twenty contaminated (12.9%) and 23 non-viable isolates (14.8%) were excluded. Of the 112 studied isolates, 53 (47.3%) were pan-sensitive to all first-line drugs tested Any resistance (mono and poly resistance) to isoniazid was found in 44 isolates (39.3%) and any resistance to streptomycin in 43 (38.4%). Thirty-one (27.7%) were MDR-TB. Eleven (35.5%) out of 31 MDR-TB isolates were pre-XDR. MDR-TB isolates were more likely than non-MDR isolates to have streptomycin and ethambutol resistance. The main findings of this study were the high prevalence of MDR-TB and streptomycin resistance among previously treated TB patients, as well as a high prevalence of pre-XDR-TB among the MDR-TB patients, which suggest that first-line and second-line DST is essential to aid the design of effective regimens for these groups of patients in Ghana.\n\nMeta-Analysis of Cognitive Functioning in Breast Cancer Survivors Previously Treated With Standard-Dose Chemotherapy\n\nPubMed Central\n\nJim, Heather S.L.; Phillips, Kristin M.; Chait, Sari; Anne Faul, Leigh; Popa, Mihaela A.; Lee, Yun-Hsiang; Hussin, Mallory G.; Jacobsen, Paul B.; Small, Brent J.\n\n2012-01-01\n\nPurpose Evidence is mixed regarding long-term cognitive deficits in patients treated with chemotherapy. Previous meta-analyses have not focused specifically on the postchemotherapy period and have not incorporated several recent studies. The goal of the current study was to conduct a meta-analysis of cognitive functioning in breast cancer survivors who were treated with chemotherapy â¥ 6 months previously. Methods A search of PubMed, PsycInfo, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and Cochrane Library yielded 2,751 abstracts, which were independently evaluated by pairs of raters. Meta-analysis was conducted on 17 studies of 807 patients previously treated with standard-dose chemotherapy for breast cancer. Neuropsychological tests were categorized according to eight cognitive domains: attention, executive functioning, information processing, motor speed, verbal ability, verbal memory, visual memory, and visuospatial ability. Results Deficits in cognitive functioning were observed in patients treated with chemotherapy relative to controls or prechemotherapy baseline in the domains of verbal ability (g = â0.19; P < .01) and visuospatial ability (g = â0.27; P < .01). Patients treated with chemotherapy performed worse than noncancer controls in verbal ability and worse than patients treated without chemotherapy in visuospatial ability (both P < .01). Age, education, time since treatment, and endocrine therapy did not moderate observed cognitive deficits in verbal ability or visuospatial ability (all P â¥ .51). Conclusion Results indicate that, on average, observed cognitive deficits in patients with breast cancer previously treated with chemotherapy are small in magnitude and limited to the domains of verbal ability and visuospatial ability. This information can be used to inform interventions to educate patients with breast cancer regarding the long-term impact of chemotherapy on cognitive functioning.

The number of times each had received previous chemotherapy treatment ranged from 1 to 5 (median 3) for durations of 2.5 to 52.8 (median 11.7) months. At the time, L-OHP was not yet approved for sale in Japan, and could only be imported from overseas for personal use. As this made it very expensive,we used a low L-OHP dose of 100 mg/body. Combinations with 5-FU were administered differently from previous regimens; these included chronotherapy, weekly high-dose, FOLFOX 4, and FOLFOX 6. L-OHP was administered from 1 to 14 times (median 4.5), and the response to treatment was PR in 2 patients and NC in 5. The response rate was 22.2%. Although in NC there was a tendency toward tumor reduction in 2 of the 5 patients, the treatment had to be suspended because of their financial situations. Overall survival from commencement of the first treatment was 3.1 to 58.7 months (median 17.6+) and after starting L-OHP was 0.6 to 17.2 months (median 6.4+). Adverse events included bone marrow suppression in three patients, 3 cases of leukocytopenia (grade 3 in two patients and grade 4 in one), grade 4 thrombocytopenia in one patient,grade 3 sensory disturbance in one patient,and grade 3 anorexia in two patients. All reactions were able to be controlled except for one patient with Grade 4 thrombocytopenia. In summary,treatment with L-OHP as salvage chemotherapy can possibly contribute to prolongation of survival time in cases of refractory advanced colorectal cancer. It is useful to combine L-OHP with high-dose continuous administration of 5-FU,namely FOLFOX regimens.FOLFOX 6 is the most useful of the FOLFOX regimens because it is simple and can be administered on an outpatient basis.\n\nComparison of single agent versus combined chemotherapy in previously treated patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma: a meta-analysis.\n\nPubMed\n\nWu, Xiao-Jun; Zhi, Yi; He, Peng; Zhou, Xiao-Zhou; Zheng, Ji; Chen, Zhi-Wen; Zhou, Zhan-Song\n\n2016-01-01\n\nPlatinum-based chemotherapy is the standard treatment for advanced urothelial cancer (UC) and is generally used in the first-line setting. However, the optimal salvage treatment for previously treated UC patients is unclear. We conducted a systematic review of published clinical trials of single agent versus combined chemotherapy as salvage treatment in previously treated UC patients. Trials published between 1994 and 2015 were identified by an electronic search of public databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane library). All relevant studies were independently identified by two authors for inclusion. Demographic data, treatment regimens, objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), median progression-free and overall survival (PFS, OS), and grade 3/4 toxicities were extracted and analyzed using Comprehensive Meta Analysis software (Version 2.0). Fifty cohorts with 1,685 patients were included for analysis: 814 patients were treated with single agent chemotherapy and 871 with combined chemotherapy. Pooled OS was significantly higher at 1 year for combined chemotherapy than for single agent (relative risk [RR] 1.52; 95% CI: 1.01-2.37; P=0.03) but not for 2-year OS (RR 1.31; 95% CI: 0.92-1.85; P=0.064). Additionally, combined chemotherapy significantly improved ORR (RR 2.25; 95% CI: 1.60-3.18; P<0.001) and DCR (RR 1.12; 95% CI: 1.01-1.25, P=0.033) compared to single agent for advanced UC patients. As for grade 3 and 4 toxicities, more frequencies of leukopenia and thrombocytopenia were observed in the combined chemotherapy than in single agent group, while equivalent frequencies of anemia, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea were found between the two groups. In comparison with single agent alone, combined chemotherapy as salvage treatment for advanced UC patients significantly improved ORR, DCR, and 1-year OS, but not 2-year OS. Our findings support the need to compare combined chemotherapy with single agent alone in the salvage setting in large prospective\n\nA lower starting dose of eltrombopag is efficacious in Japanese patients with previously treated chronic immune thrombocytopenia.\n\nPubMed\n\nTomiyama, Y; Miyakawa, Y; Okamoto, S; Katsutani, S; Kimura, A; Okoshi, Y; Ninomiya, H; Kosugi, H; Nomura, S; Ozaki, K; Ikeda, Y; Hattori, T; Katsura, K; Kanakura, Y\n\n2012-05-01\n\nEltrombopag is an oral, non-peptide thrombopoietin receptor agonist that has shown efficacy and safety in chronic immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). However, ethnic differences in eltrombopag exposure have been reported: area under the curve exposure to eltrombopag was 87% greater among ITP patients of East Asian descent than among ITP patients of non-East Asian ITP descent. To evaluate the efficacy and safety of eltrombopag by using, in Japanese ITP patients, lower starting (12.5 mg) and maximum (50 mg) doses of eltrombopag than the standard starting (50 mg) and maximum (75 mg) doses approved in the USA and Europe. We examined 23 Japanese patients with previously treated chronic ITP with a platelet count of < 30,000 Î¼L(-1) in a multicenter study comprising a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase for 6-week evaluation (15 eltrombopag, and eight placebo) and an open-label phase for 6-month evaluation (23 eltrombopag). The response rate (platelet count of â¥ 50,000 Î¼L(-1) ) at week 6 of the 6-week double-blind phase was 60% in eltrombopag-treated patients and 0% in placebo-treated patients. Ten of 23 patients (43.5%) responded for â¥ 75% of predefined assessment visits during the 6-month open-label phase. Notably, 22% (5/23) of patients responded to 12.5 mg of eltrombopag, which was administered within the first 3 weeks of eltrombopag treatment. Bleeding decreased with eltrombopag treatment as compared with baseline. Eltrombopag was generally well tolerated; one patient experienced a transient ischemic attack on day 9. Eltrombopag (12.5-50 mg) is effective for the management of Japanese patients with chronic ITP (NCT00540423).

This open-label, phase 4 study evaluated the safety and efficacy of CCH for the retreatment of recurrent contractures in joints that were previously effectively treated with CCH. Patients participating in a long-term follow-up study who had contracture recurrence (increased â¥ 20Â° with a palpable cord) after successful treatment in the previous study were eligible. Recurrent joint contractures were treated with up to 3 CCH injections (â¼ 1 month apart). Patients were followed for 1 year to evaluate safety. Assessments included change in joint contracture, range of motion, and the percentage of joints that achieved contracture of 5Â° or less at day 30 after the last injection. The efficacy analysis included 51 patients with 1 treated joint per patient (31 metacarpophalangeal, 20 proximal interphalangeal). A total of 35 joints (69%) received 1 injection, 12 (24%) received 2 injections, and 4 (8%) received 3 injections. Fifty-seven percent of joints achieved contracture of 5Â° or less (29 of 51). Overall, 86% (43 of 50) patients had a 20Â° or greater increase in range of motion. The adverse event profile was consistent with previous studies. One ligament injury was reported. At a short-term follow-up of 1 year, recurrent contracture in joints previously successfully treated with CCH may be effectively retreated with up to 3 injections of CCH. Therapeutic IV.

We conducted two phase 3 trials involving patients who had been previously treated with a DAA-containing regimen. In POLARIS-1, patients with HCV genotype 1 infection who had previously received a regimen containing an NS5A inhibitor were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either the nucleotide polymerase inhibitor sofosbuvir, the NS5A inhibitor velpatasvir, and the protease inhibitor voxilaprevir (150 patients) or matching placebo (150 patients) once daily for 12 weeks. Patients who were infected with HCV of other genotypes (114 patients) were enrolled in the sofosbuvir-velpatasvir-voxilaprevir group. In POLARIS-4, patients with HCV genotype 1, 2, or 3 infection who had previously received a DAA regimen but not an NS5A inhibitor were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive sofosbuvir-velpatasvir-voxilaprevir (163 patients) or sofosbuvir-velpatasvir (151 patients) for 12 weeks. An additional 19 patients with HCV genotype 4 infection were enrolled in the sofosbuvir-velpatasvir-voxilaprevir group. In the three active-treatment groups, 46% of the patients had compensated cirrhosis. In POLARIS-1, the rate of sustained virologic response was 96% with sofosbuvir-velpatasvir-voxilaprevir, as compared with 0% with placebo. In POLARIS-4, the rate of response was 98% with sofosbuvir-velpatasvir-voxilaprevir and 90% with sofosbuvir-velpatasvir. The most common adverse events were headache, fatigue, diarrhea, and nausea. In the active-treatment groups in both trials, the percentage of patients who discontinued treatment owing to adverse events was 1% or lower. Sofosbuvir-velpatasvir-voxilaprevir taken for 12 weeks provided high rates of sustained virologic response among patients across HCV genotypes in whom treatment with a DAA regimen\n\nRetreatment with pembrolizumab in advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients previously treated with nivolumab: emerging reports of 12 cases.\n\nPubMed\n\nFujita, Kohei; Uchida, Naohiro; Kanai, Osamu; Okamura, Misato; Nakatani, Koichi; Mio, Tadashi\n\n2018-04-19\n\nAfter approval of anti-programmed cell death (PD)-1 antibodies, treatment for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has drastically changed. However, even in patients with favorable effects, therapeutic efficacy does not last long. Recently, retreatment with anti-PD-1 antibody has received attention. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of retreatment with pembrolizumab in NSCLC patients previously treated with nivolumab. We retrospectively reviewed NSCLC patients retreated with pembrolizumab who were previously treated with nivolumab. We collected the following data: patient characteristics, number of cycles of nivolumab and pembrolizumab, treatment interval between nivolumab and pembrolizumab, best response, and immune-related adverse events. Twelve patients were reviewed. The median number of cycles of nivolumab was 12.5 (range 2-32 cycles). Seven patients (58.3%) achieved a partial response (PR) and two patients (16.7%) achieved stable disease (SD). Eight patients (66.7%) received cytotoxic chemotherapy between nivolumab and pembrolizumab. The median number of cycles of chemotherapy treatment was 4 (range 1-9 cycles). The median number of cycles of pembrolizumab was 3.5 (range 1-17 cycles). One patient (8.3%) achieved PR and four patients (33.3%) achieved SD as their best response to pembrolizumab. All patients showing response to pembrolizumab had very high (â¥â80%) tumor PD-Ligand 1 expression. This study suggested that retreatment with anti-PD-1 antibody is a reasonable option for selected NSCLC patients.\n\nA Flexible-Dose Study of Paliperidone ER in Patients With Nonacute Schizophrenia Previously Treated Unsuccessfully With Oral Olanzapine\n\nPubMed Central\n\nKOTLER, MOSHE; DILBAZ, NESRIN; ROSA, FERNANDA; PATERAKIS, PERIKLIS; MILANOVA, VIHRA; SMULEVICH, ANATOLY B.; LAHAYE, MARJOLEIN\n\n2016-01-01\n\nObjective: The goal of this study was to explore the tolerability, safety, and treatment response of switching from oral olanzapine to paliperidone extended release (ER). Methods: Adult patients with nonacute schizophrenia who had been treated unsuccessfully with oral olanzapine were switched to flexible doses of paliperidone ER (3 to 12âmg/d). The primary efficacy outcome was a â¥20% improvement in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total scores from baseline to endpoint for patients who switched medications because of lack of efficacy with olanzapine and noninferiority versus previous olanzapine treatment (mean endpoint change in PANSS total scores vs. baseline of â¤5 points) for patients who switched for reasons other than lack of efficacy. Safety and tolerability were assessed by monitoring adverse events, extrapyramidal symptoms, and weight change. Results: Of 396 patients, 65.2% were men, mean age was 40.0Â±12.0 years, and 75.5% had paranoid schizophrenia. Among the patients whose main reason for switching was lack of efficacy, an improvement in the PANSS total score of â¥20% occurred in 57.4% of patients. Noninferiority was confirmed for each subgroup of patients whose main reason for switching was something other than lack of efficacy. Paliperidone ER was generally well tolerated. Extrapyramidal symptoms as measured by total Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale scores showed statistically significant and clinically relevant improvements at endpoint, the average weight decreased by 0.8Â±5.2âkg at endpoint, and a clinically relevant weight gain of â¥7% occurred in 8.0% of patients. Conclusion: Paliperidone ER flexibly-dosed over 6 months was well tolerated and associated with a meaningful clinical response in patients with nonacute schizophrenia who had previously been unsuccessfully treated with oral olanzapine.

It is unknown if intermittent interruption of ibrutinib therapy contributes to altered clinical outcomes. We therefore evaluated the effect of ibrutinib dose adherence on patient outcomes in the phase 3 RESONATE trial. The overall mean dose intensity (DI) was 95% with median treatment duration of â¼9 months. Pharmacokinetic assessment of ibrutinib exposure at 420-mg dose suggested similar exposure regardless of patient weight or age. As assessed by independent review committee, patients with higher DI experienced longer median progression-free survival (PFS) compared with those with lower DI regardless of del17p and/or TP53 status. Of 79 patients requiring a drug hold, treatment was restarted at the original dose in 73 (92%) patients. Mean duration of a missed-dose event was 18.7 days (range, 8-56). Patients missing â¥8 consecutive days of ibrutinib had a shorter median PFS vs those missing <8 days (10.9 months vs not reached). These results support sustained adherence to once-daily ibrutinib dosing at 420 mg as clinically feasible to achieve optimal outcomes in patients with previously treated CLL. The trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT01578707.

However, little is known regarding its performance in real-world (i.e., non-trial) settings. Furthermore, nivolumab efficacy is unknown in patients who are ineligible for clinical trials or who are categorized into small subgroups in such trials. We conducted a 15-center, observational, retrospective cohort study of patients with advanced NSCLC who received nivolumab monotherapy between January and December 2016. Of 613 patients included in our study, 141 had poor performance status (PS) and 106 were EGFR mutation - or ALK rearrangement-positive. The response and disease control rates were 20% and 44%, respectively; the estimated 1-year progression-free survival (PFS) was 18%. Multivariate analysis identified never smoking, poor PS, and EGFR mutation/ALK rearrangement as independent negative predictors of PFS. The most frequently reported grade â¥3 adverse event was pneumonitis (5% of patients). Severe pneumonitis (grade â¥3) occurred significantly earlier than mild pneumonitis (1.6 vs. 2.3 months, Pâ¯=â¯0.031). Patients with pneumonitis achieved higher response rates and longer PFS than those without (37% vs. 18%, and 5.8 vs. 2.1 months, respectively; Pâ¯=â¯0.002). Smoking status, PS, and EGFR mutation/ALK rearrangement were independent predictors of PFS. Our study elucidated nivolumab's efficacy in previously underreported patient populations; i.e., those with poor PS and/or with driver oncogenes. We also found that pneumonitis is not infrequent, and carries key implications for outcomes. These data should be useful for improving the clinical courses of nivolumab-treated patients with NSCLC.

The first alternative drug of choice was the xanthine oxidase inhibitor allopurinol. The purpose was to (1) investigate the efficacy of allopurinol (standard dosage) compared with previous treatment with benzbromarone; and (2) investigate the combination therapy allopurinol-probenecid as an effective alternative treatment compared with previous benzbromarone treatment. A prospective, open study was carried out in a cohort of 51 gout patients who discontinued benzbromarone therapy because of market withdrawal. Patients were given 200-300 mg allopurinol (stage 1). When allopurinol failed to attain the target serum urate (sUr) levels patients reaching target levels sUr patients completed treatment with allopurinol monotherapy (range 200-300 mg/day; mean 256 mg/day), which resulted in 25% of patients attaining sUr target levels. Decrease in sUr levels was 36[11]%, which was significantly less compared to treatment with benzbromarone (p < 0.001). In stage 2, 14 patients received allopurinol-probenecid combination therapy, which resulted in 86% of patients attaining target sUr levels (after failure on allopurinol monotherapy), which was comparable to previous treatment with benzbromarone (p = 0.81). Decrease in sUr levels was 53[9]% (CI 95%: 48-58%), which was a non-significant difference compared to previous treatment with benzbromarone (p = 0.23). Benzbromarone is a very effective antihyperuricemic drug with 91% success in attainment of target sUr levels patients to attain target sUr levels (13% success).

Endovascular exclusion of an aortic pseudoaneurysm using an endoprosthesis is a less invasive approach, but few such cases have been reported. Moreover, the use of this approach poses unique therapeutic challenges because there is no specific endoprosthesis for ascending aortic repair, particularly to treat patients with previous coronary artery bypass graft (CABG). We describe the case of a 74-year-old patient who had undergone CABG and later presented with an iatrogenic ascending aortic pseudoaneurysm that occurred during an angiography. This patient was at very high risk for surgical treatment and, therefore, an endovascular approach was adopted: percutaneous coronary intervention for the left main coronary artery, left anterior descending and left circumflex native coronary arteries followed by endovascular endoprosthesis deployment in the ascending aorta to exclude the pseudoaneurysm. Both procedures were successfully performed, and the patient was discharged without complications 4 days later. At 5 months' clinical follow-up, his clinical condition was good and he had no complications.

We evaluated the efficacy of ibrutinib, a covalent inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase, in patients at risk for a poor outcome. In this multicenter, open-label, phase 3 study, we randomly assigned 391 patients with relapsed or refractory CLL or SLL to receive daily ibrutinib or the anti-CD20 antibody ofatumumab. The primary end point was the duration of progression-free survival, with the duration of overall survival and the overall response rate as secondary end points. At a median follow-up of 9.4 months, ibrutinib significantly improved progression-free survival; the median duration was not reached in the ibrutinib group (with a rate of progression-free survival of 88% at 6 months), as compared with a median of 8.1 months in the ofatumumab group (hazard ratio for progression or death in the ibrutinib group, 0.22; P<0.001). Ibrutinib also significantly improved overall survival (hazard ratio for death, 0.43; P=0.005). At 12 months, the overall survival rate was 90% in the ibrutinib group and 81% in the ofatumumab group. The overall response rate was significantly higher in the ibrutinib group than in the ofatumumab group (42.6% vs. 4.1%, P<0.001). An additional 20% of ibrutinib-treated patients had a partial response with lymphocytosis. Similar effects were observed regardless of whether patients had a chromosome 17p13.1 deletion or resistance to purine analogues. The most frequent nonhematologic adverse events were diarrhea, fatigue, pyrexia, and nausea in the ibrutinib group and fatigue, infusion-related reactions, and cough in the ofatumumab group.

The anti-programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) antibody atezolizumab is clinically active against cancer, including NSCLC, especially cancers expressing PD-L1 on tumour cells, tumour-infiltrating immune cells, or both. We assessed efficacy and safety of atezolizumab versus docetaxel in previously treated NSCLC, analysed by PD-L1 expression levels on tumour cells and tumour-infiltrating immune cells and in the intention-to-treat population. In this open-label, phase 2 randomised controlled trial, patients with NSCLC who progressed on post-platinum chemotherapy were recruited in 61 academic medical centres and community oncology practices across 13 countries in Europe and North America. Key inclusion criteria were Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0 or 1, measurable disease by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1), and adequate haematological and end-organ function. Patients were stratified by PD-L1 tumour-infiltrating immune cell status, histology, and previous lines of therapy, and randomly assigned (1:1) by permuted block randomisation (with a block size of four) using an interactive voice or web system to receive intravenous atezolizumab 1200 mg or docetaxel 75 mg/m(2) once every 3 weeks. Baseline PD-L1 expression was scored by immunohistochemistry in tumour cells (as percentage of PD-L1-expressing tumour cells TC3â¥50%, TC2â¥5% and <50%, TC1â¥1% and <5%, and TC0<1%) and tumour-infiltrating immune cells (as percentage of tumour area: IC3â¥10%, IC2â¥5% and <10%, IC1â¥1% and <5%, and IC0<1%). The primary endpoint was overall survival in the intention-to-treat population and PD-L1 subgroups at 173 deaths. Biomarkers were assessed in an exploratory analysis. We assessed safety in all patients who received at least one dose of study drug.

The present study was designed to further evaluate the efficacy and safety of icotinib in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) previously treated with platinum-based chemotherapy. Patients with NSCLC progressing after one or two lines of chemotherapy were enrolled to receive oral icotinib (125 mg tablet, three times per day). The primary endpoint was progression-free survival. The secondary endpoints included overall survival, objective response rate, time to progression, quality of life and safety. From March 16, 2010 to October 9, 2011, 128 patients from 15 centers nationwide were enrolled, in which 124 patients were available for efficacy evaluation and 127 patients were evaluable for safety. The median progression-free survival and time to progression were 5.0 months (95%CI 2.9-6.6 m) and 5.4 months (95%CI 3.1-7.9 m), respectively. The objective response rate and disease control rate were 25.8% and 67.7% respectively. Median overall survival exceeded 17.6 months (95%CI 14.2 m-NA) according to censored data. Further follow-up of overall survival is ongoing. The most frequent treatment-related adverse events were rash (26%, 33/127), diarrhea (12.6%, 16/127) and elevation of transaminase (15.7%, 20/127). In general, this study showed similar efficacy and numerically better safety when compared with that in ICOGEN trial, further confirming the efficacy and safety of icotinib in treating patients with advanced NSCLC previously treated with chemotherapy.

We reviewed the medical records of all patients with MBC treated at Samsung Medical Center between January 2009 and August 2016. Patients received fulvestrant 250 mg intramuscularly every 28 days (from January 2009 to November 2010) or 500 mg intramuscularly every 28 days (from December 2010 to August 2016). Tumor responses were assessed every 8 weeks and at the end of treatment, as well as when disease progression was suspected. A total of 84 patients were included in this study. A median of two previous endocrine treatments had been performed; 79% of the patients had received two or more endocrine treatments. Forty-five patients (54%) had been treated with chemotherapy for MBC before the fulvestrant treatment course. Visceral metastasis was found in 49 patients (58%). The estimated median progression-free survival and overall survival were 4.4 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.4 to 5.5) and 32.5 months (95% CI, 17.6 to 47.4), respectively. The disease control rate was 40.5% (95% CI, 30.5 to 51.5); partial response was observed in 16% of the patients and stable disease was observed in 25% of the patients. The most frequently reported adverse reactions were mild-to-moderate grade myalgia (10.5% of the patients), injection site pain (7%), and fatigue (7%). Fulvestrant was generally well tolerated. Fulvestrant showed encouraging clinical activity and favorable feasibility in postmenopausal women with MBC who had been treated with multiple endocrine therapies and/or cytotoxic chemotherapies.\n\nPhase II trial of veliparib in patients with previously treated BRCA-mutated pancreas ductal adenocarcinoma.\n\nPubMed\n\nLowery, Maeve A; Kelsen, David P; Capanu, Marinela; Smith, Sloane C; Lee, Jonathan W; Stadler, Zsofia K; Moore, Malcolm J; Kindler, Hedy L; Golan, Talia; Segal, Amiel; Maynard, Hannah; Hollywood, Ellen; Moynahan, MaryEllen; Salo-Mullen, Erin E; Do, Richard Kinh Gian; Chen, Alice P; Yu, Kenneth H; Tang, Laura H; O'Reilly, Eileen M\n\n2018-01-01\n\nBRCA-associated cancers have increased sensitivity to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPis). This single arm, non-randomised, multicentre phase II trial evaluated the response rate of veliparib in patients with previously treated BRCA1/2- or PALB2-mutant pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Patients with stage III/IV PDAC and known germline BRCA1/2 or PALB2 mutation, 1-2 lines of treatment, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 0-2, were enrolled. Veliparib was dosed at a volume of 300Â mg twice-daily (NÂ =Â 3), then 400Â mg twice-daily (NÂ =Â 15) days 1-28. The primary end-point was to determine the response rate of veliparib; secondary end-points included progression-free survival (PFS), duration of response, overall survival (OS) and safety. Sixteen patients were enrolled; male NÂ =Â 8 (50%). Median age was 52 years (range 43-77). Five (31%) had a BRCA1 and 11 (69%) had a BRCA2 mutation. Fourteen (88%) patients had received prior platinum-based therapy. No confirmed partial responses (PRs) were seen: one (6%) unconfirmed PR was observed at 4 months with disease progression (PD) at 6 months; four (25%) had stable disease (SD), whereas 11 (69%) had PD as best response including one with clinical PD. Median PFS was 1.7 months (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.57-1.83) and median OS was 3.1 months (95% CI 1.9-4.1). Six (38%) patients had grade III toxicity, including fatigue (NÂ =Â 3), haematology (NÂ =Â 2) and nausea (NÂ =Â 1). Veliparib was well tolerated, but no confirmed response was observed although four (25%) patients remained on study with SD forÂ â¥Â 4 months. Additional strategies in this population are needed, and ongoing trials are evaluating PARPis combined with chemotherapy (NCT01585805) and as a maintenance strategy (NCT02184195).

Thirty-four patients received one or two courses of the combination. All patients had received prior chemotherapy and 32 had received prior anthracycline chemotherapy. Three patients died before their responses could be fully evaluated. Fourteen patients achieved complete remission (41%) and one patient achieved partial remission. The complete remission rate was 27% for patients with acute myeloblastic leukemia (myelomonoblastic leukemia, monoblastic leukemia, and erythroleukemia) and 89% for patients with acute lymphocytic and undifferentiated leukemia (ALL). Toxic effects included severe hematologic reactions in 33 of 34 patients, hematuria in six patients, altered sensorium in one patient, and congestive heart failure in one patient. The safety of the combination was established and toxic side effects of this therapy were tolerable. The 89% complete remission rate for previously treated patients with ALL suggests that the combination of doxorubicin and ifosfamide may be particularly effective in ALL.\n\nCementless total hip arthroplasty for severely dislocated hips previously treated with Schanz osteotomy of the proximal femur.\n\nPubMed\n\nAkman, Yunus Emre; Yavuz, Umut; Ãetinkaya, Engin; GÃ¼r, Volkan; GÃ¼l, Murat; Demir, Bilal\n\n2018-03-01\n\nWe report the short-term outcomes of total hip arthroplasty(THA) in patients previously treated with Schanz osteotomy (SO). Eighteen patients [2 male, 16 female; mean age, 55.4 (range, 50-66) years] who had undergone THA after SO were retrospectively evaluated. Clinical evaluation was performed based on the Harris hip score. Radiological evaluation was performed using full-length radiographs of the lower extremities, pelvis, and hip. The mean follow-up period was 30.8 (range, 18-56)Â months. Mean femoral shortening was 3.7 (range, 2-5)Â cm. Perioperative complications occurred in 4 (22.2%) patients. Nonunion was not found at the osteotomy sites. No dislocation was observed. The Trendelenburg sign was positive for five (27.7%) patients, postoperatively. The mean Harris hip score improved from 42.7 to 78.7 (pâ<â0.05). THA for hips previously treated with SO is technically demanding. If careful preoperative planning is performed, successful treatment can be achieved.\n\nPharmacokinetics, safety and efficacy of a recombinant factor IX product, trenonacog alfa in previously treated haemophilia B patients.\n\nPubMed\n\nCollins, P W; Quon, D V K; Makris, M; Chowdary, P; Kempton, C L; Apte, S J; Ramanan, M V; Hay, C R M; Drobic, B; Hua, Y; Babinchak, T J; Gomperts, E D\n\n2018-01-01\n\nTrenonacog alfa (IB1001) is a recombinant factor IX (rFIX) manufactured in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. IB1001 was evaluated in a multicentre clinical trial with haemophilia B patients. The aim was to establish IB1001 pharmacokinetic non-inferiority to comparator rFIX, safety and efficacy in previously treated patients (PTPs) with haemophilia B. Subjects were severe or moderately severe haemophilia B adult and adolescent PTPs with no history of FIX inhibitors. IB1001 PK non-inferiority to comparator rFIX was demonstrated through ratio of AUC 0-â in 32 subjects. IB1001 was well tolerated in all 76 treated subjects; the most common adverse drug reaction was headache (2.6% of subjects) and there were no reports of FIX inhibitors. Transient non-inhibitory binding FIX antibodies and anti-CHO cell protein antibodies developed in 21% and 29% of subjects respectively; no safety concerns were associated with development of these antibodies. Prophylaxis (mean durationÂ Â±Â SD: 17.9Â Â±Â 9.6Â months, mean dose: 55.5Â Â±Â 12.9Â IU/kg, median 1.0 infusion per week) was effective in preventing bleeds (median annual bleed rate: 1.52, interquartile range: 0.0-3.46). One or two IB1001 infusions resolved 84% of the bleeds, while for 84% of treatments haemostatic efficacy of IB1001 was rated excellent or good. IB1001 haemostatic efficacy for all 19 major surgeries was rated adequate or better than adequate. IB1001 is safe and efficacious for treatment of bleeds, routine prophylaxis and perioperative management in haemophilia B patients. Â© 2017 The Authors.

Records of 27 patients (aged 17-75) who received 69 (median 3 per patient) (177)Lu-octreotate administrations, including 29 in conjunction with radiosensitising infusional 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) (n = 27), or capecitabine (n = 2), between October 2005 and July 2007 subsequent to 1-8 prior cycles of (111)In-pentetreotide therapy were analysed. Toxicity was assessed during and at 8-12 weeks post-treatment, with further long-term assessments including survival status reviewed till death or study close-out date of 1 November 2009. Reduction in blood counts was most marked following the first dose of (177)Lu-octreotate but at early follow-up the only major haematological toxicity was a single case of grade 4 lymphopaenia. Both the presence of bone metastases and the administration of chemotherapy tended to result in greater reduction in blood counts, but these differences did not reach statistical significance. On long-term follow-up, 16 patients (59%) are alive with median overall survival of 36 months (32-44 months from first (177)Lu-octreotate therapy). None of the recorded deaths was directly related to treatment toxicity. One patient had late grade 4 anaemia and thrombocytopaenia secondary to bone marrow failure from progressive infiltration by tumour. No other significant long-term haematological toxicities were recorded and no leukaemia was observed. No renal toxicity was observed on serial serum creatinine or radionuclide glomerular filtration rate (GFR) determination on initial or long-term follow-up. (177)Lu-octreotate is a safe and well-tolerated therapy for patients who have previously been treated with (111)In-pentetreotide and can be safely combined with\n\nEffect of donepezil in patients with Alzheimer's disease previously untreated or treated with memantine or nootropic agents in Germany: an observational study.\n\nPubMed\n\nKlinger, Tatjana; Ibach, Bernd; Schoenknecht, Peter; Kamleiter, Martin; Silver, Gabrielle; Schroeder, Johannes; Mielke, Ruediger\n\n2005-05-01\n\nThis open-label, prospective, observational, Post-Marketing Surveillance (PMS) study assessed the efficacy and safety of donepezil in patients who had been switched from therapies currently used in Germany to treat Alzheimer's disease (AD), such as memantine and nootropics, due to insufficient efficacy or poor tolerability. A treatment-naive population was included as a comparator. Patients with AD were treated with donepezil and observed for a period of approximately 3 months. A cognitive assessment was made using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Quality of life (QoL) was assessed by the investigators who answered the question 'How did therapy with donepezil influence the QoL of the patient and/or his family over the observation period?' and was graded using three ratings: improved/unchanged/worsened. Adverse events (AEs) were also monitored. A total of 913 patients entered the study (mean +/- SD MMSE score 18.03 +/- 5.34). Efficacy assessments were analyzed for three groups: an overall group of patients who had received any form of prior AD drug therapy (N+ group; n = 709); a subgroup of patients from the N+ group who had received prior memantine therapy only (M+ group; n = 111) and patients who were drug treatment naive (N- group; n = 204). In the evaluable population donepezil improved MMSE scores by 2.21 +/- 3.47 points on average, with similar improvements observed in all three groups. QoL was judged to be improved in at least 70% of patients, again with similar results obtained for all three groups. Donepezil was well tolerated, with 85 of 913 (9.3%) patients reporting AEs. The most common AEs were those typically seen with cholinergic therapies (i.e., diarrhoea, vomiting and nausea). In this observational PMS study, donepezil was shown to be efficacious and well tolerated in patients who were being insufficiently treated with memantine or nootropic therapy. The magnitude of response was similar to that observed in patients who were previously\n\nChallenges of coronary angiography and intervention in patients previously treated by TAVI.\n\nPubMed\n\nBlumenstein, Johannes; Kim, Won-Keun; Liebetrau, Christoph; Gaede, Luise; Kempfert, Joerg; Walther, Thomas; Hamm, Christian; MÃ¶llmann, Helge\n\n2015-08-01\n\nSince the beginning of the transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) era, many prosthetic valves have entered clinical practice. TAVI prostheses differ regarding stent design and some may potentially interfere with diagnostic or interventional catheters. The aim of our analysis was to evaluate the feasibility of coronary angiography (CA) or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in patients with prior TAVI. From 2011 to 2014, 1,000 patients were treated by TAVI at our center using eight different valve prostheses (Symetis ACURATE TA and ACURATE TF; Medtronic CoreValve and Engager; JenaValve, SJM Portico; Edwards Lifesciences SAPIEN and SAPIEN XT). In this analysis, all patients were included who underwent either CA or PCI after TAVI. CA or PCI were rated as fully feasible when coronary ostia could be fully intubated, partially feasible when coronary arteries could be displayed only unselectively or unfeasible when coronary arteries could not be displayed. A total of 35 patients underwent CA/PCI after TAVI at our hospital. In all patients with valves implanted in a subcoronary position (SAPIEN n = 19; JenaValve n = 1), selective intubation was feasible using standard catheters. Out of 15 patients with valve types that are placed over the coronary ostia (CoreValve n = 10, ACURATE n = 4, Portico n = 1), selective intubation of coronary arteries was not possible in 9 cases, even with the use of different diagnostic catheters. Full accessibility was possible only in 3 cases. In 2 cases, display of the right CA was only feasible using unselective aortography. In 1 case, coronary arteries could not be displayed at all immediately after a valve-in-valve procedure. CA or PCI after TAVI is usually feasible. Devices that are placed in a partially supracoronary position, however, can interfere with diagnostic or guiding catheters and impede straightforward intervention, especially when the prosthesis is not implanted in the correct position.\n\nLong-term safety and efficacy of taliglucerase alfa in pediatric Gaucher disease patients who were treatment-naÃ¯ve or previously treated with imiglucerase.\n\nPubMed\n\nZimran, Ari; Gonzalez-Rodriguez, Derlis Emilio; Abrahamov, Aya; Cooper, Peter A; Varughese, Sheeba; Giraldo, Pilar; Petakov, Milan; Tan, Ee Shien; Chertkoff, Raul\n\n2018-02-01\n\nTaliglucerase alfa is an enzyme replacement therapy approved for treatment of Gaucher disease (GD) in children and adults in several countries. This multicenter extension study assessed the efficacy and safety of taliglucerase alfa in pediatric patients with GD who were treatment-naÃ¯ve (n=10) or switched from imiglucerase (n=5). Patients received taliglucerase alfa 30 or 60U/kg (treatment-naÃ¯ve) or the same dose as previously treated with imiglucerase every other week. In treatment-naÃ¯ve patients, taliglucerase alfa 30 and 60U/kg, respectively, reduced mean spleen volume (-18.6 multiples of normal [MN] and -26.0MN), liver volume (-0.8MN and -0.9MN), and chitotriosidase activity (-72.7% and -84.4%), and increased mean Hb concentration (+2.0g/dL and +2.3g/dL) and mean platelet count (+38,200/mm 3 and +138,250/mm 3 ) from baseline through 36 total months of treatment. In patients previously treated with imiglucerase, these disease parameters remained stable through 33 total months of treatment with taliglucerase alfa. Most adverse events were mild/moderate; treatment was well tolerated. These findings extend the taliglucerase alfa safety and efficacy profile and demonstrate long-term clinical improvement in treatment-naÃ¯ve children receiving taliglucerase alfa and maintenance of disease stability in children switched to taliglucerase alfa. Treatment was well-tolerated, with no new safety signals. This study is registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01411228. Copyright Â© 2016 Shire Human Genetic Therapies, Inc.

In MCS Memorial Institute of Oncology in Gliwice a research programme on salvage HDR brachytherapy for local recurrences of prostate cancer treated previously with EBRT has been ongoing since February 2008. The treatment consisted of 3 fractions of 10 Gy each given every 14 days. Maximal urethral doses were constrained to be â¤ 120% of the prescribed dose. Maximal bladder and rectum doses were constrained to be â¤ 70% of the prescribed dose. Fifteen eligible patients were treated and analyzed from February 2008. All patients completed the treatment without major complications. The most common early complications were: macroscopic haematuria, pain in lower part of the abdomen, and transient dysuria. During the first week after the procedure a transient increase in IPSS score was noticed. The Foley catheter was removed on day 2 to 5. No complications after spinal anaesthesia were observed. Acute toxicity according to EORTC/RTOG was low. For bladder EORTC/RTOG score ranged from 0 to 2. Only in two patients grade 1 toxicity for rectum was observed. The follow-up ranged from 3 to 9 months. In one patient grade 2 rectal toxicity was observed, and one had urethral stricture. Other patients did not have any other significant late toxicity of the treatment. Two patients developed bone metastases. Salvage brachytherapy for localized prostate cancer (3 Ã 10 Gy every 14 days) seems to be a safe and well tolerated procedure. A significant decline in prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level is seen in patients with hormone-responsive cancer. Long-term efficiency and toxicity of the procedure are yet to be established.\n\nCost-effectiveness of pembrolizumab versus docetaxel for the treatment of previously treated PD-L1 positive advanced NSCLC patients in the United States.\n\nPubMed\n\nHuang, Min; Lou, Yanyan; Pellissier, James; Burke, Thomas; Liu, Frank Xiaoqing; Xu, Ruifeng; Velcheti, Vamsidhar\n\n2017-02-01\n\nThis analysis aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of pembrolizumab compared with docetaxel in patients with previously treated advanced non-squamous cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with PD-L1 positive tumors (total proportion score [TPS]ââ¥â50%). The analysis was conducted from a US third-party payer perspective. A partitioned-survival model was developed using data from patients from the KEYNOTE 010 clinical trial. The model used Kaplan-Meier (KM) estimates of progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) from the trial for patients treated with either pembrolizumab 2âmg/kg or docetaxel 75âmg/m 2 with extrapolation based on fitted parametric functions and long-term registry data. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were derived based on EQ-5D data from KEYNOTE 010 using a time to death approach. Costs of drug acquisition/administration, adverse event management, and clinical management of advanced NSCLC were included in the model. The base-case analysis used a time horizon of 20 years. Costs and health outcomes were discounted at a rate of 3% per year. A series of one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to test the robustness of the results. Base case results project for PD-L1 positive (TPS â¥50%) patients treated with pembrolizumab a mean survival of 2.25 years. For docetaxel, a mean survival time of 1.07 years was estimated. Expected QALYs were 1.71 and 0.76 for pembrolizumab and docetaxel, respectively. The incremental cost per QALY gained with pembrolizumab vs docetaxel is $168,619/QALY, which is cost-effective in the US using a threshold of 3-times GDP per capita. Sensitivity analyses showed the results to be robust over plausible values of the majority of inputs. Results were most sensitive to extrapolation of overall survival. Pembrolizumab improves survival, increases QALYs, and can be considered as a cost-effective option compared to docetaxel in PD-L1 positive (TPS â¥50%) pre-treated advanced NSCLC patients in\n\nFDA Approval: Ibrutinib for Patients with Previously Treated Mantle Cell Lymphoma and Previously Treated Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia.\n\nPubMed\n\nde Claro, R Angelo; McGinn, Karen M; Verdun, Nicole; Lee, Shwu-Luan; Chiu, Haw-Jyh; Saber, Haleh; Brower, Margaret E; Chang, C J George; Pfuma, Elimika; Habtemariam, Bahru; Bullock, Julie; Wang, Yun; Nie, Lei; Chen, Xiao-Hong; Lu, Donghao Robert; Al-Hakim, Ali; Kane, Robert C; Kaminskas, Edvardas; Justice, Robert; Farrell, Ann T; Pazdur, Richard\n\n2015-08-15\n\nOn November 13, 2013, the FDA granted accelerated approval to ibrutinib (IMBRUVICA capsules; Pharmacyclics, Inc.) for the treatment of patients with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) who have received at least one prior therapy. On February 12, 2014, the FDA granted accelerated approval for the treatment of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) who have received at least one prior therapy. Ibrutinib is a first-in-class Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor that received all four expedited programs of the FDA: Fast-Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation, Priority Review, and Accelerated Approval. Both approvals were based on overall response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DOR) in single-arm clinical trials in patients with prior treatment. In MCL (N = 111), the complete and partial response rates were 17.1% and 48.6%, respectively, for an ORR of 65.8% [95% confidence interval (CI), 56.2%-74.5%]. The median DOR was 17.5 months (95% CI, 15.8-not reached). In CLL (N = 48), the ORR was 58.3% (95% CI, 43.2%-72.4%), and the DOR ranged from 5.6 to 24.2 months.

Methods We retrospectively studied 80 patients initially treated with antithyroid drugs and requiring either RAI (8.3 Â± 1.7 mCi of 131I; n = 40) or TTx (n = 40) as second-line therapy. Results The TTx and RAI groups were not different, except for larger goiter, higher FT3 and more frequent Graves' orbitopathy at diagnosis in the surgery group (p < 0.05). A persistent remission of hyperthyroidism was observed in 97% of operated patients versus 73% of the RAI patients at 3 years (p < 0.01). TTx was followed by a rapid and steady decrease in TSI during the first 9 months, while a surge of antibodies was observed during the first 6 months after RAI, followed by a slow decrease over the next 18 months. At the last visit, high TSI levels were still observed in 18 and 60% of patients in the surgery and RAI groups, respectively (p < 0.001). Conclusions TTx is more efficient than RAI to induce a rapid and permanent correction of hyperthyroidism and TSI decrease in patients previously treated with antithyroid drugs.

Direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) are not currently available for HCV genotype 2 patients, different from genotype 1 patients, in clinical practice. We investigated 29 HCV genotype 2-infected Japanese patients who had been previously treated and failed to clear HCV. We retreated them with peginterferon alfa-2a plus ribavirin and measured HCV RNA level to assess the efficacy and safety of this treatment in patients who had failed previous therapy. We found that retreatment of HCV genotype 2-infected Japanese patients with peginterferon alfa-2a plus ribavirin for 24-48 weeks led to 60 to 66.6% sustained virological response (SVR) in patients previously treated with (peg-)interferon monotherapy and to 69.9% SVR in relapsers previously treated with peginterferon plus ribavirin. Attention should be paid to certain patients with unique features. Selection of patients according to their previous treatment could lead to optimal therapy in HCV genotype 2 treatment-experienced patients.

We assessed its efficacy and safety versus docetaxel in previously treated patients with non-small-cell lung cancer. We did a randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial (OAK) in 194 academic or community oncology centres in 31 countries. We enrolled patients who had squamous or non-squamous non-small-cell lung cancer, were 18 years or older, had measurable disease per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, and had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1. Patients had received one to two previous cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens (one or more platinum based combination therapies) for stage IIIB or IV non-small-cell lung cancer. Patients with a history of autoimmune disease and those who had received previous treatments with docetaxel, CD137 agonists, anti-CTLA4, or therapies targeting the PD-L1 and PD-1 pathway were excluded. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to intravenously receive either atezolizumab 1200 mg or docetaxel 75 mg/m 2 every 3 weeks by permuted block randomisation (block size of eight) via an interactive voice or web response system. Coprimary endpoints were overall survival in the intention-to-treat (ITT) and PD-L1-expression population TC1/2/3 or IC1/2/3 (â¥1% PD-L1 on tumour cells or tumour-infiltrating immune cells). The primary efficacy analysis was done in the first 850 of 1225 enrolled patients. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02008227. Between March 11, 2014, and April 29, 2015, 1225 patients were recruited. In the primary population, 425 patients were randomly assigned to receive atezolizumab and 425 patients were assigned to receive docetaxel. Overall survival was significantly longer with atezolizumab in the ITT and PD-L1-expression populations. In the ITT population, overall\n\nEfficacy and tolerability of brinzolamide/brimonidine suspension and prostaglandin analogs in patients previously treated with dorzolamide/timolol solution and prostaglandin analogs.\n\nPubMed\n\nLo, Jonathan S; Pang, Pierre M; Lo, Samuel C\n\n2016-01-01\n\nFixed combination glaucoma medication is increasingly used in glaucoma treatment. There is a lack of comparative study in the literature of non-beta blocker combination agents used adjunctively with a glaucoma agent in a different class. The objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of intraocular pressure (IOP) control and tolerability of non-beta blocker combination suspension with prostaglandin analogs (PGA) in patients with open angle glaucoma who were previously treated with beta blocker combination solution with PGA. Open-label retrospective review of patient records. This study looked at patients with open angle glaucoma taking dorzolamide/timolol solution with PGA that were switched to brinzolamide/brimonidine combination suspension with PGA. This study reviewed the charts of all patients who were at least 21 years old with a clinical diagnosis of open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension in at least one eye. Patients needed to have been treated with concomitant use of PGA and dorzolamide/timolol solution for at least one month. Patients using dorzolamide/timolol solution plus PGA with medication related ocular irritation were switched to brinzolamide/brimonidine suspension with the same PGA. Best-corrected visual acuity, ocular hyperemia grading, slit lamp biomicroscopy and Goldmann applanation tonometry measurements, and patient medication preferences were assessed at baseline, 1 month and 3 months. Forty eyes with open angle glaucoma. The mean age of the patients was 68 and 60% were females. The IOP before the switch was 17.2 and 16.5 (P=0.70) following the switch at 3 months. We found a decreasing trend of ocular hyperemia (P=0.064) and strong preference (P=0.011) for non-beta blocker combination suspension but no difference of visual acuity and slit lamp findings. Brinzolamide/brimonidine combination suspension when used adjunctively with PGA is equally effective. Patients in this study reported greatly reduced ocular redness and shorter\n\nTreatment of Previously Treated Facial Capillary Malformations: Results of Single-Center Retrospective Objective 3-Dimensional Analysis of the Efficacy of Large Spot 532 nm Lasers.\n\nPubMed\n\nKwiek, BartÅomiej; Ambroziak, Marcin; Osipowicz, Katarzyna; Kowalewski, Cezary; RoÅ¼alski, MichaÅ\n\n2018-06-01\n\nCurrent treatment of facial capillary malformations (CM) has limited efficacy. To assess the efficacy of large spot 532 nm lasers for the treatment of previously treated facial CM with the use of 3-dimensional (3D) image analysis. Forty-three white patients aged 6 to 59 were included in this study. Patients had 3D photography performed before and after treatment with a 532 nm Nd:YAG laser with large spot and contact cooling. Objective analysis of percentage improvement based on 3D digital assessment of combined color and area improvement (global clearance effect [GCE]) were performed. The median maximal improvement achieved during the treatment (GCE) was 59.1%. The mean number of laser procedures required to achieve this improvement was 6.2 (range 1-16). Improvement of minimum 25% (GCE25) was achieved by 88.4% of patients, a minimum of 50% (GCE50) by 61.1%, a minimum of 75% (GCE75) by 25.6%, and a minimum of 90% (GCE90) by 4.6%. Patients previously treated with pulsed dye lasers had a significantly less response than those treated with other modalities (GCE 37.3% vs 61.8%, respectively). A large spot 532 nm laser is effective in previously treated patients with facial CM.\n\nPhase II of oral gimatecan in patients with recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or peritoneal cancer, previously treated with platinum and taxanes\n\nPubMed Central\n\nPecorelli, S.; Ray-Coquard, I.; Tredan, O.; Colombo, N.; Parma, G.; Tisi, G.; KatsarÃ²s, D.; LhommÃ©, C.; Lissoni, A.
