        "text": "Achieving Sustainable development can be possible only with Education, as Education and development are interdependent on one another. As it is observed that the recent international economic scenario is fluctuating, not being stable for a period of time. Being aware of changes in the society, being educated and enhancing skills can play a vital role to moving society toward sustainability. This paper is focused on some of the important issues like global warming, inefficiency to use the available energy productively, and scarcity of water, increased pollution, and abuse of Human Rights, Terrorism, Naxalism, and Consumerism and suggested a few possible solutions which will be useful to answer these problems. Education is the only way by which humans can inculcate the value of sustainability, peace, harmony and love for ecosystem. People are the agents of transformation and they should be included in decision making process. This paper also tries to focus on teacher training and revising education curriculum right from kinder garden to up to higher education at university level, in order to connect the gained knowledge, acquired skills, adopted perspectives and believed values with sustainable development, which is important to present and future generations.\n\nThe increasing rate of information and communication technologies (ICTs) development and their widespread implementation across all sectors of the economic and social life brings about radical changes in the way we work, think, learn and communicate. There is not, however, a universally accepted definition of ICTs due to the fact that concepts, methods and applications related to ICT are constantly evolving and can be contextually interpreted and applied. A broad definition of ICT is concerned with the distinction between \" old or traditional technologies \" (radio, television, video, DVD, telephone, computers) and \" new or modern technologies \" (video conferencing, e-mail, cellular telephones, weblogs, Web 2.0, and other social networking software). No matter what technology development is, the educational system, worldwide, face the challenge of preparing citizens who need to be equipped with the necessary skills and competencies to transform current unsustainable practices. In this context, teachers are increasingly called upon to switch from roles of being knowledge transmitters to towards taking more active roles as curriculum developers, knowledge constructors and transformative learning agents. Three of the major forces shaping and driving the 21st century education are: 1) the development and diffusion of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs); 2) the increasing demand for new educational approaches and pedagogies that foster transformative and lifelong learning 3) the reorientation of educational curricula to address sustainable development. Communication Technologies can thus be a context for Education for Sustainable Development as well as Education for Sustainable Development can be a context for Information and Communication Technologies. More specifically: • Education for Sustainable Development themes integrated into the school curricula could provide a worthwhile context for ICTs in education. For example, social, economic and environmental issues can provide meaningful and challenging contexts for developing a wide range of ICT skills. • Education for Sustainable Development methods are conducive with constructivist and transformative learning theories, which can provide a context and rationale for using ICT-based learning tools such as concept mapping, modeling, social networking. • When considering areas such as cultural diversity and intercultural understanding, health, HIV/AIDS, governance, natural resources, climate change, rural development, sustainable urbanization, poverty alleviation, corporate responsibility and accountability, there is potential to assess the impact of ICTs in these key sustainable development areas. Teachers have an opportunity to develop skills in problem definition and problem solving, to reflect on their students learning, knowledge and practices, and develop a deep understanding of the way students think and act on social and environmental issues. The notion of Sustainable Development can be traced back to 1713 when Von Carlowitz spoke about unsustainable usage of wood. From this moment the notion of sustainability gradually was winning more and more recognition and popularity. In 1968 the Club of Rome was founded and its activities have significantly contributed to the understanding of the term sustainability in the modern way. In 1992, United Nations organized a conference on Environment and Development (UNCED, so called 'Rio'). As one of the results of the\n\nThe stakes are high for ESD. This is the pathway to open up a new age of sustainability, being ushered in by climate change, natural disasters, the threat of crossing planetary boundaries. Vanishing species, access to water, water management, food security, urbanization, poverty all pose opportunities for new ways of thinking, new systems for social inclusion, and opportunities for economic innovation and vitality. People are the greatest renewable resource for new ways of thinking and giving expression to our responsibilities for each other. Dr Irina Bokova, Director of UNESCO set out a global approach to cultivating creative learning for the new age with sustainability as the basis for concrete action. Bokova signaled that Education for All has principles which are core to sustainability when she said ‘EFA goals and MDGs are complementary: “When you fund education, you are securing progress towards all the Millennium Development Goals”.\n\nGuru Arjan Dev Institute of Development Studies(IDSAsr), Amritsar has planned to organize two days 8th IDSAsr National Seminar on the theme Education for Sustainable Development: Strength, Weakness, Opportunities and Challenges on February 9-10,2018. Seminar aimed to reorient education towards sustainability, which in turn had the potential to impact the way people think. The seminar will help to equip people with knowledge of and skills in sustainable development, making them more competent and confident while at the same time increasing their opportunities for leading a healthy and productive lifestyle in harmony with nature and with concern for social values, gender equity and cultural diversity. Contributions of all the players in the field are of utmost importance. Keeping in view your vast expertise in the field, it will be highly appreciated if you please contribute your thought provoking paper for presentation and discussion at the seminar. All interested are requested to submit their papers before December 2017 end. However, early submission will help us to plan its publication schedule in a better manner. You are also requested to give wide publicity to this call for papers among your network for greater deliberation/presentation at the seminar and to bring out a major policy framework for sustainable development, and hence SDG-4. Look forward for an early date response."
