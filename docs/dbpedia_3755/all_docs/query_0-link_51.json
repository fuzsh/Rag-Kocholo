        "text": "Washington, DC — House Democratic Whip Steny H. Hoyer is traveling to four states in the coming days to campaign for Democratic incumbents and challengers in key districts.\n\nToday, Hoyer in Las Vegas, Nevada. In the morning he attended a fundraiser in support of candidate Susie Lee (NV-03). Lee, who runs an education non-profit serving more than 60,000 students across Nevada and founded a homeless shelter for women and families, is running for the open seat currently held by Democratic Rep. Jacky Rosen, who is running for U.S. Senate. Lee's race has been included in the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee's (DCCC) \"Red to Blue\" program, which targets key swing districts. In the afternoon, Hoyer will attend a lunch in support of freshman Rep. Ruben Kihuen (NV-04). Rep. Kihuen is a former Nevada State Senator and State Assemblyman, and he defeated an incumbent Republican to win the NV-04 seat last cycle in a close race. He is running for re-election in 2018 and is part of the DCCC Frontline program to assist its most vulnerable incumbents.\n\nOn Saturday, Hoyer will travel to Missouri and Kansas, where he will participate in two campaign events with candidate Paul Davis (KS-02). A former Minority Leader of the Kansas House of Representatives, Davis is running for the open seat being vacated by Republican Rep. Lynn Jenkins, who is not seeking re-election. Davis has been named to the DCCC's \"Red to Blue\" program. Hoyer will also attend a fundraiser in Kansas City, Missouri, in support of Rep. Emanuel Cleaver (MO-05). Rep. Cleaver was first elected to Congress in 2004 after serving as Mayor of Kansas City and Pastor of the St. James United Methodist Church. He is running for re-election in 2018.\n\nHoyer will be in Iowa on Sunday, where he will join Rep. Dave Loebsack (IA-02) for a fundraiser in Davenport. A former political science professor at Cornell College in Mount Vernon, Iowa, Rep. Loebsack has served the people of the Second District in Congress since 2007. He is running for re-election and is a Member of the DCCC Frontline program. In the afternoon, Hoyer will travel to Cedar Rapids to attend a fundraiser in support of candidate Abby Finkenauer (IA-01). Finkenauer currently serves in the Iowa House of Representatives and was recently named to the DCCC \"Red to Blue\" program. The district is currently represented by incumbent Republican Rep. Rod Blum.\n\nHeading to Illinois on Monday, Hoyer will join Rep. Cheri Bustos (IL-17) for a fundraising event in Peoria. First elected to Congress in 2012, Rep. Bustos is a former journalist and member of the East Moline City Council. She is running for re-election in 2018 and is a Member of the DCCC Frontline program.\n\nHoyer has made seventeen trips since the beginning of the 2018 election cycle in support of candidates and incumbents in sixteen states, raising or contributing $1.7 million to elect a Democratic Majority."
