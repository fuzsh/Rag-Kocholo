He started the opening three games before returning to action with another start in his final contest on Nov. 2 at Texas Tech. He recorded at least one TFL in three of his four games.\n\nHodges, a junior from Darnestown, Md., had a team-best 87 tackles in 2022 as TCU reached the College Football Playoff National Championship. It was the most stops by a Horned Frog since Garret Wallow had 90 in 2020. Hodges was the Big 12 Defensive Player of the Week after a season-high 11 tackles, including 1.5 for loss, as TCU held Texas to 199 yards of offense in a 17-10 win in Austin.\n\nPlayers Mentioned\n\n#57 Johnny Hodges\n\nLB\n\n6' 2\"\n\nJunior"
