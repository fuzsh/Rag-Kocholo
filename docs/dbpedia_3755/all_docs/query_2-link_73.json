        "text": "STARKVILLE – Mississippi State football's Kevin Coleman has been named to the watchlist for the 2024 Paul Hornung Award presented by Texas Roadhouse.\n\nThe Paul Hornung Award is given annually by the Louisville Sports Commission (LSC) to the most versatile player in major college football. The Award was created by the LSC in January 2010 with the support of the Golden Boy himself, Paul Hornung, a native and lifelong resident of Louisville and member of the College and Pro Football Halls of Fame.\n\nColeman, a native of St. Louis, Mo., enters his first season at Mississippi State in 2024 after spending his freshman season at Jackson State and last season at Louisville.\n\nIn 2023, Coleman played in all 14 games for the Cardinals with 11 starts. He totaled 26 receptions for 362 yards and two touchdowns while rushing the ball 26 times for 117 yards. He helped lead Louisville to a 10-4 record, a berth in the ACC Championship game and a spot in the Holiday Bowl.\n\nWhile at Jackson State, Coleman was named the SWAC Freshman of the Year. During that 2022 season, Coleman caught 22 passes for 475 yards and three touchdowns. He ended his rookie season with a career-high seven receptions for 137 yards and a score in the Celebration Bowl against North Carolina Central.\n\nFor the most up-to-date information on the Bulldogs, follow MSU football on Twitter, like them on Facebook and join them on Instagram by searching for \"HailStateFB.\"\n\n– HailState.com –"
