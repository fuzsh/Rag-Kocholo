        "text": "Kansas Democratic gubernatorial candidate Paul Davis chose Prairie Village as the site to announce Wichita businesswoman Jill Docking as his running mate.\n\nIn an 8:30 a.m. rally before a crowd of around 100 at Franklin Park, Davis and Docking appeared together for the first time in public. Docking, part of a well-known Democratic family in the state, challenged current Gov. Sam Brownback for the U.S. Senate in 1996. She is a former chair of the Kansas Board of Regents. Her husband Tom served as Lieutenant Governor to Kansas Gov. John Carlin in the 1980s.\n\nIn their remarks to the crowd, Davis and Docking focused on education, saying the Brownback administration’s policies have hurt students in the state.\n\n“We can’t afford Gov. Brownback’s divisive approach to leadership,” Docking told the crowd. “He keeps attacking other people, when what we need is a governor who brings us together.”\n\nSunflower Brew has posted a video of the speeches:\n\nFormer U.S. Rep. Dennis Moore, among the state’s most prominent recent Democratic elected officials, was on hand at the rally as well, and was entertaining the riders on Davis and Docking’s school bus with his guitar as the group made their way from Prairie Village to Topeka for another rally. Davis and Docking had rallies planned in Wichita and Salina as well."
