        "text": "Music PhD on UK Catalog\n\nThe First Two Years\n\nThe first two years of study provide training in the practice and methodology of musicology and ethnomusicology. A minimum of 30 hours of graduate credit is required during the first two years of graduate study.\n\nSecond-Year Review, Examinations, and Research Paper\n\nDuring the second year of graduate study the student will be expected to:\n\nTake an examination designed to test the student's knowledge, including both repertoire and scholarly literature, of selected topics, announced in advance (see instructions for the Common Examinations on the School of Music DGS webpage) in European and American music and in ethnomusicology, and of music theory. This will include a four-hour exam in general music history, with questions directed toward PhD candidates in musicology/ethnomusicology that are reflective of scholarly study and that include ethnomusicological topics (these questions will differ somewhat from those for DMA candidates); it will also include a four-hour exam in music theory. Under normal circumstances, these exams should be taken near the beginning of the Spring semester in the second year of study. Students who are exempted from the first year of study through an approved previous M.A. degree will take these exams during the Spring semester of their first year of study.\n\nWrite a paper on a topic of the student’s choice, and with approval of the student’s advisor. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the student’s ability to conduct research, display lucid and articulate writing, and to successfully negotiate the process of revision under the supervision of the advisor or another faculty member. This second-year paper should explain and review a selected topic in musicology or ethnomusicology, survey and evaluate the available literature on the topic, and identify lines of inquiry which remain to be pursued. The recommended length for this paper is 20-30 pages of prose, in addition to the bibliography, with appendices and musical examples as needed. The completed paper should be submitted to the student’s advisor both electronically and in hard copy\n\nNotes: If the paper is to be a revision of a previously submitted seminar paper, this revision should be done with the consent of the original instructor (as well as the student’s advisor), and the original instructor should supervise the revision process.\n\nThe departmental evaluation of all students in the second year is based on course work completed to date, the paper, the results of the preliminary exam, and the student's prospects for continued success in the field. The department's judgment is a collective one. If the evaluation is favorable, the student may continue in the Ph.D. program. If a student has not successfully fulfilled the requirements of the second-year review, but has performed adequately in other respects, he or she will, upon completion of 36 credits of coursework, be awarded a terminal master's degree.\n\nA student who completed a thesis as part of a previous master’s degree in musicology or ethnomusicology may submit this in lieu of the paper as described above. The process:\n\nThe student and advisor agree on a paper topic, obtaining the agreement of the original professor if this is to be a revision of a previously submitted paper. If the proposed paper would not fit the basic description above, consent should be obtained from the entire Musicology and Ethnomusicology faculty before proceeding.\n\nThe student writes and revises the paper under the supervision of the advisor and/or the instructor of course for which the paper was originally submitted. The advisor and one other faculty member, either the other instructor as referred to above, or another member of the student’s advisory committee, must agree that the paper is acceptable. Both of these faculty members should be have the opportunity to request revisions.\n\nWhen the two primary faculty members agree that the paper is acceptable, it should be circulated to the entire Division faculty for their consent. Any faculty member may indicate to the advisor that further revisions would be necessary for his or her approval, but if a majority are satisfied, such revisions will not be required (although they should be passed on to the student in any case as suggested improvements).\n\nIn the case of a submission of a musicology master’s thesis submission, a copy of the thesis should be submitted to the Chair of the Graduate Advisory Committee for Approval.\n\nThe Third Year\n\nDuring the third year, students continue to be enrolled full-time in classes. These should include MUS 702 each semester, MUS 703 if not taken previously, and MUS 711 if offered. The remainder of the coursework should consist of independent study with the advisor or other faculty members in preparation for the dissertation prospectus and special area examinations, and other courses as recommended by the student’s Advisory Committee.\n\nThird-Year Special Area Comprehensive\n\nExaminations and Thesis Prospectus Defense\n\nThird-Year students in the Ph.D. program in musicology and ethnomusicology take a written four-hour special area examination dedicated to preparing them for the broad area of context and more specialized area of focus for their thesis. Following completion of the written examination, the student will undertake an oral examination based on these same topic areas. The Special Area Examination is usually taken near the end of the Spring semester of the third year. It is recommended that in the preceding Fall semester and in the Spring semester the student enroll in independent study classes with the advisor or other member of the advisory committee to prepare for the examination and the thesis prospectus (see below). The student shall schedule the oral examination through the Graduate School web site and must include all members of the graduate advisory committee. This is the examination recognized by the Graduate School as the “Comprehensive Exam.” Following successful completion of these exams, the student shall be admitted to Ph.D. Candidacy.\n\nThe qualifying examinations will consist of a special field examination in musicology or ethnomusicology, the general sense and limits of which have been discussed in advance with the prospective dissertation advisor and the student’s advisory committee and approved by graduate faculty members of the Division. The special field should be defined broadly enough to demonstrate that the student has sufficient preparation both to write the proposed dissertation and to teach in a recognized area of musicological scholarship, without being so broad as to make in-depth knowledge of the field impractical. In most cases, the student and advisor will also agree on a more focused area within the special field which will require more intense and complete preparation. The written examination shall be four hours long, to be followed by a two hour examination which may, under specific circumstances, also incorporate the defense of the thesis prospectus.\n\nPreparation for the Special Area Examination topics should also serve as preparation for crafting the Thesis Prospectus, a document of approximately 25 pages (excluding bibliography) that presents the background, thesis statement, significance of the study, delimitation of scope, methodology, review of literature, chapter summary, and working bibliography. When completed, the thesis prospectus should be circulated to the committee prior to a scheduled oral defense of the thesis prospectus before the entire graduate advisory committee.\n\nGenerally, the oral exam for the Special Area Examination and the Thesis Prospectus Defense will be scheduled for two separate two-hour long events. However, if a completed thesis prospectus has been circulated to the committee at least a week in advance and if the entire graduate advisory committee consents, the oral exam and the thesis prospectus defense may be integrated and addressed in a single meeting to be scheduled for a minimum of 2 1Ž2 hours. It is essential that both the oral examination and the prospectus defense be allotted a minimum of one hour each. At least the first hour must be devoted to the oral examination. If at that point, the committee is satisfied and votes to pass the student, the defense of the prospectus may begin. If more time is needed for the oral exam, that may continue for the full two hours, in which case the prospectus defense will have to be rescheduled for a later date.\n\nThe Dissertation\n\nAs soon as possible after the successful completion of Qualifying Examinations, the student should submit a dissertation proposal to his/her Advisory Committee. The student will defend this proposal at a meeting of the committee, and is expected to submit any required revisions within two months.\n\nThe dissertation itself will meet all the requirements of the University of Kentucky Graduate School, and will be defended following the usual Final Examination procedures.\n\n1) The Separate M.A. Program\n\nThe Director of Graduate Studies in association with the Coordinator of the Division of Musicology and Ethnomusicology will serve as the advisor and approve the student’s course schedule for the first semester.\n\nThe second semester the Division Coordinator will assign an advisor drawn from the Division in consultation with the student. That advisor will serve until the student chooses a Chair and Advisory Committee to guide him/her through the thesis process. The Chair will serve as the primary advisor from that point to the conclusion of the degree. The student may also choose the Chair of the Graduate Advisory Committee in the second semester. In this case, the chair continues to guide the student’s master’s work until its conclusion.\n\n2) The Combined M.A./Ph.D. Program\n\nThe Director of Graduate Studies in association with the Coordinator of the Division of Musicology and Ethnomusicology will serve as the advisor and approve the student’s course schedule for the first semester.\n\nThe second semester the Division Coordinator will assign an advisor drawn from the Division in consultation with the student. That advisor will serve until the student successfully completes the 2nd Year examinations.\n\nImmediately upon passing the 2nd year examinations, the student will form the Graduate Advisory Committee. The student should consult with his/her advisor in selecting members of the committee, and is responsible for completing the “Request to form a Graduate Advisory Committee” form on-line.\n\nThe Graduate Advisory Committee shall contain three full-time members of the Division of Musicology and Ethnomusicology (one of whom will serve as chair, and a second of which may be designated as co-chair) as well as a full time member of the Division of Theory and Composition. At this point, the committee does not need to also include the outside member. When a thesis direction is chosen, an outside member is chosen and the full Graduate Advisory Committee is formally submitted to the Graduate School through the appropriate on-line form. At this point, the student may also change the membership of the committee if the thesis topic makes this appropriate. The composition of the committee must also satisfy Graduate School policy concerning full and associate graduate status for committee members.\n\nThe full Graduate Advisory Committee (five members) shall have an introductory meeting when the committee is first formally convened. Residency, language, research methods, and other requirements shall be considered. Minutes documenting the meeting shall be circulated to the student and the committee, and a copy shall be placed in the file in the Office of Student Affairs.\n\nAfter the initial meeting, the Graduate Advisory Committee shall meet at least once each year to provide guidance for the student’s academic progress. Additional members of the Division may be invited to the meeting in order to provide additional perspective as necessary.\n\nThe Graduate Advisory Committee shall be convened for the oral examination following the written qualifying examinations.\n\nThe Graduate Advisory Committee shall be convened for the Prospectus Defense. Since this is an “internal” requirement, it is necessary for only the “core” committee to be present, though it is desirable that the full committee be present.\n\nThe Graduate Advisory shall meet a final time at the thesis defense.\n\n3) Student entering the “Continuous” (Blended) program and already possessing a Master’s degree.\n\nThe Director of Graduate Studies in association with the Coordinator of the Division of Musicology and Ethnomusicology will serve as the advisor and approve the student’s course schedule for the first semester.\n\nImmediately upon passing the 2nd year examinations, the student will form the Graduate Advisory Committee. (The exams will be taken during the 1st semester). The student should consult with his/her advisor in selecting members of the committee, and is responsible for completing the “Request to form a Graduate Advisory Committee” form on-line.\n\nThe Graduate Advisory Committee shall contain three full-time members of the Division of Musicology and Ethnomusicology (one of whom will serve as chair, and a second of which may be designated as co-chair) as well as a full time member of the Division of Theory and Composition. At this point, the committee does not need to also include the outside member. When a thesis direction is chosen, an outside member is chosen and the full Graduate Advisory Committee is formally submitted to the Graduate School through the appropriate on-line form. At this point, the student may also change the membership of the committee if the thesis topic makes this appropriate. The composition of the committee must also satisfy Graduate School policy concerning full and associate graduate status for committee members.\n\nThe full Graduate Advisory Committee (five members) shall have an introductory meeting when the committee is first formally convened. Residency, language, research methods, and other requirements shall be considered. Minutes documenting the meeting shall be circulated to the student and the committee, and a copy shall be placed in the file in the Office of Student Affairs.\n\nAfter the initial meeting, the Graduate Advisory Committee shall meet at least once each year to provide guidance for the student’s academic progress. Additional members of the Division may be invited to the meeting in order to provide additional perspective as necessary.\n\nThe Graduate Advisory Committee shall be convened for the oral examination following the written qualifying examinations.\n\nThe Graduate Advisory Committee shall be convened for the Prospectus Defense. Since this is an “internal” requirement, it is necessary for only the “core” committee to be present, though it is desirable that the full committee be present.\n\nThe Graduate Advisory shall meet a final time at the thesis defense.\n\nCore Literacy List\n\nAcademic Checklists:\n\nMaster of Arts\n\nPh.D.\n\nTemporary Committee Form\n\nStudents should have their Doctoral Advisory Committee in place before taking the Common Exams. However, because of the nature of the \"Blended\" MA/Ph.D. Program, it is too early to form the full graduate advisory committee complete with an outside member. Therefore, a temporary graduate committee should be formed consisting of the chair, two musicologists/ethnomusicologists, and a theorist. The form, attached in PDF format, should be downloaded, completed, signed, and placed in the student's file in the Office of the Director of Graduate Studies. Following General Comprehensive Examinations (usually in the spring of the second year) it is usually appropriate to form the full graduate advisory committee. This is accomplished by completing the online form at the Graduate School website.\n\nFinancial Support\n\nTeaching Assistantships\n\nWe strongly believe that students are best prepared for an academic career by teaching under the supervision of an experienced professor. Therefore, the bulk of financial support for graduate students in musicology is through assistantships. The majority of entering Ph.D. students are offered full assistantships renewable for a total of three years. These assistantships carry an initial stipend of about $10,000, increasing each year to about $11,000 by the third year, plus full tuition (students must, however, pay some fees). For the first two years, each Teaching Assistant is usually assigned two sections (45 students each) of Introduction to Music for non-majors, for which they are fully responsible (with the exception of textbook selection, which is done for all sections together). In the third year, Teaching Assistants may be assigned other history courses for non-majors, such as Symphonic Music, Vocal Music, History of Jazz, or American Music. We are not usually able to award Teaching Assistantships to students in the M.A. program.

For application information, see UK Graduate Scholarships and Financial Assistance.\n\nThe Rey M. Longyear Dissertation Fellowship\n\nEach year, one student with an approved Ph.D. dissertation proposal will be awarded a one-year non-service fellowship of $11,000 for research and writing of the dissertation. Students should indicate their interest, in writing, to the Coordinator of the Division of Musicology by March 15.\n\nTravel and Research Funding\n\nGraduate students at either the M.A. or Ph.D. level may apply for research and travel support through the Rey M. Longyear Musicology Research and Travel Fund. This provides reimbursement for dissertation and thesis research and for travel to professional meetings. Students are also eligible for support from the Graduate School and from the Friends of the UK School of Music.\n\nUniversity of Kentucky Libraries\n\nInfoKat Search\n\nLucille Caudill Little Fine Arts Library and Learning Center\n\nMusic Related Electronic Resources (most services require proxy server to access from off campus).\n\nMusic Library & Special Collections\n\nDesiree Scarambone\n\nX Marks Nothing: Chiasmus and Kenosis in Kaija Saariaho’s La Passion de Simone\n\n(research director: Ben Arnold)\n\nPh.D. 2022\n\nAbstract\n\nKathryn L.
