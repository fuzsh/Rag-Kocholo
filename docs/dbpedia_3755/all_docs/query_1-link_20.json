        "text": "Lawrence attorney and former state legislator Paul Davis formally entered the race Tuesday for the open eastern Kansas congressional seat held by a Republican for nearly a decade.\n\nDavis, who lost the governor’s race in 2014 to incumbent Sam Brownback but carried the 2nd District by six percentage points, said the objective of his candidacy was to help alter the divisive political culture in Washington, D.C., that considers bipartisanship a plague and too often bends to big-money interests.\n\n“Unprecedented amounts of money have corrupted our government and our elections in recent years, and it has paralyzed Washington,” Davis said in Topeka in the first of four campaign appearances. “Changing the system is the key to giving the people back their voice and restoring accountability to Congress.”\n\nHe said change was necessary to deliver affordable health care, fair taxes and create jobs. Kansans have expressed to him “fear, frustration and disappointment” their values aren’t reflected in Washington, he said.\n\nDavis said he was dismayed Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., recently threatened to include Democrats in negotiations on a health reform bill if GOP colleagues refused to support repeal of the Affordable Care Act.\n\n“When did bipartisanship become a threat?” Davis said. “If our children ever behaved at school the way most of Washington behaves on an average Tuesday, we’d have an entire generation of kids growing up in detention.”\n\nDavis said Democrats and Republicans shared responsibility for dysfunction in Congress. He said he wouldn’t vote to retain Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., the House’s Democratic leader.\n\nRep. Lynn Jenkins, a Republican who has represented the 25-county district since 2009, chose not to seek re-election in 2018. Republicans hold all Kansas federal elective posts, but Democrats Nancy Boyda and Jim Slattery carried Jenkins’ district in the past.\n\nDavis’ announcement tour also rolled through Pittsburg, Leavenworth and Lawrence. No Democrat has joined Davis in the 2nd District contest, but Sen. Steve Fitzgerald, R-Leavenworth, and Basehor resident Vernon Fields are candidates for the Republican nomination.\n\nIn an interview Tuesday, Fitzgerald said the district’s voters should send to Congress a supporter of the agenda put forward by President Donald Trump. The president must be steadfast amid conflict in the Washington establishment, Fitzgerald said.\n\nHe dismissed Davis as a veteran Democratic operative with a modest legislative record in Topeka.\n\n“I don’t think he brings to the table what we’re going to need in Washington,” Fitzgerald said. “I don’t think he has the breadth and depth.”\n\nDavis, 45, pushed back against the idea Trump’s election had a positive influence on the federal government.\n\n“A lot of Americans right now are turning on their TVs every day and shaking their heads when they see the comments that are coming out of the president and the White House,” Davis said.\n\nDavis highlighted his lifelong residency in the 2nd District and service in the Kansas House from 2003 to 2015. He earned a law degree at Washburn University and an undergraduate degree at the University of Kansas. His wife, Stephanie, is a psychologist who works with military veterans.\n\nIn terms of public policy, Davis said he helped engineer budgets that reduced state spending by $1.2 billion, championed public education and shepherded passage of the latest 10-year highway plan.\n\nHe claimed credit for supporting 100 tax cuts while battling the “reckless tax experiment” inspired by Brownback that, in 2012, eliminated the state income tax on 330,000 business owners and deleted the state’s upper state income tax bracket.\n\n“They want to pull the Brownback tax experiment out of Kansas’ dumpster, polish it up a little and sell it to the entire country,” Davis said. “What you’ve seen time and time again in Washington, and you’ve seen it in Topeka, when it comes to tax policy, special interests and people who have lobbyists are the ones who get their way. It places more of a burden on the middle class.”"
