        "text": "When Matthew Polenzani returns to Ravinia, he is coming home. The internationally renowned operatic tenor is from the area and grew up here. “I grew up all over the Chicago area,” Polenzani explains, “but we never lived anywhere longer than three years. I was born in Evanston. The longest my parents lived anywhere was in Wilmette.”\n\nDid Polenzani go to Ravinia when he was growing up?\n\n“Oh, sure,” says Polenzani, though curiously, it wasn’t to see Pavarotti and such. “I wasn’t interested in classical music growing up,” Polenzani explains. “That came later. But Ravinia doesn’t just do classical programming, they do a lot of stuff. I’ve seen Paul Simon there, James Taylor. We loved sitting out on the lawn. It was a part of my high school and also into college in the summers.”\n\nPolenzani sang in area rock bands in those days. “All classic rock. Zeppelin, Stones, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Fleetwood Mac, like that.” And also in musicals. “I was in ‘A Chorus Line’; I was in ‘Anything Goes.’ Even in college, I did ‘The Princess and the Pea’ and there was another one I’m not recalling. I was always glad to do those sorts of things. I liked singing, but when I went to college I went to be a music major. The idea I had was that singing was something that I can do and I’m kind of good at it without really trying.\n\n“I’d gone through college completely aimed at being a teacher. And the summer before my last year of school, I sang on a master class for opera bass-baritone Alan Held, who was having a lovely career at that point and had another fifteen or twenty years after that. He heard me and after the class he pulled me aside and said, ‘Have you ever thought about being a singer instead of teaching? They’re always looking for tenors.’ I never had, but he put me in touch with his teacher Richard Cross, who was married to Doris Yarick-Cross who ran the Yale opera program. And he said, ‘I’m going to write them about you, and I really think you should consider going.’ So I thought to myself, ‘Wow. For sure, I’ll go. And if I like doing opera, well, then I can explore it.’ But otherwise, if you’re on a teaching track, every master’s degree you get ups your pay scale. I thought at least I would be eminently more hirable as a music educator with a master’s degree from Yale University.\n\n“Beyond that, my voice teacher in college had given me a tape of a whole bunch of different arias and of course, I didn’t listen to it at all. It was right before the summer that I met Alan, actually, that I popped it into the tape player just because I didn’t know what it was.\n\n“And the first thing on it was ‘E lucevan le Stelle’ from José Carreras’ 1976 recording of ‘Tosca’ with Caballé and Wixell and Colin Davis conducting. Sam Ramey was the Angelotti, it was way early in Sam’s career. And I heard that and it blew up my world. That was the first time I became aware that opera could be more than just people bellowing in a language that I didn’t understand.”\n\nCoincidentally, it was a concert performance of “Tosca” that became Polenzani’s Ravinia debut in 1995. He sang the role of Spoletta.\n\n“It was supposed to be Pavarotti [singing Cavaradossi], but he ended up cancelling and Richard Leech sang. There was Sergei Leiferkus, and Elizabeth Holleque was Tosca. I have a big memory of standing in the midst of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra when they were at absolute full cry. It was so great. Very cool.”\n\nFrom 1995-97, Polenzani became a member of the Lyric Opera Center for American Artists, later renamed the Ryan Center. He has been a stalwart presence at Lyric Opera ever since.\n\nSadly, Polenzani sang the last concerts given by late Lyric Opera music director emeritus Sir Andrew Davis when Davis conducted his own orchestration of Handel’s “Messiah” at the Chicago Symphony Orchestra last December.\n\n“There was to have been another ‘Messiah’ next December in Cincinnati… Sir Andrew wasn’t a young man, but he felt quite young as an individual, as an artist and with his energy. I was completely caught off guard [by his passing]. He seemed like he had twenty years left in him.\n\n“I’d sung a lot with Sir Andrew, multiple ‘Don Giovanni’s with him, ‘Rosenkavalier,’ ‘Abduction,’ ‘Werther,’ quite a lot. ‘Idomeneo’ might have been his first time, actually. ‘Tito.’ And other concert things, too. I’m thinking of Berlioz ‘Romeo and Juliet’ and things like that. He was always a willing and capable partner. I mourn his loss. It’s a sad thing for the music world.”\n\n“Idomeneo” will be presented in a semi-staged production in Ravinia’s Martin Theatre on August 9 and 11 with Polenzani in the title role. Los Angeles Opera music director and former Ravinia music director James Conlon conducts the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus. As with Davis, Polenzani has worked with Conlon numerous times.\n\n“I’ve always appreciated his approach to music. We’ve worked together for quite a long time so there’s a level of trust there that you don’t always find. With James, it’s always been easy. Every time I get a chance to be with him, I’m always grateful. We’ve talked about this project for years. I’m so glad that we’ve finally figured out a way to get it done. This is our first ‘Idomeneo’ together.\n\n“I do all of the Mozart operas quite a lot but ‘Idomeneo’ has become more consistent for me over the last ten or twelve years. It’s a spectacularly great part and I really love singing it. It’s better frankly for an older guy, a man who might have an adult son. Or if not an adult, at least late teens, early twenties. My oldest is seventeen so it’s a part I really identify with.\n\n“Mozart has been such a home for me in my entire career, even though I’m singing much bigger and heavier repertory these days. Anytime I get a chance to go back to Mozart, I always want to go back. My agent knows if it comes up and I’m not free, then I’d like to try to figure out a way to get free. Mozart helps me center myself and reminds me where I came from. I enjoy this part, not just because I enjoy chewing on the dramatic problems he’s got, but also because I like to get myself centered. This is a great way to do it.\n\n“I sing differently today, my voice is considerably heavier. It’s bigger, there’s a lot more metal in it. It’s big enough now for Verdi and Puccini and things like Berlioz and Massenet. I have Wagner coming up. My voice is big enough now for that stuff.”\n\nAnd Verdi’s “Otello” is also coming up, it says on Polenzani’s website, the notorious role considered the tenor-killer of Italian opera.\n\n“Yes, that’s coming next year. It’s funny because at my age, having done the number of things that I’ve done in my career, my repertory choices have always been broad. The way I have approached adding parts is that anytime I add a part, I didn’t add it and then added ten more productions in the following two years. That’s the same approach I am taking with ‘Otello’ as I would with anything else. I’m just going to sing it my way, in my style, and I’m not doing it in a four-thousand-seat hall. I’m doing it in Stuttgart.” The capacity at Stuttgart Opera is fourteen-hundred seats.\n\n“I need Mozart to re-center myself after these larger roles. My feeling is that there’s a certain ethereality in Mozart’s orchestration that doesn’t exist in Puccini or Verdi, except in certain moments. You really have to be judicious and careful in the way you approach this music. This part sits lower than most Mozart parts, although none of them sits especially high [for a tenor] very frankly. I never thought of Tamino or Ottavio as very high. You might argue that Belmonte is a little higher in ‘Abduction,’ or even ‘Così.’ For sure, Ferrando has some really high moments.\n\n“As a generality, Idomeneo sits a little lower. It’s quite central. The middle of the voice has got to be well fleshed out, which is why oftentimes younger singers won’t sing this. I think the first time I sang it was in 2009 or 2010, in Torino. Of course, I’m a different Idomeneo now than I was then. The center of my voice has gotten a little lower so it is an especially good fit for me these days.\n\n“What’s really special is there’s quite a lot of interesting orchestral moments and especially a lot of great choral moments. I’m so glad that we’ve got the CSO Chorus singing with us. They are an integral part of the drama.\n\n“Idomeneo has the fate and the health and the wealth and the weight of his entire nation, basically, on his shoulders. It’s up to him to save all his subjects and the only way forward is to kill his son. It’s a terrible weight to be under and a beautiful weight to wrestle with on the stage. I really enjoy it. It’s not your proverbial between a rock and a hard place, it’s so much worse than that. You need to bring weight to the issue he faces, heartache and heartbreak. It’s his willingness to step up and be the king for the moment, you know, and lead the nation out of Neptune’s path and wrath. It’s an unbelievably proud moment and an unbelievably sad moment all at once.”\n\nPolenzani is also giving a vocal recital at Ravinia’s Martin Theatre on August 20.\n\n“My dear friend Kevin Murphy is playing [piano] for me and I’m always happy to be collaborating with him and be making music together. Of course, he left the Met, years ago now. I can’t believe it. It’s been a long time. So anytime I get to see him and work with him, it always makes me happy.\n\n“The fun thing about this program is that there are two sets of songs, one in each half in English. One of them is a song cycle by Gerald Finzi in British English, and it’s a little harder to get. But the Charles Ives songs in the second half are all really fun and beautiful. I like the way the program flows and I like the way it feels.\n\n“Of the Ives songs, ‘Feldeinsamkeit’—which the English title that Ives gave is ‘In Summer Fields’—is just one of the most gloriously beautiful songs I’ve ever heard. In fact, when I leave this program and start doing something different, I’ll probably hold on to that as an encore. It’s just one of my favorite songs.\n\n“The feeling of all these songs is quite old time-American and evocative of a time period that’s a hundred years ago. This kind of music is, I don’t know, there’s something very wholesome and loving and peaceful about it. I hear these songs and I find myself in a good mood, you know? And I think that comes across in the performance.\n\n“Gerald Finzi’s ‘A Young Man’s Exhortation’ is an interesting set of songs. There are ten songs, five are written from the point of view of a younger man and five are written from the point of view of an older man. It’s funny. The first time I sang all of them more than twenty years ago, it was harder for me to appreciate what the older guy was talking about because I was in my early thirties. I didn’t know how to look back at a life lived, a life that could be examined in a way that I can do today.\n\n“The language is a little prickly, but oh, the songs are quite beautiful. They’re love songs about different types of love and loss. I enjoy going on his little journey from the beginning of love to the end of life, the way he travels from falling in love to the grave. It’s an interesting look at life.\n\n“The Schumann ‘Liederkreis’ Opus 24 trace a similar arc. I actually like them better than the more famous Opus 39 set. The cycle feels more visceral and complete to me, let’s just say.\n\n“Starting the evening with Schubert, there are a couple of reasons for that. One, of course, if there was a greater songwriter ever in history, I don’t know who it is. I’m not saying that other composers didn’t equal Schubert in greatness in some places here or there. The choice of Schubert to start wasn’t just because I liked the mood that it puts me in and because I like the way he writes, but also because I wanted to put something that was a little more familiar at the top half.\n\n“I’m very much looking forward to these concerts. I always look forward to coming back to Ravinia not just because I’m from the area, but because my family is still there. My friends are still living there. Well, my sisters and brother don’t live there anymore, but my parents still do. And quite a few of my friends. My wife and I lived in Evanston right after we got married for about a year and a half. Amazing memories.”"
