        "text": "Overview\n\nThe Boyer College of Music and Dance was founded in 1962.\n\nMission\n\nThe Boyer College of Music and Dance is committed to nurturing and advancing music as a form of human expression, as an art, and as a subject for intellectual inquiry. Recognizing that music possesses unique powers—to move the spirit, to excite the mind, to reveal the past, to chart the future, to instruct, to heal, and to foster communication—the college seeks to perpetuate music in its myriad forms through creative and scholarly work, teaching, and service, according to the highest artistic and academic standards.\n\nAs an integral part of Temple University, the Boyer College shares the ideals of Russell Conwell upon which Temple was founded: to recognize talent and personal potential wherever they may be found; to provide educational opportunities for meritorious students of limited financial means; and to serve as a constructive presence in the wider Philadelphia community.\n\nIn carrying out its mission, the Boyer College seeks both to continue the long tradition of artistry and scholarship that we have inherited and to develop new insights, perspectives, and practices. This dual objective—to explore both past and future, old and new—should be broadly reflected in the life of the college: in curricula and instruction; institutional policy; professional activities of faculty; advisement of students; and musical performances.\n\nFor the art of music to remain vital, our culture must develop both highly trained, professional musicians and informed, perceptive listeners. Accordingly, the college recognizes its responsibility to administer professional education to the student seeking a career in music, provide opportunities for the general university student to study and experience music, and share its musical life with the public.\n\nThe Boyer College provides a distinctive union of the best conservatory-type training with intense academically oriented classroom teaching. Coupled with the performance opportunities of the university and the culturally rich Philadelphia area, the Boyer College offers students the competitive edge in complete, comprehensive musical preparation. Many programs throughout the university offer minors. Students who wish to pursue a minor outside of music should contact the appropriate department.\n\nAccreditation\n\nBoyer College of Music and Dance is accredited by the National Association of Schools of Music, National Association of Schools of Dance, Middle States Association, National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education, Pennsylvania Department of Education, and American Music Therapy Association.\n\nMusic Admissions\n\nThe following requirements for admission to the college are to be considered minimal. Applicants who pass the following examinations may be recommended to the Director of Admissions as eligible for admission to the college. In addition, candidates must meet general requirements set by the Office of Undergraduate Admissions.\n\nAn audition in the major performing medium must be completed before an applicant can be accepted into the Boyer College of Music and Dance.\n\nAfter submitting the completed application, the applicant is responsible for scheduling his/her audition. E-mail music@temple.edu to schedule your audition. Refer to Boyer College for audition dates, pre-screening requirements, and audition requirements.\n\nThe freshman application deadline is March 1. Applications for admission to the spring semester must be received no later than November 1.\n\nIf the applicant is unable to be present because of distance, applicants should upload a video audition to Acceptd. Refer to Boyer College for specific video audition details.\n\nPrescreening audition recordings are required for jazz guitar; prescreening portfolio submissions are required for the BM in Composition program.\n\nBS in Music applicants must submit a statement of goals to music@temple.edu, and take a theory test.\n\nBS in Music Technology applicants should refer to Boyer's audition requirements for additional admissions information.\n\nDance Admissions\n\nAdmission into the dance program requires the submission of four items:\n\nA general university application submitted to the Office of Undergraduate Admissions.\n\nOfficial transcripts / standardized test scores submitted to the Office of Undergraduate Admissions.\n\nA dance application submitted to the Department of Dance.\n\nAttendance at an audition located on Temple University Main Campus in Philadelphia, or other arrangements to complete the audition requirements.\n\nA dance audition cannot be scheduled until all other required application materials have been submitted. Please note that Temple University will not make an admission decision until applicants attend a dance audition.\n\nThe dance audition consists of technique classes divided into sections of ballet, modern, and African dance; a one-minute solo of an applicant's own choreography; and an interview. The faculty attempts to choose students with physical, artistic, and intellectual potential to enter and complete the dance program and the university curriculum. The faculty is concerned that potential students' goals and aspirations are supported by the department philosophy, maximizing success in the program.\n\nFor additional information regarding dance admissions and for an application, please visit Boyer Admissions.\n\nAcademic Departments\n\nBoyer College of Music and Dance consists of the following departments:\n\nDance\n\nInstrumental Studies\n\nKeyboard Instruction\n\nMusic Education and Music Therapy\n\nMusic Studies\n\nVocal Arts\n\nTransfer Credits\n\nIn addition to the university's statement regarding transfer credit (see Transfer Students), the Boyer College of Music and Dance will, during New Student Orientation, determine all transferred music credits through placement exams. Where deemed necessary, students may be tested in music theory, music history, and secondary piano. Tests in other music areas may be arranged through individual departments.\n\nFinancial Aid\n\nSee Financial Aid in the Bulletin.\n\nFinancial aid is available to full-time undergraduates in the form of music grants, academic scholarships, loans, grants, music grants-in-aid, and work-study programs. No separate application is necessary.\n\nMusic Grants are awarded based on merit. The Boyer College has application and audition deadlines for priority music scholarship consideration. No separate application is required.\n\nEntering Student Scholarships are offered by the Dance Department following successful entrance auditions and are based on artistic talent and potential for success in the dance curriculum. No separate application is necessary.\n\nFinancial aid awards are made after the student has been admitted as a fully matriculated student. Students are to be enrolled full-time, unless prior permission is granted to do otherwise by the Associate Dean.\n\nMusic and Dance scholarships and awards for currently enrolled and graduating undergraduate and graduate students include, but are not limited, to the following:\n\nVoice/Opera\n\nFlorence Berggren Voice Scholarship\n\nPhilip Y.

As a division of Temple University's Boyer College of Music and Dance, Music Prep is uniquely able to combine university expertise with Philadelphia's outstanding cultural assets, assuring excellence in experience and results.\n\nProgramming includes Early Childhood Music Foundations beginning with newborns through 4 years of age, Movement and Dance Classes for children 3 years old through teens, individual instruction in all instruments and voice for children and adults, and classes specially designed for adults. Music Prep is also an authorized provider of Act 48 credits for Pennsylvania educators.\n\nA major component is the Center for Gifted Young Musicians, which serves those students with exceptional ability and motivation. The Community Music Scholars Program serves students with need from over fifty public schools, allowing access to affordable quality instruction.\n\nTemple Music Prep is a member of the National Guild for Community Arts Education and the Greater Philadelphia Cultural Alliance.\n\nKey Program Components\n\nIndividual lessons from an outstanding faculty in orchestral instruments, piano, guitar, voice, composition and jazz techniques are offered for children and adults.\n\nSuzuki instruction in violin, cello, guitar, and piano is also offered for young children. In the \"talent education method\" of Dr. Shinichi Suzuki, children learn to play music with the same enjoyment and fluency with which they learn language.\n\nEarly Childhood Music Foundations is an innovative program in early childhood music education (newborns through children 4 years of age) that has a national reputation for excellence. In a carefully planned sequence of music learning, the program uses the natural human inclination for chanting, singing and movement as the first steps in the musical understanding of melody and rhythm.\n\nMovement and Dance classes take children through a sequential, age-specific dance program. Offerings include: Creative Movement (3 & 4 yrs.), Music and Movement (5 yrs. in kindergarten through 7 yrs.), Modern Dance (8 yrs. through teens in three levels) and Ballet Technique (pre-teens & teens).\n\nBasic Musicianship classes are offered in three progressive levels. The goal of these classes is to develop musicianship by integrating aural, written, vocal, and tactile skills. By using movable \"Do\" solfege, students learn to make the connection between musical notation and sound. A one-week summer music theory intensive course is offered for those students preparing to enter a college music degree program.\n\nAdult classes are designed to provide opportunities for personal growth and professional development. Offerings include: classes in learning to play piano, learning to play guitar, learning to sing, jazz improvisation, or in Suzuki piano teacher training; participation in a community band or a community choir during the academic year or week-long music workshops offered at the Boyer College; as well as individual study in instruments and voice. Pennsylvania educators are eligible to receive Act 48 credit for most of these offerings.\n\nThe Center for Gifted Young Musicians is the component of Music Prep that focuses on the training of exceptionally gifted students who have the ability and willingness to make a serious commitment to music. By audition only.\n\nInstrumental Division (for strings)\n\nThe Center's instrumental program provides a comprehensive package of music instruction and performance for young musicians who have demonstrated the greatest potential for musical achievement. Emphasis in this program is placed on the development of superior musical skills through large and small ensemble performance. The faculty is made up of the finest artist/teachers in the region, including members of The Philadelphia Orchestra and professors from Temple's own Boyer College of Music and Dance.\n\nYoung Artists Harp Ensemble\n\nThe Young Artists Harp Ensemble offers pedal and lever harp students ages 10 through high school the opportunity to participate in a group ensemble experience with a conductor as well as in student-led chamber music settings. Participants are also eligible to attend monthly studio master classes by Philadelphia Orchestra principal harpist, Elizabeth Hainen at the Boyer College of Music and Dance. Students may also have the opportunity to collaborate with other Temple Music Prep ensemble groups.\n\nThe Festival of Young Musicians\n\nThe Festival of Young Musicians has long been the centerpiece of the Center for Gifted Young Musicians. Held annually in late April/early May, it consists of a series of concerts throughout the region that feature all the performers in the Center.\n\nThe Community Music Scholars Program: Upper Division provides weekly individual instruction, music theory and ensemble experience at a nominal fee for young instrumentalists. These Philadelphia school students with need are nominated by their school music teachers and accepted by audition.\n\nThe Philadelphia String Project at Temple University is aligned with the National String Project Consortium (NSPC) a coalition of String Project sites at universities across the United States that exchange ideas and learn from each other but operate completely independently. The NSPC is dedicated to increasing the number of children playing stringed instruments, addressing the critical shortage of string teachers in the US and supporting public school string programs. Participating students receive twice weekly instruction taught by a Master Teacher and supported by Temple University undergraduate music education and performance string interns.\n\nThe Boyer College of Music Preparatory and Extension Division is located at Temple University's Center City Campus, 1515 Market Street, in the heart of metropolitan Philadelphia at the hub of the Regional Transit System.\n\nFor further information concerning curricula and fees, write to:\n\nTemple Music Preparatory Division\n\n1515 Market Street, Suite 501\n\nPhiladelphia, PA 19102\n\nmusicprep@temple.edu\n\n215-204-1512\n\nFacilities\n\nPresser Hall, opened in 1967, is the center of musical activity at Temple University. This building houses practice rooms, classrooms, ensemble rehearsal rooms, teaching studios, faculty offices, a 16-station computer classroom, student and faculty lounges, a large listening and viewing library, and the Presser Learning Center. Presser Hall's performance facilities include Klein Recital Hall and Arronson Rehearsal Hall. Presser Hall houses the Music Studies Department, the Music Education Department, the wind, brass, and Percussion programs of the Instrumental Department, the Choral Activities Department, the Department of Voice and Opera, and the programs in Music Therapy and Jazz Studies. Presser Hall is fully Wi-Fi enabled.\n\nThe nationally recognized Presser Center for Research and Creativity in Music, located on the first floor of Presser Hall, houses over 6,000 books, recordings, periodicals, videotapes, audio tapes, classroom instruments, and other materials used in the preparation of music teachers and music therapists. Included in the computer classroom is the hardware and software necessary for future teachers and therapists to become knowledgeable about the role of computers in music and administration.\n\nThe Presser Hall Listening Library houses a collection of more than 20,000 recordings and tapes, 10,000 compact discs, hundreds of video tapes and DVDs, reference books, and scores. Music listening and viewing assignments for courses in music history, theory, composition, jazz, education, and literature can be completed with this collection, which spans music history and performance from the earliest times to the present. This facility also contains general use computer stations, cell-phone and laptop charging stations, searchable databases of digital audio tracks, iPad stations, and multiple LP/CD/DVD media stations. A larger collection of music books and scores is found in Charles Library.\n\nThe Boyer College's Rock Hall was extensively renovated for music and dedicated in 1994 in recognition of the generous support of Dr. Milton Rock and the late Mrs. Shirley Rock. Located at Broad Street and Cecil B. Moore Avenue on Temple University's Main Campus, Rock Hall houses the Office of the Dean, the string and chamber music programs of the New School Institute, the programs in Music Composition, the Keyboard Department, the Early Music Program, the Alice Tully Library, three state-of-the-art computer/electronic laboratories for music and dance, practice rooms, classrooms, and a 325-seat chamber music recital hall. Rock Hall is fully Wi-Fi enabled.\n\nThe visual video/film scoring studio in Rock Hall features a variety of voice modules controlled by a computer workstation, a multi-channel mixer, 5:1 surround sound, and digital and analog recording facilities. Students are encouraged to design their own libraries of timbres for use in composition. The computer synthesis studio uses several computer workstations with expanded disk memory, digital and analog recording equipment, and a broad range of software for music synthesis. Most hardware and software titles in the Boyer College Computer Labs are identical to those in the TECH Center's dedicated Music Lab, enabling students to work on projects in multiple venues.\n\nThe Boyer College added a three-story addition to Presser Hall in 2009 which contains 21 additional practice rooms, three large classrooms, teaching studios, administrative offices, the Center for Arts and Quality of Life, and a 24-track ProTools recording studio.\n\nThe Boyer College's Department of Dance has its administrative, faculty, institute, and student offices housed in 1700 North Broad Street. Dance classes are held in three large dance studios in Pearson Hall where there are additional support spaces as well as two small teaching studios for smaller groups. Dance classes and performances are held in Conwell Dance Theater in Conwell Hall, a 125-seat black box theater. All Dance Department spaces are Wi-Fi enabled.\n\nAs of the 2011-2012 academic year, the College presents its largest ensembles in performance in the Temple Performing Arts Center. This iconic building—formerly the Baptist Temple of Philadelphia—was specifically converted into a performing arts complex capable of housing a full symphony orchestra and choir. Boyer's symphony orchestra, choirs, wind symphony, percussion ensemble and other large ensembles all perform in this venue. In addition, the Temple Performing Arts Center is also available to the College for recording sessions, rehearsals, faculty concerts and other significant events.\n\nAlso utilized by the Boyer College is the third floor of Mitten Hall where the Temple Opera Theater's rehearsal, administrative and faculty offices are housed along with the Opera Listening and Study Library, and the scene, costume, and prop shops. Tomlinson Theater, located across the street from Presser Hall, is used for on-campus large ensemble performances and for the twice yearly staged opera productions. A 55-seat smart classroom for music and dance instruction is housed in the Tuttleman Learning Center.\n\nThe Boyer College is able to loan professional equipment to students in the form of instruments (violins, violas, celli, basses, all woodwinds, all brasses, all percussion), audio gear (JBL, Yamaha and Peavey), portable digital recording units, iPads, and video gear. Also available for use are unique vintage instruments: Hammond B3 Organ with Leslie Speaker, Fender Rhodes 73 synthesizer, Yamaha and Kurzweil synthesizers.\n\nIn July of 2012, the Boyer College of Music and Dance became part of Temple University's Center for the Arts, a comprehensive administrative restructuring of all of the Arts programs on Temple's campus. The combined programs included the Boyer College of Music and Dance, Tyler School of Art, and the Division of Theater, Film and Media Arts. With the oversight of all these areas by the Vice Provost for the Arts and Dean of the Center, Dr. Robert Stroker, the possibilities for collaborations among all of the arts programs on Temple's campus have significantly increased.\n\nIn October 2015, the Center for the Arts was renamed the Center for the Performing and Cinematic Arts; the Division of Theater, Film and Media Arts was renamed the School of Theater, Film and Media Arts; and the Tyler School of Art became an independent school.\n\nStudent Contact Information\n\nRobert T.

See the Dean's List policy for specific GPA and credit-hour requirements.\n\nBand Camp and Choir Retreat Policy\n\nEach fall, prior to the opening of school, the Temple University Marching Band holds its annual band camp. In addition to having a concentrated four-day work period to prepare for the coming season, students get to know each other in both a working and social relationship. They also become acquainted with the group directors at both the personal and professional levels. Attendance at band camp is mandatory for group participation.\n\nThe Temple University Concert Choir often meets a few days prior to fall classes or during the first weekend of fall classes for extensive rehearsals.\n\nEnsemble Requirements\n\nUndergraduate students with a major or concentration in voice or keyboard are required to participate in a choral ensemble, as determined by the Director of Choral Activities, throughout the undergraduate degree program where indicated by the curriculum. Participation begins in the first semester and continues until a baccalaureate degree is obtained. The requirement is waived during the semester of senior recital, internship, or student teaching.\n\nMusic Education/Jazz majors whose concentration is voice are required to participate in both classical and jazz vocal ensembles. After advisement to determine which kind of ensemble is appropriate, these students should go to the Director of Choral Activities to be placed in a classical ensemble and to the Director of Jazz Studies to be placed in a jazz ensemble.\n\nUndergraduate students with a major or concentration in strings are required to play in the Temple University Symphony Orchestra. Participation begins in the first semester and continues until a baccalaureate degree is obtained. Qualified jazz strings and upright bass students are required to audition. This requirement is waived during the semester of student teaching or internship.\n\nAll woodwind, brass, and percussion performance majors and/or concentrations must audition for instrumental ensembles, large and small, at the beginning of the fall semester for placement during the academic year. Continuing students will audition for ensemble placement through juries at the end of each semester. New students will audition for ensemble placement at the beginning of the first semester of study.\n\nMusic education majors whose principal instrument is woodwind, brass, or percussion are required to play in the marching band for one semester, normally during the fall semester of the freshman and sophomore years. Transfer students in this category must also register for Marching Band for one semester unless they can show evidence of equivalent undergraduate experience at another college or university as determined by the Director of Bands.\n\nAll students taking private lessons (major or concentration) or Recital Extensions are required to participate in an ensemble each semester in attendance.\n\nPercussion majors are required to participate in Percussion Ensemble.\n\nAny instrumental student who does not play for a private lesson jury at the end of each semester must arrange for an audition for ensemble placement for the succeeding semester with the Department of Instrumental Studies.\n\nStudents may perform in more than two ensembles only with permission of their advisor.\n\nAll students must show evidence of ensemble experience in their performance medium.\n\nAll students who are registered for applied and concentration lessons must arrange their schedules in order to attend regularly scheduled master/studio classes. Failure to do so may result in the lowering of the applied lesson grade.\n\nIndependent Study Policy\n\nIndependent Study provides a special opportunity for juniors and seniors to work in a highly individualized setting with one or more faculty members.\n\nThose who wish to design an Independent Study project must prepare a written proposal six months in advance of the semester in which the study is to be accomplished. This proposal is then submitted for the approval of a special Honors subcommittee of the Academic Planning and Review Committee, which includes the dean and associate dean. Private lessons beyond those required in the curriculum are not an appropriate form of Independent Study.\n\nProfessional Development Policy\n\nAll students in the college, in addition to passing the required subjects toward their degrees, are obligated to serve in a number of capacities in order to enrich their academic and musical expertise. The Boyer College believes that such experiences give impetus to successful professional careers. Among the duties that may be required are conducting laboratory classes, tutoring, teaching private lessons, coaching, participating in the distribution and inventory control of university-owned musical instruments and instructional materials, participating in ensembles, accompanying, supervising performance classes, performing at admission and open house events, and other academically related activities. The Boyer College performances must be given priority over non-college commitments.\n\nInstrumental Jury Policy\n\nAll instrumental students, both performance majors and instrumental concentration students, must play a jury at the conclusion of each semester to show evidence of progress on their instrument. For string performance majors, the jury at the end of the sophomore year is the \"Junior Standing Jury,\" which must be successfully passed in order for the student to continue in the performance program.\n\nRecital and Concert Attendance Policy\n\nThe dean and faculty of the Boyer College of Music and Dance consider recital and concert attendance to be a significant educational activity in the training of a musician. It is largely through the process of active listening that the young musician develops powers of discrimination and critical judgment with relation to musical performance. Therefore, attendance at a minimum of sixteen college recitals or concerts throughout the course of an academic year is mandatory for full-time undergraduate students. A maximum of 56 recitals is needed to complete the requirement. Of the eight required recitals attended in each semester by full-time students, one must be an official Boyer College World Music Recital or Multicultural Music Lecture-Performance. Part-time, matriculated undergraduate students are also responsible for attending a specific number of concerts with the same World Music Recital or Multicultural Music Lecture-Performance requirement. For part-time students the number of required recitals in a semester will be in a direct ratio to the number of credits for which they are registered. During student teaching, therapy internship, or senior recital, this requirement is waived. The requirement for full-time transfer students will be based on the number of semesters they attended the Boyer College. Failure to comply with this ruling may result in delay of graduation from the college.\n\nSenior Recital Policy\n\nStudents in the following curriculums are required to perform a senior recital:\n\nPiano Performance\n\nPiano Pedagogy\n\nInstrumental Performance\n\nVoice Performance\n\nJazz Instrumental Performance\n\nJazz Voice Performance\n\nJazz Arranging/Composition\n\nThe senior recital provides the opportunity for the performance major to display his or her development and potential as a professional musician and should be considered the focal point for the semesters of private lessons which precede it. Before the senior recital is scheduled, the student\n\nmust have successfully completed private lessons during each semester prior to the recital and\n\nmust have achieved senior status academically.\n\nAll grades of \"incomplete\" in private lessons must be cleared before the student may apply for the senior recital. Students should refer to the Boyer College of Music and Dance Undergraduate Handbook for further details and policies governing recitals.\n\nAfter receiving approval from the jury and the major teacher in the applied area, a student should apply for the Senior Recital date and complete the necessary recital arrangements through the recital coordinator.\n\nFor students enrolled in the Instrumental Studies Department, the recital approval jury serves to demonstrate the student's ability to perform the degree recital successfully. Normally, this occurs at the preceding semester's jury. If by departmental approval this jury does not occur, then a jury must be scheduled at least four weeks prior to the recital. If the jury is not successfully completed by that time, the Instrumental Studies Department reserves the right to cancel the recital date. Most of the recital repertoire, with the exception of chamber ensemble works, should be available for performance at the jury and accompanied by the recital accompanist. Recital approval is dependent upon the time remaining between the approval jury and the actual recital date, as well as the degree of preparedness of the repertoire.\n\nExcept for non-sonata and complicated contemporary repertoire, string performance majors should perform from memory (and the recital program should include some portion that will be performed from memory). Students who wish an exception to this memorization policy must obtain prior approval from the department by indicating the request on the recital repertoire form when it is submitted to the department for approval of the program.\n\nSenior Recitals are usually presented Monday through Friday at 5:15 PM or 7:30 PM. Performance time should be 45 to 50 minutes, exclusive of an optional intermission of no more than 10 minutes.\n\nRecital Extension Policy\n\nSome students may need to extend their applied study beyond the required number of semesters in order to complete the preparation for the Senior Recital. Students who do not present a recital during the recital semester will receive the grade of \"Incomplete\" and must register for MUSC 5000 for 2 semester hours of non-degree credit. Recital Extension must be taken each semester until the recital has been presented. The sole exceptions to this rule are as follows:\n\nStudents who give their recitals during the first three weeks of the spring semester are not required to register for Recital Extension that semester.\n\nStudents who register for Recital Extension or for private lessons during the summer may give their recitals during the first three weeks of the fall semester. However, if a student does not register for either Recital Extension or lessons during the summer, he or she may not present the recital in the fall semester—regardless of the date—without also registering for that semester of lessons or Recital Extension.\n\nPrivate applied lessons beyond the eight-semester requirement currently in effect for undergraduate performance majors may be taken by permission of the jury and/or the appropriate performance department chairman. MUSC 5000 carries a $500 fee (subject to change without notice). Tuition scholarships do not cover this private lesson fee.\n\nProgram Performance Policy\n\nAll music departments reserve the right to dismiss an undergraduate student at any time from a given undergraduate degree program, regardless of grade point average, if in the opinion of the major department, he or she is unable to meet departmental standards. The decision will receive automatic review by the Academic Review and Planning Committee. The student has the right to appeal the dismissal to the Academic Review and Planning Committee of the Boyer College of Music and Dance.\n\nUndergraduate Private Lesson Policy\n\nWeekly one-hour private lessons are arranged for full-time matriculated undergraduates in the Boyer College for as many semesters as required by the particular curriculum. (A full-time student must be registered for at least 12 credits each semester.) A per semester lesson fee of $250 (subject to change without notice)—above and beyond the regular tuition—will be automatically added to the tuition charge of each student for this study. Students who do not complete a minimum of 12 semester hours must pay a private lesson fee of $500 for the succeeding semester of private lessons. Students who are accepted for a double concentration or a double major in performance must be fully accepted by both departments by audition. A private lesson fee of $500 is assessed for the second instrument. Approval of the associate dean is required for all students desiring a double major or double concentration. Tuition scholarships granted by the Boyer College do not cover the private lesson fees.\n\nBoyer College Policies for Dance Students\n\nStudents are responsible for complying with all university-wide academic policies that apply to their individual academic status. Additional and unique policies, or exceptions for the Boyer College of Music, Department of Dance, appear below.\n\nDean's List\n\nEach fall and spring semester, those undergraduates who have met the credit hour and academic criteria for their school or college are placed on the Dean's List. See the Dean's List policy for specific GPA and credit-hour requirements.\n\nLeave of Absence\n\nFull-time students may apply for a Leave of Absence (LOA), as per the LOA policy. However, the Dance department requires students to meet with the Undergraduate Program Coordinator and Department Chairperson in advance of the semester in which the leave of absence is to take place to discuss the reason(s) why the leave is necessary. (Policy # 02.10.16)\n\nInjury Policy\n\nAn injury may affect a student's ability to successfully continue in a course. A student who is injured is expected to immediately contact their instructor and the Undergraduate Program Coordinator to discuss the possibility of continuance in the course. Injured students are responsible for seeking appropriate medical attention for their injuries. Students must provide an official doctor's note recommending non-participation in class to their instructors. Failure to provide a doctor's note verifying an injury may result in the student's violation of applicable absence policies or may otherwise impact the student's grade.\n\nAny student who is advised by a doctor to refrain from dancing for three weeks or more may be required to withdraw from studio courses that focus on dance technique, composition, repertory and improvisation. For students who will miss fewer than three weeks of classes due to their injury, and who are physically able to do so, must attend all classes to observe and take notes. Instructors may assign additional written work if appropriate. If a student is unable to participate in midterm or final examinations due to an injury, the student is responsible for working with their instructor to develop alternate assignments at the discretion of the faculty member.\n\nPersons subject to this policy may have the option for a medical withdrawal or an incomplete in their courses. Students should review Temple University's Withdrawal from Classes Policy (02.10.14) and Incomplete Coursework Policy (02.10.13).\n\nIndependent Study and Field Experience\n\nStudents who wish to register for Independent Study or Field Experience must submit a written proposal to the Undergraduate Program Coordinator no later than two months in advance of the semester in which the study is to be accomplished. A student who is on academic probation may not register for Independent Study or Field Experience. Credits will not be granted retroactively, and no more than 4 credits will be awarded over the course of a student's undergraduate study.\n\nFull-Time/Part-Time Status\n\nThe maximum semester load for full-time undergraduate students is 18 credits. Undergraduate students must carry at least 12 credit hours to be classified as full-time. The Bachelor of Fine Arts (BFA) in Dance requires matriculated students to attend on a full-time basis each semester. Students who have been full-time for at least four semesters may petition the Undergraduate Program Coordinator no later than two months in advance for approval to enroll in the subsequent semester on a part-time basis. All requests for part-time status must be approved by the dance faculty. Part-time status is granted for one semester only. Students who are on academic probation are not eligible for part-time status. If a student is granted part-time status and is then placed on academic probation, part-time status will be revoked.\n\nAcademic Overloads (19 or more semester hours)\n\nAcademic overloads need special approval from the Associate Dean for Student Affairs. Students interested in pursuing an academic overload should contact their Faculty Advisor no later than 2 months prior to the start of the semester in which they desire to overload. Students who are on academic probation are not eligible for academic overloads.\n\nTechnique Standards\n\nTemple University's Department of Dance recognizes the necessity of technical training in building professional quality performers, choreographers, and teachers. Our technique classes focus on contemporary dance practice and draw on styles rooted in African diasporic dance, ballet, and modern dance. Each of our technique teachers draws from an array of influences and styles, preparing students for the eclecticism found within the contemporary dance world today. Through four years of technical training, our students gain an understanding of and apply the following principles in reaching their expressive potential and minimizing injury:\n\nAlignment and Core Connection\n\nPhysical Strength and Flexibility\n\nUpper and Lower Body Integration\n\nClarity in Articulating Various Body Parts\n\nSensitivity to Qualitative Range and Expressivity Inside Movement\n\nRhythmic Awareness and Musicality\n\nIncorporation of Weight and Breath\n\nSpatial Awareness\n\nCritical Thinking\n\nSelf-Motivation and Discipline\n\nContemporary Dance Practices represent the core of our students' technical training. In all technique classes, video evaluations are recommended at the mid-term and final periods of each semester. Following these evaluations, students receive verbal and written feedback from their instructors. This process provides a method of looking at a student's progress in developing the target competencies for each level of technique.\n\nTechnique Placement Class\n\nAll entering undergraduates are usually placed into the foundation/introductory technique levels (DANC 1834, DANC 1835, DANC 1836), but may occasionally be placed in a higher level based on their audition and supplemental dance application. Adjustments to level placement may be made during the first week of classes. Returning undergraduates should consult with their faculty advisor about level placement prior to registering for classes. Students may repeat a level up to two times, and are not allowed to regress in level.\n\nFirst Semester Program Review\n\nAt the end of the first semester, each student's progress will be formally evaluated in the following categories to determine suitability for continued study within the dance program.\n\nAcademic Progress\n\nStudents must successfully complete the following dance courses:\n\nCourse List Code Title Credit Hours DANC 1801First Year Seminar in Dance1 DANC 1811Movement Improvisation I2 DANC 1813Dance Repertory I2 or DANC 1819 Dance Production DANC 1841Music for Dancers2\n\nTechnical Growth\n\nStudents must be able to demonstrate and articulate verbally a conceptual understanding of alignment, strength, and mobility.
