        "text": "Keyes Art in Sag Harbor will open a new exhibition, “Paul Davis & Peter Solow,” with a reception on Friday, April 12, from 6 to 8 p.m. The show remains on view through May 10.\n\n“Here in Sag Harbor we are often among giants in the arts, and once in a while, talent and grace go hand in hand,” said Julie Keyes, gallery owner.\n\nPaul Davis’s work has been the subject of museum and gallery exhibitions throughout the U.S., Europe and Asia, retrospectives in Japan and at the inaugural opening of Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris, and is included in many collections, among them the National Portrait Gallery and posters of MoMA.\n\nAfter graduating from the School of Visual Arts in 1959, he joined the influential Push Pin Studios, and formed the Paul Davis Studio in 1963, working in New York City and Sag Harbor on commissions for magazines, record album covers, book jackets and advertising in the U.S. and abroad. His style had a tremendous impact on the field of illustration. He was art director for Joseph Papp’s NY Shakespeare Festival, the Museum of the Moving Image, Normal and Wigwag magazines, and created works for many Eastern Long Island institutions, among them the identity for the Hampton Classic. Among his many clients are Lincoln Center, Sports Illustrated, Rolling Stone, New York Magazine, the New Yorker, Mobil Masterpiece Theater, Theatre for a New Audience and others.\n\nDavis has taught and lectured at SVA, Syracuse, and other art schools and universities. Honors include membership in the Alliance Graphique Internationale, the Halls of Fame of the Art Directors Club and the Society of Illustrators, and the Guild Hall Academy of the Arts. He is a Fellow and Resident of the American Academy in Rome.\n\nPeter Solow is a visual artist who focuses on the human figure in his work. His paintings often recreate the experience of standing in a piazza or city square, absorbing the energy of current generations as well as those that passed through centuries before. He receives great inspiration from the Italian cities of Venice and Florence where, as an art teacher at Pierson High School, he has traveled many times with his students.\n\nSolow’s work is in the permanent collection of The Metropolitan Museum of Art, The Museum of American Art-Smithsonian Institute, The Dallas Museum of Fine Arts, the Samuel P. Harn Museum and the Newark Museum. He attended Boston University, graduated from Cooper Union with a BFA and Goddard College with a Master's in Education. He has had an extensive teaching career and is the former coordinator and a present trustee of The Donald Reutershan Education Trust.\n\nKeyes Art is at 45 Main Street in Sag Harbor.
