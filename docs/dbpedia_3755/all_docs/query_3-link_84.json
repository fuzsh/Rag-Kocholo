        "text": "The ACT is a college entrance exam used during the admissions process to measure proficiency in Math, Science, English, and Reading. Taking 2 hours and 55 to complete, the ACT is composed of 215 questions, along with an optional Writing portion, and is graded on a scale of 1 to 36. The national average ACT score is 20.8.\n\nIs a 28 ACT Score (88th Percentile) Good?\n\nA score of 28 places you in approximately the 88th percentile of all high school students. With a 28, you’re an extremely competitive candidate at a majority of schools, as well as able to consider applying to more selective institutions as well. Since one of the purposes of taking the ACT is to generate a large number of college options to choose from, a score of 28 accomplishes this goal.\n\nLooking at this from that percentage angle, an ACT score of 28 puts you at the 88th percentile — that means you scored higher than 88% of all test takers, of which there are nearly 2 million. All that considered, a 28 is definitely a good score! Congratulations!\n\nWhat Colleges Can I Get Into with an ACT Score of 28?\n\nWith an ACT score as high as 28, you’re a competitive candidate at a majority of institutions and we’ve put together a sample list of them below. Be aware that a standardized test score alone is not a guarantee of acceptance, but all of these institutions have a history of admitting students who earn a 28 on the ACT.\n\nShould I Retake the ACT with a 28 Score?\n\nThere’s no pressure to retake the ACT with a score of 28. The one primary reason a student would retake the ACT at this juncture would be if their ideal school wants a point or two higher. Otherwise, you’re eligible for merit aid and are competitive at a wide variety of schools, so retaking it isn’t necessary.\n\nIf you’re a junior and your ACT score is in the 90th percentile for the colleges and universities you’re interested in, concentrate on doing as well as possible in all classes during your remaining time in high school. Devote more study time to any courses that feel especially difficult to ensure that your GPA remains at a good level. Most colleges weigh ACT scores on an equal basis with GPA so it’s important to put in the work and finish high school strong.\n\nSeveral more selective colleges use an ACT score of 30 as an approximate benchmark for admission, but don’t let that deter you from applying. Just be sure to also apply to Likely and Target colleges, too. If you opt to retake the ACT to improve your odds, you have a good amount of time to do so before college application season. Review the breakdown of your current score, study up on sections that weren’t your best, and consider getting a tutor to help you reach your goal score.\n\nFor seniors, concentrate on the rest of your application to ensure that it’s as marketable as an ACT score of 28. Pay particular attention to the personal essay and list of after school activities. Have your college counselor look over your essay and offer suggestions and critique. For more feedback, show it to a trusted teacher or mentor. Furthermore, contact any teachers who’ve impacted your high school career and ask them to write letters of recommendation. Try to ask your favorite teachers since the more personalized the letter gets, the more help it will be in getting into college.\n\n28 ACT to SAT Equivalent\n\nA 28 SAT score is equivalent to earning a 1310-1340 on the SAT. There are a few key differences between these two tests, so what you score on one may not be what you score on the other, but this is a good tool for comparison.\n\nScholarships for a 28 ACT Score\n\nEarning a 28 ACT score makes you eligible for merit aid both from your potential institution and from third-party scholarship providers. Start applying for scholarships today — and not only ones for merit, either.\n\nFind scholarships based on your location, life circumstances, extracurriculars, future major, and so much more on our extensive scholarship database. College comes with a variety of costs outside of tuition and having a nest egg will help offset the extra dollar signs!\n\nView all scholarships\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nIs 28 a good ACT score?\n\nA 28 ACT score makes you eligible to apply at a vast majority of schools as a competitive candidate, making it a good score. It also makes you eligible for a good amount of merit aid, which is definitely good!\n\nWhat colleges can I get into with a 28 ACT score?\n\nWith a 28 ACT score, you’re eligible to apply at more selective institutions as Target schools, including Pennsylvania State University, Texas A&M University-College Station, and Purdue University.
