        "text": "The New York Times Upshot / Siena College Kansas 02 Poll:\n\nDemocrat Davis 45% Republican Watkins 44%\n\nVoters Prefer Republicans Control House 49-41%; Give President Trump Positive 48-45% Job Approval Rating\n\nFavorability Ratings: Watkins, 21-26 Percent; Davis, 37-27 Percent\n\nLoudonville, NY. Democrat former State Minority Leader, Paul Davis and Republican engineer and Army veteran Steve Watkins are locked in an early too close to call race with Davis up a point, 45-44 percent, according to a new New York Times Upshot/Siena College poll of likely Kansas 2nd Congressional District voters. Watkins has a 21-26 percent favorability rating, compared to a 37-27 percent favorability rating for Davis.\n\nLikely voters in this eastern Kansas district that does not include most of the Kansas City metropolitan area prefer Republicans rather than Democrats control the House of Representatives next year by 49-41 percent. Voters give President Trump a positive job approval rating with 48 percent approving the job he is doing and 45 percent disapproving and they are evenly divided on whether or not they support an immigration reform bill that would reduce legal immigration and provide funds for a wall along the U.S.-Mexican border.\n\nThis New York Times Upshot/Siena College Poll is part of an ongoing project polling pivotal Congressional races across the country. The data is published live on https://www.nytimes.com/section/upshot. This press release highlights the key findings and provides access in the cross-tabulations to the entire survey as well as how demographic groups answered each question.\n\n# # #\n\nThis New York Times Upshot/Siena College KS 02 survey was conducted September 13-15, 2018 by telephone calls in English to 500 KS 02 voters. This poll has a margin of error of +/- 4.8 percentage points. Calls were made to a stratified weighted sample of voters from the L-2 Voter list via both land and cell phones. A likely-to-vote probability was computed for each respondent based on their stated likelihood to vote as well as by virtue of the imputation of a turnout probability score based on past voting behavior. This combined probability to vote score was applied as a weight along with a weight that considered party, age, race/ethnicity, education, region within the district and gender. Polling support for this project provided by Institute for Policy and Opinion Research at Roanoke College, Reconnaissance Market Research, M. Davis & Company, and The Public Opinion Research Lab at the University of North Florida. The Siena College Research Institute, directed by Donald Levy, Ph.D., conducts political, economic, social and cultural research primarily in NYS.
