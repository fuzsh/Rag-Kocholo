        "text": "A handful of college professors converged Thursday evening to do what they do best — share red-meat views of the dynamic political landscape in Kansas.\n\nA burning topic was the all-but-certain showdown between Republican Gov. Sam Brownback and House Democratic Leader Paul Davis in November. There is evidence through polling and fundraising that the outcome of this contest could be more compelling than the 2010 election carrying Brownback to victory.\n\n\"If Paul Davis is somewhere in the ballpark with Sam Brownback on Labor Day, two months before the general election, we're going to see the ugliest campaign in the history of the state,\" said Burdett Loomis, a professor at The University of Kansas.\n\nHe told a crowd at Washburn University a statistically close race in September would spring a tidal wave of third-party investment, mostly from conservative benefactors. The money would be earmarked for biting, dagger-framed advertising, he said.\n\nMichael Smith, a political science faculty member at Emporia State University, said the state was increasingly led by people eager to move government out of the way so religious institutions could take over.\n\n\"The religious fervor of these folks is really, really powerful,\" he said. \"It's a fundamentally different cultural view.\"\n\nBrownback, of Topeka, is considered the most conservative Kansas governor in decades. Much of his agenda is in step with Republican majorities in the House and Senate, where moderate GOP members were successfully targeted for defeat by fellow Republicans in 2010 and 2012 election cycles.\n\nEd Flentje, who has taught at Wichita State University and served in the administration of Republican Gov. Mike Hayden, said multibillion-dollar income tax cuts signed by Brownback in 2012 would erode the state's revenue stream despite a significant sales tax hike in 2013.\n\nAbout $500 million in deficit spending in the current and subsequent fiscal years will present the winner of the governor's race a bucket of red ink, he said.\n\n\"A gigantic hole going forward,\" Flentje said. \"I would describe it, not as Brownback said, as a national model for red-state governments. It's red-state radicalism. It's a high-risk experiment with the future of Kansas.\"\n\nBrownback has said his supply-side economic approach of lowering state income taxes would spur business investment, create jobs and give rise to prosperity in Kansas. He hailed falling unemployment in the state and creation of a $500 million state government surplus, which must be tapped to fund government while tax reforms take hold.\n\nWashburn professor Mark Peterson said the recent political evolution in Kansas was result of the Republican Party making the best of its financial and registered voter advantages to win elections and leave an imprint on policy.\n\nHe said the will of those casting votes at the polls for House, Senate, governor and other statewide offices was being carried out.\n\nBob Beatty, a Washburn colleague of Peterson's, said consideration ought to be given to limiting partisan political activities of the Kansas secretary of state, who serves as the state's top elections official.\n\nKris Kobach, the current holder of that office, operates a political action committee that makes donations to candidates in races he is responsible to oversee for fairness.\n\n\"If we're concerned about integrity of Kansas elections,\" Beatty said, \"there is a question that needs to be asked and addressed. On the face of it, it seems absurd to have a partisan person in charge of elections.\""
