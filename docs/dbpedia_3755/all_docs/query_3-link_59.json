        "text": "Price Villa, now called St. Cecilia’s, was constructed in 1872 for attorney and political figure John M. Price. Architect Thomas Wise and F.W. McLaughlin designed the three-story brick building in the Renaissance style with a Mansard roof and a four-story square tower. It has been a part of the Mount St. Scholastica Convent property since 1877. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in May 1972 as a good example of Italianate and Second Empire architecture. In 2003, Mount St. Scholastica Academy merged with the Benedictine monks’ Maur Hill Prep to become Maur Hill-Mount Academy. It is located at 801 S 8th Street in Atchison, Kansas.\n\nAllen Community College is a public community college with two campuses in Kansas: a main campus in Iola and another in Burlingame. Allen offers both online and in-person courses for incoming students. Allen County College, formerly known as Allen County Community College, was established in 1923. The college’s original name was the Iola Junior College, and it was a part of District 10 under the jurisdiction of the Board of Education of Iola Public Schools. Since the population of Iola was growing and there was only one main high school for residents to attend, there was a need for expansion. The college was initially designed as an expansion, added onto the third floor of Iola High School. The addition was a success, and in that first year, there was an enrollment of 93 students. This new addition, Iola Junior College, remained a part of the high school for 42 years. In June 1965, the local Board of Education successfully petitioned the State Superintendent of Public Instruction to create a countywide community college. The petition was approved; thus, Allen County Community Junior College has now separated into its own entity. The Burlingame Campus began operations in the spring of 1991 in a 7,500-square-foot building built in a cooperative venture between the City of Burlingame, the unified school district, and Allen Community College.\n\nBaker University in Baldwin City, Kansas, was founded in 1858 and named for Osman Cleander Baker, a Methodist Episcopal biblical scholar and bishop. It is the state’s oldest, continually operating institution of higher learning, was the first four-year university in Kansas, and local donations and donors raised funds from the East. It is affiliated with the United Methodist Church. It comprises four schools — the College of Arts and Sciences and the undergraduate courses in the School of Education, located on the campus in Baldwin City; the School of Professional and Graduate Studies and the graduate branch of the School of Education serve nontraditional students on campuses in Overland Park, Kansas, and online and the School of Nursing, operated in partnership with Stormont Vail Health in Topeka, offers a Bachelor of Science in Nursing and an online Master of Science in Nursing. Enrollment in all four schools has grown to a student population of more than 3,000, with about 900 students on the Baldwin City campus. Old Castle Hall, built in 1857-58, was the original home of Baker University. It now houses a museum of the university and Baldwin City. Parmenter Hall is the most recognizable building on Baker’s main campus.\n\nA Quaker college known for ministry degrees but also offers degrees in other professional fields. Since the fall of 2007, the college has offered full-tuition scholarships to students who enroll full-time and pay to live in the residence halls. Formerly called the Central Bible Training School on the site of Haviland Friends Academy, a Quaker high school. A two-year junior college course was added in 1925, and the name was changed in 1930 to Friends Bible College. By 1968, an emphasis was placed on the four-year institution, leading to the closure of the high school program and an effort to secure necessary faculty and facilities. In 1975, it received general recognition with the granting of full accreditation by the Association for Biblical Higher Education. Barclay College was renamed in 1990 to honor the first Quaker theologian, Robert Barclay.\n\nBenedictine College was established in 1971 by the merger of St. Benedict’s College (founded 1858) for men and Mount St. Scholastica College (founded 1923) for women. It is located on bluffs overlooking the Missouri River northwest of Kansas City, Missouri. Benedictine is one of several U.S. Benedictine colleges sponsored by St. Benedict’s Abbey and Mount St. Scholastica Monastery. The abbey has a population of 53 monks, while the Mount monastery has 147 community members. The college built its core values around four “pillars” — Catholic, Benedictine, Liberal Arts, and Residential — which support the Benedictine College mission to educate men and women in a community of faith and scholarship.\n\nBethel College is a private Christian college affiliated with the Mennonite Church. Founded in 1887, it is the oldest Mennonite college in North America. Bethel College became the second institution of higher learning associated with the General Conference Mennonite Church, replacing Wadsworth Institute in Ohio, which had closed in 1878. Bethel’s curriculum is founded on a general education program in the liberal arts and sciences and is geared toward students of moderate to high academic ability. There are requirements for the study of religion and cross-cultural experiences. The college offers majors in the traditional liberal arts disciplines and selected career areas – with the newest majors being software development, biochemistry, and molecular biology – and accredited professional programs in nursing, social work, and teacher education.\n\nCentral Christian College of Kansas is a private evangelical Christian college affiliated with the Free Methodist Church. It began as Orleans Seminary in Nebraska, but because of deteriorating facilities and small enrollment, the facility moved to McPherson, Kansas, in 1914. The new school was named Central Academy and College and taught elementary and high school. The college eventually added a junior college curriculum and, in 1918, was accredited by the Kansas Department of Education. In about 1939, its name was changed from Central Academy and College to Central College. In the 1950s, the name was changed again to Central College of the Free Methodist Church, and the college expanded to include a gymnasium, fine arts building, and a student center. The high school was eventually closed. In 1999, the college became Central Christian College of Kansas, and in 2000, it was officially recognized as a four-year college. It is the oldest accredited junior college in Kansas.\n\nCleveland University- Kansas City is a private university in Overland Park, Kansas. It was founded in 1922 as the Central College of Chiropractic. The school’s founders were one of the first families of chiropractic, C.S. and Ruth Cleveland, and Perl B. Griffin. All three were graduates of Palmer College of Chiropractic. After two years, Central College of Chiropractic was renamed Cleveland Chiropractic College. It is known primarily for its chiropractic doctorate program, but it also offers associate, bachelor’s, and master’s degrees. The university has occupied its current 34-acre Overland Park, Kansas, location since 2008.\n\nThis public community college is in Arkansas City, Kansas. It also operates locations in nearby Wellington, Winfield, Mulvane, and Wichita. Cowley College held its first classes on September 11, 1922. At this point, it was known as the Arkansas City Junior College and, like most junior colleges of the time, operated under the directorship of the local school district. Classes were held on the top floor of the Arkansas City High School but were soon relocated to the basement, earning it the nickname “Basement University.” In 1936, a combination auditorium-gymnasium was built, and in 1952, the school held its first classes in a dedicated college building. In addition to an online presence, the college offers on-site courses at nine area high schools. The Higher Learning Commission accredits Cowley College.\n\nThis public community college in Dodge City, Kansas, was founded in 1935. It was located on the third floor of the Senior High School Building at 1601 First Avenue for 22 years. By 1957, it had grown large enough to require a move to a different location, at 1000 Second Avenue. The college remained there for the next 13 years. In 1965, the Kansas Legislature passed legislation changing control of the state’s junior colleges from the State Board of Education to locally elected Boards. At that time, Kansas junior colleges became genuine community colleges, answerable to the citizens in their areas. Ford County voted overwhelmingly to assume responsibility for the college, and in the fall of 1965, the county elected its first board of trustees. In October 1966, due to overcrowded classrooms and the increasing need for additional occupational programs, the citizens of Ford County endorsed a $2.5 million bond. In 1970, a third version of the school opened its 35th year of operation with a new campus located on the city’s northwest edge.\n\nEmporia State University is a public university in Emporia, Kansas. It was established in March 1863 as the Kansas State Normal School. In 1923, it became the Kansas State Teachers College, and the name was changed to Emporia Kansas State College in 1974. In 1977, it became Emporia State University. The university offers degrees through seven schools, one college, and one institute: the School of Business and Technology, School of Humanities and Social Sciences, School of Library and Information Management, School of Science and Mathematics, School of Visual and Performing Arts, and School of Applied Health Sciences. Emporia State is the third-oldest public university in the state of Kansas.\n\nFort Hays State University is a public university in Hays, Kansas. It is the largest university in western Kansas and the fourth-largest of the six state universities governed by the Kansas Board of Regents, with a total enrollment of approximately 15,100 students. It was founded in 1902 as the Western Branch of Kansas State Normal School, now called Emporia State University. The institution was initially located on the grounds of Fort Hays, a frontier military outpost that closed in 1889. The university served the early settlers’ needs for educational facilities in the new region. The first building closer to Hays was completed in 1904 when the university moved to its present location. It was first founded as an agricultural-based school but was then determined to be a normal school. The main campus is 200 acres and includes more than 40 limestone-faced buildings. The campus is just west of the Hays business district, two miles south of Interstate 70.\n\nThis public community college in Garden City, Kansas, was established in 1919 to provide a means for post-secondary education for area residents. It was created by county-wide election on April 1, 1919, and opened in September of the same year. The school initially shared facilities in Sabine Hall and Calkins Hall in the 100 block of Buffalo Jones Avenue with Garden City High School and opened with a first class of less than three dozen students. The college moved to the then-new Garden City High School building in 1954. The Kansas Legislature passed the Community College Act in 1965, authorizing the establishment of 22 independent colleges, including Garden City Community College. Today, it is one of 19 Kansas community colleges.\n\nHaskell Indian Nations University is a public tribal land-grant university in Lawrence, Kansas. Founded in 1884 as a residential boarding school for Native American children of federally recognized Native American tribes in the United States. When Haskell opened in 1884, it was called the United States Indian Industrial Training School. It had 22 elementary school-age students in the first year. In 1887, the school was renamed Haskell Institute in honor of Dudley Haskell, the U.S. representative from Kansas’s 2nd district who had worked to build the school in Lawrence. In the early 20th century, Haskell continued to evolve, adding classes for upper grades, and in 1927 received accreditation as a Kansas high school. By 1935, it was classified as a vocational-technical school. With more curriculum development, it was renamed Haskell Indian Junior College in 1967 and was able to award associate degrees and certificates in special skills programs. By the late 1980s, planning began to develop the institution as a four-year, bachelor-degree granting university. In 1993, the development was built on the expansion of the curricula and programs, and it was renamed Haskell Indian Nations University. Initially, Haskell offered its first four-year baccalaureate program in elementary teacher education. Within a few years, Haskell had developed its own specialized bachelor’s degree program in American Indian Studies, and Business Administration and Environmental Sciences degree programs soon followed. Operated by the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs, it offers associate and baccalaureate degrees. Approximately 140 Tribal nations and Alaska Native communities are represented at Haskell. While the school does not charge tuition, students are responsible for paying yearly fees. Twelve campus buildings have been designated as U.S. National Historic Landmarks. It is the oldest continually operating federal school for American Indians.\n\nThis school was initially established for the Sac and Fox Nation under the Presbyterian Church in Highland, Kansas. The origins of the school date back to 1837.\n\nIn the late 19th century, the noted scientist, botanist, educator, and inventor George Washington Carver was accepted at Highland College. When he arrived, however, they refused to let him attend because of his race.\n\nHighland University was founded in November 1857 as the Presbyterian Academy. By December, the board had voted to establish Highland University in place of the academy to satisfy the founders’ goal for Highland to become an Educational and Religious center for the new territories. In 1858, it became Highland University; in 1910, it was renamed Highland College. It was renamed Northeast Kansas Junior College in 1922, became Highland Public Junior College in 1937, Doniphan County Junior College in 1959, and Highland Community Junior College in 1965. The college considers Highland University the precursor to Highland Community College, making it the first college in Kansas.\n\nThis public community college in Hutchinson, Kansas, was established in the spring of 1928 as Hutchinson Junior College and held its first classes that fall. On July 1, 1965, the name was changed to Hutchinson Community Junior College, then in 1980 to Hutchinson Community College. On July 1, 1993, it was renamed Hutchinson Community College and Area Vocational School after a merger with the local vocational school. In 2012, the vocational school addition was removed, and the institution finally became known as Hutchinson Community College. The main campus is in Hutchinson, with two satellite locations in McPherson and Newton, Kansas. Students can choose from more than 70 academic programs, leading to Associate in Arts and Associate in Science degrees. Hutchinson Community College has transfer and articulation agreements with every Kansas Regents university and college, as well as a variety of other institutions across the country. It also offers over 50 technical programs. It serves nearly 5,000 credit students every semester.\n\nThis public community college in Independence, Kansas, was formerly Independence Community Junior College. It was established in 1925 as grades 13 and 14 of the Independence public school system. In 1967, Independence Community College was legally separated from the school district. Construction of the new community college on a 68-acre campus began in 1969. Classes at the new site began in September 1970. The campus is now home to the Academic Building, Fine Arts Building, Student Union, Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurship, Field House, Administration Building, William Inge Center for the Arts, fitness center, athletic practice fields, disc golf course, 96-bed multi-structure living complex, a 200-bed residence hall, and a 135-bed suite-style residence hall. In 2010, a former large retail space was donated next to the local Wal-Mart. The campus is located on the west side of Independence and is home to Allied Health, Cosmetology, Veterinary Technology, and Culinary.\n\nThis public community college in Overland Park, Kansas, in Johnson County, was established in 1972. In 1963, Johnson County Commissioners, recognizing the emerging community college movement and seeking to accommodate the rapidly growing population of Johnson County, formed a committee to examine the feasibility of forming an institution in Johnson County. The college was formally established following a successful county-wide election held in March 1967. The existing campus was made possible in 1969 after Johnson County voters approved $12.9 million in bonds to purchase 200 acres of land in Overland Park.
