While hiking Colorado's 14ers during my first summer of medical school, I fell in love with the state and decided that I wanted to shape my career to allow me to practice in a rural, mountainous setting. I am thrilled to have the chance to live and train in the wonderfully unique location of Grand Junction. The setting will allow me to pursue all of my interests in medicine, including training in a broad array of skills for my future rural practice and building my experience in obstetrics, including applying for a surgical obstetrics fellowship, while using my free time to pursue my hobbies of hiking, climbing and skiing.\n\nCreed Ott, MD\n\nI was born and raised in rural Minnesota. I grew up blue collar and spent about a decade working in construction, both before and during college. I went to Minnesota State University Moorhead and majored in Athletic Training. I then went to the University of Minnesota for medical school. During my fourth year of medical school, I did a month long rotation in Grand Junction and loved it! I felt at home with the awesome residents, faculty and staff. Outside of medicine, I enjoy human powered adventure. My better half, Laura is a PT at St. Mary’s and we are thrilled to call Grand Junction home and embark on this adventure together.\n\nQuinn Rufsvold, MD\n\nI grew up in the tiny town of Fort Ransom, ND, spending most of my time biking around town or skiing/snowboarding on the local ski hill (emphasis on the hill). I received my B.S in Biology and Medical Doctorate from the University of North Dakota. After experiencing a few too many extreme winters and a longing for a wider variety of terrain, a move west for residency seemed like the right choice. I greatly enjoy taking care of patients in the outpatient setting and am working to become certified in HIV care. When not at work you can find me snowboarding, kayaking, hiking, trail running or attempting to mountain bike.\n\nKellum Schneider, MD\n\nDr. Kellum Schneider grew up in a small town in western Kansas. He majored in genetics and ran track for the University of Kansas. Being a loyal Jayhawk, he also went to medical school at KU. He enjoys full spectrum medicine but has a special interest in sports medicine and point-of-care ultrasound. When not at work, you can find him running or playing with his two golden retrievers.\n\nTiffany Smith, MD\n\nI grew up in Littleton and Parker, both of which are in the Denver area of Colorado. My Dad is a Pastor so I was in an environment that exposed me to what it looks like to serve the people in my community. When college came around, I left my home state to attend Bob Jones University in Greenville, South Carolina. My junior year of college I was able to go to Peru on a medical trip which was an eye-opening experience in my life that solidified the fact that I needed to pursue a career in medicine. I attended the University Of South Carolina School Of Medicine in Columbia. It was there that I established my passion for Family Medicine. When I interviewed at Grand Junction, I was thrilled to find a program that supported my passions of an educational environment for patients, an emphasis on preventative medicine and behavioral health, and a belief in the value of continuity of care. I am overjoyed to be back in the beautiful State of Colorado! In my free time, I feel like the possibilities in this State are endless for what I can do – but to name a few, I like to spend time with my fiancé going camping, rock climbing, SUP boarding, and hiking.\n\nKaitlin Tennyson, MD\n\nThis newly transplanted Kansas girl grew up on 6 acres and a pond 15 miles outside the bustling city of Wichita, KS. I attended Southwestern College in Winfield, KS where I played college basketball (Go Lady Builders!) and studied Biology. Following this, I went to medical school at the University of Kansas School of Medicine in Salina, KS… Rock chalk! I entered medical school with an open mind about what type of career I would want to pursue, but knew all along that Family Medicine was my calling. I am absolutely elated to join the St. Mary’s Residency team because of the amazing people who work here, their emphasis on broad scope training and behavioral health, and c’mon…. Umm the mountains!! In my free time, I enjoy playing sports, hiking, fishing and just being outside in nature. I can’t wait to explore this new area and experience all that the Grand Junction community has to offer.\n\nKelsey Walsdorf, MD\n\nI grew up in southern Louisiana, just outside of New Orleans where I enjoyed outdoor activities, such as boating and fishing and of course love seafood!

I went to medical school at Louisiana State University School of Medicine in New Orleans where I fell in love with full scope family medicine including obstetrics. My passions include riding horses, hiking, skiing, and pretty much anything outside. I really enjoy all of the outdoor adventure opportunities the Grand Valley and surrounding areas have to offer.\n\nTirzah Wethern, MD\n\nI grew up in the vast tundra that is Fargo, ND, and ohhhhh boy do I have an accent (how do you say bag?). After completing my undergraduate and Medical Doctorate degrees in my home state at the University of North Dakota, I happily relocated to the Western Slope to complete my Family Medicine Residency at St. Mary’s. I enjoy practicing medicine both inpatient and outpatient, and I have a particular interest in the field of Addiction Medicine. Outside of work you can find me in the great outdoors running, hiking, skiing, and enjoying time with my better half and our two fur-babies.\n\nLisa Ayala, MD\n\nAs a small town farm girl & daughter of a veterinarian in NE Kansas - I learned medicine early working with my father. Through various community service projects & mission trips with my church I found working with & serving others is a passion I couldn’t ignore. I received a Bachelor’s in Human & Molecular Biology from College of the Ozarks in Branson, MO, I also found my husband & “partner in crime” Sergio. After college we returned to the flatlands for medical school at the University Of Kansas School Of Medicine in Salina, KS. We decided to join St. Mary’s Residency because of the broad scope of training, & the family oriented community between residents & faculty. The scenery definitely didn’t hurt our decision! My husband & I enjoy gardening, cooking, raising our 3 goldfish, & exploring the area.\n\nRyan Gillum, MD\n\nI was born in Fort Collins, CO & went to college in Boulder at the University of Colorado where I studied Anthropology. After graduating I moved to Costa Rica to work as a whitewater raft guide. I lived there for five years spending my free time volunteering in the local clinics where I developed a passion for medicine & helping underserved populations. I decide a career in healthcare was what I wanted to do with the rest of my life & came back to Colorado to study medicine at the University of Colorado. I’m excited to be in Grand Junction to continue my training & to spend my free time mountain biking, backpacking, & climbing around the Western slope of this state that I love & call home.\n\nKevin Johnson, MD\n\nI grew up in Farmington, Utah then went to Brigham Young University to study Genetics & Biotechnology.

Like most Coloradans my passions lie in the outdoors, but my particular interests are fly-fishing, backpacking & skiing. I attended the University of Northern Colorado for undergrad, & loved studying biology. My interest in science & desire to serve others led me into medicine. My adventure continued in Up-state New York, at Albany Medical College. Between studying & clinicals I explored the beautiful Catskill & Adirondack Mountains (hills compared to the Rockies but gorgeous in their own right). It was a combination of wanting to practice broad spectrum medicine & the desire to serve a small mountain community that led me into family practice. I am so excited to be a part of the wonderful community here in Grand Junction & to explore everything the beautiful western slope has to offer!\n\nKishan Patel, MD\n\nI grew up in India & moved to Farmville, VA at the age of 15.

I worked through undergrad at Texas A&M as a welder/ construction worker & continue to love working with my hands. I moved to downtown Houston where I attended McGovern Medical School. While training there, in the largest medical center in the world, I learned my love for rural medicine, preventative medicine & the effect consistent primary care can have on a community’s well-being. My first visit to the state of Colorado was my interview with St. Mary’s where I fell in love with the area. I love to hike & read novels in nature.

In my free time, I enjoy hiking, camping, floating/rafting rivers, live music, golfing, reading, & playing the piano.\n\nGraduate Testimonials\n\nWhat do Graduates have to say?\n\nA Letter from Dr. Ryan Jackman, Graduate doing Addiction Medicine Fellowship in Denver, CO\n\n\"Thank You\" is probably not enough to tell you how grateful I am for the environment at the residency. As I look back at who I was before residency and who I have become over the past 3 years I am humbled, grateful and amazed.\n\nMed School was an experience to say the least, and I did wonder if it had changed my fun loving self and sense of humor for the worse, but then I came to Grand Junction and a residency that felt more like family than work and I began to find myself again. Thank you for showing me how much fun medicine can be while helping me to take care of what is most important to me - my faith and family! Thank you for teaching medicine in a way that is memorable and not daunting. Not only have I survived the system and the process, but I've learned how to learn and enjoy this job. Than you for trusting me and my opinion, and for mentoring me along the way. Most of all thank you for being a friend. I am proud to be one of your residents.\n\nA letter from Jennifer Surber, Graduate in Rifle, CO (population 4,636)\n\nThanks for everything!\n\nIt was odd saying goodbye to people last night at Graduation, not really as definitive as I'd imagined. But maybe that is a good thing.\n\nI want you all to know that you are so appreciated. Each of you have fantastically unique personalities, areas of expertise, and special types of wisdom to share. I wanted to say thanks to you for being solid in your dedication to mentoring and remaining available to us residents. So - get away once in a while and recharge--because we need you! You are this residency! You are invaluable. I also hope that you enjoyed our class as much as we did. We are proud of ourselves for what we valued, what we accomplished and for being privileged now to go out and represent this program to the world. While perhaps none of us were exemplary 100% of the time, I think we all feel like we were a dedicated class who worked well together and who respected the program and tried to uphold its strong reputation.\n\nSo I may call you one day with an absurd question, a tale of 'medical adventure' that makes you cringe or sigh in relief at a close call, but know that it is you all who gave me this daring and courage to go out and PRACTICE medicine as best I can. And I will work hard to keep learning, keep caring, and live up to your expectations as well as my own. Thank you, and not so much good-bye!\n\nA conversation with Rob Anderson, Graduate in Polacca, AZ (population 1108)\n\n\"For the most part everything in my world has been going pretty well. The job is good even if it is a little challenging from time to time. I feel as though I have had superb training for the job that I am doing. Although every once in a while I feel as though I am encountering something that I haven't before, I can't imagine a more comprehensive training program than the residency. I am thankful and grateful to everyone there. The people within the residency really make it what it is. I am thankful for the care that was given on so many different levels.\n\nI appreciate the broad spectrum approach to medicine that allows for the health of the physician itself. All of the precepting physicians have lives outside of medicine and understand the need for this in order to maintain a realistic perspective on medicine. The cool thing is that the preceptors maintain compassion and phenomenal clinical skills. This definitely trickles down to the residents.\n\nThe residents at the program tend to be a great group of down to earth physicians who want to make profound differences in the world. Without a doubt they are some of the most beautiful people that I have ever met. The process of learning skills in residency on the road to becoming a better physician can be fraught with peril...the residency did a fantastic job at recognizing that the process must be tempered by \"humanness\".\n\nI can't imagine doing residency training in a more beautiful setting than the Western Slope of Colorado. There are so many fantastic things to do. The mountain biking, skiing, hiking, camping, and climbing are world class. The scope of training was extraordinarily broad spectrum. I was able to do some appendectomies, C-sections and tons of scopes.\n\nThank you for everything.\"\n\nA conversation with Eric Maki, Graduate, Ontonagon, MI (population 7,775)\n\n\"There are so many times I look back and think about my training here and how much it helped to prepare me and how well prepared I feel in moving to this rural area. I often hear little voices in my head from each of the faculty members who have told me various pearls over the years. The orthopedic training, the rural experiences, the emergency medicine experiences and all the attending faculty are outstanding. My practice just hired a graduating resident from a \"very rural oriented residency\", he is nowhere near as well prepared as I was. I would be more than happy to talk to any applicants or residents thinking of going into rural practice\".\n\nDuring his residency, he felt that \"training was appropriately onerous\" but he felt supported as a human being. The time commitments that were asked of him were necessary and he never felt like a \"scut monkey\". The other best part about residency was the autonomy that he experienced here \"even our specialists are willing to let us do some things versus just watch.\"\n\nQuotes from Former Residents\n\n\"I was treated like family with love and respect. That was key for me. The thing I love best besides the excellent training was the attending physicians. I felt like I learned an incredible amount, but had a lot of fun doing it. There is a good balance not only in the medical training itself, but also between personal well-being.\" Raphael Allred, Graduate (Klamath Falls, OR)\n\n\"The Internal Medicine training was very solid. I'm probably the best prepared in my group. During residency, we are able to develop a very personal practice and this continues on here after residency. The autonomy helped to prepare me for practice. The residency was my surrogate family. There was definite camaraderie\" Grant Wang, Graduate (Santa Cruz, CA)"
