        "text": "Recommended Programs by Discipline\n\nFeeling overwhelmed? Need a place to start? Here is a little more information on well regarded programs. Programs are categorized by discipline, and are in alphabetical order.\n\nBiology and Ecology, Evolution & Behavior\n\nThis section includes more traditional biology programs and programs specifically focused towards Ecology, Evolution and Behavior. These programs were recommended by Professors Mark Davis and Jerald Dosch.\n\nCornell University\n\nThe Field attempts to provide comprehensive training in ecology and evolutionary biology primarily leading to a Ph.D. degree. Specific subject areas and concentrations include: Ecology (animal ecology, applied ecology, biogeochemistry, community and ecosystem ecology, limnology, oceanography, physiological ecology, plant ecology, population ecology, theoretical ecology, vertebrate zoology) and Evolutionary Biology (ecological genetics, paleobiology, population biology, Evolutionary Biology). The collective specializations of the faculty present a student with a considerable depth of experience in most areas of ecology and evolutionary biology. Beyond this, Cornell’s Biological Sciences is one of the leading groups of its kind in the United States. www.eeb.cornell.edu/field/EEB.html\n\nDuke University\n\nThe Department of Biology offers a diverse and integrative graduate program for students seeking the Ph.D. in the biological sciences. The department provides training opportunities in the following broad range of research areas: ecology (including behavioral ecology, population biology, community ecology, physiological ecology, ecosystem analysis, and biogeochemistry), cell and molecular biology (including cellular physiology, molecular genetics, developmental biology, developmental genetics, genomics, and bioinformatics, in both plant and animal systems), functional organismal biology (including comparative physiology, functional morphology, biomechanics, and animal behavior), and evolutionary biology (including morphology, biomechanics, and animal behavior), and evolutionary biology (including population genetics, evolutionary ecology, evolutionary morphology, macroevolution, biogeography, and systematics). Faculty also participate in the university programs in Cell and Molecular Biology, Genetics, Ecology, and Developmental Biology. These programs link researchers across different departments and schools at Duke, most notably the basic sciences departments in the Duke University Medical Center and the Nicholas School of the Environment and Earth Sciences. biology.duke.edu/graduate/degree-programs\n\nStanford University\n\nThe PhD program trains students for careers in research and teaching. In addition to a wide range of courses, the PhD program offers informal but intensive instruction in laboratories and seminars, characterized by close contact between students and their faculty advisors.

We work with animals, plants and other organisms employing molecular and organismal approaches to questions of biological organization and diversity. Our work spans the levels of the biological hierarchy from molecules to ecosystems. The research of several of our faculty and the content of many of our courses deal specifically with the origins and biology of humans and our relationship to other life forms on this planet. ib.berkeley.edu\n\nUniversity of California-Davis\n\nThe University of California, Davis is one of the nation’s premier institutions in the Biological Sciences. It has an exceptionally strong and diverse faculty in Ecology and the Environmental and Agricultural Sciences. Prospective applicants have the opportunity to complete graduate degrees through separate graduate groups in a number of areas. Graduate Groups in Ecology, Animal Behavior, Plant Biology, and Population Biology are the four that are of principal interest to students in the area of Ecology. www.eve.ucdavis.edu/graduate.html\n\nUniversity of Montana\n\nIn addition to M.S. degrees in biochemistry, microbiology, organismal biology and ecology, and wildlife biology (in cooperation with the School of Forestry), the Division of Biological Sciences offers the Ph.D. degree. Graduate studies within the division are organized into two programs, Integrative Microbiology & Biochemistry and Organismal Biology and Ecology. Students may specialize in a broad array of subjects including avian biology, biochemistry, conservation biology, ecology and behavior, evolutionary genetics, microbial ecology, microbiology (environmental and medical), molecular biology and others. The doctoral degrees are identified as either Integrative Microbiology & Biochemistry or Organismal Biology and Ecology.\n\nGraduate students do thesis and dissertation research in on-campus facilities and at the biological station on Flathead Lake north of campus. Other options for research sites include a variety of local biotech company laboratories, the NIH-USPH Rocky Mountain Research Laboratory in Hamilton, and a variety of field sites. www.umt.edu/grad/Programs/Biological%20Sciences.php\n\nUniversity of Washington\n\nThe Biology Department at the University of Washington is ideal for the student seeking a world-class graduate education in a department without boundaries between disciplines. Graduate training in our department prepares students for careers in academia, private research institutes, government agencies, and non-governmental organizations requiring expertise in the biological sciences. The more than 50 faculty and ca. 100 graduate students within our department have research interests that span a wide taxonomic range of study organisms (plants, animals, fungi, ‘protists’) at all levels of organization (molecular, cellular, organismal, ecosystem), using a variety of theoretical and experimental approaches in the laboratory and in the field. Weekly departmental seminars bring in prominent researchers to meet with faculty and graduate students. The opportunity for graduate students to develop a personalized interdisciplinary program of study is unparalleled. Click here for details on faculty research areas. www.biology.washington.edu/programs/graduate\n\nUniversity of Wisconsin-Madison\n\nThe Department of Wildlife Ecology had its origin in 1933 when the University of Wisconsin-Madison created a Chair in Game Management for Professor Aldo Leopold. Six years later, Leopold formed the Department of Wildlife Management, the first academic department in the world ever dedicated specifically to the emerging field of wildlife management.\n\nIn 1966, the present Department name was adopted because ecology rather than management more appropriately described the Department’s emphasis in research and teaching. wildlife.wisc.edu\n\nUniversity of Wisconsin-Stevens Point\n\nDiversity and balance of faculty specialties contribute to the quality of the Biology Department. Members specialize in areas of zoology, botany, microbiology, genetics, physiology and ecology. www.uwsp.edu/biology/Pages/Programs/GradProgs.aspx\n\ntop of page\n\nEconomics\n\nThis section includes primarily programs with Ph.D. programs in economics.

Their MS is basically the first two years of PhD work, which is very different from the needs and expectations of a lot of students wanting to do an environmental science/policy degree; but it works as a joint degree with something else, and can be a fall-back option for a student who decides they want out of the PhD track.\n\nUniversity of California-Santa Barbara\n\nBren School of Environmental Science & Management in Santa Barbara, CA. www.bren.ucsb.edu/about\n\nUniversity of Colorado at Boulder\n\nUniversity of Colorado at Boulder’s graduate program in environmental studies, which explicitly combines science and the study of decisionmaking. www.colorado.edu/envs/graduate-students\n\nUniversity of Delaware\n\nThe Center for Energy & Environmental Policy at the University of Delaware has a master of energy & environmental policy. There is a science/engineering requirement. Approximately 40 percent of admitted students have prior degrees in a science or engineering discipline. ceep.udel.edu/academic-progra/graduate-programs/\n\nUniversity of East Anglia\n\nThe Environmental Science Faculty at the University of East Anglia offers several Masters levels degrees that would satisfy the joint interest. www.uea.ac.uk/env\n\nUniversity of Michigan\n\nThe University of Michigan has excellent Masters and PhD programs in its School of Natural Resources and\n\nEnvironment. www.snre.umich.edu\n\nUniversity of Oregon\n\nBuilding on the University of Oregon’s long tradition of environmental research and activism, their program sets the standard in interdisciplinary dialogue and collaboration with more than 100 participating faculty from thirty campus programs and departments. ENVS degree programs are flexible and tailored to meet specific educational and career goals, providing students with the opportunities to work alongside world-class scholars and researchers, develop concrete skills and analytical abilities, and gain hands-on experience relevant to careers in government agencies, non-governmental organizations, private industry, and academic fields. envs.uoregon.edu\n\nUniversity of Vermont\n\nThe University of Vermont’s Rubenstein School of Environment and Natural Resources. www.uvm.edu/rsenr\n\nUniversity of Wisconsin, Madison\n\nThe University of Wisconsin, Madison’s Nelson Institute for Environmental Studies offers a wide range of MA programs that can combine science & policy. www.nelson.wisc.edu\n\nWageningen University\n\nIf you are interested in studying in the Netherlands, check out the various programs of Wageningen University. The MSc Environmental Sciences has a specialization in Environmental Policy (www.mes.wur.nl). Since this program gives a lot of freedom for students to chose their own courses, you can develop your own program in which you combine environmental sciences with courses in environmental policy (see www.enp.wur.nl for a list of environmental policy courses you can choose from).\n\nYale University\n\nYale University’s School of Forestry and Environmental Studies offers interdisciplinary master’s degrees; a Masters of Environmental Management and a Masters of Environmental Science, both of which combine science and policy. environment.yale.edu\n\ntop of page\n\nEnvironmental Studies\n\nYes, you can go to graduate school in Environmental Studies! Programs range from specifically Environmental Studies to programs that embody the philosophy of Environmental Studies. Recommended by Professor Roopali Phadke.\n\nUniversity of California-Los Angeles\n\nProducing geographers of high quality is the principal goal of the graduate program, designed primarily for students pursuing the Ph.D degree. The Master of Arts degree, which involves coursework and a thesis, serves as an essential building-block of the doctoral program. The doctorate is awarded to those students who have achieved the level of geographical knowledge and training required of a professional geographer. The degree recognizes the ability of students to make scholarly contributions in their fields of specialization and to undertake advanced research in those areas. Students can ‘major’ in Environmental Studies. www.geog.ucla.edu\n\nUniversity of California-Santa Cruz\n\nThe program draws principally from two areas of knowledge: ecology and social science. Our interests in ecology include conservation biology and global change ecology (the maintenance of biodiversity and ecosystem processes, and reducing human impacts on other species) and agroecology (where ecological knowledge is used to inform human management of nature for the production of natural products for human use in ways that minimize environmental impacts). Our interests in social science bridge the dimension between environmental policy analysis (which looks for the best management strategies within the frame of existing social institutions and practices) and political economy of the environment (which examines the deeper social processes through which the institutions that structure our social and ecological agendas have been constructed). These all are historically independent fields and UCSC’s program is one of the first to link them.\n\nGraduates of the program are expected to be informed in all of these fields, to have deep intellectual strength in their area of specialty, and to have made substantial contributions toward the understanding of an environmental problem. We expect our doctoral students to be as skilled and intellectually rigorous within their research emphasis as are students emerging from more traditional departments and also to possess the knowledge needed to understand, analyze, and communicate in different but highly relevant fields of study. This expectation of intellectual breadth as well as disciplinary depth is a central goal of our doctoral program. envs.ucsc.edu/graduate\n\nUniversity of Colorado-Boulder\n\nThe graduate program of the Department of Geography offers both M.A. and Ph.D degrees. The program’s basic purpose is to train scholars and professionals to produce and disseminate knowledge and to make outstanding contributions in the public and private sectors. admissions.colorado.edu/graduate/programs/geography\n\nUniversity of Michigan\n\nAt the School of Natural Resources and Environment, our approach to environmental education and research has evolved to mirror the complexities of the environmental issues that confront us. We understand our natural and physical environment is an intertwined, multifaceted system, and approach our pedagogy the same way. While we are grounded in robust environmental research, we expand our thinking and approach beyond the confines of traditional environmental education and draw upon other disciplines – public health, architecture, business, law – to develop ways to manage and conserve our natural resources. www.snre.umich.edu\n\nUniversity of Montana-Missoula\n\nThe Environmental Studies Program (EVST) was established as a graduate program in 1969. Our objectives are to improve the quality of life and to protect our planet. To move towards those objectives, sensitive and innovative approaches to environmental problems are required. Our approach is interdisciplinary, stressing environmental science, environmental policy and environmental thought and literature. After taking a core course in each of these areas, students design a course of study based upon their interests and needs. Protecting the earth and planet requires more than interdisciplinary thinking; informed “activism” is also necessary. EVST requires every student to complete a course in activism. Our interdisciplinary-activist emphasis is unique among graduate programs. While we have had two Rhodes Scholars in the last decade, we are equally proud of the habitat saved, wilderness gained, waters protected, roads obliterated, and toxin discharges reduced, through the leadership efforts of EVST grads. www.umt.edu/grad/default.php\n\nYale University\n\nThe Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies recognizes that it is as important to solve problems for local watersheds as it is to address issues related to global climate change. Likewise, it is as important to coach tomorrow’s leaders to get their hands dirty with fieldwork as it is to train them to analyze and formulate policy. To address the breadth and scope of such a wide range of environmental challenges, the faculty of the School of Forestry & Environmental Studies created nine focal areas through which to channel teaching and research. Some of these focal areas are new, and some have been at the heart of the School’s mission for a century. At the core of each area is the goal of facilitating outstanding teaching, research, and outreach. Each focal area has a core group of faculty as its keystone. These faculty members, led by a coordinator from the School’s senior faculty, teach classes, guide students, and conduct research to meet the goals set forth by the mission statement of their focal areas. Most faculty are involved with more than one focal area. Focal areas include, Ecology, Ecosystems, and Biodiversity, The Social Ecology of Conservation and Development: Assessing Social and Environmental Change, Forestry, Forest Science, and the Management of Forests for Conservation and Development, Global Change Science and Policy, Environment, Health, and Policy, Industrial Environmental Management, Policy, Economics, and Law, Urban Ecology and Environmental Design, and Water Science, Policy, and Management. environment.yale.edu\n\ntop of page\n\nGeology\n\nProfessor Kelly MacGregor recommends the following geology programs.\n\nDuke University\n\nThe mission of the Division of Earth and Ocean Sciences is research and education focused on a description and understanding of the processes that affect the behavior of the Earth’s surface, its oceans, climate, and interior. The Division faculty advise and teach PhD students and undergraduates, and are engaged in advising and teaching professional master’s degree (MEM, CEM) students in programs focusing on global change, coastal environments, and energy and resources. www.nicholas.duke.edu/eos\n\nUniversity of California-Santa Cruz\n\nThe department of Earth Sciences at the University of California, Santa Cruz, offers both master’s and doctoral programs. By developing habits of critical analysis and thorough documentation, as well as skills in field, laboratory, and theoretical investigation, the graduate programs in Earth sciences prepare students for productive careers in research, teaching or industry.
