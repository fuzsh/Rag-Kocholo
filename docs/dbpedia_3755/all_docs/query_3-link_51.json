different than 2023.

For 2024 we utilized our Concentrated Influence algorithm, designed to take away the size advantage larger schools have when we rank their faculty and alumniâs academic influence. Concentrated influence highlights smaller schools that are proportionally as successful as larger universities at cultivating influential alumni and faculty.\n\nFriends University\n\nMidAmerica Nazarene University\n\nSouthwestern College\n\nOttawa University\n\nBethel College\n\nBenedictine College\n\nKansas Wesleyan University\n\nTabor College\n\nPittsburg State University\n\nMcPherson College\n\nEmporia State University\n\nSterling College\n\nNewman University, Wichita\n\nFort Hays State University\n\nBethany College\n\nUniversity of Saint Mary\n\nCheck out our directory of liberal arts colleges throughout the U.S. for a look at the top liberal arts schools in every state.\n\nDo you have a question about this topic?
