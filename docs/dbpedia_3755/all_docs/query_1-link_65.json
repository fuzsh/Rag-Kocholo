        "text": "Kellie Griffin, M.D.\n\nHometown: Wichita, KS\n\nCollege University of Kansas\n\nMedical School: University of Kansas - Wichita\n\nWhy KU?: I picked KU because this program values you as an individual and works hard to support your personal and professional growth. I liked how well the residents got along and KU has a good work-life balance. I love living in Kansas City, too. There are so many local restaurants/breweries/distilleries to explore and everyone has pride in the CHIEFS!\n\nKimberly Hughes, M.D.\n\nHometown: Olathe, KS\n\nCollege: Kansas State University\n\nMedical School: University of Kansas School of Medicine\n\nWhy KU: After I became interested in anesthesia during my third year, I shadowed a resident in the program and realized very quickly that I wanted to stay at KU. Everyone was welcoming and excited to teach. As a Kansas City native it was comforting to know that I wouldn't have to leave my biological family to find a residency family. I am so happy to have matched here and already can't wait for CA-1 year to start!\n\nEric Krause, M.D.\n\nHometown: St. Louis, Missouri\n\nCollege: Missouri Southern State University\n\nMedical School: University of Missouri - Columbia\n\nWhy KU?: I was drawn to KU by the warm, collegial atmosphere I experienced during my interview as well as the complexity and variety of cases the program offers. KU seems to strike a balance between being a large academic referral center, while having a relatively smaller class size where education and case experiences can be tailored to the residents' interests and needs.\n\nKwabena Lartey, MBChB\n\nHometown: Kumasi, Ghana\n\nCollege: Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology, Kumasi, Ghana\n\nMedical School: Kwame Nkrumah University\n\nWhy KU?: I learned about the excellent quality of the KU residency program from alumni, and the collegiality between residents, staff and faculty. Further, I was attracted to KU by their global health anesthesia program, coming from a global health background myself. Matching at KU was one of the best days of my life!\n\nJohn Lawson, M.D.\n\nHometown: Rochester, MN\n\nCollege: University of Missouri â€“ Columbia\n\nMedical School: University of Kansas School of Medicine\n\nWhy KU?: I was very fortunate to have exposure to the program as a medical student here at KU. All the residents and faculty were always so friendly, welcoming, and supportive. I felt confident that staying for residency meant I would be surrounded by incredible friends and mentors that would support me in any way possible!\n\nDerrick Meisenheimer, M.D.\n\nHometown: Oak Grove, MO\n\nCollege: University of Central Missouri\n\nMedical School: University of Missouri - Columbia\n\nWhy KU?: I grew up near Kansas City and was always aware of the great reputation that KUMC holds, which is what initially drew me to the program. However, what sold me was my experience during my away rotation. I could tell that the staff I worked with truly loved teaching and working with residents, and it was very apparent that the residents liked the program and each other. The location was also a big factor in my decision, as Kansas City and the surrounding area has a lot to offer and has always been home to my family and I.\n\nNicole Ost, M.D.\n\nHometown: Overland Park, KS\n\nCollege: University of Denver\n\nMedical School: University of Kansas School of Medicine\n\nWhy KU?: I knew early on in medical school that I wanted to stay at KU! This program offers the case volumes and complexity for excellent clinical training, as well as mentors that truly care about resident teaching and patient care. It is important to find a program that provides the support needed to not just get through residency, but to excel, and I found that at KU.\n\nJoel Seaton, M.D.\n\nHometown: Overland Park\n\nCollege: Rockhurst University\n\nMedical School: University of Kansas - Wichita\n\nWhy KU?: I've had a long history at KUMC having been an anesthesia technician prior to medical school. I was incredibly impressed with the kindness and respect shown to patients, colleagues, and ancillary employees by the Anesthesiology staff and residents. Also, the warm and welcoming culture, along with the robust Regional program, helped to confirm KU as my choice for residency.\n\nZachary Theiler\n\nHometown: Metamora, IL\n\nCollege: University of Iowa\n\nMedical School: Kansas City University\n\nWhy KU?: I knew KU was the right place for me when I did my rotation here as a fourth-year medical student. This experience exposed me to the positive culture and people across the department and see increasingly complex cases often referred to the hospital. Additionally, my wife and I both love the size and numerous opportunities in Kansas City. In our free time, we like taking our dog, Archer, swimming at different parks, trying new restaurants/coffee shops, or going to Sporting or Chiefs games.\n\nHadi Zayed, M.D.\n\nHometown: Wichita, KS\n\nCollege: Wichita State University\n\nMedical School: University of Kansas School of Medicine\n\nWhy KU?: As a medical student, I had the privilege of rotating through KU's anesthesia department and loved the staff and experience I received. The anesthesia staff were warm and welcoming. The program is robust and offers every experience you would want in a program. I was confident that I could become the best version of myself if I was given the opportunity to train at KU."
