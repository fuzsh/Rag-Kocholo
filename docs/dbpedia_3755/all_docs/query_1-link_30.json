Kelsey later transitioned into a rapid paced urgent care, treating a variety of medical illnesses. With a desire to create meaningful relationships with patients of all ages, she is excited to further her career with Primary Care Associates.\n\nKelsey met her husband, Austin while working as a nurse in the Emergency Department and he as a Firefighter in Emporia, Kansas.

Growing up, I love being around people and science was always fascinating to me so it was very natural for me to lean towards healthcare. I started my professional career as a Medical Technologist and Clinical Laboratory Scientist. After ten years of performing labs and managing a laboratory, I decided to go back to school to become a Physician Assistant. This transition allowed me to be in direct patient care, to help treat, manage, and more importantly build relationships with patients. It is a true honor and privilege for me to take care of patients and what is most important to them, their families.
