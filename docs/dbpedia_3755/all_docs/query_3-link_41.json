Focusing attention in his first few years to stabilizing the financial leg of the University, Dr. Green set his sights on the structure and needs of the athletic department. An item of major concern was the lack of a track and field facility, in conjunction with a quality playing surface for the football and soccer programs. As a former football and track athlete, Dr. Green envisioned students attending Friends University and competing in a track and field program that would be competitive and rewarding. In 1998 through Dr. Green’s leadership, Friends University installed a state of the art synthetic playing surface for football and soccer, along with a collegiate level eight lane track for our student athletes. The synthetic playing surface was one of the first of its kind in the country, combining a special sand and rubber mixture that eventually was copied by many large NCAA schools, including the University of Nebraska. Next, Dr. Green worked to change the structure of the athletic department by implementing a full-time Director of Athletics, removing the duties of coaching a sport. The concept was to develop an athletic administrative model that would focus on balance and equity amongst all sports, attention to student recruitment and retention, along with quality financial management. This model is now being duplicated by other KCAC schools as well as many NAIA schools. Dr. Green’s next focus was the upgrade and enhancement of the Garvey Physical Education Center. Through his leadership, the Garvey Center underwent a $2.1 million dollar renovation with upgrades to all mechanical components, an expanded weight room facility, as well as a completely renovated gymnasium which includes new floor and graphic designs. But the most rewarding aspect of Dr. Green’s work towards Athletics, which cannot be measured in dollars, is his dedication and commitment to student athletes by attending their games, events, and practices. As he has done with all students at Friends University, Dr. Green has displayed a commitment and support to their work and endeavors by reaching out to them, interacting with them, and supporting them time and again in their events.\n\n2010\n\nDoug Stewart\n\nInducted in 2010\n\nSports: Football\n\nDoug Stewart started his student athlete career as a fullback in football in 1971, a position he held for the duration of his time at Friends.
