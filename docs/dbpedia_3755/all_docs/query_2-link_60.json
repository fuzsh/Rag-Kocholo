A funeral service was held on October 26 at Congregation Kol Ami in White Plains. The son of Sara and Frank Davis of Weirton WV, Paul earned his PhD in mathematics from Carnegie Mellon University and embarked on a career in academia before pivoting to the financial industry, where he served for 25 years as Senior Managing Director at TIAA CREF until his retirement in2007. He touched many lives through his prodigious volunteer work in the fields of mental health, criminal justice reform, refugee resettlement and adult education. He is remembered for his gentleness, patience, and generosity. He is survived by his wife of 54 years, Susan Glickman Davis, brother Jack Davis, daughters Nikki Allen and Annie Davis Weingrad, and grandchildren David and Daniel Allen and Isaac and Lucy Weingrad. His family would like to thank the doctors and nurses who gave him exemplary care. Donations are welcome in Paulâ€™s honor to HIAS, Hearts and Homes for Refugees, or to the New Israel Fund."
