        "text": "PEORIA, Ariz. — For as long as he can remember, Nick Davis has been struck by his father’s sense of curiosity and wonderment with how the world works, particularly as it connects to sports.\n\nNever afraid to implement new concepts and ideas, Paul Davis would often test his hypotheses while coaching, either with a college team at a small school in Nebraska or with the Reds of the Omaha Suburban League, the team Nick played on as a 9-or 10-year-old.\n\n“I was the guinea pig for some of my dad’s theories,” said Nick, now the Brewers’ manager for baseball research and quantitative analysis. “We are doing yoga-based stretching before games, and my friends are like, ‘What is your dad making us do?’”\n\nPaul Davis replaced Mel Stottlemyre Jr. as the Mariners’ pitching coach after Stottlemyre was dismissed following the 2018 season. Unlike Stottlemyre, the ultimate insider in and out of professional baseball since the mid-1980s, the 54-year-old Davis has never spent a single day in the big leagues prior to this year. He saw his playing career end in college and boasts a resume more befitting a college professor than a big-league coach.\n\nAs a matter of fact, he’s actually been a college professor.\n\nDavis is about as unconventional a hire as they come because his experiences were not entirely born between the lines of a baseball diamond. He owns bachelor’s degrees in psychology and history education and a master’s in educational administration. He taught psychology and sports management at the college level, too.\n\nWondering where baseball fits in? Don’t worry, the guy can coach, too. He was successful at Dana College, a now-defunct NAIA school in Nebraska, before joining the Cardinals organization in 2013. He moved fast in part because of his grasp of analytics, his insatiable thirst for knowledge and his ability to communicate his thoughts to players in a relatable way.\n\n“I’m a naturally curious person,” Davis said of his unique path Monday.\n\nThat curiosity has resulted in a blending of his subjects of interest. Some of the concepts he taught as a college coach — and later in the Cardinals’ farm system — were rooted in his studies in psychology.\n\n“As a coach, I viewed myself as a teacher,” Davis said. “Once I was pursuing graduate degrees, I taught subject matter that was interesting and that I was doing research on. As a college coach, I would have classrooms sessions in the offseason. It lent itself to what my strengths were.\n\n“A lot of times, what I was teaching, Intro to Psychology and Development of Psychology, helped me from a coaching perspective.”\n\nDavis will need to draw on all his experiences in his first season with the Mariners. He presided over a group of 32 pitchers going through the paces of the team’s first spring workout with pitchers and catchers on Tuesday. If you’re keeping score, that’s 32 pitchers Davis had never seen pitch before.\n\nThe learning curve will be a steep one, said manager Scott Servais, but he believes Davis will be able to handle the workload. The pitching system the Mariners have in place is a collaborative one, after all, with help from other coaches and the front office. That should aid Davis’ assimilation, but he will be given free rein to tap into his expertise as he sees fit.\n\nThat expertise is extensive, touching primarily on how psychology relates to sports and leadership. While with the Cardinals, he had the chance to tap into his interest in analytics and biomechanics, and his diverse background and interpersonal skills have allowed him to reach people.\n\n“I think one of my strengths is to see the potential in guys and imagine what this guy could be,” Davis said. “It’s like, ‘What does he do well, how can we make that even better?’”\n\nGetting to know a new pitching staff won’t be as daunting for Davis as it might others; after facing a classroom of 40 undergraduates while teaching Psychology and Sports Management, he’s comfortable with crowds.\n\nDavis’ goal, especially early on, is to develop relationships with the pitchers. And that’s not just about learning what they throw or how they go about attacking hitters. He’s talking about a much deeper connection, learning about where his players come from and where they want to go.\n\nThere will be plenty of learning this spring, but a lot of the work has already taken place since Davis was hired on Nov. 6. He has pored over video and logged conversations with Brian DeLunas, the team’s director of pitching development and strategies.\n\n“It’s going to be a process, just trying to build relationships with guys,” Davis said. “There’s a lot of talent here. A lot of guys haven’t had the opportunity yet. There’s always surprises, guys who come out of nowhere. I think there will be some guys who surprise people.”\n\nWhile his career path has been nothing like those who held his position before him, Davis just might surprise in his new role.\n\n“He will inspire, and he will educate,” said Wes Sime, a sports psychologist and professor emeritus at the University of Nebraska who has served a mentor to Davis. “Paul is such a great communicator and phenomenal in creating ideas in sport performance and developing the best in athletes.\n\n“He sees outside the box,” Sime said. “He’s got great potential if the Mariners let him unleash that.”\n\nNever before has baseball seen more non-traditional hires, many of whom — like DeLunas — come from the private sector and don’t have prior professional baseball experience.\n\nThe game is looking for people like Paul Davis, and if you can help a team, it will find you, regardless of how long, short or non-existent your playing or coaching career has been. At least one of Davis’ earliest pupils likes his chances of helping Seattle.\n\n“He’s a good communicator,” Nick said. “He likes to teach and learn. I’m confident he’ll figure it out.”"
