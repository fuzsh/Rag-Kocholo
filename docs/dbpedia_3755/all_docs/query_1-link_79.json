        "text": "Jeffrey Davis, MD\n\nOwner, Family Medicine, Functional & Integrative Medicine\n\nWichita & Hutchinson\n\nI have always been fascinated by the science of the body and how our biology and physiology work together. Those were my favorite subjects in college, so the desire to become a physician came naturally. I received my bachelor of arts and masters of clinical gerontology from Baylor University and went on to earn my medical degree from the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston. In 2005, I completed my residency in Family Medicine through the University of Kansas at Via Christi Hospital. I am an advanced fellow in regenerative and functional medicine through the American Academy of Anti-Aging Medicine and a fellow of the Medical Academy of Pediatric Special Needs.\n\nIn March of 2014 I opened Prairie Health and Wellness with the desire to create a place in Wichita where people could find a functional and integrative approach to healthcare that blends with our current understanding of relevant research. I work very hard to collaborate with my patients to create a plan of care personalized to their own individual medical and health goals. I believe in working together with patients to make small, cumulative changes over time that will add up to create lifelong positive impact in their health and wellness. I am also passionate about providing affordable care directly to patients and simplifying health care in general. In addition to opening Prairie Health, I have continued to push into health entrepreneurship with the recent co-creation of Fair Market Health, a company dedicated to simplifying costs for surgeries and procedures. I also enjoy serving as a principal investigator in several FDA clinical trials.\n\nI am married to a wonderful woman, Julie, who has blessed me with four incredible children. We moved to the country a few years ago and I love spending our evenings and weekends there building and welding things, riding horses, observing nature with the kids, and doing the things that the people we love, love."
