        "text": "Edward T. Pierce was born in New York State in 1851. He graduated from the New York Normal School at Albany and from the law school at Union University. Later he was awarded the degree of Doctor of Pedagogy. After teaching for a few years in New Jersey, he moved to California where he was Superintendent of the Pasadena school system from 1883 - 1889. In 1889, he was elected as the first principal of Chico Normal School.\n\nIn his autobiography, he said \"I felt then and still feel that God can give no man or woman any higher or more exalted work than that of training teachers...\" He also felt that in the four years he was in Chico the Normal School was a good moral and intellectual influence on the town.\n\nAs first principal, he chose the faculty, began recruiting students, and planned the curriculum for the normal school. As an administrator he was firm and instilled the institution with high moral and academic standards. He started the model training school in 1890.\n\nPierce was married in 1877 to Isabel Woodin who was also an educator and taught in the schools at Pasadena and at the Chico Normal School. In 1893, he left Chico to accept the position of president of the Los Angeles Normal School. He remained there until 1904 when he retired. He died in Sierra Madre in 1919.\n\nAymer Jay Hamilton graduated from Clarion (Pennsylvania) State Normal School and San Jose (California) State Normal School before enrolling at the University of California, Berkeley where he received his AB (1923), MA (1923), and his EdD (1927). Dr. Hamilton taught in rural Pennsylvania schools and worked as a school principal in Pennsylvania and California (Petaluma and Berkeley). At the college level, he taught at the University of California, Berkeley before teaching at the Claremont Colleges. He also taught summer sessions at the National University in Mexico City. In 1932, while president at Chico, he taught a summer session at Buffalo (New York) State Teachers College.\n\nThe first public reception for a Chico president was held for Dr. and Mrs. Hamilton in October 1931. In 1932, the school unveiled a growth plan and announced that ten majors, plus the traditional program in education, would be available in the 1932-33 school year.\n\nDr. Hamilton presided over substantial growth and constant change in his 19 years as president. The physical plant expanded beginning with the new library (now Trinity Hall) between 1931 and 1933. Campus landscaping, a California Travel College Cruise, extension courses, new registration methods, conversion of Bidwell Hall to a student union, the establishment of the Chico State College Foundation, and mid-year commencement exercises all began under Dr. Hamilton. He also saw the creation of numerous pre-professional programs (health, engineering, accounting, and others), housing for veterans, a snack bar and cafeteria, and a new industrial arts complex.\n\nHe dealt with numerous problems including severely restricted funding during the Depression and World War II. Major fluctuations in class size during the war were a recurring problem. The student population dropped from over 800 students in 1939 to 234 in 1942 before increasing to 1156 in 1947. Military service staff, and the Mt. Shasta Summer Session was moved to Chico to reduce expenses.\n\nTowards the end of his tenure, ground clearing commenced for construction of new facilities for chemistry, music, theater, and numerous offices. He was honored with the naming of the Aymer J. Hamilton Elementary School in December 1949. In January 1950, plans for the first master's degree were announced.\n\nIn November 1949, Dr. Hamilton announced his retirement as of July 31, 1950, and ensured a smooth transition working with the new President, Glenn Kendall, after his selection and arrival in April 1950.\n\nDr. Gayle E. Hutchinson was selected to lead CSU, Chico in 2016, becoming the first female president in the University’s history. She previously held the position of provost and vice president for Academic Affairs at California State University, Channel Islands from 2013 to 2016, where she was instrumental in helping to develop the university as one of the fastest growing and most innovative campuses in the CSU system.\n\nHutchinson began her career in higher education at CSU, Chico, spending nearly 20 years in various instructional and leadership positions. She joined the campus as an assistant professor in the Department of Kinesiology in 1990. She taught in the classroom for 17 years, earning tenure, promotion, and the rank of full professor. She chaired the department from 2002 to 2007. As a faculty member, she was highly engaged in the Academic Senate and CSU Statewide Senate. After participating in the prestigious American Council on Education Fellows program (2005–2006), Hutchinson applied for and earned the position of Dean of the College of Behavioral and Social Sciences (2007–2013). Hutchinson’s scholarship and grant writing focused on teacher socialization, social psychology of sport, comprehensive school-based wellness programs, and equity in sport and physical education.\n\nEarlier in her career, she served as the principal investigator and co-director of the Northern California Physical Education – Health Subject Matter Project and the project director for the Pacific Wellness Center and developed curriculum and taught physical education in elementary schools.\n\nShe holds a bachelor’s degree in physical education teacher education from the University of Massachusetts, Amherst; a master’s from Teachers College, Columbia University in teaching analysis & curriculum development; and a doctorate of education from University of Massachusetts, Amherst in teacher education/staff development.\n\nPresident Steve Perez, 2023-present\n\nDr. Steve Perez became Chico State’s 13th president on July 1, 2023, after serving as the University’s interim provost and vice president for Academic Affairs. As president, he intentionally focuses on building and maintaining strong teams that will work hard every day to support the success of Chico State students, colleagues, and the region.\n\nPrior to coming to Chico State, Perez served as interim president from January to December 2022 at San Jose State University, where he kept the institution on an upward trajectory during a time of transition. Perez was previously provost and vice president of Academic Affairs at Sacramento State. Over his two decades of service to that university, he also served as associate professor, professor, assistant to the president for special projects, faculty athletics representative, interim dean for the College of Business Administration, and interim provost.\n\nDuring his time teaching, Perez taught macroeconomics at all levels, as well as econometrics, sports economics, labor economics, and mathematics for economists. His research has explored most macroeconomic topics, but a specific interest has been evaluating the ability of econometric techniques to discover the truth, issues of causality in macroeconomics, and sports economics. His articles appear in many economics journals, including The Journal of Sports Economics, The Journal of Monetary Economics, The Econometrics Journal, Economics Letters, The Journal of Economic Methodology, Public Finance and Management, The Journal of Economics and Business, Oxford Bulletin of Economics and Statistics, The Journal of Money, Credit, and Banking, Applied Economics, and The Journal of Macroeconomics.\n\nAfter receiving his bachelor’s degree in economics at the University of California, San Diego, Perez received his PhD in economics from the University of California, Davis in 1994. He taught economics at Virginia Commonwealth University and Washington State University. before coming to Sacramento State in 2001."
