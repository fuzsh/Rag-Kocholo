Paul Davis, 93, of Metuchen, New Jersey, passed away on April 27 while recovering from a recent fall at his home.

Born in Brooklyn and raised in Queens NY, Paul served in the USMC and was a sniper in the Korean War. He graduated with a B.S. from The College of the City of New York and an M.A. from the University of Kansas. Enjoying playing with a chemistry kit as a teen with his cousin Bob Singer, he later worked at Merck as a research chemist for over 35 years. It was while at Merck that he became interested in stamp collecting - a hobby that he remained engaged in for the rest of his life.

Paul is predeceased by his brother Albert Davis. He is survived by his niece Fran Davis and nephews Robert Davis and Glenn Davis; and by his close cousin Bob Singer and his wife, Sandy.

The funeral service will take place on Thursday, May 4th at 12:30pm at the chapel at Brigadier General William C. Doyle Cementery, 350 Province Line Road, Wrightstown, NJ.

Paul will be remembered by his niece and nephews as a kind and soft-spoken man who drove a purple Porsche, played handball and enjoyed traveling, especially to Japan; and by his cousin Bob Singer for their many years of playing cards and games with his family.

The family requests that donations be made in Paul's name at a charity of your choosing.

May Paul's memory be for a blessing.
