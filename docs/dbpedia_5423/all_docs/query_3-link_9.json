        "text": "Rita Hayworth may be remembered as a Hollywood femme fatale and pin-up icon, but the woman behind the image was very different.\n\nA shy young woman pushed into her acting career by the domineering men in her life, Hayworth endured a string of painful, failed marriages.\n\nBut for a time she found happiness with the man she called the \"great love of her life\".\n\nBefore she was Rita\n\nBorn Margarita Carmen Cansino in 1918, Hayworth faced hardship and heartache from her earliest years.\n\nWhen she was just 12, her entertainer father made her his dance partner, making her perform at wild floating casinos.\n\nHe would beat her and, as Hayworth later confessed to her second husband Orson Welles, her father would sexually abuse her too.\n\nA poor student, much of Hayworth's time was spent practicing and performing. She was rarely seen playing with other children, and had few chances to make friends.\n\nThe family moved closer to the Mexican border, travelling often to Tijuana where Hayworth's father soon had them performing in swanky nightclubs.\n\nAnd her days of performing were only just beginning.\n\nIn 1937, at not even 20 years old, Hayworth married her first husband Eddie Judson.\n\nRELATED: The true story of Audrey Hepburn's two greatest romances\n\nHer family were furious about the match, as Judson was twice her age, and his intentions were far from pure.\n\n\"I married him for love, but he married me for an investment,\" Hayworth later said, according to Barbara Leaming's 1989 biography If This Was Happiness.\n\n\"For five years he treated me as if I had no mind or soul of my own.\"\n\nA painful rise to stardom\n\nJudson wanted his wife to be a star; not because she wanted it, but because he had plenty to gain from her success.\n\n\"He helped me with my career,\" Hayworth would say after their marriage ended, \"and helped himself to my money.\"\n\nDespite Hayworth's quiet nature and shyness, Judson forced her to do just about anything to drum up publicity.\n\nHe also had her change her appearance, using painful treatments to move her hairline back before dying it auburn, so she looked \"less Latin\".\n\nSoon, Hayworth was known as \"the most cooperative girl in Hollywood\". But it didn't stop there.\n\nJudson was even willing to \"pimp\" his wife out to influential men in Hollywood, encouraging her to have sex with them to earn favour in the industry.\n\n\"Her first husband was a pimp. Literally a pimp,\" Welles told Leaming.\n\nWhen she refused to sleep with one - Columbia studio boss Harry Cohn, who had just signed her at the time – Hayworth unknowingly inspired a grudge Cohn would hold for decades.\n\nAs her star began to rise, Hayworth would change her name from her \"exotic\"-sounding birth name to Rita Hayworth, a more \"American\" sounding name.\n\nShe appeared in a series of films, soon starring alongside Fred Astaire and becoming a household name for her sensual magnetism and talent.\n\nIn 1942, Hayworth would finally divorce Judson, citing cruelty, and reconcile with her family.\n\nLess than two years later, she would marry again – this time to the man she called the \"great love\" of her life.\n\nEnter Orson Welles\n\nDirector and actor Orson Welles had seen Hayworth's pinup spreads long before he ever met her, and like most people he assumed the real woman would be just like her femme fatale image.\n\nBut the truth surprised him; instead of a seductress, the real Hayworth was a timid young actress still trying to find her place.\n\nHe welcomed her into his circle of friends, often pretending to read her mind so she would have to correct him and get her talking.\n\nThe pair fell fast, and by 1943 had decided to marry. They tied the knot on September 7, 1943, while Hayworth was on a lunch break from her film Cover Girl.\n\nRELATED: The tragic end to Sir David Attenborough's 47-year marriage\n\n\"I never saw a happier, more tickled, more delighted, adorable couple in the world,\" secretary Shifra Haran told Leaming\n\nThere would be no honeymoon – Hayworth said she had to \"get back to the studio\" – but for a time they would be one of the happiest pairs in Hollywood.\n\n'The only happiness I had'\n\nBoth eager to escape the spotlight, Hayworth and Welles moved to a mansion and planned their escape from the pressures of Hollywood.\n\nHe would go into politics, and she would do anything other than the acting career she'd been pushed into.\n\n\"She hated being a movie star!\" Welles said. \"She never got a moment's pleasure out of being a famous movie star. It gave her nothing.\"\n\nEager to please her intelligent, accomplished new husband, Hayworth did everything in her power to be the perfect partner.She would read his books, support his political goals, carry his child.\n\n\"I really wanted to be everything Orson wanted of me,\" she later told movie star June Allyson, who recounted it to Leaming.\n\nSadly, it wouldn't be enough. According to Hayworth, Welles wasn't ready for married life and all it entailed.\n\nRELATED: The tragic end to Clark Gable and Carole Lombard's Old Hollywood romance\n\n\"During the entire period of our marriage, he showed no interest in establishing a home. When I suggested purchasing a home, he told me he didn't want the responsibility,\" she said.\n\n\"Mr. Welles told me he never should have married in the first place; that it interfered with his freedom in his way of life.\"\n\nWhen Hayworth was pregnant with their daughter Rebecca, who was born in 1944, Welles became entangled with heiress Gloria Vanderbilt, who was also married at the time.\n\nShe wasn't the only one. Behind closed doors, Welles reportedly began an affair with Judy Garland, visited sex workers and became less attentive to his wife.\n\nFor her part, Hayworth began to drink, becoming more volatile until she filed for a divorce which was granted in 1947.\n\nThe 'Gilda' effect\n\nPrior to her divorce from Welles, Hayworth starred in the film Gilda, playing one of her most provocative and iconic roles.\n\nIt was her performance as Gilda Mundson Farrell that would define public view of the actress, and follow her for years to come.\n\nAfter her second divorce, Hayworth would marry three more times – and divorce just as many. She also had several affairs, often with her leading men.\n\nBut none of her romances lasted, something Hayworth blamed in part on her image as a Hollywood femme fatale.\n\n\"Men go to bed with Gilda, but awaken with me,\" Hayworth famously said once. \"Basically, I am a good, gentle person, but I am attracted to mean personalities.\"\n\nRELATED: Why Sophia Loren gave up her Hollywood affair with Cary Grant\n\nIn 1948 she married Prince Aly Khan, a son of Sultan Mahommed Shah, Aga Khan III, the leader of the Ismaili sect of Shia Islam.\n\nShe left her acting career for the marriage and had one child with him, Princess Yasmin Aga Khan, but the pair would divorce after Khan was seen with actress Joan Fontaine.\n\nHayworth was granted a divorce in 1953 on the grounds of \"extreme cruelty, entirely mental in nature\".\n\n\"After Aly, Rita was on a downward path, a steep, steep, toboggan slide,\" Welles told Leaming.\n\nThat same year, Hayworth married singer Dick Haymes, who was deep in debt and had no solid proof of American citizenship.\n\nHayworth dealt with both, footing the bills for much of his debt during their tumultuous two-year marriage, which ended after he struck her in the face in public in 1955.\n\nRELATED: How Janet Leigh's star-struck Hollywood marriage to Tony Curtis fell apart\n\n\"I could hardly believe I could be a princess one minute and be treated like that the next,\" she told June Allyson, according to Leaming.\n\nBy that time, Hayworth was raising both her daughters – one with Welles, one with Kahn – and dealing with her own financial issues.\n\nShe ended up marrying film producer James Hill in 1958, before divorcing in 1961.\n\nShe claimed \"metal cruelty\", while he alleged the marriage ended because he wanted her to continue acting while she desperately wanted to leave Hollywood.\n\nA fading star\n\nHayworth first stared showing signs of early onset Alzheimer's in the 1960s, though she wouldn't be diagnosed until 1980.\n\nIn the years leading up to her diagnosis, the actress became erratic, forgetful and sometimes violent.\n\nIn the 1980s she disappeared from an appearance in Brazil, only to be discovered soon after sitting on a beach watching children fly kites.\n\nWith her children grown and a string of failed marriages behind her, Hayworth had few companions until her daughter Princess Yasmin moved in to care for her in the 1980s.\n\n\"It was the outbursts. She'd fly into a rage. I can't tell you. I thought it was alcoholism—alcoholic dementia. We all thought that,\" Yasmin said of the years before her mother's diagnosis.\n\n\"You can't imagine the relief just in getting a diagnosis. We had a name at last, Alzheimer's! Of course, that didn't really come until the last seven or eight years. She wasn't diagnosed as having Alzheimer's until 1980. There were two decades of hell before that.\"\n\nIn her mother's final years, Yasmin would describe Hayworth as \"still beautiful, but it's a shell.\"\n\nEven Welles, the \"greatest love\" of Hayworth's life, was a stranger to her when she saw him in the 1980s at an event.\n\n\"When it was over, I came over to her table, and I saw that she was very beautiful, very reposed looking, and didn't know me at first,\" he once said.\n\n\"After about four minutes of speaking, I could see that she realised who I was, and she began to cry quietly.\"\n\n'The sweetest woman that ever lived'\n\nHayworth died in 1987, following complications associated with her Alzheimer's. Though she died single, Welles was widely regarded as the greatest love of her life.\n\nLeaming wrote of their relationship: \"Rita told him, 'You know the only happiness I've ever had in my life has been with you.'\n\n\"Welles was overwhelmed with guilt about how badly he had treated her and with sadness at the perspective this gave him on her life. 'If this was happiness,' he would later say of their marriage, 'imagine what the rest of her life had been.'\"\n\nThough her life had been a sad and complicated one, Welles saying \"all her life was pain\", he remembered her only in the best terms.\n\nOn the evening before his death in 1985, two years before Hayworth passed, Welles called her \"one of the dearest and sweetest women that ever lived\"."
