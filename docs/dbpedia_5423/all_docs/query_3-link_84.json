        "text": "The drama critics who attended the opening of young Orson Welles’ revival of “Heartbreak House” last spring were practically unanimous in acclaiming it as a perfectly timed production. Shaw’s gloomy prophecies about the decay of civilization, although written twenty-one years ago, were so pat and applicable to contemporary affairs, they exclaimed, that it was a stroke of genius for the Mercury Theatre to have decided to make them heard once again. This is probably no more than the truth, but it is nevertheless a thought-provoking fact that, up to the very moment “Heartbreak House” went into rehearsal, Welles had been leaning toward an alternative production—“Twelfth Night,” to be done in mid-Victorian costumes, with several scenes laid at a seaside bathing beach.\n\nLooking for the essential qualities of a mind poised between “Heartbreak House” and a mid-Victorian “Twelfth Night,” the abashed biographer is forced to the conclusion that his subject is one of those characters who have served so many novelists so well—the actor whose world lies entirely behind the footlights, for whom the only realities are grease paint and tinsel. It is a simple fact that Welles has never been interested in anything outside the theatre and that he has experimented with everything in it—writing, directing, designing, acting, and producing. A biologist would call him an organism perfectly adapted to its surroundings. His spiritual makeup is a nice blend of optimism, good humor, and indomitable egotism. Because of his fortunate lack of formal education, his mind works with effortless originality and at surprising speed; he has already thought out enough productions, down to the last details of design, lighting, and direction, to keep him busy for the next decade. Although he is physically graceless offstage, pudgy and unathletic, his size and booming voice give him an authoritative, if not actually overwhelming, stage presence; and some mysterious source of energy enables him to get along with only two or three hours’ sleep a night during rehearsal weeks. It is hardly surprising that Welles is a success. The fact that he is a success at twenty-three may be ascribed to the operations of heredity, progressive education, and the federal government.\n\nOrson Welles was prenatally named by his father over a round of drinks in Rio (George Orson Welles, for the humorist George Ade and a man named Orson Wells, a friend but no relation of the Welleses) and born, somewhat anticlimactically, in Kenosha, Wisconsin. The date of his birth was May 6, 1915. Over and over again, this date has been confirmed by the city fathers of Kenosha for the benefit of Sunday-supplement journalists hopeful of discovering that Welles is really thirty or thirty-five. This skepticism about his age has never angered Welles, but he cannot restrain a sensation of gentle triumph whenever he hears that another reporter has put himself to the useless expense of wiring to Kenosha for a duplicate of the birth certificate.\n\nWelles’ mother was an Ives of Springfield, Illinois, which meant a good finishing school and a dowry from the coal business. She was a talented amateur pianist, and had a number of friends in the musical and operatic set of Chicago. When Orson was two years old the family moved from Kenosha to Chicago. Here, their house was constantly filled with musicians and it seemed understood that the child was to have a musical career. He made an early début with the Chicago City Opera; a soprano friend of the family borrowed him to play her illegitimate spawn in “Madama Butterfly.” When Orson was six, his parents were divorced and for two years he lived with his mother. Upon her death, he was returned to the care of his father, surely one of the oddest souls ever to come out of the Middle West.\n\nIf the name of Dick Welles seems familiar, it is because a restaurant, a race horse, and a cigar were named after him. (The cigar may just possibly have been named after the race horse.) Dick Welles had a substantial income from several wagon factories which belonged to his family, and was by profession an inventor. He invented one of the first automobiles in America, but never bothered about patents because the thing seemed impractical. He did, however, receive substantial royalties from an improved type of bicycle lamp and from a picnic kit which the government bought in quantities to issue to the troops during the World War. In the intervals of invention, Dick Welles was what people used to call a bon vivant. He cut a wide swath on three continents, not to mention the island of Jamaica, where he maintained a winter home. Orson spent three years with his father, three years which might have got him down for good if he had not possessed a philosophic temperament and a strong constitution. Vicariously, as his father’s travelling companion, he sampled the wine, women, and song of London, Paris, the Riviera, Singapore, Tokio, and Dixon, Illinois—the last-named place because Dick Welles unaccountably bought the local hotel and settled down to operate it. However, the building burned to the ground after a few weeks and the pair were off again, carrying with them nothing more than two bottles of fine Holland gin which Welles père had succeeded in saving from the holocaust. At one time or another they managed to look in on each of Welles’ seven great-aunts, all women of pronounced individuality. One of them used to lope along the back roads of Missouri behind her limousine, to keep in condition; another used to bathe in ginger ale, because, she said, the price of champagne was exorbitant. Occasionally, when not en route, Orson stayed in Chicago with Dr. Maurice Bernstein, a friend of the family. It was Dr. Bernstein who administered the money left by Orson’s mother and, in 1934, after the death of Dick Welles, became his son’s legal guardian. This Dr. Bernstein, an orthopedist with cultured tastes, persuaded Dick Welles to enter his son, when the boy was eleven, in the Todd School at Woodstock, Illinois. Orson continued to travel with his father during summer vacations, but he had already found his vocation.\n\nTodd is an expensive preparatory school of considerable antiquity, now run on severely progressive lines. The present headmaster, Roger Hill, a slim, white-haired, tweed-bearing man, who looks as if he had been cast for his rôle by a motion-picture director, has never let the traditional preparatory-school curriculum stand in the way of creative work. All the boys spend as much time as they want in the machine shop, the printshop, the bookbindery, or the school theatre. Orson Welles was at Todd from 1926 to 1931. In those five years he completed eight years of academic work and qualified for admission to college, provided the college wasn’t too particular about mathematics. Also, abetted by the delighted Mr. Hill, he gave himself a thorough course in the fundamentals of the theatre. It is probable that Welles, as a boy, wore more crêpe hair and putty noses than most actors do in a lifetime. When he was thirteen, he began directing the Todd Troupers, the school dramatic society. His first big job that year was a production of “Julius Caesar,” played in togas but nevertheless embodying many of the ideas he later used for the Mercury’s “Caesar.” This was the Todd School’s entry in the annual Drama League contest for high schools and little-theatre groups around Chicago. It didn’t get the prize; the judges explained that, meritorious as the production was, the two lads who played Cassius and Mark Antony were both too mature to be bona-fide students. This was a severe disappointment for Welles, who had cast himself in these two leading rôles to make sure that they were played exactly right.\n\nWelles directed about eight productions a year while he was at Todd, usually playing one of the chief parts. He developed quite a nice touch at scene-painting and even executed a mural for a classroom. Fortunately, he was at a school which placed no emphasis on athletics. During his travels he learned to swim and to ride a horse. That is today the extent of his physical accomplishments. If he attempts anything else even mildly athletic, he sprains his ankle. Once he sprained his ankle while trying to chin himself. Roger Hill is inclined to believe that there is some sort of psychic slant to this infirmity, that Welles sprains his ankle because he is worried or doubtful about something. It may be.\n\nThere would be no point to a recital of Welles’ childish triumphs if he had not turned up in New York a very few years later and repeated some of them as commercial and artistic successes. For instance, his last big job before he graduated from Todd was a mélange of Shakespeare’s historical plays—edited and directed by Orson Welles, starring Orson Welles. This was the germ of the “Five Kings” chronicle play to be presented by the Mercury this autumn to the Theatre Guild subscribers. Seven years ago, if anybody had told the Guild directors that they were going to buy an interest in a production then being whipped up by a child in a progressive school, they wouldn’t have believed it. Welles, one imagines, would have been gratified but not particularly astonished.\n\nAfter his graduation in 1931, Welles went to study drawing at the Chicago Art Institute. A severe attack of hay fever put a stop to this episode, so the youth got some money from his father and set out for a tour of Scotland and Ireland in search of pure air and things to sketch. While wandering about County Donegal in a donkey cart, painting dubious water colors of the local scenery, he fell in with a vacationing actor from the Gate Theatre in Dublin. A few weeks later he was passing through Dublin and went backstage to say hello to his friend. Before he left the theatre, he had agreed to make a series of appearances as guest star. He had been introduced to the director and had somehow allowed him to get the impression that he was a Theatre Guild star. It should be explained that Welles looked then, as he does today, like the sort of young man a suburban Gilbert-and-Sullivan society would cast as the Mikado. He is six feet two inches tall, weighs well over two hundred pounds, wears his hair long, and has a blunt-featured face with slanting brows. He said he was twenty-five, and got away with it. A splendid series of adult rôles was awarded him—Svengali, the Duke in “Jew Süss,” and the King in “Hamlet”—and he played them to frantic applause from the Gate audiences. “Strictly goons” is the way Welles describes these folk, meaning that they were given to intemperate enthusiasm. He stayed in Ireland until early in 1932, thus effectively scotching Roger Hill’s plan to send him to Harvard. He was a great success. The Gate players generously lent him to the Abbey Players for a guest-guest-star appearance. He met all the Irish intelligentsia, and he even met Noel Coward, informally. Welles overheard Coward, in a café, making what he considered supercilious remarks about the British Empire. Being at the time in a violently Anglophile phase, Welles rose from his chair and shouted at Coward. Coward got up and shouted right back. “Neither of us said anything in the least brilliant,” Welles says.\n\nTearing himself away from the doting Irish, he returned to Woodstock, Illinois, in March, 1932. He and Roger Hill had long had an idea for a historical play about the abolitionist John Brown. Welles worked out a scenario with his schoolmaster and went off to a lake in Wisconsin to spend the summer writing. The result was a practically interminable piece called “Marching Song.” Welles brought it to New York that autumn and showed it to all the producers, but without success. He seems to have accepted this defeat with an equanimity that would do credit to one of twice his years. “I am aware that disappointments, it matters not how many, should in no way affect my confidence, but they do,” he wrote to Roger Hill, his Boswell. “Today, for example, it was not a shock nor a sense of failure, just the realization of a fact, the cementing of a profound conviction. I refer to Ben Boyar’s returning the manuscript. I wasn’t even surprised. He said, ‘It’s a swell show. It makes good reading. It would make a good book. I think maybe it’s even a good play. But that don’t matter. It won’t make money. It isn’t a commercial piece. At least that’s what I think. Maybe I’m wrong.’ He thanked me for letting him read it, nicely, I thought, repeated himself, and said goodbye. . . .\n\n“I got an idea earlier this evening (it’s now half after three) for a comedy, a comedy-drama let us say, on the subject of aphasia. That’s the medical word, isn’t it, for loss of memory? The idea, like so many others on ice, is merely embryonic.”\n\nWriting is the department of dramatics in which Welles has been the least successful. “Marching Song” never did get produced, nor did another play of this period called “Bright Lucifer.” This is a likely-sounding piece about a Hollywood horror actor, a sort of Boris Karloff, who eventually gets to the point of believing he is an honest-to-God menace. This delusion seizes him on an Indian reservation, and the Indians get him. Welles still thinks it might make a fine play.\n\nDepressed by the fate of his plays and by his failure, after his Irish triumph, to land even a walk-on part in New York, Welles decided to get away from it all for a while. He sailed for Africa, one of the few places he had never been to, and disembarked in Morocco. Here he encountered The Glaoui, a Moroccan chieftain with an unaccountably Scotch-sounding title, whom he had known in Paris. The Glaoui (pronounced “The Glowie”) was delighted to see Welles again. Welles told him that he was writing a travel book, and the chieftain asked him to be his guest. Welles had a fine time. Since he was nominally a Christian, he couldn’t eat at table with the family, but delicious trays were sent to his room, and he had plenty of leisure to get on with his writing, which was not a travel book at all but a school edition of Shakespeare, another suggestion of Roger Hill’s. This volume, called “Everybody’s Shakespeare,” has stage directions and sketches for costume and set designs for “Twelfth Night,” “Julius Caesar,” and “The Merchant of Venice;” ninety thousand copies have already been sold. Many of Welles’ close friends doubt the Glaoui episode, which annoys Welles no more than doubts about his age.\n\nHe was back in Chicago by the summer of 1933. Roger Hill introduced him to Thornton Wilder, who gave him a letter of introduction to Alexander Woollcott, who sent him around to Katharine Cornell. She had been looking for a convincingly young Marchbanks and hired Welles on the spot. This was for her famous tour with “Candida,” “The Barretts of Wimpole Street,” and “Romeo and Juliet.” Welles’ other rôles were Mercutio and Octavius, the stuttering brother of Elizabeth Barrett. He set off on a thirty-week tour which took in some seventy-five cities. There is nothing to report about the tour except that, according to one of his companions in the troupe, Welles slept until noon every day, got into numerous tavern brawls, sprained his ankle several times, was publicly reproved by Miss Cornell for wearing a false beard in a San Francisco restaurant, and turned in two hundred-odd creditable performances. The tour wound up in the spring of 1934 and Welles hopped right back to Woodstock, where he and Roger Hill had planned to have a “summer theatre festival.” This involved a coeducational dramatic school on the Todd campus, with the students supporting Welles and other guest stars in public performances. Welles courteously invited Micheál MacLiammóir and Hilton Edwards, two Gate Theatre players, to come over here and make guest appearances. These gentlemen, once they had recovered from their pardonable surprise at learning his true status, helped him to make a success of a nine-week repertory which included “Trilby,” “Tsar Paul,” and “Hamlet.” Welles, exercising almost incredible self-restraint, allowed MacLiammóir to play Hamlet and cast himself in his old rôle of the King.\n\nNow, for the first time, love entered this busy life. One of the blondest and most beautiful of the girls at the dramatic school was Virginia Nicolson, the daughter of a well-to-do and socially impeccable Chicago family. Before the summer was over she and Welles were engaged. That Christmas he married her. At first the Nicolsons objected strongly to their baroque son-in-law, but their displeasure softened as the years passed, and melted away altogether last spring, with the birth of a granddaughter. The child, named Christopher because Welles had assumed that she would be a boy, was born quietly just before Welles started the intensive rehearsals of “Heartbreak House” and caused no interruption. His wife has made only one professional appearance, in “Horse Eats Hat.” Welles wants her to play Desdemona to his Othello when he gets around to it. She is an adoring wife and mother, and makes him comfortable in their eight-room house at Sneden’s Landing. “You don’t know what it means to me to have my own home,” he sighs, looking back over the years.\n\nThe Mercury Theatre grew out of Welles’ meeting with John Houseman. If Welles is the inspiration of the group, Houseman is the brains. He is thirteen years older than Welles, heavyset, with receding hair and a weakness for checked suitings and suede shoes. He was educated in England and speaks with an English accent. Born in Bucharest of a French father and an English mother, he spent some time in the Argentine after he left England, arriving here just as the depression wiped out his wheat business. He then turned to the stage. He put on Gertrude Stein’s “Four Saints in Three Acts” and was the co-director of the Theatre Guild’s production of “Valley Forge.” He first saw Welles in the late autumn of 1934, when the latter was playing Tybalt in the New York run of Miss Cornell’s “Romeo and Juliet.” Houseman went backstage, introduced himself, and signed Welles up for a leading part in a two-performance run he planned for Archibald MacLeish’s “Panic,” a poetic discussion of the current hard times.\n\nAbout this time Welles broke into radio broadcasting. From a twenty-dollar engagement that paid a month’s rent on a modest place in West Fourteenth Street, he worked up to the point where he played dozens of rôles a week and could afford the house at Sneden’s Landing. He played innumerable current-history characters in the radio March of Time, whose officials hailed his rendition of the death of Sir Basil Zaharoff as a truly remarkable characterization. He got engagement after engagement and the problem of getting from one studio to another in time to broadcast became so acute that they used to keep an elevator waiting for him in the R.C.A. Building. He became the Great McCoy. He became the Voice of Chocolate Pudding. Finally he created The Shadow, a highly melodramatic character who becomes invisible and foils criminals over a coast-to-coast network. Rehearsals and performances of The Shadow used to take up almost all of Sunday; later he arranged to make recordings. The little pause which listeners may have noticed in The Shadow’s fiendish and knowledgeable laugh used to be a signal to Mrs. Welles; meant he was thinking of her—or had been thinking of her when he made the recording. Somebody else is The Shadow these days. This summer Welles, assisted by a group of Mercury actors, presented a series of hour-long programs devoted to dramatizations of popular tales like “Treasure Island,” “Dracula,” and “The 39 Steps.” The program is to continue through the winter, on Sunday evenings, competing with Charlie McCarthy. Another Mercury activity was a complete recording of “Julius Caesar,” released last May by Columbia Records. Welles loyally includes the Mercury boys in whatever activity he embarks on; his reply to an attractive offer from Hollywood was that he would be satisfied with nothing less than his own production unit.\n\n“Panic” was strictly an artistic experiment, which ran its scheduled two performances, was snarled at by the critics and then forgotten. It had, however, served to bring Houseman and Welles together. They decided to form a repertory company. Under the name of the Phoenix Theatre, they took an office in the Sardi Building, announced that they were going to produce Ford’s “ ’Tis Pity She’s a Whore,” and set out in search of backers. Nobody responded to their lure but a solitary eccentric, who said he wouldn’t invest a nickel in any play going but was willing to back them to the extent of ten thousand dollars in remodelling the façade of the Bijou Theatre. Discouraged, Houseman drifted off and took a job with the Federal Theatre, while Welles continued to mutter and chuckle into the National Broadcasting Company’s microphones.\n\nA year later, Houseman again brought up the question of a partnership. He pointed out to Welles that it was not very often that two ambitious young producers got hold of an angel like the federal government. A flop produced with private funds might mean no more chances for five years, while in the WPA project a man might produce an unbroken series of flops. Welles saw the point and got right to work on an idea of Houseman’s, a production of “Macbeth” to be done by the Harlem unit of the Federal Theatre. With its lush Haitian jungle peeping over the grim walls of the Scottish castle and its broad-shouldered black bucks playing out the drama of doomed ambition in scarlet and gold, it was probably the most effective presentation of this play ever put on. Just before the opening there was a brief moment when it looked as if Welles’ throat was going to be cut by a delegation of Harlemites obscurely convinced that the play was going to make fun of them. He owes his present happy life to Canada Lee, the Banquo of the play, whose word carries a good deal of weight on upper Seventh Avenue.\n\nAfter this success, Welles directed and acted in “Horse Eats Hat” for the WPA and played the lead in a WPA “Dr. Faustus.” Then came “The Cradle Will Rock,” which turned overnight from a WPA production into a Mercury play. You know the rest; in the Sunday dramatic sections you have read how Welles and Houseman, when the WPA cancelled the production, opened it under their somewhat scanty auspices, with no scenery, and the cast, to circumvent an Equity injunction, speaking their lines from seats in the orchestra. It is said that Marc Blitzstein, author of the show and the officiating pianist, bitterly resented the agreement with Equity which finally allowed the cast to join him on the stage.\n\nFree of governmental regulation and with one successful play running, Welles and Houseman again set out to find backers. This time they got thirteen of them and a total of twenty thousand dollars. After six months of business, the Mercury paid back twenty-five per cent of its capital, as a gesture of solvency and good will. Now, with seventy per cent of the stock controlled by the partners, the Mercury is flourishing but not wealthy. “Julius Caesar” was so closely followed by “The Shoemaker’s Holiday” and “Heartbreak House” that they got in each other’s way and failed to earn as much money as they might have if handled in the conventional way. “Caesar,” Houseman says, would be running yet if “Shoemaker” hadn’t been put on as an alternate bill. Similarly, “Shoemaker” was crowded out of the public’s mind by “Heartbreak House,” which the Mercury put on just to keep everyone active. In effect, the Mercury was paying for three productions at a time and never drawing revenue from more than two. The Mercury paid its actors a total of $150,000 last season. Everybody except Welles works on a minimum-guarantee-and-percentage basis. An actor who could reasonably ask around four hundred a week makes something over two hundred with the Mercury. The attraction offered him is uninterrupted work all season and the privilege of leaving on two weeks’ notice if he gets a better-paying part. Welles pays himself two hundred dollars a week, less than the earnings of many of his supporting actors.\n\nWelles has no very definite political sympathies. He has been known to exclaim, “I love great big organizations!” and occasionally, in conversation, he manifests liberal tendencies. He says the political and sociological effectiveness of “Caesar” and “Heartbreak House” would not have justified their production if they had not also been what people used to call “good theatre.” When his friend Burgess Meredith was president of Actors’ Equity, Welles obligingly helped him in his campaign for the Pepper-Coffee Bill, which sponsored a permanent Federal Theatre, speaking at luncheons and occasionally flying down to Washington to testify at hearings. When Meredith’s term was over, Welles stopped this activity.\n\nA vague cheerfulness on the part of Welles when discussing plays and plans for the future makes it difficult to find out what he is really up to. Whenever a play is mentioned in his presence he is more likely than not to exclaim, with absent-minded enthusiasm, “That’s my favorite play!” Just now Welles is getting the Mercury Theatre’s new season launched, with productions in repertory of “Danton’s Death” and “Too Much Johnson,” making a series of educational recordings of Shakespearean plays for schoolroom use, and trying to work in a trip abroad, or a vacation of some sort, before he appears in “Five Kings,” which he will direct for the Guild subscribers later on. He thinks he’d like to do “The Duchess of Malfi”—“my favorite play!” He thinks he’d like to do “Liliom” with a cast of Negroes, an intimate and rather decadent Sunday-night revue, a Mozart operetta. Then, of course, there’s the mid-Victorian “Twelfth Night.” There’s even the unwritten play about aphasia. Houseman and Welles frown on only two types of play: Restoration comedy, which Houseman says is unsuited to the modern tempo; and plays by young and unknown playwrights, which Welles says the Mercury can’t afford to undertake.\n\nMartinelli, the singer, once called Welles “this ageless soul.” If he meant his accomplishments in the theatre, about which critics are so very careful not to use the word “genius,” O.K. If he meant Welles outside the theatre, Welles in his private life, Welles in his reaction to the realization of what he is accomplishing, he was wrong. That Welles is exactly twenty-three years old. ♦"
