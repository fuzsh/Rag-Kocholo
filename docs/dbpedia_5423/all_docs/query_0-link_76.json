        "text": "HOLLYWOOD -- Orson Welles, who panicked Americans wth his radio tale of a Martian invasion and later amazed them with the genius of 'Citizen Kane,' died of an apparen heart attack. He was 70.\n\nWelles was found by a chauffeur in an upstairs bedroom of his Hollywood Hills home Thursday morning, the victim of an apparent heart attack. Welles, whose size was as great as his theatrical genius, had been under treatment for heart disease and diabetes.\n\n'There is no evidence of foul play,' Detective Russell Kuster said. 'It's obvious the death was of natural causes.'\n\nWelles' biographer, Barbara Leaming, dined with him Wednesday night at Ma Maison, a Hollywood restaurant and a frequent haunt of the bearded, Falstaffian Welles.\n\n'He was fine,' said Leaming, who sobbed at a news conference in New York. 'He was in absolutely top Orsonian form.\n\n'Dying wasn't something that Orson had in mind,' said Leaming, author of 'Orson Welles: A Biography.'\n\nIn a recent interview, Welles -- who lived life to the limit -- had this to say about death:\n\n'I rejoice in the presence of death because I think it's what makes life brilliant and beautiful, and without it the world would be ridiculous. I'm interested in it from every point of view. My interest has not dimmed with its approach.'\n\nWelles, who could disarm people with a quick wit after intimidating them with his bulk, cape and booming voice, had just done the Merv Griffin show, and was talking about renegotiating his contract with Paul Masson for a series of wine commercials.\n\nHe also was talking about directing a segment of 'Amazing Stories' for Steven Spielberg.\n\nBut Welles had not made a major American movie in nearly 30 years because Hollywood saw him as a manic genius who would fly off to far-flung countries, leaving unfinished projects in his wake.\n\nIn addition to his monumental achievement in 'Citizen Kane,' considered by many film critics the greatest movie ever made, Welles was best known for his Halloween 1938 radio adaptation of H.G. Wells' 'The War of the Worlds' on Mercury Theater of the Air.\n\nWelles broadcast a cautionary introduction that the story was fiction, but hundreds of thousands of people apparently did not hear the disclaimer and panicked, thinking Martians had landed in New Jersey.\n\nFrightened listeners poured into the streets from Maine to Georgia, choking highways in cars filled with family and possessions.\n\nIn the publicity ensuing from 'The War of the Worlds' epic, Welles, dubbed the 'boy genius,' was invited to Hollywood to produce and direct movies.\n\nA scant three years later he co-wrote, produced, directed and starred in his first feature-length movie, 'Citizen Kane,' a fact-and-fiction account of the life of publisher William Randolph Hearst.\n\nThe film has been voted by several panels of movie critics as the best ever made and its techniques influenced generations of filmmakers. It was, however, not a great commercial success.\n\nWelles was haunted by a reputation for not being able to finish projects, several of which had to be completed by other directors. His last major Hollywood movie was 'Touch of Evil' in 1958.\n\nIn his later years Welles was honored by the Motion Picture Academy, which awarded him a special Oscar in 1970 for 'supreme artistry'; the Directors Guild of America, and the American Film Institute, which gave Welles its Life Achievement Award in 1975.\n\nReaction to Welles' death came from many of the giants of the movie industry.\n\n'What a shame, and I mean that literally, that one of the finest talents motion pictures has ever had was rejected out-of-hand,' said director John Huston of Welles inability to get backing in Hollywood. 'It's been years since any studio offered Orson an opportunity to direct and it's the world's loss.'\n\nRuth Warrick, who appeared in 'Citizen Kane,' called Welles a genius.\n\n'I feel as if a great light has gone out,' she said. 'I know he will be remembered as a real prophet of our time.'\n\nAmong the more than 60 movies that Welles was involved in were 'The Third Man,' 'Napoleon,' 'Roots of Heaven,' 'Compulsion,' 'Is Paris Burning?' 'A Man For All Seasons,' 'Casino Royale,' and 'Catch-22.'\n\nWelles was married for four years to Rita Hayworth, whom he met in a magic show in the mid-1940s. He was previously married to Virginia Nicholson, a Chicago socialite.\n\nWelles married his third wife, Paola Mori, an Italian actress, in 1955. In addition to his wife, Welles is survived by a child from each of his three marriages, Christopher, Rebecca and Columbina."
