Miss Crawford does\n\nnot like French designs.\n\nFour newlyweds have between\n\nthem contracted 11 marriages\n\nJoan Crawford, wed for the fourth time after an early\n\nmorning plane ride with soft-drink magnate Alfred N. Steele,\n\nwants to go to Capri for a six weeks' honeymoon. Orson Welles.\n\nex-Wonder Boy of Movies, who married 24-year-old Italian\n\nactress Paola Mori at breakfast time on a Sunday morning,\n\nhas taken his bride to France.\n\nBETWEEN them, these\n\nfour matrimonial\n\nadventurers have scored\n\nup a total of 11 marriages.\n\nWhat is surprising Miss\n\nCrawford's Hollywood friends,\n\nwho are surprised, anyway, at\n\nher \"elopement,'\" is that she\n\nis thinking of flying to Capri,\n\nreports Michael Ramsden, of\n\nour New York staff.\n\nBefore she took off from\n\nHollywood for thc Nevada\n\nDesert resort city of Las Vegas\n\nin Mr. Steele's private airliner\n\nshe'd never been up in a\n\nplane. Now her ideas about\n\nflying have changed.\n\nMiss Crawford confided that\n\nMr. Steele had held her in his\n\narms as the plane went up to\n\n11,000 feet to get over the San\n\nGabriel Mountains.\n\n\"The moon shone on the\n\nwings of the plane,\" she\n\nsighed. \"I may never travel\n\nany other way now.\"\n\nThe decision to fly came\n\nquickly. Miss Crawford and\n\nSteele were having dinner to-\n\ngether at Romanoff's when he\n\nsuggested it, and they hurried\n\noff without telling any of her\n\nfilm-star friends in the night-\n\nspot.\n\nSo sudden was the plan,\n\nthey said, that Steele could\n\nnot locate the co-pilot of his\n\nprivate plane, although the\n\npilot was available. The\n\nbridegroom telephoned Ameri-\n\ncan Airlines and hired a co-\n\npilot.\n\nnone Help\n\nSOFT-DRINK TYCOON Alfred N. Steele, presi-\n\ndent of the Pepsi-Cola company, who has had two\n\nother wives besides Miss Crawford. Claiming that\n\nshe now feels like a schoolgirl. Miss Crawford\n\ndescribes her husband simply: \"He is the greatest\n\nman who ever lived,\" she said.\n\n\"We were just sitting around\n\nand talking about how happy\n\nwe were,\" Miss Crawford re-\n\nlated, \"when suddenly Al said,\n\n'Let's fly to Las Vegas and\n\nget married tonight'.\"\n\n\"I said, 'All right; let's go.'\n\nIt was as simple as that.\"\n\nShe agreed the wedding was\n\na surprise. \"But not to us,\"\n\nshe added. \"It was a surprise\n\nto everyone but us.\"\n\nThe plane landed at Las\n\nVegas in the early hours of\n\nMay 10, and the couple drove\n\nto the plush Flamingo Hotel.\n\nChampagne\n\nSTEELE routed a florist out\n\nof bed and asked him to\n\nsupply some flowers, and then\n\nwoke up Municipal Court\n\nJudge John Mendoza and\n\nasked him to come and per-\n\nform the ceremony in the\n\nhotel's penthouse.\n\nA sleepy clerk, who in the\n\nmeantime issued the marriage\n\nlicence shortly before 2 a.m.,\n\nsaid Miss Crawford was \"per-\n\nfectly beautiful.\" The mar-\n\nriage took place about 2.10\n\na.m. A champagne breakfast\n\nfollowed.\n\nThus the 47-year-old Miss\n\nCrawford, whose 30 years in\n\nfilms have made her unofficial\n\n\"Queen\" in Hollywood, was\n\nwedded.\n\nShe is now 54-year-old\n\nSteele's third wife. He is her\n\nfourth husband. Her three\n\nprevious marriages-to actors\n\nDouglas Fairbanks, jun.,\n\nFranchot Tone, and Philif\n\nTerry-ended in divorce. (The\n\nlast, to Terry, broke up in\n\n1946.)\n\nBut she called her new hus-\n\nband \"the greatest man who\n\never lived.\"\n\n\"You know.\" she said,\n\nlaughing, \"he has to be good\n\nto get me up in an aeroplane.\n\nNewsmen were telephoning\n\nthe Flamingo's bridal suite\n\nearly in the morning to ask\n\nif they could take pictures of\n\nthe couple.\n\n\"Heavens, no,\" said the\n\nbride. \"You know me. I\n\ndon't pose in the morning in\n\nan evening gown unless the\n\nscript calls for it.\"\n\nShe explained that a gown\n\nwas the only clothing she had\n\nbrought with her on the spur\n\nof-the-moment flight from\n\nHollywood.\n\n\"We didn't even have time\n\nto pick up a toothbrush,\" she\n\nsaid. \"I arrived without a\n\ncompact or lipstick or any\n\nthing. I even had to borrow\n\na wedding ring and a nightie.\"\n\nHer wedding dress, as she\n\nrevealed later, was a black silk\n\nevening gown interwoven with\n\ngold thread. She also won\n\nan orchid and a fur stole.\n\nMr. Steele had a thoughtful\n\nfriend to thank for the wed-\n\nding ring. Mr. Ben Goffstein,\n\na Las Vegas hotel man who\n\nwas in Europe recently with\n\nhim, produced it.

I'm dying to get\n\nback to them,\" she said.\n\nOf her new husband, she\n\nsaid: \" I'm going to make him\n\nthe best wife in the world. I'm\n\nthe happiest woman alive.\n\n\"I feel,\" she added, \"like a\n\nschoolgirl again.\"\n\nMr. Steele had this to say:\n\nShe is the most wonderful\n\nwife any man could have. I\n\nlove her very much.\"\n\nHe said he had known her\n\nfor nearly three years and\n\nknew he was going to marry\n\nher.\n\nBut the gossip columnists\n\nwere unaware she had eloped.\n\nThat night they were expect-\n\ning her (she seldom misses\n\npremieres) to show up at the\n\nopening of a new play in\n\nHollywood in which ex-hus\n\nband Franchot Tone was star-\n\nring.\n\nMr. Steele, who was a vice\n\npresident of the Coca-Cola\n\nCompany before he joined\n\nPepsi-Cola, has two children.\n\nHe has a boy, Sonny, aged\n\nfive, by his second wife, Lil-\n\nlian, with whom the child lives\n\nin New York.\n\nHe also has a daughter by\n\nhis first wife,Marjorie, whom\n\nhe divorced in Las Vegas\n\neight years ago. Their child,\n\nSally, is now 22 and in Paris.\n\nMiss Crawford has four in\n\nher adopted family: Twins\n\nCathy and Cynthia, aged\n\neight, Christopher, 12, and\n\nChristina, 14.\n\nAround Las Vegas, where\n\ncompetition among the fabu-\n\nous hotels is hotter than the\n\ndesert weather, some hotel\n\nowners might easily have felt\n\na little sour about the wed-\n\nling.\n\nIts publicity value — and\n\nthere was plenty of it — all\n\nwent to the Flamingo, and, of\n\ncourse, the bridal couple.\n\nThere were plenty of indica-\n\ntions that the impromptu wed-\n\nding wasn't as impromptu as\n\nit looked. It had a bit too\n\nmuch of the Hollywood pub-\n\nlicity touch. (Who produced\n\nthe cake at 2.10 a.m.?)\n\nORSON WELLES ran\n\ntrue to form by be-\n\ning \"difficult\"' when he\n\nmarried Paola Mori in\n\nLondon, cabled Anne\n\nMatheson. He gave only\n\n90 minutes' notice for the\n\nceremony . . . and on a\n\nSunday morning.\n\n\"The Third Man\"' got\n\neveryone concerned out of bed\n\nearly on their day of rest for\n\nhis third marriage.\n\nThe Caxton Hall registrar\n\nwho pronounced them man\n\nnone Help\n\nREBECCA HAYWORTH !\n\nWELLES\n\n. . . like Daddy\n\nand wife missed his Sunday\n\ndinner as well as his Sunday\n\nmorning golf. He lives in the\n\ncountry and brought his wife\n\nto London for the ceremony.\n\nThe witnesses, producer\n\nPeter Brook and his actress\n\nwife, Natasha Parry, who like\n\ntheir Sunday mornings undis-\n\nturbed—it's the only day stage\n\npeople have to themselves —\n\nwere up and about and on\n\ntheir way to Westminster at\n\nan hour not much later than\n\ntheir usual one for retiring.\n\nEarliest riser of the wed-\n\nding party was Paola. She\n\nrang the registrar, William\n\nPrince, at his country home\n\njust before 7 a.m.\n\n\"Please,\" she said in her\n\nhusky voice and accented Eng-\n\nlish, \"we want to get married\n\nat 8.30. It's sudden, but can\n\nyou marry us?\"\n\nPrince both could and\n\nwould.\n\nnone Help\n\n8.30 a.m.\n\nWIFE No. 3: Orson Welles and Italian actress Paola Mori,\n\nafter their wedding at Caxton Hall registry office, London,\n\nthis month. Welles' best film role of recent years was\n\n\"The Third Man.\"\n\nThe 40-year-old bridegroom\n\nwore brown tweeds. The bride\n\nwore a grey suit.\n\n''This is just how I wanted\n\nthe wedding,\" Welles told the\n\nregistrar. After that remark\n\nhe kissed his bride.\n\nOrson and Paola took the\n\nmaximum precautions against\n\nfans and fuss. They slipped\n\nin and out a side door, but\n\nthere were no fans to dodge\n\nand only a sprinkling of Press.\n\nGiving the slip to fans who\n\nwere still having a Sunday\n\nmorning laze seemed to ob-\n\nsess the newlyweds.\n\nAs they left the registry\n\noffice Orson announced, \"I\n\nmust take my darling into the\n\ncountry. The place is a sec-\n\nret.\"\n\nThey left by car. At Ken-\n\nsington the car stopped and a\n\ntaxi drew up. Paola jumped\n\nout of the car into the taxi\n\nand was driven off. Orson was\n\ndriven away in the car in the\n\nopposite direction.\n\nThat was so no one would\n\nguess where they were going\n\nfor their one-day honeymoon.\n\nMost of these plans were\n\nworked out by Mr. Welles but\n\nwere carried out by Mrs\n\nWelles.\n\nWhen the wedding was an-\n\nnounced Paola promised she\n\nwould organise it for her hus-\n\nband. She did. She organised\n\nthe whole day, the date, the\n\nfriends, and the lilies of the\n\nvalley — favorite wedding\n\nflowers of Italian brides—that\n\nfilled the quiet little room at\n\nCaxton Hall.\n\nMrs. Welles claims she un-\n\nderstands her husband. She\n\nknows about his being called\n\nmoody, erratic—a genius, but\n\ndifficult—and says she knows\n\nhow to handle such a genius.\n\nWhen she married him she\n\nsaid she would organise him,\n\nhelp him, and understand him.\n\nPaola and Orson claim they\n\nunderstand each other so well\n\nthat they can sit quietly and\n\nperfectly happy together in\n\na restaurant, saying nothing.\n\n\"It is contentment, not\n\nboredom,\" Mrs. Welles says.\n\nPaola says she really loves\n\nto act with Orson. She did in\n\nhis film \"Arkadin.\" \"But I\n\nmarried the man, not the\n\nactor,\" she added.\n\nThe newlyweds left London\n\nfor Paris, then went to Per-\n\npignan.\n\n\"It will not be all honey-\n\nmoon; I have to work,\" said\n\nOrson. \"I'm preparing a\n\ncouple of TV programmes.\n\nIt's a pity, but Paola will get\n\nused to that.\"\n\nPaola merely smiled at this.\n\nThey met in Rome three\n\nyears ago and he proposed to\n\nher in Madrid last year. They\n\nkept the secret until a week\n\nbefore their marriage.\n\nOrson's ideals\n\nORSON WELLES married\n\nRita Hayworth, his second\n\nwife, in 1943, and the marriage\n\nwas dissolved four years later.\n\nHis first wife was Virginia\n\nNicolson. They were divorced\n\nin 1938.\n\nWhen he married Paola he\n\nsaid, \"I take marriage seri-\n\nously. I'm not happy about\n\ndivorce. That's why I've kept\n\nmyself out of marriage until\n\nnow.\"\n\nHe is certain this third mar-\n\nriage is going to last.\n\n\"She can cope with me. and\n\nthat takes some doing,\" he\n\nsaid.\n\nPaola has other plans for\n\nmaking the marriage last.\n\n\"I would like a second cere-\n\nmony in church — maybe in\n\nRome so that my mother could\n\nbe there to see it,\" she said.\n\nPaola, sometimes spell\n\nPaoula (you pronounce it\n\npow-a-lah), speaks fluent Eng-\n\nlish. She is tall and very\n\npretty, with luxuriant, dark\n\nhair and deep, expressive eyes.\n\nShe has a little - girl way of\n\nshrugging and running her\n\nfingers through her hair, which\n\nripples round her shoulders.\n\nShe doesn't use her title of\n\nCountess di Girfalco, dresses\n\nin very casual clothes, rarely,\n\nif ever, wears a hat, and is\n\nunconventional in many ways,\n\neven to not bothering about\n\nan engagement ring.\n\n\"What matters is the mar-\n\nriage,\" she said when announ-\n\ncing her engagement. \"Rings\n\ncan come later.\""
