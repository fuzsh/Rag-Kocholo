        "text": "01 of 30\n\nJennifer Lopez\n\nNumber of Marriages: 4\n\nWhen it comes to saying \"I do,\" Lopez has been around the block four times. After her 11-month union to actor Ojani Noa ended in 1998, the \"Love Don't Cost a Thing\" singer and Shotgun Wedding star married backup dancer Cris Judd in 2001 before divorcing in 2003. She was then married to actor and singer Marc Anthony — with whom she shares two children, Emme and Max — for a decade before the pair finalized their divorce in June 2014.\n\nUpon rekindling their relationship (which first transpired in the early aughts), Lopez and actor Ben Affleck wed in an intimate ceremony in July 2022.\n\n\"I feel so lucky and happy and proud to be with him,\" she told PEOPLE. \"It's a beautiful love story that we got a second chance.\"\n\n02 of 30\n\nBen Folds\n\nNumber of Marriages: 5\n\nSinger-songwriter Ben Folds has been married and divorced five times. His first marriage was to his childhood sweetheart (songwriter Anna Goodman), which lasted from 1987 to 1992. He was then married to Kate Rosen from 1996 to 1997, musical artist Frally Hynes — with whom he shares twins, Louis and Gracie — from 1999 to 2006 and Fleur Stanbrook from 2007 to 2011.\n\nIn 2017, Folds married former Royal Ballet dancer Emma Sandall, and the pair divorced after six years of marriage in February 2024.\n\n03 of 30\n\nJim Edmonds\n\nNumber of Marriages: 4\n\nThe former professional baseball center fielder Jim Edmonds and realtor Kortnie O'Connor tied the knot in September 2022 in front of 32 guests at the Giardino del Mosaico, a 19th-century villa in Lake Como, Italy.\n\n\"The best part of the wedding is I now get to spend the rest of my life with Kortnie,\" Edmonds told PEOPLE. \"For the first time in my life, I finally understand true happiness.\"\n\nHe was previously married to The Real Housewives of Orange County's LeeAnn Horton, who died of cancer in July 2015, and to Allison Jayne Raski, in a marriage that lasted from 2008 to 2014. He had two kids each from both relationships.\n\nEdmonds' third marriage was to Meghan King, which was showcased on The Real Housewives of Orange County. The two married in 2014 and split in 2019. They share three kids: twin boys Hart and Hayes and daughter Aspen.\n\n04 of 30\n\nNicolas Cage\n\nNumber of Marriages: 5\n\nCage was married to Patricia Arquette from 1995 to 2001. He followed that up with a short-lived union with Lisa Marie Presley, whom he married in 2002 and filed for divorce just a few months later. The actor was then married to Alice Kim from 2004 to 2016, with whom he shares a son named Kal-El.\n\nIn 2019, he married make-up artist Erika Koike but requested a divorce just four days after their Las Vegas elopement. The marriage was annulled two months later.\n\nHe surprised fans on March 5, 2021, when news broke he'd wed for a fifth time. The actor and girlfriend Riko Shibata quietly tied the knot on Feb. 16, 2022, in a small ceremony at the Wynn Hotel in Las Vegas. In September of that same year, they welcomed a daughter named August, Cage's third child. (He also shares a son, Weston, with his ex-girlfriend, Christina Fulton.)\n\n\"I'm really happily married,\" he told the Los Angeles Times in 2022. \"I know five is a lot, but I think I got it right this time.\"\n\n05 of 30\n\nZsa Zsa Gabor\n\nNumber of Marriages: 9\n\nZsa Zsa Gabor leads the pack of stars who have been married the most. She married Turkish politician Burhan Asaf Belge in 1935 and divorced him in 1941. She was then married to Hilton Hotels founder Conrad Hilton from 1942 to 1947. Next was actor George Sanders from 1949 to 1954; then investment banker Herbert Hutner, with whom she tied the knot in 1962. Six days after splitting from Hunter on March 3, 1966, she married Joshua S. Cosden Jr., whom she divorced in 1967.\n\nShe wouldn't marry again until she wed designer Jack Ryan in 1975. The pair divorced on Aug. 24, 1976, and she married Michael O'Hara on Aug. 27, followed by another divorce in 1983. Then came her short-lived marriage to actor Felipe de Alba — from April 13, 1983, to April 14, 1983 — which was annulled because her divorce was not yet finalized.\n\nFinally, she wed Frédéric Prinz von Anhalt in 1986; the pair were together until she died at age 99 in 2016. In 2021, von Anhalt traveled to her birthplace of Budapest to bury her ashes.\n\n\"That's what she wanted, and that's what she had in her last will,\" he told Reuters in 2021. \"She definitely wanted to be in Budapest because her father is buried here too.\"\n\n06 of 30\n\nJennifer O'Neill\n\nNumber of Marriages: 9\n\nJennifer O'Neill was married nine times to eight men, the first of whom, Dean Rossiter, she wed in 1965 at just 17. They divorced in 1971, and the actress married her second husband (Joseph Koster) a year later. Following the couple's separation in 1974, O'Neill was married to Chippendales choreographer Nick De Noia — who also served as her manager and was not out at the time — from 1975 until their divorce in 1976. Two years later, she married singer Jeff Barry, whom she divorced in 1979.\n\nLater that year, the actress married John Lederer, though the couple split in 1983. Three years later, she married Richard Alan Brown, and they divorced in 1989. Her next husband was actor Neil L. Bonin, whom she married in 1992; the marriage was annulled a year later. In 1993, she re-married her ex-husband Brown, but the pair divorced again three years later.\n\nSince 1996, she has been married to record producer Mervin Sidney Louque, Jr.\n\n07 of 30\n\nMickey Rooney\n\nNumber of Marriages: 8\n\nTo sum up his love life, Mickey Rooney joked to PEOPLE in 1993: \"Weddings? I've been to a lot of them.\"\n\nThe actor's first of eight marriages was to actress Ava Gardner in 1942, which ended in 1943. He then married Betty Jane Phillips in 1944 — with whom he had two children — and they divorced in 1949. Shortly thereafter, he was wed to model Martha Vickers from 1949 to 1951. He followed that up by marrying actress Elaine Mahnken a year later, whom he divorced in 1958.\n\nIn 1958, Rooney married actress Barbara Ann Thomason — who was murdered in 1966 by a stuntman and actor whom she had been having an affair with. Rooney married his late wife's best friend, Marge Lane, but the pair divorced after just 100 days together. He was then married to Carolyn Hockett from 1969 to 1975. In 1978, he wed singer Jan Chamberlin, and the pair remained married until he died in 2014 (though they had separated in 2012 due to Rooney alleging elder abuse by Chamberlin's son, Christopher Aber).\n\nWhen PEOPLE asked Rooney in 1993 if he'd marry all these women again, he said, \"Absolutely.

He kept saying, 'Jennifer, I hurt you. I was horrible to you, and I can't tell you how sorry I am.'
