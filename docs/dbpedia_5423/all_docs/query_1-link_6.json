        "text": "Rita Hayworth, American actress, dancer, and producer, achieved fame during the 1940s as one of the era's top stars, appearing in 61 films over 37 years.\n\nHowever, while Rita lit up the screen with her sensual beauty and trademark red hair, she paid a high price to get there.\n\nHere is everything you need to know about Rita Hayworth, including her childhood, past loves and the films that she is most famous for.\n\nWhen is Rita Hayworth’s birthday?\n\nRita was born on October 17 1918, in New York City.\n\nWhat was Rita Hayworth’s real name?\n\nHer real name was Margarita Carmen Cansino.\n\nRita Hayworth’s early life\n\nRita's childhood was not a happy one. Her father, Eduardo Cansino, was a Spanish dancer who emigrated to New York in 1913, where Rita was born five years later.\n\nEduardo moved his family to Los Angeles as he hoped Hollywood would bring them fame and fortune.\n\nRita remembered, “I didn't like dancing very much, but I didn't have the courage to tell my father. Rehearse, rehearse, rehearse. That was my girlhood.”\n\nDancing queen – Rita Hayworth’s excellent dance skills\n\nHer father’s failing fortunes – he lost his money during the depression - meant his hopes were pinned on Rita and her natural dance talent.\n\nBy now, Rita was 12 but looked older. Her father took her out of school, dressed her in sexy clothes, added scarlet lipstick and made her his dance partner.\n\nThey toured seedy casinos and nightclubs in Mexico, where child labour laws were less strict.\n\nEduardo made out that his daughter was his wife – and he also overstepped that boundary when he wasn't on the dance floor.\n\nRita Hayworth’s early career\n\nThen Rita was talent-spotted by a Fox film producer. Photos of Rita Cansino show a raven-haired, slightly plump Latin-American dancer.\n\nShe had small parts in a string of films and that might have been the summit of her career. But another man was about to change all that – a 41-year-old lounge lizard and car dealer called Edward Judson.\n\nRita admitted later, “I could never have made the grade in Hollywood without him. I was just too backward. My whole career was his idea.”\n\nWas Rita Hayworth married?\n\nYes – she actually married five times! Aged just 18, she embarked on her first, marrying her manager Edward Judson.\n\nHe saw she could have all-American appeal and changed her name (Hayworth was her mother's maiden name).\n\nJudson was certainly an efficient hustler who got her press coverage and notice, but he was as unscrupulous as her father.\n\nAs Rita remembered, “I married him for love, he married me for an investment. From the first he told me I couldn't do anything for myself. My personality crawled deeper and deeper into a shell.”\n\nRita Hayworth’s lovers\n\nJudson ordered her to sleep with men who could help her career. One of these was the head of Columbia Pictures, the ruthless Harry Cohn, who expected sex from his female stars as part of the deal.\n\nBut even though she had become the mistress of Howard Hughes, Rita courageously drew the line at Cohn. He was too shrewd a film mogul not to see her potential, so nevertheless she was signed to Columbia.\n\nBetween them, Cohn and Judson completed the transformation from Latina dancer to “America's Love Goddess”.\n\nRita lost 20lbs, dyed her luxurious hair auburn and, most extremely, had her hairline raised by electrolysis – a painful procedure that took many months. She also took acting lessons – something she had long wanted to do.\n\nRita Hayworth’s height, hair colour and other vital statistics!\n\nNaturally a brunette, Hayworth found fame as a redhead. She was 5’6 tall and weighed a tiny 8.5 stone.\n\nRita Hayworth’s film career\n\nThe new-look Rita began to be noticed. In 1939 she got critical acclaim playing the unfaithful wife opposite Cary Grant in Only Angels Have Wings and then she made Strawberry Blonde (1941) with James Cagney and You'll Never Get Rich with Fred Astaire. Rita Hayworth was a star, not to mention a favourite pin-up for American troops following the famous photo of her in a negligee in Life magazine. On-screen she was sensual, warm and moved with effortless confidence, off-screen she was shy and quiet, in many ways, a lost, frightened soul. Her father had abused her and her husband pimped her out. No wonder the choreographer Jack Cole noticed, “Rita was a lonely person, you always felt that about her.”\n\nBut her continuing film success (My Gal Sal, You Were Never Lovelier) did give her the strength to finally leave Judson and file for divorce on the grounds of cruelty – encouraged by her then lover, Victor Mature.\n\nRita Hayworth in Gilda (1946)\n\nGilda, made in 1946 and directed by Charles Vidor, is still probably Rita’s best-known role.\n\nStill her best remembered film, Rita played Gilda, alongside Glenn Ford, as a reckless femme fatale, with enough sensual firepower to scorch every man she met. But as Rita pointed out – that was not her.\n\n“Every man I know has fallen in love with Gilda, and awakened with me,” Rita Hayworth said ruefully.\n\nOne strange thing came of the role – it was widely reported that the USA was planning to test an atomic bomb shortly after Gilda’s release, bearing a photo of Hayworth that was cut from an issue of Esquire magazine. While her then-husband Orson Welles said the story made her ‘fly into a terrible rage’, he found the idea rather amusing.\n\nRita Hayworth marriage to Orson Welles\n\nIn September 1943, Rita married actor and director Orson Welles, the man she called the love of her life.\n\nTheir happiness should have been complete with the birth of a daughter, Rebecca. But Orson was another controller.\n\nRita was, in many ways, his Eliza Doolittle. He suggested books she should read and wanted to change her image – hence her short blonde hair and no-dancing role in the film he directed her in, The Lady from Shanghai.\n\nThe marriage broke down and when Rita sued for divorce she said tellingly, “I can't take his genius any more.”\n\nRita Hayworth’s marriage to Aly Khan\n\nHer third marriage got even more publicity than her second. Aly Khan was the playboy son of the fabulously wealthy Aga Khan.\n\nThey were both still married when they started their affair, but managed to get divorced in time so their daughter, Princess Yasmin, could be born in wedlock. Yet despite the scandal, Rita's popularity survived.\n\nThere was something vulnerable about her that made women, as well as men, care about her.\n\nHer Pal Joey co-star Kim Novak said of her, “She was just a tender, sensitive, beautiful human being. Very gentle.”\n\nThe marriage was a short-lived affair that ended in an acrimonious divorce.\n\nRita Hayworth’s fourth marriage, Dick Haymes\n\nSadly, Rita's judgement in men went from bad to worse. Her fourth husband, singer Dick Haymes, had the nickname Mr Evil and he took financial advantage of her before she divorced him too.\n\nAlthough notable films such as Pal Joey and Separate Tables in 1958 were still to come, this was the beginning of Rita's decline.\n\nHer drinking was beginning to affect her ability to perform, but so was something else – the early onset of Alzheimers, although it would be many years before it would be diagnosed.\n\nRita Hayworth’s fifth marriage to James Hill\n\nOne more disastrous short-lived marriage to film producer James Hill, ended in divorce on the grounds of mental cruelty in 1961.\n\nRita Hayworth’s daughters\n\nRita and Orson Welles had daughter Rebecca in December 1944. Rebecca died in 2004 at the age of 59. Rita also had Princess Yasmin Aga Khan with Aly Khan in 1949.\n\nWhat was Rita's final film?\n\nGorgeous Rita's last screen appearance was in 1972 in The Wrath of God. She'd previously continued to work hard throughout the 1960s, and made two films in 1970 - Road to Salina and The Naked Zoo.\n\nRita Hayworth’s death\n\nIn 1977, Rita was finally able to stop drinking, but her erratic behaviour carried on.\n\nIn 1980 she was finally diagnosed with Alzheimer's and put under the care of her daughter Princess Yasmin.\n\nIn 1987, Rita died, aged 69. At her funeral, her pallbearers, all famous Hollywood names, included her Gilda co-star and former lover Glenn Ford.\n\nHer lifelong friend, child actor Jane Withers – who Rita met at Fox when she was still Rita Cansino, gave the eulogy and described her as “a sweet, kind and gentle lady”.\n\nShe had told Rita then – who longed to act but didn't think she could – that acting, “just has to be in your heart”.\n\nBut while Rita Hayworth's heart let loose a carefree joy that lit up the silver screen, Margarita Carmen Cansino's hid a lifetime's pain and endless search for love.\n\nDid Rita Hayworth sing?\n\nDespite appearing in many of the best musicals, Rita was far superior as a dancer than as a singer.\n\nHer singing roles were dubbed by various ghost singers. Here she is, miming to Put the Blame on Mame from Gilda.\n\nRita Hayworth quotes\n\n“Every man I know has fallen in love with Gilda, and awakened with me.”\n\n“Basically I am a good, gentle person, but I am attracted to mean personalities.”\n\n“All I wanted was just what everybody else wants…to be loved.”\n\n“From the time I was 12 I was dancing for bread and butter, but in my heart I was always an actress.”\n\n“Old age – that’s when a woman takes Vitamins A through G, and still looks like H.”\n\n“Movies were much better in the days when I was doing them.”\n\n\"I think all women have a certain elegance about them which is destroyed when they take off their clothes.\"\n\n\"I never really thought of myself as a sex goddess; I felt I was more a comedienne who could dance.\"\n\nRita Hayworth’s best films\n\nPal Joey, 1957\n\nAffair in Trinidad, 1952\n\nSalome, 1953\n\nThey Came to Cordura, 1959\n\nBlood and San, 1941\n\nOnly Angels Have Wings, 1939\n\nSeparate Tables, 1958\n\nThe Loves of Carmen, 1948\n\nYou'll Never Get Rich, 1941\n\nFire Down Below, 1957\n\nDown to Earth, 1947\n\nRita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption\n\nHere he meets Red, who smuggles in various items – he asks him for a poster of Rita Hayworth.\n\nHe covers his wall in pin-up posters and – spoiler alert! – He escapes from prison through a tunnel carefully hidden behind them.\n\nRita Hayworth's diamond bracelet\n\nRita was lucky enough to own some beautiful jewellery. Here’s one of her diamond bracelets, appearing on the Antiques Roadshow.\n\nHow to do Rita Hayworth hair\n\nRecreate her famous Gilda hair waves with this tutorial, discover how she kept her red hair so shiny with these Hollywood beauty tips:\n\nRita Hayworth and Frank Sinatra\n\nFrank Sinatra insisted that Rita was given top billing in Pal Joey. He said, “To me, Hayworth is Columbia. They may have made her a star, but she gave them class”.\n\nFred Astaire and Rita Hayworth\n\nFred Astaire named Rita Hayworth as his favourite dance partner. He said she could learn the steps in the morning, mull over them during lunch and dance in them in the afternoon without a single mistake.\n\nLorna White is a Senior Digital Writer at Yours.co.uk.
