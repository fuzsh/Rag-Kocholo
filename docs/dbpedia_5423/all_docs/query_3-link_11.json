        "text": "Orson Welles produces Rita Hayworth from a steamer trunk, 1943\n\nIn 1943 world famous actor and filmmaker Orson Welles (who was born on this date in 1915) was eager to do something special for the war effort. Though he was a poor physical candidate for service – he rated a 4F – he could do quite a lot in terms of raising money and troop morale. So Welles wrote up a proposal for a circus-like revue that could travel around the country raising funds for the war effort and providing first class entertainment for returning or furloughed service members, who could attend at no cost. For civilians, tickets started at $1.65.\n\nWelles himself was the master of ceremonies and, as The Magnificent Orson, its magician headliner. Welles’ wife, the glamorous Rita Hayworth, also performed a variety of headline acts. Comic relief was provided by Jo-Jo The Great (whom we now know as Joseph Cotten). Other collaborators were the great French star Jean Gabin, who put his great shoulders to work moving scenery, and actor Keye Luke, who was tasked with the creation of culturally respectful Asian scenery and props. Later, after her boss at Columbia forced Hayworth to drop out of the show, Welles was forced to fall back on Hayworth’s understudy, Marlene Dietrich (!).\n\nHere’s the entire advertised bill of fare for a performance of The Mercury Wonder Show:\n\nThe Mercury Wonder ShowFor Service MenProgramORSON THE MAGNIFICENTDefies the laws of science in feats of legerdemain never before presented in America.
