        "text": "Bengaluru's Namma Metro begins trial operations today on the new Green Line extension from Nagasandra to Madavara. Spanning 3.7 km and costing Rs 298 crore, the extension is set to fully open by late September or early October.\n\nBengaluru: Today marks a milestone for Bengaluru’s metro network as Namma Metro launches trial operations on the new Green Line extension, stretching from Nagasandra to Madavara. Covering 3.7 kilometres and with a price tag of Rs 298 crore, this extension is a major step forward in the city’s metro expansion. It’s expected to be fully operational by late September or early October.\n\nPassengers might experience delays today\n\nSince this extension will use existing Green Line trains, passengers might experience slightly longer wait times and travel durations. This new segment will benefit residents in Nelamangala, Makali, and Madanayakanahalli, as well as travelers from Tumakuru, providing easier access to the Bangalore International Exhibition Centre from Nagasandra.\n\nInspection scheduled for September\n\nThe new line will introduce stations at Manjunath Nagar, Chikkabidarakallu (formerly known as Jindal Nagar), and Madavara, which is close to the Bangalore International Exhibition Centre. Currently, the line is undergoing a thorough cleaning and various tests. The Commissioner of Metro Rail Safety is expected to inspect this section in September, according to a report published by The New Indian Express.\n\nThe Managing Director of Bengaluru Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL) mentioned, “We are meticulously preparing with extensive cleaning and numerous tests. The trial run is set to last for a month, and we plan to have the Commissioner of Metro Rail Safety review it by the second week of September.”\n\nWhat delayed the Green Line extension project?"
