        "text": "The Namma Metro in Bengaluru on August 6 began a trial run of the Green Line extension from Nagasandra to Madavara.\n\nAccording to a senior Bengaluru Metro Corporation official, the Green Line will be completely operating for passengers by the end of September or early October of this year. Throughout the trial run period, a technical team from Bengaluru Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL) will oversee various metro train tests.\n\nAccording to The New Indian Express, the new line is 3.7 km long and cost Rs 298 crore. Also, stations on the Green Line will be located in Manjunath Nagar, Chikkabidarakallu (formerly Jindal Nagar), and Madavara (BIEC). As per the report, cleaning and testing are currently underway, with the Commissioner of Metro Rail Safety planned an inspection of the network in September.\n\nMeanwhile, the managing director of Bengaluru Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL), Maheshwar Rao M recently informed that deep cleaning work has begun and that different tests are being conducted. “The trial will last for a month. We intend to invite the Metro Rail Safety Commissioner to inspect by the second week of September,” he told The New Indian Express.\n\nThe managing director of BMRCL stated that because the current project is an extension line and trains from the Green Line will be used, the headway between trains will be larger. This implies that passengers will have to wait longer for the next train.\n\nThe metro services at Madavara are available to commuters from Nelamangala, Makali, and Madanayakanahalli, as well as those entering the city from Tumakuru. Apart from that, the new extended queue will be handy for visitors to the Bangalore International Exhibition Centre near Nagasandra. Officials have stated that the new metro services will make travel more easier for people in these locations.\n\nReportedly, the deadline for the extension project was August 2019. It was, however, delayed for a variety of reasons, including the completion of construction on the Madavara station. The Green Line will be fully operational once the final segment is completed."
