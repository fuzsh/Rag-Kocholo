        "text": "Bengaluru Metro Update: The opening date of the Yellow Line project of the Namma Metro has been postponed until year-end due to the mandatory testing and approvals. Earlier, the opening date was July this year. Read more details here.\n\nBengaluru: Residents of Bengaluru will have to wait a bit longer for the Yellow Line of the Namma Metro, as the project is set to open by the end of this year. The current deadline, July 2024, has been extended to by the authorities to accommodate necessary testing and approvals. The Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL) has announced to begin the trial runs on the Yellow Line in the coming days. The officials will test run the driverless train, which is recently imported from China, including signalling tests on March 7 and 8.\n\nBengaluru Namma Metro: Yellow Line Will Connect\n\nNotably, the 19.5 kilometres Yellow Line of the Namma Metro will connect RV Road with Bommasandra, passing through important locations like Silk Board Junction, Electronics City, and Jayadeva Hospital.\n\nBengaluru Namma Metro: Trial Runs and Necessary Approvals\n\nAccording to Project Manager (Rolling Stock) at BMRCL Jitendra Jha, starting trial runs will be conducted between Bommasandra and Silk Board Junction. The authorities are planning to extend testing to the entire line by mid-April. However, commercial operations of the metro await the arrival of seven trains and their approval from regulatory bodies as the Research Designs and Standards Organisation (RDSO), Railway Board and Commissioner of Metro Rail Safety.\n\nOn the initial stage, the metro trains will operate on Yellow Line trains at intervals of 15 minutes.\n\nBengaluru Namma Metro: Driverless Technology and Testing\n\nThe new metro lines will all be equipped with automated, driverless technology to promise both safety and efficiency in their operations. The Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL) stands behind their use of the Unattended Train Operations (UTO) technology in their design, highlighting it as the solution to collision issues observed in other cities.\n\nBengaluru Namma Metro: Innovative Features for Enhanced Safety and Comfort\n\nDriverless metro trains will be loaded with advanced features like communication between trains to prevent collisions, Artificial Intelligence-based track monitoring, and obstacle detection."
