        "text": "Bangalore Namma Metro\n\nNamma Metro is a rapid transit system serving the city of Bangalore, India6. It is owned by the Bengaluru Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL), a joint venture of the Government of India and the State Government of Karnataka6. The system has a mix of underground, at-grade, and elevated stations, and is the second longest operational metro network in India after Delhi Metro6.\n\nThere are several phases of the Namma Metro project:\n\nNamma Metro Phase 1\n\nNamma Metro Phase 2\n\nNamma Metro Phase 3\n\nNamma Metro Phase 1:\n\nThis phase consisted of two lines totalling 42 km in length, of which 8.82 km are subterranean and the remainder are elevated. There are 40 stations in this phase. Construction began in April 2007 and the phase was inaugurated in October 20114.\n\nNamma Metro Phase 2:\n\nThis phase was approved by Karnataka’s state government in 2011 and by India’s Central Government in 2014. It includes 73.921 km of new routes and is currently under construction. The phase is divided into two parts: Phase 2A and Phase 2B. Phase 2A includes a 18.236 km line with 17 stations, while Phase 2B includes a 55.685 km line with 30 stations1.\n\nThe Namma Metro Phase 2 project was approved by the Indian government in 2014 and includes 73.92 km of new routes2. The project involves both the extension of the two Phase 1 lines in both directions and the construction of two new lines4. The estimated cost for Phase 2 was Rs 26,405 crore, which is expected to escalate to Rs 32,000 crore over time4. As of June 2023, the KR Puram – Central Silk Board section along the Outer Ring Road is under construction as part of Phase 2A, which was first announced in 20163. The deadline for Phase 2A is June 2025.\n\nThe following stations are under Namma Metro Phase 2:\n\nReach 1: Baiyappanahalli to Mahatma Gandhi Road (6.7 km, 6 stations)\n\nReach 2: Mysore Road to Magadi Road (6.4 km, 6 stations)\n\nSouthwest extension: Yelachenahalli to Anjanapura Township (7.5 km, 6 stations)\n\nEastern extension: Baiyappanahalli to Whitefield (15.2 km, under construction) 12\n\nAccording to some sources, the KR Pura – Whitefield (Kadugodi) section of Phase 2 is set to be inaugurated on March 26, 2023. However, other sources suggest that the completion date for Phase 2A is June 2025, and that the entire Phase 2 project may not be completed until 2027. In January 2023, the Karnataka Chief minister stated that Phase 2 would be completed before 2024. It is unclear which of these estimates is the most accurate.\n\nBangalore metro stations list: Phase 2\n\nPhase 2 of the project has a new line between Silk Board and KR Puram that is designated as Phase-2A. Silk Board, HSR Layout, Agara, Ibbalur, Bellandur, Kadubeesanahalli, Kodibisanahalli, Marathahalli, ISRO, Doddanekundi, DRDO Sports Complex, Sarasvathi Nagara (formerly Mahadevapura), and KR Puram are the 13 stations that would be on this line, which is planned to travel along the Outer Ring Road.\n\nThe proposed RV Road – Bommasandra line (Yellow Line), also known as the ORR Metro Line or Blue Line, and the enlarged Purple Line will both feature interchange stations at KR Puram and Silk Board, respectively.\n\nNamma Metro Phase 3\n\nThis phase is already in the preparation stages, with 105.55 km of routes looked at since 2015. Pre-feasibility and feasibility studies are underway, and the final detailed project report (DPR) is expected to be completed soon. The phase will include several new lines and extensions, but an accurate representation of Phase 3 will appear only after the DPR is finalized and approved2.\n\nThe third phase of the Namma Metro project is currently in the planning stage, with routes totalling 105.55 km being explored since 20152. The estimated cost of the project is Rs 16,300 crore. The project will cover 44.65 km in two corridors in Bengaluru3. Construction on Phase 3 is expected to begin in 2025 and end in the mid-2030s. However, multiple changes in the project’s scope and alignment can be expected to take place before construction begins2.\n\nThe completion estimate for Phase 3 is not finalized yet. However, according to a recent report, activists and commuters want Phase 3 planning to be hastened, focusing on metropolitan regions because the BMRCL has set a 2024 target for completion6.\n\nThe list of stations for Namma Metro Phase 3:\n\nLine 3 (Gottigere – Nagawara): Gottigere, Hulimavu, IIMB, JP Nagar 4th Phase, Jayadeva Hospital, Ragigudda Temple, National Dairy Research Institute, BTM Layout, Silk Board, HSR Layout, Agara, Bellandur, Kadubeesanahalli, Marathahalli, Doddanekundi, ISRO, Mahadevapura, Garudacharpalya, Kalyan Nagar, HBR Layout, Nagawara\n\nLine 4 (Kempegowda International Airport – KR Puram): KIA Terminal 2, KIA Cargo, Trumpet Junction, Hebbal, Vishwanath Naganahalli, Jakkur Cross, Yelahanka, Bagalur Cross, Kattigenahalli, Doddajala, Kogilu Cross, Kannur, Venkateshpura, Tannisandra, Kadugondanahalli, Kasturi Nagar, Horamavu, HRBR Layout, Kalyan Nagar, HBR Layout, Nagawara, Veerannapalya, Kempapura, Kodigehalli, Jyothipura, KR Puram\n\nNote that the above lines and extensions are contenders for Phase 3 until the DPR is finalized and approved2.\n\nNamma Metro Route Map"
