Click Here!\n\nCheck Out Some Properties In Bengaluru\n\nBengaluru Metro\n\nBengaluru Metro, also known as Namma Metro, is a rapid transit system serving the city of Bengaluru, India. The network consists of four colour-coded lines, with a total operational length of 42.3 km and a total of 41 stations. It is the second longest operational metro network in India, after the Delhi Metro. The first phase of the metro system opened in October 2011, and the lines have since been extended, with the most recent expansion opening in October 2023.\n\nThe Bengaluru Metro Rail Company Ltd (BMRCL) manages the Bengaluru Metro. They have equipped the metro with modern amenities like Wi-Fi, security cameras (CCTV), and comfortable seating to ensure passengers have a pleasant and safe journey. Additionally, the metro features an advanced ticketing system that allows passengers to pay for their trips using either tokens or pre-paid cards, making commuting hassle-free.\n\nBengaluru's metro system is recognised for easing traffic jams, enhancing air quality, and offering effective public transportation. Moreover, the metro's presence has benefited the local economy, as evidenced by the increasing construction in neighbourhoods near metro stations.\n\nLatest Updates On Bengaluru Metro\n\nImage Source: iStock\n\nBengaluru Metro Rail Company Limited had finished Phases 1 and 2A of the Bengaluru Metro by the deadline of September 2021.\n\nThe East-West and North-South corridors of Phase 1 have a combined length of 42.3 km and 41 stops. The Silk Board to KR Puram corridor, which spans 18.8 km and has 17 stops, is part of Phase 2A.\n\nThe Bengaluru Metro's Phases 2B and 2C have also begun construction under the direction of BMRCL.\n\nThere are two roads that will be built as part of Phase 2B. The first corridor will span a 37 km route with 17 stations from KR Puram to Kempegowda International Airport. The second corridor will span a 25 km route with 19 stations from Nagawara to Gottigere.\n\nFrom K R Puram to Central Silk Board, a 31.3 km long railway is being built as part of Phase 2C. There will be 30 stations in total for this segment.\n\nPhase 3 of the Bengaluru Metro, which includes four new lines and 94 stations spanning a distance of 105 km, has also been suggested by BMRCL. However, the Phase 3 detailed project report was still being written as of the deadline.\n\nIt is significant to note that the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic may have affected building activities on the Bengaluru Metro, and there may have been potential delays in the projects' completion but, recently Bengaluru Metro has come one step closer to the completion of the project.\n\nThe Bengaluru Metro Rail Corporation (BMRCL) has started commercial operations on the 13.71 km Whitefield (Kadugodi) to KR Puram Metro stretch, making it the city's first tech corridor to be connected to the Namma Metro network. The inauguration of this new line was done by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on March 25, 2023, and the operations started from March 26, 2023. Whitefield, Channasandra, Kadugodi, Pattandur Agrahara, Sri Satya Sai Hospital, Nallur Halli, Kundalahalli, Seetharam Palya, Hoodi Junction, Garudacharpalya, Mahadevapura, and KR Puram are among the 12 metro stations on the KR Puram-Whitefield line.\n\nA 1.3 km extension of the purple line from Kengeri to Challaghata is set to open shortly. The line passes through the central business districts of the city, including M.G. Road, Vidhana Soudha, and Majestic Station.\n\nThe Bengaluru Metro Rail Corporation Limited is set to add another critical line to the Namma Metro network in the city by July. The Yellow Line will connect RV Road in South Bengaluru to Bommasandra in the southeast of the city. The 19-kilometre corridor will have 16 stations and will intersect with the upcoming Pink Line (Gottigere-Nagawara) at Jayadeva Hospital and with the Blue Line at Central Silk Board Station. This new Yellow Line will enhance the mass rapid transit system beyond the existing network comprising North-South (Nagasandra-Silk Institute) and East-West (Byappanahalli-Kengeri) corridors. Starting from the RV Road station on the Green Line, the Yellow Line will have stations at Ragigudda, Jayadeva Hospital, BTM Layout, Central Silk Board, Bommanahalli, Hongasandra, Kudlu Gate, Singasandra, Hosa Road, Beratena Agrahara, Konappana Agrahara, Electronic City, Huskuru Road, Hebbagodi, and Bommasandra.\n\nBengaluru's Namma Metro recently renamed six stations on the 13.71-km stretch of the Purple Line extension under Phase 2 of the project. This move was made to enable commuters to easily identify the stations by their local names.\n\nThe new names are as follows:-\n\nKrishnarajapuram (formerly KR Puram),\n\nWhitefield has been changed to Whitefield (Kadugodi)\n\nSingayyappanapalya (formerly Mahadevapura),\n\nHoodi (formerly Hoodi Junction),\n\nHopefarm Channasandra (formerly Channasandra),\n\nKadugodi Tree Park (formerly Kadugodi).\n\nNamma Metro is set to make progress on the construction of its next major project, the Outer Ring Road Metro Line. The line runs from Central Silk Board to KR Puram. The 19km Outer Ring Road Metro Line is expected to become operational in 2025-26 and will have 13 stations.\n\nIn another significant development, the KR Puram-KIA line of the Bengaluru Metro has achieved a breakthrough with the launch of the first two sets of U-girders close to Chikkajala. A total of 784 U-girders will be launched in package 3 to construct the 15.1km connecting IAF Yelahanka to the KIA terminal. The completion of this line is expected to ease the travel of passengers between the airport and the city centre, thereby benefiting the city's economy.\n\nThe Byappanahalli-KR Puram Metro segment in Bengaluru is set to open on July 15. This 2-kilometre extension will connect the Purple Line to the Green Line, reducing traffic congestion and improving connectivity in the city. The project is part of Namma Metro's Phase 2 expansion and includes six modern stations - Byappanahalli, Hoodi, Mahadevapura, KR Puram, and KR Puram Bus Stand.\n\nJune 8, 2023: Bengaluru is set to introduce four new metro lines, according to Deputy Chief Minister D K Shivakumar. These lines include Baiyappanahalli-KR Puram, Kengeri-Chellaghatta, Nagasandra-Madavara, and RV Road-Bommasandra. The metro expansion aims to enhance connectivity, reduce traffic congestion, and provide efficient transportation options in the city. The new lines will bridge existing gaps, interconnect key metro stations, and facilitate seamless transfers between different routes.\n\nDetails of the four new metro lines:\n\nBaiyappanahalli-KR Pura Line: This 2.1-kilometre line will interconnect the Baiyappanahalli and KR Pura metro stations, efficiently linking the Purple Line with the Green Line.\n\nKengeri-Chellaghatta Line: Stretching over 1.9 kilometres, this line will connect the Kengeri metro station on the Green Line with the Chellaghatta metro station on the Purple Line, facilitating swift transit between these two crucial routes.\n\nNagasandra-Madavara Line: Covering a distance of 3 kilometres, this line will bridge the gap between the Nagasandra metro station on the Purple Line and the Madavara metro station on the Blue Line, enabling convenient travel and seamless transfers.\n\nRV Road-Bommasandra Line: Extending over a remarkable 19.14 kilometres, this line will link the RV Road metro station on the Green Line with the Bommasandra metro station on the Blue Line, significantly improving accessibility to the bustling Electronics City.\n\nJune 9, 2023: The Bengaluru Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL) has proposed the construction of three new metro lines covering approximately 77 kilometres in Bengaluru. These lines aim to expand the metro network and connect important areas within the city and its outskirts.\n\nThe proposed lines include a route from Whitefield to Hoskote, an Inner Ring Road running inside the Outer Ring Road, and a line from Old Airport Road via the Marthahalli underpass to Varthur and Kadugodi.\n\nThe BMRCL has also provided updates on ongoing projects, including proposals for the JP Nagar to Kempapura and Hosahalli to Kadabgere Metro lines. Trial runs on the Baiyappanahalli-K R Puram Metro stretch are scheduled to start in July. The expansion plans aim to improve connectivity, reduce traffic congestion, and provide efficient transportation options for residents and commuters in Bengaluru.\n\nJune 26: The Pink Line Metro in Bengaluru is scheduled to launch in December 2024, bringing enhanced connectivity and convenience to the city. The Pink Line Metro in Bengaluru will have 18 stations along its route. The stations include Kalena Agrahara (Gottigere), Hulimavu, Indian Institute of Management Bengaluru, Jayaprakash Nagar 4th Phase, Jayadeva Hospital, Tavarekere, Dairy Circle, Lakkasandra, Langford Town, National Military School, Mahatma Gandhi Road, Shivajinagar, Cantonment Railway Station, Pottery Town, Tannery Road, Venkateshpuram, Kadugondanahalli, and Nagawara.\n\nThe construction progress is promising, with tunnelling works successfully completed and the underground and elevated sections well underway. Stations are nearing completion, with only finishing works remaining. Track laying is expected to commence by October 2023. The Pink Line Metro's development demonstrates Bengaluru's commitment to expanding its metro network and improving transportation connectivity for its residents.\n\nJuly 24, 2023: The Bengaluru Metro is set to open the Jayadeva multi-level interchange station, the largest in the city, partially by the end of 2023. The station will be a part of the Yellow Line from RV Road to Bommasandra and the Pink Line from Kalena Agrahara to Nagawara. It can handle 25,000 passengers during peak hours. The Yellow Line's opening is expected by the end of 2023, while the Pink Line is scheduled for March 2025. The Pink Line was scheduled to commence in December 2024 but it has been delayed to early 2025.\n\nThe Pink Line will have 18 stations, with 12 underground and six elevated. Bengaluru will have three interchange Metro stations when the Yellow Line linking to Electronics City opens. BMRCL faced challenges during construction, but it aims to increase Metro ridership by 2 lakh with the Yellow Line's opening. The Pink Line's tunnel network construction from Dairy Circle to Nagawara is almost 80% complete, with the goal of opening the entire line at once.\n\nSeptember 01, 2023: Starting from September 1, Bengaluru's Namma Metro has initiated extra train services during weekday morning peak hours, specifically between the Mahatma Gandhi Road station and the Nadaprabhu Kempegowda Majestic metro stations. This move aims to address the significant foot traffic on the Purple Line during rush hours and is considered a trial run for additional services on this particular route.\n\nBangalore Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL) has announced that similar enhancements will be introduced on other metro lines in the near future. Passengers travelling beyond Mahatma Gandhi Road station toward Baiyappanahalli will need to transfer to another metro train at the Mahatma Gandhi Road station. This decision comes in response to the growing demand for a more comfortable and efficient public transport experience, particularly during peak times.\n\nSeptember 21, 2023: Bengaluru Metro's Purple Line Phase 3 is nearing completion and set to fully operate by mid-September, enhancing public transportation in the city. This expansion connects eastern Bengaluru to various parts of the city through two crucial stretches: Kengeri – Challaghatta and KR Puram – Baiyappanahalli. CMRS inspection is scheduled for September 21 for KR Puram – Baiyappanahalli section, with operations expected to commence by September 29. It's anticipated to increase daily ridership from 6.2 lakh to 7 lakh passengers, reflecting Bengaluru's commitment to improving public transportation. Kengeri–Challaghatta's inspection will also be announced soon.\n\nHowever, the Yellow Line (RV Road - Bommasandra) may not meet its December 2023 deadline due to rolling stock supply delays, with arrival expected in October 2023.\n\nNovember 07, 2023:\n\nBengaluru's Namma Metro Phase 3 has received approval from the Finance Department, allowing the project to move forward. This 44-kilometre metro expansion comprises two lines and is vital for the city's transportation network. The decision comes after delays and bureaucratic hurdles, with the state government now granting consent for preliminary work, which includes land acquisition and utility relocation. Precedents from previous phases and efficient planning by the Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL) have helped expedite the process. A revised Detailed Project Report (DPR) has been submitted, featuring plans for improved transportation connectivity in the city. This development is crucial for addressing Bengaluru's infrastructure needs and promises enhanced connectivity for its residents.\n\nMarch 15, 2024: The Bengaluru Metro got a major boost with approval for Phase 3, which will connect the entire Outer Ring Road (ORR) with the metro network. This includes a 32-km stretch on the western ORR from Hebbal to JP Nagar and a 12.5-km line on Magadi Road. Expected to be completed by 2028, the project will add 22 stations on the western ORR and 9 stations on Magadi Road, improving traffic flow and offering more public transportation options for Bengaluru residents.\n\nNamma Metro Route Map\n\nIn Bengaluru, the metro system currently has two main lines: the Purple Line and the Green Line.\n\nThe Purple Line stretches across 45 kilometres and serves a total of 37 stations, connecting Whitefield to Challaghatta.\n\nOn the other hand, the Green Line links Madavara and Silk Institution, covering a distance of 31 kilometres and featuring 32 stations.\n\nRecently, an extension to the Purple Line was constructed, known as the Whitefield-Krishnarajapuram Metro. This expansion project cost approximately Rs 4,000 crore. It encompasses new stations, including Krishnarajapuram, Singayyanapalya, Garudacharpalya, Hoodi, Seetharam Palya, Kundalahalli, Nallurhalli, Sri Sathya Sai Hospital, Pattandur Agrahara, Kadugodi Tree Park, Hopefarm Channasandra, and Whitefield (Kadugodi). This extension further enhances the city's metro network, providing additional transportation options for residents and commuters.\n\nBengaluru Metro Lines And Its Role In Connectivity\n\nPurple Line\n\nThe first operational Bengaluru metro line was the Purple Line. It was started under phase 1 of the Bengaluru route with 37 stations and 4 interchanges. Purple Line started with the first underground metro station in Bengaluru.\n\nThe Namma Metro Purple Line consists of several stations, each serving as a key point for commuters. Starting from Whitefield, where you can easily connect to the Whitefield railway station or Kadugodi Bus Stand, the line moves through stations like Channasandra, Kadugodi, Pattandur Agrahara, and Sadaramangala.

A study by the city traffic police found that Namma Metro has reduced traffic congestion by up to 10% on major roads in the city. This is because many people who used to drive their own vehicles to work and college have now switched to using the metro.\n\nThe metro is a more efficient way to travel than cars and buses, as it can carry a large number of people in a short amount of time. Additionally, the metro is not affected by traffic congestion, so passengers can be sure that they will arrive at their destination on time.\n\nThe impact of Namma Metro on traffic congestion is particularly noticeable during peak hours. On the Purple Line, which connects the city centre to the IT hub of Whitefield, traffic congestion has been reduced by up to 20% during peak hours. This has made it much easier for people to travel to and from work and has also led to a reduction in air pollution.\n\nNamma Metro is still under construction, and once the entire network is completed, it is expected to have an even greater impact on traffic congestion in Bengaluru. The metro is also expected to play a key role in the development of the city's Outer Ring Road, which is currently one of the most congested roads in the city.\n\nTourist Attractions Near Bengaluru Metro Station\n\n1) Lalbagh Botanical Garden - The Lalbagh Metro Station on the Green Line is close to this well-known tourism destination.
