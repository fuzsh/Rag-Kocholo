        "text": "Synopsis\n\nNamma Metro's Green Line extension from Nagasandra to Madavara on Tumakuru Road is set to begin operations by October. This new stretch introduces three additional stations. The trial runs are likely to start soon. Upon completion, the extension will boost the metro network to 76 kilometers. The extended line is likely to alleviate traffic congestion, improving accessibility for Bengaluru residents.\n\nThe extended Green Line of Namma Metro, stretching from Nagasandra to Madavara (BIEC) on Tumakuru Road, is set to commence commercial operations by October. Maheshwar Rao, MD of Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL), confirmed that trial runs will soon begin on the 3-kilometer stretch, a TOI report stated.\n\nNamma Metro Green Line Extension Stations\n\nThe extension, part of Namma Metro's Phase II, introduces three new stations: Manjunathnagar, Chikkabidarakallu, and Madavara. The line will open after receiving safety clearance from the Commissioner of Metro Railway Safety (CMRS), anticipated by September. This addition will expand the metro network in Bangalore to 76 kilometers.\n\nA BMRCL official noted, \"On the Green Line, at present, trains terminate at Nagasandra on Tumakuru Road. Once the extended line becomes operational, trains services will be operated till Madavara. However, depending on the patronage, a decision will be taken on the frequency of services.\" BMRCL expects the extended service to increase ridership by 25,000 to 30,000 passengers.\n\nNamma Metro Green Line Extension: Construction Progress\n\nRegarding Madavara station's construction, an official stated, \"Work is nearing completion at Madavara. Traction power supply is done in the other two stations and will be done shortly at Madavara. We are getting ready for trial tests on the line; it will happen in the next couple of weeks.\"\n\nBengaluru Metro to ease traffic\n\nThe extension to Madavara will offer numerous benefits, including seamless access to the Bangalore International Exhibition Centre, a key venue for consumer and industrial expos. It will also facilitate easier travel for people from Nelamangala and nearby villages, helping them avoid traffic congestion. Additionally, the availability of parking for long-distance buses at Madavara station will enable passengers to switch to the Metro easily.\n\nYou Might Also Like:\n\nBangalore Metro announces opening date for Namma Metro's Yellow line: Check details\n\nNamma Metro Phase II Extensions\n\nUnder Phase II, BMRCL has extended its operational lines in four directions. Three of these extensions—from Mysuru Road to Challaghatta, Yelachenahalli to Silk Institute, and Byappanahalli to Whitefield—are already operational. BMRCL had previously faced delays due to construction challenges, land acquisition issues, and the pandemic, affecting project timelines.\n\nOther ongoing projects include new lines from Kalena Agrahara to Nagawara, RV Road to Bommsandra, and Silk Board to Kempegowda International Airport. The transport department and traffic police had once considered relocating private bus operations to areas like Kengeri, Madavara, and KR Puram, but this plan was dropped. However, with the Yellow Line from RV Road to Electronics City set to open, commuters will soon have the option to travel from Madavara to Electronics City, with an interchange facility at RV Road linking the Green and Yellow lines.\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\n15 Atmanirbhar stocks to include in your portfolio this Independence Day\n\nFive reasons why India’s Economic Survey mentioned Apple five times\n\nThe Ola Electric story: What makes Bhavish Aggarwal India's most impatient man?\n\nWhy Akasa’s losses are mounting when IndiGo is posting record profits\n\nYour EV is 40% Chinese, and will remain so if this jigsaw is not solved\n\nWhy success of Blackstone’s repeat IT bet depends on these ifs and buts\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3"
