        "text": "Bengaluru: A new chapter in the history of Bengaluru Metro Rail is ready to be unveiled. The first Driverless Metro Train services will be made available in a few months. Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL) announced that the first six-coach train has reached Bangalore from China.\n\nIt stated that these coaches have been moved to Hebbagodi depot in Electronic City. This train will run from RV Road on Yellow Line to Electronic City via Silk Board. A Chinese firm has manufactured these driverless metro train and coaches. BMRCL has signed an agreement with the company to manufacture 216 coaches. 15 trains with 90 coaches will be arranged and run on the Yellow Line. A sample train has now arrived,\" BMRCL officials said.\n\nIn 2019, a Chinese company won a Rs 1,578 crore contract to supply 216 coaches. As part of this, the model train coaches were sent from China on January 24 and reached Chennai port on February 8. Various types of tests were conducted and the results submitted to the Railway Department and technical permission has been sought.\n\nOfficials estimate that it will take about five to six months to complete this entire process. Although the civil and track works have already been completed on the Yellow Line, the trial run has not begun as the coaches are not available. A trial run will be conducted on the 19.15 km Yellow Line after installing a prototype train with six coaches."
