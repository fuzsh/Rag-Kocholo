        "text": "The launch of commercial operations on the 3.7-km extension of Bengaluru's Namma Metro ‘Green’ Line, stretching from Nagasandra to Madavara in north Bengaluru, is facing delays and is now anticipated to commence only by the end of September.\n\nThe elevated route from Nagasandra to Madavara encompasses three stations: Manjunathnagar, Chikkabidarakallu and Madavara. This extension will provide crucial connectivity to the Bangalore International Exhibition Centre (BIEC) located on Tumakuru Road.\n\nOnce operational, residents in areas such as Manjunathanagar, Chikkabidarakallu, Madavara, Tumakuru Road, Anchepalya, and Jindal Nagar will experience reduced travel times to Nagasandra metro station, currently more than five kilometres away.\n\nOfficials from the Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL) have cited pending final testing of equipment and infrastructure as the primary reason for the delay.\n\nConstruction on this elevated extension began back in 2017 with initial expectations to complete by mid-2019. However, setbacks such as delays in land acquisition and disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic have resulted in missed deadlines.\n\n“The track work has been completed. The line will undergo testing over the next two months. We expect to commence operations by the end of September. After trial runs and an inspection by the Commissioner of Metro Rail Safety, the line will be opened for revenue services,” stated an official from the BMRCL,reports The Hindu.\n\nThe BMRCL opened the extended line on the southern part of the Green Line from Yelachenahalli to Silk Institute on Kanakapura road in January 2021. The total length of the Green Line will be 33 km, once the extended stretch till BIEC becomes operational.\n\nAs of April 2023, the BMRCL has completed 92.54 per cent of civil works from Manjunathnagar to BIEC.\n\nLand acquisition delays caused hinderances to the project. BMRCL has set a new deadline for the completion of work on the metro line, with the aim of opening for commercial operation in September."
