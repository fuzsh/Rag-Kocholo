        "text": "Details, visuals and general information about the Namma Metro, a metro system inaugurated on 20 October 2011. The network length is over 42.3 kilometres and serves through 41 stations on two lines.\n\nThe system doesn’t have a specific alternative name. It serves approximately 50,000 passengers per day. Fares are fixed at Rs 10. Information on 24-hour operation, air conditioning, walking between platforms, driverless trains and screen doors on platforms is not available.\n\nThe system operates at an average speed of 32km/h and can reach a maximum speed of 80km/h. It is operated by the Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Ltd (BMRC). The operating hours are from 6:00 to 22:00 from Monday to Sunday. The fare is 5 rupees.\n\nFor more details, please refer to the Namma Metro Official Website.\n\nMap of Namma Metro\n\nMap of Namma Metro showing different lines. Click on the map to enlarge it.\n\nAbout Namma Metro\n\nThe Namma Metro, located in the Indian city of Bangalore, became operational in October 2011. The metro currently consists of two lines with 16 stations and a total length of 42.3 kilometres. The Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Ltd. (BMRCL) oversees its operation.\n\nIn 2015, the metro system reportedly carried over 50,000 passengers daily. However, compared to Bangalore’s metropolitan population of 5.7 million, ridership remains relatively low.\n\nExpansion plans are underway for the Namma Metro, with an additional 41 stations expected to be added in 2015, marking the completion of Phase I. Phase II is expected to be completed by 2019, expanding the system to 4 lines, 102 stations and 115 kilometres of track.\n\nProject Management and Phases\n\nThe Namma Metro project is managed by the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) and work began in the early 2000s. The project was planned to be completed in two phases.\n\nPhase I involved the construction of two lines, the Purple Line and the Green Line, which intersect at right angles. At the end of this phase, the system was 33 kilometres long and served 32 stations. Two main axes were formed, a horizontal one from east to west, 18 kilometres long, and a vertical one from north to south, 15 kilometres long. The central area of the city had 9 kilometres of underground circulation, while the rest of the line was built on elevated viaducts.\n\nNamma Metro Lines\n\nThe project currently has two operating lines: the purple line and the green line.\n\nPurple Line\n\nThe Purple Line will open in 2011. By the end of Phase I, it is expected to have 17 stations over nearly 18 kilometres. Once Phase II is completed, the Purple Line will extend to 40.1 kilometres with 36 stations. Currently, there are only 6 active stations along a 6.7 kilometre stretch. The line connects Baiyappanahalli to Mahatma Gandhi Road, with most of the route being underground, serving as the east-west axis of the system.\n\nGreen Line\n\nCurrently, the Green Line is 10.5 kilometres long and serves 13 stations. This line, which has been operational since March 2014, extends from Nagasandra in the north to Sampige Road in the south. Upon completion of Phase II, this line will extend to 40.1 kilometres with 32 stations.\n\nYellow Line\n\nThe Yellow Line is a planned addition to Phase II of the Namma Metro project. This line will connect RV Road to Bommasandra, cover almost 19 kilometres and serve 16 stations.\n\nRed Line\n\nAnother line planned for Phase II is the Red Line, which will run between Gottigere and Nagavara. This line will be 21.2 kilometres long and serve 18 stations.\n\nOperation Hours and Frequency\n\nFor the Purple Line, which runs from Baiyappanahalli to MG Road (Reach 1), the metro operates from 6:00 am to 10:00 pm. The service frequency is every 15 minutes from 6:00 am to 8:00 am and from 8:00 pm to 10:00 pm. Between 8:00 am and 8:00 pm the frequency is every 10 minutes.\n\nTicket Fares and Types\n\nNamma Metro accepts both contactless cards and tokens. Tokens are sold for one-way journeys and are valid for 30 minutes after purchase. It is important to return the token at the departure gate to avoid fines.\n\nFrequent travellers can purchase the Namma Metro Travelcard for discounts of up to 15-21% over tokens. The card costs Rs50 and journeys are charged separately.\n\nMap of Namma Metro from Wikipedia\n\nParking Facilities\n\nParking is available at Swami Vivekananda Road station and Baiyappanahalli station. However, these are not free services. Payment can be made in cash or with flash cards. Hybrid and electric vehicles can park for free. The parking fee for a full day is Rs50 for cars and Rs25 for bicycles.\n\nInteresting Facts\n\nSmoking, drinking and eating on trains is prohibited. There are customer service counters at all stations. LED displays provide real-time train arrival information. WIFI is available at stations.\n\nA proposed Light Rail Transit (LRT) network is in the works, with a 31-kilometre line between Bannerghatta Road and Hebbal, and another 9-kilometre line between Magadi Road and the Peripheral Ring Road, with 40 stations, to complement Bangalore’s transport systems."
