Namma Metro, the metro system in Bengaluru, the official name of Bangalore, is booming. Bangalore is the capital and largest city of the southern Indian state of Karnataka and the country’s IT hub.

A NEW AUTOMATIC METRO LINE

​​The contract won by Indian an French SYSTRA teams for the new elevated Yellow Line of the Bangalore Metro is the result of close collaboration within SYSTRA’s Systems Teams. We will be assisting our client Bengaluru Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL) in the choice of suppliers for the implementation of GoA 4* along the entire length (almost 19km) of the line on which construction began at the end of 2017.

SYSTRA’s scope includes the review of design documents to be submitted by contractors of various disciplines like Signalling, Rolling Stock, Communication and Power Supply for their adequacy in introducing GoA4 operation from the start of commercial services scheduled for 2023.

*GoA: Grade of Automation: a 4-level assessment of the degrees of automation of a transport system.

The award of this project follows our contract last year for implementation of UTO Operation on lines 7 and 8 of the Delhi Metro and reinforces our outstanding reputation in the provision of advanced technological solutions in the Metro Systems field.

Benefits for commuters and the environment

The Bangalore Metro has become one of the preferred modes of public transport for the inhabitants of the city, offering safe, fast and convenient travel at a reasonable cost. As the network grows, more and more cars will be taken off the roads, thereby reducing emissions of greenhouse gases and improving the quality of the air.
