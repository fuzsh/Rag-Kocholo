Out of the 66 operational metro stations of Namma Metro as of October 2023, there are 57 elevated stations, eight underground stations and one at-grade station. The system runs on standard-gauge tracks.

Bengaluru Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL), a joint venture of Government of India and the State Government of Karnataka, is the agency for building, operating and expanding the Namma Metro network.[13] Services operate daily between 05:00 and 24:00 running with a headway varying between 3â€“15 minutes.[14][15] The trains initially began with three coaches but later grew to six coaches as ridership increased.[16] Power is supplied by 750V direct current through third rail. As of March 2024, the metro system had an average daily ridership of about 636,000 passengers annually.[17] On August 14 2024, the ridership was 9.17 lakh - highest recorded so far in the history of namma metro.[18]
