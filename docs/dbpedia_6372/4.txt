The Bengaluru Metro, also called the Namma Metro, is a rapid transit system for large groups of people. It has stops at ground level, on platforms, and underground. In recent news, the Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL) said that travellers in the city can now use the metro until late at night on both the purple and green lines. Also, the Purple Line opened on October 9, 2023, running from Whitefield (Kadugodi) to Challaghatta.

In October 2011, the Namma train began running. The idea is unique because it will be the first metro in Southern India to have underground routes. Read on to learn more about Bangalore Metro:
