        "text": "Interactions of the P Subunit with L\n\nThe most important new feature was interpretable density for parts of P (Figure S4), enabling us to model three ordered segments from residues 49 to 56, 82 to 89, and 94 to 105 ( and ). The first segment binds in a shallow pocket on the outward-facing surface of the CTD. The interactions are mostly hydrophobic around a conserved tyrosine residue PTyr53 that also hydrogen bonds to the side chain of LAsp1981 ( ). P then wraps around the CTD with a stretch of flexible residues that we can detect in low-pass-filtered density maps (Figure S4B). The second segment binds between the CTD and the RdRp and interacts with the C-terminal arm as it inserts along the edge of the RdRp. This P segment appears to interact with hydrogen bonds that involve main-chain atoms, either the amino nitrogen or carbonyl oxygen. These interactions, which do not directly depend on side-chain residues, explain the relaxed conservation of residues in segment 2. Binding is further stabilized by hydrophobic contacts of PVal84 and PPhe87 and a salt bridge between PGlu85 and the CTD residue LLys2022 ( ). The third segment lies in the groove between the CTD and the connector. We count two salt bridges and two hydrogen bonds at this binding site. One hydrogen bond, between PGlu99 and LGly1911, connects to the CTD. The PTyr95 side chain stacks between LArg1419 and LTyr1438. A conserved PVal102 lies a hydrophobic L pocket, and a conserved PPhe104 stacks on LPro1535 ( ). The CTD is thus an adaptor domain of L for its association with P, which then stabilizes the closed conformation by reinforcing interdomain contacts.\n\nVSV P dimerizes through a domain (POD) that extends from residue 109 to residue 170 ( ; Data S1). We analyzed, by projection matching with the present structure (Data S2), images of the negatively stained L-P dimers described in much earlier work ( ) (Rahmeh et al., 2010). We found that the mean distance between residues 105 on the P chains of the two matched complexes (60 Å ) ( ) agreed well with that expected from the known structure of the dimerization domain (Ding et al., 2006), allowing for an extension of the short segment from 105 to 109 on each of the dimerized complexes ( ). The agreement validates the polarity of the P-chain trace and the assignment of residues in segment 3.\n\nIn segment 1, PTyr53 fits into a pocket on the outward-facing surface of the CTD. For a series of mutations at position 53, we found greatly decreased RNA synthesis in cells transfected with L, P, and N and infected with particles expressing a reporter template ( ). When incorporated into virions, the mutations resulted in no growth (Y53A and Y53D) or substantially attenuated growth (Y53F) ( ). They did not, however, affect in vitro transcription by L-P ( ). Anchoring of the P N terminus at the apex of the CTD ( ) thus contributes to RNA synthesis during viral infection but does not influence RNA polymerase activity directly. The most plausible interpretation of these results is that the defect is in replication, perhaps because of a failure to deliver N to the nascent RNA.\n\nThe interaction of rabies virus (RABV) P with RABV L is similar the VSV P-L interaction described here (Figure S4C), with contacts that anchor the CD, MT, and CTD and stabilize a closed conformation of L (Horwitz et al., 2019). The PL sequences for the two viruses have diverged substantially, however, and the specific molecular interactions differ. Recently determined structures of the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (Gilman et al., 2019) and human metapneumovirus (HMPV) (Pan et al., 2019) L-P complexes show that the tetrameric P proteins of those viruses contact only the RdRp and Cap domains of L (Figure S4C) and that those interactions do not fix the positions of the remaining domains.\n\nPriming, Initiation, and Elongation\n\nThe loop between residues 1152 and 1173 in the Cap domain projects into the catalytic cavity of the RdRp and appears to be a priming loop to support the nucleotide that initiates polymerization. As shown in , superposition of the catalytic residues of L on corresponding residues of the reovirus λ3 initiation complex (Tao et al., 2002) (Table S2) places the initiating nucleotide so that it stacks directly on a prominent tryptophan (LTrp1167) at the tip of the VSV L priming loop. Mutation of this tryptophan to alanine severely restricts the initiation at the end of the genome or antigenome; mutation to tyrosine or phenylalanine has a smaller effect (Ogino et al., 2019). Mutation of the homologous tryptophan in RABV L also compromises the end initiation, but it appears not to affect the internal initiation of transcripts, and it does not prevent capping (Ogino et al., 2019).\n\nFurther polymerization requires retraction of the priming loop or, potentially, displacement of the entire Cap domain. The HMPV (Pan et al., 2019) and RSV (Gilman et al., 2019) polymerase structures show a fully retracted priming loop with no substantial displacement of the rest of the Cap domain. The priming loops of those two enzymes and the catalytic cavities of their Cap domains are similar, and we can show by superposition that the VSV priming loop can also retract without any major rearrangements in the rest of the Cap domain ( ). Moreover, when we model the VSV L priming loop based on the HMPV L protein structure, we find that a twisting tunnel connects the RdRp catalytic site with an opening where the CTD, RdRp, and MT all meet ( ). We suggest that this tunnel might be the exit pathway for uncapped products (i.e., the full-length antigenome and genome during replication and the uncapped leader during transcription), which bypass the active sites of the Cap and MT domains.\n\nThe N-terminal segment of P (PNTD) binds a single subunit of N, forming the so-called N0-P complex. The likely function of this complex is to deliver N to the nascent genome and antigenome as they emerge from the polymerase. About 15 residues connect the N-binding element (residues 6–34) with the segment of P docked onto the outer face of the CTD. The N0 passenger could therefore lie close to the proposed exit site for uncapped products. A possible explanation for the defect in Y53 mutants is the release of the docked N-terminal region of P from its site on the CTD, causing inefficient delivery of N to the replication products. This defect would not affect transcription.\n\nAt the other end of the P polypeptide chain, a small C-terminal domain (PCTD) interacts with the RNP. The binding site is at the C-terminal lobe of the N proteins (Green and Luo, 2009). Together with a presumptive interaction of the RNP with L at the template entry site, the contact with P could facilitate the passage of the template strand through the enzyme. We have proposed previously that the subunits of N (probably three) that must separate from the RNA template as it threads through the polymerase do not dissociate from each other and instead rebind the RNA as polymerization proceeds. The N-N interaction creates a chain-like array, with an N-terminal arm and a C-proximal loop contacting the two neighboring subunits in the chain (Ge et al., 2010; Green et al., 2006). Interaction with the C terminus of L-bound P could then ensure the correct reassociation of this putative chain of N subunits with exiting RNA (see ).\n\nTranscription of all products except the uncapped leader requires a different sequence of events. One possibility is that the immediately upstream transcript leaves, and the priming loop snaps back into the position seen in our current structure. Internal initiation does not appear to depend on LTrp1167, however; one possibility is that the 3′ end of the departing transcript, still base paired with a few residues of the oligo-U tract at the 3′ end of the upstream gene, supports the initiating NTP instead. The interaction would need to account for the intergenic GA sequence on the template. Further polymerization would then displace the upstream transcript (Shuman, 1997).\n\nAcquisition of the guanylate cap occurs when the transcript length has reached at least 31 nucleotides (Tekes et al., 2011). If we suppose that the formation of the covalent intermediate with LHis1227 occurs before the addition of the 31st nucleotide to the transcript, then approximately 30 nucleotides of transcript would need to fit into the combined active-site cavities of the RdRp and Cap domain. The volume of the Cap active-site cavity, marked with an asterisk in , is 1.2 × 104 Å3. Assuming a volume occupied per Dalton (Da) of RNA (Vm) of 2.1 to 4.6 Å3 and an average mass of 340 Da per nucleotide (Speir and Johnson, 2012), the interior of the Cap domain could accommodate between 8 and 17 transcript nucleotides, in addition to the ~10 nucleotides still base paired with the template in the RdRp catalytic cavity. These relatively generous estimates suggest that the addition of the guanylate to the 5′ end of the transcript requires an opening of the multi-domain assembly from the closed conformation present in our structure. A plausible transition would be the release of the CD, MT, and CTD from their docked positions, as indeed occurs in the absence of P. If that transition also enabled a guanine nucleotide to access the RNA-protein covalent linkage, release of the capped 5′ end would allow it to diffuse efficiently into the MT active site, since both the transcript (still anchored to the RdRp at its growing, 3′ end) and the MT (linked to RdRp-Cap through the CD) cannot move far from each other.\n\nThe VSV L-P structure described here illustrates how the VSV P cofactor regulates L function by locking the domain organization into a single, pre-initiation configuration. It allows an explicit comparison with three other NNS viral L-P complexes shown in Figure S4C. In the VSV and RABV L-P complexes, an extended segment of P contacts several domains, thereby fixing the relative positions of the RdRp-Cap and CD-MT-CTD modules; the oligomerization domain of P does not participate in the contact with L. In the pneumovirus complexes, the oligomerization domain of P interacts directly with L, and the extended segment binds only the RdRp, allowing the three C-terminal domains to move freely about the linkers that connect them. A more complete analysis will require structures with RNP templates, such as transcribing intermediates, and studies of viral L proteins in complex with inhibitors.\n\nMETHOD DETAILS\n\nCryo-EM Structure Determination\n\nThe VSV L-P protein complex was prepared for structural analysis as previously described (Liang et al., 2015). Briefly, 3 μL of protein at ~0.35 mg/mL were applied to a C-flat grid (CF-1.2/1.3–4C, Protochips) that had been glow discharged at 40 mA for 30 s. Grids were plunge-frozen with an Vitrobot Mark II (FEI Company) after blotting for 3 s at 4°C and 85% relative humidity. 3307 movies of vitrified protein solution were collected using SerialEM (Mastronarde, 2005) on a Titan Krios electron microscope (ThermoFisher) at 300 kV and 59,000 nominal magnification, on a K2 Summit detector (Gatan, Inc.) operated in counting mode, resulting in a calibrated pixel size of 0.485 Å. Each movie contained 50 frames, collected in a 10 s exposure at 2 electrons/Å 2/frame. Most micrographs showed well-dispersed particles (Figure S1A). Movies were aligned and exposure-filtered using Unblur (Grant and Grigorieff, 2015). 3235 movies were selected for further processing based on the frame motion traces, excluding movies with traces suggesting large and zig-zag motion. The contrast transfer function (CTF) was determined using CTFFIND4 (Rohou and Grigorieff, 2015). CTF fringes on many micrographs were fitted to better than 3.0 Å resolution (Figure S1B). 188,004 particles were picked with IMAGIC (van Heel et al., 1996), command PICK_M_ALL. Particles were windowed into 400×400 pixel images and aligned using cisTEM (Grant et al., 2018) against the pixel size-adjusted 2015 map (EMD-6337) at an initial resolution of 8.0 Å, then refined at successively higher resolution, up to a resolution limit of 5.5 Å. Refinement was continued with 3D classification of two classes, at increasing resolution up to 4.0 Å, resulting in two reconstructions at 3.6 and 3.2 Å resolution (69,312 and 118,692 particles, respectively). Particles assigned to the 3.2-Å reconstruction were further refined at 4.0-Å resolution, and classified again into two classes with reconstructions at 3.8 and 3.1 Å resolution (34,713 and 83,979 particles, respectively). The goal of our classification was to obtain the highest possible resolution (globally). The discarded classes had poorer resolution throughout, not just in a particular domain. Further refinement of the best class at 4.0 Å resolution resulted in the final 3.0 Å reconstruction. The reconstruction was sharpened using cisTEM’s sharpening tool, amplifying signal at high resolution with a B factor-equivalent of 75 Å2.\n\nModel Building and Refinement\n\nWe used the program O (Jones et al., 1991) to adjust our previously determined VSV L protein structure (PDB-ID 5A22, determined at 3.8 Å resolution) (Liang et al., 2015) to fit the 3.0 Å resolution cryo-EM map. We modeled the P protein residues de novo. We refined coordinates and B factors with phenix.real_space_refine (version 1.16–3549) (Afonine et al., 2018). In addition to the standard chemical and grouped B factor restraints, we used secondary structure, rotamer, and Ramachandran restraints (weight = 1.0, nonbonded_weight = 500, rama_weight = 6.0). We used phenix.mtriage (Afonine, 2017) and MolProbity (Chen et al., 2010) to calculate the validation results shown in Figure S1C and Table S1. The final VSV L-P model comprises L protein residues 35–1211, 1217– 1332, 1339–1590, and 1596–2109; P protein residues 49–56, 82–89, and 94–105; and two zinc atoms. Improved model regions between updated (PDB-ID 6U1X) and original (PDB-ID 5A22) coordinates (Figures S2 and S3) are as follows. RdRp residues: 61– 64 (loop remodeled, sequence register shift of 60–64), 414–430 (sequence register shift of 414–430), 587–593 (loop remodeled, sequence register shift of 586–593). Cap residues: 958 (loop adjusted), 1035–1046 (sequence register shift of 1035–1046), 1072– 1075 (loop remodeled), 1100 (loop adjusted), 1122–1125 (loop remodeled, sequence register shift of 1124–1126), 1164–1170 (loop remodeled, sequence register shift of 1161–1170), 1195–1232 (sequence register shift of 1195–1227), 1262 (loop adjusted), 1314 (loop adjusted), 1321–1332 (region adjusted). CD residues: 1380–1395 (region remodeled, sequence register shift of 1379– 1396), 1498 (loop adjusted), 1535–1539 (loop remodeled, sequence register shift of 1535–1538). MT residues: 1718 (loop adjusted), 1806–1851 (sequence register shift of 1805–1841). CTD residues: 1952–1955 (loop remodeled, sequence register shift of 1950– 1955), 2006–2008 (shift in β hairpin tip), 2066 (loop remodeled), 2086–2094 (loop remodeled, sequence register shift of 2084– 2094), 2109 (Cα in main chain density instead side chain density of 2108).\n\nProjection Matching of Negative-Stain Class Averages\n\nWe extracted 20 negative-stain class averages of L-P dimers from a screenshot of a previously published figure (Figure S4C in Rahmeh et al. (2010)) using RELION-3 (Zivanov et al., 2018). From those dimer images we manually extracted 40 subparticles, one of each protomer, and masked them with a soft spherical mask. We obtained rotation angles for reference projections of our reconstruction with healpy (http://healpy.readthedocs.io ), the Python implementation of the HEALPix library of routines for equal area sampling of a sphere (Górski et al., 2005). Because the L-P complex has no symmetry and we did not allow mirroring of reference projections in the subsequent alignment step, we sampled angles on the entire sphere. We aligned the subparticle images to the reference projections with e2simmx.py from EMAN2 (Bell et al., 2016). Alignments were scored by calculating a cross-correlation coefficient (CCC). Because information in the negative-stain class averages is restricted to low resolution, reference projections from very different angles resulted in similar CCCs, and the “correct” solution was not always the top scoring projection. We therefore looked at the top five alignment peaks, which we located with the CCP4 program PEAKMAX (Winn et al., 2011), and then manually selected for further analysis the one whose reference projections most closely matched the particle image as judged by eye (Data S2). To calculate the distance between the P protein C termini of the two promoters, we transformed the model coordinates according to the determined alignment parameters. The analysis results for all class averages can be found in Data S2.\n\nFunctional Assays\n\nCells\n\nBSR-T7 cells (a kind gift from K. Conzelmann) (Buchholz et al., 1999) were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM; Corning Inc., 10–013-CV) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Tissue Culture Biologicals, TCB 101) at 37C and 5% CO2.\n\nPlasmids\n\nFor mammalian expression, plasmids expressing Y53 mutants were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the Q5 polymerase (New England Biolabs) on the parental P expressing plasmid (pMB-NS) (Pattnaik and Wertz, 1990) with dedicated primers (for Y53A: TAGGCCCTCTGCGTTTCAGGCAGC and GTATGCTCTTCCACTCCG, for Y53D: TAGGCCCTCTGATTTTCAGGC and GTATGCTCTTCCACTCCG, for Y53F: CATACTAGGCCCTCTTTTTTTCAGGCAGC and AGAGGGCCTAGTATGCTC, for deltaY53: TTTCAGGCAGCAGATGATTC and AGAGGGCCTAGTATGCTC). For bacterial expression and purification, fusion proteins made of a 6 histidine tag followed by the maltose-binding protein (MBP), the human rhinovirus type 14 (HRV) 3C protease cleavage site and the P protein, were cloned into a pET16b plasmid. The MBP tag was added to increase P solubility. A PCR product containing the 6xHis-MBP fragment was amplified from pET16b-MBP-MACV-Z (Kranzusch and Whelan, 2011) using AAGGAGATATACA TATGGCTCACCATCACCATCACC and CTGGAACAGTACTTCCAAACCAGAACCCTCGATCCCGAGGTTG, and one containing the HRV_3C-P fragment was amplified from pET16b-P (Rahmeh et al., 2012) using GAAGTACTGTTCCAGGGTCCTATGGATAATCT CACAAAAGTTC and GTTAGCAGCCGGATCCA. Both were inserted into pET16b-MBP-MACV-Z digested with NdeI and BamHI using the Infusion kit (Takara) to form pET16–6xHis-MBP-3Cc-P. Y53 mutations were introduced in pET16–6xHis-MBP-3Cc-P by site-directed mutagenesis with primers described above. To rescue viruses expressing P_Y53 mutants, Y53 mutations were introduced into pVSV1(+)-eGFP backbone (Whelan et al., 2000).\n\nProtein purification\n\nL and P proteins were purified as previously described (Rahmeh et al., 2012). MBP-P was purified from Rosetta cells (EMD Millipore) after induction with 0.3 mM IPTG overnight at 18°C. Cells were then pelleted and resuspended with 5 mL cold lysis buffer per gram of pellet (50 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 100 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, 5 mM imidazole, 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol and 1X protease inhibitor cocktail [cOmpleteTM, Roche Cat. # 4693116001]). After sonication, 40 mL cell lysate were clarified by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 20 min, and the supernatant was incubated with 2 mL of Ni-NTA beads (QIAGEN) overnight at 4°C. Beads were washed three times with lysis buffer (without protease inhibitor), and MBP-P proteins were eluted in 5 mL elution buffer (50 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 100 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, 5 mM imidazole and 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol). The eluate was concentrated with a centrifugal filter (Amicon) and passed through a Superdex S200 size exclusion chromatography column (GE Healthcare) in storage buffer (20 mM HEPES (pH7.4), 100 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol and 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol). MBP-P proteins eluted in a single peak and were kept at −80°C in storage buffer.\n\nVirus\n\nAttempts to rescue viruses expressing P_Y53 mutants, were performed as previously described (Whelan et al., 1995) using pVSV1(+)-eGFP-P_Y53x plasmids. VSV-eGFP-P_Y53F was the only mutant virus forming plaques. It was amplified and titered on BSR-T7 cells.\n\nN-RNA purification\n\nNucleocapsid template was purified essentially as described previously (Ongrádi et al., 1985). To limit background activity due to residual P bound to N-RNA, nucleocapsids were extracted from a recombinant VSV expressing a monomeric P protein whose oligomerization domain has been deleted (VSV-PΔOD). Briefly, 10 mg of gradient purified virions were disrupted on ice for 1 h in 10 mL of virion disruption buffer (VDB: 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.1% Triton X-100, 5% glycerol, 1 mM EDTA, 2 mM dithioerythritol and 600 mM NH4Cl). Lysed virions were centrifuged at 240,000 × g for 3.5 h through a glycerol step gradient of 0.25 mL each of 40, 45, and 50% glycerol in VDB. Pellets were resuspended overnight in 0.5 mL of 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA and 1 mM DTT, and disrupted again on ice for 1 h after mixing with 0.5 mL of 2X high salt VDB (1X HSVDB: 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.1% Triton X-100, 5% glycerol, 1 mM EDTA, 2 mM dithioerythritol and 1.5 M NH4Cl). Nucleocapsids were isolated by banding on a CsCl gradient. In a 5 mL tube, 1 mL of disrupted virions was added at the top of a step gradient of 2 mL of each 20 and 40% (wt/wt) CsCl in HSVDB. After centrifugation at 190,000 × g for 3 h, N-RNA were recovered by side puncture and diluted fivefold in NaCl-Tris-EDTA-DTT buffer (NTED: 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA and 2 mM DTT). N-RNA was then centrifuged through a 0.5 mL cushion of 50% glycerol in NTED buffer, resuspended overnight in NTE buffer and stored in aliquots at −80°C.\n\nProduction of minigenome particles\n\nProduction of transcription competent minigenome particles was as described previously with minor modifications (Pattnaik and Wertz, 1990; Wertz et al., 1994). BSR-T7 cells were plated in a 60mm dish and infected the next day with a vaccinia virus expressing T7 polymerase (vTF7–3) (Fuerst et al., 1986) at multiplicity of infection (MOI) 3 for 1 h in Dulbeco’s Phosphate Buffered Saline liquid (DPBS; Sigma Cat# 59300C). Cells were then transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 with plasmids expressing N (5.5 μg), P (1.6 μg), M (1.25 μg), G (2.5 μg), L (0.5 μg) and a minigenome containing an eGFP reporter gene (7.5 μg). Four hours later, the medium was replaced with 3 mL DMEM containing 2% FBS. The cell supernatant containing the DI particles (DI stock) was harvested 2 days after transfection.\n\nCell-based gene expression assay\n\nBSR-T7 cells were plated in a 96-well plate and infected the next day with a vaccinia virus expressing T7 polymerase (vTF7–3) at MOI 3 for 1 h in DPBS. Cells were then transfected with plasmids expressing N (91 ng), P (26 ng) and L (7.5 ng) using Lipofectamine 2000. Four hours later, cells in each well were infected with 3 μL DI stock in 30 μL DMEM for 1 h. Two days after transfection, GFP signal was measured using a Typhoon FLA 9500 scanner (GE Healthcare).\n\nIn vitro transcription assays\n\nRNA synthesis assay on naked RNA was described previously (Morin et al., 2012). Briefly, purified L (100 nM) was incubated with purified P or MBP-P (250 nM) and a 19nt-long RNA corresponding to the first nucleotides of the genomic promoter (1.4 μM). Reactions were performed in 10 μL at 30°C for 5 h in presence of radiolabeled GTP (32P-αGTP, PerkinElmer) and analyzed on a 20% polyacrylamide/7 M urea gel. The gel was exposed overnight to a phosphor screen (GE Healthcare), which was scanned on a Typhoon FLA 9500 scanner. The transcription assay on encapsidated template was carried out as described elsewhere (Li et al., 2008) by incubating 1 μg of purified L protein with or without 0.5 μg of P or 1.2 μg of MBP-P proteins and 5 μg of N-RNA purified from VSV-PΔOD virions. Reactions were performed in 100 μL in the presence of 1 mM ATP, 0.5 mM CTP, GTP, and UTP, 15 μCi of radiolabeled GTP (32P-αGTP, PerkinElmer), 30% vol/vol rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega), 0.05 μg/μL actinomycin D (Sigma) in transcription buffer (30 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 33 mM NH4HCl, 50 mM KCl, 4.5 mM Mg(OAC)2, 1 mM DTT, 0.2 mM spermidine and 0.05% Triton X-100) at 30°C for 5 h. RNA was extracted with Trizol reagent (Invitrogen Cat# 15596018) following manufacturer’s protocol, boiled at 100°C for 1 min, incubated on ice for 2 min, mixed with a 1.33 X loading buffer (33.3 mM citrate pH 3, 8 M urea, 20% sucrose and 0.001% bromophenol blue) and analyzed on a 25 mM citrate pH 3, 1.75% agarose, 6 M urea gel run for 18 h at 4°C and 180 V. Gels were fixed (in 30% methanol and 10% acetic acid), dried, and exposed overnight to a phosphor screen (GE Healthcare), which was scanned on a Typhoon FLA 9500 scanner.\n\nSuperposition of Atomic Models\n\nTo compare the VSV L-P structure to other viral polymerases, we used the program LSQMAN (Kleywegt and Jones, 1997) for superposition, except for the structure of the reovirus λ3 polymerase initiation complex, for which we also used the program O (Jones et al., 1991) to focus the alignment on the RdRp active site. Superposition statistics are summarized in Table S2.\n\nCavity Volume Calculation\n\nWe used the program VOIDOO (Kleywegt and Jones, 1994) to calculate the volume of the Cap active site cavity ( , marked by an asterisk). The radius of the probe sphere was 1.4 Å. The calculated volume corresponds to the probe-occupied volume. We closed off the cavity of interest at the constrictions leading to the RdRp and MT active sites cavities, respectively, with dummy atoms.\n\nFigure Preparation\n\nWe used MAFFT to calculate the amino acid multiple sequence alignments (Katoh et al., 2002). We prepared the figures with PyMol (The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, Version 2.1 Schrödinger, LLC), Pov-Ray (www.povray.org), matplotlib (Hunter, 2007), and ESPript (Robert and Gouet, 2014). Secondary structure elements were assigned using DSSP (Kabsch and Sander, 1983)."
