        "text": "Daniel Molloy was a rational guy, or at least as rational as anyone can be after learning that vampires are real, and becoming one himself. He approached vampirism the way he did all aspects of his life—with a healthy skepticism and a constant need for evidence. Well, all aspects of his life but one. While working on an article he was writing on his laptop, Daniel received a text message from his partially estranged daughter, Lenora. Since his book and publicity tour, she had been texting him more often—mostly out of concern. Somehow, with the help of his new permanent houseguest, Daniel had managed to mend a bit of his relationship with his daughters. The text included a picture of Daniel from the late ’90s standing next to Lenora’s mother, dressed in a gaudy Hawaiian shirt. It was sent along with the message ‘Do u still have this shirt & can I borrow it tonight?’\n\nDaniel and Lenora’s fashion tastes have somewhat merged over the years following her coming out as a lesbian. However, Lenora did not know that the particular shirt she asked to borrow held a sort of superstition for Daniel.\n\nYou see when Daniel first bought the shirt years ago, he wore it out drinking. But when he walked in, all confident in his bird-patterned shirt, some asshole at the bar elbowed him and said ‘nice shirt’ in a sarcastic tone. That soured his mood the whole night until a nice young lady tapped him on the shoulder and complimented his shirt. They hooked up that night, and from that point on, every time Daniel Molloy put on that Hawaiian shirt, he got laid. He knew that it was definitely a correlation and not a causation type of thing, but after he dubbed the shirt his ‘getting laid shirt,’ the reputation started to stick. Did he really think the shirt was imbued with some sort of aphrodisiac sex magic? No. But he wore it like a lucky number, and it hadn’t failed him yet.\n\nIt had been a while since Daniel last thought of his getting laid shirt; his latest divorce took a lot out of his ego. The subsequent relapses from the divorce were the last straw to finally get him into rehab. And although he may have slept with a couple of people in rehab, he really didn’t have the sex drive that he used to. Well, not until recently. Daniel glanced over at the slender figure slumped over on the sofa beside him, fastidiously typing on his iPad. Armand had been crashing at Daniel’s apartment for several months now. The two met up again at a book signing event in Buffalo. By then their reunion was long overdue, seeing as Armand went MIA on Daniel almost as soon as he turned him. After hours of arguing and apologizing, Daniel agreed to let his maker stay with him in New York. He was, after all, the catalyst for Armand’s alleged homelessness (the rich bastard owns properties all over the globe; he was just lonely). In their cohabitation, Armand and Daniel went about their respective days, dancing around the topic of Dubai, and the memories Daniel recovered upon receiving the Dark Gift. At least he had a year to reconcile with the fact that he and Armand used to be a thing in the ’70s and ‘80s before they started living together. There’s been an underlying sexual and/or romantic tension building between them that neither vampire has addressed. Despite this, Daniel quite enjoyed the quiet domesticity he was able to share with his maker these days. It certainly beat Armand ghosting him for months.\n\nHe ignored the text, instead returning to his work-in-progress article. There was only so much Daniel could care about the current state of the fantasy literature genre, and his editors would likely send him a strongly worded email if he spent the entire article shitting on ACOTAR. He deleted the sentence he just typed, and dragged his hands down his face with a dramatic sigh. He’d been cooped up in the living room of his apartment for days with no consistent sleep schedule, seeing as he insisted upon working normal hours to maintain appearances. His phone buzzed again with another text from Lenora, asking if he’d read her previous messages, and an idea formed in Daniel’s mind. He and Armand could certainly both use a break, which would give Daniel the perfect opportunity to potentially bridge the distance between them, and also test the luck of his getting laid shirt. Daniel messaged his daughter back with a text saying ‘NO. I’m wearing it tonight.’\n\n“I need a fucking break,” Daniel mumbled aloud, “You need a break, Armand?”\n\nThe ancient vampire looked up from his iPad. A couple of strands of his slightly unkempt hair fell into his face.\n\n“I wouldn’t be opposed to the idea,” he replied.\n\n“Good. I was thinking we should go out tonight. It’s been a hot minute since either one of us has left the apartment.”\n\nBut where to? Daniel wanted to get this right. He wanted Armand to stay with him this time—forever. Sure, Armand was a manipulative backstabbing maniac; the villain of Daniel's book. But after getting a taste of the vamp life himself, Daniel couldn't really hold any moral judgments against the guy. He knew firsthand what a guilty divorce felt like, and besides, all that psycho saw trap stuff Armand used to pull was a major turn-on for Daniel. Surely that's enough to justify the intense feelings he felt for his maker, both past and present. The butterflies Daniel got in his stomach at the thought of asking Armand out on their second first date.\n\n“Some fresh air would be nice. What did you have in mind?” Armand asked.\n\nDaniel closed his laptop shut, giving his full attention over to his maker.\n\n“Have you ever been to Chili’s, Armand?”\n\nFor context, after divorce #1, when Daniel started dating again he took all his first dates to Chili’s. There was a Chili’s about 15 minutes from his apartment, so he was never too far from his teenage daughters in case there happened to be an emergency while he was out. And besides, $5 for margaritas was a pretty good deal in New York. He had really come to admire the place for its southwestern charm and consistency in his life. The food was mediocre, about what you’d expect from a faux Mexican restaurant, and the espresso martinis left something to be desired, but Chili’s always made for a memorable experience. Since Daniel was planning to pull all his usual moves in courting Armand, he simply HAD to take him to Chili’s. That was the obvious correct choice.\n\nArmand furrowed his brow at the question, looking at his fledgling the way one might a peculiar insect.\n\n“No, I can’t say I have. What is the cuisine like there?” he asked, as though he’d be eating any of it. Knowing what a sadomasochist Armand could be, Daniel briefly considered that he might actually eat the food there.\n\n“Well obviously we wouldn’t be going there for the cuisine, although I imagine at least one customer will be rude enough to make for good eating,” he said, “But it’s like a mix of southern staples and Americanized takes on Mexican food. If I’m being honest the food was never my favorite, but the margaritas are to die for. I mean, it’s nothing fancy, but it’s a real staple of American culture, and at the very least makes for an entertaining date.”\n\nDaniel threw the word date out there; there was no going back now.\n\n“I see. So it’s not a place for the discerning palate, but more for the ambiance of it all. And you seem to be an expert on this establishment, I take it?”\n\nDaniel laughed at his maker’s antiquated language. In a way, he was an expert on Chili’s, despite not having been to the restaurant since 2015. Yeah…it’d been that long since Daniel Molloy went on a proper date.\n\n“You said it makes for an entertaining date. Are you asking me out on a date , Daniel?” Armand asked.\n\n“What if I am?”\n\nArmand’s lips furled into a smile.\n\n“Then I would say yes.” he responded, “And also, perhaps, that it’s about time.”\n\n“Well in that case,” Daniel said, standing up from the sofa, “I better go get dressed. I’ve got a hot date tonight.”\n\nHe shot finger guns at Armand before retreating to his bedroom to get ready. Once inside his room, Daniel made a B-line for his closet, where he fished out the infamous shirt. He paired the Hawaiian shirt with his nicest jeans and aviator sunglasses. He even combed his hair back (with gel) and spritzed on his best cologne for the occasion. If the luck of the shirt was going to work, he had to become the whole package. Daniel wanted to look as fuckable as his eternally 69-year-old self could possibly be!\n\nWhen he returned to the living room, he saw that Armand had also changed outfits. The vampire was far overdressed for the occasion, wearing a navy blue blazer with no shirt underneath and a pair of matching slacks that cut off at the ankles. Daniel was beyond the point of saying he just liked the company; Armand was devastatingly attractive all put-together like that. With his neatly trimmed chest hair peeking out from his blazer and his dark, kohl-lined eyes, the ancient vampire looked like a scene straight out of Daniel's wet dreams. Overdressed or not, Daniel didn’t dare ask him to change. If Armand was the only one serving cunt at Chili’s, then so be it!\n\n“Ready to go?” He asked, holding up his ring of keys.\n\n“Lead the way,” Armand replied, tilting his head to point toward the door.\n\n~~~\n\nThe car ride was short and mostly silent as neither man dared to speak over Freddie Mercury, whose music echoed throughout the car. They left just after sunset, hoping to beat the rush of traffic, but when they arrived at Chili’s, the jam-packed parking lot became a different kind of beast. After circling around the lot a couple of times, Daniel finally found a parking spot.\n\nThe devil and his minion approached the entrance of the building, side by side.\n\nDaniel pulled the door handle and held it open for his date. The Eagles’ hit song Hotel Califonia blared loudly over the speakers inside, drowning the vampires in the sound as soon as they walked in. The restaurant was crowded, and there was a line of people waiting to be seated.\n\n“Hi, Welcome to Chili’s!” said the restaurant host when they entered.\n\nDaniel grabbed his maker’s hand, pulling him through the tight squeeze of the crowd up to the desk.\n\n“Table for 2 please.”\n\nThe host, whose nametag read ‘Andrew,’ checked the table availabilities. Daniel noticed that the television screens around the bar seemed to be playing a football game or something—which would explain how packed it was there.\n\n“Looks like we have an opening! Right this way.”\n\nAndrew picked up two menus before leading the couple to their booth.\n\nTo Daniel’s surprise (and also horror), Chili’s had been remodeled since 2015. Gone was the teal linoleum tile and southwestern decor, replaced with sleek, minimalist furnishings. Daniel grimaced at the sight of the place. Its familiar charm was barely present anymore. Daniel was determined to make the most of this date regardless. He wasn’t wearing his getting laid shirt for nothing!\n\nArmand studied the menu—particularly the drinks section of it, seeing as that’s the only thing he could properly enjoy. At the end of the table sat a small tablet on a stand, the kind common at chain sit-down restaurants these days. Daniel caught his maker glimpsing over at it.\n\n“You can play games on that,” he stated, gesturing at the tablet.\n\nArmand’s eyes lit up at the suggestion. Contrary to what Armand’s age might suggest, the vampire loved all things relating to modern technology. When he wasn’t finalizing art deals or buying his meals with crypto, he spent much of his time on his iPad playing games. Minecraft was his favorite, of course, as it gave him complete and utter control over a world of his own. Daniel generally tried to ignore the implications of that.\n\nArmand slid the tablet across the table telekinetically so that it sat in front of him. That bastard was lucky that no one around was watching them. Daniel could always make up the excuse that his date was a stage magician, he supposed. When he looked over at Armand again he was inserting his credit card into the device.\n\n“It costs $1.99 to play the games,” Armand shrugged.\n\nHe paid it of course, because to Armand, $1.99 was a small price to pay for boundless entertainment.\n\nTheir waiter arrived at the booth shortly after; a short blonde woman who was no older than 20. She was all freckles and had on a visor with a football team logo embroidered on it.\n\n“Hey, my name is Baylee and I’ll be your server! So what brings you gentlemen here tonight? Are you here for the game?” she asked, laying down silverware beside each of their menus.\n\n“Just getting dinner together,” Daniel replied.\n\nArmand nodded, but his attention was clearly more focused on the knock-off Space Invaders game he was playing.\n\n“Aw okay,” their server, Baylee, remarked, “Is this your grandson you’re with?”\n\nNow that got Armand’s attention. He snorted loudly, gaze fixated on his fledgling who looked like a deer in headlights with COPD. Daniel fake-coughed to hide his flustered amusement.\n\n“No no we’re not related!” he stuttered out.\n\nAt the same time, Armand said something along the lines of “Absolutely not!”\n\nBaylee seemed a little confused but didn’t mention it.\n\n“Alrighty then! Can I start you boys off with something to drink?”\n\n“I’ll take the Tiki Beach Party Marg,” Daniel answered.\n\n“And for you, sir?” she asked Armand.\n\n“What exactly constitutes the frozen aspect of the frozen margarita?”\n\nIt took their server a moment to comprehend what Armand had asked her.\n\n“Oh well I mean the drink is a bit of silver tequila, orange liqueur, and whatever fruit juices work with the flavor you order. And it’s blended in with a lot of ice to make it frozen,” she replied.\n\n“In a blender?” Armand inquired.\n\nThat explained his previous question to Daniel. Armand had quite the fixation on blenders back in the ‘80s. They had to buy a new one almost weekly because Armand kept breaking them from excessive overuse.\n\n“I guess so, yeah.”\n\n“Perfect. I’ll have the mango frozen margarita then.”\n\nBaylee wrote down both of their orders on her notepad.\n\n“Okay! I’ll be right back with those drinks,” she said as she walked back to the bar.\n\nDaniel raised an eyebrow.\n\n“You into blenders again?” he asked.\n\nArmand fought back a smirk as he pretended to be absorbed in his game.\n\n“Not quite as much as I was then, but I’d rather enjoy watching them make the frozen margarita—if that’s plausible.”\n\n“Yeah, I’m sure it’s fine if you go to the bar and watch. I’ll stay here so they don’t give our booth to someone else.”\n\nArmand frowned a bit at the implication that he’d be going alone. It was a real possibility, however, given how packed the place was, that they would give their booth to other customers. He nodded at Daniel before he slid out of the booth, heading to the bar. Daniel observed his maker from his seat, watching as he conversed with the bartender. Armand clapped his hands together excitedly when the bartender whipped out the blender. It wasn’t his order they were mixing, but Armand was just happy to watch the blender in action. Daniel thoroughly loved how neurotic his maker was.\n\nNot wanting to annoy the bartender, Armand left after watching him make two frozen margaritas. He returned to the booth with a satisfied expression on his face.\n\n“Thank god you returned, I was getting lonely over here without you,” Daniel joked, prompting his maker to roll his eyes as he sat back down.\n\nArmand smiled—a real, genuine smile.\n\n“We can’t have that happening now, can we?” He chuckled.\n\nArmand reached across the table to hold Daniel’s hand. Such a simple gesture, and yet so potent.\n\n“So…what made you decide to ask me on a date tonight?” Armand asked.\n\n“Well, I’ve been meaning to for a while. But it was a text I got from my daughter that prompted me to ask you tonight.”\n\nArmand cocked his head to the side.\n\n“A text?” he asked.\n\n“Yeah, she asked if she could borrow this shirt I’m wearing,” Daniel replied.\n\n“And how does that correlate?”\n\nDaniel shook his head.\n\n“It’s a funny story actually, but this is my uh ‘getting laid shirt.’ It’s a stupid superstition I used to believe where if I wore the shirt I was guaranteed to get laid.”\n\n“Does it work?”\n\n“I guess we’ll have to find out,” Daniel said with a wink.\n\nIt was then that Baylee returned with their drinks. She set an alarmingly blue margarita down in front of Daniel. It had a singular cherry inside.\n\n“Here you go,” she said, as she gave Armand his frozen drink, “Are you two ready to order?”\n\nArmand shot him a look that said ‘Are you going to order food? ’\n\n“Yeah uh, we’ll just have a plate of nachos to share,” Daniel answered.\n\n“You sure you don’t want anything else?” Baylee asked.\n\n“Positive.”\n\nBaylee stared pointedly at the vampires’ hands, which were still intertwined, as she jotted their order down. Daniel felt a bit self-conscious; he had almost forgotten how he and Armand were externally perceived. To him, it was obvious that Armand was the older of the two, but to any onlookers, he probably appeared to be Daniel’s sugar baby. Daniel almost laughed at the thought, considering at one point the opposite was practically true. The server left without a word, leaving the couple to their own devices.\n\n“I’m honestly surprised that you’d ask me out at all, after everything,” Armand said, breaking the silence left by Baylee’s departure.\n\nDaniel winced as he said this, as though it physically hurt to hear it.\n\n“What?” he asked, incredulously, “Of course, I’d ask you out, Boss, I’m head over heels for you! I mean, sure, you messed up. A lot. Like several times repeatedly. But who hasn’t? Yeah, you’re a twisted, obsessive freak, but I fuckin’ love it. I was ecstatic when you asked to move in with me because I knew that living with you would be the most fun I’ve had in…years.”\n\n“Really? Even knowing what you do now about San Francisco?”\n\nHe nodded with a shit-eating grin plastered across his face.\n\n“Psychological torture is one of my turn-ons,” Daniel replied, taking a long sip of his margarita.\n\n“That gets you going, does it?” Armand teased.\n\n“Yeah but try and ask for consent next time, maybe we could get a safeword going or something if we do that again?”\n\nDaniel’s maker sneered at his comment. His eyes looked more bright of an orange when he was happy. Unlike Daniel, he didn’t bother wearing sunglasses out, considering the usual dark amber color of his eyes was close enough to brown that it never raised any red flags for mortals. Daniel’s color-changing kaleidoscope eyes could never. But seeing Armand all happy like that made Daniel’s undead heart skip a beat.\n\n“Of course,” Armand replied, attempting to conceal his amusement.\n\n~~~\n\nTwo margaritas later, Daniel and Armand found themselves back over at the bar, drunkenly cheering on some college kid who was doing shots. Everyone was crowded around the TV screens, watching the game. Well, everyone except for Armand, whose attention was divided between the blender and his fledgling vampire.\n\nThe song playing over the speakers changed to Bonnie Tyler’s Total Eclipse of the Heart. Daniel gasped aloud when he heard the first notes. This was their song. Daniel remembered the day he and Armand went to the record store and bought it on vinyl. He thought the story behind it—a human falling in love with a vampire—was so romantic, and quite fitting given his relationship at the time. They slowdanced to it in the bedroom of one of the various apartments Armand owned, this one being in Chicago. Daniel grabbed Armand by the shoulder, breaking him from his blender-watching trance.\n\n“Turn around,” Daniel sang along as his maker did just that.\n\nThe way Armand looked at him at that moment made him feel like he was back in 1983. His brows were arched ever so slightly and his lips curled into a seductive smile. He wrapped his arms around his fledgling’s waist as the other vampire continued to drunkenly sing.\n\n“Come on, Boss, sing along!” he pleads.\n\nArmand rolled his eyes but sang the next lyrics anyway.\n\n“Every now and then, I get a little bit nervous that the best of all the years have gone by.”\n\nAin’t that the truth. Half of the reason Daniel waited so long to make a move after they started living together was because he was afraid that Armand wouldn’t want him anymore. Before, he was young and spritely, with a lean body and a head full of dark curls. But now? Now he was forever wrinkled and grey. Why would someone like Armand—who had the looks and power to have anyone he wanted—choose him? Sure, they had a history together, but what good is history if you’re no longer attracted to that man?\n\nArmand tapped Daniel’s forehead with his pointer finger.\n\n“You’re thinking too hard,” he said, “I can feel it.”\n\nDaniel chuckled, swaying along to the tune of their song. Armand cupped his face with one hand, running a finger along the crease above his cheekbone. He pulled his fledgling close by the chin, kissing him for the first time that night. If Daniel had his doubts before, the sheer want and desire that dripped from Armand as they kissed was more than enough to dispel them. Armand’s hands crept away from where they rested on the other’s hips to cup his backside firmly, giving his asscheeks a teasing squeeze.\n\nUnfortunately, the vampires’ (far too dirty for Chili’s) kiss was interrupted by an inebriated college-aged man in a football jersey, who stumbled into them, drink in hand. Angry Orchard, by the smell of it, spilled out of his glass, soaking Daniel’s beloved getting laid shirt! And right at the climax of Bonnie Tyler’s greatest hit, too!? This boy had no idea how many women and men that shirt pulled! Even if it wasn’t actually lucky, the memories alone were enough to solidify the tacky Hawaiian shirt as a prized possession of Daniel’s. And now that his precious shirt was soiled, Daniel Molloy was furious.\n\nHe turned his head, placing his mouth to his maker’s ear.\n\n“Dinner,” Daniel whispered.\n\nArmand knew exactly what he was implying. The ancient vampire grabbed the boy by his jersey, glaring intensely into his eyes.\n\n“You will pay your tab and meet us outside of Chili’s,” he said, hypnotizing him.\n\nThe boy did as he was told.\n\nArmand signaled for their waiter to meet them at the booth, where their untouched plate of nachos sat. Baylee rang up their total on the tablet screen.\n\n“Do you want to pay with the card on file here? Says you used one to pay for some games earlier,” she asked.\n\nDaniel, who had started opening his wallet glanced at his date. Armand simply nodded.\n\n“Yes, use that card. I promise I don’t mind paying.”\n\nBaylee clicked buttons on the tablet before turning it towards Armand so that he could enter his email for the receipt. Before long, the vampires were outside, closing in on their prey.\n\nDaniel immediately punched the boy in the face, likely dislocating his jaw from the sheer force of it.\n\n“That’s for the shirt, asshole!” he said.\n\nStill hypnotized, the boy couldn’t fight back. Armand grabbed him by the arm, leading him to Daniel’s SUV. The vampires threw the boy in the back seat of the car and climbed in after him. Daniel went in for the kill, gripping him by the collarbone and sinking his fangs into the boy’s neck. It had been at least a week since he last ate, and Daniel was ravenous. Armand simply sat back and watched his messy eater of a fledgling.\n\nDaniel let go of his dinner’s neck for just a moment. His mouth was covered in blood, which dribbled down his chin as he turned to face Armand.\n\n“Want some?” he asked.\n\nArmand shook his head. “You go ahead, beloved, I don’t need to feed tonight.”\n\nDaniel stuck two of his fingers into the trail of blood leaking out of the boy’s neck, coating them.\n\n“Not even a taste?” he suggested, offering his fingers to Armand, who wasted no time taking them into his mouth.\n\nThe vampire couldn’t get enough as he sucked along Daniel’s fingers. It wasn’t the blood he wanted more of, it was Daniel. It was always Daniel. Daniel who pulled his spit-slick finger out from between his lips slowly and sensually before feeding on the boy again. Armand desperately wanted to taste him.\n\nDaniel finished draining his prey and pulled off of him with a defeated look on his bloodied face.\n\n“Damn, I really wanted to treat you to a dinner date,” he said, wiping the blood off his mouth with his forearm.\n\n“It’s alright,” Armand replied, “I’ll just have dessert then.”\n\nHe reached for the handle of the seat, laying it back until it was as horizontal as Daniel’s SUV allowed. Then, in one swift movement, Armand shucked Daniel’s jeans and underwear down to his ankles.\n\n“Off,” he said, imperatively.\n\nDaniel followed suit, kicking his shoes off as well as the rest of his pants. His pulse quickened, and he knew his maker could feel it too. He slid a hand underneath Armand’s blazer, placing his palm over the left side of his bare chest. Though the action was done to fondle his breast, Daniel felt his lover’s heart beat in time with his own; a side effect of the Maker’s Bond. The blood in his body began to travel southward.\n\n“Lay down on your stomach,” instructed Armand.\n\nDaniel’s dick twitched with interest.\n\nHe laid down on the seat like Armand told him to, ass on full display for his maker.\n\n“Good boy,” Armand praised.\n\nAnd oh , that was definitely doing something for Daniel. His dick was filling quickly, and the other vampire hadn’t even touched him yet. His shirt, still damp from earlier and now stained with blood, might just be lucky after all. Armand sunk his nails into the meat of Daniel’s thighs, separating them with a ferocity Daniel hadn’t encountered in quite a long time. His maker kneaded at his asscheeks before spreading them open.\n\nDaniel let out a moan that was certainly too loud for a Chili’s parking lot when Armand stuck his tongue inside him. Armand preened at the sound, which prompted him to thrust his tongue in deeper. He fucked him with his mouth as if he were mapping the inside of his fledgling’s asshole; probing everywhere and responding almost scientifically to the noises his lover made. With every action, a reaction, until Daniel squirmed against the faux leather seat of his car.\n\n“Please, Boss, touch me!” he cried out.\n\nArmand responded by slipping a hand underneath him, wrapping it tightly around Daniel’s cock. He stroked Daniel’s length in time with the thrusts of his tongue. Daniel bit into his arm to quiet himself. If vampires needed to breathe, the car would be foggy as all hell by now. Daniel still put a hand up against the back window, Titanic style. His devil worked him with a steady rhythm until he fell apart. He drew blood from how hard he bit into his arm when he came in Armand’s fist. His legs trembled with his release, bloody cum spurting all over the seat and his stomach. Armand crawled off of him, giving his lover space to sit back up.\n\n“I think my shirt is ruined,” he said, jokingly.\n\nArmand laughed.\n\n“It worked, though!” he said.\n\nHe was right, the shirt did get Daniel laid. Did rimming count as getting laid? Daniel certainly thought so, given how spent he was from it. It was moments like these that made Daniel glad he was a vampire. He had the stamina now to keep going all night if Armand desired it. A few years ago he struggled just to get it up. Now he could come violently from getting his ass eaten in his SUV with the only question on his mind being ‘what next?’\n\n“I’d like to bend you over the dining room table when we get back to our apartment,” Armand said, nonchalantly as Daniel got re-dressed.\n\nDaniel did not ignore that Armand used the word ‘our’ when referring to the apartment.\n\n“We’re not fucking in our dining room,” Daniel stated.\n\nArmand shrugged as he climbed into the passenger seat of the SUV. The vampires left the body of the boy in the back of the car; they’d dispose of him after they got home.\n\n“But Daniel,” he said, flashing his lover his saddest, wettest eyes, “We’re not dining .”"
