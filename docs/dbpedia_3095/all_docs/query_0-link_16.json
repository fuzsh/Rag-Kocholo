        "text": "FALLING IN REVERSE makes anthems that provoke and inspire. Unnervingly ahead of the pack and yet always decisively right on time, their mix of bombastic declarations and intimate confessions connect with diverse crowds worldwide.\n\nPopular Monster, is their first full-length album in over seven years; an eleven song masterpiece, featuring five tracks that are bonafide smash hits, (three certified gold and one certified 2x platinum). Not ones to rest on their laurels, the six new tracks are incredible, and feature unexpected collaborations with some of the music industry hottest hitters.\n\nWith hit songs like Popular Monster topping the rock radio charts and earning them their first 2x platinum single, the bands momentum only grows stronger, and their live performances are big reason why. From playing top festivals, to arena opening stints for Avenged Sevenfold, and Disturbed, to co-headlining with legends like Papa Roach, and now selling out headline shows in arenas across the country!\n\nThis album package will include a 24-page, 4 color booklet with lyrics and imagery from their YouTube Trending music videos, sized for the formats CD and LP.\n\nLP - features LIMITED EDITION BLACK & WHITE SWIRL + album download code with 3 never-before-released bonus tracks REMIXED AND REMASTERED from 192kHz/36-bit transfers of the original multi-track tapes. Includes a 4-COLOR BOOKLET with liner notes from Alison Brown, Dave Dennison, and Mike Marshall, plus ARCHIVAL PHOTOS and SESSION DOCUMENTS. Unavailable on all formats since the early 2000s, Alison Brown's Grammy-nominated debut album Simple Pleasures was a leap forward for Scruggs-rooted banjo playing when it was first released in 1990. This led to her immediate recognition as a banjo pioneer and to her win in 1991 of the Banjo Player of the Year award from the International Bluegrass Music Association (the first female to win an Instrumentalist of the Year award).\n\nThe album was produced in 1989 by acoustic music icon and frequent Jerry Garcia cohort David Grisman (architect of \"Dawg Music,\" the jazz-influenced breakout fringe of the bluegrass genre) and recorded with a cast of all-star musicians at Dawg Studio in Marin, CA. Players on the sessions included Alison Krauss (fiddle), David Grisman (mandolin), Mike Marshall (guitar, fiddle, mandolin), Matt Eakle (flute), Joe Craven (percussion) and Jim Kerwin (bass). The album's 12 tunes were all written by Alison and include the first recorded versions of some of her most well-known compositions, including \"Mambo Banjo,\" \"Leaving Cottondale,\" and \"Weetabix.\" For the 2024 reissue, the original 8-track, 1\" multitrack tapes were transferred at a resolution of 192kHz/36-bit, and remixed and mastered by Matt Coles at Compass Sound Studio in Nashville. Simple Pleasures will be released on LP, CD, and all digital platforms and features liner notes from Mike Marshall, recording engineer Dave Dennison, and Alison. The CD and DL versions include 3 bonus tracks of never-before-released demos recorded at Fantasy Studios in Berkeley, CA, in 1988, produced by Richard Greene and featuring David Grisman (mandolin), Mike Marshall (guitar), Todd Phillips (bass), and Greene (fiddle). Originally released on Vanguard Records in 1990, Simple Pleasures earned extensive critical praise both for Alison's compositions as well as her instrumental prowess and received a Grammy nomination for Best Bluegrass Album. In his liner notes for the reissue, Mike Marshall wrote: \"It is SO fun to revisit this first album of Alison's and to remember how she put her own stamp on the acoustic music scene back in the early 90s both as a composer and monster instrumentalist. It was refreshing and very much needed to have a woman showing us guys what was what and, in the process, paving the way for the next generation of virtuoso female bluegrass pickers.\" One of the most multi-faceted minds in roots music, Alison Brown is a GRAMMY-winning musician, GRAMMY-nominated producer, and co-founder of Compass Records Group. She is the recipient of the USA Artists Fellowship in Music and the Distinguished Achievement Award from the International Bluegrass Music Association. A pioneer among women in the music industry, Alison was the first female to win an Instrumentalist of the Year award from the International Bluegrass Music Association; in 2019, she became the first female 5-string banjoist to be inducted into the American Banjo Museum's Hall of Fame.

This album is one of my more personal records to date. It's not a full biography, but my personal experiences are tied up in all of my music. A lot of the records are me. Some are from the POV of a character. and some are me. The album weaves things from my life as an artist, touching on things other artists go through. The narrative follows a battle rapper through various moments in his career, starting with how they honed their battle rap skills, following their career through different moments.\n\nMusically, the new album finds Lupe delighting in the simple pleasures of assembling assonant syllables into playful and poignant narratives. The 8-track album is smooth, yet cerebral, brimming with ideas, but always radiating Lupes pure love for the art of emceeing and committing himself as a servant of the rap game. The album was produced in full by longtime collaborator and friend, Soundtrakk (Superstar, Kick, Push, HipHop Saved My Life), their second time linking up on a full album after 2022s DRILL MUSIC IN ZION, and is also the first time Lupe, Trakk, and longtime manager Charles Chill Patton were in the studio together since Pattons release from prison in 2023. It felt great to be back in the studio again as a family, Lupe says. Its the first time theyd worked together in the studio since Lupes seminal album, The Cool in 2005.\n\nThe word samurai means to serve, Lupe says on the albums title. My relationship to that word has always meant that you need to be at the service of other people, either in the overall community, or in this instance, the rap community at large that Ive been a part of for years. You have some duty, some purpose to serve. The title alone is very important to me. Before rap even, martial arts was my whole life, and it still plays a huge role in my life. The album is me, but also inspired by a quote I heard from one of my favorite artists. The overall themes of the album speak to the constant fight and the battle one goes through being in the entertainment industry. Some of the things we need to defend.\n\nFor over 20 years, The Decemberists have been one of the most original, daring, and thrilling American rock bands. Their distinctive brand of hyperliterate folk-rock set them apart from the start, releasing nine full-length albums that are unbound by genre and highly ambitious. Now the beloved indie band is back with their first new album in six years, As It Ever Was, So It Will Be Again - not only the longest Decemberists album to date (and their first intentional, proper double-LP) but also their most empathetic and accessible, its 13 songs like semaphores of mutual recognition for our fraught times and faint hope. The first dozen songs are punchy, pithy gems all, reflections on mortality and loneliness, longing and cynicism, expectation and unease. The band animates them brilliantly, pushing out and pulling in at the perfect moments. John Moen practically dances beneath the jangle of opener Burial Ground, breathing the life into this song about spiraling toward the end. From the irrepressible Oh No!\" and guileless tenderness and absolute surrender of All I Want Is You, to the romantic ghost story that shimmers behind pedal steel in spite of the specter in \"Long White Veil,\" these 12 songs alone would constitute a dazzling Decemberists album, rich with woe and love, anxiety and honesty. But a keening little choir and arid electric guitar invoke Joan in the Garden, the bands first full-on prog escapade since The Crane Wife. Though rooted in doubt, much like the album it ends, Joan in the Garden ultimately lands as a celebration of musics ability to convey valence and ambiguity, to frame an endlessly complicated story in instantly compelling terms.\n\nThis, songwriter Colin Meloy will tell you proudly, is the best Decemberists albums and perhaps the ultimate realization of 22 years of work. In many ways, As It Ever Was, So It Will Be Again feels like an aptly titled renewal for The Decemberists. The first full-length release on YABB Records, the bands own label, after a run of nearly two decades with Capitol. As they were once, here are the Decemberists again, now an independent band empowered by singing stories that sound instantly familiar and convey some bit of hard-won wisdom.\n\nTHE GHOST INSIDE stands as an unstoppable force in the realm of hard rock music. Fueled by unwavering determination and unyielding passion, this band has forged a path marked by resilience and redemption. Their latest endeavor, the 6th studio album titled Search for Solace, delves into the profound theme of grappling with ones own thoughts  the internal struggle between good, bad, and evil. It explores the journey of finding comfort and making peace amidst the chaos of lifes ebb and flow. The album reflects the bands commitment to not succumb to negativity, anger, or darkness, aligning with their identity as an uplifting and comforting musical force for fans seeking solace.\n\nEstablished in 2004, THE GHOST INSIDE has solidified its position as a trailblazer in melodic hard rock. Their music seamlessly combines raw aggression with profound lyricism, creating a resonant experience for their dedicated fanbase. Despite facing challenges, notably a tragic bus accident in 2015 that left some members with life-altering injuries, the band refused to be broken. Through unwavering perseverance, they made a triumphant return to the stage, defying the odds. Their music embodies a spirit of resilience, unity, and the indomitable power of the human spirit.\n\nEach thunderous breakdown and soaring melody strikes a deep chord within the hearts of their fans, serving as a testament to the bands enduring impact. THE GHOST INSIDEs journey is a testament to their ability to inspire and uplift through music. As they embark on a global tour starting this Spring, venturing into new territories, including South America and beyond, the band continues to share their message of strength and perseverance with audiences around the world."
