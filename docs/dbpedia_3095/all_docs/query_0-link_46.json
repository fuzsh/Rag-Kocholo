        "text": "The weather at the Jersey Shore - and in New Jersey overall - was NASTY this past weekend.\n\nIt was basically downpouring nonstop, winds were atrocious and peaked at 40 miles per hour and basically, anytime I tried to step outside I started to melt.\n\nBut I am telling you something you already knew, aren't I?\n\nWell after Mother Nature decided to calm the freak down, I decided to walk up to the beach in Lavallette with my dog, Carolina to see what it was like.\n\nWhat did I find? Holy cow...\n\nThe power of Mother Nature is no joke and honestly, it was a whole new world up there.\n\nI find it fascinating that even hours after a storm is technically over, it doesn't necessarily look or feel that way up on the beach by any means.\n\nI've seen storm aftermath before but man, was this ocean ANGRY! (I wonder what pissed Mother Nature off so bad?)\n\nCarolina and I ventured over the sand dunes and down to the beach to take photos and video of some of the most intense waves I have ever seen! The sand was also covered in I don't even know what!\n\nCare to take a look at Mother Nature in her angry, annoyed prime?\n\nLet's take a look at some photos first. Then I'll show you some footage of some of the roughest, most intense waves I've ever seen.\n\nLet's take a look:\n\nWild, right?\n\nNow for some video.\n\nI do believe the last one is my favorite because Mother Nature made me shriek an octave higher than I'm used to.\n\nLet's check it out:"
