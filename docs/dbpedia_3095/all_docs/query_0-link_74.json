        "text": "Originally Posted by dcmc79\n\nHello. I will begin working at the University Hospital in Newark and am trying to find a place to live. I was looking at the Harrison neighborhood. Is that a safe place to live, considering it's right next to Newark? I drove through it and it seems pretty desolate, especially at night when I was driving past the train station. Is it safe for a family and is it ok to walk around at night? Thank you.\n\nOriginally Posted by twista6002\n\nThe central ward in Newark is terrible once you go west of Bergen St or south of Market St.\n\nTo answer the question about Harrison, it's not a bad area but not a great area. It doesn't have the thugs and ghettos like Newark but it doesn't have the instant response police and tight knit family community type feel an area like Livingston would have. It'd be a good place if you're single and know it's temporary but I wouldn't recomend it if you plan on raising a family and living there the rest of your life."
