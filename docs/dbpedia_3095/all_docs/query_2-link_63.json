This includes elevators to all levels, exterior ramps for wheelchair access, Braille signage in elevators and meeting rooms, and accessible restrooms with appropriate fixtures.\n\nHead-sets are available through the A/V provider for those that are hearing impaired. In addition, the Center parking lots have specially marked and reserved parking spaces for disabled patrons.

For more details please contact (609) 449-2480.\n\nThe Atlantic City Convention Center exhibit halls are divisible into five (5) separate exhibit spaces. The division of these halls is performed by manually closing the air walls to segregate the spaces. This is a complimentary service provided that the work is done during normal business hours. However, should Show Management or a Contractor request movement of the air wall(s), there will be a charge for that service to call in labor. Please contact your Event Manager for specific instructions and details. Reminder, no items may be placed within 5’ of an air wall by an exhibitor or service contractor due to fire marshal policy.\n\nAll event-based shuttle buses will load and unload in front of the venue just along the inside curb. Each entry door is numbered to ensure your guests know which door their specific shuttle is assigned. Please arrange pick-up and drop-off locations with your Event Manager. Overnight bus/motor coach parking is also available.\n\nPurchase an overnight parking pass for your bus/motor coach.\n\nAtlantic City Convention Center’s answer to your business needs while you are away from home is our Business Center, conveniently located in our ground-level lobby. The regular business hours will coincide with most tradeshows and conventions. The store can be open after normal hours to accommodate convention/show needs if arranged ahead of time. In addition to handling packing and shipping for customers, The Business Center is a fully equipped copy center, with the ability to produce anything from black and white copies to full-color presentations while the customer waits. Signage and business cards are also available to help promote your booth and your business. Other services available at The Business Center are faxing, Internet access, copier, and fax machine rentals, office products and supplies, stamps, parcel receiving, binding, laminating, notary services, and scooter rental. The store also has a graphic artist on staff to meet your design needs. The Business Center has the exclusive right to provide these services to conventioneers within the building.\n\nIn an effort to provide the exhibitor with a “user-friendly” atmosphere, the Center has set up a program for POV’s. The vehicles owned by the exhibitor may be as large as a panel van. The exhibitor may park on the loading dock in a designated area, provided by the show contractor. They may carry their freight to and from their booth within a limited time allotment. Unauthorized vehicles parked on the loading dock or in a fire lane will be towed at the owner’s expense. The exhibitors also have the opportunity to park and carry their material from our parking garage provided they use equipment no larger than a two-wheel handcart.\n\nConcessions are available exclusively through OVG Hospitality and may be open during show hours. Concessions also have available move-in and move-out specials that can be pre-ordered and delivered to exhibitor booths. Menus can be customized to meet your event demographics.

Center permanent signs, banners, etc. may not be blocked in any manner. Temporary signs may not be attached in any manner to permanent Center signage. Please see the assigned Event Manager to review where items may be affixed or signs hung.\n\nDecorators are considered contractors and must have the proper identification displayed at all times when in the venue. Decorators arrive at a clean ready space and are expected to return the space in the same clean condition. It is critical all equipment and empty containers are stored in the appropriate areas or placed back on the trucks. An Operations team member will meet with the decorator foreman assigned a show on arrival to review all expectations.\n\nAll events anticipating 1,000 or more people or at the building’s discretion will necessitate EMT services to be paid as a show expense. Your Event Manager will secure Emergency Medical Technicians (EMTs) and discuss minimum staffing and hours of service for the EMTs. Depending on the nature of the event, EMT services may be required during move-in and move-out hours.\n\nShow Management is required to provide an enclosed space for the EMT either on the show floor or an easily accessible meeting room. The communication to the EMT will be through the center’s Public Safety Department.\n\nIn the event of an alarm, all attendees, exhibitors, and staff will be required to exit the building. The Event Manager will contact the Show Manager directly when the alarm is cleared and everyone can re-enter the venue at that time. Venue staff will be on hand at all times to assist with exiting and advising when it is clear to re-enter.\n\nFollowing the execution of the license agreement for your event, the center will assign an Event Manager to work with you on event planning and implementation. The Event Manager will contact you as soon as assigned and will remain your primary Convention Center liaison through the conclusion of your event.\n\nThe major function of the Event Manager is to gather all event information and disseminate that information to all building operating departments. Your Event Manager will put you in contact with our exclusive service contractors below. Please communicate regularly with your Event Manager during the planning process to ensure the successful production of your event.\n\nOVG Hospitality is the exclusive Food and Beverage provider for all Catered Events and Concession sales. Our Food and Beverage Department is prepared to offer the finest quality products and services for all functions, from a Continental Breakfast to a Black Tie Dinner Gala. Themed events can be planned and presented that are guaranteed to meet your budget and delight your guests. OVG Hospitality also has the capability to offer special dietary menus. Please have your Event Manager introduce you to a Food & Beverage Representative early in your planning process. Our Catering Sales Manager and Executive Chef are poised to assist you in making your event spectacular.\n\nThe practice of exhibitors bringing in their own food or beverage is in direct conflict with the OVG Hospitality exclusive contract at the Atlantic City Convention Center. Therefore, it is our policy that any exhibitor who is providing ANY food or non-alcoholic beverage item will be required to notify OVG Hospitality in advance as to the nature of the proposed product giveaway (fees are applicable unless waived by OVG Hospitality or purchased through OVG Hospitality).\n\nSampling of food or non-alcoholic beverage items would not be permitted if the item being dispensed has no relation to such exhibitor’s business.\n\nOVG Hospitality requires all food and non-alcoholic beverages to be of sample size portions; 2-ounce portions for food and 4-ounce cups for non-alcoholic beverages. Written approval must then be obtained from OVG Hospitality at least (7) seven working days prior to the show opening.\n\nIf your sample requires you to cook on the show floor the following are approved cooking apparatus: George Foreman Grills, Panini Grills, Induction Cookers, Butane Stoves, Toaster Ovens, Sauté Pans (not using grease or oils), Pressure Cookers, Deep Fryers with built-in suppression Systems and NJ State Fire Inspector Approval. Not approved are Electric Grills or any items creating “Grease Laden Vapors”. All booths cooking food must be clear of all combustible materials and contain at least 1 (one) 20 BC rated fire extinguisher. Open flame units will require a fire permit. See your Event Manager for additional details.\n\nAny Exhibitor requesting to give away samples of alcoholic beverages must obtain a special event liquor license from the Liquor Control Board for the State of New Jersey (fees are applicable unless waived by OVG Hospitality or purchased through OVG Hospitality). Samples dispensed are limited to those products that are manufactured, processed, or distributed by the entity requesting permission. Please refer to the Exhibitors Agreement for further specifications. You must also hire an OVG Hospitality union bartender to serve any alcoholic beverages. Bartender fees will apply. Samples are limited to 1 ounce of beer or wine and 1/2 ounce of spirituous liquors. Alcoholic Samples are to only be served to persons 21 years of age or older. Each booth must provide a visible sign, stating: “Guests must be 21 years of age to participate in sampling of alcoholic beverages. Picture I.D is required”\n\nInsurance Requirements: General Certificate Liability will be required; contact the Director of Catering for details. Any exhibitor providing samples of food and non-alcoholic beverage must operate within the local Health Department Guidelines.\n\nThe Center cannot accept advance freight deliveries. Due to limited storage space, all freight, including packages, mail, etc., must be shipped to your service contractor/decorator and delivered to the Center during the designated move-in period. Any freight scheduled for delivery to the Center during move-in periods should be to the attention of your service contractor/decorator. The Center will not accept C.O.D. shipments under any circumstances nor will the Center accept responsibility for costs associated with freight delivery/pick-up during non-assigned periods. The Center will not be liable for the security of freight left in the facility, nor can we assume responsibility for the shipping of such freight.\n\nFreight left on the floor will be considered “forced freight” and will be handled through the show decorator. Shows not using a service contractor/decorator should make arrangements with the Business Center. They will be able to accept small freight (up to 150lbs), schedule out bound deliveries, and work with Show Management and/or Exhibitors to ensure the freight is available for pick-up. The building is not responsible for freight left behind. Please contact the Business Center at (609) 449-2480 for any associated costs.\n\nHeating and air conditioning are provided only during open show hours on the exhibit floor and during seminar hours in meeting rooms. They are not included during move-in and move-out hours on the exhibit floor due to freight doors being open at that time. If heating/ air conditioning is required in meeting rooms and/or exhibit halls other than scheduled event hours, your Event Manager can review the potential costs at your convenience.\n\nAll show personnel are required to wear visible identification badges at all times. Show Contractors must ensure their employees and management staff are identified from the first day of move-in until the last day of move-out. Exhibitors must also wear ID badges prior to entering the exhibit hall. Show Management must supply a sample set of ID badges to the Event Manager along with a detailed description of any restrictions associated with them at least five (5) days in advance of the first day of the move-in.\n\nThe Atlantic City Convention Center has the capability of providing show managers with their own set of keys for specific meeting rooms and other offices. For a fee, the locks may be changed to provide you with sole access to each room. There is no deposit required; however, you may be invoiced for each key not returned at the conclusion of your event.\n\nIf you require the use of the loading docks for move-in and move-out, Security will be assigned by the Center and these Public Safety Officers will enforce parking rules and traffic control. The Center staff will retain complete control over all loading dock areas and will make every effort to maintain a safe and effective loading dock operation. Please supply your Event Manager with all information regarding your move-in/move-out activities to facilitate the smooth operation of your event.
