        "text": "City in Cumberland County, New Jersey, US\n\nFor other uses, see Vineland (disambiguation).\n\nCity in New Jersey\n\nVineland is a city and the most populous municipality in Cumberland County, within the U.S. state of New Jersey. Bridgeton and Vineland are the two principal cities of the Vineland-Bridgeton metropolitan statistical area, which encompasses those cities and all of Cumberland County for statistical purposes and which constitutes a part of the Delaware Valley (the Philadelphia metropolitan area).[22] The MSA had a population of 156,898 as of the 2010 census.[23] As of the 2020 United States census, the city's population was 60,780,[11][12] its highest decennial count ever and an increase of 56 (+0.1%) from the 60,724 recorded at the 2010 census,[24][25] which in turn reflected an increase of 4,453 (+7.9%) from the 56,271 counted in the 2000 census.[26] The Census Bureau's Population Estimates Program calculated that the city's population was 60,491 in 2022,[11] ranking the city the 639th-most-populous in the country.[13]\n\nVineland was formed on July 1, 1952, through the merger of Landis Township and Vineland Borough, based on the results of a referendum held on February 5, 1952.[3][27][28] Festivities on July 1, 1952, when the merger took effect, included a parade and speeches from such notables as Senator Estes Kefauver.[29] The name is derived from the plans of its founder to use the land to grow grapes.[30][31]\n\nGeographically, the city is part of South Jersey. It has large Italian-American[32] and Hispanic-American populations.[33]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nCharles K. Landis purchased 30,000 acres (47 sq mi) of land in 1861 and another 23,000 acres (36 sq mi) in 1874, near Millville, and along the West Jersey railroad line with service between Camden and Cape May, to create his own alcohol-free utopian society based on agriculture and progressive thinking. The first houses were built in 1862, and train service was established to Philadelphia and New York City, with the population reaching 5,500 by 1865 and 11,000 by 1875.[34][35]\n\nVineland was an early temperance town, where the sale of alcohol was prohibited. Landis required that buyers of land in Vineland build a house on the purchased property within a year of acquisition, that 2+1⁄2 acres (10,000 m2) of the often heavily wooded land be cleared and farmed each year, and that adequate space be placed between houses and roads to allow for planting of flowers and shade trees along the routes through town. Landis Avenue was constructed as a 100-foot (30 m) wide and about 1-mile (2 km) long road running east–west through the center of the community, with other, narrower roads connecting at right angles to each other.[36]\n\nAfter determining that the Vineland soil was well-suited for growing grapes (hence the name), Landis started advertising to attract Italian grape growers to Vineland, offering 20 acres (81,000 m2) of land that had to be cleared and used to grow grapes. Thomas Bramwell Welch founded Welch's Grape Juice, and purchased the locally grown grapes to make \"unfermented wine\" (i.e. grape juice).[36] The sandy ground also attracted the glass-making industry and was home to the Progresso soup company. Throughout the first half of the 20th century, most of the city was involved in the poultry industry, which led to the city being dubbed \"The Egg Basket of America.\"[37]\n\nVineland Poultry Laboratories was started by Arthur Goldhaft. Goldhaft is credited with putting \"a chicken in every pot\" after developing the fowl pox chicken vaccine that saved millions of chickens from death. Goldhaft's work at Vineland Poultry Laboratories in Vineland helped protect the world's chicken supply from the fowl pox disease. Operations at the facility were closed by Lohmann Animal Health in 2007.[38]\n\nVineland had New Jersey's first school for the intellectually disabled, the Vineland Developmental Center, which now has an east and west campus. These institutions housed mentally handicapped women in fully staffed cottages. Henry H. Goddard, an American psychologist, coined the term \"Moron\" while directing the Research Laboratory at the Training School for Backward and Feeble-minded Children in Vineland. This facility was so sufficiently well known that one American Prison Association pamphlet in 1955 heralded Vineland as \"famous for its contributions to our knowledge of the feebleminded\".[39]\n\nVineland celebrated its 150th birthday in 2011. Mayor Robert Romano initially ordered a custom cake from Buddy Valastro of Carlo's Bake Shop in Hoboken; the business is featured in the TLC reality television series Cake Boss. After outcry from local business owners, the order was canceled and five Vineland bakeries donated elaborate cakes for the event as well as over 1,000 servings of cake for the celebration.[40]\n\nSince the 1970s, the city has had an annual dandelion festival. Brought to the area by early Italian immigrants, the plant is grown as a crop by farms in Vineland.[41]\n\nBarbara Kingsolver's 2018 novel Unsheltered is set in Vineland.[42]\n\nGeography\n\n[edit]\n\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the city had a total area of 68.99 square miles (178.68 km2), including 68.39 square miles (177.14 km2) of land and 0.60 square miles (1.54 km2) of water (0.86%).[1][2] Of all the municipalities in New Jersey to hold the type of City, Vineland is the largest in total area. (Hamilton Township in Atlantic County is the largest municipality in New Jersey in terms of land area. Galloway Township, also in Atlantic County, is the largest municipality in total area, including open water within its borders.)[43]\n\nUnincorporated communities, localities and place names located partially or completely within the city include Clayville, Hances Bridge, Leamings Mill, Menantico, North Vineland, Parvins Branch, South Vineland, Willow Grove and Pleasantville.[44] That last community (adjacent to Newfield Boro) is not to be confused with the City of Pleasantville in Atlantic County.\n\nVineland borders the municipalities of Deerfield Township, Millville and Maurice River Township in Cumberland County; Buena and Buena Vista Township in Atlantic County; Franklin Township and Newfield Boro in Gloucester County; and Pittsgrove Township in Salem County.[45][46][47] The city is approximately 38 miles (61 km) from the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nDemographics\n\n[edit]\n\nHistorical population CensusPop.Note%± 18707,077—18806,005−15.1%18907,67727.8%19009,09118.4%191011,71728.9%192016,83443.7%193021,60328.3%194024,43913.1%195029,57321.0%196037,68527.4%197047,39925.8%198053,75313.4%199054,7801.9%200056,2712.7%201060,7247.9%202060,7800.1%2023 (est.)60,797[11][13][14]0.0%\n\n2010 census\n\n[edit]\n\nThe 2010 United States census counted 60,724 people, 21,450 households, and 15,230 families in the city. The population density was 887.5 per square mile (342.7/km2). There were 22,661 housing units at an average density of 331.2 per square mile (127.9/km2).

For every 100 females ages 18 and older there were 88.1 males.[24]\n\nThe Census Bureau's 2006–2010 American Community Survey showed that (in 2010 inflation-adjusted dollars) median household income was $54,024 (with a margin of error of +/− $2,798) and the median family income was $64,185 (+/− $2,216). Males had a median income of $48,974 (+/− $1,402) versus $35,513 (+/− $2,565) for females. The per capita income for the city was $24,512 (+/− $895). About 11.0% of families and 12.8% of the population were below the poverty line, including 19.0% of those under age 18 and 9.1% of those age 65 or over.[59]\n\n2000 census\n\n[edit]\n\nAs of the 2000 U.S. census,[19] there were 56,271 people, 19,930 households, and 14,210 families residing in the city. The population density was 819.2 inhabitants per square mile (316.3/km2). There were 20,958 housing units at an average density of 305.1 per square mile (117.8/km2).

Millville was selected in 1983 as one of the initial group of 10 zones chosen to participate in the program.[60] In addition to other benefits to encourage employment and investment within the Zone, shoppers can take advantage of a reduced 3.3125% sales tax rate (half of the 6+5⁄8% rate charged statewide) at eligible merchants.[61] Established in October 1988, the city's Urban Enterprise Zone status expires in December 2023.[62]\n\nThe main street in Vineland is Landis Avenue. The traditional downtown area is located several blocks east and west of the intersection of Landis Avenue and the Boulevard. The Boulevard is a pair of roads that flank the main north–south railroad, which connected Vineland with Cape May to the south and Camden/Philadelphia to the north. After many years of decline, there has been much recent activity to restore the vitality of \"The Avenue\" and the center city area. New construction includes a new transportation center, courthouse, post office, elementary school / community center and sidewalk upgrades. In 2005, Vineland was designated a Main Street Community and, through the work of this group, money has been earmarked to continue this improvement through property and facade improvements, business retention and marketing.[63]\n\nGovernment\n\n[edit]\n\nLocal government\n\n[edit]\n\nThe City of Vineland is governed within the Faulkner Act, formally known as the Optional Municipal Charter Law, under the Mayor-Council (Plan A), implemented based on the recommendations of a Charter Study Commission as of July 1, 1952, months after the city's formation.[64] The city is one of 71 municipalities (of the 564) statewide that use this form of government.[65] The governing body is a mayor, serving as the city's chief executive, and a five-member city council, serving as the city's legislature. The mayor and council are elected at-large to serve concurrent four-year terms of office in non-partisan elections held in leap years as part of the November general election.[8][4][66] An ordinance passed by the council in 2011 shifted elections from May to November, effectively extending the term of those members serving at the time by six months.[67]\n\nAs of 2023 , the mayor of Vineland is Anthony Fanucci whose term of office ends on December 31, 2024.[68] Members of the Vineland city council are Council President Elizabeth Arthur, Council Vice President David Acosta, Ronald John Franceschini Jr., Paul F. Spinelli and Albert Vargas, all of whom serving terms of office ending on December 31, 2024.[4][69][70][71]\n\nIn November 2019, the city council appointed Elizabeth Arthur to fill the seat vacated by Angela Calakos following her resignation after announcing that she was moving out of the city. Arthur served on an interim basis until the November 2019 general election, when she was elected to serve the balance of the term office.[72]\n\nIn January 2013, Ruben Bermudez took office as the city's first Hispanic mayor.[73]\n\nFederal, state and county representation\n\n[edit]\n\nVineland is located in the 2nd Congressional District[74] and is part of New Jersey's 1st state legislative district.[75][76][77]\n\nFor the 118th United States Congress, New Jersey's 2nd congressional district is represented by Jeff Van Drew (R, Dennis Township).[78] New Jersey is represented in the United States Senate by Democrats Cory Booker (Newark, term ends 2027)[79] and Bob Menendez (Englewood Cliffs, term ends 2025).[80][81]\n\nFor the 2024-2025 session, the 1st legislative district of the New Jersey Legislature is represented in the State Senate by Mike Testa (R, Vineland) and in the General Assembly by Antwan McClellan (R, Ocean City) and Erik K. Simonsen (R, Lower Township).[82]\n\nCumberland County is governed by a Board of County Commissioners composed of seven members who are elected at large by the citizens of Cumberland County in partisan elections and serve staggered three-year terms in office, with either two or three seats coming up for election each year in a three-year cycle. Annually, the seven board members select a Director and Deputy Director for one-year terms.[83] As of 2024 , members of the Cumberland County Board of County Commissioners (with party affiliation, residence and term-end year listed in parentheses) are:\n\nDouglas A. Albrecht (R, Vineland, 2025),[84] Deputy Director Antonio Romero (R, Vineland, 2024),[85] Sandra Taylor (R, Downe Township; 2026),[86] Victoria Groetsch-Lods (R, Vineland, 2025),[87] Arthur Marchand (R, Hopewell Township, 2026),[88] James Sauro (R, Vineland, 2026)[89] and Director Joseph V. Sileo (R, Vineland, 2024).[90][83][91][92][93][94][95]\n\nThe county's constitutional officers are: Clerk Celeste Riley (D, Bridgeton, 2024),[96][97] Sheriff Michael Donato (R, Bridgeton, 2026)[98][99] and Surrogate Rudolph Luisi (R, Vineland, 2028).[100][101][91]\n\nPolitics\n\n[edit]\n\nAs of March 2011, there were a total of 37,583 registered voters in Vineland, of which 10,388 (27.6%) were registered as Democrats, 6,109 (16.3%) were registered as Republicans and 21,059 (56.0%) were registered as Unaffiliated.
