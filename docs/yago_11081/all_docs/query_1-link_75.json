        "text": "Patty Van Dam, a clothing sales assistant from Rijswijk, was a contestant on season 4 of Lotto Weekend Miljonairs, the Dutch version of the show, on March 2 and 9, 2002.\n\nShe won €125.000, becoming the second female contestant to walk away with such sum after the changeover from Dutch guilder to the Euro. Interestingly, she was the second €125.000 winner in the space of a month, the first being Annie Veenema.\n\nWWTBAM Run[]\n\nFastest Finger First[]\n\nFastest Finger First Question Place the four sons of Princess Margriet in order and start with the youngest prince. ⬥ A: Floris ⬥ B: Bernhard ⬥ C: Maurits ⬥ D: Pieter-Christiaan\n\nFrom 10 contestants, only Patty (with a time of 6.65 seconds) correctly answered A-D-B-C, making it into the hot seat.\n\nPatty's Run To The Million[]\n\n€25 (1 of 15) - Not Timed Which 'ticker' is a piece of clothing? ⬥ A: Telephone ticker ⬥ B: Butt ticker ⬥ C: Inticker ⬥ D: Back ticker\n\nWith regards to fashion, B: Butt ticker is also called a bum-coat, with is a coat design with tails at the back.\n\n€50 (2 of 15) - Not Timed Which clown offers a 'home away from home' to family members of seriously ill children? ⬥ A: Ronald McDonald ⬥ B: Bassie ⬥ C: Oleg Popov ⬥ D: Pipo the Clown\n\n€125 (3 of 15) - Not Timed Henny Vrienten, Ernst Jansz, Jan Hendriks and Jan Pijnenburg played together in the band...? ⬥ A: Klein Orkest ⬥ B: De Dike ⬥ C: Het Goede Doel ⬥ D: Doe Maar\n\n€250 (4 of 15) - Not Timed What is a dish of stewed potatoes with apple called? ⬥ A: Water gruel ⬥ B: Hague bluff ⬥ C: Hot lightning ⬥ D: Hotchpotch\n\n€500 (5 of 15) - Not Timed - Safety Net Question After which animal - besides the capricorn - is the other tropic on earth named? ⬥ A: Aries ⬥ B: Leo ⬥ C: Cancer ⬥ D: Taurus\n\n€1.000 (6 of 15) - Not Timed Whose sister has been starring since September 2001 in the same soap opera that her brother once played? ⬥ A: Reinout Oerlemans ⬥ B: Peter Faber ⬥ C: Ferri Somogyi ⬥ D: Antonie Kamerling\n\n€2.000 (7 of 15) - Not Timed At what location in Amsterdam have all the royal inaugurations taken place since 1815?\n\n'Ask the Audience' lifeline used ⬥ A: Concert hall ⬥ B: Royal Palace ⬥ C: Westerkerk ⬥ D: The New Church Ask the Audience Results: A: 2% ⬥ B: 35% ⬥ C: 12% ⬥ D: 51%\n\nUnsure of the answer, Patty decided to ask the audience. With just over half of the audience votes going towards D: The New Church, she decided to lock it in as her answer, winning €2.000.\n\n€4.000 (8 of 15) - Not Timed Who scored the winning Dutch goal against Germany in the semi-final of the 1988 European Football Championship? ⬥ A: Ruud Gullit ⬥ B: Wim Kieft ⬥ C: Marco van Basten ⬥ D: Dennis Bergkamp\n\n€8.000 (9 of 15) - Not Timed Who is currently the mayor of Utrecht? ⬥ A: Wim Deetman ⬥ B: Ivo Opstelten ⬥ C: Henk Westbroek ⬥ D: Annie Brouwer-Korf\n\n€16.000 (10 of 15) - Not Timed - Safety Net Question Which film was not made by Bert Haanstra? ⬥ A: Glass ⬥ B: Bicycles ⬥ C: Zoo ⬥ D: Fanfare\n\n€32.000 (11 of 15) - Not Timed In which Shakespearean tragedy was the main character married to Desdemona?\n\n'Phone a Friend' and '50:50' lifelines used ⬥ A: Othello ⬥ B: Hamlet ⬥ C: Romeo (& Juliet) ⬥ D: Macbeth\n\nPatty thought the answer was A: Othello, but wasn't certain enough, so decided to phone her daughter Esther. However, Esther suggested that the answer was D: Macbeth, although she wasn't sure. Patty then decided to use her 50:50, which left her with A: Othello and B: Hamlet. With the answer she had thought it was all along still remaining, Patty decided to lock in A: Othello, winning €32.000.\n\nPatty took her time and worked her way through the answers of this question - at one stage, trying to picture the clock inside Notre Dame. Eventually, she decided to play her instinct of B: Gothic, which won her €64.000.\n\nUnsure of the answer, Patty worked her way through the four possibilities. At one point, she wanted to stop the game, however she did not seriously consider it. Going back and forth between A: Sublimation and D: Melt, she eventually decided to play 'Sublimation'. After locking in her answer, she won €125.000.\n\nThe klaxon then called time, and Patty would return the following week with €125.000 and no remaining lifelines.\n\nNotes[]\n\nPatty's first episode was broadcast exactly one month after Annie Veenema's run - however Veenema did not earn her €125.000 winnings until her second episode.\n\nTrivia[]\n\nA few years after her run, in 2006, Patty began working at the company Arnold & Siedsma, specialising in the legal protection of intellectual property such as inventions, trademarks and designs.\n\nShe now lives in The Hague - which also happens to be the home town of Ton Wiggenraad.\n\nSources[]"
