        "text": "A comedy, shot in the magnificent town of Giethorn, about a small Dutch village in the late 50’s. The villagers take pride in their brass band, but after a conflict the band splits up days before the regional band contest, due to the personal conflict between the two leading musicians. The local maestro is between crossfire by the opposing sides and he struggles to restore unity back to the band and the village, through a clever plan. Oh, did I mention there’s a Romeo and Juliette-sque love story?\n\nThis film’s humor is a bit outdated, but it’s a great film about the Netherlands. It captures the core of Dutch personality by posing the idea that although people may differ, the way to produce something good does not come through opposition and fight but through tolerance, concord and collaboration.\n\nThe fact that the film is a comedy, epitomizes the notion that things should not be taken too seriously, while the scenery is so amazing that human strife (if you can call that way, the hilarious misadventures of the opposing parties) seems out of place. Only the two lovers seem to be aware that there’s no point in fighting over trivial matters, therefore they seem to be the only ones in accordance with the background and although crazy in love, they are of the few sane persons in the village.\n\nThe film was shot a mere thirteen years after WW2, so I guess that part of the violence was still present in the people’s hearts. The conflict between the musicians is short of a war in a mini scale, but small conflicts can heat up, I mean come on! A small village split in two? Proportionally, that’s as insane as having the world split in half. I think that the scenery acts as a reminder of what truly matters. Beauty. That’s your world people. Enjoy it."
