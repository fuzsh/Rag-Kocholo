        "text": "Literature is a way to express beliefs and perceptions that exhibit human conscience. It generally explores man’s actions and thoughts in relation to his environment. But, a question that arrives from depth of a thoughtful mind asks, “Is it necessary that every single being/ habitat / nature /environment should exist in the context of homo-sapiens/humans? The above contemplation is supported by Charles Darwin’s treatise “to ennoble and humanize animals.” It establishes man as superior race and has evolved from primitive species of apes and monkeys. It then questions man’s existence as “humane, benevolent and affectionate “cocompanions. The dichotomy brings forth the utilitarian and anthropocentric sensibility of Victorian Age. But our stance goes deep to investigate the unanimous disposition of man in 21 century that works on pragmatics of scientific, logical and utilitarian approach. Representation of non – humans as proxy to humans is not only limited to human actions. It extends ...\n\nReaction through art, observed among the 20th century artistic movements, can result in artistic works in which animals are made the object of violence. The objections caused by these works sometimes make people question what art is and its value, and sometimes result in legal interventions. It is the forms of expression in contemporary art where idea gets ahead of physical production. In such an atmosphere, 'philosophy of art activities that question what art is' have become almost equivalent to artistic production. However, the controversial works make the concepts of ethics, law or public influence determine what art can or cannot be. In the background of all these developments, advances in the field of biology blurred the boundaries between animals and humans. After such developments, through which the anthropocentric thought system has lost its power, the position of animals in the system will also change. The reappraisal of animals will fundamentally affect the behavior of the human species towards them, undoubtedly. In such a system where the determinants of the concept of ethics are redefined, objectification of animals will not be ethical as before. In this regard, art can no longer be separated from other fields. When the determinant of the boundaries of art is a non-art field, the discussions within the field lose their meaning. This study aims to investigate the limits of contemporary art by examining the reactions to the selected examples of artists whose ways of including animals in their productions are criticized.\n\nThe study is intended to contribute to our understanding of the current perspectives of the human – non-human relationship with animals in captivity in the tourism industry, in the notion of the more ethical and critical turn in tourism studies. Natural Science has already held research on zoos and Animal studies, and we have already witnessed a vivid moral shift also within the studies in Social Science. However, there is a notable lack of research of zoos within the (still new) ethical turn in tourism studies. Covering the gap of knowledge on animals in captivity in the notion of the ethical turn is well beyond the scope of this study. However, the intended outcome of this research is to bring awareness of the need for re-thinking the human non-human relationship in tourism studies. This thesis is not another research on the ethical issues related to the captivity, but rather about how the evergreen zoo advocates’ arguments stand within the more ethical notion in contemporary tour..."
