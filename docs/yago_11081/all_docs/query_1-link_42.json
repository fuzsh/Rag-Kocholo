        "text": "Bingewatched this four-episodes series just this morning. The story is centrered around IRA assaults in The Netherlands and its border countries - in the late 1980s - and the hunt for those involved. Great series, acting and script. The ad hoc cooperation between countries involved is quite interesting. Will watch it soon for a second time. Very interesting and enjoyable.\n\nI just can't get that dancing scene, ending in a pool, out of my head. The way it's filmed, the energy and the acting. This scene alone beats al those cheap Netflix Christmas films and more.\n\nThelma Ritter, ladies and gentlemen. Film needed her, as film needed Brenda de Banzie and needs Bruce McGill - and likewise actors. Their performances are often the cherry on the cake. Love them as you love the leads. Written by Arthur Miller (script), playwright and once husband of Marilyn Monroe.\n\nTop character actors Judi Dench, Maggie Smith, Eileen Atkins and Joan Plowright talk with each other about their careers on stage and at the movies, their life, certain co-workers and . Splendid, with a couple of nice laughs. Laurence Olivier - Plowright's husband - seems to be the thin red line between them. Nothing like a dame is a pleasure to watch.\n\nWhat a delight to watch. This new version does not detract from the first version and is even an improvement on some points. Spielberg managed to make the musical work based on one of Shakespeare's most poignant storytelling. One of the reviews I've read calls West Side Story one of Spielberg's best movies of this century. I wholeheartedly agree.\n\nThe final part of The Beatles: Get Back was released last Sunday - a day later it was twenty years ago that George Harrison left this material world , you understand that I just had to watch it again. The first thing what surprised me was that there were images of Twickenham available, the same shown in The Beatles: Get Back. The second thing is that most of George's 1980's work isn't shown, which makes George Harrison: Living in the…\n\nI've watched all parts now. Never have I experienced such an intimate music documentary. It's more than a music documentary - it's a time document. I have no words for this documentary. It's like you're sitting next to them on a stool while they literally make history. You see works of art arise. You see the fight to get there. You see people having doubts. It's really unbelievable that these images are actually and finally there. Ringo, George, Paul, John, Billy Preston. Goosebumps all over.\n\nYes, the logic is sometimes hard to find in the film. Yes, you should not think too much about it, especially not about the fact that a World War is reduced to an exciting boy's book. But it works, as a Saturday night movie. The cast is good, the story decent. And why should I make it so hard on myself while Covid makes life harder again. I had a great time, and that's what movies are for as well.\n\nLook, I love Andrew Garfield as much as the next guy since I saw him in the impressive film Boy A, but this film is a couple of galaxies away from the films I usually appreciate.\n\nOn October 3rd, Goran_mont wrote in his review of Amsterdamed:\n\n'Bert Haanstra as a fanfare conductor might be the greatest cameo in cameo history'\n\nIt's true. I re-watched Amsterdamned for this alone. Actually, it's a sensation, compared to the 'wait for it' Simon van Collem cameo in this film and just about any other cameo in a Dutch film.\n\nI knew the Colonel Bogey March long before I saw this grand film for the first time. Perhaps my father whistled it once, perhaps I heard it on the radio. The memory of the how is forgotten, but the what still stands. In my final year of high school, we had to read 25 books for French class - when I found out this film was based on the novel by French novelist Pierre Boulle, I asked my teacher if…\n\nTen years ago, I finally understood where they were going with this project called Phase I of Marvel's Cinematic Universe. Ten years later, I liked the film more than the first time I saw it because I've seen its reason d'etait, its cause. A couple of points: Chris Evans was born to play Captain America - his miscast as Johnny Storm/Human Torch is exactly the opposite. Evans embodies the spirit of the American soldiers who fought on the beaches and…"
