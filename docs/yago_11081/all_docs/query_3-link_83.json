        "text": "In his article ‘Insiders and Outsiders: Latent Urban Thinking in Movies of Modern Rome’ David Bass analyses how cinema portraits the city by assembling fragments of it, creating a collage that does not necessarily attend any realistic logic of representation. He distinguishes two main approaches: the Outsider and the Insider’s views. The former, closely connected to the phenomenon of tourism, offers “a treasure-house of aesthetic delights” while the latter aims to mediate the city, or at least an aspect of it, from the connoisseur’s perspective.\n\nAlthough Bass focuses on the filmography of Rome, his analysis might easily be extrapolated to most of the cities that had been scenarios of multiple films, as it is the case of Amsterdam. What follows is an analysis of a specific film, AMSTERDAMNED (1988), which suits perfectly the category of the Outsider’s film.\n\nDespite of being a Dutch production, this movie takes the spectator into a virtual guided tour of Amsterdam, representing the city by means of its most iconic landmarks. The story depicts a series of grotesques murders that takes place in the canal circuit of the city centre and the best detective in town’s frustrating attempts to discover the identity of the assassin. By locating the action in the canals the movie draws all the attention to the most iconic landmark of the city, which is known as the Venice of the North. The movie starts by showing how the first victim, a prostitute working in the mythic Red Light District, brutally dies in hands of a diver emerging from the dark water of the canals. In the next sequence a bird-eye view of the city centre introduces the location of the story, Amsterdam. While the camera zooms in depicting the most iconic bridge of the city, de Magere Brug, a voice-over welcomes the spectator to Amsterdam in different languages. Thus, not only does the movie exploits the city from the tourist’s point of interest but also integrates the phenomenon of tourism in the diegesis of the story and literally treats the spectator as a tourist. Not surprisingly, who discovers the prostitute’s dead body hanging from a bridge is a touring boat peacefully cruising through the canals. The development of the story shows the viewer a collage of treasures of Amsterdam: its historic centre with the typical Dutch facades, the canals, the bridges and the street organs and the Red Light district with its prostitutes. The detective takes the spectator to the Rijskmuseum to see Rembrandt’s De Nachtwatcht, contemplated by a group of Japanese tourists, and dines in beautiful windmills. Similar to the Italian ‘film cartolina’, AMSTERDAMNED assembles a series of touristic snapshot that portrait the beauties of the city from street and air view perspectives but also from the canals low angle.\n\nThe distorted look of the outsider not only affects the city but also the characters of the fabula. In its effort to commit to the conventions of the Hollywood detective/action genre, the characters’ behaviour corresponds more to the stereotypes of American life style. In this way, they drink bourbon instead of beer, they move through the city always by car and not by bike, and waiters offer to refill coffee to their clients, which is unthinkable in The Netherlands. The attempt to ‘Americanise’ the characters, however, also adds a layer of humour to the story.\n\nUndoubtedly, the climax of the movie comes with the boat race through the canals of the city, which offers a boat tour at high speed and probably with richer views than the real thing. This scene clearly refers to or borrows from another Outsider’s film from the 1970’s, Puppet on a chain, in which another boat race takes place and also ends with the explosion of the bad guy’s boat. However, what is remarkable about the race is the manipulation of the topography of Amsterdam that is brutally mixed with the canals of another Dutch city, Utrecht, typically known by having terraces on the water level. The assembling of the two cities, easily unnoticed by the outsider spectator, draws a smile on any viewer acquaintance with both cities.\n\nAll in all, the aestheticizing gaze of the film remakes the city for the tourist by reducing Amsterdam to its landmarks and suppressing other aspects of the urban context. In this way, film shows its potential to create what Bass names “a city of attractions” for the lazy tourist: “a collection of desirable wonders, visitable without hot slogs through potentially boring, dangerous, ‘non-places’ in between (Bass 1997). The Outsider’s film offers a collection of memories to those that have already visited the city, but also functions as promotion tool to attract new visitors. The latter explains the reason why Woody Allen’s recent film-cities (VICKY CRISTINA BARCELONA, MIDNIGHT IN PARIS and TO ROME WITH LOVE) have been largely funded by the cities themselves."
