        "text": "NOF – Netherlands Foundation for Educational Films\n\nIn the early 1940s an increasing number of commentators argued that teachers should be able to screen educational films themselves, in their own classrooms.\n\nThe Wieringermeer of Marofilm\n\nOn three occasions between 1938-1948, Alex Roosdorp and his wife Marie filmed the Wieringermeer area, in the Dutch province of North Holland.\n\nWWII and the Resistance: From LO-LKP to De overval\n\nAfter WWII, the studios in Duivendrecht and Wassenaar had been plundered and destroyed. Many people essential to the Dutch film industry had either been killed or had fled abroad.\n\nThe first Dutch War Films\n\nThe changing spirit of times is clearly reflected in the Dutch war film. Our vision of the war in particular is what emerges from the images.\n\nAt Last: Support for Dutch Feature Films\n\nIn 1946, film production appeared for the first time as an item in the federal budget. For the first time, the government was prepared to invest structurally in film.\n\nNOF Films\n\nMost of the films that the NOF supplied were intended to be used as aids to the teaching of general school subjects.\n\nFilm Didactics\n\nThe films that the NOF distributed in the 1940s and 1950s are characterised by two different, and seemingly opposing, didactic principles.\n\nForeign productions in Cinetone in the 1950s and 1960s\n\nThe arrival of foreign producers and film crews was the perfect opportunity for Dutch studio staff to gain more experience.\n\nThe Arrival of Television\n\nTelevision was still in its experimental phase in the 1930s, but the medium developed rapidly and after World War II it was unstoppable.\n\nRudi Meyer and Joop Landré\n\nThe first two producers who tried to build up a measure of continuity in the postwar Dutch film industry were Rudi Meyer and Joop Landré.\n\nThe Dutch Documentary in the Cinema: Alleman and the 1960s\n\nWithin a few years at the beginning of the 1960s there were a number of long Dutch documentaries that were released as feature films in the cinemas.\n\nThe Critic as Guardian\n\nJust as the Filmliga had done before WWII, film critic Janus Van Domburg was very critical of the light entertainment films made in Hollywood and pleaded for more artistic films.\n\nFestivals in the Netherlands\n\nSeeing the emergence of film festivals abroad, the Dutch organised their own film event in 1955: the Filmweek Arnhem.\n\nPostwar Avant-Garde\n\nAfter the Second World War, pre-war avant-garde films still defined the genre. It was not until 1958 that a new wind began to blow.\n\nChildren’s Film from Laan to Van der Linden: Childhood Heroes\n\nFrom 1900-1960, the production of Dutch children’s films definitely had its own dynamic that was independent from the production of other feature films.\n\nSmall viewers, big audience: the children’s films of Rex Film\n\nChildren love films. From the 1950s on, the films made by Henk van der Lindens production company Rex Film drew full houses, year in and year out.\n\nFilm’s Heyday – and Its Decline\n\nDirectly after WWII, cinema attendance reached an all-time high. In total, nearly 90 million tickets were sold in 1946 – a record that has never been broken."
