        "text": "Diverse, welcoming and a lot of fun – everything you never heard about Serbia is true. ========= (in the capital of Serbia) The city of Belgrade, in the north-central part of the country, is located at the convergence of three historically important routes of travel between Europe and the Balkans: an east-west route along the Danube River valley from Vienna to the Black Sea; another that runs westward along the valley of the Sava River toward Trieste and northern Italy; and a third running southeast along the valleys of the Morava and Vardar rivers to the Aegean Sea. The city grew up around an ancient fortress on the Kalemegdan headland that was encompassed on three sides by the Sava and the Danube. The first fortress was built by the Celts in the 4th century BCE and was known by the Romans as Singidunum. It was destroyed by the Huns in 442 and changed hands among the Sarmatians, Goths, and Gepidae before it was recaptured by the Byzantine emperor Justinian. It was later held by the Franks and the Bulgars, and in the 11th century became a frontier town of Byzantium. In 1284 it came under Serbian rule, and in 1402 Stephen Lazarević made it the capital of Serbia. The Ottoman Turks besieged the city in 1440, and after 1521 it was in their hands except for three periods of occupation by the Austrians. + During the Turkish period Belgrade was a lively commercial center where goods were traded from various parts of the Ottoman Empire. After the first Serbian uprising under Karadjordje in 1804, Belgrade became the Serbian capital from 1807–13, but the Turks recaptured it. The Serbs were given control of the citadel in 1867, when Belgrade once more became the capital of Serbia. + Since World War II Belgrade has become an industrial city, now the largest commercial center in Serbia. + The old fortress of Kalemegdan is now a historical monument; its former glacis has been rebuilt as a garden. Belgrade is home to various cultural and educational institutions, including the University of Belgrade. There are many museums and galleries, of which the oldest; the National Museum (Narodni Muzej), was founded in 1844.The city's many theaters, museums, monuments and opera houses boast a deep and fissured cultural life while the beaches and rivers attract sunbathers, sports enthusiasts, and partygoers on the popular floating river barges that serve as nightclubs. + At the end of one of the most beautiful tourist routes of Belgrade, which begins with Kalemegdan fortress and extends along the entire downtown, rises a magnificent Cathedral of Saint Sava, the largest active Orthodox church in the world. Conceived as a monument of gratitude to St. Sava, the first Serbian archbishop and educator, who made the independent Serbian church, reconciled Balkan nations, raised Hilandar and many other monasteries and thus created the Serbian state and the Serbian culture, this temple was built on the site where his remains were burned in 1595, at today’s St. Sava plateau.\n\nAlsace is a region in northeastern France that borders Switzerland and Germany. ====== (in the Haut-Rhin department in Grand Est in northeastern France, in the historical region of Alsace) Alsace is so close to Germany that you can travel by tram from the regional capital Strasbourg, to Kehl, the nearest German city, in just 15 minutes. Although Alsace is part of France, its borders have not always been clear. The region has been passed between French and German control several times since 1681, when Strasbourg was conquered by French forces -- making Alsatian culture a mix of French and German influences. + Featured here is Eguisheim, birthplace of the Alsatian vineyards; it has been listed as one of the Most Beautiful Villages in France since 2003, and has been awarded the National Grand Prize winner for Flowers since 1989. (The historic village plunges the visitor into the Renaissance.) The village lies on the edge of the Ballons des Vosges Nature Park, where the Vosges meet the Upper Rhine Plain. + Located along the Alsace Wine Route, only 5 km (~3 mi.) from Colmar, Eguisheim is surrounded by a 339 hectare (~838 acre) vineyard, whose hills “Eichberg” and “Pfersigberg” are known as the “Grands Crus” of Alsace. In the east of the country, it’s a medieval village built in concentric circles around Château de Sain-Léon-Pfalz, a 13th-century French castle. When looking at a photo of Éguisheim taken from above (as depicted here), it is easy to be amazed by the shape of this medieval city, The main street (Grand-Rue) crosses the village from East to West. It passes by the main square: Place du Château Saint-Leon. The circular streets should not be missed, particularly the rue du Rempart (North and South).Expect cobbled streets, colorful half-timbered houses with pointed roofs, flowers lining every windowsill, and cute local shops and restaurants. The vineyards around Eguisheim produce Alsace wine of high quality. The village is ranked in the top 20 of Les Plus Beaux Villages de France. In May 2013 it was voted the 'Village préféré des Français' (Favorite French Village), an annual distinction that passes from town to town throughout France. + Human presence in the area as early as the Paleolithic age is testified by archaeological excavations. In the early Middle Ages, the Dukes of Alsace built the castle here, around which the current settlement developed. + Eguisheim has two areas that produce wine of exceptional quality, Eichberg (in English: Oak Mountain) and Pfersigberg (in English: Peach Mountain), characterized by the very hard Muschelkalk. + The village is a popular tourist destination, in part because the Alsace \"Wine Route\" passes the village. (The area around Eguisheim is popular with hikers and cyclists.) + The village is also a Village Cigogne d'Alsace (in Alsatian: Elsässisches Storckadorf), meaning that there are storks in the village. Eguisheim has a park dedicated to the white stork (Ciconia ciconia) which is freely accessed.\n\n\"...Hills of forest green where the mountains touch the sky A dream come true, I'll live there 'til I die....\" -- Don McLean ========== (In the Republic of Slovenia, a country in southern Central Europe) Bled Castle (Slovene: Blejski grad) is a medieval castle built on a precipice above the city of Bled in Slovenia, overlooking Lake Bled. (According to written sources, it is the oldest Slovenian castle and is currently one of the most visited tourist attractions in Slovenia.) Today, the castle is employed as a historical museum with a collection that represents the lake's history. +This castle was first mentioned in a deed of donation issued by Emperor Henry II to the bishops of Brixen on May 22, 1011. The castle remained as the residence of the bishops for centuries. At the time of the deed of donation, the area belonged to the March (or Margraviate) of Carniola in the Holy Roman Empire, but in 1278 it passed to the Austrian House of Habsburg. + The oldest part of the castle is the Romanesque tower. In the Middle Ages more towers were built and the fortifications were improved. Other buildings were constructed in the Renaissance style. The buildings are arranged around two courtyards, which are connected with a staircase. There is a chapel in the upper courtyard, which was built in the 16th century and renovated around 1700, when it was also painted with illusionist frescoes. (The castle also has a drawbridge over a moat.) + Perched atop a steep cliff more than 100 meters above the lake, Bled Castle is how many, if not most, people imagine a medieval fortress to be, with towers, ramparts, moats, and a terrace offering magnificent views. The castle houses a museum collection that traces the lake’s history from earliest times to the development of Bled as a resort in the 19th century. + The castle, built on two levels, dates back to the early 11th century, although most of what stands here now is from the 16th century. For 800 years it was the seat of the Bishops of Brixen. Among the museum holdings, there's a large collection of armour and weapons, and jewelry that was found at the early Slav burial pits at Pristava. The relatively small16th-century Gothic chapel contains paintings of castle donor Henry II and his wife Kunigunda on either side of the main altar. + You can reach the castle on foot via one of three trails that are signposted \"Grad.\" The first trail starts from the car park behind the Bledec Hostel; the second is a (difficult) path up from the Castle Lido swimming area; and the third starts just north of the Parish Church of St Martin.\n\n\"When we were studying at the Royal Antwerp Academy, we were taught to seek inspiration from everyone, everything, and everywhere.\" -- Dries van Noten (in the Flemish Region of Belgium) Lively Antwerp is a hidden gem. Its medieval streets, Renaissance monuments, and vibrant nightlife tend to be overshadowed by its reputation as center of the diamond trade and as the world's fifth-largest port. Biking is a popular choice for getting around this stylish Flemish city. See thousands of Old Masters at the Royal Museum and Rubens House. + The city of Antwerp is the capital and largest city of Antwerp Province, and the third largest city in Belgium after Tournai and Couvin). It is the most populous municipality in Belgium, and the country's second-largest metropolitan area, after Brussels. Flowing through Antwerp is the river Scheldt. Antwerp, linked to the North Sea by the river's Westerschelde estuary. It is about 40 km (25 mi.) north of Brussels, and about 15 km (9 mi.) south of the Dutch border. The Port of Antwerp is one of the biggest in the world, ranking second in Europe, after Rotterdam. + Both economically and culturally, Antwerp is (and has long been) an important city in the Low Countries, especially before and during the Spanish Fury (of 1576). The Bourse at Antwerp, originally built in 1531 was re-built in 1872;, and became the world's first purpose-built commodity exchange. + There is a folklore tradition that the name Antwerpen is from Dutch handwerpen (\"hand-throwing\"). A giant called Antigoon is said to have lived near the Scheldt river and extracted a toll from passing boatmen. He severed the hand of anyone who did not pay, and threw it in the river. Eventually the giant was killed by a young hero named Silvius Brabo, who cut off the giant's own hand and flung that into the river. This is is celebrated by a statue (illustrated below) in the city's main market square, the Grote Markt. + Historical Antwerp allegedly had its origins in a Gallo-Roman vicus. The Merovingian Antwerp was evangelized by Saint Amand in the 7th century. Antwerp became a margraviate in 980. In the 11th century, the best-known leader of the First Crusade (from 1096–1099), Godfrey of Bouillon, was originally Margrave of Antwerp, from 1076 until his death in 1100, though he was later also Duke of Lower Lorraine (1087–1100) and Defender of the Holy Sepulchre (1099–1100). IAntwerp was also the headquarters of Edward III during his early negotiations with Jacob van Artevelde. + During World War I, Antwerp became the fallback point of the Belgian Army after the defeat at Liège, but the city was taken after heavy fighting by the German Army, and the Belgians were forced to retreat westwards. Antwerp remained under German occupation until the Armistice. + During World War II, the city was a strategic target because of its port. It was occupied by Germany on 18 May 1940 and liberated by the British 11th Armored Division on 4 September 1944.\n\n\"The meaning of life is to find your gift. The purpose of life is to give it away.\" -- Pablo Picasso ====== (in the capital of the Province of Málaga, in the autonomous community of Andalusia in southern Spain) The port city of Málaga is known for being the hometown of the famous artist Pablo Picasso. Aside from this, the city is a beautiful place to visit as it features beaches with golden white sand and the vast Old Town with stunning architecture. (Guests will love exploring the city as they can stroll around and take in its scenery.) Loaded with history and brimming with a youthful vigor that acknowledges its multi-layered past, the city that gave the world Picasso has transformed itself in spectacular fashion, with half a dozen new art galleries, a rethought port area and a nascent art district called Soho. (The bar scene could put bags under the eyes of an insomniac madrileño, while the food culture encompasses both Michelin stars and tastefully tatty fish shacks. + The city lies along a wide bay of the Mediterranean Sea at the mouth of the Guadalmedina River in the center of the Costa del Sol. It was founded by the Phoenicians in the 12th century BCE, conquered by the Romans and the Visigoths, and taken by the Moors in 711. Under Moorish rule it became one of the most important cities in Andalusia. When the caliphate of Córdoba disintegrated, the kingdom of Málaga was founded, ruled over by emirs who named it “terrestrial paradise.” (After they had failed several times, Christians took the city on August 19, 1487.) + Today, Málaga is one of the great Spanish Mediterranean ports (after Barcelona). Sheltered by the surrounding sierras, Málaga’s mild climate makes it an internationally known resort city. Nearby are several narrow beaches; some, such as Marbella and Fuengirola, have pine woods reaching to the seashore. The most important business sectors in Málaga are tourism, construction, and technology services. + The Guadalmedina River, which before the construction of the dam at Agujero caused frequent severe flooding, flows through Málaga from north to south. Towering above the city is Mount Gibralfaro (558 feet [170 meters]), crowned by an ancient Arab fortress. The cathedral, in the center of the Old City, was begun in 1528 on the site of a mosque; the interior, main facade, and one of the towers were completed in 1782, but the second tower remains unfinished. Other important churches are those of Santo Cristo de la Salud, Sagrario, and Victoria, the latter being notable for the macabre decorations on the tomb of the counts of Luna. The Provincial Museum of Art has a collection of 17th-century masterpieces as well as modern works—including some by Pablo Picasso, who was born in the city at No. 16, Plaza de la Merced. In the 21st century the city invested heavily in new cultural offerings, including the Picasso Museum, the Contemporary Art Museum, the Carmen Thyssen Museum, and branches of the Pompidou Centre and Russian State Museum.\n\nThere are many reasons to visit Andalusia, but none are more compelling than its vibrant riverside capital. ===== (in the autonomous community of Andalusia, in southwestern Spain) Originally founded by the Romans and later conquered by the Moors, Seville is rich in cultural traditions. “As one of the most significant Atlantic ports on the Iberian Peninsula dating back to ancient times, its monumental heritage creates an amazing combination of history, beauty, and food for travelers to enjoy. Elegant and attractive, the city displays almost constant reminders of its time under Moorish rule with striking landmarks such as the Royal Alcázar of Seville (one of the most beautiful places to visit in Spain) and La Giralda as standouts. Seville is the storied backdrop for more than 100 operas — among them \"Carmen,\" \"The Barber of Seville,\" and \"Don Juan de Mañara\" — and has some world-class museums. The tapestry of influences, abundance of regional products, and immense local talent translate to a culinary scene that rivals the many epicurean power players throughout the country. Plus, the Mediterranean climate means sunshine, blue skies, and warm weather throughout the year — so it’s always a good time for sightseeing and enjoying a glass of wine or sherry at an alfresco café. + Now home to three UNESCO World Heritage Sites, Seville is front-loaded with historic charm. The Alcazar palace complex is a stunning collage of architectural styles, and the Cathedral is famed for its beauty and its status as Christopher Columbus’ burial site. Designed to offer shade in sunny Spain, the Metropol Parasol is the world’s largest wooden structure, a massive mix of grids and swirls that contains a market and a terrace observatory. + The city of Sevilla, capital of the province of Sevilla, lies on the left (east) bank of the Guadalquivir River at a point about 54 miles (87 km) north of the Atlantic Ocean and about 340 miles (550 km) southwest of Madrid. An inland port, it is the chief city of Andalusia and the fourth largest in Spain. Sevilla was important in history as a cultural center, as a capital of Muslim Spain, and as a center for Spanish exploration of the New World.\n\n\"We live in a wondrous time in which the strong is weak because of his moral scruples and the weak grows strong because of his audacity.\" -- Otto von Bismarck ===== (in the district of Ansbach, in Bavaria, Germany) The city of Dinkelsbühl, a former imperial city, is an important tourist resort on the Romantic Road -- due to the exceptionally well-preserved late medieval townscape. Since 1998, Dinkelsbühl has been a large district town and since 2013 a member of the Bavarian Association of Cities; it is described as the \"most beautiful old town in Germany,\" in a slogan slogan with which the city advertises its tourism efforts. + Located near the border with Baden-Württemberg, Dinkelsbühl lies on the Wörnitz river (about 20 miles [30 km] southwest of Ansbach) in the southeast of the Frankenhöhe, which belongs to the Keuper Plateau in the southwest German strata between the Main and Danube rivers. Pushed to the west by a castle sandstone hilltop to the east of today's course, the Wörnitz formed a flat, triangular valley basin, which is almost completely filled by the Old Town. In the northwest and southeast, the city wall runs along the morphological edge of the bubble sandstone, which forms a plateau beyond the city moat between the valley cuts of two streams flowing into the Wörnitz from the west. In the northern valley incision, in which the bladder sandstone was washed away down to the underlying Lehrberg layers, flows the Sauwasenbach, which through its alluvial sands created a ford that is still visible today at low tide, which (allegedly) was an incentive for the founding of a village at this location. In the east, the Old Town is bordered by the Mühlgraben, a straightened arm of the Wörnitz, beyond which the Wörnitzvorstadt is still to be counted as part of the Dinkelsbühl Old Town area. + Mentioned in 928, Dinkelsbühl was fortified in the 10th century and became a free imperial city in 1273. It flourished in the 14th and 15th centuries and successfully withstood eight sieges in the Thirty Years’ War (events commemorated annually in a July festival) before it fell to Gustav II Adolf of Sweden in 1632. The 10th-century walls, along with a moat and 12th-century towers, still surround the city, thus preserving its medieval character and providing one basis for a thriving tourist trade. Notable landmarks include the late Gothic Church of St. George (1448–99; one of Germany’s finest single-naved churches, with a Romanesque tower), the old castle of the Teutonic Order (rebuilt 1761–64), the fortified town mill, and the Deutsche Haus (a 14th–15th-century mansion, with a Renaissance facade).\n\n“When the pearls of nature were sown, on this soil an owerflowing handful was gathered; the most beautiful contact between the earth and sea took place at the Montenegrin littoral.” -~ Lord Byron ===== (in the Coastal region of Montenegro) A parliamentary republic that gained full independence from Serbia in June 2006, following a referendum in May in which just over the required 55 percent of Montenegrins voted to secede from the federation, Montenegro’s parliament adopted the country’s first constitution in 2007. Montenegro is governed by independent executive, legislative, and judicial branches. The president is the head of state, elected directly for a period of five years. The unicameral parliament of Montenegro is led by a prime minister. Its judicial branch includes a constitutional court composed of five judges with nine-year terms and a supreme court with justices that have life terms. Featured here is Budva, a charming coastal town in Montenegro, famous for its historic Old Town, sandy beaches, and lively nightlife. You can explore the cobblestone streets and medieval walls of the Old Town, where you can find museums, churches, and cafes. Or you can relax on one of the many beaches along the Budva Riviera, such as Mogren, Becici, or Jaz. You can also take a boat trip to the nearby island of Sveti Nikola, where you can enjoy the nature and wildlife. (Budva is a great destination for culture, sun, and fun). With its medieval Old Town, sun-soaked beaches, and lively nightlife, the town of Budva is the stand-out attraction along the Montenegrin coastline. Its cobbled streets, harbor, museums, cafés, and boutiques, while the Adriatic backdrop offers plenty of offshore opportunities, too. + The Old Town suffered extensive damage in 1979 earthquake; repair and reconstruction took eight years (until 1987), but traces of the damage are now hardly noticeable. Today, it is a prime visitor attraction of Budva, packed with tourists during the summer months. Its narrow cobbled streets are lined with restaurants, cafes, pubs and shops. + Budva is now considered the poster child of Montenegrin tourism. Easily the country’s most-visited destination, it attracts hordes of holidaymakers intent on exploring its atmospheric Stari Grad (Old Town), sunning themselves on the bonny beaches of the Budva Riviera and partying until dawn; with scores of buzzy bars and clanging clubs, it’s not nicknamed ‘the Montenegrin Miami’ for nothing. + The famed Statue Ballerina in Budva is a stunning work of art that celebrates the beauty and grace of ballet. The statue has become a beloved symbol of the town and a must-see attraction for visitors to Montenegro. However, beyond its beauty, the statue has an emotional story behind it that adds to its allure."
