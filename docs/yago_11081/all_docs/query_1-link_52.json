        "text": "In today's time, the road is an important part of our life, we can think of any place without a road because humans need a road to travel and transport. If someone tells you that you have seen a village without a road, you will probably be shocked for a few moments. You would think that how can a village without a road be? Venice of France is famous all over the world for its beautiful views. Thousands of tourists come here and enjoy its amazing views. But Venice is a city, can you imagine a village without a single road and yet thousands of tourists go there every year? The village of Giethoorn, which is located in the northeastern Dutch province of Overijssel in the Netherlands has become a center of attraction for tourists from all over the world. There is not even a single motor vehicle, yet people come. Here, people also walk by boat in the streets. Yes, you do not get a single road for transportation at this place. It is also called the Venice of the South or the Venice of the Netherlands. Githorn is a very beautiful tourist destination and there is an influx of tourists throughout the year.\n\nThe view of the famous village of Giethoorn in the Netherlands (Holland) is very spectacular. This village full of greenery is visited by tourists throughout the year. This village without a road is made of canals. Here people use boats to come and go. Today, the whole life here is dependent on electric boats and ordinary boats. These boats make very little noise and people have no complaints about them. There are wooden bridges made here in various places. Presently the number of bridges here is more than 180. About 2600 people live in this village without roads. Due to this, the most important thing is that there is no problem like traffic here because people do not have cars and bikes, etc. Overall, it is considered a free auto zone area.\n\nIt is said that these 1-meter-deep canals were made to transport a type of grass used in fuel from one end to the other. During the excavation, many ponds and lakes were formed here. Then, perhaps no one would have guessed that the canals built to transport peat would put this place on the world map as a beautiful tourist destination. It is said that in 1958 the Dutch comedy film 'Fanfare' by 'Bert Haanstra' was made. Due to most of the shooting of this film being done here, it became famous all over the world. Local people use small boats to travel. Tourists have to park their cars on the outskirts of the village.\n\nWhile there are no roads and only canals in this village, it is said that there was a severe flood here in 1170. Due to this, the land here became very swampy. Apart from this, the soil of the entire area here became like this. After this, the people of the village did digging, etc. here and the canals came out. After this, this village gradually turned into a village with canals. After this, it became the center of discussion and today it is counted as a famous tourist destination. Due to the lack of roads, people here do not use cars or bikes, so there is no pollution of any kind here. About 3000 people live in this village. There are still no roads here and it is very quiet here for most of the day. Many of Githorn's residents live on private islands and use canoes, kayaks, or small boats with silent motors for transportation through the canals. You can reach Giethoorn by taking a flight to Amsterdam then you can take a train from Amsterdam to Giethoorn which will take about 2 hours. After getting down at Giethoorn you can rent a car to reach the exact location."
