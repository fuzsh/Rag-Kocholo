        "text": "Art Craft Design Film History\n\nGlass: An Oscar-Winning Documentary Short on Dutch Glassblowing from 1958\n\nGlass is a 1958 non-verbal documentary short by Bert Haanstra that contrasts glassblowing techniques used inside the Royal Leerdam Glass Factory with more modern industrial machines. The first half shows several men at work using traditional glassblowing to create ornate objects like vases and mugs set against jazz music, while the second part shifts abruptly into the mechanized world of industrial glass production set to a whimsical score of more synthesized music. Also, there’s a ton of great smoking! It’s a really unusual little film that went on to pick up an Oscar for Documentary Short Subject in 1959.\n\nGlass was made available by Aeon as part of their wonderfully curated selection of videos on art, design, culture, and news topics.
