Saint Catharines, city, regional municipality of Niagara, southeastern Ontario, Canada, on the south shore of Lake Ontario, at the entrance to the Welland Ship Canal. Named after the first wife of Robert Hamilton, member of the first legislative council of Upper Canada, it has grown from a small settlement established in 1790 to become the centre of the Niagara fruit belt and the largest city on the canal. In 1961 St. Catharines annexed the neighbouring towns of Merritton and Port Dalhousie, more than doubling its population and stretching its boundaries from the Niagara Escarpment (south) to Lake Ontario (north) and eastward to the canal. In the late 19th century it was famed for its mineral springs. St. Catharines is now known as the Garden City and is the site of the annual Royal Canadian Henley Regatta. It is also an industrial centre, producing automotive parts, heavy electrical appliances, structural-engineering goods, hardware, textiles, hosiery, paper and wood products, and canned fruits and vegetables.
