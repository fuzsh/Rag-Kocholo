        "text": "The Walker Family Cancer Centre has brought care closer to home for thousands of Niagara residents since it opened in 2013.\n\nNiagara residents have access to cardiac catheterization procedures and Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) stent insertions without leaving the region since our new Heart Investigation Unit (HIU) opened in 2013.\n\nSpecialized mental health services not previously available in Niagara.\n\nSpecialized women’s, babies’ and children’s healthcare provided in a bright and spacious family-centred facility with state-of-the-art birthing suites, a special care nursery for newborns and a family apartment suite available for overnight stays.\n\nOur recruitment efforts are attracting top physicians and care providers who want to work in state-of-the-art facilities using state-of-the-art equipment.\n\nThe building is one of the most advanced hospital designs in Canada when it comes to reducing the spread the infection.\n\nConsolidation of the services provided in St. Catharines supports modern practices, greater teamwork and learning among providers, which leads to better outcomes.\n\nOpportunities to incorporate leading medical and technological advances into our practices and develop greater areas of medical expertise in specialty areas.\n\nGreater educational focus due to enhanced academic partnerships with McMaster University’s Michael G. DeGroote School of Medicine, Brock University and Niagara College.\n\nIn addition, due to the size of the Intensive Care Unit, we were able to create a new Critical Care Response Team, which represents a major innovation in patient safety. A dedicated critical care nurse, physician, and other healthcare providers as required take their critical care expertise outside of the ICU and to the patient’s bedside (or wherever it is needed) 24/7. Early identification of a failing patient allows the team to either stabilize the patient on the ward or facilitate his/her early admission to the ICU. We are currently in the process of planning to expand this model to our Greater Niagara General and Welland sites."
