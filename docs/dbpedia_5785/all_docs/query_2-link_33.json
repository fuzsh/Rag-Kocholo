        "text": "Municipalities by Population Range (2021 Census)\n\nMunicipalities by Tier\n\nBelow is a list organized by Regions, Counties, Districts and Single-Tiers.\n\nREGIONS\n\nA regional government is a federation of the local, lower tier municipalities within its boundaries. Regions are referred to as \"upper tier\" municipalities and provide services such as: arterial roads; transit; policing; sewer and water systems; waste disposal; region-wide land use planning and development; as well as health and social services. Depending on its size and its history, a local municipality may be called a city, a town, or a township or a village. They are also referred to as \"lower tier\" municipalities when there is another level of municipal government like a county or region involved in providing services to residents.\n\nDurham\n\nCity of Oshawa\n\nCity of Pickering\n\nMunicipality of Clarington\n\nTown of Ajax\n\nTown of Whitby\n\nTownship of Brock\n\nTownship of Scugog\n\nTownship of Uxbridge\n\nHalton\n\nCity of Burlington\n\nTown of Halton Hills\n\nTown of Milton\n\nTown of Oakville\n\nNiagara\n\nCity of Niagara Falls\n\nCity of Port Colborne\n\nCity of St. Catharines\n\nCity of Thorold\n\nCity of Welland\n\nTown of Fort Erie\n\nTown of Grimsby\n\nTown of Lincoln\n\nTown of Niagara-on-the-Lake\n\nTown of Pelham\n\nTownship of Wainfleet\n\nTownship of West Lincoln\n\nPeel\n\nCity of Brampton\n\nCity of Mississauga\n\nTown of Caledon\n\nWaterloo\n\nCity of Cambridge\n\nCity of Kitchener\n\nCity of Waterloo\n\nTownship of North Dumfries\n\nTownship of Wellesley\n\nTownship of Wilmot\n\nTownship of Woolwich\n\nYork\n\nCity of Markham\n\nCity of Richmond Hill\n\nCity of Vaughan\n\nTown of Aurora\n\nTown of East Gwillimbury\n\nTown of Georgina\n\nTown of Newmarket\n\nTown of Whitchurch-Stouffville\n\nTownship of King\n\nCOUNTIES\n\nA county government is a federation of the local municipalities within its boundaries. Counties are referred to as \"upper tier\" municipalities. Counties exist only in southern Ontario. Local municipalities (cities, towns, villages, townships) within counties provide the majority of municipal services to their residents. The services provided by county governments are usually limited to arterial roads, health and social services and county land use planning.\n\nBruce\n\nMunicipality of Arran Elderslie\n\nMunicipality of Brockton\n\nMunicipality of Kincardine\n\nMunicipality of Northern Bruce Peninsula\n\nMunicipality of South Bruce\n\nTown of Saugeen Shores\n\nTown of South Bruce Peninsula\n\nTownship of Huron-Kinloss\n\nDufferin\n\nTown of Grand Valley\n\nTown of Mono\n\nTown of Orangeville\n\nTown of Shelburne\n\nTownship of Amaranth\n\nTownship of East Garafraxa\n\nTownship of Melancthon\n\nTownship of Mulmur\n\nElgin\n\nCity of St Thomas (Separated)*\n\nMunicipality of Bayham\n\nMunicipality of Central Elgin\n\nMunicipality of Dutton/Dunwich\n\nMunicipality of West Elgin\n\nTown of Aylmer\n\nTownship of Malahide\n\nTownship of Southwold\n\nEssex\n\nCity of Windsor (Separated)*\n\nMunicipality of Leamington\n\nTown of Amherstburg\n\nTown of Essex\n\nTown of Kingsville\n\nTown of Lakeshore\n\nTown of LaSalle\n\nTown of Tecumseh\n\nTownship of Pelee (Separated)*\n\nFrontenac\n\nCity of Kingston (Separated)*\n\nTownship of Central Frontenac\n\nTownship of Frontenac Islands\n\nTownship of North Frontenac\n\nTownship of South Frontenac\n\nGrey\n\nCity of Owen Sound\n\nTown of The Blue Mountains\n\nTown of Hanover\n\nMunicipality of Meaford\n\nTownship of Chatsworth\n\nTownship of Georgian Bluffs\n\nMunicipality of Grey Highlands\n\nTownship of Southgate\n\nMunicipality of West Grey\n\nHaliburton\n\nTownship of Algonquin Highlands\n\nMunicipality of Dysart et al\n\nMunicipality of Highlands East\n\nTownship of Minden Hills\n\nHastings\n\nCity of Belleville (Separated)*\n\nCity of Quinte West (Separated)*\n\nMunicipality of Centre Hastings\n\nMunicipality of Hastings Highlands\n\nMunicipality of Marmora and Lake\n\nMunicipality of Tweed\n\nTown of Bancroft\n\nTown of Deseronto\n\nTownship of Carlow/Mayo\n\nTownship of Faraday\n\nTownship of Limerick\n\nTownship of Madoc\n\nTownship of Stirling-Rawdon\n\nTownship of Tudor & Cashel\n\nTownship of Tyendinaga\n\nTownship of Wollaston\n\nHuron\n\nMunicipality of Bluewater\n\nMunicipality of Central Huron\n\nMunicipality of Huron East\n\nMunicipality of Morris-Turnberry\n\nMunicipality of South Huron\n\nTown of Goderich\n\nTownship of Ashfield-Colborne-Wawanosh\n\nTownship of Howick\n\nTownship of North Huron\n\nLambton\n\nCity of Sarnia\n\nMunicipality of Lambton Shores\n\nTown of Petrolia\n\nMunicipality of Brooke-Alvinston\n\nTownship of Dawn-Euphemia\n\nTownship of Enniskillen\n\nTown of Plympton-Wyoming\n\nTownship of St. Clair\n\nTownship of Warwick\n\nVillage of Oil Springs\n\nVillage of Point Edward\n\nLanark\n\nSeparated Town of Smiths Falls (Separated)*\n\nMunicipality of Mississippi Mills\n\nTown of Carleton Place\n\nTown of Perth\n\nTownship of Beckwith\n\nTownship of Drummond-North Elmsley\n\nTownship of Lanark Highlands\n\nTownship of Montague\n\nTownship of Tay Valley\n\nLeeds & Grenville\n\nCity of Brockville (Separated)*\n\nMunicipality of North Grenville\n\nTown of Gananoque (Separated)*\n\nTown of Prescott (Separated)*\n\nTownship of Athens\n\nTownship of Augusta\n\nTownship of Edwardsburgh/Cardinal\n\nTownship of Elizabethtown -

They include separated municipalities that are geographically located within a county (see County list) but are not part of the county for the municipal purposes. Single-tier municipalities also include all northern municipalities (see Northern list) where there is no upper-tier governance at the District level. Finally, single-tier municipalities include those former county or regional municipalities that have been amalgamated into single-tier municipality. Single-tier municipalities have responsibilities for all local services to their residents.|\n\nCounty of Brant (Status: City)\n\nCity of Brantford (Status: City)\n\nCity of Chatham-Kent (Status: City, formerly County of Kent)\n\nCity of Greater Sudbury (Status: City)\n\nHaldimand County ( Status: City)\n\nCity of Hamilton (Status: City)\n\nCity of Kawartha Lakes (Status:City, formerly County of Victoria)\n\nNorfolk County (Status: City)\n\nCity of Ottawa (Status: City)\n\nPrince Edward County (Status: City)\n\nCity of Toronto (Status: City)"
