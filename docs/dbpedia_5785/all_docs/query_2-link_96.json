We understand the immense planning and preparation that our students go through prior to their arrival at their new host family’s home. With that in mind, it is our goal to help make their transition to Canada and Canadian lifestyle as easy and exciting as possible.\n\nFor over 15 years, Hospitalité Canada has worked closely with local school districts and private schools by successfully accommodating thousands of young students, from over 25 countries, with carefully selected host families.
