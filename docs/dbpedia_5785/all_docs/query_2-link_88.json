        "text": "CHURCH HISTORY & CHURCH LIFE\n\nThe church life in St. Catharines began in the late 1970s when three couples and their children migrated from Toronto to join five local couples who had a desire for the church life. Eventually the church was established in 1980. In the early years, brothers from the church in Toronto would come weekly to have ministry meetings to impart vision to the saints and to nourish them. These meetings provided a good foundation for the church life there. Some were also burdened for Brock University, located in the area. There is a weekly Saturday meeting for young people and college saints where they would come for the love feast and would enjoy the Lord together. On Lord’s Day, saints would gather for the Lord’s table and prophesying meetings followed by a corporate lunch afterwards.\n\nCITY OVERVIEW\n\nSt. Catharines is the largest city in Canada’s Niagara Region and the sixth largest urban area in Ontario, with 96.11 square kilometres of land.\n\nSource: Wikipedia\n\nArea: 96.11 km² 1\n\nPopulation: 131,400 (2011) 1\n\nProvince: Ontario\n\nCity Info: Official City Website\n\n1.
