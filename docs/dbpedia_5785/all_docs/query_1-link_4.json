        "text": "Start by joining up with The Bruce Trail, Canada’s oldest and longest footpath. On the way through St. Catharines and Thorold, you’ll trek past all four of the Welland Canal Locks. Perch yourself atop a viewing platform and watch in awe as ships navigate these world-famous feats of engineering.\n\nOr, head straight for the lake and get to know Port Dalhousie, at historic Lakeside Park. Make sure to bring the kids and grandparents, because both will want to ride the 111-year-old carved wooden carousel, especially at 5 cents a ride.\n\nWhen you’re ready for a different pace, set your shopping compass to downtown St. Catharines, and visit its trend-setting shops, pubs, and restaurants.\n\nExplore the region’s Black history at the BME Church of Salem Chapel National Historic Site and the permanent exhibit at the St. Catharine’s Museum to learn more about the role Niagara played in the abolitionist movement as part of the Underground Railroad.\n\nBetween watching ships sail by and exploring the diverse urban and wooded trails, there’s a relaxed pace of life to this region that will make you want to slow down, breathe in, and stay awhile."
