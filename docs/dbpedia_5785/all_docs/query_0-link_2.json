        "text": "Home to a handful of wineries, St. Catharines vines produce vintages proven to stand proudly alongside some of the world’s top wines and are definitely worth a visit while travelling along Niagara’s Wine Route.\n\nExplore each winery’s unique story with behind-the-scenes tours and samples of rare reserves or small batch specialties - usually only available at the wineries themselves. Complete the experience by taking your taste buds on a culinary adventure and indulge at the winery restaurants, feasting on farm-to-table cuisine and seasonally inspired menus.\n\nSt. Catharines is also at the core of the Niagara Grape and Wine Festival – Canada’s largest wine festival and street parade. Downtown's historic Montebello Park comes alive for two weekends with wine and food events, live entertainment and exciting activities throughout the day.\n\nHaving recently undergone massive economic development, downtown St. Catharines is busting at the seams with an eclectic mix of shops, cafes, bistros, boutiques, restaurants, breweries and pubs.\n\nFrom renowned vegan doughnut shops to imaginative farm-to-table joints and corner bistros with seasonally adapted menus, you will not be disappointed dining downtown. Pair this with quaint boutiques, artisanal shops and Niagara breweries, and watch your day disappear wandering through the area.\n\nA culture and arts hub, downtown St. Catharines is home to Brock University’s Marilyn I. Walker School of Fine and Performing Arts, the FirstOntario Performing Arts Centre, which in itself boasts four theatres and the Meridian Centre, a 5,300 seat sports and entertainment facility that hosts everything from charity galas and Junior A hockey games to Elton John concerts.\n\nThe largest city in the Niagara Region, St. Catharines is also known as ‘The Garden City’ for its lush greenery, vast hiking trails and picturesque parks.\n\nWith the Niagara Escarpment running right through the city, there is no shortage of outdoor beauty. Part of this can be seen on a hike through Decew Falls, a winding path on the Bruce Trail that leads through narrow creeks and a 22 metre waterfall.\n\nAs part of the Greater Niagara Circle Route, St. Catharines boasts a paved trail system along the Welland Canal, offering a beautiful setting for a stroll, invigorating run, bike ride, or rollerblade.\n\nEnjoy a sandy beach and harbour front surroundings in St. Catharines’ north end, known as Port Dalhousie. Historic Lakeside Park offers plenty of summer fun with its classic carousel - still only 5 cents a ride, picnic perfect spots, and plethora of events happening throughout the warmer months.\n\nThe St. Catharines Museum and Welland Canals Centre at Lock 3 is the most popular place to view ships from all corners of the world as they maneuver through the lock system. Observe these giants from the observation deck or the 2nd floor Interactive Centre, which provides a multi-media journey of the historical canal."
