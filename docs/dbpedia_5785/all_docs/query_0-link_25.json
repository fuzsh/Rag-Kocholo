If you’re considering real estate in the area don’t hesitate to reach out to one of our experienced associates to help you along your real estate journey.\n\nThe History of St. Catharines, Ontario\n\nBefore growing into the modern metropolis it is today, St. Catharines had humble beginnings as a small settlement of about 3,000 Loyalists in the late 1700’s. Due to the political situation at the time, people from around North America who were loyal to the Crown during the American Revolution sought a peaceful settlement where they could pursue their lives free of ideological persecution. For 3,000 people, that place was St. Catharines.\n\nHere the Loyalists could peacefully work the land, cultivating the region’s fertile soils while taking advantage of the many waterways for Mill’s and transportation. These natural features made the site an attractive place to call home. At the turn of the century St. Catharines was growing as an agricultural centre, with a small service industry emerging to cater to travelers along the Indigenous trails along the Niagara Escarpment.\n\nLater Development and Growth in St. Catharines\n\nBefore taking on the name it has today, St. Catharines was referred to as Shipman’s Corners after the owner of a prominent stagecoach transfer point. Despite the destruction brought on throughout much of the Niagara Region, Shipman’s Corners was spared thanks to its inland location.\n\nThe settlement’s natural advantages brought more prosperity as mills and the lumber industry made use of the area’s waterways, including Twelve Mile Creek. Yet the waterways were also used for another purpose. Salt springs along the river gave early St. Catharines a reputation as a health retreat.\n\nFrom Settlement to the Village of St. Catharines\n\nWhile the definite origin of the name St. Catharines isn’t certain, the village took this name around 1800. It’s thought that the name comes from the wife of a prominent local businessman. Regardless of the origin of its name, St. Catharines continued to prosper into the 19th century.\n\nAfter the completion of the Erie Canal, a plan was devised to created a canal between Lake Erie and Lake Ontario to lessen the dependence on waterways controlled by the United States. Once completed, the Welland Canal continued to drive the village’s growth and St. Catharines became indispensable.\n\nFollowing its incorporation as a town in 1845, St. Catharines was connected to Hamilton and Port Colborne by rail. The canal was replaced and expanded, further cementing the town’s strategic and economic importance.\n\nAround the same time, residents took a renewed interest in agriculture and began using the land for fruit cultivation, a sign of what was to come with the Niagara Region’s reputation for wineries, vineyards, and orchards.\n\nHarriet Tubman famously used St. Catharines as her home base for many years throughout the 50’s. Freedom seekers formed much of the local workforce, enjoying their prosperity and paving the way for generations to come. Today, several local churches are designed national historic sites. Visitors from around North America come to visit the site where famous abolitionists like Frederick Douglass once stood.\n\nThe Modern St. Catharines\n\nFurther infrastructure development in the latter half of the 1800’s attracted more residents. The town limits grew, and rural land began to be used for residential and commercial purposes. A slight slump in population occurred, mostly due to the relocation of shipyards and mills. Manufacturing took their place, especially in the 1900’s following the development of hydroelectric plants in the area.\n\nContinued industrialization in the 20th century was responsible for future growth, and the postwar years introduced a shift towards suburban living and an improvement in quality of life. Several outlying towns were incorporated into St. Catharines by 1970’s, transforming it into the modern metropolis it is today.\n\nJobs and The Economy in St. Catharines, Ontario\n\nWhile industry and agriculture historically drove growth and development in St. Catharines, there’s been a considerable shift towards tourism and hospitality in the 21st century.
