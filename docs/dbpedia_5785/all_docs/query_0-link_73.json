        "text": "Most people can easily locate the world-famous Niagara Falls on the map, but that isn’t the only way to find us. Niagara Canada is ideally located within Southern Ontario’s Golden Horseshoe between Toronto and the US border.\n\nNiagara Canada is not just the Falls – it is actually a region made up of many communities, including medium-sized cities, small towns and hamlets.\n\nThe 12 local municipalities in Niagara include Fort Erie, Pelham, Grimsby, Lincoln, Niagara Falls, Niagara-on-the-Lake, Port Colborne, St. Catharines, Thorold, Wainfleet, Welland and West Lincoln\n\nThe region encompasses a total area of 1,852 km² with a total population of 496,059\n\nThe region has three urban centres, St. Catharines, Niagara Falls and Welland\n\nLandmark natural features include Lake Ontario, Lake Erie and the Niagara Escarpment\n\nThe region is part of a growing area of almost 2 million people within a 30-minute drive\n\nNiagara is approximately 120 km away by car or transit to Toronto, Canada’s largest city. Take in a beautiful drive or sit back and relax on the Niagara Seasonal GO Train Service with daily service to and from Toronto arriving in 2021\n\nThere are 5 international border crossings into the United States as well as 7 airports within a one hour drive that provide easy access from Niagara Canada to anywhere in the world\n\nNiagara’s unique geography creates a microclimate that yields some of the best weather in Canada. The air is clean and the sun can shine brightly in all four distinct seasons.\n\nMarch to June is spring, when temperatures range from 5C to 20C (41F to 68F) and people wear light jackets or no jacket at all. Plants and trees blossom in our many green spaces. In summer, from June to September, temperatures range from 15C to over 30C (59F to 86F) and high humidity is common. People wear light clothing when the temperatures soar.\n\nIn the fall, September to December, many trees lose their leaves and fall colours are at their best. Temperatures are a low of 0C to a high of 15C, or 32F to 59F, calling for light or medium jackets and long pants. December through March, the area experiences regular snowfalls with heavy snowfall possible during wintertime. Temperatures can be as low as -20C up to 0C (-4F to 32F)."
