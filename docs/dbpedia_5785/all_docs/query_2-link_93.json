So, before diving in, let’s review all that is involved in our annual budget process.\n\nWatch this short video on how the budget works:\n\nCapital vs. Operating\n\nThere are two primary budgets prepared by staff and voted on by Council: the Capital and Operating Budgets.\n\nCapital Budget:\n\nThis budget pertains to large-scale investments in tangible amenities, facilities and infrastructure. Funding for the Capital Budget is drawn in part from tax revenues, alongside money drawn from reserves, debentures and other funding sources such as grants from federal and provincial governments.\n\nExamples of Capital Budget items:\n\nRoad resurfacing and replacement\n\nNew buildings\n\nMajor upgrades or renewal of facilities\n\nConstruction of parks and amenities\n\nOperating Budget:\n\nThe Operating Budget covers the day-to-day operations of the City, things like staff salaries, materials for repairs, electricity to keep the lights on, programs and more. This budget is primarily funded by the City’s portion of municipal property tax bills and revenues collected through City services and programs. It is the operating budget, as approved by Council, that sets the City tax rate.\n\nExamples of operating budget items:\n\nSalaries and bene\n\nRecreation programs\n\nFacility maintenance\n\nAdministrative services\n\nUtilities and materials\n\nRate Supported Budgets:\n\nThere are two rather unique budgets separate from the operating and capital budgets. These are parking and water / wastewater. Both budgets, including their operating and capital costs, are covered directly by revenues generated through their related services.\n\nIn the Parking Budget, infrastructure and operations for paid parking are financed by the rates collected through paid parking and parking tickets.\n\nThe Water / Wastewater Budget funds the City’s water delivery and wastewater (sewer) systems through revenues generated by water / wastewater bills.\n\nService Levels and Asset Management\n\nThe City does regular reviews of service levels and asset management to utilize City resources efficiently.\n\nTaxes: A Three-Way Split\n\nProperty taxes as a whole are made up of three individual pieces: the City portion, the Region portion, and the Province’s education portion.\n\nThe City portion, which pays for City of St. Catharines operations, services and assets, is dependent on the amount approved by Council in the operating budget. The more spent on the operating budget the higher the City portion of the finalized tax rate.\n\nThe Region portion pays for Niagara Region operations, services and assets such as Public Health, waste management, police, regional roads, and the new Niagara Region Transit System. The Region’s tax rate is dependent on the budgetary deliberations of Regional Council.\n\nThe education portion is set and administered by the Province of Ontario, and helps to pay for public education.\n\nMPAC Property Assessment\n\nThe Municipal Property Assessment Corporation (MPAC) collects data about properties across Ontario and is responsible for annual property assessments.\n\nThe following video explains how the assessment works:\n\nFor more information on property assessment, including how various properties are assessed, current calculations, and other FAQ, visit: Municipal Sector Resources | MPAC\n\nThe Finalized Rate:\n\nOnce all three levels of government have set their rates, they are combined into one finalized rate. That rate is then calculated against the assessed value of a home or property to generate a total of taxes owed on the property for the year.\n\nOnce the amount owed has been calculated, the City of St. Catharines administers billings and collections for all properties within its borders. Taxes are collected by the City and then divided between the City, Region and Province.\n\nFor more information on taxes, including information on where taxes go, and how they are calculated, visit stcatharines.ca/Taxes.\n\nThe City has officially adopted its 2024 to 2026 multi-year operating, rate (water and wastewater, parking) and capital budgets as of February 2, 2024.\n\nCity council approved a multi-year budget policy in 2022 that will see a focus on a three-year budget cycle rather than a one-year cycle.
