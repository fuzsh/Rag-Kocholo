The fourth canal (current) was built in between 1913 - 1932, and stretched twenty-six (26) miles from Lake Erie at Port Colborne to Lake Ontario at St. Catharines.\n\nMost Cities in Niagara were built along the canal such as was the case in the City of Welland.\n\nThe Welland portion of the canal until 1973, passed through the center core of the City. Its winding course made navigation difficult and three lift bridges across the canal made for many traffic jams & overheated tempers.\n\nIn 1967, in order to straighten the navigation channel, the St. Lawrence Seaway Authority began construction of the New Canal Bypass. This Bypass was cut from expropriated lands near the Eastern border of the city limits. It was 8.3 miles long, 350 feet wide at the bottom and 30 feet deep. In order to speed vehicle and rail traffic, two tunnels were built under the new bypass. The tunnels are located on Main Street (vehicular traffic) and Townline Road (rail & vehicle traffic).\n\nIn 1973 the New Welland Canal Bypass was officially opened for ship traffic.The old portion of the canal in the downtown core was closed.
