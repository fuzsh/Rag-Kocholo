        "text": "St. Catharines is the largest city in the Ontario’s Niagara region. It’s known as the “Garden City” due to its 1,000 acres of parks, gardens, and trails. The surrounding area is known for its orchards and vineyards. There are two ‘sections’ for running in St. Catharines: the downtown area, which is 5 km inland from Lake Ontario, and the waterfront, stretching from Port Dalhousie to Port Weller.\n\nIn central St. Catharines, there’s some nice running along the Merritt Trail and the Twelve Creek Trails. Just south, there’s fairly easy trail running in the area around Brock University, using the Bruce Trail to connect to Glenridge Quarry and Lake Moodie. Trail runners will enjoy Short Hills Provincial Park and Ball’s Falls. Some of the best places to run in St. Catharines are in the area around Lake Ontario. A highlight is the several km of Waterfront Trail along the lake and the Harbour Walkway Trail in the Port Dalhousie area. Just east of there, in the Weller Port area, there’s another section of the Waterfront Trail, a paved multi-use path along the Welland Canal, and the George Nicholson Memorial Trail out to McIntyre Bay. We’ve also included three routes in Niagara-on-the-Lake, which is 15 km east of St. Catharines.\n\nA linear park type trail that runs for 8.5 km along Twelve Mile Creek, downtown St. Catharines, and then Centennial Gardens. The nicest section of this paved/gravel path is the 3.5 km in the Canal Valley, with another 1-2 km possible in Clifford’s Creek Park.\n\nPleasant gravel trails head south from along Twelve Creek for ~5 km. The Twelve Trail is on the east side, ending at Brock University, and the Participark Trail is on the west side. Loop option using the pedestrian bridge at the halfway point.\n\nSome very nice running in southern St. Catharines. Explore the park-like campus of Brock University, then use the Bruce Trail for an easy trail run around Glenridge Quarry, and/or a run around Lake Moodie for up to 6 km to Decew Falls.\n\nPiers, parks, marinas, and Lake Ontario all in one run! In the Port Dalhousie neighborhood, enjoy the Harbour Walkway Trail to Royal Henley Park and Lockhart Point, then the Waterfront Trail around the Marina and along Lake Ontario.\n\nOur favorite area to run in St. Catharines, with several attractive waterfront paths: the Waterfront Trail along Lake Ontario, the Welland Canal Trail, and the George Nicholson Memorial Trail out to MacIntyre Bay. Options to mix & match!\n\nOn the east side of the Welland Canal, the George Nicholson Memorial Trail is a scenic, wide dirt path that runs along Port Weller Harbour out to MacIntyre Bay. There are fantastic water views, especially at the tip, where the Welland Canal meets Lake Ontario.\n\nPretty town on Lake Ontario known for the Shaw summer theater festival, wineries, historic homes and sites. We've designed a 10.7 km 'grand tour', including a 4 km loop of Fort George, flower-filled Queen St., lakeshore, and Historic Old Town.\n\nPaved multi-use path that runs for nearly 20 km along the Niagara River between Niagara-on-the-Lake and Niagara Falls. Highlights include some lovely riverfront sections, Queenston Heights Park, Floral Clock, Niagara Botanical Gardens.\n\nA series of long, flat, open roads between Rt. 55 and the Niagara Parkway passing by wineries and farmland. These roads have relatively little traffic and are a pleasure for running on open terrain. Each of Line 1, Line 2, or Line 3 roads is 4-5 km."
