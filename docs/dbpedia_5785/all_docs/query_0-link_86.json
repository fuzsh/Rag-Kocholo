        "text": "Being on the water with my friends and coaches is something I look forward to every day. The staff and facilities that Ridley offers help me perform at my best and give me the tools necessary to compete after post-secondary and at the national level.\n\nAn Athletic Powerhouse For More Than A Century\n\nOur athletic stature combined with our robust educational experience are some of the primary reasons student-athletes seek out Ridley College—they know their academic, athletic and personal goals will be equally supported. We approach sport holistically, balancing a winning combination of learning, training, competing, and flourishing. And it pays off: over the past decade, many of our fiercest athletes have been named to national team rosters and recruited by top universities.\n\nHi, I’m Nandita, a boarding student from Saudi Arabia. Ridley is best described as a home away from home. I’ve created meaningful relationships in Mandeville with my housemates, my Head of House, Assistant Head of House and Residential Don. Their actions show that being part of Ridley and their boarding program means that you’ll always be part of a trustworthy and supportive community.\n\nYour Home Away From Home\n\nOur boarding programme provides students with an 'all-in-one' experience in a nurturing environment that helps them to flourish—now and into the future. With students coming from more than 60 countries, your child will belong to a diverse community, gaining a global perspective, forging lifelong connections, acquiring independence, and deepening their character strengths.\n\nMy name is Eloise, and I am in Grade 2. I love Ridley because of my teachers and because I get to do my favourite things like art, French and music. I really like going to the clay studio to practice my creativity. I also love to paint. In art, I feel happy, excited and ready to have fun. Since I started in Junior Kindergarten, I have learned to be kind, fair and helpful. I love to go to school each day because I get to see my friends and my teachers, who make me feel happy.\n\nFrom Inquisitive Thinkers to Lifelong Learners\n\nThe only IB Continuum school of its kind in Canada, at Ridley, students can graduate with three diplomas: IB, OSSD and the Ridley Diploma. Each one is a ticket to the world and whatever post-secondary pursuits they desire. Supported by outstanding faculty and mentors, your child will gain a thirst for knowledge that will remain with them throughout their lives.\n\nIn the past eight years, right from Grade 1, I have always felt at home in the Mandeville Theatre. From Christmas musicals in the primary grades to larger productions more recently, I am grateful for the support that the drama programme offers. I love that we are encouraged to find joy on stage and that the experience is always unique.\n\nBe Consumed in Service\n\nFor more than a century, generations of Ridleians have been inspired to give back; our school motto, Terar Dum Prosim, or “May I Be Consumed in Service,” is truly at the heart of what we do—there isn’t a time of year when students across all grades aren’t engaged in service learning. We instill the values of contributing positively to others and communities which, in turn, intrinsically fulfills and helps our students and graduates to flourish.\n\nHello, my name is Jerry. I am an international student from Beijing, and I started at Ridley in Grade 7. Music has always been one of my biggest passions. I play clarinet in Ridley’s Symphony Orchestra and Cadet Band and saxophone in Ridley’s Jazz Band. I grew a lot as a musician thanks to the great music programmes at Ridley, which provided a lot of great opportunities and allows everyone to enjoy the power of music.\n\nCreate, Inspire, Explore\n\nAt Ridley, we believe that students at all stages in their development can gain meaning, purpose and insight through involvement in the arts. We offer a wide range of programming—such as visual, digital, performing, and speaking arts, as well as music—delivered by specialist teachers. Beginning in Kindergarten and continuing to graduation, your child will be encouraged to play, create, express, and explore."
