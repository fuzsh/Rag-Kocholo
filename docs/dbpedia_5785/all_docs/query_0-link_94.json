        "text": "Chances are you’ve heard of the wonderful things to do in Niagara-on-the-Lake – including the wineries and world-class theatre – and know that just a short drive away is one of the wonders of the world, Niagara Falls. If you have driven to either destination, you have driven right by the next city in our Travelling Canada series: St. Catharines. Although often overshadowed by the offerings of its neighbours, St. Catharines is an exciting destination in its own right. Here are our top picks for what to do in St. Catharines.\n\nVisit the Wineries\n\nAlthough Niagara-on-the-Lake is often in the spotlight as a wine destination, St. Catharines and neighboring towns of Jordan and Beamsville, are also part of Ontario’s Wine Country. Leave the main roads for a trip to gems like Hernder Estate Wines and Henry of Pelham. Be sure to arrive hungry; the Coach House Cafe at Henry of Pelham features food and wine pairings.\n\nHike the Bruce Trail\n\nThe Bruce Trail follows the Niagara escarpment for almost 900km, 20km of which are located in St. Catharines. A public footpath, and a world-class hiking trail, catching any part of the Bruce Trail is an opportunity to experience the raw beauty of Niagara, including waterfalls and streams. Of particular note along the way is Morningstar Mill and Short Hills Provincial Park. There are many more opportunities to hike in St. Catharines – learn more here.\n\nLearn more about the Bruce Trail.\n\nHave Lunch at Harvest Barn\n\nAlthough St. Catharines boasts many wonderful restaurants, sometimes you just need a light lunch and nothing hits the spot quite like build-your-own-salad. Known to those who live in the region as a delightful place to buy fresh and usually local produce, Harvest Barn also has a delicious salad bar perfect for a casual lunch. Harvest Barn has two locations – in St. Catharines and one in Niagara-on-the-Lake\n\nLearn more.\n\nCool Off at Pearson Park Splash Pad\n\nThe kids will love a stop at this large splash pad in St. Catharines – it’s a perfect way to cool off in the heat. The splash pad is located inside a huge piece of greenspace, Pearson Park. Make a day of it and pack a picnic!\n\nLearn more.\n\nRelax in Port Dalhousie\n\nHead to the beach in historic Port Dalhousie, a part of St. Catharines that features Lakeside Park on the shores of Lake Ontario, a marina and the famous Lakeside Park Carousel. Step back in time when you watch the kids ride the carousel, which has been in this location since 1921. Rides are just a nickel!\n\nAfter your ride, walk to the beach to dip your toes in or admire the boats.\n\nLearn more.\n\nTo learn more about things to do in St. Catharines (there’s more than just what’s on our list), visit the Tourism St. Catharines website. http://www.tourismstcatharines.ca/\n\nTake a look at the other cities we’ve featured in our Travelling Canada virtual tour series:\n\nCentral Ontario"
