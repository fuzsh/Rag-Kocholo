It already has a positive net economic benefit on the area. It will provide entertainment, recreation and business opportunities for people in the area, contributing to the future economic health, quality of life, and overall vitality of the surrounding municipalities.\n\nThere have been a number of key improvements to the airport over the years, and the Commission looks to the future with optimism, steering Niagara District towards becoming the aviation Gateway to Niagara and a vital part of the Region's economy.\n\nUnder the Infrastructure Stimulus Fund (ISF) the NDA Airport has a total of 11.6 million dollars of improvements since 2010 including:\n\nRunway 06/24 rehabilitation\n\nNew parallel Taxiway \"C\"\n\nApron extension\n\nAirfield lighting - DCLED\n\nNew terminal\n\nNew domestic water system\n\nAdditional parking lot\n\nImproved groundside lighting\n\nNew road to SW Aviation area (Hanger Line Road)\n\nPerimeter fence with access controlled gates\n\nOfficially opened on September 13, 1929 on the eastern edge of the City of St. Catharines (adjacent to the Welland Canal), the Niagara District Airport was relocated 3 miles northeast in 1935 to its present location. From the beginning, the St. Catharines Flying Club was intimately involved in the activities on the field and remains so to this day.\n\nWith the outbreak of World War II, the airport was deeded to the Federal Government and under the soon-to-be-formed British Commonwealth Air Training Plan, the Number 9 Elementary Flight Training School was established in the Fall of 1940.\n\nSome 1,848 pilots graduated under this plan, which was terminated on January 15, 1944. The airport then became the home to the Number 4 Wireless Training Unit of the Royal Canadian Air Force, and operated in this capacity until August 15, 1945.\n\nNumber 9 EFTS produced many pilots who contributed immensely to the war effort, but perhaps none more so than John Gillespie Magee, the author of the immortal poem entitled High Flight.\n\nFollowing the War, the city of St. Catharines regained possession of the airport land under a long-term lease of $1 per year.\n\nIn 1959, the Niagara District Airport Commission was formed, comprised of members from four financially supporting municipalities with a mandate to oversee the maintenance and operation of the airport.\n\nIn 2013, a new Municipal Agreement was formed and Niagara District Airport Commission is comprised of members from three financially supporting municipalities.\n\nServing the Niagara Business Community\n\nThe Niagara District Airport is a great resource for Niagara Region firms. Large corporations frequently inform region authorities that the presence of Niagara District Airport is an essential part of their decision to remain or locate in Niagara.\n\nFrom shipping products to providing landing facilities for corporate aircraft, the airport supplies a much needed transportation facility.\n\nOur 5,000-foot runway can land large corporate aircraft, and many major companies in the area depend on this capability for time-critical movement of both people and goods.\n\nFor Dispatch Managers we provide 24-hour customs clearance 365 days each year.\n\nNeed Land to Start or Expand a Business?\n\nNiagara District Airport offers access to major highways into the United States and across Canada, and is placed right in the centre of the largest market in the continent.\n\nThe Niagara District Airport offers big city amenities and a small-town atmosphere. The Niagara Peninsula has a trained and experienced workforce and enjoys an attractive climate.\n\nThe airport encompasses an area of 130 hectares (321 acres) in which several areas have been designated for airside and groundside development.\n\nAirside Commercial Development\n\nThe Airport is currently planning for future development. If you have a business opportunity or would like a private hangar located at the Niagara District Airport, please bring it to the attention of the Airport CEO, so it can be discussed in our future planning.\n\nWe have 5.3 hectares (12 acres) of airside land available that is adjacent to and has direct access to the operational side of the airport, i.e. aircraft can access business premises or businesses operating from hangars. Any aviation business that needs to be sited on an airport, or would benefit from location in an established Business Air Park with eight aviation businesses on-site would be welcome.\n\nWe are particularly interested in attracting the following:\n\nAvionics shop\n\nAircraft exterior paint shop\n\nAircraft interior re-furbishing\n\nThis would also make an ideal location for an ultralight manufacturer.\n\nGroundside Development\n\nWe also have 0.6 hectares (1.5 acres) of land that is adjacent to the field, but does not offer direct access to the operational side of the airport. This land would be of interest to light commercial businesses requiring proximity to one of the surrounding municipalities.\n\nThe airport is zoned by the Town of Niagara-on-the-Lake as \"aviation related\". Suitable groundside uses would include; aviation related commercial, industrial, manufacturing and assembly and recreational facilities.\n\nLarger Development Areas\n\nThere are two additional land development opportunities surrounding the field, both of which offer direct access. One area encompasses 8.9 hectares (22.0 acres) on the north side of the field. The other consists of 7.8 hectares (19.4 acres) in the extreme south-west of the airport site.\n\nAll land is available on a term lease basis, and rates are competitively structured.\n\nLocating in the Niagara Region\n\nLocating a business in the Niagara region offers several advantages:\n\nNiagara is an ideal North American location for aerospace firms\n\nWe are at the centre of the largest economic region in North America\n\nEasy access to US markets\n\nThe region boasts the balmiest climate in Ontario and has a wonderful and unique lifestyle\n\nThere is a an educated workforce (including French-speaking)\n\nThere is financial assistance available to help companies in relocation\n\nThe Niagara Economic Development Corporation offers a variety of services\n\nVenture Niagara can provide lending for initial business start-up requirements\n\nCompetitive Rates\n\nAll land is available on a land lease basis, at a cost that is very competitive for this part of the peninsula.\n\nTo discuss potential land use, and find out whether our airport location meets your needs, please contact:\n\nDaniel Pilon\n\nChief Executive Officer\n\nTel 905 684 7447 ext.103"
