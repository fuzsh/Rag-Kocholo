Be aware of the deadlines!\n\nHave in mind that, usually, universities save about 5% of their vacancies for international students, so the competition for entering can get hard. Read closely every step of the procedure your chosen institution asks for in their websites, and don’t miss the chance! If you have doubts, try to contact the student secretary office.\n\nDo I need a student visa or NIE?\n\nPlease, take into consideration that if you live in Schengen area (EU, EEA and Swiss nationals) you do not need a visa to study in Valencia, but you need to register for the NIE.\n\nNon-EU citizens must apply for the Spanish student visa at the nearest Spanish Embassy or Consulate (or from Spain if you’re already there). Please mind that you already can get the visa before starting your studies at the university. For example, when you start a full-time Spanish course of 20 lessons per week or more, or one of the Spanish University Pathway courses. If you study Spanish for 6 months or 1 year you can renew your Spanish student visa in Spain to continue with your studies at the University.\n\nHow much does it cost to study in Valencia?\n\nThere is no doubt Spain is one of the most affordable countries in Europe, and Valencia, while still a big city, is much less expensive than Barcelona or Madrid.\n\nPublic universities\n\nThe cost of studying at public universities in Valencia is decided every year by the Valencian government. Usually, tuition fees range between €720-1,800 per year.\n\nThe total cost of tuition is calculated on a pay-per-credit basis across Spain.

An academic year usually has 60 ECTS credits, and the cost of credits can range between €12-30 per credit for every first enrollment.\n\nHave in mind that students from inside the EU will pay the same tuition fees as Spanish students, but the ones from outside the EU -and those who are repeating a subject- will have to pay more.\n\nPrivate Universities\n\nEvery private university in Valencia will set its own fee depending on the course you take and the institution you choose, but tuition fees for private university degree programs can range from €5,000 to 18,000.\n\n–> Do you think the university application procedure is complicated?
