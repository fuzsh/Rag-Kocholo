It is also host to the Valencian Academy of Surgery and can be found next to the Valencian Museum of Enlightenment and Modernity.\n\nThe city-based environment allows students to experience this lively city on the Mediterranean coast, which welcomes over 4 million tourists every year.\n\nStudents are also drawn by the excellent facilities, small class sizes and personalised mentoring, with a focus on personal growth. It has an excellent reputation for scholarships and bursaries, allocating €5.4 million each year to different aid programmes and works to provide financially for students who are part of a large family."
