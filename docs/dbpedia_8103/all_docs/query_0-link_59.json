        "text": "Our university, founded over five centuries ago by the Juries of Valencia, has become a modern, public university that teaches all areas of knowledge: social, economic and legal sciences, experimental sciences, engineering, health sciences, educational sciences and humanities.\n\nMore than 45,800 undergraduate students and 8,600 postgraduate students take classes taught by more than 3,300 professors, lectures and researchers at our campuses (Blasco Ibáñez, Burjassot-Paterna and Tarongers) with the support of over 1,700 administration and service staff.\n\nOn this website you can find all the information about our university: its facilities, centres, departments, research institutes and services. You can also learn about all the activities that the University undertakes: teaching, research, creation and dissemination of culture, knowledge transfer to the public and private sector, international cooperation and solidarity.\n\nThis community is committed to remain a reference within the university framework ─ we are ranked second in Europe in receiving Erasmus students and fourth among Spanish universities in the research field. According to the most prestigious international rankings, we are ranked fourth in Spain.\n\nWe hope we can count on you in our ongoing effort to make a better, fairer and more developed society. A society that is more sustainable and advanced, which encourages equality among men and women and provides a higher life quality for citizens.\n\nThe mission of the Universitat de València clearly sets out the raison d’être of the institution, according to the legal and statutory framework. The strategic planning process undertaken to define the Strategic Plan of the Universitat de València 2008-2011 resulted in the definition of the University’s mission.\n\nWe understand that this statement remains fully active, although their achievement will require different objectives and lines of action that focus on new challenges and circumstances.\n\n“The Universitat de València’s mission is to train competent professionals at European level and encourage prestigious research with international impact contributing to the development of our society. Training and research promote UV’s tasks in the field of dissemination of science and culture, and in the reaffirmation of the democratic values of the society in general, and the Valencian society in particular.”\n\nThe University of Valencia of today is the outcome of more than five centuries of history that have led to the accumulation of knowledge and unique documentary treasures, making it one of the top Spanish universities.\n\nIn the thirteenth century, higher education was established in the city of Valencia thanks to King James I of Aragon who had obtained a Studium Generale institution from Pope Innocent IV in 1245. However, it was not until 30 October 1499 that the Juries of Valencia drew up the Constitutions of what was about to become the first University of Valencia: a university authorised by the Papal Bull on 23 January 1501, signed by the Valencian Pope Alexander VI and by the royal privilege of Ferdinand II the Catholic. It was granted on 16 February 1502.\n\nFor more than 500 years, the development of the University of Valencia has run in parallel with the development of the city and has been an inextricable part of its urban fabric, creating spaces for teaching, research, creation and dissemination of culture and science as well as knowledge transfer.\n\nInitially dedicated to the studies of medicine, humanities, theology and law, the university has witnessed over the past two decades an accelerated process of transformation and growth, something incomparable to earlier periods. This significant effort has turned the University of Valencia into a modern, global university. It has become a leader when it comes to the application of new technologies, connected to important international scientific and teaching networks.\n\nThe University of Valencia has become one to the top five scientific centres in Spain thanks to its commitment to excellence and to the wide range of teaching and research activities offered in all areas of knowledge (basic sciences and engineering, health sciences, educational sciences, humanities and social sciences, economics and law).\n\nThis document, set for public exposure, shows the objectives and priorities set in the Universitat’s action plan for the period 2016‐2019. Regarding the content, the UV Strategic Plan (PEUV 2016‐2019) maintains the four-strategy plan which correspond to our Universitat’s activity fields; namely: teaching; research; campus life and participation; transference and innovation. For each of these strategies, the Institution, through a common resource base, deals with a wide and heterogeneous group of collectives and specific and differentiated needs.\n\nThese four strategies are defined in terms of general institutional objectives; for their achievement, there are a series of specific strategic objectives. The lines of the strategic acting will be defined on the latter ones, which are a set of re-grouped initiatives to achieve a specific result within this PEUV.\n\nRegarding the elaboration process, the development of the PEUV 2016‐2019 is the result of a joint process in which we have capitalised our previous experiences and acquired knowledge throughout the eight years of PEUV’s life.\n\nAt the Universitat de València strategies are thought of as vivid plans, as a journey in which the Institution tries to fulfil its objectives at the same time it explores and learns new possibilities and better ways of adding value to society.\n\nHence, after the necessary prospective studies, and with the aim of capitalising this learning; the development of this plan has counted with the participation of a wide group of members of the university community. Around 50 people have contributed to it; they were distributed into specialised working groups which have tackled the definition of the different elements which are included in the strategy and in the different fields. The conjunction of all these contributions have allowed the definition of a realistic and change-promoter strategy for the current context."
