        "text": "Top 9 universities in Spain 2024\n\nScroll down for the full list of best universities in Spain\n\nMany students are attracted to Spain for its beaches, vibrant cities, festivals and beautiful architecture.\n\nSpain shares the Iberian Peninsula with Portugal at the western end of the Mediterranean Sea. Interestingly, it is the country with the third-largest number of Unesco World Heritage Sites – after Italy and China. There is an abundance of things to do including eating at quirky restaurants, visiting the many art galleries and museums and spending time at the beach and in the countryside.\n\nSpain has 55 universities in the Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2024, with some of the most highly ranked and popular located in Madrid, Barcelona and the smaller cities of Seville and Granada. Each region of Spain is different, so students should base where they want to study not just on the university but also on the lifestyle associated with the region.\n\nOne of the reasons for Spain’s popularity with international students is that, generally, it is relatively cheap to live there. The cost of goods and services in Spain is below average in comparison with other European countries.\n\nOne of the major reasons students choose to study abroad is the opportunity to learn another language, and as Spain’s national dialect is the second most spoken language in the world it has become a popular destination for international students.\n\nWhile the majority of courses are taught in Spanish, there are also a number of courses at both undergraduate and postgraduate level in English to accommodate overseas students.\n\nBest universities in Europe\n\nBest universities in the UK\n\nBest universities in Ireland\n\nBest universities in Italy\n\nBest universities in Denmark\n\nBest universities in Scotland\n\nBest universities in Germany\n\nBest universities in the Netherlands\n\n5. Autonomous University of Madrid\n\nThe main campus of the Autonomous University of Madrid is situated in the Cantoblanco area on the outskirts of Madrid and is connected to the city centre by commuter train.\n\nFamous alumni include several former government ministers; Gaspar Llamazares, former leader of the United Left Party; and HM King Felipe VI of Spain, who graduated with a degree in law.\n\nThe university has 16 cafes and canteens, indoor and outdoor pools, a medical centre, sports pitches and beach volleyball courts, as well as a train station and bus services on campus.\n\n4. University of Navarra\n\nThe University of Navarra is a private non-profit university founded in 1952.\n\nIt initially started as a law school and now has 14 faculties, two university schools, 17 institutes, a business school and many other centres and institutions. The university offers more than 120 degrees, but all courses include aspects of theology.\n\nThe university has agreements with other institutions, including the universities of Washington, Hong Kong and Edinburgh, to encourage international exchanges between students.\n\nThe university is located in Pamplona, which is famous for the running of the bulls during the San Fermín festival.\n\n=2. Pompeu Fabra University\n\nPompeu Fabra University is still a fairly young university, having been set up in 1990 in Barcelona.\n\nThe university’s strengths lie in the social sciences, humanities, health, life sciences, communication and ICT.\n\nIt is named after the linguist Pompeu Fabra, an expert on the Catalan language, who was credited with giving the language the status it has today. Catalan is the official language of Pompeu Fabra University. Students wishing to learn Catalan will have plenty of opportunity in Barcelona and around Pompeu Fabra.\n\nThere are three campuses located across Barcelona. Social and human sciences are studied at Ciutadella, health and life sciences at Mar and communication and IT at Poblenou.\n\n2. Autonomous University of Barcelona\n\nThe main campus is located in Bellaterra, one of the main industrial and technological districts of Mediterranean Europe, and only 25 minutes from the centre of Barcelona.\n\nThe institution has 13 faculties, including biosciences, communication, arts and humanities, medicine and translation and interpreting.\n\nThe university offers 87 bachelor’s degrees, 315 master’s degrees, and 68 PhD programmes. Undergraduate degrees in business management and administration, economics, primary education and tourism are offered fully in English, and many other degrees offer subjects in English. The university attracts many international students because of this.\n\n1. University of Barcelona\n\nThe University of Barcelona is one of the biggest universities in Spain, and welcomes a large number of students from both Spain and abroad every year.\n\nThere are 73 bachelor’s degree courses, more than 140 standard master’s degree courses, more than 400 UB-specific master’s degree courses and postgraduate diplomas, and 48 doctoral programmes.\n\nTwo degree courses are taught wholly in English (international business and English studies) and five are taught partially in English.\n\nInternational perspective: an American student in Spain\n\nStudying in Spain as an international student\n\nThe 10 most beautiful universities in Europe\n\nPursuing a PhD in neuroscience at the University of Navarra\n\nTop universities in Spain 2024"
