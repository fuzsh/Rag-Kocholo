        "text": "Spain is a popular choice for foreign students seeking high quality university education at a very reasonable price. The Western European country offers many study options for Bachelors, Masters and Doctorates.\n\nIntroduction to Spain\n\nSpain is one of the most popular tourist destinations in Europe, and for good reason. Located on the Iberian peninsula and bordered by France and Portugal, Spain is a beautiful country with a long history and rich culture, known for its architecture, food and wonderful climate.\n\nThe country is composed of a number of semi-autonomous regions each with a distinct culture and sometimes even local language. In Spain, you can find any landscape from beaches to high mountains - with climates to match. There are historic and modern universities to choose from in large and small cities in every part of the country.\n\nUniversities in Spain\n\nThere are a large number of universities of Spain, many of which hold a great reputation internationally and get ranked high in international rankings. Although most universities in Spain focus on teaching in Spanish, the trend points toward more degree programmes offered in English.\n\nSome of the most notable Spanish public universities include the University of Barcelona, the Complutense University of Madrid, and Universidad Autónoma de Madrid.\n\nIf you are thinking about getting a Business degree, Spain might be the place for you: Spain is home to many great business schools, including 3 of Europe’s top 10 business schools are located in Spain: IESE Business School, IE Business School, and Esade Business School. These highly respected institutions have spawned many international top managers.\n\nCost of living and tuition fees in Spain\n\nGood news for students: Tuition fees in Spain are among the lowest in Europe. The tuition fees for Bachelor programmes range from 750 EUR to 2,500 EUR per year, and tuition fees for Master programmes are around 1,000 to 3,500 EUR per year - making Spain a cheap destination for international students. Private universities set their own fees, which can be as high as 20,000 EUR per year.\n\nThe cost of living in Spain varies by location, but in general it is easy to live well in Spain on a student budget. Food is cheap and high quality and there are many inexpensive fashionable clothing shops. However, it can be expensive to find accommodation in large cities like Madrid and Barcelona. If you are on a very tight budget you could consider cheaper cities such as Valencia or Seville. And remember, public transport in Spain is efficient and cheap, so you will be able to experience everything the country has to offer no matter where you choose to base your studies.\n\nStudent life in Spain\n\nWhile you can choose from a large number of programmes to study in Spain in English, you may want to brush up your language skills before and while you are there. That will make it much easier to interact with locals, and also equip you with the fourth-most spoken language in the world! For certain regions, such as Catalonia (and its capital Barcelona), it doesn’t hurt to learn at least a few phrases in the regional lingo (Catalonian in this case).\n\nThat said, life as a student in Spain is an experience like no other. You will find many friends in the country’s vibrant, diverse student community. Spanish students work hard, but they find plenty of time for fun. If you plan to go out at night, be sure to take an afternoon nap - most clubs don't even open until after midnight and your friends will want to party until dawn!"
