        "text": "A regular semester's workload consists of 30 ECTS. ECTS is based on the principle that 60 credits measure the workload of a fulltime student during one academic year. The European Credits Transfer System measures the total time that is required to take a subject: theoretical and practical classes, study, projects, etc. In addition, each ECTS credit is equivalent to 10 contact hours and 25 self study hours. Students are advised to take a minimum of 48 credits per year or 24 credits per semester with a maximum of 60 credits per year or 30 credits per semester.\n\nBachelor courses are meant to prepare students for professional activity. Study plans for Bachelor degrees include 240 credits, distributed over four years. At the end, a Bachelor's final project is produced and submitted, with a credit load of between 6 and 30 credits.\n\nStudy plans for Masters degrees include between 60 and 120 ECTS credits, distributed over one or two years. At the end, a Masters final project is produced and publicly read, with a credit load of between 6 and 30 ECTS credits.\n\nRight now UPV is only working through UPV agreements between Universities, Institutions or Associations in order to receive Studying Abroad Students. If as a free mover student you are interested to join the program, please contact with us writing to studyabroad@upv.es\n\n→ Excused Absence due to illness: You must provide a medical note from a doctor showing a visit to a clinic on the day that you are ill.\n\n→ To get a medical note to justify absence due to illness , you will now need to do the following: Notify your professors immediately that you will be ill and that you are going to the doctor.\n\n→ Students are completely responsible for justifying their absences in case of illness, they must send an email to their Professors attaching a medical note, with a copy to studyabroad@upv.es, and if they come to the UPV through a Program (FSU, USAC, ISA, AIP or UVA), with an email copy to them.
