The country is geographically and culturally diverse, with storied stone castles, aqueducts, ancient ruins, snowcapped mountains, vast monuments, and sophisticated cities. From the cosmopolitan coastal city of Barcelona to the more traditional Sevilla in the south, you can discover the multifaceted culture of Spain while studying. Food is the most important pillar of Spanish society, so be prepared to enjoy a good paella, seafood, or jámon, and eat hundreds of tapas! In the cradle of Castellano, you will learn Miguel de Cervantes’ language and bring a new facet to your Spanish proficiency. Alcoy is a small town in the Valencia province nicely situated in an inland valley roughly 20 km from the Costa Blanca.\n\nThis program is for engineering students only – particularly those in Chemical, Electrical, and Computer Science. Courses are conducted through the Polytechnic University of Valencia in Alcoy. A majority of classes are taught in English or are “English-friendly.\""
