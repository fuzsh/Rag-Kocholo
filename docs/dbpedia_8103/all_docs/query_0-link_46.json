        "text": "\"I could not be happier with my abroad experience with ISA. On this trip I was able to meet students from all over the United States as well as some people from Valencia and other parts of the world! In just a month I saw so many different parts of Spain and became pretty accustomed to the lifestyle in our home city. My experience would not have been the same without the people at ISA or my host family. The program directors were amazing and made sure that we were not only learning about the history and culture of Spain, but having a great time along the way! I am so lucky to have built such a strong relationship with my host family, and plan on keeping touch with them for the rest of my life. I have seen my language comprehension and speaking skills improve so much in the short time I was abroad, but above all I have gained so much more self confidence. There were times that were challenging for me but I know that those moments helped me to grow into a more confident and experienced person. I have had one of the best summers of my life and I owe that to ISA, my host family, and everyone I met along the way!\"\n\nTaylor S.University Of Nebraska, Lincoln"
