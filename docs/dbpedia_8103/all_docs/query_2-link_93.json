        "text": "Alongside a variety of courses strongly focused on health, sciences, business, and humanities that are taught in English, you could have the opportunity to get hands-on experience in a field of choice by participating in the host university internship course or other service-learning courses.\n\nCourses are taught by the host university faculty and are taken with other international students, local students, or a mixture of both. If you are taking courses in Spanish, a language placement exam will be issued to you on-site. Courses are taken at the UCV-Godella campus on the outskirts of the city of Valencia.\n\nA Spanish student visa is required for U.S. students participating in academic programs in Spain lasting 91 days or more. For non-U.S. citizens, you should contact your consulate to verify specific entry requirements. Please click on the \"Spanish Visa Support\" icon on the \"What's Included\" tab of this page to learn more about visa requirements and and the optional Spain Visa Service.\n\nEnjoy Flexibility with ISA Flex\n\nWe’ve partnered with Arizona State University (ASU) to help you overcome common study abroad challenges by adding an ASU Online course to your ISA program. With more than 2,100 courses to choose from, ISA Flex minimizes academic challenges, like major requirements and limited course options, so you can make the most of your experience abroad. Once you’ve applied, access the Flex form in your ISA Student Portal for more information on how to add this to your program and enroll in the course you need.\n\nApartments are a great housing option if you are seeking complete independence during your time abroad. Apartments are assigned on a first-come, first-served basis, and availability is limited. Rent and utilities are included in the program price, and each apartment is fully furnished. Apartments, spread throughout the city, typically house three-five ISA students, with shared room occupancy. Meals and laundry service are not included.\n\nIn this ISA housing option, you will pay a $300 security deposit. ISA may retain some, or all, of this deposit in the event of damage to property, or if utility usage exceeds the allotted monthly amount.\n\nHost families are a great choice if you are seeking full linguistic and cultural immersion during your time abroad. Each host family has been carefully selected by ISA’s resident staff in order to best accommodate your needs and to ensure a comfortable situation. Homestays will provide three meals a day and laundry service once a week. You will typically share a room with another ISA student of the same legal gender. Single rooms may be available for an additional fee.\n\nThe student residence is a great choice if you would like to be independent while living with other international and local students. With availability limited on a first-come, first-served basis, you will room with another ISA student of the same gender. Single rooms may also be available for an additional fee. You will have access to laundry facilities. If attending the FSU Student Center or the Universidad Catolica de Valencia, the student residence option may not be the housing best option as the commute will be around an hour depending on the transportation used.\n\nIn this ISA housing option, you will pay a $300 security deposit. ISA may retain some, or all, of this deposit in the event of damage to property, or if utility usage exceeds the allotted monthly amount."
