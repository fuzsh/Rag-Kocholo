        "text": "Rosa Sanchidrián\n\nRector of Universidad Europea de Valencia\n\nThe challenge of leading Universidad Europea de Valencia is one that I took on from the outset with great enthusiasm and determination. After more than 24 years developing my professional career at Universidad Europea—growing as a professor and education manager, participating in research and innovation projects, and directing the Postgraduate School—I am extremely proud to be part of this important project.\n\nUniversidad Europea de Valencia is an inclusive and global institution that is open to the world, the city of Valencia and all its private and public agents. We are a multi-faceted, diverse university that is committed to digital transformation and innovation from a spirit of continuous improvement. A university that is aware of the requirements of a constantly changing world and one that demands the best version of ourselves as people and as professionals.\n\nThat’s why our daily commitment lies in offering our students a comprehensive and differential education through an academic model that focuses on four major dimensions: intellectual, professional, international and socioethical. This model is aimed at ensuring our students are successful professionals who become the leaders of tomorrow, applying all of the knowledge, skills, values and pride they acquired studying here.\n\nTechnology and digitalisation are present in all professions. In order to lead this change, we are working every day as professors and mentors with an experiential learning model where the student is at the centre of the vital university experience. In addition, students beginning and completing their university studies—whether pursuing an undergraduate or postgraduate degree—are challenged to learn via different paradigms that allow them to evolve, reinforce their resilience, and enjoy the influence and values that will distinguish them in any professional trajectory. This transformation is only possible in an interdisciplinary and international environment. At our urban campus, 46% of our students come from all over the world.\n\nTo this end, we count on our entire academic community and our partners who work every day to ensure that our institution continues to grow, while accompanying our students throughout the formative stages of their education to encourage them to be better individuals and citizens—free spirits who are environmentally responsible—and, of course, to always be willing to learn.\n\nWe are highly prepared to provide an innovative response to today’s demands, with multidisciplinary teams that are one hundred percent connected to the professional world. We are a key project within the Valencian Community, with a future full of opportunities in research, teaching and management that we will lead with both enthusiasm and responsibility in order to contribute to improve our society. Without a doubt, our University is defined by our mutual commitment and team efforts. This truly makes our institution an innovative, avant-garde and unique project.\n\nThank you all."
