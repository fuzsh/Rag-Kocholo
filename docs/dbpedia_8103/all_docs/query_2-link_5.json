        "text": "The University of Valencia of today is the outcome of more than five centuries of history that have led to the accumulation of knowledge and unique documentary treasures, making it one of the top Spanish universities.\n\nIn the thirteenth century, higher education was established in the city of Valencia thanks to King James I of Aragon who had obtained a Studium Generale institution from Pope Innocent IV in 1245. However, it was not until 30 October 1499 that the Juries of Valencia drew up the Constitutions of what was about to become the first University of Valencia: a university authorised by the Papal Bull on 23 January 1501, signed by the Valencian Pope Alexander VI and by the royal privilege of Ferdinand II the Catholic. It was granted on 16 February 1502.\n\nFor more than 500 years, the development of the University of Valencia has run in parallel with the development of the city and has been an inextricable part of its urban fabric, creating spaces for teaching, research, creation and dissemination of culture and science as well as knowledge transfer.\n\nInitially dedicated to the studies of medicine, humanities, theology and law, the university has witnessed over the past two decades an accelerated process of transformation and growth, something incomparable to earlier periods. This significant effort has turned the University of Valencia into a modern, global university. It has become a leader when it comes to the application of new technologies, connected to important international scientific and teaching networks.\n\nThe University of Valencia has become one to the top five scientific centres in Spain thanks to its commitment to excellence and to the wide range of teaching and research activities offered in all areas of knowledge (basic sciences and engineering, health sciences, educational sciences, humanities and social sciences, economics and law)."
