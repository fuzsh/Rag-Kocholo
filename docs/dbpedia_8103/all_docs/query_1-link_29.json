I was originally hesitant to study abroad because I was worried about spending too much money but, Valencia had so many cheap restaurants, places to visit, and transportation options compared to other countries. ISA was helpful in helping me to reduce my expenses by placing me in a host family. My family provided me with three meals a day and laundry once a week. My host family not only helped to save me money, but immersed me in Spanish culture through their cooking, language, and everyday life. I am so thankful for ISA for giving me this eye-opening experience!\n\n1 person found this review helpful.\n\nJulia\n\n5/5\n\n Yes, I recommend this program\n\nFavorite Semester\n\nMy experience in Valencia Spain was one of a lifetime. All staff were fantastic and were great program leaders. My transition to living in Spain was painless and my time spent there was beyond enjoyable. We did many different cultural activities as a program and through my ISA program which were all fun and very educational. I was able to build relationships with the ISA staff and others students from all over which was very cool. I recommend ISA and and this program to anyone and everyone!!!!!!\n\nWhat was the most unfamiliar thing you ate?\n\nTraditional Valencian paella\n\nPros\n\nWalkable\n\nSafe\n\nClean\n\nCons\n\nSmaller city\n\nNot a lot of English speakers\n\nExpensive to travel to and from\n\n2 people found this review helpful.\n\nSophie\n\n5/5\n\n Yes, I recommend this program\n\nISA Valencia Experience\n\nI highly recommend this program to individuals who want to experience city life but not in an overwhelmingly large city. Although Valencia is the third largest city in all of Spain, it feels extremely safe, large enough that there is plenty to discover, and small enough that it is easy to navigate and get familiar with. The numerous historical museums, buildings, and cathedrals have a ton of history to rediscover, and the beach is only a metro ride away. I especially loved the daily routine of going to the street flea markets that happen in different parts of the city every day of the week besides Sunday.\n\nPros\n\nFeels very safe, even at night\n\nEasy access to public transportation\n\nInexpensive to eat out\n\n31 people found this review helpful.\n\nMakena\n\n5/5\n\n Yes, I recommend this program\n\nA trip I will never stop thinking about!!\n\nAs cliché as it sounds, my study abroad experience with ISA in Valencia this past summer was hands down the best thing I have ever done. Since I returned to the US in July, a day has not gone by where I don't wish I was still living in Spain. From the second it began, I was beyond happy with every aspect of the program and my life in Valencia, and ISA did a fantastic job facilitating everything. Not only did I meet some of my best friends (whether that be from my own college, other universities back in the states, or people who lived in Europe), the independence of living in a homestay allowed me to thrive independently and truly feel like a local. I was amazed to see how much 6 weeks abroad was able to broaden my horizons and allow me to try new foods, see new places, and be comfortable with being uncomfortable at times!\n\nAside from the social aspect, taking two courses at Centre d'Idiomes de la Universitat de València really expanded my educational experience and showed me a new way of teaching/learning I hadn't previously been exposed to. Being in class from 9-2 on Monday-Thursday didn't feel like a burden, and we were able to do plenty throughout the week still. All in all, I couldn't be more grateful for my study abroad trip and all it gave me, I definitely would say I'm a different person than when I left back in May and have learned exponentially more than I could've ever anticipated.\n\nWhat was the most nerve-racking moment and how did you overcome it?\n\nOn the front end of my trip, I decided to do a short solo-trip to Madrid before flying to Valencia to begin my program. As someone who had never left the country, I thought my several experiences traveling alone and my proficiency in Spanish would be enough to get me through the first 48 hours, but the culture shock was real! Upon landing in Madrid, I was shocked by how massive the airport was, and was certainly overwhelmed by the signs and directions. I checked into my hotel with over 24 hours of no sleep, then decided to go explore the city. I had absolutely no idea how to use public transportation such as the metro or buses, wasn't familiar with Euros as currency, and certainly wasn't used to being somewhere where nobody spoke English. I made it to downtown Madrid and spent the afternoon sightseeing, eating out, and trying not to get lost! I took the wrong train going home, and called my parents thousands of miles away in a panic. Looking back, despite the immense stress of my solo venture to Madrid, I feel as if it made me capable of traveling to any foreign country on my own in the future.\n\nPros\n\nWay of life in Spain\n\nPersonal connections with new friends\n\nAbility to use my spanish-speaking abilities in real life\n\nCons\n\nAdjusting to schedule at homestay (different meal times, etc)\n\n6+ hour time difference with friends/family back in the states\n\nLengthy classes (2.5 hours) with minimal breaks between\n\n40 people found this review helpful.\n\nIsabella\n\n5/5\n\n Yes, I recommend this program\n\nValencia Semester Abroad\n\nI went abroad to Valencia during the spring 2023 semester and it was one of the best experiences of my life! I learned a lot about Spanish culture, traveled around Europe & Morocco and met lifelong friends. While traveling, I was also able to complete credits at UCV for my kinesiology major. The classes I took were all interesting and we were given many resources if we ran into problems. Both of the advisors were also amazing and were there when we needed any type of help. I recommend going to study abroad in Spain!\n\nPros\n\nBeautiful beaches and scenery\n\nExcursions and trips with friends\n\nGreat advisors\n\n58 people found this review helpful.\n\nAnya\n\n5/5\n\n Yes, I recommend this program\n\nBest Experience in My Life\n\nValencia was the best choice I have ever made. I studied abroad through ISA but I am a nursing major, and it was a little difficult to find a program that met my requirements so I could still enter nursing school. Valencia provided the opportunity to not only get into nursing school but learn so much about myself, how I handle difficult situations, and just be free to experience life and different cultures. I loved the friends I made, and the people I was with that made this experience the best.\n\nPros\n\nAdventure\n\nFriendships\n\nGreat weather\n\nCons\n\nDifferent timing for food and waking up\n\n57 people found this review helpful.\n\nNikki\n\n5/5\n\n Yes, I recommend this program\n\nThe Time of My Life!\n\nStudying abroad in Valencia was hands down the best 5 weeks of my life. I went into my experience without any expectations, knowledge of Spanish, or preconceived ideas of what was ahead of me. Little did I know I would meet the most amazing people, learn to communicate with a lotttttt of hand gestures and facial expressions, and fall in love with a city I never even knew existed. I wouldn't change one second of it even if I could. Not only did I come back with exciting stories and memories, but I actually enjoyed the courses I took and no doubt learned way more than I ever would have if I had opted not to step out of my comfort zone. Because it was such a short time, every day was an adventure, whether it was a class field trip, an excursion with ISA, or a day trip with my friends in the program--I was always on the go. If you want a thrilling experience in a unique city immersed in a beautiful culture, Valencia is the place for you!\n\nWhat would you improve about this program?\n\nIn all honesty, I would not change anything about this program. There was just the right amount of tourist excursions, cultural trips, and challenges.\n\n127 people found this review helpful.\n\nRead my full story\n\nJordan\n\n5/5\n\n Yes, I recommend this program\n\nWonderful experience\n\nThis was an absolutely wonderful experience that allowed me to experience parts of Spain on my own terms while still having a support system to answer any questions I had. Not only was Valencia beautiful, but the ISA staff was so helpful in highlighting places for me to visit and providing suggestions of what to do and see. The pre-determined excursions were very fun and allowed me to see the best parts of Valencia, Madrid, and Barcelona in a limited amount of time, and I was still allowed plenty of time to explore on my own. Therefore I really felt that I was able to become part of the community by living there day to day (unlike a tourist), but I was not completely abandoned to figure everything out on my own. I had an absolutely wonderful time and ISA did a great job of arranging a host grandma for me to stay with. The food she prepared was so delicious and the conversations we had not only improved my Spanish skills, but also gave me a better sense of the culture by learning more about her and her lifestyle. Classes were very manageable and the University of Valencia was very conveniently located to my home and other activities. I would highly recommend this program because of how easy ISA makes everything and also because Valencia is the perfect combination of history, modernity, and beach.\n\n127 people found this review helpful.\n\nQuestions & Answers\n\nQuestion\n\nAlumni Interviews\n\nThese are in-depth Q&A sessions with verified alumni.\n\nNikki Schroeder\n\nNikki was born and raised in Wenatchee, Washington and is currently studying Management at Eastern Washington University. To complement her Management major, Nikki is also pursing minors in Economics, International Business, and Communications. She has a knack for taking on too much at once, but when she does have free time, you can find her hiking through the mountains or crafting for her friends and family.\n\nWhat do you tell your friends who are thinking about going abroad?\n\nNikki: A lot of my friends approach me saying they are interested in studying abroad and the first thing I say is do it! I tell them that my summer abroad was the best summer of my life and I would not change anything about it. All of the experiences I had, both good and bad, were 100% worth it.\n\nWhat's your favorite story to tell about your time abroad?\n\nNikki: A group of us decided to go up to Pamplona for the running of the bulls. And I ran with the bulls. My favorite story to tell about it though is when I came back and told my host mom about it. My Spanish is very limited, so I had to tell her about it via hand gestures and facial expressions. As you can imagine, when she finally realized what I was saying, her eyes got ten times wider and she said, \"Oh Niiiikki, estas loca!\"\n\nWhat made this experience unique and special?\n\nKalob: I think what made my experience unique in regards to the other individuals in my program was that I didn't know any Spanish going into it. I saw it as a challenge and was excited to see where not knowing the language took me. I am a very independent person so I had to learn to rely on others to communicate with the local people.\n\nHaving to do this allowed me to create even stronger ties with the individuals in my program and pushed me to expedite my learning process. It also made interactions between me and the Spaniards I met very amusing to watch and hear!\n\nWhat made this trip meaningful to you, or how did this trip change your perceptions or future path?\n\nKalob: This trip taught me that no matter where you are, you can always create a home for yourself. When you study abroad with a group of people, you form bonds almost instantaneously with each other. My group became my family, and Valencia became my home.\n\nNever in a million years did I think I would fall in love with a city as big as Valencia, but because I made so many memories there, it will always have a place in my heart. Now I know that wherever my life takes me, even if it's not what I thought it would be, I will be able to adapt to it and make the most of any situation.\n\nOther Programs You Might Like\n\nnew reviews\n\n\n\n\n\nISA (International Studies Abroad)\n\nISA Study Abroad in London, England\n\nEngland\n\n4.95 •20 reviews\n\nStudy abroad in London, England with ISA!
