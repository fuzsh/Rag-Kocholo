With a population of around 1.5 million people in its urban area, Valencia is the third-largest city in Spain following the capital Madrid and Barcelona.\n\nThe city combines the hustle and bustle of a major city with quiet plazas and gorgeous parks representative of the Iberian Peninsula.\n\nIf you’re not from Spain, Valencia is a great place to study abroad. It could be argued that it has just as much to offer international students as its more famous counterparts, Barcelona and Madrid.\n\nThere’s a lot to see and explore along its cobblestoned streets: beautiful beaches, an attractive city centre that is packed with historical buildings and monuments, museums, bustling bars, irresistible food, intriguing history and culture and an inviting weather. All these things make Valencia is a major tourist magnet.\n\nTo put the icing on the cake Valencia is quite budget-friendly, making it ideal for domestic and international students alike. No wonder it was ranked in the top 100 (74th) of the QS 2019 Best Student Cities ranking.\n\nValencia has a great climate\n\nValencia’s climate is classically Mediterranean, forming a perfect platform for making the most of everything this world-class city has to offer. With the sun shining almost 300 days a year, Valencia has very mild winters. It is mild and humid by Spanish standards avoiding the extreme heat of other Spanish cities but also rarely as cold as Madrid in the winter.\n\nSo, if you choose to study in Valencia, you will spend a lot of time outdoors soaking up the sun.\n\nFamous for its food\n\nPerhaps the one thing for which the city is most famous for, is food.\n\nKnown as the ‘spiritual home of paella’, Valencia is also a great place to visit for serious foodies. You will find some of the most authentic and traditional varieties of paella in Valencia.\n\nAnother well-known dish from Valencia is esgarraet, a tasty salad made of salted cod and red peppers.\n\nFideuà is another local dish that is similar to paella, but with noodles instead of rice.\n\nGetting around Valencia\n\nValencia is relatively compact and with a fantastic transport system, it is easy to get around the city whether by bus, train or even walking.\n\nIf you ever feel like having a change of scenery and want to explore the rest of the country or even Europe, the city has an airport and a high-speed railway service, with well-connected links to other major cities in Spain, as well as elsewhere in Europe.\n\nStudent life in Valencia\n\nValencia has its fair share of notable universities that are highly regarded for their academic excellence.
