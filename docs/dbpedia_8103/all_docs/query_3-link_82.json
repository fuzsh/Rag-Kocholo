If, in addition, a university has a long and rich history ?as is the case with University of Valencia? then complexity is further increased, since it has to rely on suitable means to preserve and disseminate its heritage. In such cases, a university guide becomes an essential instrument to effectively finding information on the resources made available by the institution. This guide seeks to provide information on University of Valencia in an accurate and exhaustive way.Students will find in it the widest study offer for both official and UV?specific degrees in the Valencian Community, delivered in three campuses and six scientific areas. University of Valencia offers more than 60 official degrees, 100 PhD courses ?of which 20 are quality certified?, over 250 postgraduate courses, and La Nau Gran, targeted at older students looking for a second chance. Humanities and engineering, social sciences and health sciences, and legal and teaching sciences make up an educational supply characterised by scientific and technical knowledge and fostering specialised higher education and citizenship culture. The University is also made up of numerous research teams that generate both basic and applied knowledge which is then transferred onto society by the institutes, laboratories, and departments. University of Valencia is also synonymous with culture and cultural heritage. For that reason and beyond study and research, it has facilities and resources that favour the development of university life: halls of residence, sport facilities, libraries, associative and volunteer networks, and exceptional places like the Botanic Garden and the historic building at Carrer de la Nau. The university of Valencia is at the crossroads of knowledge and a Nau for the future.\n\nAbout Universitat de Valencia\n\nA university is an extraordinarily complex organisation, given the diversity of the studies offered, its research networks and different bodies, and its links with society.
