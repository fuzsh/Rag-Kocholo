        "text": "Eligibility\n\nFull-time, degree-seeking student at Kent State\n\nAny major\n\nMinimum cumulative GPA: 2.5 or higher\n\nCompletion of Intermediate Spanish II is recommended for all students and will be required for enrollment in Spanish-taught courses\n\nAcademic Programs\n\nSome courses at UEV are taught in English, but the majority are taught in Spanish. While students from any major may apply for the UEV exchange program, it is best suited for Translation majors and those who are interested in practicing their Spanish language skills. English-taught courses are available in the following fields of study, but seats cannot be guaranteed and students may be placed in the Spanish-taught equivalent:\n\nBusiness\n\nInternational Relations\n\nMarketing\n\nPsychology\n\nTourism Management\n\nTranslation\n\nStudents must register for the equivalent of 12 US credit hours each semester. Find courses offered at UEV.\n\nValencia, Spain\n\n​​​​​​​Living in Valencia means getting the best of Spanish weather--it's milder and warmer than the rest of Spain. Similar to Colorado, Valencia is sunny 300 days of the year and has very little rain. Located on the Eastern coast of Spain, Valencia's miles of beaches offer a taste of nature in the city. In comparison to some other larger Spanish cities, Valencia is quieter and extraordinarily bike-friendly, bursting with bike paths that take you around the city.\n\nIn Valencia, two languages are officially spoken, Spanish and Valencian, which is a Catalan dialect. As one of the most intriguing cities in Spain, Valencia is well-known for its City of Science and Arts, a two-kilometer hub of entertainment options and a place students ought to visit; the ultra-modern scientific complex contains astonishing architectural pieces, museums, and clear beautiful water all around. Other famous places are the Valencia Cathedral, the Central Market, and the Old Town. Valencia is a destination that has a very strong Spanish cultural representation, especially through its cuisine, as this is the place where Paella was invented! Valencia is very welcoming to people from all over the world and is a city full of beaches, festivals, botanic gardens, and more.\n\nCampus Information\n\nUEV’s campus is located in the coastal city of Valencia, Spain. Not as large as Madrid or Barcelona, the city still offers all of the Spanish charm on a slightly smaller scale. UEV is undoubtedly a great place to meet other exchange students, as there are more than five higher education institutions nearby. Close proximity to the beach is another attractive feature of studying at UEV.\n\nTransportation\n\nAirports\n\nValencia Airport is about 45 minutes from UEV’s campus via public transportation or about 25 minutes by car.\n\nLocal Transit\n\nStudents can navigate Valencia using buses, the metro, or trams. For travel farther from Valencia, students can use trains or the airport."
