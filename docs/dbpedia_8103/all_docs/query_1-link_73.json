        "text": "Spain has a long history of higher education, with its oldest university, Universidad de Salamanca, dating back to 1218. Its higher education system was overhauled in 2007 to embrace the three-cycle system of the Bologna Process, ensuring compatibility with the European Higher Education Area (EHEA).\n\nThere are a total of 76 universities (or universidades) in Spain, 45 of which are run and funded by the state, while 31 are private or run by the Catholic Church. 25 Spanish universities are featured in the QS World University Rankings® 2019, of which 13 are within the global top 500. The largest concentrations of leading Spanish universities are found in the capital city Madrid and second city Barcelona.\n\nThe top five Spanish universities, all ranking within the world’s top 300, are:\n\nUniversidad Autónoma de Madrid\n\nFounded in 1968, the Universidad Autónoma de Madrid (sometimes called UAM, or the Autonomous University of Madrid), is currently ranked at 159th in the QS World University Rankings 2019 – as well as featuring in the QS Top 50 Under 50. UAM is home to more than 36,000 students across its eight faculties, and is especially noted for its Faculty of Law. It has three campuses, of which the main one, the Cantoblanco Campus, is located 15km (9 miles) north of Madrid. The Universidad Autónoma de Madrid prides itself in being the alma mater of His Majesty King Felipe VI of Spain.\n\nUniversity of Barcelona (Universitat de Barcelona)\n\nRanked 166th, the University of Barcelona is the second-highest ranked Spanish university in the world. Established in 1450, it's among the oldest higher education institutions in the world, with rich traditions dating back to the Medieval Ages. Today, almost 63,000 students are enrolled in a wide array of undergraduate and postgraduate courses, across the university's 16 faculties and 106 departments. The University of Barcelona ranks within the world’s top 100 for many of the subject areas covered by the QS World University Rankings by Subject.\n\nUniversitat Autònoma de Barcelona\n\nThe Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, established in 1968, ranks at joint 193rd in the world in 2019, making it Spain’s third representative at international level. As one of the world’s leading universities under 50 years old, it features in the QS Top 50 Under 50. It teaches over 40,000 students and is famous for being one of the few universities in Spain to have a centralized campus, created in order to promote a strong university community, with all academic, research, cultural and social activities in the same place. This integrated campus is located about 20km (12 miles) from the center of Barcelona.\n\nComplutense University of Madrid\n\nThe oldest Spanish university, the Complutense University of Madrid is in fact one of the oldest higher education institutions in the world. It dates back to 1293, when it was originally known as Estudio de Escuelas Generales de Alcalá, before receiving its current name in 1499. Today, Complutense University of Madrid ranks at 206th place in the world and within the global top 50 in the subject area of dentistry. More than 86,000 students study in the university, which was one of the first in the world to give a doctoral degree to a female student, in 1785.\n\nUniversity of Navarra\n\nA private university, the University of Navarra was established in 1952 by Saint Josemaría Escrivá de Balaguer. More than 11,400 students are enrolled in the university’s undergraduate and postgraduate degree programs, with many international master’s students. The university’s main campuses are in Pamplona and San Sebastián, while its prestigious IESE Business School also has offices in Barcelona, Madrid, New York, Munich and São Paulo. At the start of 2015, the university inaugurated a new museum of contemporary art, designed by well-known architect Rafael Moneo. In the QS World University Rankings 2019, the University of Navarra ranks joint 242nd.\n\nSearch and compare the top universities in Spain\n\nA relatively large and highly diverse country, Spain offers a wide range of experiences for students. Depending on where you’re based, you may be able to spend your downtime relaxing on the beach, trekking in the mountains, or pursuing snow sports. Wherever you are, you’re also guaranteed to have ample opportunities to join in with the distinctive Spanish customs and traditions, from afternoon siestas, to late-night meals, delicious tapas, and a wide plethora of festivals – including the messy tomato-based food fight La Tomatina and the danger-laced Pamplona Bull Run.\n\nFind out about some of Spain's top student cities...\n\nMadrid\n\nAs in any historic European capital worth its salt, in Madrid you’ll find fast-paced modern life taking place against a backdrop of beautiful historic architecture. One of the largest urban hubs in Europe, Madrid is a major international center for business and finance, as well as being known for its world-leading arts and cultural venues. Among the most prominent of these are the three art museums which comprise the city’s so-called “Golden Triangle of Art”. Football fans will know the city for its team Real Madrid, one of the world’s most decorated and famous clubs. The formidable reputation held by Madrid’s universities among employers contributes to it ranking 32nd among the world’s best student cities.\n\nMadrid is home to some of the best Spanish universities, including four which feature in the QS World University Rankings: Universidad Autónoma de Madrid (159th), Universidad Complutense de Madrid (206th), Universidad Carlos III de Madrid (=253rd) and Politécnica de Madrid (joint 470th). Some of Europe’s best business schools also have campuses here, including one of ESCP Europe’s six campuses, IE Business School, EAE Business School, and ESADE Ramon Llull University.\n\nBarcelona\n\nSpain’s second-largest city, Barcelona is the capital of Catalonia, a region to the southeast of Spain with a proud regional identity. It is one of the most aesthetically distinctive cities in Europe, dominated by daring modernist architecture, and in particular the spectacular creations of the architect Anton Gaudí. A famously youth-orientated city, it’s known for its vibrant nightlife, and events such as the annual Primavera Sound music festival. On top of all its urban delights, Barcelona also offers very close proximity to beautiful Mediterranean beaches, and some of Europe’s best surfing spots. Like Madrid, it too boasts one of the world’s most famous and successful football teams, popularly known as “Barça”.\n\nUniversities in Barcelona include some of the highest-ranked in Spain: the University of Barcelona (166th in the world), Universitat Autónoma de Barcelona (joint 193rd), Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (joint 275th) and Universitat Pompeu Fabra (298th).\n\nValencia\n\nSpain’s third-largest city, located on the coast about 350km south of Barcelona, Valencia is probably best known for being the spiritual home of the delicious rice-based dish paella. It’s also home of the massive Les Falles festival, where hundreds of giant puppets are paraded and then burned, and the Festival Internacional de Benicàssim, one of the biggest music festivals in Europe. It’s a major tourist magnet, due to its beautiful beaches, attractive city center, museums and interest-packed ciutat vella (old town) – full of historic buildings and bustling bars.\n\nNotable universities in Valencia include Universidad Politecnica de Valencia and the Universitat de Valencia, both of which make the top 600 of the QS World University Rankings.\n\nGranada\n\nLocated towards the south of Spain, Granada has a distinctly North African feel, the result of centuries of Moorish rule. The most famous example of this legacy is the spectacular Alhambra, a huge castle which overlooks the city. Granada is a major student city, with the Universidad de Granada ranked within the global top 500. This large university hosts more than 80,000 students across its five different campuses, offering instant access to a large and diverse student community. Regional traditions in this part of Spain include a custom of serving free tapas with every drink you order – not a bad perk!\n\nSeville\n\nAnother charming historical city, located towards the southwest of Spain, Seville is the capital of the region of Andalucía. Like most Spanish cities, Seville is known for its festivals (Semana Santa and the Feria de Sevilla are the biggest), and its tapas, but the city is probably most famous for being the home of flamenco – Spain’s national dance – and the accompanying music. In the modern age, Seville is also famous for its relaxed but exciting nightlife – so if you like to party into the early hours, this Spanish city should certainly be on your list. Universities in Seville are led by the sizeable Universidad de Sevilla (ranked 601-650 in the world)."
