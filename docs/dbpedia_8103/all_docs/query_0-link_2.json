        "text": "Preliminary Program (all expenses paid!)\n\nTo prepare students for courses instructed at a Spanish university, students will enroll in an on-site preliminary program that will generally run one month prior to the start of the semester at the University of Valencia. During this time, students will complete a 3-credit course on the Geography and History of Spain, taught by the Resident Director, and they will also begin the mandatory 3-credit Grammar Workshop, taught by a University of Valencia professor.\n\nThe Geography/History of Spain is an introduction to Spanish history, geography, art and architecture. The course examines the development of Spain’s multicultural identity with attention drawn to developments extending from pre-Roman times through the Moorish occupation to the 21st century. Classroom instruction is complemented with visits to sites and museums in and around such cities like Valencia, Barcelona, Madrid, Granada, Cordoba, and Seville. Please click here to view a sample syllabus.\n\nPlease Note: This preliminary program will run only if a minimum number of students enroll.\n\nThe Grammar Workshop will assist students in the development of reading and writing skills, and oral fluency. Emphasis is on grammatical structures, idiomatic expressions and language use, as well as on subtle differences in meaning caused by changes in verb forms, prepositions, articles, etc. This course will last throughout the semester and serves as a support class for students.\n\nCourses & Credits\n\nIn order to have an idea of what classes are available, you should visit the University of Valencia website. To help you navigate through this website, view the flowchart located here.\n\nYou can also access faculty course schedules (horarios) from the Portal del Alumno and then the process is the same as that described the flowchart above. When looking for courses, be sure that you are looking at courses for undergraduate students only and that you are looking at classes in the correct term of study.\n\nNote: Not all departments have uploaded their schedules; upon arrival you may have to go to the actual building and buy it in printed form at the fotocopiadora.\n\nYou will need to be sure that you are registered as a full time student according to the University of Valencia and Rutgers University. That means you will need to take at least 24-30 ECTS credits (12-15 RU credits) each semester. Thus, most students take two to three classes their first semester (in addition to the History and Grammar classes) and four to five classes their second term at the University of Valencia. It is not possible to take classes as not-for-credit or pass/fail.\n\nInternship Opportunities for Academic Year students\n\nSome internships are credit-bearing, others are non-credit bearing.\n\nFor information about Study Abroad credit transfer, registration, and transcripts please visit the Academics section of our website.\n\nExcursions\n\nDuring your program, you will also have several group excursions designed to help you become more familiar with your host city and the surrounding region. Some of these excursions are part of your 3-credit preliminary geography and history class. The excursion may change slightly from year to year.\n\nPast excursions have included:\n\nPicnic in Xàtiva\n\nPaella workshop at the residence hall\n\nWalking tours of historic Valencia\n\nMadrid -- to explore Imperial Spain and visit some of the world's finest museums\n\nBarcelona -- to learn about Mediterranean Spain from the Romans to Gaudí and Picasso\n\nAndalusia -- to experience the time of Muslim Spain.\n\nFallas tour with hot chocolate and churros\n\nThanksgiving dinner at Resident Director’s house\n\nTree-trimming party at Resident Director’s house\n\nMore details about the excursions will be provided by your resident director after your acceptance.\n\nStudents will be housed in private residence halls at the Colegio Mayor Ausias March. You will share your bedroom with another student, usually another Rutgers participant, or possibly a Spanish student. Some rooms in your residence hall are suite-style and the residents in the other bedrooms of your suite, who will also share a bathroom with you, are usually Spanish students. The residence hall is a 5 -10 minute walk from the main part of campus. Please note that smoking is permitted in the residence halls in Spain.\n\nA full meal plan is included as part of your program cost; all meals are available at the student dining hall in your residence hall. There are no kitchen facilities in the residence hall, and there are no refunds for meals not taken in the student cafeteria. If you have special dietary needs, please alert the residence hall staff and they will try their best to accommodate you.\n\nFor more information regarding Colegio Mayor Ausias March, please visit the Colegio Mayor Ausias March website. Do not directly contact or reserve housing with Colegio Mayor Ausias March, as your housing will be arranged by the program."
