        "text": "University Overview\n\nEstablished in 1499, the Universitat de Valencia is one of the oldest universities in Europe. Serving nearly 60,000 students, the university is spread across three campuses and offers classes in over 90 departments including the humanities, social sciences, and the natural sciences.\n\nMany students come to Valencia seeking fluency in Spanish. Since this is a full-immersion program, participants should attain a minimum of two years' Spanish language study before departure, although completing Spanish through Spanish 303 is recommended. Students who lack the confidence necessary to study in their majors in Spanish could consider pursuing a Spanish minor while at Valencia and focus entirely on language study. Ample course work is available in the field of Spanish language, linguistics, literature and theater. Course work and the academic structure can be quite challeging at Valencia. As such, only advanced students with language fluency should consider this exchange.\n\nThe University also offers free, non-credit classes in Catalan for students interested in learning Valencian Spanish.\n\nCity Overview\n\nFounded in 137 BC, the city of Valencia is located on the Mediterranean coast about 190 miles east of Madrid and 240 miles south of Barcelona. With a population of close to 800,000, Valencia is Spain's third largest city and a lively center for today's youth culture who make up over 10% of the total city's population. Boasting a unique blend of old and new, Valencia will charm visitors with all its benefits of urban life in a coastal environment including excellent beaches, nightlife, and ample architectural gems from the Gothic, Renaissance, Baroque and Modern periods.\n\nThe city and the university offer many cultural and recreational activities including musical performances, museums, and sports. Perhaps what Valencia is best known for, however, is Las Fallas, a celebration held each year in mid-March. The entire city participates and the fallas, gigantic wood and plaster models, are built in the streets. On the final night of the celebration, the fallas are set ablaze amid a fireworks display and large street-fair.\n\nValencia is a vibrant city with much to offer students and is within very easy access of both Madrid and Barcelona through its excellent public transportation system.\n\nProgram Highlights\n\nCourses available for most majors provided prerequisites are met!\n\nAll classes are taught in Spanish (or Catalan), so a high level of proficiency in Spanish is required.\n\nFree Catalan language classes.\n\nAcademic Calendar\n\nFall Semester: Mid-September to late January\n\nSpring Semester: Early February to mid-July\n\nAcademic Year: Mid-September to mid-July\n\nPlease see the 2020-21 Academic Calendar for specific dates\n\nAcademic Focus\n\nExchange students can enroll in any class, provided they meet the prerequisites. Certain fields may be space-limited and unavailable for visiting students. Please be aware that there are three campuses at the University of Valencia, spread across the city. Most students in the humanities study at the Blasco Ibanez campus, also home to the International Office.\n\nTeaching can be much more lecture-focused than the discussion-based American model. Keeping open lines of communication between your professor, teaching assistant and yourself will greatly help you, especially if you are having second-language learning issues.\n\nConfidence in both oral and written communication in Spanish is essential. All final exams tend to be comprehensive and essay style. Advanced non-native speakers are still very much encouraged to apply! Spanish skills will definitely improve while abroad!\n\nAll work transfers back to San Marcos and can be used to fulfill all graduation requirements.\n\nUniversity of Valencia Grading Scale\n\nLanguage of Instruction\n\nSpanish\n\nRequirements\n\nClass Level: Upper-division status (completion of 60 units)\n\nGPA of 2.75 or above and good academic standing to departure\n\nTwo and a half years or more college level Spanish\n\nSpecial Note to Business Majors: In order to receive credit for upper-division courses abroad, you must have already completed your Pre-Core course work at CSUSM.\n\nUnits\n\n15 semester units/30 ECT units (European Credit Transfer system).

On-campus housing is limited and can be very costly.
