        "text": "Today is Saturday, Jan. 6, the sixth day of 2018. There are 359 days left in the year.\n\nToday's Highlight in History:\n\nOn Jan. 6, 1968, a surgical team at Stanford University School of Medicine in Palo Alto, California, led by Dr. Norman Shumway performed the first U.S. adult heart transplant, placing the heart of a 43-year-old man in a 54-year-old patient (the recipient died 15 days later).\n\nOn this date:\n\nIn 1540\n\nEngland's King Henry VIII married his fourth wife, Anne of Cleves. (The marriage lasted about six months.)\n\nIn 1759\n\nGeorge Washington and Martha Dandridge Custis were married in New Kent County, Virginia.\n\nIn 1838\n\nSamuel Morse and Alfred Vail gave the first successful public demonstration of their telegraph in Morristown, New Jersey.\n\nIn 1912\n\nNew Mexico became the 47th state.\n\nIn 1919\n\nThe 26th president of the United States, Theodore Roosevelt, died in Oyster Bay, New York, at age 60.\n\nIn 1945\n\nGeorge Herbert Walker Bush married Barbara Pierce at the First Presbyterian Church in Rye, New York.\n\nIn 1950\n\nBritain recognized the Communist government of China.\n\nIn 1974\n\nYear-round daylight saving time began in the United States on a trial basis as a fuel-saving measure in response to the OPEC oil embargo.\n\nIn 1987\n\nThe U.S. Senate voted 88-4 to establish an 11-member panel to hold public hearings on the Iran-Contra affair.\n\nIn 1993\n\nAuthorities rescued Jennifer Stolpa and her infant son, Clayton, after Jennifer's husband, James, succeeded in reaching help, ending the family's eight-day ordeal after becoming lost in the snow-covered Nevada desert.\n\nJazz trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie, 75, died in Englewood, New Jersey; ballet dancer Rudolf Nureyev died in suburban Paris at age 54.\n\nIn 1994\n\nFigure skater Nancy Kerrigan was clubbed on the leg by an assailant at Detroit's Cobo Arena; four men, including the ex-husband of Kerrigan's rival, Tonya Harding, went to prison for their roles in the attack. (Harding pleaded guilty to conspiracy to hinder prosecution, but denied any advance knowledge about the assault.)\n\nIn 2001\n\nWith Vice President Al Gore presiding in his capacity as president of the Senate, Congress formally certified George W. Bush the winner of the bitterly contested 2000 presidential election.\n\nTen years ago:\n\nIn a video posted on the Internet, al-Qaida's American-born spokesman, Adam Gadahn (ah-DAHM' guh-DAHN'), urged fighters to meet President George W. Bush with bombs during his upcoming Mideast visit. Mikhail Saakashvili (sah-kahsh-VIH'-leh) was declared winner of a second term as Georgia's president.\n\nFive years ago:\n\nPresident Barack Obama returned to Washington after a winter vacation in Hawaii that was interrupted by the \"fiscal cliff\" crisis. In his first public speech in six months, a defiant Syrian President Bashar Assad rallied a cheering crowd to fight the uprising against his authoritarian rule, dismissing any chance of dialogue with what he called \"murderous criminals.\" The NHL and the players' association agreed on a tentative pact to end a 113-day lockout.\n\nOne year ago:\n\nCongress certified Donald Trump's presidential victory over the objections of a handful of House Democrats, with Vice President Joe Biden pronouncing, \"It is over.\" An arriving airline passenger pulled a gun from his luggage and opened fire in the baggage claim area at the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport in Florida, killing five people and wounding eight. (A suspect is in custody.)\n\nActresses Debbie Reynolds, who lived in El Paso as a child, and Carrie Fisher were laid to rest together at Forest Lawn Memorial Park - Hollywood Hills.
