        "text": "(1917–93). American jazz trumpet legend Dizzy Gillespie was one of the founders of a revolutionary jazz style known as bebop. Gillespie possessed tremendous technique and played with abandon, reaching the highest notes in the trumpet’s range. His bent trumpet, with its bell pointing toward the ceiling (originally the result of its being sat on), became his personal trademark. Gillespie influenced many of the jazz trumpeters that followed him, including such leading figures as Miles Davis, Thad Jones, and Kenny Dorham, as well as saxophone soloists including John Coltrane, Benny Golson, Dexter Gordon, and James Moody. The Gillespie compositions “A Night in Tunisia,” “Con Alma,” “Woody ‘n’ You,” and “Groovin’ High” are jazz standards.\n\nJohn Birks Gillespie was born in Cheraw, South Carolina, on October 21, 1917. He started playing the trombone in his school band and later switched to the trumpet. By the time he was 18 he was playing with a band in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. In addition to his exceptional gifts as a musician, Gillespie made quite an impression in person. During the beatnik era he sported a goatee and often wore a beret and horn-rimmed glasses. His clowning on stage and his interaction with the audience earned him the nickname Dizzy.\n\nBy the late 1930s Gillespie was working as a composer, arranger, and soloist with the Teddy Hill and Cab Calloway bands. In the early 1940s he worked with the Benny Carter and Earl Hines bands, among others. Gillespie took an active part in the late-night jam sessions at Minton’s Playhouse in New York City’s Harlem neighborhood, where such musicians as pianist Thelonious Monk, drummer Kenny Clarke, and saxophonist Charlie Parker were experimenting with a radically new style of jazz. This new style—bebop—was composed of unconventional chords and rapidly shifting rhythms. Gillespie then became co-leader of a group on 52nd Street with bassist Oscar Pettiford, which marked the birth of the bebop era. When Gillespie and Parker joined Billy Eckstine’s band in 1944, it became the first big band to showcase the new style."
