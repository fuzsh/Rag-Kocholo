        "text": "Within two years he was playing professionally in Philadelphia. His early playing style was a deliberate imitation of Roy Eldridge, whom he was later to replace as trumpeter in Teddy Hill's orchestra. He earned his nick-name in the 30s for the joyful zanyness of his character and his clowning on stage, when playing in the big bands of Teddy Hill and Cab Calloway.\n\nDizzy Gillespie was the last living 'great' from the bebop pioneers, a group of musicians who created a revolution in jazz in the early 40's. Others in the group were Charlie Parker, Bud Powell, Kenny Clarke, Thelonious Monk and Miles Davis. Dizzy and Charlie Parker in particular, when they were playing in the orchestras of Earl Himmes and Billy Eckstine, or jamming in New York jazz clubs, developed the basic principles of bebop. Dizzy once said that Charlie Parker was the 'other half of my heartbeat'. Dizzy's contribution - apart from the bright blistering-paced trumpet playing and his ever-present 'style' - came from his thorough grasp of musical theory, and from his stage dress!\n\nHis sunglasses, beret, and goatee became the hall-marks of bebop. He would also vocalize phrases of the music, putting the trumpet aside and singing in a deep rich voice; baa oobede be-bop...\n\nBecause of the war and a strike in the record-making industry the results of these experiments were not widely known until 1946. First reactions were not promising. The whimsical melodies and complex nervous rhythms took some getting used to after the swings and riffs of classical jazz. In 1947 Dizzy established the first (and only) bebop big band, and in the 50s bebop won general acceptance.\n\nDizzy also played an important part in the introduction of Latin-American rhythms in Jazz, working with Cuban musicians. Many of his compositions became jazz classics: A Night in Tunisia, Woody 'n You, Groovin' High, Salt Peanuts, Manteca, Things to Come, Con Alma and Dizzy's Dance.\n\nDizzy was also known the world over for his bullfrog cheeks when playing in his crazy hats and with his bent trumpet (the result of an unfortunate fall), and his audience-friendly stage style. Between the virtuoso dancing phrases from his trumpet, he would intersperse sardonic jokes, silly announcements, and comic monologues. He once said that his cheeks had been studied by a scientist and had been given the name \"Gillespie's pouches\".\n\nI said yes, and the young man said: \"I just came to warn you. Dizzy Gillespie is looking for you. He wants to punch you back to Johannesburg.\"\n\nI waited asking myself how I was going to handle this situation. I really did not want to punched by Dizzy Gillespie.\n\n...Soon Dizzy came to our table. I let the other four at the table introduce themeselves first. Then as I had decided not to introduce myself immediately, I said a few things like: \"I am very happy to meet you at last. It has always been my hope to get a chance to do an interview with you. My jazz fans will really appreciate it if I could ask you a few questions on tape. Oh yes, my name is Lowell Johnson from South Africa.\"\n\nWhen he heard my name and country, he clenched his fist and lifted his arm. He really wanted to punch me, but he kept his arm poised and aimed. \"But, but... but you are American!\", he said."
