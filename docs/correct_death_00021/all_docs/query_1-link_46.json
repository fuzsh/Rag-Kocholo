        "text": "Teaneck. Englewood.\n\nTwo communities — two sets of bragging rights. What is Englewood's John Travolta, Dizzy Gillespie or Sugar Hill Gang, next to Teaneck's Ben E. King, Clyde McPhatter or Sarah Jessica Parker? What is Teaneck's Debonair Music Hall, next to Englewood's bergenPAC?\n\nBut there's one bit of fame to which both have a claim. An unspoken bond that, this month, they will speak. Isley.\n\nOn Thursday, June 24, streets in Teaneck and Englewood will get a special dedication in honor of the Rock & Roll Hall of Famers (\"Shout!\" \"Twist & Shout,\" \"It's Your Thing\"), who have roots in both communities.\n\n\"I'm truly grateful and humbled that Teaneck and Englewood, two cities that are so near and dear to me, have chosen to honor the Isley Brothers in this way,\" Ron Isley said.\n\nIn separate ceremonies the same day, a stretch of Van Arsdale Place in Teaneck and a stretch of Liberty Road in Englewood will each be given the same honorary name: The Isley Brothers Way.\n\nIsley is the link — the strand of DNA shared by the communities.\n\n\"We had feelings for both places,\" said Ernie Isley, who once lived on Liberty Road in Englewood. He and his brother Ron, who once lived on Van Arsdale in Teaneck, will be there for the twin re-christening ceremonies at 2 p.m. Thursday at the corner of Van Arsdale and Van Cortlandt Terrace in Teaneck, and then at 3:30 p.m. at the corner of Liberty Road and Greenleaf Avenue in Englewood.\n\n\"This is something very special to Ernie, me and the whole Isley family, and something we don't take for granted,\" Ron Isley said (neither brother lives in New Jersey now).\n\nPolice shootings: Podcast looks back at Teaneck's crisis — and forward at America's\n\nHappy summer!: A guide to 9 summer activities perfect for family fun in North Jersey\n\nCelebrity news: Jake Bongiovi, son of Jon Bon Jovi, dating actress Millie Bobby Brown\n\nThursday's events are about more than just honoring a musical dynasty with two Grammys, four top-10 Billboard singles,16 top-40 albums, and an astonishing 50-year career that changed the course of other careers — including the Beatles (\"Twist & Shout\" was one of their first hits) and John Belushi (\"Shout!\" was what the frat brothers in \"Animal House\" toga-partied to).\n\nThe two Thursday ceremonies are also, in the view of some, a hands-across-the-municipalities gesture — the beginning of a new era of cooperation between the two communities.\n\n\"This is another way to seamlessly bring the communities together,\" said Englewood Mayor Michael Wildes.\n\nWildes has his own six-degrees connection with the Isleys: His father, attorney Leon Wildes, once represented John Lennon. He knows, from his proximity to the Beatles, their respect for the Isleys. \"Even the Beatles tipped their hat to the Isley Brothers,\" he said.\n\nHis counterpart in Teaneck, Mayor James Dunleavy, is looking forward to partnering with him.\n\n\"Certainly we can share the Isley Brothers just as the world has shared the Isley Brothers,\" Dunleavy said.\n\nThe big day\n\nBoth mayors will be on hand for the ceremonies Thursday, along with producer Chris Brancato (\"Godfather of Harlem\") and other notables from both communities. State Assemblyman Gordon Johnson, county Sheriff Anthony Cureton, pastor Edward Spencer IV of Englewood's Mount Calvary Baptist Church, and former Isley band members will speak. A resolution from Gov. Phil Murphy will be read. And the latest Isleys hit, 2021's \"Friends and Family\" (with Snoop Dogg), will probably get played. And played.\n\n\"They're gonna play the heck out of that song,\" Teaneck Planning Board member Darryl Greene said.\n\nThe presence of such heavy-hitters, from both sides of the Teaneck-Englewood divide, is a telling sign. It suggests that the two communities — which have an element of rivalry as well as mutual appreciation in their relationship — might take this cooperative venture as a starting point.\n\nAlready there are \"mutual aid agreements,\" as far as firefighting and policing, between the city of Englewood and the township of Teaneck; other \"shared services\" are at least being being talked about. Having two streets — non-contiguous — named after the Isleys is another gesture in that direction, Greene believes.\n\n\"This opens up the political doors for us to discuss working together; it plants a seed,\" said Greene, the prime mover who got Teaneck's street-naming project to the finish line.\n\n\"It presents us with an opportunity to collaborate on other potential things,\" said Englewood Councilman-at-large Charles Cobb, who did the follow-through in his city.\n\nBorders, anyway, are for maps. They didn't exist for the Isleys, who moved easily between the two municipalities.\n\nProfessionally speaking, there are seven Isleys. Ernie, Marvin (deceased), O'Kelly (deceased) and Chris Jasper represent the Englewood Isleys. Ron and Rudolph represent the Teaneck Isleys. The seventh Isley, Vernon, died in Cincinnati in 1955.\n\nAt first the family was centered in Englewood, said Ernie, who arrived in 1960 at the age of 8. But soon after, Rudolph and Ron, who were older, made tracks to neighboring Teaneck. Rudolph moved to Irvington Road; Ron to Van Arsdale, just around the block.\n\n\"To go from our house in Englewood to Ronald and Rudolph's house in Teaneck was no more than a 15-minute walk,\" Ernie said.\n\nTeaneck was to become indelibly associated with the Isleys because of Ron's label, T-Neck Records.\n\n\"It's Your Thing\" and many other Isley hits appeared on that label. In Teaneck, that was one of the strong arguments for naming a street after the Isleys. It was T-Neck that put Teaneck on the map, worldwide.\n\n\"People around the world know about Teaneck, by way of the Isley Brothers,\" Ernie said. \"We were selling millions of records with that label. Later on, I heard that some of the kids in Teaneck used to peel the T-Neck label off the records and put it in their notebooks, or cut it out from the albums and have it hanging in their rooms.\"\n\nTeaneck or Englewood — if it was an Isley house, there was always bound to be something going on. Neighbors remember the Isleys as friendly, approachable — just your average, ordinary superstars next door, who constantly appeared on TV and pumped out hit after hit.\n\nEveryday people\n\n\"They were everyday people like we were,\" recalled Connie Robertson-Gailes, who lived on Van Arsdale in the 1960s, at the same time as Ronald.\n\nRon Isley had the only pool in the neighborhood, she recalled. And all the kids were welcome.\n\n\"I learned to swim in his pool.\" Robertson-Gailes said. \"I was sitting on the diving board and something caught my attention and I looked and fell off the board. When I came up, my father and Ronald Isley were standing by the edge of the pool and my father told me to kick my feet and move my arms. That's where I learned to swim.\"\n\nThe story continues below the gallery.\n\nWhen a new Isleys tune was about to be released, the sound — from Ron's house — would fill the block. \"All the kids on the block knew all the songs and all the lyrics before they were released,\" said another Van Arsdale neighbor of the time, Kim McClow Stewart.\n\nMeanwhile, 15 minutes away at Ernie's house in Englewood, things were also lively.\n\nFor one thing, Mother Isley — Sallye Bernice Isley — gave piano lessons from that address, so pupils were trooping in and out. Then there was a houseguest. From 1963 to 1965, a young guy, a backup guitarist for the Isleys, was a boarder. Talented youngster. \"Jimmy\" Hendrix, he called himself then.\n\n\"I had never heard or seen anybody play guitar like him,\" recalled Ernie, only 11 or 12 at the time. \"He'd play anything and everything. The guitar was a yo-yo to him. He would come into the kitchen and give a soundtrack to drinking orange juice. You had to be there to see it. He'd play something original while drinking orange juice, and pause while he was drinking, and the guitar was still making a sound.\"\n\nA few years later, in 1967, when the first Jimi Hendrix studio album, \"Are You Experienced?\" came out, Ernie was able to tell his friends at Dwight Morrow High School that yes, he was — definitely. \"I was experienced before the record came out,\" he said.\n\nBut, of course, the Isleys' influence extended far beyond their own circle. They were a key influence on a fledgling band of Liverpudlians who were causing a sensation with their covers of \"Shout!\" and \"Twist & Shout.\"\n\n\"I happened to meet Paul McCartney,\" Ernie recalled. That was at a gig in New York state. \"He grabbed me and gave me a bear hug and practically cut my wind off. He said, 'Ernie, if it wasn't for the Isley Brothers, the Beatles would still be in Liverpool.' And then he said that onstage.\"\n\nMore recently, in 2019, the Isleys had a profound impact on a longtime Teaneck resident named Ira Buckman.\n\nNot an obvious Isleys fan, as he himself would point out: He's an Orthodox Jew. But music transcends all barriers, he believes. \"Music is all about joy,\" he said. \"If there is joy in the music, all the other differences — geographic, ethnic — melt away.\"\n\nWatching \"Animal House\" one night, and seeing Bluto, Otter and their pals boogieing down to \"Shout!\" Buckman vowed that the town of Teaneck should honor the home-grown musicians who had given the world such pleasure. And he made his point in the most direct way possible: by going to a Township Council meeting, holding his cellphone up to a mic, and playing \"Shout!\" for the assembled councilmembers. \"A song is worth a thousand words,\" he said.\n\nBuckman carried the day. But that still left the question of which street should be named after the Isleys. He didn't know where they had lived. So he created a Facebook group to solicit more information.\n\nThat's how he met Robertson-Gailes and Stewart, and learned about the house on Van Arsdale. Their two households, the Isleys and a third family named the Ellerbes were like a commune, Stewart said.\n\n\"We were always in each other's homes,\" she said.\n\nCOVID temporarily put the kibosh on the street-naming plans. It was Greene who got the idea independently and followed through. As a former A&R man, he was able to work out a date for the ceremony with the Isleys' management. As a Teaneck Planning Board member, he was able to get a proclamation that every June 24 would be Isley Brothers Day.\n\nOn board\n\nBut ideas, like brush fires, are hard to contain. This one quickly spread to neighboring Englewood. After all, they had Isleys, too.\n\n\"Everybody loves the Isley Brothers,\" Greene said. \"Everybody wanted in on a celebration honoring them.\"\n\nGreene reached out to Wildes, the mayor. Meanwhile, an Englewood school board member, Angela David, connected him to Cobb, the Englewood City Council president. Cobb got the city engineer to reach out to the county — Englewood's Liberty Road is under county jurisdiction, unlike Van Arsdale, which is Teaneck property. \"He got a response right away from the folks in the county,\" Cobb said. \"It's all about relationships.\"\n\nThursday is the Isleys' day. New signs on Liberty and Van Arsdale will proudly bear their name. People will celebrate their hits, consider their legacy.\n\nAnd perhaps, too, they'll consider music. The thing that can be a bridge between brothers, cultures — even towns.\n\n\"This is a way for us to share in the glory and success of citizens that frequented both communities,\" Wildes said.\n\nJim Beckerman is an entertainment and culture reporter for NorthJersey.com.
