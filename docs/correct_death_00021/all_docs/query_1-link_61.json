        "text": "Jon Faddis is best known as a leading jazz trumpeter, but it’s likely that many fans of rock, funk, disco, pop, reggae and Latin music have heard his playing countless times over the years.\n\nThat’s Faddis playing trumpet on Paul Simon’s “You Can Call Me Al,” James Brown’s “Get On the Good Foot” and Sister Sledge’s “We Are Family.”\n\nDitto on Lou Reed’s “Sally Can’t Dance,” Chic’s “Everybody Dance” and Grover Washington’s “Mr. Magic.”\n\nThat’s in addition to the albums this New Jersey-based trumpet great has performed on by Tina Turner, Bo Diddley, Peter Tosh, Eric Clapton, Aretha Franklin, Mick Jagger, Mongo Santamaria, Diana Ross, Billy Joel, Luther Vandross, Bananarama and many more.\n\n“Don’t forget ‘YMCA’ by the Village People!” Faddis said with a laugh.\n\nHe headlines Thursday’s Godfathers of Latin Jazz: A Tribute to Dizzy Gillespie & Chano Pozo concert at the San Diego Symphony’s Bayside Summer Nights. It will be Faddis’ first San Diego area performance since his 1999 Escondido show with his Carnegie Hall Jazz Orchestra .\n\n“I was pretty much doing pop and jazz (recording) sessions simultaneously in the 1970s and early ’80s, which is when I really got my own thing going,” Faddis continued.\n\n“When I moved to New York in 1971, I started hanging out with (fellow trumpeter) Lew Soloff, who was doing a lot of studio work. Next thing I knew, people were calling me to do studio gigs, so I just fell into it. I did a lot of studio dates until the early 1980s.”\n\nEven if had he never branched out from jazz, Faddis would still boast a heady musical résumé.\n\nThe Oakland native was just 15 when he sat in with his idol, bebop trumpet king Dizzy Gillespie, for whom he later served as musical director. Faddis was not yet 18 when he joined famed vibraphonist Lionel Hampton’s big band, a position that prompted his move to New York.\n\nSoon after arriving in the Big Apple, Faddis was hired by the Thad Jones/Mel Lewis Orchestra, with which he performed across the country and around the world. By the end of 1974, he had released his first solo album and played trumpet on at least 45 other albums, including by such modern jazz pioneers as McCoy Tyner and Charles Mingus, whose band at the time also featured saxophonist Charles McPherson (who is now a San Diego resident).\n\nGillespie was so impressed by Faddis’ command of the trumpet that he once declared: “He’s the best ever, including me!”\n\nFaddis was especially close to Gillespie and former San Diego saxophonist James Moody. He worked regularly with both until Gillespie’s death in 1993 and Moody’s death here in 2010 at the age of 85.\n\n“An enduring lesson I learned from them was when Moody was in his 60s and said to Dizzy: ‘Man, I wish I played the piano and could understand everything you’ve been telling me about music all these years’,” Faddis recalled..\n\n’ And Dizzy said: ‘You’re not dead!’ So Moody found somebody in San Diego to start teaching him piano. That, to me, sums up the philosophy I learned from Moody and Dizzy — to always keep trying to get better.”\n\nA walking encyclopedia on Gillespie’s music and singular legacy, Faddis led last year’s all-star Gillespie tribute concert at the nearly 18,000-capacity Hollywood Bowl. In San Diego, he’ll be teaming with the Gilbert Castellanos-led KSDS Jazz Orchestra and guest soloists Justo Almario on saxophone and Charlie Chavez on percussion.\n\nTogether, they’ll pay tribute to the propulsive Cu-bop style that launched the Latin jazz movement after Gillespie and Cuban percussion master Chano Pozo teamed up in 1947. Their repertoire will include “Manteca,” “Groovin’ High,” “Tanga” and other classics.\n\n“When Dizzy played Cu-bop, it was — to me — the greatest Dizzy of all time,” said Faddis, who teaches jazz at New York State University’s Purchase College and lives in New Jersey with his attorney wife and their son.\n\n“I can’t wait to get to San Diego. The concert will be really fun and I hear there’s a great new place to eat mole!”\n\nGodfathers of Latin Jazz: A Tribute to Dizzy Gillespie and Chano Pozo, featuring Jon Faddis, with the KSDS Jazz Orchestra, directed by Gilbert Castellanos\n\nWhen: 7:30 Thursday, July 26\n\nWhere: San Diego Symphony Bayside Summer Pops, Embarcadero Marina Park South, 200 Marina Park Way, downtown\n\nTickets: $18-$69, plus service charges\n\nPhone: (619) 235-0804\n\nOnline: sandiegosymphony.org\n\ngeorge.varga@sduniontribune.com\n\nTwitter @georgevarga"
