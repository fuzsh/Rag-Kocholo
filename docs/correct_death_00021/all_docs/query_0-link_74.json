        "text": "Dizzy Gillespie\n\nDIZZY GILLESPIE - BRIEF OVERVIEW:\n\nBorn: October 21, 1917, Cheraw, South Carolina\n\nDied: January 6, 1993, Englewood, New Jersey\n\nDizzy Gillespie was born John Birks Gillespie in 1917. He was one of the most influential jazz artists of all time, although he was infamous for many things, such as his bent bell horn and how he puffed his cheeks so far out it almost looked impossible. Dizzy was a nice guy that just about everybody liked. He played with some of the greatest jazz artists ever, including Arturo Sandoval, Machito, Lee Morgan, Miles Davis, Sonny Rollins, Sonny Stitt, and his main partner Charlie Parker. Dizzy and Charlie created a new style of music in the early 1940's called be-bop. One example of be-bop is the song \"Koko\". It's incredibly fast, and the bands were a lot smaller than swing bands. Be-bop wasn't the only type of jazz that Dizzy played. He was without a doubt the greatest latin jazz trumpeter ever, and he also played in big bands. He had his own big band in the mid 50's. Some members in the band were Lee Morgan (who was 15 when he joined) on trumpet, Benny Golson on tenor saxophone (he also composed a lot of the band's music), Chano Pozo on percussion, and Melba Litson on trombone. Melba also arranged a lot of the band's music.\n\nOne of Dizzy's greatest albums was \"Afro-Cuban Jazz Moods\" with Machito. It was a latin jazz album, that had only four songs in about 32 minutes. The best track on the album was probably number one, \"Oro, Incienso y Mirra\". It was almost sixteen minutes long (it took up about half the album's time), and featured both Dizzy and his keyboard player, Chico O' Farrill (Chico also composed and arranged the music for the album).\n\nLike everybody, Dizzy experienced many deaths of friends during his career; Charlie Parker died in 1953, Clifford Brown died in 1956, and Miles Davis died in 1991. He helped Arturo Sandoval leave Cuba to come to America. Like Dexter Gordon and Herbie Hancock in the movie \"'Round Midnight\", Dizzy was seen on tv. Dizzy was featured on an episode of \"The Cosby Show\". He played an elementery band director who was supposed to help Bill's daughter play clarinet for a concert. He was also mentioned in a large number of other films. Charles S. Dutton played Dizzy in \"For Love or Country: The Arturo Sandoval Story\" with Andy Garcia as Arturo Sandoval. He was also played by Samuel E. Wright in Clint Eastwood's \"Bird\" with Forest Whitaker as Charlie Parker.\n\nWhen Dizzy died in 1993, there were few great jazz artists still living. Among the few who were still playing were vibraphonist Milt Jackson, bassist Percy Heath, and organ player Jimmy Smith. Today, there are artists who are similar to Dizzy, or even play his music. Arturo Sandoval made the soundtrack to the movie \"For Love or Country\" in 2000 and featured Dizzy's \"Manteca\", \"Night in Tunisia\", and a song called \"Blues for Diz\", which he dedicated to Dizzy.\n\nSelected Discography (In Order of Release Date):\n\n1.
