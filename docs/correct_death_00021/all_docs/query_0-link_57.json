In April 2003, a group of concerned citizens, headed by Englewood resident Frank Huttle III, formed bergenPAC and developed a business plan to forge a true public/private partnership, engaging all sectors of the community and bringing together corporations, governments and residents, each adding the committment and support necessary to revitalize this unique arts center.\n\nThe Englewood Library is dedicated to providing information, education, culture and inspiration. The town encourages the community to pursue lifelong learning and the enjoyment of books, programs and resources in a variety of formats.\n\nDepartment of Parks & Recreation offers a vaiety of parks and activities.Babe Ruth Field (Tryon Avenue), Cambridge Avenue Park (Cambridge Ave. & Knickerbocker), Crystal Lake (Sheffield Avenue), Denning Park (Lafayette Place & Forest Avenue), Depot Square Park (Demarest Avenue), Durie Park, Garrity Field, Glenbrook Park, Hudson Avenue Park, Morris Park, Trumbull Park, Tryon Ave. Pool, Winton White Stadium, and Mackay Park.\n\nLittle League (for children ages 8 to 12) is run by parent volunteers & sponsored by local businesses."
