Despite huge expectations, major studio backing and an unlimited budget, after three weeks the production collapsed. This documentary presents Inferno's incredible expressionistic original rushes, screen tests, and on-location footage, whilst also reconstructing Clouzot's original vision, and shedding light on the ill-fated endeavor through interviews, dramatizations of unfilmed scenes, and Clouzot's own notes.",

        "text": "Romy Schneider Retrospective #1\n\nImagine you are a film archivist who gets stuck in an elevator. The lift wont go up, it wont go down.You are trapped between floors and there is no way to get out. You press the emergency button and a tinny voice replies that someone is on the way to fix it. Who knows how long that will take!\n\nYou look up and take stock of your fellow occupant. She is an elderly woman, rather refined looking. You can see vestiges of the beautiful young person she must have been. You suspect that she once possessed a face with gentle lines as though inked by a fine quill. There is a twinkle in her eyes too,…\n\nLong-unseen footage from Clouzot's lost masterpiece, the unfinished L'enfer (1964), is brought back to life through the efforts of director Serge Bromberg, who came across the subject after being trapped in an elevator with Clouzot's widow. The incredible footage is a gift to cinema, though the documentary that frames it is not without faults.\n\nIt does a fine job of illustrating the breakdown of the production, framing Clouzot as a director who, like his American counterpart Hitchcock, employed careful planning, storyboards and clockwork precision. But when Clouzot finally receives the attention of Hollywood and is given carte blanche, he becomes lost in his own obsession for perfection; shooting and reshooting scenes that were already in the can and putting his…\n\nFirst viewing: April 2010\n\nFirst review:\n\nAmazing film about the madness of a director. Henri-Georges Clouzot was making the film and had an unlimited budget, an excellent crew, and top actors, yet the film still went completely wrong and was never released. Serge Bromberg takes the original footage, goes behind the scenes and has actors Jacques Gamblin and Bérénice Bejo act out unfilmed scenes straight from the script. Since I have a keen interest in Clouzot's work, I was thrilled to see this film. However, if you'd like to know more about this adventurous director who pushed the limits of cinema and was a true auteur, I would suggest you check it out.\n\nSecond viewing: April 23, 2018\n\nSecond review:…\n\nMislabeled here on Letterboxd, because this documentary about the making of Henri-Georges Clouzot's unfinished 1964 film L'enfer was made in 2009, and is a film on its own. Yes, it contains a lot of footage from the original film, but it is first and foremost a documentary on how the film came about, the wild ideas that Clouzot had on how to portray the mental state of his protagonist, how he received carte blanche from the American producers, how he got entangled in his own perfectionism, and how the film finally had to be abandoned after the lead actor left, his replacement walked off the set after four days, and Clouzot himself suffered a cardiac episode.\n\nLuckily, Clouzot left us…\n\nFascinates chiefly in how it challenges your perception of the ways in which we fail to compartmentalise film, tricking our eyes into divorcing the elements that make it so and distancing the bigger picture from the messiness of process under the inherent guise of movie magic. Which is to say, chances are had Clouzot’s film existed in any complete and wholly viewable form, I would simply have watched it, considered it neat and moved on with my life.\n\nAs is, with the benefit of the what-if’s and could-have-beens, it transforms into this larger than life object taking on the mythical quality of the unknown and letting our imagination fill in the blanks into this fantasy that transcends beyond the relative…"
