        "meta_description": "French postcard by Editions P.I., Paris, nr. 492. Photo: Lucienne Chevert.\n\t\n\tBrazilian born French actress and screenwriter <b>Véra Clouzot</b> (1913-1960) only appeared in three films. They were all directed by her husband, French master of suspense Henri-Georges Clouzot. Despite her very short career, she starred in such unforgettable classics as <i>Le Salaire de la Peur/The Wages of Fear</i> (1953) and <i>Les Diaboliques/Diabolique</i> (1955).  \n\t\n\tVéra (also Vera) Clouzot was born as Véra Gibson-Amado in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in 1913. She was the daughter of one of Brazil's most notorious political figures, Gilberto Amado. Amado was a congressman, writer, journalist and lawyer, and the ex-President of the United Nations' International Law Committee. In 1915, he shot to death fellow writer and poet Aníbal Teóphilo in an official ceremony at the Jornal do Commercio for disagreeing with his opinions on literature. Amado was acquitted. His daughter met in 1941 the French actor Leo Laparé. He was a member of the theatre company of Louis Jouvet, which happened to be on tour in Rio de Janeiro. They married shortly after and she then joined the company for a tour in South America that lasted for nearly four years. After the Second World War they returned to France and Vera settled in Paris. Louis Jouvet took over the direction of the Athenaeum Theatre and he continued to give Véra small roles. In 1947, Laparelle played a role in Quai des Orfevres/Quay of the Goldsmiths (1947, Henri-Georges Clouzot). When Véra met the director on the set it was a ‘coup de foudre’:  love at first sight. He hired her as a script girl for his next film Miquette et sa mere/Miquette and her mother (1949, Henri-Georges Clouzot). Vera divorced Laparé, and in 1950 she married Clouzot.\n\t\n\tVéra Clouzot would play the female lead in the next film of her husband, Le Salaire de la Peur/The Wages of Fear (1953, Henri-Georges Clouzot) and the film made him known as ‘the French Hitchcock’. Her co-stars in this magnificent thriller (#166 in IMDb’s Top 250) were Charles Vanel and Yves Montand. They played Frenchmen stranded in South-America, who are hired to transport an urgent nitroglycerine shipment without the equipment that would make it safe. Clouzot did her own stunts in the film, which included getting on a moving truck and being pushed away to the ground. On IMDb reviewer Dennis Littrell writes about her performance: “Véra Clouzot plays Linda who first appears scrubbing the floor in an open-air bistro. She is rather extraordinary herself, finely made up and creamy white like a star of the silent film era. She grovels a lot, especially for Mario (Montand). She provides the counter-point, the contrast for the testosterone action of the movie.” At AllMovie Hal Erickson adds about the film: “The first half of the film slowly, methodically introduces the characters and their motivations. The second half -- the drive itself -- is a relentless, goosebump-inducing assault on the audience's senses.” Le Salaire de la Peur was the winner of the Grand Prix at the Cannes Festival.\n\t\n\tVéra Clouzot’s most famous film was undoubtedly her next film, Les Diaboliques/Diabolique (1955, Henri-Georges Clouzot). This horror thriller (#179 in IMDb’s Top 250) was an adaptation of a novel by Pierre Boileau and Thomas Narcejac, on whose novel D'Entre Les Morts Alfred Hitchcock later based Vertigo (1958). Clouzot played the long-suffering invalid wife of a cruel headmaster (Paul Meurisse). She conspires with his mistress (Simone Signoret) to kill him. After the murder is committed, his body disappears, and strange events begin to plague the two women. Véra Clouzot then appeared in a supporting part in her husband’s next film, Les espions/The Spies (1957, Henri-Georges Clouzot), starring Curd Jürgens and Peter Ustinov. She played a mute mental patient in this parody of espionage and political ideology set in a nursing home. It would be the last film in which she could be seen. However she contributed to another film of her husband. She co-wrote the script for La vérité/The Truth (1960, Henri-Georges Clouzot). In this film Brigitte Bardot plays a girl on trial for the murder of her lover. In 1960 Véra Clouzot suddenly died of a heart attack in Paris. A morbid detail was that her character in Les Diaboliques had died the same way. Véra Clouzot was only 47. In 1977 Hollywood remade Le Salaire de la Peur as Sorcerer (1977, William Friedkin) and in 1996 followed a Hollywood remake of Les Diaboliques, Diabolique (1996, Jeremiah S. Chechik) with Sharon Stone as the mistress and Isabelle Adjani in Véra Clouzot’s role. However, both remakes could not stand in the shadow of the original versions.\n\t\n\tSources:  Hal Erickson (AllMovie), John Jameson (IMDb), Wikipedia and IMDb.",
