        "text": "Outline plans for a new high quality residential development to the north of Darlington are set to go on show to local people next week.\n\nBanks Property, part of the County Durham-headquartered Banks Group, is introducing new proposals for up to 350 family homes in the Beaumont Hill area of the town.\n\nThe scheme would be located on a 17-hectare site to the south of the River Skerne, between the A167 and the East Coast mainline, and would also include an affordable housing allocation, substantial areas of public open space and facilities such as a shop or café.\n\nBanks Property will be hosting an initial community event between 3pm and 7pm on Thursday 11 July at Whessoe Parish Hall on Harrowgate Hill to introduce its plans to local residents, answer their questions and gather their input on the different aspects of the proposal.\n\nInformation and ideas shared with the project team will be assessed in the development of the planning application that the company is hoping to submit to Darlington Borough Council before the end of the year.\n\nBanks Property is hoping to have its planning application considered by the Borough Council early in the New Year, with a view, if it is approved, to commencing work on site by 2021.\n\nThe family-owned firm has worked in and around Darlington on a wide range of schemes over many years, with recent landmark schemes include the Moor House wind farm near Barmpton and two residential developments in Hurworth.\n\nLewis Stokes, community relations manager at The Banks Group, says: “Our vision for this project is to deliver high quality residential housing development at a scale which is appropriate to its setting and we want to involve the local community in helping us do this at the earliest possible opportunity.\n\n“As well as helping to address the clear need to increase the available supply of quality homes right across North East England, this scheme will also deliver a wide range of economic, employment, social, supply chain and environmental benefits to the wider area, and we’re keen to get the widest possible cross-section of local people along to our event to talk about what we’re looking to do.\n\n“The Banks Group has worked across the North East of England on a range of successful projects for more than 43 years, and we’re looking forward to revealing the detail of our ideas for Beaumont Hill.”"
