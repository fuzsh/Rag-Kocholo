        "text": "LNER has unveiled a virtual video showing how Darlington Station will look following a multi-million-pound transformation.\n\nDarlington Station’s £140m overhaul will include two new platforms on the eastern side of the station, a new multi-storey car park for more than 650 cars and a transport interchange and gateway entrance connected to Central Park.\n\nThe redevelopment is being delivered in partnership by the Tees Valley Mayor and Combined Authority, LNER, Network Rail and Darlington Borough Council.\n\nSteve Wilson, Head of Stations at LNER, said: “We’re delighted to be able to share this virtual video commissioned by LNER which demonstrates how the project will give Darlington a station it can be proud of. It’s particularly fitting that the work being carried out to transform Darlington Station is due to complete towards the end of 2025, when a nationwide celebration is taking place to mark 200 years since the opening of the Stockton and Darlington Railway in 1825 – a journey that truly changed the world.”\n\nTees Valley Mayor Ben Houchen said: “It’s high time Darlington had a modern gateway deserving of its rising status and we’ve led the way in getting this project built. This flythrough shows just how big the overhaul is – and how we’re honouring the existing station with a vibrant entrance hall and two crucial new platforms. We’re creating thousands of new job opportunities in the town and across the wider region, and this work is vital to cut journey times, ensure we get more services both here and further afield, and improve access to these jobs.”\n\nStuart Calvert, Capital Delivery director for Network Rail’s Eastern region, said: “It’s really exciting to see this new fly-through animation which shows the scale of our multi-million-pound project to transform Darlington station for passengers. Our engineers are well underway with work on the platforms and our track upgrades are due to start in the coming months. The virtual video gives a real sense of what will be a once-in-a-generation station redevelopment.”\n\nCouncillor Stephen Harker, Leader of Darlington Borough Council, said: “This video shows the impressive results of the extensive work that is ongoing at the station. I am sure residents are as excited as me to see the finished station and to join in the 200 year celebrations of the Stockton and Darlington railway in 2025.”"
