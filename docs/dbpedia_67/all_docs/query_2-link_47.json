        "text": "The Darlington County School District (DCSD) Hall of Fame honors those individuals who have graduated from or worked at DCSD schools and made substantial or significant contributions at the local, regional, national, or international levels in areas such as academia and education, arts, athletics, business, media, public service, philanthropy, medicine, military, or science. This also includes former educators who enhanced our community and contributed to the success of countless students through their years as DCSD employees.\n\nEligibility\n\nDCSD GRADUATES must have graduated from a current or former DCSD high school a minimum of seven (7) years before the year of nomination.\n\nFormer DCSD EMPLOYEES must have been employed by the school district for at least ten years. They must not have worked for the DCSD in the two (2) years before the nomination.\n\nCurrent elected officials (i.e., City Council members, legislators, and other political office holders) are ineligible for consideration; however, former elected officials may be nominated only if they graduated from or worked FOR the DCSD and meet the eligibility requirements for that group.\n\nSelection Criteria\n\nThe nominator must demonstrate, using the DCSD Hall of Fame nomination form, that the nominee has made a substantial or significant contribution(s) at the local, regional, national, or international levels in any appropriate area of endeavor such as, but not limited to, academia and education, arts, business, media, public service, philanthropy, medicine, military, science, or athletics.\n\nThe nominator must demonstrate, using the DCSD Hall of Fame nomination form, that the nominee exemplifies honesty, integrity, trustworthiness, and other evidence of good character.\n\nOnce nominated, a person will remain on the nomination list for two (2) years. After this time, if not elected to the DCSD Hall of Fame, they will roll off of the nominations list. They may be re-nominated at any time after leaving the list.\n\nNominations for posthumous awards will be accepted.\n\nOnly complete nominations will be considered; nominators must provide details about those aspects that make the nominee worthy of induction.\n\nApplication\n\nThe link to the application can be found by clicking HERE or by scanning the this QR code below."
