        "text": "Facts:\n\nThis is an application for leave to appeal a number of points of law arising out of two separate arbitration agreements. The awards, one of Malcolm Spence QC, published on 6th December 2002, and the other of Mr Christopher Cochrane QC, published on 3rd February 2003, were made under a statutory disputes resolution procedure contained in regulation 19 of the Local Government Changes for England (Property Transfer and Transitional Payments) Regulations 1995. They arise out of the establishment of Darlington Borough Council as a separate unitary authority effected by The Durham (Borough of Darlington) (Structural Change) Order 1995, made by the Secretary of State pursuant to powers contained in the Local Government Act 1992. The order provides that with effect from 1st April 1997 the functions of Durham County Council in relation to the borough of Darlington should, subject to the provisions of Part II of the order and any other relevant provision, be transferred to Darlington Council.\n\nIssues:\n\nWhether the conclusions of Mr Spence and Mr Cochrane are open to serious doubt and whether the conditions for leave to appeal are satisfied.\n\nRules:\n\nSection 69(3) of the Arbitration Act 1996\n\nAnalysis:\n\nVarious conditions must be satisfied if leave to appeal is to be given. These being arbitrations, those conditions are set out in section 69(3) of the Arbitration Act 1996. The broad reason for that is that these questions arise out of the construction of statutory provisions - regulations - made under powers contained in the Local Government Act 1992. They remain in force and they can be applied to future structural changes under the Act. Counsel for Durham County Council argued that Mr Spence's conclusion in those paragraphs is open to serious doubt. However, the court held that the conclusions of Mr Spence are not open to serious doubt. On the other hand, Mr Cochrane's conclusion that the reference in regulation 17(3)(a) to, \"the notice setting out the calculations giving rise to the liability to pay,\" is a reference to the regulation 14 notice and not the regulation 16 notice, and that the regulation 16 notice does no more than effectively retrospectively amend the regulation 14 notice, is open to serious doubt. The alternative basis for his decision on this was that, in any event, section 49(3) of the Arbitration Act comes to the rescue in that if he was wrong about the proper approach to regulation 16 there was a lacuna which could be filled by the Arbitration Act.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThe court held that the award in that regard is open to serious doubt in his holding that the land was surplus land and, in the circumstances, must always have been surplus land. The application for costs to be assessed in detail in relation to the questions upon which your Lordship has held against me was granted."
