        "text": "We run two recycling schemes.\n\nMost homes have a recycling bin and in most cases we ask you to put your recycling at the front of your property.\n\nThis includes if you are on scheme B and have asked us to swap your recycling caddy and bag for a wheeled bin.\n\nWhat's my collection date and scheme?\n\nWhat can I recycle?\n\nBatteries\n\nBatteries should never be put in bins as they can cause fires. Many batteries are built into devices such as scooters, phones and vapes and they all need safely disposing of. Lithium iron batteries are widely used as they are light and contain more energy, but this makes them more dangerous. Fires caused by lithium iron batteries are self sustaining and very hard to put out\n\nIf batteries are thrown away with general rubbish they are crushed in the bin wagon which causes highly flammable chemicals to leak out and fires can start either in the wagon or at the treatment plant. One serious fire a day is caused in the UK because of batteries.\n\nMany shops have battery recycling collection points or you can take them to the tip and recycling centre on Whessoe Road.\n\nFind your nearest battery recycling centre.\n\nHelp the planet\n\nCheck out our zero waste map to find shops and businesses around Darlington that encourage us to reduce, reuse and recycle.\n\nRecycle Now has produced a handy recycling tracker which lets you search for places to recycle all sorts of items close to where you live. Recycle Now recycling locator [external link].\n\nResponsible recycling\n\nThe majority of material we collect if reprocessed in this county - paper and card may go abroad depending on market conditions.\n\nWe can't collect everything we would like to as the UK does not have the infrastructure to recycle all the waste we produce.\n\nFor example there are lots of different types and grades of plastic – we will only collect higher quality plastics that can be recycled in the UK. We ask you to put the other ‘problem plastics’, which can’t be treated in the UK, in your general rubbish bin.\n\nWe feel this is better than sending them abroad where we can't control what happens to it.\n\nChanging times\n\nSometimes we have to change what items we can collect to recycle and this is because recycling is a market and the value of items goes up and down.\n\nFor example, years ago recycling companies wanted to buy black plastic from us so we collected it from you.\n\nHowever, the black plastic market stopped making money and the company we work with stopped taking black plastic for recycling.\n\nInstead, they separated the black plastic from the other high quality plastics and sent it to a plant down south to turn it into fuel.\n\nThere is a fuel plant very close to Darlington, so it made more sense to stop sending our black plastic to a company miles away when we could do it close to home.\n\nThat’s why we asked you to stop putting black plastic in your recycling bin.\n\nThis is just one example of how changing markets in recycling affect what we will ask you to collect.\n\nFrequently asked questions"
