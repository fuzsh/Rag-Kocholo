        "text": "DARLINGTON TOWNSHIP (KDKA) â€” Governor Josh Shapiro announced $1 million will be coming to parts of Lawrence and Beaver counties.\n\nHis office said it's a result of holding Norfolk Southern accountable for the train derailment in Ohio earlier this year.\n\nCommunity leaders hope this money can be used to help restore the damages that occurred in areas in Darlington Township and Lawrence County after the derailment almost six months ago.\n\nAccording to Lawrence County Board of Commissioner Chairman Dan Vogler, the money is pretty open-ended as to how it can be spent. They were told it was to benefit the residents and businesses in the area. The board is looking to give its $340,000 share to Little Beaver Township and Enon Valley.\n\n\"Their local officials, the borough council, the township supervisors. They know what's needed in their respective communities and they will be able to use those dollars accordingly,\" Vogler said.\n\nA third group, the Lawrence County Conservation District, is also expected to get some of the money.\n\n\"Our hope is they will be able to use some of these dollars for the balance of the county that may have been affected by the derailment,\" Vogler said.\n\nThe remainder is going to Darlington Township in Beaver County. Leaders there say they plan to hold the money in an account that helps them walk the path of recovery. For people living in the impacted areas, the money is welcomed, but they are unsure what it can do.\n\n\"I don't know 'cause they did a lot of damage,\" Arthur Stear of Darlington said.\n\n\"It's a disaster. What are you going to do,\" Vic Augostine of Darlington said.\n\nThe governor's office says this money is part of a multi-million-dollar commitment between the state and Norfolk Southern. The state continues to test for contamination. But to this point, it has seen nothing.\n\n\"It's prudent that ongoing testing takes place just to be sure,\" Vogler said.\n\nCommunity leaders hope there can be more payments down the road, to not only restore trust but to fix what was damaged during that train derailment."
