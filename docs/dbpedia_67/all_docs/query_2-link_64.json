        "text": "DARLINGTON, S.C. -- Darlington County Council voted not to renew the contract of County Administrator Dale Surrett on Monday night during their monthly meeting.\n\nCouncil voted 5 – 2 with one abstention not to renew Surrett’s employment contract with the county for another year.\n\nMembers voting against renewing the contract were Robbin Brock of Hartsville, Bobby Hudson of Lamar, Dannie Douglas of Society Hill, Mozella “Pennie” Nicholson and Robert L. “Bobby” Kilgo Jr. of Darlington. Chairman Wesley Blackwell of Hartsville and Le Flowers of Darlington voted to extend the contract for another year. Councilwoman Wilhelmina Johnson abstained.\n\nAfter the decision, Surrett, who appeared stunned, had little to say. He said he was surprised by council’s action and said he will consult an attorney to see what his options are. He declined further comment.\n\nThe vote came after a nearly 40-minute closed executive session.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nSeveral council members have been critical of Surrett in recent months. A move to deny him a contract renewal last year failed.\n\nHudson offered a motion not to renew the contract. He later reworded it as a motion to renew and voted against it.\n\nAn earlier motion to adjourn immediately after the closed session failed.\n\nJohnson offered a motion to amend the original motion by delaying action on the contract to give council members time to prepare a list of their grievances against Surrett and then to set a date to sit down with him and see if the issues could be resolved. That motion failed on a tied vote of 4 – 4 with Hudson, Brock, Douglas and Nicholson voting against it, and Kilgo, Flowers, Blackwell and Johnson voting for it.\n\nSurrett has been Darlington County administrator since January 2011. Council hired him in December 2010.\n\nHe came to Darlington County from Oconee County where he was administrator there.\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\n* I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy."
