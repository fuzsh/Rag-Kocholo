        "text": "We have invested more than £500m in regenerating the old steelworks site in Redcar. £250m of that is borrowed, and will have to be repaid by taxpayers.\n\nThe good news is: there are profits to be had on that investment.\n\nThe bad news is: under the current mayor, 90% of those profits have been given away - for literally nothing - to favoured private sector partners. That's around £1bn in profits which could - and should - have been funding local councils. Instead, it's disappearing into the pockets of a few well-connected businessmen.\n\nThis is, undeniably, a scandal.\n\nBut we don't have to just accept it.\n\nIf I am elected mayor, I will regain those profits for local taxpayers and ensure that all future regeneration work is done exclusively to public benefit.\n\nThe way to do that is via a mayoral Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL).\n\nA CIL is a charge which is levied on developers who build on public Development Corporation land (such as STDC).\n\nIt recognises that a large amount of investment in public infrastructure has been made, or will be made, in the redevelopment area – which will directly benefit the developers concerned.\n\nIn the case of STDC, the major external benefits which developers enjoy are the remediation of the toxic site itself (with the public taking on all the risk), the investments in transport infrastructure, and subsidised training programmes.\n\nThe charge will not be paid by Teesworks Ltd. Unfortunately, they will still be able to buy each parcel of remediated land (if they want to – no obligation!) for a knock-down price.\n\nInstead, it will be paid by the end client, who actually builds a factory or other facility on the site.\n\nThis will take revenue away from Teesworks Ltd, and instead redirect it to where it should always have been going – to TVCA and henceforth the local authorities of the Tees Valley.\n\nHere’s an example:\n\nUnder the current arrangement, 100% of the money paid by the end client goes to Teesworks Ltd. Let’s say that for a given parcel of land, that’s £100mn.\n\nUnder my proposal, the CIL will take a portion of that £100mn (the exact percentage will have to be carefully calculated to avoid legal challenge). The end client will still pay £100mn, but split between Teesworks Ltd and TVCA."
