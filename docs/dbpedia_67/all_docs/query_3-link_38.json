Many people are taking on more caring responsibilities for their relatives and friends who are disabled, ill or older and who need support. Each year, Carers Rights Day helps us:\n\nensure carers are aware of their rights\n\nlet carers know where to get help and support\n\nraise awareness of the needs of carers.\n\nThis year's Carers Rights Day campaign will focus on raising awareness of the rights that unpaid carers have. The pandemic has had a massive impact on the lives of carers, affecting access to services, the ability to juggle work and care and much more. That's why it’s more important than ever that carers are aware of what they have the right to.\n\nWhy being aware of your rights is so important\n\nIn a recent survey of nearly 6,000 carers, we found:\n\nFour in five unpaid carers are providing more care for relatives\n\n78% reported that the needs of the person they care for have increased during the pandemic\n\nTwo thirds (67%) worried about how they will cope through further lockdowns or local restrictions.\n\nCarers need to know their rights wherever they are in their caring journey: whether they are in the workplace, in a healthcare setting, when interacting with professionals or at home. This Carers Rights Day, we want to empower carers with information and support, so they can feel confident asking for what they need. We also want carers to know how to challenge things when their rights are not being met.\n\nCarers Rights Day 2021 is supported by Barclays LifeSkills\n\nUN Convention on the Right’s of the Child (UNCRC) Awareness survey\n\n25th November 2021\n\nThe Department for Education has launched a survey on Children’s Rights Awareness, aimed at children and young people aged 8-18.\n\nThis survey is a qualitative look at children and young people’s perspectives on their rights, and is part of a wider-scale project which aims to engage with children to allow them to participate in the conversation around the UN Children’s Rights Convention on the Child.\n\nhttps://dferesearch.fra1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_2rDPDZNw7NJ8qiy\n\n16 days of action 2021\n\n15th November 2021\n\nLearning Events\n\nThe 16 Days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence is an annual international campaign that commences on 25 November, the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women, and runs until 10 December, Human Rights Day.\n\nDuring the 16 days of Action, specialist providers would like to invite you to participate in a series of online learning events which are aimed at increasing professional understanding of domestic abuse, sexual violence, honour based violence & sexual exploitation.\n\nTuesday 23 November: 1:30 – 2:30 (in advance of the 16 days programme) Halo Project and IDAS\n\nInsight into honour based abuse (HBA) and coercive control experienced by black and minoritised victims and survivors.

Public trust and conﬁdence in gambling has declined and there is significant public concern about the visibility of gambling and the impact this may have on children, young people and others who might be vulnerable.\n\n“Although gambling is considered a legitimate leisure activity, it must be licensed and regulated to ensure consumers and the wider public are protected.\n\n“The council recognises the role it plays in minimising the harmful effects gambling may have and we want to hear your views on the new Gambling Policy.”\n\nJoy Allen, Police and Crime Commissioner for County Durham and Darlington said:\n\n“Gambling harm can have a devastating impact on victims, businesses and on the lives and families of those who commit crime to support gambling or to pay off gambling-related debts. I welcome this approach and depth of understanding shown by Darlington Borough Council around some of the hidden harms associated with gambling as they seek public’s views on their new gambling policy.\n\n“We have already had a number of positive discussions on how we can work together to reduce gambling related harm and crime. I look forward to working in partnership with the council, public health, gambling businesses, and experts by experience to make fast progress to reduce the harm caused by gambling in Darlington and prevent associated crime, homelessness, domestic abuse, child neglect and suicides.”\n\nThe revised policy will be introduced in January 2022 as part of a three-year review cycle. There are few amendments as there have been no legislative changes in the last three years, but the views of the public are now being sought for consideration before the new policy is implemented.\n\nYou can view the proposed policy online at www.darlington.gov.uk/gambling. You have until 19 September 2021 to share your views – you can do this by emailing licensing@darlington.gov.uk or you can contact Colin Dobson, licensing manager on 01325 405988.\n\nIf you require information, advice and support for anyone harmed by gambling, GamCare can be contacted free on 0808 820 133 or by visiting its website at www.gamcare.org.uk\n\nDomestic Abuse Accommodation Needs Assessment Interviews\n\n01st September 2021\n\nDarlington Borough Council is undertaking a Domestic Abuse Accommodation Needs Assessment as per requirements outlined in the Domestic Abuse Act (April 2021).\n\nAs part of this work, they have commissioned RRR Consultancy to undertake interviews with people who have experienced domestic abuse. The aim of the interviews is to help us better understand the accommodation needs of domestic abuse survivors, barriers to provision, what works, and what could be improved.\n\nThey are particularly keen to ensure that the work reflects the needs of people with disabilities.\n\nThe interviews would be undertaken by telephone, and are likely to last between 30 and 45 minutes.\n\nAs a 'Thank You' for taking part, a £30 High Street voucher will be given to all interviewees.\n\nThey do not require any personal details of the interviewees except a first name and contact number. Although the results of the interviews will be summarised in a report, the anonymity of the interviewee will be maintained at all times.\n\nInformation Sheet - provides further details about the interviews.\n\nState of Caring 2021 survey\n\n01st September 2021\n\nCarersUK are currently running our State of Caring survey 2021 and we need your help to encourage carers to take part.\n\nThe survey is the UK’s most comprehensive research into the lives and experience of carers and many professionals who work with carers find the results provide a useful evidence base for their work locally. We want to understand carers’ priorities for the future and what support they need to help recover from the pandemic, and to create a positive legacy for the future. We will use the evidence to continue to campaign for carers to get better support.\n\nOver the last year, our research and responses to our surveys have helped us to highlight carers’ experiences across the UK and helped us campaign successfully for better guidance, testing for carers, PPE for unpaid carers, carers' 'support bubbles' and exemptions to allow carers to get a break.\n\nState of Caring Survey 2021\n\nThe survey will close on 13 September and we will be releasing a research report in November.\n\nIf you have any questions about the research, please get in touch with our policy team by emailing policy@carersuk.org.\n\nDomestic abuse services\n\n11th August 2021\n\nPart of the current domestic abuse needs assessment data gathering process involves gathering the voice of survivors/victims. This is proving to be quite a challenge however it is essential in identifying gaps in provision and developing a strategy that is survivor led and relevant to the needs of our community.\n\nBronwyn Lilley, DBC Domestic Abuse Commissioning Officer, would be most grateful you could complete the survey as a survivor or an agency who works with survivors who have required domestic abuse services. This is regardless of whether you were able to access services or not – this way they can identify the gaps. The Act focuses on domestic abuse services within ‘relevant accommodation’ however it would be useful to have an understanding of services broadly as well as those offered within relevant accommodation.\n\nPolice and Crime Plan Consultation\n\n10th August 2021\n\nThe role of the Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC) is designed to be the link between the public and the policing service which is delivered on their behalf. PCCs are elected by the public to hold Chief Constables and the Force to account, effectively making the police answerable to the communities they serve. A key role for PCCs is representing and engaging with local communities to help deliver their policing priorities.\n\nPCC Joy Allen has produced the Police and Crime plan for her term in office over the next three years that sets out her priorities for local policing for County Durham and Darlington.\n\nThe Police and Crime Plan is now out for consultation with local communities. By answering the survey, you will be able to have your say on local policing in your area.\n\nThe survey can be found here: https://www.surveymonkey.co.uk/r/VS3KTX9\n\nThe overarching priorities from now until 2024 are:\n\n· Safer Communities\n\n· Safer Business\n\n· Safer Online\n\n· Safer People\n\n· Safer Roads\n\n· Safer Countryside\n\nYou can read the draft plan here\n\nPaper versions and support to complete on line are both available\n\nIMPACT: IMProving Adult Care Together\n\n10th June 2021\n\nIMPACT stands for ‘Improving Adult Care Together’.

It also helps people who don't think of themselves as having caring responsibilities to identify as carers and access much-needed support.\n\nThis year, carers across the country are continuing to face new challenges as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Many people are taking on more caring responsibilities for their relatives and friends who are disabled, ill or older and who need support.\n\nThey need to be recognised for the difficulties they are experiencing, respected for all they are doing, and provided with information, support and understanding. So during Carers Week, we're coming together to help Make Caring Visible and Valued.\n\nFor more information about Carers Week you can follow the link\n\nhttps://www.carersweek.org/about-carers-week/\n\nDo you care for a child with a neurodevelopment need?\n\n07th June 2021\n\nIf you live in Darlington, Middlesbrough or Redcar and Cleveland, Contact's Listening Ear Service can provide free emotional support, practical advice or strategies to help you cope.\n\nYou can book a telephone appointment with a family support advisor using this link contact-tees@eventbrite.co.uk\n\nFind out more by emailing south.tees@contact.org.uk or phoning their free phone number 0800 2540890\n\nVolunteer week\n\n27th May 2021\n\nVolunteers’ Week - 1st - 7th June 2021 a time to say thanks.\n\nVolunteers’ Week 2021 is a time to say thanks.

During an exceptionally difficult year, people from all walks of life around the UK have taken the time to volunteer and make a huge difference to their communities – just as they do every year. This is a time for us to come together and thank all volunteers for their invaluable contribution.\n\nThis 37th annual Volunteers’ Week is taking place during the #MonthofCommunity.\n\nWe would like to say a huge thank you to all our amazing volunteers, who have been supporting our work over the last year.\n\nInitially volunteers were making deliveries of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) as we went into the first national lockdown and later included delivery of activity packs, sunflower growing in kits, Christmas crafts and most recently bird feeder activity packs.\n\nVolunteers also helped make up packages of PPE ready for delivery and helped put activity packs together.\n\nThese deliveries have been vital to disabled people in Darlington to keep themselves and others safe and providing fun activities to pass the time, during a time when it is not possible to meet friends and family and do the things people would normally do.\n\nAs we headed towards summer volunteers helped clean and sort play equipment into individual packs, so that children and young people accessing our DASH Play Scheme had use of their own set of toys and equipment.\n\nVolunteers have also provided their help to DASH and Darlington’s People’s Parliament to help run face to face and online sessions.\n\nWe very much value and appreciate the roles our volunteers play as DAD continues to support disabled people and carers throughout this pandemic and beyond.\n\nSo, on behalf of everyone at DAD and disabled people in Darlington, thank you for all you have done and continue to do!\n\n#VolunteersWeek!\n\nWe need your nominations!\n\n26th May 2021\n\nFor the third year running, Ecclesiastical Insurance Group is giving away £1million to charities with the return of its Movement for Good awards and DAD has been nominated by one of our supporters.\n\nFrom today, people can nominate a cause close to their hearts for a potential £1,000 award to help make a difference.\n\nThis year, 500 charities will each receive £1,000 during the first phase of the campaign. A second phase of giving will happen later this summer.\n\nThe nomination process is open until 13 June. Winners will be drawn at random and the more times we are nominated the more chance we have of being selected.\n\nThank you in advance.\n\nhttps://www.movementforgood.com/\n\nGIVE THEM WINGS The Autobiography of Paul Hodgson\n\n13th May 2021\n\nPaul is someone who has been involved with DAD for some years.
