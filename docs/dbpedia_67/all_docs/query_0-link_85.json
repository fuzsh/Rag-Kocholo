        "text": "Number Forty is open from 21:00 to 03:00 every Friday and Saturday as a safe space for people out and about in Darlington. The BBC joined its volunteers for a Saturday night shift.\n\nThe windows glow warmly on to the cold dark street, a beam of light casting out from the open door.\n\nBeyond the frosted glass, volunteers Hannah, Katie and James sit in the lounge while security guard Jason stands by the entrance, all ready for whatever the night may bring.\n\nSince opening in September, Number Forty has had more than 230 \"incidents\" - the catch-all term used to describe everything from people popping in to charge mobile phones to victims of crime and those in genuine crisis seeking help.\n\nTheir tales are always told discreetly, no names or identifying features, and when they laugh it is always done so with kindness.\n\nThey recall the various bodily fluids they have been confronted with, the humorous things inebriated visitors have said and the compassionate care they have had to give those in nightmarish situations.\n\nLike the young man who came in after taking hundreds of tablets, or the woman who was dared by her friends to drink plant food.\n\n\"We get a lot of people who have been abandoned by their friends on a night out,\" Hannah says.\n\nKatie adds: \"Mental health is a big issue as well, we get people here who need help and we do what we can.\"\n\nThere was the woman who came in with a suitcase crammed with her possessions having fled what she was convinced was her haunted home, and the soldier from Catterick who had lost all his personal effects and friends on a night out and had nowhere else to go.\n\nOne night a woman came in with her teenage daughter just to show her that this was the place to go if ever she needed somewhere safe on a night out.\n\nNumber Forty was set up by Durham Police and Darlington Borough Council as part of the Safer Streets initiative, a nationwide drive to tackle violence against women.\n\nOther towns and cities may have similar schemes, such as teams of people who walk the streets handing out help and bottles of water to worse-for-wear revellers, but this is a first for Darlington and one of the first such hubs in the North East.\n\nAnyone is welcome at Number Forty, in particular those who feel vulnerable, unwell or have been a victim of crime.\n\nJason is there to protect those inside the centre, both volunteers and visitors, not to keep people out.\n\nHe says the first few hours are typically quiet with things getting livelier after midnight.\n\nWhile things are quiet Hannah shows me the store room where there are piles of rubber clogs and flip-flops for partied-out feet, anti-spiking kits and tests, bottles of water, woolly hats and plastic ponchos, whatever a visitor may need.\n\nThe first hour or two are spent standing outside, watching as people walk along Skinnergate to and from the various pubs, bars and restaurants in Darlington town centre on this cold but dry February night.\n\nShortly after 23:00, while we are watching the passers-by and listening to the thuds of music and shouts and laughter further down the street, a small car pulls up and a young woman gets out.\n\nShe approaches us and, holding up a phone showing a picture of her and another woman, asks if her wife has been in.\n\nShe is concerned, she says, as her wife went out with friends from work hours ago but has not been heard from her for several hours and her phone appears to be off.\n\nThe woman's worry seems to grow when we tell her no-one has been in yet, but Hannah and Katie, who during the day both work for Durham Police in a civilian capacity, are quick to offer reassurance.\n\nJason offers advice on which establishment such a group is likely to have gone to, Hannah takes down the woman's details in case her wife does arrive and tells her where she can find the police in the town centre.\n\nThe woman drives off and we hear no more about it again, a hopeful sign that all ended well.\n\nAnother lull allows me to talk to James, who is usually a sales manager for a timber company and a DJ.\n\nHis clubbing days are over, he says, and now his sons are at an age where they are starting to go out.\n\n\"I just wanted to give something back to the town,\" he says about his decision to start volunteering.\n\nThere are about 30 volunteers who each give at least one night a month up to be at Number Forty.\n\nJust after midnight Jade walks in.\n\nShe is in her early-30s, wearing ripped jeans and sparkly high-heeled shoes, and says she wants to charge her phone.\n\nShe has read about this place on Facebook, she says, and proceeds to settle herself down on one of the blue sofas as her phone charges.\n\n\"It's nice to have this here,\" she says, adding: \"It's a real comfort, it feels like home already.\"\n\nShe wraps herself in one of the handmade blankets the centre has, and tells us about her life, her work, children and her husband.\n\nAt 02:30 Dan comes in, smartly dressed in a blue designer jacket and jeans.\n\nHe has been out with friends but has been turned away from a nightclub door by bouncers for being too drunk.\n\n\"To be honest I was relieved they wouldn't let me in as I'd had enough by then,\" he says with a laugh, sipping from a bottle of water.\n\nHe joins John and Jade, who has been out to get chips to share.\n\nDan uses the toilet, misses the bowl and insists on mopping it up, proceeding to clean the whole of the already pristinely kept bathroom.\n\nAs we near 03:00 and closing time, John and Dan head home after giving the volunteers reassurances they would be all right.\n\nJade heads off in a taxi called by James.\n\nShe leaves a couple of pounds to \"buy the volunteers some chocolate\" and promises to share the post about Number 40 on Facebook.\n\n\"It's really good here,\" she says, adding: \"I don't know what people would do without it.\"\n\nThe names of those visiting Number 40 have been changed.\n\nIf you have been affected by issues raised in this article, there is information and support available via the BBC Action Line."
