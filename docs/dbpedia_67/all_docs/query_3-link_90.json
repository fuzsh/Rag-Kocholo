        "text": "A new Argos store is set to open at a Hampshire Sainsbury's store at the end of this month.\n\nA section of the Sainsbury's store in Leigh Road, Eastleigh has been closed off as the company prepares to open the new Argos store inside.\n\nA large sign saying 'Argos Coming Soon' in Red letters can be seen outside the closed-off area.\n\nSainsbury's bought the brand in 2016 as part of a £1.4 billion takeover.\n\nAn Argos spokesperson said: “At the end of this month, a brand-new Argos store will open inside Sainsbury’s Eastleigh.\n\n\"By bringing together the much-loved brands of Sainsbury’s and Argos under the one roof, our customers will be able to enjoy more convenience and choice with the option to choose from thousands of Argos products while picking up their groceries.”\n\nIn 2022 the company announced that it had reached a \"significant stage\" in its plans as it opened its 400th Argos store inside its supermarkets, meaning that more than half of all Argos stores were located inside Sainsbury's stores.\n\nArgos is a technology-led business – its website is the third most visited of any UK retailer and 90% of Argos sales now originate online.\n\nThe new stores in Sainsbury’s stores allow customers to benefit from Argos’s market-leading Fast Track delivery and collection service, giving them the option to order products for same day collection from store in as little as four hours.\n\nCustomers can also use tablets in the digital Pay@Browse area, enabling them to choose and purchase what they want quickly and conveniently instore.\n\nSainsbury's has been approached for more information."
