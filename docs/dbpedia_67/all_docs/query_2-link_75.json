        "text": "Details of the opening two stages of this year’s Lloyds Bank Tour of Britain Men have today been announced, marking 40 days to go until the 20th edition of Britain’s biggest professional bike race gets underway in Scotland.\n\nAlmost 5,000 metres of climbing across the first two stages await the peloton, in what will be one of the hardest openings to the race in Lloyds Bank Tour of Britain history.\n\nStage one on Tuesday 3 September in the Scottish Borders, will be a 181.9-kilometre (113.1-mile) spectator friendly route, starting and finishing in Kelso, passing through Coldstream, Gordon, Melrose, Denholm, Jedburgh and St Boswells.\n\nThe route features two loops, enabling spectators in Kelso and Melrose, and on the categorised King of the Mountains climbs at Scott’s View and Dingleton, to see the race in action twice, with the final climb coming 23 kilometres from the finish of the stage.\n\nA day later (Wednesday 4 September), the Lloyds Bank Tour of Britain Men heads to Darlington for the first time since 2009, for a 152-kilometre (94 miles) stage through the Tees Valley and North Yorkshire to Redcar.\n\nThe stage crosses the Cleveland Hills and heads through the North York Moors National Park to the coast at Robin Hood’s Bay via a series of short, sharp climbs.\n\nTurning north via Whitby, the stage climbs Lythe Bank and the peloton will tackle the iconic Saltburn Bank twice, the latter ascent coming within the final ten kilometres of racing.\n\nAbout Stage One\n\nFrom Kelso the opening stage will first head east alongside the River Tweed to Coldstream, turning north and west via Greenlaw, Gordon and Smailholm to the first ascent of the scenic viewpoint of Scott’s View.\n\nThe 2.5 kilometre climb averages 2.5%, and is followed within 10 kilometres by the tougher 6.2% average gradient of the two-kilometre King of the Mountains climb of Dingleton, in the Eildon Hills above Melrose.\n\nThe route continues south to Denholm, climbing the day’s third King of the Mountains climb at Dunion Hill (three kilometres at 5.4%) and descending into Jedburgh before returning to Kelso alongside the River Teviot.\n\nRiders will then repeat the intermediate sprint in Melrose and the King of the Mountains climbs at Scott’s View and Dingleton, the latter coming with just under 23 kilometres of racing remaining, to set up a thrilling chase back to the cobbled finish in the centre of Kelso.\n\nThe stage will also feature three intermediate sprints, where time bonuses and points for the sprinters jersey are available, the first coming in Melrose after 75 kilometres of racing, and the second in Kelso (128km) on the first passage of the finish line with just over an hour of the stage remaining. The Melrose sprint will then be tackled for a second time after 156 kilometres.\n\nCommenting on the route, Lloyds Bank Tour of Britain Men Race Director Rod Ellingworth said:\n\n\"The Scottish Borders has a long history with the Lloyds Bank Tour of Britain Men and so we are delighted to have worked with our partners at Scottish Borders Council to come up with this spectator friendly, and challenging route, for the riders.\n\n\"With five categorised climbs this will be a tough opening stage, and is by no means certain to end in a sprint, so should set up a thrilling battle between the sprinters and those riders who believe the final climb at Dingleton can be a launchpad to victory in Kelso.”\n\nCouncillor Scott Hamilton, Scottish Borders Council’s Executive Member for Community and Business Development, said:\n\n“The route for the Scottish Borders stage of this year’s Lloyds Bank Tour of Britain Men is superb and will be a fantastic advert for the Scottish Borders and cycling in the region. It is especially exciting to have the element of a loop through Kelso, the iconic viewpoint at Scott’s View and Melrose, giving spectators the opportunity to see the race on multiple occasions.\n\nWe look forward to welcoming visitors from across the country to enjoy not only some world class cycling, but also our brilliant local businesses and additional activities and events that we are planning.”\n\nPaul Bush OBE, VisitScotland Director of Events, said:\n\n“The Scottish Borders have a strong history of hosting the Lloyds Bank Tour of Britain Men, and it will once again provide the perfect stage for the start of this year’s race.\n\n“Set against the backdrop of some of Scotland’s most iconic and spectacular locations and countryside, the two loops featured in the opening stage route will give spectators plenty of great places to get out and watch the 20th edition of Britain’s biggest professional bike race.\n\n“Scotland is one of the best places in the world to experience events and EventScotland is proud to be supporting of the Lloyds Bank Tour of Britain Men.”\n\nAbout Stage Two\n\nThe peloton will depart from Darlington 15 years on from the last stage start in the town (2009), heading east through Middleton St George and onto Eaglescliffe and Yarm for stage two of the Lloyds Bank Tour of Britain Men, with an intermediate sprint at Stokesley, before winding its way into the North York Moors National Park.\n\nHeading east the route tackles a series of unclassified climbs around Commondale, Castleton, and Danby, before the first King of the Mountains climb above Ugglebarnby, averaging over 8% across its one-kilometre length.\n\nThe race then drops down to Robin Hood’s Bay, to tackle the second climb rising up Raw Pasture Bank from almost sea level at an average of 7.5%, the route then heading on north past Whitby Abbey to descend into the famous North Yorkshire seaside town.\n\nStage two’s final categorised climb is the 1.7 kilometres of Lythe Bank, averaging 7.7% as it ascends from Sandsend, ultimately taking the race past Staithes into Redcar & Cleveland, where it will tackle a lap made up of many of the roads used in June’s Lloyds Bank British National Road Race Championships, won by Ethan Hayter (INEOS Grenadiers).\n\nThe lap allows for two ascents of Saltburn Bank, the 300-metre climb averaging over 14%, but including a section at 22% could prove a springboard for the winning move, with the top inside the final ten kilometres.\n\nAfter over 2,500 metres of ascent in the stage, the final few kilometres alongside the North Sea between Marske-by-the-Sea and Redcar will offer some respite, but the exposed nature of Coast Road means that the wind could pose a final challenge to overcome in the home stretch to Zetland Park.\n\nCommenting on the stage, Lloyds Bank Tour of Britain Men Race Director Rod Ellingworth said:\n\n\"The tough opening to this year's Lloyds Bank Tour of Britain Men intensifies on stage two with another day that is relentless up and down as we cross the Tees Valley and the North York Moors National Park. Two years ago, the climbs in this area provided decisive in the race and we are sure they will once again shape the overall general classification battle.\n\n\"Thanks to our partners across the Tees Valley, in Darlington, Stockton, and Redcar & Cleveland, plus stakeholders in North Yorkshire, we have put together a route that showcases some fantastic moorland and coastal scenery, while also providing plenty of opportunities for attacking and entertaining riding. I've no doubt that the closing kilometres of racing, with the double ascent of Saltburn Bank, will be among the most spectacular in this year's Lloyds Bank Tour of Britain Men.\"\n\nTees Valley Mayor Ben Houchen said:\n\n“From Darlington town centre to Yarm High Street and from Saltburn Bank to Redcar seafront, we are blessed with fantastic cycling locations and the Tour of Britain will be a superb showcase for our area.\n\n“We look forward to welcoming some of the world’s best cyclists as they take on this challenging route - and also the major benefits the Tour will bring to our great local businesses.\"\n\nCouncillor Libby McCollom, Darlington Borough Council’s Cabinet member for Local Services, said:\n\n“Following on from the success of the Lloyds Bank British National Championships Circuit Race in June, we’re excited to once again be welcoming some of the world’s best cyclists to Darlington for the start of the men’s Tour of Britain this coming September.\n\n“Darlington will provide a perfect backdrop for the start of this stage and we’re looking forward to what promises to be another fantastic event.”\n\nCabinet Member for Climate and Culture at Redcar and Cleveland Borough Council, Cllr Carrie Richardson, said:\n\n“We are absolutely thrilled that the Tour of Britain is making a return and we’re looking forward to welcoming some of the world’s best teams and riders to our borough. The route which will involve a finishing circuit takes in some of our picturesque East Cleveland Villages, rolling countryside and two ascents of Saltburn Bank before finishing on the Coast Road in Redcar ensuring an exciting finale to the stage.\n\n“Redcar and Cleveland has a proud record of hosting major cycling events such as the British National Road Championships which have recently had a great success in our area. This is another prestigious sporting event which we expect to attract many spectator and cycling enthusiasts.”\n\nCouncillor Steve Nelson, Stockton-on-Tees Borough Council’s Cabinet Member for Health, Leisure and Culture, said:\n\n“We are absolutely delighted to be welcoming the Tour of Britain to our Borough. It’s a great opportunity for our residents to see the elite cyclists and their entourage of camera crews and support vehicles as the peloton sweeps through.\n\n“The picturesque areas of Yarm and Eaglescliffe will really show off the Borough as a great place to live, work and play.”\n\nFollowing the opening pair of stages the Lloyds Bank Tour of Britain Men heads to South Yorkshire, the East Midlands, and West Northamptonshire, before concluding in Suffolk on Sunday 8 September after six stages of racing.\n\nMore details of the Lloyds Bank Tour of Britain Men, including the routes of the remaining stages, detailed stage timings and competing teams will be announcing in the coming weeks."
