        "text": "What do governors do?\n\nGovernors support and challenge headteachers by gathering views, asking questions and deciding what is best for the school. They normally serve for a term of office lasting four years.\n\nThe work of governors covers three main roles:\n\nensuring clarity of vision, ethos and strategic direction of the school\n\nholding the headteacher to account for the educational performance of the school and its pupils\n\noverseeing the financial performance of the school and making sure its money is well spent\n\nGoverning bodies sometimes have to make difficult decisions about individual pupils or members of staff, but governors are never expected to work without help and support from others, both from inside the school and out.\n\nWho can be a school governor?\n\nYou must be 18 or over - but you do not need any special qualifications, or to be a parent or staff at the school. Interest, enthusiasm, commitment and fresh ideas are more important!\n\nYou need to be able to devote time to attend meetings and to read papers. The full governing body meets at least once a term, sometimes twice.\n\nYou would probably also sit on one or two committees dealing with matters relating to finance and premises or staffing and curriculum. Governors can also have responsibility for working alongside staff on how literacy or numeracy can be improved at the school.\n\nThe law requires employers to allow employees who hold certain public positions reasonable time off to perform the associated duties (although there is no obligation on an employer to make payment for time off).\n\nTo ensure that governing bodies operate within the law, there are a number of criteria preventing certain persons being appointed as a governor and identity and background checks are carried out to confirm eligibility.\n\nIf you are interested in becoming a school governor at a specific school you should contact the school direct or, if you wish, we can forward your contact details and a brief summary of the skills you can contribute to the local schools who may contact you if they have a vacancy. Alternatively you can apply at the .gov website [external link].\n\nTraining\n\nTraining for governors is ongoing, with many schools and governing bodies ensuring that courses are run to develop governors, introduce them to their new roles and help them understand any specialist areas.\n\nEach school year we run a comprehensive range of training courses, offering guidance, support, information on topical issues and important skills development to help you in your role as a governor. Courses are held at a central venue and time to suit the majority of governors. There are also are online and distance learning options available.\n\nGovernor training programme 2023 - 2024 [pdf document]\n\nTraining course information\n\nInduction training for new governors [pdf document]\n\nPreparing for Ofsted [pdf document]\n\nKeeping children safe in education [pdf document]\n\nSchool improvement and planning [pdf document]\n\nExclusions training [pdf document]\n\nEarly help assessment [pdf document]\n\nHolding to account [pdf document]\n\nSEND and Alternative Education [pdf document]\n\nAdvice and support for new governors is available from schools and the Department for Education at www.gov.uk [external link]."
