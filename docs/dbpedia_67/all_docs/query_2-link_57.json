        "text": "The Darlington Labour Party and Liberal Democrats have agreed a coalition deal to run the council.\n\nThe agreement was announced at the council’s annual meeting on Thursday evening and came three weeks after the local elections on May 4, where Labour emerged as the majority party after winning 24 seats.\n\nHowever, it was short of the 26-seat threshold for a majority and needed to rely on the support from another party.\n\nREAD MORE: Girl, 15, gives birth after court rules doctors could perform C-section against her will\n\nThe party returned to power after four years of Conservative rule, with members saying the latest agreement will “mean stability for Darlington and the effective running of the council”.\n\nThe Conservatives were ousted from power after their performance in 2023 local elections, where they won 15 seats, which was not enough to continue the power-sharing deal it had formed with the Liberal Democrats and Independents.\n\nIn a joint statement, both parties said they will work together to ensure the council strengthens the local economy and communities.\n\nLabour leader, Coun Steve Harker said: “Darlington Labour recognise that whilst we are the largest group on the council we didn’t win an overall majority.\n\n\"It therefore makes sense for us to reach out and work with others. We are pleased the local Liberal Democrats responded well to this. It means, together, we can ensure the best for our town over the next four years.”\n\nBoth parties said the new council administration will involve and engage with residents, businesses, charitable organisations and other political parties – “an approach that will encourage everyone to co-operate for the benefit of Darlington,” the statement added.\n\nLiberal Democrat leader, Coun Anne-Marie Curry said: “We are pleased we can work with Darlington Labour to move forward on shared priorities to improve the town. Working together means we can bring stability and the best for Darlington.”\n\nRead Next:"
