        "text": "Darlington Borough Council has been awarded £443,313 through the Public Sector Decarbonisation Scheme. This money will help Darlington reduce carbon emissions to net zero by 2050.\n\nThe investment will specifically decarbonise the Town Hall and the Hippodrome Theatre. At both buildings gas boilers will be replaced with air source heat pumps. At the Town Hall solar panels will also be installed, and all lighting will be upgraded to energy efficient LED lighting. Energy controls to loading bay areas and catering equipment will be installed at the Hippodrome. This will support the Council to deliver its target of reducing carbon emissions to net zero by 2050."
