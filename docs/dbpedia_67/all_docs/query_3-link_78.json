Report Overview\n\nThe Monthly Neighborhood Offense Statistics is an interactive data visualization of the offenses that are reported to the Portland Police Bureau. This tool is built to provide custom analyses of offense data to interested members of the community, especially as it relates to the Portland neighborhoods. For a more detailed map of the neighborhood boundaries used by the Police Bureau, click here.\n\nOffenses are reported using the National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS) maintained by the FBI. NIBRS provides a comprehensive view of the occurrence of crime by reporting all unique offenses within an incident rather than just the most serious offense. Prior to April 2015, the PPB reported statistics using the Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program’s Summary Reporting System (SRS). The different reporting systems and processes prevent any crime statistics prior to April 2015 from being compared to current NIBRS data. More information on NIBRS.\n\n2. Technical Specifications\n\nThe report has been customized to work on personal computers, smart phones and tablets. For the best experience, it is recommended you use a desktop or laptop computer.\n\nNo additional software is required to use this report. The report runs completely within the internet browser using JavaScript. Most modern browsers automatically activate JavaScript; however, it can be turned off based on the security settings of the computer. For more information on activating JavaScript, refer to the browser’s help section or click here for help on Windows computers and click here for help on Apple computers.\n\n3. Visualization Walkthrough\n\nThe Monthly Neighborhood Offense Statistics is an interactive data visualization. This interactivity allows users to filter the information based on the questions they are hoping to answer with this dataset. An overview of the pre-built filters is included below.\n\na. Date Filter\n\nThe Date Filter is the primary selection tool for the date range. The dropdown filter defaults to the 13 most recent months that data is available. To change the months in view, hit the down arrow to the right of \"(Multiple values)\" and select the check boxes next to the corresponding months and years you would like to view. There is no limit to the number of months; however, the Offense Count by Month chart gets crowded past 14 months.\n\nb. Offense Count by Category\n\nThe table on the left-hand side of the report, Offense Count by Category, provides a detailed listing of the reported frequency of offenses during the selected time period. For more information on the offense, including the definition, hover the mouse over the value (number).\n\nThe table does more than just provide information as it also doubles as a filter. Clicking on the name of a particular offense category, such as Burglary, automatically updates the Frequency Map and Offense Count by Month to show the distribution and frequency of those crimes. Multiple offenses can be selected by dragging the mouse when clicking or holding down the CTRL button on the keyboard when clicking the offenses. TIP: To filter for all offenses in the “Crime Against” category (i.e., Person, Property, or Society) click that label instead of individual offenses.\n\nc. Frequency Map\n\nThe Frequency Map is an outline of all Portland neighborhoods using the Portland Police Bureau boundaries. The map dynamically updates based on selected filters. Darker colors signal a higher number of reported offenses. The minimum and maximum values on the color scale adjust based on the other filters. Hover the mouse over a shape to get basic information about that neighborhood, including its name, coalition, and the count for all selected offenses.\n\nLike the Offense Count by Category view, the map can also be used to filter results in the different tables and charts. To filter statistics by neighborhood, select the neighborhood on the map. Multiple neighborhoods can be selected by dragging the mouse when clicking or holding down the CTRL button on the keyboard when clicking the neighborhoods.\n\nA link is provided to instructions on finding the neighborhood of a specific location on PortlandMaps.com. Use the text box just above the map to highlight the neighborhood’s location on the map.\n\nTIP: Just using the “highlight” function does not filter by that neighborhood. After a neighborhood is highlighted, make sure to click on that neighborhood shape to filter the results.\n\nd. Total Offense Count by Month\n\nThe final view on the main report is the Offense Count by Month bar chart. This chart highlights the total offense count (or, if filtered, the total count of all selected offenses) for all months included in the overall date filter. Like the Frequency Map and Offense Count by Category table, the bar charts can also be used to filter results; select one (or more) months to view the offense and regional breakdown for that month.\n\nTIP: Select more than one month by dragging the mouse when clicking or holding down the CTRL button on the keyboard when clicking the month.\n\ne. Toolbar\n\nThe toolbar, located at the bottom of the visualization, contains several buttons that assist in the analysis of the data.\n\nA. Undo. This button allows the user to go back to a prior option or setting when adjusting filters. It only becomes active when the above filters are applied to the report.\n\nB. Redo. This button allows the user to re-active a filter or selection. It only becomes active when the \"Undo\" button is utilized.\n\nC. Reset. The \"Reset\" button reverts all filters and selections back to their original setting when you first visited the page. This is a great way to restart the analysis after clicking several filters.\n\nD. Share. Clicking the \"Share\" button launches a new window that automatically creates links to share the dashboard with others on the Web and social media.\n\nE. Download. The \"Download\" button allows users to save a static version of the visualization. This option is great for printing out copies of the dashboard to share at meetings or to include in a presentation.\n\n\"Image\" generates a .png file of the report with all of the selections and filters.\n\nThe \"Data\", \"Crosstab\", and \"Tableau Workbook\" options are unavailable for use with the Crime Victimization Dashboard.\n\n\"PDF\" allows users to export the report, with all of the currently selected filters, as a PDF. the options dialogue allows custom scaling and paper size options. For best results, use the default options.\n\nThe \"PowerPoint\" options automatically generates and exports a .pptx file ready for use in Microsoft PowerPoint. The includes a screenshot of the dashboard that can be copied and pasted into any new or existing presentation.\n\nF. Full Screen. This option will enlarge the dashboard to encompass the entire screen of your current device. To exit, press \"Esc\" on your screen or click the button again.\n\nf. Download Data\n\nThe Portland Police Bureau is a proud member of the Police Data Initiative. Open Data provides an opportunity to improve the relationship between the community and the PPB by increasing transparency, building community trust, and strengthening accountability.\n\nThe Download Data tab of this report was custom-built to meet the Bureau’s Open Data goals. To download a copy of the data for custom analyses and presentation, follow these steps:\n\nClick on the Download Data tab at the top of the report.\n\nUse the optional filters to splice and shrink the dataset based on desired parameters.\n\nClick on the “Download” button on the toolbar in the lower-right corner of the report.\n\nClick on “Data.”\n\nA new window will pop-up that shows only the first 200 rows of data. Click on the blue link that says “Download all rows as a text file.\n\nOnce downloaded, the file can be imported to Microsoft Excel or other data analysis programs.\n\nLocation data is only provided to the block level to preserve victim anonymity. Cases deemed sensitive due to the nature of the crime, victim, victim/offender relationship, or investigation status may contain data that cannot be shared openly at this time. Case numbers and specific location information for sensitive cases are not included in the open data. These Case Numbers are signified with an “X” in their title.\n\nTIP: If address information is not required for the desired analysis, click “Crosstab” instead of “Data” under the download tab. This removes a couple of steps, but still preserves all selected filters.\n\nMetadata for Offense Open Data\n\nOffenses are reported using the National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS) maintained by the FBI. NIBRS provides a comprehensive view of the occurrence of crime by reporting all unique offenses within an incident rather than just the most serious offense. Prior to April 2015, the PPB reported statistics using the Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program’s Summary Reporting System (SRS). The different reporting systems and processes prevent any crime statistics prior to April 2015 from being compared to current NIBRS data. More information on NIBRS.\n\nCases deemed sensitive due to the nature of the crime, victim, victim/offender relationship, or investigation status may contain data that cannot be shared openly at this time. Case numbers and specific location information for sensitive cases are not included in the open data."
