        "text": "Darlington, county, northeastern South Carolina, U.S. It lies for the most part on the rolling hills of the Coastal Plain, bounded to the northeast by the Great Pee Dee River and on parts of the southwestern border by the Lynches River.\n\nBaptists from Delaware came to the region in the 1730s and settled in the Welsh Tract settlement granted by King George II of England. Darlington county was established in 1785 and named for Darlington, England. In 1894, when the governor of South Carolina ordered the search without warrants of private homes for concealed liquor, the “Darlington War” between residents and the state militia and constables resulted.\n\nKalmia Gardens, the Coker College arboretum, contains a virtually complete cross section of South Carolina terrain, along with hundreds of varieties of flora native to the Atlantic seaboard. H.B. Robinson Unit 2, the state’s oldest operating nuclear power plant, is located near Hartsville. Darlington is the county seat, and Hartsville, the site of Coker College (founded 1908), is the largest town.\n\nTobacco is the principal crop of this fertile farming region, and soybeans, wheat, eggs, and dairy products also are important. Textile, paper, chemical, and electronic products are leading manufactures. Area 562 square miles (1,456 square km). Pop. (2000) 67,444; (2010) 68,681."
