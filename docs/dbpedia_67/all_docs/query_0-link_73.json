        "text": "More than £900,000 of extra financial support has been provided by Darlington Borough Council to help its most vulnerable residents.\n\nThe council is using part of its £1.3million Government Hardship Fund to reduce council tax bills by £150 for over 6,000 working aged residents who are eligible for the council’s existing Council Tax Support scheme. Revised bills have been sent and funds are in the process of being issued into accounts.\n\nCouncillor Charles Johnson, Cabinet Portfolio holder for Resources said:\n\n“We have a scheme to help people with their council tax who are out of work or on low incomes and we felt that in these very difficult times it would be great to give them some extra help.\n\n“We are busy notifying residents so we are urging people not to contact the Council if you think you are eligible and have not yet been contacted as the money will get to those accounts soon.”\n\nThe rest of the Hardship Fund is being used to support those most in need and is being managed by the Citizens Advice Bureau on behalf of the Council.\n\nCouncillor Johnson said:\n\n“We appreciate more people will need help during the pandemic and if they are having significant challenges with finances I would encourage them to contact CAB for help and advice.”"
