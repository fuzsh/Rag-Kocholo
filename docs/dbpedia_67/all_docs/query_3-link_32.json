        "text": "Why do you use face-to-face fundraisers to raise funds for the British Red Cross?\n\nAs a charity, the British Red Cross has a responsibility to cost effectively raise as much money as we can to fund our vital work in the UK and overseas.\n\nGiven the increased need for our services due to the many crises we’re seeing across the world, it is critical that we have as many different routes as possible for people to support.\n\nFace-to-face fundraising is a vital income stream for the organisation and it’s a cost-effective way to bring new supporters on board.\n\nHundreds of thousands of people have chosen to support us in this way and, each month, their gifts provide an invaluable lifeline to people facing a crisis.\n\nIn addition to the much-needed funding this method provides, it is also a great opportunity to engage on a personal level with people from a diverse range of communities across the UK.\n\nWe are able to update people on our work, let them know how they can help people in crises but also, where appropriate, how they can benefit from our services across the UK.\n\nDo you have a comment about one of our fundraisers? Contact us on 0300 456 1155.\n\nHow do you keep the public and your fundraisers safe?\n\nWe expect the highest standards from our fundraisers and provide them with bespoke training to ensure they are interacting with the public in the best way.\n\nWe monitor our fundraising campaigns closely to ensure that our fundraisers adhere to the Code of Fundraising practice as set out by the Fundraising Regulator, the door-to-door fundraising rulebook as set out by the Chartered Institute of Fundraising, and all relevant legislation.\n\nSince the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, we have continuously monitored the situation, working closely with our fundraising partners to ensure both fundraisers and the public are kept as safe as possible. We continue to follow government and industry guidelines and will make necessary adjustments if required.\n\nHow do you make sure your fundraising is ethical and doesn’t target those in vulnerable circumstances?\n\nThe British Red Cross is committed to treating those who are in vulnerable circumstances fairly and respectfully.\n\nWe have robust training, policies and procedures in place to protect anyone in potentially vulnerable circumstances from inappropriate requests for donations, and to ensure supporters and members of the public are treated with empathy and respect throughout our face-to-face fundraising activities.\n\nOur agency partners are contractually obliged to adhere to these standards and procedures, and we work together to ensure the measures are adhered to through extensive quality monitoring and regular training.\n\nHow do I know if a British Red Cross face-to-face fundraiser is genuine?\n\nAll fundraisers carry our most up-to-date information packs. They’re also easy to recognise:\n\nDoor-to-door fundraisers\n\ncarry a British Red Cross or agency ID card with their name, photo, ID number and details of the agency they work for.\n\nwear a tabard, t-shirt, jacket or gilet with a British Red Cross logo, and carry a letter of authority from the British Red Cross.\n\nPrivate site fundraisers (includes shopping centres, events, retail stores)\n\ndisplay a British Red Cross or agency identification badge with their name, photo, ID number and details of the agency they work for.\n\nfundraise near a British Red Cross-branded stand.\n\nWhere can I find details on where your fundraisers are working?\n\nFrom 29 July 2024 to 1 September 2024 we will be fundraising in:\n\nEngland:\n\nYorkshire: No fundraising locations for this period.\n\nNorth West: Allerdale Borough Council, Carlisle City Council.\n\nNorth East: Blyth Valley Borough Council, Darlington Borough Council, North Tyneside Metropolitan Council.\n\nWest Midlands: Birmingham City Council, Dudley Metropolitan Borough Council, Telford and Wrekin.\n\nEast Midlands: Hinckley & Bosworth District Council, East Northamptonshire Council.\n\nWest: No fundraising locations for this period.\n\nEast: Brentwood Borough Council, Castle Point Council, Tendring District Council, North Norfolk District Council, Luton Borough Council, Stevenage Borough Council.\n\nSouth: No fundraising locations for this period.\n\nSouth West: Bristol City Council, East Devon District Council, Mendip District Council, South Gloucestershire District Council, Swindon Borough Council, Cornwall Council (Restormel area), West Berkshire Council.\n\nSouth East: No fundraising locations for this period.\n\nLondon: Newham Council, Redbridge, Havering, Kensington & Chelsea, London Borough of Barnet, Wandsworth, Hillingdon, Harrow Council, Hounslow Council, Hammersmith & Fulham Council, London Borough of Brent.\n\nEnglish Channel: No fundraising locations for this period.\n\nScotland: No fundraising locations for this period.\n\nWales: Vale of Glamorgan.\n\nNorthern Ireland: Falkirk Council, Perth & Kinross Council, Edinburgh City Council, Highland Council.\n\nOur fundraisers work all over the UK.
