        "text": "DARLINGTON, S.C. – The Darlington County Council made quick work of a light agenda Monday night as it advanced part of the solar farms related to fees in lieu of ad valorem taxes, but it slowed the progress of an ordinance requiring county department heads to reside inside the county.\n\nThe council passed a second reading of an ordinance that would set a flat fee in lieu of annual property taxes for 17 proposed properties for the purpose of creating solar farms at different locations around the county.\n\nThe council also expanded the jurisdiction boundaries of the Florence-Darlington Industrial Park to include the leased tracts of land in several locations.\n\n>> Block 058 includes three of the projects: 1634 Solar, Madison Solar and Middleton Solar projects. The Jefferson Solar project is in an adjacent block 57.\n\n>> B&K Solar has eight tracts in block 53.\n\n>> Culpepper Solar has six tracts in block 117 and two tracts in the adjacent 116.\n\n>> Fairfield Solar has nine tracts in block 011.\n\n>> Rollins Solar has four tracts in block 80, two in tract 102 and one in block 103.\n\nSingle tract fees range from $2.5 million to approximately $6.7 million; the larger multiple tract projects could see fees in excess of $80 million. All fees would be spread over a period of up to 20 years.\n\nIf all 17 projects come to fruition, the sum total of fees would be $303,536,000 over the assigned period of years.\n\nThe rationale from the business point of view is that it is more advantageous to pay the same amount each year in the first couple of decades than have to worry about property tax increases over the same time period.\n\nThe council also amended a previous agreement with Florence County related to the shared Darlington-Florence Industrial Park. The park will expand to include the 17 listed properties, which in turn would promote economic development and employment and investment opportunities within the two counties, according to the amendment.\n\nBoth items passed with little fanfare.\n\nIn other business, Robert Kilgo Jr. motioned to carry over an ordinance pertaining to the residency requirement for county department heads.\n\n“I just wasn’t ready to vote on it yet,” he said after the meeting. “I think it needs a little more work. I haven’t had a chance to do that, and maybe between now and January I’ll be able to do that.”\n\nKilgo said there wasn’t anything particular. He just wants to spend the extra time.\n\nThis ordinance would completely abolish previous ordinances that required department heads to reside in Darlington County.\n\nThe county also is collecting citizen responses to several public meetings about the potential of building a new courthouse. A report is expected soon."
