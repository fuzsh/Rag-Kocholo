        "text": "Advice from Met Police came as teenagers were in court in other parts of Britain for alleged public order offences\n\nNicholas Cecil, Political Editor @ nicholascecil1 day ago\n\nLondon parents were told on Wednesday to know where their children are so they do not get caught up in riots.\n\nThe advice came from the Metropolitan Police amid fears that violent far-right protests could erupt in the capital on Wednesday evening.\n\nDeputy Assistant Commissioner Andy Valentine said: “Our thanks goes to Londoners who condemn the hateful and divisive behaviour which is fuelling significant concern among our communities.\n\n“Everyone can play a role by not sharing inflammatory online speculation and giving our officers space to undertake their important duties.\n\n“We also ask parents to think carefully about where their children are today and in coming days.\n\n“No-one wants to be caught up in potentially violent and criminal behaviour.”\n\nHe added: “It is our privilege to be part of a city pulling together at an uncertain time.\n\n“You will see more officers on patrol. If you are concerned, or need help, speak to them. They are there to help.”\n\nHis message came after several teenagers or men in their early 20s appeared in courts in other parts of the country following violence in other towns and cities.\n\nA number of suspected rioters appeared before a district judge at Teesside Magistrates’ Court.\n\nCharlie Bullock, 21, was described as “the main instigator” of a large group pushing against a police line during riots in Middlesbrough, as he admitted throwing stones and rocks at officers.\n\nCole Stewart, 18, who was seen “celebrating” after throwing an object which hit a police officer during riots in Darlington, Co Durham, also pleaded guilty to violent disorder at the same court.\n\nHeather Blair, prosecuting, said an officer “felt a sharp blow to his wrist” from an object believed to be thrown by Stewart, who was then seen “celebrating with his arms in the air”.\n\nRead More\n\nLondon MPs warn locals of far-Right protest plots with four boroughs on 'list'\n\nHundreds gather in counter-protest as Met Police brace for far-right disorder - LIVE\n\nMPs told to consider home working ahead of possible violent disorder in London\n\nSponsored\n\nWhy Sportopia at Selfridges should be on your radar this summer\n\nBrandon Welch, 18, who is accused of using racist language and encouraging people to smash up property while live-streaming the Darlington riot on TikTok, did not enter a plea to a charge of violent disorder.\n\nIn Plymouth, five people have appeared in court charged with violent disorder following a protest in the port city on Monday night which saw police officers injured and two members of the public taken to hospital.\n\nOne of them was a 17-year-old boy admitted throwing a traffic cone and a rock towards a large group of protesters.\n\nA 16-year-old boy, of no registered address, will appear in Newcastle-under-Lyme Magistrates’ Court in Stoke-on-Trent charged with violent disorder and assaulting an emergency worker.\n\nIn London, more than 1,300 public order officers are on standby to deploy across the city to deal with any riots. Thousands more officers are out on normal patrols.\n\nHome Secretary Yvette Cooper has warned far-right extremists that they will “pay the price” for any violence in London, or other parts of Britain, with jail sentences of up to ten years for rioting.\n\nLondon Mayor Sadiq Khan and police chiefs briefed the capital’s MPs on the possibility of violent demonstrations.\n\nAfterwards, he wrote on X: “Today I convened a meeting with the Met Commissioner and London’s MPs and council leaders to discuss our ongoing work to keep Londoners safe, bring communities together and protect those who are worried and scared about potential violence and disorder.\n\n“For those intent on spreading hatred and fear in our city over the coming days, our message is clear: if you break the law, you will be arrested and face the full force of the law.”\n\nThank you for registering\n\nPlease refresh the page or navigate to another page on the site to be automatically logged in\n\nMORE ABOUT"
