        "text": "The former burgundy colour scheme is being gradually replaced with a more muted-teal colour, along with new logo and crest design.\n\nAlready, the website and its social media have seen the change, while the rebrand is gradually being rolled out across the town.\n\nIt comes after the move was criticised with some suggesting the proposed colour, which had been described as \"Tory Blue,\" could cause \"long-term\" damage.\n\n​Read more: 'Tory blue' Darlington Council rebrand dubbed 'amateur hour at the Town Hall'\n\nBut the council last night explained that a final colour of teal was eventually used for \"technical reasons,\" as it said it had kept costs down by designing the rebrand in-house.\n\nCouncillor Jonathan Dulston, Deputy Leader of Darlington Council, told The Northern Echo that the rebrand had been a “big success” and said reaction had been positive.\n\nHe said: “Having started the roll-out of the new brand earlier this week, we’re pleased that the majority of the feedback we’ve had, both on social media and elsewhere, has been positive.\n\n“People have said the new look is modern and professional, and they’ve welcomed our decision to put Darlington’s existing coat of arms at the forefront.\n\n“Obviously, you can’t always please everyone and there may be things we look to tweak as we move forward with the roll-out, but from my point of view the rebrand has been a big success and a key achievement in our efforts to transform the council and deliver success for Darlington.”\n\nDespite reports the rebrand would be blue, the council said it had made tweaks to the final colour for “technical reasons” which it said had been similar to what was first proposed.\n\nCouncillor Nick Wallis, Labour’s Shadow Portfolio Holder at the council, previously accused the council of being “fixated with PR” as the rebranding plans first emerged.\n\nRead more: Council rebranding set to turn Darlington Town Hall blue\n\nAt the time, he said: “In a sense the obvious political advantage they believe they have scored by making the logo Tory blue is secondary.\n\n\"What is important is the long-term damage this botched rebranding may do to the reputation of the council.\n\n\"This episode tells the people of Darlington something important about the ruling Tory/Independent group.\n\n\"They are fixated with PR and the promotion of themselves at all costs. They don't care about wasting public money if they believe it advances their political interests.\"\n\nAdressing cost last night, the council said that the design and branding work was carried out in-house by existing staff, working across a number of teams.\n\nThe council went on to say that there had been no upfront cost for the rebranding as a result, other than payment in staff time.\n\nHowever, that did not include the proposed plans to repaint part of the Town Hall in the new colour scheme and branding, which is expected to cost £20,000.\n\nOn social media, the council confirmed that the new branding will be gradually rolled out to the authority's services including authority-branded vehicles and high-viz jackets.\n\nIt said that the old logo, which was introduced in the mid-90s, would only begin to be phased out on bins and street signs as and when they are being replaced.\n\n--\n\nKeep up to date with all the latest news on our website, or follow us on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nYou can also follow our dedicated Darlington Facebook page for all the latest in the area by clicking here.\n\nFor all the top news updates from right across the region straight to your inbox, sign up to our newsletter here."
