        "text": "Brighton Station Health Centre in Queens Road will close at 5pm today rather than 8pm for the safety of its staff and patients.\n\nNHS Sussex has also confirmed that the Station Plaza walk-in centre in Hastings will also be closed at 5pm today.\n\nThis decision was made after details have emerged about a planned protest in Brighton on Wednesday, which The Argus has chosen not to publicise.\n\nREAD MORE: Council leader warns police will 'come down hard' on rioters\n\nThere are fears this could be part of a wider wave of protests and riots that have hit the UK since the Southport stabbings last week.\n\nUnrest has been witnessed across the country, with police officers injured during “sustained violence” in Plymouth on Monday.\n\nThe streets of Darlington also saw officers pelted with bricks by rioters, while shop windows were smashed up.\n\nSussex Police has said its officers are \"experienced\" in public order incidents and have plans in place to combat violent disorder if necessary.\n\nAssistant Chief Constable Paul Court said that racist, criminal behaviour will not be tolerated and that potential rioters will be made to “regret their actions” if they take to the streets of Sussex.\n\nBrighton and Hove City Council Leader Bella Sankey has said the council is working closely with the police and that “violent thuggery” has no place in the city.\n\nShe said: “We are aware of growing public concern following the recent criminal disorder seen across the country, the unverified reports circulating about potential activity in the city and unsolicited leaflets being shared in some areas.\n\n“I would like to reassure residents and visitors that the council is working closely with Sussex Police and other partners to identify any emerging concerns, and keep our residents, staff, community partners and businesses safe.\n\n“We recognise the impact this unrest is causing to the lives of many people and that we are not all experiencing it in the same way, disproportionately harming our black, migrant and Muslim communities.\n\n“Brighton and Hove will always be a place which prides itself on our inclusivity and being a place of sanctuary.\n\n\"Sussex Police will come down hard on anyone taking part in the type of disorder we have seen elsewhere in the country. Racism and violent thuggery have no place in our city.\n\n“We will update residents further on any impact this may have on our local services, but in the meantime, I would like to encourage people to keep an eye on information from Sussex Police, stay vigilant and report any concerns or instances of hate crime to them by calling either 101, or 999 in an emergency.”"
