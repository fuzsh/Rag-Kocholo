        "text": "Products: Abberton Wall Mounted Entrance Canopies\n\nSizes: 21no. 3.2m x 1.2m & 4no. 2.1m x 1.2m\n\nFrame Colours: Gentian Blue RAL 5010 and Pure White – RAL 9010\n\nPolycarbonate Colour: Clear\n\nInstallation Dates: January 2017 – September 2021\n\nOverview\n\nDarlington Borough Council are in the process of completing a new-build housing development in North Darlington where they plan to build a total of 1000 affordable homes over a 10 year period.\n\nThey have been a direct customer of Able Canopies since 2017 and since then, we have installed a total of 25 canopies for them across three different locations, on six different occasions.\n\nAll 25 canopies that we supplied and installed were the Abberton Wall Mounted Entrance Canopy which is the perfect door canopy with its small projection and cantilevered design. The absence of front posts worked well for these projects because they are multi-occupancy residential buildings, and the canopies were positioned above the main and rear entrances to the buildings.\n\nThe Abberton has a contemporary design with perforated brackets that gives off a subtle industrial appearance. The frame is constructed from high grade aluminium, which is naturally rust resistant, and is covered with 4mm solid polycarbonate sheets which have a curved glass appearance yet are much stronger. This means that the Abberton will last for many years to come, making it the perfect choice for a long-term entrance canopy on residential buildings."
