The Council of Governors is made up of local people, staff members and representatives of local stakeholder organisations.\n\nThe Council of Governors plays a major role in the governance of the Trust. Its main responsibilities include:\n\nCollating the views of members and the wider community about the services the Trust provides;\n\nWorking alongside the Board of Directors to produce the strategic vision and the Trust's Annual Plan;\n\nAppointing the Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors and setting their remuneration;\n\nAppointing the Trust's auditor;\n\nReceiving the Annual Report and Accounts; and\n\nDeveloping the membership strategy.\n\nThe Council is made up of both elected and appointed governors.
