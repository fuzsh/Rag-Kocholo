On 1 April 1997 the district became a unitary authority, regaining its independence from Durham County Council. Political control of the council since 1973 has been held by the following parties:[20]\n\nNon-metropolitan district\n\nParty in control Years Labour 1973–1976 Conservative 1976–1979 Labour 1979–1987 No overall control 1987–1991 Labour 1991–1997\n\nUnitary authority\n\nParty in control Years Labour 1997–2019 No overall control 2019–present\n\nLeadership\n\n[edit]\n\nThe leaders of the council since 1991 have been:[21]\n\nCouncillor Party From To John Williams[22] Labour 1991 8 May 2011 Bill Dixon Labour 19 May 2011 19 Jul 2018 Steve Harker Labour 19 Jul 2018 23 May 2019 Heather Scott Conservative 23 May 2019 19 May 2022 Jonathan Dulston Conservative 19 May 2022 4 May 2023 Steve Harker Labour 4 May 2023\n\nCouncil elections\n\n[edit]\n\nNon-metropolitan district elections\n\n[edit]\n\n1973 Darlington Borough Council election\n\n1976 Darlington Borough Council election (Borough boundary changes took place but the number of seats remained the same)[23]\n\n1979 Darlington Borough Council election (New ward boundaries)[24]\n\n1983 Darlington Borough Council election\n\n1987 Darlington Borough Council election\n\n1991 Darlington Borough Council election (Borough boundary changes took place but the number of seats remained the same)[25]\n\nUnitary authority elections\n\n[edit]\n\n1996 Darlington Borough Council election\n\n1999 Darlington Borough Council election\n\n2003 Darlington Borough Council election (New ward boundaries)[26]\n\n2007 Darlington Borough Council election\n\n2011 Darlington Borough Council election\n\n2015 Darlington Borough Council election (New ward boundaries)[27]\n\n2019 Darlington Borough Council election\n\n2023 Darlington Borough Council election\n\nResults maps\n\n[edit]\n\n2015 results map\n\n2019 results map\n\n2023 results map\n\nBy-election results\n\n[edit]\n\n1996-1999\n\n[edit]\n\nPark East By-Election 1 May 1997 Party Candidate Votes % Majority 1,196 48.0 Turnout 2,492 Labour hold Swing\n\nHaughton East By-Election 22 May 1997 Party Candidate Votes % Majority 521 45.2 Turnout 1,151 Labour hold Swing\n\nNorth Road By-Election 13 November 1997 Party Candidate Votes % Majority 145 16.5 Turnout 878 Liberal Democrats hold Swing\n\n1999-2003\n\n[edit]\n\nCockerton East By-Election 21 September 2000 Party Candidate Votes % Majority 34 3.6 Turnout 1,013 Labour hold Swing\n\n2003-2007\n\n[edit]\n\nNorth Road By-Election 19 August 2004 Party Candidate Votes % Majority 218 13.4 Turnout 1,627 38.8 Liberal Democrats hold Swing\n\nHurworth By-Election 8 September 2005 Party Candidate Votes % Majority 148 2.2 Turnout 1,248 44.2 Liberal Democrats gain from Conservative Swing\n\nCollege By-Election 2 March 2006 Party Candidate Votes % Majority 113 8.6 Turnout 1,310 42.8 Conservative hold Swing\n\n2007-2011\n\n[edit]\n\nNorth Road By-Election 13 November 2008 Party Candidate Votes % Majority 299 27.1 Turnout 1,104 24.2 Liberal Democrats hold Swing\n\nCockerton West By-Election 8 July 2010[28] Party Candidate Votes % Majority 41 4.8 Turnout 860 29.3 Labour hold Swing\n\n2011-2015\n\n[edit]\n\nHarrowgate Hill By-Election 12 April 2012[28] Party Candidate Votes % Majority 87 5.5 Turnout 1,585 33.8 Conservative gain from Labour Swing\n\nHurworth By-Election 12 April 2012[28] Party Candidate Votes % Majority 38 3.5 Turnout 1,085 36.5 Liberal Democrats hold Swing\n\nLascelles By-Election 11 April 2013[28] Party Candidate Votes % Majority 297 44.2 Turnout 672 22.6 Labour hold Swing\n\nMowden By-Election 22 May 2014[28] Party Candidate Votes % Majority 33 2.1 Turnout 1,589 51.8 Conservative hold Swing\n\n2015-2019\n\n[edit]\n\nMowden By-Election 16 November 2017[29][30] Party Candidate Votes % Majority 367 34.2 Turnout 1,074 33.7 Conservative hold Swing\n\nRed Hall and Lingfield By-Election 16 November 2017[29][31] Party Candidate Votes % Majority 19 3.4 Turnout 556 19.5 Labour hold Swing\n\nCockerton By-Election 12 July 2018[32] Party Candidate Votes % Majority 316 29.0 Turnout 1,088 23.0 Labour hold Swing\n\n2019-2023\n\n[edit]\n\nHummersknott By-Election 6 May 2021[33] Party Candidate Votes % Majority 162 8.3 Turnout 1,946 Conservative hold Swing\n\nRed Hall and Lingfield By-Election 6 May 2021[34] Party Candidate Votes % Majority 106 9.6 Turnout 1,103 Conservative gain from Labour Swing\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
