        "text": "Alick Bearn died on May 15th 2009 at the age of 86. He was elected to Climatological in 1968 and together with Margaret was a frequent presence at meetings of the Association, always with great zest and engagement. Zest and engagement, in fact, marked him at all of the way stations along a fascinating and multifaceted career.\n\nAlick was born in Cheam, Surrey, England, and educated at Epsom College and Guy's Hospital Medical School. He was award the MB BS by the University of London in 1946. The next year was spent on the resident staff at Guy's Hospital and the ensuing two years as a medical officer with the Royal Air Force. He finished his training at the Postgraduate Medical School at Hammersmith Hospital between 1949 and 1951, working with Professor (later Dame) Sheila Sherlock. During that interval they published a number of papers on hepatic blood flow, carbohydrate metabolism and in particular glucose output as related to hepatic insulin sensitivity. During this time he was awarded the MD (1950) by the University of London. His interest in metabolic diseases and in a research career emerged at this time, and in 1951 he came to the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research for a short research fellowship as a Fulbright Fellow. In short order he met Margaret Slocum, an American lawyer of considerable talent and charm. They married, and the remainder of Alick's career was based entirely in this country. He became a U.S. citizen in 1969.\n\nAt the Rockefeller his interest in metabolic disease merged with an early enthusiasm for biochemical genetics. In particular, his studies focused on Wilson's disease, which had been described in 1912. Accumulation of copper, particularly in the liver and brain, was later identified as a central feature of the disease, and while Wilson and others had noted that the disease occurred within families, it had not been recognized as a hereditary condition. Bearn's study of thirty affected families, published in 1960, established that the disorder was inherited in autosomal recessive fashion. He proposed that the specific genetic defect, unknown at the time, somehow altered copper transport. He was one of the first to identify low serum levels of ceruloplasmin as a core feature of the disease, and in later studies correlated abnormalities of copper metabolism with the aminoaciduria associated with it. He was one of the early promoters of the use of penicillamine in mobilizing tissue copper for urinary excretion.\n\nHis initial appointment at the Rockefeller Institute in 1951 was as an Assistant. In 1955 he was appointed to the faculty as an assistant professor and over the next few years he organized the first genetics laboratory there, one of the earliest in the country. He rose progressively through the ranks and in 1966 was appointed full professor and made a Senior Physician at the Hospital of the Rockefeller Institute. His affection for that institution remained undimmed for the rest of his life. He served as a Trustee from 1970 to 1998 and was then made a Trustee Emeritus. In 2002 the Rockefeller University presented him with the David Rockefeller Award for Extraordinary Service.\n\nAlick left the active faculty at the Rockefeller in 1966 when he was appointed Chairman of the department of medicine at the Cornell University-Medical College and Physician-in-Chief of the New York Hospital. He served in those roles until 1977. In 1973 he established with colleagues from the Rockefeller and the Medical College a highly successful joint M.D. - Ph.D. program. Beginning with his arrival at the Rockefeller and for some 25 years thereafter Alick was an immensely productive investigator, and he published in prolific fashion during those years. Most of those studies were concerned with genetic variation and biochemical mechanisms of gene expression. He studied cystic fibrosis, the mucopolysaccharidoses, serum protein polymorphisms, ceruloplasmin heterogeneity, and genetic effects in a variety of other disorders and biologically important molecules, including beta-2 microglobulin, which he isolated and characterized. His later publications focused on broader considerations in metabolic diseases and in genetics. Numbers of review articles were published, many textbook articles written, and ten books edited. He contributed a number of brief notes on prominant figures in biomedicine including, for example, Henry Kunkel, D. Geraint James, Lewis Thomas, Oswald Avery, Hartwig Cleve and others.\n\nIn 1979 he became one of the early migrants from medical academe to industry, moving to the Merck Corporation as senior vice president in the International Division, responsible for medical and scientific affairs.\n\nIn 1996 and 1997 Alick and Margaret were at the University of Cambridge, where he had been named a Distinguished Visiting Fellow at Christ's College in the Department of History and Philosophy of Science. That happy return to his ancestral soil presaged a rich and rewarding final chapter in Alick's professional life. He had been elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1972 and had been an enthusiastic and involved member, serving on a variety of committees over the years and as vice president from 1990 to 1996. In 1997 he was named Executive Officer of the APS, retiring in 2002, at which time he was awarded its Benjamin Franklin Medal. Alick revitalized and expanded the work of the Society during his tenure. Frank Rhodes, whose presidency of the APS overlapped Alick's time in office, has noted that Alick played his role with “a lightness of touch and a gentle sense of humor that endeared him to everyone.”\n\nMarks of academic distinction came to Alick in abundance. He was elected to the Institute of Medicine in 1971 and to the National Academy of Sciences the following year. Within the NAS he later chaired the Division of Medical Sciences. He held a number of honorary degrees and at various times served on the Boards of the Jackson Laboratory, the Helen Hay Whitney Foundation, the Josiah Macy, Jr. Foundation and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, in addition to his service as a Trustee of the Rockefeller University. More broadly, he served on the Genetics Training Committee of the Division of General Medical Sciences of the US Public Health Service, the Board of Scientific Consultants of the Sloan-Kettering Institute for Cancer Research, the Medical Advisory Board of the National Foundation for Neuromuscular Diseases, the WHO Expert Advisory Panel on Human Genetics, and the Board of Scientific Counselors of the National Institute of Arthritis, Metabolism and Digestive Diseases.\n\nOver the years he delivered a number of distinguished lectures, including the Lowell Lecture at Harvard, the Lilly Lecture of the Royal College of Physicians of London, and the Rufus Cole Lecture at the Rockefeller University. He served on the editorial boards of eleven journals and as Editor-in-Chief of the American Journal of Medicine. He was a prolific author, publishing 242 scientific papers in addition to the books and reviews he edited. Of particular interest were three biographies he wrote, late in his career, all of them relating to the evolution of his own interests. The first was on Archibald Garrod, Osler's successor as Regius Professor of Medicine at Oxford, who developed the concept of inherited diseases of metabolism, formulated the “one gene, one enzyme” hypothesis, and described the recessive inheritance of most enzyme defects. He was Alick's intellectual grandfather in a sense, and the biography is clearly an homage to him. Somewhat later he published a biography of Sir Thomas Allbutt, Regius Professor of Physic at Cambridge at the end of the 19th century. Allbutt was the inventor of the clinical thermometer and a major figure at an institution to which Alick was deeply devoted. The third biography concerned Francis Richard Fraser, a Scot who had worked at the Rockefeller Institute with Rufus Cole, Simon Flexner and Alfred Cohn. Fraser later succeeded Garrod as Director of the medical unit at St. Bartholomew's Hospital and later still was the first professor of medicine at the Postgraduate Medical School at the Hammersmith, making him in a sense another intellectual forebear of Alick's.\n\nAll in all, Alick had about as full and varied a life as a medical career affords. He said, in opening the millennium program at the APS in 1999, “ … the joy and energy of our lives … are, in every case, a function of our rising imaginations and our delight in adventure. There can be no contentment but in proceeding.” He was an erudite, warm man and, not infrequently, hilariously funny. He and Margaret traveled extensively, had homes at various times not only in the US, but in Scotland, Cambridge, and the South of France. They enjoyed a wide range of friends and loved good literature, good talk, good food and good wine. Margaret's distinguished career as a lawyer grew in parallel with Alick's. She survives him, as does his son, Gordon, his daughter, Helen Pennoyer, their spouses, Ellen and Russell, and five grandchildren."
