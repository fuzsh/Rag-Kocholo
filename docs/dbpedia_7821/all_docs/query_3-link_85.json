        "text": "A Demand for Equal Rights\n\nAt a time when many black people were enslaved, and those who were free had almost no legal protections that any white man was bound to respect, the Colored Conventions were a monumental organizing effort by black people across the country to fight for full citizenship rights.\n\nThe first Colored Convention in California was held at St. Andrews AME Church in Sacramento in 1855. Abolitionists and church leaders who had participated in earlier conventions on the East Coast led the proceedings. They called for the abolishment of slavery, voting rights for black men, and the repeal of testimony exclusion laws that made it illegal for black and Native Californians to testify in court against whites. Delegates represented a wide swath of black leadership, including prominent writers, newspaper editors, organizers, and entrepreneurs. The convention leadership established an executive committee to raise funds for their lobbying efforts. Progress was slow. California’s Legislature ignored petitions to repeal the testimony exclusion laws and enabled anti-black racism and slavery to flourish in the âfreeâ state. In 1863, the Legislature finally overturned the ban on black testimony after an eight-year campaign by Colored Convention delegates. The Convention met for the last time in California in 1865, and would serve as an inspiration for later civil rights movements."
