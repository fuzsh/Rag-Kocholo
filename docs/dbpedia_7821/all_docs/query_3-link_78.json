        "text": "The image of Alexander Litvinenko defiant but dying from radioactive poisoning in a London hospital bed is how the world remembers the former Russian intelligence officer.\n\nBut that is not the way his widow, Marina, and son, Anatoly, 21, want to remember him.\n\nThe photos they spread across a kitchen table tell the story of Mr Litvinenko's life, not his death.\n\nThere is a picture of him aged 17 in military uniform. He became part of the security apparatus - what was the KGB and, after the end of the Soviet Union, the FSB.\n\nAnother picture shows him sitting astride a tank - a man who fought for his country.\n\nAlexander Litvinenko: Profile of murdered Russian spy\n\nA deadly trail of polonium\n\nBut there is also an image from a press conference in which he spoke out about corruption in the FSB.\n\nHe went to see the FSB's newly-appointed director to complain, hoping he would act. But, instead, Mr Litvinenko was cast out. The director's name was Vladimir Putin.\n\nAlongside the pictures of his work, are those of his personal life - holding his newborn son, teaching Anatoly to swim on his back, and playing with him on a sofa. Anatoly looks away from these.\n\n\"I try not to think too much about my early childhood,\" he says. \"It is easier that way.\"\n\nSoon after speaking out over corruption, Mr Litvinenko made the decision to flee Russia for his and his family's safety.\n\nHe arrived in London and eventually became a British citizen, in 2006.\n\nWithin weeks of that event, he would be poisoned.\n\nThe 10-year journey to the inquiry - which found that his murder was \"probably\" approved by President Putin - was tortuous.\n\nAn inquest began but then hit a brick wall when the government said much of the information it held was classified and could not be revealed in public.\n\nThe only solution, said Sir Robert Owen, the judge sitting as coroner, was to hold a public inquiry.\n\nThe government resisted that option, but Marina Litvinenko continued to fight through the courts.\n\nEventually, the Home Office relented, a decision many saw as the result of a downturn in relations with Russia.\n\nAnatoly had little understanding of his father's work when he was a child, and it was only the inquiry that helped him understand the extent to which Mr Litvinenko had remained involved in the world of security and intelligence.\n\nThis included working for Britain's Secret Intelligence Service, MI6.\n\nThe inquiry revealed how Mr Litvinenko was receiving regular payments for consultancy work and had a case officer - known as Martin - he met regularly.\n\nThe details of the poisoning itself have long been known, although fresh information did emerge which linked Andrei Lugovoi and Dimitri Kovtun to multiple attempts to kill Mr Litvinenko.\n\nBritish diplomats involved in the Litvinenko case accept the measures taken at the time may not have been strong enough to deter Russia (these included the expulsion of diplomats and the suspension of intelligence cooperation, which was of relatively small importance anyway).\n\nBut the signs are the British state may not be keen at this moment to further escalate tensions with Russia, particularly because of Moscow's role in the Middle East and the Syria crisis.\n\nMarina and Anatoly Litvinenko are aware the political context around the inquiry has changed and may shape the response.\n\nThey also recognise the report may be a milestone but might not not end their struggle.\n\n\"It is important, but it is not necessarily the end,\" says Marina.\n\nAnd Anatoly says: \"I feel a sense of duty.\n\n\"My father did a hell of a lot to get me to this country to make sure I was safe.\n\n\"I need to respect that and do whatever I can to honour his memory.\n\n\"Finding the truth is the closest we can get to justice for my father.\""
