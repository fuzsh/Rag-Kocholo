A. G. MIOHIE.\n\nOh Wednesday evening the disturbing and very sad news reached Bombala by wire that Mr. A. G. Michie, .Presbyterian Minister of this parish had died suddenly that afternoon at Delegate, It was some time before the news could be credited for Mr Michie had always been looked upon as a very healthy man and one who suffered but little from sickness. Too soon, alas, it was known beyond a doubt that the news was true, and that tho well- ' beloved pastor had sot out for that bourn which knows no earthly troubles and where the diligent servant of Christ would receive the reward of a faithful life spent In his Master's service. The distressing news was at once conveyed to the wife and family of the deceased, who, it is needless to say, were quite prostrated at the suddenness of the blow. An inquest was held on Friday by Mr. Coroner Murphy, at which all the facts connected with the death were disclosed. The evidence taken at the inquest appears below.\n\nAlexander Gordon Michie was born in Aberdeen, Scotland, in 1841. From his boyhood it was the wish of his parents that he should follow the course of the Ministry and this desire was shared by himself. He waded through' the first stages of his education as a school boy, none the less enthusiastically, as he did his subsequent college training diligently plodding his way until he was able to maintain himself in a Scotland College. There he earned the reputation of an industrious and 'intelligent student with a spirit and courage only possessed by one of such a strong character. Evidence. of these traits were given when on leaving college he volunteered for service in the Mission field which was no mean task at that early date.\n\nOn account of Mrs Michie's weak constitution, he eventually had to abandon Mission work for a parish in Tasmania, that he might secure a more suitable climate for his wife's health. In Tasmania he remained over a course of some years, throughout which he firmly held the profound respect and admiration of the citizens. On removing from Tasmania he settled in 'Victoria at Brighton, but later was appointed to supply at different parishes throughout N.S .W., one of which it will be remembered was at Cooma previous to taking over the Bombala circuit. His value here can be best judged by the citizens who have witnessed his ardent work for tho cause of Christianity. By persistent and adherent work he has been regularly at his post of duty, despite the extended distances between each church in the circuit. This sense of duty and faithful work coupled with his earnest and sincere preaching as well as an irreproachable example, reveals the character of a truly Christian man. From the days of his boyhood when he struggled with and mastered his school lessons, to the day of his death is a long space of years filled in with an active life for the cause of Religion, an example of unselfish self-sacrifice, in order to inspire his people with the spirit he knew to be right.\n\nHe lived a Christian and died a Christian , dead to our worldly surroundings, but living in the memory of our admiration which he won much while he was present. All that is left for us is to regret his loss, admire his grand character, and offer our sincere and heart-felt sympathy to the family to whom he-was so dear. The funeral will take place to-morrow afternoon, when tho last rites will be performed at the Bombala cemetery by the Rev. Mr. Craig, of Cooma.
