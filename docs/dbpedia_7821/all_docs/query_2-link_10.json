        "text": "Alex Gordon has more than 28 years of trial experience, serving as both an Assistant County Attorney in Florida and as a Senior Assistant Public Defender in Fairfax, Virginia.\n\nDuring his career he and his law firm have represented more than 7000 clients charged with serious felonies and misdemeanors in Northern Virginia. Alex is a member of the Virginia State Bar and the State Bars of Florida and Georgia. He is a member of the Fairfax Bar Association, the American Bar Association, and the National Association of Criminal Defense Attorneys.\n\nMr. Gordon earned a Bachelor of Science from James Madison University in 1991 and graduated from the University of Georgia School of Law in 1994.\n\n\"Where do I start? Both Carlos and Alex are hands down, some of the best lawyers in the northern VA area. This became evident the first time I worked with them to resolve a matter my son was dealing with. From their in depth knowledge of the law, commonwealth law, and Fairfax county procedure to their impeccable reputations within the courthouse, these guys are nothing short of amazing. They helped my family in trying times and I will not forget it. If you need a lawyer, look no further.\""
