        "text": "The United States, Western allies and Russia exchanged 24 prisoners Thursday in the largest exchange of detainees since the Cold War.\n\nThe swap that took place in Turkey freed three high-profile Americans who had been detained for months or even years.\n\nIn return for releasing Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, former Marine Paul Whelan and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty journalist Alsu Kurmasheva, Russia received eight prisoners who had been held abroad.\n\nGermany also received 12 prisoners who were held in Russia.\n\nThe prisoner swap involved not just the U.S., Turkey, Germany and Russia, but also Poland, Slovenia, Norway and Belarus.\n\nHere’s what we know about the Americans and Russians released in the swap.\n\nEvan Gershkovich\n\nAn American whose parents emigrated from Russia, Gershkovich was detained in March 2023 in the Russian city of Yekaterinburg while on a reporting assignment. He has worked for The Wall Street Journal since 2022.\n\nGershkovich was accused of collecting state secrets on the Russian military on behalf of the U.S. government and was sentenced to 16 years in prison in July.\n\nThe U.S., his employer and press freedom groups all said he was wrongfully detained and pushed for months for his release.\n\nPaul Whelan\n\nThe former Marine has been held in Russia since 2018 and was considered wrongfully detained by the U.S. government.\n\nWhelan served in a Marine reserve unit and deployed to Iraq in 2004. After his retirement from the armed forces, he joined the security company Kelly Services.\n\nWhelan traveled across the globe and was in Russia in 2018 for a friend’s wedding when he was detained and accused of espionage.\n\nHe was later sentenced to 16 years in prison and moved to a penal colony. Whelan was the subject of multiple negotiations over the years but grew frustrated after other prisoner swaps between the U.S. and Russia did not include him, including a deal that released WNBA star Brittney Griner in 2022.\n\nAlsu Kurmasheva\n\nKurmasheva is a journalist who held Russian and American citizenship but lived in Prague with her husband and two daughters.\n\nShe wrote about the Tatar and Bashkir minority groups in Russia’s Volga-Ural region.\n\nKurmasheva traveled to Russia in May 2023 to care for her ailing mother.\n\nShe was temporarily detained in June 2023 and then arrested in October of that year.\n\nIn July, she was sentenced to more than six years in prison for spreading false information.\n\nVladimir Kara-Murza\n\nRussian-British national Vladimir Kara-Murza, who also has an American green card, has long been an outspoken critic of the Kremlin and Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nHe was detained in April 2022 after he began speaking out about Russia’s war in Ukraine.\n\nKara-Murza is a contributing opinion writer for The Washington Post, where he writes about Russia and often criticizes Putin and the Kremlin’s policies.\n\nVadim Krasikov\n\nVadim Krasikov, a Russian hitman, had been held in Germany following his conviction in the death of a former Chechen separatist commander in Berlin in 2019.\n\nSpeculation has fueled for months that Putin wanted to secure his release in return for a prisoner swap, potentially involving Whelan or Gershkovich.\n\nKrasikov was a high-ranking official in Russia’s Vympel special forces unit in the Federal Security Service.\n\nKrasikov is also suspected of being behind a 2013 killing of a Russian businessman in Moscow in 2013, but the case was later dropped.\n\nOther Russians released\n\nAccording to multiple reports, here are the other Russians released.\n\nArtem Dultsev and Anna Dultseva were being held in Slovenia on espionage charges. Both were linked to the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service. The pair pleaded guilty Wednesday.\n\nMikhail Mikushin was arrested in 2022 in Norway on espionage charges and accused of spying for Russia.\n\nPavel Rubtsov was detained in Poland in 2022 and accused of spying for Russia and serving as a military intelligence agent under the cover of being a journalist.\n\nRoman Seleznev, a Russian hacker and credit card fraudster, was sentenced to 27 years in prison in the U.S. after his detention in 2014.\n\nVladislav Klyushin, a Russian businessman, was sentenced to nine years in prison in 2023 in the U.S. in a hacking scheme.\n\nVadim Konoshchenok was detained in Estonia in 2022 and arraigned on charges in the U.S. in 2023 of smuggling American technology and equipment to Russia’s military and government.\n\nGermans released\n\nThe prisoner swap Thursday also freed 12 Germans and Russian activists held by Russia.\n\nAccording to multiple reports, they were:\n\nDieter Voronin, a Russian-German citizen and political scientist detained in 2021.\n\nKevin Lik, who was born in Germany but moved to Russia and was arrested in 2023 at the age of 16 on accusations of taking photographs of Russian troops.\n\nRico Krieger, a German man sentenced to death in Belarus on terrorism charges. He was accused of planting explosives near a railway line to support Ukraine and confessed to the crimes in a choreographed video.\n\nPatrick Schoebel, a German man accused of carrying cannabis gummies into Russia and detained in February.\n\nHerman Moyzhes, a Russian-German lawyer accused of helping Russian citizens get European Union visas.\n\nIlya Yashin, a prominent ally of the late Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny. He was sentenced to more than eight years in prison in 2022 for spreading fake news.\n\nLilia Chanysheva, a Russian opposition figure and Navalny ally who was arrested in 2021.\n\nKsenia Fadeyeva, another Russian opposition figure and Navalny ally arrested in 2021.\n\nVadim Ostanin, an opposition figure and Navalny ally arrested in 2021.\n\nAndrei Pivovarov, a human rights activist who founded the disbanded Open Russia movement and was sentenced to four years in prison in 2022 for leading an “undesirable organization.”\n\nOleg Orlov, a human rights defender sentenced to more than two years in prison in February.\n\nSasha Skochilenko, a Russian anti-war activist and artist who was arrested in April 2022.\n\nOther Americans still in Russia\n\nMarc Fogel, a schoolteacher from Pennsylvania, is still in Russian custody.
