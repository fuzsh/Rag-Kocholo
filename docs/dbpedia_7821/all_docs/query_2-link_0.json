        "text": "Soviet filmmaker and Russian author (1931–2020)\n\nAleksandr Vitalyevich Gordon (Russian: Алексaндр Витaльевич Гордoн; pronunciation: ahlekSAHNDer viTAHLyevitch gorDOAN) (26 December 1931 – 7 December 2020) was a Soviet filmmaker and Russian author.[1]\n\nBiography\n\n[edit]\n\nGordon was a classmate of Andrey Tarkovskiy at the All-Russian State Institute of Cinematography (VGIK), in the directing department taught by Mikhail Romm, graduating in 1960. In workshops involving classmates from different areas of study, the students collaborated on several projects, Gordon and Tarkovskiy co-directing and co-writing their first two student short films together (1956 and 1959), Gordon also appearing in both. He was a member of the Russian Cinematographers Union (CPSU) since 1953.[2]\n\nWhile at VGIK he married Tarkovskiy's younger sister Marina Arsenyevna Tarkovskaya, a writer and linguist. They had two children: Mikhail Aleksandrovich Tarkovskiy (born 1958), a writer, cinematographer, biologist, and fur trapper living off the land in the eastern Siberian taiga,[3] and Ekaterina (Katya) Aleksandrovna Tarkovskaya, an actress since childhood.[4]\n\nGordon made 9 feature films in the USSR, of which four from the 1960s and 70s are highly acclaimed. From 1964-1970 he worked at the Moldova Film studios, where he directed the films The Last Night in Paradise, Sergey Lazo, and Theft. In the late 1970s through the 80s, he made films in the genre of a tough crime-adventure, rare for the pre-perestroika Soviet Union: Skirmish in a Blizzard, Double Passing, Ransom, which allowed a violent confrontation between a criminal and a citizen of the \"era of developed socialism\". Until his death, he was the director of the Mosfilm studios, where in the mid-1980s he provided Russian dubbing voices for Andrei Tarkovskiy's films shot abroad: Nostalghia and The Sacrifice. He directed his last feature film in 1990, about a Football Player. In 1994 he and his wife wrote a film documentary and dramatization about Andrei Tarkovskiy's year in the Siberian taiga that led to Andrei's decision to become a filmmaker. The script includes an adaptation of Tarkovskiy's unpublished screenplay treatment The Concentrate, a dramatized account of his taiga research trip, written as Tarkovskiy's entrance examination to VGIK the following year.[5]\n\nAfter the collapse of the Soviet Union, he continued as director of the new Mosfilm, stopped directing films himself and instead turned to writing,[6] authoring three books, beginning in 2006 with a memoir of Tarkovskiy \"Unquenched Thirst\". His second book was released on his 80th birthday; called \"Hungarian Flying Shot\", it was in the form of fictional prose about his years in the army. His last book was published in 2016, entitled \"Tucherez, or the Incredible is Likely\" (a \"tucherez\" is a kind of skyscraper), written as a fantasy conversation between two filmmakers, Sergei Eisenstein and Andrei Tarkovskiy, with episodes from Gordon's own life, and anecdotes from other filmmakers, and about the state of our mysterious complex world and the future of mankind, illustrated with abstract and associative collages by the Danish artist Sergei Svyatchenko.[7]\n\nGordon died in December 2020, of an undisclosed cause.[6]\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\nDirector\n\n[edit]\n\nFeatures\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Last Night in Paradise (1964)\n\nSergey Lazo (aka Conspiracy in Vladivostok or A Hero of the Far East) (1967)\n\nTheft ('Krazha') (1970)\n\nSkirmish in a Blizzard ('Skhvatka v purge') (1977)\n\nScenes from Family Life (aka Stay With Me!)
