        "text": "The nuclear engineering graduate program at Virginia Commonwealth University’s College of Engineering climbed three ranks to secure the 18th spot in the nation, according to U.S. News and World Report.\n\n“The growing reputation of our nuclear engineering program is a testament to our unwavering commitment to world-class research and our dedication to our students and to achieving excellence in education,” said Karla Mossi, Ph.D., mechanical and nuclear engineering professor and graduate program director. “This increased ranking reflects the dedication, hard work and collective success of our faculty, staff and students. We’ve witnessed a surge in National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowships and have been honored with awards from prestigious organizations such as the Department of Energy’s Nuclear Energy University Programs, Nuclear Regulatory Commission and International Atomic Energy Agency, to name a few. The new ranking underscores the high quality and reputation of our nuclear engineering program and the exciting opportunity it presents for prospective students.”\n\nThe Department of Mechanical and Nuclear Engineering provides undergraduate and graduate students with the opportunity to perform real-world research as soon as they enroll. Formed from a partnership with Dominion Energy, the department provides a foundation in nuclear energy, allowing students to choose their educational path with advanced coursework in either mechanical or nuclear engineering. Access to industry tools, such as the Nuclear Reactor Simulator Laboratory, grounds education in practical instruction.\n\nIn addition to serving the academic needs of students, faculty are also a bridge to leading employers in the field, such as Dominion Energy, Newport News Shipbuilding, Oak Ridge National Labs and many more. These invaluable connections ensure students have a clear path to success and unique opportunities to apply their research in real-world settings, sparking their curiosity and paving the way for exciting career prospects.\n\nThe VCU College of Engineering has alsolaunched six new master's programs in aerospace engineering, engineering management, environmental and sustainable engineering, rehabilitation engineering, systems engineering, tissue engineering, and regenerative medicine. These new degree programs will begin in the fall of 2024 for students interested in more in-depth learning opportunities."
