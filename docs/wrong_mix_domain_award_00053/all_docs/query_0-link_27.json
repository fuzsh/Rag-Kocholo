        "text": "World leaders and diplomats have praised Nobel Peace Laureate Mohamed ElBaradei and his organization, the International Atomic Energy Agency.\n\nIn Paris, French President Jacques Chirac noted the laureates' roles in the search for peace and security, while British Prime Minister Tony Blair said the award underscores the significance of the IAEA's work.\n\nGerman Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder called the prize recognition of Mr. ElBaradei's position in nuclear talks with Iran.\n\nIn Washington, U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice called the award well-deserved and said the United States is committed to continued work with the IAEA to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons.\n\nBut the environmentalist group, Greenpeace, said the IAEA's promotion of nuclear power undercuts its efforts to control military nuclear proliferation.\n\nSurvivors of the atomic bombings of Japan also expressed disappointment because their organization, Hidankyo, was also a Peace Prize nominee. Hidankyo said it will continue its campaign against nuclear weapons.\n\nSome information in this story provided by AP and AFP."
