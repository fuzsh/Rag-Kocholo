        "text": "The World Energy Council seed is planted\n\nThe seed of the World Energy Council is planted. The initial founding was spearheaded by Daniel Nicol Dunlop to establish an international organisation that could stand above politics. Dunlop’s principal objective in founding the World Power Conference (later to become the 'World Energy Council', in 1968), had been to establish a permanent body to collect data on the world’s power resources, which was premised on the finite nature of energy reserves.\n\n+\n\nThe first World Power Conference\n\nThe first World Power Conference was held in London in the first two weeks of July 1924, with Daniel Dunlop as Chairman of the Executive Council. 1,700 delegates from 40 countries met in the Conference Halls at the Palace of Engineering, on the site of the Empire Exhibition. The academic journal Science called the event ‘the most notable gathering of its kind ever convened’. The journal Science reported that there were more than four hundred papers presented at the conference under headings including ‘Power Resources, Power Production, Power Transmission and Distribution, Power Utilization and General’. Overall, the First World Power Conference was a huge success.\n\n+\n\nThe World Power Conference publishes Power Resources of the World\n\nIn 1929 the World Power Conference published the book Power Resources of the World, compiled by the economist Hugh Quigley. In the preface, Dunlop marvelled at how ‘only a few years ago any investigation which aimed at the assessment of the power resources of the world, would have been regarded as one of those pleasant exercises in prophesy and vague description which only a statistician in his leisure moments would attempt’.\n\n+\n\nThe founding of the Tennessee Valley Authority\n\nThe founding of the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA): The TVA was established on May 18, 1933, as part of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal program. However, it had a significant impact on the energy sector in subsequent years, including 1935. The TVA aimed to provide affordable electricity, improve flood control, and promote economic development in the Tennessee Valley region of the United States.\n\n+\n\nDaniel Nicol Dunlop’s death in Scotland\n\nStein and Dunlop begin a journal published under the auspices of the World Power Conference, entitled the World Survey. It was intended to collect and display information on economic matters purporting a truly global and interdisciplinary perspective. Dunlop had enlisted the help of fellow anthroposophist Walter Johannes Stein to found the World Economic Organisation, but he dies of appendicitis before they could begin. He was 66.\n\n+\n\nThe third World Power Conference: Energy for Development and Social Equity\n\nAs early as 1936, the World Power Conference stressed the importance of energy for development and social equity. Also, between 1936 and 1957 (with a break during the Second World War), the Statistical Yearbook of the World Power Conference published statistical information on the electrical outputs from countries around the world. This triggered more general discussions about future ways of life, whilst also sparking conflict about who should own and control the fields of energy that were yet to open up.\n\n+\n\nGerman Invasion of Holland and the World Power Conference: A Battle for Control and Influence\n\nIn 1940 Germany invaded The Netherlands, as part of the larger German military campaign known as the Battle of France. This led the German national committee to attempt to (unsuccesfully) seize control of the World Power Conference. The Germans intercepted a letter which had been sent by the Swiss delegate Dr Büchi to Mr Bakker, the President during the war and previous Dutch Vice-President of the Executive Committee. In the letter Büchi offered his services to Bakker in the limits posed by Swiss neutrality.\n\n+\n\nShaping the Future of Energy: Post-WWII Challenges and the Emergence of Nuclear Power\n\nPost-WWII, the World Power Conference was shaped by two major challenges: how to escape energy shortages and what to do about nuclear power. After Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the topic of nuclear energy became inescapable. The prospect of atomic energy had been discussed at the very first World Power Conference in 1924, but was brushed aside as merely lying ‘in the womb of the future’. There was also a gathering in London at this time to re-establish member committees, organise the central office, and to fix a post-war budget.\n\n+\n\nEmbracing the Atomic Age\n\nAfter the war, the World Power Conference successfully joined the new international order. At the first International Executive Council meeting after the war, a committee was established to discuss the utilisation of atomic energy for industrial and domestic purposes, leading to the formation of the Atomic Energy Committee.\n\n+\n\nConsultancy Status: The World Power Conference and its Role in the United Nations\n\nIn 1947, the United Nations granted the World Power Conference consultancy status. This meant that along with a plethora of organisations, including the Inter-Parliamentary Union, the International Committee of the Red Cross, and the International Council of Women, World Power Conference representatives were granted admittance to the UN Council of Commission meetings.\n\n+\n\nAtoms for Peace Speech\n\nDwight D. Eisenhower; Atoms for Peace Speech. The speech was a significant address that called for international cooperation in the peaceful development and use of atomic energy. It sought to address concerns surrounding nuclear weapons and promote a vision of a world where the benefits of nuclear technology could be harnessed for the betterment of humanity. The speech laid the groundwork for the establishment of the IAEA and influenced global discussions on nuclear energy.\n\n+\n\nNuclear Energy Takes Center Stage\n\nIn 1954, the Chairman of World Power Conference, Vincent de Ferranti, foregrounded the importance of nuclear energy for the development of the organisation. He wrote a letter to the Chairman of the American National Committee, following an announcement in the British press, noting President Eisenhower’s intention of holding an international conference on the peaceful use of atomic power.\n\n+\n\nSecond Arab-Israel war\n\nThe Second Arab-Israeli War, also known as the Yom Kippur War took place in October 1973 and had a significant impact on energy, particularly in the context of oil and its global markets. This includes, impacting oil markets, prices, energy security and underscoring the interconnections between geopolitics, energy resources, and global economies as well as prompting significant shifts in energy policies and strategies around the world.\n\n+\n\nIAEA established\n\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has shaped the energy landscape, particularly in the field of nuclear. The IAEA's work extends beyond energy, covering areas such as human health, agriculture, water resources, and industrial applications. However, in the context of energy, the agency's activities have been instrumental in promoting the safe, secure, and peaceful use of nuclear energy and supporting its role in sustainable development.\n\n+\n\nExploring Energy Sources and Environmental Impacts: Insights from the fifth World Power Conference in Vienna\n\nAt the fifth World Power Conference, in Vienna in 1958, a\n\npanel explored the ‘Utilization of Primary Sources of Energy (thermal, electric,\n\natomic and others)’ and raised questions about the effect of nuclear power\n\ngeneration on the atmosphere.145 At the conference, representatives from WMO\n\nreported to World Power Conference about its research on renewable energy sources.\n\n+\n\nSuccessful long-distance transportation test of LNG in the United States\n\nSuccessful long-distance transportation test of LNG in the United States. In a 1959 letter to World Power Conference Secretary C. H. Gray, Liu Lan-Po (the President of the Committee of the People’s Republic of China) blamed the International Executive Council for being compliant with the U.S. imperialist plot of creating ‘two Chinas’.\n\n+\n\nAdopting a new title and the seventh World Energy Conference\n\nThe organisation 'the World Power Conference' was formally renamed 'the World Energy Council'. There were several reasons why this happened, as the organization aimed to adapt to the changing energy landscape, promote inclusivity, and position itself as a key player in addressing global energy challenges through dialogue, research, and policy advocacy.\n\n+\n\nApollo 11 Spacecraft\n\nFuel cells installed on spacecraft Apollo 11 and the world's first large-scale LNG plant, known as the Kenai LNG plant, was established in Kenai, Alaska. LNG was a joint venture between the U.S. Department of Energy, Phillips Petroleum, and other partners. The Kenai LNG plant began liquefying and exporting natural gas from the Cook Inlet gas fields to international markets, primarily Japan. The plant played a significant role in pioneering the global LNG industry.nd\n\n+\n\nThe eighth World Energy Conference: Confidence in Untapped Reserves and the Nuclear Energy Debate\n\nIn 1971, at the Eighth World Energy Conference in Bucharest, many delegates expressed great confidence in untapped reserves. ‘Optimism Voiced On Energy Needs, Talk of Gap Doesn’t Alarm Conferees in Rumania’ ran the headline in the New York Times. The age of nuclear energy appeared imminent. In addition to nuclear power, Harold Hartley also suggested that the recent discovery of natural gas and oil in the Arctic would release current pressure on demand. This sentiment was reiterated by Pytor Neporozhny, the Soviet Minister for Electrical Power and Chairman of the Conference.\n\n+\n\nEstablishment of the IEA\n\nThe IEA was formed by member countries of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). ‘Project Independence’ initiated by President Richard Nixon, sought ways to reduce American consumption and increase the production of energy through investment in technological development. However, Ford added, ‘just as Americans are challenged by Project Independence, the world faces a related challenge that requires a “Project Interdependence”.’\n\n+\n\nThe G7 Summit\n\nG6 Summit of industrialised nations, discussing inflation and energy crises amongst other issues. Energy discussions within the G7 summits reflect the shared commitment of member countries to address energy-related issues, promote sustainable energy practices, and work towards a more secure, clean, and affordable energy future. The G7 serves as a platform for collaboration, knowledge sharing, and policy coordination to tackle energy challenges at both national and global levels.\n\n+\n\nThe tenth World Energy Conference: Exploring Alternative Energy Sources and Renewed Focus on Nuclear Energy\n\nWhen the 10th World Energy Conference opened in 1977 in Istanbul, Saudi Arabia and half the OPEC nations were conspicuously absent. The conference turned to a long list of alternative energy sources to oil, coal and natural gas. It also concentrated on renewable sources, solar power,dammed rivers and wind. And it showed renewed interest in the question of nuclear energy.\n\n+\n\nThe World Energy Council’s Stance in the Aftermath of Three Mile Island\n\nDespite negative public opinion following the Three Mile Island accident in Pennsylvania in March 1979, the World Energy Council remained committed to the development of nuclear energy. In the wake of the first oil crisis, the World Energy Council set up a Conservation Commission, which in turn established study groups on Resources, Conservation and Demand. It was the Conservation Commission that published the report World Energy: Looking Ahead to 2020 in 1979. It made a powerful defence of the link between economic growth and the rising demand for energy. Since growth was imperative but oil and gas could no longer be relied on, the report advocated a shift to coal and nuclear power. The report was crucial in setting out new policy directions, but it also attracted criticism.\n\n+\n\nContrasting Approaches and Controversies at the eleventh World Energy Congress\n\nWhilst the Carter administration put a halt to the development of its nuclear programme following the accident, at the 1980 Congress in Munich, French and British delegates criticised America for its trepidation. It would lag behind the rest of the world they said. The conference host, Franz Josef Strauss, the conservative minister-president of Bavaria and a former federal minister of atomic affairs and defence, warned that ‘whoever refuses to take nuclear energy, condemns himself to social backwardness.’ He added ‘the future belongs to those countries that push ahead with nuclear energy.’\n\n+\n\nEmpowering Future Energy Leaders: The Evolution and Impact of the World Energy Council’s Future Energy Leaders Program\n\nThe World Energy Council's Future Energy Leaders program was established. Initially called the 'Energy Leaders Group', the programme was created as a forum for young energy professionals to exchange ideas, share knowledge, and develop their skills. In 1995, the programme was renamed as the Future Energy Leaders program to reflect its focus on identifying and nurturing the next generation of energy leaders. At the 1983 New Delhi 12th Congress the theme ‘Energy, Development, Quality of Life’ discussed how to deal with a growing population and increased energy demand.\n\n+\n\nBrundtland Commission’s report Our Common Future\n\nBrundtland Commission’s report Our Common Future (1987). The Brundtland Report had a profound impact on global discussions and policies related to sustainable development. It contributed to the establishment of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in 2015. It remains a key reference in the field of sustainable development, guiding efforts to achieve a more equitable, prosperous, and environmentally sound future.\n\n+\n\nThe establishment of the IPCC\n\nThe establishment of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The IPCC's work has contributed significantly to raising awareness about the urgency of addressing climate change, understanding its impacts, and guiding policy decisions at the global, national, and local levels. Its reports have served as a key scientific reference for policymakers, scientists, and stakeholders around the world.\n\n+\n\nShifting Paradigms: The Emergence of Environmental Policy in Energy Decision-Making\n\nThe name of the organisation, the 'World Energy Conference', became retitled the 'World Energy Council' and the WEC Foundation was also established. The 1989 World Energy Congress in Canada marked a paradigm shift. As Elihu Bergman, executive director of the Americans for Energy Independence, a conservation group, noted ‘you would never have heard this three years ago. This conference is symbolically legitimizing what we have known in the States: environmental policy is driving energy policy.’\n\n+\n\nEvolution of the Polish Member Committee: From Ministerial Affiliation to Independent Association\n\nDue to changes in the energy sector in the 90s ministerial involvement began to impair the Committee’s effectiveness. Just as the South African National Energy Association (SANEA) distanced itself from ESKOM, in 1997 the Polish Member Committee dissociated itself from the Energy Ministry, to which it had formally been closely tied. This would eventually lead to the Committee being officially recognised as an Association in 1997, after which it would take the title the Polish Member Committee of the World Energy Council.\n\n+\n\nKyoto Protocol\n\nThe Kyoto Protocol, an international agreement adopted in 1997, aimed to combat climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions. While the primary focus of the protocol was on mitigating climate change, it had notable impacts on energy systems and policies. The Kyoto Protocol played a pivotal role in shaping global energy policies and practices by putting emissions reduction targets, renewable energy, and energy efficiency on the agenda. While the Kyoto Protocol's commitment period officially ended in 2012, its influence continues to resonate in subsequent international climate agreements and efforts to combat climate change.\n\n+\n\nIdeas for the World Energy Trilemma framework begin to be formed\n\nEnergy for Tomorrow's World: Acting Now. Around this time, the World Energy Trilemma framework was created to help measure and manage progress. The Energy Trilemma project began to develop ‘The Energy Sustainability Country Index’. This index provides a score on the ‘energy performance axis’ – in relation to sustainability – and the ‘country context’ axis, which considers the development and implementation of suitable policies. It ranks countries by their capacity to ‘provide a stable, affordable and environmentally sensitive energy system.’\n\n+\n\nSeptember 11 in United States\n\nThe September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks in the United States had several impacts on the energy sector. These include oil market disruptions, energy infrastructure security, transportation and logistics, energy policy and national security, focus on energy independence and increased emphasis on resilience. The attacks served as a catalyst for changes in energy policies, infrastructure security, and international energy dynamics - shaping the energy landscape in the years that followed.\n\n+\n\nThe ninteenth World Energy Congress in Australia on Sustainability and Opportunities\n\nDrivers of the Energy Scene. By analyzing and understanding Drivers of the Energy Scene, the World Energy Council aims to provide insights and guidance to policymakers, industry leaders, and stakeholders in navigating the complex and evolving energy landscape. Recognizing the interplay of these drivers helps in anticipating energy trends, identifying challenges, and exploring opportunities for a sustainable and resilient energy future.\n\n+\n\nEnergy Policy Scenarios and the twentieth World Energy Congress\n\nDeciding the future: Energy Policy Scenarios to 2050. Pierre Gadonneix becomes Chair of the World Energy Council. The World Energy Congress in Rome was sponsored by Shell. 200 delegates went from almost 50 countries, between 18-27 years, and national initiatives and creation of national networks in Australia, Germany and Turkey.\n\n+\n\nThe twenty third World Energy Congress in Turkey and World Energy Scenarios Grand Transition\n\nWorld Energy Scenarios to 2060: The Grand Transition. The Grand Transition explores potential future scenarios and pathways for the global energy system, as well as insights into the possible trajectories of energy production, consumption, and technologies up to the year 2060. Younghoon David Kim becomes Chair of the World Energy Council.\n\n+\n\nThe twenty fourth World Energy Congress in Abu Dhabi\n\nDr Angela Wilkinson became the 6th Secretary General and CEO of the World Energy Council. She joined the council with a PhD in Physics, as the author of three books and is the first female leader in its 100-year history. Jean-Marie Dauger becomes chair of the World Energy Council at this time.\n\n+"
