        "text": "Stories You May Like\n\nWe offer a sampling of alums and profs who’ve earned one of the world’s top accolades—including a 2023 laureate in economics!\n\nBy Lindsay Lennon\n\nFor their extraordinary contributions to human knowledge, 51 people associated with Cornell have won the Nobel Prize over the years—an august roster that includes alumni, former faculty, and several current professors. The Big Red laureates have primarily won in the categories of physics, chemistry, and physiology/medicine, but also in literature and economics; two have been honored with the Peace Prize.\n\nOne of those peace Nobelists is an alum—described below—while the other is famed agronomist Norman Borlaug, known as the father of the Green Revolution. Like Borlaug, a number of Cornell-affiliated Nobel laureates have served as A.D. White Professors-at-Large—such as renowned poet Octavio Paz and theoretical physicist Kip Thorne.\n\nHere, in no particular order, is a sampling of the Cornellian laureates (including one brand-new winner, and two who were recently depicted on the big screen!), focusing on alumni and full-time faculty.\n\nThrough her extensive analysis of data spanning two centuries, Goldin demonstrated that women are sorely underrepresented in the global labor market—and those who do work earn less than men.\n\nWhile the gender gap in earnings has historically been chalked up to differences in education and occupations, Goldin’s research shows that most pay inequalities are now occurring between men and women in the same fields—and that it mostly occurs within a year or two of a woman giving birth to her first child.\n\n“We see a residue of history around us,” she told the New York Times. “We’re never going to have gender equality until we also have couple equity.”\n\nThe first woman offered tenure in economics at Harvard, Goldin holds a doctorate in the field from the University of Chicago.\n\nShe won the Pulitzer Prize in 1932 for her novel The Good Earth and is credited as one of the first writers to expose the American public to Asian life and culture.\n\nWhile many of Buck’s works are no longer widely read, The Good Earth remains a staple of high school English classes, and Oprah Winfrey chose it for her book club in 2004.\n\nHe was a leader of the Manhattan Project during World War II, helping to develop the first atomic bomb. He figures prominently in Christopher Nolan’s 2023 hit film Oppenheimer, in which he’s played by Gustaf Skarsgård.\n\nBethe went on to become an eloquent voice in the debate over nuclear arms control and advised several U.S. presidents on national security policy regarding nuclear weapons and power.\n\nBarbara McClintock 1923, PhD 1927\n\nPhysiology/Medicine (1983)\n\nThrough her pioneering research on the hereditary characteristics of corn, McClintock proved that some genes could change position on a chromosome—which, in turn, can activate or deactivate other nearby genes.\n\nBy observing that genes could “transpose” as well as mutate, McClintock posited that physical traits could be switched on and off depending on certain conditions. She spent decades defending her findings, which flew in the face of popular theory.\n\nDespite the skepticism of both colleagues and her family—who, according to her Nobel bio, preferred that she marry rather than go into academia—McClintock devoted her life to research. She received countless honors, including a Guggenheim fellowship; in 1944, she became the third woman elected to the National Academy of Sciences.\n\nOn the Hill, a North Campus residence hall bears her name, as does a life sciences lecture series in CALS.\n\nHis books include Old Wine, New Flasks: Reflections on Science and Jewish Tradition. He’s also a poet—publishing his fifth collection, Constants of the Motion, in 2020.\n\nAfter his father perished in a Nazi labor camp, Hoffmann and his mother hid in a schoolhouse attic in Ukraine for more than a year. They eventually settled in Brooklyn, and he went on to study chemical physics at Columbia and Harvard.\n\nToni Morrison, MA ’55\n\nLiterature (1993)\n\nMorrison’s novels—iconic works like The Bluest Eye, Song of Solomon, and Beloved—explore the history and lives of Black Americans.\n\n“Morrison’s works often depict difficult circumstances and the dark side of humanity,” noted her Nobel nominators, “but still convey integrity and redemption.”\n\nMorrison also garnered many other major honors, including the Presidential Medal of Freedom and induction into the National Women’s Hall of Fame. Like McClintock, she’s the namesake of a North Campus residence.\n\nMorrison frequently returned to the Hill, including serving as an A.D. White Professor from 1997–2003.\n\n“Cornell was the first place in my life where I was treated as a human being,” she once wrote to her thesis advisor. “I was welcomed there into the human race and, good or ill, I have been there ever since. Now, that, I think, was progress.”\n\nAfter graduation, he worked internationally with the YMCA for decades, and received a Distinguished Service Medal for service as a general secretary in the National War Work Council during World War I.\n\nStories You May Like\n\nBetzig worked for AT&T Bell Labs after earning his doctorate. He left academia in the ’90s for the private sector, but returned to help conduct the research that led to his Nobel. He’s now a professor of physics and cellular and molecular biology at the University of California, Berkeley.\n\nHe also worked on the Manhattan Project and was present at the inaugural test of the atomic bomb in 1945. (In Oppenheimer, Rabi is portrayed by David Krumholtz.)\n\nAccording to a bio of Rabi from the National Parks Service, he often said: “My mother made me a scientist without ever intending to. Every other Jewish mother in Brooklyn would ask her child after school, ‘So? Did you learn anything today?’ But not my mother. ‘Izzy,’ she would say, ‘did you ask a good question today?’ That difference—asking good questions—made me become a scientist.”\n\nAs a New York Times obituary observed of the University of Chicago faculty member: “Professor Fogel, a rumpled former New Yorker by turns amiable and combative, was widely known for work that aroused objections if not open hostility in academic circles, chiefly through his pioneering use of cliometrics, which applies economic theory and statistical methods to the study of history.”\n\nRobert Holley, PhD ’47\n\nPhysiology or Medicine (1968)\n\nA biochemistry professor on the Hill, Holley was the first person to successfully isolate tRNA—the link between DNA and protein synthesis—and map its structure.\n\nAs part of his graduate studies, Holley spent two years studying at Weill Cornell Medicine (as it’s now known), where he participated in the first chemical synthesis of penicillin.\n\nAfter earning his doctorate, he joined the Cornell faculty in organic chemistry, both at the Geneva Agricultural Experiment Station and in Ithaca.\n\nA facility on the Ithaca campus—the USDA’s Robert W. Holley Center for Agriculture & Health—is named in his honor.\n\nHolley was married to a fellow alum, Arts & Sciences grad Ann Dworkin Holley ’46, BA ’45, MA ’47.\n\nToday, Varmus—the Lewis Thomas University Professor of Medicine at Weill Cornell Medicine—continues conducting research on potential treatment applications of cancer genomes.\n\nKenneth Wilson\n\nPhysics (1982)\n\nThrough his research on phase transitions of matter—from solid to liquid to gas, for example—Wilson developed a theoretical understanding of how to measure “tricky moments like when ice melts or an iron bar loses its magnetism,” according to his New York Times obituary.\n\nHe went on to apply his theories to countless other fields, from abstract math to supercomputing.\n\nHe played a crucial role in the NSF’s establishment of five national scientific supercomputing centers, including one on the Hill.\n\nWilson served on the Cornell faculty from 1963­–87. As the Times also reported, one of the things that drew him to the University was Ithaca’s folk dancing scene. He met his wife—Alison Brown, MS ’85—while doing a Swedish dance called the hambo.\n\nHe also delivered a famed lecture series on the Hill in 1964.\n\nHis Nobel-winning research dealt with using X-rays and electron beams to map molecular structures in gases.\n\nDavid Lee, Douglas Osheroff, PhD ’73 & Robert Richardson\n\nPhysics (1996)\n\nThe trio of experimental physicists shared the Nobel for a discovery regarding helium: they verified that a specific form of the element flows without friction at extremely low temperatures.\n\nThe late Richardson joined the faculty in 1968 and remained on the Hill for his entire career. Osheroff—now a professor emeritus at Stanford—is his former doctoral student.\n\nLee, now 92, joined the Cornell faculty in 1959. He remains a professor emeritus of physics, as well as a distinguished professor at Texas A&M.\n\nTop: Illustration by Caitlin Cook / Cornell University.\n\nPublished September 15, 2023; updated October 9, 2023"
