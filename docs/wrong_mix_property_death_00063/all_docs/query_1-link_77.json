HARDING PRESIDENTIAL LIBRARY AND MUSEUM WHERE THEY'RE GETTING THINGS OUT OF THE VAULT FOR US TO LOOK AT, AND I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING SOME OF THE ITEMS.\n\nHI, SHERRY.\n\nNICE TO MEET YOU.\n\n>> NICE TO MEET YOU.\n\n>> SO WE'RE HERE IN MARION, OHIO, AT THE WARREN G. HARDING PRESIDENTIAL SITES.\n\nCAN YOU TELL US A LITTLE MORE ABOUT THE SITE?\n\n>> I'D BE HAPPY TO.\n\nWE HAVE AN UNUSUAL SETUP HERE IN THAT WE HAVE AN HISTORIC HOME WHERE THE HARDINGS LIVED FOR 30 YEARS PRIOR TO GOING TO THE WHITE HOUSE.\n\nWE HAVE A BRAND-NEW PRESIDENTIAL LIBRARY AND MUSEUM, AND WE HAVE THE NEARBY PRESIDENTIAL GRAVE SITE WHERE PRESIDENT AND MRS. HARDING HAVE BEEN LAID TO REST.\n\nSEEING ALL THREE SITES IN ONE TOWN IS UNUSUAL.\n\n>> WHEN WAS WARREN G. HARDING PRESIDENT?\n\n>> HE WAS PRESIDENT FROM 1921 TO '23.\n\nSO HE DIED IN THE MIDST OF HIS FIRST TERM.\n\n29 MONTHS IN OFFICE, BUT HE'S GOT A FULL STORY TO TELL.\n\nTHAT'S WHAT WE DO HERE.\n\n>> I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING STUFF IN YOUR COLLECTION.\n\nCAN WE LOOK AT IT?\n\n>> LET'S DO IT.\n\n>> ALL RIGHT.\n\n>> THIS MUSEUM IS CHRONOLOGICALLY LAID OUT SO YOU START WITH THE EARLY LIFE OF BOTH LAUREN AND FLORENCE HARDING.\n\nWE HAVE MORE THAN 5,000 OBJECTS IN OUR COLLECTIONS.\n\nAND SO YOU'RE JUST SEEING A SMALL PORTION.\n\nBUT A COUPLE THINGS TO POINT OUT -- WARREN'S FATHER WAS A HOMEOPATHIC PHYSICIAN, THIS IS HIS MEDICAL BAG.\n\nFLORENCE HAS HER SIDE SADDLE THERE.\n\nTHAT DATES TO 1870.\n\nGOT IT WHEN SHE WAS JUST 10 YEARS OLD.\n\nSO A LOT OF THINGS THAT TELL US ABOUT THE PERSONALITIES OF THE HARDINGS YOU'LL FIND IN THE MUSEUM HERE.\n\nTHE PIANO WAS MADE IN 1860, AND IT'S CALLED A CYCLOID PIANO.\n\nIT HAS THREE LEGS.\n\nTHAT'S WHAT FLORENCE LEARNED TO PLAY ON.\n\nSHE WAS TRAINED AS A CLASSICAL PIANIST.\n\nAND THEN AS WARREN GOES INTO ADULTHOOD, HE TALKS TO FRIENDS INTO BUYING A LITTLE DOWN-TRODDEN NEWSPAPER HERE CALLED \"THE MARION DAILY STAR.\"\n\nWE HAVE HIS KEY TO THE OFFICE.\n\nWHAT I LIKE ABOUT THE KEY IS HE CARRIED IT IN HIS POCKET EVEN WHILE HE WAS PRESIDENT.\n\nHE FELT THAT CONNECTION TO WHAT HE ALWAYS CONSIDERED HIMSELF TO BE WAS A NEWSPAPERMAN.\n\nTHE POLITICS IS THE NEXT STAGE OF WARREN'S LIFE.\n\nAND THAT NEWSPAPER CAREER HE STARTED WAS THAT NATURAL SPRINGBOARD.\n\nTHIS IS ACTUALLY HIS OHIO SENATE DESK.\n\n>> HOW LONG WAS HE A SENATOR?\n\n>> HE WAS A SENATOR JUST FOR ONE TERM, AND THEN HE BECOMES LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR OF OHIO, RUNS FOR GOVERNOR, BUT HE LOSES THAT ELECTION.\n\nAND THEN HE'S ELECTED TO THE U.S. SENATE.\n\nSO HE IS OUR FIRST SITTING SENATOR TO BE ELECTED PRESIDENT.\n\nSO THIS IS IT.\n\n>> WOW.\n\n>> THIS IS WHAT WARREN HARDING WORE TO HIS INAUGURATION MARCH 4th, 1921.\n\nHE WAS INAUGURATED OUR 29th PRESIDENT.\n\nTHE PODIUM IS THE VERY ONE THAT HE USED.\n\nAND THE INTERESTING THING ABOUT THAT DAY WAS THERE WAS AN AMPLIFICATION SYSTEM USED FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME.\n\nWE'RE GOING TO GET A LITTLE FLAIR FOR FLORENCE'S TASTE NOW, AND WE'RE GOING TO SEE SOMETHING THAT THE PUBLIC USUALLY DOESN'T GET CLOSE TO.\n\n>> ALL RIGHT.\n\nLET'S GO LOOK AT IT.\n\n>> THIS IS MRS. HARDING'S REPRODUCING PIANO.\n\nAND THIS IS A VERY SOPHISTICATED PLAYER PIANO.\n\nA LOT OF OPERA SINGERS ADVERTISE THAT THEY USE THIS BRAND OR THAT BRAND OF REPRODUCING PIANO TO PRACTICE WITH.\n\n>> IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR HER TO HAVE ONE LIKE THAT.\n\n>> ABSOLUTELY.\n\nREMEMBER, SHE'S GOT THAT CLASSICAL MUSIC BACKGROUND.\n\nAND I'M GOING TO TURN IT ON SO YOU CAN HEAR WHAT IT SOUNDED LIKE.\n\nWE HAD THIS RESTORED BECAUSE WE WANTED PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO HEAR WHAT THE HARDINGS HEARD.\n\n>> YOU HEARD WHAT THE HARDINGS HEARD 100 YEARS AGO.\n\n>> THAT'S AMAZING.\n\n>> MUSIC A BIG PART OF THEIR LIVES.\n\nBUT THAT'S NOT ALL I HAVE TO SHOW YOU TODAY.\n\nI'VE GOT THINGS FROM COLLECTION STORAGE THAT I PULLED OUT ESPECIALLY FOR YOU.\n\n>> ALL RIGHT.\n\nLET'S GO SEE THEM.\n\n>> SO HERE IT LOOKS LIKE WE HAVE A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT ITEMS HERE.\n\nCAN YOU WALK US DOWN THE TABLE?\n\n>> I'D BE HAPPY TO.\n\nTHIS PLAQUE WAS GIVEN TO WARREN HARDING ON THE DAY THAT HE LEFT MARION TO GO TO THE WHITE HOUSE.\n\nTHAT WAS MARCH 2nd, 1921.\n\nTHE INAUGURATION'S TWO DAYS LATER.\n\nIT'S FROM THE CITIZENS OF MARION, THANKING HE AND FLORENCE FOR BEING GOOD CITIZENS AND SUPPORTING THIS TOWN.\n\nTHEY ONLY CAME BACK TO MARION ONCE DURING THE TIME THEY WERE IN THE WHITE HOUSE.\n\nTHAT WAS FOR MARION'S CENTENNIAL CELEBRATION.\n\nI HAVE A VERY ORDINARY ITEM HERE.\n\nTHIS IS A SHIRT COLLAR.\n\nAND IT'S ANOTHER EXTRA STEP IN GETTING DRESSED, YOUR SHIRT WOULD NOT HAVE A COLLAR, YOU'D HAVE TO FASTEN THE COLLAR ONTO IT.\n\nBUT IT'S ALWAYS GOING TO LOOK CRISP AND FRESH AND FORMAL, AND YOU MIGHT CHANGE THESE A COUPLE TIMES A DAY.\n\nAND ANOTHER ORDINARY THING, THIS IS ONE OF HIS HANKER CHIEFS.\n\nI KNOW IT'S REALLY SMALL, BUT IT HAS A MONOGRAM WITH WGH ON IT.\n\nAND WE'VE ACTUALLY COPIED THAT MONOGRAM BECAUSE THE HARDINGS HAD IT ALSO ON THEIR LINENS.\n\nIN THE DOORS HERE AT LIBRARY.\n\nTHERE'S A LOT OF DETAILS IN THE DESIGN OF THE BUILDING, AS WELL.\n\nNOW, THIS IS A WESTERN UNION TELEGRAM SENT TO MR. HARDING'S FATHER, DR. GEORGE T. HARDING, HERE IN MARION FROM FLORENCE.\n\nTHIS IS DURING THE TIME HE'S EXTREMELY ILL IN SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA, THEY'RE NOT SURE HE'S GOING TO MAKE IT.\n\nAND THIS IS DATED JULY 30th, 1923.\n\nAND HE IS GOING TO DIE JUST A FEW DAYS LATER.\n\n>> HE DIDN'T SERVE THE FULL PRESIDENCY THEN.\n\n>> HE DID NOT.\n\nHE SERVED 29 MONTHS.\n\nSO CALVIN COOLIDGE, HIS VICE PRESIDENT, WAS SWORN IN THE NIGHT OF AUGUST 2nd.\n\nTHE FEDORA HERE, ONE OF MY FAVORITES BECAUSE, AGAIN, A VERY ORDINARY THING FOR A MAN TO WEAR, AND IT DOES HAVE HIS NAME IN HERE.\n\n>> THERE YOU GO.\n\nWARREN G. HARDING.\n\n>> YEAH.\n\nHE WORE THIS HAT.\n\nIT WAS MADE IN NEW YORK.\n\nTHIS WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY RECOGNIZABLE TO MR. HARDING.\n\nHIS MOTHER MADE IT.\n\n>> OH.\n\n>> PHOEBE HARDING MADE THIS, IT'S CALLED A CRAZY QUILT.\n\nNO RHYME OR REASON TO IT REALLY.\n\nAND HE WAS VERY, VERY CLOSE TO HIS MOTHER.\n\nSHE DIED IN 1910, THE SAME YEAR HE LOST THE RACE FOR OHIO GOVERNOR.\n\nAND REALLY THAT TOOK HIS ENERGY OUT OF THAT CAMPAIGN.\n\nTHEN THE LAST ITEM IS PRETTY UNUSUAL, BUT THIS IS A PORTABLE MOVIE PROJECTOR.\n\nTHIS WAS USED IN THE WHITE HOUSE.\n\nMR. HARDING DID EMBRACE TECHNOLOGY.\n\nTHAT'S WHEN RADIO IS IN ITS INFANCY.\n\nAND OF COURSE, SILENT MOVIES -- >> WERE THEY SEEING THEM AT THE SAME TIME?\n\nDID THEY GET A PREVIEW?\n\n>> THEY WOULD GET A LIST OF ONES TO CHOOSE FROM.\n\nTHEY MIGHT CHOOSE A BUSTER KEATON AND CHARLIE CHAPLIN FOR VIEWING.\n\nTHEY'D INVITE SOME FRIENDS OVER, AND THEY'D BE UNSTARTS IN -- UPSTAIRS IN THE RESIDENCE OF THE WHITE HOUSE MUCH THE HALLWAY WOULD BE THE IMPROMPTU MOVIE THEATER.\n\n>> THE PERK OF BEING A PRESIDENT.\n\n>> IT IS.\n\nTHE INSTRUCTIONS ARE STILL INSIDE IT.\n\n>> THAT'S AMAZING.\n\nTHESE ARE A LOT OF GREAT ITEMS.\n\nHOW DID YOU GET HOLD OF ALL OF THIS?\n\n>> THIS WAS MRS. HARDING -- I PUT HER ALWAYS AT THE TOP OF THE SUCCESS OF OUR SITE TODAY.\n\nSHE HAD WILLED THE HOUSE AND THE MAJORITY OF CONTENTS TO A GROUP CALLED THE HARDING MEMORIAL ASSOCIATION.\n\nMOST OF OUR PRESIDENTIAL SITES HAVE NOT EVOLVED THAT WAY.\n\nTHEY HAVE SOMETIMES RUN INTO DISREPAIR, AND THEN SOMEONE HAS THE INSIGHT TO SAY WE NEED TO SALVAGE THIS SITE, WE NEED TO PUT IT BACK TOGETHER.\n\nTHAT'S NOT OUR STORY HERE.\n\nWE STAY PRIMARILY INTACT FROM THE TIME THAT MRS. HARDING DIED IN '24 UNTIL THE MUSEUM -- WHICH WAS CALLED THEN AND THE HOME OPENED ON THE '26 TO PRESENT DAY.\n\nTHAT'S WHY WE HAVE SO MANY THINGS.\n\n>> THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR OPENING VAULT TO SEE SOME OF THESE ITEMS THAT ARE UNIQUE TO THE WARREN G. HARDING MUSEUM.\n\n>> YOU'RE VERY WELCOME.\n\nWE'RE REALLY EXCITED TO HAVE PEOPLE COME HERE AND VISIT, AND PROUD TO SHARE IT WITH YOU TODAY.\n\n>> THANK YOU."
