        "text": "Each year, a ceremony honoring the life of President Warren G. Harding is held at the Harding Memorial Presidential Gravesite in Marion, Ohio. The U.S. Army Reserve’s 88th Readiness Division Soldiers support this event, honoring the 29th President’s service to his country. On July 15, 2023, Brig. Gen. Andrew Scarcella, deputy commanding general of the 88th RD, spoke honoring President Harding. Scarcella assisted Dr. Warren G. Harding III, grandnephew of President Harding, in laying a wreath on the gravesite.\n\nChaplain Maj. Johnathan Dodson, 412th Civil Affairs Battalion (Airborne), supported with an opening invocation and Spc. Mindy Strahl, bugler with the 338th Army Band, concluded the ceremony by playing taps. The 88th Readiness Division supports multiple presidential wreath laying ceremonies, on behalf of the Office of the President of the United States.\n\nThe 88th Readiness Division covers 19 states, from the Ohio River valley to the Pacific Northwest and provides services and base operations support to more than 53,000 Reserve Soldiers."
