        "text": "WARREN GAMALIEL HARDING\n\nTWENTY-NINTH PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES\n\nMARCH 4, 1921 — AUGUST 2,1923\n\nA BIBLIOGRAPHY\n\nCompiled by Jerry L. Wallace\n\nCalvin Coolidge knew well and liked Warren G. Harding.\n\nWriting in his Autobiography (p. 180), Mr. Coolidge said this of the Harding Administration in which he served as Vice President:\n\nIt would be difficult to find two years of peace-time history in all the record of our republic that were marked with more important and far-reaching accomplishments.\n\nAfter the Great War, Presidents Harding and Coolidge sought to return the nation to a state of “normalcy,” as Harding put it. What exactly was normalcy? Harding defined it this way:\n\nBy “normalcy” I don’t mean the old order, but a regular steady order of things. I mean normal procedure, the natural way, without excess. (New York Times, July 21, 1920, p. 7)\n\n“There is not a menace in the world today like that of growing public indebtedness and mounting public expenditures….There has seemingly grown up an impression that public treasuries are inexhaustible, and a conviction that no efficiency and no economy are ever thought of in public expenses.”\n\n–President Warren G. Harding addressing the first meeting of the Organization of Government Businessmen, consisting of around 600 individuals comprising Vice President Coolidge, Budget Director Charles Gates Dawes, and other high ranking officials, in the auditorium of the Interior Department at the Capital on the afternoon of June 29, 1921.\n\n“Dawes Puts Whole Government Back Of Economy Drive,” New York Times, June 30, 1921, p. 9.\n\nADAMS, Samuel Hopkins.
