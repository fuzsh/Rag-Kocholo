(A 1930 scholarly article on ratification can be downloaded as a pdf HERE).\n\nSigns the Emergency Quota Act (42 stat 5). In this temporary act, immigration was limited to 3 percent of the total number of foreign-born people from a particular country as recorded in the 1910 census.

Those buried there after the Civil War “did not enter upon the war among the States with primary purpose the end the institution of human slavery. . . .

In Tulsa, Oklahoma, a 19-year-old Black man was arrested on the charge of assaulting a white woman.

Taft is confirmed by Senate on the same day. Taft is the only former president to be named to the Court. (Link to image of original nomination document.)\n\nIn an Address to the Senate, urges the rejection of a bill to adjust compensation for World War I veterans, as “the enactment of the compensation bill in the midst of the struggle for readjustment and restoration would hinder every effort and greatly imperil the financial stability of our country.”\n\nIn response to the \"Battle of Blair Mountain,\" issues Proclamation demanding armed coal miners and operators protesting in West Virginia return home peaceably by noon 09/01/1921.

(More background on the Sheppard-Towner Act is here.)\n\nFirst Annual Message. Urges permanent tariff revisions, and calls for tariffs to allow “more flexibility and elasticity” suggesting this might be entrusted to the Tariff Commission. He further suggests “giving authority to the Chief Executive, who could proclaim additional duties to meet conditions which the Congress may designate.” Also calls for encouraging a “cooperative marketing program.”\n\nAddress Closing the Washington Conference. “Those of us who live another decade are more likely to witness a growth of public opinion, strengthened by the new experience, which will make nations more concerned with living to the fulfilment of God’s high intent than with agencies of warfare and destruction.”\n\nWashington Naval Treaty, also known as the Five-Power Treaty, signed by the USA, Britain, France, Italy and Japan with the goal of limiting naval armaments.

It is adopted by the Senate 58-0 with 38 not voting. (See Congressional Record April 29, 1922, p. 6096 ff; pdf of Cong Record.) The investigation was assigned to the Committee on Public Lands and was led by the most junior minority member, Senator Thomas Walsh.\n\nVetoes the Soldiers’ Bonus Bill, arguing that adjusted compensation for World War I veterans is less of a priority than is ameliorating the nation’s debt.

At a signing ceremony, Harding stated that “if we succeed in making effective the elastic provisions of the measure it will be the greatest contribution to tariff making in the nation’s history.” (See request in Annual Address above). This also contributed to the growth of executive power. (Quote is from New York Times 09/22/1922 p.1.)\n\nFilling a vacancy caused by the death of Senator Thomas E. Watson, Rebecca L. Felton is appointed by Georgia Governor Thomas Hardwick. The appointment is largely symbolic since Congress would not be in session.
