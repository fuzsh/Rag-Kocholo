The 1920 Presidential election was the first election in American history where women were allowed the right to vote at the federal level. Many historians consider the votes of millions of women to be a contributing factor in the victory for President Warren G. Harding. Students will analyze primary source documents before the time period of 1920 to interpret social factors in American society that women were pressing politicians to support for suffrage. The greater goal of the activity is for students to be able to compare and contrast the after-effects of promoting women’s suffrage. The classroom activity can be individually based, or students may work in pairs or quads to complete the National Archives and Records Administration Written Document Analysis Worksheet.\n\nRationale (why are you doing this?)\n\nWell before the 1920 presidential campaign was officially under way, it became apparent that the 1920 election would be a referendum on the policies of President Woodrow Wilson. Aside from his health woes, Wilson’s second term as president had attracted much criticism including the failure to keep the country out of the Great War, his failure to involve congressional voices in his negotiation of the Treaty of Versailles in 1919 and the postwar peace settlement involving his support for the League of Nations. Lesser known, however, is that Wilson was late to jump on the suffrage bandwagon for women further hurting the Democrats chances of retaking the White House. The Republicans saw a chance for millions of new voters to turn out at the polls supporting the Republican ticket of Warren G. Harding and Calvin Coolidge. Suffragettes, such as Corrine Roosevelt Robinson, the younger sister of President Theodore Roosevelt, adamantly promoted support for the Republican candidates. Women would be a deciding factor in the election of 1920 for President Harding and had been advocating for a voice and influence in politics for change beginning in the 1870s. Furthermore, women would play prominent roles in the abolitionist and later civil rights movements and temperance movements for the Republican Party.\n\nLesson Objectives - the student will\n\nStudents will be able to analyze the various primary source writings of suffragettes advocating for women’s’ rights before the creation and passing of the 19th Amendment.\n\nStudents will be able to interpret various women’s’ political movements that existed before the creation and passing of the 19th Amendment.\n\nStudents will be able to describe the clash of liberal versus conservative values during various decades of US Society (1870-1920).\n\nDistrict, state, or national performance and knowledge standards/goals/skills met\n\nMissouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education (DESE) Social Studies Standards:\n\nIn Social Studies, students in Missouri public schools will acquire a solid foundation which includes knowledge of\n\n1. principles\n\n1.

What will both the teacher and the students do?\n\nThe National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) has some great primary source document sheets for students to analyze various sources. The one used for this activity to analyze the women’s primary sources can be found at: National Archives and Records Administration Written Document Analysis Worksheet.\n\nStudents can do this as an individual activity, but preferably, students should be placed in a pair or groups of 3-4 students. Each pair or group of students should have a set of the primary sources.\n\nStudents will use the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) Written Document Analysis Worksheet to analyze and use critical thinking skills on various primary source writings of suffragettes advocating for women’s’ rights before the creation and passing of the 19th Amendment.\n\nThe teacher will identify how many National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) Written Document Analysis Worksheets that he/she would like each individual student to fill out. If it is a one-day lesson, then 2-3 worksheets should be filled out and if it is a two-day lesson then 4-5 worksheets should be filled out. The goal of the activity is to allow students to analyze as many resources as possible and begin describing the changing nature of social values in various time periods (1870-1920) across America.\n\nAfter completion of the activity the teacher should have a discussion with the students as an opening bell-ringer or longer classroom activity the following day on how the influence of women in American politics has helped shape political issues over time.\n\nAssessment: fully explain the assessment method in detail or create and attach a scoring guide\n\nOriginal Rubric Can be Found at: http://faculty.uncfsu.edu/jibrooks/FRMS/WkbkP.htm"
