        "text": "29th President\n\nTerms: 1921-1923\n\nPolitical Party: Republican\n\nFirst Lady: Florence Kling Harding\n\nVice President: Calvin Coolidge\n\nOverview\n\nBorn: November 2, 1865 in Corsica, Ohio... First United States senator to be elected president... An air of scandal and corruption infuses the legacy of the Harding administration. His election, predicated on a pledge to return the nation to \"normalcy,\" ushered in a period of conservative Republicanism designed to slow the momentum of progressive legislation. Even the few noble accomplishments achieved by his administration were soon forgotten as tales of cronyism, greed, and influence-peddling came to light. Harding fell from favor with the American public soon after his untimely, and at the time, controversial death... Died: August 2, 1923.\n\nThe Era\n\n1920: First commercial radio broadcast\n\n1920: The League of Nations formed\n\n1921: Italian-born anarchists Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti found guilty of murder and sentenced to death\n\n1921: Japanese prime minister assassinated\n\n1922: T. S. Eliot publishes The Wasteland\n\n1922: Reader's Digest begins publication\n\nDomestic Policy\n\nWarren Harding took office promising to undo many of the progressive policies of Woodrow Wilson's administration. Ushering in an era of conservative Republicanism, Harding wasted little time in cutting taxes on higher incomes and raising tariff rates. However, charges of patronage and wrongdoing sidetracked the president's agenda early in his administration. The accusations later proved to be true. In the wake of scandals and his untimely death while still in office, Harding's domestic achievements lost what little luster they had.\n\nForeign Affairs\n\nHarding's short term as president prevented him from crafting a distinctive foreign policy and from making peace arrangements in the Pacific. His style was to defer to Congress as much as possible. The Washington Disarmament Conference of 1921 is a good example. The conference, which succeeded in reducing the navies of the United States, Great Britain, France, Germany, Japan, and Italy, came at the insistence of the Senate, not the administration."
