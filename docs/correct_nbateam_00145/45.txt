(PHILADELPHIA) — The Philadelphia 76ers prized offseason addition, center Andrew Bynum, hasn’t played a single minute for the team yet this season, but hopes to return after the All-Star break.

Bynum, who’s been battling knee problems all season, took part in shooting drills and other on-court activities on Monday to inch nearer to a return to the court. He’s also started to add weightlifting to his workout routine. Bynum says he’s knees are feeling better and better each day.

“They’re the best I’ve had in a long time, so they look really, really good to me,” Bynum said on Monday.

The Sixers acquired the All-Star center in a four-team blockbuster trade. When healthy, Bynum is one of the best centers in all of basketball. The problem is that he’s battled knee issues his entire career. Last season though, he played in 60 out of 66 games and averaged 18.7 points and 11.8 rebounds per game.

The 25-year-old Bynum said he will be ready “around the All-Star break,” which is in mid-February.

Philadelphia could use Bynum on the court, the team is 16-22 and ranks 22nd in the NBA in rebounding per game.
