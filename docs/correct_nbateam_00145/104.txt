When the Philadelphia 76ers made a trade for Andrew Bynum, they expected a top NBA center with franchise-altering potential.

In his lone season, Bynum had no effect on the Sixers, but it's hard to change a team from the sidelines.

Now, according to an Akron Beacon Journal report, he's ready to play in Philadelphia this Friday, as a member of the Cleveland Cavaliers, who signed him to a two-year, $24 million deal this offseason.

"Just another game," Bynum told the Beacon Journal.

While Bynum sees no significance in the game, he's aware that Sixers fans could feel differently.

"I think they’ll probably boo, but that’s their choice," he said.

Bynum has played in all but one contest of his Cavaliers stint, which is now at four games.

Obviously, that's more than he did in an entire year with the Sixers. Bynum is aware of this, but doesn't feel any regret when he looks back at how things ended in Philadelphia.

"It wasn’t my choice to get rid of me," Bynum said. "I don’t feel bad at all. ... If I was not hurt, I would’ve played. That’s really the end to that story."
