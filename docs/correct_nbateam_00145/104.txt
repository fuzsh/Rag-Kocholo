CLEVELAND -- Andrew Bynum has a new team waiting for him.

The enigmatic free-agent center, who didn't play a single second for Philadelphia last season because of knee injuries, is considering a two-year offer from the Cleveland Cavaliers, a person familiar with the negotiations told The Associated Press on Tuesday.

Cleveland made the offer, which includes a team option in the second year, during his visit to the Cavaliers' facility. Bynum did not work out but the team examined him thoroughly.

The person with knowledge of the negotiations spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the talks. Yahoo Sports first reported the offer and said it was worth $24 million.

The Cavaliers have already landed forward Earl Clark and guard Jarrett Jack in free agency and are looking to move up quickly. They would immediately vault into contention in the Eastern Conference with a healthy Bynum paired with All-Star guard Kyrie Irving.

The 25-year-old Bynum, however, had arthroscopic surgery on both knees in March, but the Cavaliers apparently are confident he will return to the form that made him one of the NBA's best centers.

They're also counting on him thriving under Cleveland coach Mike Brown. The two spent one season together with the Los Angeles Lakers and Bynum had his best year, averaging 18.7 points and 11.8 rebounds. Over the past four seasons, Bynum has averaged 14.7 points and 9.5 rebounds.

The 76ers acquired Bynum last season from the Lakers as part of a four-team trade.

Bynum, who made $16.9 million despite not playing last season, is expected to meet with the Atlanta Hawks and Dallas Mavericks before making a decision. The Mavericks are desperate to add a quality center after missing out on Dwight Howard.
