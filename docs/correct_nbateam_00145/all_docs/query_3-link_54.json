        "text": "CLEVELAND (AP) – Andrew Bynum has a new team waiting for him.\n\nThe enigmatic free-agent center, who didn’t play a single second for Philadelphia last season because of knee injuries, is mulling a two-year offer from the Cleveland Cavaliers, a person familiar with the negotiations told The Associated Press on Tuesday.\n\nCleveland made the offer, which includes a team option in the second year, during his visit to the Cavs’ facility Monday. Bynum did not work out but the team examined him thoroughly.\n\nThe person with knowledge of the negotiations spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the talks. Yahoo! Sports first reported Cleveland’s offer and said it was worth $24 million.\n\nThe 25-year-old Bynum had arthroscopic surgery on both knees in March, but the Cavs apparently are confident he will return to the form that made him one of the NBA’s best centers.\n\nThey’re also counting on him thriving under Cleveland coach Mike Brown, who has returned to the Cavs after being fired three years ago. Brown and Bynum spent one season together with the Los Angeles Lakers and the 7-footer had his best year, averaging 18.7 points and 11.8 rebounds. Over the past four seasons, Bynum has averaged 14.7 points and 9.5 rebounds.\n\nCleveland has competition in its pursuit of Bynum, who was scheduled to meet with the Atlanta Hawks on Tuesday and is expected to visit Dallas on Wednesday. The Mavericks need a big man after losing out in the Dwight Howard sweepstakes.\n\nIt’s not clear when Bynum will make his decision. The NBA’s free-agency moratorium period ends Wednesday.\n\nHis agent, David Lee, did not immediately respond to a phone message.\n\nThe Cavs have already landed forward Earl Clark and guard Jarrett Jack in free agency and are looking to move up quickly. They would immediately vault into contention in the Eastern Conference with a healthy Bynum paired with All-Star guard Kyrie Irving and a roster that includes forward Tristan Thompson, guard Dion Waiters and forward Anthony Bennett, the No. 1 overall pick in last month’s draft.\n\nThe Sixers acquired Bynum last summer from the Lakers as part of a four-team trade.\n\nBynum, who made $16.9 million despite not playing last season, never got healthy enough to get on the floor with the Sixers.\n\nThe Cavs would be taking a risk with Bynum that could have huge rewards. He would instantly raise their profile and probably get them back to the playoffs after winning just 66 games combined the past three seasons. In giving him only a two-year deal, they would not be tying up much money which would allow them to stay flexible next summer when several top-tier free agents – possibly LeBron James – will be on the market."
