        "text": "According to an espn.com report, Philadelphia’s newly acquired big-man, Andrew Bynum is set to rest his ailing knees for up to three weeks as he continues physical therapy.\n\nThe 76ers organization made the decision Monday, just one day before the start of training camp, to continue to rest Bynum to ensure he’s ready for the regular season opener on October 31.\n\nBynum has being using treatment, called Orthokine, which involves injections of plasma-rich platelets that heal arthritis in the knees. It’s the same treatment several superstar athletes have sworn by, including former teammate of Bynum, Kobe Bryant and even Alex Rodriguez.\n\nBynum reiterated statments from the organization that his sitting out of camp is merely a precaution and that there are no signs of swelling in his knees.\n\n“I feel a lot better,” Bynum said. “The Orthokine is definitely working.”\n\nThere is obviously still a lot of concern surrounding Bynum, who has been plagued by numerous injuries throughout his seven-year career in the NBA, but he was able to play in 60 of the Lakers’ 66 games last season and managed to avoid missing significant time.\n\nAfter trading Andre Iguodala for Bynum this offseason, the 76ers declared their intention to build the franchise around their new star, so they want to make sure he’s as ready physically as he is mentally at this stage in his career.\n\n“I’m looking forward to the opportunity to kind of cement yourself and take the next step in your career,” Bynum said."
