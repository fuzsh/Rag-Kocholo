        "text": "ANDREW Bynum became the youngest player in NBA history when he debuted for the Los Angeles Lakers in 2005 aged 18 years and six days.\n\nBut after a series of injuries and off-court issues, the two-time NBA champion was out of the league in 2014 aged just 26.\n\nThe 7-foot, 280-pound center was drafted straight out of high school by Lakers executives Jim Buss and Mitch Kupchak as the heir-apparent to Shaquille O'Neal, who had departed for the Miami Heat.\n\nBynum managed to win two titles with the Lakers alongside Kobe Bryant and was even selected to the NBA All-Star team in 2012.\n\nBut the No. 10 Draft pick is widely considered one of the biggest busts in Lakers history due to concerns over his maturity and attitude coupled with multiple knee injuries.\n\nThe Lakers even brought in legend Kareem Abdul-Jabbar to work as his personal coach to get him up to speed with the NBA.\n\nBut the NBA Hall of Famer was frustrated by Bynum's lack of focus and effort.\n\n\"I believe Andrew has always had the potential to help a team when he puts his heart into it,\" Abdul-Jabbar said.\n\n\"He just doesn’t seem to be consistent with his commitment to the game.\n\n\"That can lead to a lot of frustration for any team that has signed him.\n\n\"When I worked with Andrew I found him to be bright and hardworking.\n\n\"But I think he got bored with the repetitive nature of working on basketball fundamentals day in and day out... but they are the keys to long term success.\"\n\nBynum came to symbolize Jim Buss' ill-fated tenure in charge of the Lakers before his sister Jeanie took over.\n\nIn 2007, the Lakers were offered Jason Kidd in a trade for Bynum but the team refused.\n\n\"Are you kidding me?\" an exasperated Byrant said over the failed trade.\n\nAfter he was eventually shipped out by the Lakers, Bynum was traded to the Philadelphia 76ers in 2012 but did not play a game for them due to injury.\n\nThat season Bynum further injured one of his knees while bowling, causing the ire of the 76ers fanbase.\n\n\"In hindsight, I guess you shouldn't go bowling,\" he said.\n\n\"It's not more than anything I've done in my rehab.\"\n\nPhiladelphia legend Julius \"Dr J\" Erving went so far as to describe Bynum as \"damaged goods.\"\n\nHe then briefly appeared for the Cleveland Cavaliers before being suspended for being a disruptive presence during practice, including shooting every time he got the ball regardless of where it was on the court.\n\n\"I did [it] on purpose because it was over there for me,\" he admitted.\n\nThe Cavaliers traded Bynum to the Indiana Pacers in 2014 but he played just two games for them before his career unceremoniously ended aged 26.\n\n\"There's been a... suspicious trend with Bynum since about 2011,\" one report said.\n\n\"Every team he's been signed to has suffered locker room dysfunction and on-court disaster.\n\n\"I mean... Lakers... Sixers... Cavaliers... the dude has left more disaster in his wake than Godzilla.\"\n\nIn 2018, Bynum worked out with the Lakers as he attempted a comeback but it did not materialize."
