        "text": "Former Cleveland Cavaliers and Los Angeles Lakers center Andrew Bynum is meeting with the Indiana Pacers, the Indianapolis Star reported Friday night.\n\nBynum's agent, David Lee, confirmed the report.\n\n\"(Bynum) has not signed as yet,\" Lee told the Star.\n\nTalks between the sides, however, reportedly are serious, and a deal could be completed before Monday, a source told FOX Sports Ohio.\n\nBynum played 24 games for the Cavs this season, including nine starts. The 7-footer averaged 8.4 points and 5.3 rebounds after missing all of last season with the Philadelphia 76ers with knee issues. Bynum underwent surgery on both knees just less than a year ago.\n\nBynum was suspended by the Cavs in late December for conduct detrimental to the team. The Cavs then traded him to the Chicago Bulls on Jan. 7 (for forward Luol Deng). The Bulls immediately waived Bynum and he has been a free agent since.\n\nThe Pacers (35-10) own the best record in the Eastern Conference. They already possess an All-Star center in 7-foot-2 starter Roy Hibbert.\n\nBynum, 26, was drafted out of high school in 2005, when the Lakers selected him with the No. 10 overall pick. He spent the first seven years of his career in LA, and was a key component in the Lakers' championship seasons of 2009 and 2010.\n\nHowever, he has struggled with knee issues his entire career.\n\nFormer Lakers coach Phil Jackson recently told FOX Sports he thought Bynum may try to play again.\n\n\"He had a time where he was playing pretty well this year,\" Jackson said in an interview with FOX Sports Live. \"I don't know the inside story to that thing (with the Cavs). That situation is unfortunate because he's talented.\"\n\nBynum averaged 18.7 points and 11.8 rebounds during his final season with the Lakers (2011-12),while playing under current Cavs coach Mike Brown.\n\n\"He had a great year when Mike Brown was (coaching the Lakers),\" Jackson said. \"I thought he played All-Star caliber. He was the best scoring center in the league, and he's got a great touch. I think he's done the most you can possibly do for your knees.\"\n\nBynum was traded to the Sixers following the 2011-12 season in a blockbuster deal that sent Dwight Howard (now with the Houston Rockets) to the Lakers."
