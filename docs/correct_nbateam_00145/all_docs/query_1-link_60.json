        "text": "PHILADELPHIA — Ask any kid what the hardest part of Christmas is and the answer is simple — waiting to play with their new toys.\n\nPhiladelphia 76ers fans have been waiting a long time to open their Christmas present this season, and the wait is coming to an end. Andrew Bynum continues to work his way back to the court, and more importantly he continues to feel good.\n\n“We’re very encouraged, but I think the most important thing is he’s encouraged that he’s feeling better,” Sixers head coach Doug Collins said. “You can always tell when guys start feeling better.”\n\nThere has never been a concrete plan for how Bynum would progress through his rehab — at least not one that was made public. But like anything, Bynum has had an idea of where he should be based on what the doctors have told him through the process and how his body feels.\n\nWhen asked to give an assessment on how he was progressing, Bynum was optimistic in his answer.\n\n“A little bit farther ahead, I honestly believe that,” he said. “Before I started getting better I thought I was going to have to play through a lot of pain, but the pain is subsiding a bit.”\n\nThe Sixers have seven games left before the All-Star break, which is when Bynum has implied he was looking to return.\n\nThere has been some talk about trying to get him in the lineup before the break. This way they can see where he is and how his knees react while giving him some extra time off after his first couple of games back.\n\nBut it doesn’t seem like Bynum shares that same thought process.\n\n“I think right after the All-Star break in my mind,” he said. “I talked about (coming back before the break), but to me it doesn’t really matter when I come back. I think giving myself the extra week of training would be better than trying to come back before that.”\n\nWhenever his return finally does come, it will be a welcome sight. It will also change the way the Sixers look on the court.\n\n“Any time you can throw the ball in the paint, I think it changes your team,” Collins said. “When you have that threat, you don’t have to run three guys off a screen to get a shot. The game (becomes) real simple. Throw the ball in there and see if they double. If they don’t let’s get the ball to the basket and if they do kick it out for the 3.\n\n“Also when you run the pick-and-roll you can’t leave him because if you throw that ball up near the rim, he’ll dunk it.”\n\nThis whole process has been tough on everyone involved with the team, but especially on Bynum. Besides looking for a new contract at the end of the season, Bynum has been trying to shake the perception of himself that he doesn’t care about basketball.\n\nHe has been called one of the best big men in the game, and he finally had a chance this season to show what he can do as the focal point of an offense. Unfortunately, he has been forced to sit on the sideline since he got to town.\n\n“When you’re hurt, you don’t feel like you’re a part of team,” Collins said. “Especially a guy who’s been traded here, you never feel like you’re a part of the team no matter how much you are around because when you’re not out there playing and competing you just feel like a spectator and it’s a very helpless feeling.”\n\nBut with every time Bynum steps on the practice floor he gets that much closer to stepping on the floor for a game.\n\nHe still hasn’t done everything he needs to do to say he is 100 percent, but he is continuing to work to that point.\n\n“A little bit, baby steps,” Bynum said of his increase in work load at practice. “Still no slides, but I dunked yesterday so it’s good to know I can still do that. I’m gradually increasing. Did sprints today, so (slides are) the next step.”\n\n“I think Andrew is starting to get more (in-tune) with his teammates in our shoot-arounds,” Collins added. “He’s been down with the big guys walking through some things and shooting a little bit. I get a sense that he’s getting that feeling of getting back in the mix which is nice.”"
