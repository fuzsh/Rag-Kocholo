        "text": "LOS ANGELES – Leave it to Tex Winter, who while on the Lakers’ staff was one of Andrew Bynum’s harshest critics, to have the explanation for why Bynum has turned his career and this entire Lakers season around.\n\nWinter espoused a theory that has always stuck with Phil Jackson’s longtime mental-health consultant, George Mumford, during their years together building up all those Bulls’ and Lakers’ brains to win all those NBA championships.\n\nAccording to “The Readiness Principle,” as Mumford calls Winter’s Buddhist idea: When the student is ready, the teacher will appear.\n\nThe patient wisdom in that statement did not keep the passionate Winter from ranting and raving about what young Bynum wouldn’t learn early in his Lakers career, but ask either Michael Jordan or Kobe Bryant, and they’ll tell you how much they appreciated Winter’s ranting and raving in a world of gushing and groveling around them.\n\nFor all of Bynum’s massive potential, not even Jim Buss would dare to compare Bynum to Jordan and Bryant. When it comes down to it, though, there is only going to be one fully accredited graduate from the Phil Jackson School of Zen Thought moving forward for a full NBA career to come, bridging this era of dynastic basketball with whatever might be next.\n\nThe 23-year-old Bynum has throughout his six seasons been the baby of this family.\n\nThat also makes him the one and only rising son.\n\nSo it’s downright fascinating – and impressive for them both – that Bynum has reached this point here before Jackson retires. It has not happened as much through medical miracle with Bynum’s much-scrutinized physical health as because Bynum has made a mental breakthrough … and that happens to be the sort of personal power Jackson harnesses infinitely better than your average coach.\n\nIn this case, it wasn’t actually Jackson’s coaching voice that triggered Bynum’s leap from being talented to playing like a man.\n\nAsked when things began to take off for Bynum, Jackson didn’t cite the apparent answer of the All-Star break, at which time Jackson and Bynum had a meaningful talk about what changes Bynum planned to refocus his game on defense and rebounding. Jackson’s answer as to the root of Bynum’s revolution was one word: “Boston.”\n\nIt was in Boston on Feb. 10 that Jackson sat the entire Lakers team like schoolchildren in the courtside seats of TD Garden before shoot-around – turning the floor over to Mumford to motivate. Bynum went head-to-head with Mumford, and a seed was planted in Bynum’s head.\n\nThe Lakers beat the Celtics that night with Bynum playing well, though it wasn’t until more than a week later that the beanstalk really began to grow … after Bynum disappointed himself and the team in three consecutive Lakers losses.\n\nThe dire part of the motivation equation is what Mumford calls “A.O.F.” – the last two acronym words being “on” and “fire,” the first word citing the body part that must get in gear for any of us to be productive.\n\nBynum has always had an analytical mind and a curious nature. But after the embarrasing losing streak set his A.O.F., the advisory words from Mumford he’d found interesting and sensible suddenly crystallized into pure fuel for his 290-pound body to run like never before.\n\n“The mind and body are not separate; they are connected,” Mumford said. “Sometimes working on the body directly is not going to get it. And sometimes working on the mind directly is not going to get it. But if you can get the two to talk to each other, you’re probably into some good stuff.”\n\nThe specific advice from Mumford that got Bynum’s mind to tell his body to break through the limiting beliefs and easy excuses was not groundbreaking or even new to anyone who has followed Jackson’s career from afar.\n\n“To me, what it comes down to is being in the moment,” Mumford said. “You’ve heard a lot of people say it. You’ve heard Kobe say it. You’ve heard M.J. say it. That’s what it’s about. It’s about being here now and focusing on what you’re doing – and not worrying about how you’re doing.”\n\nBynum said it was Mumford’s way of connecting with him – it’s not hard to see some similarities in their easygoing, easy-smiling demeanors – that made the message ultimately resonate. Even though Mumford doesn’t stay with the Lakers for three entire months, as he did during their 2000-02 championship run, he said he and Jackson remain “kindred spirits” and Mumford annually meets the Lakers in Boston, where he is headquartered. Bynum said he has had “a bunch of good conversations” with Mumford over the years.\n\n“It’s just the way he goes about his explanation, because a lot of people can offer advice or try to put you down or do whatever,” Bynum said. “But his particular style just fits with me.\n\n“His big thing is he creates a space for you to be you. That’s all he really does. He kind of takes away what everybody else is doing and just focuses on how to get you prepared mentally for a game, for a task, for anything it is that you want to do.”\n\nWhat Bynum wanted to do was surrender the predisposition that great players score lots of points and then help the Lakers dominate in the way Jackson has long preached to him: defense and rebounding.\n\nJust like that, Bynum has done it.\n\nSince the All-Star break, Bynum has averaged 12.4 rebounds and 2.5 blocks. He has added 11.8 points per game on 62.6 percent field-goal shooting. The Lakers are 15-1.\n\nEven after the last game, in which Bynum was limited to five rebounds in 22 minutes because of fouls he definitely did not agree with, Bynum happily detailed how he’s playing a whole different ballgame.\n\n“It’s how to focus, how always to reset,” Bynum said. “If I got bad calls before, maybe I would’ve blown up or gotten a technical or done something crazy. I mean, I was mad; I was hot. But I just walked off the court, sat down and waited for an opportunity for the game to present something for me to do.”\n\nSure enough, Bynum scored seven points in seven minutes right after he was called for his fifth foul and New Orleans had cut the Lakers’ lead to six points early in the fourth quarter Sunday night. He stayed patient with his post moves in stark contrast to the way he has rushed through them and shot too quickly when feeling pressure in the past.\n\n“All things will work out,” Bynum said. “Just don’t react so much. Just bring yourself back to focus, and you’ll be all right.”\n\nThose who dismiss Jackson’s mind games as mumbo jumbo can feel free to believe it’s all about the cartilage in Bynum’s right knee being more firmly reattached, his conditioning having improved or maybe even his nutritionist’s lean protein and brown rice.\n\nBut only Bynum knows how much easier it is for him to sense which way a ball is going to bounce if he’s really looking at it. He describes the high-speed, loud-arena NBA action now as “quiet” until the whistle blows to stop play.\n\n“It’s really quiet,” he said.\n\nHe is simply locked in mentally, which also means no longer fretting over every twinge he feels.\n\nEven early this season, Bynum’s extreme caution in coming back to relieve some of Pau Gasol’s and Lamar Odom’s overburdens left many in the Lakers’ inner circle losing faith that Bynum’s grit last postseason was any sort of coming of age.\n\nNow? Jackson could not put it any more broadly than this statement: “He’s thrown out any concern he has on health issues.”\n\nThe one bad thing that has happened to Bynum – his flagrant foul on an airborne Michael Beasley after just before on offense feeling frustration of missing a dunk and not getting a foul call, resulting in a two-game NBA suspension – was a reminder about staying in the moment, too.\n\n“He carried a play from one end of the court to the other,” Jackson said. “Basketball is really a game where you have to let things go.”\n\nAnd there you see Jackson’s handle on the switch Bynum flipped.\n\nJackson is the most successful coach in NBA history, the guy whom Bryant credited even back when they didn’t get along so well for teaching him that long-term goals were best achieved by letting go of them.\n\n“It’s him and Vince Lombardi,” Bryant said in a quiet moment earlier this season: “As far as coaches, him and Vince Lombardi. That’s it.”\n\nAnd what a beautiful thing it is to see a coach touch a player’s career and life so meaningfully, even if in Bynum’s case it was Mumford as the medium. Jackson is still making magic.\n\nThis is certainly not, however, just a credit to the teacher.\n\nWinter, who stopped consulting for the Lakers in 2009, used to wonder if Bynum, the youngest player ever drafted into the NBA, was really motivated from within. We now have the answer.\n\nInstead of resting on the laurels of titles and money, Bynum got his A.O.F. – and not because he was being called irresponsible for delaying surgery 41 days after last season, not because he was idly dreaming of being an All-Star, not because he was hearing the Carmelo Anthony trade rumors, not because he had let the team down and the Lakers’ streak of championships had already ended.\n\nIt says a lot about Bynum that he acted at this time and on his own.\n\n“I just do what I do, man: I talk,” Mumford said. “And people who can hear what I’m saying will hear it. People who don’t, won’t. It’s really that simple.”"
