        "text": "The Philadelphia 76ers got a major upgrade at the center position, adding 7-footer Andrew Bynum to their young, developing core. But reports indicate the Sixers pulled the trigger in last night’s blockbuster deal without any assurances about Bynum’s future in Philly. Bynum is scheduled to be a free agent in 2013, and it remains to been seen how he’ll approach his new home. More details, via ESPN.com: “Philadelphia has not spoken to Bynum or his representatives, and has no assurances he will sign a long-term extension with the team. ‘The Sixers are willing to take a shot (without Bynum’s commitment),’ one source said. Although Bynum signing an extension with the 76ers is not out of the question, according to a source, his stance all summer has been he only will sign an extension with the Lakers. Bynum, who grew up about an hour away from Philadelphia in Plainsboro, N.J., could sign a three-year, $60 million extension this season or wait to become a free agent after the season and be eligible for a five-year, $102 million deal.”"
