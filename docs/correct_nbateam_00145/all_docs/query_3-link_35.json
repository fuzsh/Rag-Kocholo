        "text": "It’s a gamble, but one the Cavaliers felt they had to take. Free agent center Andrew Bynum accepted the Cavs’ two-year, $24.5 million offer on Wednesday. It’s a complicated, incentive-laden deal, with $6 million guaranteed for next season. The Cavs own a team option on 2014-15. The move was first reported by ESPN’s Chris Broussard. The 7-foot, 285-pound Bynum missed the entire 2012-13 season in Philadelphia with bilateral bone bruises and a weakened cartilage in both knees. He had arthroscopic knee surgery on March 19. If Bynum doesn’t pan out next season, the Cavs simply walk away at the end of the season. If he plays well, the Cavs have the option of bringing him back the following season. Bynum, 25, visited with the Cavs on Monday, Atlanta on Tuesday and Dallas on Wednesday. Despite the money involved, when Bynum and agent David Lee inspected all three rosters, they kept coming back to the Cavs. Bynum won’t have to shoulder the load on his own. The Cavs have legitimate depth in their frontcourt, including Anderson Varejao, Tristan Thompson, Tyler Zeller, No. 1 overall pick Anthony Bennett and newcomer Earl Clark. The Cavs could start Bynum at center and Varejao at power forward. Interestingly enough, when Bynum was traded to Philadelphia last Aug. 10 — a trade the Cavs were involved in at least early on — Clark was sent from Orlando to the Lakers along with Dwight Howard. Bynum becomes a centerpiece on a team that also features one of the top backcourts in basketball: All-Star Kyrie Irving, free-agent acquisition Jarrett Jack and Dion Waiters. The Cavs are expected to challenge for a playoff spot in the Eastern Conference next season. The Cavs’ Mike Brown was Bynum’s coach during the 2011-12 season with the Lakers. The 25-year-old Bynum averaged 18.7 points, 11.8 rebounds and 1.9 blocks and shot 55.8 percent from the field to earn a spot on the Western Conference All-Star team. The Cavs were able to offer more than Atlanta or Dallas in the first year of the deal. Mavericks owner Mark Cuban, desperate to make a big move, wanted to add the former Lakers center. Dallas had already been spurned by Howard, who chose to sign with Houston. “At this point, we’re having a medical discussion and we’ll have an opportunity to get with his agent and better understand the risks involved and make a good decision for our franchise,” Mavericks GM Donnie Nelson told the Dallas Morning News. “We’re in the process of gathering information. We still need help and support in the frontcourt and we’re going to turn over every stone.” Dallas entered into negotiations with Samuel Dalembert after they struck out with Bynum. The Mavericks, as they are presently constructed, don’t appear to be a .500 team, especially in the West. They have an aging roster with some bloated contracts. They’ve added point guards Jose Calderon and Devin Harris in free agency. Some around the league wondered how interested the Hawks were in signing Bynum. The Hawks have signed power forward Paul Millsap and sharpshooter Kyle Korver in free agency. It’s unknown when Bynum can return to the court work. He’s expected to be ready for training camp, but even then, his minutes will be monitored and the Cavs will be cautious with him. The Cavs’ partnership with the Cleveland Clinic could make a big difference in Bynum’s rehabilitation. The still have the salary-cap flexibility to sign a significant free agent in the summer of 2014. They don’t have any cap space available. However, they still own a mid-level exception worth $2.652 million for teams under the cap. Quick shots o The Cavs have called an 11 a.m. Friday press conference at Cleveland Clinic Courts to introduce free-agent signees Jack and Clark. A spokesman said he doesn’t expect Bynum to be present at the press conference. o Cavs assistant coach Jamahl Mosley will serve as head coach the Cavs’ summer-league team in Las Vegas. Cavs assistant coaches Jim Boylan, Bret Brielmaier and Cavaliers player development coordinator Phil Handy will all serve as assistant coaches. They face the Lakers in their first game at 8 p.m. Friday (NBA TV). o There has been some chatter that the Cavs and Warriors would work a sign-and-trade deal with Jack coming to Cleveland and forward/center Marreese Speights going to Golden State. However, the Cavs reportedly nixed that idea. Any team that receives a player in a sign-and-trade would have to operate with a hard cap. o The NBA announced the salary cap for the 2013-14 season will be $58.679 million. The luxury-tax threshold has been set at $71.748 million. o Some have wondered how the Mavericks could sign former Cavs guard Wayne Ellington since they were hoarding their cap space trying to sign Bynum. They signed Ellington with the mid-level exception. o The Bucks might amnesty forward Drew Gooden’s $6.7 million contract. He spent four years with the Cavs."
