        "text": "General manager Tony DiLeo told the large media contingent on hand for what the Sixers had hoped would be Bynum’s first practice that Bynum is still experiencing discomfort in his right knee and won’t participate “in any basketball-related activities until he is pain-free.” It’s unclear when that will be.\n\n“I think pain and swelling are indications of what’s going on,” [Andrew] Bynum said. “I don’t feel pressure, but psychologically it stinks. It’s tough. I want to come in and help out.”\n\n“He is improving,” [general manager Tony] DiLeo said. “It’s nothing new. It’s just not completely healed. It’s our understanding that when this heals, it will be over.”\n\n“I have no idea,” [head coach Doug] Collins said. “It’s all hypothetical. We’re not going to look over at (Bynum as) a lifeline. If this team feels like we can’t win without him, we won’t win.”"
