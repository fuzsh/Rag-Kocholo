        "text": "CLEVELAND — Cavaliers centre Andrew Bynum has been excused from the team to address \"a family medical matter.\"\n\nThe Cavs said in a release on Tuesday that Bynum, who signed a two-year, free-agent deal with Cleveland this summer, is expected to rejoin the team on Saturday in Washington. The Cavs stayed in Chicago to practice after losing to the Bulls on Tuesday night.\n\nThe release said Bynum would travel to attend to the matter, but there were no other details.\n\nBynum will miss Wednesday’s game at Minnesota and a home game on Friday against Charlotte.\n\nThe 7-foot-1 Bynum made his first start of the season against Chicago and scored 11 points with six rebounds in 21 minutes.\n\nBynum missed all of last season with Philadelphia because of knee problems.\n\nLast week, the two-time All-Star with the Los Angeles Lakers said he has contemplated retirement, but believes he can still be a productive NBA player."
