        "text": "Andrew Bynum and Jason Richardson were formally introduced as the newest members of the 76ers Wednesday in Philadelphia, where Bynum was greeted by hundreds of fans chanting his name and said heâ€™s strongly considering staying in Philly beyond this season.\n\nThe Sixers organization did its best to make an event out of the introductions. Player intros are typically held in the bowels of the Wells Fargo Center and opened to credentialed reporters only, Philly.com notes. Wednesday's was held at the National Constitution Center and was free and open to the public. There was also a special section of seats reserved for season ticket holders.\n\n\"To be honest, my first experience here's been so great, I'm really leaning toward to making this my home,\" said Bynum, who was dealt from the Lakers to the Sixers in a four-team trade centered around Dwight Howard.\n\n\"It's the next step in my career,\" Bynum added, per Philly.com. \"It's a lot more exciting and a lot more fun knowing they are going to run (the offense) through you. Looking at the roster, we have a deep team. The sky is the limit.\"\n\nBynum said his first thought upon hearing that he was traded to Philadelphia was, \"I'm coming home.\" Bynum grew up outside of Princeton, N.J., but admitted he was a Chicago Bulls fan growing up.\n\nOver the summer, there was a report that suggested Bynum might be interested in signing with the Cavaliers when he became a free agent after the upcoming season.\n\nRichardson, who was moved from Orlando to Philly as part of the Howard trade, added, \"I'm excited about this team. Seeing them last year, what (coach) Doug (Collins) did with them. They're a young team with a lot of energy.\"\n\nBynum is coming off his best season as a pro, averaging career highs in minutes (35.2), points (18.7) and rebounds (11.8). His sometimes questionable behavior, and his balky knee, however, may be of some concern to Sixers fans."
