        "text": "The Cleveland Cavaliers met on Monday with the free-agent center Andrew Bynum, the oft-injured 7-footer who didn't play a single game for the Philadelphia 76ers last year because of a knee injury.\n\nThe 25-year-old, the most attractive center on the market now Dwight Howard has signed with Houston, met team officials at Cleveland Clinic Courts, the club's suburban facility, a person familiar with the visit told The Associated Press. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of negotiations. Yahoo! Sports reported that the Cavaliers had made a two-year offer to Bynum, according to league sources.\n\nCavs general manager Chris Grant is hoping to land a big man to play alongside All-Star guard Kyrie Irving, but the team wants to first make sure Bynum is healthy before offering him a deal. The Dallas Mavericks are also reportedly interested in Bynum after not getting Howard.\n\nWith more than $15m under the projected salary cap, the Cavs may be interested in offering Bynum a lucrative one-year deal. They may not want to tie up any money beyond next season, because they intend to be active in free agency next summer, when their will be several top-tier players available â€“ maybe even LeBron James, who can opt out of his contract with Miami after next season.\n\nBefore he was traded to the 76ers last summer, Bynum played for the Los Angeles Lakers under Cleveland coach Mike Brown. In his one season with Brown, Bynum had his best season, averaging 18.7 points and 11.8 rebounds. He was acquired by Philadelphia last year as part of a four-team trade, but he never got on the floor and the Sixers disintegrated. Bynum underwent arthroscopic surgery on both knees in March.\n\nLast month, his agent, David Lee, told the AP there's \"not a concern in the world\" that Bynum will be ready for training camp.\n\nIf the Cavs are able to sign Bynum, and assuming he's healthy, they would immediately move back into playoff contention in the Eastern Conference. Bynum would be added to a nucleus that includes Irving, Brazilian star Anderson Varejao, Tristan Thompson, Dion Waiters and Anthony Bennett, the No 1 overall pick in last month's NBA draft.\n\nIn other free agency moves, the Lakers have reached an agreement with 7ft center Chris Kaman, just days after Howard decided not to return to the team, opting to join the Rockets instead. The deal is reportedly for one year at $3.2m and it will be the 31-year-old's second straight season on a one-year contract. He had an $8m deal to be the starter in Dallas last season but averaged the fewest minutes of his career because he struggled on the defensive end in coach Rick Carlisle's system. Kaman scored 10.5 points per game but matched a career low with 5.6 rebounds and had his lowest average in blocks at 0.8.\n\nThe Denver Nuggets have also agreed to separate sign-and-trade deals that will land them the guard Randy Foye from the Utah Jazz and send Andre Iguodala to the Golden State Warriors, a person familiar with the decision said on condition of anonymity Monday. The Warriors had planned to sign Iguodala to a four-year, $48m deal as a free agent last week. Instead, the restructured deal will give Golden State more salary cap flexibility, deliver Denver a $9m trade exception and help Utah build for the future with expiring contracts and draft picks. Foye averaged 10.8 points and two assists while playing all 82 games for the Jazz last season.\n\nIn a separate move, the Warriors also reached an agreement with free agent Marreese Speights, who averaged 10.2 points and 5.1 rebounds in the final 39 games with Cleveland after being traded by Memphis last season. Terms of the deal weren't immediately known."
