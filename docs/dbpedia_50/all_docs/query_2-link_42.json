Just kidding, you can find nutritional information on their individual pages. If you’re interested in learning more nutritional information about our products, please feel free to reach back out or visit our website for more details.\n\nWe have many cheese sauces at Ricos. The following products do not contain ingredients from an animal source. They use rennet which is from a microbial or non-animal source:\n\nRicos Gourmet Nacho Cheddar Cheese Sauce\n\nThe Ricos cheese sauces produced in the 3.5oz cups\n\nRicos Queso Blanco\n\nThe Condensed Aged Cheddar Sauce is produced using lamb and pork-based rennet.\n\nLike the famous fairytale, we believe the perfect temperature isn’t too hot, isn’t too cold but the perfect in between. It’s all about finding the perfect warmth for you!\n\nGet more for your money is just what we had in mind when Ricos developed its most popular formula. The formula allows the addition of up to 52 oz. of water or jalapeño juice or a combination of both for additional yield.\n\nOnce a cheese container is opened, the product is exposed to its surroundings where various enzymes can break down the thickness or viscosity of the cheese-based sauce. Use of utensils that have come into contact with saliva (double dipping) or any other food may accelerate the loss of viscosity of the cheese sauce. Assure that the container is tightly sealed with the proper lid or covering.\n\nThank you for reaching out! Can you send us more information via DM or marketing@ricos.com?\n\nWe’ll direct this to the correct personnel. Appreciate it!\n\nWe’re so thankful that you would like to represent our brand! We love working with creators. We will keep you in mind for our future campaigns. Please follow The Nacho Squad! for more information. Thanks!\n\nThanks for reaching out! You don’t have to be a store owner to purchase our products in bulk, however, the only way to do so is by visiting our Cash and Carry, open Monday – Friday 8am to 5pm and 8am to 12pm on Saturdays. Stay cheesy!\n\nThe automatic pump is more effective as it efficiently extracts the cheese out of the bag, resulting in a lower waste ratio. The gravity machines rely on weight to push the cheese out of the bag, resulting in higher waste and longer dispensing times.\n\nQuality and customer satisfaction are very important to us! Can you please submit your concern here so we can work on a solution:\n\nPlease click on the PRODUCT FEEDBACK tab\n\nThank you for bringing this to our attention. Our plastic lids are used to prevent waste and can be recycled after they are done being used. However, we see your point and will send this to our internal products team. We appreciate it!"
