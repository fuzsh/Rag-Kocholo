The country houses a high number of endemic and globally threatened species of flora and fauna along with rich agrobiodiversity. About 21% total land of the country has been used for agriculture, a prime source for livelihood. Sustainable management of the biological resources has been closely linked with livelihood and economic well-being of the people in all aspects of life for food, health, nutrition, culture, climate and aesthetic values. However, the precious resources are being threatened by poverty, ecological fragility, environmental instability, inappropriate farming practices and unsustainable management of the natural resources. Nepal has signed several biodiversity related multilateral and bilateral treaties, agreements and conventions including Convention on Biological Diversity. The Government of Nepal has also formulated a number of national policies and acts for translating the obligations of the treaties, agreements and conventions. As a result of the commitments and management of the government, the protected areas in Nepal covers 23.39% and forest covers 44.74% of total area of Nepal. Currently, the conservation paradigm of the country has also been shifted from species conservation to landscape management. The landscape management of ecosystems are crucial for conserving biodiversity of the protected areas as well as beyond the protected areas at the ecosystem, species and genetic levels. Constitution of Nepal (2015) has adopted the federal democratic system. The constitution has also addressed the biodiversity related issues to be managed by the federal government, provincial governments and local levels. The conservation of biological resources is a major concern to Nepal. Therefore, the sustainable use and management of biological resources is crucial to promote the prosperity of people in Nepal. The government is keen on research and development with the proper and wise use of its biological resources. The Botanical Society of Nepal, the Nepal Biological Society, the Ministry of Forests and Environment, the Government of Nepal; and the Ministry of Industry, Tourism, Forest and Environment of Province No. 1 have jointly organized a two-day National Conference on âIntegrating Biological Resources for Prosperityâ in Biratnagar, Nepal on February 6-7, 2020. The conference theme was focused on the state of plant and animal diversity, wetlands and water, conservation and utilization of agriculture and forest resources, important medicinal and other non-timber forest products, biotechnology, climate change scenarios and its impacts, invasive species, environmental issues and so on. The conference was a big success with active participation of students, professors, free-lance scientists, biodiversity managers, government officials and policy makers. The conference was concluded with the announcement of âBiratnagar Declaration 2020â which is presented herewith in this book. We are grateful to all participants, organizers, collaborators and supporting organizations of the conference for making a very smoothly. We express our gratitude to Mr. Sherdhan Rai, Chief Minister of Province No. 1 for inaugurating the National Conference and Mr. Jagdish | iii |\n\nP:05\n\nPrasad Kusiyait, Minister for Industry, Tourism, Forest and Environment, Province No. 1 for chairing the inaugural session.

Conservation of plants and animals in their habitat is needed to ensure the supply of human needs for food, shelter, wellbeing including the ecosystem services. Fair and sustainable use of such biological resources should be only option so as to ensure their continuity for upcoming generations. Nepal is rich in biological resources, the conservation and sustainable utilization of resources is essential for the prosperity of the country. However, the biological resources are rapidly depleting due to habitat destruction, growing human population, overharvesting, invasion by alien species, unsustainable exploitation of resources, unmanaged tourism, pollution, infrastructure expansion, climate change, etc. To address the situation on biodiversity, the government of Nepal is implementing the obligations set by the conventions, formulating and implementing national and provincial legislation, awareness and readiness programmes and activities. The National Conference on Integrating Biological Resources for Prosperity organized at Biratnagar on February 6-7, 2020 is one of the campaigns to exchange scientific information and to promote awareness to the public, academic institutions and the government organizations. The organizers got the support from distinguished personalities and many government, academic, non-government and private organizations. We acknowledge our sincere thanks to all of them, specially to the organizing and advisory committees and subcommittees of the conference as well as executive committee and advisory committee members of the Botanical Society of Nepal and the Nepal Biological Society. We extend our special acknowledgements to the following organizations for their generous support, namely, the Department of Plant Resources, Kathmandu / Plant Research Center, Ilam; the Department of Environment, Kathmandu; USAIDâs Hariyo Ban Program, WWF Nepal, Kathmandu; REDD Implementation Center, Kathmandu; Biratnagar Metropolis, Morang; Nepal Academy of Science and Technology (NAST), Lalitpur; IUCN Nepal, Kathmandu; CODEFUND, Kathmandu; Post Graduate Campus, Biratnagar; Mahendra Morang Adarsha Multiple Campus, Biratnagar; Central Campus of Technology, Dharan; Mechi Multiple Campus, Bhadrapur; Purbanchal University, Biratnagar; Chamber of Industries, Morang; Morang Merchants Association, Biratnagar; HISSAN, Morang; and PABSON, Nepal.

Despite being rich in biodiversity and biological resources, Nepal remains economically one of the poorest countries in the world. Once a food exporting country, Nepal is now spending every year large amounts in importing agricultural and livestock products. In the last few years, the country has also started to import timber wood. The export of bio-products is not up to the national potential. Biodiversity and the ecosystem services they provide are remarkable; however, these need to be translated as resources for prosperity. Nepal has comparative advantages in biological resources, including hydropower, tourism, and cheap labor, and these sectors should be wisely addressed for prosperity. Key words: Agriculture, Biodiversity, Forest, Global rankings of Nepal, Natural capital, Plant genetic resources. Introduction There are nearly 200 countries in the world, all with diverse resources, culture, and prosperity. Based upon national gross domestic product, countries have generally been categorized as developed-developing and least developed. In 1990, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) started ranking countries based on their Human Development Index (HDI), which encompasses per capita gross national income, life expectancy at birth, and expected year of schooling. UNDP modified this indexing by adjusting the planetary pressure in the Human Development Index, now known as Planetary pressure adjusted Human Development Index (PHDI) (UNDP, 2020). An indexing (Legatum Prosperity Index) was also launched by the Legatum Institute of Prosperity in the United Kingdom in 2010. Legatum Prosperity Index includes 12 criteria basic for prosperity, which is useful in measuring transformation, and offers a unique insight into how prosperity is forming and changing across the world. The purpose of all these categorizations of countries is to reveal their status and performance in socio-economic and environmental sectors. Nepal, a land-locked country with a great range of topography within 200 km south and north distance, is unique and holds the 91st global position in land area with 30 million people. The country has been recently promoted to medium human development country at 142nd HDI position in 2020 from the low human development country. The country is endowed greatly with natural resources and different climatic zones. Despite that, not only is the country lagging behind in the developmental indices, but it is gradually moving downward in several indices. Here, a brief description and assessment of resources and Nepalâs potential for prosperity is presented. |1|\n\nP:11\n\nIntegrating Biological Resources for Prosperity, 2021 Jha, P.K. Natural Capital In the 20th century, the Himalayan kingdom was known for its natural beauty and cultural heritage. In the global context, Nepal holds the 50th position in population size, 4th in runoff basis water (42nd in inland freshwater), 50th in economically feasible hydropower, 25th in flowering plant biodiversity, 49th in overall biodiversity, and 29th in ecosystem services (Table 1). The Terai forest was regarded as the biggest and richest sanctuary of wildlife in South Asia. Nepal had a reputation as a food exporting country. International tourists used to visit the country to experience its nature and culture. After political change in 1950, Nepal started its journey towards modern development, and good progress was made. The first modern protected areas were established in 1973 as Sagarmatha National Park and Chitwan National Park. Both were declared natural world heritage sites by UNESCO in 1984. Ecosystem vitality and environmental performance were appreciable. One of the major components of natural capital on the earth is biological resources, in which Nepal has significant advantage. Biological Resources Biological resources refer to the living landscape âplants, animals, microbes â which are extremely important to people for the various services they provide. In the context of human beings, biological resources play major roles in the form of (i) genetic resources and scientific inputs, (ii) agriculture (cultivated plants, livestock, poultry, fishery, pests), and (iii) sensitive biological resources, natural goods and services (habitat, wildlife, pollinators, ornamentals, medicinal and industrial sources, scenic beauty, ecosystem services). Nepal is rich in biological resources. The country has77.6% land under green cover (40% forest, 4.6% shrub land, 21% agricultural cultivated land, and12% rangeland). In the global context, it stands in the 110th position in the world. In agricultural land, the country holds the136thposition (Table 1). TTaabble 1. Global ranking of Nepal in ecological indicators.

The faunal diversity recorded in Nepal includes3168 species of Platyhelminths (Gupta, 1997), 117 amphibians (ICIMOD & MoEST, 2007), 192 mollusks (Budha, 2015), 12,957 insects (Thapa, 2013), 230 fishes (Rajbanshi, 2012), 871 birds (Baral, 2013), 7 reptiles (Shah, 2013a), and 210 mammals (Shah, 2013b), totaling around 15,000 species. Plant Genetic Resources Nepal is rich in indigenous wild and landrace plant genetic resources of value for agronomic, horticultural, forestry, or medicinal uses. This diversity is largely a result of varied topography and climatic conditions. Unfortunately, a large number of local varieties and landraces of crops and livestock have been lost. The National Gene Bank has adopted four conservation strategies, viz., ex-situ, on-farm, in-situ, and breeding along with 60 different good practices. The National Gene Bank had more than 18,765 accessions of agricultural genetic resources in seed bank, tissue banks, and field (Joshi et al., 2020). Jha et al. (1996) have listed 485 species (genera for ornamental plants) in 14 categories (aromatic plants, cash crops, cereals, fibers, fodder, fruits, legume grains, medicines, oils, ornamentals, spices, timber, vegetables, wild relatives of food plants), and compared these to |3|\n\nP:13\n\nIntegrating Biological Resources for Prosperity, 2021 Jha, P.K. the germplasm collections in Nepal and USA to highlight collection and conservation needs. Many germplasms still need to be collected, characterized, and used for crop improvement; however, it will not be economically feasible to collect, increase, identify, maintain, characterize, and distribute all of the species in gene banks. Hence, habitat preservation is equally needed for protection of genetic resources. Nepalâs need for agricultural improvement has led to the development of a Plant Genetic Resources Program and many field stations of the National Agricultural Research Council, and the Department of Agriculture and Livestock has been established. These are located in the representative environments throughout the country and evaluate indigenous landraces and advanced cultivars. Unfortunately, little research has been done on the local agrobiodiversity. Agriculture Nepal is a predominantly agrarian country with about 66% of its population involved in agricultural occupation. The country has roughly 0.1 ha agriculture land per person, whereas global agricultural land availability is 0.21 ha per person. 28% of the biodiversity in Nepal are agricultural genetic resources (AGRs), generally termed as agrobiodiversity (Joshi et al., 2020). The agriculture sector, including forest and fisheries, contributes to around one-fourth of Nepalâs gross domestic product (GDP), and its share in national GDP is gradually decreasing. The contribution of agriculture and forestry sectors to GDP was estimated at 26.5% in the FY 2018/19 (MoF, 2019). Two decades back, the country used to export food to neighboring countries, but now its reputation as a food exporting country has vanished. The countryâs agricultural production heavily depends upon rainfall, which has become erratic due to climate change. Nepal produced 10.66 million tons of food grain in the year 2018-19 (380 kg per person per year (MoAL, 2020) and is 55th in the world in terms of crop production and 86th in cereal production. In the fiscal year 2019/20, Nepal spent Rs. 243 billion for importing food, which was an increase of Rs.19 billion compared to the previous fiscal year, and the spending on food imports has increased by around 62% in the last five years. Nepal is rich and important in agrobiodiversity due to its climatic and topographical diversity. Crop and livestock species have adapted well and evolved in harsh environmental conditions, including in the high mountains. However, its agrobiodiversity resources are not well documented and evaluated. It is a general fear that many landraces of crop species may disappear without their documentation. Although the Government of Nepal has given due importance to the agriculture sector by developing the 20-year Agricultural Development Strategy (2015-2035), its success depends upon various factors, including quality of governance. To be prosperous, Nepal must give serious attention to agriculture, not only for food sufficiency but for better livelihoods, employment opportunities, and earnings through export. Livestock The livestock sector contributes about 11.5% of the total GDP and 25.7% of the agricultural GDP (AGDP) (MoAL, 2020). In livestock production, Nepal holds the 28th position in the |4|\n\nP:14\n\nIntegrating Biological Resources for Prosperity, 2021 Jha, P.K. world. In 2017/18, there were 7.37 million cattle and 5.22 million buffalo in the country, and their annual growth rate in the last decade was 0.38 and 1.28% per year (MoAL, 2020). Nepal has made remarkable growth in the last two decades. The contribution of livestock and poultry sectors is not only the food and nutrition through meat, milk, and eggs, but also provides raw materials for industries, manure and draught power. Fisheries The contribution of the fishery sector to GDP was estimated at 0.5% in FY 2018/19 (MoF, 2019). Nepalâs fish production has increased from 24,295 tons in 2006/07 to 62,725 tons in 2018/19, i.e., 158%. In this 12-year period, fish yield increased 36% from 3,607 to 4,920 kg/ha. Subedi (2020) reported that 143,241 people are directly involved in aquaculture and 421,345 people are involved in capture fisheries in Nepal. Some ethnic groups such as Bhote, Darai, Majhi, Gurung, and Kunwar depend on fisheries for their livelihood. Floriculture Floriculture has emerged as a new business in Nepal. Cut flowers, bulbs, perennial flowers, ornamental plants, landscape and gardening, floral arrangements, and specific decorations are important business areas currently practiced under the floriculture sub-sector in the country. The country exported floricultural items Rs. 9.3 million worth, whereas imported NRs 418 million worth in 2018/19 (Malla, 2020). With floriculture emerging as an attractive commercial activity, Nepal has also entered in export of ornamentals in the international market though it is currently at a low scale. Vegetation and Forest The vegetation of Nepal exhibits a remarkable diversity as a result of great variation in elevation and climate. Hagen (1998) identified 12 major vegetation types, Stainton (1972) described 35 types of vegetation, and Dobremez (1976) with Nepalese colleagues initially identified 198 parcels of vegetation, then finalized all these in 118 categories, ultimately simplifying the vegetation to 36 types (TISC, 2002). Vegetation generally occurs up to 5000 m elevation; however, there are reports of species up to 6300 m in Himalaya. The forest statistics of Nepal can be confusing. According to Government of Nepal, the forest cover is 5.962 million ha, i.e., 40.36% of the total land area, and other wooded land has 0.648 million ha, totaling 44.74% of the national land (DoFRS, 2015). 15% of the forest occurs in protected areas, 40% of forest area managed by communities, including 34% area as community forest (DoFSC, 2019), and the remainder is managed through provincial governments. The UNDPâs publications show 25.4% forest area in the country in 2016, a 24.7% decrease between 1980 and 2016 (UNDP, 2020). Hence, the international ranking at 110th is based upon the data given by international organizations. Forest is the major dominant ecosystem on earth, covering 30.8% of the total land areas, i.e., 0.6 ha per person and 422 trees per person. Nepal encompasses 0.2 ha of forest areas per person and 111 trees per person, which is lower than the global average (MoF, 2019). Nepalâs forest on average has 430 trees/ha (DoFRS, 2015). Among south Asian countries, Bhutan has the |5|\n\nP:15\n\nIntegrating Biological Resources for Prosperity, 2021 Jha, P.K. highest forest area with 72.5% and Pakistan has the lowest with 1.9% forest area (MoF, 2019). Forests play an important role in the national economy of Nepal. FAO (2010) estimated that Nepalâs forestry sector contributed 3.5% to the GDP of the country in 2000 and 4.4% from 1990 to 2000. There are varying reports on the forest and biodiversity in Nepal. Ecosystem services of forests and biodiversity are known to everyone, but its services have not been quantified in terms of monetary value. Sensitive Biological Resources Sensitive biological resources are those species and biological communities that receive special consideration by the government and communities through plans, policies, regulations and scientific importance. Endemic, threatened, invasive, pollinator, and priority species fall under the category of sensitive biological resources. Endemic Plants and Animals: 312 species of endemic flowering plants (Rajbhandari et al., 2020), 8 species of pteridophytes, 31 species of bryophytes (Pradhan, 2020), 16 species of fungi, 3 species of algae, and 9 species of lichens have been reported from Nepal. There are 16 endemic fish species and 12 invasive alien fish species in Nepal (MoFSC, 2014). The list of the endemic animal species documented by MoFSC (2002) covers one species of mammal, two species of birds, 11 species of amphibians and reptiles, 30 species of butterflies and moths, and 108 species of spiders. This list needs to be updated. Threatened Plants andAnimals: There are nine plants, 55 mammals, 149 birds, 64 herpetofauna, and 21 fish included in the IUCN Red List, and15 species of plants, 52 mammals, 108 birds. 19 reptiles and three insects have been listed in the CITES Appendices. Similarly, the Nepal government has protected 41 faunal species (27 mammals, 8 birds, three reptiles and two amphibians), 18 floral species (14 angiosperms and four gymnosperms) and one plant group (lichens) (MoFSC, 2014). Realizing the endangerment of species due to trade, the country has imposed restrictions on the export of 17 plant species under the Forest Act 1993. Medicinal and Aromatic Plants: There are varied estimates of medicinal plants in Nepal â from 700 species to 1,792 species. Bhattarai and Ghimire (2006) estimated that 49% of the traded medicinal plants are herbs, 29% trees, 14% shrubs, and 8% climbers. Ghimire et al. (2018) analyzed the trade of medicinal and aromatic plants (MAP) of Nepal, and concluded that the export value of MAP products increased from US $ 27.49 million in 2005 to $ 60.09 million in 2014. Pyakurel et al. (2019) recorded 300 species in trade of medicinal plants of Nepal, most of these occurring in subtropical and lower temperate regions, indicating an economic potential for increased cultivation and domestication at middle mountains. There is a major trade of medicinal and aromatic plants in the world. Demand of herbal medicine is growing in developed countries. Himalayan herbs have a historical reputation and global recognition. Medicinal and aromatic plants (MAPs) of Nepal can offer good opportunities for sustainable economic growth. The country currently does not hold a significant share of global market for MAP, but has potential. Nepalâs export performance of MAPs and essential oils has been erratic, with volatile year-on-year trade flows. The number of manufacturers along the MAPs value chain registered as members of the Nepal Herbs |6|\n\nP:16\n\nIntegrating Biological Resources for Prosperity, 2021 Jha, P.K. and Herbal Products Association (NEHHPA) grew from 20 in 2012 to 85 in early 2018. Nepali firms have had some success in diversifying export markets in recent years, but India remains by far the most important trade partner and destination in the MAPs value chain (WB, 2018). Trade data indicate that Nepali products need consistency and quality control. Pollinators: Around 350,000 animal species act as pollinators and 90% of the wild flowering plant species depend on animal pollinators (IPBES, 2016). Over 20,000 flowering plants depend on insect pollination and over 30,000 species of insects are effective pollinators including bees, beetles, moths, flies, wasps and butterflies (Thapa, 2013). About 100 crop species provide 90% of food, of which 71 species are bee pollinated and several others by many other insects (Thapa, 2013). In any ecosystem, insects are important elements as plant feeders, predators, decomposers, pollinators, vectors of diseases, forensic entomology and biocontrol agents. Insect pollination is worth mentioning of its ecosystem service. Biocontrol Agents: There are a few alien insects and fungi acting as biocontrol agents on invasive plants (the Mexican beetle Zygogramma bicolorata and winter rust Puccinia abrupta var. parthenicola on Parthenium hysterophorus; stem gall fly Procecidochaeres utilis and a fungus Passalora ageratinae on Ageratina adenophora). Nepal Agricultural Research Council has imported the two weevils Neochetina eichornae and N. bruchi Hustache from the USA for biological control of water hyacinth in Phewa and Begnas lakes in Pokhara valley (Anonymous, 2015). Biological Invasion Biological invasion has emerged as one of the serious challenges for biological resources of Nepal. The recent pandemic of COVID 19 is an example of biological invasion disrupting the global economy and impacting billions of lives. There are at least a dozen agricultural pests and pathogens that are alien invasive to Nepal. Recent invasion of Tuta absoluta on tomato crop and fall army worm (Spodoptera frugiperda) on maize crop are some of the worst examples of invasion. Invasive plants and animals threaten natural vegetation, agroecosystems, and aquatic ecosystems seriously. Paini et al. (2016) have identified that Nepal's agriculture is the third most threatened country in the world due to biological invasion. The impacts of invasive alien plant species are on plant species composition, interference in tree seedling regeneration, habitat degradation, and health and livelihoods. There are 179 species of naturalized alien plant species in Nepal (Shrestha, 2019), and among these, 27species are invasive (Adhikari et al., 2021). Among them, four species (Mikania micrantha, Chromolaena odorata, Lantana camara and Eichhornia crassipes) are in the list of 100 of the worldâs worst invasive alien plant species (Lowe et al., 2000). Budha (2015) listed 64 species of alien fauna in Nepal, 7 species of mammals, 6 species of birds, 22 species of arthropods, 9 species of mollusks and one species of platyhelminths. Among these, 10 species are listed in 100 of the worldâs invasive alien faunal species. Prosperity Prosperity is generally defined as flourishing, thriving good fortune. Nepal is considered a poor country in the world, but an ecologically prosperous country, rich in natural capital. |7|\n\nP:17\n\nSInitmegorantinKguBzionloegticianl R1e9so5u0rsceas dfovraPnrocsepderiaty,h2y02p1othesis known as environmental kuznetJhcau,rPv.Ke. resiiMntetnsaflovatrjdiiatonriseoogutrrnnnrunmscdtheheteiyuapnvrttetew,olobtiwshtpueheamtcrttahdoefenesrtcseteoersannctanvaoodricmnrteeoomirdncmtaamiiinrcndketenelhgvetter.veoaHlecwolciptmoehmsfa.seelTanciyntohanetnoirhnemkeitiiiincscaoglgpludyronoostmwrilyteita;ahvfdn,etesoargns1retoo9otchw5ie0etalht,eyasindsbn,deettgetehhidreneiuroseccrtaoaoattuiirinooemtnnrip,ysrshiosunteveaaesrltttiheohtdesf, TNehnyhevprpieoaretolhinÂeym.seiNasernkestnpaoabllwadchnekoga,lrsdaGesdnoa1vtv1iieor4rontnhnmampnoeednsnitbttaiioolonfkduiiNvznener2epst0aitc2lyu0grl,voasevsh,seos. twIaantiinsnthlggoegtah1aajn9ut:5me0cÂpsoP,nriSonoimsmtphieocerndoleauKvssutezlNfonivpeeepmtaaeyldnevt-aairnsHnictfaierpaodlpmlyya 1le2a8dtsh topoasditeitoenrioirnatiotnhein LtheegeantuvmironPmroesnpt,ebriutyt afItnedr eaxcer(tLaPinI)l.evDeleofifneitceolnyo, mdicatgarorwetvhe,aal ismocpireotyvebmegeinnts itno iLmPpIr,otvheeitssarmeleatitoimnsehidpewgriathdathtieonenivnironnamtueranlt. environment and loss of nTahtruerealyceaapristaalgaor,e tehveidGenotv. eSrtnamndeanrtdooff Nlievpinagl hgaasveinacreslaosgeadnw: hâePrreoasspqeruoaulistyNoefplaivl-iHngaphpays bNeeepnalcih.âalNleenpgaeldh.oTldhse tphreo1sp1e4rthitpyosshitoiounldinbe2a0c2h0i,esvheodwkienegpainjguminpminintdhethleasqt ufiavlietyyeoafrlsivfrionmg.

Challenges There are several challenges in the journey from poverty to prosperity. The most serious challenges for a developing democratic country like Nepal are ethical governance, proper implementation of plans and policies, and wise use of resources without compromising the environment. Climate change and increasing biological invasions threaten natural resources and slow down the growth. Strong political will is necessary to overcome these challenges. Indicators to achieve or improve are given in tables 1 and 2. Conclusion Prosperity comes from productivity, wise use of resources, application of science and technology, innovative ideas, investment in research, and good governance. Nepal has all the essential ingredients needed for prosperity. The agriculture sector has great potential for national development as it not only meets the basic needs, but also provides employment, income, and a balanced ecosystem. The country jumped from an agricultural to a service economy at lower level of per capita GDP, by passing growth in the industrial sector. The Human Development Report of Nepal 2020 emphasizes that the agriculture, manufacturing, energy, and tourism sectors are the most prominent sectors for economic development of Nepal (GoN, 2020). The forest sector has excellent potential of ecological as well as economic prosperity. Biologists should involve themselves in innovative research, leading to the sustainable use of biological resources and value addition to biological products. The government should have commitment and fixed targets to achieve. The ecotourism sector is the strength of the country but not well managed. A country cannot develop without availability of cheap energy. Despite having enormous economically feasible hydropower, the energy is expensive. The most important biological resource is human resource. Nepal has achieved remarkable progress in human resources. There are experts in most of the fields related to modern development and prosperity. The country must properly exploit its precious biological resources, including the human resources, for optimized prosperity.

Importance of the knowledge of indigenous names has been well- recognized by ethnobiologists for the success of initiatives related to the recovery and restoration of endangered species. Evidently, studies have demonstrated that efforts to conserve biodiversity can greatly benefit from engaging with local communities, anthropologists and linguists. While local communities and anthropologists can share their unique traditional ecological knowledge, linguists can serve as bridges between traditional knowledge and eco-science. It is well considered that safeguarding of traditional knowledge and the indigenous languages are promising tools for the conservation and sustainable management of biodiversity. Conservation biologists have realized the importance of focused research exploring the relationship between biological, linguistic and cultural diversity for developing integrated strategies designed to conserve species, culture and languages. Key words: Biodiversity, Conservation strategies, Culture and language diversity Introduction Climate change, deforestation and habitat loss, overexploitation of nature and natural resources, introduction of and invasion by alien species into ecosystem and increased pollution are considered widely as main threats to biodiversity. Lots of money has been spent and many efforts have been made to conserve biodiversity throughout the globe. Yet attempts to control the increased loss of biodiversity are still beyond success. Studying on the linkage between biodiversity conservation and conservation of local languages Gorenflo et al. (2012) found that the less biologically diverse regions in the world have less linguistically and culturally diverse as well. Biologists estimate annual loss of species at 1,000 times or greater than historic rates, and linguists predict that 50-90% of the worldâs languages will disappear by the end of this century. Using greatly improved datasets to explore the co-occurrence of linguistic and biological diversity in regions containing many of the Earthâs remaining species: biodiversity hotspots and high biodiversity wilderness areas, the authors indicate that these regions often contain considerable linguistic diversity, accounting for 70% of all languages on Earth. They observed that the languages involved are frequently unique (endemic) to particular regions, with many facing extinction.

The geographic boundaries of the HBWAâs coincide with the boundaries of several amalgamated (WWF, 2012). Biodiversity hotspots, on the other hand, are biogeographic region that is both significant reservoir of biodiversity and is threatened with destruction. The term biodiversity hotspots specifically refer to 25 biologically rich areas around the world that have lost at least 70% of the original habitat. | 14 |\n\nP:24\n\nIntegrating Biological Resources for Prosperity, 2021 Joshi, K.K. Co-occurrence of linguistic and biological diversity in biodiversity hotspots (BH) Gorenflo et al. (2012) reported the co-occurrence of linguistic and biological diversity in biodiversity hotspots (BH) and HBWA areas. A biodiversity hotspot is widely known as a biogeographic region that is considered as a significant reservoir of biodiversity and, however, is threatened of destruction. The term biodiversity hotspots specifically refer to 25 biologically rich areas around the world that have lost at least 70% of their habitat. The authors infer that as the world grows less biologically diverse, it is becoming less linguistically and culturally diverse. Referring to the biologistsâ estimate of annual loss of species, they noted that it was 1,000 times or greater than historic rates, and greater than linguistsâ prediction of disappearing 50-90% of the world languages by the end of century. Results of the studies on co- occurrence of linguistic and biological diversity in regions containing many of the Earthâs remaining species: biodiversity hotspots and HBWA indicate that these regions often contain considerable linguistic diversity accounting for 70% of all languages on Earth. Reasons for co-occurrence of linguistic and biological diversity are complex and appear to vary among localities, although strong geographic concordance between biological and linguistic diversity in many areas argues for some form of functional connection. Harmon (2014) gave reasons for the belief that our planet, the Earth is said to be âaliveâ as the existence of a profuse variety of organisms, divergent streams of human thought and behavior and geophysical features that provide a congenial setting for the workings of nature and culture. All three realms of difference have evolved so that they interact with and influence one another. Earthâs interwoven variety - what is called biocultural diversity â is nothing less than the pre-eminent fact of existence. Anonymous (2010) in a report of the conference on biological diversity for development states that from genes, species, ecosystems, landscapes and seascapes, to languages, practices, traditions, artistic expressions and belief, value and knowledge systems, these diversities are facing unprecedented changes, and most importantly loss. The impact of reduction in bio-cultural diversity on the resilience of the planetary systems is profound. In the current global change context, the loss of biological diversity, with the simultaneous loss of languages knowledge systems and specific ways of life, has resulted in new challenges for coupled social-ecological systems. The report further states that in order to address those challenges mentioned above it is critical that the links between biological and cultural diversities - encompassing, inter alia, languages as repositories of knowledge and practices, tangible and intangible heritage related to nature, modes of subsistence, economic and social relations and belief systems â taken into consideration in policy development at all scales. Global studies revealed that there was significant role of different cultures of the world such as Buddhism culture in China, Sacred grove culture in India on conservation and protection of biodiversity. Similar findings of the study were obtained from Samahni area, where Gujar and Jat tribes implemented their traditional cultural customs not only to their daily life but also on conservation of biodiversity in their vicinity region (Ishtiaq et al., 2012). Kollmair and Turin (2007) urged that mountains particularly the Himalayas are not only centers of extraordinary biodiversity; they are also cultural and linguistic hotspots. Of the | 15 |\n\nP:25\n\nIntegrating Biological Resources for Prosperity, 2021 Joshi, K.K. approximately 600 languages found in the Himalayas, over 400 are spoken by groups of less than 100,000 people, and most of these are in danger of extinction. Analogous to the threat of species extinction, the extinction of languages should be regarded as an unrecoverable loss of diversity for all of humankind. Inference Shrestha (1999) presented a picture of biocultural diversity of Nepal describing the Himalayan country as one of the key hotspots of both biodiversity and cultural and linguistic diversities in South Asia. Nepal links six floristic provinces of Asia and two major world realms, the palearctic and the oriental. The country covers only 0.1% of the worldâs land but claims 8.5% of its bird species, 4.2% of butterflies, 2.2% of freshwater fishes, and houses 2.2% of the worldâs flowering plants. Nepal is equally rich in its cultural diversity as well with people in Mongolian characters in the Himalayan region, Mongolian and Aryan mixed in the mid hills and Aryan in lowlands, Tibetans dwelling in the highlands, Gorkhalis and wide range of other ethnic groups living in the mid hills, and tharus and others in the lowlands Most of these ethnic groups of people in Nepal have their own languages and cultures. Among all important communities of different parts of Nepal, Ayurvedic medicines, Trans-Himalayan Tibetan medicines practiced by local practitioners known as Amchis, and other ethno-medicines practiced by different local communities of Nepal are worth mentioning here. Knowledge of ethno-cultural aspect of the use of different plants and animals for different purposes and in different occasions and festivals by local communities along with information of their habitat is passed to the next generation through local languages and practices. Once the language is extinct inheritance of culture and knowledge becomes stranded. Once culture is forgotten, all those plants and animals which are used in different occasions and the knowledge of their existence in local vegetation including those of forests will also be forgotten. Recent studies made by environmentalists, biologists, anthropologists and related experts of the world suggest that without successful conservation of local languages and culture successful conservation of biodiversity will remain limited as a mere slogan.

Recent urbanization and other development activities have been found to be responsible for careless and imprudent encroachment of natural habitat. Plant sciences today have to face challenges from global issues including climate change, global warming and increasing requirement of food, shelter, health, fodder, energy and so on for growing population. Education that cannot combat such challenges and solve the problems of society will certainly loose its values. People are now aware of responsibilities of educational institutions towards societies on which they subsist. In order to meet local and global needs of our education of plant sciences, it must be able to keep pace with social needs, global change and technology development. Time has come or rather late to look back on our curriculum of plant sciences in higher education and update it giving much attention to needs of the societies. Key words: Plant science education, social needs, global change, curriculum. Introduction âKnowing is not enough, we must apply Willing is not enough, we must do.â â Johann Wolfgang Von Goethe. Technology is used or scientific knowledge is applied for specific goals or purposes in the society. Science, technology and society are interlinked with each other with their contributions and benefits. Science seeks to improve society and informs technology; while technology demands more science for its further development. Technology contributes to the society by making life of people in society easier. Society on the other hand, demands more and more from science and is benefited from technology. American Society of Plant Biology (ASPB) put forward 12 principles of plant biology related to education transformation. The topic Transforming Education in Plant Biology is well studied to faculties who are planning to build courses or curricula in order to incorporate evidence-based methods of teaching and learning. Based on the principles courses are suggested for middle schools on 12 different topics. They are given in different titles viz., sugar makers (biological process and photosynthesis); biodiversity big and small (diversity and 350,000 species; feed your veggies (inorganic elements and biosphere); a rainbow of uses (fibers medicines and other important products); seeds of change (evolution, oxygen and ozone); mean and green (defense from pests, injury and illness); sex, bugs and pollenâs role (flowers and seeds: asexual propagation); plant plumbing (water circulation, growth and structure); plants respire too (respiration and energy); which way to grow; green ecology | 18 |\n\nP:28\n\nIntegrating Biological Resources for Prosperity, 2021 Joshi, S.D. (hormones and external signals); and thanks for the support (cell walls and building materials). Lab works based on these 12 topics have also been well designed. International Association of Universities also showed its deep concern on transformation education and organized an International Conference on Transforming Higher Education for the Future. The conference was held in Puebla, Mexico in 13-15 November, 2019. For further information concerning the conference may visit: www.iau-aiu.net or contact IAU SecretariatÂ - UNESCO House â 1, rue Miollis, F-75732 Paris Cedex 15, France Tel: +33 (0)1 45 68 48 06.Â Effective learning on any topics of sciences or all other disciplines may need some systematic method of learning and develop capacity of applying for the benefit of the society. The learner must also develop ability of creating new knowledge. Benjamin Bloom suggested a classification of educational objectives and developed a theory of mastery learning, today well known as Bloomâs Taxonomy (Fig. 1). Create Evaluate Analyze Apply Understand Remember Figure 1. Bloomâs Taxonomy (Remember- recall facts and basic concepts, Understand- explain ideas or concepts, Apply- use information in new situation, Analyze- draw connection among ideas, Evaluate- justify a stand or decision, Create- produce new or original works) Dragomir and Panzaru (2015) highlighted the main connections between education and development entrepreneurship, understanding the significant aspects related to Romania and EU member states. Al-Zubeidi (2005) showed the importance of relationship between college educational background and all business successes in Texas. The author found that the often-argued relationship between college education in general, and education in business in specific, and small business success continues to be critical and evidently realized the importance of such relationship in the continuing need for learning to cope with rapid technological advances, competition, and the changing global economy. Eilks (2014) discussed the insights into some theoretical foundations of the UN Decade of Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) by presenting different models of implementing ESD in teaching of science and technology and illustrating by various case studies. The paper suggests that thoroughly combining the ESD framework with science teaching that follows a socio-scientific issues-based approach to education has great potential for helping students develop many general educational skills. Lippman in Mallick (2017) states that one of the most severe limitations of nature is that it has not provided enough | 19 |\n\nP:29\n\nIntegrating Biological Resources for Prosperity, 2021 Joshi, S.D. genetic variation for breeders to work with, especiallyÂ for the major yield traits that can involve dozens of genes. Mallick (2017) opined that the sense of security that farmers feel when they have advanced tools to protect and improve their harvests while protecting natural resources, benefits the whole family and ultimately the entire communities. To achieve sustainable development goals of UN to eradicate poverty, provide food security and improved nutrition, more such researches are needed to develop GM crops for disease resistance, drought resistance, and for other agronomic traits (Fig. 2). Sustainable Development Bio- Entrepreneurship Education on Plant Biology and Allied subjects Figure 2. Relationship between education, entrepreneurship and sustainable development. Most of the universities in our South Asian region do not revise and introduce new knowledge in their syllabi in time as per industries and other userâ requirement, mostly because senior faculties are reluctant to update and enable themselves for teaching and undertaking research works in the fields they never learnt before. Grant is very right to say that the mark of higher education is not the knowledge we accumulate in our head. It is the skills we gain about how to learn. Research, an Integral Part of Education for Development Research produces knowledge. It also helps in confirming previous knowledge and finding truth in our beliefs. It is important in achieving success in competitive local and global markets. It also helps in combating existing and forthcoming health problems of all lives successfully and building society stronger, happier and compassionate. Research is considered crucial for quality higher education throughout the globe. Research receives great importance in universities and institutions delivering higher education both as degree-oriented viz., undergraduate, graduate, doctoral and post-doctoral programs and non-degree-oriented programs. For achieving a better position in world-class university ranking also research is considered one of the most important criteria both in its quality and quantity. In universities and higher education institutions of Nepal budget allocation for academic research is too poor. Yet, faculties by their own efforts are able to receive small or moderately bigger supports from national and foreign donors. More efforts are expected to increase research budgets of Central and State Governments for different universities, academic and research institutions. | 20 |\n\nP:30\n\nIntegrating Biological Resources for Prosperity, 2021 Joshi, S.D. Distribution of Human Resources in Botany The history of science teaching is not very old in Nepal. It was introduced in Tri Chandra College in 1945. So far, the products of seven decades of Nepal universities and colleges absorbed in government organizations (viz., Department of Plant Resources, Nepal Agriculture Research Centre, Food Research Lab, Drug Research Lab and different ministries and departments, etc.), teaching institutions (viz., TU campuses, community campuses, private campuses, different community and private schools) and non-government organizations (viz., ICIMOD, IUCN, WWF, ANSAB, nurseries, herbal farms and herbal medical companies). Many graduates have left country and sought opportunities mostly in USA, Australia, New Zealand, UK, and different countries of Europe and Asia for further studies and jobs. Promotion of Job Opportunities Job opportunity for plant science graduates in Nepal is too limited. Self-employment among them is extremely low. It is partly because of their incapability in investing for small or medium entrepreneurial ventures and partly because of limitations in courses of studies. Revision of courses of studies is highly recommended here. Curricula are to be revised giving emphasis on following requirements: â¢ keep pace with global trends â¢ fulfill social demands â¢ enable to develop entrepreneurship â¢ encourage consultancy services to relevant professionals â¢ enable graduates in solving related problems such as: o improvement of plants o prevention from and care of diseases and different stresses o increase in quality and productivity o imparting knowledge of modern technologies o introduction of internship at all levels of higher education â¢ involve job providers in curricula development and revision and â¢ interactions with all stakeholders for making curricula updated all the time. Evidently, in recent years, students are attracted more in applied subjects of plant sciences. In Central Department of Botany of Tribhuvan University, special and applied subjects (in addition to general subjects) are offered to students. M.Sc. in Biodiversity and Environment Management is also a new addition as a separate self-sustaining subject. Students are found willing to pay the required amount for its cost recovery. For all other subjectsâ tuition fee is comparatively very low. Studentsâ choice and job opportunities suggests faculties to think further on giving priority to subjects of studentsâ interests linked mostly with more job opportunities.

The recently updated list shows that Nepal has 293 endemic flowering plant species to date. Among 289 species of endemic flowering plants analyzed, Central Nepal has 181 species, the highest number of species than in the west (60 species) and east (49 species) Nepal. Endemic flowering plants are found in 39 districts of Nepal. Mustang district (34 species) has the highest number of endemic flowering plants. Thirty-two herbaria in Nepal and abroad preserve the herbarium specimens of Nepalese endemic flowering plants. Among them, Natural History Museum (BM, London), Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh (E, Edinburgh), University of Tokyo (TI, Tokyo) and National Herbarium of Nepal (KATH, Lalitpur) have more than 50 type specimens of the Nepalese endemic flowering plants. Several herbaria have one type of specimen only. The data can help to do further research, develop the planning/policy, and know the important plant areas (IPA) for the conservation of the endemic plants in Nepal. Districts with high diversity of endemic flowering plants such as Mustang, Dolpa, Rasuwa, Kaski, Gorkha, Sankhuwasabha, Jumla, Manang and Taplejung should be given importance for conservation and for further study to analyze them. Key words: Flora of Nepal, Important Plant Areas, National Herbarium of Nepal, Plant Systematics, Vegetation zones Introduction Endemic flowering plants of Nepal are those plants whose distributions are confined to Nepal. If the plant is found outside Nepal, then it is not endemic to Nepal. In the broader sense, any endemic taxonomic unitâs distribution is confined to a particular country or geographical region (Good, 1974). Isolation of geographical areas, such as high mountains and islands, plays a vital role in forming endemic plants. These areas have shown greater endemism in general. Importance of the endemic plants lies in the fact that if it is lost from a particular country or region, it will be lost from the world. Therefore, utmost importance has to be given to the conservation of these plants. Recently, some papers on the endemic flowering plants of Nepal have appeared with their lists. However, they have not been analyzed from the distribution point of view. With the help of the published literature, we revised the list of Nepalâs endemic flowering plants, updating them wherever necessary and worked out their distribution in different climatic and vegetation zones of Nepal and different districts | 23 |\n\nP:33\n\nIntegrating Biological Resources for Prosperity, 2021 Rajbhandari, K.R. et al. of Nepal to see their diversity and distribution pattern. A single type specimen sometimes represents endemic flowering plant species of Nepal. Therefore, we also checked the national and international herbaria where these specimens are preserved to see in how many herbaria Nepalese endemic flowering plant specimens are available. The data can help in further research and develop the planning/policy of the conservation of Nepalâs endemic plants. The information on the flowering plants of Nepal was provided by Hara and Williams (1979) and Hara et al. (1978, 1982) in their books âAn enumeration of the flowering plants of Nepal volumes 1-3âwhich later became a source for preparing the list of the endemic flowering plants of Nepal (Rajbhandari et al., 2016). Based on these books, Shrestha et al. (1986) reported 242 species of endemic flowering plants of Nepal. Joshi and Joshi (1991) provided a list of 283 endemic flowering plants of Nepal. Shrestha and Joshi (1996) reported 246 species of endemic flowering plants of Nepal. Chaudhary (1998) has given a list of endemic flowering plants of Nepal. Ghimire (2005) reported endemic flowering plants of Dolpo (northwest Nepal) area. Bhuju et al. (2007) in âNepal biodiversity resource book: Protected areas, Ramsar sites and world heritage sitesâ have included as an Annex 1.5 a list of the endemic flowering plants and have recorded 316 species out of total 399 taxa (species, subspecies, variety). Rajbhandari and Adhikari (2009) and Rajbhandari and Dhungana (2010, 2011a) have given descriptions of 282 species of endemic flowering plants of Nepal. Rajbhandari and Dhungana (2011b) and Rajbhandari (2013) analysed the diversity of Nepalese endemic flowering plants and noted that the families having a large number of endemic species were Asteraceae, Saxifragaceae, Papaveraceae and Ranunculaceae and the genera having a large number of endemic plants were Saxifraga, Pedicularis, Meconopsis and Impatiens. Miehe et al. (2015) have followed Bhuju et al. (2007) and noted that 399 endemic flowering plants of Nepal are unevenly distributed. Rajbhandari et al. (2015) reported 81 type specimens preserved in Nepalâs National Herbarium (KATH), which included 45 endemic flowering plants of Nepal. The previous lists of the endemic flowering plants were revised by Rajbhandari et al. and reported 324 species in 2016 and 312 in 2017. Tiwari et al. (2019) also gave a list of 312 species of endemic flowering plants of Nepal and analysed their phytogeographical implications. In the book âFlowering plants discovered from Nepalâ published in 2019, Rajbhandari et al. compiled information about the new flowering plants discovered from Nepal, including endemic plants and clarifying their whereabouts type specimens. This paper aims to present the status and distribution of Nepalâs endemic flowering plants by revising their existing lists and updating them based on the published literature and the examination of the type specimens in the National Herbarium of Nepal. Results Diversity of Endemic Flowering Plants of Nepal The recent updated list showed that there are 293 endemic flowering plant species in Nepal belonging to 129 genera and 45 families (Tables 1, 11). This is about 5% of the total flowering plant species of Nepal. Previously in 2017, we had shown that there were 312 species of | 24 |\n\nP:34\n\nIntegrating Biological Resources for Prosperity, 2021 Rajbhandari, K.R. et al. endemic flowering plants in Nepal. The reduction from 312 to 293 is due to recent taxonomic studies by various experts. Some species have been reported from neighbouring countries, and some species have become synonyms of the species having distribution outside Nepal. A few new species have been recently added to the flora of Nepal thus adding to the endemic list of the flowering plants. Twelve families have ten or more than ten species of endemic flowering plants (Table 2). Among them, the families having a large number of endemic species are Apiaceae (29 species), Saxifragaceae (20 species), Fabaceae (19 species), Orchidaceae (19 species), Asteraceae (18 species) and Papaveraceae (17 species). Fourteen genera have five or more than five species of endemic flowering plant species (Table 3). Genera having a large number of endemic species are Saxifraga (20 species), Pedicularis (15 species) and Corydalis (9 species). Aconitum, Acronema, Astragalus, and Papaver each have 8 species. They are all much diversified high altitude plants (Rajbhandari et al., 2017). Table 1. Diversity of endemic flowering plants of Nepal.

Endemic flowering plants in different districts of Nepal Endemic flowering plants are found in 39 districts of Nepal. Mustang district (34 species) has the highest number of endemic flowering plants (Tables 6, 7, 8). Other districts having more than 10 endemic flowering plants of Nepal are Dolpa (26 species), Rasuwa (24 species), Kaski (21 species), Gorkha (18 species), Sankhuwasabha (17 species), Jumla (14 species), | 226 |\n\nP:36\n\nIntegrating Biological Resources for Prosperity, 2021 Rajbhandari, K.R. et al. Manang (13 species), and Taplejung (11 species). One species of endemic flowering plant is found in nine districts of Nepal. Gandaki Province (with 102 species) has the highest number of endemic flowering plants of Nepal. Similarly, Bagmati Province has 66 species, Karnali Province has 60 species, Province 1 (east Nepal) has 44 species, Lumbini Province has 9 species and Far-western Province has 8 species (Table 5).
