To ensure the integrity of your accounts, we use various methods to confirm your identity whenever you visit a TD Bank location.\n\nWith a TD VisaÂ® Debit Card and PIN\n\nThis is the same verification method used when buying something at the market. When you arrive in our lobby, the teller will ask you to insert your TD Bank chip-enabled debit card into the PIN pad and enter your PIN. Once your identity is confirmed, your transaction can begin. Verifying your identity supports our efforts to process your banking request accurately.\n\nIf you don't have your debit card with you, we can still verify your identity using your PIN. The teller will ask for a valid form of identification in place of your debit card, then prompt you to enter your PIN into the pin pad.\n\nWith a smartphone and PIN\n\nDrive-thru banking uses a similar PIN-based method for verification. After providing the teller with a valid form of identification, you will receive an SMS text message on your smartphone. You will then be prompted to enter your debit card PIN. Once your identity is confirmed, your transaction can begin.\n\nWith physical identification\n\nIn instances where you don't have a debit card or smartphone, you will be asked to provide one or more forms of valid physical identification. You may also be asked to confirm personal information or account details. These steps are taken to ensure your protection.\n\nWith a single-use security code\n\nIn some instances, we may ask for additional verification using a single-use security code. This code is a unique number we generate and send to your smartphone via SMS text or voice. Use of security codes is a common method of identity verification, providing enhanced protection of your personal information."
