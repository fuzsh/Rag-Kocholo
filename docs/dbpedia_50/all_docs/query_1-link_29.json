        "text": "s: This study mainly sheds light on the ethnomedicinal uses of plants present in and around home gardens in the western mid-hills of Nepal. The study was conducted in Sandhikharka municipality, Arghakhanchi district during June-July 2020. The primary data was obtained through, semi-structured questionnaire survey, discussion with key informants (n=41) and field visit. The data then was quantitatively analyzed using 3 ethnobotanical indices viz. Informant consensus factor (Fic), Use frequency (UF) and Use value (UV). A total of 52 plant species with ethnomedicinal importance belonging to 32 families and 48 genera were recorded. Out of which Astereceae and Lamiaceae were the dominant families followed by Amaranthaceae, Poaceae and Rosaceae with the whole plant being the most frequently (15 species) used parts. A total of 23 species were used to treat different types of gastrointestinal ailments. Oral route was found to be desirable route of administration (43 species, 82.69%) followed by topical (23 species, 44.23%) and inhalation (1 species, 1.92%). Most informants agreed upon use of reported species with an average Fic value of 0.79 where Ocimum tenuiflorum was found to be the most frequently used species with UF= 0.79 and UV= 1.63. This study revealed that local people were mostly familiar with common ailments mainly cough, common cold, fever, skin infections etc and used these reported species to treat those ailments. As this study area harbors high diversity of medicinal plants, and older individuals possessed relatively higher ethnobotanical knowledge than the younger age class. Hence, the emphasis should be given for the documentation of this knowledge and transferring them to the younger generation before they are lost or disappeared. Also, there is need for conservation of valuable medicinal plant species.\n\nNepal harbors many ethnomedicinal plants distributed throughout the country’s diverse geography. It is crucial to document plants’ ethnobotanical knowledge for further research and conservation. This study aimed to conduct a quantitative ethnobotanical analysis of the medicinal plants used in the Varagung Muktichhetra Rural Municipality of Mustang District, Nepal. Data were collected through a household survey (N = 101), using snowball sampling with 40% sampling intensity, 12 Key Informant Interviews (KIIs), and two Focus Group Discussions (FGDs). The data was analyzed using different quantitative tools: Informant consensus factor (Fic), Fidelity Level (FL), and Use Values (UV). A total of 54 medicinal plants belonging to 32 families were documented, which were used to treat 40 different ailments. The family Asteraceae represented the maximum number of plants being used. Herbs were most frequently used (59%), and root (n =10) was the most used plant part. Neopicrorhiza scrophulariiflora was the most frequently used and preferred species (FL = 65% and UV = 0.62). Fever (Fic = 0.88) and gastrointestinal disorder (Fic = 0.86) were the major ailment categories treated. Oral (76%) was the main route of administration of medicines in the body, and the most used form of medicine preparation was paste (46%). Unsustainable harvesting, illegal collection, and forest fire were the major threats to medicinal plants and were highly significant after applying the non-parametric Friedman test. Enactment of a policy that focuses on conservation, sustainable harvesting, and domestication of highly valued medicinal plants is recommended to policymakers.\n\nThis paper quantifies the volume and value of medicinal and aromatic plants (MAPs) traded from Baitadi district in western Nepal. Information related to trade, in the Fiscal Year 2014/015, was collected through pre-tested structured questionnaire. Harvesters (n = 24) and the entire population of sub-local (n = 35) and local (n = 7) traders were interviewed to quantify the value and volume of MAP trade from the district. Results showed that 15.2% households were engaged in harvesting of MAPs for trade, contributing 9.5% of the total cash income giving an impression that MAPs provide supplementary source of income. A total of 731.5 tons of MAPs, comprising 17 products (from 17 species) with total value of NRs 31.3 million (US$ 315,175) was traded from the district. Rittha (Sapindus mukorossi), tejpat (Cinnamomum tamala) and pakhanved (Bergenia ciliata) were traded in higher amounts, representing 356.5, 171.0 and 70.0 tons, respectively. The cumulative value of trade was highest for satuwa (Paris polyphylla) with NRs 7.7 million. Nepalgunj is the favoured 'transit' city for the export of MAPs to India accounting for more than 82% of MAPs sourced from Baitadi. Satuwa has been identified as the most vulnerable species mainly due to premature and over-harvesting in response to high price and growing regional demand coupled with slow growth and high habitat specificity that may results in impaired population growth, thus demanding a detailed bio-physical studies. The study finds that strict regulatory mechanism like ban proves to be less effective in species conservation and suggest adopting alternative management strategies."
