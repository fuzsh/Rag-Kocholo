Please help!\" is not enough.\n\nCould you please be more specific? Any additional details, error messages from logs, results of troubleshooting, etc?\n\nOkay, I have pull a NodeJS application from my remote repository.\n\nI configured the NodeJS extension like this.\n\nOnly, when I wish to access my domain: \"api.as-sellerie.fr\", an error appears with the code \"c61ecbaf\".\n\nIn the domain logs, an error 500 :\n\nHonestly, I'm a brand new Plesk customer and I use Google Translate to communicate in English, lol.\n\nIf you have an idea, or a hypothesis, I am interested. I keep looking for the answer to the problem in the meantime, and come back to you if I have an idea.\n\nKings regards\n\nIt's possible not to use phusion passenger?\n\nEDIT :\n\nI found the logs :\n\n[Wed Apr 01 01:32:46.549460 2020] [autoindex:error] [pid 444:tid 140497834174208] [client 192.168.1.1:56202] AH01276: Cannot serve directory /var/www/vhosts/as-sellerie.fr/api.as-sellerie.fr/: No matching DirectoryIndex (index.html,index.cgi,index.pl,index.php,index.xhtml,index.htm,index.shtml) found, and server-generated directory index forbidden by Options directive\n\nI tried this, it didn't work\n\n# ls -la /var/www/vhosts/as-sellerie.fr/api.as-sellerie.fr/\n\nOUTPUT\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n*****************************************************************************************************\n\nIn the file manager, I clicked on \"as-sellerie.fr\".\n\nThen I go to the files for my subdomain and i add the file .htaccess.\n\nI configure the .htaccess file like this.\n\nMy website appears with an error 500.\n\nHere is the log.\n\n[Wed Apr 01 16:34:04.627038 2020] [core:alert] [pid 19115:tid 140497996625664] [client 192.168.1.1:57794] /var/www/vhosts/as-sellerie.fr/api.as-sellerie.fr/.htaccess: <Location not allowed here\n\nBUG FIXED\n\nâ€‹\n\nI found the answer to the problem. I deleted the .htaccess file, there was no report.\n\nPhusionPassenger did not detect the startup file \"app.js\".\n\nFor the proper functioning of the application you must create a file server.js which creates a server by pointing your file app.js.\n\nDo not specify listening on a strict number as I have been able to do.\n\nFor example, for PhusionPassenger to work, write:\n\nhttp.createServer(app).listen(process.env.PORT);\n\nAnd not :\n\nhttp.createServer(app).listen(5000);\n\n________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n*********************************************************************************************************\n\nThank you Igor for the time you spent trying to find a solution. I hope my post will help other users.\n\nThank you."
