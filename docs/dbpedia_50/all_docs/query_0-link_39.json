For example if you want to send some parcel or documents to Kathmandu, Nepal from United states then you must need an ZIP/POSTAL/PIN code of your place or nearest POST office.\n\nWhat is My Zip code ?\n\nSimple, your postal code is same as the pace you are living. For example, if you are living in Kathmandu (Sundhara) then your zip code is 44600.\n\nHow can i use POSTAL/ZIP/PIN code ?\n\nFind the zip code you need, and mix it with address after writing district.\n\nFor Eg:\n\nxyz road, ward no. 06\n\nold baneshwor\n\nKathmandu, 44600\n\nNepal\n\nWhat is the Address format of Nepal ? (Updated 2020)\n\n(House Number: 322)\n\nAddress line 1: Street_Address_line_1 (for eg: Annapurna Road, Ward Number 9 )\n\nCity/Town: (for eg: Pokhara)\n\nState/Province: Province name or number\n\nDistrict : (for eg: Kaski )\n\nZip code: XXX XXX\n\nHow do I write my shipping address to get products in Nepal from foreign country ?\n\nIf you provide the shipping address as above standard forget your product. It’s nearly impossible to receive any product in that way. Even the post office authorities can’t figure out how to ship that product to you. Make sure you include 2/3 phone numbers in your shipping address. How? there’s always an optional field to fill out in the shipping address that is Address line 2 (Optional). In that optional field you can write like, Address line 2: Phone 98XXX-XX-XXX"
