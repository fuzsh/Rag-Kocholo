        "text": "KHOTANG, June 17: Basanta Rai, a teacher at Janata Secondary School, Diprung Rural Municipality-4, Khotang, resigned from his post on April 18 in order to file his candidacy in the local elections. Rai who is a supporter of the Nepali Congress (NC) wanted to contest for the major post of the rural municipality. He lobbied with the local NC leaders for his candidacy till the last moment, but unfortunately he failed to get a ticket.\n\nThat was when Rai realized that quitting job was not a good idea at all. He had followed the advice of some of his close friends when he made his mind to join politics by quitting his job. “It was not easy for me to quit job and join politics. I didn't realize that getting a ticket from the party would be such a big deal,” said Rai, adding, “Now I have decided to help other friends who have got tickets from the party.”\n\nThe story of Keshav Raj Karki, a former teacher of Saraswoti Secondary School of Dandakharka, Diprung Rural Municipality-5 is no different. Karki, who submitted his resignation on April 30 wanted to compete for the chief post of the rural municipality. However, he was not able to convince the party leaders for a ticket.\n\nAfter failing to get party tickets, many teachers who resigned from their jobs just for that, are regretting their decisions now. They neither have the job nor do they have the option to join politics. So, these days they are trying to keep themselves busy by participating in the promotional campaigns of other candidates.\n\nFor the second round of local elections slated for June 28 as many as five Secondary, two lower primary and 14 primary school teachers submitted their resignations. Though most of them got tickets from various parties, some could not.\n\nBishwanath Niraula who resigned from the post of Information Officer at Makpa Secondary School has been picked by the NC to compete for the chief post of Ainselu Kharka Rural Municipality. Likewise, Rajan Dhakal, a former teacher at Simpani Secondary School, Khotehang Rural Municipality, has filed his candidacy for the chief post of the rural municipality. Khem Bahadur Khadka, Principal of Diktel Multiple College resigned from his job after being assured by NC for the ticket to compete for the major post of Jantedhunga Rural Municipality. These days he is busy wooing the voters in his locality.\n\nAccording to some party cadres, the parties fear that the teachers who quit their jobs but didn't get tickets won't be providing support to the parties candidates. However, most of such teachers have assured to support their parties despite not getting a ticket. “I am not disappointed by the party. Just because I didn't get the ticket does not mean I will stop supporting my party,” said Rai, adding, “At the end of the day, whoever has got the ticket represents our party.”"
