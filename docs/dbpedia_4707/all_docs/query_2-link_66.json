The reason is straightforward. While gross profit may be high, factors like elevated taxes or expanded operating expenses can weigh down net profit. This underscores the importance of net income over other profit metrics such as gross or operating income.\n\nNow, let's explore the top 5 quarterly net profit figures for LUV. We'll begin by examining a table containing the top quarter names and their corresponding profit figures.\n\nQuarter-YearNet Income ($)Income in $ BillionIncome Change from Highest Value ($ Billion)Q4-20171747000000.001.747Q2-2016820000000.000.82-0.927 (-53.0624%)Q2-2022760000000.000.76-0.987 (-56.4969%)Q2-2017743000000.000.743-1.004 (-57.4699%)Q2-2019741000000.000.741-1.006 (-57.5844%)\n\nNow, let's visualize the top net profit quarters of Southwest Airlines Co in a graphical representation.\n\n4 Bottom 5 Net Profit Quarters for LUV\n\nContrary to the previous section, this part aims to shed light on the quarters that fell short in terms of profit compared to others. We will explore the 5 quarters with the lowest net profit values.\n\nNote: Consider bookmarking this report for future in-depth analysis of why these quarters underperformed.\n\nSimilar to the previous section, we'll begin by examining a graph depicting the 5 quarters with the lowest net profit values.\n\nQuarter-YearNet Income ($)Income in $ BillionIncome Change from Lowest Value ($ Billion)Q3-2020-1157000000.00-1.157Q2-2020-915000000.00-0.9150.242 (-20.9162%)Q4-2020-908000000.00-0.9080.249 (-21.5212%)Q1-2022-278000000.00-0.2780.879 (-75.9723%)Q4-2022-220000000.00-0.220.937 (-80.9853%)\n\nNow, let's visualize the profit values using a bar graph.\n\n5 Southwest Airlines Co's Net Income Growth Compared to Industry Peers\n\nIn the final section, we embark on an interesting journey by comparing the net income performance of LUV with that of three industry peers. Our focus will be on assessing the growth of net profit over a span of three years.\n\nBelow, you'll find a table that includes Southwest Airlines Co alongside its industry peers. The second column displays the net profit value at the beginning of the three-year period (calculated using the method outlined in the first section). The third column showcases the most recent annual net profit figures. The final column reveals the growth over this period.\n\nCompany NameNet Income (Open)Net Income (Close)GrowthSouthwest Airlines Co (LUV)-3.07 Billion539 Million3.61 BillionDelta Air Lines Inc (DAL)-12.39 Billion1.32 Billion13.7 BillionUal Corp (UAL)-7.07 Billion737 Million7.81 BillionAlaska Air Group Inc (ALK)-1.32 Billion58 Million1.38 Billion\n\nConclusion\n\nWe trust that the preceding report has been instrumental in your analysis of the bottom-line performance of Southwest Airlines Co. It's important to remember that profit, while significant, is just one factor when considering an investment in a company. Equally crucial is assessing whether the stock's price is reasonable relative to the company's profit.
