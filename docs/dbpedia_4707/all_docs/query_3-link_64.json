        "text": "DALLAS â€“ Fourth-quarter profit fell sharply at American Airlines, and the carrier predicted it would lose money in early 2024, while Southwest Airlines posted a loss, as both carriers struggled to cover rising labor costs.\n\nSouthwest also said Thursday that it expects to receive fewer new planes than it expected this year because of ongoing production problems at Boeing.\n\nAmerican said Thursday that it earned $19 million in the fourth quarter, down from $803 million a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, mostly contract-ratification bonuses for pilots, the airline said adjusted profit was 29 cents per share.\n\nAnalysts expected American Airlines Group Inc. to earn 11 cents per share, according to a FactSet survey.\n\nRevenue declined 1%, to $13.06 billion, slightly higher than analysts had forecast.\n\nThe Fort Worth, Texas-based airline said it expects to lose between 15 cents and 35 cents per share in the first quarter, typically the slowest travel period of the year. However, American forecast that it will earn between $2.25 and $3.25 per share for all of 2024.\n\nSouthwest lost $219 million in the fourth quarter, nearly identical to its results in the same quarter a year earlier. Excluding one-time costs, mostly tied to a new contract with pilots, the airline said adjusted earnings were 37 cents per share.\n\nWall Street expected Southwest Airlines Co. to earn 12 cents per share.\n\nRevenue increased more than 10%, to $6.82 billion, beating analysts' forecast and setting a record for the Dallas-based carrier.\n\nSouthwest also said it expects to get 79 new Boeing planes this year, six fewer than it had planned, and none of them will be Boeing 737 Max 7 jets.\n\nBoeing is already behind schedule in gaining regulatory approval for the small Max 7, and that process will likely be pushed back even farther by this month's accident on a Max 9 after one of those planes suffered a midflight blowout of a panel that plugs spots that can be used for extra doors.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration announced late Wednesday that it has approved an inspection process that will let United and Alaska airlines resume flying their Max 9s this weekend, ending a three-week grounding.\n\nEarlier this week, United said it expects to lose money in the first quarter because of the grounding."
