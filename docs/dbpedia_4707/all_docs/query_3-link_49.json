        "text": "Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV) reported second-quarter 2024 earnings of 58 cents per share, which outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 50 cents but declined 46.7% from the year-ago reported quarter.\n\nRevenues of $7.354 billion surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.323 billion and improved 4.5% year over year.

Economic fuel costs per gallonare expected to be in the range of $2.60-$2.70.

Earnings decreased 11.9% on a year-over-year basis. Apart from high costs, the carrier blamed the discounting pressure at the low end of the market, which hurt its pricing power, for the disappointing performance.\n\nRevenues of $16.65 billion surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $16.25 billion and increased 6.9% year over year, driven by upbeat air travel demand. Adjusted operating revenues (excluding third-party refinery sales) came in at $15.41 billion, up 5.4% year over year.\n\nJ.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc. (JBHT)reported disappointing second-quarter 2024 results wherein both earnings and revenues lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate.\n\nJBHT’s earnings of $1.32 per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.51 and declined 27% year over year.\n\nJBHT’stotal operating revenues of $2.93 billionmissed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.03 billion and fell 7% year over year. Total operating revenues, excluding fuel surcharge revenue, fell 6% year over year.The downfall was owing to a 5% decrease in gross revenue per load in Intermodal JBI and a decline in load volume of 25% in Integrated Capacity Solutions (ICS), 9% in Truckload JBT, and 9% in Dedicated Contract Services (DCS). These were partially offset by the 5% revenue growth of Final Mile Services FMS, primarily driven by new contracts implemented over the past year, and a 5% increase in revenue per load in ICS.\n\nUnited Airlines Holdings, Inc. (UAL)reported second-quarter 2024 earnings per share (excluding 18 cents from non-recurring items) of $4.14, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.97. Earnings decreased 17.7% on a year-over-year basis.\n\nOperating revenues of $14.98 billion missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $15.13 billion. The top line increased 5.7% year over year due to upbeat air-travel demand. This was driven by a 5.2% rise in passenger revenues (which accounted for 91.2% of the top line) to $13.680 billion. Almost 44,375 passengers traveled on UAL flights in the second quarter, up 5.8% year over year.\n\nZacks Investment Research"
