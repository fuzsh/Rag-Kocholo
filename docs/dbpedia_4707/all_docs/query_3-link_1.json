        "text": "DALLAS, July 25, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Southwest Airlines Co. (NYSE: LUV) (the \"Company\") today reported its second quarter 2024 financial results:\n\nNet income of $367 million, or $0.58 per diluted share\n\nNet income, excluding special items1, of $370 million, or $0.58 per diluted share\n\nRecord quarterly operating revenues of $7.4 billion\n\nLiquidity2 of $11.0 billion, well in excess of debt outstanding of $8.0 billion\n\nBob Jordan, President, Chief Executive Officer, & Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors, stated, \"Our second quarter performance was impacted by both external and internal factors and fell short of what we believe we are capable of delivering. The Southwest Airlines Board of Directors, our Leadership Team, and I are all aligned and committed to serving the interests of and creating lasting value for our Shareholders, who have provided us with highly valuable and candid feedback on our performance and path forward. Our goal is to restore industry-leading margins and historical levels of Shareholder returns through our comprehensive plan to deliver transformational commercial initiatives, improved operational efficiency, and capital allocation discipline.\n\n\"We are taking urgent and deliberate steps to mitigate near-term revenue challenges and implement longer-term transformational initiatives that are designed to drive meaningful top and bottom-line growth. As we announced this morning, our implementation of assigned and premium seating is part of an ongoing and comprehensive upgrade to the Customer Experience, one that research shows Customers overwhelmingly prefer. With record numbers of Passengers choosing Southwest Airlines today and work underway to address the challenges we face, we are excited about what the future holds. We remain focused on developing and implementing a robust portfolio of initiatives to drive margin expansion and improve ROIC3 performance, all of which will be shared in detail at our Investor Day in late September.\n\n\"I want to thank our incredible Employees for their continued hard work, especially in this challenging environment. I am confident we have the right strategy, the right plan, and the right Team in place to continue evolving the business and driving Southwest Airlines forward.\"\n\nGuidance and Outlook:\n\nThe following tables introduce or update selected financial guidance for third quarter and full year 2024, as applicable:\n\nRevenue Results and Outlook:\n\nSecond quarter 2024 operating revenues were an all-time quarterly record of $7.4 billion, a 4.5 percent increase, year-over-year\n\nSecond quarter 2024 RASM decreased 3.8 percent, year-over-year\n\nThe Company's second quarter 2024 revenue performance was an all-time quarterly record driven by all-time quarterly record passengers carried, passenger revenue, and ancillary revenue. In addition, managed business revenues continued to improve on a year-over-year basis. The Company's second quarter 2024 unit revenue declined 3.8 percent relative to second quarter 2023, driven primarily by industry-wide domestic capacity growth outpacing demand. In addition, there was an estimated two points of year-over-year headwind from revenue management challenges as the Company sold an excess number of seats for the peak summer travel period too early in the booking curve. These headwinds were partially offset by the Company's commercial actions, particularly network optimization efforts and GDS maturation, which contributed more than three points of combined unit revenue benefit to second quarter 2024. Second quarter unit revenue came in slightly better than the Company's previous expectation of down 4.0 percent to 4.5 percent, year-over-year, aided by resilient operations during severe weather events in the final days of June and the resulting benefit from incremental bookings from other carrier cancellations.\n\nThe Company expects third quarter 2024 unit revenue to be in the range of flat to down 2 percent on a year-over-year basis with capacity up roughly 2 percent, also on a year-over-year basis. This guidance range contemplates a revenue management headwind similar to second quarter 2024 of two points from bookings already in place. In 2023, the Company transitioned to a modernized Origin and Destination (\"O&D\") revenue management system that consistently produced results superior to its prior leg-based revenue management system during an eighteen-month long parallel test prior to launch. The Company continues to gain experience with the system, particularly in periods with changing capacity and close-in changes to published schedules driven by Boeing's aircraft delivery challenges. The Company recently conducted an evaluation of its revenue management performance, including a third-party review, to identify opportunities to improve the revenue management of future bookings. Those opportunities are currently being actioned. The Company continues to believe that the new revenue management system will deliver better long-term performance compared with its prior system. In addition to revenue management actions, network optimization and capacity moderation in the second half of the year are expected to support sequential year-over-year unit revenue improvement. Summer, fall, and recently published winter base schedules all include changes to better match supply to demand with capacity expected to decline 4 percent year-over-year in fourth quarter, and seats and trips to decline roughly 8 percent year-over-year in fourth quarter. As such, the Company expects unit revenue to inflect positively by fourth quarter 2024, on a year-over-year basis.\n\nFuel Costs and Outlook:\n\nSecond quarter 2024 economic fuel costs were $2.76 per gallon1—in line with the Company's previous expectations—and included $0.07 per gallon in premium expense and $0.04 per gallon in favorable cash settlements from fuel derivative contracts\n\nSecond quarter 2024 fuel efficiency improved 1.1 percent, year-over-year, primarily due to more -8 aircraft, the Company's most fuel-efficient aircraft, as a percentage of its fleet\n\nAs of July 17, 2024, the fair market value of the Company's fuel derivative contracts settling in third quarter 2024 through the end of 2026 was an asset of $194 million\n\nThe Company's multi-year fuel hedging program continues to provide protection against spikes in energy prices. The Company's current fuel derivative contracts contain a combination of instruments based on West Texas Intermediate and Brent crude oil, and refined products, such as heating oil. The economic fuel price per gallon sensitivities4 provided in the table below assume the relationship between Brent crude oil and refined products based on market prices as of July 17, 2024.\n\nIn addition, the Company is providing its maximum percentage of estimated fuel consumption6 covered by fuel derivative contracts in the following table:\n\nNon-Fuel Costs and Outlook:\n\nSecond quarter 2024 operating expenses increased 11.4 percent, year-over-year, to $7.0 billion\n\nSecond quarter 2024 operating expenses, excluding fuel and oil expense, special items, and profitsharing1, increased 15.1 percent, year-over-year\n\nSecond quarter 2024 CASM-X increased 6.0 percent, year-over-year\n\nThe Company's second quarter CASM-X increase came in better than its previous expectation of an increase in the 6.5 percent to 7.5 percent range due in part to continued benefits from cost mitigation efforts, including meaningful participation in voluntary time off programs. The majority of the second quarter CASM-X increase, year-over-year, was attributable to anticipated cost increases, most notably market-driven rate inflation in salaries, wages, and benefits, and higher maintenance expenses.\n\nThe Company continues to expect similar cost pressures for the remainder of the year, driving third quarter 2024 CASM-X to an expected increase in the range of 11 percent to 13 percent, year-over-year. The sequential year-over-year increase from second quarter 2024 is primarily due to lower year-over-year capacity growth in third quarter 2024. The Company continues to expect full year 2024 CASM-X to increase in the range of 7 percent to 8 percent, year-over-year.\n\nFleet, Capacity, and Capital Spending:\n\nDuring second quarter 2024, the Company received five -8 aircraft and retired six -700 aircraft and one -800 aircraft, ending second quarter with 817 aircraft. Given the Company's ongoing discussions with Boeing and expected aircraft delivery delays, the Company continues to plan for approximately 20 -8 aircraft deliveries in 2024, which differs from its contractual order book displayed in the table below. Likewise, the Company's retirement plans remain unchanged, with approximately 35 aircraft retirements in 2024 (31 -700s and four -800s), resulting in a fleet of roughly 802 aircraft at year-end 2024. While the Company has not further adjusted capacity expectations this quarter, it will continue to closely monitor the ongoing aircraft delivery delays with Boeing and adjust expectations, conservatively, as needed.\n\nThe Company's flight schedule is published for sale through March 5, 2025. The Company estimates third quarter 2024 capacity to increase approximately 2 percent, fourth quarter 2024 capacity to decrease approximately 4 percent, and full year 2024 capacity to increase approximately 4 percent, all year-over-year. The Company continues to plan for year-over-year capacity growth beyond 2024 to be at or below macroeconomic growth trends until the Company reaches its long-term financial goal to consistently achieve after-tax ROIC well above its weighted average cost of capital.\n\nThe Company's second quarter 2024 capital expenditures were $494 million, driven primarily by aircraft-related capital spending, as well as technology, facilities, and operational investments. The Company continues to estimate its 2024 capital spending to be roughly $2.5 billion, which includes approximately $1.0 billion in aircraft capital spending, assuming approximately 20 -8 aircraft deliveries in 2024 and continued progress delivery payments for the Company's contractual 2025 firm orders. The Company and Boeing are in ongoing discussions regarding the negative financial impacts to the Company as a result of aircraft delivery delays. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, any compensation negotiated and received from Boeing for financial damages associated with such delays would be expected to be realized as a reduction in the cost basis of certain aircraft either in the Company's fleet or associated with future deliveries from Boeing.\n\nSince the previous financial results released on April 25, 2024, the Company exercised two -7 options for delivery in 2025 and converted two 2025 -7 firm orders into 2025 -8 firm orders. The following tables provide further information regarding the Company's contractual order book and compare its contractual order book as of July 25, 2024, with its previous order book as of April 25, 2024. The contractual order book as of July 25, 2024 does not include the impact of delivery delays and is subject to change based on ongoing discussions with Boeing.\n\nLiquidity and Capital Deployment:\n\nThe Company ended second quarter 2024 with $10.0 billion in cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, and a fully available revolving credit line of $1.0 billion\n\nThe Company continues to have a large base of unencumbered assets with a net book value of approximately $17.1 billion, including $14.3 billion in aircraft value and $2.8 billion in non-aircraft assets such as spare engines, ground equipment, and real estate\n\nThe Company had a net cash position7 of $2.0 billion, and adjusted debt to invested capital (\"leverage\")8 of 46 percent as of June 30, 2024\n\nThe Company has returned $215 million to its Shareholders through the payment of dividends year-to-date as of June 30, 2024\n\nThe Company paid $8 million during second quarter 2024 to retire debt and finance lease obligations, including $1 million in principal related to lease return transactions and $7 million in scheduled lease payments\n\nThe Company paid $6 million during June 2024 to repurchase and cancel its outstanding stock warrants, previously issued in connection with the Payroll Support Program\n\nAwards and Recognitions:\n\nRanked the #1 Airline for Economy Class Customer Satisfaction in the J.D.

In addition, information regarding special items and economic results is included in the accompanying table Reconciliation of Reported Amounts to Non-GAAP Measures (also referred to as \"excluding special items\").\n\n2Includes $10.0 billion in cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and a fully available revolving credit line of $1.0 billion.\n\n3Return on invested capital (\"ROIC\"). See Note Regarding Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures for additional information on ROIC. In addition, information regarding ROIC and economic results is included in the accompanying table Non-GAAP Return on Invested Capital (ROIC).\n\n4Based on the Company's existing fuel derivative contracts and market prices as of July 17, 2024, third quarter, fourth quarter, and full year 2024 economic fuel costs per gallon are estimated to be in the range of $2.60 to $2.70, $2.60 to $2.70, and $2.70 to $2.80, respectively. Economic fuel cost projections do not reflect the potential impact of special items because the Company cannot reliably predict or estimate the hedge accounting impact associated with the volatility of the energy markets, or the impact to its financial statements in future periods. Accordingly, the Company believes a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the equivalent GAAP financial measures for projected results is not meaningful or available without unreasonable effort. See Note Regarding Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\n\n5Projections do not reflect the potential impact of fuel and oil expense, special items, and profitsharing because the Company cannot reliably predict or estimate those items or expenses or their impact to its financial statements in future periods, especially considering the significant volatility of the fuel and oil expense line item. Accordingly, the Company believes a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the equivalent GAAP financial measures for these projected results is not meaningful or available without unreasonable effort.\n\n6The Company's maximum fuel hedged percentage is calculated using the maximum number of gallons that are covered by derivative contracts divided by the Company's estimate of total fuel gallons to be consumed for each respective period. The Company's maximum number of gallons that are covered by derivative contracts may be at different strike prices and at strike prices materially higher than the current market prices. The volume of gallons covered by derivative contracts that are ultimately exercised in any given period may vary significantly from the volumes used to calculate the Company's maximum fuel hedged percentages, as market prices and the Company's fuel consumption fluctuate.\n\n7Net cash position is calculated as the sum of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, less the sum of short-term and long-term debt.\n\n8See Note Regarding Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures for an explanation of the Company's leverage calculation.\n\n9Southwest Airlines Co. received the highest score in the Economy Class segment of the J.D. Power 2022-2024 North American Airline Satisfaction Studies of passengers' satisfaction with their airline experience.

These forward-looking statements are based on the Company's current estimates, intentions, beliefs, expectations, goals, strategies, and projections for the future and are not guarantees of future performance. Forward-looking statements involve risks, uncertainties, assumptions, and other factors that are difficult to predict and that could cause actual results to vary materially from those expressed in or indicated by them. Factors include, among others, (i) the impact of fears or actual outbreaks of diseases, extreme or severe weather and natural disasters, actions of competitors (including, without limitation, pricing, scheduling, capacity, and network decisions, and consolidation and alliance activities), consumer perception, economic conditions, banking conditions, fears or actual acts of terrorism or war, sociodemographic trends, and other factors beyond the Company's control, on consumer behavior and the Company's results of operations and business decisions, plans, strategies, and results; (ii) the Company's ability to timely and effectively implement, transition, operate, and maintain the necessary information technology systems and infrastructure to support its operations and initiatives, including with respect to revenue management; (iii) the cost and effects of the actions of activist shareholders; (iv) the Company's ability to obtain and maintain adequate infrastructure and equipment to support its operations and initiatives; (v) the impact of fuel price changes, fuel price volatility, volatility of commodities used by the Company for hedging jet fuel, and any changes to the Company's fuel hedging strategies and positions, on the Company's business plans and results of operations; (vi) the Company's dependence on The Boeing Company (\"Boeing\") and Boeing suppliers with respect to the Company's aircraft deliveries, Boeing MAX 7 aircraft certifications, fleet and capacity plans, operations, maintenance, strategies, and goals; (vii) the Company's dependence on the Federal Aviation Administration with respect to safety approvals for the new cabin layout and the certification of the Boeing MAX 7 aircraft; (viii) the Company's dependence on other third parties, in particular with respect to its technology plans, its plans and expectations related to revenue management, operational reliability, fuel supply, maintenance, Global Distribution Systems, and the impact on the Company's operations and results of operations of any third party delays or non-performance; (ix) the Company's ability to timely and effectively prioritize its initiatives and focus areas and related expenditures; (x) the impact of labor matters on the Company's business decisions, plans, strategies, and results; (xi) the impact of governmental regulations and other governmental actions on the Company's business plans, results, and operations; (xii) the Company's dependence on its workforce, including its ability to employ and retain sufficient numbers of qualified Employees with appropriate skills and expertise to effectively and efficiently maintain its operations and execute the Company's plans, strategies, and initiatives; (xiii) the emergence of additional costs or effects associated with the cancelled flights in December 2022, including litigation, government investigation and actions, and internal actions; and (xiv) other factors, as described in the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the detailed factors discussed under the heading \"Risk Factors\" in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.\n\nNOTE REGARDING USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\n\nThe Company's unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\"GAAP\"). These GAAP financial statements may include (i) unrealized noncash adjustments and reclassifications, which can be significant, as a result of accounting requirements and elections made under accounting pronouncements relating to derivative instruments and hedging and (ii) other charges and benefits the Company believes are unusual and/or infrequent in nature and thus may make comparisons to its prior or future performance difficult.\n\nAs a result, the Company also provides financial information in this release that was not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to the information prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company provides supplemental non-GAAP financial information (also referred to as \"excluding special items\"), including results that it refers to as \"economic,\" which the Company's management utilizes to evaluate its ongoing financial performance and the Company believes provides additional insight to investors as supplemental information to its GAAP results. The non-GAAP measures provided that relate to the Company's performance on an economic fuel cost basis include Operating expenses, non-GAAP excluding Fuel and oil expense; Operating expenses, non-GAAP excluding Fuel and oil expense and profitsharing; Operating income, non-GAAP; Other gains, net, non-GAAP; Income before income taxes, non-GAAP; Provision for income taxes, net, non-GAAP; Net income, non-GAAP; Net income per share, diluted, non-GAAP; and Operating expenses per ASM, non-GAAP, excluding Fuel and oil expense and profitsharing (cents). The Company's economic Fuel and oil expense results differ from GAAP results in that they only include the actual cash settlements from fuel hedge contracts - all reflected within Fuel and oil expense in the period of settlement. Thus, Fuel and oil expense on an economic basis has historically been utilized by the Company, as well as some of the other airlines that utilize fuel hedging, as it reflects the Company's actual net cash outlays for fuel during the applicable period, inclusive of settled fuel derivative contracts. Any net premium costs paid related to option contracts that are designated as hedges are reflected as a component of Fuel and oil expense, for both GAAP and non-GAAP (including economic) purposes in the period of contract settlement. The Company believes these economic results provide further insight into the impact of the Company's fuel hedges on its operating performance and liquidity since they exclude the unrealized, noncash adjustments and reclassifications that are recorded in GAAP results in accordance with accounting guidance relating to derivative instruments, and they reflect all cash settlements related to fuel derivative contracts within Fuel and oil expense. This enables the Company's management, as well as investors and analysts, to consistently assess the Company's operating performance on a year-over-year or quarter-over-quarter basis after considering all efforts in place to manage fuel expense. However, because these measures are not determined in accordance with GAAP, such measures are susceptible to varying calculations, and not all companies calculate the measures in the same manner. As a result, the aforementioned measures, as presented, may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies.\n\nFurther information on (i) the Company's fuel hedging program, (ii) the requirements of accounting for derivative instruments, and (iii) the causes of hedge ineffectiveness and/or mark-to-market gains or losses from derivative instruments is included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.\n\nThe Company's GAAP results in the applicable periods may include other charges or benefits that are also deemed \"special items,\" that the Company believes make its results difficult to compare to prior periods, anticipated future periods, or industry trends. Financial measures identified as non-GAAP (or as excluding special items) have been adjusted to exclude special items. For the periods presented, in addition to the items discussed above, special items include:\n\nAccruals associated with the recently ratified Ramp, Operations, Provisioning, and Cargo Agents contract. These amounts accrued in 2024 relate to additional compensation for services performed by Employees outside of this fiscal year;\n\nCharges associated with tentative litigation settlements regarding certain California state meal-and-rest-break regulations for flight attendants and an arbitration award in favor of the Company's Pilots relating to a collective-bargaining matter;\n\nUnrealized mark-to-market adjustment associated with certain available for sale securities;\n\nIncremental expense associated with the recently ratified Pilot and Flight Attendant contracts. The change in estimate recognized in 2023 relates to additional compensation for services performed by Employees outside of the applicable fiscal period;\n\nA charge associated with a settlement reached with the Department of Transportation as a result of the Company's December 2022 operational disruption; and\n\nExpenses associated with incremental professional advisory fees related to activist investor activities, which were not budgeted by the Company, are not associated with the ongoing operation of the airline, and are difficult to predict in future periods.\n\nBecause management believes special items can distort the trends associated with the Company's ongoing performance as an airline, the Company believes that evaluation of its financial performance can be enhanced by a supplemental presentation of results that exclude the impact of special items in order to enhance consistency and comparativeness with results in prior periods that do not include such items and as a basis for evaluating operating results in future periods. The following measures are often provided, excluding special items, and utilized by the Company's management, analysts, and investors to enhance comparability of year-over-year results, as well as to industry trends: Operating expenses, non-GAAP excluding Fuel and oil expense; Operating expenses, non-GAAP excluding Fuel and oil expense and profitsharing; Operating income, non-GAAP; Other gains, net, non-GAAP; Income before income taxes, non-GAAP; Provision for income taxes, net, non-GAAP; Net income, non-GAAP; Net income per share, diluted, non-GAAP; and Operating expenses per ASM, non-GAAP, excluding Fuel and oil expense and profitsharing (cents).\n\nThe Company has also provided its calculation of return on invested capital, which is a measure of financial performance used by management to evaluate its investment returns on capital. Return on invested capital is not a substitute for financial results as reported in accordance with GAAP and should not be utilized in place of such GAAP results. Although return on invested capital is not a measure defined by GAAP, it is calculated by the Company, in part, using non-GAAP financial measures. Those non-GAAP financial measures are utilized for the same reasons as those noted above for Net income, non-GAAP and Operating income, non-GAAP. The comparable GAAP measures include charges or benefits that are deemed \"special items\" that the Company believes make its results difficult to compare to prior periods, anticipated future periods, or industry trends, and the Company's profitability targets and estimates, both internally and externally, are based on non-GAAP results since \"special items\" cannot be reliably predicted or estimated. The Company believes non-GAAP return on invested capital is a meaningful measure because it quantifies the Company's effectiveness in generating returns relative to the capital it has invested in its business. Although return on invested capital is commonly used as a measure of capital efficiency, definitions of return on invested capital differ; therefore, the Company is providing an explanation of its calculation for non-GAAP return on invested capital in the accompanying reconciliation in order to allow investors to compare and contrast its calculation to the calculations provided by other companies.\n\nThe Company has also provided adjusted debt, invested capital, and adjusted debt to invested capital (leverage), which are non-GAAP measures of financial performance. Management believes these supplemental measures can provide a more accurate view of the Company's leverage and risk, since they consider the Company's debt and debt-like obligation profile and capital. Leverage ratios are widely used by investors, analysts, and rating agencies in the valuation, comparison, rating, and investment recommendations of companies. Although adjusted debt, invested capital, and leverage ratios are commonly-used financial measures, definitions of each differ; therefore, the Company is providing an explanation of its calculations for non-GAAP adjusted debt and adjusted equity in the accompanying reconciliation below in order to allow investors to compare and contrast its calculations to the calculations provided by other companies. Invested capital is adjusted debt plus adjusted equity. Leverage is calculated as adjusted debt divided by invested capital.\n\nSW-QFS\n\nSOURCE Southwest Airlines Co."
