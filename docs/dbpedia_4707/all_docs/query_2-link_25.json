        "text": "Southwest Airlines reported a fourth-quarter loss of $219 million on Thursday, over a year since its December 2022 meltdown that cost the airline.\n\nThe Dallas-based air carrier reported a $498 million profit for 2023 and record fourth-quarter and full-year operating revenues of $6.8 billion and $26.1 billion. But the air carrier isn’t satisfied yet with its profitability.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2022, Southwest had a massive operational meltdown that displaced thousands of passengers and their belongings, resulting in a $140 million settlement with the U.S. Department of Transportation.\n\n“At this time last year, we were getting back on our feet from the disruption following Winter Storm Elliott,” Southwest CEO Bob Jordan told investors. “We quickly mobilized to put immediate mitigation efforts in place while simultaneously building a robust plan to prepare us for future extreme winter weather disruptions.”\n\nSouthwest saw a fourth-quarter cost per available seat mile decrease of 18.1%, year-over-year, due to the elevated operating expenses and lower capacity levels in 2022′s fourth-quarter, a result of the December 2022 disruption.\n\n“We are not satisfied with our current financial performance, and we will work relentlessly until we produce the financial strength and return you should expect from Southwest Airlines,” Southwest chief financial officer Tammy Romo said.\n\nJeffrey Windau, senior equity analyst at Edward Jones, said he believes wages weighed on Southwest’s fourth-quarter performance. This week, pilots at Southwest approved a five-year contract that’s worth $12 billion and boosts pay 50% over the life of the deal. Still at the bargaining table are Southwest’s flight attendants, who recently conducted a strike authorization vote.\n\n“The wages, I think that’s probably front and center...,” Windau said. “I believe they had some adjustments or some charges in accruals to those wages, so I think those are the headwinds in this quarter, which is kind of muddying the waters a little bit. I think operationally it seems like you’re still seeing pressures on costs. I think they’re continuing to improve.”\n\nLooking at 2024, Windau said, Southwest needs to limit disruptions, allowing the air carrier to focus on its network and optimize flights. Research from Raymond James states Southwest’s fourth-quarter earnings per share was “nicely ahead of expectations.”"
