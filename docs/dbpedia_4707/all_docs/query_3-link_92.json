        "text": "Southwest Airlines (LUV) is the first major U.S. airline to report a profit since the pandemic started as federal payroll aid helped boost the company to net income of $116 million in the first quarter. Without the federal money, Southwest would have lost $1 billion in the quarter. Southwest also echoed rivals in saying that demand for travel is continuing to improve. The airline said Thursday that bookings for leisure trips within the United States have been improving each week since mid-February. Without Southwest's share of federal aid and other temporary items, Southwest would have lost $1.72 per share. That result was still slightly better than Wall Street feared. The average estimate of 13 analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research was for a loss of $1.82 per share. Southwest posted revenue of $2.05 billion, slightly above the analysts' prediction of $2.03 billion. Southwest shares have more than doubled in the past 12 months, gaining 33% since the beginning of 2021.\n\n• Shares of AT&T Inc. (T) rose on Thursday after the telecom giant's first-quarter results topped analyst expectations. The company's wireless division, its largest unit, added 595,000 phone customers who pay a monthly bill, up from 163,000 in the same period in 2020. It also added 207,000 prepaid phone customers. In the WarnerMedia entertainment unit, revenue rose 9.8% to $8.5 billion. The company doesn't break out how many people sign up for its streaming service, HBO Max, but said there are now 44.2 million subscribers to HBO Max or the traditional HBO channel in the U.S. AT&T also signed up 46,000 home internet customers and lost 620,000 video customers. The Dallas company reported first-quarter net income of $7.55 billion, or $1.04 per share. Adjusted for one-time items, they came to 86 cents per share, beating the average estimate of 77 cents per share from 16 analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research. Revenue rose 2.7% to $43.94 billion, topping Wall Street's estimate of $42.76 billion.\n\n• Union Pacific's (UNP) first-quarter profit declined 9% as the railroad delivered less freight and its revenue fell. The Omaha, Nebraska, company said on Thursday that it earned $1.34 billion, or $2 per share, in the quarter. That's down from $1.47 billion, or $2.15 per share, a year earlier. The results did not meet Wall Street expectations as it delivered 1% less freight and had to deal with the severe cold in February. Analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research had projected per-share earnings of $2.06. Revenue fell 4% to $5 billion, also short of Wall Street expectations as coal and industrial revenue weakened. The railroad said it expects shipping volume to grow roughly 6% overall in 2021 as the economy recovers from the pandemic and industrial production increases.\n\n• Blackstone Group L.P. (BX) on Thursday reported first-quarter net income of $1.75 billion, after reporting a loss in the same period a year earlier. On a per-share basis, the New York-based company said it had profit of $2.46. Earnings, adjusted for non-recurring gains, were 96 cents per share. The results surpassed Wall Street expectations. The average estimate of six analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research was for earnings of 72 cents per share. The investment manager posted revenue of $5.3 billion in the period. Its adjusted revenue was $2.05 billion, also topping Street forecasts. Four analysts surveyed by Zacks expected $1.76 billion.\n\nThe Associated Press"
