        "text": "By 1842, Charles Dickens was a celebrity writer, known as the creator of classics such as Oliver Twist and Nicholas Nickelby. That year, Dickens ventured across the Atlantic Ocean to visit North America for the first time. Starting his travels in Boston, Dickens would circle his way around the United States and Canada, before returning to England. These travels, spanning from January to June 1842, were detailed in a travel narrative, American Notes for General Circulation (a digital copy is available at home with an NYPL library card or on-site). Reading through this text, Dickens writes not just about the many cities and towns he visits, but also the numerous methods of travel and long lengths of time that were required to get him and his travel companions between various locations.\n\nLet’s take a look at the first major segment of his travel in 1842: from Boston to New York City. By today’s standards, one might either fly non-stop for about 90 minutes or travel 4-5 hours via car or train. In Dickens’s time though, several days are needed—as well as several transfers between steamboats, railroads, and/or stagecoaches—to travel between the two cities.\n\nPondering upon Dickens’s text, I utilized our recently published Historical Travels research guide to recreate the starting route between Boston and New York City that Dickens could have potentially traveled on, using contemporary guidebooks, maps, times tables, and periodicals.\n\nPlease note that as major changes in transportation were underway in the mid-1800s, I endeavored to find resources specific to the month and year (February 1842) that Dickens was traveling in order to be as accurate to his experience as possible. While I did attempt to date all resources to February 1842, I used materials that were within the same time period when materials directly from February 1842 were not available—if so, the date of publication is noted.\n\nTo start his travels in Boston, Dickens would have needed to first get to the city via steamer. Dickens opens his book with “[on the] morning of the third of January eighteen-hundred-and-forty-two, I opened the door of, and put my head into, a ‘state-room’ on board the Britannia steam-packet, twelve hundred tons burthen per register, bound for Halifax and Boston, and carrying Her Majesty’s mails” (page 6).\n\nUsing this line as a reference point, I decided to start my search through periodicals to learn more about Dickens’s arrival in the United States. I used Proquest Historical Newspapers from our Articles and Databases page, and found the following news clipping from Baltimore’s The Sun from January 25, 1842.\n\nReading the clipping, we gather some crucial information about Dickens’s arrival. First, Dickens was not traveling alone—rather he was accompanied by his wife. We know what day Dickens arrived (Saturday, January 22) and that he arrived later than scheduled, which is corroborated by Dickens's assertion that “as we did not land at Boston, in consequence of some detention at the wharf, until after dark, I received my first impressions of the city in walking down to the Custom-house on the morning after our arrival, which was Sunday” (page 13).\n\nAs such, I decided to go to NYPL’s Articles and Databases page to use Ancestry Library Edition (available on-site only) and FamilySearch (available off-site with free login) to see if I could find mention of Dickens in passenger lists.\n\nStarting with Ancestry Library Edition first, I found an entry for a “Charles Dickens” (Occupation: Gentleman) listed in the collection Boston, 1821-1850 Passenger and Immigration Lists.\n\nWhile an image of the actual passenger list was not given, the index entry noted that his arrival date was January 24, 1842. This date doesn’t necessarily compute with the above newspaper, but I do have a theory: since Dickens arrived late on a Saturday, the necessary offices would have been closed on Sunday, leading to paperwork being processed on Monday morning (January 24). I will note that another discrepancy was that the listing indicates that Dickens was 30 years old. Technically, Dickens arrived a few days before his birthday (February 12), technically making him 29 upon arrival, but 30 years old for most of his travels within North America.\n\nAs Ancestry Library Edition did not provide an image, I decided to also look through FamilySearch to see if it would happen to have a digitized copy via its collection Massachusetts, Boston Passenger Lists, 1820-1891.\n\nAs you can see from the actual passenger list image, John Hewitt was listed as the captain of the ship Britannia, which matches the information from the newspaper clipping above. Dickens is listed as the third individual on the listing. Underneath his name is a “Mrs. Dickens” (Occupation: Lady)—I will note that his wife, Catherine Dickens, was actually 26 years old at the time (turning 27 during their travels), not 21—making me wonder if there was an error or if I am reading the scan wrong.\n\nBesides his wife, Dickens also mentions that “I throw my coat on the box, and hoist my wife and her maid into the inside.” That maid has been reported to be Ann Brown. Curious, I did a similar search via these two databases, and was able to locate an “Ann Brown” (Occupation: Servant) on the same passenger list.\n\nAs such, while I am fairly certain that the above records are referring to Charles Dickens and his traveling companions, looking at these passenger lists is a reminder that it is important to note any discrepancies that occur when searching through these types of resources and evaluate their reliability.\n\nAs discrepancies in historical documents are common, it is important to first analyze and evaluate the materials that you are looking at before citing it as a source. To do so, it is imperative to:\n\nobserve the item for its visual details. By interpreting these visual details, you will be able to better understand the visual data that the item is displaying.\n\nreflect upon the item to think about the larger contexts of how the item was made, the perspectives associated with the item, and what is the purpose of the item.\n\nOnce you have analyzed the item, you should evaluate the evidence that you have garnered to see if it is relevant to your research and can be considered reliable.\n\nAs we see from the years of service for this steamer (1840-1849), Dickens traveled on it while it was still relatively new—only two years into service. Reading the description of the ship—three masts, one funnel, wooden hull—we can start to visualize how the ship looked. In Dickens’s introduction to his travel narrative, he does write about the other people on board with him and his interactions with them, but he does not indicate how many other passengers there are. In the indexed entry above though, it states “Passengers: 115 cabin,” giving us a sense of how many other passengers could have potentially been on board with Dickens.\n\n\"The public spirited gentlemen, who resolved that Boston should have a hotel equal at least to any in the United States, accomplished their object with a liberality, taste and skill, that merits the thanks of the citizens, and the warm- est approbation of the stranger. The Tremont House is a splendid ornament as a piece of architecture, and amply supplies what is a desideratum in the character of an ex- cellent inn…This occupies a front on Tremont Street of one hundred and sixty feet. Its height above the level of the area... is sixty-two feet. Two wings extend from the principal building in front, the most northerly of which fronts on Beacon Street, and is 84 feet long by 34 wide. The southerly wing, 110 feet long by 40 wide, terminates westerly in a front, on Tremont Place, which opens from Beacon Street...\"\n\nIn addition, as you can see on the image to the left, the January 26, 1842 issue of the New-York Tribune notes that Dickens was scheduled to visit the Tremont Theatre on Monday January 25.\n\nReferring to our Boston guidebook again, we can see on page 193-195 that the Tremont House, “from its location and construction, is considered the most popular in Boston, and receives patronage from the most wealthy and fashionable…on entering the arched doors in front, there opens a wide hall, from which a flight of steps ascents to the dress circle boxes, and here are the lobbies for the promenade, and separate drawing rooms, communicating with an elegant saloon in the centre.. The prices of admission are $1 to the boxes, 75 cents to the third tier, 50 cents to the pit, and 25 cents to the gallery.”\n\nOf note is that Dickens also visited the State House. While it looks “flat” on this map (as seen above), Dickens effusively compliments the building, noting that “the State House is built upon the summit of a hill, which rises gradually at first, and afterwards by a steep ascent, almost from the water’s edge. In front is a green enclosure, called the Common. The site is beautiful: and from the top there is a charming panoramic view of the whole town and neighbourhood” (page 13).\n\nBesides Boston itself, Dickens took a day trip to Lowell to visit the factories in the area. To get there, Dickens “made acquaintance with an American railroad, on this occasion, for the first time” (page 26). As you can see in the lower right-hand corner of the map below, the Lowell Railroad could be boarded at the railway depot, located in what is now referred to as the West End of Boston.\n\nIn Chapter 5, Dickens opens with the line: “leaving Boston on the afternoon of Saturday the fifth of February, we proceeded by another railroad to Worcester: a pretty New England town, where we had arranged to remain under the hospitable roof of the Governor of the State, until Monday morning” (page 29).\n\nUsing The American traveller, or, Guide through the United States from 1842 (copyrighted 1839), we can see that railroads were already becoming a burgeoning industry within the United States. The guidebook organizes the states and major towns alphabetically and then details a few facts and traveling options for these locations. Please note that a digital copy is available at home with an NYPL library card or on-site.\n\nWhen reading the section for Boston, we find a listing for “Boston and Worcester Rail Road” on page 20:\n\nAs such, travel between the two locations was not limited to just stage coaches, but also allowed for steamboat travel (weather permitted). To learn more about these steamboat routes, I returned to Proquest Historical Newspapers and searched through the digital archives of the Hartford Daily Courant to find any timetables. In the Classified section of the February 1, 1842 issue (image to the left), you can see winter arrangements were available for people traveling from Boston, Pittsfield, or Hudson to Springfield. Further reading of this text indicates that steamboats were leaving Hartford for Springfield, “arriving in season for the noon trains.” Assuming that the steamboats would return to Hartford, there is a high possibility that these mentioned “steamboats” were the ones by which Dickens traveled.\n\nDickens writes that he “shall always entertain a very pleasant and grateful recollection of Hartford. It is a lovely place, and I had many friends there, whom I can never remember with indifference.” However, he did not stay long as, “[they] left it with no little regret on the evening of Friday the 11th, and traveled that night by railroad to New Haven…We reached New Haven at about eight o’clock, after a journey of three hours, and put up for the night at the best inn” (page 31).\n\nLooking in The American traveller, or Guide through the United States, page 32 indicates the existence of a railroad between Hartford and New Haven that would have taken 35 miles:\n\nGoing back to periodicals, while I was not able to find a news clipping from the month that Dickens was traveling, the April 30, 1842 of the Hartford Daily Courant (image on the left) details information about the Hartford and New Haven Rail Road.\n\nAs you can see from this clipping, there was generally a train that left Hartford at around 6 PM, correlating with the fact that Dickens took an evening train to get to New Haven. Of note though is that this schedule is for April 22, 1842 and after—as such, times/fares may differ from when Dickens rode the train in February. For instance, Dickens notes that they rode for three hours and arrived at 8:00 PM, meaning that the train would have possibly left at 5 PM instead.\n\nHowever, this clipping still gives us a good approximation of what Dickens experienced: fare to be around one dollar (or possibly a little bit more), and the availability of an evening train.\n\nLeaving New Haven, Dickens writes “After a night’s rest, we rose early, and in good time went down to the wharf, and on board the packet New York for New York. This was the first American steamboat of any size that I had seen; and certainly to an English eye it was infinitely less like a steamboat than a huge floating bath” (page 32).\n\nWhile searching through periodicals, I was unable to find any information specifically about the New York’s trip in February 1842. However, I was able to identify a generalized route on page 79 of The American traveller, or Guide through the United States: a general route by a steamboat between New Haven and New York would have been around 87 miles, stopping off at 5 ports before reaching New York City."
