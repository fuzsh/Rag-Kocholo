The day after his death, the London Daily Times eulogized him as \"emphatically the novelist of his age. In his pictures of contemporary life posterity will read, more clearly than in contemporary records, the character of nineteenth century life.\" He left a legacy of fourteen novels, as well as short stories, editorials, and sketches, creating over 2000 characters, some of whom, such as Ebenezer Scrooge, have entered the common vernacular. His novels were not formulaic and scholars often divide them into early, middle, and late works, reflecting his personal growth, maturity, and outlook. His works address social issues such as poverty, injustice, and the dangers of industrial progress, espousing themes of childhood and familial relationships reflective of the greater society, and calling attention to the need for progressive education and to the victimization of women and the poor. His depiction of Victorian London has become part of the historical record, and his skill in narration, description, multilevel plotting, colorful characterizations, and imagery are regarded by most critics as superior. David Lodge wrote, \"[Dickens] stands symbolically on the threshold of the modern literary era, and [his] career embodies the difference between being famous and being a celebrity.… Dickens not only wrote novels which became classics of English literature in his own lifetime; he transformed the methods of publishing fiction and thus changed the possibilities of authorship for his contemporaries and their successors.\"\n\nBIOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION\n\nDickens was born February 7, 1812, near the coastal town of Port-Sea (now part of Portsmouth), England, the second of eight children. His father, John Dickens, lived above his social station and beyond his financial means, so his family was constantly short of money and moved often. At the age of six Dickens was sent to school, where he discovered classical authors and developed a love of reading. He also enjoyed the ghost stories told to children at bedtime by their nurses. Christmas was an especially happy time for him and was a setting he recreated in many of his stories. At age nine Dickens discovered the theater and developed a passion for the stage. He became a respectable amateur actor and was often lauded for dramatic public readings of his own works. When the Dickens family moved to London, their economic condition worsened because of their father's recklessness. When his debts became insupportable, John was sent to Marshalsea, the London debtors' prison. At age twelve, Dickens had to leave school and was sent to work at a blacking warehouse gluing labels on bottles of shoe polish. At the time, Dickens lived in cheap lodgings and often went hungry. He visited his family, who had joined his father in prison, but felt abandoned by them. Although this situation lasted less than a year, it left a lasting impression of humiliation, rejection, and misery on young Charles.\n\nWhen his father was released from prison, Dickens returned to school, although his mother wanted him to continue working to support the family. Though he excelled in his studies, at age fifteen Dickens left school, and at eighteen he obtained a reading card for the library at the British Museum, where he continued to educate himself. After leaving school, Dickens worked for two years as a law clerk, then for four years preparing shorthand court reports for the lawyers. As a result of his quickness and accuracy he was offered a job as a newspaper reporter for the Morning Chronicle. From 1834 to 1836 he was a political reporter in Parliament and was soon writing feature articles and sketches about members of Parliament, politics, the London scene, and a variety of characters. His reading audiences enjoyed the absurdities he noted—even in serious situations. Around 1830, Dickens fell in love with Mary Beadnell, a girl several years older than himself. When she broke off the relationship, Dickens resolved to work hard and become successful, and in 1834 his first writings were published. In 1836 he published his first book, Sketches by \"Boz\", a collection of his periodical contributions, which was well received by critics. George Hogarth, reviewing the book, commented that Dickens was a \"close and acute observer of character and manners, with a strong sense of the ridiculous.\"\n\nAlso in 1836, Dickens married Hogarth's daughter Kate. One year later, Dickens welcomed his first child and his first literary success, The Posthumous Papers of the Pickwick Club (1837), vignettes about a group of characters who go out hunting and fishing in the country. Illustrations were done by Hablot Knight Browne under the pseudonym \"Phiz.\" The characters Sam Weller and Sam's father Tony were hugely popular with reading audiences, and this book cemented Dickens's stature in the literary world. The story appealed to all classes, without offensive language or compromising incidents, and signaled the beginning of a long and auspicious writing career.\n\nWithin the next four years Dickens published Oliver Twist, or the Parish Boy's Progress (1838), The Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby (1839), The Old Curiosity Shop (1841), and Barnaby Rudge (1841); all but Barnaby Rudge were popular successes. In 1842 Dickens visited America with his wife but was disappointed by the slavery and political situations he witnessed there. On his return from America he wrote American Notes for General Circulation (1842), which criticized America so severely that his reputation in the United States suffered for a period. By the time Dickens published A Christmas Carol, in Prose (1843), five of his ten children had been born. Supporting such a large family, plus a sister-in-law and his needy father strained Dickens financially; in 1844 he temporarily moved his family to Italy, where expenses were half what they were in London. While in Italy he wrote travel sketches about Italy as well as more Christmas stories, and he published The Life and Adventures of Martin Chuzzlewit (1844), a novel treating greed which was not very successful. In 1846 Dickens moved his family to Switzerland, again in efforts to save money, and while there wrote Dealings with the Firm of Dombey and Son, Wholesale, Retail, and for Exportation (1848), a novel that marks the beginning of his mature period. His next novel, The Personal History of David Copperfield (1851), a highly autobiographical novel, demonstrates a darker outlook, more serious themes, and a change to more character-driven plots. During the 1850s and 1860s Dickens owned and edited his own magazine, Household Words, and increased the frequency of his public speaking engagements, scheduling readings throughout Great Britain and America. In 1858 he separated from his wife. She took their oldest child and left Dickens with the other nine children and her sister, who were soon joined by Dickens's mistress, Nelly Ternan, twenty-seven years his junior. The affair was kept secret from the public during his lifetime and revealed only in 1939. Toward the end of his life, Dickens quarreled with his publishers, found a new publisher, and started the magazine All Year Round, in which he serially published A Tale of Two Cities (1859) and Great Expectations (1861). As Dickens grew older, his production slowed and the time between novels increased. He made a final American tour in 1868, and although it was successful, he returned home exhausted and ill. During the summer in 1870, after a long day of working on his last and unfinished novel, The Mystery of Edwin Drood (1870), Dickens suffered a stroke and died the next day. Although he wanted to be buried in Rochester near his sister-in-law Mary Hogarth, his request was denied and he was interred in the Poets' Corner in Westminster Abbey. His grave was left open for two days to accommodate the mourners, but when the doors of the abbey closed there were still a thousand people waiting outside to pay their respects.\n\nMAJOR WORKS\n\nDickens's first novel, Oliver Twist, focuses on the unfairness of laws governing the poor. It was published in installments in Bentley's Miscellany with illustrations by George Cruikshank. Oliver, the protagonist, is born in the workhouse to a dying mother and is put in an orphanage, where he is mistreated and starved. Sent to apprentice to an undertaker, he runs away to London, where he associates with criminals. He begins his training as a pickpocket under the tutelage of the Artful Dodger and joins Fagin's gang of child thieves but is rescued by the kindly Mr. Brownlow, who turns out to be his grandfather. In the novel, Dickens uses a combination of comedy and tragedy, a technique he would continue to employ in the future. He contrasts the cheeky antics of the Artful Dodger with the brutal environment of the poorhouse and the savagery of the underworld in this work.\n\nProbably Dickens's most famous work and unquestionably his most popular, A Christmas Carol created a new genre of Christmas ghost stories and set a tone for the Christmas season that strongly influenced succeeding generations of celebrants. The parsimonious and cranky Ebenezer Scrooge finds himself the victim of a haunting on Christmas Eve. He is visited first by his old and long-dead partner, who warns him of the danger his soul faces and offers him salvation if he heeds the spirits who will visit him that night. During the night, Scrooge meets three ghosts, the spirits of Christmases past, present, and future, who show him what his life was, is, and will be if he does not change his ways. In the morning, Scrooge has undergone a spiritual transformation and become part of the communal psyche. A Christmas Carol was an immediate financial, literary, and popular success. Many renditions of A Christmas Carol, in the form of plays, musicals, spoofs, and modernizations, have been produced for the stage, screen, television, and radio.\n\nMany critics assert that Dickens invented some of his best characters for David Copperfield, including the profligate Mr. Macawber, based on his own father, the unctuous Uriah Heep, the formidable Betsy Trotwood, and the endearing Peggoty and her family. In the novel, David's father dies before he is born, and his mother remarries a harsh and cruel man, Mr. Murdstone. Murdstone sends David to a school where he suffers cruelly, and when David's mother dies, he is sent to work in a menial job. Rescued by his Aunt Betsy Trotwood, he finally receives an education. He makes an unsuitable marriage to the silly and impractical Dora, mourns her death, furthers his education with travel, and at last returns to marry Agnes, his true love, and begin his life as a writer. David Copperfield was concerned less with social crusades than Dickens's earlier novels were, and critics note the novel as the beginning of a new phase of his work in which he became more concerned with his characters.\n\nA Tale of Two Cities (1859) is often required reading in high school English literature courses. The novel takes place during the French Revolution, although Dickens treats the political situation more as a backdrop than an inherent part of the story. Fast-moving and full of action, the story follows Sydney Carton, an English lawyer in love with a French woman, Lucie Manette. Lucie loves and marries Charles Darnay, a French aristocrat who has fled to London to escape the Revolution. When Darnay returns to Paris on a mission, he is captured and condemned to the guillotine. Carton, who looks like Darnay, rescues Darnay and takes Darnay's place on the scaffold, speaking the line, \"It is a far, far better thing that I do than I have ever done.\" His unselfish sacrifice leaves Lucie happy with the man she loves and who loves her. Although there are historical inaccuracies in the book, factual history was not important to Dickens.\n\nOriginally conceived as a comic novel to bail out Dickens's failing magazine All Year Round, Great Expectations (1861) became Dickens's masterpiece. Philip Pirrip, nicknamed Pip, is a poor orphan who lives with his strict sister and her husband in a coastal town near the moors. One day he chances upon an escaped prisoner in the marshes and tries to help him. Although the prisoner is recaptured, he tells Pip he will repay him. Pip is subsequently summoned to the home of the eccentric Miss Havisham to play with her adopted daughter, Estella. Pip falls in love with Estella, but Miss Havisham, nursing and nurturing the hurt she received when she was left at the altar many years ago, is raising Estella to have no heart; Estella cannot return Pip's affection. Miss Havisham gives Pip money to become apprentice to a blacksmith, and when he later receives money to move to London and set himself up as a gentleman, he assumes it also comes from her. While in London he pursues his education, sees Estella married to another man, and discovers that his true benefactor, the escaped convict Abel Magwitch, is Estella's father. Eleven years later, Pip is working in an export business and decides to visit home. Miss Havisham has died in a fire, and Estella has been widowed. Her experiences have matured and changed her, and she and Pip are finally able to be united.\n\nLess well-known than his novels are Dickens's many short stories, most of them published in Household Words and All Year Round, his own periodicals. Many of his short stories are ghost tales set around the Christmas season and involve magic and memories, such as The Child's Story (1852), about an elderly man, and The Magic Fish-Bone (1868), written in the style of a folk tale. The Life of Our Lord was written by Dickens for his own children and was read to them every Christmas as part of their traditional family celebration. It was not published until 1934, after his children were deceased.\n\nCRITICAL RECEPTION\n\nDickens's work was immensely popular during his lifetime, with wild public anticipation greeting each installment of his ongoing novels as they were published in periodicals. Vast readerships were saddened by the death of Little Nell in The Old Curiosity Shop, and Dickens's unfavorable commentary about Americans in American Notes aroused national outrage among his American readers. His exposure of social ills elicited the full range of public opinion, and the name Charles Dickens was well-known in every English-speaking household. At his death, the world grieved his passing, with Henry Wadsworth Longfellow proclaiming he had never known \"an author's death to cause such general mourning.\"\n\nDickens's life and works have been the subject of tomes of critical analysis and attention. His books remain in print more than 125 years after his death and are required reading in many high school and college literature courses. Irving Howe wrote: \"With the opening chapter of Oliver Twist, Dickens made his way, forever, into world literature.… [I]n its opening chapters … we can recognize the Dickens who belongs in the company of [Nikolai] Gogol, [Honore de] Balzac, and [Fyodor] Dostoevsky.\" Critics and popular audiences alike have embraced Dickens's works, identifying with the common themes and reveling in the succinct characterizations and vivid depictions. Matthew Titolo suggested that David Copperfield was a milestone for Dickens: \" David Copperfield, Charles Dickens's first aesthetically grown-up novel, ironically signals its maturity by linking novel-writing itself with the vicissitudes of childhood.… [The novel] invites us to embrace the ethical compromises of professional life, creating one of the most seductive liberal allegories of grown-up independence in modern literature.\" Dickens's novels and short stories have been adapted to picture books, \"Junior Editions,\" comic book format, and other bowdlerizations; plays, musicals, films, and television specials based on his work abound and continue to be produced and revived; and he is credited with almost single-handedly creating the holiday atmosphere and expectations now common to the Christmas season.\n\nPRINCIPAL WORKS\n\n* Sketches by \"Boz,\" Illustrative of Every-Day Life and Every-Day People [as Boz] (essays and short stories) 1836\n\nThe Posthumous Papers of the Pickwick Club [as Boz] (short stories) 1837\n\n† Oliver Twist, or the Parish Boy's Progress (novel) 1838\n\nThe Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby (novel) 1839\n\nBarnaby Rudge: A Tale of the Riots of 'Eighty (novel) 1841\n\nThe Old Curiosity Shop (novel) 1841\n\nAmerican Notes for General Circulation (essays) 1842\n\nA Christmas Carol, in Prose: Being a Ghost Story of Christmas (novella) 1843\n\nThe Life and Adventures of Martin Chuzzlewit (novel) 1844\n\nThe Chimes: A Goblin Story of Some Bells That Rang an Old Year Out and a New Year In (novella) 1845\n\nThe Cricket on the Hearth: A Fairy Tale of Home (novella) 1846\n\nDealings with the Firm of Dombey and Son, Wholesale, Retail, and for Exportation (novel) 1848\n\nThe Haunted Man and the Ghost's Bargain: A Fancy for Christmas-Time (short stories) 1848\n\nThe Personal History of David Copperfield (novel) 1851\n\nThe Child's Story (short story) 1852\n\nA Child's History of England [originally published in three volumes] (history) 1852-1854\n\nBleak House (novel) 1853\n\nHard Times: For These Times (novel) 1854\n\nLittle Dorrit (novel) 1857\n\nA Tale of Two Cities (novel) 1859\n\nGreat Expectations (novel) 1861\n\nThe Uncommercial Traveller (short stories) 1861\n\nOur Mutual Friend (novel) 1865\n\nThe Magic Fish-Bone (short story) 1868\n\nThe Mystery of Edwin Drood (unfinished novel) 1870\n\nThe Life of Our Lord (short story) 1934\n\n*The first series was published in two volumes in 1836; the second series was published in 1837.

Now We Need to Help the Artful Dodgers.\" Washington Monthly 20, no. 11 (December 1988): 48-52.\n\n[In the following essay, Cooper considers the inspiration for and nature of Dickens's appeals for social reforms and the need for a similar voice to address current social problems.]\n\nChristmas is always the busy season for Dickens, but this year there's more going on than usual. There's a Bill Murray remake of A Christmas Carol (playing the perfect eighties Scrooge—a TV exec too busy to do lunch with his ghost) and, for the truly sturdy, a two-part, six-hour film of Little Dorrit. Coming soon: Disney's Oliver Twist. And a new biography of Dickens is getting prominent reviews, including front-page billing in The Washington Post Book World.\n\nBut what's been missing from the articles I've read about these works is the recognition of Dickens's central accomplishment: he prodded (and entertained) millions of readers into caring about the poor. Instead of seeing the poor, as Malthus did, as some abstract, seething mass of \"surplus population,\" Dickens saw them as individuals, engaging enough to merit novels of 700, 800, 900 pages. He made his readers see them that way too. And that was a revolutionary accomplishment,\n\nOne indication of his influence lies in numbers. He was the best-selling author in Victorian England, writing novels that became standard household items, as common as candles and brooms. In the 12 years after he died, nearly four million copies of his books sold in Britain alone—an amazing feat even by Stephen King standards. When it came to influence, Daniel Webster argued that Dickens had \"done more to ameliorate the condition of the English poor than all the statesmen Great Britain had sent into Parliament.\" Even the conservative Economist conceded that Dickens fueled \"the age's passion—we call it so designedly—which prevails to improve the condition of the working classes.\" Queen Victoria hailed his humanizing influence on the nation and his \"strongest sympathy with the poorer classes.\"\n\nAs for the poor themselves, they not only saw Dickens as their champion, they read him. Journals of the period are filled with accounts of chimney sweeps and factory hands captured by his work. And when they couldn't make out all the words, there were plenty of illustrations to help them along. The working classes responded by deluging Dickens with invitations to speak before their guilds. \"Ah! Mr. Dickens,\" shouted a carriage driver to Dickens's son, on the day of the novelist's funeral. \"Your father's death was a great loss to all of us—and we cabbies were in hopes that he would be doing something to help us.\"\n\nIt was not without reason, then, that Dostoevski called Dickens \"the great Christian.\"' Characters like Oliver Twist and Mr. Bumble, who ran the infamous workhouse, carry lessons as old as the New Testament. When Mr. Bumble terrorized Oliver for asking for a second helping of gruel, even affluent Englishmen knew how the orphan felt. They knew, too, that they had an obligation to help. That kind of empathy stoked the era's major reform movements. The resulting bouquet of triumphs included everything from fewer working hours to free education and universal suffrage.\n\nThere's more to Dickens, though, than misty-eyed sentiment. His was a subtle and muscular vision that recognized (and condemned) the sins of impoverished individuals as well as the collective guilt of a society. Dickens gives us not only Oliver Twist but Fagin, the criminal ringleader who pressgangs Oliver into service. He's no victim of society. Fagin's problem is Fagin.\n\nIs there any relevance in this today? After all, the sprawling squalor of Victorian Britain has gone the way of the workhouse. The laissez-faire liberalism that Dickens deplored is light-years away from today's social welfare state. (No food stamps had Oliver. No case-worker.) But America today is in at least one way like the England of the 1830s: most of us see the underclass as a seething, abstract mob. Of course, it's not just our artists who've failed us, but our politicans too. And it's too much to expect all art to serve as social glue, binding each of us to the concerns of the less fortunate. But today, when so much fiction is either mired in minimalist ennui or panting with the lifestyles of the rich and promiscuous, we need someone who can animate our social concern. We need a new Dickens.\n\nA Street-Walking Man\n\nWhere to find one? My guess is that it can only be someone who has seen poverty up close; perhaps a journalist. Dickens himself became acquainted with the poor as what today's social scientists would call a \"participant observer.\" He was one of them.\n\nHis father, John Dickens, tried to give his children a life of parlours and singing lessons on the paycheck of a navy clerk. As a result, like so many working people of the time, the Dickens family floated in and 'out of debtors' prison (bringing their servant with them, as was the custom of the day). By 1822, when Charles was ten, debt's constant tug forced his family to yank him out of school and place him in a factory pasting labels on pots of shoe polish. When not at work, he spent long days wandering the alleys of work-weary London. With his parents often imprisoned, describing what he saw there became a way of mastering a hostile world. He'd jot down dozens of \"sketches,\" detailed descriptions of just about anything he'd run into. They captured not only turmoil and toil, but character Typical was the one about his uncle's Soho barber, a man who, playing Monday-morning quarterback, recounted how he would have guided Napoleon's troops at Waterloo.\n\nEventually his family earned its freedom and Dickens became a law clerk, allowing him to tame \"the savagery of stenography,\" as he put it, and later become a reporter. At the time, reporting mostly meant taking shorthand, but Dickens was so talented an editor called him \"the most rapid, the most accurate, and the most trustworthy reporter then engaged on the London press.\"\n\nHis star rising, Dickens didn't leave the poor behind. Instead he sketched them. Under the pseudonym \"Boz,\" he churned out copy about vulgar vendors, ragged children, raging arguments. In \"The Pawn-broker's Shop,\" Dickens presented his comfortable readers with a prostitute: \"the lowest of the low; dirty, unbonneted, flaunting and slovenly.\" In his \"Visit to Newgate,\" he took them inside a prison that housed children. \"Fourteen terrible little faces we never beheld.—There was not one redeeming feature among them—not a glance of honesty—not a wink expressive of anything but the gallows and the hulks, in the whole collection.\"\n\nThis kind of firsthand experience became central to Dickens's fiction. To write Hard Times, for instance, he traveled to the north to cover a workers' strike. He was no sit-in-the-study author. After writing in the mornings Dickens would take afternoon walks of ten miles or more that returned him to the streets that powered his prose.\n\nObviously it wasn't just the reporting that made Dickens Dickens. It takes a little more than stenography, and a lot of something called imagination, to spin a 900-page novel. But Dickens's immersion in street life made his novels richer. When a barrister picked up Dickens's work, he saw his servants and his slums. He saw his London.\n\nThe stenographer's eye and the novelist's mind gave Dickens the ability—virtually unprecedented—to make the poor seem real. As Gertrude Himmelfarb explains in The Idea of Poverty, this was a time when servants were invisible, even to their masters. When a contemporary critic hailed Dickens's talent for making a \"washerwoman as interesting as a duchess,\" it was a tribute not only to Dickens's wonderful prose, but to his new vision.\n\nAfter all, one of the main characters in his first lengthy work of fiction, the serial Pickwick Papers, is Sam Weller, a servant. He not only fails to remain invisible; more often than not he seems a good deal wiser than his master. When he first signs on as Pick-wick's valet, the negotiations turn into a \"Who's-on-first?\" routine that sounds like Weller is hiring Pickwick. Weller still seems in control when Pickwick checks into an inn. After Pickwick stumbles into the wrong bedroom, only to be kicked out by a very unhappy woman, it's Weller who rescues him and guides him to his room. \"You rather want somebody to look after you, sir when your judgement goes out a wistin',\" Weller chirps. The servant's introduction in the serial's fourth issue sent sales surging.\n\nIn his next book, Oliver Twist, and throughout the other novels he was to write until his death in 1870, Dickens stuck to the simple proposition that no class had a monopoly on smarts or morality or decency or humor. This was a revolutionary creed at a time when the affluent saw the poor as a mob—to be feared or appeased, perhaps, but definitely not to be considered as individuals. And the rich were scarcely alone in their class-bound vision. As Dickens was spinning novels, the history of the working class in Manchester was being written by a German emigre named Friedrich Engels.\n\nThe idea of Jacobin-style revolution haunted Dickens, who poured his fears into prose in A Tale of Two Cities. In our century of failed revolutions, there's no more haunting or timely image than Dickens's Madame Defarge, knitting by the guillotine. He recognized that, just as the poor weren't all good, the rich weren't all bad. His pages brim with venal landlords, nasty bankers, and callous captains of industry; but good-guy capitalists pop up too. A product of the streets himself, Dickens saw no romance in revolution. It's not the proletariat who overthrew Scrooge, but his conscience.\n\nIf Dickens feared revolution, he didn't fall into the opposite trap of forgetting why mobs charged the barricades. He understood that the capitalist society was rife with institutions that kept the poor down. The villains of Hard Times aren't just bad apples, but overlords of a cruel factory system, dehumanizing in the monotony of its work. The tragedies of Bleak House, one of his last and gloomiest books, are found in the systematic injustice of the courts. By challenging these institutions, he made the lawyer or factory owner see that they shared responsibility.\n\nThe Idea of Poverty\n\nAnd when Dickens trained his guns, liberals weren't exempt. The workhouse that Dickens took on in Oliver Twist was one of the most prominent liberal programs of his day. Today it's hard to think of the book's cruel overseers as being progressive. But the Poor Law of 1834 was considered a great liberal victory, one that would segregate the indebted poor and prevent them from dragging their fiscally responsible neighbors into the red. (Talk about the unintended consequences of liberal reform.) When Oliver meekly seeks a double dose of gruel, we see unbridled cruelty. \"Enlightened\" Victorians saw themselves.\n\nAnd what they saw was folly. Consider the way that Mr. Bumble—who runs the \"progressive\" workhouse—understands Oliver's revolt.\n\n\"It's meat.\"\n\n\"What?\" exclaimed Mrs. Sowerberry.\n\n\"Meat, ma'am, meat,\" replied Bumble, with stern emphasis. \"You've over-fed him, ma'am. You've raised a artificial soul and spirit in him, ma'am, unbecoming a person in his condition.\"\n\nThe humor of the scene helps carry its meaning. Had Dickens's criticisms been heavy-handed, as Steven Marcus points out, middle-class readers wouldn't have touched his works. Instead of promoting a specific alternative to the workhouse, he satirized it, appealing to his readers' Christian charity. A second key to Dickens's success is his choice of the symbol of the good child, in Oliver Twist or Little Dorrit or David Copperfield. He tapped the well-springs of protectiveness that cultures can be made to feel for the young. Martin Luther King put that same insight into action when Birmingham school children stared down firehoses and police dogs, leaving us with one of the most arresting images of the civil rights movement.\n\nBut even as he skewered institutions, Dickens understood that the poor were often in the wrong themselves. If anything, there's a schism in his writing, dividing what you might call, for lack of better terms, the worthy poor from the unworthy between those who merit our admiration and those who don't.\n\nWinning hands down in the Worthy Category, family division, are the Christmas Carol 's Cratchits. It's not just their \"conditions\" that make them sympathetic—the fact that they're poor or that Bob Cratchit has a boss like Scrooge or that Tiny Tim needs crutches. It's the family's own nobility that lends the story such power, remake after remake. One clear signal to Victorian readers was the Cratchits' white-glove cleanliness—a paramount virtue at a time when filth was almost always followed by disease. The Cratchits were \"darned and brushed\" before the Christmas feast. After supper \"the cloth was cleared, the hearth swept.\" In the Cratchits, like Oliver Twist or David Copperfield or Little Dorrit, respectable British middle-class readers found an ideal of themselves.\n\nMeanwhile, a first in Unworthiness might go to the brickmakers of Bleak House, who seem like something out of a documentary on battered wives. We spy them when Mrs. Piggle happens by. \"An't my place dirty? Yes, it is dirty—it's nat'rally dirty, and it's nat'rally onwholesome,\" boasts the father. 'And we've had five dirty and onwholesome children, as is all dead infants, and so much the better for them.… And how did my wife get that black eye? Why, I giv' it her; and if she says I didn't she's a Lie!\" Today, when many liberals still romanticize the poor, Dickens's ability to distinguish poverty from nobility is well worth remembering.\n\nDickens understood that there were good and bad individuals within every class. But he rarely saw the individuals who were a mixture of good and bad. His heroes and heroines don't whine, don't curse, and even though they're raised in the company of foulmouthed, cockney villains, they speak the King's English. To be sure, his supporting cast could include people like the Peggottys in David Copperfield who were not so well spoken. But they too were practically flawless. This strict division between the worthy and the unworthy poor is more than an aesthetic flaw. It limits Dickens's relevance today.\n\nDickens makes his readers want to help the deserving poor. And, indeed, the Victorian (and New Deal) reforms that were, in part, inspired by Dickens focused on these able-to-help-themselves characters. Kids who'd be okay if child labor was abolished; workers who'd prosper with a union. This is the story of America through the 1950s: the New Deal and rising prosperity catapult the \"worthy\" poor into the middle class. Oliver goes to Levittown.\n\nThis left behind an underclass that seemed short on lovable Cratchits and long on pregnant teens, drug addicts, and gang members. What we don't have is the popular literature that will jar the affluent into caring about these less savory characters. We don't have the literature that will condemn their faults and recognize that these are people who can be helped. When I worked in a Big Brothers program in New York City, I remember noticing that there was no novel or film that got at the downright weird complexities of those tenements I visited on 102nd Street. I couldn't point to any book that explained how those kids could be such utter failures in school, unable at age 15 to write a single sentence, and still be as sharp and savvy and as alert as any kids I had known growing up in the New Jersey suburbs. There was no film that I could tell my friends about that captured the complexity of those mothers I would meet who'd blow much of their money on VCRs, and HBO, but who were also selfless when it came to helping their kids. There was—and still is—no writer who combines great talent and great popularity and who captures that bizarre marriage of sin and decency I saw in those tenement families.\n\nThe Dickens character who most reflects our dilemma is the Artful Dodger, the young pickpocket who befriends Oliver Twist. He's engaging to be sure. The first thing we see him do is take Oliver drinking; by the end, he's in court, trying to sweettalk a magistrate into pardoning him. But he's a side dish. We never understand or care about him the way we care about Oliver. The next Dickens needs to put us not in our Olivers' shoes, but in those of our own Artful Dodgers.\n\nWhile a new Dickens couldn't cure poverty, he could inspire personal commitment from the middle class. I don't mean the anesthesia of paying for yet another government program, but involvement. And that takes understanding. Public health care won't improve unless talented doctors and nurses want to choose Harlems over Humans, at least for a few years. We won't really become a kinder, gentler nation unless our leaders know something that's true about those on the bottom. But working with or for the poor requires inspiration; it doesn't come naturally. Individuals disappoint. Projects collapse. Easier lives beckon. Great art, as opposed to Brookings reports, can be the spur we need.\n\nIn 1945 Lionel Trilling lamented that no writer in his day had done what many of the leading Victorian writers had done—combine great literature and social concern. \"In three-four decades, the liberal progressive has not produced a single writer that itself respects and reads with interest. A list of writers in our time shows that liberal progressivism was a matter of indifference to every writer of large mind—Proust, Joyce, Lawrence, Eliot, Mann, Kafka, Yeats.\" The absence of such a writer may have been a marginal loss in the middle of this century, when the politics of the time were liberal even if the great novelists were not or when poverty seemed like it could be erased simply through economic expansion and a few social reforms. Today when politicians are retreating from helping the poor and growth offers no panacea, we need another Dickens to inspire each of us to help.\n\nI don't know if there will be a single figure—be it a novelist or filmmaker or journalist—who can animate a nation's imagination the way Dickens did, or whether it may take a disparate group, or even an artistic movement. But I'm certain those Dickens-like qualities will not be had by some writer-in-residence strolling the hallowed halls of Haverford. The Dickens mantle demands a life outside the academy, exposed to the real world. It belongs to the writer who can make us care not only about our Tiny Tims but our Artful Dodgers, too.\n\nRobert Sirabian (essay date summer 1996)\n\nSOURCE: Sirabian, Robert. \"Dickens's Little Dorrit. \" Explicator 54, no. 4 (summer 1996): 216-20.\n\n[In the following essay, Sirabian comments on the character of Flora Finching, positing that she is more fully and deeply drawn than most of Dickens's female characters.]\n\nDickens's female characters traditionally have been divided into three types: evil (associated with passion or parental neglect); angelic (associated with the selfless devotion to domestic and maternal duties); and comic (associated with silliness). This type of division not only creates a limited conception of gender roles but also oversimplifies Dickens's attitudes toward his female characters and their relationships with men. When we first meet Flora Finching in Little Dorrit, she appears to be another of Dickens's stereotyped comic females; but as Michael Slater points out, \"the more we see (and hear) of Flora, and of the genuine kindness and shrewd common sense that lies beneath her foolish manner, the more we come to accept her as a complex and sympathetic human being\" (Slater 246). Flora's \"foolish manner\" is often interpreted as a mental deficiency, but a more careful examination of her character reveals that her capricious dialogues are part of her role-playing.\n\nA central preoccupation in Dickens's personal life, role-playing allows Flora the freedom to explore other selves that social convention and day-to-day duties prohibit. While some Dickensian role players, such as Rigaud, carry their play to extremes—withdrawing from society behind the Dionysian mask of play—Flora's role-playing is a creative means of self-discovery, of challenging her fixed identity as widow and caretaker of her husband's aunt. Rather than remaining trapped as an aging widow within the narrow confines of her father's house, she explores the meanings of selfhood, including possibilities for romantic relationships that still exist for her. Much like Jenny Wren's play world on the rooftop garden in Our Mutual Friend, Flora's play world, created through her role-playing, is an intermediate space linking her past, present, and future where she can—finally, by confronting Arthur—attempt to redefine her existence.\n\nFlora's socially fixed identity as a secluded widow and caretaker conflicts with the buried emotions of her past. Childhood sweethearts who had fallen in love, Flora and Arthur were forcibly separated by Mrs. Clennam and Flora's father because of religious and class differences. After marrying Mr. Finching and becoming his devoted wife until his death, Flora accepts her position as a quiet, self-sacrificing woman while looking after Mr. Finching's aunt. When she meets Arthur again, however, she reveals a different Flora who is trying to make sense of her personal history and find her place in the present. The freedom of role-playing results from her ability to lose herself in her play; yet unlike the schizophrenic, she is still conscious of the world around her. According to Eugen Fink, \"[Humans] exist in two spheres simultaneously, not for lack of concentration or out of forgetfulness, but because this double personality is essential to play\" (23). Flora's position becomes relational, encompassing not just her past but accounting for the present and future as well.\n\nWhen she meets Arthur in the novel, Flora recalls for him their past and the way in which they were abruptly separated. Constantly excusing her indulgences in the past and apologizing for addressing Arthur too informally (by his first name), she recreates herself before him, playing the role of a young lover who tries to rekindle the passion of her old companion. As she does this, Arthur notes Flora's joy in recollecting her past life, describing her ebullience as she acts out past roles. Arthur sees her \"putting herself and him in their old places, and going through all the old performances—now, when the stage was dusty, when the scenery was faded, when the youthful actors were dead, when the orchestra was empty, when the lights were out\" (Dickens 196-97; bk. 1, ch. 13). For Arthur, childhood is unrecoverable, faded like the scene of a performance that can never be replayed; and the emotions and feelings that he and Flora experienced are for practical purposes gone in his mind forever, destroyed by the harshness of the world over which, as children, they had no control. This is not the case with Flora. Although she accepts her duties as a devoted wife and as supporter of Mr. Finching's aunt, she negotiates the limits of a somber past with the possibilities of the present and future. Her acting out of scenes extends her past, like a continuous performance, into the present, allowing her to speculate about buried emotions of desire and love and to recreate her identity as a vibrant woman rather than a devoted caretaker. The play Flora actively engages in allows her to resist the imposition of a dead present and a fixed role within it. Whereas Arthur views their places in society as prescribed and unchangeable, Flora searches for possibilities through play.\n\nFlora's continual self-corrections for \"inadvertently\" referring to Arthur by his first name rather than using a formal salutation are part of her role-playing, her attempt to revive his feelings and thoughts in order to understand her own. She does not wish to be recognized by Arthur as Mr. Finching's widow or the provider for his aunt, and Flora's continual self-deprecation about her status is her way of undercutting his polite affirmation of her life. In discussing the concept of imitation in play, Hans-Georg Gadamer observes that a child does not dress up in order to be discovered behind a disguise, but rather \"intends that what he [or she] represents should exist, and if something is to be guessed, then this is it\" (102). Assuming the role of a chattering, playful woman, Flora wants Arthur to see what she represents in the present, but she is not hiding behind a disguise nor is her imitation an end in itself. The dynamics of her play become clear when upon her tetea-tete with Arthur at the counting house in Bleeding Heart Yard, he prepares for the intrusion of her father and Mr. Pancks:\n\nOnce more he [Arthur] put his hand frankly to poor Flora; once more poor Flora couldn't accept it frankly, found it worth nothing openly, must make the old intrigue and mystery of it. As much to her own enjoyment as to his dismay, she covered it with a corner of her shawl as she took it … and seeing two figures approaching, she cried with infinite relish, \"Papa! Hush, Arthur, for Mercy's sake!\" and tottered back to her chair with an amazing imitation of being in danger of swooning, in the dread surprise and maidenly flutter of her spirits.\n\n(318: bk. 1, ch. 24)\n\nFlora's audience is not only Arthur. Playing for her own enjoyment, she delights in acting out roles of the childhood lover and flustered maiden and in distressing Arthur, whose inability to play has deadened him. Her purpose, however, is not simply to imitate a character type but to create a new self composed of unexpressed feelings from the past—feelings whose absence continually redefines her present—and of imaginative possibilities she projects. Rather than a serious, externally driven activity, play, for Flora, is internally driven, a creative exploration of selfhood. Her role-playing is not simple fantasy but rather a mediation of genuine feelings and desires based on an established past and a projected, imaginative present and future.\n\nFlora's exploration of identity is underscored by her language, which is constructed of disjointed clauses linked together with conjunctions and commas. An absence of any perceivable structure to her syntax or of expected grammatical markers makes her intended meaning difficult to grasp, thus characterizing her as foolish or dimwitted. But this perception results because Flora's language, like her identity, resists set structures which would rigidly fix it within social and cultural conventions. Her language is structured around its play of ideas rather than by conventional transitional and grammatical markers. Fred Kaplan notes that both Joyce's Molly Bloom and Flora Finching are fascinated \"by the picturesque, by the promise and allure of a reality that will be far more intense than their present accommodations to rather ordinary lives: and in both the strategic use of the conjunction 'and' is basic to the impression of visionary, semiconscious continuity within their discontinuity of syntax and language\" (345).\n\nHer understanding of human nature reveals itself in Flora's intuitive and compassionate attitude toward Mr. Finching's aunt. She sees beneath the facade of the old, garrulous woman and responds to her spontaneous outbursts with patience and dignity. Whereas Arthur has no patience for the aunt and views her as an annoyance, Flora understands her. Flora recognizes that the aunt's sudden retorts at the world are her means of self-expression; but unlike her, Flora chooses not to close herself off from the world. The women represent two possibilities, one a retreat into the self and the other an exploration of the self. With Amy's marriage to Arthur, Flora must accept the \"closing scene\" between herself and Arthur. Although she sincerely wishes them well, she leaves the novel with an air of despondency. Her relationship with Arthur is resolved, but her future is still undetermined. Whether or not she experiences the romance of her youth again, she will not, like Mr. Finching's aunt, become withdrawn from the world. Flora is one of Dickens's women characters who is realized as a complex human being rather than serving as a comic type, or as an example of dutiful womanhood, such as Agnes Wickfield in David Copperfield. Resisting the resolution of Victorian closure, Flora remains within the realm of play, reenacting the faded scenes of her past as she explores and redefines her identity beyond the confines of Dickens's novel.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nDickens.

Dickens's skill in narration, description, multiplot structure, and imagery merit our scrupulous attention. Works including Oliver Twist (1838), A Christmas Carol (1843), David Copperfield (1850), and Hard Times (1854) present a Dickens who is progressive in his treatment of children, the poor, and education. The meanspiritedness of Scrooge's outrage when refusing to provide for the destitute still stings: \"'Are there no prisons?'… 'And the Union workhouses?' … 'Are they still in operation?'\" (25). Thomas Gradgrind's opening lines of Hard Times —\"'Now, what I want is, Facts. Teach these boys and girls nothing but Facts. Facts alone are wanted in life. Plant nothing else, and root out everything else'\" (47)—indelibly implant the importance of progressive education. Noteworthy also is Dickens's awareness of the victimization of women by villainous men, whom he created in the likes of the vicious robber Bill Sikes of Oliver Twist and the repulsive, menacing dwarf, Daniel Quilp, of The Old Curiosity Shop (1841). Women's connection to violence becomes more perturbing and timely when we consider Dickens's portrayals of women berating and even disfiguring other women within the perimeter of his novels. However, Dickens's depictions of women in these and other of his works seem startling lacking and thoroughly steeped in the traditional views of his times.\n\nDifferent from contemporary women authors—particularly Charlotte Brontë, who offers spirited Jane of Jane Eyre (1847), or George Eliot, who provides spunky, strong-willed Maggie Tulliver of The Mill on the Floss (1860)—Dickens idealizes the angelic woman. As Patricia Ingham and Merryn Williams note, respectively, in Dickens, Women, & Language (1992) and Women in the English Novel, 1800-1900 (1984), Dickens's female characters fit easily into categorized types. Any fictional type, or composite of characteristics, when imposed on a character by an author, may well reinforce and reflect not only the beliefs of the author but prevailing cultural assumptions, in this case surrounding gender. Drawing examples from text and illustration, I group Dickensian women into three types that resonate in Victorian literature: angels, fallen sisters, and eccentrics. My categories differ from Ingham's and Williams's and do not intend to be comprehensive.1 If we evaluate these models of womanhood according to the Victorian society which fostered as well as criticized them, we can better understand why each leaves modern readers dissatisfied. All three types of Dickensian women pose problems for late-twentieth-century readers in search of a viable Dickensian heroine. While still not satisfying to modern readers, the eccentric woman emerges as the most intriguing of the Dickensian types, revealing an inversion in values of Victorian culture and today.\n\nAgnes Wickfield of David Copperfield, Dickens's favorite novel, ideally represents the Victorian angel in the house. She epitomizes Dickens's ideal woman, a rich reward for every man as well as for David, his fictionalized self and most beloved character. The Dickensian angel demonstrates a model of womanhood, exceedingly popular in the 1840s and 50s, that seems too saccharine, self-effacing, and domestic to a late-twentieth-century readership. Often associated with the stained glass windows of a church, Agnes is ever pointing David upward to higher things. Acting as surrogate wife to her rapidly deteriorating father and sister to David, Agnes embodies the qualities of the angel in the house, immortalized in Coventry Patmore's sequence of poems The Angel in the House (1854-63): patience, unselfishness, earnestness, faithfulness, and devotion.\n\nAgnes and those Dickensian angels who stand behind her also match George Elgar Hicks's depiction of the prototype in Woman's Mission: Companion to Manhood (1863). Hicks designed this canvas as part of a trilogy to illustrate three phases of a woman's duties of ministering angel: tending her infant son, comforting her husband, and ministering to her father in old age.2 Dressed in a demure rich-brown taffeta gown ornamented with lace, Hicks's feminine, supportive, and devoted wife sympathetically ministers to her husband within the orderly haven she has created for him on earth. This now cloying narrative painting tells the story of a wife, who, as country singers might croon today, is \"standing by her man\" during his hour of trial; upon receiving news of a bereavement, he covers his face with his right hand to conceal his emotion. Hicks takes pains to show how neatly and carefully this loving and attentive wife, in fulfilling her mission as \"companion to manhood,\" has arranged the breakfast things including the morning mail, which carries a black-edged envelope, bringing her husband the devastating news of death.\n\nThe selfless Victorian angel approaches the divine on earth by functioning as the holy refuge for her brother, father, or husband, all of whom, in most cases, do not deserve her. Still, the angelic Dickensian woman offers unconditional love and support to her less moral male counterpart even if he unquestionably burdens her until he dies, as in the case of Lizzie Hexam of Our Mutual Friend (1865); scorns her, as Florence Dombey's father does in Dombey and Son (1848); and nearly ruins her life until he finally reforms, as in the case of Agnes Wickfield of David Copperfield. Dickens also ties the morality of ideal womanhood to hearth and home; Agnes creates a haven for Mr. Wickfield despite the fact that his love for his child, by his own admission, becomes \"'diseased'\" (708). Dickens takes pains to describe how Agnes \"set glasses for her father, and a decanter of port wine\" (195), or how \"Agnes made the tea, and presided over it\" (195). Rarely does Agnes venture from the home despite the taint imbued by the growing incompetence of her father. And the novel rewards her richly. The final lines pay a tribute to David's \"'good Angel'\" (312); David praises Agnes's \"Heavenly light\" (737), ever pointing him \"upward!\" until his own death, which he imagines in the final paragraph of the novel (737).\n\nYet, as Nina Auerbach notes in her harsh critique of Dickens's Agnes, David's good angel is an \"immobilized angel\" (84), an \"unmoved mover, pointing others upward though static herself\" (85). Along with the Victorians' beloved Little Nell Trent of The Old Curiosity Shop, Agnes has been received distastefully by readers today. Ever repressing her love for David until he finally confesses his love for her, Agnes remains steadfast to a father who succumbs to drink and loses the family business to despicable Uriah Heep, who moves into her home, sleeps in David's old room, and lusts after her. At what cost, today's readers cannot help but question, does Dickens ultimately grant Agnes a reward for her patience and goodness? Dickens does not consider this question. Likewise, the accompanying illustrations—often telling counter clues in nineteenth-century novels3—never even hint at Agnes's suffering. Hablot Knight Browne intensifies the Victorian image of the angel in the house that Dickens presents. He consistently pictures Agnes in passive roles that, we can imagine, might well have inwardly riled her: smiling among the guests at David's marriage to another woman in \"I Am Married,\" and sitting demurely as the slimy Uriah Heep lingers around her in \"Uriah Persists in Hovering Near Us, at the Dinner Party.\" Her composure in these images matches that in her final depiction, \"A Stranger Calls to See Me\", where she sits contentedly in the family parlor, surrounded by her husband and children. Agnes holds an open book on her lap, suggesting her role as moral teacher for her children as well as her beloved David, whom she ever points upward. Fittingly, the mantel contains a symmetrically placed pair of angel figurines.\n\nAgnes is but one of many Dickensian angels: Little Nell of The Old Curiosity Shop, Rose Maylie of Oliver Twist, Florence Dombey of Dombey and Son, Esther Summerson of Bleak House (1853), Lucie Manette of A Tale of Two Cities (1859), and Lizzie Hexam of Our Mutual Friend (1865) also appear to be Dickensian saints, to varying degrees. In Dickens's oeuvre, the fragile wax doll, Dora Spenlow of David Copperfield par excellence, typically withers away while Dickens frees and thus rewards the stronger angelic woman when her male counterpart reforms or dies. But such is not the case with Little Nell Trent, another early Dickensian angel whom Dickens ardently embraced. Like Agnes, Little Nell is burdened with the care of an aged parent, in this case, her grandfather, a gambler who, unlike Agnes's father, never reforms. Nothing is more drippingly poignant, albeit maudlin by today's standards, than Dickens's narration of Little Nell's death; her fate was so grave a matter of public concern in 1841 that throngs of Americans lined the pier in New York City awaiting the final installment, shouting out to the crew to learn the answer even before the boat from England reached the shore. Dickens writes of her death in a manner that supposedly brought Thomas Carlyle to tears: \"No sleep so beautiful and calm, so free from trace of pain, so fair to look upon. She seemed a creature fresh from the hand of God, and waiting for the breath of life; not one who had lived and suffered death\" (652). George Cattermole, in his illustration of \"Little Nell Dead,\" emphasizes Nell's \"freshness,\" beauty, and calm that seemingly transcends her saintly death.\n\nUnlike Agnes, Nell becomes a homeless angel for much of the novel. Still, in true angelic fashion, she remains strong and purposeful throughout her pilgrimage plagued by disaster until the final third of the novel when her strength gives way.4 In this respect, another early Victorian angel, Rose Maylie of Oliver Twist, offers an interesting counterpoint to Little Nell. Dickens burdens the ever sweet and good Rose Maylie with an unknown parentage and a fear of illegitimacy, much as he does Esther Summerson of Bleak House. Unlike Little Nell, however, Dickens spares Rose from a near-fatal illness and blesses her in marriage to the honorable Harry Maylie.5\n\nThe Dickensian angelic ideal persisted for two decades with Lucie Manette of A Tale of Two Cities (1859). Early in A Tale of Two Cities, we are introduced to a young lady with blue eyes and \"a quantity of golden hair\" (29), akin to George Eliot's Eppie of Silas Marner (1861). These qualities accentuate Lucie's angelic nature at a time when external beauty was readily linked to inner goodness. Lucie remains loyal and devoted to her father, Dr. Manette, freed from his cruel imprisonment in the Bastille. Before she marries Charles Evrémonde, called Darnay, Lucie professes to her father, \"'I am deeply happy in the love that Heaven has so blessed—my love for Charles, and Charles's love for me. But, if my life were not to be still consecrated to you, or if my marriage were so arranged as that it would part us, even by the length of a few of these streets, I should be more unhappy and self-reproachful now than I can tell you'\" (188). Ever an angel, golden-haired Lucy suffers the loss of a beloved son and, too, \"stands by her man\" as he faces sure death by the Parisian guillotine for the sins of his Evrémonde forefathers.\n\nWilliams suggests that, as Dickens's career progressed, he grew aware that interest in his angelic heroines was dwindling. Perhaps that is why in his last two novels, Our Mutual Friend (1865) and the unfinished Edwin Drood, we see Dickens toying with the creation of a new type of woman more satisfactory to readers today (Williams 85-87). Lizzie Hexam departs from her angelic sisters in her courage despite her poverty as well as in her physical strength and responsibility. She is stalked by two dangerous men who are tortured in their love for her, as the 1998 PBS presentation of Our Mutual Friend so well conveys. When the self-destructive, rejected suitor, Bradley Headstone, attempts to murder his rival, Eugene Wrayburn, a careless and insolent barrister, Lizzie—\"as if possessed by supernatural spirit and strength\" (769)—heroically lifts Eugene's body from the river and saves him. Marcus Stone's compelling opening illustration entitled \"The Bird of Prey\" shows a progression in the angelic ideal: a steadfast, strong-looking, able Lizzie rows her father in a boat on the Thames. But in contrast, her final depiction tending the dying Eugene Wrayburn in \"Eugene's Bedside\" echoes the popular iconography of the good Samaritan. Stone transforms Lizzie into an angel, matching Browne's and Dickens's Agnes in softness and compassion and intensifying the still pervasive ideal of angelic Victorian womanhood. Even in her early characterization in the novel, Lizzie conforms to type in her devotion to her ungrateful brother Charley and her trying father Gaffer, a boatman who drags the Thames for corpses. As Lizzie Hexam selflessly declares, \"'The harder father is borne upon, the more he needs me to lean on'\" (113). Her tempered reward is marriage to Eugene Wrayburn, who reforms only after an extreme test.\n\nNot only angels but fallen women who transgress sexual norms abound in Dickensian fiction. David Copperfield contains both Emily Peggotty and Martha Endell, a fallen woman whom Hablot Knight Browne illustrates in \"The River,\" walking among the blackened sewage of the Thames. Browne's depiction of Martha reflects the cultural regard for the fallen woman. Billowing industrial smoke stacks form a fitting backdrop for the now sullied Martha, who contemplates taking her life by drowning herself in the polluted river.\n\nDickens often created minor characters who mirror the virtuous and the fallen; just as angelic Sophy Traddles accentuates Agnes Wickfield's goodness, Martha Endell underscores Emily Peggotty's fall. The chapter titles alone convey Dickens's scorn for Little Em'ly, who spurns the love of the honest Ham Peggotty to run off with James Steerforth, David's \"'bad Angel'\" (312), or so Agnes calls him. Chapter XXX, \"A Loss,\" describes the death of Peggotty's husband, Barkis, but Dickens entitles Chapter XXXI, chronicling Emily's fall and resulting disgrace, \"A Greater Loss.\" Dickens foreshadows the severity of Emily's fall twenty-eight chapters earlier when a reflective David, remembering how little Em'ly came dangerously close to falling into the sea, ponders: \"There has been a time since—I do not say it lasted long, but it has been—when I have asked myself the question, would it have been better for little Em'ly to have had the waters close above her head that morning in my sight; and when I have answered Yes, it would have been\" (39). Though David's judgment is severe, Daniel Peggotty devotes his life to Emily and saves her with the help of the fallen Martha and David. But there is no place for Emily or Martha in Dickens's Victorian world. Banishment to Australia becomes the punishment for sinning sexually, and Dickens denies Emily marriage, despite her offers. Of love, Emily sadly states, \"'that's gone for ever'\" (730). Dickens leaves Emily alive but perpetually penitent, spending her days teaching children, tending to the sick, and caring for her devoted uncle, her sexuality permanently sublimated in a bond of non-sexual love.\n\nOliver Twist provides a bleaker death for the fallen Nancy, Rose Maylie's saintly sister, whose depiction is compromised by George Cruikshank's inability to draw an attractive woman. The original chapter heading of \"Two Sister-Women\" makes explicit Nancy's and Rose's relative status of sister to each other and Oliver. Never waning is Dickens's regard for the saintly prostitute, who seemingly assuaged the consciences of his middle-class readers through her loyalty to and love for a middle-class child. When Dickens was working through the idea of making Rose Maylie Nancy's saintly counterpart,6 he was already saddled with Cruikshank's unconvincing interpretation of Nancy.7 In \"Oliver Claimed by His Affectionate Friends,\" a broad-nosed, wide-mouthed, squat-faced, slovenly Nancy grabs Oliver by the arm, much as vicious Sikes does. Dickens explains that Nancy carries \"a little basket and a street-door key in her hand\" (93) to appear respectable enough to pose as Oliver's sister, but these and her clean white apron in the illustration \"Oliver Claimed\" become costume props accentuating her dishonesty.\n\nIn Twist, as in Copperfield, we witness a bonding between the fallen woman and her angelic sister. Much as Agnes comforts Emily before she sails to Australia, Rose, likewise, tries to save Nancy by offering to help her find refuge in a safer world. But Nancy, remaining loyal to her robber lover, dies brutally at the hands of Bill Sikes. As Sikes strikes her down, Nancy holds Rose Maylie's own white handkerchief \"as high towards Heaven as her feeble strength would allow, [and] breathed one prayer for mercy to her Maker\" (303). A saintly Nancy exits the novel as Rose's double, bonded to her through their loyalty to and love for Oliver.\n\nThe relationship between the fallen woman and her angelic sister in both novels satisfies the contemporary feminist reader, who celebrates the bonds of sisterhood bridging angelic purity and fallen sexuality.8 The bonds are broken in both cases through banishment or death, a fate conforming to the standard treatment of the fallen woman. Dickens is not alone in punishing the fallen woman, but in David's refusal to see or touch Emily after she sins sexually, we witness Dickens's judgment of the fallen woman, which is harsher than that of Elizabeth Gaskell, George Eliot, and Thomas Hardy. All these writers who sympathetically present the fallen woman in fiction were well aware that an element of Victorian society did not allow for a distinction between a prostitute and a young woman who made one mistake. In her controversial Ruth (1853), Gaskell gives Ruth Hilton a second chance after her disgrace and allows her illegitimate child—proof of her fall—to live; although ultimately punished by death, Ruth dies as a good Samaritan, her illness resulting from nursing the very man who seduced her. Hardy and Eliot compound illicit sexuality with murder in Tess of the D'Urbervilles (1891) and Adam Bede (1859), respectively. Killing her seducer, Hardy's Tess Durbeyfield hangs, and Eliot's Hetty Sorrel—guilty of infanticide—escapes the gallows but dies years later in transportation after long suffering. Through Dickens's Nancy, more than Emily, we see Dickens challenging what critic George Watt refers to as the dichotomy of two classes of women,9 which persisted throughout the nineteenth century—the virtuous and the fallen. Dickens suggests that Nancy, with a kind benefactor, might have been a Rose Maylie. Nonetheless, punishment for both erring women is swift and unalterable, aggrandizing the view of the fallen woman in Victorian culture, replete with sternness and Christian morality.\n\nToday, Dickens's fallen women appear as victims of a now dated and easily discarded sexual and moral code sacrosanct to the Victorians and to an extent upheld by Dickens himself. Also dated, Dickens's angels may well bore modern readers, some of whom find their saccharine natures distasteful. However, Dickens's gallery of eccentric women proves more interesting to a late-twentieth-century readership. I place in this category \"redundant\" women and those widowed or perceived as celibate, as in the case of Betsey Trotwood. Although Madame Defarge of A Tale of Two Cities is married, she, too, belongs in this group alongside the beautiful though scarred Rosa Dartle of David Copperfield, for both characters exude a terrible rage that ultimately consumes them.10\n\nYoungest sister of the peasant family grossly injured by the wealthy Evrémondes, Madame Defarge seemingly has no heart and so anticipates the creation of Estella of Great Expectations (1861). Michael Slater suggests that in the character of Madame Defarge, \"Woman's apparently endless capacity for devotion to those she loves is made to turn into devotion to revenge, devotion not to life but to death, and she becomes then fearful indeed\" (355-56). The ferocity of Madame Defarge's knitting throughout the novel—and her very act of knitting the names of those to be executed when the revolution falls—undercuts the gendered connotation of hand work, turning Thérèse Defarge into a fearful and deadly character. In \"The Wine-Shop,\" Hablot Knight Browne depicts Madame Defarge as a beautiful though harsh and brooding woman consumed by her knitting. Noteworthy is the way Browne exerts his artistic influence in the depiction of this excessive female who here averts eye contact with the spy who has entered their shop: he decidedly sharpens her mouth in this illustration and \"The Double Recognition.\" Late in the novel, Dickens justifies her hate: \"imbued from her childhood with a brooding sense of wrong, and an inveterate hatred of a class, opportunity had developed her into a tigress\" (353-54); but he continues more judgmentally about her: \"She was absolutely without pity. If she had ever had the virtue in her, it had quite gone out of her\" (354).\n\nMadame Defarge's harshness radiates most brilliantly when refusing Lucie Manette's plea for her imprisoned husband: \"'As a wife and mother,' cried Lucie, most earnestly, 'I implore you to have pity on me and not to exercise any power that you possess against my innocent husband, but to use it in his behalf. O sister-woman, think of me. As a wife and mother!'\" (266). In turn, Madame Defarge stares at Lucie \"coldly as ever\" (266). In spurning the triple entreaties of the Dickensian angel, who begs forgiveness as a wife, mother, and sister-woman, the unsisterly Defarge grows monstrous to her Victorian readers. Moreover, Dickens places this critical scene well before he divulges the real reason for her rage, which might have softened reader response. Defarge's cruelty to the angelic Lucie, an innocent of her own sex, contrasts sharply to the bonding that occurs between Dickens's angels and their fallen sisters, as the cases of Rose and Nancy and Agnes and Emily convey. Interestingly, Madame Defarge meets a brutal death in battle with another eccentric woman, Miss Pross, Lucie's devoted companion. Defarge disfigures Pross, who, though victorious, emerges with her hair torn, her face bearing the deep marks of Defarge's \"griping fingers\" (361). To ensure her cherished Lucie's escape from Paris (along with her father, husband, and child), Miss Pross acts with more ferocity than the \"tigress\" and defeats Defarge; as Dickens concludes, \"the vigorous tenacity of love, [is] always so much stronger than hate\" (360).\n\nLike Madame Defarge, Rosa Dartle has a reason for her rage. On first meeting Rosa, David cannot help but linger on the scar that disfigures her beautiful face; Steerforth caused this injury, which becomes an ever constant reminder of her tormented love for him. Upon the death of her father, Rosa becomes companion to her distant relation, the widowed Mrs. Steerforth, but she lusts after James Steerforth, who spurns her. Although Rosa stands demurely alongside the commanding Mrs. Steerforth in \"Mr. Peggotty and Mrs. Steerforth\" when Peggotty demands that Steerforth raise up the fallen Emily, Rosa's eyes glow darkly with anger. Interestingly, Browne makes her scar barely visible in this depiction, and we grow fascinated, rather, by her beauty and her outrage. From a late-twentieth-century vantage point, the consuming fire of passion that Rosa Dartle and Madame Defarge both exhibit offers modern readers more light than any Dickensian angel can shed.\n\nAs in A Tale of Two Cities, the eccentric Rosa spars with her sister-woman, in this case the fallen Emily, who becomes the object of Rosa's passionate rage. Ironically, however, Rosa gains no triumph in her fury during her long sought after confrontation with Emily, whom she refers to as \"'This piece of pollution'\" (605-06) and \"'James Steerforth's fancy'\" (604). In her rage, Dickens describes her as having \"a face of such malignity, so darkened and disfigured by passion\" (606). Akin to Madame Defarge's treatment of Lucie Manette, Rosa sneers at Emily's entreaties to a commonality of \"'our sex'\" (604) and declares \"'I would have this girl whipped to death'\" (606). When she strikes at Emily, however, her \"blow, which had no aim, fell upon the air\" (606). Much as he does with Little Em'ly, Dickens sublimates the sexuality of the attractive, yet disfigured Rosa Dartle, locking her away in a nonsexual bond with her aging, mourning companion, Mrs. Steerforth. David concludes: \"Thus I leave them; thus I always find them; thus they wear their time away, from year to year\" (735). Frozen in time like Miss Havisham, Mrs. Steerforth and Rosa Dartle live longing for the dead, unworthy Steerforth, who, after his deception with Emily, fascinates David no more.\n\nThe repugnancy of unrequited love in a woman, which Dickens scorns in Rosa Dartle, seems even more potent in the character of Miss Havisham of Great Expectations (1861).11 Time-frozen Miss Havisham appears as vengeful as Rosa Dartle and Madame Defarge. But she cannot easily be dismissed as \"the last figure in Dickens's work to illustrate the perversion of womanhood that can be brought about by the passions\" (293), as Michael Slater characterizes her. Miss Havisham, like her eccentric sisters, has a vengeance that burns in her as strongly as a tigress. Dickens gives her \"such a disagreeable laugh\" (122) and a repugnant plan to make Estella wreak her own revenge on men. He repeatedly points out that Miss Havisham takes \"malignant enjoyment\" (122) in torturing Pip with the unattainableness of Estella. However, Dickens creates moments of sympathy for Miss Havisham, such as when he divulges how she was tricked by her unworthy, dishonest lover. We cannot but marvel at Pip's fascination and constant devotion to Miss Havisham even after discovering his real benefactor. Almost like a character in a Grimm's fairy tale, Miss Havisham burrows herself away from the world and fascinates and haunts us as much as she does Pip, who risks his own life to rescue her from a fire. In her obsession with man-hating, more alluring to a feminist readership today than a Victorian one; in her ability to stop time—a fantasy many of us share in our fast-paced technological world; and in her financial independence, leaving her free from reliance on any male—Miss Havisham illustrates not a \"perversion of [angelic] womanhood,\" but an eccentric type of Dickensian woman who captivates modern readers and viewers, as Anne Bancroft's and Charlotte Rampling's recent performances in adaptations of Great Expectations reveal.\n\nAnother financially independent, eccentric woman, Betsey Trotwood of David Copperfield rants about donkeys and blatantly prefers girls. But, unlike Miss Havisham, Betsey Trotwood transforms before our eyes into a loyal, likeable character because of her nonconformity, as witnessed by her commitment to the crazed Mr. Dick and David. She at first rejects David for not being a girl and so foreshadows Miss Havisham's anger toward men in Great Expectations. However, she could also be considered an early feminist who tries to stop her young maids from marrying and, thus, repeating her own foolish mistake by wedding an unworthy man (whom she has the strength to desert but secretly supports). Betsey Trotwood takes David in, saves him from the murderous Murdstones, guides his education, and keeps him from \"forming\" Dora and, thus, not repeating the wrongs his stepfather committed against his fragile mother, Clara. Williams asserts that it is \"possible to argue that Betsey Trotwood is the real heroine of this novel\" (83), and so she may appear to some readers today. Dickens's Miss Betsey does not match the angelic heroines in grace and beauty, however, and has a firmness about her manner that frightens the fragile Clara Copperfield. Dickens describes Miss Betsey as a \"tall, hard-featured lady\" though he admits she is \"by no means ill-looking,\" that \"her features were rather handsome than otherwise, though unbending and austere\" (170). Likewise, Browne depicts the hardness in her features and not the handsome qualities, as \"The Momentous Interview\" conveys. Aunt Betsey's posture and facial features—particularly her hawk-like nose accentuated through profile—make her seem \"unbending and austere\" and manly. While her firmness reflects a strength of character necessary to confront David's would-be murderers and contrasts strongly with the kindly and humorous muse on Mr. Dick's face, only the painting of the good Samaritan adorning her drawing room wall speaks to the kinder nature of Aunt Betsey, who becomes David's true protectress.\n\nDo late-twentieth-century readers who admire Dickens's progressive agenda for reform in education and child labor prefer the eccentric type of woman who glows with a passion of revenge, even though, in many cases, Dickens scorns her as sexually unpleasing? While Dickens's eccentric characters might well fascinate modern readers, does this type, or any of his types, truly satisfy? The Miss Betseys, Madame Defarges, and Rosa Dartles are deficient in Dickens's eyes. Given Dickens's obsession with their oddities and failings as well their thwarted ventings of anger toward their fictional sisters, they cannot truly appear as heroines in the eyes of a feminist readership today.\n\nDo we pity the fallen sisters who end up befriended but banished or dead? While some might embrace them as victims of an arcane morality, might we concomitantly recognize residues of this same stern judgmental view within factions of our more progressive society today? Emily's fall is seemingly a result of what we now refer to as date rape. The punishments for Emily and Dickens's other fallen women, harsher than those meted by his contemporaries, lead us to question the sternness of their creator despite his active involvement in safe houses for prostitutes and his help in the emigration of many fallen sisters.\n\nAs Nina Auerbach notes in Woman and the Demon, \"We no longer adore angels; we do not even like them, dismissing them impatiently as soggy dilutions of human complexity\" (64). Dickens's angelic Agnes, steeped in repression of feeling, would likely not find her true love in today's world while Eliot's Maggie Tulliver, unburdened by the rigid codes of morality, and Brontë's Jane Eyre, already blessed with the ability to seek her true love, would surely thrive.\n\nRecent adaptations of Dickens's fiction, including Our Mutual Friend and Great Expectations, suggest that Dickens's novels with their multiplot structures, rich narration, and vivid description still intrigue readers today. But our \"great expectations\" are not met when it comes to Dickensian women. From a late-twentieth-century vantage point, Dickens's stereotypical presentations of angels, fallen sisters, and eccentric women regrettably leave us in search of a viable heroine.\n\nNotes\n\nIngham's categories in Dickens, Women, & Language include \"nubile girls,\" \"fallen girls,\" \"excessive females,\" \"passionate women,\" and \"true mothers.\" Williams's categories in Women in the English Novel, 1800-1900 include \"shrews,\" \"adventuresses,\" \"old maids,\" \"heroines,\" and \"new women.\"\n\nWoman's Mission: Companion to Manhood is located in the Tate Gallery. The two flanking panels (now lost) are entitled The Guide of Childhood and The Comfort of Old Age. Hicks wrote on the subject: \"I presume no woman will make up her mind to remain single, it is contrary to nature.\" The painting and this quote appear in Susan B. Casteras, Images of Victorian Womanhood in English Art, 50-52.\n\nConsider, for example, Thackeray's images for his self-illustrated Vanity Fair (1848). He refuses to condemn his \"heroine\" Becky Sharp of adultery or committing murder in the text, but, as author-illustrator, he twice draws her in compromising images playing the part of the murderess Clytemnestra.\n\nDickens writes further of Nell's death: \"When Death strikes down the innocent and young, … a hundred virtues rise, in shapes of mercy, charity, and love, to walk the world, and bless it. Of every tear that sorrowing mortals shed on such green graves, some good is born, some gentler nature comes\" (659). Whereas A Christmas Carol 's Scrooge repents, sparing the life of Tiny Tim, Nell's grandfather cannot be led away from temptation despite his pilgrimage, which Nell initiates when Quilp seizes his shop due to debt.\n\nLike other Dickensian angels, Rose's character seems flat and static. Her depiction suffers, in part, because of George Cruikshank's inability to draw an attractive women. In \"Rose Maylie and Oliver,\" a dignified, slender, and well-bred though inert and passive Rose rests a willowy hand gently on Oliver's shoulder. As pictured, she possesses Little Nell's inertness without her freshness. Her goodness in returning Oliver to his rightful home and family seems more richly rewarded in the text when Oliver exclaims: \"'Not aunt,'… 'I'll never call her aunt—sister, my own dear sister, that something taught my heart to love so dearly from the first! Rose, dear, darling Rose!\" (337).\n\nSee Dickens's letter of 1837 quoted in Oliver Twist, The Clarendon Dickens, xxxv-xxxvi.\n\nIn her introduction to Oliver Twist, The Clarendon Dickens, xxxvi, Kathleen Tillotson suggests Dickens would doubtlessly have criticized Cruikshank's portrayal of Nancy had he conceived the women as a pair sooner.\n\nFor another example of such a pairing, consider Esther Summerson and her true \"fallen\" mother Lady Dedlock of Bleak House. However, as Michael Slater notes in Dickens and Women (263), Lady Dedlock never laments like a fallen woman in true melodramatic fashion, as Emily Peggotty does. Such a connection also exists in other fallen woman fiction by George Eliot (e.g. Adam Bede) and Thomas Hardy (e.g. Tess of the D'Urbervilles).\n\nFor more discussion of this dichotomy of the virtuous and the fallen and the finality of the fall, see George Watt's \"Introduction\" in The Fallen Woman in the Nineteenth-Century English Novel, 1-10.\n\nBarbara Black pairs these Dickensian women with Miss Wade of Little Dorritt (1857) in an essay entitled \"A Sisterhood of Rage and Beauty: Dickens' Rosa Dartle, Miss Wade, and Madame Defarge\" published in Dickens Studies Annual 26 (1998): 91-106.

To say he took the country by storm is a gross understatement. Beatlemania, circa 1964, paled by comparison.\n\n\"There never was a king or emperor upon the earth so cheered and followed by the crowds, and entertained in public at splendid balls and dinners, and waited on by public bodies and deputations of all kinds,\" Dickens boasted in a letter to a friend. \"You cannot imagine what it is.\"\n\nIn 1842, \"Boz\" was a revered figure in this country. Regarded as far more than a wonderful storyteller, Dickens seemed to be the very voice of kindness, good humor and benevolence. Unlike other literary gentlemen, he gave struggling, unsophisticated people an even break—the kind of people America had in abundance, despite its astonishingly high literacy rate. Like the reformed Scrooge, Dickens seemed a man of whom it might have been said that he honored Christmas in his heart—its ideals of joy, familial love and unstinting dedication to the poor. Who would understand America better?\n\nHe came here expecting to adore the country as much as its people adored him.\n\nWhen he departed five months later, he was filled with loathing, and he poured his disgust into a book called American Notes, which I have finally gotten around to reading. (For some reason, despite perennial bouts of acute Carol poisoning, I am drawn to Dickens at Christmas time.)\n\nIt is interesting to follow a great writer, whose artistic genius is not unworthy of comparison to Shakespeare, making his way through some familiar haunts: from Boston, to Lowell, to Worcester, to Hartford (somehow missing Providence). But I can see how Americans of the 1840s were hurt and disappointed by American Notes. It is disheartening to find this writer of seemingly infinite broadmindedness, generosity and comic invention becoming increasingly smug, and small, and haughty, and even dull as he goes along. The Dickens sparkle is nowhere to be found in the book.\n\nNot that many of his criticisms of America do not ring true, even 160 years later.\n\nDickens, for example, was appalled by the barbaric manner in which rushed, bloated Americans wolfed down their food, later writing this scene into the novel Martin Chuzzlewit : \"All the knives and forks were working away at a rate that was quite alarming; very few words were spoken; and everybody seemed to eat his utmost in self-defense, as if a famine were expected.… Great heaps of indigestible matter melted away as ice before the sun.\"\n\nCould anyone who has visited McDonald's say we are all that different today?\n\nHe described Congress thusly: \"I saw in them, the wheels that move the meanest perversion of virtuous Political Machinery that the worst tools ever wrought. Despicable trickery at elections; underhanded tamperings with public officers; cowardly attacks upon opponents, with scurrilous newspapers for shields, and hired pens for daggers; shameful trucklings to mercenary knaves … in a word, Dishonest Faction in its most depraved and unblushing form, stared out from every corner of the crowded hall.\" As a reporter who covered Congress for years, and has seen it grow worse since, I can attest to the accuracy of that description.\n\nHe noticed that Americans talked of little but politics, especially of the presidency: \"The great constitutional feature of this institution being, that directly the acrimony of the last election is over, the acrimony of the next one begins.\" (Note that, hours after the long Bush-Gore struggle was settled last week, speculation about the 2004 run was already percolating.)\n\nHe was revolted by Americans' constant spitting—on streets, in restaurants, on parlor rugs (\"I can bear anything but filth,\" he said). He hated Americans' fondness for toasty heating, which in his view made rooms and railroad cars insufferably hot and stuffy. He was alarmed by their tendency to settle disputes with violence, and by their inordinate love of guns. He was offended by their overweening curiosity about strangers, and their boldness in asking questions, which he considered presumptuous and ill-mannered. He didn't like Americans' crude obsession with making money, and their willingness to get it by honest means or otherwise. After assiduously courting their admiration, he was offended by Americans' obsession with celebrity.\n\nHe found the slave states especially grim, pervaded by an atmosphere of \"decay and gloom.\" To slave owners who insisted it was in their own financial interest to treat their slaves well, he retorted: \"It is not in a man's interest to get drunk, or to steal, or to game, or to indulge in any other vice, but he did indulge in it for all that.\"\n\nBy the end of the trip, he was fulminating about the ugliness of pioneer cabins on the frontier. He thought the Mississippi River \"intolerable\" and \"slimy\" and trusted he would never see it again, \"saving in troubled dreams and nightmares.\" When he got to a great prairie, he saw only dreary flatness.\n\nMost of all, he detested the unbridled freedom of the American press, which he thought brought shame on American institutions and encouraged only unscrupulous men to seek office. But this hatred is the key to the whole book, I think, because the American press offended Dickens' fragile ego by criticizing him early on in the trip.\n\nIt happened when Dickens, rising to speak during lavish dinners in his honor, ripped into American publishers for printing \"pirated\" editions of British books without paying writers or owners of the material for the privilege. He was right, of course. But America was in the grip of a terrible depression. Prices for books had plunged, publishers had radically cut production or been forced into bankruptcy, and thousands of working printers had lost their jobs. Some in the press found it outrageous that a phenomenally rich author would complain bitterly at that moment, while being feted and worshipped, that he was not making more money. In his book, Dickens did not mention the controversy that so deeply wounded his feelings.\n\nAmerican Notes made Dickens money, but it harmed his reputation. The great British historian William Macauley refused to review it, calling it \"at once frivolous and dull.\" The prestigious Quarterly Review called it insipid, and denounced the \"arrogant selfishness\" of its author. On these shores, the reaction was worse. The mighty New York Herald said the book revealed a \"coarse, vulgar, impudent and superficial\" mind, and condemned the work as \"the essence of balderdash, reduced to the last drop of silliness and inanity.\" (Of course, some of this was the notorious touchiness of Americans to criticism of any kind. As Alexis de Tocqueville once noted, \"A stranger who injures American vanity, no matter how justly, must make up his mind to be a martyr.\")\n\nThe Beloved Boz had revealed himself to be distressingly human. For a time, Dickens was in disfavor. But only for a time. It is hard to stay mad at someone who could write David Copperfield, Bleak House, Hard Times, Great Expectations —and, of course, the incomparable, and incomparably loved, A Christmas Carol.\n\nFrancis Bennett (essay date November 2001)\n\nSOURCE: Bennett, Francis. \"City Versus Country in Great Expectations. \" English Review 12, no. 2 (November 2001): 8-12.\n\n[In the following essay, Bennett analyzes Dickens's differing attitudes toward rural and urban life.]\n\nDickens will forever be associated with depictions of city life, particularly of London. When his name is mentioned we immediately think of the criminal underworld of Oliver Twist and the urban settings of such novels as Nicholas Nickleby, Barnaby Rudge, The Old Curiosity Shop, Martin Chuzzlewit, Dombey and Son, Bleak House, Hard Times, Little Dorrit, A Tale of Two Cities. The list seems endless, and could lead to the conclusion that all Dickens ever wrote about was life in the city.\n\nBy 1850, 51% of the population of England was urban, as opposed to a mere 30% in 1801. Movement into towns was therefore a great social issue of the period. In his book Dickens and the City, [F. S.] Schwarzbach comments:\n\nWhat was the criminal underworld like in early Victorian London? Turn to Oliver Twist, we are told […] The accuracy and sheer inexhaustible scope of Dickens' observations of contemporary urban life alone make him the most important Victorian writer for such a study as this.\n\n(p. 79)\n\nHowever, it would be wrong to identify Dickens solely with the city. Great Expectations, for example, is divided almost equally between London and the Kentish countryside. In fact, contemporary critics responded to the novel 'almost unanimously by hailing it as a return to his earlier, Pickwickian style' (Schwarzbach, p. 184). And that earlier style incorporated a great deal of writing about places other than London.\n\nIn Great Expectations, Dickens attributes differing values to town and country life, but these values are essentially unstable. Put simplistically, Pip's views of the urban and the rural move from country = bad, town = good, to town = bad, country = a little better. It is this shifting evaluation, mirroring Pip's shifting evaluation of what it means to be a 'gentleman', which I shall concentrate on here.\n\nPip's Formative Years\n\nTo begin with, even ignoring Pip's first encounter with Magwitch on the marshes, life in the rural forge is far from idyllic. The early formative years of Pip's life are to leave him with one of the guiltiest consciences in literature (a Freudian critic would have a field day with this book). His guilt is formed by several key events, all of which take place in the supposedly tranquil rurality of Kent. After stealing food for the convict Magwitch, for instance, Pip is ravaged by guilt: All images are from the classic 1946 film, Great Expectations. Pip's rural upbringing (left and below) is far from idyllic.\n\nBut I ran no further than the house door, for there I ran head foremost into a party of soldiers with their muskets: one of whom held out a pair of handcuffs to me, saying, 'Here you are, look sharp, come on!'\n\n(p. 30)\n\nThe handcuffs are reminiscent of Magwitch's leg irons, and so (even though we know he has not really done anything terribly wrong) Pip thinks he too will be incarcerated for theft. The guilt association he has with the forge is further compounded by the injury inflicted upon his sister:\n\nWith my head full of George Barnwell, I was at first disposed to believe that I must have had some hand in the attack upon my sister.\n\n(p. 112)\n\nAll this adds up to a very uncomfortable depiction of rural life. From Pip's viewpoint, there are only negative associations with Kent. Even Joe, who is to be the true gentleman of the story, cannot prevent the loathing with which Pip comes to regard his rural origins. He develops a sense of snobbishness, and a keen sense of incongruity between Joe and his 'London self'. This division becomes developed well before he actually lives in London, and is enhanced every time he visits Miss Havisham, where he is deceived into thinking she will make him into a town gentleman.\n\nThe Attractions of Urban Life\n\nIt is very apt that Pip should refer to George Barnwell. This popular stage tragedy, subtitled 'The London Merchant', was first performed in London in 1731. Its apprentice hero becomes implicated in a crime, and suffers much regret and distress—just as Pip himself comes to do.\n\nYet in the early part of Great Expectations, Pip certainly does not anticipate that London will become a scene of tragedy or distress. On the contrary, he views urban life as positive and attractive, and believes his life will be better if only he can go to London and fulfil his great expectations:\n\nThey seemed in their dull manner, to wear a respectful air now, and to face round, in order that they might stare as long as possible at the possessor of such great expectations—farewell, monotonous acquaintances of my childhood, henceforth I was for London and greatness.\n\n(p. 137)\n\nLondon is coupled with greatness and destiny. It is not monotonous like Kent. It provides Pip with a way out. Where the country offers only regret, guilt and negative thoughts, the city provides him with the opportunity to better himself. Or so he thinks. Of course, Pip is not yet aware of the irony that this opportunity is founded on crime, much as George Barnwell's is. Equally, he has yet to learn that it is not the city that makes a 'gentleman'—whatever Dickens means by this term—and that the true gentle man, in the shape of Joe, is back in Kent.\n\nShades of the Prison-House\n\nSchwarzbach observes:\n\nIt is not long before we realise that the entire city is like the prison—both are places which systematically incarcerate and dehumanise their inhabitants.\n\n(p. 189)\n\nPip's first encounter with city life is with Smithfield Market, where he is surrounded by the 'filth and fat and blood and foam' (p. 152) associated with slaughter. This incident is juxtaposed with a visit to Newgate, where four men are waiting to be hanged. The reader therefore receives an image of the city as a place of death and danger; an image of which Pip is ignorant.\n\nIndeed, Pip seems blind to his surroundings. He is not dissuaded by his residence, which looks 'like a flat burying-ground' (p. 159) and of which Wemmick remarks so astutely, 'Ah! The retirement reminds you of the country' (p. 160). Instead, he looks only to his gentlemanly future. It is not until significantly later in the story that Pip begins to realise that the urban lifestyle and values are not so superior to the rural ones he has discarded. The realisation begins to dawn when his true guardian makes an appearance.\n\nThe Moment of Truth\n\nAll the truth of my position came flashing on me; and its disappointments, dangers, disgraces, consequences of all kinds, rushed in in such a multitude that I was borne down by them and had to struggle for every breath I drew.\n\n(p. 293)\n\nThis is the moment when all the dangers inherent in Pip's urban lifestyle and its method of acquisition suddenly dawn on him. This is the beginning of the end. Once tainted by his association to Magwitch, he can no longer perceive himself as being a true gentleman. Around every corner and under every stairwell is the prospect of incarceration: 'in every rage of wind and rush of rain, I heard pursuers' (p. 297).\n\nSuddenly, life back in the Kentish forge seems rather appealing. Of course, this final section of the book is where Dickens rather crudely draws up his moral conclusions. However, before Pip can become a good man, he needs reminding of the moral values he has lost in the hunt for his expectations—and Joe Gargery is the man for the job. On several occasions, Pip's conscience is pricked by Joe: 'I had not mistaken in my fancy that there was a simple dignity in him' (p. 207). But it is not until he has suffered the full horror of his London experience that he comes to see that maybe country values can be the values of a real gentleman:\n\nFor, the tenderness of Joe was so beautifully proportioned to my needs, that I was like a child in his hands. He would sir and t"
