        "text": "Remington, the area of Baltimore that Ghost Rivers weaves across, is an eclectic rowhouse neighborhood in city center. Remington traces its roots to the 19th century, when its stone quarries supplied the foundations for many of Baltimore’s buildings. Quarry and millworkers lived in this early streetcar suburb.\n\nIn the 1950s and ‘60s Remington became known as Little Appalachia, for the tight knit community of rural migrants who settled in the neighborhood. (Ghost Rivers Sites 8 and 9 focus on this history, including bluegrass pioneer Hazel Dickens, whose family lived nearby).\n\nAfter losing population during the downturn of the 1970s, 80s, and 90s, Remington began growing again in the early 2000s, as younger, diverse residents and new businesses have moved in.\n\nDestinations and landmarks directly adjacent to the Ghost Rivers trail include Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore Museum of Art, and the Olmsted-designed Wyman Park Dell.\n\nBefore Sumwalt Run’s ignoble turn as concrete culvert, it witnessed eras of Baltimore’s urban history. Its frozen waters appeared in ice boxes across the city, cut from the city’s first commercial ice pond and a later artificial ice factory. Trolley tracks crossed its ravine, bringing workers home from downtown factories. The Olmsted Company attempted to preserve part of the stream as a greenway, but real estate developers filled its valley (using debris from the Great Baltimore Fire of 1905, according to local lore). Ghost Rivers bring these hidden histories back to the surface, offering a glimpse into past and future city landscapes.\n\nLike ghosts, the buried streams still haunt our cities, contributing to downstream water pollution and flooding. Occasionally they burst to the surface, swallowing the ground and structures above in sinkholes.\n\nThere are stories of buildings in Baltimore getting six feet of water in the basement and then the water mysteriously receding. And it’s not because of a water main break – often it’s due to hidden waters that flow under foundations of old buildings and contribute to flooding issues in the city.\n\nGhost Rivers reveals the hidden history and path of Sumwalt Run, which now flows through underground culverts beneath Baltimore’s Remington and Charles Village neighborhoods.\n\nGhost Rivers started as a passion project for Willen during the early part of the pandemic, while exploring his neighborhood more deeply.\n\nThe research for Ghost Rivers involved substantial digging through public and private archives in Baltimore and beyond, and led to Maryland State Archives digitizing and preserving the original engineering plans for Baltimore’s sewer system, previously stored only on degrading 1950s-era microfilm.\n\nIn over two years of community engagement for Ghost Rivers, Willen has conversed with hundreds of residents about the project, held community history workshops, and presented at ongoing community meetings.\n\nHe worked closely with the Greater Remington Improvement Association (GRIA) on designing and carrying out a community engagement plan for the project, including one-on-one interviews that added the voices of longtime neighborhood residents.\n\nThe pale blue color of the artwork references the hues of waterways found in vintage maps, and the sinuous line suggests the iconography of flowing water. This color and form unites the Ghost Rivers installations across multiple sites, standing out among other roadway markings and a visually-crowded streetscape, to help visitors follow the project through the neighborhood.\n\nSculptural interpretive signs feature cut-out river shapes that help visitors “see” the lost creek, and a QR code that links viewers to additional content, imagery, and local resources related to each site and topic.\n\nThe project structure encourages exploration. Many visitors will first stumble upon one or two Ghost Rivers installations, with each site’s accompanying narrative working as a standalone vignette. As viewers visit multiple sites, these narratives link together to illuminate larger themes within social and natural landscapes.\n\nA project map on the signage, along with an interactive Google Map, help visitors to navigate between Ghost Rivers installation sites.\n\nA full-featured multimedia website – ghostrivers.com – enriches the context with photos, historic imagery, and action-oriented resources, serving as a digital companion for visitors and a way for people around the world to experience the project virtually."
