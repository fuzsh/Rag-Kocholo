        "text": "STAPLE INN\n\nStaple Inn with its lattice windows set back in all sorts of angled gables, must surely rate as one of the most exquisite relics of old London.\n\nIt dates from 1576, although it had to be pieced back together following considerable bomb damage in World War Two.\n\nIt is so named because it once provided London accommodation for wool-staplers or brokers.\n\n\"Behind the most ancient part of Holborn,\" wrote Dickens in his last and unfinished novel The Mystery of Edwin Drood (1870), \"...where certain gabled houses some centuries of age still stand looking on the public way...is a little nook...called Staple Inn. It is one of those nooks, the turning into which, out of the clashing street, imparts to the relieved pedestrian the sensation of having put cotton in his ears and velvet soles on his boots.\"\n\nWHERE SMOKY SPARROWS TWITTER IN SMOKY TREES\n\nSuddenly the rush and noise of modern London all but disappears. Huge Plane trees tower over you, and 18th or 19th century redbrick buildings surround you.\n\n\"It is one of those nooks,\" observed Dickens, \"where a few smoky sparrows twitter in smoky trees, as though they called to one another, \"let's play at country.\" Moreover it is one of those nooks which are legal nooks: and it contains a little Hall, with a little lantern in its roof...\"\n\nDespite the changes that have taken place in the area since Dickens's day his description still holds true today, and as you stand in this little slice of bygone London, you get the genuine sensation that you have literally stepped back in time!\n\nToday the buildings are used as offices by numerous actuaries, so it is a comforting thought that the people you catch glimpses of beavering away behind the ancient facades are working out such intriguing statistics as your chances of ending the walk without getting hit by a bus!\n\nTHE RESIDENCE OF MR GREWGIOUS\n\nIn The Mystery of Edwin Drood, this was the residence of the kindly lawyer Mr Hiram Grewgious, the guardian of Rosa Budd, Edwin Drood's fiancée.\n\nNotice the stone above the doorway which is inscribed 'PJT 1747.'\n\nDickens comments on this stone that Mr Grewgious had never \"troubled his head\" as to its meaning, \"...unless to bethink...that haply it might mean Perhaps John Thomas, or Perhaps Joe Tyler.\"\n\nWHERE PIP'S GREAT EXPECTATIONS BEGAN\n\nIt was here that Pip and Herbert Pocket had chambers in Great Expectations.\n\nThe fact that so many enclaves in this area are referred to as 'inns' when they are, in fact, places of business can be somewhat confusing.\n\nEvidently Dickens also found this a little perplexing, for he has Pip ruminate upon the fact when he first visits Barnard's Inn:-\n\n\"I had supposed that establishment to be an hotel kept by Mr Barnard...whereas I now found Barnard to be a disembodied spirit, or a fiction, and his inn the dingiest collection of shabby buildings ever squeezed together, in a rank corner, as a club for Tom-cats.\"\n\nEither Dickens was being a little harsh in his criticisms , or the area has changed considerably since his day, for today this really is a truly lovely spot and its well worth lingering a little to enjoy its secluded ambience.\n\nTHE DICKENS HOUSE\n\nThis has been re-named 'Dickens House' and it was here that the meditative law stationer Mr Snagsby lived and worked in Bleak House.\n\nMr Snagsby \"dealt in all sorts of blank forms of legal process, in skins and rolls of parchment, in paper - foolscap, brief, draft, brown, white, whitey-brown, and blotting; in stamps, office quills, pens, ink, India rubber, pounce, pins, pencils, sealing wax and wafers; in red tape and green ferret; in pocket books, almanacks, diaries and Law lists; in string, boxes, rulers, inkstands (glass and leaden), penknives, scissors, bodkins, and other office cutlery.' He was \"the high standard of comparison among neighbouring wives, a long way down Chancery Lane on both sides.'\n\nA BLACK EYE FOR YOUNG MASTER DICKENS\n\nOn his first day of working for Ellis and Blackmore, the then teenage Dickens, in a blue jacket and \"military-looking cap which had a strap under the chin\" met a \"big blackguard fellow\" in front of these gates.\n\nThe 'blackguard' knocked off his cap and said, \"Halloa, sojar,\" which, as Dickens later recounted, when he returned to the office sporting a black eye, \"I could not stand, so I at once struck him and he hit me in the eye.\"\n\nA FOGGY START TO BLEAK HOUSE\n\nImmediately the surroundings change to a delightful combination of dark brick and light stone buildings.\n\nThe redbrick building on the other side of the lawn is the Old Hall, dating back to 1489, and which - before the construction of the Law Courts on the Strand, was where the Lord Chancellor's Court met outside of legal terms.\n\nIt was here in \"Implacable November weather\" that Bleak House began with its vivid images of a London fog:-\n\n\"London. Michaelmas term lately over, and the Lord Chancellor sitting in Lincoln's Inn Hall. Implacable November weather. As much mud in the streets as if the waters had but newly retired from the face of the earth, and it would not be wonderful to meet a Megalosaurus, forty feet long or so, waddling like an elephantine lizard up Holborn Hill. Smoke lowering down from chimney-pots, making a soft black drizzle, with flakes of soot in it as big as full-grown snowflakes - gone into mourning, one might imagine, for the death of the sun. Dogs, undistinguishable in mire. Horses, scarcely better; splashed to their very blinkers. Foot passengers, jostling one another's umbrellas in a general infection of ill temper, and losing their foot-hold at street-corners, where tens of thousands of other foot passengers have been slipping and sliding since the day broke (if this day ever broke), adding new deposits to the crust upon crust of mud, sticking at those points tenaciously to the pavement, and accumulating at compound interest.\n\nFog everywhere. Fog up the river, where it flows among green aits and meadows; fog down the river, where it rolls defiled among the tiers of shipping and the waterside pollutions of a great (and dirty) city. Fog on the Essex marshes, fog on the Kentish heights. Fog creeping into the cabooses of collier-brigs; fog lying out on the yards and hovering in the rigging of great ships; fog drooping on the gunwales of barges and small boats. Fog in the eyes and throats of ancient Greenwich pensioners, wheezing by the firesides of their wards; fog in the stem and bowl of the afternoon pipe of the wrathful skipper, down in his close cabin; fog cruelly pinching the toes and fingers of his shivering little 'prentice boy on deck. Chance people on the bridges peeping over the parapets into a nether sky of fog, with fog all round them, as if they were up in a balloon and hanging in the misty clouds.\n\nGas looming through the fog in divers places in the streets, much as the sun may, from the spongey fields, be seen to loom by husbandman and ploughboy. Most of the shops lighted two hours before their time - as the gas seems to know, for it has a haggard and unwilling look.\n\nThe raw afternoon is rawest, and the dense fog is densest, and the muddy streets are muddiest near that leaden-headed old obstruction, appropriate ornament for the threshold of a leaden-headed old corporation, Temple Bar. And hard by Temple Bar, in Lincoln's Inn Hall, at the very heart of the fog, sits the Lord High Chancellor in his High Court of Chancery.\n\nNever can there come fog too thick, never can there come mud and mire too deep, to assort with the groping and floundering condition which this High Court of Chancery, most pestilent of hoary sinners, holds this day in the sight of heaven and earth.\"\n\nTHE UNDERCROFT OF LINCOLN's INN\n\nThe atmospheric cloisters date from 1623 and they make for a wonderful respite from the hustle and bustle of modern London. Indeed, such is the ambience of this lovely oasis, you could almost believe that you had somehow slipped back in time.\n\nIn Chapter Three of Bleak House, Esther Summerson arrives in Lincoln's Inn during a dense London fog and makes her way to Old Square, which is the square across which you have just walked.\n\nShe describes her journey here thus:-\n\n\"We drove slowly through the dirtiest and darkest streets that ever were seen in the world (I thought) and in such a distracting state of confusion that I wondered how the people kept their senses, until we passed into sudden quietude under an old gateway and drove on through a silent square until we came to an odd nook in a corner, where there was an entrance up a steep, broad flight of stairs, like an entrance to a church. And there really was a churchyard outside under some cloisters, for I saw the gravestones from the staircase window...\"\n\nThe graves to which Dickens alludes can be seen dotted across the flagstone floor of the cloisters.\n\nJOHN DONNE AT LINCOLN'S INN\n\nThe chapel's foundation stone was laid in 1620 by the metaphysical poet and divine John Donne (1571/2 - 1631).\n\nHe was actually the Inn's preacher between 1616 and 1622, and was persuaded to return to preach the first sermon in the chapel in 1623. So crowded was the chapel that 'two or three [of the congregation] were endangered and taken up for dead for the time, with the extreme press and thronging.'\n\nThe chapel interior possesses some fine Jacobean pews and some striking stained glass.\n\nWhenever a bencher (a member of the Inn's governing body) dies, the chapel bell is rung to mark their passing. It was the mourning knell tolled by this bell that is reputed to have inspired John Donne to write what is probably his most famous prose quotation, \"Never send to know for whom the bells tolls; it tolls for thee.\"\n\nTHE CASE OF JARNDYCE VERSUS JARNDYCE\n\nThis is where in Bleak House the legal suit of Jarndyce versus Jarndyce droned ever onwards, just as it had been doing for so long that no man alive could remember what it was originally about!\n\nDickens considered the Court of Chancery detestable and in Bleak House proffers the following warning:-\n\n\"This is the Court of Chancery; which has its decaying houses and blighted lands in every shire; which has its warn-out lunatic in every mad-house, and its dead in every churchyard; which has its ruined suitor, with his slipshod heels and threadbare dress, borrowing and begging through the round of every man's acquaintance; which gives to monied might the means abundantly of wearying out the right; which so exhausts finances, patience, courage, hope; so overthrows the brain and breaks the heart; that there is not an honourable man among its practitioners who would not give - who does not often give - the warning, \"Suffer any wrong that can be done you, rather than come here!\"\n\nMiss Flite, a possible heir in the Jarndyce vs. Jarndyce suit, and a character whose entire life revolves around the case, observes of this garden:- \"I call it my garden. It is quite a bower in the summer time\"\n\nThe curious little building of red brick and stone, that gives the appearance of being a mini fortress, is in fact the gardeners shed and is known in the inn as \"the head gardeners castle.\"\n\nI PREDICT A RIOT!\n\nIt was here in Barnaby Rudge that the Gordon Rioters gathered.\n\nTHE SIR JOHN SOANE MUSEUM\n\n13 Lincoln's Inn Fields.\n\nWednesdays to Sundays, 10am - 5pm. Last entry at 16.30\n\nAdmission: Free.\n\nWebsite\n\nSir John Soane (1753-1837), architect of the Bank of England and 10 Downing Street, reconstructed this house in 1792, and furnished it with a veritable treasure trove of all things beautiful, instructive and curious.\n\nBefore he died, he succeeded in obtaining an Act of Parliament, which ensured that the houses - he expanded next door when his collection outgrew the original premises! - and their contents would be preserved as a public museum.\n\nOf particular interest, from a Dickensian point of view, are the original paintings of William Hogarth' (1697-1764) The Rakes Progress and The Election Campaign. Hogarth was an astute observer and commentator on the social scene of 18th-century London.\n\nHe was a favourite artist of the young Dickens, whose early style was greatly influenced by the narrative manner of Hogarth's works.\n\nLater in life, Dickens commented on Hogarth's compassion and praised him for his awareness of \"the causes of drunkenness among the poor.\"\n\nLINDSEY HOUSE\n\nThis building dates back to 1641 and is known as Lindsey House, after its first owner, Robert Bertie, the first Earl of Lindsey.\n\nUnfortunately, his tenure here was cut short by his becoming Charles 1st's commander-in-chief, in which capacity he was killed at the battle of Edgehill in 1642, the first major skirmish of the English Civil War.\n\nA dark plaque on the wall commemorates Spencer Perceval (1762-1812) the only English Prime Minister to have been assassinated. He was gunned down in the lobby of the House of Commons by a Liverpool grocer named John Bellingham, a failed businessman from Liverpool who blamed Perceval for his financial difficulties.\n\nTHE FORMER HOME OF JOHN FORSTER\n\nThe next building along, comprising numbers 57 and 58, Lincoln's Inn Fields, dates from the 18th century, and the grand porch was designed by Sir John Soane.\n\nDickens friend, business adviser and primary biographer, John Forster (1812 -1865) lived at number 58.\n\nDickens based the character of Mr Podsnap in Our Mutual Friend (1864-65) on Forster.\n\nLater, he used this house as the residence for Mr Tulkinghorn - legal adviser to Sir Leicester Dedlock and evil blackmailer of his wife, Lady Dedlock - in Bleak House. Dickens was at his lawyer-bashing best when he wrote:-\n\n\"The crow flies straight across Chancery Lane...into Lincoln's Inn Fields. Here, in a large house, formerly a house of state, lives Mr Tulkinghorn. It is let off in sets of chambers now, and in these shrunken fragments of its greatness lawyers lie like maggots in nuts.\"\n\nDICKENS GIVES A READING\n\nOn the 2nd December 1844 Dickens, who had travelled especially from Italy - where he was living for a year - gave a private reading at Forster's house from his new Christmas story The Chimes.\n\nThe select gathering included, Forster, Thomas Carlyle, and Daniel Maclise.\n\n\"There was not a dry eye in the house,\" Maclise later wrote to Dickens wife, Catherine, who had remained in Italy. \"Shrieks of laughter - there were indeed - and floods of tears as a relief to them - I do not think that there ever was such a triumphant hour for Charles...\"\n\nMaclise also did a pencil sketch of the occasion, showing Dickens seated at the desk, the book open in front of him. Streaks of light radiate from him and he is surrounded by his enraptured audience.\n\nForster considered it an accurate depiction of the occasion, although he did comment that there was a touch of caricature of which he considered himself \"chief victim.\"\n\nA second reading two evenings later was equally successful, and thus were sown the seeds of Dickens foray into public readings from his works and, according to Forster, \"those readings to larger audiences by which, as much by his books, the world knew him in later life.\"\n\nTHE OLD CURIOSITY SHOP\n\nThis quaint little building long known as \"The Old Curiosity Shop\" dates from 1567 and was reputedly built from old ship timbers.\n\nThe legend, \"Immortalized by Charles Dickens\", emblazoned on its wall is a bit of wishful thinking.\n\nDickens emphatically states at the end of The Old Curiosity Shop (1841) that the building of which he wrote was \"long ago pulled down.\"\n\nIn a letter to The Echo in 1883, a Mr Charles Tesseyman confessed that his brother, who had dealt in old china, books and paintings from the premises between 1868 and 1877, had added the \"Immortalized by\" appellation to his shop front for \"business purposes.\"\n\nFollowing his brother's death, in 1877, the new tenant painted over his name but left the claim displayed on the wall.\n\nAround 1881, an American journalist, who was writing about Dickensian landmarks, arrived at the shop and \"straightaway wrote an article in Scribner's Monthly [assuring] his readers that this was the old original Old Curiosity shop of Dickens.\"\n\nPICKWICKIAN GHOST STORIES\n\nThe George IV pub on the right past the shop, rebuilt since Dickens's day, is thought to have been the original of the Magpie and Stump, where in Pickwick Papers, Jack Bramber tells Mr Pickwick some very bizarre and extremely gruesome stories.\n\nTHE ROYAL COLLEGE OF SURGEONS\n\nPlease note that the building is currently undergoing restoration and is encased in scaffolding.\n\nThe building was originally built by George Dance and James Lewis between 1806 and 1813. In 1835 it was completely rebuilt by Sir Charles Barry, although he did keep the grand portico with its giant Ionic columns.\n\nCommenting on the lawyers of Lincoln's Inn, Mr Boythorn in Bleak House says that they should have their \"necks wrung and their skulls arranged in Surgeon's Hall, for the contemplation of the whole profession, in order that its younger members might understand from actual measurement in early life, how thick skulls may become!\"\n\nToday you can do likewise, as all manner of gruesomely fascinating artefacts and anatomical specimens - lawyers skulls excepted - are now on display and open to the public in the college's two museums.\n\nIMPORTANT. Please note that the Museums are currently closed whilst the restoration is being done.\n\nTHE NECKETT CHILDREN\n\nDickens describes Bell Yard as a \"narrow alleyway\", and that description still holds true today, albeit the fact that its right side is overshadowed by the open space alongside the mighty bulk of the Royal Courts of Justice means that it doesn't give the appearance of being a narrow alley.\n\nIt was here in Bleak House that the four orphaned Neckett children lived in an upper room, cared for by the eldest, Charley, who goes out to do washing jobs to support her siblings.\n\nIt was also in Bell Yard that Mrs Lovatt had her pie shop at which she sold the finest and tastiest meat pies in London, albeit the main ingredients were supplied by Sweeney Todd, \"The Demon Barber of Fleet Street\" and consisted of his murdered clients! So tread carefully.\n\nTEMPLE BAR\n\nThis pedestal, surmounted by a bronze dragon, marks the boundary between the Cities of London and Westminster and is the point at which Fleet Street ends and Strand begins.\n\nThe statues of Queen Victoria and her son Edward as Prince of Wales are by Sir Edgar Boehm - who is reputed to have died in 1890 whilst in the process of making love to Edward's sister, Princess Louise!\n\nA LEADEN-HEADED OLD OBSTRUCTION\n\nThis, however, is not the Temple Bar that Dickens knew.\n\nIn Bleak House Dickens described Temple Bar as:- \"that leaden-headed old obstruction, appropriate ornament for the threshold of a leaden-headed old corporation.\"\n\nIn 1888 the leaden-headed old obstruction was transferred to Theobald's Park, in Hertfordshire, and there lay largely forgotten and terribly neglected for over 100 years.\n\nBut, in 2004, it was brought back to central London, restored, and re-erected next to St Paul's Cathedral where it can be now be admired by all those who visit St Paul's.\n\nA relief on the column actually shows Temple Bar as it was in Dickens day.\n\nCHILD'S BANK\n\nThis particular building dates from 1878, when its predecessor was demolished with the removal of Temple Bar.\n\nIn A Tale of Two Cities Dickens renamed it \"Tellson's Bank\" and described it thus:-\n\n\"Tellson's Bank by Temple Bar was an old-fashioned place, even in the year one thousand seven hundred and eighty. It was very small, very dark, very ugly, very incommodious. It was an old-fashioned place, moreover, in the moral attribute that the partners in the House were proud of its smallness, proud of its darkness, proud of its ugliness, proud of its incommodiousness. They were even boastful of its eminence in those particulars, and were fired by an express conviction that, if it were less objectionable, it would be less respectable. This was no passive belief, but an active weapon which they flashed at more convenient places of business. Tellson's (they said) wanted no elbow-room, Tellson's wanted no light, Tellson's wanted no embellishment. Noakes and Co.'s might, or Snooks Brothers' might; but Tellson's, thank Heaven!\n\nAny one of these partners would have disinherited his son on the question of rebuilding Tellson's. In this respect the House was much on a par with the Country; which did very often disinherit its sons for suggesting improvements in laws and customs that had long been highly objectionable, but were only the more respectable.\n\nThus it had come to pass, that Tellson's was the triumphant perfection of inconvenience. After bursting open a door of idiotic obstinacy with a weak rattle in its throat, you fell into Tellson's down two steps, and came to your senses in a miserable little shop, with two little counters, where the oldest of men made your cheque shake as if the wind rustled it, while they examined the signature by the dingiest of windows, which were always under a shower-bath of mud from Fleet-street, and which were made the dingier by their own iron bars proper, and the heavy shadow of Temple Bar. If your business necessitated your seeing \"the House,\" you were put into a species of Condemned Hold at the back, where you meditated on a misspent life, until the House came with its hands in its pockets, and you could hardly blink at it in the dismal twilight. Your money came out of, or went into, wormy old wooden drawers, particles of which flew up your nose and down your throat when they were opened and shut. Your bank-notes had a musty odour, as if they were fast decomposing into rags again. Your plate was stowed away among the neighbouring cesspools, and evil communications corrupted its good polish in a day or two. Your deeds got into extemporised strong-rooms made of kitchens and sculleries, and fretted all the fat out of their parchments into the banking-house air. Your lighter boxes of family papers went up-stairs into a Barmecide room, that always had a great dining-table in it and never had a dinner, and where, even in the year one thousand seven hundred and eighty, the first letters written to you by your old love, or by your little children, were but newly released from the horror of being ogled through the windows, by the heads exposed on Temple Bar with an insensate brutality and ferocity worthy of Abyssinia or Ashantee.\n\n...Cramped in all kinds of dim cupboards and hutches at Tellson's, the oldest of men carried on the business gravely. When they took a young man into Tellson's London house, they hid him somewhere till he was old. They kept him in a dark place, like a cheese, until he had the full Tellson flavour and blue-mould upon him. Then only was he permitted to be seen, spectacularly poring over large books, and casting his breeches and gaiters into the general weight of the establishment...\"\n\nJERRY CRUNCHER'S PERCH\n\nIt was outside Tellson's Bank that the mysterious Jerry Cruncher was wont to sit.\n\nDickens has this to say about Jerry Cruncher's association with Tellson's:-\n\n\"Outside Tellson's - never by any means in it, unless called in - was an odd-job-man, an occasional porter and messenger, who served as the live sign of the house. He was never absent during business hours, unless upon an errand, and then he was represented by his son: a grisly urchin of twelve, who was his express image. People understood that Tellson's, in a stately way, tolerated the odd-job-man. The house had always tolerated some person in that capacity, and time and tide had drifted this person to the post. His surname was Cruncher, and on the youthful occasion of his renouncing by proxy the works of darkness, in the easterly parish church of Hounsditch, he had received the added appellation of Jerry...\"\n\nDickens goes on to describe Jerry Cruncher's \"occupation of the day\" thus:-\n\n\"...It could scarcely be called a trade, in spite of his favourite description of himself as \"a honest tradesman.\" His stock consisted of a wooden stool, made out of a broken-backed chair cut down, which stool, young Jerry, walking at his father's side, carried every morning to beneath the banking-house window that was nearest Temple Bar: where, with the addition of the first handful of straw that could be gleaned from any passing vehicle to keep the cold and wet from the odd-job-man's feet, it formed the encampment for the day. On this post of his, Mr. Cruncher was as well known to Fleet-street and the Temple, as the Bar itself, - and was almost as ill-looking...\"\n\nWe shall encounter Jerry Cruncher again, later in the tour.\n\nINSIDE THE BANK\n\nThe interior of the bank still has a decidedly antiquated feel, and it is worth stepping inside to view the glass case on the wall opposite the door, in which ten old guns are exhibited. The bank purchased these guns in June 1780 to defend the premises during the anti-Catholic Gordon Riots so vividly described by Dickens in Barnaby Rudge.\n\nMIDDLE TEMPLE\n\nYou have entered Middle temple, another of London's four Inns of Court.\n\nImmediately, the blandness of late 20th-century architecture gives way to a tranquil oasis that has been left untouched by time and progress.\n\nElegant buildings of redbrick rise up on either side of the cobble-stoned byway, and Charles Lamb's sentiment that, \"a man would give something to be born in such places\" still holds true\n\nWriting of this lovely enclave in Barnaby Rudge, Dickens had this to say:-\n\n\"There is yet a drowsiness in its courts and a dreamy dullness in its trees and gardens. Those who pace its lanes and squares may yet hear the echoes of their footsteps on the sounding stones and read upon its gates... \"Who enters here leaves noise behind\".\"\n\nMIDDLE TEMPLE HALL\n\nBuilt in the 1570's, this is a true time capsule of bygone London.\n\nEach of the four Inns of Court possesses its own dining hall in which aspiring barristers must eat a certain number of dinners during each law term in order to be \"Called to the Bar.\"\n\nDespite heaping a goodly amount of scorn upon the legal profession, Dickens was not averse to participating in its traditions.\n\nIn 1839 he enrolled as a student barrister at Middle Temple, hoping that the law would provide a safety net should his writing career end. However, he failed to eat the required number of dinners and subsequently resigned his membership in 1855.\n\nIt was inside this hall that Shakespeare's Twelfth Night had its first performance, on the 2nd February, 1602.\n\nFOUNTAIN COURT\n\nIn Martin Chuzzlewit (1843â44), Dickens wove a romance around this court involving Ruth Pinch and John Westlock. The area has changed little since Dickens wrote of it:-\n\n\"Brilliantly the Temple fountain sparkled in the sun, and laughingly its liquid music played, and merrily the idle drops of water danced and danced, and peeping out in sport among the trees, plunged lightly down to hide themselves...\"\n\nGARDEN COURT\n\nGarden Court was the place where Pip was living in Great Expectations, when the convict Abel Magwitch turned up one storm-tossed night to reveal himself as the source of Pip's good fortune. Dickens has Pip explain how:-\n\n\"Alterations have been made to that part of the Temple since that time, and it has not now so lonely a character as it had then, nor is it so exposed to the river. We lived at the top of the last house, and the wind rushing up the river shook the house that night, like discharges of cannon, or breakings of a sea...\"\n\nTEMPLE CHURCH AND THE KNIGHTS TEMPLAR\n\nThe Temple gets its name from the Knights Templar, the monastic military order founded in 1118 with the avowed intent of protecting pilgrims on the road to Jerusalem.\n\nThis was their London citadel and in 1185 they built their Round Church, which was modelled on the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem.\n\nThe Templars were well-connected and soon became influential in the politics of the age. They quickly attracted grants of land and money as the younger sons of noble families flocked to enroll in their ranks, and by the 13th century they were one of the most powerful monastic orders in Christendom.\n\nIn England, the Master of the Temple was frequently called to sit in the King's Parliament and successive monarchs, King John included, frequently stayed at the Templars London base, and the Master of the order was by the King's side at the signing of Magna Carta.\n\nBy the early years of the 14th century the Templars were the most powerful monastic Orders in Europe and were answerable only to the Pope himself.\n\nBut their success attracted the jealousy and greed of many other Orders and eventually that of the nobility and monarchs of Europe as well.\n\nIn 1306, Philippe IV of France became determined to rid his territories of the Knight Templars.\n\nAt dawn on Friday, October 13th, 1307 the King made his move, and with the backing of the Pope, Clement V, all the Knights Templars in France were simultaneously arrested by Philippe's agents. Under torture, some Templars \"admitted\" to all manner of blasphemous and indecent acts. Many of their number were burnt at the stake and eventually in 1312 the order of the Knights Templar was officially dissolved throughout Europe.\n\nThere are many conspiracy theories concerning the real reason for dismantling of the order, and some of them go far beyond the simple and obvious motive that Philippe simply wanted to get his hands on their lands.\n\nSeveral modern day fringe researchers have claimed that the order stored secret knowledge, linking them to the lost teachings and relics of Christ, including the Holy Grail; and the Temple Church itself now has the added \"attraction\" of having featured in both the book and the film of Dan Brown's The Da Vinci Code.\n\nBut, in London, their Round Church still stands as a proud testimony to these soldiers of Christ, and is well worth a visit, should time permit.\n\nyou can get details of admission charges and opening times on the Temple Church Website\n\nTHE LAWYERS ARRIVE\n\nIn 1324 the Templars London estate was given to the Knights Hospitallers of St John, and some of the monastery buildings were rented to law students for accommodation.\n\nThe connection with the law flourished and it is lawyers who today worship in the church.\n\nDespite its extensive renovation following bomb damage in the Second World War, the Temple Church is still a very special and atmospheric place.\n\nThe first thing that strikes you when you enter are the effigies of knights that lie peacefully recumbent on the floor within.\n\nThe hustle and bustle of the world outside seem centuries away as you stand gazing down upon these long ago members of the order; or as you admire the carved faces that adorn the interior wall of the church's round section, some of their expressions twisted into weird grimaces, whilst others are being gnawed at by bizarre and demonic creatures.\n\nTHE GRAVE OF OLIVER GOLDSMITH\n\nAlthough Oliver Goldsmith (1730â74) was long dead by the time Dickens was born, he was one of Dickens's favourite boyhood authors and he remained so for the rest of his life.\n\nGoldsmith's only novel The Vicar of Wakefield (1762) was a great influence on Dickens's early work, particularly Pickwick Papers.\n\nDickens gave his youngest brother, Augustus, the nickname Moses, in honour of Moses Primrose the Vicar's son in Goldsmith's book.\n\nForster, in his Life of Dickens, explained how, when this nickname was \"facetiously pronounced through the nose' it became \"Boses\" and, on being shortened, became \"Boz\", which was the pseudonym that Dickens adopted in 1836, and under which much of his early work appeared.\n\nPRINCE HENRY'S ROOM\n\nThe building dates from 1610, and was named after the eldest son of King James 1st.\n\nIt was originally a tavern called the Prince's Arms.\n\nIn Dickens childhood the building was occupied by Mrs Salmon's Waxworks, which Charles certainly visited, and to which \"perspiring Wax Works\" he later sent David Copperfield.\n\nTHE GIANTS OF ST DUNSTAN'S\n\nSt Dunstan's Church, whose magnificent clock, dating from 1671, is said to have been the first clock in London with a double-sided face, and the first to have the minutes marked on the dial.\n\nThe chief glory of the clock, however, lies in the two ancient giants that wearily lift their clubs every fifteen minutes and make half-hearted attempts to strike the bells. Sadly their efforts are frequently drowned out by the noise of the Fleet Street traffic.\n\nIn David Copperfield, David and his aunt, Betsy Trotwood, make a special journey to witness the giants strike the bells, and time their visit \"to catch them at it at twelve o'clock\".\n\nIn 1830, the old church was demolished and the clock sold to the Marquis of Hertford who re-erected it at his house in Regent's Park.\n\nOver 100 years would pass, before, in 1935, the clock was returned.\n\nSWEENEY TODD\n\nIt admits you into a chilling, claustrophobic courtyard, where beneath your feet, hefty iron grilles cover precarious drops into mean looking cellars where all manner of horrors might be lurking.\n\nYou are standing at the rear of 185 Fleet Street where Sweeney Todd \"the Demon Barber\" had his premises.\n\nHis murderous, though fictional, escapades first appeared in print in 1847, and his story so captured the public imagination, that he became the most successful of all the Victorian melodramas.\n\nHis habit of murdering his clients and conveying them by way of an underground tunnel to nearby Bell Yard, where Mrs Lovett kept a meat pie shop, struck a chord with a reading public who were far more dependent on outside caterers than we are today!\n\nTHE CHIMES\n\nThe present building dates only from 1829 to 1833, but is an excellent early example of Gothic Revival architecture.\n\nSt Dunstan's In The West is the church of Dickens second Christmas book, The Chimes, and Dickens introduces us to it as follows:-\n\n\"But, high up in the steeple! There the foul blast roars and whistles! High up in the steeple, where it is free to come and go through many an airy arch and loophole, and to twist and twine itself about the giddy stair, and twirl the groaning weathercock, and make the very tower shake and shiver! High up in the steeple, where the belfry is, and iron rails are ragged with rust, and sheets of lead and copper, shrivelled by the changing weather, crackle and heave beneath the unaccustomed tread; and birds stuff shabby nests into corners of old oaken joists and beams; and dust grows old and grey; and speckled spiders, indolent and fat with long security, swing idly to and fro in the vibration of the bells, and never loose their hold upon their thread-spun castles in the air, or climb up sailor-like in quick alarm, or drop upon the ground and ply a score of nimble legs to save one life! High up in the steeple of an old church, far above the light and murmur of the town and far below the flying clouds that shadow it, is the wild and dreary place at night: and high up in the steeple of an old church, dwelt the Chimes I tell of.\n\nThey were old Chimes, trust me. Centuries ago, these Bells had been baptized by bishops: so many centuries ago, that the register of their baptism was lost long, long before the memory of man, and no one knew their names. They had had their Godfathers and Godmothers, these Bells (for my own part, by the way, I would rather incur the responsibility of being Godfather to a Bell than a Boy), and had their silver mugs no doubt, besides. But Time had mowed down their sponsors, and Henry the Eighth had melted down their mugs; and they now hung, nameless and mugless, in the church-tower.\n\nNot speechless, though. Far from it. They had clear, loud, lusty, sounding voices, had these Bells; and far and wide they might be heard upon the wind. Much too sturdy Chimes were they, to be dependent on the pleasure of the wind, moreover; for, fighting gallantly against it when it took an adverse whim, they would pour their cheerful notes into a listening ear right royally; and bent on being heard on stormy nights, by some poor mother watching a sick child, or some lone wife whose husband was at sea, they had been sometimes known to beat a blustering Nor' Wester; aye, \"all to fits,\" as Toby Veck said;âfor though they chose to call him Trotty Veck, his name was Toby, and nobody could make it anything else either (except Tobias) without a special act of parliament; he having been as lawfully christened in his day as the Bells had been in theirs, though with not quite so much of solemnity or public rejoicing...\"\n\nIt was in the tower of this church that Toby Veck (known as 'Trotty' on account of his gait) was subjected to a sequence of visions in The Chimes.\n\nKING LUD AND HIS SONS\n\nIf it is possible, it is worth going into the porch, which is set back beyond the clock to view three of London's oldest statues, which depict King Lud and his two sons.\n\nLud was the legendary founder of London and these weatherworn statues once stood over Lud Gate (one of the medieval entrance points into London - Ludgate Hill, the road that runs down from St Paul's Cathedral commemorates it) until it was taken down in the 18th century.\n\nThese statues now lie abandoned and forgotten in this quiet recess away from Fleet Street.\n\nPlease note, the statues are currently boarded over.\n\nCLIFFORD'S INN\n\nDickens, in Our Mutual Friend, has left an enduring, albeit uncomplimentary, portrait of Clifford's Inn. John Rokesmith, having followed Mr Boffin along Fleet Street, asks if he would:-\n\n\"...object to turn aside into this place â I think it is called Clifford's Inn â where we can hear one another better than in the roaring street? [Mr Boffin] glanced into the mouldy little plantation, or cat-preserve, of Clifford's Inn, as it was that day, in search of a suggestion. Sparrows were there, cats were there, dry rot and wet-rot were there, but it was not otherwise a suggestive spot.\"\n\nJOHNSON'S COURT\n\nThis narrow thoroughfare is perhaps one of the most important Dickensian sites on the walk, for here stood the office of The Old Monthly Magazine, a small-circulation periodical in whose December 1833 issue Dickens's first published story, A Dinner At Poplar Walk appeared.\n\nDickens later recalled how \"stealthily one evening at twilight, with fear and trembling\", he had dropped the story \"into a dark letter-box in a dark office up a dark court in Fleet â street\".\n\nWhen he found that they had published it, he was so overcome with emotion that he \"walked down to Westminster Hall, and turned into it for half an hour, because my eyes were so dimmed with joy and pride that they could not bear the street, and were not fit to be seen there\".\n\nAlthough he received no payment for his work, he wrote a further nine stories for the magazine and thus took his first tentative steps to becoming the \"inimitable Boz\".\n\nDR JOHNSON'S HOUSE\n\n17 Gough Square, London, EC4A 3DE.\n\nOctober to April: Monday - Saturday, 11am - 5pm.\n\nMay to September Monday - Saturday, 11am - 5.30pm.\n\nThere is an admission charge.\n\nwebsite.\n\nSamuel Johnson (1709-84), literary scholar and critic lived and worked here, compiling A Dictionary of the English Language, the first comprehensive English dictionary.\n\nHis monumental tome originated in 1746 when five London booksellers decided that a dictionary would be a guaranteed bestseller and approached Johnson to see if he would be interested in creating one. Since Johnson at the time was flat broke, their offer of 1500 guineas, half of which was to be paid up front, proved irresistible.\n\nEager to secure further funding Johnson sought a patron and approached Philip Dormer Stanhope, the fourth Earl of Chesterfield. Stanhope readily agreed to become the patron of the work, but showed a marked reluctance to contribute financially. Indeed the fact that all he handed over was a draft for a measly £10 rankled with Johnson.\n\nWhen his Lordship then insisted on claiming a part of Johnson's triumph relations between the two men cooled considerably, with Johnson claiming that Chesterfield taught, \"the morals of a whore and the manners of a dancing master.\"\n\nThe thick skinned Chesterfield laughed the attack off as a bit of good-natured banter, which it most certainly was not.\n\nStill, Johnson at least had the seven hundred and fifty pounds advance, and so he rented these rooms in Gough Square, hired six serving men to work as amanuenses, and embarked upon a project that would take him six years to complete.\n\nThe finished work contained the definitions for an impressive, if not breathtaking, 43,500 words, amongst them such gems as \"Oats a cereal eaten in England by horses and in Scotland by men!\"\n\nHe was also able to avenge himself upon Lord Chesterfield - who was openly hinting that he had had a lot more to do with the work than he actually had - \"Patron\" wrote Johnson \"a wretch who supports with indolence and is paid with flattery.\"\n\nChesterfield laughed that one off too.\n\nJohnson's former house is now a museum dedicated to his memory and the original dictionary is on display inside. It is well worth a visit.\n\nYE OLDE CHESHIRE CHEESE\n\nRebuilt in 1667, this rambling tavern of creaking floors, cosy rooms and snug corners, possesses a timeless ambience that keeps the contemporary world firmly at bay.\n\nPortraits of those who have worked and supped here over the centuries gaze fondly down from its dark wooden walls. Dr Johnson, Oliver Goldsmith, Mark Twain, Alfred Tennyson and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle â to name but a few â have all ducked beneath its low beamed ceilings to absorb its 17th-century atmosphere.\n\nA TALE OF TWO CITIES\n\nDickens, too, was a regular, and the table to the right of the ground floor restaurant's fireplace is said to have been his favoured place.\n\nThis is believed to have been the pub that Dickens had in mind when, following Charles Darnay's acquittal on charges of high treason in A Tale of Two Cities, Sydney Carton invites him to dine.\n\n\"...Carton, who smelt of port wine, and did not appear to be quite sober, laughed then, and turned to Darnay: \"This is a strange chance that throws you and me together. This must be a strange night to you, standing alone here with your counterpart on these street stones?\"\n\n\"I hardly seem yet,\" returned Charles Darnay, \"to belong to this world again.\"\n\n\"I don't wonder at it; it's not so long since you were pretty far advanced on your way to another. You speak faintly.\"\n\n\"I begin to think I am faint.\"\n\n\"Then why the devil don't you dine? I dined, myself, while those numskulls were deliberating which world you should belong to - this, or some other. Let me show you the nearest tavern to dine well at.\"\n\nDrawing his arm through his own, he took him down Ludgate-hill to Fleet-street, and so, up a covered way, into a tavern. Here, they were shown into a little room, where Charles Darnay was soon recruiting his strength with a good plain dinner and good wine: while Carton sat opposite to him at the same table, with his separate bottle of port before him, and his fully half-insolent manner upon him...\"\n\nPOLLY THE WICKED PARROT\n\nBefore you leave Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese, it is worth looking above the till (cash register) in the bar to the right of the pub's entrance.\n\nIn a glass case, you can catch a view of \"Polly\" the Cheese's famous - or should that be infamous? - ex-parrot.\n\nIn the early 20th century, this parrot achieved international celebrity status because of its abilities of imitation. Visitors to London would make a point of dropping in at the Cheshire Cheese in order to make Polly's acquaintance.\n\nIt was also renowned for its colourful language - its extensive vocabulary having been acquired from soldiers who visited the pub whilst on leave during Word War One!\n\nYou can read a full account of the life and escapades of Polly the Parrot here.\n\nHANGING SWORD ALLEY\n\n\"The scene was Mr. Cruncher's private lodging in Hanging-sword-alley, Whitefriars: the time, half-past seven of the clock on a windy March morning, Anno Domini seventeen hundred and eighty. (Mr. Cruncher himself always spoke of the year of our Lord as Anna Dominoes: apparently under the impression that the Christian era dated from the invention of a popular game, by a lady who had bestowed her name upon it.)\n\nMr. Cruncher's apartments were not in a savoury neighbourhood, and were but two in number, even if a closet with a single pane of glass in it might be counted as one. But they were very decently kept. Early as it was, on the windy March morning, the room in which he lay abed was already scrubbed throughout; and between the cups and saucers arranged for breakfast, and the lumbering deal table, a very clean white cloth was spread...\"\n\nBRADBURY AND EVANS\n\nFounded by and named for William Bradbury (1799[1]-1869) and Frederick Mullett Evans (1804[2]-1870) in 1830, Bradbury and Evans were printers for the first ten years of their existence, in which capacity they undertook work for Chapman and Hall, the publishers of Dickens early works.\n\nIn 1841, they purchased Punch magazine, and, in so doing, became publishers in their own right.\n\nIn 1844, Dickens broke with his original publishers, Chapman and Hall, and decamped to Bradbury and Evans who were then his publishers for the next fifteen years.\n\nBut, in 1857, following his separation from his wife, Catherine, Dickens asked that they publish a statement he had written in defence of his actions towards Catherine in Punch. Bradbury and Evans refused to do so, arguing that personal marital issues had no place in a satirical magazine.\n\nDickens was furious at what he saw as their betrayal of him, and he duly wrote to Frederick Evans to tell him that he could have no truck with someone who had been so \"false\" to him under the greatest wrong he had ever known.\n\nFrom that point on he began winding down his association with Bradbury and Evans, breaking with them completely in 1859, after which he returned to Chapman and Hall.\n\nhe never spoke to Bradbury again, and vowed that he would, likewise, never have anything more to do with Evans.\n\nUnfortunately, his eldest son, Charley, had become romantically involved with Evans's daughter, Bessie. When the two married a few years later, Dickens point blank refused to attend because the reception would be held at Evans's house.\n\nBradbury and Evans were also the publishers of William Makepeace Thackeray. From January 1847, they published his Vanity Fair in the periodical format that Dickens had popularised.\n\nTHE SITE OF FAGIN'S LAIR\n\nTo the right of this grimy, shabby thoroughfare once stood Field Lane, which is where Fagin's den was located in Oliver Twist.\n\nIt was swept away by the Holborn Valley improvement when Holborn Viaduct, the world's first flyover, which crosses over Shoe lane, was built in the late 1860's.\n\nST ANDREW'S CHURCH\n\nBill Sikes and Oliver Twist pause to look up at the clock of the church, just as you are doing, as they set out to rob the house at Chertsey.\n\nTaking a time-check on the clock, Sikes says to Oliver, \"it's hard upon seven! You must step out.\"\n\nTHE SITE OF FURNIVAL'S INN\n\nThe Prudential Building stands on the site of Furnival's Inn, where Dickens lived from 1834 to 1837.\n\nDuring this time he began Pickwick Papers the work that set him on the road to literary fame.\n\nA TRAGIC START TO PICKWICK\n\nThe book was actually the idea of Robert Seymour (1798â1836), one of the most popular comic illustrators of the 1830s. In the autumn of 1835, he approached the publishers Chapman and Hall with a series of sketches he had drawn depicting the mishaps of a group of comical cockneys known as the \"Nimrod Club\".\n\nThe publishers, who had asked several authors to write the captions without success, contacted the young journalist Charles Dickens, who was starting to make a name for himself with his Sketches.\n\nFrom the outset Dickens was determined to keep overall control of the project, which was re-named Pickwick Papers, much to Seymour's consternation.\n\nOn 17th April, 1836, Dickens invited Seymour to \"take a glass of grogâ at his lodgings in Furnival's Inn.\" The meeting, the only time the two men actually met, was tense, as Dickens demanded that Seymour change one of his illustrations. Dickens tried to be conciliatory, but Seymour, having suggested that a younger and more adaptable artist might \"suit Mr Dickens better\", cut the meeting short and left.\n\nA few days later, having worked on the new designs as requested, he left a note of apology to \"the best and dearest of wives\", went into his garden shed, and shot himself through the heart.\n\nDickens moved quickly to recover from the blow of Seymour's death and set about finding a new illustrator. Among those who expressed an interest was William Makepeace Thackeray (1811â63), who would later become Dickens's chief rival amongst the Victorian literati. However, the job went to Hablot Browne (1815â82) who, having adopted the pseudonym \"Phiz\" to match Dickens's \"Boz\", remained Dickens's principal illustrator for the next 23 years.\n\nWhilst living here Dickens married Catherine Hogarth and when Pickwick Papers proved a great success he was able to move to a large house that befitted his new-found wealth and status.\n\nA somewhat raddled looking bust of Charles Dickens gazes dolefully out from a perspex case.\n\nA DEPRESSING INSTITUTION\n\nTo the modern eye this is a delightful piece of bygone London, but Dickens was particularly unimpressed by it.\n\n\"Indeed\", he wrote in The Uncommercial Traveller, \"I look upon Gray's Inn...as one of the most depressing institutions in brick and mortar, known to the children of men.\"\n\nEither there has been a great deal of change since he wrote those words, or else the drudgery of the 18 months he spent working as a clerk here clouded his judgment! But, more of that later.\n\nGRAY'S INN SQUARE\n\nIn Pickwick Papers, Mr Pickwick hurries to the square early one morning to consult with the lawyer Mr. Perker. Describing the scene in Gray's Inn Square, Dickens wrote:-\n\n\"It still wanted ten minutes to the hour when he had ascended the staircase on which Perker's chambers were. The clerks had not arrived yet, and he beguiled the time by looking out of the staircase window.\n\nThe healthy light of a fine October morning made even the dingy old houses brighten up a little; some of the dusty windows actually looking almost cheerful as the sun's rays gleamed upon them. Clerk after clerk hastened into the square by one or other of the entrances, and looking up at the Hall clock, accelerated or decreased his rate of walking according to the time at which his office hours nominally commenced; the half-past nine o'clock people suddenly becoming very brisk, and the ten o'clock gentlemen falling into a pace of most aristocratic slowness. The clock struck ten, and clerks poured in faster than ever, each one in a greater perspiration than his predecessor. The noise of unlocking and opening doors echoed and re-echoed on every side; heads appeared as if by magic in every window; the porters took up their stations for the day; the slipshod laundresses hurried off; the postman ran from house to house; and the whole legal hive was in a bustle.\"\n\nTHE OFFICE OF ELLIS AND BLACKMORE\n\nIn 1827, Ellis and Blackmore, Solicitors, occupied \"a poor old set of chambers of three rooms..\" in this building.\n\nIt was here that Charles Dickens came to work in May 1827.\n\nIn those days it was No 5 Holborn Square, and it is the only building in the immediate vicinity to have survived the bombs of World War II.\n\nSo little has changed that you can just picture the \"good looking and clever\" young boy, his \"healthy pink â almost glowing\" complexion, expressive eyes and beautiful brown hair, worn long, as was then the fashion...\" stepping across its threshold on his first day of employment.\n\nEvidently the office comic, Dickens used to delight his fellow clerks with his talent for mimicry, whilst his knowledge of London, even at the age of 15, was both impressive and unrivalled.\n\nOne of his amusements was to drop cherry stones from the second floor offices onto the hats of passers-by below. Should anyone complain he would confront them \"with so much gravity and with such an air of innocence, that they went away..\"\n\nGRAY'S INN HALL\n\nAs with the majority of the buildings in the vicinity, the dining hall of Gray's in underwent a great deal of restoration as a result of bomb damage in the Second World War. However, the restoration was tastefully done and, in consequence, you would hardly know that this wasn't the entire original building as it was when it was constructed in the first half of the 16th century.\n\nThe hall has many literary connections, chief amongst them being the fact that it was, reputedly, the venue for the first performance of Shakespeare's The Comedy of Errors in 1594.\n\nELLIS AND BLACKMORE AGAIN\n\nEllis and Blackmore moved to number one (rebuilt after World War 2 bomb damage) in December 1827 and Dickens remained with them until November 1828.\n\nThe desk at which he worked is preserved in the Dickens House Museum, to which you will shortly be making your way.\n\nIt was whilst working here that Dickens began to learn shorthand and, by 1829, he had become a shorthand writer in Doctor's Commons.\n\nBut his experiences at Ellis and Blackmore would resurface time and again in his fiction. Indeed, in the firm's petty cash book, now preserved in America, can be found such names as Weller, Bardell and Rudge, all of which he would use later in his novels.\n\nTHE CHARLES DICKENS MUSEUM\n\n48 Doughty St, London WC1N 2LX.\n\nOpening Times: Tuesday to Sunday, 10am to 5pm, last admission 4pm.\n\nThere is an admission charge.\n\nWebsite\n\nTHREE FRUITFULL YEARS\n\nDickens moved to this fine old Georgian house - which is now the Charles Dickens Museum - in March 1837, just as he was starting to find success as an author.\n\nWhilst living here, he finished Pickwick Papers, wrote Oliver Twist and Nicholas Nickleby and began work on Barnaby Rudge.\n\nBy the time he moved out, in December 1839, he was famous throughout the world.\n\nHis daughters Mary and Kate were born here, and it was whilst living here that he cemented his life long friendship with John Forster.\n\nIt was the largest house he had lived in so far, and his domestic situation was, for a time, idyllic.\n\nTHE DEATH OF MARY HOGARTH\n\nBut, on 7th May, 1837 the idyll was shattered in a way that would affect him personally and professionally for the rest of his life.\n\nHis beloved sister-in-law, Mary Hogarth, collapsed in the early hours of the morning â doctors later diagnosed heart failure â and she died that afternoon in Dickens's arms.\n\nThe distraught Dickens removed a ring from her finger and wore it for the rest of his life. \"Thank God she died in my arms,\" he said shortly after her death, \"and the very last words she whispered were of me.\"\n\nInstead Dickens and Catherine went to the wilder reaches of Hampstead to recover from the shock of their loss.\n\nTHE IMPACT OF HER DEATH\n\nProfessionally, the immediate effect of her death on him was that he was unable to write the next installments of Pickwick Papers and Oliver Twist.\n\nBut, in the years ahead, Mary Hogarth would be reincarnated time and again in his novels, becoming the all too perfect heroines such as Rose Maylie in Oliver Twist, Florence Dombey in Dombey and Son, Agnes Wickfield in David Copperfield, Lucy Manette in A Tale of Two Cities and, most famously, Little Nell, the unbelievably saccharine heroine of The Old Curiosity Shop.\n\nAs an article in The Dickensian Magazine put it in 1937, on the centenary of her death, \"[Mary Hogarth] is part of the world's literature\".\n\nHer death may even have stunted his emotional growth, leaving him with an idealized image of womanhood, which must have affected his relationship with Catherine. As time and years of child bearing took their toll on Catherine Dickens, she was more and more unable to live up to his ideal.\n\nFor the rest of his life, Dickens would search for a new Mary Hogarth, and, it could be said, that the seeds of the later collapse of his marriage were sown in the room in Doughty Street where she died.\n\nTHE HOUSE SAVED FROM DEMOLITION\n\nIn 1922, The Dickens Fellowship rescued the house from demolition and, a few years later, opened it to the public.\n\nIt is now a treasure trove of relics and articles that depict his life and times and is the perfect place at which to end your tour of Dickens London.\n\nIncidentally, if you want to have a bite to eat or a cup of tea or coffee before visiting the house, or beginning your journey home, you can enjoy the delightful little cafe at the rear of the house, with its lovely and tranquil little garden in which you can sit and relax after your morning or afternoon's exploration."
