        "text": "Martin Chuzzlewit had its origin in turbulence and conflict, as Dickens attempted to come to terms with the profound disappointments he had experienced during his first American visit in 1842. The stormy and complex history of Dickens’s relationship with America resembles that of a painful love affair, for it is a tale of love and hate, dreams nurtured and then betrayed. The editors of the Pilgrim Edition of Dickens’s letters, the most important source for the history of that relationship, suggest that Dickens’s response to America moved from ‘delighted gratification at his welcome to disenchantment and even repulsion’ (3.vii).1 He was by no means the first English traveller to visit America and then return home, denounce it, and make a pile of money in doing so. In fact, by the time Dickens travelled there, this was something of a minor publishing industry. Prior to his first American visit, Dickens had read the writings of some of those who had preceded him, including Harriet Martineau’s Society in America (1837) and Retrospect of Western Travel (1838), as well as Marryat’s A Diary in America (1839); and when he returned from America he spoke warmly of Mrs Trollope’s Domestic Manners of the Americans (1832).\n\nI have always been haunted by this image, and during one period of my life it kept recurring in my dreams: a person finds himself in a world of children, from which he cannot escape, and suddenly childhood, which we all lyricize and adore, reveals itself as pure horror.\n\n(Milan Kundera, The Book of Laughter and Forgetting)"
