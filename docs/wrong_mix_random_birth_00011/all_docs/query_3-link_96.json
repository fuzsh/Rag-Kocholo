        "text": "The map is to geography what verisimilitude is to the history of the novel: the visual dominance of the one, and the omnipotent realism of the other, are powerful tools for representing a city like nineteenth century London. Dickens's of London may have relied on verisimilitude, but it did so in a way that transgressed its own terms of reference, questioning reference even as landmarks and signposts. The geographer's map may illustrate reference points, St. Paul's and the Monument, but in Dickens no objective totality is established for the reader. Instead a constellation of named places becomes representative of the reputed governance of the city as a whole. Dickens's landscape simultaneously establishes and transgresses the half-secured foundations of the relationship between individuals and the environment. Contrats and contradictions are multiplied in crowd symbols, caricatures, and historical reversions. Verisimilitude and the visible are representative of the way in which Dickens sought to penerate the opaqueness of the city of crime and cholera. The figure that best illustrates Dicken's coming to terms with the city is the diligent detective probing every obscure nook and cranny. He shows how verisimilitude acts in the service of the relationship between the visible and the opaque."
