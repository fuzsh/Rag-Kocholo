This is A Christmas Carol in its purest form, with 99% of the text drawn directly from the original novella. Even more impressive, Morella’s theatrical portrayal of over 50 characters honors how Dickens himself would tour the world reciting the story. Now in its fourteenth holiday season, the show is a family tradition throughout the region and a gem constantly being discovered by new audiences.",
