        "text": "By Gordon Greenberg and Steve Rosen\n\nBased on A Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens\n\nIt’s back! San Diego has another show in its Christmas stocking with this fast, funny, and highly theatrical reimagining of one of the most beloved holiday stories ever told. All the traditional elements of Dickens’s A Christmas Carol are intact—including the iconic ghosts of Christmases Past, Present, and Future—but with a comic local twist. Audiences of all ages will cheer Ebenezer Scrooge’s rediscovery of the Christmas spirit in this riotous Dickens mash-up filled with music and laughter—all set in “wintery” San Diego.\n\nRunning time: One hour and 15 minutes. There is no intermission.\n\nFor Ebeneezer Scrooge's BIG San Diego Christmas Show children under the age of five are not permitted. Each individual attending the show must have a ticket for admission."
