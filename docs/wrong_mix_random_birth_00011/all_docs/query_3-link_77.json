        "text": "From the General Presbyter\n\nThe Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come\n\nDo you remember that ghost from Charles Dickens, A Christmas Carol? Shrouded, mysterious, creepy, silent. Scrooge was afraid and if we stop for a moment and think, so are we.\n\nWhat will this Advent/Christmas season be like? Will people come back to church? Will we have enough children for the manger scene? What about Christmas Eve service? Will the pews be empty? Will the choir even show up? And even worse – will there be another variant to shut us down at the last minute?\n\nPerhaps this will help.\n\nNumber One: You have zero control over who comes to in person worship and who chooses, for whatever reason, to watch online or not watch at all. Zero. I know you are doing your best. “God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change…” (St. Francis).\n\nNumber Two: Your responsibility is to create a space, in person AND online where folks can experience – if they choose – the anticipation and the joy of the birth of our Savior. The story is the same story told for over 2000 years in conditions much worse than we have now. We have one job – “Go tell it on the mountain, that Jesus Christ is Born.” (Spiritual)\n\nNumber Three: Enjoy the season and all the beauty and blessings it brings. You deserve it! If you look back on your life, you will find that no two Advents or Christmas’ were the same. Maybe you were on an airplane, took a cruise, visited family, stayed home, went to church, had COVID or the flu, ate french fries for dinner and yet, you survived to tell the tale! Dare to hope that God will continue to bless you and yours.\n\nKeep watch!\n\n– Jackie"
