        "text": "Living In The Past, The Present, And The Future - A Note from Adaptor, Laura Rocklyn\n\nThe effervescent text of Charles Dickens’ A Christmas Carol reveals new insights into our human condition each time I revisit it. No matter how many productions of Christmas Carol I have worked on in different capacities, I find myself wishing to return to help tell this story year after year. It is one of those rare, transcendent stories whose message is just as relevant in the twenty-first century as it was in the nineteenth.\n\nWhen asked to create a new adaptation set in the Baltimore Dickens visited in 1842, I was excited to share passages that have inspired me in the past, and to see what new treasures this story has to reveal for our present moment in time. I wanted to craft an adaptation that would \"live in the past, present and the future,\" as Scrooge promises to do at the end of the story.\n\nDiving into research on Baltimore in the 1840s, it became clear that it was a world of larger than life characters and larger than life conundrums of effortlessly Dickensian proportions — from Mrs. Mary Pickersgill of “Star Spangled Banner” fame and her Impartial Female Humane Society, to the challenges surrounding the rapid growth of the B&O Railroad. It is easy to believe that experiences Dickens had in Baltimore influenced this story he published in 1843, just a year after his American travels. Grounding the story in this setting felt like bringing it home, especially sitting in this theater and thinking that Dickens probably walked right by our site on his explorations of the city’s financial district.\n\nA Christmas Carol is a ghost story, but it is not a fairy tale. Its magic lies in the very real power of human compassion, and the way that the actions of one individual can alter the world around them, for good or ill. Retelling this story for the stage in 2022, I kept an eye to highlighting the holiday magic and music that audiences love in the Christmas Carol tradition, while bringing out the mysterious, darker undercurrents that give Dickens' story its enduring power.\n\nLaura Rocklyn\n\nAdaptor, A Christmas Carol\n\n“I have endeavoured in this Ghostly little book, to raise the Ghost of an Idea, which shall not put my readers out of humour with themselves, with each other, with the season, or with me. May it haunt their houses pleasantly.”\n\nTheir faithful Friend and Servant, C.D. December, 1843\n\nCharles Dickens was the son of John Dickens, a naval clerk, and Elizabeth Barrow, who aspired to be a teacher. In 1824, when he was just 12 years old, his father was sent to debtor’s prison. The family was living in a poor neighborhood in London. Charles left school to work in a rundown boot-blacking factory. In 1827, he found work as an office boy, and in a couple years began freelance reporting at the law courts of London and later for two London newspapers. He also submitted sketches to magazines and newspapers, which in 1836 were compiled in a book. His experiences left him with a concern for impoverished children, and influenced his writing, as seen in Oliver Twist (published 1838) and A Christmas Carol (published 1843), among many of his short stories, novels, and plays. A Christmas Carol was an immediate hit, selling 6,000 copies.\n\n-Courtesy of the BBC\n\nA Glimpse of the 1800's\n\n1800 – Alexander Brown arrived in Baltimore from Ireland, and with his sons launched a linen business; later, they expanded into cotton, shipping and investments and became financial giants. The city’s population then was 27,000.\n\n1807 – The College of Medicine of Maryland (later known as University of Maryland) was chartered.\n\n1830 – B&O Railroad began America’s first commercial railroad passenger service (horse-drawn), from Baltimore to Ellicott City. Steam locomotives were added in 1832.\n\n1835 – Edgar Allan Poe, about age 25, left his Baltimore home at No. 3 Amity Street to edit the Southern Literary Messenger in Richmond, VA.\n\n1840 – With an estimated population of 102,000, Baltimore was the second largest urban center in the country. Only New York City was larger. A gritty city, Baltimore was a center of shipbuilding, trade and finance. Maryland was a slaveholding state, but Baltimore also had the largest free black community in the country, roughly 26,000 people, comprising about one quarter of the city’s population. Their rights were severely restricted and frequently challenged, leaving many destitute, but others achieved a measure of economic success in trades and built their own churches and schools. Around 1840, a wave of German and Irish immigrants poured into the city.\n\n1840 – The city skyline of the 1840s included the Baltimore Basilica, America’s first cathedral; the Washington Monument in Mount Vernon, which was built from 1815-1829; the red brick Phoenix Shot Tower, which was for a long time the tallest structure in the city; and the St. Vincent de Paul Roman Catholic Church on Front Street. The Baltimore College of Dental Surgery -- the world’s first dental college – was founded in 1840; it is today part of University of Maryland.\n\n1842 – Charles Dickens toured America and stayed in Baltimore at Barnum’s City Hotel, located at Calvert and Fayette Streets.\n\n1843 – In England, the first Christmas card was invented. Prominent Baltimore attorney and Star-Spangled Banner writer Francis Scott Key died at the home of his daughter, a mansion on the site now occupied by Mount Vernon Place United Methodist Church.\n\n1844 – The Maryland Historical Society was founded. Builders of the telegraph first tried laying cable underground in 1843, and by 1844 decided instead to string the line on poles from Washington, D.C., to Baltimore; Samuel B. Morse successfully sent the message, “What hath God wrought” in 1844. Eastern High School and Western High School, for girls, opened.\n\n1845 – Construction on Lloyd Street Synagogue was completed. Frances Ellen Watkins Harper, an African-American abolitionist and poet who was born free in Baltimore, published her first book of poetry, Forest Leaves. Frederick Douglass, who escaped slavery in Baltimore in 1838, published his autobiographical Narrative\n\nKatie Rey Bogdan (Mrs. Pickersgill/Business Person #3) is making her CSC debut.
