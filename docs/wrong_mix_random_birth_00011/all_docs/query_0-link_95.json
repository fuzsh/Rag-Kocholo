        "text": "Whit Monday Picnics-called ‘Dutch Fourth of July’ (all Germans were called Dutch in those days). They most often picnicked at the Schutzen Parks.\n\nBig German Picnic-Defender’s Day September 12, which is the anniversary of the Battle of North Point. Picnic was usually held at Riverview Park. The picnic was usually held by the Independent Citizens Union which was composed of German residents. Years prior to 1901, German Day was celebrated on October 6 but about 1901 it was changed to September 12th to conform to the municipal holiday.\n\nGermans are also responsible for the mask ball (Fasching).\n\nIn 1983, the celebration of the Tricentennial of German Immigration gave birth to ‘October 6’ as German-American Day.\n\nActon’s Park-opposite side of old Light Street Bridge or Long Bridge.\n\nA March 8, 1892 NY Times article announces a ‘shooting contest’ that will take place at Acton’s Park, sponsored by the Interstate Manufacturers and Dealers Association to benefit the Baltimore Gun club, with prizes of $1000 and three classes, beginner to professional.\n\nAmusement Parks:\n\nBesides the many cultural outlets listed on this page, I am certain that our ancestors enjoyed the many amusement parks in and around Baltimore. Some of the better known and listed below entertained with rides, side shows, good food and drink, carnival amusements, etc. It is said that H.L. Mencken stated that it was the best way to, \"escape the horrors of reality\". It was also, unlike the parks of today, somewhere you could take the family on a limited income. In fact, most of the parks were free to enter. If a family just wanted to walk and enjoy the scenery it would cost nothing. Rides were paid for individually and usually didn't cost an arm and a leg. In fact, as a child, I remember the Gwynn Oak rides being about 5 cents. As you see below, there was something for everyone.\n\nHollywood Park\n\nProprietor Joe Goeller, was located on Back River and Eastern Avenue was the 'wild child' of the late 19th century amusement parks. It was described as 'den of iniquity' by some and even was condemned at one point by an investigation grand jury. The attractions here included home brewed beer and whiskey and side shows included tattooed women and other more seedy attractions. Another park along the river front in Baltimore county included Backus Park. Hollywood park was destroyed by fire in 1921.\n\nElectric Park\n\nLocated on Belvedere Avenue in the area of Reisterstown Road opened in the mid 1890s. The highlights here were a 'Wild West Show', a miniature exhibit which included the Johnstown flood and regular firework exhibitions. The park was lit with thousands of twinkle lights that reflected on the water below the promenades. I have read that they had one large attraction that simulated a washing machine, but it was a ride for humans and included a 'wringer' that could pass a large male. The park closed in 1916 and was torn down.\n\nRiverview Park\n\nLocated at Point Breeze off of Broening Highway opened in 1890. This was a more typical amusement park that included a roller coaster and other carnival rides. They also hosted many live attractions and hosted annually a reenactment of the Battle of the Alamo. They had a panorama that showed a 'Tour of the Alps'. They also had a swimming pool and a shooting gallery. One of the most popular parts of this park, however, was the bandstand and the talent that was drawn to play here. This was the home to many of the German Day Celebrations. The park closed in 1929. At that time Western Electric purchased the property. It is felt that the parks closure was directly related to prohibition.\n\nBay Shore Park\n\nOpened in 1907 was one of the newer resorts and had plenty of action rides including two roller coasters. There was also a bathing beach, water rides of that area including a large 'sea swing'. The park also had a 1000 foot 'Crystal Pier', which drew many of the patrons on a warm summer night...just a stroll on the pier. There was also a grandstand and musical guests. The park closed in 1948.\n\nCarlin's Park\n\nOpened in 1919 and was located at Liberty Heights Park, also known as 'Park Circle'. The part was opened by founder John Carlin. This park went beyond the amusement park and was truly an 'entertainment mecca'. The park included a large swimming pool, roller rink and an ice rink. The Palace hosted band concerts, dance contests and even some operas. This park also hosted a 'diving horse' similar to that touted by the great Steel Pier in Atlantic City. Many celebrities graced Carlin's stage included the great bandleaders like Tommy Dorsey and Benn Goodman. The park also had a host of rides including roller coasters and most teenagers favorite, the 'Olde Mill' and a forerunner to the famous 'Its a small world'. Carlin's closed in 1955 with the roller rink and the pool remaining open for several more years.\n\nGwynn Oak Park\n\nLocated on Liberty Road and Windsor Mill in the Woodlawn area. It opened in 1893 and I don't believe you will find anyone in that era that didn't have a Sunday School picnic or elementary school excursion to Gwynn Oak. Here were so many rides, including the roller coaster. My personal favorite as a child was the little goat carts near the entry and of course, the whip. The park also hosted a baseball diamond, ice skating rink, tennis courts, pleasure boating and the 'Dixie Ballroom'. There was something for everyone at Gwynn Oak. The park went through some tough times and was finally closed after destroyed by Tropical Storm Agnes in 1973. It was the longest operating park in Baltimore.\n\nArion Park\n\nThis park was purchased by the Arion Singing Society of Baltimore in 1910. It consisted of about seven acres of farmland just beyond the 4000 block of Wilkens Avenue. Here the Society built a central hall purpose hall, with a Ratskeller beneath it and a spacious beer garden surrounding the building. This hall was destroyed by fire in 1914, but rebuilt in the same year.\n\nIt is fondly remembered by many of the older Germans and was a central gathering point and the center of social life for many. Here they held their ox roasts, oyster roasts, crab feasts, school picnics and of course their singing competitions. Their specially built kitchen actually had a pit for roasting whole oxen and pig. You can imagine, with the number of German butchers in the area, what a feast one could have in one day. Here beer cost 5 cents for a 16 ounce beer. Actually, it was probably prohibition that killed Arion Park. The park was sold in 1923 and the Society moved to a headquarters building at 11 North Carey Street.\n\nArion Park held a giant celebration when prohibition ended. They held an old fashioned Volksfest (which had become a commercial picnic ground). The last big affair held at the park was the Cannstatter Volksfest (feast of the harvest) in 1939. This festival boasts the beginning of the monument of fruit (a mainstay in many of the German events, but especially the harvest event). The 1939 festival lasted 10 days. This year the monument was particularly festive with twenty-five different kinds of vegetables and fruits pegged to the 35 foot column. Two truckloads of produce (eggplant, squash, sweet and white potatoes, pumpkin, cabbage celery, beets, green peppers, radishes, onions, corn, red peppers, along with oranges, pineapples, limes, lemons, cucumbers, watermelons, citrons, pears, lettuce, turnips and bananas) were used. The event lasted for a few weeks with special evenings for different ethnic groups and special days for the various different county events.\n\nThe park was replaced by a residential area.\n\n[Sources: Baltimore Sunpaper, ‘Arion Park Monument Hail Autumn in Fruitful Regalia’, September 16, 1939, page 7; Baltimore Sunpaper, February 20, 1949, page SM2]\n\nBlob's Park\n\nFounded in 1933; PURPOSE: To provide a bit of the homeland for all to enjoy.\n\nBlob’s Park opened in 1933 in Jessup Maryland in Anne Arundel County. Admission at that time was 25 cents. It was home to Maryland’s first Oktoberfest in 1947. It was opened by Max Blob as prohibition ended. It was opened and remained a German Beer Garden for over 80 years. The original building was destroyed by fire in 1956, but was remarkably repaired and reopened within six weeks. The family of Max kept the business opened after his death in 1969. They built a new hall in 1976 and made the location of the old hall an outdoor pavilion in 1980.\n\nUnfortunately, the owner, John Eggerl, nephew of Max, retired and in 2007, New Years Eve, the last polka was played at Blob’s park, or so everyone thought. The property was sold to the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Baltimore but delays in development, etc., led to a reopening. It was the grand-nephew of Max, Max Eggerl that restored and renovated inside and out. He re-opened in 2009. Blob's Park was voted as the \"Best Place to Polka\" in Maryland by Baltimore Magazine and has been nationally televised on CNN News, Good Morning America and had featured articles many area Newspapers. Blob's featured a 2,500 square foot wooden dance floor with seating capacity for nearly 1,000 people, an outside Pavilion, a lighted parking lot, plus lots of great German/American food with full Bar and Restaurant facilities.\n\nUnfortunately, in 2014, the new property owners were ready to begin development and Blob’s closed for good on March 31, 2014. The property is scheduled to be razed the end of 2014.\n\nMax Eggerl, the nephew has since opened a new venture, the Bavarian Brauhaus, located in Hanover.\n\nYou Tube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1eFhSvZoPuE\n\nDancers from Blob’s still meet: http://blobsparksocialdanceclub.com/\n\nNewpaper photo of the Groundbreaking for the new Blob's Dancehall-1976*\n\nGerman Day at Blob's-Washington Journal-August 8, 1975*\n\nGerman Day at Blob's-Washington Journal-August 27, 1976*\n\nGerman Day at Blob's-Washington Journal-August 18, 1978*\n\n*Courtesy Kluge, Kuenzel, Brooke Family\n\nGermania Männerchor Hall\n\nThe architects were Lupus and Robey.192 and 194 West Lombard Street, has a seating capacity of 890 and a fully equipped stage.

By 1815, an elegant resort known as Fletcher’s Fish House operated on the south shore of the River, with a marina, restaurant and other facilities for recreation.\n\nRose House on Gay Street (established soon after the Revolutionary War by John Hart, a German resident) and at one time hosted many of Maryland’s prominent citizens. The second owner, William H. Rose gave it its’ reputation and many of the Holliday Street Theater actors would stop at the Rose House. Daniel Webster made the Rose House his headquarters when in Baltimore. Had an exclusive patronage between 1820 and 1850, when at that time seafaring men took the place of the local celebrities. The building was demolished to make room for Municipal Plaza.\n\nRaine's Hall, Comer of Baltimore Street and Post Office Avenue (now the site of the War Memorial Building), had a seating capacity of 600 and rented for Concerts, Lectures, &c., at $25 to $30 per night.

Frederick Street.\n\nSchlegel's was an Orchestra Hall and was the location of many German events in the Baltimore area.\n\n[Of ten years back, I built a dedicated Vergnuegungslocal Speciel German entertainment, which, as far as taste and elegance, cannot be surpassed. Carefully avoiding anything offensive, it is able to give me my establishment into a recreation space for families, and every night we find our Germans gathered in the company of woman and child in the juke-Hall. (From Souvenir book, page 42, ad)]\n\nSchlegel Ad 1887\n\nBaltimore Sunpaper December 14, 1898 'Hessen-Darmstaedter Ball'\n\nIt was purchased in 1900 by the newly formed 'Bavaria National Hall Association of Baltimore'. (incorporated in 1900 by August Strauff, John Munder, Frederick Jaecklein, John Winfelder and Engelbert Engels). The Association bought the Hall and turned it into a concert, theatre and dancing hall.\n\n[Source Baltimore Sunpaper May 10, 1900, page 7]\n\nSchützen Parks\n\nSchützen Parks in Baltimore were established by the Germans in the mid 1850’s. Most were recently emigrated and most were founded on the pooled resources of the new arrivals. They were established just outside the city limits as Schützen vereins…or shooting clubs. They became well established as more German immigrants arrived.\n\nThe parks would often host elaborate contests such as target shooting (both gun and archery), bowling competitions, etc. The grounds featured gardens, bowling alleys, dining halls, formal ballrooms, cottages, bars and of course, beer gardens.\n\nSouth-Western Schützen Park (where Carroll Park now stands)\n\nCarroll Park, Baltimore's third country landscape park (after Druid Hill and Patterson Parks), is significant for its association with the early development of the park system in Baltimore. Located in southwest Baltimore, Carroll Park is 117 acres. Originally part of the Mount Clare estate of Charles Carroll, Barrister. The park includes one of the oldest Federal style mansions still standing in Baltimore City. In the 30 years prior to becoming a park, the area surrounding Mt. Clare was leased from the Carroll’s and became Southwestern Schützen Park--a private recreation area used by German immigrants in Baltimore.\n\nThe Park was also called the Western Schützen and its’ inaugural procession was held on August 1, 1871. It included a huge parade that wove its way through Baltimore from Mechanics Hall to the park, which was at that time was located in the Southwestern suburbs. There were so many events including competitions, singing events by the many Baltimore choirs, amusements, etc. The first medals awarded to shooters that day include Charles Lemkuhl-Gold; Mr. Kramer of Baltimore and Mr. Beyer of Washington who vied the next morning for the other medal. The women Mrs. Mosaner, Mrs. Nolte, Mrs. Wm. Eckhardt, Mrs. Dietrach, Mrs. K. Eckhardt, Mrs. Vetter, Mrs. J. Eckhardt, Mrs. Kroh, Mrs. Horst, Mrs. Heisemann, Mrs. Carle, Mrs. Friede. (Sunpaper, August 1, 1871, Page 4.\n\nThe park offered a pastoral setting with carriageways and pedestrian walks was planted with trees, shrubs, and flower beds and included a picturesque Victorian conservatory. Carroll Park also hosted the German festival each year until 2008.\n\nEastern Schützen Park–out Gay Street\n\nGerman immigrants in Baltimore established a Schuetzenverein, or shooting club, in the 1850s. Shooting matches were often held between local and visiting individuals and teams, whose records of marksmanship were carefully preserved. In addition to a target range, the park's facilities included bowling alleys, a dining hall, ballroom, bar, billiard tables, and summertime accommodations for member families and their guests. There was a forty five acre park with numerous gardens. There were festivals held regularly and it has been reported that these festivals often drew crowds in excess of 50,000 for weekend events. The parks had multiple pavilions, tents, etc. The park was located on Belair Rd., which is now Gay Street in Baltimore City right near the city line. This was just blocks away from the Weissner, Rost’s, Jacob Seeger’s and Bauernschmidt Breweries who were more than happy to provide refreshments and featured their own beer gardens and music pavilions. The architects of the park were Lupus & Roby and in 1871 there were 800 members. Even though the clubs were for Germans and those of German ancestry, the parks were often open to the public for special events.\n\nThis 45 acre park also boasted formal gardens. The park had annual events in May and August. The public was often charged for entry. The events would last for several days and include special events for children such as magicians, dancers, clowns etc. Adults enjoyed dances, concerts and other events. Each evening usually ended with a fireworks display.\n\nEvery year a Schützenfest was held here where a ‘König’ (King) and ‘Königin’ (Queen) were crowned for the year. The Königin did not shoot, but was chosen by the president of the Society. It was a great day of festivities.\n\nThe Eastern Schützen sold most of their property in 1897. The mansion and banquet hall formerly owned by the Eastern Schützen Park Company was purchased by the Simpson-Doeller Company and was converted into a label printing establishment. The mansion was erected around 1800 and was the home of George Appold. (Baltimore Sunpaper, February 27, 1897)"
