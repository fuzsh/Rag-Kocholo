About Christmas Records Trust

A Very Special Christmas was founded by legendary record producer Jimmy Iovine, his then-wife Vicki and Bobby Shriver, son of Special Olympics Founder Eunice Shriver. Originally conceived as a way to pay tribute to Iovineâ€™s late father, the idea quickly evolved to include Special Olympics athletes as the beneficiaries.

Since then, ten more A Very Special Christmas albums have been released. In 1997, the Christmas Records Trust was established to manage and distribute assets generated by A Very Special Christmas sales. The Trust, overseen by Chairman Joseph Hakim and Trustees Vicki Iovine, Ossie Kilkenny, Brian Philips, and Bobby Shriver, generated over 3 million dollars in direct support Special Olympics Programs and athletes in 2013.
