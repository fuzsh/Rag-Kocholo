        "text": "To get into the holiday spirit we have put together a Christmas-themed art history, to that well-known carol you will undoubtedly be required to sing in between uncomfortable catch-ups with distant relatives.\n\nWe've had a browse through Art UK to present to you some of the finest selection of paintings illustrating the song, from fifteenth-century gold rings to nineteenth-century leaping lords.\n\nOn the first day of Christmas, my true love sent to me... A partridge in a pear tree\n\nA partridge and no pears, unfortunately, but hopefully some grapes and a pomegranate will do?\n\nDutch still lifes often included flowers, dead animals or exotic fruits, allowing artists to paint intricate detail and the reflection of light.\n\nOn the second day of Christmas, my true love sent to me... Two turtle doves\n\nTwo standard doves defying the laws of gravity.\n\nArt historians previously believed the sitter of this painting could be the Princess of Orange, before realising the assumption was slightly far-fetched.\n\nOn the third day of Christmas... well, you get the idea... Three French hens\n\n... Or several cockerels and hens – two of which appear to be French.\n\nFlemish painter Pieter Casteels seems to have been fond of poultry, especially hens, ducks and peacocks.\n\nFour colly birds\n\nThere are different versions of the song for the fourth day of Christmas including calling birds, mockingbirds and canaries. Here's a little assortment.\n\nTobias Stranover was born and raised in Transylvania and often depicted bird skirmishes.\n\nFive gold rings\n\nOne gold riiiiiiiing...\n\nAccording to The National Gallery, the sitter was either a goldsmith or soon-to-be married. He looks thrilled.\n\nSix geese a-laying\n\nWith an extra goose a-laying.\n\nThe Scottish landscape painter Edward Hargitt became a bird expert later in life, completing around 1,300 drawings of woodpeckers.\n\nSeven swans a-swimming\n\n...Or two swans neck wrestling.\n\nSpencer often depicted the countryside around the River Thames, which runs through the rural village Cookham, Berkshire – the artist's hometown.\n\nEight maids a-milking\n\nLet's switch the gender roles and have one man milking.\n\nNine ladies dancing\n\n...Or a dozen woodland nymphs dancing.\n\nWilliam Gale was a British painter and lesser-known artist of the Pre-Raphaelite school.\n\nTen lords a-leaping\n\nOne Lord (Shiva) dancing.\n\nEleven pipers piping\n\n... Or even better, hundreds of Scottish bagpipers. Dinna Ye Hear the Pipes?\n\nTwelve drummers drumming\n\nInstead, we have one happy baby.\n\nThat's the end of our lyrical art history. We hope we gifted you with the festive spirit.\n\nLydia Figes, Content Creator at Art UK"
