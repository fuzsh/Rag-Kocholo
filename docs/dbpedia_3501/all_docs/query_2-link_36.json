Take in a multicultural medieval world. See how a partnership led to a wholly new, radical artistic language.

Hailed by The Washington Post for their \"fluent expressivity\", the trio celebrates the holiday season with eight centuries of carols, chants, folk songs, traditional tunes, and ecclesiastic music.\n\nThe Met Cloisters\n\nMedieval ‘Christmastide’ Decorations\n\nFrom December 14, 2023, through January 7, 2024\n\nHolly boughs symbolizing light, warmth, and welcome adorn the great archway, and the Main Hall boasts grand displays of fresh ivy and hand-polished lady apples, hazelnuts, rose hips, and pine cones, all locally sourced.\n\nRich Man, Poor Man: Art, Class, and Commerce in a Late Medieval Town\n\nThrough February 4, 2024\n\nThis exhibition examines the emergence of distinctly middle-class taste in late medieval England by showcasing a rare set of large-scale domestic sculptures from Exeter.\n\nHoliday Shopping and Dining\n\nShop Art-Inspired Gifts at The Met Store\n\nExplore more than 100 new arrivals—scarves, jewelry, home decor, kids’ gifts, and so much more—for the holiday season.\n\nGrab a Bite\n\nFrom December 7 to January 9, The Met Dining Room will be serving a decadent four-course holiday-themed tasting menu. For more casual dining options, delight in festive beverages and snacks at the American Wing Cafe, the Petrie Court Cafe, the Great Hall Balcony Cafe, and The Eatery.
