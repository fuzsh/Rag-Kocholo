        "text": "Cover artist for this issue Otway Life, we ask Lynette about her art practise\n\nLiving in a delightful cottage in Barongarook, surrounded by gardens and natural bush, Lynette creates her art from what she sees around her.\n\nWhen did you start creating art and what inspires you?\n\nAs a little girl, my mother, also an artist, would take us down to the back paddock and part the grasses to show us the wildflowers. It was like discovering tiny treasures, so wildflowers have always been special to me and the spark to create my bush flower designs.\n\nMy father never wanted me to have colouring books and encouraged me to create my own art as a child and I continued to draw and paint through school. At 18 I went to art school in Geelong and learnt a lot. Then I got busy with having a family but I always continued with my art which included illustrating books, interior design and window design.\n\n15 years ago, after the kids had grown, I enrolled in an art course in Colac with Salvina Conti as tutor and I felt motivated to create the bush flower card designs which continue today.\n\nI usually only paint what gladdens my eyes and touches my heart, so I don’t paint for profit but hope what I create will touch someone else and inspire them to want to buy the work. My portrait paintings are of people I know so I can capture the spirit in their eyes. It is so important otherwise the portrait looks dull and lifeless.\n\nWhat mediums do you like to use?\n\nI explore most mediums although I prefer to work fast so I don’t use oils. I like watercolours for the bush flowers as the medium suits their light and impressionistic style. I don’t consider my works to be botanically exact as I prefer them to have heart rather than concise detail and I like to create a composition.\n\nI use gauche on more stylised artworks like my wooden painted leaves, to cut back to the main features and simplify the colour palette.\n\nWhat are you working on now?\n\nI am busy putting together Christmas orders to send to outlets. I have had work for sale at Federation Square and Australian by Design in the Block Arcade in Melbourne, Montsalvat in Eltham, The Wool Museum in Geelong, and places as far afield as Alice Springs and the Grampians as well as local outlets in Timboon, Apollo Bay, Ferguson, Forrest and Colac.\n\nI use my designs on a range of products including natural organic cotton tote bags, aprons and makeup purses, mirrors and bookmarks as well as cards. I recently branched out into Christmas designs on chocolate through Mandy at Platypi Chocolates which is exciting.\n\nMy niece Monica Provan is a glass artist and jewellery maker and we have collaborated to produce a range of glass earrings and pendants that incorporate my artwork. I am pleased that two of my granddaughters, Syria and Claudia are accomplished emerging artists.\n\nI am a member of Studio Forrest art group and we are currently preparing for our end of year exhibition. I enjoy being in the company of the other artists where we can swap ideas and it inspires me to try new things."
