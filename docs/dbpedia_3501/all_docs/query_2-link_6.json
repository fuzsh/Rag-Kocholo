        "text": "Geertgen tot Sint Jans (meaning ‘little Gerard of Saint John’) was an Early Netherlandish painter who died at the young age of 28. Not much is known about him, yet he gave us one of the most beautiful interpretations of the birth of Jesus in his “Nativity at Night.” It has been called “one of the most engaging and convincing early treatments of the Nativity as a night scene”.\n\nA brilliant light in the foreground comes from Jesus as he lay in the crib, illuminating his mother, Mary. As she bends forward with her hands in prayer, we see Joseph standing in the background. We see a second contrast between dark and light as the angel announces the birth of Jesus to the shepherds. The shepherd’s fire gives us a third and lesser light source.\n\nIn the 14th-century, St. Bridget of Sweden wrote of the idea of the infant illuminating the Nativity scene. She wrote that the light of the child was so bright ‘that the sun was not comparable to it’. A century later, Geertgen creates this idea by using extreme contrasts of light and dark to heighten the sense of the miraculous birth of Jesus.\n\nConsidered the most important German artist of his generation, Caspar David Friedrich was a 19th-century German Romantic landscape painter. In “Winter Landscape,” Friedrich combines a landscape motif with religious symbolism, a common style seen in many of his works. This painting represents the hope for salvation through the Christian faith. We see a crippled man in the foreground who has abandoned his crutches. He rests against a rock before a crucifix with his hands raised in prayer. He has arrived at his destination. The man feels hope at the sight of Jesus on the cross. The hope of the resurrection. The Gothic church in the background mimics the shape of the trees in the foreground. As it emerges from the mist and rises from the ground, it symbolizes the promise of life after death."
