        "text": "The Santa Claus we all know and love â that big, jolly man in the red suit with a white beard â didnât always look that way. In fact, many people are surprised to learn that prior to 1931, Santa was depicted as everything from a tall gaunt man to a spooky-looking elf. He has donned a bishop's robe and a Norse huntsman's animal skin. In fact, when Civil War cartoonist Thomas Nast drew Santa Claus for Harper's Weekly in 1862, Santa was a small elflike figure who supported the Union. Nast continued to draw Santa for 30 years, changing the color of his coat from tan to the red heâs known for today.\n\nHere, a few other things you may not have realized about the cheerful guy in the red suit.\n\n2. Coca‑Cola Helped Shape the Image of Santa\n\nIn 1931 the company began placing Coca‑Cola ads in popular magazines. Archie Lee, the D'Arcy Advertising Agency executive working with The Coca‑Cola Company, wanted the campaign to show a wholesome Santa who was both realistic and symbolic. So Coca‑Cola commissioned Michigan-born illustrator Haddon Sundblom to develop advertising images using Santa Claus â showing Santa himself, not a man dressed as Santa.\n\nFor inspiration, Sundblom turned to Clement Clark Moore's 1822 poem \"A Visit From St. Nicholas\" (commonly called \"'Twas the Night Before Christmas\"). Moore's description of St. Nick led to an image of a warm, friendly, pleasantly plump and human Santa. (And even though it's often said that Santa wears a red coat because red is the color of Coca‑Cola, Santa appeared in a red coat before Sundblom painted him.)\n\nSundblomâs Santa debuted in 1931 in Coke ads in The Saturday Evening Post and appeared regularly in that magazine, as well as in Ladies Home Journal, National Geographic, The New Yorker and others.\n\nFrom 1931 to 1964, Coca‑Cola advertising showed Santa delivering toys (and playing with them!), pausing to read a letter and enjoy a Coke, visiting with the children who stayed up to greet him, and raiding the refrigerators at a number of homes. The original oil paintings Sundblom created were adapted for Coca‑Cola advertising in magazines and on store displays, billboards, posters, calendars and plush dolls. Many of those items today are popular collectibles.\n\nSundblom created his final version of Santa Claus in 1964, but for several decades to follow, Coca‑Cola advertising featured images of Santa based on Sundblomâs original works. These paintings are some of the most prized pieces in the art collection in the companyâs archives department and have been on exhibit around the world, in famous locales including the Louvre in Paris, the Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto, the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago, the Isetan Department Store in Tokyo, and the NK Department Store in Stockholm. Many of the original paintings can be seen on display at World of Coca‑Cola in Atlanta, Ga.\n\n3. The \"New Santa\" Was Based on a Salesman\n\nIn the beginning, Sundblom painted the image of Santa using a live model â his friend Lou Prentiss, a retired salesman. When Prentiss passed away, Sundblom used himself as a model, painting while looking into a mirror. Finally, he began relying on photographs to create the image of St. Nick.\n\nPeople loved the Coca‑Cola Santa images and paid such close attention to them that when anything changed, they sent letters to The Coca‑Cola Company. One year, Santa's large belt was backwards (perhaps because Sundblom was painting via a mirror). Another year, Santa Claus appeared without a wedding ring, causing fans to write asking what happened to Mrs. Claus.\n\nThe children who appear with Santa in Sundblomâs paintings were based on Sundblom's neighbors â two little girls. So he changed one to a boy in his paintings.\n\nThe dog in Sundblomâs 1964 Santa Claus painting was actually a gray poodle belonging to the neighborhood florist. But Sundblom wanted the dog to stand out in the holiday scene, so he painted the animal with black fur."
