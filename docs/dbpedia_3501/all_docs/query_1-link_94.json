        "text": "Alternative rock legends, arena rock gods, a horde of ‘90s hit-makers, one of the most recognizable (yet anonymous) voices of the ‘60s and the heir to Joe Cocker’s throne are some of concert highlights in May.\n\nI’m getting too old for this (expletive)\n\nDarlene Love, May 7, The Hanover Theatre for the Performing Arts, Worcester. Also, May 6, Lynn Auditorium, Lynn.\n\nGoing from being a minister’s daughter to a Rock and Roll Hall of Famer, Darlene Love has hit the top of the charts (with 1962’s “He’s the Rebel”), has recorded a classic Christmas song (with “Christmas [Baby Please Come Home]”) and even played the wife of Officer Roger Murtaugh (Danny Glover) in the “Lethal Weapon” film series. If that isn’t cool enough, Love contributed backing vocals behind many of the '60s biggest hits, including the Ronettes' “Be My Baby,” Shelley Fabares' “Johnny Angel,” Bobby \"Boris\" Pickett's “Monster Mash,” Frank Sinatra's “That’s Life” and the Crystals' “Da Doo Ron Ron”. Furthermore, this singular talent, who once had a weekly gig on “Shindig!” and appeared on “Elvis Presley’s ’68 Comeback Special,” recorded songs written by Bruce Springsteen, Joan Jett and Elvis Costello (on 2015’s “Introducing Darlene Love”) and made a big splash in the Academy Award-winning documentary “20 Feet From Stardom.” What’s not to love?\n\nSweatin’ to the ‘90s\n\n“I Love the ‘90s … The Party Continues,” May 12, DCU Center, Worcester.\n\nYou’ve been warned. If you are a fan of Naugthy By Nature’s “Hip Hop Hooray,” Kid ‘N Play’s “Funhouse,” Blackstreet’s “No Diggity,” Sisqo’s “Thong Song,” Montell Jordan’s “This Is How We Do It,” Sugar Ray’s (aka Mark McGrath’s) “Fly,” Biz Markie’s “Just a Friend,” Rob Base’s “Get on the Dance Floor,” C+C Music Factory’s “Gonna Make You Sweat (Everybody Dance Now)” and Chubb Rock’s “The Chubbster,” all sung by the original ‘90s stars, then this is going to be the show for you. For everyone else, you’re a glutton for punishment.\n\nObey your master! Master!\n\nMetallica, May 19, Gillette Stadium, Foxboro\n\nThe heavy-metal, Napster-bashing Metallica is back to full nuclear-strike capability with the band’s sixth consecutive chart-topper “Hardwired ...To Self Destruct” and they are taking their full-throttle, take-no-prisoners, seek-and-destroy, special ops mission (aka live concert) to Gillette Stadium. Proving that they are still the undisputed masters of metal and still have plenty of teeth, talons and toughness to tear many of their contemporaries apart, the San Francisco quartet (consisting of singer-rhythm guitarist James Hetfield, lead guitarist Kirk Hammett, bassist Rob Trujillo and drummer Lars Ulrich) hasn't shown this much muscle, menace or mettle since 1986's \"Master of Puppets.\"\n\nSheffield Steel: The Next Generation\n\nCocker Rocks: Elliott Tuffin & the Joe Cocker Band, May 19, 20 and 21, Bull Mansion, Worcester.\n\nWith a little help from Joe Cocker’s friends, the music and spirit of Cocker is being kept alive and moving on to the next chapter with Cocker Rocks: Elliott Tuffin & the Joe Cocker Band. Not only do they celebrate the rich legacy and music of the late Joe Cocker, Cocker Rocks is an exuberant continuation of it. Original Joe Cocker Band members (and Worcester musical institutions) Mitch Chakour, Deric Dyer and Cliff Goodwin, along with seasoned veterans Wolf Ginandes, Marty Richards and Meagan Wolf, have joined forces with West London pub singer Elliott Tuffin, and the result is a show worthy of the rock ‘n’ roll history books. While the band is piping hot (as expected) it seems as though Tuffin has been completely taken over by Cocker's spirit, sounding more and more like Cocker as the evening progressed.\n\nHere Comes Your Man\n\nThe Pixies, May 19 and 20, House of Blues, Boston, and May 21, Paradise Rock Club, Boston.\n\nUncompromising, unorthodox and unglued, Boston’s alternative darlings the Pixies, whose “loud-quiet-loud” dynamic influenced Nirvana, Radiohead, Pearl Jam and countless other bands, still sound different than anything that has come down the pike since their ‘80s heyday. Joining Black Francis on their latest Pixies revival are guitarist Joey Santiago, drummer David Lovering and bassist Paz Lenchantin, replacing a sadly missed Kim Deal who jumped (space)ship in 2013.\n\nAnd the rest:\n\nTycho, May 1, House of Blues, Boston.\n\nSomo, May 3, House of Blues.\n\nTransatlantic Sessions, May 3, Orpheum Theatre, Boston.\n\nKris Kristofferson, May 3, The Wilbur, Boston.\n\nLea Michele, May 4, Fox Theater, Foxwoods, Mashantucket, Conn.\n\nSix Appeal, May 4, The Hanover Theatre for the Performing Arts.\n\nThe Damned, May 4, The Paradise Rock Club, Boston\n\nPaul Shaffer & The World’s Most Dangerous Band, May 4, The Wilbur.\n\nJulianne and Derek Hough, May 5, Boch Center Wang Theatre, Boston.\n\nSteve Daggett, May 5, Fox Theater, Foxwoods.\n\nForeigner, May 5, Grand Theater at Foxwoods,\n\nMayday, May 5, House of Blues.\n\nSoul2Soul, May 5, Mohegan Sun Arena, Uncasville, Conn.\n\nThe Black Angel, May 5, Paradise Rock Club.\n\nTommy Tune, May 6, The Fox Theater.\n\nDwight Yoakam, May 6, House of Blues.\n\nCorrosion, May 6, House of Blues.\n\nSoul2Soul, May 6, Mohegan Sun Arena.\n\nPink Talking Fish, May 6, Paradise Rock Club.\n\nJacob Sartorius, May 6, The Wilbur.\n\nKillswitch Engage, May 7, House of Blues.\n\nNeed To Breathe, May 7, The Fox Theater.\n\nMastodon, May 8, House of Blues.\n\nCoheed and Cambria, May 9, Blue Hills Bank Pavilion, Boston.\n\nThe Zombies, May 9, The Wilbur.\n\nRyan Adams, May 10, Blue Hills Bank Pavilion.\n\nMidnight Oil, May 11, House of Blues.\n\nEmpire of the Sun, May 12, Blue Hills Bank Pavilion.\n\n‘70s Soul Jam, May 12, Grand Theater at Foxwoods.\n\nFlight of Fire, May 12, House of Blues.\n\nBayside and Say Anything, May 12, The Palladium, Worcester.\n\nMary J.
