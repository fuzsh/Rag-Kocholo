        "text": "Humans are complex, so shouldn’t music be too?\n\nOnly the psychology of music genres can explain why I could be in the mood for some R&B today and prefer to listen to house music tomorrow.\n\nJust like we have different emotions, each feeling corresponds to a different type of music.\n\nWhat worked yesterday may not work today, and what works today may not work tomorrow.\n\nMusic, the universal language, speaks to each of us in unique dialects. It speaks for us when our words fail us. It motivates us when we have no energy or inspiration to drive ourselves and calms us when we don’t know how to do it.\n\nBut what inspires one person irritates the other. We gravitate towards specific genres and have no idea why we love what we love.\n\nIs it our biology?\n\nIs it based on how we feel or even the weather?\n\nLet’s explore the psychology behind music genres and what makes us like some genres and dislike others.\n\nIt starts with your childhood. Exposure to certain music during your childhood leaves an indelible mark.\n\nOne study revealed that the music we listen to during the adolescent stage helped create our musical taste and identity, i.e., music released during the ages of 12 to 22 years.\n\nFamiliar melodies become comfort blankets, evoking warm memories and a sense of belonging.\n\nThis explains why hits of our youth hold a special place in our hearts, even if we wouldn’t admit it to anyone under 30 (shush!).\n\nFor me, it’s the 80’s of Lionel Richie and Whitney Houston, the unforgettable R&B, hip-hop and pop music from the ’90s – TLC, Backstreet Boys, 2Pac, SWV, and Mariah Carey, and more R&B, hip-hop, pop and alternative rock from the 2000s – Eminem, Nelly, Rihanna, Chris Brown, Destiny’s Child, 50 Cent, Evanescence, Breaking Benjamin, Linkin Park and Ne-Yo to name a few out of a list that is way too long.\n\nWhen we say music is a universal language, we mean that we may come from different countries, speak varied languages, and follow unique cultures, and yet music has no boundaries.\n\nIt doesn’t require people to know a language to feel and enjoy music, embodying who we are in a 3-minute song.\n\nAnd you’re not alone. Millions of people listen to the same song and feel the same way.\n\nIs this surprising or just ordinary?\n\nOne study revealed a positive association between the big five personality types and music preferences known as the MUSIC preference model (Mellow, Unpretentious, Sophisticated, Intense and Contemporary) across the globe.\n\nPeople who tend to have the extraversion trait, i.e., adventurous, social and embody positivity, prefer contemporary music, i.e., rhythmic, upbeat, and electronic-based music.\n\nThose who relate to the conscientiousness trait, i.e., organised, responsible, and hard-working, prefer mellow, romantic, relaxing, and uncomplicated music over intense music styles, such as distorted, aggressive, and loud music.\n\nOthers who tend to have the openness trait, i.e., imaginative, creative, and insightful, prefer sophisticated, intense, contemporary, and mellow music.\n\nSo, the next time you find yourself headbanging to heavy metal or swaying to a soulful serenade, remember it’s more than just the music.\n\nThe psychology of music genres states that the music we listen to is a reflection of who we are, a window into our emotional world, and a testament to the universal language that transcends words, uniting us through the magic of sound.\n\nNow, tell me: what tune stirs your soul? What genre speaks to your heart?\n\nShare your musical story in the comments below, and let’s turn this blog post into a global jam session."
