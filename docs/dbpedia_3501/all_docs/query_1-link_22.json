        "text": "Welcome to a very special issue of the Johto Times! Today in issue 43, we are excited to share an interview with four members of the musical group Johto, who were responsible for most of the songs on the Totally Pokémon and the third Pokémon movie soundtracks, including Pokémon Johto (Do-do-do, do, do-do), and Pokérap GS.\n\nAs we head into December, the Johto Times team will be winding down for the remainder of 2023, but we have newsletters scheduled to go out automatically to subscribers. As a result, news and mailbag content will be taking a back seat until after the new year.\n\nNews\n\nIf you live in London, get yourself over to the North Atrium in Westfield London, where a five-metre-tall holiday tree has been erected, featuring over 800 Pokémon Center plush toys! This festive photo opportunity began on November 23rd 2023, and will remain until December 4th. Share your photographs on Instagram with @PokemonNewsUK and include the hashtag #pokemoncenteruk for an opportunity to win one of twelve giant Pikachu plushies! Full details can be found on the link below:\n\nSource: Pokémon\n\nAs we bring our news coverage to a close for the year, here are some key dates to look out for over the month of December:\n\nDecember 1st 2023: Pokémon Horizons: The Series on BBC iPlayer (United Kingdom)\n\nDecember 14th 2023: Part 2 of Pokémon Scarlet & Violet’s DLC “The Indigo Disk”\n\nDecember 16th & Sunday, December 17th 2023: Pokémon GO December Community days\n\nDecember 28th 2023: Pokémon Concierge on Netflix\n\nFeature: Interview with Johto\n\nWe are thrilled to be interviewing the former band Johto, who were a sextet that performed the majority of songs for the official Totally Pokémon soundtrack, which released on January 23rd, 2001, some of which were re-released on Pokémon 3: The Ultimate Soundtrack, on April 3rd 2001 in North America. We were fortunate enough to speak to four of the six band members about their experience working on the album!\n\nIt’s wonderful to speak to you all about your band, Johto. Could you please introduce yourselves to our readers?\n\nShareef:\n\nHello! I’m Shareef. Thanks for interviewing us!\n\nÉlan:\n\nHi. This is Élan, one of the female lead singers in the group. I am a New Yorker of Mixed races: Black, Puerto Rican, Cherokee and European. I grew up performing and did Broadway prior. I did a Fire Safety Video with rap and singing. The late Gilbert Godfrey was the narrator if you search for it on YouTube, lol.\n\nShwaun:\n\nMy name is Jamily Gray, but I go by Shwaun Gray.\n\nPJ:\n\nPJ Lequerica here. I've sung on many commercial jingles (Folgers, Ford, Herbal Essences, Foxwoods, Dr. Pepper), backgrounds on other artists' albums (e.g., Marc Anthony, Lionel Richie, Anastasia, Bernie Williams, Rosie O'Donnel's Christmas/Elton John...), movie soundtracks (Bride & Prejudice, Pokémon 3), other cartoons (Disco Cops) and had a development deal with Sony for a period of time.\n\nA company called Rave Music, best known for creating the music and score for the Pokémon anime, were responsible for hand-picking you all for the band. What can you tell us about the audition process?\n\nShareef:\n\nWow!!! That was years ago! Let me get my memory in order! Lol!!! I found out about this in the village voice newspaper. They were looking for singers to record songs for the Pokémon project! At that time I had no knowledge of Pokémon! I said to myself “what’s a Pokémon?”, lol!!! I can sing so let me check it out! I auditioned for them, I believe I sang “Bridge over troubled water” it was just me and the producers in the room. There were other singers waiting outside.\n\nWhen I arrived there weren’t a lot of people so the audition process was fast. After my audition I went home and there was [a] phone message for me saying they loved my voice and want me to work on the project! After that I met the other singers Elan, Jolan, Shauna, Shwaun, and PJ.. we started recording and boom!!! They gave us the group name Johto!\n\nÉlan:\n\nSo we had to Dub some vocals in a studio and the Gotta Be Cool Song was produced at Rave Music on 23rd Street. When John Siegler heard me in the studio he brought me in for the Pokémon group. Jamily actually explained it to me that I was already in the group because our audition process was different. I guess I can thank the fire safety campaign for booking me to sing there a few weeks before the auditions. One good thing leads to another.\n\nAt what would be the final callbacks I met the “finalists” and we all sang in front of each other. Everyone was so good. Jamily and I are Geminis so we were totally sizing each other up for best riffs and outfit lol. He’s still a great friend of mine so I can say that. Just saw him July 4th as I live by lots of the firework action.\n\nShareef has such a soulful voice. Shawna is still adorable. PJ is multifaceted. He hits notes higher than me and played piano. Jolan was a force of energy that imbibed the Johto spirit.\n\nShwaun:\n\nI remember auditioning on the day and being picked on the same day. I remember attempting to dress as much like a Pokémon master as I could. They took a picture of us on that day, I’d have to find it.\n\nPJ:\n\nI remember it feeling a little bit like American Idol. Waiting outside in the hallway and being called in one at a time. We had 3 - 4 judges as well. Auditioning acapella is stressful, but your true voice shines through that way.\n\nDid you know that you were auditioning for Pokémon at the time, and were you familiar with the series prior to this?\n\nShareef:\n\nYes but I wasn’t familiar with the series.\n\nÉlan:\n\nYes, I did know that I was brought in for the project. And I watched Pokémon on Channel 11 here in Manhattan after school. I was still a teenager and one of the youngest in the group.\n\nShwaun:\n\nYes & yes\n\nPJ:\n\nYes, my management knew it was for a group being \"launched by Pokémon\". I was familiar with the series as well, so it was exciting - I knew how popular the series was already.\n\nHow did you feel once you knew you were chosen to be a part of Johto?\n\nShareef:\n\nExcited!!!! It felt great working on my passion recording everyday the other artist were cool to work with & getting paid for it!\n\nÉlan:\n\nI think we were all pretty excited. We took a great happy photo at the final audition meetup. We looked awesome lol\n\nShwaun:\n\nI was excited to be getting a gig. I had been a part of a groups at least 3 times before, so I wasn’t new to being with bands. Honestly, I was hesitant to take the gig because it wasn’t the direction I wanted to go with my career. But a gig is a gig.\n\nPJ:\n\nI was so excited when I heard I was chosen. I knew there would be a lot of work to do, but singing has always been such a great outlet for me, I was up for whatever was to come my way.\n\nWhat were your first impressions of the material you were working with?\n\nShareef:\n\nI’m an R&B soul recording artist so I was having a little struggle with the material. But I was able to adjust. The Pokémon rap song was a struggle! the producer kept telling me to be more animated! Lol!\n\nÉlan:\n\nI was very excited to record this album and learn new techniques in recording and layering vocals. Rave Music, 4Kids and some of the nearby studios who also wrote on the song were amazing musicians, songwriters, engineers, some sang and, of course, top notch producers. They wrote great songs and jingles for major commercials, many cartoons and a variety of musical products and productions.\n\nI think they generally picked who might take what song before we ever heard them. The songs were fully developed before we arrived and there were demo singers or producers singing on the tracks so we could hear the full idea, give guidance and practice the songs. The harmonies were also recorded but we put some of our individuality on what we refer to as “riffs” in R&B and Pop.\n\nPJ was first up with the theme song. Shauna was perfect for Jigglypuff. I was perfect for the Latin Pikachu song although PJ and Jamily would have crushed it so it’s great I got to do a duet with them later.\n\nShwaun:\n\nVery late ‘90s pop music which isn’t my style. I didn’t feel I fit the mold with my R&B/soul background. However, I am a fan of the songs I was chosen to sing with Elan & Shauna.\n\nPJ:\n\nI was actually surprised at how \"pop\" the songs were. I was anticipating more of an immature production, but the songs could be radio, if the Pokemon lyrical elements were replaced. Great writers/producers.\n\nDid you have any creative input in your performances?\n\nShareef:\n\nA little! On “Never Too Far From Home” I was able to put some R&B flavor on the song. The producers were pleased!\n\nÉlan:\n\nOur personal Vocal style was probably the only creative contribution I think most groups have in the beginning.\n\nShwaun:\n\nOutside of the vocal acrobatics, I pretty much followed their instructions.\n\nPJ:\n\nI did. For songs I was lead on, the producers let me improvise a lot, both with the lead vocals, as well as harmony ideas I would have. There was a mutual respect, which was fantastic!!!\n\nThe album was called Totally Pokémon, and released on January 23, 2001 in North America. How long did it take to make the album, and what can you tell us about the recording process?\n\nShareef:\n\nIt didn’t take that long to make the album. The process was pretty fast! Songs were already written and had reference vocals so it was easy for us! We just added our vocal flavor to the songs! I believe we recorded every week. We would arrive in the morning, there would be different recording rooms. Elan & Shwaun would record their lead vocals that day and then we all would come in and add the background vocals! You know, everyday a different process.\n\nÉlan:\n\nWe did all the vocals in two weeks!\n\nShwaun:\n\nI remember it being done in a short period of time during the prior summer. I was called in for just 2 or 3 days for my parts. I am sure Elan & PJ were there for much longer. I remember being in 2 different studios within proximity in midtown Manhattan. I remember having fun. I remember the producer yelling at me through the glass to give him more Marvin Gaye on the song All We Wanna Do. I remember thinking… Marvin Gaye wouldn’t do this song.\n\nPJ:\n\nI feel like it took a few months - hard to remember details from back then, but we definitely got into a flow with the recording schedule. The recording process was pretty standard. Many times the soloists would be recording in one vocal room while backgrounds for other songs were happening simultaneously in another room. The other group members were a lot of fun, too, so it was definitely a positive experience, even when not recording.\n\nQuite a few of the tracks were available on Pokémon 3: The Ultimate Soundtrack, giving them a second chance. What were your thoughts on the decision to include them as part of that release?\n\nShareef:\n\nI didn’t think much of it. I wasn’t familiar with Pokémon, I was just excited to be working.\n\nÉlan:\n\nA lot of labels repackage a first album with one or two bonuses or remixes. Pretty standard smart business. I just wish we did a mall tour or video. We did a few weeks of dance rehearsals to the songs and everyone could dance. So impressive but there was no acting manager for the whole group and that’s difficult when people already show up to an audition with super agents or managers. We all wanted to do it though and practiced hard. Womp womp\n\nShwaun:\n\nI thought it was great. Though our band project was seemingly defunct at the end of that pop band era, the Pokémon 3 soundtrack kept our music going. I truly believe we were underutilized.\n\nPJ:\n\nI definitely thought it was another opportunity for the songs to be heard, and for the awareness of the \"Totally Pokémon\" album. We did re-record some things for the soundtrack (e.g., the theme song used a new music track and become a duet with myself and Élan). It was fun to explore a new take on that song.\n\nWhat are your favourite tracks from Totally Pokémon?\n\nShareef:\n\nPokémon Johto, Pikachu (I Choose You), He Drives Me Crazy. Never Too Far From Home. PokéRap GS. Just to name a few.\n\nÉlan:\n\nIdk if I have a fav but I always thought Shareef’s song was a standout R&B soul moment that they have never ventured to before or after this album.\n\nShwaun:\n\nJigglypuff, All We Wanna Do, He Drives Me Crazy, You & Me & Pokémon, Never Too Far From Home… and oddly enough… the PokéRap (it was fun doing it).\n\nPJ:\n\nI liked most of the songs on the album for different reasons, but two that stand out were \"The Biggest Part of my Life\" and \"You & Me (and Pokémon)\".\n\nTo your recollection, were there any tracks that you were working on that didn’t make it to the final release?\n\nShareef:\n\nThere was a song called “All Around The World.” Coko from SWV vocals were on that song and the producers were planning on having me on the song, but it never happened.\n\nÉlan:\n\nAll tracks made it in if I can recall properly.\n\nShwaun:\n\nNot that I remember.\n\nPJ:\n\nFrom what I remember, everything I worked on was included in the release. I can't remember anything that wasn't part of the final project.\n\nAccording to a press release dating back to August 2nd 2000, Rave Music were planning to tour the band, but this never materialised. Can you enlighten us to why it didn’t happen, and what the plans for the tour were?\n\nShareef:\n\nI have no clue on why it never happened, I know during that time I was disappointed when I got the call they weren’t going on with the project. We had finished up weeks of dance rehearsals and were getting close to doing a music video. The label did mention to us that there would be a tour. So we were excited about that but it never happened! That’s all I know!\n\nShwaun:\n\nI couldn’t tell you why other than that the pop band era was dying. We started learning dance moves for songs, so it was really happening. It could also be a chemistry thing with the band. Elan may have more insight.\n\nPJ:\n\nFrom what I was told, we were supposed to travel to a few countries, but the night before the video shoot for the theme song, the record label dropped the group (Koch Records). I'm not entirely sure what the reasons were, but there was talk about issues around the budget (or lack thereof). I remember talk about Australia and Canada, but I can't remember if there were any other solid plans for other countries included.\n\nIn the years since the band were active making music, what have you all been getting up to?\n\nShareef:\n\nAfter Pokémon ended throughout the years I've continued on with my passion for music in the studio recording, singing background for other artists, etc... I recently released a song on January 20 2023: “Turn up let a mufucka know,” available on all streaming platforms. My artist name is Shareef Ali. www.blackbuttasoul.biz Feel free to follow me on all my social media platforms links on my website.\n\nÉlan:\n\nAfter our work together in this, a few of us worked together in each others bands, recordings, writings or just went to each others shows, which was great. Jamily and I see each other often since I moved to Brooklyn and is like a family member and hangs with my partner even when I’m not there. I hope we will do a song together one day soon.\n\nI did a Broadway show soon after Johto. I was signed to Sony Records with my group The DEY. We were more famous in Asia… ironically for a Spanish English hip hop group. I have a prog rock band with my partner called Sacrificial Lamb. Jamily filmed our pre-Covid video of Afterimage soon after the drummer from Rush passed away.\n\nShwaun:\n\nImmediately after I started singing in a band backing Luther Vandross, and he was going to sign us to his new production company. Unfortunately, [he] had a stroke and died some time after. I had a daughter in 2002, so my music career took a major backseat. I would produce music for others from my home studio, and I am still very close with Élan (she performed a song that I wrote a few years after). She may have told you this story, but her mom pretty much chose me to be friends with her when we met back at the studios… and I call her mother mom to this day.\n\nI have performed backup singing for Élan whenever she asked and supported whatever project she was in. I believe Élan was the most successful of us all. I would also see Shariff perform whenever he was on stage. Shauna and I were close for a moment, but she moved to Hawaii which was a great move for her, and I stay in the know with her through social media. I am so proud of Shauna!! She is out there living the life I dreamed I would… performing at venues and releasing her albums (recently). I never had a relationship with PJ or Jolan.\n\nPJ:\n\nI had been involved in a few projects after the Pokémon release, but most were studio recordings or one-off projects - not many public performances at that point.\n\nWhat lessons did you learn from Johto that you’ve taken with you through your career since?\n\nShareef:\n\nThere will always be a lesson in whatever you do. When there’s a good thing in front of you, hold on to it! Never let go. Action speaks louder than words! Don’t let disappointments make you bitter. Keep the faith and always trust GOD!\n\nÉlan:\n\nThe recording process was a great lesson and a little short course or trial on contracts and things to come.\n\nShwaun:\n\nGreat question… nothing in life is guaranteed… and you never know when you’re going to meet someone that will stay in your life forever, so pay attention 🙂\n\nPJ:\n\nI learned that hard work pays off, but that belief in yourself can make a huge difference as well. I also enjoyed the collaborative elements of the project - both with the other group members, as well as with the writers/producers and choreographer (yes, we had some dance/choreography rehearsals before the label dropped the project).\n\nIf there was an opportunity to come back and record more music for Pokémon, would you take it?\n\nShareef:\n\nYes! It’s a job and I love recording!\n\nÉlan:\n\nI would totally do the group again. I loved our video mash up we did in 2020.\n\nShwaun:\n\nOf course! We did just work on that project remotely over a year ago. We re-sang the parts from our home studios\n\nPJ:\n\nDefinitely!\n\nIt has been a pleasure to speak with each of you. Thank you so much for your time, and for your work with Johto. It gave many Pokémon fans such as myself some fantastic memories. Are there any closing comments you would each like to make?\n\nÉlan:\n\nYour Avataric self is an expression of your higher being. Pokémon resonated with me not just as a game but for those who need to express themselves in another form, to fight through their own daily arenas, traumas and play to get to their higher selves.\n\nPJ:\n\nJust want to say that it's been such a great experience being part of this project. I've met so many people that are either huge fans of the series or recognize me somehow from the songs/cartoon. The Pokémon community is awesome and it's really made a positive difference in my life - probably more than a lot of other projects I've been involved in. Thanks so much for reaching out! :-)\n\nAdditional photographs\n\nI would like to thank Shareef, Élan, Shwaun and PJ Lequerica for taking their time to respond to all my questions, and to the two other band members Shauna and Jolan, who we weren’t able to include this time around. We hope this interview will highlight the work you all did, and give you the recognition you greatly deserve!\n\nMailbag\n\nWant to be a part of our newsletter? You’re welcome to submit content including (but not limited to) questions, fanart, short stories, your cherished memories, photographs of your collection, and anything else you think you want us to see. In our final mailbag of the year, we welcome back Tristan who has sent us another Pokémon related question!\n\nGiven how far the Pokémon games have come from the beginning, where do you predict the series will go? Will we see new regions and Pokémon, or is there a possible remake? Or do you predict something different?\n\nTristan S, North Carolina\n\nThank you for your questions Tristan, it’s great to include a familiar face in our final mailbag of the year! Let me begin by responding to your first question by saying that I believe the Pokémon series will continue to grow for decades to come. It has continued to have a significant presence across many forms of entertainment in so many different countries, and at the time of writing it shows no signs of slowing down.\n\nTo answer your questions on whether we will see new regions and Pokémon, I believe that’s inevitable. So far the mainline games have been themed on locations within Japan, Europe and the United States. There are still so many places in the real world that the franchise hasn’t touched upon, so I am sure they have plenty of options to turn to.\n\nFinally on remakes, it is my belief that we will see a return to Unova within the next five years, likely on the Nintendo Switch successor console. Whether that will be a remake of Black & White, or a sequel in the form of Black & White 3, or a Pokemon Legends: Kyurem game, is unknown. It’s possible we may get something entirely different, and that’s exciting to think about! There’s also the possibility we could return to Johto, which would be my personal preference, providing that a quality game is created and has plenty of development time.\n\nShare"
