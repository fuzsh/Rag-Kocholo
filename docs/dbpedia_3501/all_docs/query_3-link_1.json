        "text": "1987 compilation album by various artists\n\nProfessional ratingsReview scoresSourceRatingAllMusic[2]New Musical Express9/10[3]\n\nA Very Special Christmas is the first in the A Very Special Christmas series of Christmas-themed compilation albums produced to benefit the Special Olympics. The album was released on October 12, 1987, and production was overseen by Jimmy Iovine for A&M Records. A Very Special Christmas has raised millions of dollars for the Special Olympics.[4] The cover artwork was designed by Keith Haring.\n\nOn January 16, 1998, the album was certified quadruple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America for shipment of four million copies in the United States.[5]\n\nAs of November 2014, A Very Special Christmas is the 19th best-selling Christmas/holiday album in the United States during the SoundScan era of music sales tracking (March 1991 – present), having sold 2,520,000 copies according to SoundScan.[6]\n\nTrack listing\n\n[edit]\n\nNo. Title Writer(s) Artist Producer(s) Time 1. \"Santa Claus Is Coming to Town\" John Frederick Coots and Haven Gillespie The Pointer Sisters Jimmy Iovine, Roy Bittan 3:22 2. \"Winter Wonderland\" Felix Bernard and Richard B.

Gruber Stevie Nicks Iovine, Bittan 4:37\n\nFirst pressings of the album contain a spoken introduction on The Pretenders' \"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas\", presumably by a child. This introduction was later omitted, shortening the track by about 13 seconds.\n\nStarting in 1992, \"Back Door Santa\" was replaced by another Bon Jovi song, \"I Wish Everyday Could Be Like Christmas\", which originally appeared as a B-side on their single \"Keep the Faith\".\n\nPersonnel\n\n[edit]\n\nAccording to the liner notes:[7]\n\nMusicians\n\nBryan Adams – guitar (12)\n\nKenny Aronoff – drums (6)\n\nRoy Bittan – piano (1, 15)\n\nRupert Black – keyboards (5)\n\nJohnny Blitz – keyboards (12)\n\nDon Brewer – drums (11)\n\nRosemary Butler – backing vocals (11)\n\nChris Campbell – bass guitar (11)\n\nJohn Cascella – accordion (6)\n\nSharon Celani – backing vocals (15)\n\nClarence Clemons – saxophone (1)\n\nLarry Crane – guitar (6)\n\nLaura Creamer – backing vocals (11)\n\nBlair Cunningham – drums (5)\n\nMickey Curry – drums (12)\n\nDavid Ervin – keyboards (11)\n\nRichard Feldman – drum programming and keyboards (2)\n\nDavid Freeman – guitar (1)\n\nCraig Frost – piano (11)\n\nLisa Germano – fiddle (6)\n\nDonny Gerrard – backing vocals (11)\n\nMs. Bobbye Hall – percussion (3)\n\nRichie Hayward – drums (3)\n\nDorian Holley – backing vocals (11)\n\nJimmy Johnson – bass guitar (3)\n\nSteve Jordan – drums (1)\n\nCharles Judge – synthesizer and string arrangements (3)\n\nMichael Landau – guitar (1)\n\nAnnie Lennox – keyboards (2)\n\nNils Lofgren – guitar (11)\n\nDarlene Love – backing vocals (3, 9)\n\nSteve Lukather – guitar (3)\n\nRobbie McIntosh – guitar (5)\n\nCoby Myers – bass guitar (6)\n\nRobbie Nevil – backing vocals (15)\n\nPat Peterson – backing vocals (6)\n\nDarryl Phinnessee – backing vocals (11)\n\nAlto Reed – saxophone (11)\n\nAndrea Robinson – backing vocals (11)\n\nKeith Scott – additional guitar and backing vocal (12)\n\nT.
