        "text": "The celebration of Christmas in Early Modern Europe underwent a significant transformation in the second half of the seventeenth century. Even after the Protestant Reformation, European Christmas traditions maintained numerous features of their medieval practices, such as carnivalesque celebrations, processions, masks, and riotous behaviour. This changed during the seventeenth century. Popular carnivalesque Christmas plays were prohibited and replaced with a more internalized devotion that emphasized the individual’s relationship with the newborn Child. This transformation was part of a larger paradigm shift in seventeenth-century religiosity, which replaced external and physical displays of piety with internalized devotional practices. These shifts also included new theologies of corporeality and gender, which likewise had an impact on the ways in which Christmas was celebrated. The theological shifts correlate with the rejection of the carnivalesque in the Early Modern period, as it was analysed by Mikhail Bakhtin.\n\nMost of these changes took place in the 1670s and 1680s. Schütz’s Christmas Historia – which was composed before 1664 – represents a transitional phase and retains some earlier views of Christmas. The most obvious example is the Kindelwiegen (rocking of the child), the physicality of which was highly suspicious to theologians in the later seventeenth century. Schütz not only refers to this practice but incorporates it in the texture of his music.\n\n3 Bach’s oratorio will not be the main focal point of this essay and I will touch on it only briefly. However, it is a useful point of reference because it is still an integral part of our musical canon, and while it was composed seventy years after Schütz’s historia, it helps highlight some of the major differences. For a more thorough discussion of the Christmas Oratorio and its cultural and theological contexts see Rathey, M., Johann Sebastian Bach’s Christmas Oratorio: Music, Theology, Culture (New York and Oxford, 2016)CrossRefGoogle Scholar.\n\n23 ‘It can still be mentioned hereby: should one prefer to make use of the old choraliter speaking style (in which evangelists in the Passion as well as other sacred stories have customarily sung without organ up to now in our churches), this setting of his [Schütz] hopefully would not stray too far from the mark were he to continue in the following manner and proceed up to the end’; A Heinrich Schütz Reader, p. 242.\n\n55 This function of Baroque dances has been described by McClary, S., Desire and Pleasure in Seventeenth-Century Music (Berkeley, 2012), pp. 203–205 CrossRefGoogle Scholar, and she refers to corroborating scholarship in neuroscience: ‘recent neurobiologists have found that radical changes in brain function occur in people involved in such rituals, especially those involving music and dance. The parts of the brain responsible for orienting us as individuated selves as we move through space actually shut down their activity, causing subjects to experience as reality that merger with timelessness’ (p. 205)."
