        "text": "'Happy Xmas (War is Over)' meaning: What inspired the song?\n\nThe song came about after more than two years of peace activism by John Lennon and his wife Yoko Ono, that began with the 'bed-ins' they created in March and May 1969.\n\nThe song was part of an international multimedia campaign launched by the couple in December 1969, at the height of the counterculture movement and protests against America's involvement in the Vietnam War.\n\nSee more: Yoko Ono facts: Artist's age, children and relationship with John Lennon revealed\n\nThey had rented billboard spaces in 12 major cities around the world, for the display of black-and-white posters that declared \"WAR IS OVER! If You Want It – Happy Christmas from John & Yoko\".\n\nThe slogan had previously appeared in the 1968 anti-war songs 'The War Is Over' by Phil Ochs, and 'The Unknown Soldier' by the Doors. However, it is not known if this was deliberate or merely coincidental.\n\nSee more: Paul McCartney \"often dreams\" about old friend John Lennon: \"They're always good\"\n\nLennon came up with the song as a way of continuing the themes of social unity and peaceful change via personal accountability, that was previously the basis of the earlier billboard campaign, while attempting to convey optimism and avoiding the sentimentality he felt often characterised Christmas music.\n\nHe was the first Beatle to release an original Christmas song after they had parted ways.\n\nHow was it made?\n\nHappy Christmas (War Is Over)\n\nIn October 1971, with just a simple melody and half-formed lyrics, Lennon recorded an acoustic guitar demo in his room at the St Regis Hotel in New York City, where he and Ono were living at the time.\n\nOno later received co-writing credit, but her actual contribution to the song at this stage is unclear, as she did not participate in the demo.\n\nSee more: The inside story of why The Beatles really broke up\n\nLennon brought in Phil Spector to produce the song. The first recording session was held on Thursday, October 28, at the Record Plant studio.\n\nSession musicians – some of whom had performed as members of the Plastic Ono Band – recorded instrumental backings, and Lennon and Ono added the main vocals.\n\n30 children aged from four to 12 from The Harlem Community Choir recorded backing vocals in the chorus.\n\nDid any other songs inspire it?\n\nPeter, Paul & Mary ~ Stewball\n\nWhen Lennon first played the demo for Phil Spector, the producer said that the song's opening line, \"So this is Christmas…\", was rhythmically identical to his 1961 single 'I Love How You Love Me' by the Paris Sisters.\n\nLennon also instructed the guitarists to play mandolin riffs similar to the ones heard in 'Try Some, Buy Some', a song Spector and George Harrison had produced for his wife, Ronnie Spector, of the Ronettes.\n\nQUIZ: How well do you know the Beatles' song lyrics?\n\nThe chords and melodic structure of the song are rather similar to the traditional English ballad 'Skewball'. The verses are particularly similar to the 1963 version (titled 'Stewball') by Peter, Paul and Mary.\n\nHow did it perform in the charts?\n\nA dispute between publisher Northern Songs and Lennon over publishing rights delayed the release of the song in the UK until November 1972.\n\nIt peaked at number four in 1972, and has charted many since. In 1980, in the weeks after Lennon's death, it reached number two, behind his other classic 'Imagine'.\n\nOn its US debut in 1971, it wasn't a success. This was due to the single's late release, which resulted in limited airplay before Christmas, and a lack of promotion at the time."
