        "text": "Christmas: The highlight of the long Danish winter\n\nDenmark's long winter is at its darkest in mid-December, when the weak sunlight lasts only about seven hours per day. Ever since the Viking Age, and even earlier, people living in the Scandinavian region have held winter celebrations to bring light and joy to the darkness, and after Christianity was introduced into Denmark around the year 958 AD, the festival has been called Christmas.\n\nChristmas dominates December and much of November in Denmark. Shopping streets and homes are decorated with colourful Christmas lights, and local bakeries are full of Christmas delicacies like klejner and pebernødder (ginger cookies). There are even special Christmas beers and gløgg - a cup of warmed wine mixed with brandy and dried fruit.\n\nDanish Christmas is celebrated in the evening on December 24, and the country virtually shuts down. Even the city buses stop running between 17.30-22.00 so that everyone can enjoy dinner with their families. Denmark's electrical and gas utilities can measure a spike in usage when people across the country turn on their ovens to cook the traditional roast duck, roast pork, or roast goose. The traditional side dishes are caramelised potatoes and pickled red cabbage.\n\nAfter dinner, the whole family joins hands and dances around the Christmas tree while singing traditional Christmas carols. The tree is usually a Norwegian spruce with homemade decorations and sometimes freshly lit candles. Finally, it is time to unwrap the gifts, and sometimes to attend a midnight service at the local church.\n\nOn December 25 and 26, many Danes visit relatives or friends they were not able to be with on Christmas Eve. A traditional Christmas lunch with karrysild (herring in curry) and æbleflæsk (apple porridge with pork) is often followed by a group nature walk. Most shops and restaurants in Denmark are closed on December 24, 25, and 26.\n\nEaster and spring festivals\n\nBecause Easter is a moving holiday, it sometimes falls in March when Denmark is still quite chilly, and sometimes in late April, when the bright Danish spring is already well underway. Whatever the weather, Easter week is the traditional opening of Tivoli, the beloved amusement park in downtown Copenhagen, which dates from 1843.\n\nDanish families usually get together for a big Easter lunch that lasts all afternoon. Traditions such as painting hard-boiled eggs in Easter colours, going on egg hunts, and rolling eggs downhill are popular among children and adults alike.\n\nThe spring holiday calendar in Denmark also includes Whitsunday and Pentecost, as well as Great Prayer Day - a holiday celebrated only in Denmark. These are days off work when many shops are closed, but they have few special traditions surrounding them. Most Danes use them as a chance to escape to their summerhouses in the countryside.\n\nMay 1, the International Worker's Day, is a partial holiday in Denmark. People in the trade union movement may have a day off work, but most businesses are open.\n\nAnother partial holiday is the Danish Constitution Day, on June 5. A few businesses close part of the day, but most are open and Denmark generally does not hold parades or other festivities to mark the day.\n\nHowever, the Danish embassies and missions abroad often invite their local counterparts and the local Danish community for social events highlighting Danish values such a democracy, equality and human rights.\n\nMidsummer festival of Saint Hans\n\nThe height of Danish summer is celebrated on the evening of June 23 under the name Sankt Hans (Saint Hans), who is known in English as John the Baptist. The festival of Sankt Hans and the celebration of the summer solstice have pagan roots and date back to the days before Christianity came to Denmark.\n\nSankt Hans is generally celebrated with a dinner at home with family and friends followed by a stroll to a community bonfire, often by the beach, in a park, or on the shore of one of Denmark's many lakes.\n\nThere are speeches, and as the bonfire burns, the community sings the song \"Midsommervisen\", written by the Danish poet Holger Drachmann in 1885.\n\nNew Year's Eve in Denmark\n\nIf you're lucky enough to spend New Year's Eve in Denmark, you can look forward to watching the Queen's New Year's Speech on television at 18:00 - don't miss it!\n\nAll of Denmark tunes in to hear its monarch's statement about the year that has passed and the challenges of the year ahead. The New Year's Speech has been a national rallying point since 1942, when the much-admired King Christian X offered hope and encouragement to a country in the grip of a German occupation.\n\nWhen the speech is over, it's time to get ready for the party ahead. New Year's Eve is one of the few times the casual Danes really love to dress up. Most Danes attend a party at the home of a friend or at a restaurant or nightclub, and a good selection of alcohol is usually on offer.\n\nJust before midnight champagne and kransekage (baked marzipan cookies) is served, and everyone awaits the stroke of midnight on the clock tower at Copenhagen City Hall. When the clock strikes twelve, some Danes follow the more recent tradition of jumping off a chair or sofa and \"into the new year.\" After that, many people go outside and set off amateur fireworks."
