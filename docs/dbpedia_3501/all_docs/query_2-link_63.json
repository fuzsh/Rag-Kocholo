        "text": "This day of lectures consists of three of Patrick's most popular lectures, including glorious music and beautiful paintings:-\n\n1. Entertaining Angels Unawares: Angels in Music and Art.\n\nAngels don’t speak, they sing. And they have inspired much wonderful music. Patrick will investigate their roles as guardians, messengers and fighters through imaginative music by Britten, Elgar and Mendelssohn. Angelic words also feature in regularly repeated liturgical texts that Patrick sings daily in St Paul’s Cathedral, such as the Sanctus and Te Deum. These will give us an opportunity to explore and enjoy angelic music by composers such as Bach, Mozart and Walton. Patrick will call on some of the world’s finest art and poetry to further expand this journey into the heavenly realm.\n\n2. A Christmas Special: Michael Praetorius.\n\nMichael Praetorius’s music was celebrated again in his anniversary year of 2021, and thanks to a wonderful 1994 disc from the Gabrieli Consort, his music for Christmas has become his most loved calling card.\n\n3. The Music of Epiphany: Gifts and Stars.\n\nEpiphany is a feast of abundance and transformations, set in the very dead of winter. As well as focusing on the visit of the Wise Men and the extravagant gifts they bring, the season also considers Jesus’ Baptism and his first miracle at the Wedding at Cana. T. S. Eliot’s beloved poem The Journey of the Magi leads us to considerations of the dreams and journeys that also feature in Matthew’s gospel account. There is much wonderful music to illustrate this, and Patrick will also plunder the worlds of art and poetry to portray this rich array of stars, camels and gold. Featuring music by Palestrina, Byrd, Mendelssohn and Britten."
