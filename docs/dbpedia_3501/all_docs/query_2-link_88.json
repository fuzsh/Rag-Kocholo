        "text": "San Antonio, known for its proud history as a Military City, holds a special place in its heart for the brave men and women of the United States Armed Forces and their families. Our neighborhood at Pearl is dedicated to expressing their gratitude and honoring their service. To show their appreciation, They’re offering exclusive discounts and special offers through our Military Monday initiative. This is our way of saying thank you for their dedication and sacrifice.\n\nWithin the walls of Pullman Market, you will find a specialty grocer, a whole animal butcher, a sourdough bakery, a chef supply shop, five quick-service eateries, and four distinct restaurants. Throughout the entire space, we seek flavor first. The products that you will find in the grocer are ingredients that we love. If it comes from Texas, it has an extra special place in our hearts. Whether you take something to enjoy at home or you want us to cook for you, we invite you to find something you love.\n\nSan Antonio has always been a place for great music. Our music legacy of conjunto, blues, rock, R&B, and country—is central to the story of American music. @stablehallsa, San Antonio’s newest venue, is a place where performances are presented through this multilayered music prism in a venue that channels an intimate early 1900s theater, a classic Texas dance hall, and a state-of-the-art concert venue.\n\nOur region has its own vibe with a rich network of artisans and makers. Rancho Diaz—Pearl’s newest retail concept—is chock full of well-crafted wares. From textiles, pottery, jewelry, hand-dipped candles, and artisan-made décor. Ginger and Mario actively source and elevate things made by hand and with care. Step inside their corner shop and experience first-hand their commitment to craft.\n\nRobby and Neesha Grubbs have been delivering high-quality coffee experiences since 2009. They’ve been instrumental in creating a coffee culture and community here in San Antonio—their shop is abuzz with people connecting. Local Coffee Founders’ commitment to craft manifests in sourcing, brewing, and serving. Their entire team is deeply passionate about what they do—sharing their passion for the craft of coffee.\n\nFor patrons who want to do a quick in and out for a cup of coffee or a pastry or a quick grab at the weekend farmers market, the various lots can range from 30 minutes of free parking up to two hours at the River West at the intersection of Quincy and Schiller streets, Koehler Garage inside the complex or the lot on Newell.\n\nWe are thrilled to share that Pearl Farmers Market and The Bottling Department have been chosen by USA Today 10 Best readers as the #5 Best Farmers Markets and #10 Best Food Halls! This is well-deserved national recognition for two of the most loved experiences at Pearl! Thank you for your support, San Antonio!"
