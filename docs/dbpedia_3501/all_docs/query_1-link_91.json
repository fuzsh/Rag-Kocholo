        "text": "An Ode to Marcia\n\n“I don’t believe an accident of birth makes people sisters or brothers. It makes them siblings, gives them mutuality of parentage. Sisterhood and brotherhood is a condition people have to work at.”\n\n— Maya Angelou\n\nThe first time I saw this quote from Dr. Angelou, it gave me goosebumps. Never before had I felt so seen, so validated. I had been proclaiming something similar to close confidants for some years now. “For me, the word ‘sister’ is a verb,” I’d say. “To be a sister is an action. To be ‘sisterly’ is an adverb, you know?” It is a title I have always taken intensely serious. With so many landmines to navigate in this life, there is enough strife to go around. To be a sister is, among many things, to embody a soft place to land. Sisterhood is a sacred space, a supernatural destination. A space to hold secrets. To experience a unique and irreplaceable love. There is nothing light about being a sister. It is for the fiercely committed.\n\nThe thing about sisterhood is that it means different things to different people. And sometimes the variance of interpretation can determine the fate of the relationship. When the sentiments of sisterhood align, there is nothing quite as euphoric. And maybe they won’t align the whole time. Maybe only for a season. Maybe for many seasons throughout your lifetime, or between droughts. Somehow, thankfully, I have always understood that the synchronistic occurrences over the course of sisterhood are like gold, and the heart acts as a storehouse for the bottled treasures we call memories.\n\nToday is my sister’s birthday. It is also 4 months to the day since my birthday. It also marks 4 months and 3 days since her transition from this earthly plane — 123 days since she became an ancestor. It is a reality that, for me, grows more and more peculiar, surreal, gut-wrenching, mystical, humbling, mind-boggling, and divine with every passing day. In many ways, it’s my worst fear come to life. When you’re the youngest of many older siblings, you think about these things. At least I did. Almost incessantly, as a child. In fact, this somewhat irrational fear lived in the back of my mind for many years. When you experience the sanctity of sisterhood — for no matter how long — you want it forever. You want it to stay at its best forever. You want it to survive the cold winters, and the dark nights. You want it to last long enough to tend to the frostbitten parts that still feel tender. You want the sun’s warmth to act as a salve. You want to experience the tiny green sprouting buds that offer hope. You want to dance under the glorious full blooms.\n\nI never lived with my sister. By the time I was born, she — like many of my grandparents’ “grands” — found escape and solace in their Brooklyn dwelling. But I was still uptown residing in our Bronx birthplace. By the time I was about 4 years old, the physical distance had stretched three thousand miles across the country. She’d moved to Los Angeles, planting new roots, and tending to her abundant harvests over the next several decades. Though exactly 15 years and 8 months and a lifetime of contrasting experiences were between us — my sister Marcia and me — oftentimes and in many ways we could find ourselves closer than anyone at any given moment. It was in these moments that the distance felt completely inconsequential. When we were finishing each other’s sentences, sharing a mischievous laugh, being the other’s amen corner when expressing our individual principles, or vibing on a song, she could have been on the other side of the world and it would have mattered not.\n\nShe graduated high school early, and her academic astuteness earned her a scholarship to College of the Holy Cross, an elite liberal arts institution that is one of a select few to academically rival the Ivy League. She forewent her scholarship, deciding instead to venture west and alchemize her future, her way. This profoundly impacted me, her decision functioning as a guidepost for me when I decided that my combination of full-time college, a full-time internship, and late-night moonlighting was going to give me a nervous breakdown if I didn’t let one of those pressures go. By this time, my sister had been thriving professionally for well over a decade. She made taking the road less traveled feel totally doable and even enchanting.\n\nShe worked in advertisement and was consistently the company’s top gun. She’d take me to work with her when I would make my annual visits to LA, and there her name would be, looming like a Broadway marquee at the highest spot on the dry eraser board in all caps. You had to look all the way up to see it. You had to tilt your neck back to take in her greatness. To see Marcia, to get the essence of her intentions in this life, you had to extend your purview. Her path and her triumphs demanded it.\n\nI was always looking up to Marcia, even when I grew taller in height by the time I turned 15, playfully teasing her about the inch and a half I had on her. She was a vision to behold. She had these large, penetrating eyes that seemed to look through to your entire soul. Her skin was smooth and buttery. To this day, she is the only person I know who had a deep widow’s peak in the middle of her forehead. It led to this glorious mane of jet black, silky hair that fell to the middle of her back. She was statuesque and walked with an exaggerated, but completely natural switch of her hips. Watching her walk away with that confident and seductive gait as her hair ricocheted from one side to the other was something to behold. Her scent was bewitching and signature. It was always irresistible. I’d smelled perfume on women before, but never like her. It was always so present, but somehow also mysterious and understated. It was so hypnotizing that as a teenager I started wearing it too, hoping to capture the allure that she had. It smelled great on me. On her, it subsumed into her aura.\n\nShe wore a blue-based red matte lipstick most of the time. I know that because when I started wearing makeup, she taught me that this color was perfect against skin with undertones “like ours.”\n\n“You don’t want to wear anything that looks too-too orangey… unless it’s [MAC’s] Russian Red,” she strongly advised. “You want something with a blue base.” I was always at attention when she offered beauty tips. I didn’t want to miss a single word. Her tips felt sacred. She had naturally defined, full lips that required no liner and her brows had a deep natural arch that women pay through the nose to obtain. She was a natural beauty in every sense of the word. Feature for feature, we didn’t really look alike. Her jet, straight hair was nothing like my kinky, bushy, brown coils. Her deep ebony eyes contrasted my probing hazel-amber ones. We tried several times, but we could never quite share each other’s foundation – her butter pecan just a few hues too many away from my caramel sundae. Yet somehow, when you put it all together, we were undoubtably sisters, and I reveled in anyone’s observation of it. I wanted to be just like her. She was everything to this little girl.\n\nAs a result of her move across country, when I was a child I saw her only on occasion, making her visits to New York more like national holidays. The anticipation of her arrival would be felt for weeks. The time between her landing on the runway of JFK and the time she would arrive at my house felt unbearable. When she finally showed up, I was overwhelmed by a joy and bliss that I can still tap into at this moment. There isn’t a feeling that is comparable to it, even today.\n\nMy first visit to see her in California was to her Lankershim Boulevard apartment. The complex seemed fancy and reminded me of a hotel with its balconies and pool in the center of the gated entrance. She hosted me, along with her other two siblings for almost the entire summer. She worked during the day, but she’d leave us stocked with all of the food, snacks, treats and VHS tapes a child could ask for. I must have watched Purple Rain a hundred times while on that vacation. I mimicked every word, and she got quite a laugh watching me imitate the characters and reenact various scenes. I was an animated, dramatic, and humorous child with lots of spice and she would often get a kick out of winding me up, letting me loose, and watching me “go.” Especially if it was bordering on something mildly inappropriate, like quoting Prince’s father saying, “You’re a goddamn sinner!” in a particularly tense scene from The Purple One’s critically acclaimed debut film. She would crack up and I delighted in moving her to laughter. We both understood that we were on the edge of being rascally and we sat in that space together often over the years, especially if it meant we could share a wink and a laugh.\n\nEven though we weren’t living together, as a DJ her musical tastes are what influence me most today. When I was as young as six years old, I was taking stock of her incredible vinyl collection — Sugar Hill Gang, Michael Jackson, Whodini, DeBarge, Teena Marie, The Gap Band, Prince. Being born in the early 1960s made her early 20s the sweet spot when it came to real-time reveling in the now-golden era of R&B, pop, and the emergence of hip hop. I was watching Whodini perform “The Freaks Come Out at Night” on Friday Night Videos. She was partying with the late, great Ecstasy. We all watched Michael Jackson debut his moonwalk on Motown 25, but she’d already seen the future King of Pop perform up close and personal as a member of J5, The Jacksons, and as a solo act.\n\nLevels.\n\nLiving in New York City, it’s become the hot thing for DJs to delve into the black lexicon of the ’70s and ’80s at trendy rooftop parties and speakeasies. But I had a sister who lived that music, and that detail made the music hit a little differently for me. For their part, they were simply playing the songs. But for me, each song was a direct line to her. She was there, live and direct. I don’t have enough fingers and toes to tally how many times she’d seen Prince live. Almost all of the Queens. Too many to list. People my age are spinning these classics from some part of the distance. Even if we heard the music coming up, there’s not the experience of seeing these people live at the time of these recordings, or dancing to it in the clubs, or even being in the studio with some of the artists themselves — she had all of that over us. And I took pride in having that connection to her.\n\nI felt like her real-time experiences with the music certified me in a way. When elders would say infamously, “What you know ’bout that?” I would say, “Plenty!” And it was largely because of her. When I would practice my sets, I’d text her a video of a particular blend I was working on. If I was spinning The Jones Girls’s “Nights over Egypt,” I’d make her a quick video dedication. “I know you love this one!” I also loved playing her some of the rarer cuts to see what she had to say about them. Her firsthand anecdotes became invaluable to the way I approached DJing.\n\nPrince, Aretha Franklin, Luther Vandross, The Clark Sisters, Michael Jackson, Stevie Wonder, Billie Holiday, Sarah Vaughan, and Teena Maria were among her absolute favorites. I’m going to go out on a limb (no pun initially intended) here and say she is The Ultimate Teena Marie Enthusiast. I don’t know of a soul who knows Marie’s music more thoroughly than my sister. I remember when she brought her Irons in the Fire LP to the Grand Concourse apartment I grew up in on one of her visits. I was maybe 6 years old. I will never forget the sounds of “Young Love” and the title track as they wafted through the house. The album, lush with gorgeous orchestral arrangements by the brilliant black arranger Paul Riser, was sonic bliss for me. But that sense of euphoria was present partly because she was the one playing it. Whatever she liked was important to me. Whatever she was drawn to made me listen with a closer ear.\n\nSome years later, on another one of her visits, she and her then-fiancé were driving some of us home from a day of hanging out. She was leaving New York the next day. Her departures were just as eventful as her arrivals. Those eves before she was headed back were always tough for me. This night, it felt like a bag of coal was sitting in the pit of my stomach. I wished I could bottle just a piece of her, so that I wouldn’t have to be without her. The radio was tuned to WBLS and the legendary Vaughn Harper, whose pioneering Quiet Storm-formatted program set many a sentimental mood for 25 years. Teena Marie’s “Casanova Brown” began to play. I thought, Wow, they’re playing this for Marcia. Maybe for us. Since I was young, I never believed in coincidence. There was always some meaning in the seemingly mundane. At almost six minutes, it’s a long song for the radio format, but they played the entire suite-like ballad from start to dramatic finish. I listened intently, grasping the fullness of Marie’s angst as I was suffering my own, although much different in nature. My sister was leaving. And I wished she didn’t have to. It would be like this every time I was with her, either in New York or Los Angeles. I was never ready for her to leave, and I was never ready to come back home.\n\nIn the late 90s she took me to see Teena Marie live at an intimate Los Angeles venue. Going out with Marcia for a night on the town was the best excuse to get all dolled up. I dressed in a casual but elegant grey velour tank-and-pants set, my hair in big loose curls made with her electric hot roller set, and my makeup courtesy of the massive level of beauty products on her busy powder room sink. She’d temporarily switched from MAC to Lancôme foundation, and I brushed it all over my face, even though the shade was off. Consequently, my skin looked as grey as my lovely outfit in all of the photographs we took that night. Yikes. But what stands out most to me about that night was sitting across from my sister as she listened to her favorite, Lady T, as she waved her arms high in the air, singing along, smiling, gesturing the lyrics, and having the time of her life.\n\nIt was around the time when CDs became the new format of the day that I began buying my own music. There was lots of vinyl in the home and I never felt like I needed to buy it until I became an adult. But with Discmans becoming all the rage in the ’90s and Tower Records being a ten-minute walk from my high school, I began buying the shiny, silver discs in droves. I was a sophomore in high school, and Marcia was coming to New York over the Christmas holiday. I asked her, “Can you bring me some Stevie Wonder CDs?” I was at the height of my Stevie Wonder deep-dive, and I wanted to copy them onto cassettes to make mixtapes. She told me she would, but in my mind, she was going to forget. I hounded her about those CDs for weeks. Each time, she patiently assured me she would bring them, even letting me know the night before that they were officially tucked away in her suitcase. She didn’t forget.\n\nShe must have brought about 30 Stevie Wonder CDs with her. I couldn’t believe it! I had asked her to bring “some,” which to me meant she’d bring maybe five or at the most, ten. I think she brought every Stevie Wonder CD she owned. In that moment, watching her unpack stack after stack onto the bed, her beautifully manicured hands clad with gold and shiny stones and long cherry red nails holding as many as she could each time she reached into her suitcase, I realized that she thoroughly understood how important this was to me. And she didn’t want to disappoint.\n\nDespite an almost 16-year age difference, she and I would often spend hours upon hours on the telephone. Being so far away from each other physically, the phone was our lifeline until we could be together physically. It is only now, through the hours of confiding and grieving I’ve done with my best friend on the telephone these past months, that I realize how non-typical that was.\n\n“Think about how many other people must have wanted her time and then think about that level of undivided attention she was giving you,” he marveled as he soothed and enlightened me during a recent phone call. “How many other things she could have been doing with her time, and how she was deliberate in her choice to talk to a 12-year-old instead. Her little sister. How she preferred to. How those conversations and that time together had to have been giving her as much as it was giving you.”\n\nWhen Mariah Carey’s self-titled debut was released in 1990, I became instantly hooked on the fellow New York native, who was climbing the charts like greased lightening. Her song “Vision of Love” spoke to me, and I practiced it enduringly. Somewhere in our conversation about newcomer Mariah, Marcia asked me to sing it. Painfully shy as I am, it took lots of coercion, but my sister is wildly persuasive. It was almost impossible to tell her no. So I did as I was asked. I sang the first verse of “Vision of Love” to her over the phone. When I finished, I held my breath in the long silence.\n\n“Sing it again! Sing the next part! Keep going!”\n\nBy the time I was done, I’d sung the entire song — the bridge, and long stirring ending included.\n\nShe was stunned. It was the proudest I’d ever see her of me. She really loved my voice and I have no doubts that her confidence in me and the pure, visceral joy she felt when listening was the precise boost I needed to audition for LaGuardia High School of Music & Art and Performing Arts a year later.\n\nAfter giving her my best Mariah Carey, she took me under her wing and began teaching me songs for us to sing together. In addition to her sheer passion as a listener, consumer of music, and committed patron of the arts, she was also musically gifted. She had a great ear. She sang in a group for a brief time and had a warm, lovely voice herself. She also had a great sense of harmony. She taught me the Hal David-Burt Bacharach classic, “Alfie,” assigning me the alto part. We’d sing it together on the phone over and over again.\n\nWhat’s it all about Alfie\n\nIs it just for the moment we live\n\nWhat’s it all about\n\nWhen you sort it out, Alfie\n\nAre we meant to take more than we give\n\nOr are we meant to be kind?\n\nAnd if, if only fools are kind, Alfie\n\nThen I guess it is wise to be cruel\n\nAnd if life belongs only to the strong, Alfie\n\nWhat will you lend on an old golden rule?\n\nAs sure as I believe there’s a heaven above\n\nAlfie, I know there’s something much more\n\nSomething even non-believers can believe in\n\nI believe in love, Alfie\n\nWithout true love we just exist, Alfie\n\nUntil you find the love you’ve missed\n\nYou’re nothing, Alfie\n\nWhen you walk let your heart lead the way\n\nAnd you’ll find love any day Alfie… Alfie\n\nI was about 18 years old when I realized that I just may want to be a music writer. At the time, Faith Evans had just released her sophomore album, Keep the Faith. I was a Faith Evans junkie and studied her vehemently. I would read VIBE magazine and daydream that one day one of my essays would land there. I wrote a pretend review, willing my future through my prose, and I asked Marcia if I could bounce it off of her over the phone. I got through the first paragraph — the introduction. She stopped me.\n\n“READ THAT AGAIN?!?”\n\nI will never forget the pride that welled up in me, and I happily obliged, reading it now with more confidence, feeding off of the way it grabbed her. She made me read it a few more times before emphatically stating that I was already a writer. She made me feel like I could have submitted my pretend review that very day. Years later, when I did begin writing professionally, earning awards in the field of journalism, she would become my first editor.\n\nMarcia was a strong writer and an even stronger editor. She happily reviewed my work, being mindful not to ever change the essence of its meaning. She edited with a gentle hand. This said everything about the way she felt about my work, because when it came to business and a time to work, there wasn’t much benignity. She was a tough cookie. She needed to be. When I think about how she climbed the corporate ladder to such heights that she was able to retire by the time she was my age, I understand the diligence, and hard-nosed approach that made her successful in her career. She was a boss in every aspect of her life. So when she took a tender approach to my work, to me, it was because she knew she could. She could because to her, the work was solid. The fact that a woman who had done so much in her own career, saw me as a person blossoming and surefooted in mine, meant so much to me.\n\n“As usual, check me,” she’d always say when returning a piece I’d written that she’d just edited, oftentimes without much notice or time to do so because of strict deadlines I had to adhere to. Never once too busy to do it, either. “Hey Marsh, I gotta turn this piece in tomorrow — you have time to edit it?” She always did. It couldn’t have been convenient every time. But I’d never know it. “Here you go. CHECK MY EDITS CAREFULLY, as I didn’t intend to misconstrue any of your thoughts.” The preservation of my tone, my voice, my meaning was paramount to her. Another time she wrote, “Here’s my first run at it. Check it out. I want to sleep on it and look at it again tomorrow. Let me know what you think.” The honor of her respect was worth more than almost anything. I don’t know if she knew how much it meant to me, until I told her about ten years ago.\n\nIn a rare occurrence, it was raining on this particular Los Angeles afternoon, as we sat in the driveway of her home. We had just pulled in from wherever we were coming from when we were having one of our deeper conversations, and it led me to say to her, “What you think of me matters.” I was barely able to get the sentiment out, choking back tears that felt as long as the streams of rain on her windshield. “Oooh, Angelika … what you think of me matters, too.” I don’t think I knew that at the time. But when I reflect … her deference to me as it pertained to my writing, the value she felt as an auntie, the times when she called to ask for my opinion or when my ear was the one she desired to vent to … yes … what I thought of her mattered to her, too. I’m grateful we told each other at least once. I wish we would have told each other many more times.\n\nWhen I had my son, I experienced an interesting dynamic. Although my sister was substantially older than me, I’d been an aunt to her child much longer than she’d been an aunt to mine. It was trippy watching her navigate this new territory in which I was already quite seasoned for some time. I’d been an aunt since the age of 6, being the youngest of so many siblings.\n\nShe was the aunt I expected her to be. Intense, no bullshit, protective, and totally immersed. She responded predictively to almost every video I sent her between our in-person visits. “LOOK AT MY NEPHEW!!!!” He was never so much my son as he was her nephew. As frustrating as it would sometimes be to experience her completely take over the maternal role when it came to my son, I simultaneously understood what was happening for her. She loved him.\n\n“Do you know the song ‘Blues Away’?” she asked my son when he was at the peak of his Michael Jackson obsession at about 5 years old. He didn’t know it. She was keeping him while I was doing whatever business was at hand. When I got back to her house, she had him immersed in The Jacksons’ 1976 self-titled album, and “Blues Away” became a staple for us — and my phone’s new ringtone to keep us close, as we traveled back to New York.\n\nI’d like to be yours\n\nTomorrow\n\nSo I’m giving you some time\n\nTo think it over today\n\nBut you can’t take my blues away\n\nNo matter what you say, hey\n\nYou can’t take my blues away\n\nNo matter what you say\n\nWhat you say, hey, baby\n\nThe next song she introduced to her nephew was the delicious dance track “Lovely One” from The Jacksons’ Triumph album, released in 1980. I’d been a fan of this album for some time, but I was a complete fanatic of the group’s Destiny LP, which had been released two years prior. I knew that project inside and out. When Marcia began to dissect Triumph for Riley, I began to spin it almost all the time. The signature horn lines from “Lovely One” were analogous to those of “Shake Your Body (Down to the Ground),” and I realized I could blend these two for an ultimate dance experience. A little piece of Marcia, a little piece of me, alchemized for the benefit of the groove. Whatever music she introduced to my son meant as much to me — if not more — as the music she hipped me to. She had the inside track on how to make my presentation of music sparkle just by being herself. She enjoyed making this impact on both of us, and I delighted in her enjoying herself as teacher … as music mentor. I could tell it meant a lot to her. I was honored that she felt proud to be in that position within her nephew’s village.\n\nIt’s funny. When you’re a “little sister,” you’re inherently on the receiving end of many things — the good and the not-so-good. Ideally, there is a built-in protection. You’re looked after by default. But I was a fully grown woman with a child of my own and Marcia would still throw her arm across my chest if we were in the car and she had to come to an abrupt stop. She still held my hand tightly if we had to walk through a crowd — her leading the way, pulling me along. She still proudly introduced me to her friends as “my baby sister.” Four decades into this life thing, and I was still her “baby sister.” And the truth is, I loved it. I loved being loved by her. It mattered.\n\nMy sister was born on a Monday. And she transitioned on a Monday. For many of the artists who came into their prime as she was blossoming into her own sense of womanhood in the late ’70s, astrology was a heavy theme, and I love the sacred system of the stars. From an astrological perspective, the Moon rules Mondays. The moon and its function in our lives is one of life’s most profound mysteries. My Piscean sister was indeed profoundly mysterious. She was born a mystic. And so, it’s no surprise that in the wake of her passing, she has been so deeply present in my life. While I hold these post-transition experiences sacred, therefore rendering them classified, what I can say is that she is teaching me, in the ways in which only she can, that there is no end. Only transcendence. And ascension.\n\nI would never have fathomed that the questions raised through the lyrics that my sister taught me from “Alfie” could portend so much about sisterhood and our journey through it. Our triumphs and our failures as sisters. Our fervent attempts to reorient ourselves within the bylaws of sisterhood throughout our earthly time together. The vulnerability it takes to be in true sisterhood with another.\n\nWhat’s it all about?\n\nTime continues to whisper the answers.\n\nWhat’s it all about Alfie\n\nIs it just for the moment we live\n\nWhat’s it all about\n\nWhen you sort it out, Alfie\n\nAre we meant to take more than we give\n\nOr are we meant to be kind?\n\nAnd if, if only fools are kind, Alfie\n\nThen I guess it is wise to be cruel\n\nAnd if life belongs only to the strong, Alfie\n\nWhat will you lend on an old golden rule?\n\nAs sure as I believe there’s a heaven above\n\nAlfie, I know there’s something much more\n\nSomething even non-believers can believe in\n\nI believe in love, Alfie\n\nWithout true love we just exist, Alfie\n\nUntil you find the love you’ve missed\n\nYou’re nothing, Alfie\n\nWhen you walk let your heart lead the way\n\nAnd you’ll find love any day Alfie… Alfie\n\nWhitney Houston’s National Anthem at 30\n\nThe first time I heard the national anthem performed in a way that mesmerized me was when Marvin Gaye sang it in 1983 at the NBA All-Star Game. Just four months after the release of what would be his last album, Gaye was riding the wave of a tremendous comeback, with “Sexual Healing,” his chart topping single, which spent 27 weeks on the Billboard charts. Central to the song is the TR-808, making the bedroom anthem one of the very first to utilize the pioneering drum machine. He used it again for his wholly original “Star-Spangled Banner“ performance, effortlessly floating in and out of phrases like the greatest living crooner that he was. Through his genius, he turned an anthem into a groove. It was completely fresh. “I felt that singing it with that kind of music in the background gave me an inspiration,” Gaye said in an interview. “I asked God that when I sang it, would He let it move mens’ souls.”\n\nIn the wake of football player and activist Colin Kaepernick’s protest of police brutality demonstrated through kneeling before games during the anthem, a lot more has been more widely understood about the racist roots of the song, written by Francis Scott Key in 1814. The stanza that is left out of the anthem when sung in stadiums and schools, references Key’s problematic sentiments regarding slavery.\n\nNo refuge could save the hireling and slave\n\nFrom the terror of flight or the gloom of the grave,\n\nAnd the star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave\n\nO’er the land of the free and the home of the brave.\n\nKey, a descendant of a wealthy plantation family who enslaved black people, wrote the song based on his experience during the War of 1812. The omitted stanza is in reference to the British promising refuge to enslaved Black people who escaped their enslavers and fought on their side, raising fears among White Americans of a large-scale revolt. He spoke of Black people as “a distinct and inferior race” and supported emancipating the enslaved only if they were immediately shipped to Africa. [1]\n\nWhen Gaye speaks of his prayer that his rendering of this song would “move men’s souls,” I believe it is safe to say that he is not romanticizing the song in the ways typical of those who call themselves patriots. A deeply spiritual being, raised in the church, who had only twelve years prior, masterfully indicted America through his magnum opus, What’s Going On, Gaye once again enmeshes prayer and politics with his performance of the national anthem. By interpreting the song through the lens of his iconic legacy, it was yet another mirror he was holding up to those in power to see the hypocrisy of empty patriotism and the distance that black people must constantly negotiate between who America says it is, and the reality of who it is. His acclaimed performance became the prototype for every black person who performed it henceforward. Especially Whitney Houston.\n\nI find the coincidence of Juneteenth becoming a federal holiday the same year as the 30th anniversary of Whitney Houston’s earth-shifting performance of the national anthem to be quite stunning. Only two short weeks separate the holidays but the space is immeasurable when we consider that the Fourth of July represented freedom exclusive to white men, and that freedom for black people would be delayed for nearly a century. Immeasurable distance, when we examine the fact that “justice delayed,” is as American as apple pie. That we continue to celebrate a holiday that marks independence and freedom of white men only, two weeks after we honor the emancipation of my enslaved ancestors is one of many consistent mind-f***s that come with being black in America. In the words of the formerly enslaved great abolitionist Frederick Douglass, “What have I or those I represent to do with your national independence?” When it was announced that Juneteenth — an event commemorating the official end of slavery, which has been celebrated by Black Americans for the last 155 years —had been declared a federal holiday this year, for many Black people the observance felt empty, when we consider that the U.S. government has yet to pass the Emmett Till Antilynching Act; legal scholarship like critical race theory and journalism projects like The 1619 Project and its creators are facing attack, and voting rights are being stripped before our very eyes. Houston’s national anthem performance arriving at this thirty-year milestone, is a reminder that to quote Nikole Hannah-Jones, “America wasn’t a democracy until Black Americans made it one.” And we are still doing that costly work.\n\nAs a New Yorker, I remember being very excited about the showdown between The New York Giants and The Buffalo Bills. It was the first Super Bowl in which both teams were from the same state, and it was the first trip to the Bowl for the Bills. It was the only Super Bowl decided by one point and the first Super Bowl in which neither team committed a turnover. The Giants, who had only been to the Bowl once before, also set a Super Bowl record-holding possession of the ball for 40 minutes and 33 seconds.[2] In what is widely considered to be one of the greatest Super Bowl games in NFL history, when the Giants won, I remember the way New York City celebrated and somewhere around here, I still have the commemorative tee shirt. But the win paled in comparison to Houston’s stunning, platinum-selling performance.\n\nBy 1991, Whitney Houston was on top of the world. She was America’s sweetheart and simultaneously represented an ocean of possibility for young black girls everywhere. She had just recently released her third album, the L.A. and Babyface produced I’m Your Baby Tonight, which was starkly more urban that her first two pop smashes. I’m Your Baby Tonight was, in a way, a reminder that Whitney was indeed still ours — a fine line Houston would have to dance, certainly up until The Bodyguard in 1992. Although Whitney had reclaimed her black voice (and audience) with I’m Your Baby Tonight, her national anthem performance made her a patriot in the eyes of white America. She didn’t merely sing the anthem; in the context of world-stage events, Houston had a weight on her shoulders that far surpassed landing the high notes.\n\nSuper Bowl XXV was actually a game that almost didn’t happen. Only ten days prior, President George H. W. Bush set Operation Desert Storm into motion, and the first air attacks were launched on Iraq and Kuwait. Many wondered if moving forward with the Super Bowl would be safe from a national security perspective, and if the celebratory nature of the event was appropriate amidst the beginning of an active and controversial war. Bush’s stony remarks only added to the heightened sensitivity. “And so, life goes on,” he famously stated. “We’re not going to screech everything to a halt in terms of the recreational activities, and I cite the Super Bowl. And I am not going to screech my life to a halt out of some fear about Saddam Hussein. And I think that’s a good, clear signal for all Americans to send halfway around the world.”\n\nThe stakes could not have been higher.\n\n“We talked about how it should feel,” recounts Ricky Minor, who was Houston’s musical director from 1989-1999. “We talked about Marvin Gaye, and how he’d done the national anthem at the NBA All Star Game.” Houston confessed to Minor that, in fact, the only version of the anthem she’d ever liked was Gaye’s. She particularly appreciated the 4/4 time signature, the tempo, the ease of the performance and she was inspired by the freedom of his phrasing.\n\nProduced by Minor and Houston, they changed the meter to 4/4 to allow for a more soulful approach to the song. But it was John Clayton’s arrangment paired with Whitney’s vocal genius, which made this the greatest anthem of all time. Clayton, a profoundly gifted bassist, composer, arranger, conductor, producer, and educator, created a soundscape that I literally cannot listen to without weeping. I have tried. Thirty years later, it remains impossible. Ironically, all of what I love about this version of the anthem – and presumably what most of you love about it – is what was initially resented about it, when it was first presented to the orchestra.\n\nClayton’s arrangment paints the song with colors of the Black American story. Within the backdrop of pomp and circumstance, his reharmonization draws you to a spiritual source. He amalgamates gospel, R&B, jazz, classical, and military marches, weaving a prose deeply resonate with the black experience. The use of dissonance, the chord progressions, the harmonic intricacies, and the time signature shook the foundation of the song. These elements suddenly made the anthem ours, too. The initial criticisms of the arrangement are therefore not merely musical. What was sensed in the music — its blackness — and the knee-jerk need to reject it, reveals much about the American psyche. Extraordinarily, the arrangement challenged the psyche, without changing the words, to see America for more clearly. In the 2018 documentary, Whitney, writer Cinque Henderson says, “Black people always had a very fraught relationship to ‘The Star Spangled Banner.’ It’s a song about war, and the organs of state violence in the US have just as often been used against black people as they have against enemies. She had the radical impact of highlighting the theme of freedom.”\n\nWatching the live performance, everything about it remains astounding, down to the wardrobe. Interestingly, the now-iconic look wasn’t the original intention. In Robyn Crawford’s memoir, A Song For You, Houston’s best friend and closest confident shares how the famous outfit came to be. “The plan was for her to stand on a podium, backed by a full orchestra all dressed in black tie,” Crawford explains. “And she was to wear a sleeveless, black cocktail dress and heels.” The Tampa weather had gotten far too cool, and after sound check while back at the hotel, Crawford recalls Houston coming to her concerned about the wardrobe. Crawford suggested she wear the track suit still packed in her suitcase. She took the advice, did her own hair and make up for the occasion and added the white headband on her own, finishing the look with pair of white and red Nike Cortez sneakers.\n\nOver a roaring crowd and through the palpable surging energy, the announcement commenced:\n\n“And now to honor America, especially the brave men and women serving our nation in the Persian Gulf, and throughout the world, please join in the singing of our national anthem. The anthem will be followed by a flyover of F-16 jets from the 56th Tactical Training Wing at MacDill Air Force Base and will be performed by The Florida Orchestra under the direction of maestro Jahja Ling, and sung by GRAMMY-award winner… Whitney Houston.”\n\nIt opens with a mammoth wave of drum rolls, followed by a series of E-flats (I assume to give Houston a point of reference to come in on the right key) and she begins. “Oh, Say Can You See…” her commanding voice seeming to overpower the thousands of cheering football fans. Her phrasing over the 4/4 time signature immediately grabs you, in the ways that it did when Gaye sang it eight years prior. But with Houston, she’s like the eye within a sonic hurricane, surrounded by a massive orchestral wonderland. She is strong… full-throated and projecting the song with almost studious attention. And then something astounding happens.\n\nThe second stanza.\n\nHouston, pulls her voice back to an utterly angelic space. “Whose Broad Stripes / And Bright Stars,” she swoons as the orchestra grounds itself. The percussion fades almost completely out, and the strings glisten with a beautiful countermelody, and the bass (or perhaps the cello?) cuts through with this gorgeous swell.\n\n“Through The Perilous Fight…”\n\nHOLE UP! HOLE UP!\n\nThat. Part. Right. There?!?! This is where Clayton’s genius orchestration launches the song into the heavens. On that second measure of the second verse, Clayton places an Ab7SUS over the first syllable of “perilous”.\n\nWHAAAAAT?!?!?\n\nTraditionally, if we consider the key that Whitney is singing in, the chord would have been a basic F minor (then going to a Bb7 to Eb). But Clayton, instead of utilizing the F minor, as he does in the first stanza, chooses an Ab7SUS chord. SUS chords, or suspended chords, especially those voiced this way, are often used in various genres of black music, particularly gospel and R&B — two places where Houston’s musical pedigree are firmly rooted. You hear her laying into these changes, completely in her bag. I find it fascinating that Clayton wrote an Ab7SUS here. Think of the word “perilous”: unsafe, treacherous, life-threatening. These are the descriptives that could come to mind. The stringency of the original chord denotes this sort of traditionally patriotic description of a heroic, American scene. Yet, Clayton writes an arrangment here which elevates your entire soul. For me, the lyric becomes different. For me, the peril in this context is now that of my ancestors fighting for their freedom. It sounds like a salve for their wounds. It is a lyric/music juxtaposition that makes perfect sense when I hear it in that context. Houston’s delivery and the way she draws on the word… you can hear both the exhaustion and the determination connected to this fight.\n\n“O’er The Ramparts We Watched”\n\nWAIT… STOP…\n\nClayton ascends the song once again. Traditionally, “ramparts” would have been sung over an Ab chord. Clayton now deepens the hue of the phrase, assigning a DbMAJ7 there instead. It’s over this phrase — “O’er The Ramparts We Watched” — that we hear Whitney do the first of what would be very few riffs in this performance… it’s a delicious moment where you can feel she is totally moved and compelled to place a beautiful, soulful inflection over the lyric.\n\nIf you watch the video of the broadcast, when she hits that second stanza, there are three camera shots strung together. The first is a row of flags, including a confederate flag, blowing in the Tampa breeze. The next shot zooms in on a beautiful, dark complexioned military person who is obviously deeply moved by the moment, and whose intense eyes seem to carry the history of our journey on this land. It then cuts to a white woman with Saved By the Bell-esque hair (it was the 90s), waving a hand sized American flag back and forth, as she proudly mouths the words. It is in these few seconds of a real-time montage, that we witness the ingrained violence of this country, the enduring patriotism of Black people, rooted in the belief that America’s best ideals will one day coming to pass, and how white America gets to smile through it all, obliviously. It is one of the most compelling ten-seconds of footage I’ve ever seen.\n\n“And The Rockets Red Glare”\n\nWhitney brings it home in a way that foreshadows the solidifying of her “The Voice” epithet. Jumping from that celestial second stanza, into a thunderous home stretch, she takes the crowd to an unfathomable pinnacle, singing a resplendent high Ab at “O’er The Land Of The Free,” and by the time she gets to “And The Home Of The Brave,” where she holds “brave” for almost ten seconds, we are forever changed.\n\nI have always found it particularly difficult to participate in the trappings of American patriotism. When I was a schoolgirl, I would reluctantly stand for the Pledge of Allegiance every day as it was broadcasted over the loudspeaker into the individual classrooms, but I refused to recite it, and I refused to place my hand across my chest to my heart. To me, there was never anything fundamentally endearing about America, so that gesture felt particularly uncomfortable. In fact, I knew that when I found myself in a neighborhood where there were too many American flags hanging from front porches, that I was on the wrong side of town, and absolutely unsafe. Those bold banners were a sign of patriotism for some; a signal to panic for others.\n\nWhen Whitney Houston performed the song — brown, woman, beautiful, captivating — it was almost like an extension of what Marian Anderson did in 1939 at the Lincoln Memorial. Much had changed, yet so much had not. By 1991, the black community was still reeling from the Reagan administration, the crack epidemic was at its peak, and within weeks of the anthem, 15-year-old Latasha Harlins was murdered, and Rodney King was beaten to within an inch of his life by the Los Angeles Police Department. America was still going to America. Houston’s world-shattering performance wafted in the air throughout these pivotal moments in American history. It echoed and it hovered and it haunted. It held up that mirror which Anderson held, and which Gaye held. And America continues to refuse to look itself in the eyes.\n\nThroughout her career, Whitney Houston managed two distinct audiences. By and large, white people loved Whitney Houston for an entirely different reason than black people loved Whitney Houston. Much like in the way this nation’s anthem represents two very different things to the citizens of this country. Houston’s rendition became a chart-topping success but moreover, it was seen as a way to bring the country together during a difficult time of war. Black people have historically been tasked with the responsibility of seeing America through troubled times, which I find most ironic. If only America would task itself with living up to its founding ideals. Imagine that anthem.\n\nWhat, to the American slave, is your 4th of July? I answer: a day that reveals to him, more than all\n\nother days in the year, the gross injustice and cruelty to which he is the constant victim. To him,\n\nyour celebration is a sham; your boasted liberty, an unholy license; your national greatness,\n\nswelling vanity; your sounds of rejoicing are empty and heartless; your denunciations of tyrants,\n\nbrass fronted impudence; your shouts of liberty and equality, hollow mockery; your prayers and\n\nhymns, your sermons and thanksgivings, with all your religious parade, and solemnity, are, to him,\n\nmere bombast, fraud, deception, impiety, and hypocrisy — a thin veil to cover up crimes which\n\nwould disgrace a nation of savages. There is not a nation on the earth guilty of practices, more\n\nshocking and bloody, than are the people of these United States, at this very hour.\n\n– Frederick Douglass\n\nIn Appreciation of Labi Siffre: A super abridged reflection on folk music, Black erasure, and an unfamiliar giant.\n\nIt’s been 50 years since Black-British singer-songwriter-instrumentalist -poet-activist Labi Siffre released his self titled debut.\n\nIn 2017, I began working as a consulting producer on a documentary about musician, playwright, activist, and “To Be Young, Gifted, and Black” composer Weldon Irvine. The general nescience about this important artist was in large measure the genesis of the doc as well as a critical theme in its narrative.\n\nThe Unsung Artist is not a new archetype in black music. I have a few in my own family, and I know many people who share that story. During the course of film production, the way I would find myself opening conversations about Weldon was, “He’s an artist that you didn’t know you actually know.” I wanted people to understand that although this name may not be readily identifiable, his essential body of work has created deep cultural connections that have become part of our collective consciousness. I wanted them to realize that learning his name was an opportunity for us to begin to offer a sort of intentional gratitude.\n\nLike Irvine, the music of prolific singer-songwriter and folk-influenced artist Labi Siffre is instantly recognizable, largely owing to sampling. “I Got The…” from his 1975 album, Remember My Song, was sampled by Dr. Dre on Eminem’s debut, The Slim Shady LP, catapulting the rapper to stardom. Before that, Jay-Z and producer Ski Beatz borrowed from the same song on Jay-Z’s In My Lifetime Vol. 1 masterwork, which spent a whopping 70 weeks on the Billboard charts. Later, Kanye West would sample Siffre’s “My Song” (Crying, Laughing, Loving, Lying, 1972) on his 2007 album, Graduation. In 2014, singer Kelis beautifully covered Siffre’s “Bless the Telephone” (The Singer and the Song, 1971). More recently, music supervisors would find a gold mine in Siffre’s affectional “Watch Me” from the same album, as it was featured in the first season of the hit NBC drama series, This Is Us. Yet, for all of Siffre’s musical seepage into American popular culture, his name remains widely unknown to the masses of us.\n\nThis year marks the 50th anniversary of Labi Siffre’s self-titled debut. Siffre, a Black man from Hammersmith, London, came on the recording scene in 1970, after spending time in the house band of Annie’s Room, a jazz nightclub owned by Annie Ross of the famed jazz vocal group, Lambert, Hendricks & Ross. Citing Monk, Miles, Mingus, Coltrane, Billie, and Sassy as his songwriting influences along with Little Richard and Muddy Waters, Siffre found his earliest musical inspirations by way of his brother’s extensive record collection. Siffre released ten albums over the course of the next three decades, with a particularly creative streak in the 1970s, as a predominately folk-oriented musician.\n\nOpenly gay, black, and atheist, it is relatively safe to deduce that Siffre’s trajectory toward eminence was impeded in a society where white supremacy and religious provincialism were and continue to be pervasive influences. Perhaps it is also presumptuous to surmise that fame or celebrity were in any way a goal of the visionary singer-songwriter. However personal the gripe may be on the matter of Siffre’s relative obscurity (his intervals of reclusiveness duly noted), the sobering limitations for black recording artists is a veritable reality. Namely, within folk music.\n\nLike most of America’s earliest music, its history is looted without fail by people with unmerited access to powerful platforms that allow them to perpetuate false and damaging narratives. To date, folk’s prevailing image is well-meaning, white people with long hair strumming guitar strings and singing about peace and love. The problem with this composite is that it woefully crops out its origin and craftspeople. Apropos of mention, let it also be said that Black people are all-too-often relegated to the “architect” epithet. While it is true that Black people are the founders of most traditional American music, folk included, these truths are, as a matter of practice, deported to the back burner of relevance or importance. The distortions of black value overall are essential to the lies that shape the story of American music, as told to us.\n\nAs a means to an end, the actual creating of an art form has to somehow therefore pale in comparison to those who partake in and profit from its adaptation, its interpretation, its theft. It inspires me to make it plain that Black people are not only the architects of American folk music, but were quintessential participants in its expression, inspiring all those who would partake and subsequently become the faces of the tradition. Like all black American music, there is a link between freedom and the creativity birthed from the quest. You don’t have American music without an expression of resistance. Folk music is black music. And while there is most certainly a beautiful and vast and rich contribution to the genre from white musicians, out of its proper context, this contribution becomes grandiloquent by way of an irresponsible, reckless, and harmful narrative that not enough white artists bother to correct. To deny the genesis of the folk genre and its participants and to willingly participate in the erasure of blackness from the folk tradition is absurd and unacceptable.\n\nThe list of indispensable, founding folk artists whose tradition has made the folk genre possible is rich and extensive. Artists like Leadbelly, Elizabeth Cotten, and later, Odetta, are but a few of the biggest influences of most white folk musicians who would come to prominence in the folk genre’s golden era of the ’60s and ’70s, and the more forthcoming of them — greats like Woody Guthrie, Bob Dylan, and Pete Seeger — would proudly tell you so. (Dylan would also just as proudly admit to lifting from his good friend Len Chandler, another unsung, Black folk artist, at the beginning of his career.1)\n\nWhile I’d been fostered by folk-soul/folk-rock greats like Bill Withers and Richie Havens, it wasn’t until I heard Tracy Chapman as a young girl that I actually saw a black woman rise to prominence as a folk-leaning artist in real time. The musical daughter of artists like Cotten, Odetta, and Sweet Honey in the Rock, but also someone who grew up in the 1970s, influenced by soul, jazz, country, and blues, Chapman was one of a few black folk-identified artists I heard in the 1980s, and she was for sure the only black, woman, folk megastar I saw. I remember a distressingly misguided notion floating about that Chapman was “doing white music” and this disconnect remains, although artists like Meshell Ndegeocello, Ben Harper, Brittany Howard, Toshi Reagon, and even India.Arie, Lauryn Hill, and H.E.R. have tremendously closed the gap. But whatever erroneous claims were being flung about with regard to Chapman and her blackness or her music’s perceived whiteness, my inclinations toward folk music were always strong. The sound purely appealed to me.\n\n“The insistence that one should be ‘ethnic’ is endemic, irritating, and insulting,” Siffre reflected in a 2012 interview. The UK’s music industry is historically analogous to that of the States when it comes to Black artists who desire to color outside of the industry’s imposed delineations. The boxing-in of Black artists into agreeable categories creates deliberate distance between themselves and their own architecture. Almost always, the result is a perpetual frustration accompanied by the haunting backdrop of marginal success for artists who — but for their blackness — would have otherwise gained mass appeal, if not critical acclaim. Labi Siffre and someone like Nick Drake, for example, should be discoursed with similar deference. Instead, Siffre, unlike Drake, is largely ancillary when it comes to the wider discussion of ’60s and ’70s folk. By no means should he be.\n\n“I’m in favor of accepting the fact that when one is writing, one is always writing about oneself, no matter how you express yourself on whatever issue,” Siffre said in a 1997 interview with U.K. magazine The Argotist.\n\nThe notion that all writing is essentially autobiographical is a principle motif in Siffre’s oeuvre. From his Twitter bio — Atheist, Homosexual, Black, Songwriter, Musician, Singer, Poet, Social-Commentator. Twice a widower. English, British, Philosophically/Spiritually an EU Citizen — one gleans that his music examines nearly each description. An artist historically committed to challenging the norms of society’s immoralities, through his music, Labi Siffre has consistently leaned into himself, his experiences, and the identities that he affirms for himself with a striking degree of honesty, vulnerability, and bravery.\n\nAn admitted “poet first,” Siffre’s lyricism is visceral and deeply intimate. Among a series of torch songs, his debut album also tackles generational tensions concerning the social dynamics of the 1960s, with an ever-increasing focus on conscious themes throughout his recording career. Societal ills like racism, homophobia, and war were the roots of Siffre’s blistering lyrical content. Amplified by his astounding vocal clarity, his lyrics refuse inconspicuousness. They also never compete against his remarkable musicality.\n\nEach song has a way of beautifully blindsiding you — there’s no real predictability of approach. He has a way of surprising the listener by turning a progression on its head, taking it in a totally unexpected — and always enchanting — direction. He masterfully folds irony and humor into his music through a rhythm, a lyrical sentiment, a run on his guitar, or by using brilliant paradoxical concepts. There is something daring, fresh, and unabashed about Siffre that makes his music practically addictive.\n\nThere’s also the influence of Siffre’s virtuosity that I find quite apparent, by way of his inclinations for using intricate time signatures, string arrangements, and unpredictable harmonic progressions. On a song like “Here We Are,” for example, Siffre’s dreamy vamp-out is reminiscent of the extraordinary Argentinian-Swedish singer-songwriter-guitarist, José González. His enchanting “Blue Lady,” is another example of a song that feels like a blueprint for contemporary folk artists like González with its mixture of African percussive elements and harmonic genius.\n\nBy 1975, Siffre had begun pushing past the margins of what was considered to be in the folk genre, with his first three albums solidifying his eclectic and ingenious expressions and interpretations. Labi Siffre, The Singer and the Song, Crying, Laughing, Loving, Lying, and For the Children each fully captivating and in good company with the early ’70s prolificacy of artists like Stevie Wonder, Donny Hathaway, Joni Mitchell, and Earth, Wind & Fire. But Remember My Song was a clear creative departure from previous works. “I Got The…” opens with a now-classic guitar lick. Chock full of funk, via the drums of rock drummer Ian Wallace (Bob Dylan, Esther Phillips, Bonnie Raitt), guitar-bass duo Chas Hodges and Dave Peacock, and Siffre himself on keyboards, Siffre makes a statement from the first track that the breadth of his artistry was that much more massive. The song offers not one but two stunning passages that birthed hip-hop anthems.\n\nSiffre’s appeal to hip-hop producers is poetic considering that on “Too Late,” the first track from his first album in 1970, he delivers scathing, diss-track level lyrics, constituting one of the greatest “Get lost!” songs of his time. Yet, for Siffre, much of the engrained machismo of hip-hop is in direct conflict with the core of his personhood. On the matter of granting Dr. Dre permissions to use “I Got The…” for Eminem’s “My Name Is” he said, “Dissing the victims of bigotry — women as bitches, homosexuals as faggots — is lazy writing. Diss the bigots not their victims. I denied sample rights till that lazy writing was removed. I should have stipulated ‘all versions’ but at that time, knew little about rap’s ‘clean’ and ‘explicit’ modes, so they managed to get the lazy lyric on versions other than the single and first album.”\n\nIn May of this year, Siffre released “(Love Is Love Is Love) Why Isn’t Love Enough?” a song directly advocating gay rights. In 2020, this may not be considered a gallant act, but considering that Siffre’s open homosexuality dates back to at least the beginning of his recording career, the song symbolizes both Siffre’s commitment to fusing his art with his activism, and the road his contributions continue to pave along the same path that Bessie Smith, Ma Rainy, Tony Jackson, Billy Strayhorn, and others cobbled. His 1987 hit single, “Something Inside So Strong,” which brought him out of his retirement of some measure, was written as part of the growing, global condemnation of apartheid in South Africa, becoming his most successful song, to date. Yet, Siffre also discloses the more personal roots of the song years later. “As soon as I’d written the first two lines — ‘the higher you build your barriers the taller I become’ — I realized with a shock that I was writing about my life as a homosexual.” Siffre, who officially registered a Civil Partnership with his partner of fifty years in 2005 (the soonest this was allowed in the UK) that lasted until his beloved’s passing, continues to write and publish poetry, and engage in social activism for LGBTQ rights.\n\nThe effects of Siffre’s unconcealed queerness on his career arc may be as indeterminable as the effects of his devout atheism, but such ostracized identities — especially encased in blackness — certainly allude to an arduous path. “With neither my permission nor my understanding, I was baptized and confirmed a Catholic,” says Siffre in an interview with the U.K. quarterly, New Humanist. Siffre recorded several songs speaking to his absence of belief in God, most notably on his 1973 album, For the Children. On the song “Prayer,” Siffre plays a lullaby-like melody while sweetly singing of an at-best apathetic Creator, considering the pain and anguish experienced on Earth by the grieving women described in his lyrics. The song ends:\n\nSo God in heaven above / What are you thinking of?\n\nIs this the way you play?\n\nWell, can’t you hear them weep? / Now children, mind your feet\n\nMaybe God has gone to sleep\n\nSiffre follows up with “Let’s Pretend,” a call for a leveling up of humanity. I would describe this song using spiritual nomenclature; it is a call to connect to one’s higher self. As someone who is not at all religious, but is a devoted believer in a Divine Creator, I find it difficult to find offense in Siffre’s expressions of non-belief within the context of his lyrics. The song calls upon those who use religion as a means to an end, to instead live up to the actual tenets of scripture:\n\nLet’s pretend we believe his holy word\n\nHe has spoken and we have heard, let’s pretend\n\nLet’s pretend ‘though he spoke through different men\n\nThe basic truths remain, let’s pretend\n\nLet’s pretend that the numbers five to ten\n\nWere written for all men (with lightning as the pen)\n\nLet’s pretend, let’s pretend what happened then\n\nLet’s pretend\n\nLet’s pretend that the Pope sells all his jewels\n\nTo feed the hungry, ooh let’s pretend\n\nLet’s pretend religious leaders say war is wrong\n\nNo matter who is strong, let’s pretend\n\nLet’s pretend religion excommunicates those\n\nWho deal in hate and leaves them to their fate\n\nLet’s pretend these evil people give a damn\n\nAnd start loving their fellow man\n\nLet’s pretend\n\nOver forty years later, I find connection between this song and the words spoken by Siffre at the close of his 2017 TEDx Talk, entitled Disturbing Definitions. “We don’t find meaning, we make meaning, and then we lack the courage to accept responsibility for the meanings we make. If meaning is just laying around, and we find it, we are not responsible for it; we’ve just come across it in untidy heaps, scattered across a panorama. If we make meaning, that makes us responsible for the meanings we make, and that responsibility takes us out of our comfort zone.”\n\nThe righteousness in Siffre’s work is his sheer unwillingness to mince words or equivocate, whatever the subject matter. Nevertheless, an artistry wholly devoted to truth is incongruous with the codes of the music industry at large. To be an unwavering force in an industry that values only the veneer of virtue, Siffre’s messages become that much more significant.\n\nIn honor of the 50th anniversary of Siffre’s debut release, it’s my hope that you’ll explore the catalogue of Labi Siffre. For the purposes of this piece, I’ve concentrated on what would be considered the creative pinnacle of his opus, but I encourage you to become familiar with the entirety of the bold and vastly creative songwriter and singer whose name should at long last be attached to his masterpieces.\n\n1.
