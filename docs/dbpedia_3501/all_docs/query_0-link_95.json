        "text": "Yuletide carolers are all types - gospel, traditional, new age, soul, rock, blues, country and, yes, even lounge/swing.\n\nChristmas music is currently blaring at shopping malls, restaurants, department stores - even gas stations. It's even filling up our local performance venues at Temple Square, the Delta Center and Hansen Planetarium.Hansen Planetarium?\n\nYes, space music artist Jonn Serrie will perform four holiday concerts at the planetarium, Sunday and Monday, Dec. 14 and 15. Curtain is 7 p.m. and 8:30 p.m. (Tickets are $12 for adults and $10 for children 12 and under.)\n\nSerrie's concert will be promoting his new album \"Under a Midnight Clear\" (Miramar), which is filled with ambivalent, dreamy sounds of chimes, choruses and whips of strings. \"With this album, I wanted to return to the holiday season, back to a time of wonder and joy,\" Serrie has said.\n\nSome of the tracks include \"The Holly & the Ivy,\" \"O Holy Night,\" \"Away In a Manger\" and \"The First Noel.\"\n\nIf you're looking for other styles, here are some selected new Christmas albums - ranging from Barney to Dwight Yoakum and most everything in between - reviewed by Deseret News staff writers.\n\nSomewhere in this list, you're bound to find what you're looking for:\n\nDAVID ARKENSTONE; \"Enchantment: A Magical Christmas\" (Narada).\n\nThis latest offering from the master of mystical music is billed as wonderous music that captures the sparkle of the holidays, and it certainly lives up to that billing. His ethereal interpretations of popular carols and songs such as \"We Three Kings,\" \"Do You Hear What I Hear,\" \"Angels we Have Heard On High\" and \"The Coventry Carol\" are delightful. From the magical, fairylike \"Silver Bells\" to the mystical drama of several selections of the \"Nutcracker,\" it is music performed with \"energy and affection,\" say the liner notes. He draws us into a magical world, one we feel reluctant to leave nearly an hour later. - Carma Wadley\n\nASLEEP AT THE WHEEL; \"Merry Texas Christmas, Y'all\" (High Street).\n\nMerry Christmas, Texas-style is exactly what this collection offers. Filled with Texas swing and Texas boogie, it offers toe-tapping, party-in-full-swing holiday music. \" `Twas The Night Before,\" is not your ordinary \"Night Before Christmas\" song, nor is the \"Swingin' Silent Night\" or the \"Jingle Bell Boogie.\"\n\nAsleep At The Wheel gets some help from Willie Nelson on \"Pretty Paper,\" and from Trish Hinijosa on \"Feliz Navidad.\" The collection shows off their tradmark, laid-back sound. - C.W.\n\nRANDALL ATCHESON; \"Christmas by Candlelight\" (RCA).\n\nPianist Randall Atcheson hopes that his collection of songs of the church and the hearth will evoke images of both the candlelit nativity scene and candles on the hearth - the light of a soft, glowing, mood-filled holiday. And it does that well. Atcheson is something of a child prodigy, playing university-level music by age 12, and he brings both talent and passion to the job. Although he is at home on the entire keyboard, he makes particularly good use of the upper ranges.\n\nThe songs are traditional favorites, including \"It Came Upon A Midnight Clear,\" \"O Little Town Of Bethlehem,\" \"Away In A Manger,\" \"The Holly and the Ivy\" and \"White Christmas.\" - C.W.\n\nBARNEY; \"Happy Holidays Love, Barney\" (Lyrick).\n\nWatch out grownups. Don't pout or shout. Barney's made a Christmas album and he's all out and about.\n\nCynical adults might as well give up. Barney is still a good role model for kids. And his Christmas album is chock-full of sing-a-long staples such as \"Jingle Bells,\" \"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer,\" \"A Holly Jolly Christmas,\" `The 12 Days of Christmas\" and \"Winter Wonderland.\" - Scott Iwasaki\n\nJAYMZ BEE AND THE ROYAL JELLY ORCHESTRA; \"A Christmas Cocktail\" (Milan).\n\nThe nightclub/lounge sound arrives with ringing bells with Jaymz Bee and the Royal Jelly Orchestra. A swinging version of \"Jingle Bells\" and a cha-cha take on \"Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!\" are a couple of the goodies on this album.\n\nOther treats include a marimba take on \"The Christmas Song\" and a be-bop romp of \"Carol of the Bells.\" Good for the camp and fun for everything else. - S.I.\n\nRICK BRAUN; \"Christmas Present\" (Bluemoon/Atlantic).\n\nThe trumpet is Rick Braun's instrument, and he shows it off well in a collection with bluesy, jazzy overtones. There are a few traditional songs (\"Little Drummer Boy,\" \"The Christmas Song,\" \"O Tannenbaum\"), but many more of his own compositions, including the soft and mysterious \"Bell, Book and Candle,\" the elegant sounds of \"Christmas Present\" and the delightful \"Grandma's Music Box.\" He brings out the flugelhorn to add richness to \"Newborn Christmas\" and \"Maybe Next Year.\" And vocals add to \"Far Away.\" This project began because Braun started recording songs and sending them to his friends for Christmas; now everyone can receive his Christmas greetings. - C.W.\n\nBRICKMAN, JIM; \"The Gift\" (Windham Hill).\n\nPianist Jim Brickman serves up a melodic version of Christmas that creates a soft and peaceful mood. And when words are called for, such as in his \"The Gift,\" (which is a love song as much as a Christmas song) he brings in the talent of a few friends - Collin Raye, Susan Ashton, Kenny Loggins and Point of Grace. His own \"Starbright,\" \"Angels,\" \"Fireside,\" \"Hope Is Born Again\" and \"Dreams Come True\" capture the hopeful, uplifting aspect of the season, and mix well with traditional favorites such as \"Joy To The World,\" \"What Child Is This\" and \"O Little Town of Bethlehem.\" - C.W.\n\nPEABO BRYSON; \"Peace on Earth\" (Angel).\n\nThe rich, warm voice of Peabo Bryson is showcased well in this collection. He teams up with Sandi Patti for an elegant \"O Holy Night,\" and with Roberta Flack for \"As Long As There's Christmas\" (from Disney's \"Beauty and the Beast\" Christmas video). \"Born on Christmas Day,\" which he helped write, is a powerful retelling of the nativity story. Also included are songs with a message of faith and hope, \"This Christmas\" and \"Moments Like This\" as well as a number of traditional Christmas songs, including \"The Christmas Song,\" \"I'll Be Home For Christmas\" and \"Silent Night.\" - C.W.\n\nANN HAMPTON CALLAWAY; \"This Christmas\" (Angel).\n\nOther people have been singing Ann Hamptom Callaway's songs for some time; now she offers her own versions of songs like \"This Christmas,\" from `Happy Holidays,\" and \"Christmas in Manhattan,\" a jazzy, sophisticated tribute to the Big Apple. Her throaty, alto voice gives texture to other Christmas songs like \"Jingle Bells,\" \"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas\" and \"White Christmas.\" Kenny Rankin joins her on \"Baby It's Cold Outside,\" and she gives a markedly different tempo to \"Carol of the Bells.\" Her own \"God Bless My Family,\" is a song of the '90s, written in honor of friends who have died of AIDS and her grandmother, who died at Christmastime: \"This Christmas, I will find a way/To let each face I've ever loved shine out in me/God bless my family.\" - C.W.\n\nTHE CAMBRIDGE SINGERS; \"Christmas Star\" (Collegium Records).\n\nIf it's traditional choral music you want, few do it better than John Rutter and the Cambridge Singers. They bring a rich, elegant sound to these carols and folk songs that lends itself to repeated listening.\n\nIncluded here are Rutter arrangements of such favorites as \"I Wonder As I Wander,\" \"Three Kings of Orient,\" \"How Great Our Joy\" \"Rise Up Shepherd And Follow\" and \"O Come, All Ye Faithful.\" There are also some lesser-known, but equally pretty songs in \"All My Heart This Night Rejoices,\" \" 'Twas in the Mood of Winter Time\" and \"O Little One Sweet.\" It's an album that perfectly captures the beauty and spirit of the season. - C.W.\n\nTHE CANADIAN BRASS; \"A Christmas Experiment\" (RCA Victor).\n\nWhen the Canadian Brass did a Christmas special for TV, they decided to make it a family project and get all their children involved. It would, they felt, lead to a \"wonderfully spontaneous and playful\" production. And that it does, at least in this soundtrack version. Whether they are enjoying the Santa side (\"Jolly Old St. Nick,\" \"Frosty The Snowman,\" \"The Night Before Christmas\") or featuring traditional carols (\"Angels We Have Heard on High,\" \"Lo How a Rose e'er Blooming,\" \"Little Drummer Boy\") this is feel-good music. They get a lot of help from children's choirs, but it never overrides that traditional brass sound. - C.W.\n\nTHE CHRISTMAS JUG BAND; \"Rhythm On the Roof\" (Globe Records).\n\nWith titles like \"Daddy's Drinkin Up Our Christmas,\" \"Washboard Road\" and \"Santa Don't Do It,\" these are not the songs you are likely to hear from your local neighborhood carolers - unless you live in the backwoods. They do include a a couple of familiar songs, \"Winter Wonderland\" and \"Silver Bells,\" but little else falls into that traditional category. Still, you can tell these eight crazy Californians (who get some help from a passel of others) are having lots of fun, and it spills over with toe-tapping rhythm. There's a bit of Cajun, a bit of the blues, a bit of rap - and yes, a genuine jug band, including jaw harp, washtub bass, washboard, guitar, accordian, sax and trumpet. - C.W.\n\nARTURO DELMONI & FRIENDS; \"Rejoice: A String Quartet Christmas Vol. 2\" (John Marks Records).\n\nThis chamber quartet, consisting of two violins and viola and cello, provides the simple, classic harmony that showcases traditional Christmas music so well. Some 22 songs are included, mostly carols and hymns such as \"In the Bleak Mid-Winter,\" \"All Through The Night,\" \"Ding Dong Merrily on High,\" \"Once In David's Royal City\" and the \"Wexford Carol.\" Two beautiful versions of \"Ave Maria\" (the Bach-Gounod and the Schubert) take advantage of the talent of guest harpist Emily Mitchell. No gimmicks, just the pure music, creating a soft and mellow mood. - C.W.\n\nDISNEY'S `BEAUTY AND THE BEAST\"; \"The Enchanted Christmas\" (Walt Disney Records).\n\n\"Beauty and the Beast\" has been one of Disney's most successful movies, so it's no surprise they have followed up with a sequel, a video centered around Christmas. The story - and this soundtrack album - feature all of the characters and many of the voices from the original. Nobody does storytelling music quite like Disney, and this one's no exception. But even if you don't know the story, you can enjoy the fun and whimsy of songs such as \"Don't Fall in Love,\" \"Stories\" and \"A Cut Above the Rest.\"\n\nA number of traditional carols are included, such as \"Do You Hear What I Hear,\" \"The First Noel,\" \"What Child Is This\" and \"The Twelve Days of Christmas.\" A showcase piece is the duet by Peabo Bryson and Roberta Flack, \"As Long As There's Christmas.\" And the instrumental numbers at the end, \"Belle's Magical Gift,\" `Fife's Yuletide Theme\" and the \"Enchanted Christmas Finale\" capture perfectly the magic of the season. - C.W.\n\nPLACIDO DOMINGO, YING HUANG and MICHAEL BOLTON; \"Merry Christmas from Vienna\" (Sony Classical).\n\nAn annual Christmas concert filmed in Vienna, anchored by Placido Domingo and featuring other guests has become a tradition on PBS. This year Michael Bolton and Ying Huang join Domingo and the Vienna Symphony Orchestra for an elegant concert. Bolton, who has made his name in pop circles, doesn't have quite the power and richness of Domingo (who does?) but he holds his own quite well. Huang also has strength and an exquisite sound, and the three voices blend well on shared numbers.\n\nIncluded are works such as \"Ave Maria,\" \"Maria Wiegenlied,\" \"Weilvachten,\" \"In The Bleak Midwinter\" and \"Villancico Yuacano.\" \"The Children of Christmas,\" written by Placido Domingo Jr. is appealing, as is the medley of traditional carols. - C.W.\n\nDORDAN; \"The Night Before: A Celtic Christmas\" (Narada).\n\nIn Ireland, Christmas Eve bids travelers to rest, and family to enjoy home and hearth. Dordan, a quartet of women living in County Galway, offer both restful and hearth-tapping music in this collection of Irish favorites. Not all are easily recognized as Christmas songs, but the combination of vocal and instrumental is certainly well-suited for the season.\n\nIncluded are the lovely `Enniscorthy Christmas Carol,\" a tribute to \"Winter Solstice,\" \"Ding Dong Merrily on High\" and \"Shades of Auld Lang Syne\" as well as some of the reels and jigs and airs that characterize Celtic music. - C.W.\n\nFIVE CHINESE BROTHERS; \"A Window Shopper's Christmas\" (Prime CD).\n\nThis so-called Americana/rock outfit has stopped by the Zephyr a few times and have garnered a few fans in Salt Lake City who will undoubtedly enjoy this Christmas album.\n\nMost of the 13 songs are penned by the band or members of the band, except for \"O Little Town of Bethlehem.\"\n\nBut titles such as \"Make the Rafters Ring,\" \"Department Store Santa Clause Strike\" and \"Christmas on Interstate 80\" give a little taste of the sidewinding humor that runs through the band's personality. - S.I.\n\nROBERTA FLACK; \"The Christmas Album\" (Angel).\n\nRoberta Flack's voice evokes the feel of silk and satin, and here she turns that mellowness loose on a collection of Christmas songs. Traditional carols include \"We Three Kings\" and \"Oh Come All Ye Faithful.\" There's a sweet version of the \"Little Drummer Boy.\" Her duet with Peabo Bryson, \"As Long As There's Christmas,\" done for a \"Beauty and the Beast\" video is featured. And several poignant love songs with holiday themes (\"There's Still My Joy,\" \"25th of Last December,\" \"When There's Love\") are added to round out the soft mood. - C.W.\n\nMERRILL JENSON; \"Merry Christmas\" (Shadow Mountain).\n\nAnother of the talented local songwriters and arrangers, Merrill Jenson treats Christmas music as it should be: reverently, lovingly and joyfully. The music is performed by Sam Cardon, Ricklen Nobis, The Utah Chamber Artists and the Mark Small-Robert Torres Guitar Duo, so there is a blend of vocal and instrumental that is very appealing.\n\nIncluded are medleys and arrangements of traditional Christmas carols (\"I Saw Three Ships,\" \"Angels We Have Heard On High,\" \"O Holy Night,\") and some magical new compositions (including a three-part \"A Child's Christmas Fantasy\" and featuring dances of the Ice Princess and Snow King, the wonder of the winter moon and the delights of childhood). His \"Come Unto Christ\" is a soft and beautiful Christmas hymn that serves as a nice benediction. - C.W.\n\nYOLANDA KONDONASSIS; \"Dream Season: The Christmas Harp\" (Telarc).\n\nThe harp is well suited to Christmas music, especially at the hands of this concert harpist. With some percussion help, her soft and lyrical arrangements of traditional carols such as \"Greensleeves,\" \"Ave Maria,\" \"The First Noel,\" \"Do You Hear What I Hear\" and \"Still, Still, Still\" set a delicious Christmas mood. Also included are some folk carols, such as the \"Huron Indian Carol,\" \"Ukranian Bell Carol\" and \"Short Fantasy on a Neapolitan Carol\" as well as her own \"Dream Season,\" a soft and lyrical composition that captures the wonder of the time. - C.W.\n\nDONALD LAWRENCE & THE TRI-CITY SINGERS; \"Hello Christmas\" (Crystal Rose Inc.).\n\nVery soulful, almost reminiscent of Barry White, but not as full - that pretty much describes Donald Lawrence's \"Hello Christmas.\" The album, backed by the gutsy vocals of the Tri-City Singers, is full of rhythm and blues and gospel strains.\n\n\"I Can Hear the Angels,\" \"Little Drummer Boy,\" \"Sweet Little Jesus Boy\" and \"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\" are a few of the Christmas classics on this album. - S.I.\n\nLORIE LINE; \"Home for the Holidays\" (Department 56/Time Line Productions).\n\nPianist Lorie Line, who was just here for a Christmas concert last week, has already released three holiday-themed albums - \"Sharing the Season Volumes I, II and III.\" Her new seasonal outing, \"Home for the Holidays,\" is not really new. It's a compilation of what she calls the \"best music\" from those previously released disc.\n\n\"I Saw Three Ships,\" \"Gesu Bambino,\" \"Carol of the Bells\" and \"Ave Maria\" are a few of the classic Christmas music included in this hourlong list. - S.I.\n\nMELISSA MANCHESTER; \"Joy\" (Angel).\n\nWith smoky voice and soft, seductive mood, Melissa Manchester creates her first Christmas album, one that would be perfect for a rendezvouz in front of the fire. \"Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas,\" \"I've Got My Love To Keep Me Warm,\" \"Please Come Home For Christmas,\" \"When You Wish Upon A Star\" and \"White Christmas\" are among the offerings. She does her own \"There's Still My Joy,\" a bittersweet song with an ultimately hopeful message: \"one shining light can show the way.\" Her \"Christmas Angel\" is more upbeat and jazzy. And the tender lullaby, \"Cradle In Bethlehem\" adds a fitting endnote. - C.W.\n\nMANHEIM STEAMROLLER; \"Christmas Live\" (American Gramaphone).\n\nWhen you've already done three Christmas albums that have sold more than 10 million copies, it is natural to want to try something different. For Manheim Steamroller, that means a live-concert album, taped at Omaha's Orpheum Theater. At times, the audience noise seems distracting, and it's a bit hard to catch the vision of the medieval banquet, created through multi-media techniques for the second half of the concert. But the music is vintage Steamroller. The \"Christmas Lullaby\" is about as pretty is it gets; there's a very lyrical \"Pat-A-Pan,\" a rousing \"Los Peces en el Rio\" and traditional carols such as \"Joy To the World,\" \"God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen,\" \"Stille Nacht\" and \"Carol of the Birds.\" Oh yes, you also get to meet the other members of the band, aurally at least. - C.W.\n\nJOAO CARLOS MARTINS; \"Bach for Christmas\" (Concord).\n\nBach might not be the first name that comes to mind when you think of Christmas music, but he actually represents well the spiritual heritage of Northern Europe, says Brazilian pianist Joao Carlos Martins. \"Jesu Joy of Man's Desiring\" is probably the song here with the greatest seasonal ties, but all of these piano solos, including \"Aria from the Suite #3 in D major,\" \"Lord God, Open Up te Heavens,\" \"Prelude in B minor,\" \"I Call On Thee, Lord\" and \"Awake The Voice Commanda\" certainly fit the mood of the season.\n\nMartins has been a somewhat controversial artist, at times criticized for his style, but his technique is pure and riveting and his music filled with passion. - C.W.\n\nTHE MORMON TABERNACLE CHOIR WITH THE BONNEVILLE CLASSICS ORCHESTRA; \"Christmas with Charles Osgood\" (BWE Classics).\n\nThe annual Mormon Tabernacle Choir Christmas Concert is already the toughest ticket in town. But now that BWE is marketing the music as a CD classic, elbow room will be even tougher to come by.\n\nThis recording was made last Dec. 19 and 20 during Charles Osgood's appearance with the choir. John Rutter's \"Magnificat,\" the \"An American Christmas\" medley and the Christmas story from the Gospel of Luke are highlights here. This CD is the next best thing to being there. Given the physical crunch that comes with getting tickets, in fact, it may be better. - Jerry Johnston\n\nWILLIE NELSON WITH BOBBIE NELSON; \"Hill Country Christmas\" (Finer Arts Records).\n\nWillie Nelson's sandpaper voice is nothing if not distinctive, and here's a collection that's pure Willie. He gets some help from his sister, Bobbie, on the piano, but his voice and his guitar are the stars.\n\nIncluded are traditional Christmas songs, such as \"Away in the Manger,\" \"Joy to the World,\" \"Deck The Halls\" and \"White Christmas.\" Gene Autry is featured on \"Here Comes Santa Claus,\" and, of course, Willie's signature Christmas song \"Pretty Paper\" is here. There's also a new, original, Southwest-flavored \"El Nino\" in both vocal and instrumental versions that sums up Willie's message: \"Let us sing/Love is king.\" - C.W.\n\nJOHN PIZZARELLI; \"Let's Share Christmas\" (RCA).\n\n\"Let's Share Christmas,\" invites John Pizarelli, and if you like the suave, sophisticated, jazzy sound, you'll want to accept the invitation. Included here are mostly the secular songs (except for \"Silent Night\") such as \"Let It Snow,\" \"Snowfall,\" \"The Christmas Song\" and \"Christmas Time Is Here.\" There's an instrumental version of \"Sleigh Ride\" that takes you at a gallop, and he extends the season with \"What Are You Doing New Year's Eve?\" - C.W.\n\nELVIS PRESLEY; \"If Every Day Was Like Christmas\" (RCA).\n\nThe unmistakable virbrato of King Elvis Presley is a tradition at Christmas. However, RCA may be pushing the concept a bit. The label rereleased 1994's \"If Every Day Was Like Christmas\" with new a handful of alternate takes. \"It Won't Seem Like Christmas Without You,\" \"Holly Leaves and Christmas Trees,\" \"I'll Be Home for Christmas\" and \"Silver Bells.\"\n\nOther than that, the album is the same. - S.I.\n\nKENNY ROGERS AND DOLLY PARTON; \"Once Upon a Christmas\" (RCA).\n\nKenny Rogers and Dolly Parton have had a lot of success with their duets; their voices and styles complement each other nicely. The songs included here are from their TV special, \"A Christmas To Remember\" and feature an upbeat, love-filled look at the holidays.\n\nFrom \"I Believe In Santa Claus,\" which highlights the wonder of the season, to \"Once Upon A Christmas,\" a melodic retelling of the nativity story, they underscore the sweet and sentimental side of the season. - C.W.\n\nJON SCHMIDT; \"Christmas\" (Shadow Mountain).\n\nLocal recording artist Jon Schmidt had garnered a lot of fans with his soft, melodic piano interpretations. This album continues that tradition. He set out to \"personalize the carols and melodies that touch me the very most,\" and he achieves that goal in a pleasing fashion. Included are such traditional favorites as \"Bring A Torch, Jeanette, Isabella,\" \"Stars Were Gleaming,\" \"I Saw Three Ships\" and \"Lo, How A Rose Ere Blooming.\"\n\nSchmidt's own \"Christmas Morning\" captures the delight and magic of that time well. And his \"Christmas Hymn\" is a reverent tribute to the season. Vocals add a special touch to \"Gaelic Blessing,\" a benediction of peace. - C.W.\n\nJOE SCRUGGS; \"Merry Christmas\" (Lyrick).\n\nLyrick studios, the label that handles Barney, has released a kid-friendly (surprising?) album of Christmas songs. Joe Scruggs is the balladeer who leads listeners through kiddie faves such as \"Frosty the Snowman,\" \"Santa Claus Is Coming to Town,\" \"Jingle Bell Rock,\" \"Jingle Bells\" and much more. - S.I.\n\nROBERT SHAW CHAMBER SINGERS; \"A Robert Shaw Christmas\" (Telarc).\n\nIt would hardly seem like Christmas without music from Robert Shaw; his choirs have been adding to our holiday repertoire for years. This album from the Chamber Singers features traditional hymns and carols at their finest. The rich, full, beautiful sound of the choir is perfectly suited to such offerings as \"O Come Emmanuel,\" \"The First Noel,\" \"Rejoice and Sing,\" \"Ave Maria\" and \"While My Sheep.\" Also included is Benjamin Britten's complete \"Ceremony of Carols.\" It's meditative, comtemplative music that captures perfectly that aspect of the season. - C.W.\n\nSWV (SISTERS WITH VOICES); \"A Special Christmas\" (RCA).\n\nToo late, SWV, Mariah Carey beat you. SWV does its own glossy versions of traditional and favorite Christmas tunes.\n\n\"The Christmas Song,\" \"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas\" and \"White Christmas\" are a few \"new traditional songs\" while \"O Holy Night\" and \"Silent Night\" lean to the comfortable carols. And like Carey, SWV gives a lot of voice, smooth production and pop to the arrangements. - S.I.\n\nRAY STEVENS; \"Through a Different Window: Ray Stevens Christmas\"(MCA Nashville).\n\nIf traditional is what you want, this isn't it. But if you're looking for clever and biting wit, Ray Stevens serves it up in spades. Nothing is safe from his spoofy treatment, not Santa (who, after all, is overweight and only hires elves, thus discriminating in the workplace, and commits countless acts of unlawful entry), not the office party, nor the irritating drummer boy next door (who would be fool enough to give drums for Christmas?) or the idea of having everyone and their dog home for Christmas.\n\nHe laments the need for a politically correct season, pokes fun at the \"Xerox Christmas Letter\" and decides the best present to give is \"Guilt For Christmas.\" - C.W.\n\nVARIOUS ARTISTS; \"The Carols of Christmas II\" (Windham Hill).\n\nWindham Hill has gained a reputation for easy, soothing music. Jim Brickman, George Winston and Liz Story are a few of the artists who call the record label home.\n\nAnd staying true to the first \"Carols of Christmas,\" these artists as well as Toto's Steve Lukather and Janis Ian appear in rich arrangements of such favorites as \"December Morning,\" \"The Christmas Song,\" \"Once In Royal David's City,\" \"O Tannenbaum\" and \"Emmanuel,\" among many others. - S.I.\n\nVARIOUS ARTISTS; \"Celtic Christmas III\" (Windham Hill).\n\nWindham Hill's \"Celtic Christmas\" series has wonderful music. But sometimes the \"Christmas\" aspect has been missing. This time around the Christmas spirit is back. \"The Wexford Carol,\" by David Agnew and David Downes, \"Angels In the Snow\" by David Arkenstone and Lisa Lynne's \"Circle of Joy\" capture the Celtic Christmas aura as does Seamus Begley and Stephen Cooney's \"Coinnle An Linbh Iosa\" (\"Baby Jesus' Candles\") and Nightnoise's \"Lully Lullay.\" - S.I.\n\nVARIOUS ARTISTS; \"Country Cares for Kids\" (BNA).\n\nThe St. Jude Children's Research Hospital has long been a pet project of country artists, and this album continues that quest. A variety of top recording artists join together on the opening number, inviting us to \"Feel the strength we get from love.\"\n\nAnd love and children fill the selections that follow, including Clint Black's \"Christmas For Every Boy And Girl,\" Ray Vega's \"Take A Walk Through Bethlehem,\" Bob Carlisle's sweet \"Butterfly Kisses\" and Alabama's tender \"Angels Among Us.\" Sammy Kershaw gets help from his daughter on \"Christmas Time's A Comin',\" and Lorrie Morgan offers a lively verson of her father's \"Up On Santa Claus Mountain.\" - C.W.\n\nVARIOUS ARTISTS; \"God With Us: A Celebration of Christmas Carols & Classics\" (Sparrow).\n\nContemporary Christian artists have teamed up to provide an uplifting, lively look at the holiday. Anointed starts things off with a rousing \"Joy To the World.\" Steven Curtis Chapman puts the words of \"O Come, O Come Emmanuel\" to an entirely different melody, and Avalon gives \"Angels We Have Heard On High\" pop/jazz overtones. Ray Boltz's own \"Still Her Little Child\" is very pretty, as is CeCe Winans' \"All Is Well Tonight.\" Other artists include Twila Paris, Steve Green, Michael W. Smith, Sandi Patty, Chris Willis, Cheri Keaggy, Out of the Grey, Clay Crosse and Larnelle Harris. - C.W.\n\nVARIOUS ARTISTS; \"Hot Rod Holiday\" (The Right Stuff).\n\nThis one is for those who can imagine the Jolly One in a souped-up red sleigh, and \"when Santa hits the gas, just watch her peel,\" as the Beach Boys sing in \"Little St. Nick.\" The collection includes three tracks by Brian Wilson, Mike Love and the boys (the others are \"Merry Christmas Baby\" and \"Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town\") plus seasonal selections from other late '50s/early '60s/pre-British Invasion pop favorites such as Chuck Berry (\"Run Rudolph Run\") and Bobby Vee (\"Blue Christmas\").\n\nThe only true hit in the bunch is Bobby Helms' top 10 \"Jingle Bell Rock.\" A few of the tracks are recent recordings by evergreen talents, including Fats Domino (\"Rudolph, the Red-Nosed Reindeer\") and Dion (on Brenda Lee's \"Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree\"). Two are instrumentals by The Ventures, one of them being \"Frosty the Snowman.\" It follows the pattern of \"Tequila,\" and you almost expect the guys to shout \"Eggnog!\" But they don't. - Ray Boren\n\nVARIOUS ARTISTS; \"Merry Axemas - a Guitar Christmas\" (Epic).\n\nThe blues and Christmas go hand in hand. While the emotional blues do pop up during the holidays, the musical blues is close behind. \"Merry Axemas\" takes some of the more popular rock guitarists and has them playing arrangements of carols from \"The First Noel\" (which is listed as \"The First Nowell\") by Eric Johnson to the big band rock-a-billy sound of the Brian Setzer Orchestra taking on \"Jingle Bells.\" - S.I.\n\nVARIOUS ARTISTS; \"Slow Jams Christmas Vol. 2\" (The Right Stuff).\n\nMore soul Christmas with the Right Stuff's \"Slow Jams\" collection. \"Volume 2\" is smooth, sensual and not as puffy as SWV. Alexader O'Neal, The Whispers, Al Jarreau, O'Jays and Al Green are some of the artists who do songs such as \"My Christmas Gift,\" \"This Christmas,\" \"The Christmas Song,\" I Can Hardly Wait `Til Christmas\" and \"I'll Be Home for Christmas.\" - S.I.\n\nVARIOUS ARTISTS; \"The Soul Train Christmas Starfest Album\" (Epic).\n\nYet, more soulful Christmas tunes come alive with \"The Soul Train Christmas Starfest Album.\"\n\nNothing surprising as Boyz II Men & Brian McKnight do a new song called \"Let It Snow.\" No, not the traditional one. The vocals are harmonized to perfection and even sway.\n\nThere's Az Yet hip-hopping out \"O Come All Ye Faithful\" and Immature oomphing out \"Santa Claus Is Coming to Town.\" Other artists include the Isley Brothers, En Vogue, Stevie Wonder and James Brown. - S.I.\n\nVARIOUS ARTISTS; \"Sounds of the Season\" (Columbia).\n\nAnother benefit album, this one for the Children's Hearing Institute, \"Sounds of the Season\" offers a collection of previously recorded songs from a wide range of artists. Vince Gill (\"Do You Hear What I Hear?\") and Reba McEntire (\"I'll Be Home For Christmas\") represent country. Bruce Springsteen kicks in with a raucous \"Santa Claus Is Coming To Town.\" There's a folksy \"Teddi's Song\" from John Mellencamp and a jazzy \"Merry Christmas Baby\" from B.B. King. Willie Nelson chips in with \"Pretty Paper\" (not \"Blue Christmas\" as listed on the album's back). And Elton John's \"Ho, Ho, Ho . . . Who'd Be A Turkey For Christmas?\" is not your traditional carol.\n\nThere's certainly something for every taste. And it is for a good cause. - C.W.\n\nVARIOUS ARTISTS; \"Superstar Christmas\" (Epic).\n\nHow many times have you heard John Lennon and Yoko Ono's \"Happy Xmas (War Is Over)\" throughout the years? Well, you can hear it again on \"Superstar Christmas.\"\n\nYou can also hear Mariah Carey's \"O Holy Night,\" Cyndi Lauper's \"Early Christmas Morning\" and Boyz II Men's \"Silent Night.\" And if you want diversity, there's Frank Sinatra's \"Let It Snow, Let It Snow, Let It Snow,\" Placido Domingo's \"White Christmas\" and Collin Raye's \"What If Jesus Comes Back Like That,\" just to name a few. - S.I.\n\nVARIOUS ARTISTS; \"Ultra Lounge: Christmas Cocktails Part Two\" (Capitol).\n\nNostalgia is a big part of the season, and it doesn't get much more nostalgic than this collection of songs recorded in the '50s and '60s featuring artists such as Wayne Newton, Dean Martin, Lena Horne, Low Rawls, Peggy Lee and Guy Lombardo. The jazzy, sophisticated, big-bandish sound comes through on June Christy's \"The Merriest,\" Nancy Wilson's \"The Christmas Waltz,\" \"Frosty The Snowman,\" from the Ventures and Les Brown's \"I've Got My Love To Keep Me Warm.\" - C.W.\n\nVARIOUS ARTISTS; \"A Very Green Christmas\" (Seventh Wave).\n\nPianist Suzanne Ciani's record label, Seventh Wave, compiled a roster of artists and put together \"A Very Green Christmas,\" an album dedicated to the season and keeping the Earth new. Ciani performs \"Adeste Fideles\" and \"O Holy Night\" while Alex De Grassi's flute brings out a take of \"Bring a Torch, Jeanette Isabella\" and Michael Manring's mesmerizing bass offers \"A Great and Mighty Wonder.\" These among many others bring out the freshness of music for music's sake with a holiday touch. - S.I.\n\nVARIOUS ARTISTS; \"Warner Bros. Jazz Christmas Party\" (Warner Bros.).\n\nIn the mood for a little jazz? Here you'll find a collection of laid-back tunes from some of the country's greatest jazz artists. Included in the blend of vocal and instrumental are offerings from Bela Fleck, Al Jarreau, Joshua Redman, Larry Goldings and more. Michael Franks makes a statement with \"I Bought You A Plastic Star for Your Aluminum Tree.\" Mark Turner serves up \"Pure Imagination.\" But a few traditional Christmas songs are included as well (\"Santa Claus Is Coming to Town,\" \"Silent Night,\" \"White Christmas\"). The mood is definitely mellow. - C.W.\n\nVARIOUS ARTISTS; \"A Winter's Solstice VI\" (Windham Hill).\n\nThe Winter Solstice is a seasonal celebration, like Christmas and Channakah. And with the solstice comes a challenge to renew and regroup. On this disc, artists such as Jim Brickman, Liz Story and David Arkenstone bring the peaceful serenity of winter through \"Quiet Time,\" \"SNowfall\" and \"Snow Dance.\"\n\nGeorge Winston touches his piano keys with \"January Stars\" and Michael Hedges mystifies with his guitar on \"Usa Major.\" One of the most charming selections on this album, however, is the innocently sweet notes of Lisa Lynne's \"Northern Lights.\" - S.I.\n\nPETER WHITE; \"Songs of the Season\" (Columbia).\n\nSmooth jazz/Spanish guitarist Peter White, who just played a gig in Salt Lake City a few weeks ago, decided to do a Christmas album. While some of the tunes are pleasant staples, there are a few carols and hymns that take on new form. The jazzy \"Greensleeves (What Child Is This)\" and Joni Mitchell's \"River,\" with Kenny Lattimore singing are those charming few. White mingles lush orchestral introductions to some of the selections such as \"The First Noel\" and \"Joy to the World.\" But his better work can be heard in the in the stripped-down textures of \"Silent Night\" and \"O Little Town of Bethlehem.\" - S.I.\n\nCAROLYN WONDERLAND & THE IMPERIAL MONKEYS; \"Blue Lights\" (Justice Records).\n\nCarolyn Wonderland & the Imperial Monkeys haven't recorded an album of Christmas songs. They came together and recorded \"Bursting with Flavor.\" But they all decided to release \"Blue Lights,\" a gospelesque, bluesy lament. Too bad the gang didn't do more. This one song has a lot of charm. - S.I.\n\nDWIGHT YOAKAM; \"Come On Christmas\" (Reprise).\n\nDwight Yoakam has one of the more distinctive voices of country music, and he shows his style off well in this collection of traditional and original songs. Country blues (\"Come On Christmas,\" \"Santa Can't Stay\") and country rock (\"Run Rudolph Run,\" \"Santa Claus Is Back In Town\") are the watchwords here. Mixed in are Yoakamized versions of several traditional Christmas songs. - C.W."
