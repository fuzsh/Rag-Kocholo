        "text": "Music is beautiful. It’s not only a form of entertainment, but it’s a soundtrack that shapes our lives that helps us grow to our highest potential. There’s so much a person can learn just from listening to R&B music, whether it’s encouragement, love, or even forgiveness. There are plenty of songs that share an important lesson, but we decided only to share ten.\n\nCheck out the life lesson that comes with each song below.\n\nRaheem DeVaughn — “Until”\n\nLife Lesson: Ever heard the saying, “You will never understand a person until you walk a mile in their shoes?” Unfortunately, we sometimes place a label on someone without knowing their struggles. This record teaches you not to pre-judge or point the finger at someone without experiencing those trials and tribulations.\n\n“Until you’ve shared my tears / Known my fears, in all my years / Only till then, you only know what you think you know.”\n\nBrandy — “Human”\n\nLife Lesson:It’s not easy trying to be perfect in the eyes of society, but face it: you can’t. You are only human, and you make mistakes. However, you must learn from those mistakes and learn to forgive yourself in hopes that others will learn to forgive you as well.\n\n“I cry when you cry / I hurt when you hurt / I’ve made mistakes but I can’t turn back time / I’m only human / Forgive me.”\n\nLyfe Jennings — “S.E.X.”\n\nLife Lesson:Having multiple sexual partners has become the norm instead of having one relationship with someone you love. True intimacy should be shared with someone you love or at least someone you are committed to wholeheartedly. Do you want to experience romance with someone who cares about you or be another random on their lengthy list?\n\n“He says if you’d really loved him, you would give it up / Mama says that’s just a line guys use to get ya stuff / Which one will you trust?”\n\nTLC — “Waterfalls”\n\nLife Lesson: Life’s new microwave approach about wanting everything right then and now could cause you to suffer life-altering consequences. Appreciate the moment you are in, and don’t be in such a rush to live.\n\n“Don’t go chasing waterfalls / Please stick to the rivers and lakes that you’re used to / I know that you’re gonna have it your way / Or nothing at all / But I think you’re moving too fast.”\n\nIndie Arie — “Get It Together”\n\nLife Lesson:Forgiveness is essential in this journey called life. Holding grudges is unhealthy because while you are still holding on to pain from years ago, the other person is living life with no worries or regret. Learn to forgive and release so that you may give your heart a chance to heal.\n\n“And now your chest burns and your back aches /From 15 years of holding the pain / And now you only have yourself to blame / If you continue to live this way.”\n\nMary J.Blige — “No More Drama”\n\nLife Lesson: Drama is everywhere — at home, work, even social media. But, despite all the negativity in your everyday life, the beautiful thing is you have a choice to be drama-free. It is not easy, but you can find a way to navigate through the chaos.\n\n“Only God knows where the story ends for me / But I know where the story begins / It’s up to us to choose/whether we win or loose / And I choose to win”\n\nMariah Carey — “Imperfect”\n\nLife Lesson: In the 21st century, building strong self-esteem is crucial. Television, the internet, and magazines often try to depict your outer appearance and make you question yourself, but it shouldn’t matter. Instead, be confident and comfortable with yourself inside and out because cosmetics and expensive clothes can still leave us imperfect.\n\n“I may not walk like a supermodel, or look as flawless as they do / I don’t know where you get off judging / Cause I’m imperfect just like you. “\n\nSound of Blackness — “Optimistic”\n\nLife Lesson: If trials and tribulations don’t break you — and you are still alive — you should keep pushing through life with a smile. Learn to be encouraged at all times, even before turmoil strikes. That’s where you’ll find the strength to face the troubled days ahead.\n\n“If things around you crumble / No you don’t have to stumble and fall / Keep pushing on and don’t you look back.”\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIQn8pab8Vc\n\nR.Kelly — “I Believe I Can Fly”\n\nLife Lesson:Accomplishing your hopes and dreams sometimes feels impossible, especially when people tell you, “you can’t.” Remind yourself: “I can.” Anything you set your minds to, as long as you are passionate and stay driven, it’s achievable.\n\n“See I was on the verge of breaking down / sometimes silence can seem so loud /there are miracles in life I must achieve / but first I know it starts inside of me.”\n\nWhitney Houston — “Greatest Love of All”\n\nLife Lesson: Sometimes we are searching for someone to love us when we haven’t learned to love ourselves first. Loving yourself opens up a window of opportunities to come into your life, including friends and relationships. Your inner love will attract it back your way.\n\n“The greatest love of all / Is easy to achieve / Learning to love yourself / It is the greatest love of all.”"
