        "text": "“Christmas on Death Row” broke the streak. Starting with Dr. Dre’s “The Chronic” in 1992, every album released by Death Row Records went at least platinum, but the gangster rap label’s holiday album wasn’t exactly a huge hit. The LP — featuring rap tracks with Snoop Dogg, O.F.T.B. and Tha Dogg Pound surrounded by seasonal favorites performed by the artists who sang the hooks on Death Row’s hip-hop releases — didn’t even go gold when it was released in 1996.\n\nWhile the LP wasn’t a success, it shouldn’t be reduced to a novelty. “Christmas on Death Row” has more going on than its title suggests — and the story of its creation reveals a lot about a pivotal chapter in the history of one of hip-hop’s most storied labels.\n\nBut first: How did this record even get made?\n\nRap songs about the holidays had come out before. Kurtis Blow’s “Christmas Rappin’” was the first hip-hop record on a major label when Mercury released it in 1979, and the Treacherous Three’s “Xmas Rap,” the Juice Crew’s “Cold Chillin’ Christmas” and Run-DMC’s touchstone “Christmas in Hollis” followed. The full album “A LaFace Family Christmas” arrived in 1993 with Outkast’s first single, “Player’s Ball.” “West Coast Bad Boyz: High fo Xmas,” a compilation from Master P’s label No Limit, came the following year. Death Row, with its mystique built on beefs and gang associations, was different, but a holiday release likely seemed a safe bet.\n\nDaz Dillinger, half of the duo Tha Dogg Pound (with Kurupt), claims credit for the idea. “I saw others were releasing Christmas albums and thought we should too,” he said in an interview."
