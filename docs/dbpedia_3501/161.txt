SWV, or Sisters With Voices formed in 1990 as a group of three school friends. The group consisted of members Cheryl 'Coko' Gamble-Clemons (born 1974), Tamara 'Taj' Johnson-George (1974) and Leanne 'Lelee' Lyons (1973). The girls of SWV, like nearly all R&B artists, got their first experience in church.

When Teddy Riley heard a demo tape SWV had created, he helped set the girls up. With his guidance, they released their debut album, It's About Time, in 1992. The album went triple platinum and had a string of top 10 hits. The first single 'Right Here' reached #16 on the R&B charts but was quickly one upped by the albums later singles. 'I'm So Into You' was SWV's first top 10 hit, reaching #2 on the R&B charts and #6 on the top 100. SWVs biggest hit from the album was it's third single, 'Weak.' SWV's 'Weak' was the girls only single to top the Hot 100. Continuing their success, the album's fourth single 'Right Here' reached #2 on the Hot 100.

In 1996, SWV released their second album, New Beginning, which peaked at #9 on the charts. It had the #1 R&B hit 'You're The One' which likely helped drive the album to platinum status.

SWV disbanded in 1998 after their third album, Release Some Tension, released in 1997, went gold. Coko released a solo album in 1999 while Taj went on to marry football player Eddie George. They recently had a son, named Eriq Michael George.

SWV had reunited and been on tour in 2007. However, due to Coko's spirituality, she refused to sing many of the group's hit songs. As a result, the group halted their reunion efforts after a show on June 30, 2007.
