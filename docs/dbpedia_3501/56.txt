About SWV

SWV (Sisters with Voices) was formed by three friends: Cheryl Gamble, Tamara Johnson and Leanne Lyons (the group's founder). SWV got its start after the three friends sent a five song demo to record labels in the United States. Soon after, they were signed to a record deal with RCA Records after producer Teddy Riley, a former member of Guy, heard the demo. With Riley's help, the group's 1992 debut album, It's About Time, went double platinum and produced several Top Ten hits. Initially the girls had named themselves TLC (Taj, Lelee & Coko), but were beaten to the name by r&b girl group TLC just 2 weeks earlier. SWV's first single, "Right Here", was released in the fall of 1992, reaching number 13 on the R&B charts. Their second single, "I'm So Into You," peaked at number 2 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks and reach the top 10 of the The Billboard Hot 100 peaking at number 6. The third single, "Weak", reached number 1 on both the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks and The Billboard Hot 100. "Right Here/Human Nature," the third single and a remix of their first single, "Right Here", featured samples of Michael Jackson's hit "Human Nature." "Right Here/Human Nature" peaked at number 1 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks and number 2 on the Billboard Hot 100. The album's final single, "Always On My Mind" would reach number 8 the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks. Following the success of their first album, SWV appeared on the soundtrack for the 1994 film Above the Rim. The single, "Anything", became a Top Ten R&B hit and reached number 18 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the spring of 1994. That same year, SWV released The Remixes, which went gold by the end of the year. In the summer of 1995, the trio lent vocal harmonies to Blackstreet's Top 40 R&B hit "Tonight's the Night." In 1995, SWV returned with New Beginning, which was preceded by the Allstar produced number one R&B hit "You're the One" in 1996. In 1996 - 1997, SWV released their third album, Release Some Tension followed by the release of A Special Christmas, the group's last studio album. Shortly after the release of A Special Christmas, SWV parted ways to pursue various solo projects.
