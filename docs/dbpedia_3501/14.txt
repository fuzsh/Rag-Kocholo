TCO and Gee­star Empire announce RnB Xmas Ball, their first ever Xmas RnB fest­iv­al on Sunday 17th Decem­ber at OVO Arena Wemb­ley, with a heavy­weight lineup of inter­na­tion­al RnB legend head­liners includ­ing Joe, Mon­ica and SWV, along­side 112, Next, Bobby V and J Hol­i­day.

There will also be two more dates on Fri­day 15th Decem­ber at Birm­ing­ham Academy and Sat­urday 16th Decem­ber at Manchester Vic­tor­ia Ware­house, with head­liners includ­ing Joe, 112, Next, Bobby V and J Hol­i­day.

Inter­na­tion­al RnB super­stars Joe, Mon­ica and SWV will all be per­form­ing in Lon­don with full bands and the show will see Monica’s long-awaited return to grace the Brit­ish stage for the first time in 30 years. With old skool ‘90s RnB peak­ing in influ­ence and pop­ular­ity across gen­er­a­tions, the RnB Xmas Ball prom­ises to be a sell-out show when tick­ets go on pre-sale 27th Septem­ber and gen­er­al sale on 29th Septem­ber, bring­ing the heat to legions of Lon­don fans this Christmas. Multi-plat­in­um selling artist Joe will be per­form­ing his most loved hits for his fans includ­ing ‘Stut­ter’, ‘All The Things (Your Man Won’t Do)’ and ‘Don’t Wanna Be A Play­er’. Award-win­ning and multi-mil­lion-selling sing­er, rap­per and act­ress Mon­ica has become an inter­na­tion­ally adored fig­ure and will bring her char­ac­ter­ist­ic­ally husky, soul­ful vocals with her hits ‘Before You Walk Out of My Life’, ‘Don’t Take It Per­son­al (Just One of Dem Days)’, ‘Like This and Like That’, ‘The Boy Is Mine’ (with Brandy), ‘The First Night’, ‘Angel of Mine’, ‘So Gone’, and “Everything to Me’. Mean­while, icon­ic 90s vocal trio SWV (aka Sis­ters With Voices), con­sist­ing of Cheryl ‘Coko’ Gamble, Tamara ‘Taj’ John­son, and Leanne ‘Lelee’ Lyons, have sold over 25million records glob­ally, mak­ing them one of the most suc­cess­ful R&B groups of the 1990s. So it will be a rare treat for Lon­don fans to see SWV per­form their time­less string of hits, includ­ing ‘Weak’, ‘Right Here (Human Nature Remix)’, ‘I’m So Into You’, and ‘You’re The One’.

“Lon­don always shows me the most love and I can’t wait to get on stage to per­form live and con­nect with my UK fans again, the vibe is so cool and y’all show me so much love!” Joe

“It will be amaz­ing to return for the first time in 30 years for the RnB Xmas Ball, it feels so right to spend Christ­mas with you Lon­don, I’m not gonna leave it so long next time!” Mon­ica
