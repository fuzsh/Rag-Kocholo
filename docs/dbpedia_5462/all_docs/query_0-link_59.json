        "text": "It seems as though the new year will be ringing in the \"Rawr-ing Twenties\" with the latest announcements of band reunions, revivals and now the icing on the cake is the phoenix that is Drive Thru Records whom recently made an Instagram account, followed by the announcement of their roster headed to a compilation vinyl.\n\nThe compilation record, originally released on November 20, 2001, at the height of the label's popularity, famously came in a miniature pizza box, and featured a jaw-dropping collection of mostly previously-unreleased songs and rarities by the beloved label's star-studded roster of bands, most of whom are now highly considered to be cornerstones of the pop-punk and emo sound of the early to mid-2000s with contributions from bands like: New Found Glory, The Starting Line,, Finch, and Fenix TX, just to name a few.\n\nStarted by siblings Stefanie Reines and Richard Reines, Drive-Thru Records' impressive 12-year run helped the label go on to sell over 8 million CDs worldwide, in turn, serving as a launchpad for the aforementioned bands and many others, such as Hellogoodbye, Dashboard Confessional, Steel Train, The Early November, Senses Fail and Halifax.\n\nThey shared this statement on the vinyl pressing and Drive-Thru Records:\n\n\"As we were putting together the compilation, we wanted to do something different and fun. The mob theme made sense to us for various reasons, the most obvious being that our label and bands were very tight-knit, and we were known as the “Drive-Thru Family”. Add in the fact that we grew up in New Jersey with at least one amazing Italian joint in every strip mall, plus our love of mob movies like “Goodfellas”, “The Sopranos” and “The Godfather”, and 'Welcome To The Family' was born!\n\nEverything back then was done on a shoestring budget, so in lieu of hiring a model to pose for the cover, we had our accountant at the time assume the role as “The Godfather”. He was this crazy guy and seeing him with the bat posing as a mobster was funny to us. We always liked to amuse ourselves. So many inside jokes appeared on Drive-Thru Records releases over the years.\n\nFor the booklet, we took advantage of all of our bands playing at the Skate and Surf Festival in Asbury Park, NJ, and did part of the photoshoot on the boardwalk. Those shoots were fun because we got to mix band members for the different “mob” scenarios.\n\nI believe we ordered 10,000 copies of the cd. The plant wouldn’t assemble and pack it because they said it was too complicated and time-consuming, so we said we would do it ourselves. We had no idea what we were getting into. I remember our entire office including the two of us, and all of our interns spending days putting together those pizza boxes! Our office was FILLED with CDs and pizza boxes, the conference room table piled high. We had to first put together the boxes, which came flat, insert the booklet into the cd, then put in the stickers and whatever else we had included.\"\n\nYou can pre-order Drive-Thru Records \"Welcome to the Family\" compilation album as well as check out the track listing below!\n\nTrack List\n\n\"Somewhere Down in Fullerton\" (performed by Allister)\n\n\"Stuck\" (performed by Allister)\n\n\"3,720 To 1\" (performed by The Benjamins)\n\n\"O'Bleek\" (performed by Fenix*TX)\n\n\"What It Is to Burn\" (performed by Finch)\n\n\"Letters to You\" (performed by Finch)\n\n\"Give It Up\" (performed by Home Grown)\n\n\"Not Alone\" (performed by Home Grown)\n\n\"Get It Together\" (performed by Midtown)\n\n\"Hand Grenade\" (performed by The Movielife)\n\n\"Come Back Bon Jovi\" (performed by New Found Glory)\n\n\"So Many Ways\" (performed by New Found Glory)\n\n\"Mastering The List\" (performed by Rx Bandits)\n\n\"Analog Boy\" (performed by Rx Bandits)\n\n\"Konstantine\" (performed by Something Corporate)\n\n\"If U C Jordan\" (performed by Something Corporate)\n\n\"Break Up Day\" (performed by The Starting Line)\n\n\"Leaving\" (performed by The Starting Line)\n\nChoose:\n\nYellow & Black Splatter\n\nPlain Black\n\nDouble-Sided Pizza\n\nPre-Order Today at: https://www.shopdtr.com/\n\nYou can check out more info on DRIVE-THRU RECORDS in the links below:\n\nOFFICIAL\n\nINSTAGRAM\n\n(SUBSCRIBE TO THE POP PUNK DAD SPOTIFY PLAYLIST)\n\nCHECK OUT the bands I've featured here:\n\nTHE POP PUNK DAD SPOTIFY PLAYLIST.\n\nThe Pop-Punk Dad features bands from all around the globe.Email me awesome bands at: ThePopPunkDad@gmail.com"
