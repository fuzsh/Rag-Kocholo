        "text": "Chapter one begins at the ripe young age of 13, when a kid from the suburbs became enamored with underground hip hop and the culture surrounding it. With months of savings from my paper route job, I had my mind and my heart set on a pair of turntables. Drawing inspiration originally from my dad's old record collection, I eventually started digging through crates at yard sales and local record shops to build my own collection. I quickly learned to appreciate many genres of music.\n\nWhat began as a bedroom hobby turned into parties, competitions, and then my first paying gig at a local middle school dance. That school dance turned in to many more and eventually, I got booked for my first wedding gig at age 15. Seeing the earning potential there allowed me to focus my efforts on building my first small business in the wedding industry.\n\nSomewhere along the way, I started sampling passages from some of my favorite records, chopping them up, and turning them in to new compositions. Recording my own album as a 13/14 year old gave me the opportunity to teach myself basic recording software, which laid the foundation for my passion for recording music.\n\nChapter two starts near the end of high school and continues through the first decade of the new millennium. My world consisted of long hair, neon, and pop punk. Indie labels like Drive Thru were responsible for the soundtrack to my late teenage years, and the dreams of producing a Drive Thru Records band or signing bands to my own label kept me up at night. (Little did I know at that time that both of those dreams would one day come true!) Graduating high school early, selling off the DJ business I had started, and receiving a scholarship to (then subsequently dropping out of) Brigham Young University's Marriott School of Management allowed me the opportunity to pursue my passion for recording music. I bought a house and set up my first small studio, where I spent the next several years making really loud punk rock records. Along the way, I was developing my craft and my sound, learning from as many different producers and engineers as possible. Looking back, I probably made a lot of really bad records, but I pushed myself with every project, working to develop my ear and create new sounds and a style unique to me.\n\nDuring this time, I started an indie record label to produce + release records for bands I believed in. I also recognized the value of merchandise as a tool for artists, for additional revenue as well as building their brand, so I started a small screen-printing company to make t-shirts for my artists to sell at shows and online. I had no clue what I was doing (and still don't), but I did my best to figure it out along the way. I worked really hard on a lot of music that the world will never hear; on bands I thought had a shot but never made it; on projects that were on the verge of greatness but never quite had their time. I spent countless hours on projects invested in but fell apart; deals that went sour; friends and money lost in a gamble against the music industry. But as frustrating as it all was (and continues to be!), I learned so much along the way and continued to develop a foundation for things to come. Even if I had the chance, I wouldn't change my path, and I'd never trade those years at my first studio in Monroe, Washington for anything.\n\nThe next couple years were spent diving head first into the Nashville music community, working around the clock to build relationships in town and continue to develop my craft as a producer/engineer and songwriter. It was incredible being pushed and challenged by my peers here, who are so much more talented than I am. I heard one of my favorite quotes at an industry panel, where Mike Dungan, Chairman/CEO of Universal Music Group Nashville spoke. \"Moving to Nashville is like playing basketball with your older brother and his friends - you either quit, or you get really good, really fast.\"\n\nBeing a tiny, nameless fish in this ocean of insanely talented musicians, songwriters, producers, and artists was overwhelming for sure, but instead of dwelling on the negative, I channeled that as passion, and used it as fuel to drive me to work harder than ever before to keep learning, growing, and to get a little better every day. I've been so fortunate not to compete against these other individuals, but to instead learn from them and now call many of them some of my closest friends.\n\nThose first couple years in Nashville were challenging, but incredible. Being so far from family, working long hours on caffeinated energy and little sleep until I was physically ill, but I grew in ways I never thought possible. I was working with Grammy Award-winning, multi-platinum artists, and writing/producing the best music I had ever been a part of. Things seemed to be on a gradual incline with no signs of slowing down.. until one day, my beloved studio home fell victim, like many others on Music Row, to be sold to a developer, only to be torn down and turned into condos. In November of 2014, I called in my A-Team of Nashville studio musicians (and some of my best friends), to be a part of the last ever recording session at 1307 Division St. Shortly thereafter, all my gear was moved out and Soundshop Recording Studios, once home to recording sessions of Brooks & Dunn, Alabama, Kenny Rogers, Dolly Parton, Amy Grant, Paul McCartney, and many more, was nothing more than a pile of dust at the end of Music Row.\n\nJust as quickly as things grow, they can fall apart.\n\nLife has ups and downs. For everyone. The life we choose as entrepreneurs creates especially large distances between those ups and downs. The highs are high, and the lows are low.\n\nI first started the company by printing shirts for bands in a small corner of a warehouse. Later, we printed more shirts in a larger warehouse. Later, we scaled up the manufacturing side of the company even more by adding more great contract partners and with robust investment in equipment, people, and process in our own facilities.\n\nIn 2018, the difficult decision to downsize the operation by selling off the manufacturing side of the business was made. There were a number of factors that led to this decision, some of which were in our control, while others were not. I know the decision was right for the organization as a whole, to lean down and get back to the basics of the core business, but it was full of painful lessons and the process as a whole was excruciating - mentally, emotionally, physically.\n\nUltimately, failed. I could’ve prevented it. I could’ve worked harder. I could’ve been a better leader. I could’ve anticipated and solved problems before they became too big to fix. I wasn’t the best version of myself. I was learning and growing in many ways, but perhaps not sustainably so, and not in the most important ways. I could have been more focused in fewer areas. Instead, I was splitting investing in other projects, launching other ventures, and pursuing my own creative endeavors in the music business. I was spread way too thin, trying to be great at too many things and ultimately being remarkable at exactly zero of them.\n\nAt the same time, I was learning a very real truth about being human. My body was trying to tell me that it would no longer let me continue working the way I had through my 20’s. I learned that I in fact DO have a ceiling, and the way I was doing things wasn’t sustainable. The answer in my 20’s was always “yes” - that project, that opportunity, that problem - bring it on. I’ll figure it out. I’d just have to work harder. Stay up all night, get it done. Who needs sleep, exercise, lunch? Well, as it turns out, we all do.\n\nMy body had been giving me feedback, asking nicely for me to slow down. I hadn’t listened. It turned from a polite ask to an aggressive demand to get my attention. Hitting that ceiling was a wake up call. I learned about limits, formerly a foreign concept, and amidst turmoil and chaos I also had to figure out how to do things better, more efficiently. I needed more structure and more discipline. I needed more intention - more attention to the things that truly matter and more “no’s” to the things that don’t.\n\nAfter successfully selling the manufacturing piece of the business, the company had more bandwidth available to focus on the core business in a way that could scale more rapidly.\n\nDuring this period, I took a little time to marry my best friend on what was the happiest day of my life.\n\nAbout a month after that, my business partner passed away unexpectedly.\n\nThis was a tragic event that as young entrepreneurs in our 20’s and 30’s we had not prepared for in any way. This set in to motion a new sequence of events that I will not detail here. The short version is that the next couple years were incredibly challenging for a number of reasons. The business was ultimately sold. There were loose ends left untied that took time to unravel and then clean up. My life was full of uncertainty as I was considering how I wanted to reinvent myself. The global pandemic beginning in early 2020 disrupted the entire world and didn’t make the process of designing the next chapter of my life any easier.\n\nThis period of my life has been immensely challenging in ways I never expected. However, I know I have so much to be thankful for and try to choose to focus on those things every day.\n\nMy life has been full of trials and challenges and I can honestly say I'm grateful for every one. I can look back at all of them not wanting to change a thing. Each trial has proven to be an opportunity for learning that otherwise would not have been possible. While I'm always trying to improve myself a little every day, I can reflect on the times my life has been most comfortable and see that those are likely periods of less growth. My observation has been that there seems to be a negative correlation between growth and comfort. It has also been my experience that times of extreme discomfort have been times I have grown the most.\n\nI spent a little time working with an executive coach who quoted the work of William Bridges to help me understand that any transition has three phases. The first is an ending; the second can be referred to as a Liminal Space; and the third phase is a new beginning. That understanding was helpful for me to visualize. After doing some additional reading on the Liminal Space concept, I've decided that I will try to view this transitional period of my life as something to cherish and enjoy, a time to explore and learn, rather than an uncomfortable state of being that I want to pass as quickly as possible. Sometimes, that's easier said than done.\n\nI've spent a lot of time getting as involved as possible with my Nashville chapter of the Entrepreneurs' Organization and have enjoyed serving in various capacities, including my current role on the board. Our chapter also facilitates an accelerator program called Catalyst designed to help entrepreneurs take their businesses to the next level, and it's been super rewarding for me to be involved. My role has been facilitator, moderator, mentor, but I actually learn just as much from our participants as they might from me.\n\nI invested in myself by continuing my education, and after a pandemic pause, I became an alumnus of the Harvard Business School in 2022.\n\nI made a record with my wife in the hills of Hiltons, Virginia that her uncle built, and those songs are some of my proudest to be a part of as a music producer.\n\nI diversified my investment portfolio and committed myself to developing a sustainable strategy as a much more active investor, utilizing a greater allocation to options, futures, and other derivatives. Working through this during what became the bear market of 2022 was interesting timing. One could look at it as bad timing, a painful experiment and excuse to cut losses and give up; I decided to view it as a remarkable opportunity to learn quickly through trial by fire. I've been able to trade my way through market extremes, a perfect storm of a new war in Europe, the Fed's response to sky high inflation, and deflating valuations run up by speculative investors during the post-pandemic bull market. I learned really quickly the importance of capital allocation, position sizing, and managing portfolio delta and theta.\n\nI've tried to simplify my life and downsize which taught me some painful but important lessons about having more by having less - relevant to both things and relationships.\n\nI don't know how long this chapter will be. At times I feel like I'm floating too freely, exploring too many things and making meaningful progress on nothing that matters. There's some truth to that I'm sure, but I'm also not quite ready to jump to the third phase of this transition yet. I like to think I'm still moving forward, though it feels like I'm traveling a path with lots of zigs and zags rather than in a straight line. For now, I'm okay taking the scenic route. But I am getting eager to know what happens next."
