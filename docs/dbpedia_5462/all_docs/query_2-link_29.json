        "text": "Last night (13 March) she returned to the station to reveal the name of her new venture, Heavy On It Records. Alongside this announcement, news dropped that she was jumping on Ice Spice's track \"Princess Diana\", which follows on from Ice Spice's latest collaboration with PinkPantheress for \"Boy's a Liar (pt.2)\".\n\nFans were quick to notice that Heavy On It Records was involved with the remix of \"Princess Diana\", and now rumours are circulating that Ice Spice is signed to a partnership under the label. Within hours, the song reached number one on US iTunes.\n\nAfter dropping her hit “Red Ruby Da Sleeze\" – which was her first solo single since last year’s “Super Freaky Girl\" – Minaj linked with NBA Youngboy on “WTF” and the forthcoming Kim Petras single “Alone\" due next week. She also recently announced she will voice and executive produce the new 50 Cent backed animated series, Lady Danger."
