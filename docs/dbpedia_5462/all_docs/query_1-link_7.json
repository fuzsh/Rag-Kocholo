Those were the days.\n\nDTR was a great label despite how awful the owners could be\n\nWould anyone be interested in going in on pressing a custom “best of drive thru” vinyl with me???\n\nSIDE A:\n\nmidtown - get it together\n\nthe starting line - the best of me\n\nnew found glory - hit or miss\n\nthe movielife - hand grenade\n\nsenses fail - bloody romance\n\nhome grown - you're not alone\n\nSIDE B:\n\nallister - somewhere on fullerton\n\nthe early november - i want to hear you sad\n\nfenix tx - all my fault\n\nfinch - letters to you\n\nsomething corporate - konstantine\n\nHoly crap what a record\n\nWhat was the deal with Drive Thru & Geffen records, and why did it end up screwing the likes of TSL, Finch, NFG, etc?\n\nI remember TSL mentioned it in their Somebody's Gonnna Miss Us DVD.\n\nI always heard the strangest things about this label. A friend of mine met with the owners who I think were a husband and wife(?). They had them lie on their backs and gave them massages while they pitched why they should sign with them. lol\n\nThis is true and a thing that really happened to bands at the time"
