        "text": "During the early Noughties, Drive-Thru records were the kings of pop punk and emo. US pop-punkers The Starting Line were one of their bigger breakthroughs, with debut album Say It Like You Mean It (2003) becoming a smash thanks to the MTV-friendly single ‘The Best Of Me’ (surely one of the catchiest pop punk anthems from that era. They were, for a time, pretty huge in America, but that success never fully caught on here, despite ‘The Best Of Me’ dominating the music video channels in 2003.\n\nThey were unlucky to have arrived when post-blink 182 pop punk was at its most over-saturated, with similar sounding bands New Found Glory and Simple Plan proving victorious. With that said, Say It Like You Mean It remains one of a defining record of the Drive-Thru years. I actually saw them live during its touring cycle, when they came over to the UK in 2003 supporting Reel Big Fish – they rotated set times each night of the tour with fellow punk outfit Sugarcult. At this particular gig at the Astoria (RIP) in London they came on first and absolutely killed it, receiving a much wilder reception than Sugarcult who followed. Singer/bassist Kenny Vasoli’s clean vocals were just so perfect for teenage love letters and the young crowd connected so easily with the simple, melodic hooks and bouncy rhythms. I can still hear the near-deafening sing-a-along to closer ‘The Best Of Me’ now!\n\nThe band reformed a couple of years ago to play Say It Like You Mean it in full to celebrate the ten year anniversary and it was a real shame I missed out. Hopefully more shows will follow…\n\nRead more"
