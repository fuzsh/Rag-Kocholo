        "text": "On June 30, 2021, 5 Seconds of Summer frontman Luke Hemmings debuted his first solo track titled “Starting Line.” The song clocks in at around four and a half minutes and opens with the gentleness of piano keys followed by the singer’s soft vulnerable vocals.\n\nOnly a night before Hemmings dropped his newest masterpiece, I was mindlessly scrolling through Tiktok and stumbled across a video of a young girl’s reaction to the teaser he’d apparently released earlier in the week. I was unaware that Hemmings was set to drop any music separate from the band, but as soon as I heard the crescendo of keys and guitars backed by a steady quickening drumline – I felt a wave of stillness rush over me.\n\nI’m one of those people whose playlist is composed of songs that pertain to the situations they are currently enduring, and when I tell you Hemmings perfectly captured the emotions I’ve been desperately attempting to put words to these last few months, I mean it.\n\n“Starting Line” begins with Hemmings’ signature sultry vocals softly singing, “In and out of focus, moments that I keep / Something for the pain, and something so I sleep / Won’t you comfort me? Warm the air that I breathe / Visceral in doses, hiding in the seams / Standing on the sun and I don’t feel a thing / Won’t you comfort me? Take the fear I don’t need.”\n\nI won’t lie, as soon as the track began I felt the knots in my belly tighten and heat rise behind my eyes. It was something in the rawness of his tone, the way he opened a floodgate so quickly to the heaviness I’d also been feeling that sent me over the edge.\n\nIt’s incredibly rare to find a song that can instantaneously evoke such strong emotions from a listener that they feel as though they played a role in its creation. When the chorus hit, that’s when the tears came. I don’t mean to say that I was sobbing in my bedsheets at one in the morning because of how beautiful Luke had crafted this song, but I definitely let a handful of hot tears dampen my cheeks. The chorus plays, “I wake every morning with the years ticking by / I’m missing all these memories, maybe they were never mine / I feel the walls are closing, I’m running out of time / I think I missed the gun at the starting line.” If there were ever a line that could live rent-free in my head, it would be that string of words.\n\nI’ve always felt suffocated by the immense dread that I’m running out of time. Time for what, I’m not entirely sure. Maybe because I’m constantly chewing back the panic that the world is slowly, but surely starting to tick away from me with each decision. Or that no matter how many times I replay my favorite moments, it always seems as though I’m merely a visitor. That anxiety has kept me from finding the right words for far too long. Yet, Hemmings so effortlessly encapsulated that fear swimming around my body.\n\nThe only words to describe what “Starting Line” makes me feel is everything, all at once. I know, ‘How very specific of you, Nicole,’ but it’s true. I’ve fallen in love with countless harmonies and verses, but none of them have ever filled me in a capacity the way this one does. I feel as if it’s meant to be the soundtrack to my twenties, the song that’s intended to play just above a whisper as I go into my final year of college and step out into the real world.\n\n“Starting Line” simultaneously makes me want to collapse to the ground in a fit of tears, letting the apparitions of my choices scream as loud as they wish, all while spreading a warmth so toasty across my chest that I envision this is what falling in love with myself and the world again feels like. Perhaps it’s meant to do both.\n\nOn July 9, 2021, Hemmings and his team premiered the track’s accompanying music video on YouTube. It looks exactly how it feels. Throughout the video, Hemmings is visualized walking down a city street singing each verse, and as the chorus begins to pick up, so does his pace. Eventually, Hemmings is running towards the hope of what could be if he is released from all his silent suffering.\n\nAs the video reaches its peak during the bridge of the song, Hemmings sings, “Take me alive, make me a liar / take me alive, don’t look away until it’s gone / til it’s gone” directly into the camera, his entire being begging for a sense of safety. The video ends with a shot from above as Hemmings’ form runs through the street, the music fading with him.\n\nWithout a doubt, the twenty-five-year-old Aussie artist outdid himself with his solo debut. Buried beneath a culmination of emotions, “Starting Line” flawlessly places listeners in Hemmings’ shoes for four straight minutes. With raw intensity in its lyrics and beautiful silky instrumental, “Starting Line” mimics what it feels like to be nostalgic for something that has yet to happen.\n\nCheck out the video below!"
