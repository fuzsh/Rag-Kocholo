        "text": "Everything that happens in sports has some additional context when viewed from a sports betting perspective. From season-changing injuries to record-setting moments and so much more, the sports news cycle will constantly and significantly affect the sports betting industry.\n\nOur betting buzz file, with contributions from David Purdum, Doug Greenberg and others, aims to provide fans with a look at the sports betting stories that are driving the conversation.\n\nKey links: Sports betting home | NFL odds page | College football odds page | ESPN BET\n\nAug. 15: Paul Skenes sees Rookie of the Year odds move dramatically in a week\n\nDavid Purdum: Coming out of the All-Star break, the race for National League Rookie of the Year appeared over, with Pittsburgh Pirates ace Paul Skenes emerging as an overwhelming favorite. There was even talk of Skenes as a Cy Young contender in the N.L.\n\nThings have changed dramatically. Skenes' Rookie of the Year odds have moved from -4000 to -225 in a week at ESPN BET.\n\nSkenes had been as short as -5000 on July 24 but has lost back-to-back starts in August and now finds himself in a tight contest with San Diego Padres centerfield Jackson Merrill for the award. Merrill's odds to win NL Rookie of the Year have improved from +1400 to +160 over the last week at ESPN BET.\n\nOn Tuesday, a bettor holding 10 $100 bets on Skenes to win ROY, each at 50-1, elected to put his tickets up for sale on PropSwap, an online secondary market where pending wagers are bought and sold. In total, the 10 wagers would pay out $51,000. The tickets sold for $28,000 on Wednesday, the largest baseball transaction in PropSwap's history, according to co-founder Luke Pergande.\n\nSkenes, who did not make his MLB debut until May, is 6-2 on the season, with a 2.25 ERA and 115 strikeouts for the last-place Pirates. Merrill is batting .286 with 17 home runs and 64 RBIs for the Padres, who trail the first-place Los Angeles Dodgers by 3.5 games in the National League West.\n\nAug. 14: O'Malley opens as underdog to Dvalishvili at Noche UFC\n\nUFC Noche takes place on Sept. 14 at The Sphere in Las Vegas (ESPN+ PPV). It features two title fights, including the next bantamweight title defense for Sean O'Malley. Ian Parker looks at the lines and potential props for those two bouts to offer some early analysis.\n\nBantamweight title fight: Sean O'Malley vs. Merab Dvalishvili\n\nParker: This is one of the most anticipated title fights of 2024. It's as close to striker vs. grappler matchup as you will get in modern MMA. Dvalishvili's path to victory is to avoid the KO power of O'Malley and turn it into a five-round wrestling match in order to dethrone the champ. For O'Malley, he'll have to play sprawl and brawl until he touches Dvalishvili's chin. O'Malley is currently a +114 underdog (according to ESPN BET) and it's definitely hard to pass up on those odds if you believe he will be able to stop Dvalishvili's takedowns and win by TKO.\n\nOne prop to keep an eye on is the combination of O'Malley to win by KO/TKO and Dvalishvili to win by decision. Dvalishvili has been dropped in the first round of almost every fight he has been in and had to recover to get the win. When he has won, it's been mostly by decision. The question is, if he gets dropped by O'Malley, will he be able to recover?\n\nFlyweight title fight: Valentina Shevchenko vs. Alexa Grasso 3\n\nThe co-main event should be a very competitive fight that will likely come down to who makes the least mistakes. I thought Shevchenko won the last fight that ended in a split draw. She was also up on all of the scorecards in the first fight until she threw a spinning wheel kick that put her in position to lose the belt. It's hard to tell if anyone has improved since then as both fighters have not competed while waiting for the trilogy bout.\n\nGrasso is currently a slight favorite at -115 while Shevchenko sits at -105. I expect these lines to fluctuate between now and fight day. I would lean Shevchenko here as I still believe she is the better fighter, but if you don't want to choose a side, take the over on rounds as I believe no one gets finished in this one.\n\nAug. 12: Sportsbooks aligned with AP preseason poll\n\nDoug Greenberg: Over seven months after Michigan took down Washington in the College Football Playoff National Championship, the Associated Press released their first Top 25 poll of the preseason Monday. The initial rankings conform with how sportsbooks view the elite teams in the country.\n\nThe top six teams in Monday's preseason poll are also the consensus top six betting favorites to win the national championship at ESPN BET.\n\nGeorgia (+325) and Ohio State (+325) are the current co-betting favorites, followed by Oregon (+700), Texas (+850), Alabama (+1400) and Ole Miss (+1600).\n\nThe No. 7 spot in the AP poll, currently occupied by Notre Dame, is where the first discrepancy occurs. The Fighting Irish show +2500 odds to win it all in 2025, which places them tied for the eighth-shortest odds with Penn State.\n\nThe Fighting Irish have odds that are longer than LSU (+2000), who display one of the largest discrepancies between the two lists given their No. 13 ranking in the AP poll. The Miami Hurricanes also show a six-place discrepancy, ranking 13th on the odds board (+4000, tied with Tennessee) but 19th for AP.\n\nFinally, Iowa closes out the AP poll by taking the 25th spot, but if it were up to bookmakers, the Hawkeyes wouldn't have made the cut. Iowa (250-1, tied with five other teams) is the 30th-ranked team to win the national title.\n\nAs far as action goes, No. 2 Ohio State has been one of the most popular teams among bettors, racking up 20.5% of the tickets and 28.2% of the handle at BetMGM as of the first week of August. No. 1 Georgia has 11.8% of the bets, but an impressive 21.2% of the handle.\n\nAug. 6: Patriots face worst futures odds in Robert Kraft era\n\nDoug Greenberg: Gone are the days when the Bill Belichick-led New England Patriots were betting favorites to contend for the Super Bowl at the beginning of every season. With new head coach Jerod Mayo and franchise quarterback of the future Drake Maye as the main characters of a rebuild, the Pats are seeing their worst preseason future odds in over three decades.\n\nThe Patriots are listed at 250-1 to win the Super Bowl at ESPN BET and have a regular season win total of 4.5 (juiced to the over at -150), both the lowest since the pre-Robert Kraft era in 1991 when they were 500-1 with a win total of 4.\n\nDraftKings has individual game lines for all of New England's games this upcoming season and the Pats are not favored in a single one. Should that hold, it would mark the first time in franchise history that the team was not favored in any game.\n\nLine movement has not been working for the Patriots' either: From open until today New England has moved from +1800 to +2500 to win the AFC East, +7500 to 100-1 to win the AFC, and 150-1 to 250-1 to win the Super Bowl at ESPN BET.\n\nWhile the win total itself has not moved, the price on the over has moved in New England's favor, going from -145 at open to -170 in May and ultimately settling into its current position at -150. This is likely because of the 58.4% of bets and 73.5% of money is on the over, per ESPN BET.\n\nBetMGM denotes that the Pats are the third most-bet team by tickets in the league to go over their win total (though 58% of handle at the book is on the under) and 95% of money is on them to make the playoffs, though the action is limited, according to the book. On the flip side, New England is the most-bet team in the NFL to have the fewest wins this season at DraftKings (+320 favorite).\n\nThere is one potential transaction that may or may not factor into the Patriots' odds this season: According to multiple reports, 49ers wide receiver Brandon Aiyuk could be traded to New England, but at this point, odds haven't moved on the news and aren't likely to, even if the trade goes through. This is because, as one sportsbook representative put it, \"the Patriots will still be bad.\"\n\nAug 2: Texans-Bears preseason game attracts more bets than MLB\n\nPurdum: The first NFL preseason game attracted more betting interest than any of Thursday's regular season baseball games at multiple sportsbooks, but a lot of the action ultimately would be refunded after the Houston Texans-Chicago Bears contest was cut short due to severe weather.\n\nWith storms rolling into Canton, Ohio, the Hall of Fame Game was stopped with 3:31 left in the third quarter and the Bears leading 21-17. The Texans closed as 2.5-point favorites at ESPN BET, with the over/under total at 32.5.\n\nMost sportsbook rules state that football games must go 55 minutes for bets to be action, although there are some nuances. ESPN Bet and Fanatics, for example, voided wagers that had not been determined, such as the point spread and over/under totals. Successful prop bets like if a player scored a touchdown during the game were paid at Fanatics.\n\nTexans-Bears attracted more bets than any of Thursday's five MLB games at BetMGM sportsbooks. A spokesperson for Fanatics told ESPN that the NFL game attracted approximately 17 times more bets than the most popular MLB game (Baltimore Orioles-Cleveland Guardians).\n\n\"Despite limited participation from starters and weather leading to an early ending, Texans-Bears was one of the most popular events of the day on ESPN BET by both tickets and handle,\" Patrick Jay, senior vice president and head of ESPN BET, told ESPN. \"An abbreviated preseason game comparing favorably to MLB action and the Olympics signals the vast popularity of football, and how eager fans are for the return of NFL.\"\n\nJuly 31: Dodgers big movers, Phillies popular pick after deadline\n\nDoug Greenberg: The 2024 MLB trade deadline saw many of the perennial buyers continue to buy, in turn, triggering line moves and betting action across the sportsbook marketplace.\n\nIt starts with the World Series favorite Los Angeles Dodgers, who made late July's biggest splashes by acquiring Amed Rosario, Tommy Edman and Michael Kopech earlier in the week, followed by Jack Flaherty and Kevin Kiermaier on deadline day. While LA's already short championship odds stayed pat at +300, their odds to win the National League pennant improved very slightly from +150 to +145 on ESPN BET.\n\nThe Dodgers are now the World Series favorite at the trade deadline for the fourth time in the last five seasons, one of which was the shortened 2020 season that saw them win it all. However, the last time the favorite at the deadline won the championship during a full season was the Chicago Cubs in 2016, per ESPN Stats and Information.\n\nJust down the road from Los Angeles, the San Diego Padres were also busy, bolstering their pitching by grabbing Martin Perez, Tanner Scott and Jason Adam within the last week. The Pads are now +3000 to win the title across the board after being as long as +5000 one week ago. Plus, they've attracted the most bets to win the NL at ESPN BET (32%) and BetMGM (50%) since the beginning of this week.\n\nThe NL's standings leader, the Philadelphia Phillies, made only some cursory trades before and at the deadline, resulting in marginal line movement. However, that didn't stop bettors from getting excited about them: The Phils are the most-bet team to win the World Series by tickets (19.2%) since Sunday at ESPN BET, as well as the most-bet team by bets (21%) and handle (21%) since Friday at DraftKings.\n\nThe second-most-bet team at ESPN BET since Sunday and the most-bet at BetMGM since Monday is the New York Yankees, who got a boost from their trade for Jazz Chisholm Jr. over the weekend and Mark Leiter Jr. on deadline day. They moved from -125 to -150 to win the AL East, and from +600 to +500 to win the World Series at ESPN BET.\n\nAs a result, New York's division rival, the Baltimore Orioles, got longer in their odds, going from -105 to +120 for the AL East and from +650 to +700 for the World Series. Still, they're the most-bet team to win the pennant (29%) since Sunday at ESPN BET.\n\nLast but not least, the Cleveland Guardians, who currently sit atop the AL standings, tightened their odds gap to the top teams, moving from +1800 to +1600 to win the World Series. They were also a popular pick among bettors, attracting 18% of the recent tickets to win the AL at ESPN BET, as well as 10.5% of the recent tickets to win the World Series at BetMGM.\n\nJuly 17: Celtics, Knicks lead NBA opening win totals\n\nDoug Greenberg: Sportsbooks are expecting the Boston Celtics to pick up right where they left off after a 64-win regular season and an NBA record 18th championship. ESPN BET released its win totals for the 2024-25 NBA season Wednesday and has the C's leading the way with 58.5 wins. That would be their highest preseason win total in the past 30 years, surpassing their previous high of 56.5 in 2009-10, which they went under.\n\nNext up are the Oklahoma City Thunder (55.5 wins), who tied the Denver Nuggets (52.5 wins) for the most wins in the Western Conference last season with 57. The New York Knicks, one of the most active teams during the offseason, has the second-highest Eastern Conference win total at 53.5, eight games higher than their total of 45.5 heading into last season. It also ties their highest preseason win total in the past 30 years, matching the 1997-98 team (they went under that season).\n\nThe NBA Finals runner-up Dallas Mavericks debut with a 50.5 win total, tying them with the Milwaukee Bucks for seventh on the list. The Los Angeles Lakers win total is 44.5 and have gone under their win total projections in each of the past five seasons.\n\nThe team with the lowest win total heading into this season is the Brooklyn Nets, who are in the midst of a rebuild following the high-profile Mikal Bridges trade. Their total is 19.5 juiced to the over at -125.\n\n2024-25 NBA win totals\n\nAtlanta Hawks 35.5\n\nBrooklyn Nets 19.5\n\nBoston Celtics 58.5\n\nCharlotte Hornets 29.5\n\nCleveland Cavaliers 47.5\n\nDallas Mavericks 50.5\n\nDenver Nuggets 52.5\n\nDetroit Pistons 24.5\n\nGolden State Warriors 42.5\n\nHouston Rockets 42.5\n\nIndiana Pacers 46.5\n\nLA Clippers 40.5\n\nLos Angeles Lakers 44.5\n\nMemphis Grizzlies 47.5\n\nMiami Heat 44.5\n\nMilwaukee Bucks 50.5\n\nMinnesota Timberwolves 52.5\n\nNew Orleans Pelicans 45.5\n\nNew York Knicks 53.5\n\nOklahoma City Thunder 55.5\n\nOrlando Magic 47.5\n\nPhiladelphia 76ers 52.5\n\nPhoenix Suns 46.5\n\nPortland Trail Blazers 21.5\n\nSan Antonio Spurs 35.5\n\nSacramento Kings 46.5\n\nToronto Raptors 30.5\n\nWashington Wizards 22.5"
