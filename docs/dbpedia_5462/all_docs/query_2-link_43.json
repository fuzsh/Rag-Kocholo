        "text": "This is the question I get asked the most!\n\nAs a record label owner, releasing new music can be both exciting and daunting. With so many factors to consider, from the timing of the release to the marketing strategy, it's easy to feel overwhelmed.\n\nI want to provide you with 10 essential steps to help you plan your next release and set your artist up for success, and ensure that your new music gets the attention it deserves.\n\nStep #1\n\nFinish the Album\n\nIt may sound obvious, but it surprisingly isn’t…\n\nBefore starting any release plan, make sure the album is fully completed and ready for release, including mastering!\n\nThere’s no sense in planning too far in advance if you aren’t 100% sure that the music will be ready… there’s a lot in that process that can go wrong!\n\nStep #2\n\nMake a Schedule\n\nCreate a timeline for the release, starting with the release date and working backwards to include tasks such as promotions, press releases, and shipping deadlines.\n\nYour schedule exists between the masters in hand and release day!\n\nBe sure to plot out the singles and other activities!\n\nStep #3\n\nMake and Gather Assets\n\nGather all promotional materials, such as press photos, bios, and album art, and create a press kit to send to media outlets and curators.\n\nStore these items in a centralized cloud drive for everyone on your team (and the artist) to access.\n\nStep #4\n\nStart the Most Urgent Things First\n\nPrioritize tasks based on urgency, things like manufacturing (which often takes a long time) work on those first.\n\nUpload the album to your digital distributor in case anything needs to be adjusted or corrected.\n\nSame thing with artwork (if your artist is indecisive).\n\nStep #5\n\nMake a List of Objectives\n\nOutline what you’d like to see come out of this release? Break even? Just testing out a new artist?\n\nLearning the ropes and building the brand of your new record label?\n\nIs this just a passion project or do you have actual, tangible things you’d like to see happen with this release?\n\nStep #6\n\nMake a List of Goals\n\nSet specific, measurable goals for the release, such as achieving a certain number of streams or press mentions.\n\nIt’s important that you convert your intangible objectives into tangible goals that will help you declare whether this release was a success or not!\n\nBoth the artist and the label need to make their own set of goals. For example, the label may aim to sell 50% of inventory in the first 3 months, or project-profitability after a certain period of time. Whereas an artist may have more career related goals like wanting their music pressed to vinyl, or being covered by a press outlet they admire!\n\nStep #8\n\nStart Promoting!\n\nUse all available channels, such as social media and email lists, to promote the album to fans and followers.\n\nKeep in mind, every music fan likes to discover and enjoy music in their own way. For some it’s in record stores, for others it’s on playlists.\n\nMeet fans where they are!\n\nStep #9\n\nPlan a Post-Release!\n\nSave some of your promo assets to use in the weeks and months after release day.\n\nPlan for the day after, the weekend after, the week after, the month after!\n\nKeep in mind, release day shouldn’t be a finish line, it is the starting line of your post-release campaign!\n\nStep #10\n\nPlan a Post-Release!\n\nPlan ahead for the artist's next steps, in addition to having a 3-6 month post-release plan, you and the artist should know what’s coming next!\n\nKeep in mind, an album release takes 2-3 month, prior to that there’s 2 months of mixing and mastering, 2-3 months of recording, and 3-6 months of songwriting! That means it can take between 1.5 - 2 years to make an album!\n\nIf your train has arrived at its destination, another one should be on it’s way!"
