        "text": "New York is a concrete jungle where dreams are made according to some and that’s why, as an independent artist, you may be looking in the Big Apple for the right record label that can help you take your music career to the next level and help you break into the music industry.\n\nLook no further, here’s a list of 15 independent labels in New York City looking for talent where you can send your demo.\n\n1. A Diamond Heart Production\n\nFounded in 2014 by singer-songwriter and record producer Vanessa Silberman, A Diamond Heart Production is a jack-of-all-trades company that handles not only music recording but also music editing and artist development.\n\nSo if you are looking for guidance in areas such as mixing, mastering, or even tour planning, this could be the record label for you, as there’s someone to help you every step of the way, such as a graphic designer, photographer, and even a social media marketing expert. To top it all off, the company has recently launched four sub-labels that operate under its umbrella, namely Success Records, Poppy Records, Amethyst Trax, and Cocoon Songs.\n\nThe label’s main focus is on artists who specialize in musical genres such as indie rock, alternative rock, and pop rock, and its current roster includes talents such as Tea Eater, The Resonators, Jasno Swarez, Homemade, and many more.\n\nIf you think this label might be right for you, you can get in touch with them via Groover.\n\n2. Sungate Records\n\nSungate Records is located in the heart of New York City and like A Diamond Heart Production, Sungate Records takes artist development a step further by offering services such as digital marketing strategy, content creation, branding, and design.\n\nThe music genres they’re most interested in are hip-hop, trap, R&B, and Lo-Fi, so if you specialize in heavy metal, this might not be for you.\n\nYou can submit your music for consideration quickly and effortlessly through Groover.\n\n3. Ba Da Bing records\n\nFounded in 1996 by Ben Goldberg and based in Brooklyn, Ba Da Bing Records is an independent label specializing in alternative and experimental music. It is best known for its eclectic roster of artists, including Sharon Van Etten, Julia Holter, and Beirut.\n\nIt is also very keen on merchandising and puts a lot of effort into vinyl records and CDs.\n\nThey don’t say anything about being open for music submissions, but if you head over to their website, you can find an email as well as a postal address in Brooklyn (although some record labels no longer accept physical submissions for environmental reasons).\n\nFounder Ben Goldberg also launched Grapefruit Records in 2011 (but this one is based in Omaha, Nebraska) with Simon Joyner, known for reissuing classic albums as well as releasing new music from contemporary artists (you guessed it, on vinyl).\n\n4. Babygrande Records\n\nBabygrande Records is an independent label based in New York, founded in 2001 by Chuck Wilson, which focuses on releasing music from a variety of genres, including hip-hop, but also EDM (Electronic Dance Music), and indie, from both established and emerging artists. It represents artists such as Lil Scrappy and Chelly Flame.\n\nTo get in touch with them, send your submission via email at inquiries@babygrande.com (and make sure you put all the relevant information and send streaming links only!).\n\n5. Return Records\n\nReturn Records is an independent label based in New York that mainly releases music in genres such as house, pop, and hip-hop, so if you think you might be the next Dua Lipa, you might want to get in touch with them.\n\nSimilarly to the first two, they are very involved in the development of the artists they represent as a whole and will work with you on your branding as an artist as well as your marketing strategy, whether that’s on social media platforms or streaming platforms.\n\nTo get in touch with them, you can submit your music directly through Groover.\n\n6. Glassnote Records\n\nGlassnote Entertainment Group, commonly known as Glassnote Records, is an independent record label founded in 2007 by Daniel Glass and based in New York City.\n\nThe label has become known for its eclectic roster of artists, including Aurora, The Teskey Brothers, CHVRCHES, and Pheonix, as well as its ability to sign emerging talent and help them develop their careers in a variety of musical genres, including indie and hip-hop while supporting creativity and artistic vision.\n\nIf you need proof, the label signed and promoted indie folk band Mumford & Sons, whose debut album ‘Sigh No More’ enjoyed international success and critical acclaim.\n\nTo send your demo over, you can email demos@glassnotemusic.com (but do not put an mp3 as this will not be considered a valid A&R submission). You can also send them a press kit via postal mail to: Glassnote Records (Attn: Demo Submissions), 770 Lexington Ave (16th Floor), New York, NY 10065.\n\n7. French Kiss Records\n\nFounded by Syd Butler in 1999, Fenchkiss Records is an independent label based in New York. It has made a name for itself by releasing critically acclaimed albums such as Passion Pit‘s ‘Manners’ in 2009, and by helping to raise the profile of its artists, including Somebody’s Child.\n\nTo send your demo over, you can contact Syd Butler at syd@frenchkissrecords.com.\n\n8. Mexican Summer\n\nBased in Brooklyn, Mexican Summer is an independent label and multimedia platform founded by Keith Abrahamsson and Andrés Santo Domingo in 2008.\n\nIt is known for its eclectic roster, which encompasses a wide range of musical genres, including indie rock, experimental, psychedelic, electronic, and more.\n\nThe label is also known for everything it does outside of releasing music, such as special vinyl editions, art books, and collaborative projects, and even hosts events such as music festivals, showcases, and cultural exhibitions.\n\nThey prefer not to receive any physical demos so instead, send links to your songs over to demos@mexicansummer.com.\n\n9. Putumayo World music\n\nPutumayo World Music is a record label founded in 1993 by Dan Storper. He set it up after completing his studies of Latin America and a trip to the Putumayo River valley in Colombia. His overall aim was to introduce people to world music, and to do this he organized compilations of music from specific regions or countries.\n\nThe company has gained widespread recognition for its high-quality recordings and its role in promoting intercultural understanding through music.\n\nIn addition to its role as a music company, Putumayo also offers various cultural products, such as books and clothing, to celebrate and promote global diversity.\n\nIf you think you might be a good fit for Putumayo World Music, get in touch via Groover.\n\n10. Cult Records\n\nChances are you’ve heard of the Strokes or, if not, their lead singer, the infamous Julian Casablancas. But did you know that he set up a record label in 2009? He did and called it Cult Records, which focuses on releasing music from emerging alternative and indie rock artists. The label has quickly become known for the importance it places on the artistic integrity and creative freedom of its artists, and its roster includes the likes of The Voidz (Julian Casablancas’ side project), Har Mar Superstar, and Rey Pila, among others.\n\nYou can submit your music directly on their website and make sure you look up « demos/music » in the search bar to find the page directly.\n\n11. Fool’s Gold Records\n\nFool’s Gold Records is an independent label founded by DJ A-Trak and Nick Catchdubs in 2007. It is known for its diverse roster of artists spanning genres such as hip-hop, electronic, and indie. Fool’s Gold Records is also renowned for its innovative approach to music marketing and its commitment to supporting emerging talent. Fool’s Gold has earned a reputation for being a launching pad for some of today’s most inventive artists thanks to its ability to find promising talent and turn them into real stars.\n\nSend over your demo at info@foolsgoldrecs.com (bear in mind that mp3 attachments will be deleted).\n\n12. Coalmine records\n\nWe all love a good pun and we certainly love Coalmine Records, a Brooklyn-based independent hip-hop label founded in 2005 by Matt Diamond.\n\nIronically, the label focuses on releasing underground and independent hip-hop music, and throughout its existence, Coalmine Records has earned the respect of the hip-hop community for its consistent production of high-quality music and for its role in supporting independent artists.\n\nIf you think you’d fit the bill, you can submit your music to their Spotify playlist.\n\n13. I surrender records\n\nI Surrender Records is a New York-based independent label specializing in pop punk and alternative rock. The label was founded in 2003 by Rob Hitt and Chris Hansen and has served as a platform for emerging bands and released music from artists such as Four Year Strong, The Starting Line, Valencia, and Hit the Lights.\n\nThe label has a reputation for supporting artists with energetic, catchy sounds, so if that’s you, send in your two best songs to info@isurrenderrecords.com (again, no mp3!).\n\n14. Daptone Records\n\nSpecializing in soul, funk, and afrobeat music, Daptone Records was founded in 2001 by Gabriel Roth and Neal Sugarman, both musicians and producers. The label is based in New York and its artists often record at the Daptone House of Soul studio in Brooklyn. It is known for its retro sound and has released music from acts such as Sharon Jones & The Dap-Kings, Charles Bradley, and Antibalas. The label is known for its commitment to capturing the vintage sound and aesthetic of classic soul and funk recordings.\n\nYou can send your demo over at info@daptonerecords.com, but make sure that you put in the subject of the email that it is for the attention of the A&R department.\n\nUnder the Daptone Records umbrella are smaller labels such as WICK Records, which focuses on the rock scene, EVER-SOUL Records, which represents smaller soul artists, and Dunham Records, which specializes in analog recording techniques.\n\n15. Sacred Bones Records\n\nFounded by Caleb Braaten in 2007 and based in Brooklyn, Sacred Bones Records is known for its avant-garde music, with a particular focus on underground and experimental music, covering a wide range of genres including post-punk, noise rock, and electronica. The label is committed to releasing music that pushes boundaries and challenges convention, often featuring artists with unique and innovative sounds, such as Zola Jesus, John Carpenter, Pharmakon, and Moon Duo.\n\nSend over your demo at info@sacredbonesrecords.com and once again, make sure that you put in the subject of the email that it is for the attention of the A&R department.\n\nSo there you have it, fifteen labels that you can find in one of the world’s most creative places, New York City.\n\n—"
