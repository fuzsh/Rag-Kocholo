        "text": "Drive-Thru Records will return to Austin in March for the city's annual South By Southwest Music Conference. HELLOGOODBYE, HALIFAX, ALLISTER, SOCRATIC, HOUSE OF FOOLS, and DAVE MELILLO will perform Friday March 17th at Emo's Annex. This is the second year the independent label will host a showcase.\n\n2006 marks the 10-year anniversary of Drive-Thru Records. Started by brother and sister team, Stefanie Reines and Richard Reines, Drive-Thru began in their garage with a credit card and a Mac Classic. Now, the Drive-Thru label is recognized around the world and has blossomed into three labels: the original Drive-Thru, Rushmore and the newly minted singer-songwriter oriented, Love Minus Zero. This year's SXSW line-up is an outstanding representation of the company's diverse and spirited roster.\n\nThe night kicks-off with singer-songwriter DAVE MELILLO. MELILLO has been honing his craft since the tender of age of ten and at seventeen, has quite a few accomplishments under his belt. In between opening for bands like The Rocket Summer, Yellowcard, and Less Than Jake, MELILLO scored the music for the 2005 MTVu Woodie Awards. He also found time to record an EP Talk Is Cheap with producer James Paul Wisner (Dashboard Confessional, Further Seems Forever, New Found Glory). Set for release later this year, Talk Is Cheap will be offered as a digital download exclusively by MTVu.com for three months. MELILLO is no novice to SXSW. He performed at the ASCAP, Gibson and Drive-Thru showcases last year.\n\nDrive-Thru's most recent signing HOUSE OF FOOLS, from Greensboro, North Carolina, serve up an epic rock experience infused with rich guitars (three to be exact) and keyboards. Giant guitar solos are coupled with thoughtful and curious lyrics performed by charismatic lead singer Josh King. HOUSE OF FOOLS recorded their first album with producer Walt Vincent (The Format, Pete Yorn) and it is slated for release later this year. This band incorporates elements of Queen, The Eagles, and The Beatles, mixed with Elliot Smith and Radiohead, yet their approach is incredibly fresh and unique. Wowing crowds wherever they play, HOUSE OF FOOLS is gaining momentum and 2006 looks to be their year as they build themselves brick by brick into a rock n' roll powerhouse.\n\nSOCRATIC'S debut full-length, Lunch For The Sky is an ode to smart music with intelligent lyrics. The Jersey based band's music incorporates the best elements of pop and classic rock sensibilities. Each song dramatically unfolds through vivid lyrics and grand arrangements, while impassioned vocals and lush piano flourishes weave each song into mini-rock operas. SOCRATIC'S song \"Lunch For The Sky\" was selected for the first MySpace compilation.\n\nVeteran road warriors, ALLISTER delivers a high-energy, on-spot set that no fan of punk rock would want to miss. The band has spent most of last year and this touring, hitting the US, UK, and Japan. Their latest album, Before The Blackout incorporates sing-along melodies, break neck chord changes, and witty and sentimental lyrics, all elements that have cemented ALLISTER as a stand out act in the punk rock scene. Though tied to their musical roots, the ten-year old band isn't scared to grow up. Before The Blackout is praised in the press for taking that next step in song writing and musicianship.\n\nHALIFAX made their mark on SXSW 2005 and this year they return with a brand new album on the brink of release. The Inevitability Of A Strange World, produced by Machine (Armor for Sleep, Lamb Of God, Boys Night Out) and Lou Giordano (Taking Back Sunday, Sunny Day Real Estate) is the band's full-length debut and a follow-up to the 2004 EP A Writer's Reference. HALIFAX was featured on MTV's The Real World Austin during last year's SXSW. The band had no problem adding to the cast's merry mayhem swilling booze with the guys and romancing the ladies. This band from Thousand Oaks, CA has truly come into their own distinct sound and there is no doubt, Inevitability is a full throttle rock n' roll record. Take note, HALIFAX is bringing the ROCK.\n\nHELLOGOODBYE is one of the label's most popular bands and 2006 has boosted the band's visibility nationwide. Performing sold-out dates across the nation, HELLOGOODBYE capped off 2005 by winning MTV2's Dew Circuit Breakout. Now HELLOGOODBYE is finishing-up their full-length debut with Matt Mahaffey (Pink, Self) in between appearances on MTV's TRL, Discover & Download and upcoming episodes of Backstage Pass and Spring Break, and the band is booked on MTVu's Campus Invasion Tour, which kicks off in April. Known for creating a party wherever they play, HELLOGOODBYE will certainly get the SXSW crowd dancing and singing along to their sweet and quirky, sugar frosted pop.\n\nHELLOGOODBYE and HALIFAX were each featured in Alternative Press Magazine's \"Most Anticipated Releases of 2006\" while HOUSE OF FOOLS, DAVE MELILLO and SOCRATIC were featured in the magazine's \"100 Bands You Need To Know in 2006\" issue.\n\nDrive-Thru Records 2006 SXSW Showcase:\n\nFriday March 17th\n\nEmo's Annex\n\n600 Red River\n\nHELLOGOODBYE 1:00 AM\n\nHALIFAX 12:00 Midnight\n\nALLISTER 11:00 PM\n\nSOCRATIC 10:00 PM\n\nHOUSE OF FOOLS 9:00 PM\n\nDAVE MELILLO 8:00 PM\n\nDoors 7pm\n\n(times subject to change)\n\nwww.DRIVETHRURECORDS.com\n\nwww.HELLOGOODBYE.net\n\nwww.HALIFAXROCK.com\n\nwww.ALLISTERROCK.com\n\nwww.SOCRATICMUSIC.com\n\nwww.PUREVOLUME.com/HOUSEOFFOOLS\n\nwww.DAVEMROCK.com"
