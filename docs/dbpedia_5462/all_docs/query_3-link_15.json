        "text": "If you grew up listening to pop punk in the early to mid 2000s chances are you were in love with Drive-Thru Records’ roster. It was home to many of the scene’s favorite bands including New Found Glory, The Starting Line, Fenix TX, Finch, Midtown, Something Corporate, RX Bandits, The Movielife, Senses Fail and The Early November just to name a few. The label was also famous for releasing great compilations. This is one of them, the classic Drive-Thru Records Welcome To The Family.\n\nWhen the comp was first released on CD back in 2001 it was packaged inside a mini (CD sized) pizza box. With the CD itself featuring a pizza as the artwork printed on it. Fast forward to December 2019 and out of nowhere the label, along with Field Day Records, re-released the comp, marking the first time it was pressed on vinyl. Pretty much everything from the CD release is replicated on the vinyl version, save for the pizza media disc (which gets replaced by a pizza slipmat, minus the sausage) and the hand numbering on the back of the pizza box (not done with the CD version).\n\nDrive-Thru Records Welcome To The Family was limited to 600 total copies spread across four variants; 100/300 copies on split (half black/half yellow), 100 copies on solid black, 100/300 copies on splatter (orange w/ black splatter) and 100 copies on yellow. Only three of the variants were made available during the pre-order phase (split, splatter and black), and the yellow variant was of clusterfuck. Which I will get into later. Along with a debacle involving blatant false advertising regarding the pressing info.\n\nAlong with the option to buy the comp on its own, there were options that included the classic DTR logo t-shirt and hoodie, for an additional cost of course ($56 for the shirt and $76 for the hoodie, both before shipping). The stand alone record cost $36 before shipping, which was apparently a flat rate of $7 for media mail.\n\nAll copies are hand numbered on the back of the pizza box, with the /600 also being printed onto the back of the box as well. They all come shrink wrapped too, without any hype stickers. A full size, 10-page booklet is included, which is an enlarged version of the one that came with the original 2001 CD release.\n\nI will first go into the pressing info nonsense. When pre-orders first went up the split variant and the black variant were both listed as being limited to 100 copies each, with the splatter being listed as limited to 300 copies. Turns out, for whatever BS excuse the label wanted to give, the splatter was actually the one limited to 100 copies, with the split being the one limited to 300 copies. In the grand scheme of things is this a big deal? Yes and no. Many people, myself included, were angry not only about this mixup, but how it was handled as well.\n\nThe label said nothing. They simply changed the pressing info in the web store hoping nobody would notice. When the label was called out on a message board, their response was basically that they were bummed it happened and it’s not how they wanted the release to roll out. Not even an actual apology. Also, no reason was given for the switching of the numbers, say like a plant error or anything actually out of the labels’ hands.\n\nOne aspect lots of people overlooked with this situation was that it resulted in the splatter being oversold. So this mix-up went beyond just some people being upset they didn’t get one of the rarer variants and/or that they were lied to; some people did not get what they wanted to buy in the first place. The resolution for anyone who bought a splatter and it was sold out was to either swap it for a copy on the split variant, or simply get a refund.\n\nRegarding the yellow variant, it eventually went up for sale (actually turned out to be a defacto pre-order) in April 2020. And to make matters worse, the only way to get the yellow was in a t-shirt bundle. At least when this comp first went up back in December 2019 people had the option of buying a bundle or not in order to get the record. Adding more insult to injury, everyone who managed to snag a yellow copy, because at this point there were a vast amount of people after a copy of it, the records were delayed despite them assumingly being in hand. Only the t-shirt shipped. The shirt had a note hidden inside the shirt apparently saying there was a delay shipping the actual record; you know, what 99% of people who bought the product actually wanted. The yellow variant did not actually start shipping out to customers till pretty much one month after it was bought. It went up for sale April 20, and didn’t start shipping till around May 20. My guess is that the delay was a result of the pandemic, because at that point in time the pandemic was at its height. But the delay in releasing the yellow variant itself was because it was intended to be used for something else according to one of the labels. That something else is still a mystery that will likely never be revealed.\n\nJust to add more hilarity to this. One of the labels also was misinformed with when it would go up for sale too, telling people the day before it went up that it would be available one hour after it actually did (said 12pm when it was actually 11 am) So overall this release was poorly handled, with information not even being appropriately shared with those who had a hand in releasing it.\n\nAs of posting this Drive-Thru Records Welcome To The Family is OOP, and according to one of the labels there are no plans to re-press it. But with information regarding this release being so easily confused and miscommunicated, I doubt either label actually knows their ass from their elbow. Copies on the secondary market are going for ridiculous amounts. Retail price on this was $36 regardless of variant. Yes, so that cheesy album art t-shirt that was forced on everyone who wanted/bought a copy on yellow vinyl cost $29.\n\nThe lowest this record has sold for is $48, which is a copy of the splatter variant. But that figure is deceiving because it’s just for the record itself; it didn’t include the pizza box or slipmat. In actuality the cheapest this has sold for is $65, and oddly the color of the record was not revealed since the record itself was still sealed at the time of sale. Which is likely the reason for the low selling price. The yellow variant has sold for as high as $200."
