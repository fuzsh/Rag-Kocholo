        "text": "Often contrasted with performing songwriters, who record and perform their own compositions, staff writers are songwriters who specialize in creating hits for the commercial market. To do so, staff writers must be able to write to specification, work within distinct genres and markets, and produce demo recordings that demonstrate a song's potential.\n\nAs content creators their audience is twofold, including both the general music-loving public and industry players like recording artists, producers, A&R management teams, and music publishing companies—all parties that could help staff writers get songs recorded and released. Royalties from recorded songs constitute the bulk of a staff writer's income, and success in this field means having the artistry to write successful songs and the business-sense and connections to ensure they find a home with a good recording artist.\n\nWhen not busy writing, staff writers are usually engaged in a host of other activities: networking, meetings, making demos, and attending shows at night.\n\nWhile a staff writer can be any songwriter who creates songs for others, in the industry the term often refers specifically to a songwriter who has signed an exclusive songwriting agreement with a publisher. This means that the publisher pays the songwriter a monthly advance and provides numerous support services, such as pitching their songs, managing their rights, and setting up cowriting sessions with other writers. In exchange, publishers receive instant publication rights to every song a staff writer creates during the contracted period, as well as the delivery of an agreed-upon annual quota of songs.\n\nThe term \"staff writer\" is actually a misnomer, as staff writers receive neither salary nor benefits from the publisher, and as such are not actually staff. Instead, their payment is in the form of an advance—essentially, a zero-interest loan—on the future royalties earned by their songs.\n\nThis raises an important question: Why would anyone want to be a staff writer if the job doesn't mean getting a paycheck? For one thing, music publishers have years of industry knowledge and connections that help writers get songs recorded with major label artists. For another, staff writing arrangements are still amongst the most attainable ways to work full-time as a songwriter. The advance system ensures that staff writers have enough money to quit their day job and focus their energy entirely on creating new songs. In an industry full of artists working day jobs just to get by, the appeal of this cannot be overstated."
