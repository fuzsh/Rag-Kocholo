        "text": "Richard and I started this label out of the pure love\n\nfor music and wanting to help bands. Anyone can call bullshit, but everyone who truly knows us, knows that’s the fact. The bands always came first. We went through so many ups and downs with MCA/Geffen, Sanctuary, with the bands themselves, as well as fans / hat- ers and critics, that in the end we just felt battered. Labels wanted to do deals with us as the 3rd incarna- tion of Drive-Thru Records and I just remember being on a plane from NY to LA coming home from a bunch of meetings, and Richard saying to me, “The thought of waking up and doing DTR for one more day literally makes me sick.” I agreed. I was 24 and Richard was 27 when we founded the label and our one and only rule was: once this is no longer fun, that is the day we stop doing it. So we pulled the plug. Luckily, we had con- nected with a bunch of kids from San Diego called All- star (who for legal reasons later added Weekend). They wanted to sign to DTR and we explained we were put- ting it on hold, but would manage them. Five years lat- er, our relationship with them is still going strong. Our current management roster includes The Tragic Thrills who recorded a record in Nashville with Jason Lehning (Mat Kearney) and I am so excited about it. Personal lyrics, but constructed in a really cool and different way. Nothing But Thieves from the UK who have a Jeff Buck- ley-ish singer with vibey, indie rock music. Nick Tang- orra who is a great pop singer."
