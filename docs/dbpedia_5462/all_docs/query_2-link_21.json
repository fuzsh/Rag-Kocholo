        "text": "Some bands take a few years and a few albums to finally piece everything together and get it right. For pop punk/rock act The Starting Line, it has taken two full-length albums and a pair of EPs to finally find their direction. Combining elements of their previous releases while implementing new sounds that reflect the maturity of the band, Direction is The Starting Line’s finest work to date and the listeners agree. The album debuted at No. 30 on the Billboard 200, selling close to 20,000 copies in its first week.\n\nGuitarist Matt Watts recently took some time out of his hectic schedule this summer on the Warped Tour to talk with us about the band’s newest release, the excitement of being on a new label, as well as what the future holds for the band as well as himself and band mates.\n\nIt seems on Direction the band took bits and pieces of all your previous albums and mashed them together. Is that a fair assessment?\n\nWatts: I would say if Say It Like You Mean It and Based On A True Story got married and had a very good-looking, intelligent, talented baby, then it would be Direction. Musically, we tried to challenge ourselves while keeping the structures very straight forward, with the same good old TSL hooks.\n\nI also noticed that Direction seems to have more of an edge to it, especially with the vocals. Was this a natural progression for the band or something that just fell into place?\n\nWatts: Everything on Direction happened in a totally natural, organic way. We're not a band that really tries to force things.\n\nOn your previous album, Based On A True Story, there were some problems with your label at the time (Geffen) during the writing and recording process. How different were things this time around?\n\nWatts: We're lucky to be on a new label (Virgin) and it's like night and day from our previous label experience. The people at Virgin are TSL fans, they respect our vision and understand what we set to achieve with each record. It's a great relationship, and we value their opinion as well. They also come out to any show they can, which is something I can't say for our previous label who never actually made it out to a show."
