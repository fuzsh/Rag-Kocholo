        "text": "You Me And Everyone We Know formed in 2006[1] in Washington D.C.[2] The bands inception was tumultuous, Ben Liebsch (through the @youmeband twitter account) describes the details as follows: \"The band i joined decided they wanted to start over with me singing the songs i brought to the table. They didnt think their current singer had what it took. I insisted we give him a chance before taking this step so we recorded demos.. with him singing some of the band’s early songs. Were were in hilton head or something? One of them had a place or something i cant remember. Anyway, they made the call and it came time and they ended up forcing me to kick their singer out. Fun start.\"[3] Other band members dispute this and assert that the decision to move in a different direction with Ben as the singer was a collective decision and Ben was not “forced” to kick out the previous singer as that was done by other members of the band. Even after the original members stated their wish for Ben to front, he still tried finding other singers for the outfit.[1]Other members deny Ben ever tried to find other singers but acknowledge Ben was hesitant to take over the role as frontman.\n\nBy the end of 2006 the band had recorded and released their first 6-song EP, Party For The Grown And Sexy; independantly releasing on 5 December that year.[4][5]"
