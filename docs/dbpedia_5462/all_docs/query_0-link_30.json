        "text": "Few record labels have done more to encompass the DIY ethic of punk rock than Drive Thru Records. Brother and sister Richard and Stefanie Reines formed the label in 1996, based on a pure and simple business ethic – a love for new music. Working out of their kitchen, Richard and Stefanie have signed and worked with some of the most influential bands to grace the pop-punk and pop rock scenes.\n\nAs Drive Thru Records turns 15, fans are able to download all the label’s catalogue including earlier pressings from New Found Glory, The Starting Line, long out of print Rx Bandits and Finch’s early EPs, along with music from Drive-Thru family new-bloods such as Hellogoodbye, Steel Train and Houston Calls. This is in addition to the ‘best of’ and themed compilations.\n\nThe label has a long and varied roster; Dashboard Confessional’s Swiss Army Romance was released through Drive Thru, Midtown’s (Save The World, Lose The Girl) lead singer Gabe Saporta now fronts Cobra Starship, and Something Corporate’s Andrew McMahon, who released 2 critically acclaimed albums with the band, is now the frontman of Jack’s Mannequin.\n\nOther bands on the label, including Senses Fail, The Early November, Hidden In Plain View, The Movielife, I Am The Avalanche and The Starting Line have enjoyed enduring success, while Drive Thru has, at every stage, remained true to both themselves and the music. Drive Thru Records represents an entrepreneurial approach to business that is so rare within the music industry: a true success story, against all the odds. From the kitchen table to the office desk, and despite the label being on indefinite hiatus since 2008 (while Richard and Stefanie ventured into artist management) the family run business feel has not been lost.\n\n43 titles are now available to download from iTunes UK with even more coming next month."
