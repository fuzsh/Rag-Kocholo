        "text": "American record label\n\nRecord label\n\nDrive-Thru Records was a California-based independent record label owned by siblings Richard and Stefanie Reines. The label was partially responsible for popularizing the pop-punk/emo merger sound of the early to mid-2000s. After facing financial obstacles in getting their bands' music into stores, Drive-Thru entered into a distribution deal with MCA/Universal. In 2003 MCA was dissolved and folded into Geffen Records. One of the clauses of that agreement was MCA/Geffen being able to sign any band of their choosing from Drive-Thru's roster.\n\nOnce the Universal deal ended, they signed a contract with independent label Sanctuary Records. Starting with a new roster, the label garnered a top 10 platinum hit with \"Here In Your Arms\" by Hellogoodbye.[1] However, Sanctuary was on the verge of bankruptcy, and sold their assets to Universal Music. Drive-Thru Records got trapped in that deal, and were stuck with UMG, the catalog division of Universal. The label's last release was in 2008, when Richard and Stefanie Reines decided to concentrate on artist management and put Drive-Thru Records on indefinite hiatus.\n\nThe independent label sold over 7 million CDs. Bands that achieved notable success during their time with the label include Hellogoodbye, New Found Glory, Something Corporate, Dashboard Confessional, Fenix*TX, Finch, The Starting Line, Steel Train, Midtown, Rx Bandits, The Early November, Senses Fail, Home Grown, Halifax and Allister.\n\nLove Minus Zero Recordings\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Love Minus Zero Recordings\n\nLove Minus Zero Recordings was founded as the second subsidiary of Drive-Thru Records in January 2007.[2] This label was intended to comprise artists of a stronger singer-songwriter genre. Only two acts were ever signed to Love Minus Zero: Roark and Biirdie. This imprint was soon reabsorbed back into Drive-Thru Records.\n\nCommercial Success\n\n[edit]\n\nDrive-Thru Records have earned several silver, gold, and platinum albums and singles, that have been certified by RIAA, CRIA and BPI.\n\nCertified Release\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Artist Release Sales 2000 New Found Glory New Found Glory\n\nUK: Silver[3]\n\nUS: Gold[4]\n\n2002 New Found Glory Sticks and Stones\n\nUK Silver[3]\n\nUS: Platinum[4]\n\nCAN: Gold[5]\n\n2002 The Starting Line \"The Best Of Me\"\n\nUS: Gold[6]\n\n2004 New Found Glory Catalyst\n\nUS: Gold[4]\n\n2006 Hellogoodbye \"Here (In Your Arms)\"\n\nUS: Platinum[7]\n\nList of former bands\n\n[edit]\n\n* denotes inactive band. † denotes former Rushmore Records signee.\n\nRelease catalog\n\n[edit]\n\nThis is the release list of Drive-Thru Records in order of release number.\n\nCousin Oliver – (818) (1997)\n\nVarious Artists – Where's the Beef?
