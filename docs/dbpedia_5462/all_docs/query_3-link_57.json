So The Wind Won&#39;t Blow It All Away - Mark Davis\n\nOver the spring of 2004 and winter of 2005 a recording project known as A Drive Thru Record was created. A project conceptualized by Rob Malowany to bring songwriters from the music community in and around Edmonton, Alberta, Canada together to share in a unique experience. There were two records that were created for this project. The first recorded during May of 2004 and the second recorded during February of 2005. Details of actual dates and times reside in the tracking notes for each song on the bandcamp page.\r\n\r\nThe basic concept of the project was to book out a studio for a week, hire a great rhythm section, and give each artist 3 hours of studio time to record an original piece of music. During this 3 hour window each artist would teach their song to the rhythm section, track the tune, do any overdubs, and complete the song to the best of their ability. Thus the simple idea of a drive thruâ€¦. Artists coming in and out of one central place with the end result a compilation album at the end of a week.\r\n\r\nEach songwriter that came into the studio was thrust into a situation that often pushed their comfort as an artist. Possibly playing with musicians that they were unfamiliar with or being in a larger recording facility that some had not been before could be stressful. Thankfully the result of this process allowed for a very creative environment where artists were encouraged to collaborate and share ideas to support one another. Everyone showed up and gave it their best. The albums do speak for themselves.\r\n\r\nThis project could not have been completed without the tireless efforts of the production team during these weeks. Johnny Blerot as the man behind the board for both of these albums, engineering, mixing, and mastering. Greg Johnston on bass guitar and Greg Ferguson on drums, the superstar rhythm section primarily for all of the recordings. These were long days that seemed a bit like shock therapy as a full reset was required every 3 hours to start work with a new artist and new song. Rob Malowany running the show as producer coordinating the comings and goings of each artist, keeping everyone on schedule, and most importantly keeping everyone fed.\r\n\r\nEach album was released locally with a party held at the original Sidetrack Cafe in Edmonton. There were also various smaller show surrounding the release and during the creation of the recording as a whole.\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks to Dave Luxton for all the photos and filming of the project. Also, thanks to Chris Sturwold for mastering the second record.\r\n\r\nThis project would not have been possible without the financial support of key patrons of the Edmonton Community. We wish to acknowledge John MacDonald, Gord Collins, Ed Robinson, John Sinclair, Kevin Gibbuns, Kent Haryett, Graham Fersovich, Marshall Gourlay, and Al Jenson for their support. The Rock and Roll Lawyer Association.\r\n\r\nCurrently these albums have been made available as a retrospective look into a different time. A look at a community building project that helped support many artist at a stage of their music career. We thought it would be a good idea if we could try and give a little back. All proceeds from sales of this record will be donated directly to the Edmonton Food Bank to help others in the community,",
