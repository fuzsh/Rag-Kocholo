        "text": "Whether HubSpot is your first CRM or you’re moving from another system, importing helps you create records and activities, and update your database. Import files are spreadsheets of data used to organize your business’ relationships and processes.\n\nTo watch an overview on how to set up your files, check out the video below:\n\nBefore you start importing, review the relevant HubSpot terms and requirements for your import files.\n\nGlossary\n\nCRM Object: a type of a relationship or process that your business has, such as contacts, companies, deals, and tickets. When importing, an object is the type of dataset you're importing into HubSpot.\n\nRecord: an individual instance of an object (e.g., “Tom Smith” is a contact record). In a single object import file, each row of your file represents one object record. If you're importing multiple objects in one file, each row will represent records that are associated with each other.\n\nActivity: an engagement that can be associated with records, such as an email sent to a contact, or a note logged on a ticket record. Activities include calls, emails, meetings, notes, and tasks. You can create new activities and can update existing calls via import, but you cannot update existing emails, meetings, notes, or tasks. Calls and tasks can be imported on their own, but emails, meetings, and notes must be imported and associated with a CRM object.\n\nProperty: a field created to store information about your records and activities. In an import, properties will match up with your file’s column headers.\n\nExample file\n\nIn this example, the object being imported is contacts. Each row represents a contact record, and each column of information represents a contact property (First Name, Last Name, Email Address).\n\nUnique identifier: a property value that HubSpot uses to recognize each record as one of a kind. In an import, you need a unique identifier to avoid creating duplicate records (e.g., two records for “Tom Smith”) and to associate different records (e.g., import “Tom Smith” and associate him with his company “Smith Inc.”). The unique identifiers available for use when importing are:\n\nEmail: the email address of a contact. This is required when importing contacts to avoid duplicates or to associate contacts with another object. If you don’t have contact email addresses, use the Record ID to update and associate existing contact records.\n\nCompany domain name: the website domain of a company (e.g., example.com). This is required when importing companies to avoid duplicates or to associate companies with another object. If you don’t have company domain names, use the Record ID to update and associate existing company records.\n\nRecord ID: a unique property value given to each record by HubSpot. If you export existing records from HubSpot, each record will have a Record ID. This is a required column when importing and associating existing deals, tickets, or custom objects with another object, but can also be used as the unique identifier for contacts and companies if you don't have emails or company domain names. If Record ID is included in your import, it will supersede any other unique identifiers.\n\nCustom property that requires unique values (contacts, companies, deals, tickets, and custom objects only): if you've created a property that requires unique values, you can use the property as a unique identifier in your import files.\n\nAssociation label (Professional and Enterprise only): a value that specifies the relationship between records. Once you've created association labels, you can import them with your records.\n\nMap columns: a step in the import process, when you'll be prompted to match the column headers in your file to HubSpot properties.\n\nFor example, you want to import and associate contacts and companies in one file. The objects being imported and associated are contacts and companies. Each row represents a contact record and its associated company record. Each column header represents properties that will be mapped during import. The file shown below includes contact properties (First name, Last name, Email address, Phone number, Favorite food) and company properties(Name, Company domain name). There is also a unique identifier for each object that will link the two unique records in HubSpot (Email address for contacts and Company domain name for companies). During the import process, you'll map columns to HubSpot properties (First Name column to the First Name HubSpot property).\n\nExample file\n\nMapping columns to properties\n\nFile requirements and technical limits\n\nAll files being imported into HubSpot must:\n\nBe a .csv, .xlsx, or .xls file.\n\nHave only one sheet.\n\nInclude a header row in which each column header corresponds to a property in HubSpot. The column headers can be organized in any order without affecting the import. You can confirm if a default property already exists to match your header or create a custom property prior to importing. Learn more about property requirements.\n\nContain less than 1000 columns.\n\nBe UTF-8 encoded if foreign language characters are included.\n\nIf you're importing an Excel file:\n\nContain data that stays under Excel's worksheet and workbook maximum limits.\n\nContain cells in Number format when importing date-time properties.\n\nOnly contain currency data formatted for USD using decimals (e.g. 123.45).\n\nThere are additional technical limits for the import tool depending on your HubSpot subscription. These limits include the size and row limits of an import file, as well as how many files and rows you can import per day.\n\nIf you're using HubSpot's free tools, you can:\n\nImport files up to 20MB.\n\nComplete up to 50 imports per day.\n\nImport up to 500,000 rows per day. If you import a file containing more than 500,000 rows, it will take multiple days to complete.\n\nIf your account has a Starter, Professional, or Enterprise subscription, you can:\n\nImport files up to 512 MB.\n\nComplete up to 500 imports per day.\n\nImport up to 10,000,000 rows per day, with a limit of 1,048,576 rows per file. If you're importing via the imports API, you can import up to 80,000,000 rows per day.\n\nThese limits apply to a rolling 24-hour period and do not reset at a specific time of day. Learn more about your HubSpot subscription and its limitations.\n\nProperty requirements\n\nFormatting property values\n\nDepending on the property field type or the data your cells contain, there are other specific formatting requirements:\n\nAdditional emails or domains: if you're importing contacts with more than one email address, include an Additional email addresses column with their secondary emails. If you're importing companies with more than one domain name, include an Additional domains column with their secondary domains. To include multiple emails or domains in a cell, separate the values with semi-colons (e.g., email@email.com; emailtwo@email.com). If you're importing to create contacts or companies, you cannot set a new contact's Email or new company's Company domain name to an email or domain that's an existing additional email/domain for another record.\n\nBlank cells: the import tool ignores blank cells in a spreadsheet, so when importing new property data, leave cells blank for records without a value for the property. If an existing record already has a value for the property within HubSpot, blank cells will not clear the existing property value. To clear existing property values in bulk, you can manually edit the values or use the Clear property value workflow action.\n\nCheckbox properties:\n\nMultiple checkboxes property:\n\nTo import multiple values, add a semicolon between each value without spaces (value 1;value 2). These property options must be created prior to the import.\n\nTo add or append values, add a semicolon before the first value (;value 3;value 4). This will append the value instead of overwriting the existing property value.\n\nSingle checkbox property: create a column for the single checkbox field and set the value on each line to True or Yes, to display as Yes or checked in HubSpot or\n\nFalse or No, to display as No or not checked in HubSpot.\n\nCustom number, text, or date picker properties: if you've set validation rules, your imported values must follow the rules or they will not be imported.\n\nDate and date-time properties: for properties containing a date or date and time, to format a value for this property:\n\nMonths can be a number, three letters, or a full name (10, OCT, Oct, OCTOBER, October), years can be two digits or four (2023, 23), and separators can be a forward slash, hyphen, or period (10/28/2023, 10-28-2023, 10.28.2023).\n\nValid date formats are day month year (e.g., 28/10/2023), month day year (e.g., 10-28-23), or year month day (e.g., 2023.OCT.28).\n\nFor date and time properties, to include a time, the timestamp can be added as hh:mm (28/10/2020 14:30) in all file types or as a UNIX timestamp in milliseconds in CSV files or an Excel file with cells in the Text number format. If you don't include a timestamp, the time is set to midnight by default.\n\nDuration: for properties containing a duration, such as the Call duration property, your values must be formatted as a UNIX timestamp in milliseconds. Learn more about how to format timestamp values and how to convert a date into UNIX format.\n\nDeal collaborators: if you're adding collaborators to a deal via import, include a Deal collaborator header. For each cell, you must include two or more users, separated by semi-colons (e.g., user1@example.com;user2@example.com).\n\nEnumeration properties: the values in your import file must match either the label or the internal value of the property's defined options. For HubSpot default enumeration properties (e.g., Lifecycle stage, Industry), the values must match the internal value or the label in English. If importing multiple values for an enumeration property, add a semicolon between each value without spaces (;value 2;value 3;value 4).\n\nFile properties: to add existing files to a file property, include the File ID as your value. You can find a file's ID in the General section of a file's details.\n\nOwner properties: to assign an owner to a record or activity during the import:\n\nFor objects, include a [Object] owner header. For activities, include an Activity assigned to header.\n\nAdd the name or email address of the user to each row in that column. Users who are assigned a record through import will not receive a notification that they were assigned a new record or activity.\n\nPercentages: when importing a number property formatted as a percentage, you can format your values with a % percent sign or as a decimal. For example, to import 25%, your cell should contain either 25% or .25.\n\nPhone number: the contact properties Phone number and Mobile phone number, to import and automatically format the phone number based on country code, format as +[country code][number]. If there is an extension, add ext[number]. For example, a phone number with a United States country code would look like +11234567890 ext123.\n\nPrice: for properties containing a price, you must use one of HubSpot's accepted currencies. The list of accepted currencies and their currency codes can be found in the Currency tab of your account default settings.\n\nProduct properties:\n\nIf importing a Term property value, you can format the value in the Term column as a number in months (e.g., 10 for 10 months), as PXM where X is the number of months (e.g., P6M, for a term of 6 months) or PXY where X is the number of years (e.g., P1Y, for a term of 1 year).\n\nIf importing a Billing frequency property value, use monthly, annually, or quarterly if the product has a recurring price type. Leave the cell blank if the product has a one-time price.\n\nOwner properties: to assign an owner to a record or activity during the import:\n\nFor objects, include a [Object] owner header. For activities, include an Activity assigned to header.\n\nAdd the name or email address of the user to each row in that column. Users who are assigned a record through import will not receive a notification that they were assigned a new record or activity.\n\nRequired properties\n\nDepending on which objects or activities you're importing, the following properties are required, and must be included as columns headers in your files:\n\nContacts: at least one of First name, Last name, Email, or for existing contacts, Record ID.\n\nCompanies: at least one of Name, Company Domain Name, or for existing companies, Record ID.\n\nDeals: if you're creating new deals, Deal name, Pipeline, and Deal stage. For existing deals, Record ID.\n\nTickets: if you're creating new tickets, Ticket name, Pipeline, and Ticket status. For existing tickets, Record ID.\n\nProducts: Unit price and Name, or for existing products, Record ID.\n\nLine items: Name, Quantity, Price, and the associated deals' Record ID or Deal name. Include the product's Product ID if you're also associating the line item with a product, which will be mapped as a line item property during the import.\n\nPlease note: when importing line items with deals, the import will not update the deal amount. To update update the associated deal amount, you can manually edit the line items or associate the line items with a deal in HubSpot.\n\nCalls: Call notes. When importing new calls, it's also recommended to include Activity date.\n\nEmails: Email body and Email direction.\n\nMeetings: Meeting description, Meeting start time, and Meeting end time. When importing new meetings, it's also recommended to include Activity date. The start time, end time, and activity date values should be formatted as date-time properties.\n\nNotes: Note body.\n\nTasks: Task title and Due date. The due date should be formatted as a date-time property.\n\nPlease note: while not required, it's recommended to include Activity date when importing new activities to specify the date and time an activity occurred. If you don't include this property, the Activity date values are automatically set to the date and time of the import.\n\nOptional properties\n\nAdditional properties are not required, but can also be imported into HubSpot to add or update data in bulk. You can import the following additional properties:\n\nHubSpot default contact, company, deal, and ticket properties, excluding certain automatically set properties that cannot be edited. Learn more about default contact, company, deal, and ticket properties.\n\nAny custom properties you've created for contacts, companies, deals, tickets, or custom objects.\n\nHubSpot default call, email, meeting, note, and task properties. Learn more about default activity properties.\n\nAssociation and deduplication requirements\n\nThe following are required to successfully avoid duplicates and associate records when importing. If you're importing same object associations, refer to the section below for additional requirements.\n\nTo import and associate multiple objects in one file, include information about associated records and/or activities in the same row. In two files, use a common column to connect the records in each file. You can refer to the example files for more help importing and associating records.\n\nTo update existing records, associate records, and avoid duplicate records, your files must include a unique identifier property for each object. For all objects, you can export existing records and use the Record ID as a unique identifier, or use a custom property that requires unique values.For contacts, you can also use Email. For companies, you can also use Company domain name.\n\nIf you're importing multiple objects and are including Record IDs, it is recommended to differentiate the file column headers to match the ID with the correct object (e.g., one column called Record ID - Contacts and another called Record ID - Companies).\n\nIf you're using a custom unique value property to deduplicate contacts, the Email property will still require unique values.\n\nIf you're using a custom unique value property to deduplicate companies, the Company domain name property will not require unique values. This means you can import duplicate company domains. If you don’t want multiple companies with same domain, you should remove duplicate domains from your file before importing, or use Company domain name as your unique identifier instead.\n\nYou can use a secondary email as the unique identifier for existing contacts who have a secondary email address listed in HubSpot. If you use a secondary email, and do not include the Record ID column in your file, the secondary email will not replace the primary email. However, if you include both the secondary email and Record ID as columns in your file, the secondary email will replace the primary email.\n\nTo associate one record with multiple activities or records of another object, include the record's unique identifier in multiple rows for each record you want to associate. For example, Luke Danes is a manager at Luke's Diner, but a contractor at The Dragonfly Inn. To associate him with both companies, you'd need to include two rows for Luke Danes with the columns Email (or Record ID), and Company domain name (or Record ID) for each company.\n\nPlease note: if you don't include unique identifiers (e.g., Email, Company domain name, Record ID), the import will create duplicate records instead of associating each to the same record.\n\nTo import association labels (Professional and Enterprise only), include an Association label column. You must create the association labels in HubSpot prior to importing.\n\nTo set a company association as primary, include the value Primary in the Association label column for that row.\n\nTo set multiple labels to describe the relationship between two records, you can include multiple association label values in one cell, separated by a semicolon (e.g., Manager; Billing contact).\n\nIf you're importing association labels in a multiple file import, you need to include the Association label column and a unique identifier for the object you're associating in the same file.\n\nIf you're importing paired labels for cross-object associations, only include one of the labels in the Association label column. The labels will be assigned to the correct object during the import process.\n\nTo create child-parent company associations via import, include a Parent company column in your import file with the parent companies' Record ID values. Learn more about importing child companies.\n\nSame object association imports\n\nYou can import one file to associate records of the same object in bulk. When setting up your file, the following requirements are specific to same object imports:\n\nAt least one record in a record pair must already exist in HubSpot before importing. For example, you can import a new contact and associate it with an existing contact, but you cannot import to create and associate two new contacts.\n\nIf you're associating multiple records with one record, separate the records' unique identifier values by a semi-colon in the same cell (e.g., luke@lukesdiner.com; rory@yale.edu; sookie@dragonfly.com).\n\nIf you're labelling associations (Professional and Enterprise only):\n\nThe association labels must already exist in your association settings before importing.\n\nIf all records have the same label, you can add this label during the import process.\n\nIf the records have different labels, include a label column in your file, with the corresponding label for each association.\n\nIf you use paired labels (e.g., manager and employee), the record in theAssociated [unique identifier] column will receive the label added in the import process or included in the file's label column. The other record in the row will receive the other label in the pair.\n\nDuring the import process, you'll need to select a checkbox to include same object associations.\n\nIn the example file below, Rory and Jackson are new contacts being associated with unique labels to existing contacts, using their Email values as the unique identifier. Sookie is an existing contact being associated to two existing contacts with the same label. In the first row, the association label is part of a label pair, which means once the import is completed, the associated record will have the label Parent and Rory will have the paired label, Child.\n\nSample import files\n\nThe following files include the required column headers for each object or activity, as well as possible additional headers. You can add your own column headers to update or create any additional properties that are important to maintain your organization’s HubSpot database.\n\nYou can also generate your own example file after selecting objects during the import process.\n\nOne object or activity\n\nContacts sample spreadsheet: XLSX or CSV\n\nCompanies sample spreadsheet: XLSX or CSV\n\nDeals sample spreadsheet: XLSX or CSV\n\nTickets sample spreadsheet: XLSX or CSV\n\nProducts sample spreadsheet: XLSX or CSV\n\nTasks sample spreadsheet: XLSX or CSV\n\nCalls sample spreadsheet: XLSX or CSV\n\nOnce your file is ready, learn how to import one object or activity into HubSpot.\n\nPlease note: products can only be imported in a single object import. You can associate an existing product to a line item, or manually associate a product to a deal or quote.\n\nOne object with same object associations\n\nThe following example files include the required fields to create new records and associate them with existing records of the same object.\n\nContact to contact: CSV.\n\nCompany to company: CSV.\n\nDeal to deal: CSV.\n\nTicket to ticket: CSV.\n\nMultiple objects with associations\n\nYou can import and associate multiple objects, or objects and activities, together in one file or in two separate files, where each file represents one object/activity.\n\nImport multiple objects in one file\n\nTo import and associate multiple objects/activities in one file, include the records/activities you want to associate within the same row of your file. These sample files represent common use cases, but you can mix and match objects or activities by replacing the column headers.\n\nContacts and companies sample spreadsheet: XLSX or CSV.\n\nContacts and companies with association labels sample spreadsheet: XLXS or CSV\n\nContacts and tickets sample spreadsheet: XLSX or CSV\n\nCompanies and deals sample spreadsheet: XLSX or CSV\n\nCompanies and notes sample spreadsheet: XLSX or CSV\n\nCompanies, deals, and notes sample spreadsheet: XLSX or CSV\n\nDeals and new line items sample spreadsheet (with associated products) : XLSX or CSV. When importing in one file, you can only import one line item per deal.\n\nCalls and contacts sample spreadsheet: CSV\n\nNotes and tickets sample spreadsheet: CSV\n\nTasks and existing deals sample spreadsheet: CSV\n\nEmails and existing contacts sample spreadsheet: CSV\n\nOnce your file is ready, learn how to import and associate multiple objects or activities into HubSpot.\n\nImport multiple objects in two files\n\nWhen importing and associating in two files, each file represents one object or activity. You can only import two objects or one object and one activity in a two file import. To import more than two objects/activities, you can import in one file.\n\nTo identify which records should be associated across the files, include a common column in both. One of your files should have a unique value for each row in this column. In the other file, use those values to indicate which record each row should be associated with. For example, a common use case is to import and associate contacts and companies. In the following sample files, Company Name is the common column:\n\nCompanies sample spreadsheet: XLSX or CSV.\n\nContacts sample spreadsheet: XLSX or CSV.\n\nIn the company file, there is a unique value for each row in the Company name column. In each row of the contacts file, the values in the Company name column match the company that the contact will be associated with. You can use these files when importing contacts and companies, or mix and match other objects, as long as you include a common column.\n\nAdditional examples include:\n\nDeals and companies with association labels in two files: in these sample files, Company name is the unique key for the Company object.\n\nDeals sample spreadsheet: XLSX or CSV.\n\nCompanies sample spreadsheet: XLSX or CSV.\n\nDeals and new line items in two files: in these sample files, Deal name is the unique key for the Deal object. When importing in two files, you can import multiple line items per deal.\n\nDeals sample spreadsheet: XLSX or CSV.\n\nLine items sample spreadsheet (with associated products): XLSX or CSV.\n\nCalls and contacts in two files: in these files, Email is the common column and unique key for contacts.\n\nCalls sample spreadsheet: CSV.\n\nContacts sample spreadsheet: CSV.\n\nOnce your files are ready, learn how to import and associate multiple objects or activities into HubSpot.\n\nCRM records\n\nWas this article helpful?
