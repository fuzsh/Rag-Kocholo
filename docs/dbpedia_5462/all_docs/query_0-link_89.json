        "text": "Myles Griffin\n\nWho? Houston Calls. A power-pop five-piece from Rockaway, N.J.\n\nSounds Like? Houston Calls is one of the premier bands launching Rushmore Records, a sister label to Drive-Thru Records.\n\nDrive-Thru is partly responsible for re-ushering melodic pop-punk back into the mainstream in the late '90s/early 2000s with bands such as New Found Glory, The Starting Line, Finch and FenixTx.\n\nNow that most of the bands have either changed labels or evolved their sound, Drive-Thru has been struggling lately, as most of the genre has become stale with uninspired copycats.\n\nHouston Calls heads in to change that. The music is freshly free of regurgitating variations of older guitar riffs and is strongly supported by synth keyboards and frequently a piano as well.\n\nThomas Krieger's voice sounds more natural instead of as an overproduced whine/croon combination. Although there isn't much variation in the vocals yet, sometimes the songs can run together and is not reflective of their impressive live shows.\n\nHowever, this is their debut and they will likely be able to afford to try more vocally challenging songs when the band takes off. \"A Collection of Short Stories\" is almost exactly that. While not completely full of narrative lyrics, the songs have a story-like quality about them. The songs that do act as tales still have an insightful quality, such as pondering upon what it would feel like to have been married for 40 years (\"Bob and Bonnie\"), Houston Calls just uses their perceptions on more than the typical \"let's whine about girls for 12 songs\" that this brand of rock has become. Houston Calls is a refreshing sound in a genre that has been losing its flavor.\n\nSo if you're looking for something fun to listen to or just need something to keep your little sibling/child from playing their Good Charlotte record on repeat, Houston Calls is a very wise choice. You can test them out at www.purevolume.com/ houstoncalls.\n\nLatest release: \"A Collection of Short Stories\" -- July 26\n\nDownload this: \"Exit Emergency,\" \"Amtrak Is for Lovers,\" \"Bob and Bonnie,\" \"One More Won't Hurt\"\n\nRocks like: \"Living Well Is the Best Revenge\" by Midtown, \"I Am the Movie\" by Motion City Soundtrack, \"Phantoms\" by Acceptance"
