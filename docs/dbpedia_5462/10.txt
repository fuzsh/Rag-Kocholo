ABOUT US

Richard Reines and Stefanie Reines founded Drive-Thru Records in 1996, discovering and developing bands including New Found Glory, Something Corporate (Andrew McMahon), Steel Train (Jack Antonoff), Dashboard Confessional, The Starting Line, hellogoodbye, The Early November, Senses Fail, and Finch. With over seven million record sales across the globe, multiple gold records and platinum singles, Drive-Thru became a well-known international brand.

The Reineses put the label on hold to manage bands, start a publishing company and eventually, a new record label, all under the War Road moniker. Their current roster includes Nothing But Thieves, ufo ufo, Airways, The Million, The Roads Below, and Fox Royale.

The War Road roster has amassed over 1 Billion Spotify plays, and sold out shows around the globe.
