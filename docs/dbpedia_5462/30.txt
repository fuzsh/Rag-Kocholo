Drive-Thru Records is a record label specializing largely in pop punk music. However, since its inception, its executives made an effort to sign bands outside of the mainstream pop punk genres and sealed recording contracts with emo rock, indie rock, acoustic, power pop and post-hardcore acts. Established in 1996, Drive-Thru Records is owned by siblings Richard Reines and Stefanie Reines. Bands that have achieved notable success during or after their time on the label include Halifax, Allister, New Found Glory, Fenix TX, Midtown, Finch, The Starting Line, Something Corporate, The Early November, Senses Fail, and Hellogoodbye.

Drive-Thru Records' highest Billboard 200 charting releases include The Early November's The Mother, the Mechanic, and the Path (#31) and Hellogoodbye's Zombies! Aliens! Vampires! Dinosaurs! (#13).

Rushmore Records[]

Main article: Rushmore Records

In 2002, two years before the label's official establishment, Rushmore was supposed to be a formed as a "new" Drive-Thru Records. The intention was to start the label up during Drive-Thru Records' distribution agreement with Geffen Records which was restricting co-owners Richard and Stefanie Reines from full control over the roster making them reluctant to sign new talent. Eventually, all of Drive-Thru Records' bands would be moved over to Rushmore. This was meant to be a tactic to avoid Geffen taking over more of the label's roster.

The project was largely unsuccessful with having since released a mere four CDs, whereas two thirds of the roster were either dropped from the label (due to inactivity) or left on their own will. Rushmore Records was reduced to an imprint label of Drive-Thru Records in 2006.

Love Minus Zero Recordings[]

Love Minus Zero Recordings is the second subsidiary record label created by siblings Richard and Stephanie Reines (Co-Owners of Drive-Thru Records and Rushmore Records). The labels roster consists of 2 signees: Roark and Biirdie.

The band Something Corporate is on Geffen/Drive-Thru Records. This is due to a distribution contract between the MCA (later Geffen) and Drive-Thru Records. The agreement ran from 1999 until 2004 and allowed Geffen to take over any of Drive-Thru Records' bands. Other bands affected by this were New Found Glory, Finch, The Starting Line, and Senses Fail, all were removed from Drive-Thru Records by Geffen except for Finch, who broke up, but have since regrouped. New Found Glory re-signed to Drive-Thru Records in March 2007. Senses Fail at the time had just finished recording their first full length album "Let It Enfold You," but Geffen did not like their tracks and Senses Fail refused to rerecord. The Reines' offered to have the band back on Drive Thru and Geffen seemed open to the idea. The next day Richard Reines received a call saying that Geffen had let Senses Fail sign to Vagrant. Let It Enfold You was Released September 4, 2004.
