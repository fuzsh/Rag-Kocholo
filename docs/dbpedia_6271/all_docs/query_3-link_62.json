        "text": "Collage by Grant Butler, The Oregonian/OregonLive\n\nBy Grant Butler, The Oregonian/OregonLive\n\nFifty years ago this month, a soft-spoken man walked into a TV living room, changed into a cardigan sweater and sneakers, and spoke directly to the children of America, talking about creativity, imagination, fears and individuality.\n\nWith “Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood,” Fred Rogers became everyone’s instant best friend. And the landmark show blazed the trail for shows like “Sesame Street,” which debuted the following year, as well as 1970s public television staples “The Electric Company” and “Zoom.”\n\nTo honor the anniversary of “Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood,” PBS is planning a retrospective special in March. There’s a new documentary, “Won’t You Be My Neighbor?”, which was part of the Portland International Film Festival earlier this month, and is scheduled to be released in theaters in June. And Tom Hanks has just been cast as Rogers in the biopic “You Are My Friend,” which is scheduled to begin shooting later this year.\n\nRogers also will be coming to your neighborhood soon, thanks to a new commemorative forever stamp that the United States Postal Service is releasing in March.\n\nCollage by Grant Butler, The Oregonian/OregonLive\n\nBut the golden era of kids’ TV shows in the 1960s, ‘70s and ‘80s wasn’t all high-minded, educational fare like “Mister Rogers.” There were other friendly faces like “Captain Kangaroo” on the airwaves. There were costumed characters like “Sigmund and the Sea Monsters” that bordered on psychedelia. There were live-action and animated superheroes that inspired generations of kids to turn bath towels into make-believe capes. And there were a whole bunch of crazy cartoons.\n\nSome of these shows were truly unforgettable, with catchy theme songs that are instantly recognizable decades later. Others were bizarre oddities that made you wonder what creators’ were smoking. And a few of these TV shows are positively creepy in retrospect – Bill Cosby, we’re looking at you!\n\nCollage by Grant Butler, The Oregonian/OregonLive\n\nWhile many of these kids’ shows aired for years after they were created, thanks to syndication and cable TV, almost all of them have faded into oblivion. But you can still find enough snippets of them on YouTube to spark memories of Saturday mornings spent munching Count Chocula cereal while waiting for friends like Bullwinkle, Scooby, Pee-wee and He-Man to drop by.\n\nHere’s a look at some of the stand-out children’s TV shows from the ‘60s, ‘70s and ‘80s. How many of these do you remember? Did we leave out one of your favorites? Drop a note in the comments about what made your much-loved show so special.\n\nCARTOON CAPERS\n\nNothing grabs children’s imaginations quite like cartoons, which can turn animals into super-sleuths and teenagers into rock bands.\n\n\"The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle and Friends\" (1959-64)\n\nThe adventures of Rocket J. Squirrel (aka “Rocky”) and Bullwinkle J. Moose have been packaged under various names over the years as a staple of syndicated TV. The Jay Ward cartoons originally aired on ABC and NBC in the early ‘60s as “Rocky and His Friends” and “The Bullwinkle Show,” and featured everyone’s favorite moose and squirrel, along with super spies Boris and Natasha, along with supporting cartoons like “Fractured Fairy Tales,” “Dudley Do-Right of the Mounties,” and “Peabody’s Improbable History.” In 2013, TV Guide ranked the show as the sixth-best cartoon of all time.\n\n\"The Flintstones\" (1960-66)\n\nThis landmark Hanna-Barbera series took the premise of the 1950s sit-com “The Honeymooners” and transported it to prehistoric times. Fred Flintstone is the head of a “modern Stone Age family,” living in the town of Bedrock. Much of the humor is drawn on the juxtaposition of cavemen doing very modern things, like driving cars, operating machinery, and going to the movies.\n\nBecause it was designed to appeal to adults as well as children, ABC aired it in prime-time, making it the first animated series to do so. After its initial run, it became a staple of syndicated TV, airing in many markets in the mid-afternoon, making it a staple of after-school programming in the late-‘60s and early-‘70s. It’s popularity with children led to commercial tie-ins, including sugary breakfast cereals and chewable vitamins that continue to be sold today.\n\nIn 2013, TV Guide ranked “The Flintstones” the second-greatest TV cartoon of all time (after “The Simpsons”). As Fred would say: “Yabba dabba doo!”\n\n\"The Yogi Bear Show\" (1961-62)\n\nThis cartoon show lasted only a year, but inspired numerous spin-offs over the years, and became a staple of syndicated TV. Yogi Bear lives in Jellystone Park, where he steals picnic baskets with this sidekick Boo-Boo Bear. The show also featured segments with the effeminate mountain lion Snagglepuss. Many viewers saw similarities to the foppish Cowardly Lion from the movie “The Wizard of Oz,” including actor Burt Lahr, who once sued over the character’s vocal similarities to his Lion persona.\n\n\"The Bugs Bunny Show\" (1962-71)\n\nThis Warner Bros. cartoon series, which was alternately known as “The Bugs Bunny/Road Runner Hour,” set the gold-standard for cartoon programming, with a long list of memorable characters – Daffy Duck, Elmer Fudd, Tweety and Sylvester, and on and on. Many of the cartoons were originally released theatrically in the 1940s and ‘50s (when moviegoers would get a cartoon and a newsreel along with a film), but this anthology pulled them together, along with some newly produced material. Over the years, the show would be retooled and change networks numerous times, and the Road Runner would split off into its own series. In 2000, Warner Bros. cartoons became the exclusive property of the Cartoon Network and disappeared from network television Saturday lineups.\n\n\"The Jetsons\" (1962-63)\n\nGeorge Jetson and his family were a space-age counterpoint to “The Flintstones,” and for a single season, Hanna-Barbera’s “The Jetsons” aired in prime-time. After that, reruns became part of the Saturday morning landscape, and eventually jumped around to all three major networks. In the 1980s, additional episodes were created for syndication.\n\nAt the time that it aired, “The Jetsons” had a futuristic feel, complete with a flying saucer family car, a robotic maid, and other outta-this-world tech. But some of those unbelievable gadgets now exist, including flat-screen TVs and digital tablets.\n\n\"Tennesee Tuxedo and His Tales\" (1963-66)\n\nComic legend Don Adams (of “Get Smart” fame) provided the voice for the world’s most-cynical penguin in this Total Television series, which originally aired on CBS and became a staple of syndicated TV for decades. Tennessee, along with his dim-witted buddy Chumley the walrus, caused all sorts of havoc at the Megapolis Zoo. Rounding out the anthology show were secondary cartoons, notably “The World of Commander McBragg” and “Klondike Cat.”\n\n\"Jonny Quest\" (1964-65)\n\nIn this animated adventure series, Dr. Benton Quest family was frequently called on for secret missions to battle villains around the world. Joining him were his son Jonny, bodyguard “Race” Bannon, an Indian orphan named Hadji, and their dog Bandit. This Hanna-Barbera production featured plenty of high-tech gadgetry and exotic locales, along with some racial stereotypes that aren’t easy to watch today.\n\n\"Atom Ant\" (1965-66)\n\n“Up and at ‘em, Atom Ant!”\n\nThis Hanna-Barbera cartoon was a thinly veiled parody of “Batman,” with an atomic-powered ant helping the inept local police department fight crime.\n\n\"Tom and Jerry\" (1965-72)\n\nThe “Tom and Jerry” cartoons that were made by animation giants William Hanna and Joseph Barbera for MGM studios in the 1940s and ‘50s were among the most-successful theatrical cartoon short films ever. After Warner Bros. successfully adapted its “Looney Tunes” cartoons for television, the Hanna-Barbera shorts jumped to the small screen, too, but with much less success. Some of the cartoons had to be heavily edited to tone down the slapstick violence and remove racial stereotypes. Newer versions of the cartoons with different animation styles would continue on TV on various networks over the years, and reruns still turn up from time to time on the Cartoon Network.\n\n\"Speed Racer\" (1967-68)\n\nThis Japanese animated series followed the adventures of race car driver Speed Racer, who traveled the world entering grand prix races with his powerful Mach 5 sportscar, while trying to uncover the secret of mysterious Racer X. Along for the ride: girlfriend Trixie, little brother Spritle, and his pet monkey Chim-Chim, who was always getting into mischief. In an homage to the cars driven by James Bond, Speed’s car could go under water, cut through forests, and even jump over canyons. No wonder people think Speedy’s a “demon on wheels.”\n\n\"The Archie Show\" (1968-69)\n\nIf you watch The CW’s “Riverdale,” you may think you know the premise here. Archie Andrews and his friends Betty, Veronica, Reggie and Jughead go to Riverdale High. But instead of solving murders and engaging in pre-marital sex, they spend their time learning the latest dance moves, downing burgers and shakes at the malt shop, and singing in their band. The show’s “Sugar Sugar” song became a pop hit in 1969.\n\n\"Scooby-Doo, Where Are You?\" (1969-75)\n\nThis landmark cartoon mystery from Hanna-Barbera follows the Great Dane Scooby-Doo and his four human friends – Fred, Velma, Daphne and Shaggy – as they go around the country in their Mystery Machine van, solving paranormal cases. What made the show brilliant was its subtle subversive touches – Scooby and Shaggy were clearly stoners, and Scooby Snacks were what they turned to when they got a case of the munchies. And villains tearing off fake plastic masks became a running joke that would become an early pop-cultural meme. After its initial run, spin-off series would introduce annoying sidekicks, like Scooby’s nephew Scrappy-Doo, who would annoyingly go on and on about “Puppy Power!”\n\nTV Guide ranks the original “Scooby-Doo” as the fifth best cartoon series of all time.\n\n\"The Perils of Penelope Pitstop\" (1969-71)\n\nThis Hanna-Barbera spin-off of “Wacky Races” featured voices by Mel Blanc and Paul Lynde, but couldn’t overcome its clichéd premise: the damsel in distress. Heiress Penelope Pitstop faces disaster after disaster at the hands of the villainous Hooded Claw, only to rescued by the Ant Hill Mob, a cartoonish version of the Keystone Kops.\n\n\"Josie and the Pussycats\" (1970-72)\n\nIn the early 1970s, rock bands were a premise for many children’s TV shows. This cartoon, which was based on an Archie Comics comic book series, introduced the all-girl pop group that would solve mysteries while on tour. While the show can be rightly dinged for the Pussycats skimpy wardrobe, they get credit for diversity. Nostalgia for the series led to the horrific 2001 live-action film, but also the fun inclusion of the group in the current series “Riverdale” on The CW Network.\n\n\"Jackson 5ive\" (1971-73)\n\nAlmost from the second they became a pop sensation, the Jackson 5 became the centerpiece of this psychedelic animated show, a collaboration between Motown and Rankin/Bass Productions (the makers of “Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer” and numerous other holiday specials). Michael, Jermaine, Tito, Jackie and Marlon go on adventures and sing their big hits (though they are voiced by actors, not the actual Jackson brothers).\n\n\"The Osmonds\" (1972)\n\nThe singing Osmond Brothers were popularized in the 1960s on “The Andy Williams Show,” but after the success of the Jackson brothers, the Osmonds changed their sound to the same bubblegum pop style. Of course, an animated series seemed inevitable (also produced by Rankin/Bass). There's no sign of Marie on this show, but it did feature the actual voices of the Osmond brothers.\n\n\"Speed Buggy\" (1973)\n\nHanna-Barbera had a clunker with this uninspired, short-lived series about three teenagers who travel around the world with their talking dune buggy. Despite featuring the vocal talent of Mel Blanc as Speedy, the show was hardly memorable. Several episodes even borrowed storylines from “Josie and the Pussycats.”\n\n\"Star Trek: The Animated Series\" (1973-74)\n\nWhen the original “Star Trek” was prematurely canceled in the 1960s, fans begged for it to come back. Their prayers were (sort of) answered with this animated series, which featured the voices of the original USS Enterprise crew, and featured some new characters and aliens never seen before. For hard-core Trekkers, this series is an essential bridge between the original show and the movie universe that would arrive in the late-‘70s.\n\n\"Hong Kong Phooey\" (1974)\n\nAs culturally insensitive cartoons go, it’s hard to top this short-lived Hanna-Barbera show, which lasted just 16 episodes. Scatman Crothers provided the voice (and sang the theme song) for a kung fu-practicing dog, who would drive around town in a pagoda-like car, karate chopping a gong.\n\n\"The Mumbly Cartoon Show\" (1976-77)\n\nThis Hanna-Barbera cartoon about a doggie detective only ran for a single season, and was clearly a derivative knock-off of “Scooby-Doo” and the 1950s cartoon series “Huckleberry Hound.” Mumbly did have a memorable breathy laugh (made a bit creepy by his ever-present trenchcoat, which made him look like a flasher). It may have completely lacked originality, but at least it had a catchy theme song.\n\n\"Jabberjaw\" (1976-78)\n\nFollowing the blockbuster movie “Jaws” in 1975, sharks became pop-culture gold. On Saturday mornings, shark-mania took a strange twist with this Hanna-Barbera series about a goofy great white (with mannerisms very similar to Curly from \"The Three Stooges\") who is the drummer for an undersea band called The Neptunes. Like so many cartoons of the era, when they weren’t making music they were fighting crime. Who knew the deep seas were filled with so many villains.\n\nNot to be confused with “Misterjaw,” a cartoon shark that was part of “The Pink Panther Show” at the same time. “Misterjaw” wore a top hat, spoke in a German accent (voiced by comic Arte Johnson) and exclaimed “Gotcha!” when he scared people.\n\n\"Captain Caveman and the Teen Angels\" (1977-80)\n\nIn the late-1970s, “Charlie’s Angels” was one of the hottest shows on TV. So, of course, it inspired a Saturday morning spoof, featuring three crime-fighting girls who enlist the help of a recently thawed-out prehistoric man. Captain Caveman (voiced by the great Mel Blanc) had super strength and a club that could make him fly, making him “the world’s first superhero.” It's as if Hanna-Barbera put elements of its more-successful “Scooby-Doo” and “Josie and the Pussycats” in a blender and pressed “frappe” with this one. It may not have been original, but it was entertaining enough to run for three seasons.\n\n\"Godzilla\" (1978-79)\n\nThis Saturday morning cartoon – a collaboration between Hanna-Barbera and Japan’s Toho studios – featured the famous building-stomping monster. But this time, he’s a good guy, helping out a team of scientists, and fighting a few familiar monsters from the “Godzilla” movie series. Not to be confused with a second animated series that came out in the wake of the disastrous 1998 Roland Emmerich adaptation of the monster series.\n\n\"Jana of the Jungle\" (1978)\n\nThis short-lived Hanna-Barbera cartoon was basically a female version of “Tarzan,” set in the jungles of South America. After surviving a boat accident, young Jana is raised by wild animals, and encounters natives with supernatural powers.\n\n\"Inspector Gadget\" (1983-86)\n\nLong before the Matthew Broderick movie, there was this animated series about a police inspector who solves crime with the help of thousands of ingenious gadgets. As voiced by Don Adams (of “Tennessee Tuxedo” and “Get Smart” fame), he’s not too bright, but he gets the job done.\n\n\"Mister T\" (1983-86)\n\nIn the early 1980s, tough-talking Mr. T was everywhere, with his 1982 appearance in “Rocky III” leading up to his roles in the prime-time series “The A Team,” and this Saturday morning cartoon. Mr. T was the coach of a crime-fighting group of teen gymnasts. Episodes were book-ended with live-action appearances by Mr. T, who would set up the story, then explain the episodes moral. Yes, some variation of “I pity the fool …” was uttered in each episode.\n\nWhile “Mister T” didn’t break much new ground in the teen sleuth genre of children’s programming, it has the distinction of being the only Saturday morning show featuring a dog with Mr. T’s signature Mohawk haircut.\n\n\"Kidd Video\" (1984-85)\n\nIn the early 1980s, music videos were hot hot hot! So a show inspired by MTV seemed a natural. A real-life rock band (complete with 1980s hair and fashions) is transported to the cartoon “Flip Side,” where the villain Master Blaster wants to make them musical slaves. All of the tropes of the ‘80s are here: break dancing, parachute pants, video games, skateboarding. And each episode would end with a song – and a video, natch!\n\n\"Duck Tales\" (1987-90)\n\nIn the 1980s era of “Wall Street,” the phrase “Greed is good” became a mantra for some people. No wonder, given this climate, that Disney choose to celebrate money-monger Scrooge McDuck. Despite his greed and shrewd tactics, he gradually warms to his grand-nephews Huey, Dewie and Louie, who help him thwart villains trying to steal his treasure. Disney created the show with afternoon broadcast in mind, and the cheap-looking animation was indicative of what Disney was making in the 1980s, before computer-assisted animation became common.\n\nFRIENDLY HOSTS\n\nWith a friendly demeanor and comforting words, these giants of children’s programming helped young viewers learn how to be comfortable in their own skin.\n\n\"Captain Kangaroo\" (1955-84)\n\nThis long-running children’s show actually got its start in the 1950s, but was such a running thread throughout the 1960s, ‘70s and ‘80s that you can’t write about children’s programming of that era without including it.\n\nThe premise was pretty simple: Bob Keeshan played the lovable Captain Kangaroo, who would entertain children every day in a playhouse, where friends would drop by – like Mr. Green Jeans, who always had an animal in tow. One of the show’s breakthroughs was Keeshan breaking the fourth wall, talking directly to children at home, making them feel a part of the show.\n\nThe show’s format would become the inspiration for the 1980s show “Pee-wee’s Playhouse” – what “Captain Kangaroo” might have been like if Keeshan had OD’d every day on caffeine.\n\n\"Wonderama\" (1955-77)\n\nThis regional TV show isn’t well-known on the West Coast, but for people who grew up in the New York City area, this was an essential part of Sunday mornings. From 1967 to ’77, it was hosted by Bob McAllister, who introduced the closing song “Kids Are People Too.” Featuring a studio audience of very vocal children, the show featured a variety of games, guest appearances by music groups (including ABBA!) and TV personalities, and a give-away of goodie bag of candy, kids’ magazines, fast-food coupons and Twinkies. After going off the air in NYC, McAllister jumped to ABC with “Kids Are People Too,” which was aimed more at teenagers than young children.\n\n\"The Ramblin' Rod Show\" (1964-97)\n\nThis Oregon-made children’s show featured host Ramblin’ Rod Anders, who for more than three decades wore a button-covered cardigan sweater to introduce a variety of vintage cartoons and entertain a live studio audience of kids with daily smile contests and birthday celebrations. The KPTV show originally was known as “Pier 12” before becoming “The Ramblin’ Rod Show” in the early ‘70s. When he retired in 1997, it was one of the longest-running children’s shows in the country. Anders passed away in 2002, but for generations of Oregon kids, he’ll never be forgotten.\n\n\"Mister Rogers' Neighborhood\" (1968-2001)\n\nFor 31 seasons, Fred Rogers was a gentle, reassuring voice to young children with this quiet show that encouraged imagination, helped them overcome fears, and used simple songs to underscore key points. At some point in each episode, a mini trolley car would show up, taking viewers to the Land of Make-Believe, where they’d meet puppet characters like King Friday, Daniel Striped Tiger, and prissy Lady Elaine Fairchilde. Rogers provided the voice for most of the puppets, providing sweet moments, like this one where Daniel Striped Tiger wonders if he’s a mistake, and Lady Aberlin reassures him that he is perfect just the way he is. Try watching it without tearing up a little.\n\nRogers’ mannerisms and cardigan sweaters were frequently parodied, including Eddie Murphy’s infamous “Mister Robinson’s Neighborhood” on \"Saturday Night Live\" in the 1980s.\n\nEach episode ended with the song “It’s Such a Good Feeling,” with Rogers telling children they were special. Several generations mourned when Rogers’ passed away a couple of years after the show ended its landmark run in 2001.\n\n\"The Pee-wee Herman Show\" (1986-90)\n\nComic Paul Reubens created his Pee-wee Herman persona while he was a member of the Los Angeles comedy troupe The Groundlings in the 1970s. As the character became more popular, he adapted it into a full stage show, featuring other members of the Groundlings, as a spoof of “Captain Kangaroo”-style children’s TV shows. That led to an HBO special, the 1985 movie “Pee-wee’s Big Adventure,” and finally this CBS Saturday morning show, which featured Phil Hartman, Laurence Fishburne, and S. Epatha Merkerson, among others. Each episode featured a secret word (“When you hear the secret word, scream real loud!”), physical gags, and a offbeat cartoon called “Penny.”\n\nIn 1991, Reubens was arrested on charges of exposing himself in a Florida adult movie theater, prompting CBS to cancel reruns of the show. But the “Playhouse” became a cult favorite, particularly on home video. Reubens has brought back the character several times, including the 2015 Netflix film “Pee-wee’s Big Holiday.”\n\nHIGH-FLYING SUPERHEROES\n\nLook! Up in the air! These caped crusaders fought for truth, justice and to make the world safe from giant, building-crushing monsters.\n\n\"Underdog\" (1964-67)\n\n“There’s no need to fear. Underdog is here!”\n\nHapless puppy Shoeshine Boy becomes an amazing superhero any time that Sweet Polly Purebread is in danger. This Total Television animated series was repackaged for syndication, and included some of the same secondary cartoons that were part of “Tennessee Tuxedo and His Tales.” The theme song is one of the best in cartoon history.\n\n\"Space Ghost\" (1966-68)\n\nAs superheroes go, Space Ghost had an unusual and super-cool power – he could become invisible, making him a sort of super spy. Reruns appeared in syndication for years, and the character was revived in the 1990s in a spoof of TV talk shows called “Space Ghost Coast to Coast.” The original series paired “Space Ghost” cartoons with the unrelated “Dino Boy in the lost valley” (voiced by Johnny Carson!).\n\n\"Ultraman\" (1966-67)\n\nThis Japanese action series, which was hilariously dubbed into English for broadcast in the United States, featured a science team keeping the world safe from outer-space monsters, with the help of a super-sized hero from a far-off galaxy. The epic kaiju monster battles, complete with rubber suits, look quaint today (like a low-budget version of a “Godzilla” movie), but to young viewers in the ‘60s (and ‘70s – reruns ran forever in many markets), it was syndicated eye-candy.\n\n\"Johnny Sokko and his Flying Robot\" (1967-68)\n\nOn the heels of “Ultraman” came this similarly inspired Japanese series about a boy who controlled a giant, man-made robot that was initially designed to be used for evil. But under the boy’s control, the robot fought giant monsters to protect mankind. This show inspired a generation of young boys to play in their backyards, pretending to control a giant robot by talking into their wrist-watches. “Giant robot: Launch!”\n\n\"Super Friends\" (1973-86)\n\nLong before last year’s movie stinker “Justice League,” there was this landmark Saturday morning cartoon from Hanna-Barbera, featuring characters from D.C. Comics. The show featured Superman, Batman, Robin, Wonder Woman, Aquaman, along with a rotating roster of secondary superheroes, ranging from The Flash and Green Lantern, to stereotyped characters like Samurai and Apache Chief. Two of the more annoying sidekicks were The Wonder Twins, a brother and sister who could transform into any form of water (sort of a limited super power when you think about it) or animal. They had a pet alien monkey named Gleek, who was supposed to provide comic relief.\n\nAs the Justice League of America, the superheroes battled the Legion of Doom, a group of 13 super-villains that included the Riddler, Lex Luthor and Scarecrow. Their underwater hideout is one of the coolest in cartoon history.\n\nOver the years, the show underwent many name changes, but the show’s basic premise remained the same – fighting for truth, justice and the American way!\n\n\"Shazam!\" (1974-76)\n\nThanks to a gift from the Greek gods, young Billy Batson can transform into Captain Marvel just by uttering “Shazam!” So he travels around the country in an RV with his unnamed “Mentor,” fighting crime. In the late-‘70s, “Shazam!” inspired a line of popular children’s underwear.\n\n\"The Secrets of Isis\" (1975-76)\n\nLong before the terrorist group (BOO!), there was this live-action super hero show. An Egyptian goddess gives scientist/teacher Andrea Thomas the power to soar like a falcon, run with the speed of gazelles, and command the elements to be a supernatural foe of evil. Several episodes featured cross-over appearances of Captain Marvel from “Shazam!” Cool fact: This was the first live-action TV show featuring a female superhero as the lead, arriving a year before “Wonder Woman” and “The Bionic Woman.”\n\nRepeat after me: “O zephyr winds that blow on high, lift me now so I can fly.”\n\n\"Battle of the Planets\" (1978-80)\n\nThis American adaptation of a Japanese anime series from the early 1970s got green-lit after the success of 1977’s “Star Wars,” and many elements of this series were lifted from the galaxy far far away, including the typography from the opening sequence, and a robot that looks a lot like R2D2. The story follows G Force, a group five orphans with super powers, who protect Earth’s galaxy from evil intergalactic forces. Hmm. This feels so familiar …\n\n\"Flash Gordon\" (1979-80)\n\nA year before the live-action movie version of the serial “Flash Gordon” came this animated series, which features the title character heading to outer space to protect Earth from evil Ming the Merciless. It’s sometimes referred to as “The New Adventures of Flash Gordon” to distinguish it from the film. But now it’s little more than a footnote in the superhero genre.\n\n\"Spider-Woman\" (1979-80)\n\nThis animated series was based on the Marvel Comics character, and was developed by none other than Stan Lee. The show had quite a few differences from the comic books, most-notably Spider-Woman didn’t have super-strength. But she had glider wings that essentially gave her the ability to fly, and she could project bursts on energy from her hands. Alas, it only lasted 16 episodes.\n\n\"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\" (1987-96)\n\nAfter becoming popular comic book characters, the four Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles became a hit animated series. There was a lot more comedy than in the comics, but the four pizza-obsessed superheroes still used martial arts and quick thinking to fight evil. After going off the air, the Turtles would be revived in several new animated series, along with a late-‘90s live-action series. The “heroes in a half shell” also appeared several times on the big screen, including 2016’s reviled “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows.”\n\nCRAZY COSTUMED CHARACTERS\n\nComing out of the 1960s, there were a bunch of programs featuring costumed characters that had almost nothing in common with their Disneyland cousins.\n\n\"The Banana Splits Adventure Hour\" (1968-70)\n\nThis children’s variety show from Hanna-Barbera Productions was centered on a rock band of costumed animals (created by Sid and Marty Krofft before they would launch their own famous children’s shows), and featured sketches, cartoons, and songs (none catchier than the “Tra La La” opening theme song, which became an ear-worm for a generation). Many scenes were filmed at Six Flags Over Texas Amusement Park, which made the show feel like a shameless commercial at times. Cool trivia: A number of episodes were directed by Richard Donner, who would go onto help movies like “Superman,” “Leathal Weapon,” and the much-loved “The Goonies,” which was filmed in Oregon.\n\n\"H.R. Pufnstuf\" (1969-70)\n\nThis is the show that put children’s TV producers Sid and Marty Krofft on the map. Jack Wild starred as a young boy with a magical flute, who takes a boat to a magic land. There, the evil Witchiepoo tried to steal the flute, and a magical dragon offered protection. This show didn’t last long, but it established the visual style that the Kroffts would use in shows like “The Bugaloos,” “Lidsville” and “Sigmund and the Sea Monsters.”\n\n\"The Bugaloos\" (1970-72)\n\nTotally groovy! Sid and Marty Krofft basically turned the concept of “The Monkees” into a children’s show. The Bugaloos were a rock band that lived in a forest and had wings that allowed them to fly through the sky, to the chagrin of Benita Bizarre (played, with relish, by Martha Raye).\n\n\"Lidsville\" (1971-73)\n\nEach “Bugaloos” episode included a far-out musical number.\n\nThis trippy Sid and Marty Krofft series followed a young man (played by Butch Patrick) who fell inside a giant magician’s hat and landed in a world populated by living hats. It had a “Alice in Wonderland” on acid vibe, and was memorable for the way Charles Nelson Reilly chewed up scenery as a nasty wizard. It was infectious and more than a little crazy. As the theme song says: “Everyone who goes to Lidsville really flips his lid.” Alas, it only lasted 17 episodes.\n\n\"New Zoo Revue\" (1972-75)\n\n“It’s quite an unusual thing! The animals talk and sing!”\n\nThis live-action show featured three actors in animal costumes – Freddy the Frog, Henrietta Hippo, and Charlie the Owl – interacting with humans Doug and Emmy Jo to learn about getting along and having good manners. Eagle-eyed viewers will spot perennial game show host Chuck Woolery as a mailman in some episodes.\n\n\"Sigmund and the Sea Monsters\" (1973-75)\n\nWhat does it mean to be an outcast? For sea monster Sigmund, it’s not wanting to scare people, putting him at odds with this terror-loving family, who banish him. But when he turns on a beach, he meets two brothers who aren’t scared by his tentacles and gills, and help keep him out of jams and become his best friends. As children’s TV shows go, this Sid and Marty Krofft creation was a pretty effective stab at teaching about diversity and acceptance of others.\n\n\"Land of the Lost\" (1974-77)\n\nHere’s another one from Sid and Marty Krofft that follows the same basic premise as “Lidsville” – an accidental trip to a strange land, with no easy way to get back to the real world. This time, an earthquake plunges a dad and his two kids into a strange prehistoric land of dinosaurs, hissing humanoid snake monsters called Sleestaks, and cavemen. This show was a cool combination of stop-motion animation and family adventure. There have been two misguided attempts to revive “Land of the Lost”: a 1991 series featuring Timothy Bottoms, and an unwatchable Will Ferrell movie adaptation from 2009.\n\n\"Monster Squad\" (1976-77)\n\nWhat would happen if Dracula, the Wolfman and Frankenstein’s monster teamed up to fight crime? That’s the premise of this live-action show, which aired for a single season on NBC’s Saturday morning roster. Fred Grandy (later of “The Love Boat”) stars as the night watchman of a wax museum, who leads the monsters as they try to do good deeds to make up for their evil past. Think of it as a cross between the 1960s shows “Batman” and “The Munsters,” and you get the general idea.\n\n\"The Great Space Coaster\" (1981-86)\n\nAll of the classic elements of children’s TV are here: friends making music, talking animals, fuzzy puppets and guest cameos from people like boxing legend Sugar Ray Leonard and composer Marvin Hamlisch.\n\nThe show resonated deep enough in pop culture to get its own tribute on “Family Guy.”\n\n\"Zoobilee Zoo\" (1986-88)\n\nMusical theater star Ben Vereen starred in this surreal children’s show, which featured costumed actors as a menagerie of animals who would burst into song and dance. While the makeup and musical numbers were clearly inspired by the success of the Broadway show “Cats,” the “Zoo” never entirely caught on, lasting only a few seasons.\n\nBUILD YOUR BRAINPOWER\n\nWhether they were teaching the fundamentals of spelling and grammar or sharing a love of reading, these shows inspired kids to think – and think for themselves.\n\n\"Sesame Street\" (1969-present)\n\nOf course, you remember this public TV staple from the 1970s, which is still going strong in its 48th season (now, alas, on HBO, making it less-accessible to many children). Jim Henson, Frank Oz and the gang introduced us to Bert, Ernie, Oscar the Grouch, Cookie Monster and Big Bird back in 1969. The show’s unique mix of puppets, grown-ups and children taught generations how to count, make friends, and be ourselves. Cool local tie-in: In the 1990s and 2000s, Portland actress Michele Mariana provided the voices for a number of cool characters.\n\n\"The Electric Company\" (1971-77)\n\nHey you guys!!!! This hilarious public television series used sketch comedy to teach the basics of grammar and spelling, and featured a star-studded cast that included Rita Moreno and Morgan Freeman, along with guest appearances by comedy legends like Zero Mostel and Mel Brooks.\n\nAnd here’s a sketch featuring Rita Moreno and Morgan Freeman showing how different punctuation works. Stick around to the very end for the catch-phrase that helped define the show.\n\n\"Zoom\" (1972-78)\n\nAfter the success of “Sesame Street” and “Electric Company,” public television introduced a very different sort of show, which actually encouraged kids to get off the couch, head outside and do things. The show was mostly unscripted, which made it feel real and immediate, and each episode featured a segment about children who did unique things or had unusual hobbies.\n\n\"Schoolhouse Rock!\" (1973-79)\n\nThis series of educational short cartoons aired as part of ABC’s Saturday morning lineup, wedged between half-hour shows and buffered by advertising. The original series of short cartoons, known as “Multiplication Rock” used rock and jazz songs to teach multiplication tables (most-memorable: “Three Is a Magic Number”). It was followed by “Grammar Rock” (“Conjunction Junction”), “America Rock” (“I’m Just a Bill”), and the lesser-known “Science Rock” and “Computer Rock.” After production stopped in 1979, episodes continues to air in reruns until 1985. Since then, there were a couple of TV revivals, and they’ve been released on home video.\n\n\"Reading Rainbow\" (1983-2006)\n\nLeVar Burton hosted this amazing show that celebrated books and reading for 21 seasons. Each episode featured a specific book, along with children’s reviews of it, and a segment where Burton would introduce people or places related to the themes of the featured book. The show earned an armload of Emmy Awards and even a prestigious Peabody Award.\n\n\"Fraggle Rock\" (1983-87)\n\nAfter the success of the Muppets on “Sesame Street” and “The Muppet Show,” puppet-master Jim Henson created this raucus series, which originally aired in the U.S. on HBO, though reruns appeared elsewhere in syndication. The show featured four types of characters: Fraggles, Doozers, Gorgs and Silly Creatures, and used its playful spirit to explore deep subjects like prejudice. The show was produced in collaboration with several networks around the globe, and at one point aired in 10 different languages.\n\nSHAMELESS PROMOTIONS\n\nWho did they think they were fooling? They had toys and games to sell to young’uns.\n\n\"The Smurfs\" (1981-89)\n\nThe little blue elves who live in mushroom houses date all the way back to 1958, when they were created as a Belgian comic. Over the years, their popularity grew, inspiring a popular line of figurines and toys. To help move the product line, Hanna-Barbera created this animated series, which aired on NBC during the Reagan era. Despite its clunky animation, it became a Saturday morning hit, and aired more than 250 episodes.\n\n\"He-Man and the Masters of the Universe\" (1983-85)\n\nThis TV series was originally created to sell a Mattel line of action figures, but took on a life of its own. The show told the story of a wimpy prince with a muscular alter ego, who battled the evil sorcerer Skeltor for power over the galaxy. The show’s success inspired the successful spin-off “She-Ra: Princess of Power,” as well as a disastrous 1987 live-action movie starring Dolph Lundgren.\n\n\"She-Ra: Princess of Power\" (1985-87)\n\nThe creators of “He-Man” didn’t exactly knock themselves out coming up with the concept for this spin-off series – the lead character is He-Man’s twin sister, who rises to superhero status exactly the same way he does (holding a sword aloft). The intro for the show is almost identical to its predecessor. While it was cool that there was a female counterpart to the hyper-testosterone of “He-Man,” girls deserved better than an uninspired knock-off.\n\n\"Care Bears\" (1985-88)\n\nThe Care Bears were originally created by American Greetings for a series of cards in the early 1980s, and soon became a line of Kenner stuffed animals and other toys. With product to move, the colorful creatures were turned into this syndicated cartoon, which was about as empty as the dead expressions on bear faces.\n\nVARIETY SHOWS AND RANDOM WEIRDNESS\n\nSome shows featured a mish-mash of different things they were hard to classify. Others were so odd you wondered “what were they thinking?”\n\n\"Lancelot Link: Secret Chimp\" (1970)\n\nAfter the success of the “Planet of the Apes” movies in the 1960s, primates were pop-culture gold in the 1970s, including this bizarre show about a secret detective chimp and his crime-fighting pal Mata Hairi (yes, they really spelled her name that way …. Get it?). It lasted only one season, perhaps because the producers exhausted their actors’ acting range?\n\nCrackpot theory: Children’s TV producers in the 1970s did a lot of drugs, if this clip is any indication.\n\n\"The Hot Fudge Show\" (1974-80)\n\nThis puppet-focused variety show aired in Detroit before going into national syndication. Live actors performed with the puppets (which were called Mits), in a series of sketches and songs. The first season featured Arte Johnson of “Laugh-In” fame.\n\n\"The Muppet Show\" (1976-81)\n\nAfter the success of the Muppets on “Sesame Street,” creator Jim Henson took Kermit the Frog and gave him a whole new set of theatrical friends. Instead of teaching children how to count and spell, the emphasis was on zany fun, as the characters put on a variety show featuring wise-cracking Fozzie Bear, glamour-loving Miss Piggy, a Swedish chef, a wild rock band, and even two hecklers from the balcony.\n\nBecause the show was designed to appeal to grown-ups as well as children, so it aired in syndication in the evening before network prime-time shows began.\n\nOne of the coolest things about “The Muppet Show” were its weekly guest stars, which included singers (John Denver, Paul Simon, Lena Horne, Elton John, Linda Ronstadt, Cleo Laine), comedians (Carol Burnett, Steve Martin, Harvey Korman), and versatile performers (Rita Moreno, Ethel Merman, Ruth Buzzi).\n\nThe success of “The Muppet Show” inspired a series of popular movies, as well as a deeply regrettable animated show featuring baby versions of the main characters. More on that later …\n\n\"The Kroft Supershow\" (1976-78)\n\nThis anthology show was hosted by the funky rock group Kaptain Kool & the Kongs, and featured the live-action segments “Wonderbug,” “Dr. Shrinker,” and “Electra Woman and Dyna Girl.” Later, new segments were added to the mix, including “Bigfoot and Wildboy,” and in the final season the show was massively revamped, with the pop group Bay City Rollers taking over hosting duties.\n\nCREEPY IN RETROSPECT\n\nIn hindsight, maybe these shows weren’t such a good idea.\n\n\"Jot\" (1965-74)\n\nThis minimalist religious cartoon aired in short 2- to 3-minute episodes, usually wedged between mainstream cartoons on channels high on the UHF dial. Jot was a dot-shaped boy who would learn moral lessons like obeying parents, respecting authority, and practicing the Golden Rule. Yes, it was pretty darned preachy.\n\n\"Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids\" (1972-84)\n\nBefore he became widely known as an accused rapist and one of the worst people in the world, comic Bill Cosby created this Saturday morning cartoon, which was a cornerstone of the CBS cartoon lineup. Cosby provided the voices for many of the characters, including Fat Albert himself. Many of the characters are based on kids Cosby knew growing up, though some of the stereotypes about 1970s urban life are hard to watch now. And then there’s the whole Bill Cosby thing – eww!\n\n\"Muppet Babies\" (1984-1991)\n\nHow do you ruin the Muppets? By turning them into creepy animated babies living together in a nursery under the care of a human Nanny. Instead of being cute, the infant versions of Miss Piggy, Kermit and Fozzie Bear are annoying. Worse, this started the sad trend of baby versions of other beloved shows. Did the world need “The Flintstone Kids” or “Tom and Jerry Kids”? Absolutely not!\n\nAnd we haven’t seen the last of the creep-show. A reboot of the series is coming to Disney Junior.\n\n-- Grant Butler\n\ngbutler@oregonian.com"
