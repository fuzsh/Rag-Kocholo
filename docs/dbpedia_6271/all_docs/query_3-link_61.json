        "text": "The sounds on a Woodland Hills street will never be the same, now that June Foray is gone.\n\nThe legendary voice actress died Wednesday at her home in Woodland Hills. She was 99.\n\nIf you’ve ever watched the animated “Rocky and Bullwinkle Show” or heard Granny in a Warner Bros. cartoon, the Simpsons or even video games and talking toys, you’ve heard Foray’s voice.\n\nIn her 85 years of voice acting, and as animated TV series drew audiences in the 1950s and ‘60s, Foray gave life to characters conjured up in artists’ sketches. They included:\n\n• Rocky the Flying Squirrel and his nemesis Natasha in “The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show”\n\n• Cindy-Lou Who in “How the Grinch Stole Christmas”\n\n• Looney Tunes characters Witch Hazel and Granny, owner of Tweety and Sylvester\n\n• Lucifer the Cat in Disney’s “Cinderella”\n\n• a freaky talking doll named “Talky Tina” in the “Twilight Zone”\n\n• Karen in the 1969 animated TV special “Frosty the Snowman”\n\n“In a very specialized field, she stood out like a ray of neon,” said Leonard Maltin. The well-known film critic and author knew Foray and wrote a column remembering her on his website Wednesday. “Every cartoon producer turned to her: Walt Disney, Walter Lantz, Warner Bros. and later, Chuck Jones, when he was doing his own cartoons.”\n\nMaltin said all the key players in the business knew Foray as a consummate professional who brought “humor to her performances.”\n\n• RELATED PHOTOS: June Foray, legendary voice actress of Bullwinkle’s Rocky and many more, dies at 99\n\nBorn June Lucille Forer on Sept. 18, 1917, in Springfield, Mass., Foray — as she would later become — made her on-air debut when a high school speech teacher put her on a radio program.\n\nShe moved to Los Angeles when she was 17 and began writing her own parts, performing in radio shows with icons of the era such as Jimmy Durante and Steve Allen, and voicing parts for a burgeoning film industry.\n\nHer work spanned decades, to the extent that she became known as “The Cartoon Queen.” Her range of voices was immense, from little girls to old ladies and witches to animals, like her work on “Walt Disney’s Wonderful World of Color” in 1954.\n\nForay kept working into her later years, Maltin said as he reflected on her work as president of ASIFA, The International Animated Film Society. The organization named an award after her.\n\n“She had a tremendous work ethic, and she loved doing what she did,” he said. Even into her later years, Foray would continue to show up at industry events, where “she wasn’t there just sitting like a lump in the corner,” Maltin said.\n\n• WATCH: Just a few of the many voices of ‘Cartoon Queen’ June Foray\n\nForay also created the Annie Awards, which honor outstanding work in animation, according to ASIFA-Hollywood, which runs the annual awards program and posted a lengthy tribute to Foray on its website.\n\nThe group noted that Foray devoted her life to bringing attention to the importance of animation and was instrumental in helping to craft the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences Best Animated Feature category.\n\nIn her own community, Foray made an impact. Her neighbors on Erwin Street in Woodland Hills were somber this week, but they were thankful they got to know the woman whose voice will live on in TV and films.\n\n“We were very sad,” said David Caspino, who lives nearby with his family. “She was the staple of the neighborhood here.”\n\nCaspino reflected on Foray’s years in the area, noting the stars who would visit her.\n\n“She threw the biggest parties,” he said.\n\nShe slowed down in her later years but would always have fun with local children, he added.\n\n“She looked beautiful,” he said.\n\nAs for her favorite character? Roads do seem to lead back to “The Bullwinkle Show” of the early 1960s.\n\n“Let’s just say this,” Maltin said. “She wore a golden necklace, with a gold charm of Rocky around her neck.”"
