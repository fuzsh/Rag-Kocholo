        "text": "I was still pretty much blooging whenever I felt like it in June of 2014, and Two For Tuesday was about the only thing I was doing regularly. Exactly a week after this appeared, I started blogging every day, something I’ve now done for 4 years, 1 month, 29 days including today, according to TimeAndDate.com. This particular day, rather than playing music, I decided to share a couple of episodes of my favorite cartoon.\n\nSomething a little different for your viewing pleasure…\n\nI’m a big fan of the old cartoon show “The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle,” developed by Jay Ward Studios and brought to you by General Mills Cereals. The original show ran from 1959 to 1964 on the NBC and ABC television networks, and in reruns ever since, though I haven’t seen it in a long time. This was a show that was definitely not for kids, but we watched it every night at 6:00 for a long time with absolutely no ill effects whatsoever. (Well, okay, a few.) I’m such a fan of the show that my icon on Google+ is Boris Badenov and my Twitter icon is of Aesop and his son. Boris was Rocky’s nemesis, “Aesop and Son” were characters in another feature, one practically the same as today’s feature.\n\nA regular feature of the show was something called “Fractured Fairy Tales,” narrated by the wonderful comedic actor Edward Everett Horton. They would take a fairy tale and destroy it to great comedic effect. They would introduce characters that were not in the original story, modify some of the characters so that they were grifters, and basically wreak havoc on the entire legend.\n\nI’ll show you what I mean. First, we have “Snow White.”\n\nNow, here’s what they did to “Sleeping Beauty.”\n\nFor more of this madness, YouTube appears to have just about all of them, as well as many of the other features of the show, such as “Aesop And Son”, “Peabody’s Improbable History”, “Dudley Do-Right”, and many other features of the show, not to mention the stars, “Rocky and Bullwinkle”.\n\nI really hope you’ve enjoyed the cartoons. Let me now if you’d like me to do more of this.\n\nAnd that’s your Two for Tuesday, June 24, 2014.\n\nOne of the comments I received was from my friend Halfmoon Mollie (still out there, Mollie?) who asked “what was the one where the main character was a tinker and walked through town proclaiming “I tink”. No one wanted to hire him because he smelled. So, he became a cobbler and walked the roads saying “Cobble cobble” until someone shot him because he sounded like a turkey….I love R&B and especially Fractured FairyTales.” As a bonus, here’s that episode, “The Little Tinker.”\n\nAnd this ends my series of “summer reruns.” Tune in on Monday when I’ll reveal my next series."
