        "text": "DreamWorks Animation Television Creates Two Original Kids Series for Amazon Prime Video\n\nAs a kid one of Amy all time favorites was Rocky and Bullwinkle (which probably ages me just a tad!) I can remember going to my Memaw’s and Papaw’s before school and watching their antics unfold. It always brought a smile to my face and the adventures were one of a kind. But now a whole new generation will be able to fall in love with characters again because The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle and Kung Fu Panda: The Paws of Destiny will debut this year!\n\nDreamWorks Animation Television is creating two original kids series for Amazon Prime Video, beginning with the all-new The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle expected to premiere May 11, 2018 in the US, UK, Germany, India, and Japan. A second series inspired by the blockbuster franchise, Kung Fu Panda: The Paws of Destiny, will have a global debut later this year in over 200 territories, also on Prime Video.\n\nThe world-famous talking moose and flying squirrel are back in The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle, a serialized comedy about two goofball best friends who routinely find themselves thrust into harrowing situations but end up saving the day time and again. As Rocky and Bullwinkle’s innocent and silly ambitions to become rock stars or find lost treasure end up dovetailing with Fearless Leader’s sinister plans to take over the world, our heroes are set on a collision course with his notorious super spies Boris Badenov and Natasha Fatale.\n\nThe series is executive produced by Scott Fellows (The Fairly OddParents, Big Time Rush) and Tiffany Ward, daughter of the original series producer Jay Ward, and features Tara Strong (The Powerpuff Girls, Teen Titans Go!) as the voice of Rocket J. Squirrel, Brad Norman (America’sMost Haunted) as Bullwinkle J. Moose, Ben Diskin (Hey Arnold!) as Boris Badenov, Rachel Butera (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles) as Natasha Fatale, Piotr Michael (Impress Me, MADtv) as Fearless Leader and Daran Norris (The Fairly OddParents) as Narrator.\n\nLater in 2018, Prime Video will premiere Kung Fu Panda: The Paws of Destiny, an epic adventure series from Emmy Award-winning executive producers Mitch Watson (All Hail King Julien) and Elliott Owen (All Hail King Julien), and Lane Lueras (The Adventures of Puss in Boots). When four panda kids stumble upon a mystical cave beneath Panda Village, accidentally absorbing the chi of ancient and powerful kung fu warriors known as the Four Constellations, they must realize a destiny to save the world from an evil force. Meanwhile, Po finds himself faced with his biggest challenge yet — teaching this ragtag band of kids how to wield their newfound powers.Fu Panda: The Paws of Destiny marks the first time an original series from DreamWorks Animation Television will be made available to Prime Video customers worldwide. Since 2013,"
