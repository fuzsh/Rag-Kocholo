        "text": "That is correct -- I notice on the DVDs, the Season 2 closing (the one with the credits on Bullwinkle's \"itty-bitty card\") has two versions with slightly different dialogue. When Rocky says they're out of time, Bullwinkle looks at his hourglass-watch and in one version, he says \"just about enough time to tell 'em who the sponsor was,\" and in the other he says \"mine must be a little slow.\" Both are vintage closings, but the second was created later, i.e. this was not redubbed by a different voice actor or anything. One version has a 1960 date and the other says 1997.\n\n(I should clarify -- it's the \"Season 2 closing,\" meaning that's where it originally appeared, but on these reshuffled half-hours, it appears on shows from any season.)\n\nIf you're up early enough to catch Rocky & Bullwinkle on boomerang on weekends, you'll get to hear the theme music for all the segments that most of us know & love, and we all wish they'd put on the DVDs...what's on the DVDs was put there by Jay Ward's daughter. Apparently that was one of his personal requests before he passed; for whatever reason those were the musical intros he preferred; I personally prefer the first season music and I know I'm not alone. My personal take: the theme music on the DVDs just doesn't have the same character. Get up early on weekends and tune it in!\n\nI know they said Jay Ward preferred the later themes (and that's the official story) -- the ones on the DVDs were used on The Bullwinkle Show starting in 1961, while the \"common\" ones were used during the first two seasons on Rocky And His Friends -- but how much you want to bet the reason he \"preferred\" them was because they were either cheaper or royalty-free to use?\n\nWhen the shows were syndicated later, the earlier (ABC-era) music usually appeared, though once in a while a Fred Steiner cue would slip in. (One major exception was \"Fractured Fairy Tales,\" which usually used the 1959 intro music and 1961 outro music -- they don't match.) I believe any time the shows aired on a US TV network on Saturday mornings, the Steiner music (i.e. the same as on the DVDs) would be used. The original Bullwinkle Show theme song is a Steiner piece, so it probably would have been OK to use on the DVDs if they hadn't decided to rechristen the whole package The Adventures Of Rocky And Bullwinkle And Friends and use the 1961 Rocky & Bullwinkle segment intro music as the overall theme song for the whole show. Would have been nice to have the original versions of the various show openings (including The Rocky Show and The Bullwinkle Show) as extras, but even though they weren't included, I was amazed to see all the stuff they did include -- commercials, promos, pencil tests, and a boatload of Bullwinkle puppet intros! (Even if the latter sure look to me like colorized versions of B&W prints of something originally filmed in color!)"
