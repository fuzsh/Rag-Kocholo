        "text": "Original Ward art features pieces from animators Pete Burness, Sam Clayberger, Bill Hurtz, Shirley Silvey, Bobe Cannon, Al Shean and many others. Dreamworks art includes work by Tim Lamb, Shane Prigmore, Craig Kellman, David James and others.\n\n“Jay Ward had some of the finest artists in the business working at his\n\nself-described “fun house.”, says curator Van Citters – author of the recently published The Art Of Jay Ward Productions. “Many had been Disney-trained and most of them\n\nhad gone through the groundbreaking UPA studio or had developed their talents\n\nat the prestigious Los Angeles art schools. This exhibit features a small sample of\n\nthe Ward artists’ work during the first few years of the small studio’s\n\nexistence. It was an eclectic but highly talented group of artists and if\n\nyou grew up watching Rocky and Bullwinkle or any of the other Jay Ward shows,\n\nyou’ll gain a new appreciation for the artistry behind the scenes.”\n\nThe famed Rocky & Bullwinkle statue – formerly in front of the original Jay Ward studio on Sunset Blvd – has been completely restored by Ricardo Scozzari for Bullwinkle Studios and Dreamworks Animation. It was unveiled last night in a ceremony at The Paley Center (photos below) where it will be on display for at least 6 months. It’s permanent home is yet to be determined."
