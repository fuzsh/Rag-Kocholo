As some of our \"mature\" customers may recall from television in the 1960's and 1970's, Dudley Do-Right frequently appeared in the Rocky and Bullwinkle cartoon series as the comical and typically inept representative of the RCMP (Royal Canadian Mounted Police) who pursued villain Snidley Whiplash, and who courted girlfriend Nell Fenwick. We rarely see examples of this model, and the current example is in superb condition with super clean case and rich saturated polychrome dial.",
