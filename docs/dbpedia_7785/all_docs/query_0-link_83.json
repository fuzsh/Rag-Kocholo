        "text": "Essays on Hayek.\n\nHAYEK, Friedrich August von [F.A.]; Foreword by Milton Friedman; Edited by Fritz Machlup.\n\nItem Number: 5618\n\nNew York: New York University Press, 1976.\n\nFirst edition of these collection of essays on the Nobel Prize-winning economist. Octavo, original cloth. Fine in a very good dust jacket with a light wear to the extremities. Signed by Milton Friedman on the front free endpaper and F.A. Hayek on the title page. We have never encountered these two Nobel Prize-winning economists signature in the same volume. Edited by Fritz Machlup. Essays by William F. Buckley, Jr., Gottfried Dietze, Ronald Max Hartwell, Shirley Robin Letwin, Fritz Machlup, George C. Roche III and Arthur Shenfield. Housed in a custom half morocco clamshell box.\n\n\"Friedrich Hayek’s influence has been tremendous. His work is incorporated in the body of technical economic theory; has had a major influence on economic history, political philosophy and political science; has affected students of the law, of scientific methodology, and even of psychology. But from the particular perspective of the present book, all of these are secondary to Hayek’s influence in strengthening the moral and intellectual support for a free society\" (Milton Friedman)."
