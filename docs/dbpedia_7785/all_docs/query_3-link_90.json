        "text": "Arguably the most influential economists of the twentieth century were John Maynard Keynes and Friedrich A Hayek.\n\nIt is known that Keynes stood for massive government intervention in the economy to lift it out of recessions while Hayek (belonging to the Austrian School of Economics) believed in the government doing nothing during a recession.\n\nTo understand better their respective stands, it is informative to revisit the Austrian Business Cycle Theory (ABCT) which Hayek followed and the Keynesian theory of the business cycle.\n\nA business cycle is a sequence of economic \"booms\" and \"busts\" and the ABCT explains why this happens.\n\nFirst of all, the Austrian Economics differentiates between different types of goods (Keynesian and Monetarist theories with their concepts of \"aggregate demand\" and \"aggregate supply\" tend to lump all goods into one category). The \"consumer goods\" are directly consumed (e.g. food, soaps, perfumes etc). The \"capital goods\" are used to produce the \"consumer goods\" or other capital goods. Thus they are one or more steps removed from the consumer goods (e.g. machines that make soaps or machines that make machines that make soap etc). Thus we have \"lower order goods\" (closer to consumer goods) and \"higher order goods\" (farther away from consumer goods).\n\nConsider an economy at equilibrium. Suppose banks print money, thereby lowering interest rates, and lend to the industry. Some entrepreneurs who have been manufacturing consumer goods may take this as a sign of a healthy economy and shift to longer term planning (they are unable to differentiate between interest rate lowering due to increased savings and money printing). Thus they may shift to making higher order goods (capital goods) that will later enable them to manufacture consumer goods more efficiently.\n\nAs the manufacturers shift from consumer goods to capital goods, there is a shortage of supply of consumer goods and this leads to price rise in consumer products. This will be viewed as inflation and banks will respond by increasing interest rates.\n\nThis will cause the manufacturers of capital goods to stop midway as they cannot afford to pay the higher interest. This will trigger a recession, i.e. job losses and lower GDP.\n\nThis is the ABCT in brief. Thus the business cycle is primarily due to monetary intervention by banks in the economy. The only way to recover from a bust is for the banks and government to do nothing. Any further intervention like QE will only prolong the recession.\n\nYou might ask: why is there deflation during a recession? Well, banks become wary of lending as some of the capital goods manufacturers find it difficult to repay their loans. Moreover in times of crisis people prefer to keep money on hand rather than spend them. This leads to a contracting money supply leading to a deflation.\n\nContrast the ABCT with the \"underconsumption\" theory which was proposed by John Maynard Keynes. According to the latter theory, the \"boom\" period in the business cycle is marked by overproduction of goods that lead to a crisis of unsold stocks of goods, excess capacity of plant, and unemployment of labour. In other words, the capitalistic system produces \"too much in the boom\".\n\nThis causes consumer demand to be insufficient to buy up the goods produced - also called \"underconsumption\" or \"declining aggregate demand\". Hence the crisis and the depression. The related feature is that people tend to hoard (excessively save) and underspend money and not make it available for investment. So the Keynesian remedy is to stimulate spending.\n\nIf the Keynesian underconsumption theory were to be true, the effect would be more felt in the consumer goods industry where surplus pile up, and less felt in the capital goods industry. But as Austrian economist Murray N Rothbard writes: \"Yet, it is generally admitted that it is the producers', not the consumers' goods industries that suffer most during a depression. Underconsumptionism cannot explain this phenomenon, while [the ABCT] explains it precisely. Every crisis is marked by malinvestment and undersaving, not underconsumption.\"\n\nIt must be stated that the Keynesians have come up with a clever idea they call the \"acceleration principle\" to explain this anomaly but Rothbard makes mincemeat of this concept in his book \"America's Great Depression\". Rothbard asserts that the ABCT is the only theory that can explain cyclical booms and busts.\n\nIn times of a crisis, the Austrian approach advocates austerity (the term \"austerity\" just means \"living with one's means). The Keynesians, on the other hand, advocate infusion of money into the economy to stimulate spending.\n\nThis is not just a right-left debate. This goes beyond that. It offers two different ways of looking at the world. Austrian economics has provided theories that are scientifically validated. Keynesian economics has unleashed a Ponzi scheme around the world.\n\nDoes this mean that all Austrian economists are hard-hearted? I don't think so. Hayek has argued that in an advanced society which is prosperous, \"there can be no doubt that some minimum of food, shelter, and clothing, sufficient to preserve health and the capacity to work, can be assured to everybody.\" Furthermore, the state should \"assist the individuals in providing for those common hazards of life against which, because of their uncertainty, few individuals can make adequate provision.\" He has also averred that, in times of widespread hardship, something like the Universal Basic Income may be considered.\n\nThus in times of dire crisis, such as that facing us now, the state can, and should, lend a helping hand. But let us not call it stimulating the economy or infusing cash into the economy! That only worsens the problem at hand.\n\nWith this briefest of introduction to the ABCT and to Keynesianism, let us see how the debate started.\n\nKeynes was already a well-known figure when Hayek started out his career in economics in the 1920s under the mentorship of the great Austrian economist Ludwig von Mises. Keynes, who was at Cambridge, was spreading ideas about how government should make life easier, particularly for the unemployed, by interfering in the economy.\n\nLionel Robbins, who was chair of political economy at the London School of Economics (LSE), considered Keynes’s ideas dangerous and was looking for a way to counter him. Robbins had read with great relish the Austrian economists in German, including Hayek, and invited Hayek to join the LSE. Robbins thought that Hayek would be the right choice to combat Keynes.\n\nHayek began his attack on Keynes by harshly reviewing his book A Treatise on Money. The review was published in the August 1931 issue of the journal Economica. His thrust was that Keynes’s ideas were at variance with those of the Austrian school. Worse, they were wrapped in a language incomprehensible to most economists.\n\nKeynes responded by not replying to Hayek’s criticism but maliciously commenting on Hayek’s earlier book Prices and Production, again in the journal Economica.\n\nThis led to an extensive debate on the pages of Economica and then spilled over into personal correspondence. The debate caught the attention of the entire economics world. Soon Hayek’s group of followers at the LSE started battling Keynes’s coterie at Cambridge.\n\nSoon Keynes got exasperated by the debate. He had moved on from his earlier ideas and was focussed on completing his masterpiece, The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money. Through this book, Keynes wanted show how the governments could spend their way out of the Great Depression. The book introduced the concepts of “aggregate demand”, “underconsumption”, and “the multiplier” and inadvertently launched the field of macroeconomics.\n\nThe book was received by the economics world with great fanfare. Keynes attained celebrity status by proposing fiscal spending and tax cuts to stimulate the economy. A response was expected of Hayek but Hayek remained astonishingly silent. Hayek felt that there were so many things wrong with the book that he had to come up with his own competing version of The General Theory, which was called The Pure Theory of Capital.\n\nKeynes took his ideas to America where they were used to address the Great Depression. When America emerged out of the Great Depression on the onset of World War II, the Keynesian Revolution had started.\n\nThe period from 1945 to 1977 can be considered the age of Keynes and in this period the Keynesian Revolution was in full swing. This was the period when Hayekian ideas were relegated to obscurity.\n\nThe Keynesian Revolution only slowed down in the 70s during the onset of “stagflation” in the US which could not be explained by Keynesian economics. That was the start of the Hayekian counterrevolution. Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan picked up on Hayekian ideas and ran with them. (Thatcher, during a meeting with left-leaning Conservative Party members, famously reached into her bag and slammed a copy of Hayek’s Constitution of Liberty on the table, crying, “This is what we believe!”).\n\nIn the present times, after the death of both Keynes and Hayek, the debate continues. Two schools of economics have formed in the US, the “freshwater economists” and the “saltwater economists”. The freshwater economists, so called because their universities cluster around the Great Lakes, consider, like Hayek, inflation to be the country’s greatest curse; saltwater economists who are from universities around the coastal areas, think like Keynes that unemployment is more serious than inflation.\n\nThese debates are never ending and have taken on a new importance after the 2008 crisis. President George W Bush, who was formerly a Hayekian, almost overnight became Keynesian at the onset of the Great Recession.\n\nPerhaps it is a feature of representative democracy that, even though one set of ideas appear right, populism demands that politicians swing over to another set of ideas which would help them win elections.\n\nReferences\n\nRothbard, Murray N., America’s Great Depression, 5th Edition, Mises Institute, Alabama (2000).\n\nWapshott, Nicholas, Keynes Hayek: The Clash That Defined Modern Economics, W W Norton & Company, NY (2011)"
