        "text": "Economic terms, from âabsolute advantageâ to âzero-sum gameâ, explained to you in plain English\n\nAbsolute advantage\n\nA concept that helps to explain international trade. If country A is better at making toasters than country B, and B is better at making kettles than A, it makes sense for each country to focus on the area where they have this advantage, and then trade toasters for kettles. But see, more importantly, comparative advantage.\n\nActive management\n\nA branch of investment management that attempts to outperform other investors by selecting a limited number of assets, and trading them regularly. See also passive management.\n\nActivist investing\n\nFund managers who take a stake in a company and then agitate for a change of management, or strategy, in the belief that this will increase profits, and thus the share price.\n\nAdverse selection\n\nA risk associated with insurance, and linked to asymmetric information. People who are worried about their health will be more inclined to pay for health insurance than those who are fighting fit. One way to avoid the problem is to make insurance compulsory for all, as happens with car ownership. For more detail, see our Schools Brief.\n\nAgency costs\n\nThe expense involved in using a third party to carry out a task. Examples include hiring a fund manager to look after an individualâs investment portfolio, or the cost to shareholders of having professional managers run a business. See also principal-agent problem.\n\nAggregate demand\n\nThe flow of spending, across the economy, on goods and services. Demand can fall, even if peopleâs income and wealth are unchanged, if they decide to save, rather than spend.\n\nAgriculture\n\nThe cultivation of crops and the tending of animals for the purpose of supplying food. For millennia, this was mankindâs primary economic activity.\n\nAlpha\n\nThat part of an investment return that is due to the skill of the fund manager. This can be very hard to measure.\n\nAmortisation\n\nThe gradual reduction in the value of an asset (or a debt) over time. A debt (such as a mortgage) is amortised via regular repayments. Companies use amortisation to steadily reduce the value of intangible assets on their balance-sheets.\n\nAnimal spirits\n\nTerm used by John Maynard Keynes to describe sentiment among businesspeople and consumers. If sentiment is depressed, economies may struggle to escape from recession. For more detail, read this article. See also Keynesian economics.\n\nAntitrust\n\nTerm used to describe laws or regulations designed to stop firms from exploiting their monopoly positions in markets at the expense of consumers or rival businesses. To learn more, see our Schools Brief.\n\nAppreciation\n\nThe rise in the value of an asset. In particular, currencies are often described as appreciating when they go up and depreciating when they go down.\n\nArbitrage\n\nThe practice of exploiting price differentials in different markets; for example, buying an asset cheaply in London and selling it for a higher price in New York. Thanks to the speed of modern information flows, risk-free arbitrage opportunities are rare. See also regulatory arbitrage.\n\nAsset\n\nSomething that can be used to create economic value. An asset can be tangible, such as a building or machinery or intangible, such as a patent or a brand name. Assets make up one side of a companyâs balance-sheet; the other is liabilities.\n\nAsset stripping\n\nThe practice of buying a company and rapidly selling off the component parts with the aim of making a profit. This often leads to great disruption in the business and a loss of jobs.\n\nAsset value\n\nOne measure used by investors to calculate the worth of a company. Normally, a companyâs debts are deducted to calculate a net asset value. Also known as book value.\n\nAsymmetric information\n\nThis occurs when one party to a transaction knows more than the other. Asymmetry can lead to market abuse, as when those with inside information of a coming takeover buy shares in the target company. It can also lead to inefficiencies. Since buyers of used cars know less than sellers, they will be inclined to regard all cars as potential âlemonsâ, leading to lower prices. See also adverse selection and moral hazard. To learn more, see our Schools Brief.\n\nAuctions\n\nThese are usually associated with the sale of livestock, antiques and works of art. But in recent decades, they have been favoured by economists as a means of ensuring that sellers get the best price for a wider range of assets. For example, governments have used auctions to sell off parts of the electromagnetic spectrum to mobile telecoms companies. See this article for more detail.\n\nAusterity\n\nA term used to describe efforts to reduce the share of public spending in GDP, particularly in the 2010s. When the economy is already weak, Keynesian economists view austerity programmes as a mistake, because they reduce demand. But free-market economists worry that, without austerity, the governmentâs role in the economy inexorably expands over time.\n\nAustrian school\n\nA group of libertarian economists, notably Friedrich Hayek and Ludwig von Mises, focused on the individual and deeply suspicious of state planning. The school developed in opposition to communism and social democracy, and believes in low taxes and a minimal state.\n\nAutarky\n\nSelf-sufficiency. Authoritarian regimes sometimes pursue a policy of autarky in order to reduce their dependence on other countries. Economists generally regard this approach as inefficient since trade in goods and services allows a country to specialise in those activities which it is best at producing, exploiting comparative advantage.\n\nAuthoritarian capitalism\n\nUsually applied especially to China and Russia, this describes economies in which big business co-exists with an authoritarian government. Businesses are allowed to make money but if they dare to criticise the government, or appear too independent, they may face criminal or financial sanctions.\n\nB\n\nBackwardation\n\nA term used in the commodity market for when the price for delivering a product today (the spot price) is higher than for delivery in future. Normally, the future price is higher, a situation known as contango. Backwardation is normally the sign of a supply shortage, causing traders to compete to get the product immediately.\n\nBalance of payments\n\nA term used to describe a countryâs transactions with the rest of the world. The import and export of goods and services are captured in the current account, which also includes investment income and transfers (such as expatriate workers sending money home). The capital account captures financial transactions such as foreign direct investment or purchases of bonds and equities. These will balance in the sense that a current-account deficit (or surplus) must be offset by a capital-account surplus (or deficit).\n\nBalance-sheet\n\nIn accounting, a statement of the assets and liabilities of a business. It must balance in the sense that assets equal liabilities. The assets such as cash or equipment or inventory are being used in the business; the liabilities show how those assets were funded whether in the form of debt (owed to creditors) or equity (owed to shareholders).\n\nBank rate\n\nTerm used in Britain to describe the official rate set by the Bank of England when it pays interest to commercial banks. By manipulating this rate, the Bank of England affects the level of rates that businesses and consumers pay to borrow money.\n\nBank run\n\nIn a crisis, bank depositors may start to doubt they will get their money back. So they may demand to withdraw it. Since banks have lent out this money, it is impossible for them to repay all depositors instantly. The bank may fail. To avoid this, most countries have schemes of deposit insurance.\n\nBanks\n\nInstitutions at the heart of the financial system. Commercial banks take in deposits and make loans, thereby creating money. In a crisis, banks may cease lending (or insist on the repayment of past loans) causing immense economic damage. Investment banks advise on transactions such as acquisitions and make markets in financial assets such as bonds and shares. Many institutions act as both commercial and investment banks.\n\nBarter\n\nThe direct swap of goods and services for other goods and services, without the use of money. This is normally a less efficient form of trade, since the wants and needs of buyers and sellers rarely match exactly.\n\nBasis point\n\nOne hundredth of a percentage point. The term is often used to describe interest rate changes. A quarter-percentage-point rise or fall in rates is described as 25 basis points.\n\nBaumolâs cost disease\n\nIn theory, workers should get higher pay because they get more productive. But an economist called William Baumol noticed this isnât always true; musicians take the same time to play a string quartet as they did in Mozartâs day, but are paid more nevertheless. The reason is competition for labour; musicians can take other jobs. So rising wages in productive parts of the economy (eg, manufacturing) lead to higher wages in less productive sectors. For more on the disease, read this article; for more on Baumol, read this one.\n\nBear\n\nInvestor who expects the price of an asset or assets in general to fall.\n\nBehavioural economics\n\nSchool of thought that believes that the economic decisions of individuals are often driven by psychological biases rather than the rational analysis of expected returns. One example is the endowment effect. Individuals value the goods they own more highly than they would pay for the same item in an open market. For more, see this article.\n\nBeta\n\nThis ratio measures the sensitivity of an individual assetâs price to that of the overall market. A stock that tends to go up even more rapidly than the market when it is rising, and drop more precipitously when it is falling, is described as âhigh betaâ; one that moves less violently than the market is âlow betaâ.\n\nBig Mac index\n\nA light-hearted guide to whether currencies are over- or undervalued, invented by The Economist in 1986. The index is based on the theory of purchasing-power parityâthe notion that in the long run exchange rates should tend to equalise the prices of goods in different currencies. Fresh helpings of burgernomics are served up regularly. You can tuck into the latestâwith a side of more details about the indexâhere.\n\nBill of exchange\n\nA short-term financial instrument, originally used to finance international trade. The buyer of goods would give the seller a signed bill, equal to the value of the purchase, which the seller could then cash with a banker. In modern finance, bills are a catch-all term for short-term debt such as Treasury bills and commercial bills.\n\nBlockchain\n\nA distributed ledger used to make a digital record of the ownership of assets, in particular cryptocurrencies.\n\nBonds\n\nIOUs issued by a borrower which normally promise repayment of the money on a set date (the maturity) with regular interest payments during the life of the bond. The more risky the issue, the higher the interest rate (or yield) on the bond. Governments issue bonds to cover the gap between the amount they receive in taxes and the amount they spend. Companies issue bonds to finance investment programmes.\n\nBook value\n\nAnother term for asset value.\n\nBoom\n\nA state of rapid economic expansion, as opposed to bust.\n\nBounded rationality\n\nA theory which assumes that, while individuals try to act rationally, there is a limit to the amount of information they may have, or can absorb. This may make their decisions look irrational (see also behavioural economics).\n\nBretton Woods\n\nLocation in New Hampshire of a conference in 1944 which decided the post-war economic order. It led to the establishment of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. And it agreed on a currency system that linked all currencies at fixed exchange rates to the dollar, which was convertible into gold at $35 an ounce.\n\nBubble\n\nThe concept that asset prices can rise far higher than can be justified by their fundamentals, such as the expected cashflows that will derive from them. A famous example is the South Sea bubble of the early 18th century. Economists who believe in efficient markets are dubious that bubbles ever occur. Identifying bubbles at the time isnât always easy: see this article.\n\nBudget\n\nThe annual process through which a government sets out its spending plans and tax measures. A balanced budget is when revenues are expected to match expenditure. More usually, spending outstrips revenues and the government runs a budget deficit. Creating or expanding a deficit can be a deliberate act to boost an economy (see Keynesian economics).\n\nBull\n\nInvestor who expects the price of an asset or assets in general to rise.\n\nBusiness cluster\n\nWhen companies in an industrial sector gather in a specific area, such as technology companies in Silicon Valley. When a cluster forms, companies will find it easier to attract high-skilled staff, workers have a wider choice of employers, innovations can circulate more quickly and start-up companies may find it easier to get finance.\n\nBusiness cycle\n\nAnother term to describe the way that economies tend to expand and contract over time. Various economists have tried to calculate the length of a typical cycle but these have varied widely over history. Booms tend to be much longer than busts, particularly in recent decades. As this article explains, economists still lack a proper understanding of business cycles.\n\nBust\n\nA sudden economic contraction, also known as a recession.\n\nC\n\nCapital\n\nA word that serves a lot of purposes in economics. It is used to refer to the investment that an entrepreneur puts into a new project or business (hence capitalism); to any lump sum that has been saved; and more broadly to the people and institutions who invest in the worldâs financial markets. It can also refer to a bankâs equity capital.\n\nCapital account\n\nIn international trade, the component of the balance of payments that comprises financial transactions, such as foreign direct investment. On a companyâs balance-sheet, the capital account largely comprises the equity capital invested by the owners and retained profits.\n\nCapital asset pricing model\n\nA financial model that relates the return of an asset class to its riskiness. It is based on the idea of a risk-free asset (usually defined as government bonds). Investors in riskier assets (like equities) should demand a higher return than they get from government bonds to reflect the greater risk of loss. This risk relates to the beta of the asset concerned.\n\nCapital controls\n\nRegulations designed to prevent money from moving across borders. They are often used in regimes with a fixed exchange rate; by preventing money from flowing abroad, they protect the domestic currency from depreciation. Capital controls were a key component of the Bretton Woods system. For more detail, read our Explainer.\n\nCapital flight\n\nWhat happens when investors try to avoid high taxes, or the prospect of currency devaluation, by sending their money abroad. Governments try to prevent such flight by imposing capital controls but they need to act quickly. Investors will anticipate the introduction of capital controls by indulging in capital flight.\n\nCapital gains tax\n\nA tax levied when investors sell assets for more than the purchase price. Some economists argue that such taxes discourage risk-taking. But if capital gains are tax-free, and income is taxable, that creates a potential incentive; ingenious accountants will find ways to transform income into capital gains.\n\nCapital goods\n\nPhysical assets that companies use in the manufacturing process.\n\nCapital markets\n\nThose markets where governments, companies and other institutions raise long-term money in the form of equities and bonds. By contrast, the term âmoney marketsâ is used for the places where short-term finance is raised.\n\nCapitalism\n\nA term coined to describe the use of private capital to finance economic activity. Investors and entrepreneurs use their money to create businesses, hiring workers, renting property and buying equipment as needed. Any surplus, or profit, belongs to the entrepreneur or investors. Communism is seen as the obverse of capitalism, as all economic activity is controlled by the state.\n\nCarbon tax\n\nA tax levied on carbon emissions. The aim is to penalise heavy emitters and encourage alternative approaches that do not contribute to global warming. For more on their designâand unpopularityâsee this article.\n\nCartel\n\nAgreement where a group of producers collaborate to fix the price, or restrict the supply, of a good or service. Perhaps the best known example is the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC. Cartels among companies are often outlawed by government antitrust regulations because they restrict competition.\n\nCentral bank\n\nThe institution at the heart of a countryâs financial system. It has many roles. Traditionally, it sets the level of short-term interest rates through its interactions with commercial banks. It uses rate changes to control inflation (often under an inflation targeting regime) and affect the level of economic output. More recently, central banks have attempted to affect long-term interest rates through quantitative easing. The central bank acts as a lender of last resort to protect the financial system from collapse; some central banks also act as regulators. Central banks also control foreign exchange reserves and can use these to intervene in the currency markets.\n\nChicago school\n\nA school of thought that emerged from the University of Chicago and was associated with belief in the free market, monetarism, and that people are rational, and act in their self-interest. Its leading exponents include Gary Becker, Ronald Coase and Milton Friedman. The school gained influence in the 1970s, as conservative politicians adopted its nostrums and the Keynesian post-war consensus broke down. See also monetarism and public choice theory.\n\nClassical economics\n\nThe dominant school of thought in the late 18th and 19th centuries, as developed by Adam Smith and David Ricardo. It largely focused on the self-correcting nature of economies if left alone by governments and thus argued for a laissez faire approach and, thanks in part to the theory of comparative advantage, developed by Ricardo, a belief in free trade.\n\nCoase theorem\n\nA concept, developed by Ronald Coase (see article), that deals with externalities. Coase thinks of the problem in terms of conflicting property rights such as the right of a factory to operate noisy machinery and the right of its neighbours to enjoy peace and quiet. If property rights are clearly delineated then, in the absence of transaction costs, bargaining should lead to an efficient outcome, such as the factory compensating its neighbours for the noise. Coaseâs work on externalities, along with that on the theory of the firm, won him a Nobel prize in 1991.\n\nCoaseâs theory of the firm ( theory of the firm )\n\nRonald Coase, a British economist, tried to explain why companies exist in âThe nature of the firmâ, a paper published in 1937. His answer was that markets can be expensive and fiddly to use, especially for non-standard goods. Rather than arrange contracts for each and every transaction, entrepreneurs set up firms and employ workers to do a range of tasks. This allows them to shift employees from one area to another as they see fit. The paper, along with his work on externalities and property rights, helped to win Coase the Nobel prize for economics in 1991. For more detail, read our Schools Brief.\n\nCollateral\n\nAn item pledged as security against a loan. An obvious example is a house or flat, which homeowners used as collateral when taking out a mortgage. In financial markets, safe securities such as Treasury bonds are often used as collateral by traders and investors.\n\nCommercial banks\n\nBanks that focus on taking in money in the form of deposits and lending it out to individuals and businesses. Such banks have a weakness in that most deposits can be withdrawn instantly whereas it can take time to recall loans. This can lead to a bank run.\n\nCommodity\n\nA raw material, such as oil or copper, that is usually traded in bulk. Changes in commodity prices can have significant economic effects by, for example, feeding through into consumer prices. A sharp rise in energy prices can adversely affect consumer demand; because consumers have to spend more on energy, they have less to spend elsewhere. For more, read this Explainer.\n\nCommodity cycle\n\nA pattern of rising and falling commodity prices and production. Rising commodity prices cause consumers to cut back their use and producers to expand output. In the ensuing glut, prices fall and output falls until commodities are so cheap that their use rises again.\n\nCommunism\n\nA system, devised by Karl Marx, in which the state controls virtually all economic activity. Private property is outlawed and income inequality is reduced. The theory is idealistic; in practice, communist regimes have been highly authoritarian.\n\nComparative advantage\n\nThis idea has been called one of the most profound insights in economics. If country A can make cars more cheaply than country B, and B can produce shirts more cheaply than A, it clearly makes sense to trade. Each has an absolute advantage in one area. But what if A is more efficient at producing everything than B? It still makes sense for them to trade, with B producing the goods where it is more competitive; if for example it is 90% as efficient as A in making shirts, and only 60% in car manufacturing, then it should specialise in making shirts and trade them for cars. Both countries will gain.\n\nCompetition\n\nA concept at the heart of economics. Firms compete to sell the best goods and services to consumers, and to attract the best workers. The aim is to allocate resources in the most efficient manner.\n\nConglomerate\n\nA large company that has diversified across a range of countries and business areas, normally through making acquisitions.\n\nConsumer confidence\n\nA measure, taken from a survey, of the publicâs attitude towards the economic outlook. If people are worried about their jobs, or political unrest, or a pandemic, they will be less likely to spend money.\n\nConsumer prices index\n\nA measure of the cost of a âtypicalâ assortment of goods and services, used to calculate the rate of inflation. Statisticians first calculate the composition of the basket of goods and services bought by the average consumer: eg, bread, petrol and electrical goods. They then compare the cost of those goods in one period with that in another, weighting the goods and services to reflect the amount the average consumer spends. The change in this consumer prices index over the period (eg, a year) is the inflation rate. For more detail, read our explainer.\n\nConsumption\n\nThe spending of money on goods and services by households. Consumers can either spend their income, or save it. When consumers are cautious, they spend less and save more. This can have adverse economic effects as consumption is usually the largest component of aggregate demand, ahead of public spending and investment.\n\nContango\n\nWhen the futures price of a commodity is higher than the spot price. See also backwardation.\n\nCost-benefit analysis\n\nA process of assessing the feasibility and profitability of a public-sector project or business decision. As the name suggests, all the potential costs are compared with the potential revenues and other benefits. Although the idea is sound, the estimates are subject to a lot of uncertainty. Building projects are notorious for running over time and over budget. Quantifying non-monetary factors (eg, the value of life or the environment) is difficultâand controversial: see this Explainer and this article.\n\nCoupon\n\nTerm given to the interest rate on a bond, which stems from a time when physical coupons were attached to bond certificates. On a fixed-rate bond, the coupon does not change but the price of the bond does; the yield of the bond is determined by the relationship between the coupon and the price, plus any capital gain or loss that would result in holding the bond until it matures.\n\nCrawling peg\n\nAn exchange-rate system in which a currency is tied to another, but can fluctuate within a range, or band, depending on certain conditions. See also currency peg and fixed exchange rate.\n\nCreative destruction\n\nA concept, developed by Joseph Schumpeter, to explain economic innovation. Old inefficient companies must go out of business to release capital and workers so they can be used in new, more innovative ways.\n\nCredit\n\nA catch-all term for the extension of loans to individuals, companies or organisations. The term is also used more generally to refer to the total amount of debt in an economy, as in credit crunch and credit expansion. More narrowly, a credit is a sum added to a bank account, as opposed to a debit.\n\nCredit crunch\n\nA sudden reduction in the willingness of banks and others to lend money. This usually has adverse economic consequences.\n\nCredit default swap\n\nA derivative contract between two parties in which one insures the other against the default of a bond or loan. One of the products at the heart of the 2007-09 financial crisis. See also swaps.\n\nCredit expansion\n\nAn increase in the willingness of banks and others to lend money. This normally happens in the course of an economic boom. If credit expands too fast, this can be a sign of excessive speculation, often in the property market.\n\nCredit ratings\n\nSee ratings\n\nCreditor\n\nA person or institution that is owed money.\n\nCrony capitalism\n\nAn economic system in which businesses thrive because of their connections with political leaders rather than prowess in a competitive market. The Economist devised a crony-capitalism index, ranking several big economies, in 2014 (see article). See also rent-seeking.\n\nCrowding out\n\nThe notion that actions by the state might restrict the options of the private sector. It usually applies to credit. If the government borrows a lot, and pushes up interest rates, then investors may not have enough capital to supply the investment needs of businesses.\n\nCryptocurrency\n\nTokens created digitally and at the moment privately, although some central banks have created their own (see this article). Enthusiasts see the currencies as a way of avoiding fiat currency and hence the oversight of governments and banks; ownership and transfer are recorded in a distributed ledger, called the blockchain. The value of cryptocurrencies has been highly volatile, making it difficult for them to be either a store of value or medium of exchange, two essential functions of a conventional currency.\n\nCurrency\n\nThe monetary unit of a nation state, or group of states. Examples are the American dollar, the euro and the Japanese yen. In the modern era, most currencies are allowed to rise and fall in value against each other and are traded in the foreign exchange market.\n\nCurrency peg\n\nA system in which a national currency is fixed in relation to another currency (usually the US dollar). In the modern era, this tends to be done by a developing country with a history of inflation and currency depreciation; the peg is supposedly a way of imposing some discipline. Often, however, maintaining the peg leads to pain in the form of high interest rates and recession, so the link is abandoned. (See also: fixed exchange rate.)\n\nCurrent account\n\nThis measures all the non-financial transactions between a country and the rest of the worldâchiefly its imports and exports of goods and servicesâand transfers such as remittances and financial aid. Since the balance of payments must balance, a current account deficit necessitates a capital account surplus (an inflow of money) to balance it.\n\nD\n\nDebt\n\nMoney borrowed from someone else, whether a bank, a company or a person.\n\nDefault\n\nWhen a borrower fails to repay a debt. Widespread defaults are problematic since they can lead to a collapse in the banking system.\n\nDeflation\n\nFalling prices across an entire economy. Deflationary years were quite common under the gold standard when prices were stable over the long run, with some up and some down years. But deflation tends to be a problem in the modern era since it tends to be associated with falling nominal incomes. Since debt repayments are fixed in nominal terms, deflation often leads to a crisis as debtors struggle to repay their loans. Not to be confused with disinflation. For more, see this Explainer.\n\nDemand\n\nSee aggregate demand.\n\nDemographics\n\nCharacteristics of a population, such as size or composition by age. Demographics and demographic change can have an effect on economic growth; if there are more people of working age, growth is likely to be stronger.\n\nDependency ratio\n\nThe proportion of the population that is not of working age, compared with that which could work, if it chose to. Conventionally, dependants are defined as those aged up to 14 or over 65. Sometimes the figures are separated into youth dependency and old-age dependency. The higher the ratio, the greater the tax burden that is likely to fall on the working population; this is a problem for many developed economies, given the numbers now surviving into old age. See also economically inactive.\n\nDeposit insurance\n\nA scheme whereby a government agrees to compensate depositors if a bank goes bust. This can help prevent bank runs, when depositors panic.\n\nDepreciation\n\nIn the foreign exchange markets, this means a decline in the value of a currency; eg, âthe pound depreciated by 10% against the dollarâ. (See also devaluation.) In accounting, this relates to the gradual decline in the value of an asset, due to wear and tear. Companies depreciate their assets over their lifetime; this will show up as a deduction on the income account and a reduction in the value of assets on the balance-sheet.\n\nDepression\n\nA prolonged and sharp fall in economic output, associated with a high level of unemployment. The Great Depression of the 1930s is the most notable example.\n\nDeregulation\n\nIt is a staple of conservative thought that there are too many regulations which hold back economic growth. So every few years, governments announce a policy of deregulation to cut back the red tape. It turns out, however, that public opinion often demands that governments act to ban things that are bad, or that are disliked. And so more regulations are introduced.\n\nDerivatives\n\nFinancial assets whose value âderivesâ from something else, such as a stockmarket index or a commodity price. Examples include futures, options and swaps. Derivatives are often used to insure against a sudden change in the value of a key variable, such as a sharp rise in the oil price. But they can also be used to speculate on price movements which is why Warren Buffett, a veteran investor, described them as âfinancial weapons of mass destructionâ.\n\nDevaluation\n\nA formal reduction in the value of a currency. This occurs when a country has a fixed exchange rate and decides to alter the rate; for example, sterling was devalued in 1949 and 1967. Depreciation, in contrast, is a day-to-day currency decline.\n\nDeveloped countries\n\nA term used for nations where incomes per person are high, relative to the global average. These countries tended to industrialise early and are mainly based in Europe, and in former European settler colonies in North America and Australasia. Many Asian nations such as Japan and South Korea are also classified as developed. For more, see this article.\n\nDeveloping countries\n\nA term used to describe countries where income per person is lower than in âdeveloped nationsâ. These countries will usually have industrialised later than those in Europe or America. There is no official designation of developing countries and the World Bank uses the terms âlower-middleâ and âlow-incomeâ.\n\nDiminishing returns\n\nProduction involves certain inputs; labour, machinery, raw materials. At first, adding more inputs will improve productivity substantially; using fertilisers on crops for example or adding waiters in a restaurant to serve more diners. But eventually the marginal gains from adding more inputs will reduce; the waiters will have fewer people to serve. This is the law of diminishing returns,\n\nDirect taxes\n\nTaxes collected directly by the government. Examples include income tax and corporate profits tax. See also indirect taxation.\n\nDiscount rate\n\nThe rate the Federal Reserve charges for lending to commercial banks (like the bank rate in Britain). In addition, a discount rate is used by any investor or company trying to calculate the present value of a series of future cashflows. Since money in the future is worth less than money today, these cashflows must be reduced or discounted. The chosen discount rate, usually related to current interest rates or bond yields, can make a big difference to the net present value. For more, see this article. See also time value of money.\n\nDiscouraged workers\n\nSee economically inactive.\n\nDisinflation\n\nA situation where prices across the economy are rising, but more slowly than beforeâeg, a fall in the annual inflation rate from 10% to 5%. Not to be confused with deflation.\n\nDisintermediation\n\nCutting out the middleman, or connecting customers directly with producers. In theory, this should reduce costs. In practice, middlemen emerge in a new form; high-street travel agents may have declined in importance but many people use online versions such as Expedia or Booking.com\n\nDiversification\n\nThe practice of spreading oneâs interests widely. In investment, diversification is considered best practice: a big pension fund will own shares in a wide range of companies, across many nations, and will own bonds and property as well. Companies will also diversify across nations. Diversifying across business activities to form a conglomerate is more controversial; many commentators think that focusing on a small range of activities is more efficient.\n\nDividend\n\nA regular payment made by a company to its shareholders. The payment comes from a companyâs profits. Normally companies try to increase dividends over time; when they cut the dividend, this is a sign of trouble.\n\nDividend discount model\n\nA way of valuing shares, based on the future stream of dividends that an investor will receive, discounted to allow for the time value of money.\n\nDivision of labour\n\nOne of the fundamental principles of economics, described by Adam Smith in âThe Wealth of Nationsâ. Work can be undertaken more efficiently if broken up into discrete tasks. It is also more efficient for individuals to focus on their own jobs and use their wages to purchase goods and services, rather than attempt to grow their own food or make their own electrical devices. See also specialisation.\n\nDumping\n\nSelling something for less than the cost of producing it. This practice may be adopted by a dominant supplier in an industry in the hope of driving competitors out of business. More commonly, countries argue that producers in other nations are âdumpingâ goods and gaining market share; this can be used as an excuse to adopt protectionist measures such as tariffs.\n\nDuopoly\n\nA situation where two producers control a market. See also monopoly, oligopoly and cartel.\n\nE\n\nEconometrics\n\nThe use of statistical analysis to quantify economic relationships.\n\nEconomic rent\n\nThe extra income that accrues to the owner of a limited asset or resource. So a skilled worker may be able to earn far more than the lowest wage he or she would be willing to accept; a landlord may earn higher rent on a property if the local authority builds a railway station nearby.\n\nEconomically inactive\n\nA term generally used to cover people of working age (generally 15 to 64 years old) who are not seeking a job, nor in full-time education. This includes people who are caring for relatives, those who are too sick to work, those who have retired before the state pension age and âdiscouraged workersâ who have given up trying for a job. See also voluntary unemployment.\n\nEconomies of scale\n\nThe owner of a firm needs to buy machinery, rent property, and so on. Some of these costs are fixed. As the firm produces more, these costs are spread over more units; the average cost of production falls. These economies of scale mean that mass production tends to result in cheaper goods.\n\nEfficient market hypothesis\n\nThe theory that market prices reflect all public information. Trading, or investing, on the basis of that information will thus not offer any advantage. The hypothesis explains why so many fund managers fail to beat the market, after costs, and has led to the popularity of low-cost index funds, which simply buy all the securities in the index. For more, see this article.\n\nElasticity\n\nA measure of the responsiveness of one variable to changes in another. For example, if a good rises in price by 10%, then demand could fall by less than 10% (price inelasticity) or more than 10% (price elasticity). Essential goods like food and fuel tend to be price inelastic.\n\nEmerging markets\n\nA term, largely used in investment circles, for developing countries. Investors might put their capital into emerging markets because they believe the growth prospects for such countries (and thus the returns on equities) will be higher. But emerging markets tend to be risky, and can suffer from capital flight when investors become risk-averse.\n\nEndogenous growth theory\n\nA hypothesis, put forward by Paul Romer, that economic growth does not simply arise from exogenous factors (such as the creative insights of inventors) but also from government policies, such as investment in research and development and laws that protect intellectual property. Gordon Brown, Britainâs former prime minister, was mocked for referring to âpost-neoclassical endogenous growth theoryâ in a speech. Mr Romerâs work earned a Nobel prize, but economists still donât fully understand how and why economies grow.\n\nEndowment effect\n\nA psychological bias that causes people to be more willing to retain an object than acquire the same object if they donât own it. Put another way, they value an object they won more highly than the market value. This may explain behaviour that is not ârationalâ in economic terms. See behavioural economics.\n\nEntrepreneur\n\nIndividual who puts together the factors of production (labour, machinery, business) to found a new business. Entrepreneurs tend to be much praised as risk-takers who boost economic growth.\n\nEquilibrium\n\nOne of the commonest concepts in economics. At its simplest, equilibrium means a balance between the supply of and demand for a good at a market-clearing price. But economists also study equilibria across the entire economy (âgeneral equilibriumâ) or in which markets do not clear (see involuntary unemployment). Unhelpfully, equilibria need not be stable (see the commodity cycle) or socially optimal. See also Nash equilibrium. Some economists think too much attention has been given to equilibrium: see this article.\n\nEquity\n\nLong-term capital raised from investors in the form of shares. The shareholders are the owners of the company and share in its assets and profits; to take over a company, a rival must make an offer that satisfies its shareholders. In normal circumstances, equity is never repaid (unlike debt). Shareholders have voting rights (over issues such as the appointment of directors) and will sometimes receive income in the form of dividends.\n\nESG investing\n\nThe initials stand for âenvironmentalâ, âsocialâ and âcorporate governanceâ. The amount of money devoted to ESG investing increased substantially in the second decade of the 21st century, and is linked more broadly to belief in stakeholder capitalism. Supporters said that companies which neglected these issues would eventually come a cropper in the face of regulation, consumer backlash or scandal; opponents argued that the criteria for ESG investing were often woolly and that companies simply paid lip service to the issues involved. For (much) more detail, read our Special Report.\n\nEuro zone\n\nThose countries within the European Union (20 at the time of writing) that have adopted the euro as their currency. In addition, six non-EU countries (Andorra, Kosovo, Monaco, Montenegro, San Marino and the Vatican City) use the currency. Monetary policy in the euro zone is set by the European Central Bank.\n\nEurobond\n\nA bond issued by a government or company in a foreign currency. The first eurobond raised $15m for Autostrade, operator of Italyâs motorway network, in 1963.\n\nEuropean Central Bank\n\nThe monetary authority for the euro zone. The bank is based in Frankfurt and describes its main task as to âmaintain price stabilityâ. It also supervises banks in the euro area. Its governing council comprises six members of the executive board plus the governors of the 19 central banks of euro zone countries.\n\nExchange rate\n\nThe rate at which one currency is exchanged for another. Generally, this is either a fixed exchange rate or a floating exchange rate although halfway houses (such as a crawling peg) have been attempted.\n\nExports\n\nGoods and services sold to foreign buyers. When a foreign tourist buys a meal in Spain, that counts as a Spanish export.\n\nExternality\n\nAn externality is a cost or benefit to a third party as a result of someone elseâs actions. Externalities lie outside the market system. Polluted air, caused by a chemical plantâs emissions, is a negative externality. A common textbook example of positive externalities involves beehives next door to an orchard: the nectar feeds the bees, which in turn pollinate the trees. See also Coase theorem, free rider, Pigouvian taxes and public goods.\n\nF\n\nFactors of production\n\nThe ingredients necessary for economic activity: land, labour, capital and entrepreneurship, which is needed to bring the other three elements together.\n\nFair trade\n\nAn approach which argues that consumers should not simply focus on the cost of the goods they buy but on the working conditions and wages of the workers that supply them. Various schemes offer to certify that a product (such as coffee) has been made in a fair-trade fashion.\n\nFat tails\n\nA situation when more extreme events occur more frequently than in a normal distribution. In 2007, during the financial crisis, David Viniar, the chief financial officer of Goldman Sachs, said the firm had experienced â25 standard deviation events, several days in a rowâ. This was a sign that the firmâs models were wrong, as they had not anticipated fat tails.\n\nFederal Reserve System\n\nThe most powerful actor in the global financial system. Set up in 1913, Americaâs central bank actually divides the country into 12 Reserve districts, each with its own regional Federal Reserve bank. These are overseen by the Federal Reserve Board, consisting of seven governors based in Washington, DC. The key decisions on monetary policy are made by the Federal Open Market Committee or FOMC. For more detail, see this Explainer.\n\nFiat currency\n\nA currency declared to be legal tender in a country by a government. Such a currency is not backed by gold or another asset; the government simply issues an order (or fiat) that it is legal tender, and can insist it be used to pay taxes. Most countries have fiat currencies and they achieve widespread acceptance as a medium of exchange because of their convenience.\n\nFinancial markets\n\nThe places where money is invested, in the form of short-term loans, bonds, equities and derivatives. Often anthropomorphised in the media (eg, âThe markets were unhappy with the governmentâs budget plansâ).\n\nFirst mover advantage\n\nThe benefit that can, but does not always, accrue to the first company to introduce a product, or an innovation. Consumers may come to associate the product with the company name and other firms may be discouraged from entering the market. More broadly, first mover advantage can apply in any adversarial game: see game theory.\n\nFiscal drag\n\nA way in which inflation can boost tax revenues. In most tax systems, workers must earn a certain amount before they pay income tax, or pay it a higher rate. If those allowances are not uprated every year in line with inflation, workers end up paying more in tax in real terms when their wages rise.\n\nFiscal policy\n\nDecisions relating to the amount a government raises in taxes and spends on public services. Fiscal tightening means the government is raising taxes, or cutting spending (or both) and thus taking demand out of the economy. Fiscal easing means the government is lowering taxes, or raising spending (or both) and thus adding demand. A fiscally neutral budget would neither add nor subtract demand by, say, raising taxes and spending by the same amount.\n\nFixed costs\n\nCosts of production that do not change when output changes, for example the rent paid on a factory. See also variable costs.\n\nFixed exchange rate\n\nWhen the value of one currency is tied to that of another or (in the past) to gold. Fixed exchange rates were common until the 1970s as they offered certainties; importers knew the cost of goods bought from abroad; exporters knew the value of the revenues they would receive for selling goods to foreigners. But they proved difficult to maintain as capital flowed more freely across national boundaries. Before the creation of the euro zone its founding members maintained fixed exchange rates with one another. See also floating exchange rate and gold standard.\n\nFixed rate\n\nWhen the interest rate on a bond, or other financial instrument, is invariable.\n\nFloating exchange rate\n\nWhen a currencyâs value moves freely against that of other countries. Floating rates have been widespread since the 1970s after the weakening of capital controls. In theory, the exchange rate bears the burden of economic adjustment; a currency with a trade deficit can let its currency decline in order to make its goods more competitive, rather than slash workersâ wages.\n\nFloating rate note\n\nFinancial instrument where the interest rate varies over time according to a set formula.\n\nFlotation\n\nThe term used when a company lists its shares on a stock market for the first time. This is also known as an initial public offering, or IPO.\n\nForeign direct investment (FDI )\n\nWhen a foreign investor sets up a new operation in a country, or buys an existing business. FDI is distinct from portfolio investment, the purchase of a small stake in a business by a pension fund or sovereign wealth fund. FDI can boost productivity, by bringing new technology and upgrading the skills of domestic workers. It expanded rapidly at the end of the 20th century. But governments can be suspicious if a foreign company takes over an industry in an area (like technology or defence) which is perceived to be strategically important.\n\nForeign exchange market\n\nThe forum where currencies are traded. Often abbreviated to FX or forex.\n\nForeign exchange reserves\n\nAssets, normally held by a central bank, that can be used in a financial crisis or to influence the countryâs exchange rate. Central banks tend to hold their reserves in major currencies like the dollar or euro, as well as gold. Reserves were vital under the gold standard and other fixed exchange rate systems, since the central bank could sell the reserves and buy the domestic currency to support its price. In the modern era, the scale of daily currency trading is so great that it is hard for any country to hold enough reserves to combat the markets.\n\nForward exchange rate\n\nA rate agreed between two parties for trading currencies in a few monthsâ or a yearâs time. The difference between the forward rate and the spot rate is driven by the interest rate differentials between the two countries concerned.\n\nForward rate agreement\n\nContract between two parties that determines the rate of interest to be paid in the future. May be used by borrowers to fix their interest costs in advance.\n\nFraming\n\nIn behavioural economics, the idea that how a proposition is framed can affect the reaction of individuals. So expressing the cost of an annual subscription at $72 a year will attract fewer customers than describing it as $6 a month.\n\nFree rider\n\nA free rider benefits from a good or service without paying the full price, or anything at all. The term derives from those who ride on a bus or train without paying. More generally, free-rider problems relate to positive externalities, especially those associated with public goods such as clean air or water. See also tragedy of the commons.\n\nFree trade\n\nThe cause that led to the founding of The Economist in 1843. Free-trade enthusiasts believe that the unfettered international exchange of goods and services leads to more efficient economies (see comparative advantage) and thus, in the long run, greater prosperity for all: see this Explainer. Opponents argue that workers in domestic industries lose their jobs when exposed to international trade, and this leads many governments to adopt tariffs and protectionist policies.\n\nFree trade area\n\nRegion which has dropped tariffs, quotas and other controls on imports and exports. The best-known examples are the European Union, which also embodies much deeper economic integration, and NAFTA (now the USMCA).\n\nFree-market economists\n\nThose who believe that the market is better at allocating resources than governments and that excessive regulation and high public spending tend to diminish growth in the long run. See also Austrian school, Chicago school, laissez-faire and neoliberalism.\n\nFrictional unemployment\n\nThe joblessness that results from people quitting their jobs in search of better opportunities or that occurs as struggling firms shed labour and rising firms hunt for new workers. For more detail, read this Explainer.\n\nFull employment\n\nWhen everyone who wants a job at prevailing wages can find one. Zero unemployment is not possible since companies go bust, or shed labour, and it can take time for workers to find a new job (see frictional unemployment). Central banks and governments may aim to achieve full employment but it is hard to define the rate (2%? 3%?) at which it is achieved. See also the Nairu and this Explainer.\n\nFuture\n\nA contract, traded on an exchange, to trade a commodity, or a financial instrument, at a future date. Futures can be used to hedge against a price change (for example, a farmer might sell his crop in advance) or to speculate on a future price change.\n\nG\n\nGame theory\n\nA technique for analysing how people, firms and governments behave in situations they must take into account what others are likely to do and might respond to what they do. For instance, competition among firms can be analysed as a game in which they strive for long-term advantage; game theory has also been applied to nuclear deterrence (see this article). See also Nash equilibrium; and for more detail, read our Schools Brief.\n\nGDP\n\nSee Gross Domestic Product.\n\nGearing\n\nSee leverage.\n\nGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade\n\nThe General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade or GATT was signed in 1947 and aimed to eliminate the protectionism that had dogged the global economy in the 1930s. It was followed by several rounds of negotiations which gradually reduced trade barriers and was eventually superseded in the 1990s by the World Trade Organisation or WTO.\n\nGiffen goods\n\nA basic product for which the normal relationship between supply and demand does not apply: when the price goes up, so does demand because the hit to real incomes from the higher price causes more expensive products to be shunned. Very few examples have been observed in practice, although staple products such as bread and rice can occasionally have Giffen characteristics. See also Veblen goods.\n\nGig economy\n\nA term given to workers whose jobs are part-time or temporary, and who thus lack job security. Many work for the new wave of platform companies that have emerged in the 21st century such as Uber, a ride-sharing company, or Deliveroo, a food-delivery group. As contractors, gig-economy workers have few rights such as holiday pay or pensions, although courts have ruled that some must be treated as conventional employees. See also precariat.\n\nGilts\n\nBonds issued by the British government. At one stage, the debt certificates had a gilt edge but the term âgilt-edgedâ came to refer to the quality of the governmentâs credit: investors could be assured of repayment.\n\nGini coefficient\n\nAn indicator designed to measure inequality of income and wealth. It ranges from zero, which indicates perfect equality, with every household earning or owning exactly the same, to one, which implies absolute inequality, with a single household earning a country's entire income or owning all its wealth. African countries tend to have high Gini coefficients; European countries tend to have low ones. Among rich countries, America has a relatively high coefficient (see this article for more detail). Despite being a notionally communist country, China has a higher coefficient than many rich countries (for more, read this article).\n\nGlobalisation\n\nThe tendency for national economies to become integrated with each other, through the movement of goods and services, capital and people. The first modern wave of globalisation in the late 19th century was brought to an end by the first world war. A second stage emerged during the late 20th century as China, and the ex-communist countries of eastern Europe, joined the global trading system.\n\nGold\n\nPrecious metal that was once a central part of the global monetary system (see gold standard). Central banks still hold gold as part of their reserves. Some see the metal, which is limited in supply, as a hedge against inflation, although its record in that respect is patchy.\n\nGold standard\n\nInternational system, used in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, that linked the amount of domestic currency in circulation (and the exchange rate) to a countryâs gold reserves. Since these reserves grew slowly, so did the money supply and there was little long-term inflation. This protected the interests of creditors but it meant that any competitive adjustment in the economy involved painful deflation. As a result, the world abandoned the standard in the Great Depression of the 1930s.\n\nGovernment bonds\n\nDebt issued by governments is often the most important instrument in a countryâs financial markets. Because most governments can be relied upon to repay the debt, it is regarded as a risk-free asset and is a core part of the portfolios of insurance companies and pension funds. The government bond yield also drives the cost of borrowing for companies, which will usually pay a higher yield because of the greater risk of default.\n\nGravity model of trade\n\nThe theory that the intensity of trade between two countries is dependent on two factors; their economic size and their distance from one another. In 2021 Americaâs top three trading partners were Canada and Mexico (its nearest neighbours) and China (the worldâs second-largest economy).\n\nGreat Compression\n\nA period from in the mid-20th century when income differentials narrowed in the face of the growth of the welfare state and high rates of marginal taxation.\n\nGreat Depression\n\nThe era in the 1930s when economic output and volumes of international trade collapsed. The depression was a challenge to classical economics which held that market forces would eventually bring the economy back to growth and eventually led to the adoption of Keynesian economics after the second world war.\n\nGreat Moderation\n\nA period from the mid-1980s to 2007 when recessions in the developed world were rare, inflation was mostly low, interest rates steadily fell and asset markets soared. Came to a halt with the financial crisis of 2007, in what could be described as a Minsky moment.\n\nGreshamâs Law\n\nThe idea that bad money drives out good. Suppose that some coins in circulation are pure gold, and others are only 90% metal but both have the same par value (eg, a dollar or a pound). Traders will keep the pure coins for themselves and hand over the debased coinage. Eventually only the debased coins will be in circulation.\n\nGross domestic product (GDP )\n\nThe main measure of an economyâs size. GDP is calculated from the market value of all the finished goods and services within a countryâs borders over a set period of time. It has its critics; if a vandal breaks a window, the cost of its repair is an addition to GDP even though human welfare has hardly improved. (For more detail, see this Explainer.) It is also hard to calculate and initial GDP figures are often revised later.\n\nGross national product (GNP )\n\nAn alternative to GDP, GNP is the value of all goods and services produced by citizens of a country, both domestically and internationally. Income earned by foreign residents is deducted. The difference can sometimes be dramatic. Thanks to Irelandâs low corporate-tax rate, so many multinationals are based in the country that its GDP is much higher than its GNP.\n\nH\n\nHaircut\n\nWhen financial institutions like banks borrow money, creditors often ask for collateral to protect themselves against default (just as homeowners use their houses as security for a mortgage). Often this collateral will be in the form of financial securities, such as bonds. The creditors face the risk that the collateral might fall in value at the very time the borrower defaults. So they will not accept the collateral at its value, but will apply a discount, or haircut (for example, securities with a market value of $100m would only count as collateral of $90m). The more risky the securities, the greater the haircut.\n\nHedge funds\n\nInvestment vehicles that attract money from institutions (such as endowments and pension funds) and from wealthy individuals. They follow a wide range of strategies, often using leverage and going short (betting on falling prices). As well as an annual management fee, they charge a performance fee; individual hedge-fund managers can become very wealthy themselves. For more, see this Explainer.\n\nHedging\n\nThis occurs when individuals, companies and institutions try to protect themselves against adverse market movements, such as changes in commodity prices, currencies or interest rates. See also insurance.\n\nHedonic adjustment\n\nThe change made to recorded inflation rates to reflect improvements in the quality of goods, such as personal computers.\n\nHot money\n\nShort-term capital that flows into a country in search of quick returns. Hot money tends to flow through the banks, leading to a lending spree that causes speculation in the property market. It also drives up the countryâs currency, making life more difficult for its exports. When sentiment turns, hot money flows out, causing the currency to slump, bursting any speculative bubbles and leading to a banking crisis. Nations prefer to rely on foreign direct investment, which is more permanent.\n\nHuman capital\n\nThe skills and brainpower of workers. Improving human capital through training and education is often seen as a way of improving productivity, although the effectiveness of such programmes can be hard to measure. For more detail, read our Explainer and Schools Brief.\n\nHybrid working\n\nA term that emerged during the pandemic to describe employees who work part of the time in the office and part of the time at home. This appeals to many workers, as it reduces commuting time, while also being acceptable to companies, since employees still come in to attend meetings and interact with their managers and colleagues. For more, see this article.\n\nHyperinflation\n\nWhen inflation gets out of controlâas happened, for example, in Germany in 1923. A loaf of bread cost 200bn marks in November 1923 and workers were paid twice a day because their wages fell in value during the day. Such high rates of inflation are fuelled by rapid expansion of the money supply. To learn more, read this Explainer and this article.\n\nHypothecated taxes\n\nThe earmarking of tax revenues for a specific purpose, such as road-building or the health service. Hypothecation can be a way of making tax rises more politically acceptable but governments often find a way of diverting the revenues to other departments.\n\nHysteresis\n\nA term borrowed from physics, where it refers to a lagged effect. In economics, it is used to describe persistent phenomena, such as the continuation of high levels of unemployment, even when an economy has recovered; workers may have lost enthusiasm or seen their skills decline. For more, read this Explainer.\n\nI\n\nIlliquid assets\n\nAssets that cannot readily be tuned into cash or can only be sold quickly at a substantial discount. Illiquid assets are often the cause of financial crises when entities like banks have a mismatch between their liabilities (customersâ deposits, which can be instantly withdrawn) and their assets (long-term loans, which are illiquid). Illiquid assets will often offer a higher return because of their greater risk.\n\nImports\n\nGoods and services acquired from outside the country. When a German tourist buys a meal in Spain, that counts as a German import.\n\nIncome\n\nThe (fairly regular) flow of money to the factors of production. Labour receives wages; land receives rent; capital receives profits, interest and dividends.\n\nIncome tax\n\nOne of the most reliable ways of raising revenue for governments. In many systems, income tax is deducted by the employer before workers receive their pay. Most governments donât levy tax until individual incomes have reached a minimum level and tax higher incomes at higher rates. See also: progressive taxation.\n\nIndexation\n\nThis term is most commonly used to describe the linking of a variable to the inflation rate. Some governments link benefits to inflation, and others link prices such as rail fares to the same measure. Several governments have issued government bonds of which the coupon and repayment value rise in line with inflation; these are known as index-linked bonds. Indexation also refers to a field of fund management that attempts to replicate the performance of a stock-market index; see passive management.\n\nIndirect taxation\n\nTax collected by an entity other than the government. Examples include sales tax (collected by retailers), levies on alcohol and tobacco, and taxes on tourism (collected by hotels and airlines). Governments can favour these as a way of increasing revenues without changing the headline rate of direct taxes like income tax.\n\nIndustrial policy\n\nThe promotion of what a government considers to be strategic industries, often using an âinfant industryâ justification (see article). The disruption of supply chains during and after the covid-19 pandemic, concerns about the rise of Chinese economic power, and the Russian invasion of Ukraine have given industrial policy a new lease of life in the West. The widespread adoption of subsidies, tariffs and other measures to promote favoured industries raises the danger of renewed protectionism (see article).\n\nInequality\n\nA subject of perennial debate among economists is how much inequality is ânormalâ and which changes in economic policy are likely to decrease or increase it? Inequality is often measured by the Gini coefficient but other gauges include the share of income and wealth taken by the top 1% or 10% of the population. One hypothesis, the Kuznets curve, suggested that industrialisation initially increases inequality, then decreases it. This seemed plausible during the Great Compression from 1940 to 1980 but inequality in the developed world has increased since then. This Briefing explores a debate among economists about whether inequality is increasing and this Explainer examines the relationship between inequality and economic growth.\n\nInfant industry\n\nA young sector that a government nurtures with protection from foreign competition, in the form of tariffs, subsidies and other barriers. Usually associated with developing economies hoping to kickstart industrialisation and accelerate economic growthâbut developed economies also resort to the infant-industry argument for protectionism (see article).\n\nInflation\n\nA general rise in the price level. This is normally calculated by comparing the price of a basket of goods (measured by a consumer price index) at different times, and can be used as a measure of the cost of living. But consumers can substitute cheaper products for more expensive ones (eg, chicken for beef) and a hedonic adjustment needs to be made to reflect the improved quality of goods. Central banks often have a mandate to control inflation and may look at a wide range of gauges to understand the underlying trend; for example, measures of âcoreâ inflation that exclude volatile items such as food and energy. In this article, we ask whether inflation really matters.\n\nInflation targeting\n\nIn the modern era, governments in many countries have asked central banks to target a specific rate of, or range for, inflation and given them independence from political control of their operations. Inflation-targeting central banks have used various tools of monetary policy, such as changes in interest rates or quantitative easing. This article looks at the question of whether central banksâ inflation targets should be raised and this one at central banksâ independence.\n\nInformal economy\n\nActivities that have economic value but are not registered with the countryâs authorities; this may include teenagers who babysit for neighbours, hawkers who sell tourist souvenirs in big cities and ticket touts. The International Labour Organisation has estimated that 2bn people may have occasional involvement in the informal economy.\n\nInfrastructure\n\nThe plumbing of the economy. Roads, railways, airports and container ports are all vital for an economyâs operation. But they take up a lot of land and can have negative externalities, such as noise. Democracies can thus struggle to build infrastructure as quickly as autocracies such as China, which faces no democratic constraints (see article). Some infrastructure is built privately but roads, in particular, suffer from the free rider problem and tend to be built by the public sector. For more, see this article.\n\nInheritance taxes\n\nLevies on the assets of those who die. In theory, this can help to ensure that societies stay meritocratic. But they tend to be unpopular with middle-class voters who hope to pass on their assets (usually in the form of houses) to their children. Governments also create exemptions to prevent small business and farms from being broken up on the ownerâs death. Accordingly, the OECD calculated in 2021 that only 0.5% of all government tax revenues came from this source, on average. See also wealth tax.\n\nInitial public offering (IPO )\n\nSee flotation.\n\nInnovation\n\nInnovation is a key element in improving productivity, which in turn is a big driver of economic growth. In the modern era, innovation tends to be associated with new gadgets and disruptive technology (see this Explainer) but it can be a new way of organising work, such as Henry Fordâs mass production line or the shift in agriculture from a two-field to a three-field rotation system, which increased yields substantially. Innovation can arise from the insight of entrepreneurs or from investment in research and development, which can be done by the government; the internet and the global positioning system were first developed by nation states.\n\nInsider trading\n\nThe use of non-public information to gain an advantage in financial markets. It is illegal in many countries because it discriminates against other investors and can cause confidence in the probity of financial markets to fall.\n\nInstitutional investors\n\nA catch-all term to describe some of the major investors in the financial markets: insurance companies, pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, charitable endowments and the like.\n\nInsurance\n\nThe act of protecting yourself against the financial impact of risk. Traditionally, insurance was developed to cover fire, the sinking or seizure of a ship, or the death of the family breadwinner. Insurance companies attempted to calculate the likelihood of such risks occurring and protected themselves by diversification. In the modern era, insurance is also widely used to protect, or hedge, against risks such as changes in market prices or interest rates. Sometimes the other side of the risk is assumed by speculators hoping to make a profit.\n\nIntangible asset\n\nSomething without physical form that can create value. Examples include patents and brand names. See also intellectual property. You can read more about intangible assets in this article.\n\nIntellectual property\n\nAn asset created solely by human intelligence and creativity. Examples include copyrights, patents and trademarks.\n\nInterest on reserves\n\nThe return paid by central banks on reserves held by commercial banks. These interest payments help to keep market interest rates at the desired level.\n\nInterest rates\n\nThe return for lending money, and the cost of borrowing it. The level of interest rates depends on the time value of money, the credit risk of the borrower, the level of inflation and other factors. Short-term rates are generally set by, or are closely linked to, the decisions of the countryâs central bank. Long-term interest rates, including long-term bond yields, are affected by the balance between the supply of savings and the demand for credit.\n\nInternal rate of return\n\nA measure used by businesses to calculate the profitability of a potential investment. Broadly speaking, the higher the internal rate of return the better. Businesses will usually set a minimum rate before commencing a project. See also rate of return.\n\nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF )\n\nOne of the institutions set up after the Bretton Woods agreement of 1944. Its initial aim was to help countries suffering balance-of-payments crises. It is the international body that countries turn to when in financial difficulties. Its advice has often been controversial because of the perception that it imposes austerity on workers in order to benefit rich creditors. Its prescriptions in times of crisis, which include deregulation, privatisation and openness to international trade, have been dubbed the âWashington consensusâ after the city where the IMF has its headquarters.\n\nInternet\n\nThe internet, a system which connects electronic devices such as personal computers, has clearly transformed the global economy, changing the way many people work, communicate and shop. However, its rise has coincided with a slowdown in productivity growth in the developed world. Economists debate whether this is related to measurement issues or whether the internet is a less transforming technology than previous breakthroughs such as electrification and the internal combustion engine.\n\nInvestment\n\nThis term is used in two linked ways, both referring to putting money to work, usually for the long term. Business investment occurs when companies buy new machines, or build new factories, or conduct research and development, with the aim of increasing profits. Portfolio investment occurs when individuals or institutions put money into long-term assets such as bonds, equities and property.\n\nInvestment banks\n\nInstitutions that make their money from advising corporate clients, and from trading assets, rather than from taking in deposits and making loans (like a commercial bank). Americaâs Glass-Steagall act of 1933, a response to the Great Depression, drew a rigid distinction between commercial and investment banks, but now the two are often combined.\n\nInvestment management\n\nA sector that focuses on managing the money of others. Most charge an annual fee but some also add a performance fee. See also active management, passive management, hedge funds, pension funds and private equity.\n\nInvisible hand\n\nA metaphor used by Adam Smith to describe how an individual may be âled by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intentionâ. This has been interpreted in the modern era to suggest that individuals who act in their own self-interest may end up promoting the good of society as a whole.\n\nInvisible trade\n\nTrade in non-physical things, particularly services such as banking and insurance.\n\nInvoluntary unemployment\n\nThe unemployment that results when not everyone who is willing to work at the prevailing wage can find a job. Causes can include a shortfall in aggregate demand or some rigidity in the labour market. A central idea in Keynesian economics. For more, see this Explainer.\n\nJ\n\nJ-curve\n\nThis describes the normal pattern of a countryâs balance of payments after the devaluation or sharp depreciation of its currency. Initially imports are more expensive and exports are cheaper, so the balance deteriorates (the deficit widens). Eventually, foreigners buy more of the countryâs exports while domestic consumers buy fewer imports and the balance improves.\n\nJob vacancies\n\nA measure of slack in the labour market. In an expansionary phase, job vacancies will increase, and this may lead to upward pressure on wages. In a contractionary phase, vacancies will contract. See also quit rate.\n\nJoint supply\n\nWhen the process of producing one product leads to the production of another. For example, the distillation of crude oil yields gasoline, kerosene, asphalt and more.\n\nJunk bonds\n\nBonds that are deemed to be highly risky where the borrower might stop paying interest or default on repayment altogether. They offer a high yield as compensation for that risk. See ratings.\n\nJust-in-time manufacturing\n\nA process that aims to keep down costs and reduce waste by producing items only when ordered (rather than in advance) and by keeping inventory levels down. The risk of the approach is that companies can be caught out by disruptions in their supply chain, caused for example by natural disasters or the covid-19 pandemic. See also lean manufacturing.\n\nK\n\nKeynesian economics\n\nJohn Maynard Keynes, a British academic and government official, changed the field of economics. Under classical economics, governments did little to manage the economic cycle, which they believed would right itself. But Keynes argued, in the face of the Great Depression, that a recession could dent the âanimal spiritsâ of businesspeople and discourage consumers from spending. Governments, rather than balance their budgets, could borrow to spend money and this spending would revive demand. After 1945, many governments adopted a Keynesian approach and used fiscal policy to manage the economic cycle.\n\nKnightian uncertainty\n\nA concept, developed by Frank Knight, an American economist and a founder of the Chicago School of economicsâto describe the problem faced by economic actors who are unable to quantify risk, because there is not enough information to assess the probability of the various potential outcomes. The probability distribution is only clear in a very limited set of circumstances; betting on a number in the game of roulette, for example.\n\nL\n\nLabour\n\nA term used for both a factor for production and for the organised representatives of the working classes (trade unions and some political parties). The supply of labour is an important determinant of economic growth, and the shrinking of the working-age population in developed countriesâand Chinaâmay be a limiting factor on growth in coming decades. Improving the skills of the workforce and enticing reluctant workers back into jobs may be vital.\n\nLabour market flexibility\n\nMaking it easier to hire and fire workers. Those in favour of flexibility argue that giving workers too much job security discourages employers from taking on new labour, and results in a âtwo tierâ market, comprising secure workers and a large number of long-term unemployed. Flexibility also helps with the process of creative destruction, allowing workers to move from old, unproductive industries to new, innovative ones. Opponents argue flexibility leads to a precariat of insecure, low-paid employees.\n\nLabour theory of value\n\nThe idea, mentioned by Adam Smith and championed by Karl Marx, that the value of a good depends on the labour put into it. The problem is that the value of a good is also dependent on demand; someone might put an enormous amount of effort into assembling a model of the Eiffel Tower from old pencils, but it will have little market value if no one wants to buy it.\n\nLaffer curve\n\nNamed after Arthur Laffer, an American economist, this curve shows tax revenues increasing as tax rates rise from zero but starting to fall when tax rates reach a certain level, because high taxes discourage work and enterprise. The argument is often cited by conservative politicians in America and Britain, and is probably true in principle. But it is not clear where the bend in the curve occurs (see this article), and it may be at tax rates much higher than current levels.\n\nLagged effect\n\nThe time taken for economic policy changes to affect the economy. Changes in interest rates, for example, can take as much as 18 months to have their full impact, as rates may only change when loan terms are renegotiated. The danger is that, by the time the policy starts to work, economic circumstances have changed.\n\nLagging indicators\n\nEconomic data that are more important for revealing the economic past than pointing to the future. Gross domestic product numbers are released well after a quarter has ended (and are often revised later); unemployment tends to be slow in falling when an economy recovers. See also leading indicators and real-time indicators.\n\nLaissez-faire\n\nThis French term refers to the idea that governments should leave the economy alone as much as possible, and should allow free trade. Associated with the classical school of economics.\n\nLand\n\nOne of the factors of production. Land is in fairly fixed supply (a little can be reclaimed from the sea, and some is lost to coastal erosion and desertification). Before the industrial revolution, expansion in land use and changes in the productivity of agricultural land were among the most important drivers of growth. Today, planning restrictions may be an important restraint on productivity improvements. Taxes on land values are popular with economists but not politicians: this article explains why.\n\nLeading indicators\n\nEconomic data that are examined for clues to coming trends. Surveys of consumer confidence, for example, may provide a pointer to the outlook for retail sales; inflation in producer prices may herald changes in consumer inflation. Some view the stockmarket as a leading indicator of the economic outlook, although it is far from infallible. See also lagging indicators and real-time indicators.\n\nLean manufacturing\n\nA concept, associated with the Toyota motor company, associated with the elimination of waste and the continuous improvement (kaizen in Japanese) of the production process. See also justâin-time manufacturing.\n\nLemons\n\nAn example used by George Akerlof, an American economist (and winner of a Nobel prize) to explain why markets might not operate efficiently because of adverse selection. There is information asymmetry in the used-car market, he pointed out, as sellers know a lot more about the condition of the vehicle than buyers. Buyers will be suspicious of purchasing a dud car, or lemon, and will thus reduce the price they are willing to pay. If sellers are unwilling to agree, there may be no deal at all. For more detail, read our Schools Brief.\n\nLender of last resort\n\nA crucial role played by central banks during financial crises. There can be moments when depositors and creditors lose faith in the banking system, with the risk that the banks will collapse. By acting as lender of last resort to banks that would be solvent in the medium term, a central bank can reduce the economic damage.\n\nLeverage\n\nInvesting, or speculating, with borrowed money or by putting down only a small part of the purchase price. For example, a company may buy another using a small amount of its own cash, and a larger amount of debt in the form of bank loans or bonds; the greater the proportion of debt, the higher the leverage, or gearing. See leveraged buyout. Another use of leverage is to buy shares on margin; if the investor puts up just 10% of the cost, and the share price rises by 10%, they have doubled their money. But if the share price falls by 10%, their investment is wiped out. Perhaps the commonest instance of leverage is associated with buying houses: most people pay a small proportion of the price at first and borrow the balance. Financial crises often have excessive leverage at their heart.\n\nLeveraged buyout\n\nA corporate takeover, usually undertaken by a private equity group, using a lot of borrowed money. The aim is to cut costs and sell assets at the target company, thereby bringing down the debt, and making it possible for the private equity group to make a profit for its investors.\n\nLiabilities\n\nSomething owed to others, and the other side of the balance-sheet from assets. Often, this is in the form of money, such as a debt. But it could be a warranty to repair or replace a product that the company has sold or the legal costs involved in compensating customers for a defective product.\n\nLiberalisation\n\nIn economic terms, this usually refers to reducing the role of the government, and the restrictions on the private sector, by privatising business and cutting regulations. See also neoliberalism.\n\nLife-cycle hypothesis\n\nMost people see their incomes improve as their career progresses. But their need to spend is less variable than their incomes. So the life-cycle hypothesis, proposed by Franco Modigliani, an Italian-American economist and Nobel laureate, suggests that they will borrow to fund their spending (or to buy a house) at the start of their careers, save as they approach retirement and run down their savings after they stop working. See also permanent income hypothesis.\n\nLimited liability\n\nOne of the most important concepts in modern capitalism. Limited liability means that investors who own the equity of a company can only lose their initial stake if the business collapses; creditors cannot pursue their other assets, such as their homes. By limiting liabilities in this way, more entrepreneurs are willing to take the risk of setting up businesses, and more investors are willing to back them.\n\nLiquidity\n\nThe quality of being easily turned into cash. This can depend on the nature of the instrument; Treasury bills, short-term debt issued by the American government, are cash-like instruments. Or it can depend on the volume of trading in the market; government bonds are easier to sell quickly than debt issued by a small company. In times of crisis, investors tend to have a strong preference for liquidity; when asset markets are booming, illiquid assets seem more attractive. See liquidity trap.\n\nLiquidity trap\n\nA concept, introduced by John Maynard Keynes, that monetary policy has a limited effect when animal spirits are depressed. Cutting interest rates will not cause more businesses to invest, or consumers to spend rather than save, because they will prefer the liquidity of cash. In such circumstances, fiscal policy has to do the work of reviving the economy. See also zero lower bound.\n\nLoss aversion\n\nA psychological trait, discussed in behavioural economics, that dislikes the acceptance of losses. Investors may hold on to losing positions, rather than sell them, because they are unwilling to recognise their mistake. Depending on how a proposition is framed, people may act differently; a discount for paying taxes early will be less effective as an inducement for early payment than a penalty for paying late. See also framing and sunk cost syndrome.\n\nLump of labour fallacy\n\nThe assumption that there is a fixed amount of work to go round, so that letting new entrants into the job market will penalise existing workers. It was once used to argue against women joining the workforce and is still used against immigrants. But the fallacy ignores an obvious point; that new workers earn wages and then spend those wages on goods and services produced by other workers. Indeed, the global population has increased enormously over the past century, yet most people have found jobs.\n\nM\n\nMacroeconomics\n\nThe analysis of how the overall economy works; how the decisions of consumers, business, investors and governments affect key measures such as inflation, unemployment and gross domestic product. Economists try to use macroeconomic analysis to forecast economic indicators but human behaviour is hard to predict, especially as forecasts can affect individual decisions. But macroeconomic policy tools include fiscal policy, monetary policy and changes in laws and regulations designed to change behaviour. See also microeconomics.\n\nMacroprudential regulation\n\nSetting rules for the financial system to try to prevent a widespread collapse, on the lines of the 2007-09 crisis. Examples might include getting banks to have minimum amounts of equity capital or requiring home buyers to put up a larger deposit when they take out a mortgage. See also systemic risk.\n\nManufacturing\n\nThe process of making physical products from raw materials through the use of labour and machinery. Once dominant in developed economies, it now takes a smaller share of GDP than services. That is unlikely to be reversed: see this Explainer.\n\nMargin\n\nThe term crops up quite often in economics and finance. In the stockmarket, investors and analysts often focus on profit margins; the difference between the revenues from selling a product and the costs of producing it, often expressed as a percentage of the latter. Investors can also buy shares on margin; putting up only a fraction of the overall cost (an example of leverage). The marginal product of labour is how much extra output a firm would get by employing an extra worker, or by getting an existing worker to put in an extra hour. See also marginal cost, marginal propensity to consume, marginal tax rate and marginal utility.\n\nMarginal cost\n\nThe cost of producing an extra unit of something. When production is increased, the marginal cost of producing an extra item can be significantly lower than the average cost of production (see economies of scale).\n\nMarginal propensity to consume\n\nThe proportion of an extra earned dollar that an individual would spend rather than save. People with lower incomes have a higher marginal propensity to consume than the rich. This means that attempts to ease fiscal policy are best targeted at those who are not well off.\n\nMarginal tax rate\n\nThe proportion of an extra earned dollar that will be taken by tax. High marginal tax rates can reduce incentives to work. This occurs at both ends of the income scale. At the lower end, marginal tax rates can be high as welfare benefits are withdrawn once individualsâ incomes pass certain levels. At the upper end, many societies impose higher marginal tax rates on those with high incomes. See also progressive taxation.\n\nMarginal utility\n\nThe added (or lost) satisfaction or benefit gained by consumers from the increase (or decrease) of one unit. The usual assumption is that marginal utility declines as consumption increases: for a hungry person, the first slice of toast is very satisfying but they may stop eating before their seventh or eighth.\n\nMark-to-market\n\nThe practice of recording the value of an asset in a set of accounts at the current price, rather than the price at which it was bought. Though logical in theory, the practice has been criticised for encouraging short-termism. If the market value is hard to ascertain, then the company can exploit the uncertainty to manipulate the figures: mark-to-market accounting was at the heart of the Enron scandal.\n\nMarket failure\n\nThis occurs when a market fails to allocate resources efficiently, or fails to account for real-world costs. This can occur because of externalities, such as the pollution emitted by a chemical plant which is a cost that falls on people with no economic connection to the chemical company. Some goods (public goods), such as defence or roadbuilding, can only (or mainly) be supplied by the public sector since they are subject to the free rider problem. Market failures can occur if an industry is dominated by a monopoly or monopsony, or in the presence of asymmetric information.\n\nMarxism\n\nSee communism.\n\nMass production\n\nOne of the breakthroughs in 20th-century manufacturing was the development of mass production, normally associated with the Ford Motor Company. Mass production usually involved the division of labour, specialised machinery and standardised products. The economies of scale involved allowed manufacturers to lower their prices and vastly expand the potential market for their goods.\n\nMaturity\n\nA term which applies to debt, and refers to the amount of life before the debt needs to be repaid and thus refinanced.\n\nMedium of exchange\n\nOne of the important functions of a currency is that it is easy to use to buy and sell goods. Modern fiat currencies achieve this feat but cryptocurrencies have yet to do so.\n\nMercantilism\n\nAn economic school of thought, common in the 17th and 18th centuries, which argued that countries should focus on building up their supplies of gold and silver. This required nations to restrict imports and attempt to boost exports, and to restrict free trade. Mercantilists believed trade was a zero-sum game. Adam Smithâs arguments against state intervention were linked to his belief that mercantilism was misguided.\n\nMergers and acquisitions (M&A )\n\nThis term, often abbreviated to M&A, concerns corporate takeovers. Genuine mergers, in which two companies of roughly equal size combine, are much rarer than acquisitions, in which a larger company buys a smaller one. And hostile acquisitions, in which the smaller company resists the deal, are rarer than agreed takeovers. The deals are very lucrative for investment banks, and other advisers, who are thus understandably happy to recommend them. But the buying company faces the risk of overpaying for the target and the danger that the culture of the two businesses is incompatible, leading to disappointing returns.\n\nMicroeconomics\n\nThe branch of economics that studies the decision-making of individual entities, such as individuals and businesses. Microeconomists look at how these agents will respond to incentives, or to changes in prices, regulations or taxes. By contrast, macroeconomics looks at the behaviour of the economy in aggregate.\n\nMiddle income trap\n\nA problem that can affect developing countries as they get stuck at a certain level of GDP per person. Such countries can have success in manufacturing low-value goods but then supposedly struggle to develop higher value-added sectors in services or technology. For a sceptical view, see this article. And on Chinaâs prospects of escaping it, see this one.\n\nMinimum wage\n\nAn hourly pay rate for workers, set by law, with the aim of reducing poverty and protecting workers from exploitation. Many economists were historically dubious about the benefits of a minimum wage (see Explainer), believing it would reduce demand for labour and thus drive up unemployment. The evidence in practice is that there has been relatively little impact on employment, perhaps because higher wages attract better-skilled workers and reduce staff turnover, or because, in many sectors, using minimum-wage labour is still cheaper than using machinery. For more detail, see our Schools Brief.\n\nMinsky moment\n\nA sudden collapse in market sentiment. Named after Hyman Minsky, an economist, who developed a financial instability hypothesis. As asset prices rise, investors become more and more confident and use leverage to finance their positions. By the end, they will be buying regardless of underlying valuations. At some point, confidence will falter and investors will rush to sell and repay their debts, causing prices to collapse. For more, read our Schools Brief.\n\nMisery index\n\nThe sum of the rates of inflation and unemployment. Created in the 1970s by Arthur Okun, an American economist, to gauge the cost of stagflation.\n\nMixed economy\n\nAn economic system that combines elements of free enterprise and state planning. Few economies are not mixed to some degree, with the possible exception of North Korea. Even communist Cuba allows some market activity.\n\nModels\n\nA description of economic relationships in mathematical or graphical form, designed to allow hypotheses to be tested. Inevitably, models have to simplify the incredibly complex nature of relationships in the real world. Although models can add clarity and mathematical rigour to statements about the economy, some are criticised for their unrealistic assumptions (such as perfect information and rational expectations). And a fondness for complex mathematical equations has led economists to be accused of âphysics envyâ; trying to create precise rules in a social science.\n\nModern monetary theory (MMT )\n\nA school of economic thought which argues that a government, which can borrow in its own currency, can issue as much debt, and run as large a deficit, as it likes, subject only to the constraint of higher inflation. The government does not have to worry about financing its deficit, since the central bank can buy the extra debt, or indeed just create the required money. Only if the economy is at full capacity will this credit creation lead to inflation. Adherents to MMT tend to believe that the business cycle should be managed with fiscal policy rather than interest rates. Orthodox economists are dismissive of MMT: see this article and our Schools Brief.\n\nMonetarism\n\nThe belief that changes in the money supply are the main determinant of changes in inflation, associated especially with Milton Friedman, an American economist. Cases of hyperinflation have indeed been associated with the rapid printing of money. But when governments adopted monetarist policies in the late 1970s and early 1980s, they found money supply hard to control and also struggled to decide which measure of money supply was best to target. Monetarist policies were abandoned in favour of inflation targeting.\n\nMonetary financing\n\nThe direct financing of government spending by the central bank. This happened during the hyperinflation in Germany in 1923 and was thus regarded as anathema for a long period afterwards. As a result, some commentators viewed quantitative easing after the financial crisis of 2007-09 with great suspicion. Technically, however, QE is not monetary financing, because central banks only buy government bonds in the secondary market and because they pay interest on reserves (the money they create).\n\nMonetary policy\n\nThe use, normally by the central bank, of interest rates and other tools to try to influence the economy. Interest rates are raised when the bank is trying to control inflation and lowered when inflation is low and it is trying to revive the economy. The financial crisis of 2007-09 led central banks to face the zero lower bound. This prompted many of them to use a new tool, quantitative easing, which was designed to bring down long-term rates or bond yields.\n\nMoney\n\nThe oil that greases the economyâs wheels, and acts as the unit of account for economic activity. Money can be any token that is accepted as payment; past examples have included seashells and the giant stones on the island of Yap. For a while, money was linked to precious metals but modern money is largely fiat currency and is electronic in form. Whatever its form, money needs to be a reasonably stable store of value and an acceptable medium of exchange.\n\nMoney illusion\n\nFailing to take account of the effect of inflation. Employers may find workers more willing to agree to a pay rise of 4% when inflation is 6% than to accept a pay freeze when prices are falling. Savers should be happier about earning a return of 2% when inflation is zero than the prospect of earning 4% when inflation is 6%. See also real terms.\n\nMoney markets\n\nA term used to describe the borrowing and lending of money on a short-term basis (generally for less than a year). Banks need to finance themselves with short-term borrowing on a regular basis, so when the money markets freeze (as they did in 2008) a crisis usually follows.\n\nMoney supply\n\nThe total amount of money in an economy. This is very hard to define; notes and coins are only a small part of the money we use. Current account balances, unused credit card balances and holdings of money-market funds can all be added to the mix. Measuring all these, and deciding which are the most important, dogged the application of monetarism in practice.\n\nMonopoly\n\nA company with a controlling position in an industry or sector. Traditionally, the main fear was that monopolies would exploit their position to overcharge customers. But in the internet age, concerns have shifted to the idea that technology companies with strong franchises will strangle competition by denying new firms access to their platforms, or by simply acquiring them to add the product to their range, thereby increasing their dominance. See antitrust.\n\nMonopsony\n\nWhereas a monopoly is a seller with a dominant position, a monopsony is a dominant buyer. An example could be a food producer which is the main buyer of coffee beans or fresh chickens from farmers. A monopsonist can exploit its position by insisting on low prices.\n\nMoral hazard\n\nThe risk that providing insurance might alter the behaviour of those being insured. Homeowners or car drivers may take more risks if they know that an insurance company will cover their losses. This is also a problem for central banks when they act as a lender of last resort for banks; knowing they will be rescued in a crisis, bank executives may take more risks and investors may be less choosy about the banks with which they do business. See asymmetric information.\n\nMost favoured nation\n\nA core principle of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) and the GATT, this requires countries to treat the imports and exports of all other WTO members in the way that they treat the âmost favoured nationâ among their trading partners. In other words, there is no special treatment for any one country.\n\nMultiplier effect\n\nThis concept, central to Keynesian economics, relates to the proportional increase, or decrease, in demand that can arise from an injection, or withdrawal, of spending. So a government increase in spending on, say, roadbuilding will mean more jobs for workers who spend their wages on other goods and services, which encourages the employment of more workers, and so on. For more detail, see our Explainer and Schools Brief.\n\nN\n\nNAFTA ( North American Free Trade Agreement )\n\nA deal signed in 1993 by America, Canada and Mexico to eliminate tariff barriers between the three countries by creating a free trade area. The agreement was disliked by many on both the left and the right of American politics and President Donald Trump renegotiated it during his term of office, renaming it the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). The main change was that a greater proportion of a car or truckâs components had to be manufactured in America to qualify for tariff exemption.\n\nNairu ( Non-Accelerating Inflation Rate of Unemployment )\n\nThe lowest rate of unemployment that does not lead to a jump in wages and inflation. It is a de"
