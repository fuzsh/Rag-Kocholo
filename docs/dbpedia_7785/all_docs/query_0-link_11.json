        "text": "Although both economists, Hayek and Friedman, shared a common set of values in the promotion and defense of individual liberty and the limited role of the state, they had some methodological and political differences. This colloquium explored the similarities and differences between them with a special emphasis on Hayek's political thought. We also included readings in the final session focusing on Friedman's famous visit to Chile during the dictatorship of Pinochet."
