Since 1979 he has co-authored and edited a number of publications on economic and policy issues for the Adam Smith Institute.\n\nDr Butler writes regularly on economics for leading newspapers. In 2012 he received an Honorary D.Litt from Heriot-Watt University.\n\nIntroduction\n\nWhat this book is about\n\nThis book is a straightforward guide to the ideas and influence of the Nobel economist Friedrich Hayek (1899–1992), regarded by many as the twentieth century’s most important thinker on social and economic freedom.\n\nAn Austrian who fled Nazi oppression, Hayek’s insights into the workings of the free society and free economy, and his critique of socialism that stemmed from them, helped shatter the postwar faith in economic planning, and were a significant influence on world leaders such as Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher. His ideas continue to influence economists, political scientists, politicians and students across the world today.\n\nHayek received the 1974 Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences, largely for his early work explaining the cause and effect of boom–bust cycles such as that of the 1920s and 1930s. He also made significant contributions in the fields of legal theory, psychology and information science. But Hayek remains best known for his work in political science, and for his books The Road to Serfdom (a caustic analysis of how socialism, if consistently followed, develops into totalitarianism) and The Constitution of Liberty (a major exposition of the foundations and principles of a free society).\n\nPerhaps Hayek’s key insight is the ability of market economies, through the price system, to process a vast amount of information – including dispersed and personal information that no central planner could even know, let alone manage. This enabled him to explain the vibrancy of free, ‘spontaneous’ social order, in contrast to the drab failure of planned societies.\n\nWho this book is for\n\nThis book is written for people who want to learn more about the case for individual freedom and free-market capitalism – and the deeply insightful case for liberalism put forward by one of its greatest exponents. (Throughout this book, ‘liberalism’ is used in the European sense of support for individual freedom and limited government.)\n\nThe book explains Hayek’s ideas on the nature of society and economics, and some of the criticisms that have been made of them. It aims to do so in plain language and without distortion. So there are no distracting academic-style footnotes or bibliography – just an essential reading list of Hayek’s main writings and important books about him.\n\nThe book should interest school and college students of economics, politics and social science, giving them a concise introduction to some radical ideas that are too frequently ignored by teachers and textbooks. Students will find plenty here with which to challenge those teachers!\n\nHayek is also relevant politically, as one of the leading gurus behind the rise of the New Right in the 1980s and 1990s. His ideas had a huge influence on a growing band of academics, intellectuals, think-tankers and politicians; and through them, these ideas influenced the radical pro-freedom and pro-capitalism agendas of Margaret Thatcher in Britain, Ronald Reagan in America, and other world leaders, including many from the former Soviet-bloc countries.\n\nWhy this book was written\n\nAt a conference in London in the early 1980s, the writings of F. A. Hayek were being discussed. The Alternative Bookshop had brought along a selection of Hayek’s books; but I could see that many of the people browsing through them were intimidated by the academic density of some of these works and did not know where to start. Hayek was one of my main intellectual inspirations – I knew him slightly and met him often at conferences – and I was familiar with his ideas. So I resolved to write a short book on those ideas to help others discover and understand them.\n\nThat book was published in 1983, and was well received by many people who had never been introduced to Hayek’s ideas, or even to the arguments for liberalism and capitalism. However, the book is now difficult to obtain; and increasingly, I have come to see its shortcomings. It is too long, too technical and too detailed for such a primer. It was also written when Hayek was still alive and working, which meant that I could not take a detached view of his output, nor fully assess his more enduring impact, nor take account of the many useful criticisms of his work that have been made subsequently.\n\nThis book, by contrast, is short and focused; the language is non-technical; it avoids academic trappings; it assesses the longer-term impact of Hayek’s contribution and reviews the main arguments of his critics and defenders. So I hope it should provide an ideal primer on its subject.\n\nHow this book is structured\n\nThe book starts by showing Hayek’s importance in the development of free-market and liberal ideas, and his impact on economic and social policy debates during his lifetime and today.\n\nChapter 2 outlines Hayek’s groundbreaking ideas on the structure of society, and how societies do not have to be consciously planned in order to work efficiently. Chapter 3 explores the role of freedom and the law in maintaining the harmony of such societies.\n\nChapter 4 takes this idea into economics, sketching Hayek’s view of markets as hugely effective at processing the dispersed and patchy information on which economic life is based – far more so than any central planner. Chapter 5 goes on to describe Hayek’s view on boom and bust cycles, and his analysis of how inept government policies distort the market process and stop it from working.\n\nChapter 6 explains Hayek’s argument that much current economic thinking is just a particular case of how the methods of the physical sciences are misapplied to social issues, for which they are unsuited – leading to major policy mistakes.\n\nOne of those policy mistakes, according to Hayek, is the doctrine of socialism and central planning. Chapter 7 outlines Hayek’s critique of socialism, and Chapter 8 his critique of the idea of ‘social justice’.\n\nChapter 9 sets out the constitutional and institutional framework that Hayek believes would promote the operation of a free and prosperous society, before the short conclusion that is Chapter 10.\n\nA Timeline of F. A. Hayek’s Life and Work\n\n1899: Friedrich August von Hayek born into an academic family in Vienna, capital of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.\n\n1917: During the first world war, Hayek joins the Austro-Hungarian Army, serving in artillery and in aircraft on the Italian front.\n\n1919: Austria abolishes the minor aristocratic ‘von’ titles. Throughout his career, Hayek styles himself simply as ‘F. A. Hayek’.\n\n1920: Hayek works for brain scientist Constantin Monakow, stimulating his thoughts on perception and knowledge.\n\n1921: Hayek earns a doctorate in law from the University of Vienna. At Vienna he discovers the work of the ‘Austrian School’ economists.\n\n1921: Leading Austrian School economist Ludwig von Mises hires Hayek to help in an office dealing with postwar finance issues.\n\n1922: Living through Weimar Germany’s hyperinflation makes Hayek critically aware of the dangers of inflation.\n\n1923: Hayek earns another doctorate from Vienna, in political science.\n\n1923-4: Hayek becomes a research assistant at New York University.\n\n1927: Mises and Hayek found the Austrian Institute for Business Cycle Research. On the basis of this work, Hayek publishes Monetary Theory and the Trade Cycle (1929), Prices and Production (1931) and The Pure Theory of Capital (1941).\n\n1928: Hayek first meets John Maynard (later Lord) Keynes at a conference in London.\n\n1931: Hayek moves to the London School of Economics at the invitation of British economist Lionel (later Lord) Robbins.\n\n1931-2: Hayek becomes the leading critic of Keynes, writing critical reviews of his books and exchanging letters in The Times on the merits of government spending versus private investment.\n\n1936: Keynes publishes The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money. Though alarmed at its inflationary implications, Hayek neglects to review the work, which becomes hugely influential.\n\n1936: At the London Economic Club, Hayek gives a talk on the key role of information in economic life, a theme he would continue to refine.\n\n1938: After Germany’s Anschluss with Austria, and fearing Nazi persecution if he returns home, Hayek becomes a British citizen.\n\n1944: Evacuated to Cambridge during the Second World War, Hayek publishes The Road to Serfdom. It becomes an international success.\n\n1944: Hayek is elected to the prestigious British Academy.\n\n1945-6: Hayek lectures across the United States and becomes Visiting Professor at Stanford University."
