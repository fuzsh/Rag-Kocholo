"Friedrich Hayek’s influence has been tremendous. His work is incorporated in the body of technical economic theory; has had a major influence on economic history, political philosophy and political science; has affected students of the law, of scientific methodology, and even of psychology. But from the particular perspective of the present book, all of these are secondary to Hayek’s influence in strengthening the moral and intellectual support for a free society" (Milton Friedman).
