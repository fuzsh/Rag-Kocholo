MIAMI — Heat forward Shawn Marion remained sidelined Monday, sitting out Miami’s game against the Atlanta Hawks because of continued problems with a strained left groin.

It’s the third time Marion has been unable to play in Miami’s last four games.

He started last Wednesday against the Boston Celtics, but could play only eight minutes to open the game and never returned.

Marion is averaging 12 points and nine rebounds this season.
