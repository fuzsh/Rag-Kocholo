A Shawn Marion trade from the Heat is starting to sounds imminent, according to the Miami Herald.

It’s hard to tell whether the Heat or Marion are more anxious to cut ties, but it does sound like a deal is going to happen before the All-Star break. If you’re still holding onto Marion, it’s possible relief is on the way. He’s in a contract year so he’d like to move to a running offense where he can showcase his skills.
