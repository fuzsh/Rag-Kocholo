        "text": "One of the NBA's strangest and most unpredictable regular seasons in recent memory will come to a close this week. That means it is time to hand out awards.\n\nWith so many worthy candidates for almost every category, I will magnanimously reward high achievers in each conference. (This is also a veiled attempt to avoid the hate mail that would surely come my way from readers from virtually every city in the league.)\n\nMOST VALUABLE PLAYER\n\nEast: Shaquille O'Neal. Until he fell ill and missed a few games in the final two weeks of the season, Shaq was a constant force for the Miami Heat. His presence turned the Heat into a championship contender by making everyone around him better at both ends of the floor.\n\nThe Heat led the league in field-goal percentage by feeding the ball to their big man and spreading the court. While O'Neal's statistics weren't earth shattering (22.9 points, 10.4 rebounds and 2.3 blocks), his true value is seen in the stats of his teammates.\n\nChristian Laettner is shooting 57.9 percent. Udonis Haslem is averaging 10.9 points and 9.1 rebounds and is making 53.7 percent of his shots. Dwyane Wade is scoring nearly eight more points a game (24.2) than he did a season ago (16.3). And Damon Jones is having by far the best season of his career (11.8 points per game, a career- and NBA-best 221 3-pointers). As Scott Skiles said, \"Shaq could win MVP every year.\" Well, this year he deserves it.\n\nWest: Steve Nash. This guy has always been a terrific player, but he enjoyed a season for the ages with the Phoenix Suns. His presence at the point guard spot made everything click for the Suns' up-tempo offense.\n\nLike O'Neal, Nash's value is not displayed in his own numbers – although he is leading the league in assists at 11.5 per game – but also in the statistics of his teammates. Amare Stoudamire is shooting 55.9 percent and scoring 26.0 points per game, both career bests. Quentin Richardson has made 219 3-pointers, second in the NBA. Shawn Marion is arguably having his best season ever, averaging 19.6 points and 11.4 rebounds. And Joe Johnson has emerged as a top-flight all-around guard, scoring 16.9 points per game to go with 3.6 assists and 5.2 rebounds.\n\nOf course, the best number to gauge Nash's impact is in the win column, where the Suns have notched more victories (61) than any other team in the league.\n\nCOACH OF THE YEAR\n\nEast: Eddie Jordan. The Wizards were a lottery team last season, but Jordan has quietly changed the culture in D.C. to lead Washington to the playoffs for the first time since 1997. The Wizards execute the Princeton offense well together and have found a nice groove. Even without an inside threat, Jordan's team is high-scoring and fun to watch. He beats out Chicago's Skiles – barely. Skiles helped the Bulls overcome a 0-9 start and led them to the playoffs. They are nasty and very defensive-minded, and they compete every night.\n\nWest: George Karl. He narrowly edges Phoenix's Mike D'Antoni and Seattle's Nate McMillan because coming to a struggling team in the middle of the season and turning it into a winner is ridiculously difficult. Without the benefit of a training camp to impart his philosophy, Karl has somehow gotten the Nuggets to trust each other and share the ball – something they weren't doing early in the season.\n\nD'Antoni has been a breath of fresh air for the NBA. He's a guy who doesn't feel the need to call a play every time down the floor, instead urging them to run and create good shots through tempo and ball movement. It is basketball the way it ought to be played. McMillan deserves credit for leading a Sonics team nobody thought could win the Northwest Division title.\n\nROOKIE OF THE YEAR\n\nEast: Ben Gordon. There are two reasons why he wins the award over fellow UConn alum Emeka Okafor. One is that his play helped the Bulls back into the playoffs for the first time since 1998. The other is that he led all NBA players in fourth-quarter scoring. He's a modern-day Andrew Toney – a compact two guard with strength, ball-handling skills, shooting touch and an assassin's mentality.\n\nWest: Beno Udrih. Once again, the San Antonio Spurs shrewdly find a talent late in the first round. Like the man he plays behind – Tony Parker – Udrih was selected 28th overall, but he quickly earned a spot in the rotation with his heady play. The Slovenian has a beautiful pace to his game and a nice feel running the Spurs' offense. He's a gifted passer and a very good outside shooter (team-best 40.6 percent on 3s). It's rare for a rookie to earn Gregg Popovich's trust – especially at point guard – but Udrih has done just that.\n\nMOST IMPROVED\n\nEast: LeBron James. Sure the Cleveland Cavaliers' star was good last year. But he has improved by leaps and bounds this season. His jump shot is so much better, as is his shot selection. He is shooting 47.3 percent after making just 41.7 percent a year ago. James not only became an All-Star this season but also one of the top five players in the NBA. If he improves at the same rate next season, he'll be playing in his own league.\n\nWest: Bobby Simmons. The Los Angeles Clippers' small forward isn't well known – probably because he plays for the Clippers – but he is on his way to becoming one of the league's better small forwards. His shooting stroke is pure, he has a strong body that allows him to get to the basket and the foul line and his coaches rave about his work ethic. Not bad for a guy who once played in the NBDL.\n\nSIXTH MAN AWARD\n\nEast: Ben Gordon. There's no law against winning two awards in the same season, is there? When you win as many games as Gordon did with fourth-quarter heroics, you deserve this award. This might be his only chance to win it, as he'll probably earn a starter's role next season.\n\nWest: Jerry Stackhouse. The former malcontent has reinvented himself with the Dallas Mavericks, not only accepting his role off the bench but also flourishing. He's scoring 15 points a night, and by playing fewer minutes, his defense has gained intensity. Stackhouse is a huge reason why the Mavericks enter the postseason as one of the most feared teams.\n\nDEFENSIVE PLAYER OF THE YEAR\n\nEast: Ben Wallace. Just plug this guy's name in here every season. He is the key to the champion Detroit Pistons' attack, dominating the paint with his shot blocking and energy. Throughout a long and arduous regular season, Wallace has been a rock for the Pistons, and now they are playing well and rolling into the playoffs.\n\nWest: Bruce Bowen. Nobody bothers All-Star wing players more than the relentless Bowen – just ask Ray Allen. Bowen's aggressive, attacking perimeter defense sets the tone for the Spurs and fits perfectly into their scheme, which is to force everything to the baseline and into the shot-blocking help of San Antonio's big people.\n\nUnlike a lot of \"stoppers,\" Bowen is unselfish. He'll rotate off his man to help every time he needs to and not worry about his man's statistics.\n\nCOMEBACK PLAYER OF THE YEAR\n\nEast: Grant Hill. A no-brainer. The Orlando Magic forward accomplished an amazing recovery after missing most of the last four seasons with ankle problems.\n\nWest: Jason Terry. Maligned as a selfish shooter in Atlanta, Terry has turned himself into an efficient point guard in Dallas. He solidified the position when Mavericks desperately needed him to do so.\n\nEXECUTIVE OF THE YEAR\n\nEast: John Paxson. He turned a losing Bulls culture into a winning one by drafting and signing a slew of winners. He nabbed Gordon with the third pick in the draft, a couple of months after the UConn star won an NCAA title, and signed Andres Nocioni shortly after the Argentinean won a gold medal in Athens. Then Paxson added two Dukies – Luol Deng with the seventh pick in the draft in a trade with Phoenix, and Chris Duhon as a free agent. Both have been starters for much of the season.\n\nPaxson also secured several key bench players who have helped team chemistry and been solid contributors, including Jannero Pargo, Adrian Griffin and Eric Piatkowski.\n\nWest: Bryan Colangelo. His work began last season, when he expertly engineered the trade of Stephon Marbury and Penny Hardaway to the Knicks that rescued the Suns from salary-cap hell. Then Colangelo used that cap space to sign Nash and Richardson, completing a starting five that has given opponents fits this season."
