        "text": "An old bible passage once said “that my son was dead and is now alive, he was lost and is now found..” That familiar adage proved to be true to the Jet Jason Terry who has risen from the dead to help out the german Assasin and NBA Finals MVP Dirk Nowitzki and the never say die Dallas Mavericks to a convincing 105 – 95 win over the Miami Heat at the American Airlines Arena in Miami. The win not only gave them the all important fourth win but it avenged their 2006 finals meltdown against the same team.\n\nChandler is \"The Man\" in the middle\n\nThe Mavs served notice when they dispatched the defending champion Los Angeles Lakers in four games, even blowing them out int he fourth one. The Mavs showed the best player in the planet Kobe Bryant that its their time to shine. The potent offensive weapons of the Mavericks were no match to the rising stars of the West as they matched every offensive flurry of the NBA’s leading scorer Kevin Durant in which they came back from the dead twice on the road to win the West. TO make matters worse the Mavericks had the answer to the dreaded threesome from Florida as they shut down Lebron James, survived Dwayne Wade and tamed Chris Bosh. The Mavericks found ways to win and deserved every inch of the Larry O’Brien trophy.\n\nGo Dirk\n\nRedemption might also be another subplot in this NBA Finals as another Jason, the Kidd who started his career in the same city will hopefully end it with a ring. Jason Kidd who twice fell short in the 2003 and 2004 finals has been the guiding light of the Mavericks as he showed the way for his ward JJ Barea who was inserted to the starting line up in game 4 and everything went well for the Mavericks. Coach Rick Carlisle was also an assistant coach of the Indiana team that lost to the Lakers in 2000 and has transformed all that bad experiences into something worth rallying for. From a band of misfits, Shawn Marion, Tyson Chandler and Peja Stojakovic can now ride on the momentum of their win and have something taht a lot of NBA Superstars would trade anytihgn for - that elusive NBA ring.\n\nJJ Barea the surprise package\n\nThe Mavericks opened strong and had their first double digit lead 40 – 28 on a three point shot by De Shawn Stevenson with 9:42 left in the second quarter. The Heat sued for time and unleashed another patented 14 -0 run capped by the second three pointer of Eddie House that had them lead by two 42 -40 with 6:25 remaining. Unfortunately for the Heat, the Mavericks offense was in full force as they sank 11 of 26 three point shots taht fueled the Dallas team to another 100 point scoring night. The story of the Dallas Maverick’s resiliency, determination and never say die attitude will be a topic that will long be told in for many years to come. Congratulations to Mark Cuban and the 2011 NBA Champs, the Dallas Mavericks.\n\nThe Mavs Celebrate\n\nLand of Bondage, Land of the Free\n\nBy Raul Manglapus\n\nAnd yet gentlemen, the tao is constitutionally free. No wonder, then that the tao, being a slave, has acquired the habits of a slave. No wonder that after three centuries in chains, without freedom, without hope, he should lose the erect and fearless posture of the freeman, and become the bent, misshapen, indolent, vicious, pitiful thing that he is! Who dares accuse him, who dares rise up in judgment against this man, reduced to this sub-human level by three centuries of oppression. The tao does not come here tonight to be judged — but to judge! Hear then his accusation and his sentence:\n\nI indict the Spanish encomendero for inventing taxes impossible to bear.\n\nI indict the usurer for saddling me with debts impossible to pay.\n\nI indict the irresponsible radical leaders who undermine, with insidious eloquence, the confidence of my kind in our government.\n\nYou accuse me of not supporting my family. Free me from bondage, and I shall prove you false.\n\nYou accuse me of ignorance. But I am ignorant because my master finds it profitable to keep me ignorant. Free me from bondage, and I shall prove you false.\n\nYou accuse me of indolence. But I am indolent not because I have no will, but because I have no hope. Why should I labor, if all the fruits of my labor go to pay an unpayable debt. Free me from bondage, and I shall prove you false.\n\nGive me land. Land to own. Land unbeholden to any tyrant. Land that will be free. Give me land for I am starving. Give me land that my children may not die. Sell it to me, sell it to me at a fair price, as one freeman sells to another and not as a usurer sells to a slave. I am poor, but I will pay it! I will work, work until I fall from weariness for my privilege, for my inalienable right to be free!\n\nBUT IF YOU WILL NOT GRANT ME THIS … If you will not grant me this last request, this ultimate demand, then build a wall around your home … build it high! … build it strong! Place a sentry on every parapet! … for I who have been silent these three hundred years will come in the night when you are feasting, with my cry and my bolo at your door. And may God have mercy on your soul!\n\nNote: When I was a teen-ager at the Ateneo this was one of the most popular elocution pieces that we delivered during auditions. Until now i recite lines of this essay written by one of the most eloquent Atenistas I know, Senator Raul Manglapus.\n\nLA Revilla is back\n\nLast school year the De La Salle University hosted the UAAP with the theme Heroes which was very fitting for the UAAP indeed came up with lots of heroes last year. This year, that can still be the case as the Green Archers served notice its intentions to win this year’s UAAP title by beating the three time defending UAAP champion Ateneo Blue Eagles 66 – 61 in the Filoil Preseason Tournament with their newest hero on the court, the comebacking LA Revilla.\n\nKiefer Ravena scores\n\nThe Blue Eagles started out flat which the green archers ably took advantage. After leading 5 – 4 with a little over four minutes left in the first quarter the Green Archers caught fire and unleashed a 12 - 6 run to end the first quarter on top 17- 10. In the second quarter the Archers forced the Eagles to numerous misses and buried the Eagles in an avalanche of points to lead by twelve points 34 - 22. Finally the Eagles woke up and countered with their own 9 - 3 run to close the gap to five at the half 36 – 31.\n\nJustin Chua drives to the hoop\n\nAfter the half the Blue Eagles started to clamp down on the Green Archers as their vaunted half court defense finally made caught up on the Green Archers as Justin Chua put the Katipunan 5 on top with two free throws 50 – 49. It was at this time that Revilla took matters into his own hands as he buried two triples and gave the Green Archers a 57 -50 lead. The Blue Eagles would force the Green Archers to misses once again and equalize at 61 - all but unfortunately did not finish well as Revilla presided over a 5 -0 run in the last minute to seal the win.\n\nKirk Long scores\n\nIt was a fitting revenge for Revilla who last played in the UAAP against the Blue Eagles back in 2008. His return gives more solid point guard play for the Archers who have Simon Atkiins playing in his last year. The Green Archers are solid on all positions and are definitely out to make a starement in the 2011 UAAP season and who knows they might even celebrate their centennial with another UAAP Crown. But for now, the win means the Green Archers qualified for the quarterfinals of the Fil-oil tournament.\n\nJuami Tiongson & Luigi Dela Paz face up\n\nTHE SCORES:\n\nDLSU (66)\n\nRevilla 12, Marata 10, de la Paz 9, Atkins 8, Andrada 5, Paredes 5, Torres 4, Mendoza 4, Van Opstal 3, Villanueva 2, Gotladera 2, Vosotros 1, Webb 1, Tampus 0\n\nAteneo (61)\n\nSalva 18, Ravena 10, Long 7, Monfort 7, Chua 7, Austria 6, Tiongson 4, Slaughter 2, Golla 0, Gonzaga 0, Sumalinog 0, Erram 0\n\nQuarter scoring: 17-10, 36-31, 49-48, 66-61\n\nWade misses the game winner as Mavs celebrate\n\nMario Chalmers scrambled under the basket and found a cutting Dwayne Wade who sank a three-pointer to give the Miami Heat a commanding 88 – 73 lead with 7 minutes and 14 second left in the fourth quarter of game 2 of the 2011 NBA Finals. Dallas Mavericks Coach Rick Carlisle sued for time and the Miami Heat with Lebron James and Dwayne Wade were fueling the crowd’s cheers as the Heat sense a commanding 2 – 0 lead in the series. But then again the celebration went way too early as the Mavericks uncorked a paralyzing 22 – 5 run that ended with a Dirk Nowitzki lay up to escape with a 95 – 93 win and even the series at one game apiece.\n\nLebron celebrates\n\nDejavu, that sums up the 2011 Playoffs for the Dallas Mavericks as their vaunted offense finally came to life in the last six minutes of the game with Jason Terry waking up from his game 1 nightmare to score eight points as he presided over an 8 – 0 run by the Mavs after Carlisle’s time out. The early celebration might have defocused the Heat as their offense suddenly sputtered as Wade, James, Bosh and Chalmers all missed their jumpers in that stretch which allowed the Mavericks to comeback. The Mavericks have been in this situation in the conference finals as they wiped out Oklahoma’s 15 point fourth quarter lead to win in overtime but this one tops it all.\n\nDwayne Wade was almost unstoppable\n\nWhile Terry ignited the rally, Nowitzki finished off the Heat with his fourth quarter clutch shooting as he scored seven points in the last minute to give the Heat their first home loss in the play-offs which some say might be their last game in Miami. Nowitzki score off a jumper and a three pointer but none was bigger than his lay up with 3 seconds left to give the Mavs the victory. It was rumored that Nowitzki might have a hard time scoring since he tore the tendon in the top knuckle of this left finger late in game 1. But as they say heroes rise to the occasion as his winning shot was a left handed lay up over Chris Bosh.\n\nShawn Marion was all business\n\nIt was a sorry loss for the Heat moreso for Dwayne Wade who finally exploded as he led all scorers with 36 points with James adding 20, Mike Bibby scoring 14 and Bosh 12 points. Nowitzki’s 24 points were all hard earned and he got great support from Shawn Marion who scored 20 poinyts on 9 of 14 shooting. Jason Terry and Tyson Chandler scored 16 and 13 points respectively. As they say whenever a team wins on the road the series becomes a little more interesting which is what the next three games in Dallas will be.\n\nNowitzki's game winner"
