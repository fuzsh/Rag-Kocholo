        "text": "Over the past decade, the NBA has evolved into a more positionless game. Former All-Star Shawn Marion, who spent a short stint with the Miami Heat, recently said he was among the first players to adapt to this phenomenon.\n\n\"I can honestly say I changed the game. I was a big part of changing the game… Small ball. Positionless basketball…,\" Marion said in an interview with the Las Vegas Journal-Review. \"I’m 6’7, 230 pounds. You’ve got me guarding 7-footers... It’s what everybody’s doing now.\"\n\nFrom 2010–2014, the Heat won two championships through a positionless approach. It has since spread throughout the league.\n\nIn 2012 and 2013, the 6-foot-9 Lebron James played all five positions, especially on the defensive end. Chris Bosh, who began his career as a power forward, played mostly center because of his ability to spread the floor.\n\nSmall forwards Shane Battier and James Jones started the four, creating mismatches on offense. The Heat viewed their players based on their roles on the floor rather than their positions.\n\nHeat coach Erik Spoelstra's intentions were to tailor to player strengths rather than their position.\n\n\"We have to view this team in a different lens,\" Spoelstra said in 2012. When we try to think conventionally and put guys in certain boxes or positions, it really hamstrings us. Not only in terms of our flow but mentally too. We developed that term (position-less) just for guys to understand our versatility and how we need to play.\""
