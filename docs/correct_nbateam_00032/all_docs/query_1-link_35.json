        "text": "“THE RING’S THE THING: 50 YEARS-50 CHAMPIONS.”\n\nA daily tribute to past NBA championship teams from the 1970 New York Knicks to the 2020 Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nIn their 31st season in the NBA, the Dallas Mavericks win their first title.\n\nIn a rematch of the 2006 NBA finals with the Miami Heat, Dallas evens the score 4 games to 2.\n\nDirk Nowitzki leads the way with 27.7 points per game in the playoffs. He is named MVP of the Finals.\n\nJason Terry, Shawn Marion, JJ Barea, Tyson Chandler, Jason Kidd, DeShawn Stevenson, Brendan Haywood and Peja Stojakovic all key contributors. Rick Carlisle is the head coach.\n\nBack in the day when Chris Mullin was a freshman at Power Memorial high school in Manhattan, he played on the freshmen basketball team.\n\nThe following season Mullin played for the junior varsity team.\n\nHis teammate both years was Mario Elie.\n\nThe Panthers did not lose a single game in two years.\n\nPower also had a very good player on those teams by the name of Jesse Fong; a very underrated player.\n\nJames Harden leads the league (preseason) in scoring and assists. Nate Archibald is the only player in NBA history to lead in both. In 1973 the Bronx, New York native dropped 34 per game and dished out 11 assists per game.\n\nSteph Curry dropped 40 points in 25 minutes last night in a 143-123 win over the T-Wolves. The former Davidson Wildcat knocked down 6 3’s. Curry finished 14-19 overall from the field. The Warriors made 19-37 from distance. Draymond Green was 2-2.\n\nGood read on Detroit Country Day alum, Edmond Sumner. https://www.nba.com/pacers/news/sumner-speeds-development-slowing-down\n\n“Ed Sumner has a lot of potential, is really good,” Malcolm Brogdon said. “He’s had a terrific summer, a terrific preseason. I’m surprised about his game and his potential and level of play. I’m excited to play with him; he’s explosive.”\n\nJohn Beilein returns to the State of Michigan tonight with his new team. The Cavaliers visit L.C.A. to take on the Pistons.\n\nSolid Q&A with Dirk. https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nba/news/one-on-one-with-dirk-nowitzki-mavericks-legend-reflects-on-final-nba-season-talks-post-basketball-life/78paigfqblmx16al8sstte2ib\n\n“When you’re over 30, you need to keep a certain level of fitness during the summer, otherwise you’re behind by too much and it takes too long to get back.”\n\nMessage to Steve Kerr and Pop, let it go…Breathe in, breathe out, 3 times.\n\nHappy birthday Norm Nixon\n\nStay in the present moment and give a good day.\n\n–Steve Finamore\n\nHoops135@hotmail.com\n\nOn Dirk Nowitzki’s shooting workouts:\n\nHe’s shot millions of them in practice. In secluded gyms in the middle of nowhere. Some obscure places in Germany. I’ve been to a couple of them. They are obscure. In here at night. Last night, he was here with [mentor] Holger [Geschwindner].\n\nOf all the players I’ve been around in 30 years, whenever we’ve been in the playoffs, whether we’re home or on the road, he comes in the night before games. He goes to the venues and he shoots.\n\nIt’s religion for him to work on it and be proficient at it."
