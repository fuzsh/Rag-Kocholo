        "text": "The final seconds were ticking down. The star of the team was already making his way to the locker room to hold his own tearful celebration. The championship hats were being passed out along the bench.\n\nAnd as he was dribbling out the clock, Shawn Marion's 12-year pursuit of the ultimate basketball success had ended. He and the Dallas Mavericks were about to win their first NBA title.\n\nA week later, Marion, who played for UNLV in 1998-99 and led the Rebels in scoring (18.7) and rebounding (9.3) as a first-team All-Western Athletic Conference selection, is still trying to come to grips with what he accomplished after taking out the Miami Heat in six games.\n\n\"Honestly, it still hasn't fully sunk in,\" he said Monday. \"But it's a great feeling, and I feel so blessed.\"\n\nThe 33-year-old Marion wasn't sure if he'd ever get a championship ring. He has had a good pro career since the Phoenix Suns drafted him in 1999 with the No. 9 overall pick. He's scored 15,151 points and has averaged 16.8 points and 9.3 rebounds a game. He is a four-time All-Star.\n\nBut in order to get the ultimate prize, Marion had to make changes in his game. Coach Rick Carlisle needed him to raise his defense, which was already good, a notch higher. Offensively, the Mavericks had enough perimeter shooters in Dirk Nowitzki, Jason Terry, Peja Stojakovic and J.J. Barea. Marion needed to get more of his points closer to the basket as a post-up player.\n\n\"The offensive adjustment was harder,\" he said. \"Defense wasn't a problem. I've always been a good defensive player. But playing with my back to the basket, that was a big change.\"\n\nMarion did it without complaint. And while he averaged just 11.9 points during the Mavericks' playoff run, after averaging 12.5 points during the regular season, he contributed enough offensively when he needed to.\n\nBut Marion's real contribution came at the other end of the floor. He was able to contain LeBron James, one of the game's best scorers, during the Finals.\n\nJames, who averaged 23.7 points during the 2011 playoffs, averaged just 17.8 against Marion and the Mavericks. The 6-foot-7-inch Marion used his length to match up physically with James and not allow him to drive to the basket at will. Ultimately, he helped turn James into a jump shooter, particularly during the fourth quarter, which proved to be the Heat's undoing.\n\n\"It wasn't just me,\" Marion said. \"I had help from my teammates. DeShawn Stevenson and J-Kidd (Jason Kidd) did a great job on LeBron, too. We just tried to make it tough on him to get his points. But it was very satisfying to be able to contribute. I didn't have to score to help us win.\"\n\nMarion knew the Mavericks were talented. But he admitted he couldn't believe how unselfish they could be.\n\n\"It was such a special team the way guys played and gave up parts of their game for the team,\" he said. \"It wasn't just me. It was everybody. That's what I'll always remember about how special this team was. It was the most unselfish group of guys I've ever been with.\"\n\nAnd while Marion was happy he won a ring, he was also glad another member of the Mavericks with UNLV ties -- Tim Grgurich -- was able to be part of the championship.\n\n\"He was such a great motivator for all of us,\" Marion said of the longtime UNLV assistant to Jerry Tarkanian. Grgurich joined the Mavericks last fall as an assistant and had coached Marion in Phoenix from 2002 to 2004. \"He told us from Day One we were good enough to win the championship, and he was so supportive. I'm very happy for Coach Gerg.\"\n\nWith the NBA scheduled to meet today in New York in what could be a last-ditch attempt to avoid a July 1 lockout, Marion's dribbling out the clock in Miami might be the last actual basketball fans will see for a while. He has three years remaining on his contract with the Mavericks and is hoping for something positive to happen so the final stage of his career can continue uninterrupted.\n\n\"I have no control over it, but I hope we can get a deal done,\" he said of a new collective bargaining agreement. \"I'm planning to play out the rest of my contract as long as I can stay healthy and take care of myself.\"\n\nThere's been a lot of celebrating over the last nine days, and Marion said he is bringing the party to Las Vegas. He will hold court at Tao Nightclub on July 2 and said he's looking forward to reuniting with the many UNLV fans who have followed his NBA career.\n\n\"There's nothing like coming back to Vegas to have a party,\" he said.\n\nContact reporter Steve Carp at scarp@reviewjournal.com or 702-387-2913.
