        "text": "Cleveland Cavaliers forward Shawn Marion will retire at the conclusion of 2014-15 season, he told Paul Coro of The Arizona Republic on Wednesday. Marion, who is currently in the midst of his first season with Cleveland and 15th in the NBA, said he wanted to call it quits to spend more time with his son.\n\n\"I wanted to go out on my terms,\" Marion said. \"The biggest thing is having a son. I got attached to him. Seeing him periodically is hard. Watching him grow up on pictures and videos is hard.\"\n\nMarion, 36, was originally selected by the Phoenix Suns with the ninth overall pick in the 1999 NBA Draft. At the time, Marion says he set the goal of playing 15 seasons in the league, a feat he finally accomplished this season with the Cavaliers.\n\nHowever, being away from his 8-year-old son, Shawn, has convinced Marion that it's time to hang up the jersey. The four-time All-Star says he believes he could play another three years, but would prefer not to spend so much time away from his family.\n\n\"The Matrix\" will finish his career with a variety of incredible accomplishments, including winning an NBA championship with the Dallas Mavericks in 2011. He played a pivotal role on that title-winning team, often defending LeBron James as the Mavericks topped the Miami Heat for their first title.\n\nMarion was also named All-NBA Third Team twice (2005-06) and routinely regarded as one of the premier perimeter defenders in the game. As of his announcement Wednesday, Marion has averaged 15.4 points, 8.8 rebounds and 1.5 steals per game over 1,144 contests."
