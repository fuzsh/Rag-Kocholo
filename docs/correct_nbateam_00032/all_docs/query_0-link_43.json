        "text": "The Mavericks' Shawn Marion was praised widely for the defensive work he put forth against the Heat - and against LeBron James, in particular - through the first two games of the NBA Finals.\n\nJames said so, too ... to a point.\n\n\"I think (Marion) has done a great job,\" James said Saturday. \"I don't feel like it's one guy in this league that can stop me one-on-one. There's always a defense that's looking at me when I have the ball. He's the guy that's guarding me, but there's no one-on-one guy that can guard me.\"\n\nJames scored 44 points in the first two games on 17-of-31 shooting, but had attempted only six free throws.\n\nMarion was also a factor offensively in the first two games, averaging 18 points on 15-of-26 shooting.\n\n\"He's one of the most unique players in the game and he always has been,\" said Miami's Erik Spoelstra, who was Marion's coach during most of the 2008-09 season, until the forward was traded for Jermaine O'Neal. \"He has always said in Phoenix when they averaged 110 points a game for years that they never called a play for him, which is true.\n\n\"I would say (the Mavericks) run more plays for him - and it's only two or three a game - than he's ever had run for him in his career.\"\n\nMAVS HAVE TO DEAL WITH DANNY CRAWFORD AGAIN\n\nDanny Crawford was the lead official for Game 3.\n\nBefore these playoffs, Dallas had been a remarkable 2-16 in games officiated by Crawford during the years that Mark Cuban has owned the team. That included Game 3 and Game 6 of the NBA Finals against the Heat in 2006, both won by Miami, with the Heat shooting 22 more free throws.\n\nCrawford also handled Game 2 of the recent first-round, Dallas-Portland series. The Mavericks won that game. Also on Crawford's watch, the Mavs came back to win Game 4 of the Western Conference finals against Oklahoma City.\n\nLOVE-HATE RELATIONSHIP FOR DIRK AND TERRY\n\nIt wasn't unusual that Dirk Nowitzki and Jason Terry – the two longest-tenured Mavericks – had a heated conversation after Terry left Mario Chalmers alone in the corner late in Game 2. Chalmers converted what could have been a critical 3-pointer.\n\n\"We have kind of a love-hate relationship,\" Nowitzki said. \"We love each other, but we also argue a lot.\"\n\n\"It's a brotherly relationship,\" Terry said.\n\nIt wasn't easy for Terry to take at first, after arriving from Atlanta in 2004 to replace Nowitzki's close friend, point guard Steve Nash.\n\n\"When we first started out, he was brutal,\" Terry said. \"He was brutally honest ... and I took it hard. Because I didn't have that, coming from a losing situation in Atlanta. Guys didn't really hold each other accountable. But when it's coming from a guy who is a leader, it means a lot. You take it to heart.\"\n\nTOO MUCH REST FOR WADE'S TASTE\n\nDwyane Wade didn't like the wait for Sunday night's Game 3 after the Game 2 loss Thursday night.\n\n\"It just makes it worse,\" he said. \"But you know what? We've learned from it every time we've had a loss.\"\n\nThe Heat lost only once in each of its first three rounds against Philadelphia, Boston and Chicago."
