        "text": "the reference to Houston is a mistake, Houston and the Phi Slama Jama has nothing to do with UNLV.\n\nAbout naming the players, I could, obviously, name the whole team without looking; but I'm here for a few weeks on business. I scheduled the trip for this time on purpose though, so I could kill two birds with one stone.\n\nPlayers to look at:\n\nJovan \"Wink\" Adams, Shooting Guard, is our shooting guard and a heckuva a player. May be a bit too short to play shooting guard in the NBA, but has a good shot making it in the league as a point. Check out these videos at youtube:\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8_VCBRrSUk\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4XHJhf2iI0\n\nJoe Darger, Small Forward/Shooting Guard, is a very interesting player. He comes from a polygamous family out of Utah. His Dad has two wives, and he has 17 siblings. Joe's one of the best pure shooter's in the college game, and one of the better shooters UNLV has ever had. They call him Dagger instead of Darger because he puts the Dagger in the other team with his outside shooting.\n\nHere's a link from UNLV's tournament win last year in the first round...there's a bunch of Darger highlights:\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfFUEjhEpvg\n\nBeas Hamga, Center, is a newcomer on the team, and a legit 7 footer with great shot blocking ability. He's originally out of Africa but played high school in the states. Hamga was one of the top 10 high school center recruits in the states.\n\nHere's Beas:\n\nProviding the team is rested and adjusted from jet lag, I promise you disappointed if you come out to a game. This team was EASILY one of the best defensive teams in college basketball last year, and should be again this year. Coach Kruger was the head coach at the Atlanta Hawks for a few years, before moving to New York to be an assistant with the Knicks...before the NBA he coached 3 different colleges to the NCAA (college) tournament, and now is one of only two coaches to lead 4 different teams to the NCAA tournament. He's an incredible coach. I'm as giddy as child on Christmas morning about seeing this game tomorrow.....\n\nI only wish the Tall Blacks v. Australian National team game wasn't on at the same time. Too bad, I really want to see Mark Dickel, former UNLV point guard, play with NZ. I also want to see Ogilvy play....I'm very high on Ogilvy, he's a special player for you guys."
