        "text": "CLEVELAND (AP) Shawn Marion wanted another shot at an NBA title. He'll get it playing with LeBron James.\n\nThe free agent forward has agreed to a contract with the Cavaliers, a person familiar with the negotiations told The Associated Press on Sunday. The 36-year-old Marion informed the Cavs this weekend that he will take a minimum deal and play for them next season, said the person who spoke condition of anonymity because the contract has not been finalized.\n\nMarion also had interest in signing with the Indiana Pacers, who is looking for help after losing Paul George for the season with a broken leg.\n\nESPN.com first reported Marion's agreement with the Cavs.\n\nThe Cavs can only offer Marion a deal worth $1.4 million because they're out of room under the salary cap.\n\nA four-time All-Star, Marion gives Cleveland another veteran with postseason experience to compliment James, who is returning to the Cavs intent on winning the city's first pro championship since 1964. The team has previously signed shooters Mike Miller and James Jones, who won two NBA titles with James in Miami.\n\nCleveland is also on the brink of adding All-Star forward Kevin Love, who is expected to come over from Minnesota in a trade on or after Aug. 23. While Love gives the Cavs size, another shooter and an excellent passer, he has never played in a postseason game as a pro.\n\nMarion, on the other hand, has played in 103 NBA playoff games. He won a title as a role player with Dallas in 2011 and spent the past five seasons with the Mavericks.\n\nConsidered a strong defensive player, he's averaged 15.8 points and 9.0 rebounds during his career, which began with Phoenix in 1999. Marion was with the Suns for nine-plus seasons and worked with Cavs general manager David Griffin.\n\n(Â© Copyright 2014 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.
