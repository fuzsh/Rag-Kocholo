        "text": "What’s in a number?\n\nSome players are profoundly attached to the numbers they wear on the back of their jerseys. It can be an homage to a parent or a childhood idol. It can represent a fresh start on a new team.\n\nSometimes, players can become superstitious about their numbers, too.\n\nA lot of times, a player’s favorite number isn’t available on a new team they join, but a past one holds special meaning. They might be representing a winning tradition from their high school days or aiming to be the next big star in the city where they play.\n\nTake the No. 13.\n\nYou don’t need to look any further for the number’s meaning in Miami than Hall of Famer Dan Marino.\n\nBut it has also been worn by former Heisman Trophy winner Gino Torretta, Super Bowl VII MVP Jake Scott, former Marlins All-Star outfielder Marcell Ozuna and former major-leaguer Alex Cora at the University of Miami.\n\nHeat All-Star Bam Adebayo, however, is in the process of becoming the next big No. 13 in South Florida.\n\nIn fact, he’s already met Miami’s most famous No. 13.\n\n“Funny thing, I went to a football game once and it was alumni night,” Adebayo said. “I actually got to meet (Marino) and we talked for a little bit. He signed my jersey, it was really cool.”\n\nHere are the stories behind the Miami Heat players’ numbers:\n\nNo. 0 Meyers Leonard\n\n“A lot of people thought (I wear 0) since Dame Lillard was one of the first people to put that number on the map, but it’s not because of him. For me in my life and my career, the number means having ‘zero regrets.’ It means a fresh start and a new beginning since I started this chapter in my career here in Miami.\n\n“All my previous years in the NBA, I had 11 because it’s a number in my family where there have been big moments in our lives that have happened on the 11th of a month or you look at the clock when something has happened and it’s 11 o’clock. My wife also loved the No. 11, and she wore it in high school.”\n\nOther notable Heat players to wear No. 0: Josh Richardson (2016-19), Mike Bibby (2011).\n\nNo. 2 Gabe Vincent\n\n“I wore 2 in college (at UC Santa Barbara), but I wore No. 22 in high school (at St. Mary’s High in Stockton, Calif.) and travel ball. No. 22 was retired at UC Santa Barbara, so that is why I went with 2. When I began my professional career, I wore 22. Then, after I got my call up to the Heat in Sioux Falls, I had 35 and 50 available for me to choose from. I liked 35 better, but the Heat offered me No. 2, and I took it since it has become most meaningful to me.”\n\nOther notable Heat players to wear No. 2: Wayne Ellington (2017-19), Joe Johnson (2016), Keith Askins (1991-99), Rory Sparrow (1989-90).\n\nNo. 4 KZ Okpala\n\n“I wear 4 because it’s four of us — me and my siblings. I also wore No. 0 in the past for my brother because that was his favorite number and I looked up to him. He played high school ball in Orange County.”\n\nOther notable Heat players to wear No. 4: Rony Seikaly (1989-94), Caron Butler (2003-04), Harold Miner (1995), Josh McRoberts (2017-19).\n\nNo. 5 Derrick Jones Jr.\n\n“Where I’m from back home (Chester, Pa.), me and my guys, our little clique, we called ourselves ‘500.’ You know how people say you keep it 100 with someone? Like when you always keep it real with them? Well for us, we kept it 500 with all of us. I always keep it 500 when I do something.\n\n“When I was in Phoenix, the No. 5 was retired, so I had to wait my turn. Once I got here and it was available, there were no ifs, ands or buts about it. I was taking that number, and no one’s gonna take it from me now.”\n\nOther notable Heat players to wear No. 5: Juwan Howard (2011-13), Amar’e Stoudemire (2016), Eddie House (2001-03), Sasha Danilovic (1996-97).\n\nNo. 7 Goran Dragic\n\n“My kid, Mateo, wore that number because he thought it was a magic number, lucky seven, you know? Usually, I’ve had No. 1 and 3 most of the time with the national team or with Houston or Phoenix. I love No. 3 just like D-Wade, but I only wore it in Houston. In Phoenix, it was taken by Boris Diaw at the time. I played with No. 1 the second time I was in Phoenix because I felt like this was a new me at the time. As a kid, I wore No. 5 and that was because of Sasha Danilovic. He was my role model growing up.”\n\nOther notable Heat players to wear No. 7: Rex Chapman (1996), Lamar Odom (2004), Shawn Marion (2008-09), Jermaine O’Neal (2009-10), Penny Hardaway (2008).\n\nNo. 9 Kelly Olynyk\n\n“I didn’t wear it until I came to Miami. I liked a few things about it. There was that Drake song, ‘I turned that 6 upside-down to a 9.’ When I was a rookie in Boston, (Rajon) Rondo wore 9. He was my dude, so maybe I’m paying a little homage to him, too.\n\n“The most meaningful number to me is actually 13. Both my parents wore it when they played. One of my favorite players growing up in Toronto was Doug Christie, and he wore it. The Celtics didn’t have 13 available when I got there as a rookie, so I chose 41 and rocked that while I was there.”\n\nOther notable Heat players to wear No. 9: Dan Majerle (1997-2001), Rashard Lewis (2013-14), Luol Deng (2015-16).\n\nNo. 13 Bam Adebayo\n\n“My mom wore it in high school. I didn’t find that out until my junior year going into my senior year of summer. You know how it is: You get that last AAU tournament to play in. I wanted to put that number on for her. It felt great to me, and I’ve been wearing it ever since. The first number I wore was 24 because of Kobe Bryant. Everybody would do that fadeaway to the trash can and yell, ‘Kobe!’”\n\nOther notable Heat players to wear No. 13: Mike Miller (2011-13), Kendall Gill (2002).\n\nNo. 14 Tyler Herro\n\n“I’ve worn it since my freshman year in high school. I was 14 years old at the time. I actually changed it to No. 5 my junior year, but then I tore my meniscus, so when I got back, I switched back to 14. I’ll probably stick to 14 forever.”\n\nOther notable Heat players to wear No. 14: Daequan Cook (2008-10), Anthony Mason (2001).\n\nNo. 22 Jimmy Butler\n\n“I played (in Chicago) with one of the toughest individuals I’ve ever played with in my life — Taj Gibson. He taught me so much about how to be a pro. Sometimes people choose numbers because of someone that inspires them, and Taj is one of those people.\n\n“I wore 33 at Marquette. In high school, I wore No. 1 because of Tracy McGrady. My best friend, who’s a brother to me and (who) I moved in with, was No. 33. And as much as his family had done for me, I chose it because his mom’s favorite player was Larry Bird, and then it kind of stuck. It was all because of Larry Bird and Jordan Leslie.\n\n“I chose 21 in Chicago because I was drafted at 21. I played with a guy named Joe Fulce in junior college that wore 21. I wouldn’t have gotten in the league without him.\n\n“The number 23 (at Minnesota) was just because I was with Jordan Brand. I wasn’t comparing myself to Michael Jordan by any means. But I thought Jordan once wore 23 in Chicago and then when he moved on to another team. I was moving on from Chicago, so I thought, ‘I’m gonna take 23.’”\n\nButler is the 13th player to wear No. 22 for Miami, matching 5 and 21 as the numbers worn the most in franchise history.\n\nOther notable Heat players to wear No. 22: Brian Shaw (1992), James Jones (2009-14), John Salley (1993-95), Voshon Lenard (1996).\n\nNo. 25 Kendrick Nunn\n\n“I’m representing the city of Chicago and Simeon High. It’s been retired over there at Simeon after Derrick Rose wore it. Benjamin Wilson wore it. Nick Anderson wore it. When I left Simeon, I went to Illinois, I picked that number there, too. It means a lot especially with Wilson, who passed away (in 1984). He has a great “30 for 30” about his life that’s worth watching. It’s just a Chicago thing for me, and I’m carrying it on for them. I want to live up to that legacy.”\n\nOther notable Heat players to wear No. 25: Anthony Carter (2000-03), Wayne Simien (2006-07).\n\nNo. 28 Andre Iguodala\n\n“My birthday is on the 28th, and then there’s an inside joke I have with some friends about the number 28. There were six or seven numbers I wanted to get when I got here (to Miami), but they were retired or unavailable, so I just gave up and went with 28.”\n\nIguodala wore No. 9 from 2005 (his rookie season) until last season with Golden State. The Sixers drafted Iguodala ninth overall in the 2004 draft and he averaged 9.0 points per game that season.\n\nOther notable Heat players to wear No. 28: Iguodala is only the second Heat player to wear No. 28 joining LeRon Ellis (1996).\n\nNo. 30 Chris Silva\n\n“My coach in college at South Carolina (then-Gamecocks assistant coach Matt Figger), his wife’s dad wore that number. (Figger) told me that story that his wife’s father was an All-American in the past, and before he made it to the NBA, he died of cancer. His jersey number was No. 30. He told me that story during my freshman year because he believed in me and he said he thought I would do great things. He wanted me to wear the No. 30 when I got to the NBA and to wear it with pride.”\n\nOther notable Heat players to wear No. 30: Michael Beasley (2009-15), Norris Cole (2012-15), Billy Owens (1995-96).\n\nNo. 40 Udonis Haslem\n\n“It was my father’s number that he wore in high school until college. And it’s also the number that Tim James wore for the Miami Heat. I played AAU with (James) even before that. Tim is a Miami legend, bro. He was the original Mr. Miami (playing for Miami Northwestern and the University of Miami). He had the opportunity to stay home and play in his hometown. He was the first to do it. So I’m always paying tribute to him.\n\n“I wanted to wear No. 32 in high school at Miami High, but it was retired, so I went with No. 50. I had a lot of success with it there, and I carried that to the University of Florida.”\n\nOther notable Heat players to wear No. 40: Kurt Thomas (1996-97), Tim James (2000).\n\nNo. 44 Solomon Hill\n\n“(No. 44) has been along with me for the journey. I chose it in high school after (former Arizona State guard) Jerren Shipp had it. It’s just a number I always felt fit right for me as a player. It stuck out more than others. Growing up, I wore 55 for Jason Williams, and I’ve worn 1 before for T-Mac (Tracy McGrady). I changed it my rookie year (with the Pacers) to 9, but it didn’t feel right and I went back to 44. It just stuck with me through this whole process.”\n\nOther notable Heat players to wear No. 44: Brian Grant (2001-04), Christian Laettner (2005), Terry Davis (1990-91).\n\nNo. 55 Duncan Robinson\n\n“I always wore 2 or 20 or 22. I couldn’t use 22 when I got here because Luke Babbitt had it, and the 2 was being worn by Wayne (Ellington). So I flipped the 2’s upside down and made them 5’s to go with 55. I was a big fan of Jason Williams, too, so that was part of why. I had the 22 at Michigan, and in high school, I wore 20.”\n\nOther notable Heat players to wear No. 55: Jason Williams (2006-08), Billy Thompson (1989-91), Eddie House (2011).\n\nNo. 99 Jae Crowder\n\n“When I got traded to Boston, Rondo had number 9, and he’s one of the Boston greats so I didn’t want to disrespect him. So I chose 99 for my best friend from high school, Eric Thompson, because that was his football number. Some great players have 99 like Jason Taylor and Wayne Gretzky. People think it’s for Gretzky because I am a big hockey fan, but it’s not.”\n\nOther notable Heat players to wear No. 99: Crowder is the first player in Heat history to wear 99.\n\n(Top photo of Bam Adebayo: Brad Penner / USA Today)"
