        "text": "Dallas GM Donnie Nelson insisted the Mavericks aren’t looking to make a deal, but league sources say differently. Not that Nelson is taking a gung-ho approach to the deadline. But he is secretly seeing what he might be able to accumulate via veteran forward Shawn Marion, according to sources.\n\nShawn Marion declared last week that he would refuse to report if the Dallas Mavericks traded him to a, um, stinky situation. That’s certainly the versatile veteran forward’s right, but reasonable minds might wonder what exactly there is to like about the Mavs’ situation at the moment. “Man, I’m done talking about that,” Marion said after the Mavs’ 105-100 loss to the Atlanta Hawks at the American Airlines Center. “I don’t even want to talk about it no more, really. It doesn’t even matter. I’m here. I ain’t going nowhere.”\n\nThis past Saturday, Donnie Nelson assured three members of the media that the Dallas Mavericks will not make any trades by the Feb. 21 trading deadline unless it’s an “over the top” deal. After this morning’s shoot around at American Airlines Center, coach Rick Carlisle joined in on the party. “If you’re asking me if we’re going to trade anybody, I don’t think we’re going to,” Carlisle said. “That’s my opinion. “I don’t think we’re going to trade (Shawn) Marion, I don’t think we’re going to trade Vince (Carter), I don’t think we’re going to trade anybody. That’s my opinion.”\n\nYou can certainly understand why Marion said what he said, undoubtedly hoping to dissuade potential suitors from even inquiring about him, but the fact he can still produce like that doesn’t exactly make him undesirable. The trade deadline is Feb. 21. And what will likely keep Marion in Dallas, as much as anything, is the option year in his contract next season valued at $9.3 million. Marion will be exercising that option at season’s end no matter how Dallas’ attempt to sneak into the eighth spot in the West turns out. If Marion’s deal was expiring at season’s end, rest assured you’d be hearing trade speculation about him daily, given that the Mavericks are forced to at least consider the possibility of moving out veterans such as Marion and Vince Carter for down-the-road assets such as draft picks when they’re so far out of title contention.\n\n“At this time, I’m too old to be trying to go through and be a, you know what I’m saying, not have a chance to do anything. I’m at a point where I want to be playing for something right now.” Marion didn’t have an angry tone when he delivered this message. He was just very matter of fact about it, insisting that he isn’t going to any other team that doesn’t have a chance to contend for a title. “That’s the only way I’m going, yeah,” Marion said. “Yeah, that’s it. That’s the only possibility that could come out of that. Other than that, it ain’t happening.”\n\nTrade rumors won’t rattle Shawn Marion. The 14-year veteran, who has played for four teams, figures it’s just part of the business. Besides, Marion claims that he’d simply refuse to report if the Mavericks trade him to a bad team. “If I’m going to get traded, they’re going to tell me what’s going on and where I’m going,” Marion said. “Because if I’m going to a (expletive) situation, I’m not going. It’s just that simple."
