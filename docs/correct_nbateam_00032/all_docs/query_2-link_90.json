        "text": "Shawn Marion was a 4-time NBA All-Star and an NBA champion with the Dallas Mavericks when he retired after a 15-year career in the league. Marion played on two of the most iconic teams of the 2000s, he was an integral part of the '7 seconds or less' Pheonix Suns and a part of the 2011 Dallas Mavericks team that beat the Miami Heat Big 3 to win Dirk Nowitzki and the franchise their only title.\n\nMarion was elite as a forward, especially during his years in Phoenix when he averaged about 20 points and 10 rebounds a game between 2002 and 2007, picking up 4 All-Star selections in 5 years. However, not many fans or media members remember Marion as someone that had a massive influence on the game, something which has seemingly irked him. Speaking on a Twitter space recently, Marion went on a passionate rant about his achievements and impact.\n\n(Content Warning: Abusive language in the video below)\n\n\"That was the one thing they did to me. They talked about my motherf***ing shot. Get the f**k out of here. I was shooting 35-40% from the f**king three-point line at one point in my career. And whatever, I was a very consistent jump-shooter. So you gon' sit there and tell me you wanna talk about my motherf***ing shot but don't wanna talk about everything else I do on the f**kin floor. Get the f**k outta here, suck my d***.\n\n\"I'm averaging 20+ points and 10+ rebounds per game at 6'7 in a league that's dominated by bigs at the time. I'm talking about power forwards and centers. And I'm getting 2 blocks and I'm getting 2+ steals a game. And you wanna sit there and talk about my motherf***ing shot?\n\n\"Who got the No. 1 winning percentage in Phoenix Suns history? N****, me. I'm top 5 in almost every category in Phoenix Suns history. Go back and look at it. Numbers don't lie. I'm not talking no bullsh*t, I'm talking straight facts. I adjusted my game to every team I went on because I wanted to win. I got one of the best winning percentages in NBA history, believe that. And I'm sitting here listening to all this bullsh*t like I didn't have any impact on this game. I had a tremendous impact on this game.\"\n\nMarion feels like he gets disrespected when people talk about the greatest of his era, but that's probably also because he played in the NBA's golden era at the power forward position. When you have players like Tim Duncan, Dirk Nowitzki, and Kevin Garnett all playing the same position as you in their prime, it's understandable that a player like Marion might get overlooked."
