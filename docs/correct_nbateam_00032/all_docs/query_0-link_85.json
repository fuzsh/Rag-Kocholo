        "text": "by Marcel Mutoni\n\nA report from Yahoo! Sports yesterday re-ignited the Shawn Marion trade talk, this time adding a new twist to things: The Cavs are reportedly interested in the Heat forward, and are willing to trade Sideshow Varejao and Wally Sexyback for the Matrix’s services.\n\nThe word from the Miami press corps, as of today anyway, seems to be that Shawn isn’t going anywhere, anytime soon.\n\nFrom the Miami Herald:\n\nDespite continuous speculation he is on the verge of being traded, Heat forward Shawn Marion believes he will finish out the final season of his contract in Miami.\n\nBut two league sources said Tuesday no such deal was imminent. The Heat has fielded offers for Marion, whose $17.8 million contract expires at season’s end. But Heat president Pat Riley has publicly maintained that Marion would be key to the team this season.\n\nThe 30 year old’s numbers across the board are down this season; someone must’ve forgotten to remind him that he’s in a contract year.\n\nI must admit, however, that a LeBron-Marion combo on the wing would be a pretty amazing thing to watch."
