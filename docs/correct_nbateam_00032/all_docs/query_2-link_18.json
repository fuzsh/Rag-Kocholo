        "text": "Shawn Marion did not hold back in his rant on Twitter Spaces.\n\nHe calls out people who have criticized his jumpshot, which was far from the traditional form. Still, Marion was among the league's most effective players during his career.\n\n\"They talk about my motherf***ing shot,\" Marion said during the session. \"Don't nobody in the f***ing league shoot the same.\"\n\nMarion, nicknamed “The Matrix,” was a four-time NBA All-Star that won a championship with the Dallas Mavericks against the Heat in 2011. He was briefly with the Heat from 2008-2009 when he was acquired from Phoenix in the Shaquille O'Neal trade.\n\nDuring his 16-year NBA career, Marion averaged 15.2 points, 1.9 assists and 8.7 rebounds. Even though he was considered an elite player, he was often critiqued for his awkward shooting form.\n\n\"I'm shooting 35-40% from the f***ing 3-point line at one point in my career,\" Marion continued. \"I was a very consistent jump shooter, so you want to sit there and tell me you want to talk about my motherf***ing shot, but don't want to talk about everything else I do on the f***ing floor? Man get the f*** out of here.”\n\nMORE RELATED HEAT STORIES\n\nHeat make late-season roster moves. CLICK HERE\n\nHeat looking to move past sideline incident.
