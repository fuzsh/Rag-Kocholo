        "text": "With King James back in the fold, the rich keep getting richer in Cleveland.\n\nShawn Marion became the latest player to join the Cavaliers, when the free agent small forward committed Sunday to join the championship pursuit that began anew when LeBron James decided to return to his home state last month.\n\nA person with knowledge of his decision confirmed that he will join the Cavs, but spoke to USA TODAY Sports on the condition of anonymity because an announcement had not yet been made.\n\nMarion was reportedly considering the Indiana Pacers, Miami Heat and the Los Angeles Clippers, but will instead add his versatile, veteran ways to this Cavaliers team that – talented though it may be – was still short on playoff experience.\n\nYet with the drastic help of James' recruiting, the Cavs went to work fixing that problem in securing free agency commitments from his former Heat teammates Mike Miller and James Jones.\n\nIronically, their best addition yet, that being forward Kevin Love, has no playoff experience in his six seasons with the Minnesota Timberwolves but is nonetheless a tremendous co-star to pair with James & Co. The Cavaliers and Timberwolves have agreed to a trade that will bring Love to Cleveland, but it can not be executed until Aug. 23.\n\nNow enter Marion, the 36-year-old who has been in the playoffs in 10 of his 17 seasons and who is hoping to finish what he started with Cavaliers general manager David Griffin so many years ago. Marion, who won a championship with the Dallas Mavericks in 2011, was drafted ninth overall out of UNLV by the Phoenix Suns front office that included Griffin in 1999.\n\nHe's hardly at the 'Matrix' levels of yesteryear in terms of production, but Marion continues to produce at these late stages of his career. He started 76 of 82 games for the Dallas Mavericks team that went 49-33 last season and lost in seven games to the eventual champion San Antonio Spurs in the first round of the playoffs. Marion averaged 10.4 points, 6.5 rebounds, and 1.2 steals per game during the regular season. Marion is clearly prioritizing a chance to win another championship over chasing a bigger payday, as the Cavs can only give him a one-year, $1.4 million deal that is the veteran's minimum.\n\nThe next question for the Cavs is whether they can add Ray Allen to their mix as well. The free agent guard formerly of the Heat remains undecided on whether he will retire, and it is widely expected if he returns that it will be with the Cavaliers. ESPN.com first reported that Marion had decided to sign with the Cavs."
