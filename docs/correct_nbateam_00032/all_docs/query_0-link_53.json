        "text": "Have you ever wondered what it would be like if Shawn Marion and Cedric Ceballos were teammates? Both played for the Phoenix Suns, Dallas Mavericks, and Miami Heat in their impressive NBA careers, but never at the same time. Their careers overlapped just two seasons. I’ve never wondered what it would be like if they worked together. If you have, your itch is about the be scratched. The duo is teaming up for season 30 of The Amazing Race on CBS.\n\nThe pair will join ten other teams in tackling physical and mental challenges across the world in pursuit of a $1 million dollar prize.\n\n“I thought it was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for me, and I was like, why not? Why not go for it?” Marion said. “This is one of the shows that you really got to want to do. People love watching it, but to do it? It was more challenging than people think.”\n\nIf “Team Slam Dunk” is victorious, Marion has said he will donate his winnings to hurricane relief. He has also said that The Amazing Race may not be his final foray into the world of reality television.\n\n“It’s some stuff that you would think you could never do. It put lots of things in perspective and it made me go back to thinking about how I grew up,” he said. “It also put a different light on me because I like to travel a lot. I’ve been around the world pretty much. … There’s a couple of places I’ve never been and to see the people and the following that I have, it was pretty dope.”\n\nSeason 30 of The Amazing Race premieres Wednesday at 7pm."
