        "text": "The NBA is a complicated organization, and the players within it have very complicated lives. With Guards, Forwards, Centers, Americans, Europeans, Africans, Collegiate and Overseas players, no two careers are going to end up being the same. Some Players like Larry Bird, Dirk Nowitzki, or Kobe Bryant stay on the same team their entire careers, while some move around and take their talents to other teams. This is 10 NBA moments where a player was on a team that simply didn’t feel right.\n\n10: Hakeem Olajuwon (Toronto Raptors)\n\nHakeem Olajuwon was drafted with the first pick of the star studded 1984 draft. He would become a star for the Houston Rockets, making a one two punch with Ralph Sampson and earning the duo nickname “The Twin Towers.” He would go on to get 2 rings, 12 all star appearances, the 1994 MVP award, 6 all NBA 1st team appearances, and lead in rebounds twice and blocks thrice. Although he was of Houston Rockets fame during his career, he would go on to play his final season up north, in Toronto. Joined by Vince Carter and Tracy Mcgrady. In this curtain call, he would average 7 points, 2 rebounds and 1 assist.\n\n9: Carmelo Anthony (Houston Rockets)\n\nCarmelo Anthony has been on a lot of teams during his career. He was in his prime with the Nuggets and Knicks, then he spent some time as a roleplayer before retiring. He was brought in as he was still seen as a decent piece that could be used to enhance a bigger star, and this was during the Harden and Paul era Rockets, so the Houston front office believed they would be able to have a superteam, as this was the Golden State reign of terror where every team wanted a superteam. However, this wouldn’t quite work out, and Anthony would play only ten games in Texas before getting traded to the Trailblazers.\n\n8: Allen Iverson (Memphis Grizzlies)\n\nTo say that Allen Iverson changed the NBA forever is a severe understatement. The amount of accolades he has that show up on and off the stat sheet is absolutely insane. First player to wear cornrows on the court. Becoming an instant fan favorite for crossing up Michael Jordan. Hall of famer, 2001 MVP, 4 time scoring champion, 11 time all star, 2 time all star MVP, 7 time all NBA, 3 time NBA steals leader and 7 Time minutes leader. But think about that last one: 7 time minutes leader. SEVEN. When he was playing in Philadelphia, he was the absolute center piece of the 76ers’ offense, and it’s safe to say that the 76ers would’ve never made the 2001 finals without him. Therefore, he was run into the ground in Philly. He still had something left to give in Denver, and just the smallest amount of spark in Detroit. He would spend half of his final season in Memphis, and by this time, he was an absolute shell of his former self. He would average 12 points a game, before going back to Philly to put his career out to Pasture.\n\n7: Dennis Rodman (Los Angeles Lakers)\n\nBefore becoming a Kanye West prototype, Dennis Rodman was a hall of fame caliber baller. He started with the Pistons, being a key part in the bad boy Pistons team, with Bill Laimbeer, Isiah Thomas and Joe Dumars. He would then go to the Spurs for a little bit, before becoming a key part of the second Chicago Bulls three peat. He is widely considered to be one of the greatest rebounders of all time, and one of the greatest defenders of all time. But did you know he played for the Lakers? It would be understandable if you didn’t as he averaged only 2 points and 11 rebounds a game, playing only 23 games.\n\n6: Derrick Rose (Cleveland Cavaliers)\n\nAh yes, the one and only Derrick Rose. We all know the story, the youngest MVP ever, got injured in the playoffs with a torn ACL, was never quite the same but became a decent role player for a variety of teams. But do you remember his singular season playing with Lebron James in Cleveland? This was his second trade after the injury, and prior to this he was in New York. This was still when he was trying to return to stride after his injury, and that’s evident with his 9 1 and 1 stat sheet.\n\n5: Chris Mullin (Indiana Pacers)\n\nWhile some who only watch modern NBA games may think that Stephen Curry is the first three point shooting, team leading all star the Warriors have ever had, those who watch older games or those who use historic teams in 2K will know that before Curry, there was Chris Mullin. However, in his old age, Mullin played for a team that he would not be nearly as well known for his time on, that being the Indiana Pacers. He played on the Pacers from 1997 to 2000, before returning to Golden State for one more season before retirement.\n\n4: Karl Malone (Los Angeles Lakers)\n\nContrary to popular belief, Karl Malone was not a lifetime member of the Utah Jazz. Rather, he spent the final year of his career with the Los Angeles Lakers, playing with the likes of Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O’Neal. He would end up making the finals with this team, averaging 5 7 and 2, however he, along with the rest of the Los Angeles Lakers team, fell short to the Detroit Pistons. He would do slightly better in the regular season, however, with 13 8 and 2. Between him and Dennis Rodman, there’s definitely a trend going on here.\n\n3: Dwyane Wade (Chicago Bulls)\n\nDwyane Wade was picked 5th overall by the Miami Heat in what some consider to be the greatest draft class of all time, the 2003 draft class. Just to really drive this point home, he was drafted before players like Chris Kaman and Kyle Korver. Wade would have himself a few different runs with the likes of Shaquille O’Neal and Alonzo Mourning, before putting together one of the greatest superteams of all time: The early 2010s repeat Miami superteam, with Ray Allen, Chris Bosh, Lebron James, and Wade. However, a few years after this, Wade would have a rather forgettable stint with Chicago, before going to Cleveland, then spending his final two seasons back in Miami before retiring.\n\n2: Shawn Marion (Cleveland Cavaliers)\n\nDespite having one of the worst jumpshots in NBA history, Shawn Marion was still doing pretty well in his prime. Known for his time playing with the likes of Steve Nash and Dirk Nowitzki, many forget that he won a ring with the 2014-2015 Cleveland Cavaliers. Although he didn’t contribute much this season, with 4, 3 and no assists in the regular season, he went capital I n s, a n e INSANE in the finals for someone his age at the time, with 13, 6 and 2, helping Kyrie and Lebron way more than he’s given credit for during this series.\n\n1: Tony Parker (Charlotte Hornets)\n\nEnding with the most recent of these, Tony Parker is remembered usually for being a key piece in the San Antonio Spurs late 1990s to mid 2010s dynasty. However, for his final season, he decided to sign with the Charlotte Hornets for a 2 year, 10 million dollar deal, although he would retire after only one of the agreed upon seasons. At this point in his career, it was obvious and evident that he was slowing down, as he averaged only 9, 1 and 3, and because it’s the Hornets, he did not make the playoffs in his final season in the NBA."
