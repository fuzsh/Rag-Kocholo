        "text": "Shawn Marion’s moment in Springfield will come.\n\nShould’ve already happened.\n\nMarion was first nominated for the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame in 2019, but he’ll have to wait another year. Dwyane Wade, Dirk Nowitzki, Tony Parker, Gregg Popovich and Pau Gasol headline the 2023 inductees at Saturday's ceremony in Springfield, Mass.\n\nThose five are very familiar with “The Matrix” who was a huge part of the Phoenix Suns’ “Seven Seconds or Less” era that redefined NBA basketball by playing up tempo and utilizing small ball lineups.\n\nMarion won a championship with Nowitzki in Dallas when the Mavericks defeated Wade and the Miami Heat in 2011 and battled in the playoffs against Parker, Popovich and Gasol.\n\n'Political thing'\n\nMarion doesn’t have the gaudy stats, but he posted 17,770 career points on nearly 50% shooting (48.8%), 10,101 rebounds, 1,759 steals and 1,233 blocks in 1,163 regular season games.\n\nPutting those stats in perspective, Marion has better career numbers than 2020 Hall of Fame inductee Chris Webber (17,182 points on 47.9% shooting, 8,124 rebounds, 1,197 steals and 1,200 blocks).\n\nNow he played more games than Webber (831) and one more season, but Marion has the numbers – and a title – over someone who is already in the Hall of Fame and played in the same era.\n\nThe man who had six blocks in six career games and eight steals in another and hit five 3s in six games, let it be known back in May 2020 in an interview with The Athletic he’s Hall of Fame worthy.\n\n“I think the legacy I left for the game is there,\" Marion said. \"But who is it to decide? Who is making the decisions? What do they base it off of? If you look at all the numbers, to me, I should be a shoo-in. Should I not? What am I supposed to do? What am I not supposed to do? It's out of my control. I know it's a political thing. It's a lot more other stuff going on. But certain things, you earn that. I earned that.”\n\n'Changed the game'\n\nThen in a recent interview with Las Vegas Review-Journal last month, Marion said he “changed the game” of basketball.\n\n“I can honestly say I changed the game,” Marion said. “I was a big part of changing the game, what we’re watching right now. Small ball. Positionless basketball. It was challenging, of course. I wasn’t on board with it at first. I’m 6-foot-7, 230 pounds. You’ve got me guarding 7-footers. That wasn’t an easy adjustment. But I did it. We did it. It is what it is now. It’s what everybody’s doing now.”\n\nLet 'em know, Matrix.\n\nHis playing days are done, but Marion can continue to make his case.\n\nThe Suns finally are making that happen this season as they are inducting him and his Suns' teammate, Amar’e Stoudemire, into their “Ring of Honor.”\n\nHaving his No. 31 Suns jersey retired along with Stoudemire's No. 32 certainly helps.\n\nIt’s about time for both.\n\nHuge step towards Hall of Fame\n\nThe Suns drafted Marion out of UNLV in 1999.\n\nHe played nine of his 16 NBA seasons with Phoenix. Marion is fifth in franchise history in points (12,134), second in rebounds (6,616), steals (1,245) and third in blocks (894). His four All-Star nods (2003, 2005-07) and two All-NBA selections (third team 2005-06) came with the Suns.\n\nHaving Marion in their “Ring of Honor” this season will put him in a group that includes Naismith Hall of Famers Charles Barkley (Class of 2006), Jerry Colangelo (2004), Lowell “Cotton” Fitzsimmons (2021), Connie Hawkins (1992), Steve Nash (2018) and Paul Westphal (2019).\n\nStoudemire isn’t eligible for the Naismith until 2024, but he might make an earlier entrance than Marion. He was All-NBA five times and received six All-Star nods. He played the two-man game with Nash that led to highlight dunks.\n\nDefensive mystery\n\nMarion, on the other hand, did the dirty work.\n\nHe guarded one through five, was outmanned more than a time or two, but held his own and proved to be one of the game’s better defenders despite never making an NBA All-Defensive team.\n\nThis remains a mystery.\n\nOpening date: Durant to play before Warriors fans for first time since leaving as Suns begin season at Golden State\n\nMarion finished fifth in the voting for the league’s defensive player of the year in the 2004-05 season.\n\nThe four players who received more votes – Ben Wallace (winner), Bruce Bowen, Marcus Camby and Tim Duncan) – made an NBA all-defensive team.\n\nWallace, Bowen and Duncan were first-team selections while Camby made second team.\n\nLarry Hughes and Kevin Garnett finished sixth and ninth, respectively, for defensive player of the year, but received first-team nods.\n\nStrange voting\n\nThe second team had Camby, Chauncey Billups, Andrei Kirilenko, Tayshaun Prince, Jason Kidd and Dwyane Wade.\n\nKidd and Wade finished tied, but Kidd didn’t receive one defensive player of the year vote. Wade only got one.\n\nMarion didn’t make NBA all-defensive team despite receiving five first-place votes for defensive player of the year.\n\nMarion was a victim of playing for a team known for its offense when he instead should be looked upon as someone who drew the toughest assignment and showed teams can win big going small.\n\nThe next season, in 2005-06, Marion finished seventh in the defensive player of the year voting.\n\nOnce again\n\nThe six who received more votes – Wallace, Bowen, Kirilenko, Metta World Peace (Ron Artest), Camby and Duncan – again were voted on first or second NBA all-defensive team.\n\nWallace, Bowen, Kirilenko, World Peace were first-team selections along with Kobe Bryant and Kidd (they tied). Camby, Billups, Duncan, Garnett and Prince made second team.\n\nThen in 2006-07, Marion finished fourth for defensive player of the year, but he was once again left off the all-defensive teams.\n\nYes, it’s past redundant, but once again, the three players who received more votes – Camby, Bowen and Duncan – made first team all-defense as did Bryant and Marion’s teammate, Raja Bell.\n\nWhere did Bryant and Bell land in the defensive player of the year voting?\n\nBell finished 23rd with two points while Bryant tied for 24th with five different players at the bottom of the voting with one point.\n\nWow.\n\nBefore Draymond Green\n\nFor those still questioning Marion’s defensive value, grabbing the rebound completes a stop, right?\n\nMarion was better than pretty good at that.\n\nHe hauled in between 10.2 rebounds and a career-best 11.8 rebounds a game in four seasons. Marion averaged 9.9 in one and 9.8 in another season.\n\nBarkley is the smallest man in the NBA to win a rebounding championship as he corralled 14.6 a game with the Philadelphia 76ers in his third NBA season in 1986-87.\n\nHe was listed as 6-6, was probably 6-4-½, but Barkley most definitely weighed 250-plus pounds.\n\nDennis Rodman and Barkley are the best guys under 7 feet who battled – and won – on the boards, but Marion is in that conversation.\n\nMarion was Draymond Green before Draymond Green.\n\nOn the boards\n\nGreen will likely be a first-ballot Hall of Famer when his playing days are done.\n\nHe’s won four NBA titles playing for one the greatest NBA dynasties ever, made all-defensive team eight times and won defensive player of the year in 2016-17 the same season he led the league in steals.\n\nGreen initiates offense and sets guys up far more than Marion did, but the two both defend multiple positions – and Marion was a better rebounder.\n\nGreen has never averaged more than 9.5 rebounds in a season and is averaging just seven for his career.\n\nMarion finished his career at 8.7.\n\nGreen clearly has the rings and accolades advantage, but here’s another difference.\n\nScorer, too\n\nMarion got buckets.\n\nAveraging double figures in all but one of his 16 NBA seasons with that being his final one, Marion averaged 21 points in two seasons and 19 in three.\n\nGreen has never averaged more than 14 points in a single season. His career average is 8.7.\n\nNow here’s the whip cream to Marion’s impactful, but unappreciated, basketball resume.\n\nMarion played major minutes on a team that ran nonstop from tap to final buzzer.\n\nAveraging 34.5 minutes for his career, Marion finished in the top 10 in minutes played per game four straight seasons (2002-06) with the Suns.\n\nHe was second in minutes per game in 2003-04 at 40.7 and third in 2002-03 at 41.6.\n\nWho led the league in each of those two seasons?\n\nAllen Iverson. Hall of Famer.\n\nYep. Shawn Marion is a Hall of Famer in waiting.\n\nShouldn’t have to wait too much longer.\n\nHave opinion about current state of the Suns?
