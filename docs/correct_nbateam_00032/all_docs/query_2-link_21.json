        "text": "RETIRED NBA player Shawn Marion believes he changed the game of basketball during his 16-year career.\n\nMarion, 45, was a four-time All-Star and helped the Dallas Mavericks win the 2011 NBA Title over LeBron James and the favored Miami Heat.\n\nThroughout his career, the 6-foot-7, 230-pound Marion was known for his unorthodox shooting form.\n\nHe also played either the small or power-forward position.\n\nAfter Marion's retirement in 2015, the concept of small ball and positionless basketball only increased.\n\nIn an interview with Sam Gordon of the Las Vegas Review-Journal last month, Marion claimed he transformed basketball with his small ball style of play.\n\n“I can honestly say I changed the game. I was a big part of changing the game, what we’re watching right now,” Marion said.\n\nHe continued: “Small ball. Positionless basketball. It was challenging, of course. I wasn’t on board with it at first. I’m 6-foot-7, 230 pounds. You’ve got me guarding 7-footers. That wasn’t an easy adjustment.\"\n\nMarion added: \"But I did it. We did it. It is what it is now. It’s what everybody’s doing now.”\n\nDrafted by the Phoenix Suns with the No. 9 overall pick in the 1999 NBA Draft, Marion averaged more than 20 points per game twice (2002 and 2005).\n\nHe went on to play for four different teams and posted a career average of 15.2 points per game.\n\nIn 2018, three years after his retirement, Marion and former NBA player Matt Walsh became majority shareholders of the New Zealand Breakers of the National Basketball League in Australia.\n\nAnd Marion was first approached about the business opportunity by Walsh.\n\n“It was pretty easy to pitch me on it,” Marion said, via Forbes.\n\n“He just told me to come in, I could be the face and be a part-owner and my thought was, why not?\n\n\"It would be fun for both of us.”"
