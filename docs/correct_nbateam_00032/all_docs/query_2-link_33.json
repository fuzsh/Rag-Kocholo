        "text": "Shawn Marion on LeBron, Kobe and MJ comparisons: “Let’s just appreciate what he’s done, man. I mean, right now and I’ma leave it like this. Last time that I checked MJ was the first person to wear number #23. Is he not? So the next person to take the number #23? It was LeBron. But Kobe emulated everything MJ did on the court; from the fadeaway to all that other stuff and he truly patented his game after MJ. I don’t think LeBron ever tried to do that. I think LeBron is setting out to follow in his [MJ’s] steps to try to be the best player he can be in this generation, which he did. Because when you look at it I think it’s generational.\n\nShawn Marion: I think LeBron, by far, has been one the best athletes that we’ve witnessed to see right now and we’ve got to appreciate it. Stop trying to compare the two. If you’re really going to try to compare those two, Kobe was the closest thing skillswise to MJ, but LeBron is a different type of player. I mean, athletic-wise when you look at LeBron you don’t look at him as a scorer-scorer because he does everything on the floor, and he wants to do everything on the floor. So just appreciate it for what he’s done and how he’s doing it; going to as many NBA Finals and vice-versa and just leave it at that. I don’t think that you can compare the two. I think MJ is in his own lane just as well as LeBron is in his own lane. I got the chance to play against LeBron, Kobe and MJ and I gotta say Kobe as far as skill set and mentality is the CLOSEST thing to MJ.\n\nStoryline: GOAT Debate\n\nThe National Basketball Retired Players Association convened for its inaugural “Summer Getaway” in Las Vegas during the first three days of the NBA’s Vegas Summer League. Approximately 100 of the association’s 1,500 members attended events at Vegas Summer League, Topgolf, Cascata Golf Club and JEWEL. No matter their age, no matter their generation, they all can bond over one thing. Basketball. “It’s a fraternity,” said former NBA All-Star Shawn Marion, who played at UNLV and won an NBA title in 2011 with the Dallas Mavericks before retiring in 2015. “All the old heads paved the way for us. It’s awesome.”\n\nThe Mavericks will not ask the Pacers for compensation despite Carlisle resigning with two years remaining on his contract, sources said. Cuban did not want to complicate Carlisle’s search for a new coaching opportunity. “He is a trusted friend and a basketball soulmate,” Carlisle said of Cuban. “You occasionally come across people that change your life, and he changed my life, and he changed my family’s lives. It’s very difficult to come up with a simple statement to thank somebody for the 13 years that I’ve had with him. “I just have an amazing amount of gratitude to the city of Dallas, the Mavericks organization, all the players and coaches that I’ve had an opportunity to work with. Dirk, J-Kidd, [Jason Terry], Luka, Tyson [Chandler], Shawn Marion, J.J. Barea — there’s just so many. It would be very emotional to just try to express all the feelings that I have about it.”\n\nThe Mexican Football Federation has approved the sale of roughly 50% of Liga MX’s Club Necaxa to a group led by real estate investor Al Tylis and D.C. United executive Sam Porter. The deal, which Sportico first reported last month, values the club in the low nine-figures. It is the first major investment by Americans into Mexico’s top soccer league. The governing body’s approval was unanimous, Porter said Monday in an interview. Three NBA players—Miami Heat guard Victor Oladipo and retired All-Stars Richard Hamilton and Shawn Marion—have also joined the group as minority investors, according to Porter.\n\nCorey Brewer: “So for us, it was like ‘alright, they’re disrespecting us. And you gotta realize, we had a lot of great players on that team. We had Shawn Marion, Dirk Nowitzki, Jason Kidd, Jason Terry, DeShawn Stevenson, Brandon Haywood. We had Tyson Chandler, the big anchor back there. We had a good team, so we felt disrespected and I think that’s what we took into the Finals. If you’re going to disrespect us, we’re going to show you that we’re not to be disrespected.”"
