        "text": "News that former Maverick Shawn Marion will be retiring at the end of the season caught Tyson Chandler off guard.\n\nMarion and Chandler were teammates on the 2011 championship team and the center said he’ll always have a special bond with the man known as Matrix.\n\n“I really enjoyed my time playing with Shawn,” Chandler said. “It’s a brotherhood once you win a championship with someone. There’s always a high level of respect you have for that person because they helped you realize a lifelong dream.”\n\nMarion spent five years with the Mavericks. He became a father last season and said he wants to be able to spend as much time with his son as possible. He’s also building a waterfront house at Lake Ray Hubbard.\n\n“He’ll go down as one of the most underrated players in history,” Carlisle said. “If you look at his statistics and his success in terms of winning, he’s a great player. I know he’s beloved in Dallas and greatly appreciated there.\n\n“We went through a lot of wars together. I know he’ll be welcomed back into the community with more than open arms. He’s a special guy, a great all-around player. I don’t if I’ve ever seen a guy who can defend virtually every position on the floor at any time.”\n\nThe Mavericks likely will have some sort of tribute for Marion when he and the Cleveland Cavaliers visit on March 10."
