All this goes along with the amazing defense he’s played all his career both on the ball and off the ball (career averages of 1.1 bpg and 1.6 spg) to show how versatile Marion truly is.\n\nHe’s still going strong with solid play, and I think he’s been really under appreciated. How do you guys think he’ll be remembered once his career is over? And who could forget that picture perfect jump shot of his..\n\nI think the way he drove himself out of a lot of teams kind of tainted a lot peoples views on him. Until he came to Dallas he never really seemed happy anywhere, even at Phoenix, I remember constant reports that he would always kill morale. Im glad he found a place in Dallas that he liked, and personally out side of Dirk, I feel he was the most important player on our playoff run, especially with his defence on LeBron. Chandler did great yeah, but Marion was the one taking on the greatest player in the game on every possession down the floor\n\nI think the way he drove himself out of a lot of teams kind of tainted a lot peoples views on him.

Chandler did great yeah, but Marion was the one taking on the greatest player in the game on every possession down the floor\n\nI hate to be the bearer of bad news but he did play on a stat-stuffing Phoenix Suns team. I mean, here’s a team that’s primary goal was to shoot as many shots as they possibly could, there were a lot of rebounds to go around as well as a lot of points.\n\nI’m not taking anything away from Marion on the defensive side of the ball because he guarded the 1-4 and sometimes the 5 but let’s not get carried away when looking at his 18-10 he averaged in his Phoenix years.\n\nHe wasn’t very efficient, the guy shot 15 shots to land his 18 points, and that was playing with Steve Nash. And as you guys may know, his efficiency went even lower when he played without Nash.\n\nPoint is, he played on a stat-stuffing team where there were plenty of easy shots to go around. If he were put on a team like the Spurs throughout that decade, I don’t see him averaging more than 13-8 while taking 11 shots a game. (Still good but not a borderline HOF player like you guys are mentioning)\n\nSure, he was a great player but at the end of the day, he was playing on a team that’s sole purpose was to stuff the stat sheet, he was inefficient, and never improved his jumper from deep.\n\nI hate to be the bearer of bad news but he did play on a stat-stuffing Phoenix Suns team.
