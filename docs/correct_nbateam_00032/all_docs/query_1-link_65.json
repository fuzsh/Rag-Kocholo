        "text": "MARCH 18 BRUNSON WINS PLAYER OF THE WEEK\n\nJalen Brunson has earned some accolades for a productive three-game stretch, as the New York Knicks point guard has been named the Eastern Conference Player of the Week. It's Brunson's fourth weekly award of his career and his third this season, all coming with the Knicks.\n\nBrunson earned this latest honor with a dominant scoring effort, averaging 35.7 points on over 54 percent shooting over the past three games, all Knicks victories. The start of a four-game Western Conference road trip saw Brunson make franchise history, as he became just the fourth Knick to score at least 40 points in consecutive games, joining an illustrious group that also features Carmelo Anthony, Patrick Ewing, and Bernard King.\n\nMARCH 16 GIBSON SIGNS WITH PISTONS FOR REST OF YEAR\n\nIf Taj Gibson is coming back to the New York Knicks, that reunion won't be happening this year.\n\nPer ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski, Gibson is set to sign with the Detroit Pistons for the rest of the 2023-24 season after joining the team on a 10-day deal earlier this month.\n\nThe 38-year-old Brooklyn native partook in 16 games with the Knicks this season (1 start), returning to the team after spending the first three seasons of the Tom Thibodeau era in blue and orange. Gibson's name has lingered in the Knicks' minds, as some have labeled him a potential assistant coach in the future. He previously signed two 10-day deals with the Knicks, the most a player can sign with a single team during a season.\n\nMARCH 14 KNICKS SIGN TWO TO 10-DAYS\n\nThe New York Knicks announced on Thursday that DaQuan Jeffries and Mamadi Diakite to 10-day contracts.\n\nJeffries has been in and out of the Knicks' system over the past two years and appeared in 13 games with the NBA club earlier this season. In that (playing just under three minutes a game), Jeffries averaged 0.8 points and 0.4 rebounds while getting most of his work done on the G League level, where he's putting up 22 and 5.9 respectively in 14 regular season appearances with Westchester.\n\nJoining Jeffries is Diakite, who was also stationed in Westchester and averaging 12 points and 8.6 rebounds in seven showings. Diakite previously made 14 appearances with the Milwaukee Bucks' championship group in 2021 and also partook in three games with the San Antonio Spurs earlier this season.\n\nMARCH 12 PAYNE REPORTEDLY FIRED BY LOUISVILLE\n\nPer insider Jeff Goodman of Field of 68, the Lousiville Cardinals men's basketball program is expected to part ways with head coach Kenny Payne.\n\nThe 57-year-old spent the first two seasons of the New York Knicks' Tom Thibodeau era as an assistant coach and struggled mightily at the helm of the Cardinals, going 12-53 in two seasons (including 5-35 in ACC play). If this is truly the end for Payne, his tenure ended with a 94-85 loss to North Carolina State in the opening round of the ACC Tournament.\n\nMARCH 11 MAXEY RETURNS FOR DOUBLEHEADER CLOSER VS KNICKS\n\nThe Philadelphia 76ers will be taking it to the Max as they go for a sweep of a speedy doubleheader with the New York Knicks on Tuesday night (7:30 p.m. ET, TNT)\n\nPer ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski, Maxey has cleared concussion protocol and will return on Tuesday against the Knicks after a four-game absence. Maxey, fresh off All-Star honors, is averaging 26 points and a team-best 6.3 assists and has mostly been tasked with carrying the load in the wake of Joel Embiid's continued departure.\n\nPhiladelphia (36-28) currently ranks sixth in the Eastern Conference playoff hunt after earning a 79-73 victory over the Knicks on Sunday night at MSG. Tuesday's game will be the fourth and final meeting between the divisional rivals this season.\n\nMARCH 9 PACERS' MATHURIN DONE FOR THE YEAR\n\nPer ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski, the Indiana Pacers will lose rising star Bennedict Mathurin for the rest of the season. The sophomore depth piece has opted to undergo shoulder surgery, was averaging 14.5 points on over 44 percent shooting in 59 appearances this season.\n\nIndiana (35-29) is at the tail-end of a five-team logjam led by the Knicks in a train that takes up the fourth-through-eighth spots in the current Eastern Conference standings. The Pacers face No. 5 Orlando on Sunday evening (6 p.m. ET, Bally Sports Indiana).\n\nMARCH 6 GIBSON SIGNS 10-DAY WITH PISTONS\n\nIn a bit of a twist, the Detroit Pistons are now signing former New York Knicks.\n\nPer ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski, Detroit is set to sign Taj Gibson to a 10-day contract. Gibson, 38, previously signed two such deals with the Knicks and averaged 1.8 rebounds and 1.0 points in 16 appearances this season. Prior to his Detroit entry, Gibson hinted that he would mind yet another stop with the Knicks, who previously hosted him for three full seasons (2019-22).\n\nMARCH 3 DONOVAN MITCHELL QUESTIONABLE VS. KNICKS\n\nThe New York Knicks are set to face the Cleveland Cavaliers tonight, but they may be granted a reprieve.\n\nCavaliers All-Star Donovan Mitchell is questionable for the game, according to coach J.B. Bickerstaff.\n\nMitchell sat out of Friday's game with a knee injury, which could hold him out again tonight.\n\nThe Knicks and Cavs are set to tip off at 7 p.m. ET on ESPN.\n\nFEBRUARY 26 PAUL POISED TO PLAY THURSDAY VS KNICKS\n\nThe New York Knicks' upcoming interconference showdown with the Golden State Warriors is poised to gain a little extra star power: per Shams Charania of The Athletic, Paul is set to return to the Warriors Tuesday tilt against the Washington Wizards, which would put him on pace to play two nights later against the Knicks.\n\nPaul, 38, has not played since Jan. 5 due to a fractured hand. Golden State has begun to get it together in his absence, posting a 12-9 record in that span and establishing high ground above the Western Conference elimination picture.\n\nFEBRUARY 25 PELICANS LOSE ALVARADO FOR TUESDAY VS KNICKS\n\nThe New Orleans Pelicans will be missing one of their reserves for their Tuesday night visit to Madison Square Garden.\n\nJose Alvarado was one of five players disciplined by the NBA on Sunday for their roles in an altercation that marred a Saturday game between the Pelicans and Miami Heat. Alvarado was dealt one of the biggest punishments, suspended three games (along with Miami's Thomas Bryant) for leaving the bench area to join a fracas ignited by Kevin Love's hard foul on Zion Williams in the opening minute of the fourth quarter. That will keep Alvarado out of the Pelicans' Tuesday game against the Knicks, as well as a Wednesday visit to Indiana. The suspensions begin on Sunday, as the Pelicans are facing the Chicago Bulls (Naji Marshall also was charged one game).\n\nMiami (who also lost Jimmy Butler and Nikola Jovic for a game) won Saturday's game 105-96.\n\nFEBRUARY 23 ARCIDIACONO BACK WITH BULLS ORGANIZATION\n\nThis Cat won't be coming home, at least not this season.\n\nPer Michael Scotto of Hoops Hype, Ryan Arcidiacono has returned to the Chicago Bulls organization, signing with G League Windy City on Friday. While he played sparingly in New York, Arcidiacono has earned a bit of a cult following among Knicks thanks in part to his friendships with college teammates Jalen Brunson, Donte DiVincenzo, and Josh Hart. The quartet served as stars at Villanova University and partook in a run to the 2016 national championship.\n\nArcidiacono spent the first four seasons of his professional career (2017-21) within the Bulls organization, playing for both Chicago and Windy City. The best season of his professional career came with the Bulls in 2018-19, as he appeared in 81 games (32 starts) and averaged 6.7 points and 3.3 rebounds.\n\nWindy City is coming off a 98-84 win over the Knicks' affiliate from Westchester on Thursday. It'll return to action with Arcidiacono in tow on Saturday at home against the Indiana Mad Ants (9 p.m. ET, Tubi).\n\nFEBRUARY 20 NETS SIGN KNICKS G LEAGUER MARTIN\n\nPer The Athletic's Shams Charania, the Brooklyn Nets are set to sign Jaylen Martin from the roster of the New York Knicks' G League affiliate in Westchester. By moving to Brooklyn, Martin reunites with new Nets head coach Kevin Ollie, who served as his supervisor at Overtime Elite prior to his professional entry.\n\nMartin a protege of former Knicks star Charlie Ward in high school, averaged 15 points on over 54 percent from the field in 15 regular season appearances (8 starts) with Westchester and scored 39 in three appearances with New York's Summer League group in Las Vegas.\n\nFEBRUARY 19 NETS FIRE VAUGHN, OLLIE TO SERVE AS INTERIM\n\nThe New York Knicks' cross-borough rivals are making a change in the head coaching spot.\n\nJacque Vaughn was fired as the head coach of the Brooklyn Nets on Monday, removed after a season-plus of his second term with the team. Assistant coach Kevin Ollie, who previously played for the Nets' New Jersey incarnation and guided the University of Connecticut to a national championship in 2014, will take over on an interim basis.\n\nVaughn, 49, amassed a 64-65 record over the last two seasons and guided the Nets into the sixth seed of last year's playoffs, where they were swept by Philadelphia. He previously served as the Nets' interim boss at the end of the 2019-20 season following the firing of Kenny Atkinson. Per SNY's Ian Begley, \"several players had lost confidence in Vaughn amid the Nets’ struggles and that his presence \"could hinder their chances at landing a top player.\"\n\nThe Nets (21-33) are working through their first full season since moving on from their core led by Kevin Durant and James Harden. Brooklyn lost 18 of its final 24 under Vaughn, including a 50-point blowout loss at the hands of the Boston Celtics last Wednesday night.\n\nOllie's first game at the helm lands on Thursday when the Nets head north to face the Toronto Raptors (7 p.m. ET, YES). Two visits to Madison Square Garden linger on the schedule, the first coming on March 23.\n\nFEBRUARY 15 KNICKS EX GALLINARI JOINS MILWAUKEE\n\nThe Milwaukee Bucks have signed a former New York Knick to prepare for a crucial stretch run.\n\nPer ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski, Milwaukee has added Danilo Gallinari on a contract that runs through the rest of the season. Thus continues Gallinari's 16th NBA season, one that began with the Washington Wizards after he was involved in the deal that sent Kristaps Porzingis to Boston. He was involved in another trade in January when he and Mike Muscala were sent to Detroit but was released last week.\n\nThe Bucks (35-20) currently sit in third place in the Eastern Conference, two games ahead of the Knicks in fourth.\n\nFEBRUARY 9 TAJ GIBSON SIGNS NEW CONTRACT WITH KNICKS The New York Knicks are bringing Taj Gibson back for another run.\n\nAfter his 10-day contract expired, The Athletic's Fred Katz reported that the team has signing Gibson to another. With the frontcourt devastated by injuries to Isaiah Hartenstein and Julius Randle, Gibson played 13 minutes on Tuesday against the Memphis Grizzlies and 22 minutes last night against the Dallas Mavericks.\n\nFEBRUARY 6 EMBIID OUT FOR KNICKS' VISIT, FORESEEABLE FUTURE\n\nThe Philadelphia 76ers won't have the reigning NBA MVP on their side for the foreseeable future.\n\nPhiladelphia announced that Embiid underwent a knee procedure on Tuesday morning and will be out for at least four weeks before being reevaluated. That wipes out the possibility of Embiid facing the New York Knicks on Feb. 22, which will serve as the first post-All-Star break game for each side. Embiid will also need a replacement for the All-Star Game itself, as he was selected to be one of the five Eastern Conference starters.\n\nPer ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski, \"there's belief that the door remains open for Embiid's return in the regular season.\" The 76ers (30-19) currently sit in fifth place in the Eastern Conference and are mired in a severe rut, having dropped six of their past seven. Entering Tuesday night, the Sixers are 1.5 games behind the Knicks for fourth and 3.5 ahead of Orlando and Eastern Play-In Tournament territory.\n\nPhiladelphia returns to action Wednesday night at home against the Golden State Warriors (7:30 p.m. ET, ESPN).\n\nFEBRUARY 5 BRUNSON'S FOUR FOR THREE-POINT CONTEST REVEALED\n\nNew York Knicks point guard Jalen Brunson will face some stiff competition as he seeks to become the first Manhattanite to win the NBA's Three-Point Contest.\n\nPer Shams Charania, Brunson will be joined by Malik Beasley (Milwaukee), Tyrese Haliburton (Indiana), Damian Lillard (Milwaukee), and Lauri Markkanen (Utah). In addition to facing Haliburton, who will have fans on his side as a member of the hosting Indiana Pacers, Brunson will face the fifth-most accurate three-pointer shooter this season (Beasley), the event's defending champion (Lillard), and the most recent Most Improved Player (Markkanen).\n\nThe Three-Point Contest will be staged on Feb. 17 at Lucas Oil Stadium as part of All-Star Saturday.\n\nFEBRUARY 4 JOEL OUT\n\nThe Knicks are presently in the No. 4 slot in the NBA East, with the Philadelphia 76ers in the No. 5 slot.\n\nFor the Sixers, that is likely about to change, as center Joel Embiid will undergo an knee surgery this week, with the Sixers not yet saying how long the MVP candidate might be out.\n\nThe 76ers are 4-10 without Embiid this season.\n\nEmbiid is the NBA’s leading scorer at 35.3 points per game and is averaging 11.3 rebounds and 5.7 assists.\n\nJANUARY 29 BALL OUT MONDAY VS KNICKS\n\nThe Charlotte Hornets announced that LaMelo Ball (ankle) will not appear in Monday night's game against the New York Knicks (7 p.m. ET, MSG), keeping him sidelined for the second consecutive game. Ball, who has appeared in only 22 games this season, is the Hornets' leading scorer at 23.9 points a game, scoring a combined total of 66 in two prior matchups against the Knicks this year.\n\nJANUARY 29 \"OPTIMISM\" FOR HALIBURTON'S RETURN FOR MSG VISIT\n\nIf things keep trending in the current direction, there will be no shortage of star power and headlines for the New York Knicks' Thursday night tilt against the Indiana Pacers.\n\nPer ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski, Tyrese Haliburton is set to make his return from injury when the Pacers face the Boston Celtics on Tuesday night (7:30 p.m. ET, TNT), which would put him on pace to partake in the Thursday visit to Madison Square Garden.\n\nHaliburton has missed 10 of the last 11 games with a hamstring injury and was recently named a starter for the Eastern Conference for the upcoming NBA All-Star Game, which will be held in Indianapolis. Thursday will also mark Obi Toppin's first visit to MSG since a July trade sent him to Indianapolis in exchange for two draft picks.\n\nJANUARY 27 REDDISH OUT TWO WEEKS, WILL MISS MSG VISIT\n\nThere will be no homecoming for Cam Reddish next weekend.\n\nPer ESPN's Dave McMenamin, the Los Angeles Lakers forward will miss at least the next two weeks with a right ankle sprain. While Reddish will be re-evaluated at that point, that will definitely keep him out of the Lakers' upcoming visit to Madison Square Garden next Saturday. It would've been Reddish's first time at MSG since the Knicks traded him to the Portland Trail Blazers for Josh Hart.\n\nReddish, 24, had found a bit of a defensive niche in Los Angeles as he seeks to reclaim the narrative on his NBA career after struggling to live up to his top 10 pick billing in Atlanta, New York, and Portland. He appeared in 35 games (8 starts) in parts of two seasons with the Knicks, averaging 7.4 points and 1.5 rebounds.\n\nJANUARY 26 JOKIC TO MISS EMBIID SHOWDOWN AFTER EYE POKE VS KNICKS?\n\nThe defending champion Denver Nuggets might have endured big losses in more ways than one on Thursday night.\n\nDenver was on the wrong end of a 112-84 shellacking at the hands of the New York Knicks at Madison Square Garden despite a 31-point, 11-rebound out from two-time MVP Nikola Jokic. While Jokic did lose seven turnovers in defeat, his 13-of-18 shooting output from the field was perhaps made all the more impressive by the fact he was nursing an eye injury over the latter stages of the game after he was accidentally poked Donte DiVincenzo. Jokic was able to finish the game, but Tim Bontemps of ESPN offered a scary update in the aftermath.\n\n\"Nikola Jokic's eye was clearly red after getting accidentally poked in it by Donte DiVincenzo in the first half of tonight's game,\" Bontemps wrote on X. \"He said after it initially felt better, it felt worse postgame.\"\n\nBontemps said it was \"unclear\" whether Jokic would have to sit out of the Nuggets' next game on Saturday, as he was set to face fellow MVP Joel Embiid in a nationally televised showdown against the Philadelphia 76ers (5:30 p.m. ET, ABC).\n\nJANUARY 23 BUCKS FIRE ADRIAN GRIFFIN, DOC RIVERS TO FOLLOW?\n\nOne of the Eastern Conference's most prolific contenders is making a coaching change.\n\nPer Adrian Wojnarowksi and Shams Charania, the Milwaukee Bucks have dismissed first-year head coach Adrian Griffin after only 43 games at the helm. Both have also reported that the Bucks (30-13) could have eyes on former Knick Doc Rivers, who is currently stationed among ESPN's lead broadcasting group alongside Mike Breen and Doris Burke. Joe Prunty is expected to take over as the team's interim boss in the meantime.\n\nEntering Tuesday night play, the Bucks sit in second place in the Eastern Conference, 3.5 games behind top-ranked Boston. Griffin was in his first year with the team after the dismissal of Mike Budenholzer following an upset loss to eighth-seeded Miami in the opening round of last year's playoffs. The Bucks had won their past two games but swept a back-to-back over lowly Detroit by a mere 15 points combined.\n\nMilwaukee owns a 3-1 record against the Knicks this season with one more match scheduled for April 7 at Fiserv Forum.\n\nJANUARY 17 SIAKAM TO PACERS IN TRADE WITH RAPTORS\n\nThe Indiana Pacers shored up their playoff prospects with help from one of the New York Knicks' division rivals and previous collaborators.\n\nPer ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski, Indiana has obtained two-time NBA All-Star Pascal Siakam from the Raptors in exchange for Bruce Brown Jr., Jordan Nwora, and three first-round picks. Siakam now joins an Indiana group battling the Knicks for postseason real estate and trying to hold its own since the injury to Tyrese Haliburton. Indiana (23-17) has gone 2-2 in Haliburton's absence.\n\nIn the midst of his eighth NBA season, Siakam averaged 22.2 points and 6.3 rebounds over 39 games with the Raptors this season. He was part of the Raptors' 2018-19 championship and has led the NBA in minutes per game in each of the last two seasons.\n\nEntering Wednesday night play, the Pacers and Knicks are tied for the last of the six automatic Eastern Conference playoff spots.\n\nJANUARY 9 MORANT OUT VS. KNICKS, DONE FOR SEASON\n\nJa Morant's season is over almost as suddenly as it began.\n\nThe Memphis Grizzlies announced that their embattled franchise face will miss the remainder of the 2023-24 season after suffering a \"subluxation of his right shoulder,\" per a team release. Morant, who had recently returned from a 25-game suspension for several firearm-related incidents, averaged 25.1 points and 8.1 assists in nine appearances this season.\n\nMemphis (13-23) posted a 6-3 record in games where Morant was on the floor. The Grizzlies are set to face the New York Knicks on Saturday in the latter half of a weekend back-to-back at home, which begins on Friday against the Los Angeles Clippers (8 p.m. ET, Bally Sports Southeast).\n\nJANUARY 8 HALIBURTON HELPED OFF VS CELTICS, DIAGNOSED WITH HAMSTRING STRAIN\n\nIndiana Pacers star Tyrese Haliburton, has been ruled out for the remainder of Monday's game against the Boston Celtics with a hamstring strain, the team announced.\n\nHaliburton, one of the NBA's most prominent breakout stars of the 2023-24 season and the current leader in All-Star Game fan votes among Eastern Conference guards, slipped on a drive during first quarter action and required teammates to carry him off the floor and into the locker room.\n\nIndiana leads Boston 103-101 after three quarters.\n\nJANUARY 7 KNICKS WAIVE GIBSON\n\nPer Fred Katz of The Athletic, the New York Knicks will waive center/forward Taj Gibson. A longtime follower of head coach Tom Thibodeau, Gibson was brought into Manhattan to add size in the wake of Mitchell Robinson's injury, returning to New York after three prior seasons in New York (2019-22). In 10 games, Gibson averaged 1.4 points and 1.8 rebounds in just under 10 minutes a game.\n\nJANUARY 6 KNICKS G LEAGUER LANDS TWO-WAY WITH LAKERS AFTER BIG GAME IN WESTCHESTER\n\nThe Westchester Knicks fell on Friday but Dylan Windler emerged as one of the biggest winners of Friday's NBA G League action.\n\nWindler set a G League record with 33 rebounds in a single game, pairing it with 22 points in a 128-121 loss to Philadelphia's affiliate from Delaware on Friday night. ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski has since reported that Windler has signed a two-way deal with the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nA first-round pick of Cleveland's in 2019, Windler appeared in three games for the Knicks this season, all in mop-up duty. He averaged 13.5 points and shot over 37 percent from three-point range in Westchester's victorious run to the G League Showcase Cup over the holiday season.\n\nJANUARY 1 KNICKS WAIVE DMYTRO SKAPINTSEV\n\nPer Fred Katz of The Athletic, the Knicks have waived Dmytro Skapintsev, opening up one of their two-way contract slots. Skapintsev was called up from G League Westchester to shore up interior depth after Mitchell Robinson's potentially season-ending injury.\n\nThe Ukranian-born center appeared in two NBA games, the first of his career, and is averaging 5.9 points with 4.4 rebounds in 13 games with the Knicks' prospects this year.\n\nDECEMBER 30 TORONTO'S BARRETT/ QUICKLEY ERA UNOFFICIALLY BEGINS WITH LOSS\n\nHours after they traded for former Knicks stars RJ Barrett and Immanuel Quickley, the Toronto Raptors ended up on the wrong side of history.\n\nCade Cunningham (30 points, 12 assists) and Jalen Duren (18 points, 17 rebounds) each had double-doubles as the Detroit Pistons ended their NBA record-tying 28-game losing streak with a 129-127 victory over Toronto. It marks the Pistons' first win since Oct. 28.\n\nNeither Barrett nor Quickley played for undermanned Toronto (13-19), which was paced by 32 points for Pascal Siakam. The Raptors return to action at home on Monday night against the Cleveland Cavaliers (7 p.m. ET, Sportsnet)\n\nDECEMBER 28 A-ROD SET TO TAKE CONTROLLING INTEREST OF T'WOLVES\n\nIt's a Woj Bomb for A-Rod.\n\nPer ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski, former New York Yankees star Alex Rodriguez is set to take over a controlling interest in the Minnesota Timberwolves and Minnesota Lynx franchises alongside his business partner, Staten Island-born entrepreneur Marc Lore, pending NBA Board of Governors approval. The duo previously purchased minority shares of the teams from current owner Glen Taylor in 2021.\n\nRodriguez, 48, is a 14-time MLB All-Star and is perhaps best known for his 12-year tenure with the Bronx Bombers. He takes over the Timberwolves as the team has ascended to the top of the Western Conference standings behind the efforts of young stars Anthony Edwards and Karl-Anthony Towns.\n\nDECEMBER 27 BULLS' VUCEVIC OUT A WEEK; PLAY VS. KNICKS?\n\nChicago Bulls center Nikola Vucevic is hitting the sidelines for a bit.\n\nAccording to The Athletic's Shams Charania, Vucevic is dealing with a groin strain that will keep him out for 7-10 days, cutting it close for the Bulls' visit to Madison Square Garden on Jan. 3. The Knicks have dealt with interior injury issues of their own, potentially losing starter Mitchell Robinson for the season with an ankle ailment.\n\nDECEMBER 24 ANTETOKOUNMPO PROBABLE FOR CHRISTMAS\n\nGiannis Antetokounmpo is on the Milwaukee Bucks' injury report as the team prepares to make its way back to Madison Square Garden for a Christmas Day showdown with the New York Knicks (12 p.m. ET, ESPN). Antetokounmpo is listed as probable with a foot sprain but is expected to partake in the fourth showdown with New York. Elsewhere on the Bucks' ailment list, MarJon Beauchamp (elbow) is also probable while Jae Crowder (adductor) is out.\n\nDECEMBER 23 KNICKS ADJUST TWO-WAY DEALS\n\nTo help combat Mitchell Robinson's injury, the New York have adjusted their two-way contracts, signing Dmytro Skapintsev and waiving Jaylen Martin. New York has sought frontcourt depth following reports that Robinson (ankle) may be done for the season and that Jericho Sims (ankle) will miss a week or two.\n\nSkapintsev, 25, has spent the past two seasons with the Knicks' G League affiliate in Westchester and was one of the relative breakout stars of the team's most recent Summer League showing in Las Vegas. In 13 games with Westchester this season, which recently ended in a G League Showcase Cup title, Skapintsev has avered 5.9 points and 4.4 rebounds. He averaged 7.4 points and 6.6 rebounds in just over 17 minutes off the bench in Summer League action.\n\nMartin, 19, became somewhat well-known to Knicks fans for playing under former mainstay Charlie Ward at Florida State University School in his native Tallahassee. He had not appeared in any games for the NBA club but has averaged 9.7 points and 2.9 rebounds in 16 appearances (5 starts) with Westchester.\n\nDECEMBER 22 WESTCHESTER WINS G LEAGUE SHOWCASE CUP\n\nThe Westchester Knicks, New York's affiliate in the NBA G League, have prevailed in the Showcase Cup in-season competition by topping the Indiana Mad Ants 107-99 on Friday night in Orlando. Jacob Toppin led the way with 23 points for Westchester, just ahead of the 20 for Charlie Brown Jr. Both Dylan Windler (16 points, 16 rebounds) and Brandon Goodwin (13 points, 13 assists). Former New York Knick Elfrid Payton had 10 points and six assists for the Mad Ants, the Indiana Pacers' prospects.\n\nIn a broader standings sense, Westchester (13-4) has won three in a row and currently sits atop the G League's East division. They'll return to action against Toronto's affiliate, Raptors 905, on Wednesday night at Westchester County Center (7 p.m. ET, ESPN+).\n\nDECEMBER 18 LEBRON, AD QUESTIONABLE VS. KNICKS\n\nThe New York Knicks play the second of their Tinseltown games tonight against the Los Angeles Lakers (10:30 p.m. ET, MSG), and they may not have to play two of their opponent's best players.\n\nLeBron James (calf) and Anthony Davis (adductor, hip) are both listed as questionable for tonight's game. They join Christian Wood (illness) in the questionable category. D'Angelo Russell (illness) and Jarred Vanderbilt (back) are probable. Jalen Hood-Schifino (back) and Gabe Vincent (knee) are out.\n\nDECEMBER 16 PAUL GEORGE QUESTIONABLE VS. KNICKS\n\nThe New York Knicks are back in action on Saturday against the Los Angeles Clippers (10:30 p.m. ET, MSG), who could be playing without one of their best players as Paul George (groin, hip) is listed as questionable on the injury report.\n\nGeorge missed Thursday's game against the Sacramento Kings and could be in danger of missing his second consecutive game.\n\nDECEMBER 16 BRADLEY BEAL LEAVES GAME VS KNICKS\n\nThe Phoenix Suns' big three era ended as quickly as it began.\n\nPoint guard Bradley Beal left Friday's game between the Suns and New York Knicks with a right ankle injury, landing awkwardly on a defending Donte DiVincenzo on a successful three-pointer attempt in the first period. Phoenix has since ruled Beal out for the remainder of the game.\n\nFriday marked only the second game where the Suns had all three members of their headlining trio available, with Beal joined by Devin Booker and Kevin Durant. DiVincenzo was charged with a flagrant foul upon review and Beal briefly stayed in the game to sink a successful free throw attempt before he was replaced by Nassir Little.\n\nDespite Beal's absence, Phoenix leads the Knicks 99-97 heading into the fourth quarter.\n\nDECEMBER 15 DYLAN WINDLER SIGNS WITH G LEAGUE WESTCHESTER\n\nThe New York Knicks parted ways with Dylan Windler earlier this week upon signing Taj Gibson, but it appears he'll be sticking around the organization in a different role.\n\nThe Westchester Knicks announced that they had signed Windler, and he was in the starting lineup for the team in its game tonight against the Capital City Go-Go. Windler, a 2019 first-round pick of Cleveland's, appeared in three games with the NBA club this season.\n\nDECEMBER 13 KNICKS WELCOME BACK GIBSON\n\nPer ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski, the New York Knicks have re-added forward Taj Gibson on a one-year deal. Gibson, a Brooklyn native, previously partook in three seasons with the Knicks (2019-22) and served with the Washington Wizards last year.\n\nThe signing of the 6-9 Gibson should help shore up the Knicks' size in the wake of Mitchell Robinson's injury; the starting center is set to miss 8-to-10 weeks after undergoing ankle surgery.\n\nNew York (13-9) returns to action on Wednesday night when they face the Utah Jazz (9 p.m. ET, MSG).\n\nDECEMBER 10 FEVER LAND TOP PICK AT WNBA DRAFT\n\nThe Indiana Fever hit the jackpot at the 2024 WNBA Draft Lottery on Sunday late afternoon, as they were bestowed the top pick that many foresee being used on Iowa point guard Caitlin Clark. Indiana was represented by last year's top overall pick and reigning WNBA Rookie of the Year Aliyah Boston. The Fever had the top odds based on a cumulative two-year record of 18-58 and beat out the Phoenix Mercury, Los Angeles Sparks, and Seattle.\n\nIn local affairs, the New York Liberty hold the 11th pick in the draft, which will be held on Apr. 15.\n\nDECEMBER 8 DIVINCENZO STARTS OVER GRIMES IN BOSTON\n\nThe New York Knicks adjusted their starting lineup on Friday night against Boston, inserting Donte DiVincenzo at shooting guard over Quentin Grimes. DiVincenzo, a first-year Knicks, previously made two starts in place of an injured Grimes on Nov. 17-18 in Washington and Charlotte.\n\nGrimes had been in the Knicks' starting lineup in each of his last 83 regular season appearances, having been a staple among the five since taking over for Evan Fournier in the early stages of last season. The third-year man and 2021 first-round pick had recently expressed concerns with his role on the current team and had been struggling since returning from the aforementioned two-game absence due to a wrist injury (averaging 2.3 points on less than 18 percent from the field over the past seven).\n\nThe Knicks trail Boston 33-32 after the first quarter.\n\nDECEMBER 8 PORZINGIS AVAILABLE FOR EXTRA CELTICS SHOWDOWN\n\nThe Boston Celtics announced that Kristaps Porzingis (calf) will be available for Friday night's showdown against his original NBA employers, the New York Knicks, at TD Garden (7:30 p.m. ET, MSG/NBA TV). Porzingis, in the midst of his first season in Boston, has not played since Boston's Nov. 24 loss to Orlando.\n\nThe Knicks have felt Porzingis' wrath in their first two meetings against the Celtics: the eighth-year Latvian professional has earned a combined 51 points (on over 57 percent shooting from the field) and 14 rebounds in that first couple, both Boston victories.\n\nDECEMBER 7 LAVINE OUT AMIDST TRADE RUMORS\n\nChicago Bulls guard Zach LaVine will miss extended action amidst trade rumors, as the team announced he would be missing three-to-four weeks due to a foot injury on Wednesday night after a 111-100 win over Charlotte. LaVine had missed the past three games, all Chicago victories, with the ailment.\n\nAs the Bulls (8-14) continue to falter outside the Eastern Conference postseason picture, the idea of tearing things down has become more prevalent and the Knicks have lingered in the gossip mill for the services of either LaVine or DeMar DeRozan. LaVine, a Klutch Sports client, is reportedly uninterested in coming to the Knicks due to president Leon Rose's connections to Creative Artists Agency.\n\nDECEMBER 4 RANDLE WINS EASTERN CONFERENCE POTW\n\nJulius Randle is tipping off the holiday season on a high note, as the New York Knicks' two-time All-Star forward has been bestowed the Eastern Conference's Play of the Week Award for the span of Nov. 27 through Dec. 3. Randle is the second New Yorker to earn the honor this season, joining Jalen Brunson (Nov. 13-19).\n\nRandle continues to rise from early season woes, as his efforts guided the Knicks (12-7) to three consecutive victories this week. He averaged a double-double at 24.7 points and 13.3 rebounds in the trio, headlined by a 25-20 effort in last Monday's win over Charlotte. With that performance, Randle became the first New Yorker to post a 20-20 game since Enes Kanter Freedom in 2018.\n\nSacramento's De'Aaron Fox took home the Western Conference edition.\n\nDECEMBER 3 PORZINGIS TO MISS CELTICS' IST QUARTERFINAL\n\nThe Boston Celtics will be missing one of their most valuable newcomers as they seek in-season glory on Monday night: the team announced that former New York Knicks star Kristaps Porzingis (calf) would not play against the Indiana Pacers (7:30 p.m. ET, TNT) in the first quarterfinal of the inaugural NBA In-Season Tournament.\n\nCeltics head coach Joe Mazzulla labeled Porzingis \"day-to-day\" in comments obtained by Cameron Tabatabaie of Celtics Wire.\n\n“He didn’t practice yesterday,” Mazzulla said. “But he got on the court before practice. His status hasn’t been updated as far as if we’ll be ready for money.\"\n\n\"Money,\" of course, refers to the ultimate prize afforded to the In-Season Tournament's champions, with each member of the winning team getting $500,000. The winner of the Boston-Indiana tilt will face the victor of a Tuesday tilt between the Knicks and Milwaukee Bucks in Las Vegas, which will also host the championship final on Saturday night.\n\nDECEMBER 2 JALEN BRUNSON LEADING IN CHARGES DRAWN\n\nJalen Brunson has emerged into the undisputed leader for the New York Knicks, but he's also laying it all out on the line.\n\nAccording to Tommy Beer, Brunson alone has drawn more charges than 22 teams.\n\nBrunson has stopped many points by taking one for the team, and it's a stat that often gets overlooked. However, Brunson is proving how valuable it can truly be.\n\nNOVEMBER 30 BOGANOVIC OUT VS KNICKS, LIKELY TO DEBUT SATURDAY\n\nDetroit Pistons forward Bojan Bogdanovic will not play in the team's visit to Madison Square Garden on Thursday night (7:30 p.m. ET, MSG), but could instead make his season debut on Saturday against the Atlanta Hawks, per ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski. Bogdanovic has yet to play this season due to a calf strain, which has prevented him from building upon a career-best in scoring set last season (21.6 a game).\n\nNOVEMBER 28 RANDLE VICTIMIZED BY L2M REPORT VS PHOENIX\n\nSunday's 116-113 loss to the Phoenix Suns didn't have to be so heartbreaking for the New York Knicks.\n\nThe NBA's Last Two Minute Report from the Knicks' interconference defeat declared that two calls against forward Julius Randle were missed as New York forced a late tie that eventually led to Devin Booker's game-winning triple in the penultimate second. Randle was ruled to be in the paint for longer than three seconds on the possession that eventually yielded Jalen Brunson's game-tying jumper with 21 seconds remaining. The correct call would've been a three-second violation that would've sent the ball back to Phoenix's end with a two-point lead.\n\nRandle also avoided a whistle on Phoenix's prior trip down the floor: just over 20 seconds prior, officials were said to have missed a Randle personal foul against Jusuf Nurkic, one that would've put Phoenix at the foul line and a chance to build on the two-point lead that Brunson erased. Instead, the Suns were charged with a shot clock violation that set up the point guard's equalizer.\n\nNOVEMBER 27 KNICKS ADJUST TWO-WAY DEALS\n\nPer ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski, the New York Knicks will release Duane Washington Jr. from his two-way contract, which will go to former Summer League star Jaylen Martin. Washington, who signed with the organization in February after 31 games with Phoenix, had not played with either the Knicks nor their G League affiliate in Westchester this season due to a thumb injury.\n\nThe 19-year-old Martin, who played under former Knicks shooter Charlie Ward at Florida State University School, played for the Knicks' Summer League team in Las Vegas, earning 39 points on 41 percent shooting in three appearances. He has since moved onto Westchester, averaging 10.8 points and 3.3 rebounds.\n\nNOVEMBER 27 LAMELO BALL INJURED BEFORE KNICKS CLASH\n\nThe Charlotte Hornets may be without their franchise face LaMelo Ball when they face the Knicks on Tuesday night at Madison Square Garden (7:30 p.m. ET, MSG): the star point guard suffered an ankle injury and had to be carried off the court during Sunday's loss to Orlando and did not return.\n\nPer Spencer Percy of Buzz Beat, Ball's subsequent x-rays were negative but his status will likely linger in question as the Hornets come to MSG in the finale of In-Season Tournament group play for both sides. Ball is coming off ankle surgery after a different ailment ended his previous season last February.\n\nNOVEMBER 26 DURANT OUT VS KNICKS\n\nThe Phoenix Suns announced that Kevin Durant (foot soreness) would miss his second consecutive game, keeping him out of the team's Sunday tilt against the New York Knicks.\n\nDurant was listed as questionable on the pregame injury report and was said to be a game-time decision. Keita Bates-Diop stepped into his spot in the starting lineup for the second straight game.\n\nNOVEMBER 23: JEFFRIES, MCBRIDE, SIMS STAR IN WESTCHESTER ASSIGNMENT\n\nNew York Knicks reserves DaQuan Jeffries, Miles McBride, and Jericho Sims were each assigned to the team's G League affiliate in Westchester on Wednesday. Each took advantage of an extended opportunity in the team's final pre-Thanksgiving clash against the Brooklyn Nets' group from Long Island.\n\nThough the Knicks fell by a 111-104 final, Jeffries put up 23 points on 9-of-17 shooting (including 5-of-10 from three-point range) while McBride was right behind him with 21. Sims pulled in 12 rebounds, half of them of the offensive variety.\n\nWestchester (4-2) returns to action on Saturday when they take on the Greensboro Swarm, the Charlotte Hornets' affiliate, on Saturday afternoon (4 p.m. ET, NBAGLeague.com).\n\nNOVEMBER 20 MCDANIELS LEAVES KNICKS-WOLVES GAME\n\nMinnesota Timberwolves forward Jaden McDaniels (right ankle sprain) has been ruled out for the remainder of the team's Monday night showdown against the Knicks. McDaniels has made a name for himself as a strong defender during the Timberwolves' scorching start to the 2023-24 season but will be missing after rolling his ankle upon landing on the foot of Karl-Anthony Towns while going for a rebound.\n\nDespite losing McDaniels, Minnesota leads the Knicks 58-56 at halftime in Minneapolis.\n\nNOVEMBER 20: BRUNSON LANDS EAST POTW HONOR:\n\nThe NBA announced on Monday that Knicks point guard Jalen Brunson was bestowed the Eastern Conference Player of the Week honor, earning the accolade alongside Western star De'Aaron Fox of Sacramento. It's Brunson's second such honor since joining the Knicks on a four-year, $104 million contract two summers ago.\n\nBrunson has carried the offensive slack as the Knicks (8-5) have embarked on a five-game road trip: in the first four stages, Brunson has averaged 28.5 points and 6.5 assists while shooting a sterling 54.3 percent from three-point range. That includes consecutive 32-point showings in a weekend back-to-back, the former coming in the Knicks' first NBA In-Season Tournament victory on Friday in Washington. Brunson has earned 77 points over two In-Season Tournament games thus far.\n\nNew York has gone 3-1 on the trip so far and will have a chance to close things out on a high note on Monday night in Minnesota (8 p.m. ET, MSG).\n\nNOVEMBER 16 MILES BRIDGES MAKING RETURN?\n\nThe Charlotte Hornets could see one of their players return from suspension in time for their game Saturday against the New York Knicks.\n\nThe Hornets released the following statement:\n\n“Miles Bridges is eligible to return to our active roster on Friday after serving his NBA suspension. We are comfortable with Miles returning to play based on our current understanding of the facts of the recent allegations and remain in contact with the NBA as that matter proceeds through the court process.”\n\nBridges did not play last season during an investigation into an arrest for domestic violence in June 2022. He has not appeared in an NBA game since April 2022 and has since pleaded no contest to a \"felony domestic violence charge of injuring a child’s parent and being sentenced to three years of probation without jail time.\"\n\nPrior to the Knicks' visit, Charlotte (3-7) will face the Milwaukee Bucks on Friday in Charlotte (7 p.m. ET, Bally Sports Southeast).\n\nNOVEMBER 14 SIMMONS TO 'MISS TIME' AFTER MRI\n\nBen Simmons' agent Bernie Lee says his client will \"miss time\" after an MRI revealed \"nerve irritation on the lower left side of his body\" for the Brooklyn Nets star.\n\n\"He's not experiencing anything similar to what he's gone through in the past,\" Lee said, per Brian Lewis of the New York Post. \"This is something that the expectation is that with the proper kind of rehab, he’ll be able to resume his season in a short period of time without any issue.\"\n\nThe oft-injured Simmons is working through his second season with the Nets and averaged 10.8 rebounds and 6.5 points in six prior appearances this season.\n\nNOVEMBER 13 MILLER DAY-TO-DAY AFTER ANKLE INJURY VS. KNICKS\n\nCharlotte Hornets rookie Brandon Miller is considered day-to-day after an ankle injury forced his early exit from Sunday's game against the New York Knicks.\n\n“He tried to come back in,” Hornets head coach Steve Clifford said, per Sam Perley of the Hornets' official site. “I think it’ll be more day-to-day. We’ll see how he feels tomorrow getting treatment and stuff and hopefully, he’s good by Tuesday.”\n\nMiller, the second overall pick of last summer's draft, had 11 points in 10 minutes before his medically induced departure. Charlotte (3-6) returns to action on Tuesday when they face the Miami Heat as part of NBA In-Season Tournament action (7 p.m. ET, Bally Sports Southeast).\n\nNOVEMBER 13 MICHAEL MALONE CONTRACT EXTENSION\n\nA former assistant coach for the New York Knicks has some added job security.\n\nAccording to ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski, the Denver Nuggets signed Michael Malone to a contract extension, five months removed from winning the NBA Finals. Malone coached with the Knicks from 2001-05 under Don Chaney, Herb Williams, and Lenny Wilkens.\n\nNOVEMBER 12 KELLY OUBRE OUT 'SIGNIFICANT' TIME AFTER CAR ACCIDENT\n\nA rival of the New York Knicks is dealing with the aftermath of a horrific car accident.\n\nPhiladelphia 76ers guard Kelly Oubre Jr. is suffering from broken ribs after being struck by a vehicle on Saturday in Philadelphia, per The Athletic's Shams Charania. Oubre's injuries are not considered to be season-ending.\n\nThe Knicks' next meeting against Oubre and the 76ers comes on Jan. 5 in Philadelphia.\n\nNOVEMBER 11 WESTCHESTER WHACKS DEFENDING G LEAGUE CHAMPS\n\nBehind a 25-point, 13-assist double-double for Brandon Goodwin, the Westchester Knicks tipped off the 2023-24 G League season in style, downing the defending champion Delaware Blue Coats (Philadelphia) by a 135-103 final on Friday night.\n\nDuane Washington Jr. led New York with 26 points while Isaiah Roby had a double-double of his own with 13 points and 11 rebounds. Charlie Brown Jr. tallied 18 points and received his championship ring from Delaware, having played with the Blue Coats last season.\n\nWestchester (1-0) will host its home opener against the Maine Celtics (Boston) on Sunday afternoon at Westchester County Center (3 p.m. ET, MSGSN). It'll be their first game in White Plains since 2020, having spent the past three seasons in Bridgeport, CT.\n\nNOVEMBER 8 VASSELL IN VS KNICKS\n\nPer Shams Charania, Devin Vassell will dress and partake in the San Antonio Spurs' Wednesday night visit to Madison Square Garden to face the New York Knicks (7:30 p.m. ET, MSG)\n\nVassell (groin) was originally listed as doubtful on the original injury report but reportedly partook in San Antonio's pregame warmups. He is tied for the San Antonio lead in scoring alongside Victor Wembanyama at 19.4 a game and has missed each of the Spurs' last two contests, both losses.\n\nNOVEMBER 7 PLUMLEE SPRAINS MCL IN RANDLE COLLISION\n\nPer ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski, Los Angeles Clippers center Mason Plumlee sustained an MCL sprain in a collision with New York Knicks forward Julius Randle during the teams' Monday night tilt at Madison Square Garden. Plumlee will not play in the Clippers' Wednesday visit to Brooklyn (7:30 p.m. ET, YES) and instead will be sent back to Los Angeles for further evaluation.\n\nPlumee's injury occurred during second half action when fighting for the ball with Randle. The latter's low dive sent him into Plumlee's knee and the latter required assistance leaving the floor and getting to the locker room. Randle was apologetic to Plumlee before he left the floor.\n\nThe Clippers (3-3) are relatively low on interior depth, having dealt a good bit of it in the trade for James Harden. The team is currently engaged in a three-game road trip that wraps up in Dallas on Friday night.\n\nNOVEMBER 6 CLIPPERS SIGN PRIMO BEFORE KNICKS BATTLE\n\nThe Los Angeles Clippers are expected to debut James Harden against the New York Knicks tonight (7:30 p.m. ET, MSG), but the team has another new name on its roster.\n\nAccording to The Athletic's Shams Charania, the Clippers have signed former San Antonio Spurs guard Josh Primo to a standard deal. He was previously on a two-way contract with the team.\n\nPrimo, 20, was cut by the San Antonio Spurs just a year after being drafted with the No. 12 overall pick in the 2021 NBA Draft following \"conduct detrimental\" to the NBA. Primo had reportedly been inappropriately exposing himself to women, most notably Dr. Hillary Cauthen, a former psychologist for the organization. Dr. Cauthen filed a lawsuit against the Spurs and Primo, which was settled later that November.\n\nNOVEMBER 3 KNICKS TICKETS PRICIEST IN NBA\n\nIf you want to attend a New York Knicks game, it's going to cost you a pretty penny.\n\nAxios conducted a study to determine the price of four of the cheapest tickets possible, four hot dogs, two 16 oz. beers, two 20 oz. sodas and a parking spot a each of the 29 NBA arenas. The Knicks were far away in first place with a total of $745.18, over $100 more than the second-priciest team, the Golden State Warriors' Chase Center. The NBA average is just over $300.\n\nGiven the fact that the Knicks play in New York City, this doesn't come as much of a surprise, but it's proof that it's not cheap to go to a game at Madison Square Garden.\n\nNOVEMBER 1 BARRETT OUT VS CAVS\n\nThe Knicks have announced that RJ Barrett will not play in Thursday's game against the Cleveland Cavaliers due to a sore left knee.\n\nBarrett has been the Knicks' leading scorer in the early going, averaging 21 over the opening quartet. He has been one of the more durable Knicks in recent memory, playing at least 70 games in each of the last three seasons. Josh Hart is expected to start in Barrett's place\n\nOCTOBER 31 CLIPPERS LAND JAMES HARDEN\n\nThe Los Angeles Clippers landed perhaps the NBA's ultimate example of a trick-or-treat superstar on Halloween.\n\nPer ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski, the Clippers and Philadelphia 76ers have agreed to a deal that will send James Harden to the Pacific. Philadelphia gets back Nic Batum, Rober Covington, KJ Martin, Marcus Morris, an unprotected first-round pick in 2028, and the 2026 first-round pick of the Oklahoma City Thunder. Los Angeles also receives Filip Petrusev and PJ Tucker.\n\nOCTOBER 31 BREEN SIGNS EXTENSION WITH WORLDWIDE LEADER\n\nWhile the New York Knicks have remained mostly quiet on the free agency front, one of their most beloved representatives just earned a big payday to stay off the market.\n\nPer Andrew Marchand of the New York Post, Mike Breen has signed a multi-million two-year extension with ESPN that will keep him calling the NBA's biggest games on the Worldwide Leader's airwaves through the 2026-27 season. Breen, 62, has been with ESPN/ABC since 2006 and also serves as the Knicks' lead television play-by-play voice for MSG Network.\n\nMarchand notes that the deal is partly contingent on ESPN keeping its NBA rights, which expire after the 2024-25 season. With previous analyst companions (and former Knicks reps) Mark Jackson and Jeff Van Gundy let go as part of ESPN's summer layoffs, Breen was a part of the new top pairing alongside Doris Burke and Doc Rivers. The triumvirate made its debut last Wednesday night at Madison Square Garden, narrating the Knicks' opening night loss to the Boston Celtics.\n\nOCTOBER 30 KNICKS IN-SEASON TOURNAMENT COURT REVEALED\n\nThe NBA unveiled new court designs to be used for each of the 30 teams' In-Season Tournament games, which tip off on Friday night. Each court appears to be inspired by the respective team's \"City\" edition uniform.\n\nThough the Knicks' City uniform has yet to be revealed, view Madison Square Garden's makeover below:\n\nThe court will make its debut on Friday, Nov. 24 against the Miami Heat.\n\nOCTOBER 22 KNICKS FINALIZE ROSTER WITH WINDLER, WASHINGTON\n\nBarring any last-minute moves, the New York Knicks' 2023-24 opening night roster is complete.\n\nSpotrac's Keith Smith has reported that the Knicks will convert Dylan Windler's deal to a standard contract while Ian Begley of SNY revealed that the final two-way designation will go to Duane Washington Jr.\n\nWindler, 27 was, a first-round pick of Cleveland's in 2019 out of Belmont. He appeared in three games with the Cavaliers last season and shot over 40 percent from three-point range in 11 appearances with their G League affiliate, the Charge. Washington, on the other hand, rejoins the Knicks' system after joining the team midway through the season. He played 31 games with Phoenix and averaged over 20 points a game in four showings with G League Westchester.\n\nOCTOBER 21 BROWN, TOPPIN ON TWO-WAY DEALS\n\nPer ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski, the New York Knicks are converting the contracts of Charlie Brown Jr. and Jacob Toppin to two-way deals. In other moves, the Knicks waived Mamadi Diakite, Brandon Goodwin, Isaiah Roby, and Duane Washington Jr.\n\nBrown, who spent last season amidst the Delaware Blue Coats' championship effort, was the Knicks' season-leading scorer in Vegas Summer League action at 19.8 points per game. He appeared in all four games of the Knicks' preseason, scoring three points and earning two assists and rebounds each. Toppin, the younger brother of former Knick Obi, played one preseason game, tallying four points and two rebounds in the opening win over Boston.\n\nOCTOBER 20 TOPPIN GOES BETWEEN THE LEGS FOR PACERS\n\nThe Indiana Pacers' Obi Toppin era has officially taken flight.\n\nToppin, formerly of the Knicks, had one more preseason highlight in store for those gathered for the Pacers' preseason finale at Gainbridge Fieldhouse, putting down a between-the-legs slam dunk during first period action against the Cleveland Cavaliers.\n\nAfter his playing time, or lack thereof, became a talking point in New York, Toppin has been in the Pacers' starting lineup in each of their four preseason games. In that span, Toppin has put up averages of 7.3 points and 4.7 rebounds in just over 17 minutes a game. He had an Indiana-best 13 in 17 first half minutes on Friday en route to a 56-51 halftime lead.\n\nToppin and the Pacers face the Knicks three times this season, the first matchup landing on Dec. 30 in Indianapolis. In the meantime, Toppin's official Indiana debut lands on Wednesday night at home against the Washington Wizards (7 p.m. ET, Bally Sports Indiana).\n\nOCTOBER 19 KNICKS CUT KNIGHT, SIGN TWO TO EXHIBIT 10S\n\nThe New York Knicks' roster cutdown continued on Thursday, as SNY's Ian Begley has reported that Nathan Knight was waived from his two-way deal. In addition, the Knicks also signed Mamadi Diakite and Brandon Goodwin to Exhibit 10 deals (which can be converted into two-ways)\n\nKnight, 26, spent the past three years in the Minnesota Timberwolves system. In just over eight preseason minutes, Knight hauled in an assist, block, and rebound each and sank his only attempt from the field. Knight's departure will open up a two-way contract slot, the second in a row opened after Jaylen Martin was bid farewell on Wednesday.\n\nAs for the newcomers, who will likely make their way to Westchester, Diakite has bounced around several teams after winning a national championship with the University of Virginia in 2019. He also has an NBA ring to his name, playing 21 games with the 2020-21 champion Milwaukee Bucks. Goodwin is likewise well-traveled and already has one tour of Westchester to his name, averaging 15.3 points and 7.0 assists during the 2021 season. His last NBA action came with Cleveland in 2022.\n\nOCTOBER 18 KNICKS CUT ROBY AND MARTIN\n\nThe New York Knicks are saying goodbye to two of their players on Wednesday.\n\nAccording to The Athletic's Shams Charania, the Knicks are requesting waivers on Isaiah Roby and two-way player Jaylen Martin.\n\nRoby signed with the Knicks back in April, while Martin joined the team for the Las Vegas Summer League. Both made an impression in camp, but not enough to make the final roster going into the season.\n\nOCTOBER 12 DIVINCENZO LANDS ANTA SHOE DEAL\n\nThis Knick has some new kicks.\n\nAccording to Boardroom's Nick DePaula, DiVincenzo has agreed to a shoe deal with ANTA. One of the newest Knicks, DiVincenzo was previously affiliated with Nike and Puma. He joins the ANTA family which also includes Gordon Hayward, Kyrie Irving, and Klay Thompson. DiVincenzo made his unofficial Knicks debut on Monday night, scoring eight points and hauling in three rebounds in a 114-107 win over Boston.\n\nOCTOBER 10 LIBERTY LEGEND ON HER WAY TO CHICAGO\n\nAs her former team goes for WNBA glory, Teresa Weatherspoon has landed her own prize in the wake of the Finals.\n\nPer Shams Charania, the former New York Liberty star is set to become the new head coach of the Chicago Sky. Weatherspoon, one of the Liberty's original legends, earned five WNBA All-Star bids over her seven seasons in New York (1997-2003) and established herself as one of the league's first faces. The Louisiana Tech alumna previously worked in the Liberty's developmental department and spent the last four NBA seasons as an assistant coach with the New Orleans Pelicans. She also served as the head coach at her alma mater for six seasons (2009-14), reaching the NCAA Women's Basketball Tournament twice.\n\nChicago is two years removed from a WNBA title partly led by current Liberty star Courtney Vandersloot. The team endured its first losing season (18-22) since 2018 after previous head coach James Wade took a job on the Toronto Raptors' bench midway through the summer. Longtime assistant Emre Vatansever took over for the rest of the year, which ended with a first round playoff loss to the Liberty's current Finals foe from Las Vegas.\n\nOCTOBER 9 HART, ARCDIACONO TO SIT ALONGSIDE CELTICS STARS\n\nPer Steve Popper of Newsday, the New York Knicks will not play either Josh Hart (maintenance) or Ryan Arcidiacono (undisclosed) in Monday's preseason opener against the Boston Celtics (7:30 p.m. ET, MSG). The Villanova duo is set to play together in New York after they were involved in a swap between the Knicks and Portland at last year's trade deadline.\n\nBoston's absences are even more numerous, as SNY's Ian Begley has reported that they'll hold out Jaylen Brown, Jrue Holiday, Kristaps Porzingis, Jayson Tatum, and Derrick White.\n\nOCTOBER 8 TOPPIN, ROSE START PACERS-GRIZZLIES PRESEASON OPENER\n\nObi Toppin's desires for more playing time were fulfilled in his unofficial debut with the Indiana Pacers on Sunday: the former Knick was stationed in the starting five and scored seven points with five rebounds over 16 minutes in a 127-122 overtime loss to the Memphis Grizzlies. Each of Toppin's points came over the first 4:30 as Indiana (0-1) jumped out to an early 14-10 lead.\n\nOn the other side, Derrick Rose likewise landed in the Grizzlies' starting five and shot 6-of-8 from the field (including 5-of-5 in the first half) en route to 13 points in the win.\n\nToppin and Rose are looking to recover the narrative on their respective NBA careers after last year's trials and tribulations with the Knicks. Rose was removed from the nine-man rotation in the early going while Toppin struggled to generate a lasting role after coming over as the eighth overall pick in the 2020 draft.\n\nOCTOBER 1 CELTICS TRADE FOR KNICKS TARGET HOLIDAY\n\nPotential New York Knicks target Jrue Holiday is on the move again, as ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski is reporting that the two-time All-Star has been traded to the Boston Celtics.\n\nHoliday, who was previously included in the deal that sent Damian Lillard to the Milwaukee Bucks, goes to Beantown while his brief employers, the Portland Trail Blazers, land Deandre Ayton, Robert Williams, Malcolm Brogdon, Toumani Camara, three first-round picks in 2024 (Golden State, top four protected), 2029 (Bucks and Celtics unprotected) and 2028 and 2030 Milwaukee pick swaps. Wojnarowski says that Boston, fresh off an Eastern Conference Finals appearance, is expected to sign Holiday to a long-term deal.\n\nSEPTEMBER 29 NBA ALUMS WARN HARDEN OF TRADE DANGER\n\nMatt Barnes and Kevin Garnett offered dire warnings to current Philadelphia 76ers star James Harden for his excess trade demands, ones that placed him in a strategic war of words with team president Daryl Morey. Barnes, no stranger to being an NBA nomad (nine teams over 14 Association seasons), was particularly critical.\n\n\"I think James has to be careful because the NBA doesn’t need him. The NBA doesn't need him anymore,\" Barnes said on Showtime Basketball. \"I'm all for player empowerment. But he forced his way out of Houston, forced his way out of Brooklyn. Now, he's going to force his way out of Philly. He's got so much talent and a lot of game left, but he could talk himself out of the league, which is crazy to think.\"\n\nThough not as nomadic, Garnett agreed with Barnes' assessment.\n\n\"When you wiggle your way out, you only got one or two wiggles,\" Garnett said. \"You ain’t got infinite wiggles.\"\n\nWhile Harden is set to report to Philadelphia's training camp activities, it appears that he will continue to try to force his way out. A report from ESPN's Ramona Shelburne earlier this summer claimed that Harden's preferred destinations are either the Knicks or Los Angeles Clippers.\n\nSEPTEMBER 25 WESTCHESTER KNICKS TRADE TREVOR KEELS' RIGHTS TO IOWA\n\nThe New York Knicks organization has officially closed the book on the Trevor Keels era: the G League club in Westchester has traded the 2022 NBA Draft pick to the Iowa Wolves in exchange for rights to Matt Lewis and a 2024 first-round pick in the G League Draft.\n\nKeels was the Knicks' only acquisition of 2022's draft night that had a name, as the team spent most of the event building a budget for Jalen Brunson. The Duke alum and the 42nd overall pick of the draft played sparingly for the big club (eight minutes over three games) and averaged 14.5 points on just over 42 percent shooting in 24 games with Westchester. Keels was waived by the Knicks earlier this offseason.\n\nFormerly of James Madison, Lewis now joins Westchester after two seasons with Minnesota's affiliate in Iowa. Lewis came off the bench for Brooklyn's squad during the most recent Summer League action, averaging 11.2 points a game and shooting over 54 percent from the floor.\n\nSEPTEMBER 24 PATRICK EWING'S DAUGHTER COMMITS TO PENN STATE\n\nHer father starred above Penn Station. She'll star for Penn State.\n\nAlexis Ewing, daughter of Knicks legend Patrick, announced her commitment to Penn State University on her Instagram page, labeling herself \"extremely blessed.\" The post from the younger Ewing, one of the top high school volleyball players in the nation, features poses with her father Patrick and mother Cheryl Wilson, a former professional volleyball player.\n\nCurrently repping Bullis High School in Maryland (just over 20 minutes away from Patrick's alma mater of Georgetown University), Alexis has made headlines on and off the hardwood, notably becoming one of the first high school athletes in the state to land a name. image, likeness deal when she signed on with College Hunks Hauling Junk & Moving.\n\nSEPTEMBER 21 KNICKS TO HOLD TRAINING CAMP AT THE CITADEL\n\nPer Andrew Miller of The Post and Courier, the New York Knicks will hold parts of their training camp on the campus of The Citadel in Charleston, SC. New York is expected to stay in Charleston from Oct. 3-7, the slate ending shortly before they return home to face the Boston Celtics in their preseason opener on Oct. 9 at Madison Square Garden.\n\nThe Knicks will practice at McAlister Field House, the home floor of the Bulldogs, during their southern stay. This fall's activities will mark a return to Charleston for the Knicks, who previously held training camp at the College of Charleston before departing in 2000 as an act of protest to South Carolina's continued display of the Confederate battle flag above its Statehouse. The flag was removed in 2015.\n\nThe Citadel competes at the Division I level of NCAA men's basketball play and is set to open its 2023-24 season on Nov. 6 against North Carolina State.\n\nSEPTEMBER 19 KNICKS FLAGSHIP STATION DROPPING FM SIGNAL\n\nPer Andrew Marchand of the New York Post, ESPN New York (WEPN) will be dropping its FM Signal on Aug. 31, 2024. The station's AM signal, 1050, will remain active.\n\nESPN New York serves as the flagship radio station of the Knicks, Jets, and Rangers. The decision was made by parent company Good Karma Brands, which stated that 60 percent of listeners access the station beyond the 98.7 FM feed, citing 1050 AM and digital outlets. WEPN has been the flagship station of the Knicks since 2005 when they moved over from WFAN.\n\n“We’re committed to serving the New York sports fan,\" Good Karma Brands CEO Craig Karmazin told The Post. \"With the combination of our AM signal, the ESPN New York App, podcasts, smart speakers, YES, and other additional audio and video distribution, investing in an FM signal was not relevant in the way it was a decade ago.\"\n\nESPN New York's most-renowned original programming is \"The Michael Kay Show,\" hosted by the eponymous New York Yankees play-by-play voice. Ed Cohen and Brendan Brown have been on the mics for Knicks games since 2017.\n\nSEPTEMBER 17 DAMYEAN DOTSON SIGNS IN CHINA\n\nA former member of the New York Knicks has a new home overseas: according to Sportando, former Knicks guard Damyean Dotson is signing with the Ningbo Rockets of the Chinese Basketball Association.\n\nDotson, 29, played with the Knicks from 2017-20 and then for another two-game stint in 2021-22. Last season, he played in Turkey for Gaziantep Basketbol, averaging 14.8 points and three assists per game.\n\nSEPTEMBER 15 WESTCHESTER KNICKS TRADE FOR RJ BARRETT TEAMMATE\n\nThe Stockton Kings of the NBA G League announced a trade that sent former RJ Barrett collegiate teammate Alex O'Connell to the Westchester Knicks, a deal that also acquired Jeriah Horne. In return, Westchester is sending James Akinjo, earner of 14.4 points and 6.6 assists a game last season, to Sacramento's affiliate.\n\nBoth Horne and O'Connell are currently stationed overseas. O'Connell (Italy's Umana Venezia) originally played with Duke during Barrett's single season in Durham and later transferred to Creighton. He averaged 9.6 points a game in three appearances (1 start) with Sacramento's Summer League team during the most recent competition in Las Vegas. Horne (Poland's MKS Dabrowa Gornicza) spent his collegiate career between Nebraska, Tulsa, and Colorado and shot over 39 percent from three-point range with Stockton last year.\n\nSEPTEMBER 13 SILVER COMMENTS ON KNICKS' RAPTORS LAWSUIT\n\nNBA commissioner Adam Silver briefly touched upon the New York Knicks' lawsuit against the Toronto Raptors during a press conference centered upon the newly-released Player Participation Policy.\n\n\"On that dispute, I don't know more than what I read in the complaint that was filed in federal court, and so I don't have a sense yet of how egregious it is, and I haven't had an opportunity to see what the Raptors response is,\" Silver said (h/t New York Basketball on X). \"This ultimately may end up in front of me, so I think it's appropriate to withhold judgment.\"\n\nThe Knicks are suing the Raptors over the potential theft of proprietary materials, with former team employee Ike Azotam and new Toronto head coach Darko Rajaković among the defendants. Toronto management has denied any wrongdoing\n\nSEPTEMBER 11 DRAFTKINGS PROMO REFERENCES 9/11\n\nSports betting site DraftKings faced backlash for a tasteless promotion that centered upon a parlay that referenced the tragic events of the September 11, 2001 tragedies. On the 22nd anniversary of terrorist attacks that destroyed the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center in Lower Manhattan, DraftKings offered a \"Never Forget\" parlay, which centered upon three New York teams (Jets, Mets, Yankees) winning their respective games on Monday night.\n\nDraftKings pulled the promotion after an overwhelmingly negative response and released an apology to Michael Silverman of The Boston Globe.\n\n“We sincerely apologize for the featured parlay that was shared briefly in commemoration of 9/11,\" DraftKings said. \"We respect the significance of this day for our country and especially for the familys [sic] of those who were directly affected.”\n\nSEPTEMBER 10 GERMANY WINS FIBA WORLD CUP\n\nGermany completed an undefeated FIBA Basketball World Cup run with an 83-77 win against Serbia in Manila, earning the first title in program history and its first podium finish since a third-place posting in 2002.\n\nDennis Schroder (Toronto) was named MVP of the tournament after his 28-point performance in the final while Franz Wagner (Orlando) also helped out with 19 points.\n\nFor Serbia, Aleksa Avramovic led the way with 21 points while Bogdan Bogdanovic (Atlanta) scored 17.\n\nSEPTEMBER 9 KEVIN KNOX RETURNS TO PORTLAND\n\nKevin Knox's attempt to reclaim the narrative of his NBA career will continue in a familiar place, as Shams Charania reports that the 24-year-old will return to the Portland Trail Blazers on a one-year deal.\n\nChosen by the Knicks as the ninth overall pick of the 2018 NBA Draft, Knox has struggled to live up to the hype that followed him out of Kentucky, as Portland is his fourth different team since a January 2022 trade to Atlanta ended his New York career. Sent to the Pacific Northwest from Detroit in a different deal in February, Knox appeared in 21 games for the Trail Blazers and averaged 8.5 points and 3.3 rebounds, which would've been his best full-season numbers since his rookie campaign with the Knicks in 2018-19.\n\nSEPTEMBER 8 KNICKS SIGN CHARLIE BROWN JR.\n\nThe New York Knicks are adding a familiar face to their G League team.\n\nAccording to the New York Post's Peter Botte, the Knicks are signing Charlie Brown Jr. to an Exhibit 10 deal. Brown, 26, has 41 games of NBA experience under his belt and last played for the Philadelphia 76ers in the 2021-22 season. He played for the Knicks in Summer League, and made enough of an impression to land a training camp invitation to the tune of 19.8 points and 6.3 rebounds, both good for second among the Vegas group.\n\nIn a corresponding move, the team cut Obadiah Noel.\n\nSEPTEMBER 8 JOKUBAITIS, LITHUANIA TO PLAY FOR 5TH AT WORLD CUP\n\nRokas Jokubaitis earned eight points and assists each in Lithuania's penultimate 2023 FIBA Basketball World Cup excursion en route to a 100-84 classification victory over Slovenia.\n\nJokubaitis, a New York prospect who came to the team in a draft night trade in 2021, and the Lithuanians (6-1) will now play for fifth against Latvia on Saturday (8:30 a.m. ET, ESPN+).\n\nLuka Doncic (Dallas) put up 29 points for the Slovenians in defeat.\n\nSEPTEMBER 7 FIBA WORLD CUP SEMIFINALS\n\nThe New York Knicks will be well-represented in the FIBA Basketball World Cup semifinals, both of which take place Friday in Manila.\n\nIn the first game, RJ Barrett, along with Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, will lead Canada against Serbia at 4:45 a.m. ET on ESPN+ In the latter contest, Jalen Brunson, Josh Hart, and the United States face off against Franz Wagner, Dennis Schroder and undefeated Germany at 8:40 a.m. on ESPN2.\n\nSEPTEMBER 5 JOKUBAITIS DISHES 9 IN LITHUANIA LOSS\n\nKnicks prospect Rokas Jokubaitis' strong showing couldn't steer Lithuania away from elimination from the FIBA Basketball World Cup, as Serbia took an 87-68 decision to open quarterfinal play on Tuesday in Manila.\n\nDespite the loss, Jokubaitis exited the competition on a personal high note, scoring 13 points and dishing out a game-best nine assists in defeat. The draft night arrival finishes the six-game showing in Asia with averages of 12.8 points and 6.2 assists for Lithuania (5-1), which was looking to medal in World Cup play for the first time since 2010.\n\nSEPTEMBER 3 WORLD CUP QUARTERFINAL MATCHUPS, SCHEDULES SET\n\nThe FIBA Basketball World Cup quarterfinals in Manila will have no shortage of Knicks representation: current stars RJ Barrett, Jalen Brunson, and Josh Hart will be repping North America while 2021 draft pick Rokas Jokubaitis will partake with Lithuania.\n\nFresh off their high-scoring showdown on Sunday, Jokubaitis, Brunson, and Hart will return to action on Tuesday with a quarterfinal doubleheader. Lithuania will open against Serbia (4:45 a.m. ET, ESPN+) while the Americans face Italy in their own tilt (8:40 a.m. ET, ESPN2). Should they prevail, the Americans will play the winner of Wednesday's Germany-Latvia game (4:45 a.m. ET, ESPN+) which precedes Barrett and the Canadiens' quarterfinal against Slovenia (8:40 a.m. ET, ESPN+).\n\nAll games in the knockout round will be held in Manila.\n\nSEPTEMBER 2 FOURNIER QUIET AS FRANCE WINS WORLD CUP FINALE Evan Fournier played a muted role in his 2023 FIBA Basketball World Cup finale, scoring two points in 17 minutes and missing all four attempts from the field in France's classification tilt against Ivory Coast. Fournier did haul in six rebounds in an 87-77 victory.\n\nThus ends a disappointing showing in Jakarta for Fournier and the French, who officially placed 18th in the final World Cup standings. Fournier's minutes were reduced during the consolation stages after he averaged 21.7 points during the preliminary stages. The 18th-place finish is France's worst in nine World Cup appearances, and they entered this year's edition as the two-time defending third-place posters\n\nFrance nonetheless has a spot secure in the 2024 Summer Olympics competition as the host nation. Isaia Cordinier was the leading scorer for the French on Saturday, putting in 19 on 6-of-8 shooting to stave off one last upset bid.\n\nSEPTEMBER 2 CANADA ON BRINK OF ELIMINATION\n\nNew York Knicks forward RJ Barrett and Canada will play for their FIBA World Cup lives in Sunday's second-round game against Spain (9:30 a.m. ET, ESPN+).\n\nAfter Friday's upset loss against Brazil, Canada is in a four-way tie for first place in Group L with Spain and Latvia. The winners of the two games on Sunday will move on to the quarterfinals.\n\nSpain has had an eerily similar tournament path to that of Canada, winning its first three games without much sweat before losing in an upset to Latvia on Friday. Now, the pair of group favorites have only one spot available in the next round for the two of them.\n\nAUGUST 31 CANADA, USA MOVES ON IN FIBA WORLD CUP\n\nThe second round of the FIBA World Cup is set to begin Friday, and New York Knicks forward RJ Barrett is still going strong with Team Canada, while Jalen Brunson and Josh Hart are starring for the U.S.\n\nThe Americans, partaking in Group J, will face Montenegro on Friday (4:40 a.m. ET, ESPN2) and Lithuania two days later (8:40 a.m. ET, ESPN2), with both games in Manila. Fellow group winner Canada will stay in Jakarta, facing Brazil on Friday (9:30 a.m. ET, ESPN+) and the defending champion Spain on Sunday (9:30 a.m. ET, ESPN+).\n\nIf the U.S. and Canada can be in the top two in their respective groups, they will advance to the knockout round, where the tournament becomes single-elimination.\n\nAUGUST 24 KIM VAN GUNDY, SISTER-IN-LAW OF JEFF, DIES AT 61\n\nThe Van Gundy family is in mourning following the death of Kim, the wife of Stan and sister-in-law of former Knicks coach Jeff. Kim passed at the age of 61 and her cause of death was not disclosed.\n\n\"Kimberly’s kindness and love for all around her was shown through her charitable works and activism,\" Kim's obituary notes. \"In lieu of flowers, donations can be made to Pet Alliance of Greater Orlando or Crossroad’s Corral in Kim’s memory.\"\n\nKim and Stan had been married since 1998. In addition to Stan, Kim is survived by her four children, two parents, five siblings, and 13 nieces/nephews.\n\nAUGUST 22 JAMES HARDEN LANDS $100,000 FINE FOR PUBLIC TRADE DEMAND\n\nThe NBA announced on Tuesday that Philadelphia 76ers guard James Harden would be charged with a $100,000 fine \"for public comments on August 14 and 17 indicating that he would not perform the services called for under his player contract unless traded to another team.\"\n\nSuch a fine is the latest turn in the ongoing drama between Harden and the 76ers, one that previously culminated in the 10-time All-Star calling Philadelphia's president of basketball operations a \"liar.\" Harden previously agreed to sign his player option for the 2023-24 season but reportedly did so with the understanding that a trade would be sought.\n\nAUGUST 19 BARRETT SCORES 10, SITS OUT 2ND HALF OF FINAL CANADA TUNE-UP\n\nRJ Barrett had 10 points in Team Canada's final tune-up exhibition leading into the FIBA Basketball World Cup. The Knicks' homegrown star hit 3-of-5 from the field against the Dominican Republic and also hauled in five rebounds over the first 20 minutes before he was shut down as part of a planned resting period along with the rest of the Canadian starters. With the star attractions out, the Dominicans took a 94-88 decision.\n\nCanada finished 3-2 in a five-game exhibition slate before moving on to Jakarta for World Cup pool play. Their first game in Group F action lands on Friday against France, which stars fellow Knick Evan Fournier.\n\nAUGUST 15 KRISTAPS PORZINGIS OUT OF LATVIA'S WORLD CUP BID\n\nBoston Celtics forward Kristaps Porzingis announced that he will miss the upcoming FIBA World Cup, as his recovery from plantar fasciitis will prevent him from traveling to Asia.\n\n\"A decision has been made that I will not play in the World Cup,\" Porzingis said in a translated statement on X. \"After several weeks of recovery and a repeat MRI examination, the plantar fasciitis of my foot still prevents me from being on the field in full readiness.\n\n\"This joint decision has been made by both the medical staff and coaching staff of the national team, as well as the Celtics team - with the advice and opinion that it is now necessary to continue the recovery process. Such a decision is not easy to make, but I promise that I will be there and support the team as much as I can.\"\n\nThe former Knicks All-Star was traded to Boston earlier this offseason. His fellow Latvians will face off against current Knicks RJ Barrett (Canada) and Evan Fournier (France) in Group H play in Jakarta.\n\nAUGUST 14 HARDEN WILL NEVER PLAY FOR \"LIAR\" DARYL MOREY\n\nThe verbal war of attrition between James Harden and the Philadelphia 76ers continues: after reports of the team shutting down trade talks surrounding the All-Star, Harden vowed that he would never play for the organization as long as president of basketball operations Daryl Morey likewise lingers.\n\n\"Daryl Morey is a liar and I will never be a part of an organization that he's a part of,\" Harden declared during an Adidas event in China. \"Let me say that again: Daryl Morey is a liar and I will never be a part of an organization that he's a part of.\"\n\nThe 76ers reportedly spoke with Harden's desired destination, the Los Angeles Clippers, but failed to come to a deal. Harden previously inked a $35.6 million player option with the understanding that a trade would be sought. The New York Knicks reportedly lingered in discussions but the 76ers are reportedly ready to run back their core despite another second round exit in the most recent postseason.\n\nAUGUST 12 76ERS END JAMES HARDEN TRADE TALKS\n\nPer ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski, the Philadelphia 76ers are taking James Harden off the trade block and anticipate having him in this fall's training camp activities.\n\n\"The Sixers had periodic offseason conversations with the Clippers, Harden’s desired destination, but no traction on a deal materialized,\" Wojnarowski said. \"Harden has been emphatic in wanting a trade, so the Sixers are setting up an uncomfortable situation to start camp. Ultimately, Philadelphia wouldn’t make a trade that they believed would compromise their title hopes.\"\n\nThe 76ers' latest second-round washout has had quite an impact: the team ousted head coach Doc Rivers in favor of former Toronto Raptors boss Nick Nurse and also had to deal with reigning MVP Joel Embiid's public desire to win a championship \"in Philly or anywhere else.\" Harden the Sixers recently agreed to a $35.6 million player option with the understanding that both sides would seek a trade.\n\nAUGUST 12 DONCIC TO SIT OUT VS BRUNSON, TEAM USA\n\nThe Slovenian men's national basketball team announced that Dallas Mavericks star Luka Doncic will not play in Saturday's exhibition against the United States in Malaga en route to the FIBA Basketball World Cup (3:30 p.m. ET, FS1). Doncic reportedly sustained a minor injury in the team's prior exhibition against Spain and is missing the showdown against Team USA for precautionary reasons.\n\nThus denies the basketball world a chance to see Doncic square off against former Dallas teammate and current Knicks star Jalen Brunson. The latter missed his return to Dallas with an injury last December in a game that saw Doncic tally a 60-point triple-double in a comeback victory.\n\nAUGUST 11 GIANNIS ANTETOKOUNMPO OUT OF GREECE'S WORLD CUP RUN\n\nMilwaukee Bucks star Giannis Antetokounmpo has ruled himself out of Greece's FIBA Basketball World Cup effort, citing lingering concerns over his recovery from knee surgery.\n\n\"After months of work and multiple meetings with medical staff, it is clear that I am not ready to compete in the level that I need to be to participate in the World Cup,\" Antetokounmpo said on X. \"This was not a choice but my only option in ensuring I get back to the level of basketball I have worked so hard to achieve so far in my career.\n\n\"I am extremely disappointed in this outcome but this was a decision made with the medical staff. I’m going to continue to push myself to be ready for the next time my name is called.\"\n\nThe Greeks are situated in the same group as a United States team featuring Jalen Brunson and Josh Hart, as well as Antetokounmpo's Milwaukee teammate Bobby Portis. Team USA and Greece are set to compete in Group C play with Jordan and New Zealand in Pasay. Both sides are due for an exhibition battle beforehand on Aug. 18 in Abu Dhabi.\n\nAUGUST 10 AMAR'E STOUDEMIRE TO BE INDUCTED INTO SUNS RING OF HONOR\n\nFormer Knicks star Amar'e Stoudemire will have his number retired by the Phoenix Sun next season, the team announced this week. Stoudemire's digits will be retired alongside those of teammate Shawn Marion at a date to be determined this season.\n\n“I bleed purple and orange, making this a tremendous honor to be inducted,” Stoudemire said in a team statement. “My best and most transformative years came in Phoenix with the Suns. I have so much love for Suns fans and appreciation for the love they have always shown me. I am excited to reconnect with the fanbase in joining the Ring of Honor.”\n\nStoudemire, who wore No. 32 in Phoenix, played his first eight NBA seasons with the Suns after arriving as the ninth overall pick of the 2002 draft out of high school. Alongside Marion and Steve Nash, Stoudemire led an exhilarating age of Suns basketball, one that saw him average 21.4 points, 8.9 rebounds, and 1.4 blocks. Stoudemire then moved onto the New York Knicks, where reunited with his Phoenix boss Mike D'Antoni.\n\nAUGUST 9 FOURNIER SITS OUT FRENCH WORLD CUP TUNE-UP\n\nThe French men's national basketball team ruled Evan Fournier out of Wednesday's exhibition against Lithuania, as the Knicks' sharpshooter was said to have \"slightly sprained\" his ankle during a Monday win over Venezuela. Fournier had 13 points in an 86-67 victory for Les Bleus, who look to build upon a third-place finish from the last tournament in 20190.\n\nThe Knicks certainly hope that the ailment won't affect Fournier for the upcoming tournament in Asia. New York will likely continue to seek out a trade for the 30-year-old after he fell out of the metropolitan rotation. France is set to partake in Group H action in Jakarta alongside New York teammate RJ Barrett and Canada as well as Latvia and Lebanon.\n\nAUGUST 9 BARRETT, CANADA DROP FIBA EXHIBITION VS. GERMANY\n\nRJ Barrett and the Canadian men's basketball faced off against the German team in a World Cup prep exhibition, but alas, for Barrett and the Road Warriors, Canada fell to the Germans in an 86-81 defeat as a comeback effort fell short. Barrett was second in scoring for Canada with 12 points, only trailing Oklahoma City Thunder guard Luguentz Dort, who scored 14.\n\nCanada's next FIBA exhibition match comes Saturday in Hamburg, Germany against New Zealand.\n\nAUGUST 4 NTILIKINA RETURNS EAST, SIGNS WITH CHARLOTTE\n\nPer ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski, the Charlotte Hornets have signed Frank Ntilikina to a one-year deal, putting him on a collision course for a showdown with his original NBA employers in the upcoming In-Season Tournament.\n\nNtilikina, 25, began his professional career as the eighth overall pick of the 2017 draft. He struggled to live up to that hype in Manhattan, averaging 5.5 points and 2.7 assists over four seasons in blue and orange. Ntilikina signed with the Dallas Mavericks in 2021 and spent the last two seasons coming off their bench.\n\nThe Knicks won't have to wait long to see Ntilikina again: the team will likely face off against Charlotte in the early portions of their schedule, as the Hornets are placed in their group as the NBA prepares to stage its first In-Season Tournament. New York and Charlotte will be joined by Miami, Milwaukee, and Washington in group play.\n\nAUGUST 3 KNICKS ADD SUMMER LEAGUE, G LEAGUE ALUMS TO EXHIBIT 10S\n\nThe New York Knicks announced on Thursday that Obadiah Noel and Dmytro Skapintsev have inked Exhibit 10 deals. Both have partaken in the Knicks' developmental endeavors in Las Vegas and Westchester/Bridgeport.\n\nNoel starred at UMass Lowell on the college level, earning first-team All-America East honors before embarking on a career in the G League systems of the Raptors and Knicks. Last year with Westchester, Noel appeared in 29 games and averaged 10.6 points and 2.1 assists.\n\nThe Ukranian-born Skapintsev also appeared in the G League last season, playing 42 games and shooting over 59 percent from the field with 6.9 points and 5.4 boards. Standing at 7-1, Skapintsev was one of the breakout stars of the Knicks' recent Summer League activities in Las Vegas, coming off the bench to put up 7.4 points and 6.6 boards in just over 17 minutes a game.\n\nJULY 30 KNICKS BRING BACK DUANE WASHINGTON JR.\n\nThe Knicks announced on Sunday that Duane Washington Jr. would be brought back on a new contract less than a week after he was granted his release. Washington is the latest in a series of mini-transactions for the Knicks, added to a list that also includes Nathan Knight and Dylan Windler.\n\nA second-generation NBA athlete, Washington as an undrafted free agent out of Ohio State in 2021. He came to New York in late February after his release from the Phoenix Suns, where he averaged 7.9 points and two assists in 31 appearances. Washington did not appear in any games for the NBA team but scored 83 points over four showings with the Knicks' Westchester-branded G League group.\n\nJULY 26 KNICKS TO FACE TIMBERWOLVES IN PRESEASON CLASH\n\nThe reveal of the Minnesota Timberwolves' upcoming preseason schedule offered a nugget of the Knicks' future: Madison Square Garden will host an exhibition between New York and Minnesota with tip-off scheduled for 7:30 p.m. ET.\n\nOctober's trip to MSG will be part of a busy preseason slate for the Timberwolves, who open with two showdowns with the Dallas Mavericks in Abu Dhabi. After the Knicks game, they'll face Israeli club Maccabi Ra'anana before wrapping things up against the Chicago Bulls on the road.\n\nIn addition to head coach Tom Thibodeau, who spent three seasons at the helm of the Wolves, the Knicks will likely showcase the services of former Minnesotan Nathan Knight, who recently joined the team on a two-way deal.\n\nJULY 24 KNICKS SIGN DYLAN WINDLER ON TWO-WAY CONTRACT\n\nPer Adrian Wojnarowski, the New York Knicks are signing former Cleveland Cavaliers forward Dylan Windler on a two-way contract. As a 2019 first-round pick to the Cavaliers, the 6-6 forward had lost opportunity and playing time, appearing in 84 games in three seasons (including only thee last season).\n\nThe near 27-year-old played just three games last season and has dealt with numerous injuries. If Windler can get healthy, he poses a potential 3&D wing to add depth for the Knicks. Finding a way to remain available to the squad will be important for the Belmont alum as he looks to eventually find a standard contract with the team.\n\nJULY 21 KEMBA WALKER SIGNS WITH AS MONACO BASKET\n\nPer Marc Stein, former New York Knicks point guard Kemba Walker has signed with AS Monaco Basket, which participates in premier French league LNB Pro A. The club recently earned its first title in its domestic league, topping the Metropolitans 92 team led by top NBA Draft pick Victor Wembanyama.\n\nWalker, 33, earned four All-Star appearances between Charlotte and Boston before joining the Knicks for the 2021-22 season. He failed to fill the long-standing point guard void in Manhattan (since filled by Jalen Brunson), averaging 11.6 points and 3.5 assists in 37 games before an injury shut him down for most of the second half. Walker played nine games with the Dallas Mavericks last season in his most recent NBA action\n\nJULY 19 KNICKS ADD SYRACUSE NATIVE NATHAN KNIGHT ON TWO-WAY DEAL\n\nPer Anil Gogna of No Trade Clause, the New York Knicks will add Nathan Knight on a two-way contract. Knight, 25, has 108 games of NBA experience under his belt including 38 last season with the Minnesota Timberwolves.\n\nA Syracuse native, Knight made a name for himself at William & Mary, winning the CAA Men's Basketball Player of the Year Award in 2020. In that season, Knight also earned the CAA's Defensive Player of the Year Award, as well as the Lou Henson Award annually bestowed to the most outstanding mid-major college basketball player.\n\nThis creates an interesting situation surrounding the Knicks' two-way situation, as Knight joins Duane Washington Jr. and recent Summer League participant Jaylen Martin ass those potentially commuting between Manhattan and Westchester.\n\nJULY 17 ROKAS JOKUBAITIS EXTENDS BARCELONA CONTRACT\n\nNew York Knicks draft pick Rokas Jokubaitis apparently will not make his NBA debut this season, as the Lithuanian-born prospect has added another year to his contract with Spanish club FC Barcelona.\n\nJokibaitis came to the Knicks in a draft day trade in 2021 shortly after the Oklahoma City Thunder made him the 34th pick. With the exception of a three-game Summer League showing in 2021, Jokubaitis has spent his whole career overseas, where he built a solid professional career as an outside shooter (notably hitting 56 percent of his attempts from three-point range in his first season with Barca in 2021-22).\n\nIn addition to returning to Spain, Jokubaitis is also set to rep Lithuania in the upcoming FIBA Basketball World Cup, where he'll compete against fellow Knicks Jalen Brunson and Josh Hart (USA), RJ Barrett (Canada), and Evan Fournier (France).\n\nJULY 16 SUNS TRADE CAMERON PAYNE TO SAN ANTONIO\n\nA flurry of moves from the Phoenix Suns was headlined by the trading of backcourt bench prescience Cameron Payne to the San Antonio Spurs. Payne was said to be a target of the New York Knicks in a three-team deal with the Indiana Pacers that eventually fell through.\n\nPer Shams Charania, the deal will also send a second-round pick and cash to the Spurs, who transfer a future second-round choice. In addition to dealing Payne, Phoenix, loaded with big expectations and big contracts after adding Bradley Beal to a team that already featured Devin Booker and Kevin Durant, signed Bol Bol to a one-year deal and brought in three second-round picks from Orlando in a different deal that features a first-round pick swap in 2026.\n\nJULY 12 KNICKS PROSPECT ROKAS JOKUBATIS TO REP LITHUANIA AT WORLD CUP\n\nAnother New Yorker is on his way to the FIBA World Cup, as Knicks prospect Rokas Jokubatis has been named to Lithuania's roster at the upcoming competition in Asia.\n\nJokubatis, a draft day arrival in 2021 after a trade with Oklahoma City has played almost entirely overseas with the exception of a Summer League tour in 2021. He has developed a reputation as a prolific three-pointer shooter, notably sinking over 56 percent of his attempts from deep during the 2021-22 season with FC Barcelona.\n\nOther New York representation in Lithuania includes 2019 second-round choice Ignas Brazdeikis. The team is looking to improve on a ninth-place posting in the last World Cup in 2019 and will compete in Group D in Pasay against Egypt, Mexico, and Montenegro.\n\nJULY 11 KNICKS SCOUT 2013 1ST ROUNDER MCLEMORE, JOHNSON\n\nPer SNY's Ian Begley, the Knicks attended private workouts featuring 2013 first-round pick Ben McLemore and tenured professional veteran Alize Johnson as they work through Vegas Summer League play.\n\nMcLemore, best known for his brief collegiate endeavors at the University of Kansas, did not appear in the NBA last season, though he averaged over 10 points a game in 64 games in Portland in 2021-22. His more recent play placed him with Shandong Hi-Speed Kirin of the Chinese Basketball Association. McLemore was the seventh overall pick of the 2013 draft, originally chosen by the Sacramento Kings.\n\nMeanwhile, Johnson has lingered in the systems of eight different NBA teams, most recently spending most of last year with Milwaukee's G League team, the Wisconsin Herd, in Oshkosh. At 6-8, it appears that the Knicks are doing their due diligence on potential replacements for Obi Toppin behind Julius Randle.\n\nJULY 10 NEW YORK TIMES DISBANDS SPORTS DEPARTMENT\n\nThe New York Times, one of the most prominent and longest-running daily newspapers in the country, announced on Monday that it would disband its sports department, turning over daily coverage affairs to The Athletic, which was purchased by The Times in early 2022.\n\n“We plan to focus even more directly on distinctive, high-impact news and enterprise journalism about how sports intersect with money, power, culture, politics, and society at large,” NYT editors Monica Drake and Joe Kahn wrote in an email to The Times newsroom. \"At the same time, we will scale back the newsroom’s coverage of games, players, teams, and leagues.”\n\nNo layoffs are planned for the time being, with the Times' current sports staff expected to be transferred to other roles.\n\nJULY 5 KNICKS GIVE BRYCE JAMES 'PRIORITY' SCOUTING AT PEACH JAM\n\n\"James to the Knicks\" will continue long after LeBron James has moved on from the hardwood.\n\nPer Krysten Peek of Yahoo! Sports, the Knicks were one of several teams whose scouts \"made (Bryce) James a priority\" at the Peach Jam AAU showcase in South Carolina. James, the youngest son of current Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron, is said to have \"excellent shooting mechanics and a high release.\" He scored 12 points as his prep group, California-based Strive for Greatness, earned a victory in the opening day of the competition.\n\nIn addition to James, the Knicks were also reported to have an eye on NBAPA camp MVP Cameron Boozer and 6-foot-8 win A.J. Dybantsa.\n\nJULY 4 FORMER KNICKS G DERRICK ROSE GETS A FAMILIAR NUMBER BACK\n\nA former Chicago Bull wearing No. 23 is equally vital to Memphis as it is to the Windy City.\n\nWith Derrick Rose making his way to the Memphis Grizzlies, the former New York Knicks guard is set to don familiar digits, as he will wear the number 23 he had in college at Memphis University. Rose's wife Alania had the honors of the reveal, doing so on her Instagram account as the veteran made his way back.\n\nIn his first Memphis tour in 2007-08, Rose earned All-American honors in a single collegiate season that saw the Tigers post a 38-2 record en route to the NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament's championship game. While Memphis was forced to vacate that season's accomplishments due to fabrication of Rose's SAT scores, he played them into top pick honors at the NBA Draft, going to Chicago before spending two terms with the Knicks.\n\nRose wore Nos. 25 and 4 with the Knicks, the latter during his three-season tour that ended when the Knicks declined his $15.6 million player option.\n\nJULY 3 JACOB TOPPIN TO MISS SUMMER LEAGUE PLAY\n\nKeeping up with the apparent theme of ejecting Toppins from the lineup, the New York Knicks will not have undrafted rookie Jacob Toppin on their Summer League roster.\n\nPer Ian Begley of SNY, Toppin is dealing with a \"minor injury\" that will keep him out of the upcoming prospect showcase in Las Vegas. Toppin, who spent his collegiate days at Rhode Island and Kentucky, was signed to a two-way deal shortly after the draft, averaging 7.4 points and 4.5 rebounds. His older brother is set to be traded to the Indiana Pacers on Thursday after a trade was reportedly agreed upon over the weekend.\n\nThe Knicks' Summer League affairs tip-off on Saturday when they face the Philadelphia 76ers' prospects.\n\nJULY 1 DAMIAN LILLARD REQUESTS TRADE, KNICKS NEXT?\n\nDamian Lillard will no longer be blazing a trail in the Pacific Northwest.\n\nBleacher Report's Chris Haynes has reported that Damian Lillard has officially requested a trade from the Portland Trail Blazers, ending the seven-time All-Star's 11-year run with the team. With Portland poised to go younger, Lillard will apparently get a chance to move on to a contending squad. The closest he came with the Blazers was in 2019, when the team reached the Western Conference Finals but ran into the Golden State juggernaut.\n\nWhile the Knicks seem rather set in the backcourt, having inked Jalen Brunson and enjoying the breakout of Immanuel Quickley, they've lingered in Lillard conversations for as long as his Portland status has been in doubt. Lillard previously built a strong relationship with Josh Hart, who was dealt to the Knicks at the trade deadline and recently inked his $12.9 million player option.\n\nJUNE 30 PACERS ADD KNICKS TARGET, NBA CHAMPION BRUCE BROWN\n\nFormer Brooklyn Net and reigning NBA champion Bruce Brown has turned a chance to return to New York City, instead inking a two-year, $45 million according to ESPN. Brown spent last season with the Denver Nuggets, from whom he turned down a $6.8 million player option.\n\nBrown was capable of playing nearly every position on the floor in Denver, where he averaged a career-best 11.5 points last season. He'd later partake in all 20 games of the Nuggets' run to the first NBA championship in franchise history. Brown notably tallied 21 points off the bench in the penultimate victory of the NBA Finals against Miami\n\nJUNE 29 JAMES HARDEN AGREES TO PLAYER OPTION, TRADE NEXT?\n\nKnicks fans may have to be patient with the availability of Joel Embiid, but another star from the City of Brotherly Love ... beyond the Villanova prospects they have and are targeting ... may be available.\n\nPer ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski, James Harden has agreed to his $35.6 million player option with the Philadelphia 76ers, which will be used to collaborate on a trade. Wojnarowski says that the Knicks are among the teams interested in a trade, as are the Los Angeles Clippers.\n\nIn his first full season with the 76ers since he was traded over from the Brooklyn Nets, Harden averaged 21 points and led the Association at 10.7 assists per game. Those efforts, however, weren't enough to push the Sixers past the Eastern Conference semifinal round, as they fell to the Boston Celtics in seven games.\n\nJUNE 28 BLAZERS NOT EXPECTED TO BESTOW QUALIFYING OFFER TO CAM REDDISH\n\nPer Michael Scotto of HoopsHype, the Portland Trail Blazers will not extend a qualifying offer to former New York Knicks reserve Cam Reddish, which will make him an unrestricted free agent. Reddish spent parts of the last two seasons in New York and was sent to the Pacific Northwest in a deal that landed the Knicks Josh Hart.\n\nReddish has not come anywhere near to living up to the hype of being the 10th overall pick of the 2019 draft. In the final stanzas of his New York career, Reddish made eight starts and was perhaps most famous in New York lore for a dominant showing on opening night in Memphis, scoring 22 points off the bench and hitting a buzzer-beating equalizer that sent the game into overtime.\n\nAfter the trade to the Blazers, Reddish made 20 more appearances (12 starts) and averaged 12 points with 2.9 rebounds.\n\nJUNE 28 KNICKS ADD FORDHAM STAR KHALID MOORE\n\nThe New York Knicks didn't have to look far for their next acquisition.\n\nFordham University announced that forward Khalid Moore will join the Knicks' Summer League roster when play tips off in Las Vegas next week. Moore enjoyed a breakout season in one of the most lucrative seasons in the history of Rams basketball: as a graduate transfer, Moore ranked in the Atlantic 10's top ten in both scoring (15.7) and rebounding (6.7), earning third-team all-conference honors for his efforts.\n\nThanks to Moore's efforts and more, the Rams earned a program-record 12 wins in conference play this season and their 25 total victories were their best since the 1990-91 campaign.\n\nJUNE 26 KNICKS TURN TO COLLEGE RANKS FOR SUMMER LEAGUE ROSTER ARRIVAL\n\nIndiana University confirmed that former Hoosiers forward Race Thompson will be part of the Knicks' Summer League endeavors. Thompson played five seasons in Bloomington and ranks seventh in new-century IU history with 196 offensive rebounds. He averaged 7.7 and 5.5 boards in his career while earning an Honorable Mention for the All-Big Ten team in 2021-22. Thompson is poised to join fellow undrafted NBA freshmen Jaylen Martin and Jacob Toppin in Las Vegas as the Knicks look to build upon a runner-up finish in the annual showcase.\n\nThe Knicks' 2023 NBA Summer League action will tip off on July 8, when they take on the Philadelphia 76ers' prospects.\n\nJUNE 24 T'WOLVES TAKE PAC-12 DPOY WITH KNICKS' PICK\n\nIn the wee hours of Friday morning, the Minnesota Timberwolves used a pick that originally belonged to the Knicks to select UCLA guard Jaylen Clark. New York originally dealt that choice, which became the 53rd overall pick, to Charlotte in a cost-cutting move during the last draft before the Hornets sent it north shortly after.\n\nClark brings with him a fair amount of defensive prowess, winning the Defensive Player of the Year award from both the Pac-12 Conference and Naismith committee. He also nearly doubled his scoring output from the prior campaign, averaging a career-best 13 points per game. He fell in the draft due to an Achilles injury, one that ended his season early and will likely postpone his professional debut.\n\nJUNE 23 MAVERICKS TRADE KNICKS' WOULD-BE PICK TO OKLAHOMA CITY\n\nWhat could've been NYC's is OKC's.\n\nThe Dallas Mavericks traded the 10th pick in the 2023 NBA Draft to the Oklahoma City Thunder during Thursday's opening round"
