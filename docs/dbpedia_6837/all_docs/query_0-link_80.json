        "text": "Spike Lee’s third feature, Do the Right Thing, is an unabashed look at race relations in New York City in the late-80s. Often considered the director’s magnum opus, the movie takes place in Brooklyn’s Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood during a single, sweltering summer day. And as the heat rises, so do tensions, culminating with a fiery riot.\n\nStarring Lee as the main protagonist, Mookie, the movie is filled with a powerhouse cast, many of whom were relatively unknown at the time. Veteran actors Ossie Davis and Danny Aiello lead the pack, supported by a slew of folks who have since become household names, such as Samuel L. Jackson, John Turturro, Rosie Perez, and Martin Lawrence. In addition, the movie has supporting roles with a young Giancarlo Esposito (best known for playing Gus Fring in the Breaking Bad universe) and Paul Benjamin, one of my favorite character actors of the 1970s.\n\nOf course, for me personally, the most interesting aspect of Do the Right Thing is its NYC filming locations, all of which are on a single block in Brooklyn, making identifying them fairly straightforward.\n\nRadio Station\n\nEver since its release in 1989, it’s been no secret as to where they shot Do the Right Thing. Part of the movie’s publicity involved touting the on-location photography in Bed-Stuy, Brooklyn. Also, a companion book was released at the same time which included Spike Lee’s journal as well as detailed production notes. The book even had a map of Stuyvesant Avenue, clearly showing what buildings were used for which scenes.\n\nSo needless to say, it wasn’t necessary to do any extensive research to figure out the movie’s locations, which can sort of be a relief, but can also take the fun out of things. The absence of any major legwork makes the whole process of plotting locations fairly rote and uneventful. It also limits the possibility of stumbling onto some unexpected historical tangent, which invariably happens when I’m scouring old books, newspapers and websites in my search of a filming spot.\n\nThe Yes Jesus Baptist Church\n\nWhen I first began investigating this movie back in 2017, I knew they filmed it on Stuyvesant Avenue between Quincy and Lexington, but I had yet to discover the map included in the Do the Right Thing companion book detailing all the specific addresses. So when it came to the Yes Jesus Baptist Church, since I couldn’t find any church buildings on that street block, I initially thought it might’ve been located somewhere else. But after consulting a couple movie locations websites, the consensus was that production installed a false facade to the lower half of the apartment building at 184 Stuyvesant.\n\nOnce there in person, I could tell the building at no. 184 was indeed the one used as the church. But since the only clear shot of the church in the film was from a low angle looking up, it took me a little bit of scrutinizing to figure out how far up the facade went. After a little back and forth, I finally concluded it stopped at the second floor.\n\nIn the end, they did a pretty good job in recreating what a lot of churches look like in that part of Brooklyn — small in size, long in name, and occasionally connected to a residential property. And with a huge false front covering the bottom half of the building, I can only assume the space was abandoned with no one living inside.\n\nThere were actually a couple abandoned buildings on that block when production arrived there, which according to Lee, were being used as crack houses. Once it was decided they were going to film there, the film’s security team (which was made up of members of Fruit of Islam) ejected the dealers from the buildings.\n\nAfterwards, they boarded one up and turned the other one into a working set. So, I’m guessing 184 Stuyvesant Avenue was one of those buildings.\n\nSal’s Famous Pizzeria\n\nThere are many reasons why this Bed-Stuy block was chosen by Lee and his team. One of them was that it provided the space needed to build this pizza parlor, which was the main focal point of the film’s story.\n\nFrom the beginning, Lee made it clear he wanted to shoot the movie on a single block in Brooklyn, so the location scout had to find the perfect place that could satisfy all the creative departments’ different needs.\n\nAside from having an empty lot to build the pizza place, cinematographer Ernest Dickerson requested that they pick a street that went north-south. The reason was that since the sun travels from east to west, during most of the day, one side of the street would always be in shadow, making it easier to control the lighting.\n\nKeeping that in mind, the location scout spent weeks combing the streets of Brooklyn, compiling a photo book of several potential spots. But almost immediately, everyone agreed that that one-block area on Stuyvesant Avenue was the best choice. Lee later recounted:\n\nThe block had everything that we needed: brownstones which weren’t too upscale or too dilapidated. And, most importantly, it had two empty lots that faced each other, where we could build sets for the Korean market and Sal’s Famous Pizzeria. Once we decided on the block, [production designer] Wynn [Thomas] went to work designing the sets and supervising construction.\n\nIn addition to constructing the pizza shop, Korean market and church, production fixed up some of the apartment buildings, which principally involved giving them a fresh coat of paint.\n\nMookie\n\nLike the church, the specific addresses of Mookie’s and Mother Sister’s buildings were readily available on the web by the late-2010s. But when you’re on Stuyvesant Avenue in person, it can be a little tricky to match up the correct doors and windows.\n\nOne reason is that many of these brownstones are very similar looking, and since they abut each other, it can sometimes be hard to tell where one building starts and the other one ends. Also, several of these buildings have received some updates, making them look a little different from how they appeared in 1988.\n\nAnother change that has occured since 1988 (which you might’ve noticed in these “before/after” images) is that there are now a lot more trees lining the block. In fact, one of the reasons Lee picked this particular Brooklyn block is because there was apparently only one tree on it, basically leaving a stark, shadeless environment that was ideal for the story.\n\nOver the last century, there’s been a concerted effort to plant more trees in NYC, but those plans tended to focus on the more affluent, high-profile neighborhoods. That’s because past tree-planting locations were by and large chosen by the city. But in 1980, a new program was developed that allowed residents to request a leafy addition to their block, which has led to the city foresting many formerly barren areas in all five boroughs, such as this one on Stuyvesant Avenue.\n\nRadio Raheem\n\nAs far as I could tell, the stoop featured in this scene was a location that wasn’t specifically identified on any movie websites, probably because nothing very pivotal in the story happens there. But I thought it was still worthwhile to figure out, especially since this brief scene features a young Martin Lawrence in his first feature film.\n\nDa Mayor\n\nLike the previous Mookie sequence, this sequence with Da Mayor took place at Mother Sister’s apartment and Sal’s Pizzeria. While we don’t go inside Mother Sister’s apartment at this point, near the end of the movie, there’s a great crane shot that starts inside her bedroom and glides out the window and into the street.\n\nIt might be noted that all the apartment interiors were shot on location on Stuyvesant Avenue in Brooklyn. In my research, I couldn’t find much info as to what was done where, but the map in the Do the Right Thing book indicated that the exterior of Mookie’s apartment was 173 Stuyvesant Avenue, while the interior scenes were filmed somewhere else.\n\nFor logistical purposes, it would make sense that they would do all the apartment interiors in one building. And since the only scene where you can see both inside and outside was in Mother Sister’s apartment at 167 Stuyvesant Avenue, my guess would be that they did everything else in that building, too, just on different floors.\n\nThe Corner Men\n\nThese scenes with the Corner Men were the only ones that weren’t technically filmed on Stuyvesant Avenue, but were just a few feet to the east on Lexington Avenue.\n\nVisually speaking, this is arguably the most vibrant and iconic location from the movie — even more so than Sal’s Pizzeria. It was the one place I was most eager to see in person, although I was a little disappointed to discover that an iron fence has since been erected around the building. But fortunately, I was able to take photos of the spot just before the property owners decided to cover the fence with thick shrubbery, completely obscuring any views of the famous brick wall.\n\nOf course, that brick wall was one of several spots that were spruced up for the film. The bright red color not only helped convey a sense of heat, it also uplifted the look of the neighborhood, which at the time, was one of the worst in America. While more desirable these days, in the 1970s and 80s, Bed-Stuy was an impoverished community with abject conditions, having some of the highest unemployment rates, infant mortalities, and drug-related homicides in NYC.\n\nIt’s pretty impressive Spike Lee was adamant about shooting there, especially considering that most mainstream film productions in the 1980s hardly ever ventured off the safe confines of Manhattan Island.\n\nWall of Fame\n\nIt wasn’t until the late 1990s that I saw Do the Right Thing in its entirety, but I was already quite familiar with this scene involving Sal’s “Wall of Fame,” knowing it was sort of the crux of the whole storyline.\n\nAt that time, I was also already familiar with the character actor, Giancarlo Esposito, who played the scene’s instigator, Buggin’ Out. I mostly knew him from the Tim Robbins’ satirical film, Bob Roberts, and the crime thriller, The Usual Suspects.\n\nAlthough, the reason he stood out to me was because I kind of thought he was a bit of an overactor. Of course, I was pleased to finally see him do an amazing understated performance in the TV shows Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul.\n\nWhile the Gus Fring character is supposedly Chilean, the Buggin’ Out character, who leads the fight against the Italian-American clan, is African-American — which is ironic considering Esposito is half-Italian himself.\n\nFire Hydrant\n\nFinding the hydrant used in this scene was pretty easy since it was almost directly in front of a building that was already identified as the home of Lawrence’s character, Cee. Also, it’s the only hydrant on that block.\n\nWhile I’m sure it was fun for the people living there to watch the hydrant spray into an open convertible, they were probably a little disappointed they couldn’t use the hydrant themselves for most of that hot summer. It’s kind of emblematic of the situation that arises when a production takes over a residential area for an extended period of time. There’s always a delicate balancing act of making sure the locals are being appeased, but doing so without sacrificing the artistic goals of the movie.\n\nIn anticipation of this, Lee decided to throw a large block party the Saturday before they began shooting as a way to bolster goodwill between the crew and the neighborhood. It not only sent a message that he was cognizant of the people there, but it gave him the opportunity to explain to them what to expect during the shoot.\n\nIt seemed to work, as there were reportedly no major complaints or disruptions during the eight weeks they were there. And as a continued appreciation for the folks in that neighborhood, Lee regularly throws summer block parties on Stuyvesant, often on the late Michael Jackson’s birthday as a sort of dual celebration.\n\nBack at the Radio Station\n\nLining up the “before/after” images for the radio station location was a little tricky at first until it became clear that the brownstone’s entrance was in a different spot. In the movie, it’s on the left side of the building, but today, it’s in the middle.\n\nI originally assumed the entrance was already on the left in 1988 and was moved to the center by the property owners at some point after the movie was made. However, if you look at the tax photo of the building from circa 1984, you can see the entrance was in the center, just as it is today.\n\nThat means production must’ve moved the building’s entrance to the left when they built the radio station set, probaby to make the station look bigger. I can only assume they reinstalled the front stoop to its original spot after they wrapped in September of 1988.\n\nYuppie’s Brownstone\n\nWith such a short block being used for this film shoot, you’d think there’d be no problem identifying the buildings used in any given scene. However, I must admit, I had to watch this scene a couple times in slow motion before figuring out the correct stoop they stopped at. What I basically ended up doing was count the number of doors and windows he passes on his way from the radio station.\n\nOne problem, as I mentioned earlier, is that many of the buildings look the same, such as the one at 180 Stuyvesant Avenue and its neighbor to the right. So, it’s easy to get confused. In fact, I found at least one movie site that identified the yuppie’s building to be at 178A instead of 180. It’s understandable since there’s hardly any difference between the two entrances besides the current paint jobs.\n\nA Litany of Racial Jabs\n\nEven though all the specific addresses from this montage weren’t listed on any websites, all it took was a little looking around in Google Street View to figure out what character was standing where.\n\nThe last two ranting characters —Officer Long and Sonny— give us a nice view of the Korean Market that was built by production across the street from the pizzeria. You even get to see the Lexington Avenue side of it when the cop (played by Danny Aiello’s real-life son, Rick) gives his little tirade.\n\nFor a long time, I knew the pizza shop was a set built by the film, but I didn’t realize the Korean market was also a set until a few years ago. In retrospect, I should’ve suspected that it wasn’t real, as it’s not terribly convincing looking. The exterior is decent, although it’s kind of flat and unweathered.\n\nBut the interior definitely didn’t look like any Korean deli I’ve ever been to before. It was way too clean and organized. Most of these small markets, regardless of the neighborhood they’re in or who’s running them, are crammed with as many different products as possible, without wasting any space. And in that group of products, you will invariably find a few weird, dust-covered items you’ve never heard of before.\n\nBut this sanitized, abstract version of the market seems to fit the overall look of the film and was possibly done deliberately.\n\nIf you’re familiar with this movie, you know it ends with Sal’s pizza shop being burned down, so it makes sense production wanted to construct it themselves. But the reasons for constructing the Korean market, which doesn’t suffer any major damage, isn’t as obvious. I’d guess the main advantage of making their own set was they’d have more control of the environment and wouldn’t have to deal with the owner(s) of a real market.\n\nThere’s still empty lots where the market and pizza shop used to sit, which is surprising considering how much more valuable the real estate area has become. And honestly, I’d be very surprised if they remained vacant for very much longer.\n\nWhile the pizza shop lot is being used for parking, the Korean market lot doesn’t seem to be being used for anything. The unpaved patch of land looks pretty neglected, except for a splendid mural on the neighboring wall that was painted in 2019 in celebration of the movie’s 30 year anniversary. The painting depicts the cast members who have passed away, but is missing Danny Aiello and Paul Benjamin who died shortly after it was completed.\n\nThere’s also a mural on the wall in the pizza shop lot which is a reproduction of the one that appeared in the movie across the street.\n\nAccording to a local woman I chatted with while taking modern pictures of the locations, the mural in the movie was actually on a canvas that was draped onto the side of the building. But on the DVD audio commentary, production designer Wynn Thomas seemed to indicate that it was painted directly on the wall. In fact, he noted his surprise when he discovered the mural had already started to fade by the early 1990s.\n\nRegardless, that wall is now obscured by a modern apartment building that was constructed on the corner in 2004.\n\nLove & Hate\n\nThis is a seminal scene that sets up the two battling forces that will ultimately lead to the dramatic conclusion to this film. Like many of the scenes in Do the Right Thing, it’s highly stylized, shot slightly off-kilter with a very wide lens, and featuring an exceptionally theatrical performance by Bill Nunn.\n\nOf course, the “Love-Hate” monologue Nunn delivers is an homage to the 1955 thriller, The Night of the Hunter, starring Robert Mitchum, whose “preacher” character had love and hate tattooed on his knuckles.\n\nDeath and Destruction at Sal’s\n\nThe Next Morning\n\nKnowing that Sal’s Pizzeria was going to be burned down at the end, the crew built the set using specific materials that would better allow them to control the fire and make things as safe as possible. But by doing so, I’d be curious if that affected the overall look of the shop.\n\nLike the market across the street, the interior of Sal’s Famous Pizzeria was a bit unrealistic looking, not so much because it didn’t look like a real pizza shop, but because it didn’t look like the ones that were in Brooklyn. Most of the shops by the 1980s looked more like fast food restaurants with bright formica accoutrements. The only NYC shop I know of that looks like the one in this movie is Patsy’s Pizzeria on First Avenue in Manhattan (complete with photos of famous Italian-Americans on the walls).\n\nThat being said, to add a little sense of realism, the set actually had working ovens installed there, allowing the actors to bake pizza pies on the premises. As a result, it’s been claimed that several local Brooklynites tried to go into the shop, thinking it was real.\n\nWhile Sal’s was just a set created by the film crew, there did used to be a similar-looking, one-story building on that corner lot about a decade or so prior. In the 1930s and 40s, it was the Stuyvesant Bar & Grill and by the late 1950s, it had become a laundromat — although, according to a newspaper article, it appears to had been abandoned by 1963. By that point, the neighborhood was starting to become quite downtrodden with a growing crime rate.\n\nIt’s hard to know for sure, but I’m guessing the small, vacant building at 170 Stuyvesant Avenue was torn down sometime in the late 60s or early 70s.\n\nJudging by a circa 1983 tax photo of the address, after the building was taken down, the empty lot became some sort of a derelict shanty town with makeshift structures. It definitely was a far cry from what Bedford-Stuyvesant is like today.\n\nAlthough, one could argue that the depiction of Bedford-Stuyvesant in this movie was quite different from what it was really like at the time.\n\nAs with many of Spike Lee’s efforts, there was a certain amount of controversy surrounding Do the Right Thing during its initial release. But today, most film historians would agree that it has become a relevant part of the annals of cinema.\n\nLee’s uncanny style of storytelling worked to perfection here, conjuring up an ebullient Brooklyn neighborhood filled with a gallimaufry of larger-than-life characters. Told in almost a collage form, Do the Right Thing is a visceral allegory, with a strong foothold in both reality and fantasy.\n\nAlways the rabble-rouser, Spike Lee clearly wanted to expose moviegoers to the plight of these black communities in an explosive way. And yet, by creating a sort of surreal setting through stylized cinematography and vibrant production design, I think he made the subject matter more palatable, for both white and black audiences.\n\nThe movie deals with some tough questions about race, community and violence, but it’s still very entertaining, and at times, quite funny. By avoiding that gritty semi-documentary feel that was so prevalent in 1970s cinema, Lee created a movie that allowed audiences to witness some unpleasant things without being completely turned off.\n\nIn fact, even though it was shot on location, by limiting the action to a single block, it actually gives off a vibe of taking place on a studio backlot. Consequently, you unconsciously never forget you’re watching a movie. Personally for me, it’s hard to say whether this is a drawback or a great advantage. But one thing is for sure, there’s no other movie I can think of quite like Do the Right Thing."
