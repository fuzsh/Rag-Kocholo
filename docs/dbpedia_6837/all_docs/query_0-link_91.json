Philip Kaufman directed the film based on the book by Tom Wolfe.\n\nThe poster measures 33” x 47” and is in very good to excellent condition with minimal edge and fold wear from previous handling. It was folded at the time of printing. Most folds flatten out nicely for framing and are often desirable for vintage and collectible movie posters.\n\nPlease look closely at the photo (this is the exact poster you are buying). It is not cropped or a stock image. The black squares in the corners of the poster are magnets and not pins.\n\nThis rare and collectible poster, printed in 1984 to promote the German theatrical release of The Right Stuff, is not a reprint or a reproduction.\n\nCERTIFICATE OF AUTHENTICITY (COA) INCLUDED"
