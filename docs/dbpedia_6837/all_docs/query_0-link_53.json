The upper part of Atlas is strengthened by an eight-inch wide stainless steel band. The capsule was recovered less than one hour after launch. The altitude was 108 miles. Speed was 13,000 mph. Recovered 1,425 miles downrange.

The astronauts are, left-to-right: Cooper, Schirra, Shepard, Grissom, Glenn, Slayton and Carpenter. (Public Domain/NASA)\n\nof\n\nAstronaut John Glenn, Jr. is honored by President John F. Kennedy after his historical first manned orbital flight, Mercury-Atlas 6. The ceremony was held at the NASA facility in Florida.

The MA-6 mission was the first manned orbital flight boosted by the Mercury-Atlas vehicle, a modified Atlas ICBM (Intercontinental Ballistic Missile), lasted for five hours, and orbited the Earth three times.
