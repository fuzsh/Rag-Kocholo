        "text": "It's an exciting time to film in Northern California, especially on The San Francisco Peninsula. Just south of San Francisco and just north of San Jose, The San Francisco Peninsula has a huge variety in environments to set the stage perfectly for your next project. Without traveling more than 20 minutes, you can find yourself at beaches, parks, mountains, varied downtowns, industrial areas, and more. The region is bordered on the east by the San Francisco Bay and on the west by the Pacific Ocean, offering your production team both scenic beauty and the excitement of a cosmopolitan community for featured films, commercials, television shows, and media productions. You may already recognize the San Francisco Peninsula in movies, TV shows, car commercials and more, but there is so much left to be explored with film. See below for the active list of movies filmed in San Mateo County.\n\nWith 20 charming and picturesque cities and towns, including miles of stunning coastal and Bayfront shores, redwood forests, country roads, and the renowned high-tech Silicon Valley, we can assist you in finding that perfect location you've been looking for. We would be happy to assist you in accessing and submitting permits, contacts with our partners, logistical help, and otherwise anything else you'd need.

Filoli was featured in the Wedding Planner (2001).\n\n5.
