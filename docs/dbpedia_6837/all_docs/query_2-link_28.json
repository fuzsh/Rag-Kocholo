        "text": "Summary\n\nSci-fi movies of the 1950s reflected Cold War anxieties and explored futuristic themes from popular novels of the era.\n\nThe 1950s saw adaptations of classic sci-fi novels like The War of the Worlds and Journey to the Center of the Earth, revitalizing their themes.\n\nFilms like The Thing From Another World and Invasion of the Body Snatchers played on fears of the time, influenced by the space race and the aftermath of the Second World War.\n\nThe 1950s produced plenty of memorable sci-fi book adaptations, as filmmakers sought inspiration from both pulp fiction and well-respected authors. In the aftermath of the Second World War, and with the Cold War in full swing, sci-fi in the 1950s reflected the common anxieties of the era. The atomic age and the space race both represented frightening new frontiers in the world of science, and many sci-fi movies also borrowed from the horror genre.\n\nIn one way or another, the best sci-fi movies of the 1950s explored what could happen in the near future. Studios often looked for inspiration from the popular sci-fi novels of the era. In other cases, they saw the timeless themes of older classics by authors from previous centuries. Book adaptations produced some classics of the sci-fi genre in the 1950s, including Invasion of the Body Snatchers and The War of the Worlds.\n\n10 The Thing From Another World (1951)\n\nBased on Who Goes There? by John W. Campbell\n\nJohn W. Campbell’s novella “Who Goes There?” is probably most famous these days as the basis for John Carpenter’s sci-fi/horror classic The Thing, but it was adapted into a movie over 30 years earlier. The Thing From Another World is a very different kind of monster movie. While Carpenter’s version is all about paranoia and mistrust, The Thing From Another World is a more traditional monster movie.\n\nJohn W. Campbell’s novella “Who Goes There?” is probably most famous these days as the basis for John Carpenter’s sci-fi/horror classic\n\nThe Thing,\n\nbut it was adapted into a movie over 30 years earlier.\n\nThe Thing From Another World is one of many great monster movies from the 1950s, and the Thing is typical of the era’s menacing creature designs. The hulking plant-based brute fed into fears of the unknown as humanity was starting to dip its toe into space exploration. Howard Hawks is listed as the film’s writer and producer, but the shot composition and overlapping, naturalistic dialogue scenes suggest that he may have also had a hand in The Thing From Another World‘s direction.\n\n9 The War Of The Worlds (1953)\n\nBased on The War of the Worlds by H.G. Wells\n\nH.G. Wells’ The War of the Worlds is one of the most influential sci-fi novels of all time, and it has been adapted into several movies, TV shows and radio dramas. The 1953 film version is a brilliant alien invasion movie which constituted a great leap forward for sci-fi. The movie features a race of technologically advanced aliens waging war on Earth in their tripod-shaped spacecraft.\n\nThe War of the Worlds\n\nwas first published in 1898, but this film adaptation came after audiences had already witnessed the large-scale horrors of two world wars.\n\nThe War of the Worlds was first published in 1898, but this film adaptation came after audiences had already witnessed the large-scale horrors of two world wars. Suddenly, the prospect of humanity’s demise didn’t seem so fanciful. The aliens in The War of the Worlds played on contemporary fears of outside invaders coming to destroy the established status quo, but it’s just as much about humanity’s muddled response to existential threats.\n\n8 This Island Earth (1955)\n\nBased on This Island Earth by Raymond F. Jones\n\nThis Island Earth was an eye-popping sci-fi spectacle when it was first released, with gorgeous technicolor and plenty of creative visual effects. This Island Earth is an expansive space opera about a race of bug-eyed aliens who use the Earth as a pawn in an intergalactic war. Humans fight back to regain their independence and their autonomy, but they are powerless in a game that they can’t comprehend.\n\nThis Island Earth\n\nwas an eye-popping sci-fi spectacle when it was first released, with gorgeous technicolor and plenty of creative visual effects.\n\nThis Island Earth deviates a lot from Raymond F. Jones’ novel, which was published just two years earlier. The movie cuts some of the complicated political intrigue and a few supporting characters, and it inserts a romantic subplot, as many Hollywood adaptations do. Decades later, it’s the movie which has survived, not the novel. This has a lot do with the splashy visual grandeur of the production.\n\n7 The Incredible Shrinking Man (1957)\n\nBased on The Shrinking Man by Richard Matheson\n\nThe Incredible Shrinking Man follows a man afflicted with a strange disease that causes him to gradually shrink. By the time he is the size of a child, he becomes caught in a media storm, but he is soon forgotten about as he shrinks smaller and smaller. By the end, he is abandoned in the basement of his home as he starts to be dwarfed by mice and insects eyeing him up like a potential meal.\n\nThe Incredible Shrinking Man\n\nhas a clever approach to its visual effects, but it’s also a powerful allegory for terminal disease.\n\nThe Incredible Shrinking Man has a clever approach to its visual effects, but it’s also a powerful allegory for terminal disease. The story is about how Scott deals with his circumstances, but it’s also concerned with how other people treat him as he and his needs change. Unlike most sci-fi movies of the era, The Incredible Shrinking Man never provides any explanation for its central mystery. Scott only assumes that his shrinking is linked to a mysterious cloud that surrounds him, but the cloud’s origins remain unknown.\n\n6 Invasion Of The Body Snatchers (1956)\n\nBased on The Body Snatchers by Jack Finney\n\nInvasion of the Body Snatchers has endured for far longer than most other 1950s sci-fi movies, and it has influenced countless alien invasion movies. Jack Finney’s novel was adapted a second time in 1978. Both adaptations are worth watching, but it’s hard to beat the intense, eerie atmosphere of the 1956 original. The story features an insidious alien plot to slowly replace people with bland automatons.\n\nInvasion of the Body Snatchers\n\nhas endured for far longer than most other 1950s sci-fi movies, and it has influenced countless alien invasion movies.\n\nEach version of Invasion of the Body Snatchers puts its own spin on Finney’s novel. The 1956 iteration was released just two years after the book was published, so it exists within the same social context. Invasion of the Body Snatchers reflects the American Red Scare of the 1950s. The story hints at the creeping paranoia and malice bubbling beneath the surface of white-picket-fence middle America.\n\n5 When Worlds Collide (1951)\n\nBased on When Worlds Collide by Edwin Balmer and Philip Wylie\n\nWhen Worlds Collide is a space-age Noah’s Ark tale, but the spaceships and sci-fi costumes do very little to pull focus from the biblical overtones. The movie opens with a quote from Genesis about how God decided to wipe out humanity, and the plot focuses on the mad scramble as people try to protect themselves from oblivion. The chaos shows precisely why civilization has been doomed to perish, either by divine intervention or random cosmic indifference.\n\nWhen Worlds Collide\n\nis all fire and brimstone, but it has plenty to offer beyond its religious themes.\n\nWhen Worlds Collide is all fire and brimstone, but it has plenty to offer beyond its religious themes. Prophetic visions of an apocalyptic future are especially prevalent in sci-fi movies during times of great social upheaval, so the 1950s produced many similar stories. When Worlds Collide has plenty of miniatures and painted backdrops which look quaint by today’s standards, but it’s an ambitious cautionary tale about the perils of nuclear armament.\n\n4 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea (1954)\n\nBased on Twenty Thousand Leagues Under The Seas by Jules Verne\n\nThere were many sci-fi movies in the 1950s which adapted contemporary novels, but 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea is based on a Jules Verne novel from 1870. The Disney adventure movie assembles a stellar cast headed by Kirk Douglas and James Mason, finally bringing Verne’s popular novel to the big screen with all the splendor and richness that it deserves. Previous adaptations simply didn’t have the scope or the technology to do so.\n\n20,000 Leagues Under the Sea\n\nwas revered for its visual effects, and its design helped to birth the steampunk aesthetic.\n\nIn an era when sci-fi movies were looking up to the stars, 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea acted as a reminder that there were still undiscovered creatures hidden on Earth. There is just as much horror and adventure in the oceans explored by Captain Nemo and his crew as there is on the fictional planets of other movies. 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea was revered for its visual effects, and its design helped to birth the steampunk aesthetic.\n\n3 Journey To The Center Of The Earth (1959)\n\nBased on Journey to the Center of the Earth by Jules Verne\n\n20,000 Leagues Under the Sea wasn’t the only popular Jules Verne novel to receive a big-budget movie adaptation in the 1950s. Five years after the box office success of 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, 20th Century Fox released Journey to the Center of the Earth, another dazzling adventure that proved to be a hit with fans. Journey to the Center of the Earth follows a race between two competing teams to find the secrets hidden in the planet’s core.\n\nUnlike the Cold War,\n\nJourney to the Center of the Earth\n\nfeatures dinosaurs, the city of Atlantis and a cannibal.\n\nThe exploration in Journey to the Center of the Earth is reminiscent of Scott and Amundsen’s scramble to plant a flag at the South Pole, but in the 1950s the story took on a new meaning. The competing teams, one American and one European, represented the two interested parties in the space race. Unlike the Cold War, Journey to the Center of the Earth features dinosaurs, the city of Atlantis and a cannibal.\n\n2 On The Beach (1959)\n\nBased on On the Beach by Nevil Shute\n\nOn the Beach is set in the 1960s, after the fallout from World War III has wiped out all life in the Northern Hemisphere. People in Melbourne, Australia wait for the clouds of radiation to eventually drift south and kill them, and they handle the news of their impending doom differently. Some engage in acts of drunken debauchery, while others sit in shock, refusing to believe that their loved ones in the U.S. are dead. Perhaps most disturbing of all are the racing drivers in the Australian grand prix who give their all to either win the race or die trying.\n\nOn the Beach\n\nset the tone for many other post-apocalyptic sci-fi movies.\n\nOn the Beach makes plenty of changes to Nevil Shute’s 1957 novel. The most significant is that the book details the story of the war, while little is known about what really happened in the movie. This is even more powerful, as there is nobody to blame for humanity’s demise, and the reasons behind the conflict fade into insignificance. On the Beach set the tone for many other post-apocalyptic sci-fi movies.\n\n1 The Curse Of Frankenstein (1957)\n\nBased on Frankenstein; or, the Modern Prometheus by Mary Shelley\n\nMary Shelley first wrote Frankenstein in 1812, when the advent of electricity and the industrial revolution were changing the world irreversibly. The horror story plays on humanity’s anxieties about rapidly advancing technologies, and whether they can be placed into human hands, and this theme has ensured the story has remained just as popular centuries later. Guillermo del Toro is making his own Frankenstein adaptation, proving that the characters and the story are still relevant.\n\nThe Curse of Frankenstein\n\ntakes some liberties with Shelley’s story, but the building blocks are unmistakable."
