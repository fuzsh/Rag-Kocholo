For all intents and purposes, BAMF=Badass Men’s Fashion until a more thoughtful retcon can emerge.\n\nAs an Amazon Associate, Kutoku affiliate, Parternize affiliate, and ShopStyle Collective affiliate, I may receive commissions from qualifying purchases made through links in these posts.\n\nCheck out my Amazon Storefront for quick links to products inspired by movies and TV."
