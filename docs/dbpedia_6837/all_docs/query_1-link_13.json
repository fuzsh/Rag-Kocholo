        "text": "MEDIA AS A MIRROR:\n\nOverview:\n\nMirror Theory (or Media as a Mirror Theory) focuses on the way media, especially mass media like film, reflects the society and culture which created it. Its premise is that a film cannot escape the time and place of its creation -- regardless of the time and place of its diegetic setting. Specifically, there are four things which will, theoretically, always find themselves represented or reflected in the films that a given time period and culture produce. Besides being reflected in the film, those four things create and support the film's Institutional Mode of Representation (IMR) -- the core mode or method films use to communicate meaning. Because they support that institutional mode like pillars support a roof, they are often referred to as the \"four pillars:\"\n\nTechnology -- the available technology at the time the film was produced (including the technology involved in film production, the general level of technology in society, and the contemporary views of technology).\n\nEconomics -- the value of money and goods as well as the general economic conditions of the society that created the film.\n\nSociology -- the contemporary social attitudes, religious beliefs, political climate, ethics, and morals of the period and culture.\n\nAesthetics -- the artistic tastes of the people in that time and place including what they consider beautiful, distasteful, appropriate, shocking, etc.\n\nBy examining how these pillars create the film's mode and represent themselves in the film, this theory attempts to explain the relationship among the film, its creators, and its audiences (both synchronically in its own time and diachronically across time).\n\nMethod:"
