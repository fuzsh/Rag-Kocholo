        "text": "When soldiers began returning home from abroad after World War 2, they and their new families settled in newly constructed suburbs across the country and left the downtown urban areas where movie theaters were. This, combined with newly acquired television sets for their suburban living rooms, left a vacuum in movie theater attendance. To make up for lost revenue and ticket sales, motion picture companies at the time began trying new things to attract audiences back into theaters including widescreen formats. These widescreen technologies included Cinerama, Cinemascope, Panavision, and Polyvision. Cinerama and Polyvision were not really new technologies but rather adaptations and expansions of existing technology. Cinemascope and Panavision both created new technology in the form of anamorphic lens attachments that compressed the image onto the film frame and then when projected, would be shown through another lens attachment that stretched the image to what it would look like naturally (Figure 1). These technologies doubled what the camera could capture and what the viewer saw. After getting comfortable with the contemporary 4:3 ratio, directors had to tackle new problems and changes that arose with this new technology. Once the problem of its price was overcome, the blocking, cinematography, and editing all needed to be adjusted to accommodate the change in scenery.\n\nAs David Bordwell describes in his chapter on Cinemascope, “The Modern Miracle You See Without Glasses,” directors had grown accustomed to blocking in the 4:3 aspect ratio, with characters being placed in different areas of the frame: fore-, middle-, and background in early cinema. Later on, in the years before widescreen, characters were placed at diagonals for more expressive visuals with editing, découpage, and fluid camera movements helping to break up the monotony of a static wide shot. When widescreen came in, almost all of that had to be reimagined. The technology in the 1950s only allowed for limited lenses and focusing, which had to be separate from focusing the anamorphic attachments. Bordwell writes, “Early anamorphic lenses offered very limited depth of field… and they were at their sharpest when filming from far back. Directors were recommended to put the camera no closer than 7 feet from the subject.”\n\nCinemascope in particular had parallax issues where the cameraman would see something slightly different than what the camera actually captured and so the camera operator was not able to truck the camera in or back because they would lose the synchronicity of seeing what the camera actually filmed. There was now very little mobility of the camera when filming. With a lack of camera movement, the blocking and actors’ movements had to get more creative to provide animated scenes and express internal feelings externally. And, because the camera now showed all of this action in a wideshot, and with the technological limitations of the anamorphic lenses, directors felt the coverage was enough in its widescreen format and hardly changed angles. This led to generally much longer takes and scene monotony, but less editing was needed.\n\nThese problems, and their creative workarounds, are evident in two of the earliest widescreen films: Carmen Jones (Otto Preminger, 1954) and Forbidden Planet (Fred M. Wilcox, 1956). One of the litanies of problems that would have been encountered, and would be most notable to the audience, was the blocking of characters in the frame. With widescreen, more characters could be placed horizontally across the screen but with technological constraints, couldn’t be placed in very different depths of field. This led to directors lining up the actors like “clothes on a line” for many scenes and conversations, even if it would be unnatural to behave like that in real life. In Carmen Jones, this was evident in the club scene (Figure 2) and in Forbidden Planet on the spaceship (Figure 3). This technique allowed for full coverage of a conversation, showing all the characters involved, without losing them in the background or having to change camera setups for coverage. This led to longer takes and that, in turn, led to another problem of visual monotony and lack of visual expression.\n\nTo combat this, more dynamic blocking was implemented within the “clothesline” constraint. Slight movements of characters within the depth of field allowed for more expression of the story or to externalize a character’s internal identity and/or conflict. In Carmen Jones, this is most evident again at the club scene where Carmen is deciding whether or not to leave for Chicago at the behest of her friends (Figures 4–7). She first stands apart from them, symbolizing that her desires are not like her friends; she wants to stay in the area to be with her love, Joe. As the shot progresses, Carmen moves forward and backward in space as her friends beg her to come, signifying that she may be considering actually going with them. Continuing in the shot (Figure 7), she is now fully with them in space and mostly in agreement about going with them to Chicago, with some reservations.\n\nLikewise, in Forbidden Planet, dynamic horizontal blocking helped break up the monotony of shots and expand upon the visual expressiveness of the film. This happens in the scene where Commander Adams and Lieutenant “Doc” Ostrow confront Dr. Morbius on the recent attack on their spaceship’s systems and they suspect he is behind it (Figures 8–10). At first, there is an equally combative nature between them in their tone and dialogue, with Morbius loudly getting upset at their intrusion into his office and Adams outright accusing Morbius of the attack (Figure 8). As the audience has been with Commander Adams and his crew this whole film, and neither the audience nor Commander Adams do not fully know who Dr. Morbius is or what he does, there is an emphasis placed on Adams as having the upper hand in truth, which is expressed in his more dominant position in the frame (Figure 9).\n\nIf this were real life, Adams would have moved from his spot behind the desk to a position most likely next to his Lieutenant. However, that framing does not express the characters’ internal positions nor the audience’s perception of who is in control, nor would it be good composition on such a wide frame to have two opposing forces both on only one side of the frame. As the shot progresses, Morbius realizes that it’s now time for him to divulge what he knows and to best explain what he thinks is going on (Figure 10). The dynamic changes as Morbius is placed in a position of power, with Adams and Ostrow both looking up to him, who is now centered in the frame, as he shares his knowledge and theory about the previous inhabitants on this planet.\n\nAnother problem was how to frame, or even film, close-ups and medium shots. The technological limitations made it so that the camera couldn’t get within seven feet of an actor. If a close up was filmed, the actor would get “Scope Mumps,” a screen condition that made their face appear bloated thanks to the anamorphic lens. The lens also distorted the edge of the frame, causing straight lines to curve and bend in unnatural ways. To get around this, directors either filmed medium shots, from a safe distance, instead of closeups, usually with a large depth of field and where the character was slightly off-center (Figures 11 and 12). Or they tried to film closeups in over the shoulder shots where the character of focus was on the thirds line and the character they’re talking to is on the other thirds line (Figures 13 and 14). These techniques, in the single character shots, successfully satisfied the need for an intimate shot with a character while providing look space in the frame to signify action happening off screen. In the over the shoulder shots, they provided balance and visual expressiveness for a moment. In Figure 13, Joe is angry and dominant in attitude and that is expressed through his domineering position in the frame. In Figure 14, Adams and Altaira are placed in a more comfortable conversational position, yet it still represents an intimate shared moment between them, which is reflective of their conversation and personalities in the scene.\n\nAnother aspect of composition that was affected was how the set and set design interacted with the characters. Like the characters, the sets could be expanded horizontally, and with filming from more than seven feet away from the characters in mostly wide shots, the new widescreen could show more of the room, set, or characters in the frame. Notably for Forbidden Planet, and other science fiction films like it, futuristic set design was reimagined to fill in and complement the story, characters, and new widescreen frame (Figures 15–17). Lines, shapes, furniture, walls, windows, all could be made anew in a futuristic design that filled the frame and aided visual expression. In an essay on the film simply titled, “Forbidden Planet,” Ian Olney writes, “Cedric Gibbons’s imaginative art direction makes the most of the film’s novel setting… conjuring an utterly alien landscape with a combination of finely detailed sets, evocative matte paintings, and inventive props.”\n\nWhen we first meet Altaira, she stands dead center, full body, in the frame with clashing shapes and lines all around her, like the angular walls, vertically straight windows, spiked fountain artwork, and circular fountain base and floor pattern (Figure 15). On the surface, it allowed the frame to be filled with interesting and non-repetitive patterns. For the story, the clashing shapes complemented the conflicting emotions that the all-male crew who meet her feel: a sense of protection, sexual desire, and curiosity. For the Krell technology, the design was reminiscent of the monumentalism found in the German expressionist film Metropolis, which also featured new technology and a huge city (Figure 16). The art fills the frame and its unexpected massiveness, compared to the little characters, makes the audience feel the same way about the marvel that the main characters probably do. On a smaller, simpler scale, when Adams confronts Dr. Morbius about how he thinks it’s actually Dr. Morbius’ subconscious that fuels the monster, the house’s set design again complements the story and the expressive potential (Figure 17). Specifically, the angled green wall piece symbolizes the characters’ contrasting beliefs that are on a collision course to the truth.\n\nFor Carmen Jones, it seemed more like Preminger was trying to make the universe expansive and full. When Joe and Carmen are dancing together at the club, Joe tells her that he needs to travel 400 miles away to attend his pilot training (Figure 18). An intimate moment that’s about the fate of their relationship, one would expect a closer shot but, since that can’t be done in Cinemascope, at least a shot of just them. In this shot, however, two background non-speaking characters join them in the frame. During the progression of this shot, it’s shown that the club is almost packed with people dancing and Preminger most likely wanted to continue to remind the audience that the club is full of people, and so allowed these two characters to be in the frame; it grounds Carmen and Joe to the club and does not allow them to be separated from their environment. However, because it is an important moment for the two of them, the two background characters seem intrusive and their position in the frame, compared to the stars, feels unbalanced and awkward.\n\nSimilarly, when Carmen asks Frankie for some money, they occupy the left half of the frame with a pair of closed doors and a boxer exercising occupying the right (Figure 19). Preminger might have wanted the audience to associate Carmen with the closed doors, as Frankie even says, “…with all the doors wide open,” to her when referring to Husky. But the placement of the boxer, who’s noticeable exercise movements so close to the foreground and which contrasts with the main characters and their relative stillness, draws our attention away from that possible door-Carmen association and again makes the frame feel unbalanced. Here, Preminger’s attempts to fill the frame using a different aspect ratio’s techniques are on the right path but are still primitive in the new widescreen format.\n\nAs widescreen continued to develop, these problems associated with composition would be solved with continued creative workarounds, and advances and changes in technology helped that process. But the beginning of widescreen, with Cinemascope and other technology like it, was a new process that upended the motion picture art form in terms of composition. An increased frame thanks to new anamorphic lenses led to filming constraints with focus and lighting; a larger frame created new visual imbalances that directors tried to utilize through symmetry, dynamic blocking, and set and/or environmental changes to compensate and enhance the visual expressiveness of the film. Some of these adaptive techniques fell flat, like Preminger’s attempt to fill some shots in Carmen Jones. But many techniques succeeded like Preminger’s dynamic and expressive blocking as well as Wilcox’s blocking in Fantastic Planet and his use of the environment and set design."
