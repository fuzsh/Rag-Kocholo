        "text": "Florida was smack dab in the middle of a competition to be the world’s leader in space exploration. The year was 1959 and the best astronauts our nation had to offer launched to our state to be considered for the first man-in-space United States Mercury program. Those who had the right stuff made it, and became legends along the way. “The Right Stuff’” a new original scripted series based on Tom Wolfe’s bestseller, blasts off on the streaming service Disney+ Oct. 9 with a two-episode premiere.\n\nJohn Glenn, played by Patrick J. Adams and Alan Shepard (Jake McDorman) are at the center of the story that takes place in the height of the Cold War where the Soviet Union dominated the space race. The series, based on real life events, follows the lives and families of astronauts who ended up making the final members of the Mercury 7, as well as NASA’s engineers who raced to succeed with pressures from Washington and a public well informed through NASA’s PR and writers at LIFE magazine.\n\nMuch of the footage was actually shot here in our state, even without a lot of financial filming incentives, which have evaporated for bigger projects here. Still the team decided to anyway. “I was very vocal, some say obnoxious, about filming in Florida,” says Jennifer Davisson, executive producer of the series. “I believe we were making a show about a very specific moment and place that you can’t recre- ate elsewhere, including Florida skies.” She, along with other executive producers Leonardo DiCaprio, Phillip Watson and Scott Z. Burns, decided to shoot in several locations here. “I feel like there were a lot of things about the story that were specifically Floridian, and you would be able to tell. Like the boom of Cocoa Beach in the late ’50s — we got that.” Scenes were filmed in Tampa, Orlando, on the launchpad and the actual blockhouse, places Ms. Davisson said would be hard to recreate. “We feature Florida very well,” she concluded.\n\nThis includes featuring some of our state’s top talent. Actors hand picked here include Rachel Burttram, who plays the role of Betty Grissom, wife of astronaut Gus Grissom. Burttram, well known in Southwest Florida, with accolades for performances spanning 20 years in theater, television and film, took on the role with passion. “This was truly a highlight of my career thus far,” she admitted, which is saying a lot. “Betty specifically is so down to Earth and is a tell-it-like-it-is kind of gal. I just love playing her. She is so complex and so interesting, a very special woman. She went through so much. I am so proud and grateful to share her voice in this series.”\n\nChoosing to ‘feature Florida very well’ in Florida also helps support the industry here. “There is a massive economic impact when a television series and/or feature film sets up in a location,” said John Lux, executive director of Film Florida, a statewide not-for-profit entertainment production trade association that provides a leadership role in Florida’s film, television, production industry. ‘“The Right Stuff” filmed in four different counties in Florida (Hillsborough, Seminole, Orange and Brevard) and didn’t disappoint when it came to hiring local industry professionals, supporting the local economy and showcasing the area for enhanced tourism interest. We were thrilled and honored to have ‘The Right Stuff’ film in Florida.”\n\nThe series’ first episodes offer sophisticated visuals, delivering everything that era offered in detail, including set design, wardrobe, automobiles as well as a soundtrack of some of the best songs for that time.\n\n“Honestly, I said more than once while we were on set, that I felt like we were time traveling,” Ms. Burttram observed. “With the story set in the late ’50s to early ’60s, all the attention to the details from the various departments was just spectacular. It was like eye candy every direction you looked — down to your shoes. What an incredible ride.”\n\nThe series, originally slated to air on National Geographic, got picked up for distribution with Disney+, one of the fastest rising streaming services to be introduced in recent years, which seems to be a win, win for all involved. “When the idea came up to be on Disney+ it wasn’t even a question … it was a dream come true,” Ms. Davisson said.\n\n“As our audiences around the world turn to Disney+ to find inspiration and optimism, we believe the true-life heroism of the Mercury 7 will showcase the tenacity of the human spirit and inspire a new generation to reach for the stars,” said Ricky Strauss, president, content & marketing at Disney+. “The wonderful team of storytellers at National Geographic, Warner Horizon Scripted Television and Appian Way have crafted a compelling and entertaining tale and we are honored to give it a global home as the first scripted Disney+ original series from National Geographic.”\n\nMs. Davisson is already looking forward to a second season giving some insight as to the direction. “We have a lot we are talking about in season 2,” she said. “We’re talking about the 1960s, a time when the country was at unrest. These guys were in the middle of it dealing with it. We are going to bring in new characters that help expand on that.”\n\nFilm Florida is certainly ready for the next season to return. “As an organization and an industry, our goal is to bring ‘The Right Stuff’ back for Season 2, and hopefully attract more television series and feature films to Florida,” said Gail Morgan, president of Film Florida.\n\nAnd while viewers and numbers will help probably decide as to how much more we get to see, it seems like interest across the board is high. Floridians will join viewers across the world in taking a trip to a time past when the world was a different place, with a lot to be learned from the story.\n\n“The Right Stuff” is an aspirational story about ambition and exploration and how ordinary human beings can achieve the extraordinary, which is one of the main reasons Ms. Davisson said it was important for right now. “We love to tell true stories, historical things. We really love to tell the story of great men who have sacrificed a lot for that greatness. It is what we are drawn to. We had seven (in this series.)” As far as why it is so important to tell these stories now, she says, “I think it was a time in America when we did great things — across party lines. We as a country rallied and made it happen. We as a culture need that right now, hearing stories how great and wonderful America is.”\n\nHere are a few other new shows you might want to catch fresh to screens now:\n\n¦ “The Social Dilemma”\n\nOriginally screening at Sundance earlier this year, “The Social Dilemma,” directed and written by Jeff Orlowski (“Chasing Coral”), takes a hard — and sober — look at social media platforms and how we interact with them. Sure, we spend hours on our devices and most will admit it. But is it healthy for us? Is it healthy for our children? With intimate discussions with many pioneers from the industry who spent their careers building and monetizing some of the biggest tech giants, the message becomes clear. No. No it is not healthy. It can become like a drug addiction to many. The way in which many services exploits its users for financial gain through data mining and surveillance, nurturing users to become addicted often leaving them with mental health problems and believing conspiracy theories begs the question — what next? 93m; PG-13; streaming on Netflix now.\n\n¦ “Kajillionaire”\n\nImagine teaching your daughter to become a con artist. Parents Theresa (Debra Winger) and Robert (Richard Jenkins) have done just this with their daughter Old Dolio (played by Evan Rachel Wood). “Kajillionaire” is a quirky Miranda July comedy that is weird and wild. The film premiered at Sundance earlier this year. Things get hinkey when one of their family heists goes awry, turning all their worlds upside down. In theaters now. 1h 46m; R.\n\n¦ “The Great American Lie”\n\nDirector Jennifer Siebel Newsom (“Miss Representation” and “The Mask You Live In”) and producer Amanda Mortimer call into question the greatness of the America dream with regard to its wealth inequity, education, prison and health care systems to name just a few, looking into finding ways that these can be fixed. The film, which premiered at the San Francisco Film Festival last year as well as films around the nation, is available to screen now. 1h 39m.\n\n¦ “Aggie”\n\nIn this documentary that premiered at Sundance earlier this year, the story of art collector Agnes Gund’s sale of a Roy Lichtenstein’s piece in 2017 for $165 million in order to start a movement to end mass incarceration is a great look at the power of art, the importance of justice and what the strength and determination of one philanthropist can do for the world. 1h 32m available to stream on various networks.\n\n¦ “The War with Grandpa”\n\nThe grandpa in this movie is played by Robert De Niro (Ed) and the war has nothing to do with any ties to the mob. Rather, it is a family feud with his grandson, Peter, played by Oakes Fegley, that includes mostly harmless pranks played on each other after Peter has to give up his room to him. With a star-studded cast, including Uma Thurman, Christopher Walken, Jane Seymour, Rob Riggle, Cheech Marin and Laura Marano, there is a good chance this family comedy out in theaters will give you a giggle or two. 1h 34m; PG\n\n¦ “Harry Chapin: When in Doubt, Do Something”\n\nFor those who don’t know much about Harry Chapin, an activist, musician and humanitarian who dedicated himself to helping others, this doc will shed some light. Known as an award-winning songwriter for hits ‘Cats in the Cradle’ and ‘Taxi,’ his life’s journey from rise to fame and tragic death is told through archived footage and interviews with fans including Billy Joel, Kenny Rogers, Pat Benatar, Bruce Springsteen and more. He persisted in helping the less fortunate, uniting a world and giving a voice to those without one. 1h 33m.\n\nDown the road: Coming soon, be sure to get excited for “Wonder Woman 1984,” “Black Widow” and “No Time To Die.” ¦"
