        "text": "A theme is an idea, concept, or lesson that conveys a moral message in a text and explores it through characters, setting, dialogue, plot, or elements. Themes come in two different categories. They are:\n\nThematic concept deals with how the readers perceive the concept in your text.\n\nThematic statement deals with what your work says about the subject.\n\nHence, you need to invest your time in identifying the story’s theme as it is not stated explicitly. In a way, a piece of writing with a hidden, thought-provoking theme is a treasure that provokes us to think rather than telling us what to think. To identify the theme of a story, we need first to understand how writers convey the theme through their work. This article gives you an example to spot a theme and lists themes to explore with some relevant examples.\n\nUnderstanding Theme\n\nHow Do You Convey the Theme of a Story?\n\nWriters often use specific devices to convey their themes that interact differently to make up the story. Let us uncover these devices in detail:\n\nTopic\n\nA topic introduces your story to your readers and audiences. Mostly, the title gives a cue to what happens in the story; it may be descriptive or definitive. At the same time, a theme is interpretive, as different readers have their interpretations. Hence, a theme gives the reader the flexibility to explore a specific topic.\n\nTitle Design and Themes\n\nMotif\n\nA motif uses an image, sound, word, or symbol repetitively to convey the story’s central idea. For example, The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald emphasizes the theme of judgment through the repetitive narration by Nick Carraway.\n\nWhat is a motif? Motif examples from well-known films.\n\nMoral\n\nA moral often results in a takeaway message that the readers and audiences interpret from the theme. For example, Hemingway’s “A Clean, Well-Lighted Place” deals with the theme of loneliness. Although it doesn’t have a clear-cut moral to the story, one can infer the need to be sympathetic toward the lonely.\n\nMorals and Themes in Movies\n\nWhy is the Theme Important?\n\nThemes focus on the story and hence impart meaning to the text. It also connects the reader to the characters and their struggles, contributing to a compelling read. Also, it helps the writer to focus her ideas and understandably present them. The theme of a story influences:\n\nA character’s decision\n\nThe mood of the story\n\nMoral of the story\n\nWe need to learn to identify these themes to enjoy their essence and get influenced by them. Here we go!\n\nJurassic Park — Using Theme to Craft Character\n\nHow Do You Determine the Theme of a Movie?\n\nHere is an example of extracting the theme from the movie Animal Farm.

Let us now disclose how the theme is distributed across different story elements.\n\nThe key characters of this movie represent the leading figures of the Russian Revolution.\n\nThe central plot showcases the power struggle among the livestock on the farm.\n\nSome plot points reveal how corrupt leadership holds onto power.\n\nLiterary devices like allegory mimic real-life incidents, and symbolism represents real-life personas.\n\nHow to Find a Theme?\n\nCommon Themes\n\nAs themes are present universally across all stories, here is a list of popular themes in literature for you to explore:\n\n1.
