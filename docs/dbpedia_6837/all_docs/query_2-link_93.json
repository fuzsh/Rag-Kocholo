        "text": "Destination Moon\n\n1950 Eagle Lion\n\nOK space drama\n\ncolor\n\nproduced George Pal directed Irving Pichel screenplay Rip van Ronkel,\n\nRobert Heinlein,\n\nJames O’Hanlon based on Robert Heinlein’s novel space art Chesley Bonestell\n\nJohn Archeras Jim Barnes Warner Andersonas Dr. Charles Cargraves Tom Powersas General Thayer Dick Wessonas Joe Sweeny Erin O’Brien-Mooreas Emily Cargraves\n\nThis was the first full-length space film out of Hollywood since 1930. It at least attempts some degree of technical realism, with the advice of the famous science fiction writer, Heinlein. (Well… better than nothing.)\n\nVehicle: Silver, cigar-shaped rocket with big fins. Not really very big. Nuclear rocket engine: steam super-heated by nuclear reactor.\n\nTechnology: Clips of White Sands V-2, discussion of satellites\n\nThe film employs a clackety computer similar to that in Attack of the Flying Saucers.\n\nOnly boys on this mission — Heinlein never wrote well for women.\n\nIt has a beautiful pitch for going into space by Woody Woodpecker! With a lesson in Newtonian mechanics!\n\nWhy go to the Moon? “There is no way to stop an attack from outer space”\n\nThe film dismisses public opposition to the nuclear motor as propaganda financed by “somebody with money and brains”.\n\n“Rockets are an absolute necessity — if any other power gets one into space before we do, we’ll no longer be the United States, we’ll be ‘This United World, etc., etc.’ unquote.”\n\nUpon landing on the Moon, they “claim possession for the United States, for the benefit of all mankind.”\n\nThe film depicts the effects of acceleration as excruciating.\n\nA very nice artist’s rendering of Earth appears; the astronauts soliloquize on its beauty.\n\nThe film depicts weightlessness well, with invisible wires. The astronauts report that weightlessness makes swallowing difficult. They walk with what are, apparently, real magnetized boots!\n\nAn oxygen tank serves to thrust an astronaut to make a rescue.\n\nRocketship X-M\n\n(a.k.a. “Rocketship Expedition Moon”)\n\n1950 Lippert Productions\n\nOK (but silly) space drama\n\nB&W, some scenes tinted pink\n\nproduced, wrote, directed Kurt Neumann exec. producer Robert L. Lippert screenplay Orville H. Hampton\n\nKurt Neumann\n\nDalton Trumbo matte painter I.A. Block special effects Jack Rabin musical score Ferde Grofé\n\nLloyd Bridges as Col. Floyd Graham Osa Massen as Dr. Chem. Lisa Van Horn John Emery as Dr. Karl Extrum Noah Beery, Jr.as Maj. William Corrigan, Engr. Hugh O’Brian as Harry Chamberlain Morris Ankrum as Dr. Fleming Patrick Ahern reporter #1 Sherry Moreland Martian girl John Dutra physician Katherine Marlowe reporter\n\nVehicle RXM (Rocketship Expedition to the Moon). Two-stage, shaped like a squid’s mantle. Carries “Twice the fuel we expect to use, to keep within the margin of safety.”\n\nNot strictly a military project, but built in secrecy. That “…an unassailable base could be established on the Moon, to control world peace.”\n\nAccording to a trailer provided with the tape, the crew consists of “Four Men and a Girl”.\n\nThey guys comment on her as they’re taking their physicals: “The weaker sex, the only one whose blood pressure is normal!” “Unless you look like a test tube or a chemical formula, you don’t have a chance”. She’s on board because she invented the fuel the rocket uses.\n\nThey get a case of “meteorites”.\n\nAt some point between the Earth and Moon, they have an encounter with reduced gravity. It’s briefly amusing, but they aren’t bothered by it again.\n\nWhile in space, they gaze upon a gauge that reads “Air Speed - MPH”.\n\nSomething goes wrong: “By heading into space, we’ve added the Earth’s orbital velocity to our own”. They’re doing a course change, and everyone blacks out (for days). (Perhaps they should have made another correction.)\n\n“You know the consequences of a body moving with unchecked velocity in free space… Infinite motion!”\n\nThe ship ends up going to Mars instead of the Moon. They acknowledge that this is wildly improbable, and “pause and observe respectfully while something infinitely greater assumes control”.\n\nOn Mars: “We have atmosphere here, we won’t need pressure suits”\n\nMartians are just people. They have nuked themselves back to the stone age. The whole Mars episode is disappointing.\n\nMost of the film is B&W, but Mars scenes are pink!\n\nThe musical score resembles the Star Trek theme.\n\nTexan Bill Corrigan prefers colorful expressions like “Mars — whaddya know!”. Remarks: “On my ranch, I’ve thrown heifers over my shoulder bigger than that”. Col. Graham retorts: “You sure that wasn’t a bull?”\n\nGraham has been chipping away at able co-worker and assistant Van Horn’s icy exterior all along, but after a couple of guys die, and they’re headed back to Earth, it’s time for romance. Graham: “Lisa, you’re a pretty swell girl.” Van Horn: “Girl? I’m not Dr. Van Horn anymore?” He has hit on the right formula!\n\nBut too late. Brace yourself for a bummer.\n\nParables:\n\nGod is in the pilot seat (and He can’t be killed!)\n\nRaces naturally engage in combat on first encounter.\n\nMars is too boring to bother with.\n\nThe Man from Planet X\n\n1951 Mid Century Films\n\nOK straight-up low budget alien arrival\n\nB&W\n\ndirected Edgar G. Ulmer produced Jack Pollexfen\n\nAubrey Wisberg cinematography John L. Russell special effects Andy Anderson\n\nHoward Weeks\n\nRobert Clarke as John Lawrence Margaret Field as Enid Elliot Raymond Bond as Prof. Elliot William Schallert as Dr. Mears Roy Engel as Constable Tommy David Ormont as Inspector Porter Gilbert Fallman as Dr. Robert Blane June Jeffrey wife of a missing man\n\nPremise: a new planet shows up, like that’s like ho-hum. The world experiences “strange astronomical phenomena”. Then something appears on a Scottish island, with a space man in it.\n\nAlien: the man from planet X. Always appears in a space suit with a clear bubble helmet. Has “a horrible, grotesque imitation of a face”. The worst part of this film is the face of the alien, which looks like a papier-mâché Mardi Gras mask, like a first attempt.\n\nThe alien tries to communicate by making musical sounds. Good question: “How to communicate with the X guy?”\n\nAs to why planet X is making a visit, it is later explained “…they managed to make the planet deviate from its natural orbit by scientific degravitation”.\n\nThe script never clarifies why the alien is such a threat — near as we can tell, he only gets mistreatment. The decision about how to handle him is stock ’50s sci-fi: because he is his people’s last hope, who will invade Earth to save themselves, they blow him up — thus, according to what the script tells us of them, dooming his people to extinction.\n\nVehicles: a pretty cool looking little rocket thing, made of impossibly light metal. The alien lands in a sort of bell-shaped capsule. The windows on it are harder than diamond.\n\nGadgets: a ray coming from the capsule takes away Elliott’s will. The alien has a lot of trouble with his gas regulator, Lawrence helps him out, but then Mears uses it to coerce him — it plays into several scenes. The people use a heliograph to communicate with a ship at sea.\n\nWeapon: alien has a hand gun, which we never see him fire.\n\nThe acting in this film is better than the average B-movie of this period.\n\nThe character Enid is pretty strong — again, for the time and sort of film. She gets a sedative on account she saw something scary. (Margaret Morlan is the mother of Sally Field, and is at least as cute.) Both of the primary male characters sport facial hair. The actor most familiar to me is Schallert, who plays a power hungry bastard scientist here — unlike his usual roles. His acting isn’t bad, but his character’s behavior isn’t believable.\n\nThe script isn’t all bad, but it’s choppy, and was definitely cut short. As limited as the props are, they are at least — different. I’ve read that this film was completed in just a few days, and a very low budget — there were complaints about pay. They could have done better with a little more time and money.\n\n“Knowledge would only bring more fear in a world already filled with it.”\n\n“The basic and universal language: geometry.”\n\n“The only difference between water and space is a matter of density.”\n\nParables:\n\nWe don’t want no damned refugees on this planet!\n\nThe Thing from Another World\n\n1951 Winchester Studios\n\n− period piece military vs. space monster\n\nB&W\n\nproducer Howard Hawks assoc. producer Edward Lasker director Christian Nyby screenplay Charles Lederer based on John W. Campbell, Jr.’s story\n\nWho Goes There? music Dimitri Tiomkin special effectsDonald Steward\n\nMargaret Sheridanas Nikki Nicholson Kenneth Tobey as Capt. Patrick Hendry Robert Cornthwaite as Dr. Arthur Carrington Douglas Spenceras Ned Scott James Young as Lt. Eddie Dykes Dewey Martin as Crew Chief Bob Robert Nichols as Lt. Ken Erickson William Self as Cpl. Barnes Eduard Franz as Dr. Stern Sally Creighton as Mrs. Chapman James Arnass the “Thing”\n\nThey start in Anchorage. Something’s up at the North Pole.\n\nThe original story is about a shape-shifter. In this version, it’s a vegetable-man, that wants to eat bloooood!\n\nVehicles: They’re flying around in a C-47. (Nice paint pattern.) Alien flying saucer stuck in the ice: what we see is a lovely blue, streamlined tail fin.\n\nFirst idea is to use thermite to get the saucer out. They thereby blow it up, so we never see any more of it.\n\nThere’s radioactivity everywhere.\n\nThey find a frozen anthropoid figure, 8′ tall, whom they straightaway accidentally thaw out, and commence shooting at. They determine that it’s a vegetable: they call it a “carrot”.\n\nThe rest is all military bad-boy banter and how to destroy the creature. The dialog fairly gallops, some aspects of naturalness lacking in many films especially of this era — intriguing, if not good, direction. Somehow, the many principals don’t completely lose their individuality. But, while the banter is fun, it doesn’t really help the scary mood.\n\nIt’s scariest when we can’t see the creature. When we do see the creature, it’s little different from the old Frankenstein’s monster — just a big guy lumbering and growling menacingly. (Saying that he’s really a plant doesn’t help make him scarier. The monster is only scary because we’re told it is.)\n\nAs science fiction, well, science is part of the story, but it’s mostly that the creature will reproduce itself quickly, given enough blood. A standard mad scientist is just mad about science; makes one wonder why any normal person would be a scientist.\n\nThe book has seen three adaptations so far. This one and the one from 1982 are both good enough in their own right, and different enough, I’m going ahead and listing both. Another adaptation in 2010 doesn’t add much but CGI.\n\n“Watch sky… everywhere, keep looking, keep watching the sky!”\n\nFlight to Mars\n\n1951 Monogram Pictures\n\n− space flight drama\n\ncolor\n\nproduced Walter Mirisch directed Lesley Selander screenplay Arthur Strawn\n\nMarguerite Chapman as Alita Cameron Mitchell reporter Steve Abbott Arthur Franz as Jim Barker Virginia Huston as Carol Stafford John Litel as Dr. Laine Morris Ankrum as Ikron (Alita’s Father) Richard Gaines as Prof. William Jackson Lucille Barkley as Terris Robert H. Barratt as Tilmar\n\nDate “Fifty Years into the Future” (from trailers)\n\nVehicle: Sleek silver rocket-ship, boarded in the conventional manner — a little ladder to a door at the rear.\n\n“What happens when the rocket finally levels off, do we walk on the walls?”\n\n“Our gyro mechanism keeps this cabin vertical at all times!”\n\nThe inside of the rocket ship is identical to that of Rocketship X-M.\n\nPremise: The ship was built in secret by the Pentagon, but the (much-discussed) reason for the ship is just to get there.\n\nCrew: a frigid woman scientist, a know-nothing-but-whimsical newspaper reporter who has unexplained authority over the others, the handsome and lusty captain, and some old guys who worry about stuff.\n\nThey nearly get sucked into the Moon by its gravitational field, but by some last-second swerving, manage to avoid it. The obligatory encounter with “meteorites” (which appear to be micrographs of blood cells) causes a crash landing on Mars.\n\nAliens: Martians are just (white, North American) people with futuristic clothing. The thoughts of both species turn promptly to procreation with the other.\n\nThe Martians are running out of “corium”, which is their equivalent of coal.\n\nMartian girls can’t really bend over in their outfits. Futuristic! The length of their skirts was a taste of things to come in Star Trek.\n\nMars is a “woman’s paradise”, because instead of a kitchen, there is a “food laboratory”, which delivers meals, and washes the dishes.\n\nIf you’re looking for utterly idiotic dialog and miserable confusion not only of scientific facts, but of human behavior and the workings of government and what constitutes humor, go no further! There are more chaotic efforts and worse production, and even examples of worse acting. But for sheer dumb, this film explores every crevice!\n\nParables:\n\nWatch out for meteorites.\n\nMars is dying.\n\nMartian girls look good in mini-skirts.\n\nMartian women belong in the food laboratory.\n\nThe Man in the White Suit\n\n1951 Ealing Studios\n\n++ comic economics of science\n\nB&W\n\nproduced Michael Balcon directed Alexander Mackendrick based on Roger MacDougall’s play screenplay Roger MacDougall,\n\nJohn Dighton,\n\nAlexander Mackendrick dir. photo. Douglas Slocombe scientific advisor Geoffrey Myres music Benjamin Frankel\n\nPremise: Sydney is a genius, and he’s up to something unauthorized in the company lab.\n\nThe Question: If something too good to be true really comes into being, is it truly a good thing?\n\nEverything about this film is just lovely. Every actor shines — even the bit parts. The photography is brilliant, the sounds are perfect. The characters are rich, but all quite believable — including the outrageous ones.\n\nThe humor is absolutely on the mark. A quiet little joke pops out every few seconds.\n\nThe science part might be far-fetched, but the economics and social issues are very real.\n\nIt’s an exquisite story about society, and the limitations of science in improving it. It is also a brilliant piece of movie-making.\n\nThe Day the Earth Stood Still\n\n1951 Twentieth Century - Fox\n\n+ space alien arrival, scary robot\n\nB&W\n\nscreenplay Edmund H. North based on Harry Bates’ story\n\nFarewell to the Master director Robert Wise producer Julian Blaustein\n\nVehicle: Beautiful flying saucer\n\nRobot: The very cool and scary Gort\n\nDate: 1951 (shows on a cleaner’s tag on a suit Klaatu appropriates).\n\nKlaatu comes from a planet 250 million miles away. Well, that would have it within our solar system. (The term “light-year” had been in use for a hundred years already. Maybe the writers were just unaware of it.) He looks just like a human; his skeleton is “perfectly normal” — the doctors think this implies a “similar atmosphere”.\n\nThe reaction of the Earthlings is to circle the spaceship with heavy artillery, and to shoot Klaatu after he says he has come in peace. Then they try to imprison Klaatu in a hospital. Then they shoot him again! Government officials are indifferent to his message.\n\nRegarding the original short story: it ends with a twist that doesn’t appear in the movie.\n\nInternational: Get to hear Hindi, French spoken. There are blacks in crowds of Americans.\n\nAll the principals deliver good performances. The script is coherent and directed, despite its scientific and social weaknesses.\n\nCompare to Stranger from Venus, The Man Who Fell to Earth.\n\nA 2008 re-make with modern special effects doesn’t add much, except to update the reason for Klaatu’s visit and the scariness of Gort. (Also, John Cleese is in it.)\n\nParables:\n\nAliens are benevolent.\n\nWar is bad, and it’s going to get us into trouble\n\nWe tend to shoot first, then not bother to ask questions.\n\nScientists are good but ineffectual.\n\nFive\n\n1951 Arch Oboler Productions\n\n+ post-nuclear holocaust\n\nB&W\n\nproduced,\n\nwrote,\n\ndirected Arch Oboler photography Sid Lubow music Henry Russell sound William Jenkins Locy poem “The Creation”\n\nby James Weldon Johnson\n\nSusan Douglas as Roseanne William Phipps as Michael Charles Lampkin as Charles Earl Lee as Mr. Barnstaple James Anderson as Eric\n\nThis is the first, full-length film depiction of the world after a nuclear holocaust.\n\nThe science fiction here is that of a bomb that quickly kills almost everybody pretty much everywhere, so only a handful of live people find one another.\n\nWe don’t see much of what happened — a stock clip of a nuclear explosion, then just smoke blowing over churches and mosques all over the world; the Eiffel tower, Taj Mahal, Empire State building. They applied biblical stuff at either end, for scriptural legitimacy.\n\nIt’s primarily a play of personalities. Of course, it is not a happy story.\n\nMixed-race cast! The script treats racism directly.\n\nMostly, it’s just about a few damaged people: here we are, everything and everybody else is gone, now what?\n\nIt’s clean of special effects, mutant hobgoblins, hero heartthrobs.\n\nThe acting is great, as is the camera work.\n\nThe main interpersonal conflict resolves feebly, though.\n\nThe budget for the film was miniscule, with a crew of college graduates.\n\nThe fancy house on a hill is of course a Frank Lloyd Wright design.\n\nWhen Worlds Collide!\n\n1951 Paramount\n\nOK space mega disaster-n-salvation\n\ncolor\n\nproduced George Pal directed Rudolph Maté screenplay Sydney Boehm based on After Worlds Collide by Edwin Balmer and\n\nPhilip Wylie\n\nPremise: star Bellus will collide with Earth, while its planet Zyra will come just near enough for people to move there.\n\nComputer: a “differential analyzer”. It makes a lot of noise.\n\nVehicle: inter-planetary “Space Ark”, silver, winged, cigar-shaped rocket that conserves fuel by riding a rail that curves down a mountainside and up another.\n\nThe film begins with disaster newsreels and preachy stuff.\n\nThere are lots of titanic special effects, mostly done with small models on cellophane.\n\nNon-white people appear in the U.N., but not in the U.S.A. The rocket ship factory, in particular, is completely Anglo.\n\nA naïveté about the scale of things and engineering details is present throughout, but nothing worse than the scale of human population. Shortly into the film, the script reduces the population of the country to a few people working in the factory to build the ark, and perhaps for a chance to be saved. What became of everyone else?\n\nAt the last moment, rabble-rousers do what they must do. The mob fires on the spaceship, but to no avail: the bullets bounce off its hull. (It isn’t clear that all the workers knew that only a select few were going to escape.)\n\nThe intrepid pioneers take a pot-shot at planet Zyra: without knowing whether it is livable or not, they fling open the ship’s hatch! What a relief, to find that Zyra is a cultivated Grecian countryside, just waiting to be inhabited!\n\nThe love triangle is completely gratuitous, and out of place.\n\nParables:\n\nThe good will prevail.\n\nThe mob is mad and evil.\n\nThe universe is taking pot-shots at us.\n\nThe alpha male gets the girl.\n\nThe House in the Square\n\n(aka. I’ll Never Forget You)\n\n1951 Twentieth Century Fox\n\nOK time-travel romance\n\nB&W and color\n\nproduced Sol. C. Siegel directed Roy Baker screen play Ranald MacDougall based on play by John L. Balderston color consultant Joan Bridge dir. photo. Georges Perinal\n\nA travel-into-the-past story, or perhaps time-loop, with a romance twist.\n\nDate: present (1951), past (1784)\n\nPlace: In and near London.\n\nLots of atomic sciency stuff at an atomic research laboratory in England: the boys are irresponsible with radioactive samples. Nothing comes of this, near as I can tell. He blurts a big mess of relativity talk, to explain how he’s going to go back in time. It makes no lick of sense, and drones on a while. There’s a storm. (There’s always a storm.)\n\nOh, fun! In the 1950s present, it’s B&W; in 1784, it’s color! (Of course, this was very old hat, after The Wizard of Oz of 1938.)\n\nOne moment Standish insists on the immutability of time, and the next pursues a plan to change the past. He has his temporal cake, and eats it, too, but unfortunately, can’t keep it down.\n\nHe meets historical figures in an effort to change their minds, and instead, shortly divulges that he is from the future. He can’t help himself.\n\nIn the past, he has a lab, to show all the fancy inventions of the future. It serves to convince nobody but his partner in romance.\n\nIt’s love at first sight, on account of good looks, apparently. It ends unresolved, thus avoiding losing a point from me.\n\nCall it a period piece adaptation of A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur’s Court, the main plot difference being the dates involved. (The protagonist is an American living in London.) But in contrast to that story (and its previous adaptations), the time travel here isn’t a dream — it’s some natural phenomenon.\n\nThe acting and direction is typical of 1950s action-adventure films.\n\nI read that the film project was started in 1945, with bigger-name stars, but got shelved, and then revived.\n\n“You want to talk to Doctor Johnson, do you? You’ll have to interrupt him to do that!”\n\n3000 A.D.\n\naka. Captive Women\n\n1952 RKO Radio Pictures, Inc.\n\n− early post-nuclear-apocalypse\n\nB&W\n\nwrote, produced Aubrey Wisberg,\n\nJack Pollexfen directed Stuart Gilmore assoc. producer Albert Zugsmith dir. phot Paul Ivano music Charles Koff special effects Jack Rabin,\n\nIrving Block\n\nRobert Clarke as Robert Margaret Field as Ruth Gloria Saunders as Catherine Ron Randell as Riddon Stuart Randall as Gordon Paula Dorety 1st captive Robert Bice as Bram Chill Williams 2nd captive William Schallert as Carver Eric Colmar as Saron Douglas Evans as Jason Marshall Bradford mutant leader Tom Daly as Durk\n\nDate: The title screen reads\n\n1000 Years from Now (The Year 3000 A.D.)\n\nPlace: New York City\n\nNarration explains a view of world politics of the time. A painting of nuclear destruction of a city appears briefly.\n\nThis is one of the first of the post-nuclear-apocalypse sub-genre, dealing with what happens to civilization long after the conflict. Its predecessor, Five, dealt with short-term consequences.\n\nIs it sci-fi? In that engineers used science to produce the weapons in the war, it’s a sort of engineering sci-fi. This one explores the idea that radiation might permanently mutate whole groups of people.\n\nGroups: “Upriver men”, march, bent on further destruction, “Mutates” with radiation disfigurements, cower in the ruins, “Norms” live in subways, and are pretty people — but not nice.\n\nThere’s a wedding among the Norms, and the Upriver Men want to visit. The Norms are remarkably ill-prepared for the treachery and infidelity that are afoot.\n\nThe Mutates are Christians, and have forbidden themselves to marry one another, for fear of producing more mutations. Their men capture Norm women for reproduction — hence, the title.\n\nThe dialog is very artificial and stylized, resembling that of contemporary Robin Hood movies. Direction is very poor, even for the times. But there are some great old actors, doing their best.\n\nIt’s a serious attempt, just a very flawed execution.\n\nInvaders from Mars\n\n1953 National Pictures Corp.\n\n− evil Martians arrive and possess\n\ncolor\n\ndirected William Cameron Menzies produced Edward L. Alperson screenplay Richard Blake music Raoule Kraushaar\n\nHelena Carter as Dr. Patricia Blake Arthur Franz as Dr. Stuart Kelston Jimmy Hunt as David MacLean Lief Erickson as George MacLean Hillary Brooke as Mary MacLean Morris Ankrum as Col. Fielding Max Wagner as Sgt. Rinaldi Bill Phipps as Sgt. Baker Milburn Stone as Capt. Roth Janine Perreau as Kathy Wilson\n\nVehicle: a glowing flying saucer.\n\nAliens: one scary, brainy Martian in a plastic bubble has tentacles, and orders the other Martians around using his bloodshot eyes. The other Martians are in fuzzy, faceless, teddy-bear suits.\n\nGadgets: brain implant, rock-boring ray.\n\nThe kid sees the saucer land, exclaims “Gee, whiz!”. Nobody believes him.\n\nThe Martians suck victims into the sand. The victims return home, with only a little scar on the back of the neck to show for it, and… they aren’t the same.\n\nWeird choral music reminds me of 2001: A Space Odyssey.\n\nDespite the kid and the silly outfits, it’s not a happy movie — certainly not a movie for little kids. It treats death and treachery. But pathetically lame props and sets sabotage its attempt at drama and horror. Its ending is stock Hollywood, unsatisfying as it is unimaginative.\n\nThe film was re-made in 1983, with more special effects, but not better.\n\nParables:\n\nListen to the kid!\n\nMartians, bad!\n\nLeave it to the army!\n\nFour Sided Triangle\n\n1953 Hammer Film Productions\n\n− duplication to solve romance problem\n\nB&W\n\nbased on William F. Temple’s novel directed Terence Fisher produced Michael Carreras,\n\nAlexander Paal wrote Paul Tabori,\n\nTerence Fisher\n\nPremise: a scientist has invented a system that perfectly reproduces objects.\n\nNow imagine the most ill-advised thing to duplicate, and the worst possible reason for doing so, and imagine convincing others to participate.\n\nAs science fiction, the film is a fair attempt at the stock premise. The story is beyond the pale, though.\n\nThe camera work is quite good — it’s a pretty film. The special effects don’t amount to much — some bubbling flasks, lots of electronic whatnot, an oscilloscope.\n\nSome characters are fairly sympathetic. There are moments of fairly good acting. And… I’m a sucker for perfect British diction.\n\nThe production values can’t redeem the film from the wildly unlikely behavior of the main characters at crucial points of the story. In a film like this, one expects to swallow a difficult science fiction premise. To watch otherwise-reasonable people acting in ways that no normal person would… is not what I signed up for.\n\n“In all my life, I only wanted two things: knowledge and… love.”\n\nIt Came from Outer Space\n\n1953 Universal International\n\nOK aliens arrive… now what?\n\nB&W; originally 3-D\n\nproduced William Alland directed Jack Arnold screenplay Harry Essex story Ray Bradbury special photography David S. Horsley dir. of photography Clifford Stine art direction Bernard Herzbrun,\n\nRobert Boyle set decorations Russell A. Gausman,\n\nRuby R. Levitt sound Leslie I. Carey,\n\nGlenn E. Anderson musical direction Joseph Gerschenson film editor Paul Weatherwax gowns Rosemary Odell hair stylist Joan St. Oegger make-up Bud Westmore assistant director Joseph E. Kenny\n\nVehicle: a mesh of polygons in fireworks. Sounds like a jet aircraft as it flies over the Southwestern desert, and crashes into the ground.\n\nOnce it’s on the ground, a hexagonal door slowly opens, showing… something like a classical atom model inside.\n\nAliens: big shapeless glob with an eyeball on a stalk in the middle, with mossy hair over some parts. Leave a sparkly trail on the ground as they move. We know when we’re seeing through a monster’s eye when it’s like looking through a bubble.\n\nIt’s a little confused in a couple of places whether the aliens take over a person’s form, or actually steal their body. It must be the former. When they take over the pretty girl, she changes to a pretty evening gown. But while some players get fancier clothes when the aliens take them over, and others don’t — as though the director was unsure what the change of clothing signified.\n\nWeapon: metal wand that produces a cool ray that can cut through rocks.\n\nGadget: cone that also shoots a ray. There’s some talk about some device that propels the spacecraft — it’s not clarified whether this is the cone or the atom-model thingy.\n\nThe hero is an amateur stargazer and a writer — evidently of fiction. He has a bad tendency to talk to himself in front of other people. The heroine is a schoolteacher. It looks very much as if they are a couple, maybe they live together. They aren’t married! And they’re stupidly poetically in love.\n\nThey get into a cute, open mini-chopper to investigate the crash. The hero gets a peek inside the alien ship, but then a landslide re-buries it.\n\nAn alien appears in the road in front of them, driving them off the road. “Did you hit it?” “I’ll see.” He pulls the pistol out of the glove box.\n\nThe story is like this: the creepy aliens come, and do creepy things, but what should we do about it? The question goes back and forth many times in the picture, unfortunately, both sides again and again make threats and issue ultimatums, and then back off from them, without any apparent reason. It’s like — what were we arguing about? Why?\n\nAs sci-fi, this is one of the better alien visitation films of the 1950s, inasmuch as it presents the situation from the point of view of the aliens.\n\nThe script is pretty bad, though. The actors do their best, within the conventions of the time.\n\n\"We are sure of the future,… so very sure.\"\n\nParables:\n\nThe aliens are just too ugly for us.\n\nClearly, the writer should get the girl.\n\nThe Beast from 20,000 Fathoms\n\n1953 Jack Dietz Productions\n\n+ dinosaur NYC terror due to nukes\n\nB&W\n\nPremise: they blow up a nuke at the pole (depicted by stock footage) — a giant dinosaur commences stomping about shortly thereafter.\n\nVehicles: They’re flying in and out of the pole with C-47s. The film shows stock footage of other contemporary military aircraft.\n\nMonster: doesn’t resemble any dinosaur I know. The head looks like T. Rex, but it walks on all fours. It has something like plates on its backbone, not so big as a stegosaurus had, but similar in shape. Also, it sports big canine teeth, in un-dinosaur fashion. They start calling it a “Rhedosaurus”.\n\nThe first sighting is in the ocean off Nova Scotia as a sea serpent. Another sea captain reports a sea monster; the radio announcer follows the report: “he really ought to stop smoking that stuff and try Virginia Gold…” Half the movie is about the problem of witnesses convincing authorities.\n\nScience isn’t the only sort of knowledge that’s shaky here: “…Galileo who said the Earth is round. They made him recant, but the Earth is round.”\n\nThe professor goes down in a diving bell and straightaway locates the monster, and things go sour. I’m afraid that animals were injured in the making of this movie.\n\nBe warned. The scenes you’re waiting for are 80% to the end of the movie. The rest is all build-up.\n\nFinally, the monster appears on the docks in New York, Brooklyn Bridge in the background. The monster stomps on cars and walks through brick buildings. Guns only annoy it.\n\nThe famous scene of the monster eating the cop horrified me as a kid.\n\nThey hurt the monster, but then it turns out its blood carries some disease. The film discusses this a bit, but shows only guys feeling sick and sleepy. In the end, it becomes an excuse to use science to combat the monster.\n\nHarryhausen’s stop-action photography execution of the monster is beautiful. In some scenes its scale and movement isn’t convincing, but in others, you can almost believe.\n\nBradbury relates how the idea for the story came from a demolished roller-coaster reminding him of dinosaur bones. The film does homage to the roller coaster.\n\nThe historical progression of giant monsters starts out with early depictions of dinosaurs in their natural environments, then to King Kong, who gets loose in New York, to this film, where a dinosaur gets loose in the same town, to Godzilla, where another dinosaur-like thing stomps around in Tokyo. But thereafter, every manner of giant creature was going for walks all over the place.\n\nSpaceways\n\n1953 Hammer\n\n− murder-mystery-romance oh and rockets\n\nB&W\n\nproduced Michael Carreras screenplay Paul Tabori,\n\nRichard Landow directed Terence Fisher adaptation Paul Tabori from radio play by Charles Eric Maine music Ivor Slaney photography Reginald Wyer\n\nVehicle: the film employs stock sounding rocket clips throughout; repeatedly, clips of White Sands V-2 rocket tests. (White Sands missile range gets mention in the dialog!) We see a model of the rocket on a table. The design, if not the model itself, is familiar. The whole thing is roughly conical, in three parts. The bottom stage has four huge fins, the top stage has swept-back airplane wings, with canards in front.\n\nThey’ve been sending mice, etc., up in rockets. Now they’re planning to put the first artificial satellite in orbit.\n\nTo set up the back-story, the film shows lots of military guys, fancy parties, and pretty ladies, lots of social nonsense, and marital infidelity.\n\nThe only notable acting was that of Bartok. She takes the camera — not just because she’s pretty. (The rest are character actors at best.) As woman technician Lisa Frank, she does play an important role, but she is there primarily to provide a romantic edge.\n\nA third into the film, it delves into rockets in earnest. It provides a crash course of partially-accurate information for those who know nothing about space flight.\n\nDialog explains that once they get the rocket to “1075 miles above sea level… because at that height we know the rocket will become a satellite of the Earth, it will never return…” They believe a three-stage rocket is the answer.\n\nThere is talk of building a space station — nothing further comes of it.\n\nMore stock V-2 film. Count-downs drag out excruciatingly. As the V-2 takes off, the view switches briefly to show the launch scene from the film Rocketship X-M.\n\nIt is hard to associate the rocket model and drawings they present with any of the rocket launches they depict — they don’t resemble one another at all.\n\nThe big launch just shows another V-2. Like… their special effects department couldn’t produce a convincing launch of their cool rocket model. And they thought nobody would notice. (The movie poster showed rockets zooming around a space station. Surely I’m not the only one who was disappointed.)\n\nBut then it becomes a murder mystery, with rockets used as a place to hide bodies. From there, it stumbles into a romance.\n\nAlmost to the end of the film, we see nice matte paintings of a rocket like the model, and a set meant to represent the area beneath the rocket. The rocket interior consists of a big room with braces on the walls.\n\nThe space suit helmets have a tiny window, like a welder’s mask. There is a reason: it conceals the identities of the astronauts. Turns out, they aren’t careful about who gets into their rocket ship.\n\nThe space activity occurs in just the last few minutes of the film. The following all happens within one minute:\n\n“We’ll have to try the emergency!” (Approaches a watertight door wheel, labeled “Emergency”.) “It’s jammed!” (Oh no! They’re doomed!) But whoops, then it turns! And that returns them to Earth! (somehow) Happy faces! End credits!\n\nThis isn’t so much a science fiction as engineering fiction. The technical part was on drawing boards at the time, and it’s just a background to a main story, which itself was in need of editing — scratch that – re-writing.\n\nThe writers didn’t know what to do with a space adventure, so they spiced it up with murder mystery and romance, and by the time they got back to the space adventure, they just sloppily tacked it onto the end. It’s a writing and directing travesty.\n\nWar of the Worlds\n\n1953 Paramount\n\n++ Martians on the rampage\n\ncolor\n\nproduced George Pal directed Byron Haskin screenplay Barré Lyndon based on H.G. Wells’ novel\n\nThe film begins with an illustrated tour of the Solar System, by Chesley Bonestell. A Jupiter scene is reminiscent of a scene from the Disney film Fantasia.\n\nThe film shows features typical of George Pal films: newsreels and ghastly preachy stuff at beginning and ending of the film. (A minister who looks chillingly like Billy Graham prays for deliverance.)\n\nAliens: Martians, of “cool intelligence”, with a single, tri-color eye, spindly arms with three suction-cupped fingers and gooey skin. They scream like girls when hurt. They “recognize the significance of the British Isles”. (Which, presumably, means they aren’t all bad.)\n\nVehicles: Martians arrive on Earth in cylinders that land as meteors, with hatches that unscrew.\n\nVery otherworldly magnetically-levitated hovering death machines, have on a flexible stalk a death ray that “neutralizes mesons”, and a protective force-field “electromagnetic covering — a protective blister”. They have a tri-color “electronic eye” on a prehensile cable.\n\nA US Air Force YB-49 Flying Wing drops an A-Bomb is on the alien craft, to no effect. They are protected by their force-fields.\n\nForrester, a “top man in astro and nuclear physics”, has ill-fitted horn-rim glasses, which he removes to gaze upon Sylvia. (Seems he only needed them to make a smart first impression — we don’t see them again.)\n\nThe narrator (Paul Frees) speaks of the battle of the populations of other countries against the aliens.\n\nThe only non-white is one Mexican-American who gets vaporized right off.\n\nPostscript 1: A 2005 adaptation altered the nature of the Martian machines, making them more tripod-like as in the novel, and re-introduced the Martian’s vampirish behavior. I’m not convinced it was overall an improvement.\n\nPostscript 2: I saw a restored version of this film at the Berlinale in 2017 — the first time I had seen it on the big screen. They had cleaned it up beautifully — sound, color and everything: just gorgeous. The place was packed. Most of the audience had never seen it. Sure enough, the girls still screamed at the appropriate places, and it received hearty applause!\n\nParables:\n\nAliens are evil and want what is ours.\n\nThe scientist is handsome, once he removes his glasses.\n\nThe mob is mad and evil.\n\nThe Atom is our Friend, even when it can’t cut the mustard.\n\nRemarkable: Neither science nor military wins the war. It is an Earthling bacterial infection (perhaps brought on by the Power of Prayer), that kills the Martians (amen!).\n\nProject Moon Base\n\n1953 Galaxy\n\n− silly space spy drama\n\nB&W\n\nproduced Jack Seaman directed Robert Talmadge screenplay Robert Heinlein,\n\nJack Seaman based on a story by Irving Block\n\nDonna Martell as Col.

Carmody Robert Karmer as Sam John Straub chaplain Clarke Keene Spacecom operator John Tomecko blockhouse operator Robert Paltz bellboy\n\nDate: post 1970\n\nVehicles: very small one-person rocket ships, Canada and Mexico, fly to the space station, from which a Moon ship departs.\n\nThe space station is 350 ft in diameter; bears insignia USSF: U.S. Space Force (but craft bear the USAF insignia). Its purpose is to “consolidate the safety of the Free World.”\n\nElaborate sets and models manage always to look like sets and models.\n\nSet-up: the “enemies of Freedom” kill a scientist that was to go on the flight, and replace him with a double who’s to destroy the space station, which to them is a “perpetually menacing eye-in-the-sky”.\n\nThe film spends some footage on issues such as space-docking, weightlessness, and the airlessness of the Moon. The crew have the sense to wear space suits on the Moon, and communicate by radio while in the space suits.\n\nThe depiction of weightlessness of “free-fall” is quite unconvincing. The crew wear special space-boots that allow them to walk normally on ceilings or floors, to which are attached conventional chairs and tables.\n\nThe crew exhibit signs of great distress each time the rocket engine fires.\n\nEverybody smokes.\n\nHaydon Rorke has a lot of trouble with the technobabble.\n\nFirst surprise: Colonel Briteis is a woman! The dialog explains that she was picked because she weighs so little.\n\nBriteis doesn’t fill us with confidence, though. She’s as cute as a button, but sounds like Judy Garland (“Ooh! YOU!”). And of course, due to her feminine weakness, she accidentally fires the rockets that force them to land on the Moon.\n\nUniforms consist of T-shirts and shorts, a cute little skull cap, and cute space-boots. While Briteis makes this look great, the others strain to maintain their dignity.\n\nBriteis and Ford get stuck on the Moon, and duly marry, as is required by common decency, thus providing an ending to the story.\n\nLast surprise: The President of the U.S. is a woman!\n\nParables:\n\nBlast-off!\n\nA woman on the ship is bad luck (but if she must be President, I suppose she must)\n\nIn space — to enforce Freedom!\n\nThe perpetually menacing eye-in-the-sky of Freedom!\n\nWhen on the Moon, get married!\n\nRiders to the Stars\n\n1954 United Artists\n\n+ man-in-space melodrama\n\ncolor (B&W prints were made for TV)\n\nproducer Ivan Tors director Richard Carlson dir. photo.

O’Herli Kem Dibbs as David Wells James K. Best as Sidney K. Fuller\n\nDate: near future.\n\nThis is one of the first “man in space” films: there are no aliens or fantastic weapons. It’s about, what would we do up there anyway? It’s a pretty elaborate production. Aside from the outer space scenes, the cinematography is very impressive.\n\nThe titles cite several groups as scientific advisors for this film. The narration repeatedly plugs various institutions, such as Palomar Observatory. Despite that, the dialog garbles a lot of facts: reducing cosmological time scales by large factors, and asserting that cosmic rays may destroy the Moon in a million years. It says that “meteors” “survive” in space for “thousands of years”.\n\nMeteors are everywhere in space, and just as much a menace as in most other space films of this time. The film depicts weightlessness. An astronaut whose ship blows up is skeletonized immediately.\n\nPremise: to “catch a meteor in flight”, “to study the molecular structure of its outer hull before it’s burned away by friction with the air”, because they have observed that metallic objects are quickly “pounded to dust” by cosmic rays.\n\nOne pilot, Wells, objects on political and moral grounds:\n\nStanton: “Mr. Wells, if we’re not the first nation to solve the problem of space travel, we’ll have small chance of survival.”\n\nWells: “Here we go again, boys! War, killings. Every invention seems to have the same end.”\n\nStanton: “The exploration of space, by us, may be the end of wars! A space platform operated by a dictatorship would make slaves of all free people.”\n\nWells: “The man who invented the bow and arrow probably gave his countrymen the same speech!”\n\nThe dialog brings up a suggestion that an “electronic brain” should fly the rockets, but “it would have to be a mile long and would weigh thousands of tons”. It argues further: “courage and aggressiveness — that’s why we need men rather than machines for this job”. (At another point, though, they do use an “electronic computer”.)\n\nThe plot mostly concerns the choice and training of the pilots for the job. (Despite all this, the pilots regularly crack up and flaunt impassioned orders from the ground.) The principals wax and wax and wax romantic, about exploration, and the stars, and about romance generally. It’s a bit heavy.\n\nThe script emphasizes respect of professions: most of the characters are fancy doctors and pilots. One of the doctors is a lady. (One of the guys reacts to the information she’s a doctor, and another says: “Please, no obvious remarks.” She looks great in the various brown jumpsuits she wears, and is, as it turns out, available. Still, this film is more adult about the question of women professionals than many in this genre.)\n\nThe progression rocket–jet–“prop job” comes up more than once in dialog, with dismay always expressed for the latter, doubt and surprise for the former, and awe for the middle one.\n\nThe only non-white person involved is the famous jazz vocalist, Kitty White, who sings the awful, clumsy lyrics with egregious competence. Not depicted, but at least cited!\n\nThere are inappropriate relationships: the main pilot is the son of the main scientist in charge, and a romance emerges between him and the lady doctor.\n\nMost of the guys are smoking most of the time (but that’s the way it was). Nonetheless, one candidate for the mission fails to make the cut because he was “pacing and chain-smoking”. (There are “No Smoking” signs about, while fueling rockets.)\n\nThe acting isn’t bad, typical of the time period, even excellent, given the corny lines they had to work with.\n\nUnfortunately, the rockets and meteors vibrate ridiculously on their wires, swooping and wobbling worse than in earlier sci-fi serials — and the rockets whistle like bombs on their way down. It’s a pity — it blows any hope of realism that they tried so hard to set up.\n\nThe dialog explains that the rocket extends wings to fly back to the ground (very poorly depicted) and that it has a “scoop” for collecting meteors (again very poorly depicted).\n\nWe don’t even see the rockets until 3/4 through the film. Various stock footage of U.S. V-2 rocket tests serves to represent the film’s rockets, on the ground and launching. There is also some footage about assembly of the V-2s that I had never seen before. Famous stock footage of Earth photographed from sounding rockets also appears.\n\nParables:\n\nSpace is a place to go crazy about.\n\nLook out for the meteor!\n\nNo rocket fuel around? Have a smoke!\n\nThe cute guy gets the best girl whose career brings her closest to him.\n\nCreature from the Black Lagoon\n\n1954 Universal-International Pictures\n\nOK fish-man discovered; tragedy and screaming ensue\n\nB&W; originally 3-D\n\nproduced William Alland directed Jack Arnold story Maurice Zimm screenplay Harry Essex,\n\nArthur Ross dir. photography William E.

Explains that life formed in the sea, and animals came out onto the land… we see strange footprints on the beach. “15 Million years later, in the upper reaches of the Amazon, man is still trying to reach it.” (?)\n\nThe paleontologist finds a claw sticking out of the rock; he pulls it out. Scarcely do they turn their backs, before a very similar but wet claw reaches up from the water.\n\nThe scientist keeps saying the claw is from the “Devonian age”. Now, that’s 420 to 360 million years ago. That makes no sense. They talk about the animals being unchanged from Devonian times… but none of the animals they mention existed as such at that time. Surely they could have just looked up a local university professor and given them a call!\n\nNonetheless, the story does have a sci-fi premise, however wobbly.\n\nThey use ’50s SCUBA tanks. The water is awfully clear, for a lake named “Black Lagoon”.\n\nAll we see is the terrible claw for about a third of the film. But then, peek-a-boo! The guy in the creature suit really had to do some great swimming. That must have been hard in a full-body suit. It appears to be human! But it gulps air like a fish and its gills move!\n\nThere have been much worse monster suits — they really spent some time on this one.\n\nThey tackle the usual question about keeping the creature alive for study, or killing it because it’s dangerous.\n\nWeapons: they harpoon the creature twice, and hit him with poison, and shoot him with guns. He’s not impervious, but he’s very resilient.\n\nThe Brazilians are the first to snuff it, conveniently.\n\nMan! She’s all buttressed up in that ’50s swimsuit. It’s enough to turn any prehistoric fish-man’s thoughts to abduction!\n\nThe first time I saw this film would have been in ’63 or so. Some kids down the street had the first color TV in the neighborhood, and it could get more channels than my family’s. They said the “creature” was going to be playing. We all went over, and gathered around, squealing with excitement.\n\nWith difficulty, we got to see a few scenes, but the station wouldn’t come in well. Somehow that made it even more exciting. But the truth is, we hardly ever got to see the monster. (And who cares it was color anyway? The movie’s B&W.)\n\nIt’s a monster movie. It’s the Creature most Featured. There were many bad imitations.\n\nA popular 2017 movie, The Shape of Water, which really isn’t sci-fi, concerns a creature patently derived that of the Black Lagoon.\n\nGog\n\n1954 Ivan Tors Productions\n\n− cold-war technology horror\n\ncolor (very saturated); originally 3-D\n\nproduced Ivan Tors directed Herbert L. Strock screenplay Tom Taggart based on Ivan Tors’ story music Harry Sükman orchestration Henry Vars dir. phot. Lothrop B. Worth art dir. William Ferrari assoc. prod. science rsrch. Maxwell Smith\n\nIt’s a cold-war technology film.\n\nVehicles: The initial titles are on paintings of stylized V-2 rocket, and a wheel-like space station. The good guy arrives in a very cute, small double-rotor helicopter… looks like a McCulloch MC-4. They fly in it without helmets, and just chat and smoke, like it’s not loud.\n\nAll sorts of antennas and gadgets pop out of the ground. Sun mirrors “focused on us, they could burn us to a crisp”. We get talk about a paraboloid!\n\nComputer: a “giant brain machine”, N.O.V.A.C. Nuclear Operative Variable Automatic Computer, controls the gadgets. It was made in Switzerland “five years ago”.\n\nRobots: Gog and Magog, roll on small tank tracks, each has five arms with grasping hands and another arm that is a blow torch. They wave their arms maniacally when they move. Compare to Lost In Space “Danger, Will Robinson!”\n\nOther gadgets:\n\nPaper tape storage gets wows.\n\nTeletype machine running at about 2 bytes / sec.\n\nAtomic reactors.\n\nElectronically-controlled tuning forks, to pick up vibrations.\n\nThe technobabble in this film is just terrible. The dialog is chock-full of high-school science and almost-science.\n\nThin mustaches prevail.\n\nThe women characters mostly have important positions, and the guys take them seriously. They also die just like the guys do. Most of the women are blondes or redheads. I saw one gray-haired older woman, and one brunette.\n\nWe’re blindsided by a romantic scene, à propos of nothing, leading nowhere. They get back to it only in the closing scenes.\n\nThe film would have us understand that the best way to stop robot havoc is by flamethrowers, preferably in confined spaces — and, when the flamethrower poops out, by whacking them with the flamethrower nozzle. Yes, this is how our hero finishes the titular monsters off.\n\nA rocket plane turns out to have been the culprit, “made of fiberglass” so it was invisible on radar, made by “our enemies”, quickly dispatched by USAF jets. One fighter jet is probably an F-86 Sabre another is probably an F-94C Starfire.\n\nThe next day, they launch a space station, “so that nobody can take us by surprise again”. The launch of a V-2 test rocket appears. The End.\n\nIt’s pretty bad. It gets points for the color, the inventory of gadgets, and the cold-war atmosphere.\n\nQuotes:\n\nOf paper tape computer records:\n\n“every punched hole represents a thought.”\n\n“Science is never frightening”\n\n… famous last words.\n\n“At these frequencies, sound generates intense heat! Open your mouths!”\n\nParables:\n\nThe alpha male is in charge of picking up ladies’ bodies when they faint.\n\nThe alpha male is in charge of picking up dead women’s bodies.\n\nEnemies taking you by surprise?

It even manages to be scary.\n\nShot in the yucca forest.\n\nCops find a little girl in shock with a mutilated doll. She’s excellent in the part, and sets the ominous tone all by herself. (And she’s the one who says “Them!”)\n\nA dozen very familiar actors appear, many uncredited. The radio announcer is very familiar, too.\n\nCheck out the cash register! That would have been antique in the ’50s!\n\nOh man, then the cops split up on a dark blowy night, where a very violent homicide has occurred. That can’t be good.\n\nAircraft: North American B-25 Mitchell, USAF insignia, marked 1203. (The underside of the nose windshields were covered up.) Nice whirligigs: Sikorsky R-5 (amazingly quiet and comfy inside).\n\nWeapons: Handguns don’t stop the ants, but can damage antennae. The cop happens to have a machine gun, which is effective. Bazookas are fun, but ticklish to operate. Automatic rifles are also pretty good… but there are so many monsters. Hand grenades! Even better! Flamethrowers prove especially effective in close quarters and tight spaces.\n\nWeldon plays her part like an adult and professional, except her skirt gets caught coming down from the plane, and she screams and falls down on seeing a monster. But besides that… Then again, why’s she in the desert in heels?\n\nLater, Arnass says: “It’s no place for you or any other woman.” She talks him down pretty well, playing the scientist card.\n\nAs far as science goes: many people learned much of the science they ever knew about ants from this film. Formic acid, particularly, figures into the script.\n\nBiblical prophesy: “…the beasts shall reign over the Earth” (Added, just so God knows we’re thinking about Him.)\n\nThe scene of the skeletons was too much for me, as a kid.\n\nRisk of nationwide panic is a big part of the dialog, and the reason for the G-man telling a shrink not to release his patient. (I hope, even in the ’50s, people questioned the legality of such activity.) Anyway, shortly after, they drop that concern, and proceed to panic the public.\n\nSeveral of the principals change their hats during the film. Whitmore wears at least three: a cop hat, a fedora, and an army helmet.\n\nQuotes:\n\n“He’s with the FBI, so watch your language!”\n\n“Myrmecologist! Why don’t we all talk English?”\n\n“Held together with saliva.” “Yeah?

Now, for the first time, I’m looking at the work of the creators of the film.\n\nAfter a few ships get sunk, Godzilla shows up pretty quickly. His voice is one of the most amazing things — really scary — maybe a mix of an elephant’s trumpet and a big steel gate screeching and a tiger’s roar. He’s got radioactive footprints, and leaves trilobites in them. He’s 50 meters tall. Breath (steam?) so hot it burns everything up. The scales on his back also shimmer electrically when he breathes this fire.\n\nThe professor describes him as “a creature from the Jurassic era.” Explains that “approximately 2 million years ago”, “brontosaurus” and other dinosaurs were on the Earth. Godzilla must be one of a marine species of reptile, hidden away in a deep cave. Repeated underwater H-bomb tests destroyed its natural habitat.\n\nThere’s conflict among authorities about whether to make the info public or not. To avoid panic, or to tell the truth? But evidently, they decide for truth!\n\nThe professor doesn’t want Godzilla killed.\n\nBut the self-defense force immediately begins dropping depth charges. As near as I could count, besides this ineffective measure, they tried: machine guns, rifles, an electrified fence of barbed wire, artillery, tanks. Rockets fired from jet fighters apparently drove him off.\n\nGodzilla was “baptized in the fire of the H-bomb.” “What could kill it now?”\n\nHiroshima gets mention.\n\nA scientist has an “oxygen destroyer” “that splits the oxygen atoms to liquid”. This is what finally proves effective on the monster.\n\nBoth a guy in a rubber suit, and stop-action figures, represent Godzilla. The detail of the sets and models is very elaborate and convincing. The fighter models appear to be of F-86 Sabers.\n\nThis was not the first time a giant dinosaur came stomping out of the sea on film — see The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms. This is the first of the Japanese kaiju films, mostly produced by Toho Co., which dominated Japanese sci-fi film production for three decades. They got weirder, but never better, than this.\n\nThe message is explicitly anti-nuke-testing. This film explores the personal trauma of people in a disastrous situation, much better anyway than most of its successors.\n\n20,000 Leagues Under the Sea\n\n1954 Walt Disney\n\n+ pretty, dumb Verne adaptation\n\ncolor\n\ndirected Richard Fleischer screenplay Earl Felton music Paul Smith photographed Franz Planer effects photog.

We get to hear Douglas singing and playing guitar. (Evidently he really was playing.)\n\nI read that, at the time, this was the most expensive film ever made.\n\nVehicle: the submarine Nautilus, done to look quite scary on the outside, and richly appointed inside. The contemporary steam ships are very convincing, too. The gunnery on the ship certainly looks contemporary. Nice big-movie scenes of the mid-century port of San Francisco.\n\nThe casting of Peter Lorre as Conseil is dubious. He doesn’t fit the character, and somehow doesn’t fit the script well — I guess they used him to balance Kirk Douglas.\n\nDisney Americanized the film to the point that Ned Land loses his Canadian citizenship. Only Aronnax and Conseil and Nemo appear non-American. The script downplays the role of Aronnax as the narrator and observer for the much more exciting and manly character Ned Land.\n\nThe film represents Nemo well enough — he’s mysterious: tyrannical, but cultured, tortured, but brilliant. The movie adds that he’s a Bach fan.\n\nThe book does not adequately explain why Nemo’s crew stay with him underwater without compensation, and neither does the movie. I found this problematic. I have to wonder if the crew tire of always hearing the same Bach.\n\nThe seal Esmerelda is quite fun, an addition for the kids. Nice giant squid!\n\nThe story had already seen film adaptations in 1907 and 1916. Since, there have been multiple TV adaptations and film spin-offs.\n\nInvasion of the Body Snatchers\n\n1955 Walter Wanger Pictures Inc.\n\n+ alien seeds copy sleepers\n\nB&W\n\nproducer Walter Wanger director Don Siegel screenplay Daniel Mainwaring based on Jack Finney’s serial story music Carmen Dragon dir. phot. Ellsworth Fredericks\n\nPremise: seeds from space duplicate people’s bodies when they sleep, and kill them. The script makes no attempt to further explain the origin of the seeds. The overtaken people are happy and cooperative, though.\n\nThe production is a little choppy. The romantic scenes often seem out of place — although it is noteworthy that the romance does not end in standard Hollywood fashion.\n\nThere are stories of controversies about adding humorous scenes and narrated speeches. They were on uncharted ground with this topic, and weren’t sure how it should play out\n\nThe studio tacked a happy ending onto the film, with sequences including Whit Bissell as Dr. Hill and Richard Deacon as Dr. Harvey Bessett (who do not appear in the credits listing). The original ended with the protagonist running on the highway, hollering at passing cars for help.\n\nThe dialog brings the dryness of martinis up repeatedly: after they look at a partly-formed human duplicate, “I think we could all use a drink!”\n\nIt is odd how often characters just enter one another’s houses in this film. It’s a small town, but this degree of familiarity is hard to believe.\n\nThe main props are the seed pods and human copies emerging from them. This effect is as good as any of the time, and even now it’s pretty creepy.\n\nThis was the biggest invasion paranoia film of the time — many more followed. Re-makes: one in 1978, Body Snatchers in 1993 and The Invasion in 2007.\n\nConquest of Space\n\n1955 Paramount\n\n+ why-is-man-in-space\n\ncolor\n\nproduced George Pal directed Byron Haskin from novel by Chesley Bonestell and\n\nWilly Ley adapted Philip Yourdan,\n\nBarré Lyndon,\n\nGeorge Worthing Yates\n\nThe lead-in is a nice summary:\n\nThis is a story of tomorrow, or of the day after tomorrow, when men have built a station in space constructed in the form of a great wheel, and set a thousand miles out from the Earth, fixed by gravity and turning about the world every two hours, serving a double purpose: an observation post in the heavens, and a place where a spaceship can be assembled, and then launched to explore other planets and the vast Universe itself, in the last and greatest adventure of Mankind — a plunge toward the… Conquest of Space\n\n(Those who enjoyed The Muppet Show will recognize a spoof of this lead-in.)\n\nThis is a straight-up “man in space” movie. There are no monsters or aliens, computers or weapons.\n\nSeveral space vehicles appear besides the Wheel. The coolest is Spaceship 1, which combines a beautiful mono-wing craft, a classic rocket ship, and realistic space fuel tanks. Then there is a single-person “taxi”, open to space, and some transport rockets. The realism was marred by rocket exhaust effects that owe to the Flash Gordon serials, but otherwise, these are the best spaceships of the decade.\n\nThe film treats weightlessness and the vacuum pretty well, as well as atmospheric burn-up, and a space-walk on a moving ship. Moreover, the dialog explains these things pretty well. Space workers wear very functional-looking space suits, and walk only with magnetic shoes.\n\nDuring rocket accelerations, the faces of the crew contort grotesquely and even bleed. They accelerate to 20,000 MPH (according to the “Space Speed Indicator”).\n\nThis is a military outfit, but the dialog never clarifies whose. Crew members are beholden to the “Supreme International Space Authority“, and watch TV broadcasts of “Trans-World Communications”.\n\nCrew members talk about having fought in WWII and the Korean conflict.\n\nThe only environmental hazards are “meteors” (involved in three scenes), and the dry and crumbly Martian planetary surface.\n\nEven more lethal, however, is “space fatigue”, which causes paralysis, questions of the propriety of man’s place in space, homicide, and readings from the Bible.\n\nThe views of Earth from space are beautiful and very convincing. These are unmatched in this decade of cinema.\n\nSpace explorers eat food from tablets to improve their health, not because it’s more compact. Then they all smoke (presumably for the same reason).\n\nThe script is choppy; it feels like they were just trying to do too much. It mixes interesting space action with formulaic military chivalry, death-defying action scenes, comic relief, awe-inspired monologues, girls in bathing suits, and mother’s love. It contains discussions of race, family responsibility, and the future of mankind. And so on. A little focus would have helped.\n\nThe film spends a lot of effort developing personalities and relationships that are either implausible or stereotypical.\n\nThe women portrayed here are archetypal, and appear only in video transmissions, consisting of: a chorus line, a loving, supportive mother, and a vamp girlfriend.\n\nThe crew is quite multi-ethnic. Besides the Japanese, German, Irish, Jewish, and Italian-Americans who have lines, there are Black crew members.\n\nWhile the comic relief, mostly coming from Brooklyn stand-up comedian Phil Foster, really is fun, one wonders why the film required so much relief.\n\n“…for a fat solid year I’ve been eating birdseed out of this goofy sombrero with no squawk.”\n\nOf a capsulized sandwich, he remarks:\n\n“This ain’t Kosher corned beef!”\n\nAs a tough old Irish-American sergeant, Mickey Shaughnessy delivers a performance that is sometimes really scary, and…really out of place.\n\n“Listen, you slimy little calumniator — if you were one-tenth the man that the general is, you’d be twice the man you are!”\n\n“…I’ll pull out your filthy tongue and strangle you with it!”\n\n“…It’ll be a rope for you, Captain, and I hope they make it slow, very slow, so I can watch ya kick!”\n\nThe most precious moments are poetic speeches by Benson Fong (who was of Chinese ancestry), wherein he apologizes for the behavior of Japan in WWII, explains why Japanese use chopsticks and build buildings of wood and paper, rationalizes the exploration of Mars, and explains why he and his kind are “little people”.\n\nParables:\n\nThe Universe was put here for Man to conquer (Man meaning “tough military-type guys”)\n\nQuestions:\n\nAre we explorers, or invaders of the sacred domain of God?\n\nThis Island Earth\n\n1955 Universal\n\n+ aliens take people on space adventure\n\ncolor\n\ndirected by Joseph M. Newman from novel by Raymond F. Jones\n\nThe U.S. Air Force lends James-Bond-handsome scientist Cal Meacham a jet fighter, just because they want him to like them. When he zooms around in it, he gets into trouble with aliens. But when he gets to the lab, he’ll unzip his flight suit to reveal his tweed jacket, and the science can begin!\n\nAliens: from Metaluna, which is at odds with planet Zahgon, whose inhabitants keep shooting “meteors” at them.\n\nThey provide instructions on how to build an “interociter”, which turns out to be a triangular TV, which is equipped with deadly laser beams, explicitly to underscore the superiority of alien technology. (Like, someday, your TV, too, will sport deadly laser beams!)\n\nThe Metalunan’s flying saucer surely affected the style of the disk of Star Trek‘s Enterprise. It also has something like a tractor beam.\n\nOn Metaluna, Cal and Ruth get scared by a “Mutant” slave, get threatened with captivity, then run away just in time to escape the planet’s destruction. You might think this would be a major part of the story, but it all happens very quickly, in a rush.\n\nThe basic idea held promise, but the sci-fi story was eroded by silly immaterial he-man and gee-whiz stuff. What’s left is a mess of fantastic special effects and scenes, and a scary monster.\n\nParables:\n\nThe aliens have motives, which are, naturally, ulterior.\n\nThe alien world is dying.\n\nThe usual stuff about the alpha male and the girl.\n\nIt Came from Beneath the Sea\n\n1955 Columbia Pictures\n\n− giant octopus attacks\n\nB&W\n\nproduced Charles H.

Burns Dean Maddox, Jr. as Adm. Norman Chuck Griffiths as Lt. Griff Harry Lauter as Deputy Bill Nash Richard W. Peterson as Capt. Stacy\n\nThe film is partly in newsreel form. Some scenes resemble military training reels.\n\nThe build-up is very slow, not completely uninspired, but sometimes clumsy.\n\nVehicles: atom-powered submarine\n\nA USAF B-47 take-off appears. Did I understand the principals were transported in one of these? But — it’s a two-seater.\n\nCreature: a giant octopus. Radiation has something to do with the creature… although evidently, radiation didn’t create it. A scientist proposes that the creature was “disturbed by hydrogen bombs”. The dialog discusses why the monster behaves as it does, but the question is never clearly resolved.\n\nThey wear funny radiation suits… only nose and mouth are visible.\n\nProf. Joyce is a scientist, and there’s a love triangle. The film spends a good part of its time on this, but it never becomes romantically believable. It is at least very out of place. Here and there are tentative statements of female independence.\n\nThe romantic fencing match starts off right away, and continues to the end of the film. The Navy commander is real pushy, and she likes it. More than once, the commander makes advances on her, with her main guy directly present, observing and commenting. They stay civil. She lists out her complaints about the commander’s mistreatment of her. She is serious, and her complaints are pretty damning. Next scene: she screams at the sight of the monster.\n\nBoth male principals heroically risk their lives to fight the monster. And each has to save the other’s life, in different scenes. This chivalry is awfully forced, and time-consuming.\n\nAnother story line is the usual reluctance of the authorities to respond properly to eye-witnesses and scientists. One of the most unintendedly-silly scenes is the big scientist blowing up a balloon and letting it fly sputtering away in a serious meeting.\n\nThe film represents at least three of the U.S. armed forces. Most of the military scenes take place in a submarine, but there are long Navy destroyer scenes, battling the monster.\n\nThe Army drives the creature back with flamethrowers. The Navy finally dispatches the creature (as is only fitting, since it came from the sea).\n\nEach hero goes out from a Navy sub in a scuba suit to attack the monster by hand.\n\nLike most giant monsters, the beast evolved the ability to growl like a tiger, in order optimize its chances of making teenagers squeal. Similarly, it finds itself drawn to recognizable monuments — in this case, the Golden Gate Bridge.\n\nChinese-American women appear briefly, working at the telephone exchange. No other non-whites appear.\n\nThe problem with this film is the 90% back-story, dominated by the male writer’s ideas of modern sexual interactions. This in itself might be amusing as a study of the period — but it detracts badly from the main story. They try to combine the newsreel aspect, with war training films, with a romance drama, with the monster movie. It’s just too much, and it fails overall.\n\nBesides that… the action isn’t always great, but sometimes not bad. The acting isn’t bad.\n\nThe romantic conflict is never resolved… but we find out she is a “new breed of woman”. This is mildly intriguing, but it serves here only as a closing scene.\n\nAs a giant monster film: it was preceded by more famous ones, better executed, the year before. The main reason for watching this movie is Harryhausen’s brilliant animation. I include the film here mainly because of his monster, and because its production values are fairly good, on and off.\n\n“H-bombs have been blamed for every freak accident that’s happened since, up to and including… marine monsters being disturbed”\n\nThe Quatermass Xperiment\n\n(aka.

It builds rather slowly, but have no fear: an icky monster does eventually show up!\n\nThe film begins with a missile-looking thing with fancy fins crashes, plugging its nose into a farmer’s yard. (Surely by this time, people were aware of what happens to aircraft that dive straight into the ground. Who did they fool with this?)\n\nCall in the fire brigade! The police advise people to return to their homes. Call in Quatermass! In this one, Quatermass is a Yank, a loud, overbearing jerk, who will not let anybody get in his way cleaning up the disaster he caused.\n\nThe woman actors are much younger than any of the men, and they aren’t very good.\n\nScenes inside the space rocket show no concern about absence of gravity.\n\nIt’s pretty scary in places, and unlike anything of its time. It must have terrified people at the time.\n\nLike the two other Quatermass experiment films, this one was based on 1953 BBC TV serial The Quatermass Experiment.\n\n“There’s no room for personal feelings in Science, Judith!”\n\n宇宙人東京に現わる\n\n(aka.

(They are obviously just people wearing star-shaped canvas suits.) It may not be very encouraging, but — the alien’s appearance is the worst part. Planet Paira is on the opposite side of the Sun from Earth.\n\nI looked away from this film a couple of times, because of the very silly star-shaped aliens, with their one great big blue eye. (In the U.S. cut for TV, the aliens appear in the first scenes, probably to grab the attention of young viewers. These scenes are close-ups, because in the original, the aliens speak a non-Earthling language, and the original film took screen real estate for Japanese subtitles. English versions simply overdubbed the alien language, and dropped the subtitles, which, to fill the screen, required magnification of the scenes, along with their weak costumes.)\n\nVehicles: There are customary flying saucers, which the scientists have a great deal of trouble photographing. A large space station, or mother ship, has a horn-shaped axis, with six horn-shaped spokes, connected by a transparent toroidal tube.\n\nWeapons: none as such. No robots, no computers.\n\nHalfway through the film, the aliens express disappointment that people react in terror when they sneak up on them in star form. So they choose one to arrive in the body of a famous show-girl. She can walk through walls, etc.\n\nThe aliens worry about super-explosives developed by Earth scientists.\n\nThen the aliens have to warn the Earth to destroy yet another planet “R”, which is going to collide with Earth. (As though the explosives excuse weren’t enough. I suspect the writers had two stories, and rather than picking one, merged them.)\n\nThe action involves scientists a lot. It is they who see the alien flying saucers in their big telescopes, it is they whom the aliens contact, and it is they who ultimately resolve the threat.\n\nThe dialog isn’t bad, so long as the main topics aren’t being discussed. Otherwise, it’s very artificial and conventional.\n\nThe actors remark on the colors that appear in the scene with them, which are indeed very nice.\n\nLots of scenes show pretty, prosperous, post-war Japan. The filming is good, and the direction isn’t as bad as in many bad sci-fi movies.\n\nThere are lots of disaster scenes. The resolution is very dramatic, but unsurprising.\n\nBasically, if you can bring yourself to overlook the alien suits, this turns out to be a respectable early story of alien contact.\n\nWorld Without End\n\n1956 Allied Artists Pictures Corporation\n\n− space / time travel drama\n\ncolor\n\nproduced by Richard Heermance directed, wrote Edward Bernds\n\nHugh Marlowe as John Borden John Borden as Dr. Galbraithe Nancy Gates as Garnet Rodney Turt Taylor as Herbert Ellis Christopher Dark as Henry Jaffe Lisa Montell as Deena Everett Glass as President Timmek Booth Colman as Mories Stanley Fraser as Councilman Elda William Vedder as Councilman James Paul Brinegar as Vida Rankin Mansfield as Beryl Mickey Simpson as Naga Herb Vigran second reporter\n\nDates: 1957, 2508 AD.\n\nVehicle: rocket ship, pointy, silver, winged, horizontal-flying. Has “magnetic gravity”.\n\nIt leaves for Mars to do reconnaissance without landing. That’s the end of the Mars part of the story.\n\nOn the way back, something (never explained but later described as an “exponential time displacement”) that makes them go faster than light, so that they end up crashing on Earth in the future. (The crash is very cheesy: the rocket ship buzzes like a diving prop plane, and bounces like a plastic model.)\n\nAtomic war has destroyed Earth’s surface. They are beset by giant spiders and cyclops cavemen “mutates”.\n\nThey find the remains of civilization underground, where the doors slide automatically, the men wear tights and skullcaps in the wimpiest way possible, and the women, who are all shapely and between the ages of 19 and 25, wear high heels, short skirts and very low-cut blouses.\n\nSeveral romances ensue.\n\nStylistically, the look is more like ’60s sci-fi. Sets are in styles that would appear later in Star Trek.\n\nThe space guys show the peaceful humans the benefits of firepower and aggression. They also determine that the best way to deal with a cave man is with a bazooka (hand guns being deemed somehow inadequate). They spare the better-looking cavemen, and teach them English.\n\nParables:\n\nMan was not meant to live in a hole in the ground.\n\n(Men, anyway: the men get wimpy, the women get voluptuous.)\n\nTo live in peace, you gotta shoot the bad guys.\n\n(The bad guys are the ugly ones.)\n\nEarth vs the Flying Saucers\n\n1956 Columbia Pictures\n\n+ paradigmatic invasion by spaceships\n\nB&W\n\ndirected Fred Sears produced Charles H.

John Hanley Thomas Browne Henry as Adm. Enright Paul Frees (uncredited) voice of aliens\n\nVehicles: spinning flying saucers that zing and zip and flicker and teeter alarmingly. Magnetic fields power them.\n\nStock footage shows various sounding rockets, including V-2, Viking (VIII, IX or X), represent Earth vehicles.\n\nOn first encounter with flying saucers, driving through the desert, Dr. Marvin wisely takes the wheel from his wife, and offers her a smoke.\n\nThere is much discussion of purported sightings of UFO’s, and of satellites that blow up in outer space (or do they?).\n\nThe film is punctuated by newsreels, We see nice ’50s engineering drawings.\n\nComputers: indeterminate boxes attended by military guys. Electronic translator: an enormous, clicking, table of spinning switches which produces output in the form of cursive writing by means of a mechanical pen.\n\nAliens: Big-eyed, slit mouth, pointy jaw. Resemble certain bog bodies. Only seen suited or dead. “Humanoid, and ancient“.\n\nAn “electronic screen” protects the saucers. When one alien ventures out from under this screen, it is immediately and without warning fired upon with heavy artillery.\n\nThe alien space suits are quite cool, if clumsy, and made of “solidified electricity”, and feature helmets with no transparent part. “These suits serve as electronic and mechanical outer skin; take the place of their atrophied flesh and muscles.”\n\nThe alien’s voice (that of Paul Frees) sounds suspiciously like Orson Welles’. Its message repeats in Spanish, Mandarin, Japanese, French, and other languages.\n\nAliens also have flat-screen (presumably black-and-white) TV. They use glowing reconnaissance drones that are susceptible to handguns. Aliens have a rose-shaped crystal translating device that reads the info from human brains into an “infinitely indexed memory bank”, momentarily rendering the victim’s brain visible, and turning the victim into a zombie. (When I saw this as a kid, I got too scared.)\n\nWeapons: Aliens have an ultrasonic ray (anticipating Star Trek phasers) that makes people and things evaporate noisily or blow up. It fires from the arms of alien space suits, and from guns on flexible stalks beneath saucers. Soldiers persist shooting with rifles, only to be evaporated; stock Nike Ajax and Nike Hercules film portrays futile rocket attacks.\n\nThe Marvins make an “ultrasonic gun” to no avail; then they make the “induced electrical field” weapon, which finally proves effective. (If humans had made use of the saucers’ propensity for crashing into recognizable monuments, this would have been unnecessary.)\n\nThe majority of the film is about the hero scientist and his lovely wife figuring out how to save the world. There are pacing problems, besides an overall unnaturalness of the scipt. Once the saucers start attacking, it becomes all about the animation: direction and dialog go out the window, and integration with the animation is very poor.\n\n“All military installations are to fire on sight at any flying objects not identifiable”\n\nParables:\n\nAliens are evil and want what we have.\n\nPeople will panic and shoot at scary things — who can blame them?\n\nSoldiers make good cannon fodder.\n\nScience wins the day.\n\nHave a smoke!\n\nForbidden Planet\n\n1956 MGM\n\n++ the Tempest + long-dead aliens\n\ncolor\n\ndirected Fred McLeod Wilocx produced Nicholas Nayfack based on story by Irving Block and\n\nAllen Adler screenplay Cyril Hume music Bebe and Louis Barron\n\nWalter Pidgeon as Dr. Edward Morbius Anne Francis as Altaira Leslie Nielsen as Commander J.

Scenes of the inside of titanic Krell machines are very impressive. According to Morbius, the power of some Krell machines is “The number 10 raised almost literally to the power infinity”. (Thus rendering the units this number measures literally inconsequential.)\n\nThe sets are very elaborate. The landscaping of Morbius’ house is very tasteful, in a sort of Southwest rock-garden style.\n\nAtmospheric sound effects are more than background noise.\n\nThe special effects are gorgeous. They include: huge metal doors that snap shut in the blink of an eye, massive underground power-plants, force-fields, and a very scary “monster from the Id”.\n\nScenes of the planet from space are very convincing. (Are these stock footage of Earth?)\n\nThe plot parallels in many ways Shakespeare’s The Tempest (Prospero – Morbius, Miranda – Altaira, Ariel+Caliban – Robbie, Stephano – Cook).\n\nThe cast is unrelentingly WASPy. (There’s an Irish stereotype).\n\nAltaira suffers from fascination in healthy male specimens, and ignorance of kissing.\n\nAt least one of the SFx guys was from Disney. (Compare spaceship decor to that of The Black Hole.)\n\nThe careers of many of the props, notably Robby and the flying saucer, were longer than those of the cast members. The saucer appeared many times on TV, including the Twilight Zone.\n\nParables:\n\nAbsolute power leads to absolute blah, blah.\n\nThe unknown is bad and scary.\n\nThe alpha male gets the girl, stupid!\n\nThe Incredible Shrinking Man\n\n1957 Universal Pictures\n\n+ guy shrunk by radiation\n\nB&W\n\nproduced Albert Zugsmith directed Jack Arnold based on Richard Matheson’s\n\nThe Shrinking Man\n\nGrant Williams as Scott Carey Randy Stuart as Louise Carey April Kent as Clarice Paul Langton as Charlie Carey Raymond Bailey as Dr. Thomas Silver William Schallert as Dr. Arthur Bramson Frank Scannell as Barker Helene Marshall nurse Diana Darrin nurse Billy Curtis midget\n\nThe premise is that radioactive fallout causes a guy to physically shrink, and that’s about as far as the science goes. Note: deliberately and scientifically shrinking people had been done before: see The Devil Doll and Dr. Cyclops. This one takes the premise much farther than those films, however.\n\nBut it’s a silly idea very well executed, without a pulling a punch. The guy has a serious problem (or rather, lots of problems) to solve.\n\nThe acting is very good, and the special effects are among the best of the time. This film rises above its premise, and is one of the best sci-fi movies of its decade.\n\nThis film’s success spurred development of similarly-themed films that shortly followed its release, including The Amazing Colossal Man, Attack of the 50-Foot Woman and War of the Colossal Beast. None is as good as this one.\n\n20 Million Miles to Earth\n\n1957 Columbia\n\n+ Earth ship returns with Venusian\n\nB&W\n\nstory by Charlott Knight screenplay Bob Williams\n\nChristopher Knopf directed Nathan Juran produced Charles H. Schneer technical effects Ray Harryhausen\n\nVehicle: a very large U.S. “air-ship”, a XY-21, single-stage “astro-propelled” rocket crewed by 17 men, built like a space plane, crashes into the sea at the beginning of the film. For its brief appearance, it’s awesome — another Harryhausen creation.\n\nThe ship has visited Venus (whose closest approach to Earth is indeed about 20 million miles), but gets plugged by a “meteor”.\n\nAlien: a Venus-creature, looks like a cross between a T. Rex and a man (with a sort of fish’s dorsal fin on it head), craves sulfur as food, and grows really, really fast. It’s a wonderful Harryhausen creation. Sounds like a cross between an elephant trumpeting and a man hollering.\n\nBrave Sicilian fishermen try to save the crew of the sinking craft, and bring two out. One is Calder; the other is the mortally injured Dr. Sharman. Later, Pepe finds a canister washed up on the beach. Its contents, a blob of translucent gel, later comes into the hands of Dr. Leonardo. The creature emerges as a baby from the gel blob, and the doctor and his granddaughter nurture it.\n\nVenus’ atmosphere is lethal, even with what they thought to be fool-proof breathing equipment. But they found valuable minerals, and the government needs the creature, in order to determine how to survive the atmosphere.\n\nMost people treat the creature very poorly, of course: they cage him, shoot him, and electrify him. This film does nothing further regarding setup, but to revisit the end of King Kong. (Nonetheless, the creature lives on in many famous images of its Roman rampage, knocking over recognizable tourist destinations.)\n\nReally great performances: especially the Sicilian kid, Pepe, who wants nothing more than a hat from Texas. Generally, the Sicilians play their parts very sensitively and colorfully, certainly better than the stiff Washingtonians or the stock space captain. The obligatory romantic angle between the captain and Ms. Leonardo begins with fun sparks, although it has of course nowhere to go. And Harryhausen’s creature is superbly sympathetic. It emotes, it exudes body language.\n\nQuote:\n\n“Why is it always, always so costly, for man to move from the present to the future?”\n\nParables:\n\nWe must go to space, for the valuable minerals.\n\nWe must save the life of the space creature, for the valuable minerals (and also science).\n\nAlpha male, girl — hurry!

Scientists think it’s an asteroid, even when looking right at a picture that shows a clearly artificial object. The Army tries to blow it up with nuclear guided missiles, to no avail. It splashes splendidly into the Pacific.\n\nRobot: The saucer deposits a huge metal robot (referred to as a “monster”) on the beach. It consists of two boxes with a dome on the top one, and four cylindrical pillars that it uses for locomotion, in a stomping fashion. It is at least very strange, and even other-worldly, and is the best thing in this flick. Unfortunately, while as some points it takes on a sense of gigantic scale, at other points this sense is quite lost.\n\nComputer: SUSIE “Synchro Unifying Sinometric Integrating Equitensor”, a big bank of boxes with tape reels and dials, equipped with a buzzer and bells that make it sound like a pinball machine. Vera says: “SUSIE gets a lot more affection than I do”, and taps a few ciggie ashes on her.\n\nOther gadgets: a glowing ball infests people with an “incubus” that controls their behavior, as well as that of the monster.\n\nScientists hang out in Mexican house, where they make much fun of the spiciness of the cuisine. There is a brave but ineffectual Mexican Air Force attack.\n\nNice film clips of White Sands V-2 tests, including lots of factory shots. A B-47 StratoJet carrying a nuke gets sucked in to the monster, who absorbs the full blast of the nuke only to become stronger. F100 Super Sabre used as transport plane.\n\nParables:\n\nDon’t use up all your resources!\n\nThe aliens want our stuff\n\nGirl gets scientist by being patient.\n\nInvasion of the Saucer Men\n\n1957 American International\n\n− evil space alien attempt at comedy\n\nB&W\n\ndirected Edward Cahn produced James H.

Kinda cool, briefly.\n\nAliens: “little green men”, bloat headed, cat-eyed, no more than 4′ tall; parts can disassemble and reassemble grotesquely, hands have their own eyes, and venous fingers extend hypodermic needles that inject pure alcohol; react badly to bright light.\n\nHas fun with the usual shtick of the Army covering up UFO sightings. Then there are the teens making out and talking cool, and the farmer who likes to threaten townsfolk with his gun.\n\nQuotes:\n\n“Johnny, get me away from here!”\n\n“Colonel, did it ever occur to you that there might be other units just like ours, covering up other things?”\n\nThe 27th Day\n\n1957 ROMSON\n\nOK aliens give humanity a choice\n\nB&W\n\nproduced Helen Ainsworth directed William Ascher novel, screenplay John Mantley dir. photography Henry Freulich music conductor Mischa Bakaleinikoff\n\nGene Barry as Jonathan Clark Valerie French as Eve Wingate George Voskovec as Prof. Klaus Bechner Arnold Moss the alien Stevan Schnabel Soviet general Ralph Clanton as Mr. Ingram Frederick Ledebur as Dr. Karl Neuhaus Paul Birch admiral Azemat Janti as Ivan Godofsky Marie Tsien as Su Tan Theodore Marcuse as Col. Gregor Paul Frees announcer\n\nVehicle: a flying saucer, which is familiar because it came directly from Earth vs the Flying Saucers. Its interior decoration is quite stylish.\n\nAlien: looks just like a person.\n\nThe alien politely abducts five people from random parts of the world, to play a deadly sort of game with them. He declares: “My name is of no importance.” Later, he reconsiders and takes control of the narrative, proposing that they call him “the alien.”\n\nHe indulges in science-nonsense paraphrases: “You are traveling at almost exactly the speed of light. At such as speed, time as you know it does not exist.” (Guy looks at his watch. It has stopped! Wow! Einstein was right!)\n\nSure enough, the alien is planning an invasion, for the usual reasons: “The Universe in which my world exists, is dying. Soon our sun will be going into nova, and explode.”\n\nThe alien gives each abductee a terrible weapon, with which they can wipe out human life. They’re to play a game, to see if they’re worthy of being spared. The aliens “expect disaster.”\n\nEach of the abductees reacts to the situation differently. This is where the script shows a little sophistication. There is a mystery to be solved.\n\nThe story is explicitly multinational, but the cast is strongly Caucasian-centered. The one Chinese abductee quickly removes herself, leaving only Caucasians. One black waiter appears. And that’s the end of the multi-racialism.\n\nA romance, under the circumstances, is forced and clumsy.\n\nThe Soviet general is a typical evil character. He bungles his dastardly plan, and a smart professor proves even more dastardly. Unfortunately, no explanation appears for what the professor did.\n\nTurns out, anybody who is “known to have been a confirmed enemy of human freedom” is in trouble. It’s disappointing the authors make such a facile distinction between good people and bad ones, and echo the hysteria of the times.\n\nThe film ends with people doing something as noble as it is anticlimactic.\n\nThe story had a couple of good ideas, but suffered from poor attention to physical details, and worse, from naive, popular politics.\n\nQuotes:\n\nThe professor:\n\n“in mathematics, there is always a solution.”\n\nThe Soviet general observes:\n\n“democracies are appeasers.”\n\nParable:\n\nIf you’re known to be, or have been, a confirmed enemy of human freedom, the aliens are gonna get you!\n\nДорога к Звёздам\n\n[Road to the Stars]\n\n1957 Lennauchfilm\n\n+ space educational film\n\nB&W\n\nRussian\n\nwrote Борис Ляпунов (Boris Lyapunov),\n\nВасилий Соловьёв (Vacily Soloviov) directed Павел Клушанцев (Pavel Klushantsev)\n\nГеоргий Соловьёв (Georgy Soloviov) as Konstantin Tsiolkovsky\n\nThis is a Soviet educational film, intended to convey fact, albeit perhaps projected fact. Does that qualify as sci-fi?\n\nThe production includes acted scenes, animations and models, all of high quality.\n\nThe first half re-enacts stories of Tsiolkovsky and Goddard, etc. and explains the basics of orbital dynamics and rocket flight. The second half depicts possible future space travel.\n\nShows a 3-stage manned rocket flight. Depicts acceleration stress on astronauts (not in pressure suits) (joyous) weightlessness, space-walking (on the surface of the ship).\n\nThe last part shows a very nice space station, and all the wonderful things that people get up to in there, showing living quarters, workers doing their jobs. Inside views include curved floors and gardens.\n\nCrews include female cosmonauts and scientists, of different nationalities, and a feline cosmonaut as well.\n\nFinally, the film uses models to depict a Moon base, and paintings to depict colonies of other planets. A Moon landing plays out using actors, who demonstrate appropriate glee at being the first to walk on the Moon.\n\nThe Monolith Monsters\n\n1957 Universal International\n\nOK crystalline alien disaster/horror\n\nB&W\n\nstory by Jack Arnold,\n\nRobert M. Fresco screenplay Norman Jolley,\n\nRobert M. Fresco produced Howard Christie directed John Sherwood dir. photography Ellis W. Carter special photography Clifford Stine music supervision Joseph Gershenson\n\nThe narrated intro provides a little science lesson about meteors.\n\nAliens: the “monoliths” — not clear they’re animal or mineral or what — only that they came from a meteorite. This is the best part of the film. The one special effect is fairly convincingly done (within context). Huge crystals (whatever) loom over the landscape, then fall over, and we see new forests of crystals grow out of those.\n\nThe main science is high school chemistry. It’s a bit over-done, but it fits. The science of weather forecasting also plays a crucial but uncertain role, and gets due representation in a little gem of a performance by Schallert.\n\nMost of the acting is standard ’50s TV fare. Albright’s performance is particularly poor.\n\nIt would have been a medium-length short story, but it’s drawn out to make a feature film. The plot is a mess, involving cute little kids, a romance that goes nowhere, a brave geologist, a brave newspaperman, a brave doctor, and a brave scientist. The actors really didn’t have a chance. It gets especially drab the last quarter of the film, where five people stand in a line and make verbal observations explaining what we’re seeing in the separate special effects scenes, and struggle to demonstrate how one might react to such sights.\n\nIt is charming for all that, and the special effects quite eerie. If nothing else, its monsters are different (possibly unique) in sci-fi film.\n\n地球防衛軍 (Chikyū Bōeigun)\n\nlit. “Earth Defense Force”\n\na.k.a. "
