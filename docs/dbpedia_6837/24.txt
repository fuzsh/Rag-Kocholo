— About halfway through "The Real Right Stuff," the new National Geographic documentary now on Disney+ soars past the stories told by the eight-episode series for which it serves as a companion.

"The Real Right Stuff," directed and produced by filmmaker Tom Jennings, offers archival footage and an original orchestral score in place of the actors and set pieces that comprise "The Right Stuff" docudrama. Both, though, share a common heritage: journalist Tom Wolfe's 1979 account of the NASA's first spacemen, the Mercury 7 astronauts.

Jennings, who previously directed the similar narration-free documentary "Apollo: Missions to the Moon" also for National Geographic, returns to the cinéma vérité format in "The Real Right Stuff" to transport viewers back to the 1950s and 1960s as the race between the U.S. and the former Soviet Union quickly advanced from launching artificial satellites to sending the first humans out of the atmosphere.
