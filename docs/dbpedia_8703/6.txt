Birds of a Feather is returning for a second series after the ITV remake of the comedy proved a hit with audiences.

The show - in which Pauline Quirke and Linda Robson play sisters sharing a home in the posh Essex town of Chigwell after their husbands were sent to prison - was launched 25 years ago but was axed by the BBC in 1998.

It was revived by ITV last year for a further run, which was written by the original creators Laurence Marks and Maurice Gran with some of its original cast, including Quirke, Robson and Lesley Joseph as their man-eater friend Dorien Green.

The revival proved a hit, pulling in average audiences of eight million, and filming on the second series starts this year.

Gran said: “We're delighted Birds of a Feather was such a success on ITV and really pleased to be asked to write another series. We hope the further adventures of Sharon, Tracey and Dorien will continue to thrill audiences young and old.”

ITV's Director of Comedy and Entertainment Elaine Bedell said: “ We're very pleased that the brilliant chemistry between these three great actresses once again attracted the large and loyal audience that Birds of a Feather deserves. The writers and producers have done a fantastic job in making the show feel funny, fresh and relevant.”
