        "text": "“Birds of a Feather” (2014-2020)\n\nComedy\n\nTwenty-four episodes\n\nCreated by Laurence Marks and Maurice Gran\n\nFeaturing: Lesley Joseph, Pauline Quirke and Linda Robson\n\nDorien Green: “Good afternoon, neighbours.”\n\nSharon Theodopolopoudos: “It was, up until now.”\n\nDorien Green: “Now, now, Sharon. Fat people are supposed to be jolly; it’s a tradition.”\n\nReleased this month on DVD is the first three seasons of the ITV comedy “Birds of a Feather” (2014-2020) which sees the three returning characters from the original series that aired on the BBC from 1989 through to 1998. The original series was never really considered to be a classic comedy it did have something quite unique in that the three leads were all women with most of the plots centred squarely around them. With the three actresses, Lesley Joseph, Pauline Quirke and Linda Robson, now in their sixties face different issues than their younger days which at this time of life could be something unique on television.\n\nGenerally “Birds of a Feather” is based around Cockney sisters Sharon Theodopolopodous and Tracey Stubbs, life is never the same again when their husbands are convicted of armed robbery and sent to prison. Sharon, a common, fun-loving, large and loud-mouthed character from a council flat in Edmonton, moves into her sister’s luxury home in Chigwell, so that she can support Tracey, after her husband’s imprisonment.\n\nThere is nothing new in bringing back decades old television shows to new audiences, it happens with ore regularity as space needs to be taken up on not only traditional broadcasters but also on streaming services, whether or not they work is another matter, the most successful reboots or returning shows are those that bring back original stars but also add new ones to fill out casts as well as updating narratives and plots. So we now see gender swapped reboots and limited runs of other series, however with “Birds of a Feather” they have been lucky enough to have the three original stars return as well as being in very good condition so that older audiences will recognise them but with enough new blood so that newer audiences can feel like they are discovering something new.\n\nNow there is no doubt at all that with all returning shows there is an aim to touch the nostalgia button especially to bring in older audiences and although in some cases that can means rehashing old jokes and making a broad show which for comedies can be the kiss of death as the funny elements can be cheap and lowest common denominator humour for “Birds of a Feather” it seems to work meaning the nostalgia that is present is not a bad thing at all. In fact with the ageing of the three main actors this old fashioned humour becomes part of the narrative which works well at least on a first watch.\n\n“Birds of a Feather” even in its heyday was never going to be in its prime a show that was rated as a great show or timeless and so this new series does not have to measure itself against some great institution which is a good thing as too many returning shows with long absences are unfairly measured against their own legacies, the two seasons of the returned “X-Files” (1993-2018) is one of those. So “Birds of a Feather” arrives and does a good job for what it is, a light entertainment that has its laughs and some relevant stories that are for all intents and purposes very entertaining.\n\nEpisodes\n\nSeries One\n\nGimme Shelter: Sharon’s living back in her council flat and Tracey’s still in Chigwell with younger son Travis… but what’s become of Dorien? What can bring the Birds back together?
