        "text": "It has been 16 years since Birds of a Feather was on BBC1, but the Essex-based sitcom proved its enduring appeal when it returned in its new home on ITV with nearly 8 million viewers on Thursday night.\n\nThe comedy, created by Laurence Marks and Maurice Gran and starring Pauline Quirke, Linda Robson and Lesley Joseph, had an average of 7.8 million viewers, a 31.9% share, between 8.30pm and 9pm on Thursday.\n\nIt is understood to be ITV's best-performing sitcom since Gwen Taylor comedy Barbara was watched by more 8 million viewers in 2000.\n\nIts audience matched the 7.8 million who watched the EastEnders special on Christmas Day, and it was only a shade below the 8.3 million who saw Matt Smith regenerate into Peter Capaldi in the Christmas Doctor Who.\n\nDespite returning to a world very different from the one it left - The Only Way is Essex, anyone? - the show retained its appeal among older viewers, making it ITV's most popular show of the day.\n\nThere was plenty for ITV to smile about in Thursday's ratings. It had another 6.6 million viewers (26.8%) for the return of its sun and sangria comedy Benidorm, now into its sixth series.\n\nBoth shows had the better of BBC1, with documentary Dolphin – Spys in the Pod watched by 4.9 million viewers, a 20.4% share between 8pm and 9pm, and the return of long-running drama Silent Witness seen by 6.1 million viewers (24.6%) between 9pm and 10pm.\n\nComedy has been no laughing matter for ITV in recent years, but its director of television, Peter Fincham, has made it a priority with new shows last year including the Ian McKellen and Derek Jacobi sitcom Vicious and The Job Lot.\n\nNeither show was an unqualified success, but both will return, The Job Lot changing channels to ITV2.\n\nBirds of a Feather originally aired on BBC1 from 1989 to 1998, and critics suggested the intervening years would not be kind to the sitcom, once nominated for a Bafta.\n\nClarkson's back. So's the Restoration Man\n\nJeremy Clarkson left Top Gear behind to present the second world war documentary PQ17: An Arctic Convoy Disaster, which was watched by 2.3 million viewers, a 9.1% share, between 9pm and 10pm.\n\nIt had the better of Channel 4's My Big Fat Gypsy Holiday, which had 1.7 million viewers (7%), also between 9pm and 10pm.\n\nClarkson's documentary was followed by the BBC2 sitcom Rab C Nesbitt, with 1.9 million viewers, a 9.6% share between 10pm and 10.45pm.\n\nIt also beat Channel 4, where con artist investigation Secrets of the Scammers had 1.6 million viewers (8.3%) between 10pm and 10.50pm.\n\nChannel 4's The Restoration Man was back for a fourth series with 1.6 million viewers, a 6.9% share, between 8pm and 9pm.\n\nIt narrowly had the better of a Best of Top Gear repeat – him again! – on BBC2, which had 1.5 million viewers (6.4%).\n\nA theme emerged across a Channel 5 night of programming that included Got Thin, Got Fat Again!, 50 Shocking Facts about Diet and Exercise and Fat for Cash.\n\nIts most popular programme was Too Fat To Fly, with 1.1 million viewers (4.5%) between 8pm and 9pm. Well, it is new year.\n\nAll ratings are Barb overnight figures, including live, +1 (except for BBC channels) and same day timeshifted (recorded) viewing, but excluding on demand, or other – unless otherwise stated. Figures for BBC1, BBC2, ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5 generally include ratings for their HD simulcast services, unless otherwise stated\n\nTo contact the MediaGuardian news desk email media@theguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.
