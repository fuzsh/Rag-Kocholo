        "text": "Post by Chris W on\n\nYep I know that this thread is more than 6 months old, however this week I came across a decent railway book in one of those bargain bookshops that exist in most shopping centres; Tracks to Disaster by Adrian Vaughan. In it, twenty railway incidents are examined, starting at Moorgate in February 1975 & ending with Ladbroke Grove in October 1999 (incl. the Kings Cross fire of 1986).\n\nThe review of Moorgate makes very interesting reading in that the author does not rely on speculation, but instead picks at the evidence (much as a court would do as witnessed by anyone who has attended jury service) – I’ll briefly run through it:\n\nLine/Station Geography:\n\nThere is a slight gradient from Old Street heading south to Moorgate (1 in 150), which levels out well before the cross-over tracks prior to entering platforms 9 & 10 of Moorgate station\n\nOverall limit of 40mph on the line with a permanent limit of 15mph before entering Moorgate station\n\nThe points were controlled by the Moorgate signalman, with the signals dating to 1937, and electro-pneumatic stop devices connected to the stop signals to prevent trains from entering an already occupied platform\n\nTrain/Unit:\n\nTwo 3-car 38ts units (service 272) was 316ft in length/weighed 151 tons\n\nThe cars had little structural strength due to number/size of doors\n\nTrain Staff:\n\nMotorman Newson:\n\n56 years old, employed by LT since 1969.\n\nWorked as a guard based at Barking until Jan 74, when passed as Guard-Motorman. Had 6 days experience driving 38ts on ELL & 31 days of C69 stock on the Met as it was then, prior to 1975.\n\nIn Jan 75 transferred to Drayton Park as a Motorman\n\nDescribed by Motorman Deadman (Newson’s driving instructor) as quiet, without much conversation and a cautious driver often breaking sooner than other drivers when entering platforms (this assessment was confirmed by Guard Catney, who had working with Newson since 1973)\n\nBetween 23 Jan – 15 Feb 75 Motorman Newson drove into Moorgate (platforms 9/10) 228 times – platform 10 closed after 15 Feb and up until the incident he had driven in 121 times\n\nReported to be ‘cheerful’ and in ‘good spirits’ on the day of the accident\n\nGuard Harris:\n\n18 years old and an inexperienced guard\n\nThe Accident:\n\nNewson had already made 3 round trips fro Drayton Park to Moorgate, commencing the forth from Drayton Park at 8:39am\n\nAfter shutting off power to coast and instead of breaking prior to entering Moorgate at 15mph, Newson instead put the controller into ‘full series’, halving power and allowed the train to accelerate\n\nGuard Harris, had started to look for a newspaper in the 6th/last car when he became aware that the train was not slowing down – due to his location he was unable to apply the emergency brake prior to the accident\n\nThe Guard, passengers and two platform staff judged the speed of the train through the platform to be between 30-40mph (one passenger judged that it took 7-9 seconds to travel though the 382ft platform) - platform staff realised that the train was travelling too fast and also noted the noise it was making.\n\nPlatform witnesses (staff & passengers) claim that Motorman Newson was sat upright, staring ahead, hat on head looking forwards, with right hand on the dead man’s handle and left arm reaching out towards the left pillar – same claimed his posture was ‘frozen’ (Newson’s hands were found still on the controls when his body was found/reached 4 days after the accident – he had NOT tried to protect himself with his arms/hands during impact)\n\nThe train hit the stop lamp and sand drag at the end of platform 9 entering the 97ft tunnel at the end of the platform, then striking the (by then) disused hydraulic buffer, the force of which caused the DM body to lift off the bogie and impact in the wall/roof of the tunnel end. The impact cause the under frame to buckle in a /\\/ formation with the 2nd car driving underneath the first – I will not describe the graphic nature of the accident further\n\n300 passengers were on the train, of which 42 were killed, 74 injured (last of which were released from the wreckage at 10.05pm on the day of the accident)\n\nThe accident occurred at 8:46am, with the first call for the emergency services made at 8:48am.\n\nEvidence:\n\nPost mortem results:\n\nTests on Motorman Newson’s body concluded that death was caused by ‘shock from multiple injuries’ – he was healthy, with no abnormalities of the brain or heart.\n\nNo evidence of drugs were found or alcohol damage to the liver.\n\nAlcohol - evidence of alcohol consumption was voiced based upon examined blood samples from Newson (perhaps consumed on the morning of the accident) – up to 80 milligrams per 100 millilitres of blood at the time of the post mortem – this opinion was reached after considering the rate of decay/decomposition in the heated conditions prior to Newson’s body being recovered 4 days after the accident\n\nA container of sour milk was found, which belonged to Newson and in it 0.1% of alcohol was identified.\n\nA further doctor examined these findings (requested by Newson’s widow) and agreed that alcohol had been consumed, but could not confirm whether the consumption had been on the day of the accident or not – also commented that decomposing milk can generate up to 0.2% alcohol – in conclusion the port mortem examiner (Professor Simpson) concluded to up to 80mg per 100 ml may be as a result of decomposition in heated conditions\n\nArguments:\n\nAlcohol – assuming Motorman Newson had consumed alcohol prior to the accident, was this a factor/cause (even a contributory factor) of the accident? (no work colleagues reported that they had witnessed Newson drinking on duty – his upright posture immediately prior to the impact would appear to confirm this).\n\nDaydreaming –would the noise of the train/shaking at high speed/impact not have woken Newson to at least the point of protecting himself at the point of impact, if not before.\n\nSuicide – Newson had £270 in his coat pocket, with which he was going to buy his daughter a car after work that day – his general positive demeanour also confirms that suicide would be an unlikely cause\n\nA Dr Raffles (had a lifelong professional interest in factors which prevent a persons capacity from performing a role) approached the Inspecting Officer and voiced a theory that the cause was a tiny blood clot forming in the central brain causing the muscles to freeze – unfortunately Newson’s brain was no longer available to be examined when this theory was put forward.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThe incident resulted in improvements with trip cocks added along the platform length to prevent trains from accelerating into the station (the article is ambiguous whether this was introduced at all LU termini). This branch of the Northern Line was closed shortly afterwards and became part of the British Rail Eastern Region served by EMU’s.\n\nThe incident remains (one would assume will always be) unexplained and is open for speculation.\n\nPost by tubeprune on\n\nI knew Leslie Newsom slightly and I was involved in the enquiry's technical review of train braking. He was, as all have said, quiet, cautious and well intentioned. Most likely, he ran out of railway. It nearly happened to me twice. I got halfway into the platform before realising I had forgotten to start braking. On the first occasion, I was at Preston Road on the down slow and realised I was never going to stop. It was dark and wet and I knew I'd never be able to stop in the platform. I just carried on. My guard yelled down the phone at me, \"Are you going to stop at Northwick Park?\" \"Oh well yeah OK, might as well.\" I replied as nonchalantly as possible, knowing he was getting a whole load of flak from the punters, since the exit at Preston Road is at the rear of the train and it was 17:30.\n\nOn the way back from Watford, I was met at WPk by the DI who said, \"Did you have any trouble at Preston Road, driver?\"\n\n\"No Guv.\" said I.\n\n\"Oh\" he said, \"I had a report you didn't stop there on the down.\"\n\n\"That's right\" I said.\n\n\"I thought you said you didn't have any trouble.\"\n\n\"I didn't. It was the punters who had the trouble. I forgot to stop and they all had to go on to Northwick Park and get one back\" I responded.\n\n\"Oh, OK\" he says \"You though you were on the fast road, it being dark and wet an' all\"\n\n\"Yes\" says I, thinking \"Thanks Guv.\"\n\n\"Be more careful next time\" he says.\n\n\"Thanks Guv\" says I.\n\nThe second time was at Charing Cross (Embankment now) on a Circle. Good job it has a 9 car platform. I coshed it and just stopped before the starter.\n\nAs soon as I heard about Moorgate I thought, \"Poor B*****d ran out of railway. He forgot to stop and thought he could carry on to the next station\".\n\nThere but for the grace of God go I....."
