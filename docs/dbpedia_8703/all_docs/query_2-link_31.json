        "text": "The title quotation is extraordinarily famous: it comes from 20:17 of the Gospel of John, part of the New Testament, and is Jesus’s response to Mary Magdalene when she encounters him outside his tomb after his resurrection. The translation from the Latin is Touch me not. It can also be found in Sir Thomas Wyatt’s famed Tudor-era poem Whoso list to hunt (a close copy of Petrarch), as well as a painting by Titian. The phrase was used to refer to cancer of the eyelids, and Rizal – a medical student – chose it because it symbolised the people’s blindness to the misdeeds of the ruling Spanish government.\n\nShe says this when encountering new arrivals to her island for the first time in her life, and the ‘savage’ John repeats it when gazing at the corrupt, hedonistic society portrayed in Huxley’s 1932 novel. Huxley was a big fan of Shakespeare and quoted him in two more famous book titles, namely Tomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow (1956) and Mortal Coils (1921), from Macbeth and Hamlet respectively. Both are part of famous soliloquies; Hamlet’s in particular is the ‘to be or not to be’ speech.\n\nTomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow,\n\nCreeps in this petty pace from day to day,\n\nTo the last syllable of recorded time;\n\nAnd all our yesterdays have lighted fools\n\nThe way to dusty death. —Macbeth, Act V Scene V\n\nFor in that sleep of death, what dreams may come,\n\nWhen we have shuffled off this mortal coil,\n\nMust give us pause. —Hamlet, Act III Scene I\n\nSince I love Ernest Dowson so much, I feel impelled to point out that the particular phrase ‘things fall apart’ was not invented by Yeats himself. He took it from a Dowson poem of the 1890s entitled Quid non speremus, amantes? This quotation from Virgil can be translated as What may we lovers not hope for?\n\nNay! She is gone, and all things fall apart;\n\nOr she is cold, and vainly have we prayed;\n\nAnd broken is the summer’s splendid heart,\n\nAnd hope within a deep, dark grave is laid.\n\nThe 1960 sequel to Achebe’s novel also has a literary title; No Longer at Ease is taken from T.S. Eliot’s 1927 The Journey of the Magi.\n\nWe returned to our places, these Kingdoms,\n\nBut no longer at ease here, in the old dispensation,\n\nWith an alien people clutching their gods.\n\nI should be glad of another death."
