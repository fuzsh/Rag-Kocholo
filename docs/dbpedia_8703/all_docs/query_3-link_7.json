        "text": "Who is Billie Eilish's 'Birds of a Feather' about? The stunning track is Billie's first proper love song.\n\n'Birds of a Feather' is quickly becoming a fan fave Billie Eilish song and the meaning behind the lyrics will make you tear up.\n\nBefore releasing her new album 'Hit Me Hard And Soft', Billie teased several snippets from the project. She debuted a clip of 'Chihiro' on Apple Music and played clips of 'Lunch' and 'L'Amour De Ma Vie' at Coachella. Not only that but she teased a segment of 'Birds of a Feather' in the Heartstopper season 3 teaser and fans have been obsessed with it ever since.\n\nNow, 'Birds of a Feather' is here and it's Billie's most romantic song yet. What are Billie's 'Birds of a Feather' lyrics about though and who inspired it? Here's a full breakdown of the story behind 'Birds of a Feather' and what the lyrics mean.\n\nRead more: Billie Eilish Fans Think Her 'Wildflower' Lyrics Are About Devon Lee Carlson And Jesse Rutherford\n\nWhat are Billie Eilish's 'Birds of a Feather' lyrics about?\n\nThe title of 'Birds of a Feather' is based on the British proverb \"birds of a feather flock together\". It simply means that people with the same interests and tastes naturally find each other and congregate. In the song, Billie sings about falling so in love with someone that she wants to \"stick together\" like birds of a feather. It's Billie at her most emotionally vulnerable.\n\nIn the first verse, Billie reveals that she wants to be with the person the song is about forever. She sings: I want you to stay / 'Til I'm in the grave / 'Til I rot away, dead and buried / 'Til I'm in the casket you carry / If you go, I'm goin' too, uh / 'Cause it was always you (Alright) / And if I'm turnin' blue, please don't save me / Nothin' left to lose without my baby.\n\nBillie then explains that she's so in love that it brings her to tears: And I don't know what I'm cryin' for / I don't think I could love you more / It might not be long, but baby, I / I'll love you 'til the day that I die / 'Til the day that I die.\n\nBillie later begs her lover not to end things singing: But you're so full of shit, uh . Tell me it's a bit, oh / Say you don't see it, your mind's polluted / Say you wanna quit, don't be stupid.\n\nDiscussing the last 'Til the day that I die' ad-lib with Apple Music, Billie said: \"That's the highest I've ever belted in my life. I'm so proud of that.\"\n\nWho is Billie Eilish's 'Birds of a Feather' about?\n\nSome fans have guessed that 'Birds of a Feather' was written about Billie's relationship with The Neighbourhood star Jesse Rutherford as it was her last high-profile relationship. However, Billie is yet to open up about who specifically inspired the song.\n\nIn fact, Billie has told Rolling Stone that the songs on 'Hit Me Hard And Soft' are inspired by multiple people. She explained: \"Happier Than Ever was low-key about one person, and this album is about a lot of different situations.\"\n\nAs for dating at the moment, Billie joked: \"I plan on never dating again. That’s not true, obviously. But no, I don’t see myself being serious with anyone until I find someone that really feels right to me.\"\n\nShe also confirmed she's on good terms with Jesse saying: \"That’s my guy, truly one of my favourite people in the world\".\n\nLike all great love songs, it doesn't matter who 'Birds of a Feather' was written about. It's for the listener to decide.\n\nBillie Eilish - 'Birds of a Feather' lyrics\n\nINTRO\n\n(I want you to stay)\n\nVERSE 1\n\nI want you to stay\n\n'Til I'm in the grave\n\n'Til I rot away, dead and buried\n\n'Til I'm in the casket you carry\n\nIf you go, I'm goin' too, uh\n\n'Cause it was always you (Alright)\n\nAnd if I'm turnin' blue, please don't save me\n\nNothin' left to lose without my baby\n\nREFRAIN\n\nBirds of a feather, we should stick together, I know\n\nI said I'd never think I wasn't better alone\n\nCan't change the weather, might not be forever\n\nBut if it's forever, it's even better\n\nPRE-CHORUS\n\nAnd I don't know what I'm cryin' for\n\nI don't think I could love you more\n\nIt might not be long, but baby, I\n\nCHORUS\n\nI'll love you 'til the day that I die\n\n'Til the day that I die\n\n'Til the light leaves my eyes\n\n'Til the day that I die\n\nVERSE 2\n\nI want you to see, hmm\n\nHow you look to me, hmm\n\nYou wouldn't believe if I told ya\n\nYou would keep the compliments I throw ya\n\nBut you're so full of shit, uh\n\nTell me it's a bit, oh\n\nSay you don't see it, your mind's polluted\n\nSay you wanna quit, don't be stupid\n\nPRE-CHORUS\n\nAnd I don't know what I'm cryin' for\n\nI don't think I could love you more\n\nMight not be long, but baby, I\n\nDon't wanna say goodbye\n\nCHORUS\n\nBirds of a feather, we should stick together, I know ('Til the day that I die)\n\nI said I'd never think I wasn't better alone ('Til the light leaves my eyes)\n\nCan't change the weather, might not be forever ('Til the day that I die)\n\nBut if it's forever, it's even better\n\nPOST-CHORUS\n\nI knew you in another life\n\nYou had that same look in your eyes I love you, don't act so surprised\n\nRead more Billie Eilish news here:\n\nBillie Eilish Hit Me Hard And Soft Tour: Ticket Prices, Presale And Dates\n\nIs Billie Eilish's New Album ‘Hit Me Hard And Soft’ A Double Album?\n\nBillie Eilish Explains The Deeper Meaning Behind Her 'Chihiro' Lyrics\n\nBillie Eilish Says She's Only Just \"Figuring Out\" Her Sexuality Now\n\nBillie Eilish Reveals The Real Meaning Behind Her 'Lunch' Lyrics"
