        "text": "They're the partners in punchline, the faces behind the funny, the writing team responsible for some of the best loved TV sitcoms of the last few decades.\n\nFrom Birds of A Feather, the show that put Chigwell in Essex on the comedy map, to Rik Mayall’s outrageous Tory-spoofing The New Statesman and Goodnight Sweetheart, the long-running romcom that took Rodney Trotter out of Peckham and reinvented as a time-travelling TV repairman, the names Laurence Marks and Maurice Gran have become synonymous with comedy gold.\n\nAnd now the duo have taken a break from ticking our collective funnybones to get our feet tapping with a follow-up to their hugely popular, rock ‘n’ roll jukebox stage musical Dreamboats and Petticoats from 2009, a swinging ‘60s sequel entitled Dreamboats and Miniskirts.\n\nBut while the former’s tale of a group of music-loving teens in pursuit of stardom and love (accompanied by killer hits from Roy Orbison and Billy Fury) proved box office dynamite, ...Miniskirts is far removed from simply trying to rehash past successes.\n\nMoreover, it became a way from Marks and Gran to telling the story of what it was like to have grown up in the middle of a cultural revolution.\n\n“We wanted to project onto the audience what it was like to be young and in love in the 1960s,” says Marks, adding that he and Gran had tried to capture the excitement and immediacy of that golden age.\n\n“Nobody really knew what was going to happen next – overnight clubs were springing up around the country where people could dance the night away.\n\n“Suddenly you could be regarded as an old fogey for wearing last week’s style.”\n\nSet in 1963, two years after the original production, Dreamboats and Miniskirts revisits the characters from the first time around and finds that, while the world might have changed irrevocably with the arrival of The Beatles, not a lot has changed elsewhere.\n\nTeenage song-writing duo Bobby and Laura have only half made it in showbiz, Norman and Sue have settled down to non-marital bliss – and a baby, while Ray and Donna remain the picture of cosy coupledom.\n\nHowever, the sonic and cultural revolution kicked started by the Fab Four from Merseyside inspires Bobby and Laura to have one more shot at stardom, Norman to quit his job working on the city’s drains” and set his sights on making the hit parade and Ray to realise his ambition and manage a really top pop act.\n\nWith killer soundtrack featuring Roy Orbison (Pretty Woman), The Beach Boys (I Get Around) and Hippy Hippy Shake by John, Paul, George and Ringo – not to mention hip-shaking numbers from such the lesser known acts as The Marvellettes and The Kingsmen – Dream boats and Miniskirts is guaranteed to make you laugh and want to dance at the same time.\n\nAnd if you can’t wait until next week to pick up your tickets, here’s out selection of some of Marks and Gran’s other greatest hits to get you in the mood...\n\nShine On Harvey Moon\n\nThis sepia-tinged, wistfully nostalgic Friday night fare always seemed to be on during the ‘80s.\n\nA bittersweet comedy drama, it made a star of Kenneth Cranham in the title roll as a discharged Tommy struggling with returning to civvie street after WWII.\n\nIt’s other star Linda Robson and Pauline Quirke would later return to work with Marks and Gran again on Birds Of A Feather.\n\nThe New Statesman\n\nSpitting Image’s latex Tory buffoonery made flesh, this broad but scathing political satire gave Rik Mayall his greatest scenery-chewing role as the scheming Conservative MP Alan B’stard.\n\nLike a sociopathic Yes, Prime Minister with added sex, scandal and swearing.\n\nBirds of a Feather\n\n“What’ll do when you are far away?” went the theme tune, carving out a place in the hearts of every one who grew up looking for laughs in the dog days of Thatcher’s reign.\n\nQuirke and Robson played Essex housewives trying to make ends meet after their respective partners get banged up for dodgy dealing, mirroring the moral bankruptcy which coat-tailed the ‘me, me ,me’ ethos of that boom era.\n\nGoodnight Sweetheart\n\nDisaffected TV repairman discovers and porthole in time that alows hism to carry on with two diffeernt women in two very different eras - the ‘90s and the war-torn ‘40s.\n\nHardly your everyday sitcom plot, this high concept effort helped Nicholas Lyndhurst escape the shadow of Rodney Trotter and still holds the honour of being the only comedy to feature The Beatles, Adolf Hitler and Jack The Ripper."
