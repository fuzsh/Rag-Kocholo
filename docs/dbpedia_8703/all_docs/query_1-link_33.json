        "text": "Birds of a Feather pulled in nearly 8 million viewers for new home ITV last night as the Essex-based sitcom returned to TV screens after 16 years.\n\nCreated by Laurence Marks and Maurice Gran, an average of 7.8 million viewers - a 31.9% share – tuned in between 8.30pm and 9pm.\n\nIt is believed to be ITV's best-performing sitcom since Barbara was watched by more 8 million in 2000.\n\nThe sitcom , which originally ran on the BBC from 1989 to 1998, starred Pauline Quirke and Linda Robson as sisters sharing a mansion in the upmarket town of Chigwell after their husbands were sent to prison.\n\nLesley Joseph also returned as man-eater neighbour Dorien.\n\nThe reported ratings match the 7.8 million who tuned in for the Christmas Day episode of EastEnders – and was only just under the 8.3 million who watched Matt Smith regenerate into Peter Capaldi in the festive Doctor Who special The Time of The Doctor.\n\nITV also had another 6.6 million viewers for the sixth series return of Benidorm."
