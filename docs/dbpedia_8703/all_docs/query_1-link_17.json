        "text": "A stage adaptation, like a film adaptation, of a television series typically seeks to enhance or expand the appeal of its source material, while offering audiences familiarity.\n\nAnd in the latter sense Birds Of A Feather is a success. Through innuendo, light crassness and mild class warfare Pauline Quirke, Linda Robson and Lesley Joseph, reprising their roles as Sharon Theodopolopoudos, Tracey Stubbs and Dorien Green respectively, skirt the highlights of the long-running sitcom.\n\nSet in the present day, Sharon has lost her job at Lidl, while Tracey has spent the decade protecting her 16-year-old son from the truth about his father’s criminal past. When they receive a letter from Dorien, apparently fading and decrepit in a nursing home, the duo pay a visit to their old friend.\n\nAnd in comic timing and tone Simon James Green's touring production plays like an old episode. But there is a theory that comedy is based on expecting one outcome and receiving another, and over 102 episodes Birds Of A Feather has had a substantial amount of time to play its hand.\n\nToo much of the comedy is a relentless barrage of banal one-liners based on the idea that one character is working class, one formerly working class and one is not working class. It leads to a lot of tail-chasing as the same pun is hammered again and again. It sometimes feels like the Bolsheviks did not take that long to sort out their class issues and got more done.\n\nClumsily integrated pantomime pop culture references, from Cameron’s Britain to Michael Jackson’s doctor and Compare the Meerkat to the horse meat scandal, are the only reminders that any time has passed since the last episode was broadcast.\n\nThere is a tendency with updates of old favourites to err on the side of caution and although the material can seem stale, rehashed and reheated, Birds Of A Feather does its best to play to its audience. The cast enjoy themselves and the dialogue is well-meaning, even though flaws in the format frequently make themselves known and repetition has neutered some of the laughs.\n\nIt does not dwell on the matter or become wistful, but there are a handful of nods to the age of the characters and, in turn, the age of the audience.\n\nAnyone delighted that Birds Of A Feather has now been recommissioned for an ITV series would find plenty to enjoy in this adaptation and its worth is proportionate to whether its nine-year original run was something loved, endured or simply ignored.\n\nBirds Of A Feather, Grand Opera House, York, until Saturday.
