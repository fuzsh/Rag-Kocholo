I really think S3 onwards is better, much funnier than the first two series. S7 for me is great, I didn't like the new Darryl and I always preferred the second Chris from S2 but I really enjoyed the episodes where Sharon was thrown out by Tracey and had to live with Chris. I know a lot of people don't like S8 or 9 where they had left Chigwell but I really think the show was funnier in the later series. The storyline of Sharon wanting to get pregnant with the help of Dorien's contacts in S8 was hilarious to me. I'd say my favourite episodes were:\n\n- Falling In Love Again (S2 Christmas Special)\n\n- The Chigwell Connection (S4 Christmas Special)\n\n- Absent Friends (Series 5)\n\n- Appreciation Society (Series 6)\n\n- On The Glass (Series 6)\n\n- Porridge (Series 7)\n\n- Rising Damp (Series 7)\n\n- Three Up, Two Down (Series 7)\n\n- Reservoir Birds (S7 Christmas Special)\n\n- Trouble & Strife (S8)\n\n- Maids of Ongar (S8)\n\n0\n\nReally good watching 'Birds' again on UKTV Drama.\n\nShame they have missed out/not shown 2 of the 102 episodes made.\n\nSeries 2/ep3 - Young Guns. This was shown several times on Paramount 2 & Comedy Central Xtra between 2009-2011 so the content cant be that \"unsuitable\" for this day and age? Has UKTV given a reason why they have not shown this episode?\n\nAlso the 'special' flashback episode \"The chigwell years\" which was shown after series 6 finished but before the start of the shows downfall in series 7. This episode has the 3 girls around the kitchen table talking about the past few years and shows clips of series 1-6. I like the last line from Dorien in this episode where she breaks out of character and asks shel/trace if the little girls on the end credits are really them.\n\nReally felt like a good way to end the whole show...instead of limping through another couple of years with series 7-9.\n\nSo will the new ITV series be known as series 10 or 'The new series 1\"....a bit like Doctor Who?\n\n0\n\nAlso the 'special' flashback episode \"The chigwell years\" which was shown after series 6 finished but before the start of the shows downfall in series 7.

I know it's common for ex-cons to reoffend but I think it would've been better for only Darryl to have gone back to prison and not Chris. It would've given the whole thing a fresh angle.\n\nI don't share the view that it dramatically declined towards the end. In fact, looking at comments online, one of the stand out episodes in people's memories was the one with the haunted video recorder which was in the last series.\n\nThe stage show was great so I have high hopes for the new series.\n\nSome of the cast and writers have referred to it as series 10. From a commercial perspective, considering Network DVD's connections with ITV and FremantleMedia, I'd imagine they will release the new series as a continuation of their existing Birds titles.\n\n0\n\nI'm disappointed it's on ITV, it means it will be a few minutes shorter. I did read it would air in spring 2014. I actually hope it starts on Christmas day as an hour special.\n\nSurely I'm not the only person on here who doesn't think the show declined. I actually love S7 & 8. 9 had some really good moments too, I really dislike the final episode set in Ireland though. I thought the show should have ended in the house.\n\nAnother thing that I loved about the show is that a few series got a lot of episodes for British comedy. S2 had 16 episodes for example, most British comedies have 6 or 7 episodes. I felt like the viewers were given more a lot like US comedies.\n\n0"
