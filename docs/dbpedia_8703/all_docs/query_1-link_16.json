        "text": "Is there still a market for this kind of homespun comedy, or will this revival merely taint what was a successful series better left in the late ‘90s? After viewing Series 10’s opening episode, ‘Gimme Shelter’, there is an argument for both.\n\nReunited at a book-signing years after falling out with each other, Tracey (Linda Robson) and Sharon (Pauline Quirke ) face up to the mistakes of their past and Sharon moves back home with Tracey and her son Travis. A chance encounter with man-eater Dorien (Lesley Joseph) completes the original trio. Faced with loneliness, poverty and legal battles, the ladies of Chigwell seek comfort in one another, and the spark of friendship is reignited.\n\nWritten by creators Laurence Marks and Maurice Gran, the show does its best to appear current, yet retain the same sense of humour that made it stand out back in the day: casual and humorous remarks about things like bedroom tax, Skype and Dragon’s Den place us firmly in the present. That said, it doesn’t shy away from the show’s past, with the return of the original Dalentrace house set and the iconic title sequence providing a warm hit of nostalgia.\n\nHowever, there is a spark missing in this episode: certain jokes fall flat and that studio audience’s laughter feels forced. We’re hoping, as fans of the original series, that the gang are just finding their feet with the characters again, and we will see a general improvement as the weeks go by. After all, this episode has the tough job of essentially having to act as a pilot for new viewers.\n\nThe show does play to its strengths, and this lies mainly in the continued chemistry of the three leads. Robson, as Tracey, is the straight woman to Quirke’s brash Sharon, who gets all the best lines in the episode. Her stream of hilarious barbs with the destitute Dorien is fantastic. Joseph remains particularly likeable in the self-absorbed and yet endearing character she portrayed all those years ago (“What’s a meat raffle?”). Reinventing her as a sort of geriatric E. L James is a stroke of genius, as it feels believable for the character yet moves proceedings forward. The inclusion of Tracey’s sons Travis and Garth (now played by Busted star Matt Willis) is a welcome addition to the group dynamic, as long as they remain in the background, never taking the shine off the three leading ladies.\n\n‘Gimme Shelter’ retains the charm and the light social commentary that were such important factors to Birds of a Feather’s success first time round, and while it does have a few laugh out loud moments its place in the modern comedy landscape remains unsure.\n\nAirs at 8.30pm on Thursday 2 January 2014 on ITV.\n\n> Buy the complete series boxset on Amazon."
