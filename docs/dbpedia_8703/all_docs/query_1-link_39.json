She became the youngest-ever female dragon to join BBC One’s Dragons’ Den and was awarded an MBE for services to the economy in 2016.\n\nComedy\n\nLaurence Marks and Maurice Gran are accomplished scriptwriters and producers known for their significant contributions to television, theatre and musicals. They have created several hit television comedies, including the acclaimed Shine on Harvey Moon, and The New Statesman.\n\nThey set up Alomo Productions, writing and producing TV shows Birds of a Feather and Goodnight Sweetheart. Their latest play, Cluedo - The Next Chapter, inspired by the classic board game, is about to start a nationwide tour.\n\nUniversity of York Vice-Chancellor, Professor Charlie Jeffery, said: “Our honorary graduates this year demonstrate the significance of creativity, innovation, and communication in making real and impactful contributions to society.\n\n“We are also proud to honour Dr Wayne Campbell for his services to the University of York; he has been an inspirational leader whose passion for enhancing student life has helped us to create strong and lasting partnerships with our student community.”\n\nPandemic\n\nProfessor Jonathan Van-Tam is a Senior Strategy Adviser to the University of Nottingham School of Medicine and previously the Deputy Chief Medical Officer in the Department of Health and Social Care, where he played a crucial leadership role during the Covid-19 pandemic. His efforts in orchestrating the acquisition and distribution of vaccines and antiviral drugs in the UK were pivotal.\n\nSara Wajid, co-CEO of Birmingham Museums, has worked in the arts for 30 years in various roles and sectors, including as an editor of artists’ books and as a literary journalist. She is a judge of the Museums and Heritage Awards, and has been a judge of the Museum Activism Awards. In 2014, she founded the Museum Detox network for people of colour in museums in order to promote anti-racism and equality through solidarity.\n\nStudent experience\n\nProfessor Hideo Ohno, the 22nd President of Tohoku University, is a physicist and world leader in the field of spintronics - a technology that takes advantage of the magnetic (spin) and electronic (charge) attributes of an electron. Professor Ohno’s pioneering work in the field ranges from the creation and exploration of the physical properties of new ferromagnetic semiconductors to the development of a high-performance spintronics device.\n\nAcademic Registrar at the University of York, Dr Wayne Campbell's experience extends to all aspects of the student journey from admission to graduation and beyond, including higher education administration, enhancing the quality of teaching and learning, student life and employability. He is passionate about working in partnership with elected student representatives to improve the student experience.\n\nDr Campbell is a graduate in Biochemistry from the University of Kent, where he also gained a PhD in Biotechnology, and possesses two Masters’ degrees from the Universities of Cambridge and Loughborough.\n\nHonorary degree ceremonies take place from Tuesday 06 February to Thursday 08 February 2024.
