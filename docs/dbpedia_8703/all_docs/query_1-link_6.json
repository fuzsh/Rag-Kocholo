        "text": "Rock bands go on for ever, it seems. And even when they break up, they re-form later. So perhaps popular sitcoms should have the same leeway. News last week that Birds of a Feather, the BBC show that first standardised the Essex brand across Britain, will be back on television screens with its original female cast implies that, as the age of pensionable retirement recedes, so the sell-by date on comic scenarios has lengthened too.\n\nBirds of a Feather ran for nine series between 1989 and Christmas 1998 and told the story of two sisters, Sharon and Tracey, played by Pauline Quirke and Linda Robson, both married to imprisoned bank robbers and living in Chigwell. Diverting them from their squabbles was their neighbour, the libidinous and aspirational Dorien, played by Lesley Joseph. Written by Laurence Marks and Maurice Gran, it drew in audiences of between 10 and 20 million as it parodied the triumph of Thatcherite values among the working class.\n\nThe writing duo's reboot of the format, written for ITV this time, will also aim to chronicle the age by charting the characters as middle-aged women in a more austere Britain. Nonetheless, the channel's decision to recommission such an established show clearly signals a yearning for the comfort of familiar things. And it is just the sort of reliable, saucy comfort that has often been provided by sitcoms with all-women stars.\n\nReading on mobile? See a Birds of a Feather clip here\n\nPutting to one side the controversy about whether women performers are as funny as men, it is evident that a high percentage of shows in the sitcom hall of fame are all about the lives of women. In recent years Absolutely Fabulous, Dinner Ladies, Getting On and Miranda have attracted huge viewing loyalty, taking up the key position in the popular cultural landscape that The Liver Birds, about two women flatmates in Liverpool, occupied in the 1970s. A wackier successor in the 1980s, Girls on Top, failed to make the same sort of impact on viewers, but it did launch some major stars, including Tracey Ullman, Dawn French, Jennifer Saunders and Ruby Wax.\n\nIn America, the fact that one of the most successful comedy shows of all-time, I Love Lucy, was created around the talent of the powerful Lucille Ball gave the female-centred sitcom more confidence from the outset. By the 1970s Rhoda, starring Valerie Harper and her screen sister, Brenda, played by Julie Kavner, had spun off from the popular Mary Tyler Moore Show. Since then, the strength of the genre in the US has been underlined by big ratings shows such as The Golden Girls, which was set in a Florida retirement community and ran for seven years. Most recently the acclaimed shows Girls and Two Broke Girls have taken up the reins. Both are set around New York and tell the stories of young girls trying to make good in the city, just as Rhoda did. In an entertainment industry historically dominated by men, shows focused on female relationships have earned their keep at the centre of TV schedules again and again.\n\nJon Plowman, a former BBC head of comedy, believes funny television is always driven by character, whatever the gender, but he agrees that shows about key female relationships have \"been among the most influential\". \"The public seem to take to them here and in America,\" he said this weekend. \"A show like Rhoda was a spinoff, but other shows spun off from Mary Tyler Moore too. You had Phyllis, with Cloris Leachman, and then Lou Grant, which wasn't a comedy at all. In fact, it is hard to think of really big sitcoms that have not been driven by women, with the exceptions of Steptoe and Son and Dad's Army.\"\n\nPlowman, who produced Absolutely Fabulous, suggests that the success of predominantly female shows comes down to a sense that something is on screen that would normally be private, kept away from the conventionally male public arena: \"Audiences feel they are seeing something they usually don't see, inside another world.\" He remembers that when he read Jennifer Saunders's script for Ab Fab he thought: \"I don't know how much of this really goes on.\"\n\nReading on mobile? See an Absolutely Fabulous clip here\n\nListening to women's banter can feel like an illicit pleasure, he says, in a way that listening to men sitting in a pub does not. \"I don't know if anybody has ever done this analysis, but it might also be there are more female best friends in sitcoms. Lucille Ball had a man in her shows, depending where she was in her marriages, but she always also had Vivian Vance playing her friend. She must have felt she needed a woman to talk to.\"\n\nRather like I Love Lucy and Roseanne Barr's comedic vehicle Roseanne, several important British shows have been driven by a central female character even when the cast was mixed. The plot of the 1970s hit Butterflies pivoted on Wendy Craig's reluctant housewife, Ria, and similarly Dawn French was the beating heart, as well as the subject, of The Vicar of Dibley, which Plowman also produced. \"Interestingly, when we put together what we thought would turn out to be the last episode of Dibley,\" recalls Plowman, \"we wondered why it was finishing and Richard Curtis, the writer, did admit it had got a lot harder to write since Dawn's character had married.\"\n\nAll-female environments allow a show's stars to discuss \"the sex wars\" more freely, Plowman thinks. \"In Golden Girls, for instance, they had all outlived their men and men, in fact, were often the threat that might split them up.\"\n\nArguably, the formula works just as well in male-centred shows such as The Likely Lads, It Ain't Half Hot Mum, Porridge or even Last of the Summer Wine, to say nothing of Steptoe and Dad's Army. Comedian Bridget Christie has a radical proposal: \"I think all entertainment should be completely segregated and all humour should be gender-based. I wouldn't let any man into my radio shows if I didn't have to.\"\n\nThe standup comic, who is taking her new live show, A Bic For Her, to the Edinburgh Fringe this summer, also argues that to have women speaking out in a mixed social situation can look unrealistic. \"Mixed conversation is usually male-dominated so it doesn't really happen and when it does it can be a bit of a shock.\"\n\nChristie believes men are frightened that women will steal their scenes. \"A great comic creation like Pauline McLynn's Mrs Doyle in Father Ted was funny because of the writing and her acting, although the show was about men. If anything, women are too funny for men. In scenes with men we are usually supposed to stand around laughing, or rolling our eyes as if to say 'Isn't he crazy?'\"\n\nThe mainstream success of Miranda has given a fresh boost to women-centred sitcoms, with recent BBC2 commissions including Sue Perkins's show Heading Out and an affectionate parody of the suffragette movement, Up the Women, starring Rebecca Front and Jessica Hynes, who also wrote it.\n\nReading on mobile? See a Miranda clip here\n\nThe idea to bring back Birds Of A Feather followed a stage-show revival which has toured Britain with the original cast. This September Robson, Quirke and Joseph will shoot eight new episodes which will go out on ITV early next year. Tracey will be seen now working in telesales at home, while Sharon has a job at \"World of Quid\" to make ends meet, while Dorien has become an internationally bestselling author (50 Shades of Chigwell?).\n\nWhether the latest version of the sitcom will manage to define its times, even for those who resolutely refuse to watch, remains to be seen. When the BBC aired the first episode in October 1989 it received a flood of complaints about the sexual nature of the conversations between the female characters. The BBC1 controller, Jonathan Powell, was summoned to the board of governors to defend its supposedly obscene content and asked to consider moving it beyond the 9pm watershed. He stuck to his guns and the ratings soon proved his point, with early viewing figures of more than 12 million.\n\nA decade later, repeats of this once groundbreaking show had become a cosy staple of daytime viewing. Birds of a Feather was the show that was interrupted on 11 September 2001, when viewers were forced to switch to live coverage of the attacks on the World Trade Centre in Manhattan. Writers Marks and Gran now have a very different Britain to comfort and cheer."
