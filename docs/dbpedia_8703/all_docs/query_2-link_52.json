The place of publication may be relevant if:\n\nyou’re citing works with editions published in multiple locations\n\nthe location the book was published impacts the credibility of your work\n\nSometimes knowing the place of publication of the sources adds credibility to the work. For example, an Australian publication may be more credible if it cites books published in Australia. Including the publishing location clearly shows the reader where the book is from. If including the place of publication, include the city listed."
