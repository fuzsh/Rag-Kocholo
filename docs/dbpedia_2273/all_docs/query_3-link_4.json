        "text": "The Military Ordinariate of Karnia-Ruthenia (Portuguese: Ordinariato Militar da Kárnia-Rutênia, Latin: Ordinariatus Militaris Karniae-Ruthenia), or more formally the Apostolic Military Ordinariate of Karnia-Ruthenia, is a military ordinariate of the Roman Catholic Church. Immediately subject to the Holy See, it provides pastoral care to Roman Catholics serving in the Karno-Ruthenian Armed Forces and their families.\n\nHistory[edit | edit source]\n\nOn 28 March 2019, Oscar I created the office of the Apostolic Field Vicar of the Imperial and Royal Armed Forces of Karnia-Ruthenia, to be the head of the Apostolic Military Ordinariate of Karnia-Ruthenia; a post to be held by the Archbishop of Persenburg. The Episcopal seat is located at the Cathedral of Saint Stephen King of Hungary in Persenburg, Karnia-Ruthenia.\n\nIt was founded on the same ground of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Persenburg, to be a 'de jure' military ordinariate, considered sede vacante, destined to the Catholic Church to, in the advent of independence, be assumed by the Church of Rome.\n\nThe Apostolic Field Vicar was a post created to have its holder appointed by the Emperor-King and confirmed by the Holy See. He is entitled to spiritual jurisdiction over the Imperial and Royal Armed Forces during times of war and peacetime.\n\nOn 25 February 2021, Ruy Hallack, a foreign Cardinal related to the Catholic Church in Micronationalism - ICM in portuguese, an organization authorized to promote the Catholicism in micronationalism in Brazil during the 1990's, assumed the position of Apostolic Field Vicar.\n\nApostolic Field Vicar[edit | edit source]\n\nNo. Name Arms Period Note I Joseph of Assis 28 March\n\n2019 25 February\n\n2021 First de jure Archbishop of Persenburg and first de jure Apostolic Field Vicar. II Ruy Hallack 25 February\n\n2021 present Second de jure Apostolic Field Vicar and first foreigner to be appointed.\n\nSee also[edit | edit source]"
