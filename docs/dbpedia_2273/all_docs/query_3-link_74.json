        "text": "...\n\n[On the recently-approved Portuguese law extending the concept of marriage to same-sex couples.]\n\n...\n\nTo me, independently of the content - I do not agree with the notion of [same-sex] marriage -, I do agree with and accept a man who lives with a man, and a woman who lives with a woman.\n\nAnd this does not shock you?\n\nObviously not. The attitude I must keep is one of respectability.\n\n...\n\nThe Church welcomes homosexuals, in fact. As long as they do not practice their homosexuality...\n\nIt is certain that a homosexual couple is not theoretical, isn't it? And affections are translated through this practice, through this psycho-affective fusion of mysterious unity that is the human being.[*]\n\nThe Church must understand this?\n\nShe must understand it. But not sanctify it - because love is, for the Church, a sacrament, matrimony. This is a very complex matter, which must be very well understood. And no institution may say that it accepts it or does not accept it. Each case is a [particular] case.\n\n...\n\nBut you must surely have received complaints for speaking about things you shouldn't have...\n\nYes. From people who disagree with my ideas. I receive so many nasty letters! One day, I will publish them all! I don't care, naturally, that there are positions different from my own. What upsets me is that people distort what I defend or decide to use insult and gratuitous aggression.\n\nAnd from within the Church?\n\nI have been warned once or twice."
