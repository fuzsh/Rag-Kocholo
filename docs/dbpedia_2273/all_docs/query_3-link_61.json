        "text": "On many occasions, Pope Francis has stated that the Church must choose the path of attraction. He echoed this same message when talking about vocations.\n\nThe Church must be attractive. Wake up the world! Be witnesses of a different way of acting, of living! It is possible to live differently in the world [...] It is this witness I expect from you”. ~Pope Francis (Rejoice, A Letter to consecrated men and women in preparation for the year dedicated to Consecrated Life)\n\nThis task of waking up the Diocese in cultivating vocations, providing opportunities for prayer, and in promoting awareness for the support of a culture of vocations is beginning a new path with the establishment of the Serra Club of Calgary. Serra is a global lay apostolate for the promotion of vocations within the Catholic Church.\n\nOn Saturday, September 16, 2023, we celebrated the official Charter Day of the Serra Club in our Diocese with Mass at St. Mary’s Cathedral and the induction of the founding lay members. I am grateful for the commitments they have made to foster and promote in our diocese vocations to the ministerial priesthood, to encourage and affirm vocations to the consecrated religious life, and to assist its members to respond in their own lives to God’s call to holiness in Jesus Christ and through the Holy Spirit.\n\nThe objectives of this lay apostolate in the Diocese of Calgary include:\n\nRe-ignite enthusiasm for fostering vocations throughout the diocese\n\nEstablish coordination with parishes and schools\n\nFocus on the most effective ways to raise vocation awareness and reach youth and young adults\n\nProvide support for parish events, communications, and planning for vocation awareness\n\nProvide parishes and schools with access to high quality resources, digital and print communication\n\nThe radical living of our baptism is a continuous call for every person to follow Christ. It is never static, nor is it focussed on self.\n\nBecause when we put Christ at the centre of our life, we ourselves don’t become the centre! […] We are not at the centre; we are, so to speak, relocated. We are at the service of Christ and of the Church.” ~Pope Francis, Rejoice – A Letter to consecrated men and women in preparation for the year dedicated to Consecrated Life\n\nThe true heart and essence of a vocation to the priesthood and religious life is to be at the service of Christ and the Church. Waking up the Diocese, willing to be renewed in the service of Christ and for the Church involves promoting the beauty of vocations. The apostolate of the Serra Club can instill a renewal of spirit, of allowing our parishes, schools and families to become a path of attraction in which our young people can encounter Christ who draws them closer to himself in the discernment of their unique vocation.\n\nIn our parishes and schools, we must collaborate in the task of vocational promotion for our youth and young adults. The religious instruction that takes place in our publicly funded and private Catholic schools needs to be supported and strengthen by the involvement of our parishes and the members of the Serra Club if a spirit of vocational awareness is to permeate the life and formation of our youth.\n\nThese new strategies that are undertaken will reflect the impetus and commitment of the diocese in promoting a culture of vocations. Patience and endurance in implementing such strategies will assist parents in passing on the faith and in presenting the attractiveness of following Christ to their children by encouraging them to be open to discern God’s call and to consider a vocation to priesthood and religious life.\n\n​\n\nIn this coming year it is my hope that the initiatives of the Serra Club will begin to wake up the Diocese and our parishes so that we might become a diocese that promotes a culture of vocations. May the virtues of “patient expectation and apostolic endurance” guide our efforts in the Church to become a renewed path of attraction by promoting opportunities of closeness and encounter with Christ for our youth.\n\nSerra Chapters celebration with Bishop McGrattan, Sep. 16, 2023. Photos: Victor Panlilio.\n\nWelcoming five new seminarians this year\n\nThis year, our Diocese was pleased to welcome five new seminarians who have begun their formation at St. Joseph Seminary in Edmonton. They have joined the eight returning seminarians who have already been discerning the priesthood for our Diocese. In addition to the joyful ordination of Fr. Santiago Torres earlier this year, his former eight confreres represent the first group of seminarians in more than twenty years who have all chosen to remain in formation with none discerning out of the seminary over the summer. Of course, the Church continues to discern their call to the priesthood alongside them, but it is a tremendous blessing to see the commitment of these young men to their preparation for possible ordination.\n\n​The five new seminarians who have joined them are also the largest entrance class we have seen in the Diocese in more than fifteen years. They have either been valued leaders in their home parishes from throughout Calgary or active participants in the St. Francis Xavier Chaplaincy. Two other young men- one from All Saints Parish, Lethbridge and another from St. Vincent Liem Vietnamese Parish, Calgary- have entered novitiates in the Franciscan and Dominican orders respectively.\n\n​We give thanks for how richly the Lord is blessing our Diocese with vocational discernment and I urge us all to continue praying for this vital intention in our local Church.\n\nPlease pray for our seminarians: ​\n\nPeter An,\n\n​Theology IV\n\nAndre Boudreau,\n\n​Arts III\n\nJoshua Capicio,\n\n​Theology I\n\nBennet Chacko,\n\nTheology II\n\nJonathan Dobek,\n\n​Propadeutic Year\n\nSamuel Ejeregbe,\n\nTheology III\n\nEvin George,\n\n​Propadeutic Year\n\nSolomon Ip,\n\n​Philosophy I\n\nJeffrell Painaga,\n\n​Propadeutic Year\n\nAntonio Pasqualotto,\n\nPropadeutic Year\n\nIf you feel called to support our seminarians and priests in a tangible way, consider becoming one of the founding members of the Serra Club of the Diocese of Calgary.

All are welcome!\n\nVertical Divider\n\nI was born in Kerala, southern India, and blessed to have been raised in a Catholic faith environment. My parents were devout and churchgoing. The church played a significant role in my upbringing. My family frequented the parish church, and I was actively involved in the parish. I was also introduced to very solid catechism and different devotions.\n\nI felt a calling to the priesthood at a very young age. Reflecting on what triggered this priestly vocation, it was a fruit of my Novena devotion to Mother Mary at my parish Church. The priest at the time was very particular, that everyone must attend the Novena prayer on Saturdays immediately after the Holy Mass. This brought me very close to Mother Mary, and one day I felt that God is calling me to serve Him as told by a loving Mother-Mother Mary.It touched my heart as if a heavenly whisper had been percolating for a while, gradually maturing into a discernment of the priesthood. Fortunately, by that time, I had become well-acquainted with the parish priest and a few other priest friends. After a few years, I pursued my priestly studies in different parts of India. In 1998, I was ordained by the then bishop of the Archdiocese of Ernakulum, Mar Thomas Chakkiath.\n\nI belong to the Archdiocese of Ernakulam — claimed as the heart of the Syro-Malabar Church. The heritage of the Syro-Malabar Church goes back to St. Thomas the Apostle who is believed to have arrived in Kerala in 52 AD. I served in various capacities within my priestly ministry in Kerala for six years before relocating to Calgary in 2004.\n\nMy journey in Calgary has been very providential, with God guiding me through different ministries such as associate pastor, campus minister, and pastor. Looking back on my journey in Canada, I can profusely say that, as the psalmist prays in Psalm 7:1, God has walked with me, “I will give to the Lord the thanks due to his righteousness, and I will sing praise to the name of the Lord, the Most High.” It has been a journey where my experience of God's guidance was profound.\n\nI could trust in God as He is in control of everything. My motto in my priestly journey reflects the words of 2 Corinthians 12:9 — \"My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.” On this occasion, I would like to acknowledge the gracious and kind support of many bishops, priests, and fellow brothers and sisters.\n\nReflecting on my priestly journey of 25 years, two very pertinent aspects of my vocation have been the Grace of God, and the intercession of Mother Mary. I was quite blessed and privileged to lead a youth ministry as a campus minister at two post-secondary colleges for a while. Engaging with post-secondary students for more than ten years not only transformed me but also brought many young people to the faith and Christian values.\"\n\nWorking in the secular landscape of universities was challenging, but having a platform to uphold that “Faith matters, Christ transforms” was incredible. It was eye-opening to interact with young people who were struggling in their search for meaning in life while aspiring for a better future. I must admit that it was rewarding. Moreover, engaging with pluralistic faith groups and diverse cultures, while specifically upholding the Christian values and faith connections in my ministry, was always intriguing.\n\nAnother highlight of my ministry that I humbly reflect upon is my role as director and pastor of Mother Teresa Syro-Malabar Church in Calgary. It was in 2009 that Bishop Henry appointed me as the Director of the Syro-Malabar Community when it was still a very small community.\n\nI have been privileged to witness its exponential growth from 30 to 450 families by 2018, and to have played a part in establishing a church for the community. God entrusted me with the role of becoming the founding priest of the Mother Teresa Syro-Malabar community in Calgary. Having had the privilege of meeting Mother Teresa twice in Kerala, her spiritual influence has greatly affected my priestly life and inspired me to rally for Mother Teresa's Church in Calgary.\n\nLastly, I am also involved with military chaplaincy as a Reserve Chaplain. This was an offshoot of campus ministry, where many students were drawn to military service and their persuasive invitation to serve the military community added another dimension to my priestly vocation. A chaplain's role in the military goes beyond the borders of religion and faith; it is more about embracing pure humanity and the well-being of anyone in need. It is a ministry of presence and strengthening robust resilience.\n\nGrowing up, Fr. Jerald D’Souza showed signs of his vocation early. Fr. Jerry comes from Madanthyar, near Mangalore in India, an agricultural region. One of his duties was to watch the cows and make sure they did not escape the pasture, and so by the age of 12, he would practice preaching to the Gospel to a bovine congregation.\n\nFr. Jerry lost his father at the age of one, leaving his mother widowed at a young age with three young children, of which he was the youngest. His mother never remarried, and made many sacrifices for her family in their poverty.\n\nIn one particular instance, he remembered that his mother once worked for a whole day, and made a meal of rice porridge or congee for her family. His mother ensured there was enough for the family, and went into the kitchen to drink the cooking water of the congee for her own dinner. It was his mother’s sacrifices that led him to understand the sacrificial action of Christ on the Cross and how God the Father would sacrifice his Son.\n\nHis mother’s actions would also help him to understand the pains of his parishioners in their day-to-day lives. Fr. Jerry has also been blessed to have a spiritual mother as well, in a woman who would come and pray at the Carmelite Monastery where he spent his theologate. He recalled going through a dry spell in prayer, and was impressed by a woman who would come and pray in front of the Blessed Sacrament in the Carmelite way. Fr. Jerry asked her to pray for him, and this was the beginning of her spiritual motherhood to Fr. Jerry.\n\nFr. Jerry has had his trials during his formation. He first discerned his vocation to the Discalced Carmelites when he was in Grade 12, influenced by Carmelite seminarians coming to his high school. Upon entry into the novitiate, Fr. Jerry was not the ideal candidate, being noticeably timid and having low-self esteem. He remembers begging St. Teresa of Avila to take his vocation into her hands if he was to continue, praying “if you would like me to continue in the Carmelite life, then you have to take me.”\n\nIn his second year of theology studies, Fr. Jerry experienced a moment of crisis. He was assigned to the Shrine of the Infant Jesus in Mangalore, where each Thursday, roughly 2000 people would turn up to the 6pm Mass for the novena to the Infant Jesus of Prague. Each seminarian was expected to lead the novena prayers in turn, and to deliver a 3-5 minute sermon. In the midst of his crisis, Fr. Jerry says he became like Abraham at Sodom, saying “If I do well, then I will stay; if I do poorly, I will leave.” Ultimately, there was no reason to fear. He had no reason to fear — many people came up after the Mass, asking who was the seminarian who did so well!\n\nFr. Jerry was ordained in the Octave of Easter, on April 16th, 1998. Immediately following ordination, he was assigned to the Carmelite farm house in Goa for a year, before being made the first director of the Shrine of the Infant Jesus in Mangalore. Afterwards, he served as rector and formator at the Carmelite minor seminary in Goa for a year and a half, before being asked to be one of the first two missionaries to Canada from his province, the Karnataka-Goa Province, arriving July 25, 2003.\n\nHe served in a number of roles throughout the Archdiocese of Vancouver, watching the mission grow from a pair of priests to two monasteries in Mission, BC and Edmonton, AB, while fostering the first Canadian vocation, Fr. Frank Sharma, OCD.\n\nFr. Jerry arrived in Calgary to be pastor of St. Thomas More Parish in 2019, and was immediately asked to complete the renovation of the sanctuary with little knowledge of the work in progress. The following March, COVID struck, putting the work at a standstill, and leaving him in a conundrum of having negligible cooking skills and suddenly having to fend for himself. For Fr. Jerry, the eight deepest months of the pandemic carry some of his happiest memories, having care extended to him by the parishioners of St. Thomas More.\n\nIn his ministry, Fr. Jerry has found that his biggest challenge has been to strengthen spirituality in the family, which St. John Paul II declared to be a domestic church. He believes that when the family is strengthened in its spirituality, prayer life and faith, the family will strengthen the parish; strong parishes will create a strong diocese, and strong dioceses will create a strong universal church.\n\nAs for prayer, Fr. Jerry’s favourite space is his meditation of 5 to 10 minutes in front of the Blessed Sacrament every morning, and his breviary is his source of strength. He also cites frequent confession and spiritual direction as the two wings to allow the spiritual life to take flight.\n\nTo grow close to Jesus, Fr. Jerry suggests taking the example of Christ Himself, being humble and simple. He suggests relaxing and being yourself, without baggage or lists of requests — in other words, being naked before Christ. All of this is done in the spirit of Carmel, which is both intellectual and simple, having St. Teresa of Avila and St. John of the Cross as great models of intellectual life, and St. Therese of Lisieux as a model of simplicity.\n\nWhen asked for advice for those discerning religious life, Fr. Jerry advises the potential discerner to be honest before God and one’s superiors in the face of failure. God will send his “angels” to guide — formators, spiritual directors, confessors, and lay faithful. His life as a religious has yielded excellent advice.\n\nFr. Jerry has served for some time as superior of the Carmelites, and leading into an election for a continuance of his term, he was advised that if there is a split in the vote, he has done the will of God. If the vote was unanimously in favour, it would mean that he spent his term trying to please others; if against, it would mean that he was a poor choice for superior.\n\nHis spiritual father also gave him the advice that a joyful Carmelite is a joyful religious — that the vows of poverty, chastity and obedience should lead to joy. In Fr. Jerry’s case, they most certainly have.\n\nThroughout his interview, Fr. Jerry radiated a consistent, confident joyfulness throughout his office. It is evident he finds great joy in his vocation, where work can be tiring, yet never a burden. ​There can be no doubt that this joy will carry Fr. Jerry onward into the next 25 years of his priestly ministry, full of contentment and fulfilment.\n\nI, Fr. Roy Anthony Donatus Jayamaha, was born to God- fearing parents, Rex Arvin and Mary Magdalene Jayamaha of Wattla, Sri Lanka. I was the third child in a family of seven siblings and was attracted to the religious life from my childhood. I was educated by the De la Salle Brothers and was attracted to become one of them. After completing my studies, I taught for two years in a leading La Salle School in Colombo.\n\nOne fine day, I met a Sri Lankan missionary priest serving in Pakistan, who had come on a home leave. After listening to his interesting stories and challenging conditions, I contacted some Pakistani Bishops and expressed my willingness to serve as a missionary in this mostly Muslim country. In 1976, although it was heart-breaking news for my parents, I left with their blessing, to join the Diocese of Lahore, in Pakistan.\n\nWhen I landed in Lahore, I was surprised to see the Bishop himself at the airport to receive this unknown seminarian-to-be. On the same evening, the Bishop took me to show the place where I would travel daily to learn the Urdu language. It was a convent of the Good Shepherd Sisters which was six km from the minor seminary. While travelling, the Bishop gave a running commentary about the historical city and suddenly asked me to look through the window where I saw a huge cemetery. Then with a serious gesture, he uttered, “Boy, we all have to come here.” As it was my first winter experience, the Bishop gave some old winter clothes to wear, but no pocket money, because the board and lodging did not cost me in the minor seminary. I travelled during the week, up and down on a bicycle from the minor seminary to the Good Shepherd Convent, in order to study Urdu. First, I had to learn the alphabet and then the words.\n\nAfter four months of language study, I was sent to remote village parishes to work with a young diocesan priest for nine months and later another nine months with two Belgium Capuchin missionaries. While there I learned the Punjabi language, customs, culture, and what not. Afterwards, I did my Philosophy and Theological studies at Christ the King Seminary in Karachi which was nearly 1,100 km from Lahore. My greatest memory of this time was to eventually see that all five residential staff members were recognized for their services to God and were rewarded by getting the Red Hats ( i.e., one cardinal, two archbishops, and two bishops). Bravo!.\n\nOn October 1st 1983, the feast of St. Therese of Lisieux, the Patroness of Missions, I requested, and was granted to be ordained a priest of God. That red-letter day took place in my hometown of Wattala, Sri Lanka, with the Pakistani late Archbishop Armando Trindade as celebrant and the late Archbishop Oswald Gomis of Colombo, Sri Lanka, assisting.\n\nMy first assignment as a priest was to work in a large remote parish near the Pakistani / Indian border which consisted of some 276 villages. The Catholic families were scattered far and wide and one was fortunate to see even a handful in some villages. There were thirteen full time paid catechists to assist me. There I toured the villages on a motorbike over many rough and treacherous roads to administer the sacraments and other pastoral needs my flock required. Quite a few nights were spent in the villages, in order to, meet the people as they came home late from the fields and farms. Most were laborers, working for Muslim landlords. Some laborers shared their pathetic stories with me by staying late at night, sitting in their courtyards.\n\nFrom 1987 to 1993, I served as a pastor in another remote area. There I built a church and few chapels together with the people. The main church was dedicated to the Holy Spirit. In 2005, it was badly burnt and partly destroyed by a mob of rebellious group of people. One day my driver took the jeep to leave a newborn baby and her mother in a village nearly 23km away from a hospital. While the driver was returning, two dacoits beat him and took my jeep at the gunpoint and fled away with it. Every Sunday, the parishioners prayed to Mother Mary to recover the vehicle. After 6 months, on a feast day of Mother Mary, the police returned the jeep with some bullet holes on it. It was unfortunate that notorious dacoits were shot dead by the police.\n\nIn 1993, I was appointed as the Director of the National Marian Shrine, which was built in 1886, and was the second oldest Catholic Church in Pakistan.\n\nOn a sabbatical, in 1995,I flew to Australia, where I met the good Father John Schuster and got a sweet taste for Calgary. During our get-togethers, I learned a lot about Canada and the Calgary Diocese. Upon my return to Pakistan, I was appointed the Director of the Renewal Centre in Lahore. There, I trained lay catechists for the archdiocese and taught diocesan spirituality for the propaedeutic year students in the Philosophy Seminary for seven years. For a short time, I was the acting rector of this seminary. In the absence of the Archbishop and Vicar- General, twice I was given the honor of being the administrator of the archdiocese. While being the executive secretary of the National Clergy Commission, I was involved in arranging renewal courses for clergy and on-going formation for young priests in the country. I compiled the Directory of the Catholic Church in Pakistan three times.\n\nWith the help of generous benefactors, I built a centre for special children. I always had a soft heart for the broken, poor, and needy. I felt honoured to serve under three Archbishops and elected twice as a member of the College of Consultors under two archbishops.\n\nMy services in Pakistan abruptly ended when two gunmen attacked, threatened and robbed me. As the Hindi song says “ajeeb dastan hai…kahan shuru, kahan katham...\" which means strange story, from where it started and where it ended. I learned many things as a student and as a missionary priest for thirty seven years from loving Pakistani people. Little did I know that I would leave Pakistan for good and be called to ministry in the dreamland, Calgary, Alberta in July of 2014. I'm really grateful to Bishop Emeritus Frederick Henry, for accepting me to the diocese with open arms.\n\nAfter all is said and done, a priest has to be broken and shared with others, keep the Eucharist at the center of his life, and become another Christ wherever he is. Today, although no one comes for daily Mass, I bring one and all to the altar at every liturgy. As someone rightly said, “Let the Christ in me, meet and greet the Christ in them”.\n\nThis year, I have reached another milestone in my priesthood, 40 years of humble service as a missionary priest. As of Palm Sunday 2023, I have celebrated 14,307 Holy Masses. What a wonderful gift from our Lord!.\n\nPriests need priests, especially when far away and alone in the missions. The beauty of this fraternity is that we know our brother priests do remember us and pray for us as we do for them as well as our parents, families and friends. Today as a Jesus Caritas priest, this “Littleness” and “Hiddenness” of our universal brother, St. Charles de Foucauld, has helped me to live the life of Nazareth happily more than ever with the Indigenous people of Brocket. I have just completed seven years in this mission, learning daily more than teaching. Together, we try to uplift the community, give new life, strengthen the families and beautify the place that attracts many people even from nearby parishes.\n\nPope Francis’ document, “Amoris Laetitia\" (On the Joy of Love) also reminds us regarding the practice of hospitality and how to reach out to people in parish communities. Our parishioners still worry about the same old question the Abbot asked, “How can we best serve the people who come to visit?” ( Holy Moments-by Matthew Kelly). Let us hope and pray that they will become a more vibrant community in the time to come.\n\nWritten by Deacon Michael Soentgerath.\n\nFather Michael Storey, diocesan priest for the Diocese of Calgary, celebrated his 50th Anniversary of Priestly Ordination on May 12 this year. For this special anniversary year, I had a chance to sit down with Fr. Mike to look back on those fifty years and highlight some of the very special events that Fr. Mike remembers with much gratitude.\n\nFirstly, the ordination day itself was such a marvellous celebration of faith, with Bishop Paul O’Byrne having celebrated his ordination at St. Augustine Parish in Taber. Bishop Paul chose Taber as the location with the intention of allowing the rural parishes to experience a priestly ordination in their hometown. Fr. Mike’s connection to Taber was that he completed this parish practicum in his final year of seminary. The whole parish, as well as many from different parts of Canada, gathered in Taber for this special celebration that all would remember and cherish as a tremendous day of celebrating the ministerial priesthood.\n\nAnother highlight of Fr. Mike’s priestly life was when Bishop Paul O’Byrne appointed him as the Ecumenical Officer of the Diocese. Fr. Mike had been Pastor of Ascension Catholic Parish in Calgary, the first Parish within the diocese to be under the same roof as a Lutheran Congregation. The two parishes together and formed the \"Sandstone Ecumenical Centre\". A true hands-on experience of intentionally living daily the spirit of ecumenism, as one Body of Christ focusing on what unites us rather than our divisions. It came as no surprise several years later, that Fr. Mike was the priest, chosen to administrate the reunification of Anglicans who wished to return to the Catholic Church together with Father Colin O’Rorke. Approximately sixty people were received back into the Catholic Church in this endeavour, initiated by Pope Benedict XVI. Fr. Mike feels very blessed to have been chosen to help facilitate this historical moment within our diocese and the Catholic Church.\n\nAs a Pastor, Fr. Mike feels very grateful for the opportunity of having been appointed to serve in many parishes of the diocese: Canadian Martyrs in Calgary, St. Michael’s in Pincher Creek, Sacred Heart in Oyen and Acadia Valley, St. Peter in Milk River, St. James in Okotoks, Ascension Parish in Calgary, St. James in Calgary-with a special ministry to the South Sudanese Catholics in Calgary, St. Peter’s in Calgary and St. Mary’s in Brooks.\n\nFollowing his Brooks appointment, Bishop Henry appointed Fr. Mike to the Calgary Priest Hospital Chaplaincy Team. This is when I had the privilege of working more closely with Fr. Mike. His work within the various hospitals within the city of Calgary was an amazing and extremely fruitful ministry with many experiences of people healing and on occasion even being cured of illness. Father recalls with great amazement how often the Sacraments of the Church were of such great healing benefit to those who availed themselves to their reception. Even fellow Christians asking for pastoral support was a common occurrence. His Chaplaincy Ministry was also not limited only to hospitals, he also served as Chaplain to the Calgary Police Service until August of this year.\n\nFinally, a special occasion that Fr. Mike will always cherish, was when his classmate Cardinal Thomas Collins, then Archbishop of Toronto, was made a Cardinal in Rome and he was invited to come and take part in the ceremony of his former classmate and friend. It was a powerful celebration of faith with Saint Pope John Paul II.\n\nNow Fr. Mike resides at the Providence Care Centre in the Priest residence wing, together with the other priests of the diocese. He reflects on his marvellous 50-year journey as a Servant of God in priestly ministry with gratitude.\n\nWith thankfulness and fond memories he looks back on his call from God in thanksgiving for all that the Lord had done and accomplished through his words, his hands and his heart! May the years ahead be filled with much peace, grace and many blessings in the Lord!"
