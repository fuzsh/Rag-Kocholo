Jose Miguel Asimbaya Moreno named bishop of the Military Ordinariate of Ecuador.\n\n🧐 Look closer\n\nA giant fall When he died in May 2019 at the age of 90, Jean Vanier was considered one of the spiritual giants of the Catholic Church. A winner of the Templeton Prize and recipient of the French Legion of Honor, the Canadian philosopher founded L’Arche, a network of 154 communities in 38 countries welcoming people with intellectual disabilities.\n\nBut Vanier’s reputation changed radically in February 2020, when an independent inquiry published a report concluding that he engaged in abusive and manipulative relationships with women.\n\nAs well as commissioning the inquiry, the Paris-based L’Arche International asked researchers to scour previously unseen archives to shed light on the relationship between Vanier and his spiritual mentor, the Dominican priest Fr. Thomas Philippe.\n\nOn Monday, researchers released an almost 900-page study (with a 65-page summary) entitled “Control and Abuse Investigation on Thomas Philippe, Jean Vanier and L’Arche (1950-2019).”\n\nThe report says that, under the influence of Philippe’s “mystico-sexual” teachings, Vanier engaged in sexual contact with at least 25 women (all adults without disabilities) over seven decades. It underlines that “all these relationships are part of a continuum of confusion, control and abuse.”\n\nA second study Monday also saw the release of a 700-page book in France entitled “L’Affaire,” published by Éditions du Cerf.\n\nThe volume is the result of a three-year investigation by the historian Tangi Cavalin into the relationship between the Dominican order, Fr. Thomas Philippe, and his brother Fr. Marie-Dominique Philippe, founder of the Community of St. John. The siblings, who died in 1993 and 2006 respectively, both engaged in spiritual and sexual abuse.\n\nThe study was commissioned by Br. Nicolas Tixier, prior provincial of the Dominican Province of France, and drew on documents in the order’s archives.\n\n“It took more than three decades for [the brothers’ victims] to be heard by the order and the Dominican Province of France,” concludes Cavalin, according to a preview by the French Catholic newspaper La Croix.\n\nWhat’s next? The two studies are the next steps in a reckoning with Jean Vanier’s vast and contradictory legacy. As part of the process, schools named after him have been renamed, while L’Arche has reevaluated and redesigned its safeguarding measures.\n\nIn a Jan. 30 letter to members, L’Arche International leaders Stephan Posner and Stacy Cates-Carney said that the new report marked “an important moment” as the organization prepares for a major assembly and the launch of a new charter.\n\n“What justifies L’Arche is not its founder, but the life of its members, with and without disabilities, at the service of a more human society. This task of re-reading our past will help us remain faithful to this commitment,” they said.\n\nWhat's Starting Seven?
