        "text": "Kenya's Catholic bishops have announced a national conference to look at ways forward for the country following the recent contentious presidential election campaign.\n\nThe main opposition leader, Raila Odinga, boycotted the October 25 election calling it \"unfair\", leaving President Uhuru Kenyatta to win with 98 percent of the vote. The Supreme Court called the poll after it annulled a first presidential election held in August on procedural grounds.\n\nThe Kenya Conference of Catholic Bishops said issues to be addressed included election reform, national reconciliation, good governance and addressing economic inequality No date was specified for the dialogue forum.\n\n\"This is the forum we believe will offer an opportunity to all Kenyans, especially the key political players, to engage constructively in a bid to chart the way forward for Kenya,\" said conference chairman, Bishop Philip Anyolo, in a statement on November 9.\n\nThe bishops met in Nakuru at a memorial Mass for Eldoret Bishop Cornelius Arap Korir, who died suddenly on October 30. Bishop Korir, who was renowned for his peacemaking efforts, is to be buried in a small chapel inside Sacred Heart Cathedral in Eldoret on November 11.\n\nThe bishops also called for an end to police brutality and urged politicians to shun selfish interests and think of the good of the nation, the Daily Nation reported.\n\nThey said they are dismayed at the prospect of the country disintegrating because of being polarized by politicians through demonstrations, boycott calls, and reckless statements. Bishop Alfred Rotich, in his homily at the memorial Mass, asked Kenyans to be ambassadors of peace even as the country is divided along tribal and political lines.\n\n\"As leaders and ordinary Kenyans we need to keenly listen to the voice of God and prepare peace pathways in our lives and in all our endeavors,\" said Bishop Rotich, who is the retired head of the Military Ordinariate of Kenya."
