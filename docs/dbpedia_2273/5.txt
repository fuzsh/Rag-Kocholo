The Military Ordinariate (Servicos de AssistÃªncia Religiosa de Forcas Armadas) of Portugal was established by the Apostolic See on 29 May 1966, but joined to the office of the Patriarch of Lisbon. On 3 May 2001, it was made public that the Holy Father had separated the Office of Military Ordinary for Portugal from that of Patriarch of Lisbon, appointing Bishop Januario Torgal Mendes Ferreira, auxiliary of the same Ordinariate, as Military Ordinary for Portugal.
