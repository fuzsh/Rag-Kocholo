        "text": "Family and Education\n\nb. by 1525.\n\nOffices Held\n\nBiography\n\nJohn ab Edmund, gentleman, seems to have left little trace. His family has not been discovered, but he could have been a brother of Hugh ab Edmund and Mathew ab Edmund of Bacheldre (about two miles south-east of Montgomery) mentioned on the gaol file of 13 Elizabeth. From the meagre local records it appears that he was never a town bailiff but his assessment at 3s.4d. for subsidy in 1546 within the hundred of Montgomery shows that he was then resident in or near the town. In common with all but one or two of the Welsh Members of Mary’s first Parliament he was not noted as having ‘stood for the true religion’, that is, against the government’s initial moves towards restoring Catholicism.\n\nRef Volumes: 1509-1558\n\nAuthor: P. S. Edwards\n\nNotes"
