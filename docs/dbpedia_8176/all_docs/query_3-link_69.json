        "text": "Editor of the editorial page at the Des Moines Register, Dennis Ryerson. Ryerson and the staff are putting out the paper during the floods, without running water or electricity; they work in daylight with pencils and typewriters. Ryerson was in the unique position to report on the near fistfight between the Des Moines mayor and its city council over the right time to turn on the city's water supply.\n\nForty year Hollywood veteran, and director of almost fifty films, Richard Fleischer. He's the son of the legendary cartoonist, Max Fleischer, who created Betty Boop. Richard Fleischer's films include \"20,000 Leagues Under the Sea\", \"Fantastic Voyage\", \"Doctor Doolittle\" and \"Conan The Destroyer\".\n\nSince the 1960s, Mitchell has been one of the most influential singer songwriters in popular music. We'll listen back to her 2004 Fresh Air interview.\n\nBacharach, who died Feb. 8, wrote hits in the '60s and early '70s with longtime collaborator Hal David. We listen to a 2010 interview with them.\n\nLewis came up in rock, but proved his country chops on the 1968 album Another Place, Another Time. The music suited his piano style, and the lyrics fit the emotions he brought to every performance."
