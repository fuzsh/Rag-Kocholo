        "text": "Motivation for Law School\n\nI enrolled in law school with a goal of helping people and securing financial stability for my family. Before law school, I worked as a health policy research assistant in Chicago, where I dealt with issues stemming from systemic racism such as redlining. This job, coupled with my personal background, fueled my desire to make a positive impact on people’s lives. Additionally, as an immigrant, I wanted a profession that could offer financial security for my family and repay them for their sacrifices. My Temple degree will give me an opportunity to do both now and in the future.\n\nExperiential Learning\n\nI enjoyed the experiential program at Temple because it allowed me to gain practical experience in criminal and civil legal work through clinics, practicums, and internships. It was a great privilege to represent clients in misdemeanor cases with the Defender Association of Philadelphia. I have had the opportunity to assist with civil rights litigation at Kairys, Rudovsky, Messing, Feinberg, and Lin LLP and the Pennsylvania Office of Attorney General. Additionally, interning for a federal judge gave me a chance to see the back end of litigation. These experiences provided me with an opportunity to apply what I learned in the classroom, leading to a more comprehensive learning experience.\n\nFaculty Mentors\n\nThroughout my time in law school, I have been fortunate to receive support and guidance from many faculty members. However, two individuals stand out for making a significant impact on my experience and future goals: Dean Ramji-Nogales and Professor Jules Epstein. During my first year, Dean Ramji-Nogales taught Civil Procedure and her exceptional teaching skills and ability to simplify complex material made it my favorite class. She also provided me with valuable advice and guidance throughout my law school career, including support during my job search. Professor Epstein, as one of the directors of the trial team, taught me about the art of lawyering. He generously shared his time and expertise to help me develop my advocacy skills. I am grateful for their mentorship and kindness, and hope to model their example in the future.\n\nBalancing Law School and Life\n\nLaw school can be a challenging experience, filled with its ups and downs. It is essential to equip yourself with tools of resilience and composure to overcome these obstacles. Personally, I faced a significant challenge during my time in law school. I was determined to excel and remove any distractions, but the pressure I put on myself made it hard to cope with the highs and lows. Therefore, I developed some tools and skills that have helped me deal with these challenges, including relying on a support group and creating a routine. Additionally, self-care techniques like therapy have been beneficial to me. Developing these skills early is essential, and I recommend taking advantage of the wellness programs offered by Temple’s Tuttleman Center, such as counseling, group and individual classes like yoga and meditation. With these, you will be better equipped to handle the ups and downs of law school and life."
