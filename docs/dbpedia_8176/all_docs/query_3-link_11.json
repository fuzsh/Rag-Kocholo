        "text": "When I met John Haggai in his Atlanta office over lunch , he told me he expected to be around till 120. But he has indeed accomplished more for the kingdom of God than someone who lived 120 years . Such was his zeal and his Impact. I told him that I did not believe that he could learn skiing at 75 plus – something he told us in person during our meeting in a HI seminar in Bangalore . His colleagues asked me to just touch his arms and I was astonished that at eighty five plus his muscles felt like iron. His passion for souls, his sense of humour make him stand out among the leaders who have left a legacy in this age and time. He had run his race well while teaching multitudes in all climes and nations also to run fast and fight well.\n\nOn behalf of the Haggai International Board of Trustees, I would like to say how sad we were to hear this morning of Dr Haggai’s death. This will be a sad time for us, but we rejoice and celebrate in knowing that Dr Haggai has been called to his eternal home and is now with his Lord and Savior.\n\nDr Haggai was a truly remarkable man of God, an inspiration to each and every one of us. We give thanks and praise for his life and the Haggai International Ministry.\n\nDr Colin Ellis HI UK Chair.\n\nIn 1991, I was aware of what God was calling me for, but I was struggling with lots of questions, not sure of how to organize myself, the ministry that God called me for, and really struggling with whether this will last. At that time, I was recommended to attend the then Haggai Institute in Singapore, now Haggai International. I read his books, I heard him speak. His faith journey and teachings in Singapore changed my perspective and equipped me for what God had called me for. Full time in youth ministry.\n\nI would trace the pioneering of Youth For Christ/Rwanda to my experience in Singapore, and the teachings that I got then served as the backbone of the growth of this ministry that I continue to lead in Rwanda.\n\nJohn Edmund Haggai’s faith in Christ was rock solid. His focus was razor sharp. He was clear about his purpose. Well equipped to influence other leaders. His sense of humor was always like the blood streams weaving between the points that he wanted to put across, but especially making them crystal clear to everyone.\n\nAfter losing my wife in 2015, my kids and I visited him in May 2016. He ministered to me, and my kids who were still so young remember that “Grandpa man that they met in Atlanta”. They tell me that he loves people so much.\n\nDr. Haggai ran his race. He accomplished his task. May we always ran the race that is before us. There are many more people who do not know Jesus Christ. May we remain focused on the one who called us, and continue the ministry of reaching the lost for Christ.\n\nJean Baptiste Mugarura\n\nNational Director of Youth For Christ/Rwanda"
