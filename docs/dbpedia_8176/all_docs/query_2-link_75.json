I'll have a look into it when I get home.\n\nI couldn't give Louisa's maiden name, because I can't find it! All I know about her is that she was born in Cardiff and that the two of them had 12 kids, two of which died. I found them in the census and I know Louisa had her last kid at age 48, but when the last kid was about 6, Edmund J had already died.\n\nHi Libby,\n\nWelcome to the forum, you don't give Louisa's maiden name.\n\nThis looks like them in the 1881 census :\n\nName: Edmond Stephens\n\nAge: 26\n\nEstimated Birth Year: abt 1855\n\nRelation: Head\n\nSpouse's Name: Louisa Stephens\n\nGender: Male\n\nWhere born: Cardiff, Glamorgan, Wales\n\nThanks very much. I did find them in the census, but I still can't get any other information, like Louisa's maiden name or Edmund/Edmond's parents to help me go back further.\n\nYes it's definitely them, looks like Louisa was English and they married in her Parish which was usual:\n\name: Edmund John Stephens\n\nBirth Year: abt 1853\n\nMarriage Date: 16 Jun 1874\n\nAge: 21\n\nFather: Edmund Stephens\n\nSpouse: Louisa Payre\n\nSpouse Age: 18\n\nSpouse Father: Charles Payre\n\nEvent Type: Marriage\n\nParish: Gloucester, St Luke, Gloucestershire, England\n\nParish as it Appears: St Luke\n\nAmanda\n\nThanks. The two of them were Welsh, but sometimes Wales and Gloucestershire and interchangeable on the Census for some reason. If you put \"Cardiff\" in as a search term, Gloucestershire turns up. Thanks. I reckon you found the answer there.\n\nYes it's definitely them, looks like Louisa was English and they married in her Parish which was usual:\n\name: Edmund John Stephens\n\nBirth Year: abt 1853\n\nMarriage Date: 16 Jun 1874\n\nAge: 21\n\nFather: Edmund Stephens\n\nSpouse: Louisa Payre\n\nSpouse Age: 18\n\nSpouse Father: Charles Payre\n\nEvent Type: Marriage\n\nParish: Gloucester, St Luke, Gloucestershire, England\n\nParish as it Appears: St Luke\n\nI think her name was Payne rather than Payre\n\nAmanda\n\nOK, so I checked this out and there was a Louisa Payne born in Cardiff in this year, so I reckon you cracked it. I was so stuck there for so long. The little trip to Gloucester may have been due to the fact that she was 5 months pregnant."
