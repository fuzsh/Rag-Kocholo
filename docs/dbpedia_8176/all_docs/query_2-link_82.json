        "text": "Today I come forward with just an honest question. Now it may seem like I'm being negative or complaining, but I assure I'm not. It's just a straight forward question I'm asking. LinkedIn is full of experts, both legitimate and self proclaimed, and they all have their opinions on what #jobseekers should and shouldn't be doing. So I ask, what is a job seeker to do when: - They've tweaked their resume numerous times and have several hundreds of versions of it. Yet they get no responses from applications. - They've reached out to former co-workers and friends to stay in touch and network but are met with minimal close ended responses - They've attempted to network and learn in their respective field but get an even lower response rate of close ended responses - They've hired career service professionals to aid and help refine their process, but no traction or results were achieved Yes the #jobsearch process is about playing the long game. But what are they to do when their job search has become multiple years long? Yes there are #recruiters and #headhunters, but what are job seekers to do when there is no interest from those respective parties? Its no fault of the recruiters or headhunters, they can only work on the job orders they have. I know this post may come across as negative or complaining, but I assure you that's not my attention. I am just asking an honest question about what are job seekers suppose to do when they've tried all these things and yet they still have no traction? By no means am I taking shots at anyone. This is just an honest post where I welcome thoughts, comments, and ideas. Thank you!"
