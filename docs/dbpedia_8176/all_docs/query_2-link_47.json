        "text": "Summary\n\nJohn Glover was a geologist whose expertise was in sedimentary petrology and geoarchaeology. For much of his career he was at the Department of Geology at the University of Western Australia, being Head of the Department from 1985 to 1988. His research was notable for its cross-disciplinary collaborations: he often worked with archaeologists, geographers and historians. Over a period of more that 20 years these collaborations resulted in a series of papers on the provenance of Aboriginal artefacts during last sea-level lowstand. Glover was active in professional organisations, being President of the Royal Society of Western Australia from 1961 to 1962 and Chairman of the Western Australian Division of the Geological Society of Australia. For long periods he was Editor of the journals produced by these organisations. His extensive publications included books on the history of geology and geologists in Western Australia."
