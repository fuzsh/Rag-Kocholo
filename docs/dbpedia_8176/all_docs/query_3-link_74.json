        "text": "Throughout the three seasons of filming Bridgerton and one season of Queen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story, the cast and crew have gotten to immerse themselves in some of England’s oldest, most beloved, and most stunning properties. As dedicated Bridgerverse fans, we know that first impressions are everything, so where you are is just as important as who you are in the ton.\n\nWhile filming in these locations can be logistically tricky and everyone on the set needs to be hyper-aware of their architectural and historical sensitivities, there is just something so majestic and awe-inspiring about being under the same roofs where historic dignitaries, kings and queens, dukes, and celebrities once were. Oh, and we mustn’t forget the ghosts!\n\nHere, we have some fun tidbits from Bridgerton historical expert Hannah Greig, showrunner Jess Brownell, head of production Sara Fischer, director and executive producer Tom Verica, and cinematographer Jeffrey Jur about the palaces, castles, manor homes, estates, gardens, and parks used in Bridgerton.\n\nBlenheim Palace (1722)\n\nBlenheim Palace is one of those places that looks like a palace but is technically a house. The sheer size of it makes it hard to believe that it’s not a palace, but as Fischer found out while filming there, the difference between a house and a palace is that if it was given to your ancestors by the Crown, it’s called a palace. And since Blenheim was built under the ownership of the Duke and Duchess of Marlborough, John and Sarah Churchill, it took on the royal moniker.\n\nBut in fact, Johnny boy wasn’t always a royal. The lad was born a commoner (read: from the upper class but not the aristocracy), and he’s one of the few men who were given the title of duke without having it in his bloodline.\n\nTaking up 1.45 million square feet, Blenheim is one of the United Kingdom’s largest houses and has 775 rooms, which are surrounded by seven acres of parkland, making it a Site of Special Scientific Interest. Today, it is home to Charles James (Jamie) Spencer-Churchill, the 12th duke of Marlborough. He was quite the rake in his heyday and as a child used to ride bikes through the corridors with his friends.\n\nAs of 2021, Blenheim has appeared in more films and TV shows (71) than any other English country house, which includes such films as Spectre, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, and Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix.\n\n“My favorite place to film is Blenheim Palace,” says Verica. “It is one of the grandest places we’ve filmed and has so much beauty inside and out. There is such a comfortable environment among the cast and crew, and it really makes it easy to slip into the period. And there’s so much history here — one of my favorite stories is that Winston Churchill was born here, in the coatroom!”\n\nChiswick House (1726)\n\nWhile we recently cited Chiswick House & Gardens as a notable Bridgerton filming location you can visit, we’ve now got more titillating information about this historic West London location.\n\n“At Chiswick House, we walk closely in the footsteps of the ton,” offers Bridgerton historical expert Hannah Greig. “Chiswick House was once home of the most famous members of London’s high society and a renowned leader of fashion, Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire. The wife of William Cavendish, fifth duke of Devonshire, Georgiana emerged as one of the greatest celebrities of her age — renowned for her beauty, her political and social influence, and scandalous love life. Much like Lady Whistledown, the Duchess of Devonshire wrote about the pleasures and pitfalls of life and love in high society in her anonymous novel The Sylph, published in 1778. This was one of the first published works written by an insider exposing what life was like for London’s ton. In Bridgerton, Chiswick is used to demonstrate the opulence and bustling sociability of London’s fashionable set, but for the Duchess of Devonshire it was a quiet country retreat, a place to escape from the demands of London life and a place she described as her ‘earthly paradise.’”\n\nNetflix, you paying attention?\n\nWilton House (1563)\n\nPalladian Bridge in the park At Wilton House.\n\n“I’d say my absolute favorite is Wilton House,” says Fischer. “It’s magnificent. We do promenading outside along a beautiful river with a stunning bridge in the ‘backyard’! Inside, there is the largest collection of paintings in the world, including the largest one he ever painted [a 1635 portrait of the fourth earl of Pembroke and his family, measuring 17 feet wide and 11 feet high]. And underneath that painting is a 12-foot needlepointed couch, which is amazing to see close up. Not to mention the ceiling paintings and the big gold and white doors that you see in the presentation scenes. In the anteroom, there are more priceless paintings, including a Rembrandt.”\n\nFor more than 400 years, the earls of Pembroke have inhabited Wilton House, a third of which is their residence. Lucky them! From the ninth century leading up to its new construction beginning in 1544 (and with a reconstruction in 1647 after a fire), it was the site of a nunnery, Wilton Abbey.\n\n“Although the Bridgerton crew take great care to protect all the historical furniture and fittings of the interior,” says Greig, “the same cannot be said of some of the original residents of Wilton House. In the [early 1700s], the owner of the house, Thomas Herbert, eighth earl of Pembroke, amused himself by turning to a little graffiti, using charcoal to draw eyes on all his statues.”\n\nTo escape the plague in London in 1603, King James I and his family escaped to Wilton House. The king, who had three long and serious relationships with men in his court and loved music, theater, and dance, made sure they were well entertained during their confinement: Shakespeare’s King’s Men performed for them, most likely his rom-com As You Like It.\n\nWilton House is Jur’s favorite as well. “We often film on the grounds for our ‘Rotten Row’ promenades, with the beautiful river and amazing Palladian bridge. Inside, the large Double Cube Room has been our primary Queen Charlotte diamond presentation space, with its spectacular decor and ceiling.”\n\nEven more impressive? According to the book , every king and queen of England since Edward VI in 1552 have come to Wilton for a little getaway. And pertaining to our Bridgerverse, the very last royal pair to stay were George III and Queen Charlotte, who spent two nights there in September 1778. “Their hosts, Henry, 10th Earl of Pembroke, and his Countess Elizabeth (née Spencer), were understandably worried that things should be just so,” the book reads. “Grand entertainments were staged in both the Single and Double Cube Rooms [both are often featured as film locations]. And much trouble was taken to source a suitable bed for the royal couple. This proved to be a waste of time: George and Charlotte turned up with their own snug double tent bed, which they placed in the Colonnade Room [a Bridgerton filming location].” Lest we forget, the family chaplain, the Reverend Dr. Thomas Eyre, lent a chamber pot to Charlotte and was reportedly delighted that Her Majesty deigned to use it!\n\nKingston Bagpuize House (1542)\n\nSince the early Medieval period in England, there has stood a manor house at Kingston. After the Battle of Hastings in 1066 — you know, the one where the French guy William the Conqueror conquered England and ushered in an entirely new system of feudalism and British aristocracy — William gifted Kingston to Norman magnate and administrator Henry de Ferrers, who was granted extensive lands throughout the country just because.\n\nBut enough about that — Kingston Bagpuize House, as it is known now, was built almost 500 years later, in 1542, and has had a string of aristocrat and politician owners over the subsequent centuries. In 1939, Miss Grace Charlotte Raphael was the house’s matron and a full-time member of the Women’s Auxiliary Police Corps during World War II. For a while, she housed evacuees from the London Blitz in the top-floor rooms of her home. When they left, officers of the Royal Air Force and the U.S. Air Force would occasionally take up residence.\n\n“Season three was the first time we used this location” says Brownell of the Mondriches’ new digs. “Though not completely in its original form, the land and some elements of the house date back to the 11th century, making it one of the oldest historical sites we use. With Bridgerton, we are no stranger to historical sites, yet some locations can feel a little daunting to be in; one feels that every stone, every piece of wood, every ornate furnishing is a piece of history, and therefore not that welcoming to those of us who are partial to clumsiness. While Kingston Bagpuize certainly retains its sense of deeply settled history, there is also a modernity that comes in its hospitable ambience. [It’s not] merely a house but a home. In terms of the show specifically, it was exciting to be with characters who get to find wonder and amazement in such a home, because it isn’t what they are used to. There is a funny charm in watching the Mondrich family come to terms with such a sprawling estate now being theirs, but just as the real-life family who live there today do, I’m sure the Mondrich family will create a wonderfully inviting space.”\n\nBasildon Park (1783)\n\nThe most important star at ? No, it’s not season three resident Lady Tilley Arnold. It’s the estate house’s bats! Because night shoots could disturb them, the National Trust stipulated for the Bridgerton production that filming lights had to be turned off at twilight for an hour, and then again at dawn for an hour and 40 minutes. There was a complete ban on lighting on one side of the house, as it is home to mama bats roosting. The shooting schedule had to be planned around these rules, and if you look closely enough, you may see one or two bats fly into shots as supporting artists!\n\nThe estate was built in 1783 by architect John Carr, whose fave style at the time was the revival of the classical and Palladian looks. Kevin McCloud, the host of Channel 4’s Grand Designs, thinks that Basildon might even be a copy of Italian Renaissance architect Andrea Palladio’s famous Villa Emo. Weirder still, parts of Basildon’s interiors are now in New York City’s Waldorf Astoria Hotel in the aptly named Basildon Room.\n\nBasildon Park also has some unique : While all the able-bodied men were off battling, the estate was run by … you guessed it: women! The Women’s Land Army took over Basildon Park, and about 60 of its members worked on the grounds, making cheese, charcoal, and bricks and working with the livestock. In 1918, Country Life magazine reported that just two of these women churned out an average of 3,000 bricks per week.\n\nClaydon House (1771)\n\nAs we mentioned previously in another recent story, was used in season three as the Featheringtons’ home, where Polin’s wedding breakfast was held. It’s also been used as a filming location many times before, notably in Emma (1996) and Far From the Madding Crowd (2015). But what you might not have realized about this 18th-century Georgian country home is that it is haunted by its former owner’s ghost.\n\nThere’s been a home on the land since the 1400s, and the Verney family resided there from 1620 until Claydon House was given to the National Trust in 1956. The last Verney to live there, Sir Edmund Verney, Sixth Baronet, left in 2019. He is a distant relative through marriage to Sir Edmund Verney, who was the chief standard bearer to King Charles I during the English Civil War (the Royalists versus the Parliamentarians). Edmund, a Royalist, natch, was captured and ordered to surrender the colors. Refusing, he said, “My life is my own, but my standard is the king’s,” so of course, they killed him on the spot. The Parliamentarians tried to pry the standard from his cold, dead fingers, but it wouldn’t budge. They cut his hand off, but the Royalists recaptured the banner in the battle, with that darned hand still clasped to it. The banner — and the hand — was sent back to Claydon to rest inside the family vault, but Sir Edmund’s body was never recovered. It is said that his body has returned to his home to roam the halls for all eternity in search of his missing hand.\n\nHampton Court Palace (1515)\n\nAll right. We made it to an actual palace! Hampton Court Palace was King Henry VIII’s favorite residence and was given to him by his chief minister, Cardinal Thomas Wolsey, so that Wolsey could get back in the king’s good favor. (If you haven’t watched The Tudors yet, put it on your to-watch list!) Interestingly, the last royal to reside at Hampton Court was King George II, the grandfather of our dearest “Mad King” George III from Queen Charlotte. But if you include ghosts, well, they’re still inhabiting the palace to this very day.\n\nIt is said that two of Henry’s six wives continue to haunt Hampton Court Palace. His third wife, Jane Seymour, died in 1537 shortly after giving birth to the king’s only male heir, Prince Edward. Over the years, there have been reports of a ghostly figure appearing on the stairs that lead up to Jane’s birthing room.\n\nThe king’s fifth wife, Catherine Howard, who was executed for adultery in 1542, has gotten far more reported sightings in the Haunted Gallery — named for her ghost’s ample activity there. At only 19, she was accused of adultery and treason and arrested at Hampton Court. She didn’t go down lightly, though, and screamed and ran away from the guards, desperately trying to beg Henry for mercy. She never did find him, though, and her ghost is still trying to fight for her everlasting soul.\n\nValentina Valentini is a London-based entertainment, travel, and food writer and is also a senior contributor to Shondaland.
