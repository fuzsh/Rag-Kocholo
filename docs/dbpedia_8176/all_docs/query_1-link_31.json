It should be understood that it is possible for a student to transfer in a large number of credits which, while accepted by the university, may exceed the maximum number of elective credits applicable to the degree.\n\nPermission to Complete Courses at Another Institution\n\nConsistent with the university policy students will not receive transfer credit for courses taken at another institution while they are matriculated at Temple University unless prior permission has been obtained. The required Permission to Take Courses Elsewhere workflow is available under the University Forms channel within Student Tools tab in TUportal. For more information, refer to Permission to Complete a Course at another Institution after Matriculation.\n\nGraduation Requirements\n\nThe Fox School of Business and Management requires students to complete a Graduation Review prior to registration for their final semester or, if active in Fly in 4, prior to their senior year. In addition, the University requires students to submit an application for graduation using the University online graduation application in Self Service Banner at the start of their last term in their academic program. Additional graduation information is available from the Office of the University Registrar.\n\nGrade Point Average Requirement for Graduation\n\nFox students are required to attain a 2.0 (2.0 = C) average in all of their Temple coursework and in their major in order to graduate from the Fox School of Business and Management. Some courses may have specific minimum grade requirements for degree applicability. Please check current course descriptions and the section pertaining to your major for this information.\n\nResidency Requirement\n\nA minimum of 45 of the last 60 semester hours must be completed in the Fox School of Business and Management at Temple University in order to receive a degree.

Duplicate credit in the same course is not awarded in any case.\n\nStudents will not receive credits for lower-level courses after successful completion of higher-level courses in sequenced courses of study. This only applies to the First Year Writing sequence in English (ENG 0701-ENG 0802) and all courses in Mathematics and Foreign Languages. For example, after passing SPAN 1002, a student will not receive credits for SPAN 1001.\n\nSemester hours earned in SRAP or ELECT, Preparatory Mathematics (formerly Mathematics 0001 or 0015), and lower-division (under 3000) Military Science courses do not yield academic credit toward the minimum total of 124.\n\nLife Experience\n\nThe Fox School of Business and Management does not offer credits for life experiences.

(Please see the Prerequisites and Co-requisites policy for more information.) Students are responsible for reviewing and abiding by all course prerequisites and co-requisites in the Course Catalog. The requirements are designed to assure that students are appropriately prepared to be successful in their courses. Prerequisites provide an efficient manner for students to register for the next course in a sequence for which they are prepared.\n\nDean's List\n\nEach fall and spring semester, those undergraduates who have met the credit hour and academic criteria for their school or college are placed on the Dean's List. See the Dean's List policy for specific GPA and credit-hour requirements.\n\nRepeating Courses\n\nUniversity policy restricts the number of times students can enroll in the same course to three times. Permission is required to register for the third attempt of the same course and is not guaranteed for all Fox majors. Students should work closely with an academic advisor to review their options when required to repeat a course. Students who fail to complete a required major course listed in their academic program will be required to change to a different major. For more information, see Repeating a Course and Policy 02.10.12.\n\nChange of Program\n\nNon-business students in their first semester at Temple or continuing students with 2.0 minimum cumulative GPA are eligible to request to change to a major in Fox. Information about the Fox Change of Program process is available on the Fox Advising web site.\n\nNon-business students with a cumulative GPA below 2.0 are not eligible to change to Fox. Instead students can change to Division of University Studies until they earn the 2.0 minimum cumulative GPA. While enrolled in Division of University Studies students are eligible to take some lower-division business requirements.\n\nDismissal from Fox\n\nIn accordance with Temple's repeat policy, students who fail to complete a \"College Graduation Requirement\" in three attempts will be required to change their program to one outside the Fox School of Business and Management.\n\nGrievance Procedures\n\nThe Fox School of Business and Management Ombudsperson assists students in Fox to resolve problems and conflicts that might arise from the classroom, acting as mediator between faculty and students while promoting alternatives to more formal processes. The ombudsperson supports effective communication, cooperation, equity, and civility in all academic and scholastic settings.

By participating in a robust year-long schedule of activities, students will be able to show fundamental skills in these competencies: Community Engagement, Ethics, Global/Cultural Awareness, Personal/Professional Development, and Financial Literacy.\n\nThe Fox School of Business and Management will expect all undergraduate students to earn 250 FLDP points by the end of each of their academic years. There are many low point activities (attending SPO meetings, speaker events, etc.) and numerous high point activities (internships, study abroad, etc.). Students will need to earn at least 20 points in each competency, but they can decide what they want to participate in. Once minimum point levels are reached in the competency areas, students will have the ability to earn remaining needed points in any area of specialization. They will also be able to \"level up\" in each competency area, displaying continual growth and development skill sets to potential employers. These demonstrated skills will also be viewable through the Comprehensive Learner Record (CLR).\n\nFor more information, please visit the Fox Leadership Development Program site.\n\nFox Laptop Mandate\n\nAll students are required to have their own laptop while in Fox. Students with laptops can use wired and wireless connections in many classrooms and labs, as well as throughout the buildings. Learn more about Fox's laptop policy.\n\nFaculty\n\nIn addition to the faculty list below, refer to the school's faculty and staff directory.\n\nAleksi Aaltonen, Assistant Professor, Department of Management Information Systems, Fox School of Business and Management; PhD, London School of Economics.\n\nEdoardo Airoldi, Millard E.
