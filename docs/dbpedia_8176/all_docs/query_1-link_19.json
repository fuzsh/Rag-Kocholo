Wikimedia Commons.\n\nIntroduction\n\nby Hani Kamee\n\nBiography\n\nGeorge Herbert (1593-1633) was born in Wales and grew to be one of the most lauded orators and poets of his generation. Herbert’s father died when he was three, leaving his mother with ten children, all of whom she was determined to educate and raise as loyal Anglicans. Herbert left for Westminster School at age ten and went on to become one of three to win scholarships to Trinity College, Cambridge. He went on to receive two degrees (a BA in 1613 and an MA in 1616) and was elected a major fellow of Trinity. Two years after his college graduation, he was appointed Reader in Rhetoric at Cambridge, and in 1620 he was elected public orator​a post wherein Herbert was called upon to represent Cambridge at public occasions and that he described as “the finest place in the university”(“George Herbert”). He would go on to serve in Parliament but ultimately gave up his secular life in favor of a quiet, parish post at St. Andrews’ church in Salisbury. Herbert was a conscientious and kind rector throughout his short life; he ultimately died of consumption at the age of 39 (“George Herbert”). His poems, often referred to as love poems to God, have caused him to be remembered as the greatest devotional poet in the English language.\n\nLiterary Context\n\nThe poems below, by the orator and Anglican cleric George Herbert (1593-1633), were first published in Herbert’s collection The Temple: Sacred Poems and Private Ejaculations which contains all of the poems he wrote in English (he also wrote in Greek and Latin) and was published posthumously.\n\nHe was part of the metaphysical tradition of English poetry, and all his poetry addressed religious themes (​“The Altar (Herbert Poem)”). “The Altar,” the most famous of the collection, is regularly called a “pattern poem” or “shape poem” in which the form of the poem on the page is meant to mirror its visual image (in this case, an altar; “Easter Wings” is another example). Herbert had a playful style; in any case, the term is useful, since it suggests that for Herbert everything—including the shapes of the sonnets—can contain religious meaning. Herbert is ranked amongst the best of religious Christian writers or poets, and this sonnet conveys the experience of faith through verse.\n\nWorks Cited\n\n“The Altar (Herbert Poem).” ​ Wikipedia​, Wikimedia Foundation, 5 Apr. 2019, en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Altar_(Herbert_poem).

Is it merely a “gimmick” or does it enhance meaning in this case?\n\nIs devotional poetry still relevant? Of what value is it to modern-day audiences?\n\nDo you think the rhyme scheme plays a major contribution to the poem? Why or why not?\n\nHow does the poem help the reader understand the relationship between George Herbert and God?\n\nCan these be read as love poems? Might this explain their enduring appeal?\n\nRise heart; thy Lord is risen. Sing his praise\n\nWithout delays,\n\nWho takes thee by the hand, that thou likewise\n\nWith him mayst rise:\n\nThat, as his death calcined thee to dust,\n\nHis life may make thee gold, and much more just.\n\nAwake, my lute, and struggle for thy part\n\nWith all thy art.\n\nThe cross taught all wood to resound his name,\n\nWho bore the same.\n\nHis stretched sinews taught all strings, what key\n\nIs best to celebrate this most high day.\n\nConsort both heart and lute, and twist a song\n\nPleasant and long:\n\nOr since all music is but three parts vied\n\nAnd multiplied;\n\nO let thy blessed Spirit bear a part,\n\nAnd make up our defects with his sweet art.\n\nI got me flowers to straw thy way:\n\nI got me boughs off many a tree:\n\nBut thou wast up by break of day,\n\nAnd brought’st thy sweets along with thee.\n\nThe Sun arising in the East,\n\nThough he give light, and th’East perfume;\n\nIf they should offer to contest\n\nWith thy arising, they presume.\n\nCan there be any day but this,\n\nThough many suns to shine endeavour?\n\nWe count three hundred, but we miss:\n\nThere is but one, and that one ever.\n\nEaster Wings\n\nLord, who createdst man in wealth and store,\n\nThough foolishly he lost the same,\n\nDecaying more and more,\n\nTill he became\n\nMost poore:\n\nWith thee\n\nO let me rise\n\nAs larks, harmoniously,\n\nAnd sing this day thy victories:\n\nThen shall the fall further the flight in me.\n\nMy tender age in sorrow did beginne\n\nAnd still with sicknesses and shame.\n\nThou didst so punish sinne,\n\nThat I became\n\nMost thinne.\n\nWith thee\n\nLet me combine,\n\nAnd feel thy victorie:\n\nFor, if I imp my wing on thine,\n\nAffliction shall advance the flight in me."
