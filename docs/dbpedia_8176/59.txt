Edmund John Niemann was a highly prolific and greatly celebrated landscape artist. His extremely large portfolio covered scenes across the length and breadth of Britain. His most famous works are those depicting the river Thames. Niemann was the son of a German banker. He followed in his father’s footsteps for a time, working as a clerk in Lloyds bank. In 1839, however, he decided to give up the pen and the bank records and take up the paintbrush and pursue art. Within a matter of years, he was exhibiting prolifically at the Royal Academy and the British Institution amongst other places. It is remarkable that no record remains of his receiving proper training, for his works are extremely accomplished. A portrait of Niemann potentially points to some artistic links, however. Niemann was painted by Edward Henry Corbould (1815-1905) in 1852. This could suggest the two were friends and that Niemann socialised within artistic circles, which would surely influence and encourage his work. Niemann’s greatest inspiration seems to be taken, however, from the work of Constable and Turner. These two formidable artists were the frontrunners in a quest to establish landscape painting as a distinguished and worthy artistic subject in the 19th-Century. The romantic, dramatic landscapes these two artists painted are very much evoked in Niemann’s work.
