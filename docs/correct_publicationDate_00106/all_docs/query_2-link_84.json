        "text": "Sciency Words is a special series here on Planet Pailly celebrating the rich and colorful world of science and science-related terminology. Today, we’re looking at the term:\n\nORBITAL RESONANCE\n\nThree of Jupiter’s moons, Io, Europa, and Ganymede, have a special relationship with each other. For every complete orbit of Ganymede, Europa completes exactly two orbits, and Io completes exactly four. This relationship is known as an orbital resonance.\n\nTo be more specific, Io, Europa, and Ganymede’s 4:2:1 relationship is called a Laplace resonance in honor of Pierre-Simon Laplace, the astronomer who first noticed it.\n\nAs the moons pass each other, they pull on each other gravitationally. This would happen with or without the resonance, but the resonance means these gravitational interactions are more regular and repetitive than similar interactions between other passing objects in space.\n\nThe persistent gravitational tug-of-wars between these three moons helps keep their interiors warm through a process called “tidal heating.” As a result, Ganymede and Europa appear to have oceans of liquid water beneath their surfaces. Meanwhile, poor Io keeps spewing sulfur all over itself.\n\nResonances can play an important role in shaping the rest of the Solar System as well. We’ve already seen how resonances with Jupiter created the Kirkwood gaps in the asteroid belt. A similar process created the gaps in Saturn’s rings, and a 3:2 resonance between Neptune and Pluto ensures that the two planets celestial objects won’t crash into each other.\n\nIt’s also worth noting that the Solar System is full of not-quite-perfect resonances. Earth and Mars almost have a 2:1 orbital resonance, as do Uranus and Neptune. Jupiter and Saturn almost have a 5:2 resonance. And Callisto (another of Jupiter’s moons) is so close to joining the resonance party. So close! It almost has a 7:3 resonance with Ganymede. (This list could go on for a while.)\n\nMaybe some of these resonances and near-resonances are pure coincidence. But it’s hard to believe they all are. There’s something about gravity that makes planets and moons want to resonate with each other. Science fiction writers might want to keep that in mind while designing new star systems.\n\nP.S.: It’s sometimes mistakenly assumed that Io, Europa, and Ganymede routinely “meet up” on the same side of Jupiter. In reality, whenever two of these moons line up with each other on the same side of their host planet, the third is always somewhere else—frequently the exact opposite side of the planet."
