        "text": "Don't know if any of this will help, it's from The Moons of Planet Jupiter by June Garmon.\n\nEUROPA\n\nPeriapsis: 664 862 km\n\nApoapsis: 676 938 km\n\nMean orbit radius: 670 900 km\n\nEccentricity: 0.009\n\nOrbital period: 3.551 181 d\n\nAverage orbital speed: 13.740 km/s\n\nInclination: 0.470° (to Jupiter's equator)\n\nOrbit and rotation\n\nEuropa orbits Jupiter in just over three and a half days, with an orbital radius of about\n\n670,900 km. With an eccentricity of only 0.009, the orbit itself is nearly circular, and the orbital\n\ninclination relative to the Jovian equatorial plane is small, at 0.470°. Like its fellow Galilean\n\nsatellites, Europa is tidally locked to Jupiter, with one hemisphere of the satellite constantly\n\nfacing the planet. Because of this, there is a sub-Jovian point on Europa's surface, from which\n\nJupiter would appear to hang directly overhead. Europa's prime meridian is the line intersecting\n\nthis point. Research suggests the tidal locking may not be full, as a non-synchronous rotation has\n\nbeen proposed: Europa spins faster than it orbits, or at least did so in the past. This suggests an\n\nasymmetry in internal mass distribution and that a layer of subsurface liquid separates the icy\n\ncrust from the rocky interior.\n\nThe slight eccentricity of Europa's orbit, maintained by the gravitational disturbances from the\n\nother Galileans, causes Europa's sub-Jovian point to oscillate about a mean position. As Europa\n\ncomes slightly nearer to Jupiter, the planet's gravitational attraction increases, causing the moon\n\nto elongate towards it. As Europa moves slightly away from Jupiter, the planet's gravitational\n\nforce decreases, causing the moon to relax back into a more spherical shape. The orbital\n\neccentricity of Europa is continuously pumped by its mean-motion resonance with Io. Thus, the\n\ntidal flexing kneads Europa's interior and gives the moon a source of heat, possibly allowing its\n\nocean to stay liquid while driving subsurface geological processes. The ultimate source of this\n\nenergy is Jupiter's rotation, which is tapped by Io through the tides it raises on Jupiter and is\n\ntransferred to Europa and Ganymede by the orbital resonance.\n\nCALLISTO\n\nPeriapsis: 1 869 000 km\n\nApoapsis: 1 897 000 km\n\nSemi-major axis: 1 882 700 km\n\nEccentricity: 0.007 4\n\nOrbital period: 16.689 018 4 d\n\nAverage orbital speed: 8.204 km/s\n\nInclination 0.192° (to local Laplace planes)\n\nOrbit and rotation\n\nCallisto is the outermost of the four Galilean moons of Jupiter. It orbits at a distance of\n\napproximately 1 880 000 km (26.3 times the 71 492 km radius of Jupiter itself). This is\n\nsignificantly larger than the orbital radius—1 070 000 km—of the next-closest Galilean satellite,\n\nGanymede. As a result of this relatively distant orbit, Callisto does not participate in the mean-\n\nmotion resonance—in which the three inner Galilean satellites are locked—and probably never\n\nhas.\n\nLike most other regular planetary moons, Callisto's rotation is locked to be synchronous with its\n\norbit. The length of the Callistoan day, simultaneously its orbital period, is about 16.7 Earth\n\ndays. Its orbit is very slightly eccentric and inclined to the Jovian equator, with the eccentricity\n\nand inclination changing quasi-periodically due to solar and planetary gravitational perturbations\n\non a timescale of centuries. The ranges of change are 0.0072–0.0076 and 0.20–0.60°,\n\nrespectively. These orbital variations cause the axial tilt (the angle between rotational and orbital\n\naxes) to vary between 0.4 and 1.6°.\n\nThe dynamical isolation of Callisto means that it has never been appreciably tidally heated,\n\nwhich has had important consequences for its internal structure and evolution. Its distance from\n\nJupiter also means that the charged-particle flux from the planet's magnetosphere at its surface is\n\nrelatively low—about 300 times lower than, for example, that at Europa. Hence, unlike the other\n\nGalilean moons, charged-particle irradiation has had a relatively minor effect on the Callistoan\n\nsurface. The radiation level at the surface of Callisto is equivalent to a dose of about 0.01 rem\n\n(0.1 mSv) per day.\n\nGANYMEDE\n\nPeriapsis: 1,069,200 km\n\nApoapsis: 1,071,600 km\n\nSemi-major axis: 1,070,400 km\n\nEccentricity: 0.0013\n\nOrbital period: 7.15455296 d\n\nAverage orbital speed: 10.880 km/s\n\nInclination: 0.20° (to Jupiter's equator)\n\nGanymede orbits Jupiter at a distance of 1,070,400 km, third among the Galilean satellites, and\n\ncompletes a revolution every seven days and three hours. Like most known moons, Ganymede is\n\ntidally locked, with one side of the moon always facing toward the planet. Its orbit is very\n\nslightly eccentric and inclined to the Jovian equator, with the eccentricity and inclination\n\nchanging quasi-periodically due to solar and planetary gravitational perturbations on a timescale\n\nof centuries. The ranges of change are 0.0009–0.0022 and 0.05–0.32°, respectively. These orbital\n\nvariations cause the axial tilt (the angle between rotational and orbital axes) to vary between 0\n\nand 0.33°.\n\nThe Laplace resonances of Ganymede, Europa, and Io\n\nGanymede participates in orbital resonances with Europa and Io: for every orbit of Ganymede,\n\nEuropa orbits twice and Io orbits four times. The superior conjunction between Io and Europa\n\nalways occurs when Io is at periapsis and Europa at apoapsis. The superior conjunction between\n\nEuropa and Ganymede occurs when Europa is at periapsis. The longitudes of the Io–Europa and\n\nEuropa–Ganymede conjunctions change with the same rate, making the triple conjunctions\n\nimpossible. Such a complicated resonance is called the Laplace resonance.\n\nThe current Laplace resonance is unable to pump the orbital eccentricity of Ganymede to a\n\nhigher value. The value of about 0.0013 is probably a remnant from a previous epoch, when such\n\npumping was possible. The ganymedian orbital eccentricity is somewhat puzzling; if it is not\n\npumped now it should have decayed long ago due to the tidal dissipation in the interior of\n\nGanymede. This means that the last episode of the eccentricity excitation happened only several\n\nhundred million years ago. Because the orbital eccentricity of Ganymede is relatively low—\n\n0.0015 on average—the tidal heating of this moon is negligible now. However, in the past\n\nGanymede may have passed through one or more Laplace-like resonances that were able to\n\npump the orbital eccentricity to a value as high as 0.01–0.02. This probably caused a significant\n\ntidal heating of the interior of Ganymede; the formation of the grooved terrain may be a result of\n\none or more heating episodes.\n\nThere are two hypotheses for the origin of the Laplace resonance among Io, Europa, and\n\nGanymede: that it is primordial and has existed from the beginning of the Solar System; or that it\n\ndeveloped after the formation of the Solar System. A possible sequence of events for the latter\n\nscenario is as follows: Io raised tides on Jupiter, causing its orbit to expand until it encountered\n\nthe 2:1 resonance with Europa; after that the expansion continued, but some of the angular\n\nmoment was transferred to Europa as the resonance caused its orbit to expand as well; the\n\nprocess continued until Europa encountered the 2:1 resonance with Ganymede. Eventually the\n\ndrift rates of conjunctions between all three moons were synchronized and locked in the Laplace\n\nresonance.\n\nIO\n\nPeriapsis: 420,000 km (0.002 807 AU)\n\nApoapsis: 423,400 km (0.002 830 AU)\n\nMean orbit radius: 421,700 km (0.002 819 AU)\n\nEccentricity: 0.0041\n\nOrbital period: 1.769 137 786 d (152 853.504 7 s, 42 h)\n\nAverage orbital speed: 17.334 km/s\n\nInclination: 2.21° (to the ecliptic) 0.05° (to Jupiter's\n\nequator)\n\nOrbit and rotation\n\nIo orbits Jupiter at a distance of 421,700 km (262,000 mi) from the planet's center and 350,000\n\nkm (217,000 mi) from its cloudtops. It is the innermost of the Galilean satellites of Jupiter, its\n\norbit lying between those of Thebe and Europa. Including Jupiter's inner satellites, Io is the fifth\n\nmoon out from Jupiter. It takes 42.5 hours to complete one orbit (fast enough for its motion to be\n\nobserved over a single night of observation). Io is in a 2:1 mean-motion orbital resonance with\n\nEuropa and a 4:1 mean-motion orbital resonance with Ganymede, completing two orbits of\n\nJupiter for every one orbit completed by Europa, and four orbits for every one completed by\n\nGanymede. This resonance helps maintain Io's orbital eccentricity (0.0041), which in turn\n\nprovides the primary heating source for its geologic activity. Without this forced eccentricity,\n\nIo's orbit would circularize through tidal dissipation, leading to a geologically less active world.\n\nLike the other Galilean satellites of Jupiter and the Earth's Moon, Io rotates synchronously with\n\nits orbital period, keeping one face nearly pointed toward Jupiter. This synchronicity provides\n\nthe definition for Io's longitude system. Io's prime meridian intersects the north and south poles,\n\nand the equator at the sub-Jovian point. The side of Io that always faces Jupiter is known as the\n\nsubjovian hemisphere, while the side that always faces away is known as the antijovian\n\nhemisphere. The side of Io that always faces in the direction that the moon travels in its orbit is\n\nknown as the leading hemisphere, while the side that always faces in the opposite direction is\n\nknown as the trailing hemisphere."
