Politics, sociology, and religious tolerance all find a place within his action-filled novels. The author has also proven his versatility by publishing humorous fantasies such as One for the Morning Glory, which mixes \"wit, whimsy, and wisdom in equal measures,\" according to Carl Hays in Booklist.\n\nOrbital Resonance, the first volume of his series titled \"The Century Next Door,\" is set mainly on an asteroid that has been put into orbit between Earth and Mars, to be used as a vehicle for conveying supplies to a ravaged Earth. Although the young people aboard the asteroid have psychologically been trained to remain loyal to their mission, they nevertheless rebel against the artificial lifestyle that has been forced on them. The novel provides an unflattering comment on society and is a \"thought-provoking book,\" wrote a Publishers Weekly reviewer. Mother of Storms is a futuristic disaster novel concerning a nuclear strike that unleashes tons of methane reserves, creating an intense atmospheric heat. Devastating global hurricanes result, causing millions of deaths. Astronaut Louie Tynan, who has super intelligence thanks to a computer system connected to his brain, devises a plan to protect the Earth from the sun's rays. A writer for Publisher's Weekly called Mother of Storms a \"winning blend of gripping thriller and dazzling SF\" that established Barnes as \"one of the most able and impressive\" of contemporary science fiction writers. Hays, reviewing the novel for Booklist, noted that Barnes \"masterfully juggles many narrative elements,\" and that his \"sheer storytelling power combined with hard-edged speculative science … makes this one of the best disaster novels ever.\"\n\nIn One for the Morning Glory Barnes tried his hand at light-hearted fantasy. The story features Prince Amatus, who as a toddler sips some forbidden, magical wine that renders him one-half invisible. Over the course of the story, he grows to manhood, becomes visible, and gains control of his throne. The book was praised for its \"intelligent world-building, well-chosen detail, smooth prose and deft characterization\" by a Publishers Weekly reviewer.\n\nIn 1996 Barnes published a novel written with former Apollo astronaut Buzz Aldrin, the second man to walk on the moon. Encounter with Tiber combines speculation on the future of space flight with a story of first contact with alien intelligence. Hays, reviewing the novel for Booklist, termed it \"fascinating.\" In another collaboration with Aldrin titled The Return, the authors tell the story of four people who, as adolescents in 1969, pledge to meet in fifty years on Mars. Some thirty years later, they find themselves and the U.S. space program far from able to make the trip to the red planet. Their personal stories are interwoven with a suspenseful tale of nuclear war and general communications failure. Library Journal reviewer Patrick Wall found the storyline \"interesting,\" and added: \"There is an innocent quality to this book … at times, it is like reading an old-fashioned boys' adventure story.\"\n\nKaleidoscope Century, the second book in \"The Century Next Door\" series, is highly characteristic of Barnes's work. As Gerald Jonas noted in his New York Times Book Review appraisal of the novel, \"Mr. Barnes knows how to wring suspense from [his characters'] predicament.\" The predicament in this case is the cost of immortality on Mars that, by the year 2109, has been purposefully transformed to enable its surface to sustain human life. Into this world comes Joshua Ali Quare, an on-call thug for the Soviet cause. In appreciation of his work, Joshua is granted unending life by K.G.B. agents during a quasi-Cold War, although the drug that they give him causes him to suffer total memory loss every fifteen years. A born survivor with a lust for power, Joshua must repeatedly reconstruct his life, a situation that makes him increasingly surly. Eventually teamed with a fellow murderer named Sadi—who can be counted on to live up to the promise implied by his name—Joshua soon rises to the head of the nefarious pseudo-Soviet organization, his ultimate goal being to gain supreme power. According to Janice M. Eisen in her Washington Post Book World review, Jonas is \"one of the nastiest characters in recent science fiction.\" The reviewer called Kaleidoscope Century \"an impressive piece of work,\" but was somewhat unnerved by Joshua's brutality and unrepentant demeanor.\n\nApostrophes and Apocalypses is a collection of a dozen short stories by Barnes, along with several essays of his thoughts on the writing process. The essays on writing are the high point of the volume, according to Roberta Johnson in Booklist, who found that these \"demonstrate how thoughtful and talented a writer\" Barnes is. Johnson concluded that \"his cheerful practical advice and consistently entertaining stories make up a collection that really packs literary punch.\"\n\nBarnes took on an epic-scale story with a series of books that includes A Million Open Doors, Earth Made of Glass, and The Merchants of Souls. The setting is the world of the Thousand Cultures—civilizations that came from a common origin generations ago but have been isolated for many years due to the huge distances between them. The advent of a technology that allows for instantaneous travel brings with it a host of ethical and cultural challenges. One continuing storyline examines the moral implications of what to do with \"recorded personalities,\" which can be implanted in artificial or human hosts. Some people would treat these personalities as disposable playthings, while others insist on their dignity as persons. Discussing The Merchants of Souls for Publishers Weekly, one reviewer wrote that Barnes created \"well-developed characters\" and \"well-wrought environments like sterile, intellectually incestuous Earth, where anything can be discussed but nothing has meaning.\" Jackie Cassada, writing in Library Journal, commented that \"strong characters and exotic backgrounds\" enhanced the \"fast-paced action and subtle manipulations\" of the plot.\n\nAs this story opens, Giraut Leones, the twenty-ninth-century hero, has failed in his attempt to avoid the planetary disaster that concluded Earth Made of Glass, and has lost all those dear to him, including his wife and best friend. He is presented with a new challenge posed by a group of capitalists who are packaging and selling personalities, a threat inconceivable to the Thousand Cultures, which holds to high ideals. In the next installment, The Armies of Memory, Giraut Leones is close to retirement but has one final mission: to find a cache of secrets that threaten the Thousand Cultures. His father now resides in an eight-year-old body, and his former wife is his boss. A Kirkus Reviews contributor described this third book as being \"thoughtful, well plotted and intriguingly populated—the best so far in a worthwhile series.\"\n\nAnother Barnes series features eighteen-year-old Jak Jinnaka. The first book, Duke of Uranium, is set in the thirty-sixth century. Protagonist Jak's girlfriend, Sesh, is kidnapped, and Jak's Uncle Sib is the agent whose mission is to find her. Sesh is actually a princess from the plant Greenworld, a nation of the Aerie at the Earth/Sun L4 point. Jak becomes a courier in an attempt to rescue Sesh and finds himself entangled in more danger than he had anticipated. The characters include other teen friends who all take on new responsibilities and grow in maturity.\n\nIn the second book, A Princess of the Aerie, Jak and two friends travel to Greenworld to find that Sesh, now Princess Shyf, is so cruel that she killed her own father to gain power. Jak and his friends find themselves banished to Mercury after battling Shadow on the Frost, an old foe. As the series continues, it becomes suited to more mature readers.\n\nIn the Hall of the Martian King opens to find Jak, now a secret agent, at home in the Hive (Earth/Sun L5 point) and accepting a job on the Martian moon Deimos. The action revolves around a set of principles sought after by all involved. Rich Horton, who reviewed the book for SF Site, wrote: \"All this leads to an amusing series of comedies of errors, as various attempts are made to obtain (by fair means or foul) the lifelog. Much of the book is rather funny, and much is quite exciting.\"\n\nBarnes's stand-alone novels include several that are set in the near future and have technology-based plots. They include Finity and Gaudeamus, in which Barnes is the narrator and the best friend of the protagonist, spy Travis Bismarck. Also figuring prominently in Gaudeamus is a prostitute named Lena Logan, who deals in pharmaceuticals that offer enhanced sex and telepathy. A Publishers Weekly reviewer wrote: \"This fascinating book is quite unlike anything else on the market today.\" Barnes once told CA: \"I am a theater historian who writes as a sideline. I don't even like to read very much any more, but I have found that a good adventure story permits the writer to express unlimited, bitter satire with impunity. My birth family was severely dysfunctional, weird, and secretive. This has been a great help to me as a writer, since I've had to learn things as an adult that most people learn unconsciously as children.\"\n\nBIOGRAPHICAL AND CRITICAL SOURCES:\n\nBOOKS\n\nTwentieth-Century Science-Fiction Writers, St. James Press (Detroit, MI), 1995.\n\nPERIODICALS\n\nAnalog Science Fiction and Fact, October, 1988, review of Sin of Origin, p. 181; March, 1992, review of Orbital Resonance, p. 159; February, 1993, Tom Easton, review of A Million Open Doors, p. 161; December, 1994, review of Mother of Storms, p. 164; November, 1995, review of Kaleidoscope Century, p. 160; July, 1996, Tom Easton, review of One for the Morning Glory, p. 273; April, 1997, Peter L.
