For instance, the primary astronomical eccentricity cycle due to the secular frequency term (g2subscript𝑔2g_{2}italic_g start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT−--g5subscript𝑔5g_{5}italic_g start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 5 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT) (∼similar-to\\sim∼405 kyr in the recent past) utilized in deep-time analyses is dominated by Venus’ and Jupiter’s orbits, aka long eccentricity cycle. The widely accepted and long-held view is that (g2subscript𝑔2g_{2}italic_g start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT−--g5subscript𝑔5g_{5}italic_g start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 5 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT) was practically stable in the past and may hence be used as a “metronome” to reconstruct accurate ages and chronologies. However, using state-of-the-art integrations of the solar system, we show here that (g2subscript𝑔2g_{2}italic_g start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT−--g5subscript𝑔5g_{5}italic_g start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 5 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT) can become unstable over long time scales, without major changes in, or destabilization of, planetary orbits. The (g2subscript𝑔2g_{2}italic_g start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT−--g5subscript𝑔5g_{5}italic_g start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 5 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT) disruption is due to the secular resonance σ12=(g1−g2)+(s1−s2)subscript𝜎12subscript𝑔1subscript𝑔2subscript𝑠1subscript𝑠2\\mbox{$\\sigma_{12}$}=(g_{1}-g_{2})+(s_{1}-s_{2})italic_σ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 12 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = ( italic_g start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT - italic_g start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) + ( italic_s start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT - italic_s start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ), a major contributor to solar system chaos. We demonstrate that entering/exiting the σ12subscript𝜎12\\sigma_{12}italic_σ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 12 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT resonance is a common phenomenon on long time scales, occurring in ∼similar-to\\sim∼40% of our solutions. During σ12subscript𝜎12\\sigma_{12}italic_σ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 12 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT-resonance episodes, (g2subscript𝑔2g_{2}italic_g start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT−--g5subscript𝑔5g_{5}italic_g start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 5 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT) is very weak or absent and Earth’s orbital eccentricity and climate-forcing spectrum are unrecognizable compared to the recent past. Our results have fundamental implications for geology and astrochronology, as well as climate forcing because the paradigm that the longest Milanković cycle dominates Earth’s astronomical forcing, is stable, and has a period of ∼similar-to\\sim∼405 kyr requires revision.\n\nSolar System (1528) — Orbital dynamics (1184) — Dynamical evolution (421) — Planetary climates (2184) — Orbital resonances (1181)\n\n††software: orbitN, github.com/rezeebe/orbitN; on Zenodo: zenodo.org/records/8021040, OrbitN (2023).\n\n1 Introduction\n\nLaying the foundations of chaos theory, Henri Poincaré wrote: “It may happen that small differences in the initial conditions produce very great ones in the final phenomena. A small error in the former will produce an enormous error in the latter. Prediction becomes impossible ……\\ldots…” (Poincaré, 1914). In reference to the solar system, the sensitivity to initial conditions is indeed a key feature of the large-scale dynamical chaos in the system, which has been confirmed numerically (Sussman & Wisdom, 1988; Laskar, 1989; Ito & Tanikawa, 2002; Morbidelli, 2002; Varadi et al., 2003; Batygin & Laughlin, 2008; Zeebe, 2015; Brown & Rein, 2020; Abbot et al., 2023). Dynamical chaos affects the secular frequencies gisubscript𝑔𝑖g_{i}italic_g start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT and sisubscript𝑠𝑖s_{i}italic_s start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT (see Appendix A), where the terms (g4subscript𝑔4g_{4}italic_g start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 4 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT−--g3subscript𝑔3g_{3}italic_g start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 3 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT) and (s4subscript𝑠4s_{4}italic_s start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 4 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT−--s3subscript𝑠3s_{3}italic_s start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 3 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT), for instance, show chaotic behavior already on a 50-Myr time scale. As a result, astronomical solutions diverge around t=±50𝑡plus-or-minus50t=\\pm 50italic_t = ± 50 Myr, which fundamentally prevents identifying a unique solution on time scales ∼>superscriptsimilar-to\\stackrel{{\\scriptstyle>}}{{\\sim}}\\ start_RELOP SUPERSCRIPTOP start_ARG ∼ end_ARG start_ARG > end_ARG end_RELOP1088{}^{8}start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT 8 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT y (Laskar et al., 2004; Zeebe, 2017; Zeebe & Lourens, 2019). The chaos therefore not only severely limits our understanding and ability to reconstruct and predict the solar system’s history and long-term future, it also imposes strict limits on geological and astrochronological applications such as developing a fully calibrated astronomical time scale beyond ∼similar-to\\sim∼50 Ma (for recent efforts, see Zeebe & Lourens, 2019, 2022). In contrast to these limitations (largely due to unstable terms such as (g4subscript𝑔4g_{4}italic_g start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 4 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT−--g3subscript𝑔3g_{3}italic_g start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 3 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT) and (s4subscript𝑠4s_{4}italic_s start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 4 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT−--s3subscript𝑠3s_{3}italic_s start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 3 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT)), another frequency term appears more promising as it shows more stable behavior. For example, it has hitherto been assumed that (g2subscript𝑔2g_{2}italic_g start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT−--g5subscript𝑔5g_{5}italic_g start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 5 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT) was practically stable in the past and has been suggested for use as a “metronome” in deep-time geological applications, i.e., far exceeding 50 Ma (Laskar et al., 2004; Kent et al., 2018; Spalding et al., 2018; Meyers & Malinverno, 2018; Montenari, 2018; Lantink et al., 2019; De Vleeschouwer et al., 2024). The (g2subscript𝑔2g_{2}italic_g start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT−--g5subscript𝑔5g_{5}italic_g start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 5 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT) cycle, which is the dominant term in Earth’s orbital eccentricity in the recent past (∼similar-to\\sim∼405 kyr, see Fig. 1a) may thus have been regarded as an island of stability in a sea of chaos. However, we show in this contribution that also (g2subscript𝑔2g_{2}italic_g start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT−--g5subscript𝑔5g_{5}italic_g start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 5 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT) can become unstable over long time scales.\n\nSolar system dynamics affect Earth’s orbital evolution, as well as Earth’s climate, which is paced by astronomical cycles on time scales ∼>superscriptsimilar-to\\stackrel{{\\scriptstyle>}}{{\\sim}}\\ start_RELOP SUPERSCRIPTOP start_ARG ∼ end_ARG start_ARG > end_ARG end_RELOP10 kyr. The cycles include precession and obliquity cycles of Earth’s spin axis (∼similar-to\\sim∼20 and 40 kyr in the recent past), and the short and long eccentricity cycles (∼similar-to\\sim∼100 and 405 kyr, see Figs. 1a and 6) (Milanković, 1941; Montenari, 2018). Orbital eccentricity is controlled by the solar system’s orbital dynamics and is the focus of this study. The primary tuning target used in astrochronology and cyclostratigraphy for deep-time stratigraphic age models is the long eccentricity cycle (LEC) because it is widely assumed to be stable in the past (see above). Dynamically, Earth’s orbital eccentricity and inclination cycles originate from combinations of the solar system’s fundamental frequencies, called g𝑔gitalic_g- and s𝑠sitalic_s-frequencies (or modes), loosely related to the apsidal and nodal precession of the planetary orbits (Fig. A.1). The LEC is dominated by Venus’ and Jupiter’s orbits, viz., (g2−g5)g_{2}-g_{5})italic_g start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT - italic_g start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 5 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ), or g25subscript𝑔25g_{25}italic_g start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 25 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT for short, and represents the strongest cycle in Earth’s eccentricity spectrum in the recent past (see Figs. 1 and 6). Assuming a stable LEC may appear plausible because Jupiter (dominating g5subscript𝑔5g_{5}italic_g start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 5 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT) is the most massive planet and less susceptible to perturbations. Astronomical computations have confirmed g5subscript𝑔5g_{5}italic_g start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 5 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT’s stability and hitherto did not indicate instabilities in g25subscript𝑔25g_{25}italic_g start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 25 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT (Berger, 1984; Quinn et al., 1991; Varadi et al., 2003; Laskar et al., 2004; Zeebe, 2017; Spalding et al., 2018; Zeebe & Lourens, 2022). However, compared to g5subscript𝑔5g_{5}italic_g start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 5 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, g2subscript𝑔2g_{2}italic_g start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT’s long-term stability is less certain but has been overlooked so far. The long-term stability of g25subscript𝑔25g_{25}italic_g start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 25 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT and the LEC is critical for, e.g., climate forcing/insolation, constructing accurate age models and chronologies, expanding the evidence for the astronomical theory of climate into the more distant past, extending the astronomically calibrated geological time scale into deep time, and more (see discussion). Below we show that the LEC can become unstable over long-time scales owing to g2subscript𝑔2g_{2}italic_g start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, without major changes in, or destabilization of, planetary orbits. Orbital destabilization is a known, separate dynamical phenomenon relevant to the future, see below.\n\nFor the present study, we performed state-of-the-art solar system integrations, including the eight planets and Pluto, a lunar contribution, general relativity, the solar quadrupole moment, and solar mass loss (see Section 2) (Zeebe, 2017; Zeebe & Lourens, 2019; Zeebe, 2022, 2023). Initial conditions at time t0subscript𝑡0t_{0}italic_t start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 0 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT were taken from the latest JPL ephemeris DE441 (Park et al., 2021) and the equations of motion were numerically integrated to t=−3.5𝑡3.5t=-3.5italic_t = - 3.5 Gyr (beyond −3.53.5-3.5- 3.5 Gyr parameters such as the lunar distance have large uncertainties, see Section 2). Owing to solar system chaos, the solutions diverge around t=−50𝑡50t=-50italic_t = - 50 Myr, which prevents identifying a unique solution on time scales ∼>superscriptsimilar-to\\stackrel{{\\scriptstyle>}}{{\\sim}}\\ start_RELOP SUPERSCRIPTOP start_ARG ∼ end_ARG start_ARG > end_ARG end_RELOP1088{}^{8}start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT 8 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT y (see above). Hence we present results from long-term ensemble integrations to explore the possible solution/phase space of the system (see Section 2). Importantly, because of the chaos, each ∼similar-to\\sim∼108superscript10810^{8}10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 8 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT y interval of the integrations represents a snapshot of the system’s general/possible behavior that is largely independent of the actual numerical time of a particular solution (provided here that t<−τ12𝑡subscript𝜏12t<-\\mbox{$\\tau_{12}$}italic_t < - italic_τ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 12 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, where τ12subscript𝜏12\\tau_{12}italic_τ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 12 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT is of order 108superscript10810^{8}10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 8 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT to 109superscript10910^{9}10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 9 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT y, see below). In other words, a numerical solution’s behavior around, say, t=−1.5𝑡1.5t=-1.5italic_t = - 1.5 Gyr may represent the actual solar system around t=−600𝑡600t=-600italic_t = - 600 Myr and so on.\n\n2 Methods\n\n2.1 Solar System Integrations\n\nSolar system integrations were performed following our earlier work (Zeebe, 2017; Zeebe & Lourens, 2019; Zeebe, 2022) with our integrator package orbitN (v1.0) (Zeebe, 2023), using a symplectic integrator and Jacobi coordinates (Wisdom & Holman, 1991; Zeebe, 2015a). The open source code is available at zenodo.org/records/8021040 and github.com/rezeebe/orbitN. The methods used here and our integrator package have been extensively tested and compared against other studies (Zeebe, 2017; Zeebe & Lourens, 2019; Zeebe, 2022, 2023). For the present study, we also included simulations with an independent integrator package (HNBody) (Rauch & Hamilton, 2002) and found the same dynamical behavior. All simulations include contributions from general relativity, available in orbitN as Post-Newtonian effects due to the dominant mass. The Earth-Moon system was modeled as a gravitational quadrupole (Quinn et al., 1991; Varadi et al., 2003; Zeebe, 2017, 2023). Initial conditions for the positions and velocities of the planets and Pluto were generated from the latest JPL ephemeris DE441 (Park et al., 2021) using the SPICE toolkit for Matlab. Coordinates were obtained at JD2451545.0 in the ECLIPJ2000 reference frame and subsequently rotated to account for the solar quadrupole moment (J2subscript𝐽2J_{2}italic_J start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT) alignment with the solar rotation axis (Zeebe, 2017). Solar mass loss was included using M˙/M=−7×10−14˙𝑀𝑀7superscript1014\\dot{M}/M=-7\\times 10^{-14}over˙ start_ARG italic_M end_ARG / italic_M = - 7 × 10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - 14 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT y−11{}^{-1}start_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT - 1 end_FLOATSUPERSCRIPT (e.g., Quinn et al., 1991). As solar mass loss causes a secular drift in total energy, we added test runs with M=c⁢o⁢n⁢s⁢t.𝑀𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑡M=const.italic_M = italic_c italic_o italic_n italic_s italic_t . to check the integrator’s numerical accuracy. Total energy and angular momentum errors were small throughout the 3.5-Gyr integrations (relative errors: ∼<superscriptsimilar-to\\stackrel{{\\scriptstyle<}}{{\\sim}}\\ start_RELOP SUPERSCRIPTOP start_ARG ∼ end_ARG start_ARG < end_ARG end_RELOP6×10−106superscript10106\\times 10^{-10}6 × 10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - 10 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT and ∼<superscriptsimilar-to\\stackrel{{\\scriptstyle<}}{{\\sim}}\\ start_RELOP SUPERSCRIPTOP start_ARG ∼ end_ARG start_ARG < end_ARG end_RELOP7×10−127superscript10127\\times 10^{-12}7 × 10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - 12 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT, see Fig. 2). Our default numerical timestep (|Δ⁢t|=4Δ𝑡4|\\Delta t|=4| roman_Δ italic_t | = 4 days) is close to the previously estimated value of 3.59 days to sufficiently resolve Mercury’s perihelion (Wisdom, 2015; Hernandez et al., 2022; Abbot et al., 2023). In additional eight simulations, we tested |Δ⁢t|=2.15625Δ𝑡2.15625|\\Delta t|=2.15625| roman_Δ italic_t | = 2.15625 days (adequate to e☿∼<0.4superscriptsimilar-tosubscript𝑒☿0.4\\mbox{$e_{\\scriptsize\\mercury}$}\\ \\raisebox{-2.15277pt}{$\\stackrel{{% \\scriptstyle<}}{{\\sim}}\\ $}0.4italic_e start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ☿ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_RELOP SUPERSCRIPTOP start_ARG ∼ end_ARG start_ARG < end_ARG end_RELOP 0.4) and found no difference in terms of σ12subscript𝜎12\\sigma_{12}italic_σ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 12 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT-resonances (see below), which occurred in 3/8 solutions.\n\n2.2 Ensemble Integrations\n\nWe performed ensemble integrations of the solar system with a total of N=64𝑁64N=64italic_N = 64 members. Note that a larger N𝑁Nitalic_N is unnecessary for the current problem, which samples a common phenomenon (∼similar-to\\sim∼40% of solutions), not a rare event, which requires large N𝑁Nitalic_N (Abbot et al., 2023). Different solutions were obtained by offsetting Earth’s initial position by a small distance (largest offset Δ⁢x0≃1×10−12similar-to-or-equalsΔsubscript𝑥01superscript1012\\Delta x_{0}\\simeq 1\\times 10^{-12}roman_Δ italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 0 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ≃ 1 × 10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - 12 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT au), which is within observational uncertainties (Zeebe, 2015, 2017). The different Δ⁢x0Δsubscript𝑥0\\Delta x_{0}roman_Δ italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 0 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT lead to complete randomization of solutions on a time scale of ∼similar-to\\sim∼50 Myr due to solar system chaos. We also tested different histories of the Earth-Moon distance (R𝑅Ritalic_R), which has little effect on our results (see Section 2.3). Because of the large uncertainties in R𝑅Ritalic_R prior to ∼similar-to\\sim∼3333 Ga, we restrict our integrations to t=−3.5𝑡3.5t=-3.5italic_t = - 3.5 Gyr. Our solutions are available at www.ncdc.noaa.gov/paleo/study/xxxxx and www2.hawaii.edu/~zeebe/Astro.html.\n\n2.3 Past Earth-Moon distance\n\nOur integrations included a lunar contribution, i.e., a gravitational quadrupole model of the Earth-Moon system (Quinn et al., 1991; Varadi et al., 2003; Zeebe, 2017, 2023). In the present context, the lunar contribution has a relatively small effect on the overall dynamics, yet the integration requires the Earth-Moon distance (R𝑅Ritalic_R) as parameter at a given time in the past. We tested two approaches, both avoiding the known problem of unrealistically small R𝑅Ritalic_R at −3.53.5-3.5- 3.5 Gyr (see Fig. 3). (i𝑖iitalic_i) A linear extrapolation of R𝑅Ritalic_R into the past starting with d⁢R0/d⁢t𝑑subscript𝑅0𝑑𝑡dR_{0}/dtitalic_d italic_R start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 0 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT / italic_d italic_t close to the present rate and (i⁢i𝑖𝑖iiitalic_i italic_i) a 3rd-order polynomial fit to observations. The two approaches made essentially no difference in our computations and both yielded solutions including σ12subscript𝜎12\\sigma_{12}italic_σ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 12 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT-resonance intervals at a similar frequency (see below). For the observational constraints on R𝑅Ritalic_R, we selected robust data sets based on the reconstruction of Earth’s axial precession frequency obtained by cyclostratigraphic studies (Meyers & Malinverno, 2018; Lantink et al., 2022; Sørensen et al., 2020; De Vleeschouwer, D. e⁢t⁢a⁢l𝑒𝑡𝑎𝑙et~{}alitalic_e italic_t italic_a italic_l, 2023) (see Fig. 3). The classical integration of precession equations starting at the present rate d⁢R0/d⁢t𝑑subscript𝑅0𝑑𝑡dR_{0}/dtitalic_d italic_R start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 0 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT / italic_d italic_t (see Fig. 3, green dashed line) follows MacDonald (1964); Goldreich (1966); Touma & Wisdom (1994).\n\n2.4 Time series analysis of astronomical solutions\n\nThe solar system’s fundamental g𝑔gitalic_g- and s𝑠sitalic_s-frequencies were determined from the output of our numerical integrations using fast Fourier transform (FFT) over consecutive 20-Myr intervals. For the spectral analysis (see Figs. 4 and 5), we used Earth’s orbital elements and the classic variables:\n\nh=e⁢sin⁡(ϖ)ℎ𝑒italic-ϖ\\displaystyle h=e\\sin(\\varpi)\\quaditalic_h = italic_e roman_sin ( italic_ϖ ) ; k=e⁢cos⁡(ϖ)𝑘𝑒italic-ϖ\\displaystyle\\quad k=e\\cos(\\varpi)italic_k = italic_e roman_cos ( italic_ϖ ) (1) p=sin⁡(I/2)⁢sin⁡Ω𝑝𝐼2Ω\\displaystyle p=\\sin(I/2)\\ \\sin\\mbox{$\\Omega$}\\quaditalic_p = roman_sin ( italic_I / 2 ) roman_sin roman_Ω ; q=sin⁡(I/2)⁢cos⁡Ω,𝑞𝐼2Ω\\displaystyle\\quad q=\\sin(I/2)\\ \\cos\\mbox{$\\Omega$}\\ ,italic_q = roman_sin ( italic_I / 2 ) roman_cos roman_Ω , (2)\n\nwhere e𝑒eitalic_e, I𝐼Iitalic_I, ϖitalic-ϖ\\varpiitalic_ϖ, and ΩΩ\\Omegaroman_Ω are eccentricity, inclination, longitude of perihelion, and longitude of ascending node, respectively. The spectra for Earth’s k𝑘kitalic_k and q𝑞qitalic_q, for example, show strong peaks at nearly all g𝑔gitalic_g- and s𝑠sitalic_s-frequencies, respectively (see Fig. 5). The g𝑔gitalic_g- and s𝑠sitalic_s-modes are loosely related to the apsidal and nodal precession of the planetary orbits (see Fig. A.1). However, there is generally no simple one-to-one relationship between a single mode and a single planet, particularly for the inner planets. The system’s motion is a superposition of all modes, although for the outer planets, some modes are dominated by a single planet.\n\n2.5 Resonant angle\n\nThe resonant angle θ12subscript𝜃12\\theta_{12}italic_θ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 12 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT associated with the σ12subscript𝜎12\\sigma_{12}italic_σ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 12 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT resonance (see Eq. (6)) was determined following Lithwick & Wu (2011). The method is numerically efficient and easy to implement. Consider Eqs. (1) and (2), and use sin⁡(I/2)≃I/2similar-to-or-equals𝐼2𝐼2\\sin(I/2)\\simeq I/2roman_sin ( italic_I / 2 ) ≃ italic_I / 2 (applicable to small I𝐼Iitalic_I, as in our solutions). The variable pairs (h,k)ℎ𝑘(h,k)( italic_h , italic_k ) and 2⁢(p,q)2𝑝𝑞2(p,q)2 ( italic_p , italic_q ) can then be combined into two complex variables for each planet (ı^=−1^italic-ı1\\hat{\\imath}=\\sqrt{-1}over^ start_ARG italic_ı end_ARG = square-root start_ARG - 1 end_ARG):\n\nzksubscript𝑧𝑘\\displaystyle z_{k}italic_z start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUBSCRIPT =\\displaystyle== ek⁢exp⁡(ı^⁢ϖk)subscript𝑒𝑘^italic-ısubscriptitalic-ϖ𝑘\\displaystyle e_{k}\\exp(\\hat{\\imath}\\ \\varpi_{k})italic_e start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_exp ( over^ start_ARG italic_ı end_ARG italic_ϖ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) (3) ζksubscript𝜁𝑘\\displaystyle\\zeta_{k}italic_ζ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUBSCRIPT =\\displaystyle== Ik⁢exp⁡(ı^⁢Ωk),subscript𝐼𝑘^italic-ısubscriptΩ𝑘\\displaystyle I_{k}\\exp(\\hat{\\imath}\\ \\mbox{$\\Omega$}_{k})\\ ,italic_I start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUBSCRIPT roman_exp ( over^ start_ARG italic_ı end_ARG roman_Ω start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_k end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) , (4)\n\nwhere index k=M,V,E,…,N𝑘𝑀𝑉𝐸…𝑁k=M,V,E,\\ldots,Nitalic_k = italic_M , italic_V , italic_E , … , italic_N refers to the planets.

(5)\n\n3 Results\n\n3.1 Secular frequencies and eccentricity\n\nContrary to expectations, we found in ∼similar-to\\sim∼40% of the solutions that g25subscript𝑔25g_{25}italic_g start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 25 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT was not stable at a period P25≃405similar-to-or-equalssubscript𝑃25405\\mbox{$P_{25}$}\\simeq 405italic_P start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 25 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ≃ 405 kyr but shifted abruptly due to shifts in g2subscript𝑔2g_{2}italic_g start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT (Fig. 4). Importantly, in those cases the g2subscript𝑔2g_{2}italic_g start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT spectral peak usually split into two peaks at significantly reduced power (Fig. 5), resulting in a very weak or absent LEC (Fig. 6). Note that for, e.g., geological applications, the weak/absent LEC is crucial, not the actual value of the P25subscript𝑃25P_{25}italic_P start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 25 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT shift (Fig. B.1), which is immaterial because it would be unidentifiable in a stratigraphic record owing to the low g25subscript𝑔25g_{25}italic_g start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 25 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT power. Time series analysis of the solutions (see Section 2) revealed that the weak LEC intervals are associated with a secular resonance between the g𝑔gitalic_g- and s𝑠sitalic_s-modes dominated by Mercury and Venus (|g1−g2|≃|s1−s2|similar-to-or-equalssubscript𝑔1subscript𝑔2subscript𝑠1subscript𝑠2|g_{1}-g_{2}|\\simeq|s_{1}-s_{2}|| italic_g start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT - italic_g start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT | ≃ | italic_s start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT - italic_s start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT |), dubbed σ12subscript𝜎12\\sigma_{12}italic_σ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 12 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT:\n\nσ12=(g1−g2)+(s1−s2).subscript𝜎12subscript𝑔1subscript𝑔2subscript𝑠1subscript𝑠2\\displaystyle\\mbox{$\\sigma_{12}$}=(g_{1}-g_{2})+(s_{1}-s_{2})\\ .italic_σ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 12 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = ( italic_g start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT - italic_g start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) + ( italic_s start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT - italic_s start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) . (6)\n\nSeveral observations lend confidence to the robustness of our astronomical computations. (i𝑖iitalic_i) The methods used here and our integrator package have been extensively tested and compared against other studies (Zeebe, 2017; Zeebe & Lourens, 2019; Zeebe, 2022, 2023). (i⁢i𝑖𝑖iiitalic_i italic_i) The σ12subscript𝜎12\\sigma_{12}italic_σ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 12 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT resonance was recognized previously, although to our knowledge only by two studies (Lithwick & Wu, 2011; Mogavero & Laskar, 2022) and not its effect on g25subscript𝑔25g_{25}italic_g start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 25 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT/LEC (see below). (i⁢i⁢i𝑖𝑖𝑖iiiitalic_i italic_i italic_i) We tested an independent integrator package (HNBody Rauch & Hamilton (2002), see Section 2) and found the same dynamical behavior. (i⁢v𝑖𝑣ivitalic_i italic_v) Re-examination of previous 5-Gyr future integrations from this group (Zeebe, 2015) also revealed various solutions with σ12subscript𝜎12\\sigma_{12}italic_σ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 12 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT-resonance intervals. (v𝑣vitalic_v) Total energy and angular momentum errors were small throughout our present 3.5-Gyr integrations (relative errors in test runs: ∼<superscriptsimilar-to\\stackrel{{\\scriptstyle<}}{{\\sim}}\\ start_RELOP SUPERSCRIPTOP start_ARG ∼ end_ARG start_ARG < end_ARG end_RELOP6×10−106superscript10106\\times 10^{-10}6 × 10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - 10 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT and ∼<superscriptsimilar-to\\stackrel{{\\scriptstyle<}}{{\\sim}}\\ start_RELOP SUPERSCRIPTOP start_ARG ∼ end_ARG start_ARG < end_ARG end_RELOP7×10−127superscript10127\\times 10^{-12}7 × 10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - 12 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT, Fig. 2) and our numerical timestep sufficiently resolves Mercury’s perihelion (Wisdom, 2015; Hernandez et al., 2022; Abbot et al., 2023) (see Section 2).\n\nDuring σ12subscript𝜎12\\sigma_{12}italic_σ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 12 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT-resonance episodes, Earth’s orbital eccentricity pattern and hence Earth’s climate forcing spectrum due to eccentricity becomes unrecognizable compared to the recent past (Figs. 1 and 6). For example, a geologist examining a climate record exhibiting Milanković cycles within the σ12subscript𝜎12\\sigma_{12}italic_σ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 12 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT resonance (e.g., Fig. 6b-d) would fail to identify the rhythm as eccentricity cycles, given the currently known pattern (Fig. 6a). The resonance motifs are so different that (coincidentally) some frequency and amplitude modulation (AM) features (Fig. 6c) show more similarities with Mars’ orbital inclination in the recent past (Fig. C.1) (Zeebe, 2022) than Earth’s eccentricity (Fig. 6a). The estimated time scale τ12subscript𝜏12\\tau_{12}italic_τ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 12 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT for a possible σ12subscript𝜎12\\sigma_{12}italic_σ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 12 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT-resonance occurrence (τ12=subscript𝜏12absent\\mbox{$\\tau_{12}$}=italic_τ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 12 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT = temporal distance to the present) is of order 108superscript10810^{8}10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 8 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT to 109superscript10910^{9}10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 9 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT y. In several solutions, we found reduced g2subscript𝑔2g_{2}italic_g start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT and g25subscript𝑔25g_{25}italic_g start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 25 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT power (lower than short eccentricity power), as well as unusual eccentricity patterns, at t∼<−500superscriptsimilar-to𝑡500t\\ \\raisebox{-2.15277pt}{$\\stackrel{{\\scriptstyle<}}{{\\sim}}\\ $}-500italic_t start_RELOP SUPERSCRIPTOP start_ARG ∼ end_ARG start_ARG < end_ARG end_RELOP - 500 Myr (see e.g., Fig. 6d) and in one solution at t≃−420similar-to-or-equals𝑡420t\\simeq-420italic_t ≃ - 420 Myr. However, we have so far tested only 64 solutions (see Section 2), hence the youngest possible age of a σ12subscript𝜎12\\sigma_{12}italic_σ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 12 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT-resonance interval that could be detectable in the geologic record is yet unknown. The duration of a σ12subscript𝜎12\\sigma_{12}italic_σ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 12 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT-resonance episode may range from a few Myr to tens of millions of years (multiple entries/exits often occurring over several 100 Myr, see Figs. 6 and 9).\n\n3.2 Insolation and climatic precession\n\nThe total mean annual insolation (or energy W𝑊Witalic_W) Earth’s receives is a function of its orbital eccentricity (e♁subscript𝑒♁e_{\\scriptsize\\earth}italic_e start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ♁ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT):\n\nW∝(1−e♁2)−12.proportional-to𝑊superscript1superscriptsubscript𝑒♁212\\displaystyle W\\propto\\left(1-\\mbox{$e_{\\scriptsize\\earth}$}^{2}\\right)^{-% \\frac{1}{2}}\\ .italic_W ∝ ( 1 - italic_e start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ♁ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ) start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - divide start_ARG 1 end_ARG start_ARG 2 end_ARG end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT . (7)\n\nIn the recent past, 0⁢∼<e♁∼<⁢0.060∼<e♁∼<0.060\\ \\raisebox{-2.15277pt}{$\\stackrel{{\\scriptstyle<}}{{\\sim}}\\ $}\\mbox{$e_{% \\scriptsize\\earth}$}\\raisebox{-2.15277pt}{$\\stackrel{{\\scriptstyle<}}{{\\sim}}% \\ $}0.060 ∼< e♁ ∼< 0.06, whereas during σ12subscript𝜎12\\sigma_{12}italic_σ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 12 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT-resonance episodes, max⁡{e♁}subscript𝑒♁\\max\\{\\mbox{$e_{\\scriptsize\\earth}$}\\}roman_max { italic_e start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ♁ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT } may be as low as ∼similar-to\\sim∼0.04 (Fig. 6c). Thus, the relative variation/difference in W𝑊Witalic_W between eccentricity maxima and minima ((1−02)−12=1)superscript1superscript02121((1-0^{2})^{-\\frac{1}{2}}=1)( ( 1 - 0 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ) start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - divide start_ARG 1 end_ARG start_ARG 2 end_ARG end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT = 1 ) is substantially reduced by the factor:\n\n((1−0.062)−12−1)/((1−0.042)−12−1)/superscript1superscript0.062121superscript1superscript0.042121\\displaystyle\\left((1-0.06^{2})^{-\\frac{1}{2}}-1\\right)\\ \\left/\\ \\left((1-0.04% ^{2})^{-\\frac{1}{2}}-1\\right)\\ \\right.( ( 1 - 0.06 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ) start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - divide start_ARG 1 end_ARG start_ARG 2 end_ARG end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - 1 ) / ( ( 1 - 0.04 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ) start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - divide start_ARG 1 end_ARG start_ARG 2 end_ARG end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT - 1 ) =2.25.absent2.25\\displaystyle=2.25\\ .= 2.25 . (8)\n\nThus, in addition to a weak/absent LEC, both the total variation in eccentricity climate forcing and the extreme values are diminished on a 106superscript10610^{6}10 start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT 6 end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT-year time scale during σ12subscript𝜎12\\sigma_{12}italic_σ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 12 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT intervals. Moreover, the σ12subscript𝜎12\\sigma_{12}italic_σ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 12 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT resonance causes major changes in climatic precession (p¯¯𝑝\\bar{p}over¯ start_ARG italic_p end_ARG), the primary climate driver on the shortest Milanković time scale (∼similar-to\\sim∼20 kyr in the recent past). The main p¯¯𝑝\\bar{p}over¯ start_ARG italic_p end_ARG frequencies are given by Ψ+giΨsubscript𝑔𝑖\\Psi+g_{i}roman_Ψ + italic_g start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, where ΨΨ\\Psiroman_Ψ is the lunisolar precession frequency. The disruption of g2subscript𝑔2g_{2}italic_g start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT (and hence Ψ+g2Ψsubscript𝑔2\\Psi+g_{2}roman_Ψ + italic_g start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT) causes major changes in p¯¯𝑝\\bar{p}over¯ start_ARG italic_p end_ARG’s total amplitude and AM (see Figs. 7 and 8). For example, during σ12subscript𝜎12\\sigma_{12}italic_σ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 12 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT-resonance intervals, the forcing power at the Ψ+g2Ψsubscript𝑔2\\Psi+g_{2}roman_Ψ + italic_g start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT precession frequency may drop by orders of magnitudes compared to the recent past (Fig. 8). The altered forcing in both, eccentricity and climatic precession, would scale down the climate response to orbital forcing, and hence its expression in geological sequences, as well as affect threshold behavior for triggering orbitally forced climate events (for recent examples such as the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum and the Eocene hyperthermals, see Zeebe & Lourens (2019)).\n\n3.3 σ12subscript𝜎12\\sigma_{12}italic_σ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 12 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT resonance\n\nIn a quasi-periodic (non-chaotic) system, the fundamental frequencies are constant over time. In contrast, the solar system’s frequencies change over time owing to dynamical chaos (Fig. 4), priming the system to enter/exit the σ12subscript𝜎12\\sigma_{12}italic_σ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 12 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT resonance over long time scales. Several solar system resonances have been studied previously, including (g1−g5)−(s1−s2)subscript𝑔1subscript𝑔5subscript𝑠1subscript𝑠2(g_{1}-g_{5})-(s_{1}-s_{2})( italic_g start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT - italic_g start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 5 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) - ( italic_s start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT - italic_s start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) and 2⁢(g4−g3)−(s4−s3)2subscript𝑔4subscript𝑔3subscript𝑠4subscript𝑠32(g_{4}-g_{3})-(s_{4}-s_{3})2 ( italic_g start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 4 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT - italic_g start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 3 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) - ( italic_s start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 4 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT - italic_s start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 3 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) (Laskar, 1990; Sussman & Wisdom, 1992; Batygin et al., 2015; Ma et al., 2017; Zeebe, 2022; Abbot et al., 2023). However, to our knowledge only two studies recognized σ12subscript𝜎12\\sigma_{12}italic_σ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 12 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, yet did not investigate its consequences for g25subscript𝑔25g_{25}italic_g start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 25 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT and Earth’s orbital eccentricity (Lithwick & Wu, 2011; Mogavero & Laskar, 2022). σ12subscript𝜎12\\sigma_{12}italic_σ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 12 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT may be characterized by the resonant angle θ12subscript𝜃12\\theta_{12}italic_θ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 12 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT (see Eq. (5)), where ϖ*superscriptitalic-ϖ\\varpi^{*}italic_ϖ start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT * end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT and Ω*superscriptΩ\\mbox{$\\Omega$}^{*}roman_Ω start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT * end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT are associated with the g𝑔gitalic_g- and s𝑠sitalic_s-modes (analog to longitude of perihelion and ascending node, but not of individual planets, see Appendix A). Chaos is often associated with resonant angles that alternate between circulation and libration (Fig. 9). Generally, θ12subscript𝜃12\\theta_{12}italic_θ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 12 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT circulated in our solutions without σ12subscript𝜎12\\sigma_{12}italic_σ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 12 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT-resonance episodes, whereas θ12subscript𝜃12\\theta_{12}italic_θ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 12 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT-circulation and libration occurred in solutions that showed σ12subscript𝜎12\\sigma_{12}italic_σ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 12 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT-resonance episodes and a weak/absent LEC. The latter case was usually associated with intervals of slightly elevated eccentricity in Mercury’s orbit (0.25⁢∼<e☿∼<⁢0.350.25∼<e☿∼<0.350.25\\ \\raisebox{-2.15277pt}{$\\stackrel{{\\scriptstyle<}}{{\\sim}}\\ $}\\mbox{$e_{% \\scriptsize\\mercury}$}\\raisebox{-2.15277pt}{$\\stackrel{{\\scriptstyle<}}{{\\sim}% }\\ $}0.350.25 ∼< e☿ ∼< 0.35, see Fig. 9).\n\nImportantly, none of our solutions showed high eccentricities (e☿∼>0.4superscriptsimilar-tosubscript𝑒☿0.4\\mbox{$e_{\\scriptsize\\mercury}$}\\ \\raisebox{-2.15277pt}{$\\stackrel{{% \\scriptstyle>}}{{\\sim}}\\ $}0.4italic_e start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ☿ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT start_RELOP SUPERSCRIPTOP start_ARG ∼ end_ARG start_ARG > end_ARG end_RELOP 0.4), which could indicate progressing chaotic behavior or a potential destabilization of the inner solar system — known, separate dynamical phenomena, most relevant to future chaos, studied previously (Laskar, 1990; Sussman & Wisdom, 1992; Lithwick & Wu, 2011; Batygin et al., 2015; Zeebe, 2015; Brown & Rein, 2020; Abbot et al., 2023). Solutions displaying any significant destabilization in the past can of course be excluded (incompatible with the solar system’s known history). Furthermore, given that all our solutions showed at most slightly elevated e☿subscript𝑒☿e_{\\scriptsize\\mercury}italic_e start_POSTSUBSCRIPT ☿ end_POSTSUBSCRIPT demonstrates that the system can enter/exit the σ12subscript𝜎12\\sigma_{12}italic_σ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 12 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT resonance without major changes in, or destabilization of, planetary orbits. Thus, past σ12subscript𝜎12\\sigma_{12}italic_σ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 12 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT-resonance episodes and a weak LEC are a possible and likely dynamical phenomenon, present in ∼similar-to\\sim∼40% of our solutions.\n\n4 Implications\n\nWe anticipate far-reaching consequences of our findings for (i𝑖iitalic_i) exploring the effects of secular resonances (particularly σ12subscript𝜎12\\sigma_{12}italic_σ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 12 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT) on the long-term dynamical evolution, chaos, and planetary climates in the solar system, (i⁢i𝑖𝑖iiitalic_i italic_i) understanding and unraveling Earth’s past climate forcing and climate change via parameters including eccentricity (total insolation) and climatic precession (see Eq. (7) and Figs. 1, 6, 7, 8), (i⁢i⁢i𝑖𝑖𝑖iiiitalic_i italic_i italic_i) reconstructing the solar system’s chaotic dynamics constrained by geologic evidence (Ma et al., 2017; Meyers & Malinverno, 2018; Zeebe & Lourens, 2019; Olsen et al., 2019), (i⁢v𝑖𝑣ivitalic_i italic_v) expanding the evidence for the astronomical theory of climate in yet understudied parts of Earth’s history (e.g., the Precambrian), (v𝑣vitalic_v) studying effects of deep-time Milanković forcing on Earth’s environmental and climatic long-term evolution, and (v⁢i𝑣𝑖viitalic_v italic_i) extending the astronomically calibrated geological time scale (Montenari, 2018; Zeebe & Lourens, 2022) into deep time.\n\nIt appears that the σ12subscript𝜎12\\sigma_{12}italic_σ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 12 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT secular resonance and its effect on solar system dynamics and planetary climates has been understudied thus far. To our knowledge, only two studies recognized σ12subscript𝜎12\\sigma_{12}italic_σ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 12 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, yet did not investigate its consequences on, for instance, (g2subscript𝑔2g_{2}italic_g start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT−--g5subscript𝑔5g_{5}italic_g start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 5 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT) and Earth’s orbital eccentricity (Lithwick & Wu, 2011; Mogavero & Laskar, 2022). Several of the secular modes (or terms) related to the gisubscript𝑔𝑖g_{i}italic_g start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT and sisubscript𝑠𝑖s_{i}italic_s start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT (or differences between pairs) show multiple, strong interactions for i=1,…⁢4𝑖1…4i=1,\\ldots 4italic_i = 1 , … 4. In other words, secular resonances usually affect multiple frequency pairs. For example, as shown here, the σ12subscript𝜎12\\sigma_{12}italic_σ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 12 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT resonance has a major impact on (g1subscript𝑔1g_{1}italic_g start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT−--g2subscript𝑔2g_{2}italic_g start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT) and (s1subscript𝑠1s_{1}italic_s start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT−--s2subscript𝑠2s_{2}italic_s start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT), but also on (g2subscript𝑔2g_{2}italic_g start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT−--g5subscript𝑔5g_{5}italic_g start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 5 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT). Moreover, because there is no simple one-to-one relationship between a single mode and a single inner planet (the motion is a superposition of all modes), resonances (say σi⁢jsubscript𝜎𝑖𝑗\\sigma_{ij}italic_σ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i italic_j end_POSTSUBSCRIPT with i,j=1,…⁢4formulae-sequence𝑖𝑗1…4i,j=1,\\ldots 4italic_i , italic_j = 1 , … 4, i≠j𝑖𝑗i\\neq jitalic_i ≠ italic_j) affect the entire inner solar system. Here, we have only investigated σ12subscript𝜎12\\sigma_{12}italic_σ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 12 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT’s effect on (g2subscript𝑔2g_{2}italic_g start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT−--g5subscript𝑔5g_{5}italic_g start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 5 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT) and Earth’s orbital eccentricity. Future work should explore whether there are other important, yet unknown, effects of σ12subscript𝜎12\\sigma_{12}italic_σ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 12 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT (and other resonances) on the dynamics and planetary climates in the inner solar system.\n\nOur results have fundamental implications for, e.g., current astrochronologic and cyclostratigraphic practices, which are based on the paradigm that the LEC is stable, dominates the eccentricity spectrum, and has a period of ∼similar-to\\sim∼405 kyr. Given our findings that the σ12subscript𝜎12\\sigma_{12}italic_σ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 12 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT resonance is a common phenomenon (occurring in ∼similar-to\\sim∼40% of our solutions), the assumption of a stable 405 kyr cycle in deep time can no longer be made. Specifically, the possibility of an unstable period and weakened LEC amplitude requires rethinking of currently employed strategies for building accurate and high-resolution (‘floating’ or radio-isotopically anchored) astrochronologic age models. The presumed 405-kyr “metronome” was particularly important for constructing pre-Cenozoic age models, where reliable astronomical solutions are absent owing to solar system chaos. Deep-time astrochronologies have thus far critically relied on identification of the LEC because it is the only Milanković cycle whose period has been widely regarded as stable (Laskar et al., 2004; Kent et al., 2018; Spalding et al., 2018) and of sufficiently large amplitude to be typically expressed in sedimentary sequences. Our results indicate that, prior to several hundred Myrs in the past, the LEC may have become unstable over multi-million year intervals. Notably, on these time scales the periods of other critical Milanković parameters (climatic precession and obliquity) are also more uncertain due to changes in the Earth-Moon system’s tidal evolution.\n\nDoes the presently explored geologic record provide examples consistent with our astronomical calculations? We note here a recently discovered section in the ∼similar-to\\sim∼2.46 Ga Joffre Member of the Brockman Iron Formation (Joffre Falls, Western Australia), in which a dominant short eccentricity cycle was reported (∼similar-to\\sim∼100 kyr), compared to a relatively weak expression at the scale of the interpreted LEC (Lantink et al., 2022) (see Fig. D.1). The interpreted eccentricity modulation pattern in the Joffre Falls section differs from typical Cenozoic precession-eccentricity dominated records, which often display a strong 1:4 hierarchy of long vs. short eccentricity cycles. One first-order interpretation for the unusual bundling pattern is a complex nonlinear response of the paleoclimate and/or sedimentary system to orbital forcing, which is still poorly understood for the ancient deposits. Yet, given our findings, a fundamentally different pattern of Earth’s orbital eccentricity variations (i.e., a weakened LEC) at the time of deposition provides an alternative explanation (see Fig. D.1). Further investigations are required to confirm past σ12subscript𝜎12\\sigma_{12}italic_σ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 12 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT-resonance episodes in geologic sequences. We propose that future exploration of high-quality and rhythmic sediment successions (especially of Precambrian age) will be critical in constraining the LEC’s past stability and hence the history of the solar system’s chaotic evolution.\n\nGenerally, the possibility of an unstable/weak LEC argues strongly for internal consistency checks and tests of eccentricity-related cycles interpreted in stratigraphic sequences at multiple levels. For example, future studies need to include consistency checks between the period of short eccentricity and associated g𝑔gitalic_g-frequencies and the period of the interpreted (g4−g3)subscript𝑔4subscript𝑔3(g_{4}-g_{3})( italic_g start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 4 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT - italic_g start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 3 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ) cycle and/or other very long period eccentricity modulations. At a more advanced level, the internal consistency of all g𝑔gitalic_g- and s𝑠sitalic_s-frequencies that can be extracted from the sequence need to be examined, for which algorithms are already available (Meyers & Malinverno, 2018; Olsen et al., 2019). Furthermore, the uncertainty in LEC stability substantially increases the ambiguity in interpreting cycle ratios of the eccentricity-precession forcing. Hence, independent sedimentation rate checks (preferably from accurate radiometric ages) will become inevitable to verify deep-time Milanković interpretations based on observed stratigraphic cycle hierarchy. Moreover, when significant obliquity signals are present, eccentricity-related cycle pattern will be more difficult to distinguish from those expected for obliquity.\n\nAcknowledgments.

Note that there is generally no simple one-to-one relationship between a single mode and a single planet, though some outer planets may dominate a single mode. e𝑒eitalic_e, I𝐼Iitalic_I, ϖitalic-ϖ\\varpiitalic_ϖ, and ΩΩ\\Omegaroman_Ω are eccentricity, inclination, longitude of perihelion, and longitude of ascending node, respectively. g𝑔gitalic_g-modes are related to e𝑒eitalic_e and ϖitalic-ϖ\\varpiitalic_ϖ; e𝑒eitalic_e usually varies between some extreme values (black double arrows) and ϖitalic-ϖ\\varpiitalic_ϖ characterizes the apsidal precession; ϖitalic-ϖ\\varpiitalic_ϖ may librate (oscillate) or circulate for solar system orbits. The planetary gisubscript𝑔𝑖g_{i}italic_g start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT’s are positive, hence for circulating ϖitalic-ϖ\\varpiitalic_ϖ, the time-averaged apsidal precession is prograde (i.e., in the same direction as the orbital motion, see large colored arrows). The s𝑠sitalic_s modes are related to I𝐼Iitalic_I and ΩΩ\\Omegaroman_Ω; I𝐼Iitalic_I usually varies between some extreme values (black double arrows) and ΩΩ\\Omegaroman_Ω characterizes the nodal precession; ΩΩ\\Omegaroman_Ω may librate or circulate. The planetary sisubscript𝑠𝑖s_{i}italic_s start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_i end_POSTSUBSCRIPT’s are negative, hence for circulating ΩΩ\\Omegaroman_Ω, the time-averaged nodal precession is retrograde (i.e., in the opposite direction as the orbital motion, see large colored arrows). Given conservation of total angular momentum (𝑳𝑳Lbold_italic_L), there exists an invariable plane perpendicular to 𝑳𝑳Lbold_italic_L, which is fixed in space. It follows that one of the s𝑠sitalic_s frequencies is zero (s5subscript𝑠5s_{5}italic_s start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 5 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT, see main text).\n\nAppendix B Period of (g2subscript𝑔2g_{2}italic_g start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT−--g5subscript𝑔5g_{5}italic_g start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 5 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT)\n\nThe secular frequency g2subscript𝑔2g_{2}italic_g start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT shows large and rapid shifts (spikes, see Fig. 4) at specific times when the spectral g2subscript𝑔2g_{2}italic_g start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT peak splits into two peaks at significantly reduced power during σ12subscript𝜎12\\sigma_{12}italic_σ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 12 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT-resonance episodes (see Fig. 5). Alternating maximum power between the two peaks then causes the spikes in g2subscript𝑔2g_{2}italic_g start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 2 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT and hence in g25subscript𝑔25g_{25}italic_g start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 25 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT (Fig. B.1). As a result, g25subscript𝑔25g_{25}italic_g start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 25 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT is unstable and weak/absent during σ12subscript𝜎12\\sigma_{12}italic_σ start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 12 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT-resonance intervals. Note that for, e.g., geological applications, the weak/absent LEC is crucial, not the actual value of the P25subscript𝑃25P_{25}italic_P start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 25 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT shift, which is immaterial because it would be unidentifiable in a stratigraphic record owing to the low g25subscript𝑔25g_{25}italic_g start_POSTSUBSCRIPT 25 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT power.\n\nAppendix D Section at Joffre Falls, Western Australia\n\nIn the recently discovered Joffre Falls section (∼similar-to\\sim∼2.46 Ga, Western Australia), a dominant short eccentricity cycle was reported (∼similar-to\\sim∼100 kyr) and a relatively weak expression of the LEC (Lantink et al., 2022) (see Fig. D.1). The regular medium-scale (∼similar-to\\sim∼85 cm) alternations of thicker units of banded iron formation and thinner, softer interval of a more shaley lithology (Fig. D.1, left) have been interpreted as the expression of short eccentricity (Lantink et al., 2022). Horizons highlighted in blue (Fig. D.1, left) correspond to cycle numbers in the original log (Lantink et al., 2022) shown on the right. Note the larger-scale modulations in the thickness and relief of the shaley beds (degree of weathering) forming two distinctive darker ’bundles’ defined by cycles 17-19 and 23-28. This pattern deviates from an expected strong ∼similar-to\\sim∼1:4 bundling pattern or ratio between the medium- and large-scale cycles in case of a strong and stable LEC. (However, note the ∼similar-to\\sim∼1:4 ratio visible in the filter amplitude of the bandpass filtered cyclicity on the right.) Higher up in the stratigraphy, the shaley layers become weaker overall and thus any larger-scale modulations are more difficult to recognize. Nevertheless, we count at least 6 medium-scale cycles until the next more distinctive shaley interval, i.e., again no clear 1:4 ratio as would be expected in case of a strong and stable LEC.\n\nReferences\n\nAbbot et al.
