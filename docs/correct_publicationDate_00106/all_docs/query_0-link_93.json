        "text": "I have several all time favorites:\n\nLensman Series, E.E. 'Doc' Smith\n\nThe First SF of any kind I read as a kid.\n\nWhich led me to ...\n\nStarship Troopers, not a favorite, -- it has never recovered from not being the Lensman.\n\nBut it led me to:\n\nStranger in a Strange Land, Robert Heinlein\n\nWhich led me to:\n\nThe Moon is a Harsh Mistress, Robert Heinlein\n\nThese are my emotional favorites from when I was 12-13 years old. Which led me to keep read SF through the years and that led me to:\n\nDhalgren, Samuel R. Delany -- my all time favorite. I have read it over 10 times, and each time it is a different experience.\n\nThere are many SF books that I regard as 'favourites' but Philip K. Dick's A Scanner Darkly is the one from which I consistently glean the most enjoyment.\n\nDespite the fact that its SF links are tenuous (although a lot less ‘tenuous’ than some other SF novels I can think of), I still cannot understand why it rarely does well in SF top 10/100/200 lists.\n\nDune 1,5,6\n\nDid not really like the ones by the son but I am reading them lol\n\nI see many of my Favs here already.\n\nEnders Game. Armor - Dorsi books.\n\nI would also put \"Brightness falls from the Air\" by James Tiptree Jr.\n\nand \"Up the Walls of the World\" by the same author.\n\nThe early \"Pern\" books\n\nI have enjoyed the couple of Ian Banks culture novels that I have read.\n\nI like the Far future books of Mike Resnick.\n\nDavid Brin is real good - the first three Uplift.\n\nVernor Vinge and John Vinge\n\nI am sure that more will come to mind as I have read about 500 books in my 38 years starting with the Hobit at 13.\n\nThe first Si fi books were battle Star galac becuase the TV show was about to start and I was still crazzed over Star Wars the movie.\n\nOh the Majipoor stuff\n\nwell the flood gates are open now lol\n\nWhat is your all-time favorite Sci-Fi book?\n\nSorry, but I'm not too much into Fantasy sci-fi--so besides labeling my own book, I will state that at the age of 15 the best I ever read was \"When Worlds Collide and After Worlds Collide\" by Phillip Wylie & Edwin Balmer (1932-33). That was many years ago before I started to even ponder writing my own book.\n\nMy second all time favorite is a bit more recent. \"In Death Ground\" (1997) by David Weber and Steve White. The ultimate outer space high-tech Bug Invasion!\n\nSo to everyone across the entire planet--What is your all-time favorite sci-fi book?\n\nOrbital Resonance?\n\nHello Lemming,\n\nGlad to hear from someone else from Massachusetts. That's the second time I've seen someone list the name of that book, \"Orbital Resonance\" in the past week. Will check it out on Amazon. Must be good if it's your favorite.\n\nGregg\n\nI have to agree with Knivesout here, it's darn near impossible to pick just one.\n\n...However, if you put a gun to my head, the book that I would blurt out before you pulled the trigger would probably be \"Snowcrash\" by Neal Stephenson. It is especially one of my favorite books to re-read when I'm not in the mood for something new.\n\nMatrix meets Mafia?\n\nTo: Archren,\n\nYour favorite sounds like a real mind-bender. The idea that all pizza shops are owned by Cosa Nostra Pizza Inc. means you would really pay through the nose for pizza!\n\nNeal Stephenson's book, \"SnowCrash\" sounds almost like a more vicious version of the movie-Demolition Man.\n\nI too have read over again some of my favorites.\n\nMy third best favorite is \"Renegade's Honor\" by William Keith. It had to do with the Renegade Legions board games in the 1980's.\n\nGreg\n\nIf i had the chance to read only one novel i would like it to be Flowers for Algernon !! The runner-up is the outstanding Dune ... but... i haven't had the chance to read much SF yet cause i'm a new fan!!\n\nI think this topic was on here a long time ago and I'll be damned if I can remember what I chose as my favorite book back then. It's just a well, because I'm always changing my mind about what my favorite books are.\n\nAnyway, the one science fiction book that has stuck with me over the past few years is A Deepness in the Sky by Vernor Vigne."
