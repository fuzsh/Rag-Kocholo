        "text": "About\n\nKepler's laws of planetary motion turn out to be far from the last word on planetary orbits. Orbits change over time, some changes are slow and periodic, others are chaotic and dramatic; these determine the architecture of planetary systems. In orbital dynamics research, we seek to discover the past and future of planetary systems - the diverse effects of gravity that shape where and how planets form and how their orbits evolve in time. We study the orbital evolution of planetary and satellite systems, and small bodies (asteroids and comets), as well as interplanetary dust, in the solar system and in exo-planetary systems. We seek discovery and understanding of the dynamical transport processes of planetary materials across vast distances in space and over geologically long times. We study how Earth's habitability is affected by its orbital history, and how orbital dynamics shapes extra-terrestrial environments.\n\nRecent News\n\nJuly 2020\n\nKathryn Volk is now the Chair of the AAS Division on Dynamical Astronomy\n\nA new paper by Kathryn Volk (co-authored with Renu Malhotra) on the source of dynamical instability in multiplanet systems: \"Dynamical instabilities in systems of multiple short-period planets are likely driven by secular chaos: a case study of Kepler-102\" Volk & Malhotra 2020, AJ in press\n\nSteward Observatory Graduate Student Rachel Smullen and Kathryn Volk had a paper accepted about using machine learning to dynamically classify Kuiper belt objects: \"Machine Learning Classification of Kuiper Belt Populations\" Smullen & Volk, MNRAS in press\n\nJune 2020\n\nA new paper by Prof Renu Malhotra describes the discovery of low eccentricity bridges between first order mean motion resonances: On the Divergence of First Order Resonance Widths at Low Eccentricities\n\nGraduate Student Nathaniel Hendler led this new paper on measuring the sizes of 199 protoplanetary disks: The Evolution of Dust Disk Sizes from a Homogeneous Analysis of 1-10 Myr old Stars\n\nMarch 2020\n\nRegents Professor Renu Malhotra co-authored this paper on Search for L5 Earth Trojans with DECam, Markwardt et al., MNRAS, 492(4):6105-6119 (2020)\n\nFebruary 2020\n\nGraduate student Hamish Hay successfully defended his PhD Dissertation, “A Tale of Tides: icy satellites, subsurface oceans, and tightly-packed planetary systems”\n\nGraduate student Teddy Kareta led this paper on the new interstellar object 2I/Borisov Carbon Chain Depletion of 2I/Borisov\n\nDecember 2019\n\nA new paper led by graduate student Teddy Kareta \"Physical Characterization of the 2017 December Outburst of the Centaur 174P/Echeclus\", (2019), Astronomical Journal, 158, 6.\n\nRegents Professor Renu Malhotra’s work featured in the Economist How the planets got their spots - The Economist, December 2019\n\nNovember 2019\n\nResonant Kuiper Belt Objects: a review, Geoscience Letters, 6:12 (2019).
