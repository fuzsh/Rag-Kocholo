Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) involves intravenously injecting microbubbles to allow for improved visibility of large and small vessels to assess vascularity and is becoming a widespread technique to improve diagnostic performance of US across a broad spectrum of applications. CEUS has the potential to add value to routine brain US and become a useful adjunct to MRI in infants in need of bedside imaging. We discuss the basics of US contrast agents and CEUS technique, including safety considerations, and detail the potential clinical uses of brain CEUS.\n\nContrast-enhanced ultrasound of the neonatal brain - PubMed (nih.gov)\n\nContrast-enhanced ultrasound of the spleen, pancreas and gallbladder in children\n\nFranke D, Anupindi SA, Barnewolt CE, Green TG, Greer MC, Harkanyi Z, Lorenz N, McCarville MB, Mentzel HJ, Ntoulia A, Squires JH.\n\nPediatr Radiol.\n\nAn overview of the applications of CEUS for normal variants and diseases affecting the spleen, gallbladder and pancreas. We highlight a variety of cases as examples of how CEUS can serve in the diagnosis and follow-up for such diseases in children. Our discussion includes specific examination techniques; presentation of the main imaging findings in various benign and malignant lesions of the spleen, gallbladder and pancreas in children; and acknowledgment of the limitations of CEUS for these organs.\n\nContrast-enhanced ultrasound of the spleen, pancreas and gallbladder in children - PubMed (nih.gov)\n\nTitle: Macro-vasculature and positron emission tomography (PET) standardized uptake value in lung cancer patients\n\nAuthors: Pu J*, Leader JK, Zhang D, Beeche C, Sechrist J, Pennathur A, Villaruz LC, Wilson D\n\nJournal: Medical Physics\n\nAbbreviated PubMed “results” summary: investigate the morphology-metabolic relationship between vasculatures and lung tumors\n\nLink to PubMed listing: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34382221/\n\nTitle: Automated delineation of corneal layers on OCT images using a boundary-guided CNN\n\nAuthors: Wang L, Shen M, Chang Q, Shi C, Chen Y, Zhou Y, Zhang Y, Pu J, Chen H\n\nJournal: Pattern Recognition\n\nAbbreviated PubMed “results” summary: develop and validate a novel CNN network for segmenting corneal layers depicted on OCT.\n\nLink to PubMed listing: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34421131/\n\nTitle: A pilot study: quantify lung volume and emphysema extent directly from 2-D scout images\n\nAuthors: .

A previously healthy 3-month-old female presented with fever, irritability, abdominal distention, and tachypnea. She ultimately met all eight HLH-2004 diagnostic criteria, accompanied by elevated CXCL9. Initial empiric anti-inflammatory treatment included anakinra and IVIg, which stabilized ferritin and cytopenias. She had molecular and genetic confirmation of perforin deficiency and was started on dexamethasone and etoposide per HLH-94. She clinically improved, though CXCL9 and sIL-2Ra remained elevated. She was readmitted at week 8 for relapsed HLH without clear trigger and HLH-94 induction therapy was reinitiated. Her systemic HLH symptoms failed to respond and she soon developed symptomatic CNS HLH. She was incidentally found to have multifocal lung and kidney nodules, which were sterile and consisted largely of histiocytes and activated, oligoclonal CD8 T cells. The patient had a laboratory response to salvage therapy with alemtuzumab and emapalumab, but progressive neurologic decline led to withdrawal of care. This report highlights HLH foci manifest as pulmonary/renal nodules, demonstrates the utility of monitoring an array of HLH biomarkers, and suggests possible benefit of earlier salvage therapy.\n\nhttp://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33570715/\n\nSelinexor in combination with topotecan in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors\n\nKyaw Zin Thein 1 2, Sarina A Piha-Paul 3, Apostolia Tsimberidou 3, Daniel D Karp 3, Filip Janku 3, Abdulrazzak Zarifa 3, Jatin Shah 4, Denái R Milton 5, Stacie Bean 3, Lacey McQuinn 3, Jing Gong 3, Rivka Colen 6, Brett W Carter 7, Vivek Subbiah 3, Deby C Ogbonna 3,\n\nShubham Pant 3, Funda Meric-Bernstam 3, Aung Naing 3\n\nInvest New Drurg\n\nRESULTS: Conclusions Once weekly selinexor in combination with topotecan was viable and showed some preliminary tumor efficacy.

Prolonged fasting in very young infants is associated with an increased risk for hypoglycemia and dehydration as well as patient discomfort and patient/parental dissatisfaction. After institutional review board approval and written informed parental consent, ultrasound examination was performed in healthy full-term neonates before and after formula feeding at 15-min intervals until return to baseline. The results demonstrate that gastric emptying times are substantially less than the current fasting guideline of 6 h for formula-fed, healthy term neonates.\n\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33861856/\n\nCurrent State of Imaging of Pediatric Pancreatitis: AJR Expert Panel Narrative Review\n\nAndrew T Trout , Rama S Ayyala, Michael A Murati, Judy H Squires, Michael J Callahan, Govind B Chavhan, Maisam Abu-El-Haija, Sudha A Anupindi\n\nAJR Am J Roentgenol\n\nPancreatitis is as common in children as it is in adults, though causes and accepted imaging strategies differ in children. In this narrative review we discuss the epidemiology of childhood pancreatitis and key imaging features for pediatric acute, acute recurrent, and chronic pancreatitis. We rely heavily on our collective experience in discussing advantages and disadvantages of different imaging modalities; practical tips for optimization of ultrasound, CT, and MRI with MRCP in children; and image interpretation pearls.\n\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33728974/\n\nCROWLEY, JOHN\n\nSociety of Interventional Radiology Guidelines and Statements Division 2020 Year-End Document Review\n\nJohn J Crowley, anne Marie Cahill\n\nJ Vasc Interv Radiol\n\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34051989/\n\nFLOM, LYNDA\n\nComputed tomography associated radiation exposure in children with craniosynostosis"
