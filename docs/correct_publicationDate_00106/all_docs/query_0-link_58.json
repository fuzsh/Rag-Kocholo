        "text": "As a kid, every week I’d go to the library to check out a new batch of Star Trek books, then come back the next week for more. Then, on one such visit, as I was checking out, the librarian stared me down and said, “You’re ready for more than this.” She took me upstairs, to the full science fiction section and gave me a tour of Isaac Asimov, John Barnes, and Robert Heinlein. I shifted my attention from Star Trek to these new galaxies and futures. I loved all of it, but especially loved anything in SPACE, and especially anything with aliens.\n\nOf course, all these books mostly featured straight white dudes gallivanting across the stars. When LGBTQIA+ people were mentioned, it was usually a side thought, perhaps with a dash of homophobia. (I’m looking at you, Baron Harkonnen.) That sort of marginalization was just in the air all around me as a kid, so I didn’t think much of it – just tried to ignore the homophobic bits and transpose my queer Latinx self onto these stories I loved even if they didn’t quite connect to my own lived experience. Of course, there were a handful of more queer-inclusive sci-fi books out there back then, but sadly I didn’t discover writers like Delany, Haldeman, and Le Guin until my twenties.\n\nToday, hopefully young queer and POC sci-fi readers don’t have to search so far to find stories they can relate to. There is SO much more LGBTQIA+ science fiction out there that we’re living in a veritable Golden Age of queer SF. And if you want QUEERS IN SPACE, there’s a cornucopia to choose from. As we celebrate Pride Month this year, I wanted to share a list of some of my favorite SF novels set in space featuring queer, trans, and nonbinary characters – all from the past decade or so. This list includes both adult and young adult novels; some feature queer romances, and some just feature a bunch of human and alien with diverse sexualities and gender identities.\n\nTo my mind, many of these novels feel more “realistic” than some of the old-school SF novels where queer and trans people were nonexistent or only villains. It seems unlikely to me that Earth-style heteronormativity would prevail across the universe, and much more likely that the stars hold an expansive range of wondrous possibilities ….\n\nThe Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet (2014)\n\nBy Becky Chambers\n\nNinefox Gambit (2016)\n\nBy Yoon Ha Lee\n\nAn Unkindness of Ghosts (2017)\n\nBy Rivers Solomon\n\nGideon the Ninth (2020)\n\nBy Tamsyn Muir\n\nVictories Greater Than Death (2021)\n\nBy Charlie Jane Anders\n\nLight from Uncommon Stars (2021)\n\nBy Ryka Aoki\n\nA Complicated Love Story Set in Space (2022)\n\nBy Shaun David Hutchinson\n\nThe Kuiper Belt Job (2023)\n\nBy David D. Levine\n\nVal Vega: Secret Ambassador of Earth (2024)\n\nBy Ben Francisco\n\nOf course, this list is not exhaustive, and these are just a few of my favorite recent reads. I focused on novels from the last decade, but there are many others, including classics from prior years that featured queer, trans, or nonbinary characters, even if the authors were somewhat constrained by the conventions and publishing realities of the time. Some other favorites include Delany’s Babel-17, Le Guin’s Left Hand of Darkness, or the more recent already-classic Ancillary Justice by Ann Leckie. This Goodreads listopia of LGBTQ Space Opera is a great place to look if you’re hungry for more.\n\nFeel free to share you own favorite books featuring LGBTQIA characters in space!"
