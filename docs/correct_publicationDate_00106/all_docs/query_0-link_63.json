        "text": "There are so many sf-writers nowadays compared to when I started reading sf (long long ago) that it is impossible to know every writer.\n\nSo, like me, you probably recognize that feeling that a gem is probably hidden somewhere in the vast rows of sf-books, if only you knew which one.\n\nLet's write our tips, with a short explanation here.\n\nLet me start by mentioning\n\nEric S. Nyland\n\nAFAIK he has written 4 books, I think they are (I am at my work, so I can't check my bookcase) :\n\n-A game of Universe, cool spaceopera like story, good!\n\n-Pawn's dream, magical society with family feuds here on earth, good!\n\n-Dry water, strange magical book, noyt quite my cup of coffee, but worth trying out.\n\n-Signal to noise, pure sf with virtual realities, I just read about 100 pages, very promising, and a sequel is mentioned at the end.\n\ndura, I like this topic. Its always fun to discover a new 'gem' in the SF world, especially, as you said, that there are so many more authors in the genre nowadays.\n\nI'm almost ashamed to admit that latley, I haven't had much of an opportunity to look for new gems in the sf genre (I've been so busy catching up on all my favorite books by well-known authors).\n\nI will throw out a series by a well-known author that alot of folks may not have read.\n\nMargaret Weis, best know for her fantasy work, wrote a series a while back called Star of the Guardians. There are four books in the series: The Lost King, King's Test, King's Sacrifice, and Ghost Legion. Like I said, its a great space opera, packed full of awesome characters (what else would one expect out of Weis), plenty of action, an all around great read.\n\nA good topic Dura, and a worthy reply Cellandros. But if you guys want to read a new author whose style is very different, and whose storyline in his first novel is chillingly real, then get hold of The Tide Turners by Colin Macpherson. It was published at the end of last year in Australia, and I think the only way you can get it is via the publisher's website at www.mopoke.com.au - that's how I got my copy anyway. The website tells you a little about the book and the author, etc. and is well worth a visit. You've probably noticed that I liked the book so much that I started it as a forum topic here at sffworld. I've also written a review for the review section if you're interested, so I won't repeat it here.\n\nThe Tide Turners isn't sf fantasy, and there are no space cowboys - it's about a slight shift in reality and about changing the world and ... don't get me started, check it out for yourselves. I just hope Macpherson keeps writing and doesn't disappear like one of his main characters.\n\nI know that alot of people who read SF hae probably read stuf by Orson Scott Card. I usually read more fantasy stuff, but the libray didn't have the books I was looking for so i got the Ender's Saga. An interesting new book which my brother lent me is called Ender's Shadow. It isn't a sequel to Ender's Game, but rather a companion novel. It is basically the same time period and some of the same events, but from the point of view of bean, one of the less important characters in Ender's game. I thought that it was very interesting.\n\nOne of my fave authors when I was younger (all that time ago!), was Andre Norton.\n\nI've just caught up with an \"up to date book\" of hers which has made me want to read more of her newer books. The book was 'Brother to shadows' and was brill!!!!\n\nI would recommend her to anyone.\n\nMerry\n\nA good topic... I feel compelled to post recs to some newer stuff, since in SF (unlike pop music, it seems) there *is* some pretty good recent stuff.\n\nJohn Barnes--Orbital Resonance and Mother of Storms. Orbital Resonance is an excellent story about growing up in space after Earth has been more or less ruined. The problems of growing up in a guinea pig generation are very real and thought provoking, and the characters are great. Mother of Storms is an interesting disaster novel that will teach you a lot about hurricanes, with some cyberpunk and smut thrown in for fun.\n\nDavid Brin--Earth. You've probably heard of it, but I just read it and was quite impressed. A good planetary love story and an entertaining ride.\n\nVernor Vinge--A Deepness in the Sky. A space opera about 5 times as good as its Hugo winning prequel A Fire Upon the Deep, and not very related to it.\n\nNancy Kress--Beggars in Spain. Steals kind of a lot from Objectivism, but an excellent read about society and how it reacts to a bunch of brilliant people who don't need to sleep.\n\nKim Stanley Robinson--Red Mars, Green Mars, Blue Mars. My all-time favorite SF trilogy.\n\nlemming\n\nCan I do something really out of the norm here... and recommend some really old stuff? I am aware that Dura began reading long long ago\n\nA Canticle for Leobowitz by ??? (help)\n\nThe City and the Stars, Authur C. Clark\n\nDandelion Wine, Ray Bradbury\n\nFoundation, Issac Asimov\n\nIndoctrinarie(sp?), Christopher Priest(?)\n\nI also need some help here, I read a series (I think just 3 books), about a guy who landed on a planet that had magic. He had a robot in the hold of his spaceship that was a horse, he thought the believe in magic was quaint, until he found out it actually existed. Viking ships had something to do with the plot, and in the dungoens was a moss that could be used to 'make things'.\n\nCan anyone help an old guy out here?\n\nDennizim - Leibowitz was by Walter M Miller Jr - good one. Also thoroughly recommend City and the Stars, which has just been republished in the UK (the original short story is in the Collected Stories of Arthur C Clarke, which is a HUGE book but contains all of ACC's stories...fantastic, but not to be taken lightly!) Foundation has dated but is still a 'classic' (overused word, but here it's OK).\n\nLemming - I liked Kim Stanley Robinson a lot too (once I could get my head around the BIG ideas) - have you read Antarctica?\n\nLord Soth - I've a signed copy of Chasm City in the pile to read - heard it's good. Quite liked Revelation Space but this is supposedly better. (*moves it up towards the top of the pile*)\n\nBUT I've still got Perdido St Station to read and the Elric and the Black Company novels and I've got quite into the Kate Elliott's.......(sigh)\n\nHobbit\n\nPS These are all quite well known authors aren't they? Are there any up and coming or oldies that have slipped by? For example, I was very surprised at Dune Dudes comments elsewhere in the forum that Clifford Simak was no longer easy to get hold of. It's a crime.....\n\nSoth... no it was not a dream, I have set the mad monk on the case, I just have to sober him up first...\n\nHobbit... thank for the Leibowitz author, I have this book as part of a uniform set that was published ages ago... Corgi Science Fiction Classics, The City and the Stars is part of the set as well. At the moment most of my books are packed away whilst the house is renovated and I can't refer back to them, and my memory is terrible\n\nI have found the name of the book... thank GOD for Google...\n\nThe Warlock in Spite of Himself by Christopher Stasheff\n\nThe Warlock in Spite of Himself is the first in a series of books about the planet of Gramayre, a planet colonized by devotees of the Society for Creative Anachronism.\n\nRod Gallowglass and his faithful robot horse, Fess, land on the planet several hundred years after its colonization for the purpose of secretly preparing the inhabitants for democratic rule so that they can be brought into the Galactic government. All well and good, but... there is a high percentage of telepaths, teleports, and what-have-you in the population, who are refered to as witches and warlocks, and here, magic really works!\n\nThis is a delightful romp into psionics, espionage, and a feudal culture which is happy to stay that way. While not recommended for the beginning reader, this is highly recommended for the more experienced sci-fi reader. Well worth the money.\n\nThanks Cad\n\nI hope I can buy the books somewhere, this was a brilliant series in the style of Spellsinger by Alen Dean Foster... but anyway... I also recommend these books\n\nHobbit, no I haven't read Antarctica, but maybe I will next.\n\nDune Dude, I'm reading Way Station by Simak right now and finding it delightful. A lot of really old SF has a really neat feel of innocence, and this is one of those books. Don't know if I'll read more of him, but I might... the good old Boston Public Library has plenty ofhim.\n\nIf you can get hold of Clifford Simak's City, I really enjoyed that one (especially if you like dogs!). It's kinda sad too. Simak is old fashioned but his SF was one of a kind - slower, often more 'rural' rather than urban and a lot less technocentric than most of the Sf of the time.\n\nThen again there's not many of his I haven't liked. He's good at the short stories too.\n\nBoston Library - sounds great. Isn't it a big sort-of brownstone building? *Gets mental image of big gothic building*, but never been, so...must be a random thought.\n\nHobbit"
