        "text": "After doing a Ph. D. in organic synthesis at McGill and a postdoc at MIT, I applied for faculty positions at universities during the Great Recession. It didn’t work out. But having seen first-hand how many people struggled with the subject (including myself when I took it as an undergraduate) I thought there was a need for an online organic chemistry resource that had all the rigor of a traditional textbook, but was more approachable and accessible.\n\nDrawing on the experience of thousands of hours spent tutoring students 1-on-1, as well as dozens of case studies, Master Organic Chemistry aims to fill in some of the conceptual gaps that aren’t traditionally covered by textbooks, and provide a friendly, logical and thorough pathway for learning introductory organic chemistry."
