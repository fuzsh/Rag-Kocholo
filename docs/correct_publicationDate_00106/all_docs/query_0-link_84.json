        "text": "Why I don't lose sleep about AI, Gen AI, and automation in general. I have been reading fantasy and sci-fi for 4 decades and change now. I think that it is the most critical required reading missing from school curricula. if your lucky they will throw 1984, A Brave New World, Flowers for Algernon and A Wrinkle in time in there. Shakespeare has some fantasy but at best you will read A Midsummer's Night. Frankenstein usually makes an appearance along with Beowulf (and if you have really good teacher's Grendel) and maybe the Lottery. Ok, so that's a decent dose of Sci-Fi and Fantasy when you consider all they are trying to share with you in the 100 or so hours a year of english you take in a year. But still more sci-fi and fantasy. Let me briefly address why fantasy---- to paraphrase - any sufficiently advanced technology is practically indistinguishable from magic. Back to my main thesis- why a.i. doesn't give me the hippy hippy shakes about the end of society and mankind as we know it. The gifts of my reading habits are that - 1. The potential for humans to fumble at an epic scale and push a hard reset has been a possibility contemplated by scoobooks of authors. Some focus on the extinction event, some focus on the butterfly flap that sets of the chain of events, some focus on the fact that history tells us we've done this on a societal level, some focus on escape routes, and some focus on the the recovery/remnant population and how they survive. Star Trek is a perfect example, the society of Earth which joins the federation is in a post partial apocalyptic state. (Yes I know, the origin of Star Trek is TV-->Movies--->TV however there are a number of books and it is also an example that folks are likely to be familiar with). 2. A lot of authors, in some case almost as an aside, have already done the hard work of telling us what the risks and dangers are, and more often then not provided the solutions (and an exegesis on the flaws and weaknesses in the solutions for bonus pts.) 3. The ability of humanity to think around corners, and evolve understanding even within generations is gorgeously and delightfully showcased in the written word. Final thought here- really any form of fiction will do (I have a book bias but as my Star Trek cite should make clear I fully concede the power of visual media). Other than the obvious (Asimov) I have one book recommendation if your interested in contemplating a world where mature A.I. solutions are so fully integrated into the functioning society as to be unremarkable. Orbital Resonance by John Barnes."
