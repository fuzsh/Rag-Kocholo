        "text": "ICYMI – last month I had a great time appearing on the brilliant Daniel Braum’s Nighttime Logic show with the inimitable Jeffrey Ford. I read from my story “Two People,” originally published in the Indiana Review, and Jeff read his wonderfully eerie story “A Hundred Nights of Nothing,” published in McSweeney’s 71, a special horror-themed edition of the magazine with an all-star line-up of writers. Plus, the three of us talk about Krampus and our favorite monsters. I’ve been a fan of Jeff’s writing for many years, so it was an honor to read with him – and to be part of author Daniel Braum’s always-entertaining Nighttime Logic series.\n\nYou can watch the full show on YouTube here."
