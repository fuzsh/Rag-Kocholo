It can be challenging to identify the best options available, or to transition from one residence to the next with higher care levels. My Sask Senior Living offers online directories of senior housing, services and resources in Saskatchewan to help seniors and their caregivers identify options and guide decision making.\n\nAdvertisement 2\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nTHIS CONTENT IS RESERVED FOR SUBSCRIBERS ONLY\n\nSubscribe now to read the latest news in your city and across Canada.\n\nUnlimited online access to articles from across Canada with one account.\n\nGet exclusive access to the Saskatoon StarPhoenix ePaper, an electronic replica of the print edition that you can share, download and comment on.\n\nEnjoy insights and behind-the-scenes analysis from our award-winning journalists.\n\nSupport local journalists and the next generation of journalists.\n\nDaily puzzles including the New York Times Crossword.\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO UNLOCK MORE ARTICLES\n\nSubscribe now to read the latest news in your city and across Canada.\n\nUnlimited online access to articles from across Canada with one account.\n\nGet exclusive access to the Saskatoon StarPhoenix ePaper, an electronic replica of the print edition that you can share, download and comment on.\n\nEnjoy insights and behind-the-scenes analysis from our award-winning journalists.\n\nSupport local journalists and the next generation of journalists.\n\nDaily puzzles including the New York Times Crossword.\n\nREGISTER / SIGN IN TO UNLOCK MORE ARTICLES\n\nCreate an account or sign in to continue with your reading experience.\n\nAccess articles from across Canada with one account.\n\nShare your thoughts and join the conversation in the comments.\n\nEnjoy additional articles per month.\n\nGet email updates from your favourite authors.\n\nSign In or Create an Account\n\nEmail Address\n\nor\n\nArticle content\n\nQ: What is My Sask Senior Living?\n\nA: My Sask Senior Living is the most comprehensive online directory of housing options, services and resources that is available for seniors in Saskatchewan. The information helps seniors and their caregivers to identify appropriate housing and service options that will work for them as they age. I look at this as a one-stop shop bridging the gap between older adults and the services that they need to thrive.\n\nWhen you visit our website you can look through our Saskatchewan senior housing directory and our services directory. We also have a page dedicated to a variety of aging in place and housing resources as well as listing some upcoming senior events in Saskatchewan. Additionally, we have an inquiry support line through our website to help navigate these options.\n\nOur mission is to connect older adults with housing and service providers empowering them to make informed decisions about their options and our vision is a world where seniors can confidently navigate their options, living their lives to the fullest.\n\nQ: What is your background with seniors?\n\nArticle content\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nA: I have lived in Saskatoon my whole life and have worked with older adults for over 20 years. I started working with the health authority and made my way through different positions over the years. I eventually landed a leadership role in a large retirement home here in Saskatoon, which is where I recognized how great the need is for this type of service. That’s when I started my entrepreneurial journey and established Assisted AdvantAGE Senior Solutions, which I still operate. Now, four years later, I am thrilled to be launching My Sask Senior Living.\n\nI have made a commitment to understanding the needs of seniors and the service providers that cater to them. I have visited hundreds of senior communities throughout Saskatoon and neighbouring areas. And I hope to make it through the whole province eventually. By connecting with these communities and learning about the services they provide, I am able to use and share this information to help others navigate the next steps.\n\nQ: Why did you open My Sask Senior Living?\n\nA: I opened My Sask Senior Living to help fulfil a need. Based on my experiences of sitting down with hundreds of families over the years, it was apparent to me just how fragmented and confusing it can be for people who are looking to find senior services and housing. Until now, there hasn’t been a centralized platform available in Saskatchewan listing senior living providers. Many other provinces already have this. I wanted to address this gap here and make information about senior living providers in Saskatchewan readily accessible to people so they could make better-informed decisions.\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nAll this stems from my original business — Assisted AdvantAGE Senior Solutions — which does the research for people to identify highly customized appropriate senior living options in Saskatchewan. Those services are particularly great for seniors needing help with research or for family members who may live far away or who may not have the time to do the research themselves.\n\nQ: What kinds of information will people find on your website?\n\nA: People can find all things related to senior living in Saskatchewan. Senior housing searches can be filtered by city or town and type of housing, such as independent living, assisted living, licensed personal care homes and other housing options for seniors. There are also support services listed on our platform. Categories include home support services, day programs, downsizing, moving services and so many more.\n\nYou can also conduct specific searches for a service or housing provider by typing their name into our search bar at the top of our site. Additionally, we offer senior-related resources and information about upcoming senior events in Saskatchewan.\n\nAdvertisement 5\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nQ: How are listings added to your website?\n\nA: My Sask Senior Living provides basic listings of housing and service providers throughout the province at no charge. These basic listings provide company name, their primary type of service and their basic contact information, as well as a map linked to their location.\n\nService and housing providers also have an option to pay for a verified listing to enhance the information provided about their company. All verified listing providers have their contact information and website linked to their profile and their listings are prioritized to appear first on our website in addition to other enhanced features.\n\nWe are adding new basic and verified listing providers and growing all the time. Interested providers can reach out to us.\n\nQ: Do you have any advice for seniors who may need a higher level of care?\n\nA: It’s never too early to start looking at providers and services, whether that’s housing or in-home services because you never know when you’re going to need them. I often say it’s a good idea to start planning five to 10 years down the road and maybe to start considering that around the age of 65 to 75. That may seem quite young and something that you don’t want to think about at that time in your life, but it’s something that you’re doing as a service to your future self.\n\nAdvertisement 6\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nIt’s important to have an idea about what’s out there because you just never know when you’re going to need it and unfortunately a lot of the people that I help are usually in a crisis by the time I’m talking with them. You don’t want to ever find yourself in a place where you’re making a crisis-driven decision where you haven’t had the time to do the research to find what’s going to ideally match your needs as an individual.\n\nAnother good place to start is just getting out there and talking to people in the community who are already accessing these types of services. Contacting providers directly can also be helpful. I recommend having a list of questions ready and finding out if you can meet them in person to go over their services or go on a tour. You can also contact experts such as My Sask Senior Living or Assisted AdvantAGE Senior Solutions to assist you with navigating these options.\n\nQ: What do you love most about owning My Sask Senior Living?\n\nA: I absolutely love seeing folks living their best lives and hearing the stories of positive outcomes. It really makes me feel like we’re making a difference in the lives of older adults — that’s what I love the most.\n\nAdvertisement 7\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nThis interview has been edited and condensed.\n\nMy Sask Senior Living\n\nOwner: Jennifer White\n\nEmail: mysaskseniorliving@gmail.com\n\nWebsite: www.mysaskseniorliving.ca\n\nFacebook: www.facebook.com/mysaskseniorliving\n\nJennifer White, owner of My Sask Senior Living, in Saskatoon, Sask., on Monday, July 22, 2024.\n\nRecommended from Editorial\n\nReroute Saskatoon delivers donations and diverts waste from landfill\n\nPhenom Female Hockey Advising led by former local women's national players\n\nFour brothers open Darbar Indian Restaurant in downtown Saskatoon\n\nGet Loaded Pierogi for unique flavour combinations in University Heights\n\nHave you recently started or moved a new business or non-profit organization in Saskatoon?
