        "text": "Located on Main Street in Elbow, Saskatchewan is the Elbow Museum and a house entirely made of sod.\n\nDuring the summer of 2000, this unique house was built from native prairie sod. The Sod House is furnished with period pieces giving visitors a glimpse of how thousands of settlers lived when they homesteaded on the Canadian prairie in the early 1900s.\n\nIf you love old cars, trucks, and farm equipment then the backroads of Saskatchewan hold many treasures from days gone by.\n\nThe friendly locals and farmers love to tell the history of their area and some can even tell you the date of the last time the vehicle or piece of equipment was used.\n\nAbandoned in a field, many years ago no longer fixable for use, this old truck still stands today where it last worked.\n\nStanding proud and holding memories of the hard work it did together with the farmer that owned it.\n\nCruising the backroads on Highway 39 approximately 18 miles south of Moose Jaw l came upon the Village of Drinkwater. Population: 77\n\nSo for fun, l had to stop for a photo having a drink of water in Drinkwater, Saskatchewan.\n\nDrinkwater is named after Charles Drinkwater who was an original director of the CP Railway and was incorporated into a Village in 1904.\n\nDrinkwater is also home to a 113-year-old Sanborn Round Barn. Unfortunately, a bad winter storm in 2021 badly damaged the old structure."
