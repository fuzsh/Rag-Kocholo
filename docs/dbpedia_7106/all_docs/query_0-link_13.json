        "text": "Highway 33 is a highway in the southern portion of the Canadian province of Saskatchewan connecting Regina (Arcola Avenue) to Stoughton; the highway is divided near Regina. Highway 33 is about 139 km (86 mi) long.[1]\n\nRoute description\n\nRegina\n\nRegina is the only city along Highway 33 and is its western terminus. It is the second largest city of the province of Saskatchewan, and is the capital city. The route follows Arcola Avenue, a limited-access road that travels in a south-east / north-west direction south of Victoria Avenue. The road is named after the town of Arcola. North of Victoria Avenue, Arcola Avenue continues west as an arterial road and becomes Saskatchewan Drive west of Winnipeg Street,[1] passing through Downtown Regina before ending at Lewvan Drive. As Victoria Avenue does not connect with Lewvan Drive, Saskatchewan Avenue functions as the main western approach into downtown.\n\nHighway 33 begins at Ring Road and travels in a south-east / north-west direction for its entire length, though it is designated as east-west.[1] On the outskirts of Regina, it crosses the Regina Bypass, which is part of the Trans-Canada Highway (Highway 1).\n\nCommunities\n\nWith the advent of motor vehicle transportation and better highways, several small communities started to disappear. The days of trail and horse and buggy necessitated travel between centres which were established approximately 6 miles apart, which is no longer required. The amenities of larger centres have given rise to a lower rural population, and a higher urban population in the province.\n\nEast of Regina, Highway 33 passes through McCallum, which is now a ghost town.[2] Richardson first named Richardson Station on the CPR rail line, now adds its population and administrative affairs to Edenwold No. 158 rural municipality.[3] Kronau now adds its population and administrative affairs to Lajord No. 128 rural municipality.[3] Oyama[4] is now being run as a private camp ground, under the pretense that it has been and is currently supposed to be closed to the public for upgrades to be completed, it is located between Kronau and Lajord. Lajord is too small to be enumerated on its own accord, and is a part of the administrative district of rural municipality of Lajord No. 128.\n\nSedley is a village which had a population of 322 people in 2001, and is now a village and a part of rural municipality Francis No. 127.[3] Francis, a town of 148[3] along Highway 33, is at the intersection of Highway 35.\n\nTyvan combined its population with Wellington No. 97 as of July 1, 1936.[5] Highway 711 intersects with Highway 33 just south of Osage. Osage is a small area with a post office as early as 1903; it combines its population with Fillmore No 96. Fillmore, currently a village of 193,[3] is located at the intersection of Highway 33 and Highway 606.\n\nThe village of Creelman with 81 residents in 2006.[6] Heward, a hamlet of fewer than 30 residents, is a part of the rural municipality of Tecumseh No. 65. The post office of Heward began operations April 1, 1904.[6]\n\nStoughton is located at the intersections of three main highways; Highway 13 (the Red Coat Trail), 33, and Highway 47. The eastern terminus of Highway 33 is at a junction with Highway 47, just north of the intersection with Highways 13 and 47. In 1901, this community was named New Hope, North-West Territories, changing name to Stoughton and moving a little to the south in 1904 when the CPR railway came through the area.[7] Stoughton with a motto of The Heart of the South East Crossroads of Friendship became a town in 1960 and in 2006 had 653 residents.[3][8]\n\nRural municipalities\n\nLocal Improvement District number 6 E 2 held its first administrative meeting on June 29, 1904.\n\nA road commissioner was appointed in each division at a rate of $2.50 per day overseeing work. Residents were permitted to pay taxes in 1904 with labour on the road at 20 cents per hour for man, 35 cents per hour for man and team. Road Commissioners were: Robert Mott, Division 1, Township 11, Range 9; Ed Kutz, Division 2, Township 12, Range 9; DJ Stewart, Division3, Township 11, Range 10; JR Sleightholm, Division 4, Township 12, Range 10.\n\n— Cornerstone Regional Economic Development Authority[9]\n\nDecember 13, 1909 saw the changeover from Local Improvement District number 6 E 2 to Fillmore No 96. From legislation put into place by Premier Walter Scott December 13, 1909 saw the province divided into Local Improvement Districts of about 3 townships by 3 townships in size.\n\na person could work for the municipality and have his earnings put toward the taxes on his land; at one time, money collected in each Division stayed in that Division....The RM has as its responsibilities for many areas: agricultural programs and concerns in general; tax collections for needs of the municipality - road construction and maintenance; protective services - pest control, fire protection, weed control, environmental development, cultural and educational services; medical and veterinary needs and so forth.\n\n— Tecumseh No. 65[10]\n\nAs travel continues towards Regina the agricultural landscape of the area starts to become interspersed with industrial parks.[11] The RM of Sherwood No. 159 with a population of 1,075 rural residents in 2006[3] encompasses the city of Regina.[12]\n\nMajor attractions and geophysical features\n\nThe terrain along Highway 33 is mainly undulating agricultural wheat and grain fields. Grain and livestock production is the main economic industry in the area. The name Lajord translated from Norwegian meaning flat place aptly describes the scenery.[13] The Stoughton Campground along Highway 33 features swimming pool, tennis court, ball diamond and golf course.[14] The Red Barn, and Stoughton and District Museum conserve the past, while parks and a golf course provide recreation in this town.[15]\n\nOsage Wildlife Refuge[16] is a conservation area on the west of Highway 33, about 3 miles south-east of Osage.[17]\n\nWascana Creek meanders along the western side of Saskatchewan Highway between Tyvan and Regina giving rise to the Wascana Valley. Highway 33 crosses the creek at Tyvan, and the creek makes a hairpin curve and peters out to the north-east of town.[8]\n\nBetween Lajord and Kronau is the regional park on the east side of the highway featuring the Oyama Regional Park Golf Course which opened in 1971.[18]\n\nHistory\n\nNovember 9, 1904 saw the arrival of the CPR rail line. The Souris-Arcola-Regina Section branch line[19] was the longest piece of straight track worldwide, and still has the claim of being the longest straight track of North America. Highway 33 follows along this surveyed rail line.[20] The CPR served Stoughton, Heward, Creelman, Fillmore, Osage, Tyvan, Francis, and Sedley. The Hanson brothers from Lajord developed one of the first swathers in use in Saskatchewan.[21]\n\nMajor intersections\n\nFrom west to east:\n\nRural municipalityLocationkm[1]miDestinationsNotes City of Regina−6.3−3.9 Lewvan Drive – Regina International AirportSaskatchewan Avenue west end −4.5−2.8Albert Street −3.6−2.2Broad Street −2.8−1.7Winnipeg StreetSaskatchewan Avenue east end;\n\nArcola Avenue west end −1.9−1.2Victoria AvenueFormer Hwy 33 western terminus 0.00.0 Ring Road (Hwy 6)Interchange; northern terminus of Hwy 33 4.93.0 Hwy 1 (TCH) (Regina Bypass) – Moose Jaw, WinnipegInterchange; exit 234 on Hwy 1 Edenwold No. 158​13.58.4 Hwy 624 north – Pilot Butte Lajord No. 128Kronau23.714.7 Hwy 622 – Balgonie, Riceton Lajord36.122.4 Hwy 621 – Lewvan Francis No. 127Sedley49.530.8 Hwy 620 north Francis61.938.5 Hwy 35 – Qu'Appelle, Weyburn Fillmore No. 96Osage87.454.3 Hwy 711 – Cedoux Fillmore100.862.6 Hwy 606 north – MontmartreWest end of Hwy 606 concurrency 101.963.3 Hwy 606 south – GriffinEast end of Hwy 606 concurrency Creelman113.070.2 Hwy 701 east Tecumseh No. 65Stoughton138.986.3 Hwy 47 – Grenfell, Estevan\n\nTo Hwy 13 – Arcola, Carlyle, WeyburnHwy 33 eastern terminus 1.000 mi = 1.609 km; 1.000 km = 0.621 mi\n\nConcurrency terminus\n\nRoute transition\n\nGallery\n\nHighway 33 through Creelman\n\nVillage of Creelman\n\nHighway 33 through Fillmore\n\nReferences\n\nA document from Saskatchewan Highways and Transportation: Winter Highway Conditions\n\nSaskatchewan Highways Website-- Highway Numbering\n\nLajord, Saskatchewan\n\nSaskatchewan Road Map RV Itineraries\n\nBig Things of Canada, A Celebration of Community Monuments of Canada\n\nOsage, Saskatchewan"
