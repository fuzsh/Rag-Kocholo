        "text": "Provincial legislation requires the registration of a business name if it is different than your own personal name.\n\nBefore you register a business with the Corporate Registry, you must conduct a province-wide name search to ensure that no other business has registered an identical or very similar name to the one you want to use for your business. A nation-wide business name search is also an option.\n\nSelect a business name that best suits your business and submit it to the Corporate Registry for approval.\n\nCorporate Registry, Information Services Corporation\n\n1-866-275-4721\n\nOnce you have reserved a business name, you can register your business. A major decision as you start your new business is the type of ownership it will take. There are three basic structures any business can take, each having different implications for liability, taxation and succession.\n\nSole Proprietorship is a business with one owner. That owner may be an individual or a corporation. The owner is personally liable for all the debts of the business and pays personal income tax on the net taxable income generated by the business.\n\nPartnership is a business owned by two or more individuals or corporations (in any combination). Within a partnership, each partner is potentially liable for all debts of the partnership and includes their share of income or losses on personal or corporate tax returns.\n\nCorporation is a legal entity that has a separate legal existence apart from its shareholders and directors. It is sometimes also referred to as a ‘limited company'. Since it has a separate legal existence from its shareholders and directors, they are generally not personally liable for the debts of the corporation beyond the amount contributed. Although it is the shareholders which ‘own' a corporation, it is the directors who manage the day-to-day operations. A corporation has to pay tax on its net taxable income and files a separate income tax return. A corporation can be federally or provincially incorporated.\n\nThere are many differences between sole proprietors, partnerships, and corporations. For explanations of each structure, as well as advantages and disadvantages, talk to one of Square One’s business information officers or consult with a lawyer on the legal differences of each business structure.\n\nCorporate Registry, Information Services Corporation\n\n1-866-275-4721\n\nAll businesses or persons providing a good or service in Saskatoon must obtain a City of Saskatoon business licence. The City of Saskatoon licenses businesses to ensure compliance with land use and building regulations, to minimize land use conflicts, to gather land use information upon which commercial and industrial policies are based, and to facilitate effective planning decisions.\n\nThe type of licence required is dependent on the business you operate, as well as its location. Several types of businesses have additional approvals or licences that are required in order to operate. In some cases these approvals are required before a City of Saskatoon business licence can be approved.\n\nApplication forms are available on the City of Saskatoon website. All business licence applications are reviewed for compliance with relevant City bylaws and land use regulations. If your application is approved, you will receive written confirmation by mail, along with your business licence, in approximately 2-3 weeks. A business licence is valid for one year from the date it is issued, unless otherwise stated on the licence.\n\nCity of Saskatoon, Business Licence Program\n\n306-975-2760"
