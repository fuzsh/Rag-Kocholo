(2) Definitions.--In this subsection, the following definitions apply: (A) Small business concern.-- (i) In general.--The term ``small business concern'' means a small business concern (as the term is used in section 3 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632)).

(B) Socially and economically disadvantaged individuals.--The term ``socially and economically disadvantaged individuals'' has the meaning given the term in section 8(d) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(d)) and relevant subcontracting regulations issued pursuant to that Act, except that women shall be presumed to be socially and economically disadvantaged individuals for purposes of this subsection. (3) Amounts for small business concerns.--Except to the extent that the Secretary determines otherwise, not less than 10 percent of the amounts made available for any program under titles I, II, III, and VI of this Act and section 403 of title 23, United States Code, shall be expended through small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals. (4) Annual listing of disadvantaged business enterprises.-- Each State shall annually-- (A) survey and compile a list of the small business concerns referred to in paragraph (3) in the State, including [[Page 129 STAT. 1325]] the location of the small business concerns in the State; and (B) notify the Secretary, in writing, of the percentage of the small business concerns that are controlled by-- (i) women; (ii) socially and economically disadvantaged individuals (other than women); and (iii) individuals who are women and are otherwise socially and economically disadvantaged individuals.

(8) Sense of congress on prompt payment of dbe subcontractors.--It is the sense of Congress that-- (A) the Secretary should take additional steps to ensure that recipients comply with section 26.29 of title 49, Code of Federal Regulations (the disadvantaged business enterprises prompt payment rule), or any corresponding regulation, in awarding federally funded transportation contracts under laws and regulations administered by the Secretary; and (B) such additional steps should include increasing the Department's ability to track and keep records of complaints and to make that information publicly available.
