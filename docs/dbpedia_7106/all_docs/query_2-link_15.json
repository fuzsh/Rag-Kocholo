Unfortunately, costs for equipment, fuel, materials and labor out pace the tax revenue coming into their maintenance funds. Preventive maintenance on roads and bridges provide the best \"value\" to the taxpayer by extending the \"life/condition\" of a road or bridge. Average costs are shown below.\n\n$100,000 per mile for asphalt overlays (2\").\n\n$15,000 to $20,000 per mile for gravel (4\") but dependent on hauling distance from a rock quarry.\n\n$250,000 minimum cost for a new road grader.\n\n$120,000 minimum cost for a new dump truck.\n\n$450,000 minimum cost to replace a short single span bridge by a contractor.\n\n$1,000,000 minimum cost to grade, drain and surface one roadway mile by a contractor.\n\nCounty Commissioner Districts"
