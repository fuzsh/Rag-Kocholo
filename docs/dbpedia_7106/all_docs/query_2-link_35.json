If the percent difference falls within our acceptable threshold (Acceptable Percent Change Criteria), we use the incoming data to estimate AADT; otherwise, we request a recount.Â For more details visit the Data Screening and Recounts section of the Collection Methods page.\n\nAdjusted Count â raw traffic count that we adjust by the specific month and day-of-the-week Seasonal Adjustment Factor (SAF) from its assigned âcluster groupâ. If applicable, we may also use an axle correction factor (ACF).\n\nAnnual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) â the roadway estimates of total vehicles on a road segment on any given day of the year (all directions of travel). This represents the total number of vehicles per year divided by 365 and is developed using factors to adjust for season, day of the week, and vehicle type.\n\nArterial Road – may be classified as major or minor; high volume urban road whose main function is to deliver traffic from collector roads to freeways and to/from urban centers.\n\nAutomatic Traffic Recorder (ATR) â permanent device in the pavement that automatically and continuously collects traffic data.Â\n\nAverage Daily Load (ADL) - the estimate of a daily vehicle load on a roadway segment; calculated from the daily total vehicle type multiplied by their appropriate ESAL factors.\n\nAverage Daily Traffic (ADT) - a 24-hour traffic volume that should be qualified by a time period, (e.g., MADT â monthly average daily traffic; or ADT for the period 6/21/11-6/23/11)\n\nAxle Correction Factor (ACF) - adjusts for vehicles with 3 or more axles that contribute additional axle hits to the raw 48 hour traffic count. These factors are calculated from vehicle classification counts and are only used on the Trunk Highway system.\n\nAxle Load â the total weight transmitted by all wheels in a single, tandem (2), or tridem (3) axle configuration.\n\nBase Year â in a traffic forecast, the year construction will be completed and the roadway will be open to traffic.\n\nBituminous – type of paved asphalt road resembling or containing bitumen, typically black or near black in color.\n\nBituminous ESAL (BESAL) â the equivalent single axle load for a bituminous or flexible pavement.\n\nCartographic Representations – map features and symbols used for representation purposes and usually not to scale.\n\nCartography – the study and practice of making maps or representations of the Earth on a flat surface.\n\nCluster Group â set of ATR locations with similar traffic pattern characteristics; each group has a set of Seasonal Adjustment Factors (SAF) for each month of the year.

If the adjusted count falls within the âAcceptable Percent Changeâ criteria, it is determined valid, and this new data will help establish the official AADT calculation. If the adjusted count falls outside of the âAcceptable Percent Changeâ criteria, the count needs further examination.
