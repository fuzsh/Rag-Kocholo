        "text": "A pedestrian lane is an interim or temporary pedestrian facility that may be appropriate on roads with low to moderate speeds and volumes. A pedestrian lane is a designated space on the roadway for exclusive use of pedestrians. The lane may be on one or both sides of the roadway and can fill gaps between important destinations in a community.\n\nNote: The following guidance features expanded content and minor differences from that in the FHWA Small Town and Rural Multimodal Networks document. Please refer to FHWA's website for the formal presentation of this facility type.\n\nDetroit is a hub of activity during the summer months. Kane’s Marina is one of a limited locations to access the lake. In addition to the boat ramp and docks, Kane’s has a store, a tavern, and a recreational vehicle (RV) park. As the only access to Kane’s Marina, Clester Road is a busy collector street during the boating, moorage, and RV season. This road funnels a lot of vehicle traffic—RVs, boats, trailers, trucks, cars—as well as heavy foot and bicycle traffic to and from Kane’s Marina and the neighborhood and downtown Detroit.\n\nThe high volume of vehicles coupled with an identified speeding problem created safety concerns because of the large amount of bicycle and foot traffic that also use Clester Road. The City eventually installed two speed bumps, which appeared to slow traffic down somewhat but prior to the installation of the pedestrian lane, there was no accommodation for people walking or on bikes.\n\nWith the award of a Special City Allotment Grant in the 2013-14 grant cycle, the City of Detroit was able to resurface Clester Road and install the pedestrian lane. Adding the pedestrian lane on Clester Road fits in with the long-range plans for a bicycle and pedestrian trail from Lyons and Mehama to Idanha. Additionally the City of Detroit in conjunction with the US Forest Service is developing a city park that will also serve as the gateway center for the Cascading Rivers Scenic Bikeway which runs from Detroit to Estacada."
