        "text": "The Saskatchewan Highway Hotline has been operating for more then 50 years. Now, it has a new feature for drivers planning a road trip.\n\nThe new feature is called Track My Plow, and can be accessed through the highway hotline website or a phone app.\n\nThe province's snowplows have transmitters that track their locations, allowing the hotline site to show when and where there was recent road maintenance.\n\nThe website will also allow users to hover over a plow, click on it then scroll to zoom in on the route it has taken.\n\n\"The plows leave a trail of markers behind them,\" said Minister of Highways Lori Carr. \"They tell you if your route has been treated yet and when.\n\n\"When you combine this information with our description of the road conditions, the review of your public forecast, you can leave armed with the information you need for your journey.\"\n\nCarr said staff are working 24/7 to ensure travellers are informed.\n\nShe said that this new feature is a pilot project that she hopes the public will use before winter travel.\n\n\"We think it will be a game-changer,\" she said."
