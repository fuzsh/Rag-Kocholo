        "text": "Laurie Thorsen says the Saskatchewan government‘s road work will ruin his business.\n\nThorsen has owned Full Circle Service Station, about 35 km north of Prince Albert, Sask., for decades.\n\nIn that time, he said there’s never been an accident on his southern approach.\n\nNow there can’t be, because government road crews have torn it up and won’t rebuild it.\n\n“(Business) will be 40 to 60 per cent down,” he said, “and I don’t know what would happen after that.”\n\nThorsen said most customers stop at the gas station, restaurant and small store on their way north.\n\nA government refurbishment project is redoing the sides of Highway 2 to make the area safer.\n\nThorsen told Global News that keeping only one entrance will make the corner dangerous, because the approximately 20 large trucks that stop every day will have to make a hard right turn.\n\n“(The southern approach lane) is the only way they can get into the property,” he said.\n\n“Otherwise they have to turn in, make a big loop — it’s impossible to come any other way.”\n\nHe said the government informed him of the change several months ago and he’s always told them it wasn’t feasible.\n\nTrending Now\n\nMpox is on the rise. What Canadians need to know as the virus spreads\n\nCanadian Olympian Eric Lamaze owes nearly $800K following latest court ruling\n\nHe said the government representative told him the approach would have to be farther away, which puts it in the path of two houses.\n\nGlobal News asked the Ministry of Highways for comment and if they would rebuild the lane.\n\nIn a statement, a spokesperson said safety is a top priority.\n\n“In this case, all appropriate steps have been taken and the landowner in question has been advised of the work that will be taking place,” it read.\n\nThorsen said he was hoping for a little compassion and understanding, given what the roadwork means for his business.\n\n“I’ve been doing this for 50 years,” he said, “and it’s not very rewarding to get it taken away.”"
