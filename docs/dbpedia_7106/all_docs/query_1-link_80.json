        "text": "Understand\n\n[edit]\n\nThe 2,660 km (1,650 mi) Yellowhead Highway is one of multiple highways which compose the Trans-Canada Highway system; in all four western provinces (BC, AB, SK, MB) it is numbered as provincial Highway 16, with exception of the easternmost 100 km (62 mi) which follows Manitoba Highway 1. The route leads through remote and sparsely-populated areas due to its more northern alignment, including many native First Nation communities; in BC it is known as the Highway of Tears due to a number of hitchhikers missing or dead over the years.\n\nIn the prairies, the Yellowhead Highway begins in Winnipeg (population 700,000) and passes through two large cities: Edmonton (metro population 1.1 million), Saskatoon (population 250,000). Prince George is accessible from the BC Lower Mainland via BC Highway 97 (which extends US 97) but further west the route is isolated. In Terrace, the only other highway (BC 37) runs north through mountainous terrain to the Alaska Highway in the Yukon; in Prince Rupert, the only access is by coastal ferry, by air or by following the Yellowhead Highway's path by road or rail. No road follows the rugged BC coastline north from Powell River to Prince Rupert. While this itinerary describes travel by road, it is possible to make the same trip by rail by taking the main Vancouver-Toronto train, The Canadian, in Winnipeg to the town of Jasper (in Jasper National Park) and transfer to the two-day Jasper-Prince Rupert train.\n\nThe Southern Yellowhead Highway (BC Highway 5), is a spur route which runs from Tête Jaune Cache, a small village west of the Alberta border, south to Kamloops and the Lower Mainland, and is the shortest highway route between Edmonton and Vancouver. The section south of Kamloops is a 4-6 lane freeway known as the Coquihalla Highway, which also functions as the preferred route to the 2 lane Trans-Canada Highway between Kamloops and Hope.\n\nGo\n\n[edit]\n\n, Manitoba is the eastern terminus of the Yellowhead Highway and the provincial capital, beginning at historic Portage and Main in the city's downtown. Nearby at The Forks, there is a display commemorating the Yellowhead Highway at Johnston Terminal. The Yellowhead Highway travels west on Portage Avenue, with Highway 1 (Trans-Canada Highway mainline) joining route a few blocks to the west, leaving Winnipeg to (population 13,000). Portage la Prairie was built around 1838 fur trade post Fort La Reine (now a 25-building museum); canoes were carried overland from Lake Manitoba to the Assiniboine River. The city became a railway crossroads; between 1942-1992, a military base trained fighter pilots. As passengers left the rails to take to the open road, Trans-Canada Highway 1 followed the Canadian Pacific rails, while Yellowhead Highway 16 followed the Canadian National line west to Prince Rupert. The Yellowhead Highway leaves the four-lane divided highway and joins Trans-Canada Highway 16, passing through (population 4,600) and (2,400), with Riding Mountain National Park 30 minutes north of Minnedosa on Highway 10 for those wanting to make a detour. The highway continues through (population 1,400) before crossing the Saskatchewan border.\n\nThe highway continues into Saskatchewan to (population 15,000), and agricultural community and regional service centre that's home of the Yorkton Film Festival. The highway passes through Wynyard, Lanigan, and north of , located on Little Manitou Lake which is known as the \"Dead Sea of Canada\". It becomes a four-lane, divided highway and passes through (pop. 325,000), the province's largest city located on the banks of the South Saskatchewan River and home to the University of Saskatchewan. The highway continues to , consisting of North Battleford (population 14,000) and Battleford (population 4,000) which are separated by the North Saskatchewan River, to the provincially-divided city of , where the Alberta-Saskatchewan border runs right down 50th Avenue (Meridian Avenue) in the centre of town. Unlike other twin cities, such as Niagara Falls Ontario/New York or Kansas City Missouri/Kansas, Lloydminster is legally one city (pop 30,000) despite being in two provinces. Its primary industries are petroleum refining and agriculture.\n\nIt continues west through (population 4,000) to (population 5,700), an agricultural community with strong Ukrainian immigrant heritage and home of the world's largest Ukrainian Easter egg. The road continues through , home of aspen wilderness parkland and protected wildlife which is less than an hour from the sprawling city. It leaves the park and passes through the bedroom community of Sherwood Park to , the provincial capital. The northernmost city of at least one million people in North America, Edmonton was founded for the fur trade in 1795; it became an oil boom town after prospectors struck black gold in nearby Leduc County in 1947. The city is home to the University of Alberta and the West Edmonton Mall, which is the largest shopping centre in North America.\n\nIt leaves Edmonton and passes through bedroom communities of Spruce Grove and Stony Plain, the recreational lakeside village of , and the twin communities of Entwistle and Evansburg before entering the Rocky Mountain foothills at (population 8,400). The road passes over Obed Summit (elevation 1,164 metres or 3,819 feet), the highest point on the Yellowhead Highway mainline despite not being in the mountains, and through (population 9,900) on eastern edge of the Rocky Mountains. The road becomes a two-lane highway west of town and enters Jasper National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, Jasper National Park covers 10,878 square kilometres (4,200 square miles), containing more than 1,200 kilometres (750 miles) of hiking trails, glaciers, mountains, valleys, meadows, forests and rivers; the town of (population 5,200) is inside the park and is the northern terminus of the iconic Icefields Parkway. The route then crosses Yellowhead Pass (elevation 1,131 metres or 3,711 feet) into British Columbia.\n\nUpon entering British Columbia, the passes though Mount Robson Provincial Park (also a UNESCO World Heritage Site), home of its namesake mountain which is the tallest peak in the Canadian Rockies. The highway meets up with its southern branch at and then continues west through McBride to (popuation 72,000), the main northern service centre and forestry community on the confluence of the Nechako and Fraser Rivers. It continues to (population 4,500), a farming town on one of the few flatlands in the area; (population 5,800), an alpine-themed town with lakes and a ski hill; as well as . The highway continues on to , the highway intersects with Highway 37 (Stewart-Cassiar Highway) for travel up to the Yukon. Further along the Yellowhead Highway is (population 12,500 people), which features significant Indigenous culture. The highway arrives at , a small port city of 13,000 people, many of them Indigenous. It serves as a connection point for BC Ferries, Alaska Marine Highway System, Air Canada, Hawkair and seaplane operators to offload passengers and cargo onto road and rail, but also hosts various museums (railway, First Nations, canneries) and provides a port of call to cruise ships.\n\nFrom Prince Rupert, BC Ferries offers a 6½-hour ferry to Haida Gwaii (formerly known the as the \"Queen Charlotte Islands\"); the sparsely populated islands lie 40–65 kilometres (25–40 miles) off the coast of British Columbia and are the westernmost point on the Trans-Canada Highway system. The ferry lands in and travels north on Graham Island to the western terminus of the Yellowhead Highway at .\n\nSouth Yellowhead/Coquihalla Highway\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Southern Yellowhead Highway (Highway 5) leaves the main branch of the Yellowhead Highway at Tete Jaune Cache and heads south (population 1,000) and (population 2,300), which is the access area to the 5,220-square-kilometre (2,020-square-mile) Wells Gray Provincial Park. The highway continues to (population 90,000), billed as the Tournament Capital of Canada, passing the turnoff to Sun Peaks ski resort at its northern boundary. It joins Trans-Canada Highway, and continues as the Coquihalla Highway where the Trans-Canada Highway branches west. The highway passes over Surrey Lake Summit (elevation 1,444 metres or 4,738 feet) and through (population 7,000) in the Nicola Valley, where travellers can detour onto BC Highway 97C and connect to the Okanagan, a popular vacation region. The highway continues through Cascade Mountains, through Coquhalla Pass (elevation 1,244 metres or 4,081 feet), to its southern terminus in (population 6,100) on the far eastern boundary of BC's Lower Mainland, where the Trans-Canada Highway (BC Highway 1) continues along the freeway towards Vancouver. A scenic alternative to the Coquihalla Highway (freeway) between Kamloops and Hope is to take the Trans-Canada Highway (Highway 1) through the Fraser Canyon."
