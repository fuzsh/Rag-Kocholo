The RM will attempt to enter into a new agreement with the City of Moose Jaw in the future.\n\nPlease be advised that CN rail will be replacing a crossing located on highway #301 as per the link June 19 & 20. Work will take the full 2 days and wonâ€™t be open overnight. The road will be closed and will be detoured on Twp Rd 172 (North Service Rd/Lasby Road).\n\nMoose Jaw 301 Crossing Detour REVISED 2\n\nDetour (002)\n\nThe RM of Caron No. 162 will be hosting a grain bag recycling day at the Caron Waste Transfer station just east of Caron on Tuesday, June 18, 2024 from 9 am to 3 pm in cooperation with Clean Farms. Attached is a poster, map and 3 step instruction card regarding the event. If you would like to recycle bags it would be greatly appreciated if they could call the RM of Caron 162 and let them know how many bags they are planning on bringing at 306 692-2293 or email [email protected]. Bags must be clean of debris and rolled to be accepted.\n\nPlease note the attached map as the waste transfer station should be assessed off of the Trans Canada Highway via Range Road 2290 to avoid the thin membrane paved Caron access which has a 8 mt weight restriction on it. The alternate route is the Caron 643 grid.\n\nPoster Grain bag recycle day RM Caron June18 2024 final\n\n2024 collection day 3 steps\n\nmap recycling location"
