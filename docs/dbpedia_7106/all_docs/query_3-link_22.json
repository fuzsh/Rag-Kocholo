        "text": "The Ministry of Highways is divided into the Operations, Policy and Programs, and Corporate Services Divisions and the Communications Branch. The ministry is the employer of over 1,476 employees diversified amongst 105 communities in Saskatchewan.[1] The current Minister of Highways and Infrastructure is Jeremy Cockrill.[1]\n\nQuick Facts Organization overview, Formed ...\n\nMinistry of HighwaysOrganization overviewFormed1917Employees1,476Minister responsibleParent OrganizationGovernment of SaskatchewanWebsitewww.highways.gov.sk.ca\n\nClose\n\nThe Operation Division has the responsibility of maintaining 9,249 kilometres (5,747 mi) of asphalt concrete pavements, 4,929 kilometres (3,063 mi) of granular pavements, 6,102 kilometres (3,792 mi) of thin membrane surface (TMS) highways, 5,621 kilometres (3,493 mi) of gravel highways, 171 kilometres (106 mi) of ice roads, 805 kilometres (500 mi) bridges, 453 kilometres (281 mi) large culverts, 12 ferries, one barge and 17 northern airports. Operational maintenance includes surface repair activities like crack filling, sealing, and patching; snow and ice control; pavement marking; signing; and ferry operations. Along with engineering, construction and design of the provincial road network, the operations division provides regulations, inspections and advice to the rural municipalities (R.M.) for the municipal road network.[1]\n\nFerries\n\nAll ferries in Saskatchewan are operated by the Government of Saskatchewan and, with the exception of the Wollaston Barge Ferry, are toll free. All are seasonal, with ferries generally operating from mid-April to mid-November, depending on ice conditions. The ferries operated include:[2]\n\nCecil Ferry\n\nClarkboro Ferry\n\nEstuary Ferry\n\nFenton Ferry\n\nHague Ferry\n\nLancer Ferry\n\nLemsford Ferry\n\nPaynton Ferry\n\nRiverhurst Ferry\n\nSt. Laurent Ferry\n\nWeldon Ferry\n\nWingard Ferry\n\nWollaston Barge Ferry\n\nDuring the term of office for Eiling Kramer, 1972–1980, the Provincial Highway received extensive funding and paving for the entire system neared completion.[3] Saskatchewan Highway 11 was restructured under the term of office of David Boldt, Minister 1966-1971.[4] John T. Douglas, during his term of office 1944-1960 established the Saskatchewan Transportation Company as a Crown Corporation of the government.[5] Alan Carl Stewart, Minister of Highways 1929-1934, allocated $20 million for highway construction in Saskatchewan.[6] George Spence, Minister of Highways 1927-1929, was responsible for the initiation of numbering Saskatchewan highways.[7]\n\nThe first Board of Highways Commissioners was appointed by the provincial government in 1912, and the first Department of Highways was established in 1917.[8] On September 1, 1934, the name was changed from the Department of Highways to the Department of Highways and Transportation. Effective November 21, 2007 the Department of Highways and Transportation became the Ministry of Highways and Infrastructure.[9]\n\nUp until 1904 all municipal affairs were administered by the Territorial Dept. of Public Works. In 1904, [Churchbridge]...became a portion of a larger area known as a Local Improvement District of approximately 144 square miles (370 km2) square miles...Road construction costs around 1900, were very low. The cost of building a road 20 feet (6.1 m) wide with an 0 feet 18 inches (0.46 m) crown cost approximately $30, per 1 mile (1.6 km)\n\n—The First Hundred Years : Around Churchbridge, 1880-1980.[10]\n\nA person could work for the municipality and have his earnings put toward the taxes on his land; at one time, money collected in each Division stayed in that Division....The RM has as its responsibilities for many areas: agricultural programs and concerns in general; tax collections for needs of the municipality — road construction and maintenance; protective services — pest control, fire protection, weed control, environmental development, cultural and educational services; medical and veterinary needs and so forth.\n\nOriginally roadwork was done by horsepower, and the municipality owned its horses and equipment. It was found that roadwork under the supervision of a councilor cost half as much as that under a road commission system. There were problems with labor. One cold November payday the whole crew quit, with not one left to even feed the horses. In 1909 a foreman shot one of his crew; the [Indian Head] council minutes make no further comment.\n\n—History of Indian Head and District Inc., Indian Head: history of Indian Head and district (1981)[12]\n\nThe building of these roads is under the personal supervision of the rural councilors of the R.M. The Provincial Government each year makes a substantial grant to the Municipality for permanent trunk road building.\n\n—Moosomin, Saskatchewan. Board of Trade, Progressive Moosomin, industrial and commercial centre of Saskatchewan(1981)[13]\n\nIn 1913 the road system consisted of miles of prairie trails. The roads gradually improved with the assistance of jointly funded Provincial and Municipal road programs such as the Grid Road program, the Main Farm Access program, and the Super Grid system which led to the eventual formation of Municipal Maintenance Areas. The RM's of Gull Lake, Carmichael, and Webb formed Maintenance Area No. 1, the first in the Province.\n\n—Sask Biz Piapot No. 110[14]\n\nThe Policy and Programs Division works with other legislative and regulatory agencies to ensure an optimal transportation network is provided via road, rail, air, and marine.[1]\n\nCorporate Services Division is responsible for the budgeting, finances, and forecasting for the needs of the Ministry of Highways and Infrastructure.[1]\n\nThe Communications Branch of the Ministry of Highways and Infrastructure maintains the news releases, safety awareness and education programs.[1]\n\nThe 14 detachments operate six border and seven interior weigh stations, three 24-hour self-weigh decks and one Mobile Vehicle Inspection Station. The head office regulates their operations in compliance with the Commercial Vehicle Safety Alliance and the Canadian Council Motor Transport Administrators.[15] They are a member of the Saskatchewan Protection and Response Team (PRT) responsible for reducing rural crime throughout the province.\n\nArea Transportation Planning (ATP) Support Program analyzes transportation in regional areas to provide funding for regional needs.[1] Committees which comprise representatives from the local rural and urban municipalities, Regional Economic Development Authorities (REDA), Saskatchewan Urban Municipalities Association, Saskatchewan Association of Rural Municipalities, and Highways and Infrastructure analyze local needs and the effects of the increased use of grain via truck transportation and the decreased use of rail transport is having on road infrastructure.[16] There are currently 9 committees which comprise the majority of Saskatchewan except for an area near La Ronge and Southend.\n\nAthabasica Basin Transportation Planning Committee\n\nNorth North West Transportation Planning Committee\n\nNorth North East Transportation Planning Committee\n\nWest Central Transportation Planning Committee\n\nCentral Transportation Planning Committee\n\nNorth East Area Transportation Planning Committee\n\nEast Central Transportation Planning Committee\n\nSouth East Transportation Planning Committee\n\nSouth Central Transportation Planning Committee\n\nSouthwest Transportation Planning Committee\n\nGroups or individuals may sponsor a 3 kilometres (1.9 mi) stretch of highway to pick up litter and maintain highway appearances.[18]\n\nMore information Term, Minister ...\n\nMinisters historically TermMinisterTitleAdministrationSource January 6, 2020 – PresentHonourable Fred BradshawHighways and Transportation Ministerunder Scott Moe[1] November 20, 2020 - January 6, 2020Honourable Joe HargraveHighways and Transportation Ministerunder Scott Moe[1] November 21, 2007Honourable Wayne ElhardHighways and Transportation Ministerunder Brad Wall[1] October 12, 2001 – November 21, 2007Honourable Mark WartmanHighways and Transportation Ministerunder Lorne Calvert[19] February 8, 2001- October 12, 2001Honourable Patricia AtkinsonHighways and Transportation Ministerunder Lorne Calvert[19] September 30, 1999 – February 8, 2001Honourable Maynard SonntagHighways and Transportation Ministerunder Roy Romanow[20] June 27, 1997- September 30, 1999Honourable Judy Llewellyn BradleyHighways and Transportation Ministerunder Roy Romanow[21][22] April 29, 1997 – June 27, 1997Honourable Clay J.
