Saskatchewan Evolutionary Changes\n\nEvolution of Saskatchewan's boundaries\n\nPresent-day Saskatchewan was first named Rupert's Land\n\nMany of the early settlers in the 1800's came as traders or hunters. The North West Company was of French-Canadian extraction and traders arrived out west in Saskatchewan from EasternCanada via inland routes. The British (in 1670) had given Rupert's Land to the Hudson Bay Company whichgave the company dominion over lands where there was water passageway from the Hudson Bay. These traders arrived to the Saskatchewan area via Hudson Bay and then travelling westward. In 1774the first inland trading post (Cumberland House) was built in Saskatchewan. Many documents refer to areas of Saskatchewan by the geophysical features by the name of the river, lake or group of hills. At this time northern Saskatchewan was settled as southern Saskatchewan had experienced drought like conditions duringearly explorer expeditions, and was considered a part of the US desert. This area is north of the tree line in the geo-physical shield area.\n\nCanada became a nation in 1867. Saskatchewan didn't become a province of Canada until 1905, before this it was a part of the NorthWest Territories. The North West Territories was divided into provisional territories on May 8, 1882. The south provisional district was named Assiniboia (The 33rd township southward to the U.A Canada border).The provisional district in central present-day Saskatchewan (between township 35 and township 70) was named Saskatchewan. AndAthabaska was the provisional district of the North West Territories for the northern portionof present day Saskatchewan (Township 71 and northward to the District of MacKenzie NWT at the present border between Saskatchewan and the NWT). These provisional districts did not use the current eastern and western boundaries, but extended to range 10 west of the 4th meridian now known as Alberta and the district of Saskatchewan had an eastern border at Lake Winnipeg.\n\nAtlas of Saskatchewan Maps showing boundary evolution.\n\nIn the late 1800's and early 1900's the railway and the Dominion Government of Canada wanted more settlers out west to unite Upper and Lower Canada -the eastern provinces of Canada with British Columbia. The rail lines didn't want to lay track over land with no settlement as it wasn'teconomically feasible. The demand for furs declined, the buffalo population declined, Saskatchewanstarted noticing the agricultural land capabilities in the middle and southern portions of the province, the early drought that Captain John Palliser had seen was over. The population in Saskatchewan evolved from a trapping community a farming community. Settlement, towns and rail lines developed the plains, or prairies, south of the tree line.\n\nEarly towns were established and had a post office. If a town cannot be located because it closed down as population migrated to the larger centers, it can be located by its post office. Locating a town no longer in existence will help trace where to locate the records for the family- which newspapers to look in, cemeteries, church records to search, etc. Quite a few changes in town names and locations are shown on the 60 years Sask Wheat Pool - 1924 Map and 1984 Map . Another online method of determining town location is by using National Archives Archivia Net and use the post office locator database. The Canadian Geographical Names web page by Department of Natural Resources Canada is also an excellent way to locate towns in Saskatchewan.\n\nLand Improvement Districts were pre-cursors to the present Rural Municpalities. It was a community effort to network for schools, and essential services such as fire departments etc in their area. Rural Municipalities of Saskatchewan"
