        "text": "The residents of Saskatchewan need to know when and where they are allowed to burn in Saskatchewan â€“ and municipalities/rural municipalities play an important role in making that happen.\n\nMunicipalities, regional, and national parks have the authority to ban open burning in their areas of responsibility, while the SPSA can restrict open burning in provincial forests, parks and Crown land. Only in the most extreme situations would the SPSA consider restricting burning in all rural municipalities.\n\nThe SPSA strongly encourages all municipalities to pass fire restriction bylaws that meet their local need. Local leaders are in the best position to determine when and where burning should be restricted within their municipality.\n\nSample rural fire ban bylaws and a burn permit are available to rural municipalities on this page. All municipalities are strongly encouraged to obtain independent legal advice prior to adopting bylaws.\n\nAs always, SPSA Emergency Services Officers and Response Officers are available to meet with municipal officials to discuss all aspects of emergency planning, including fire restriction bylaws.\n\nTo add or remove a fire ban, municipalities should call 1-866-404-4911."
