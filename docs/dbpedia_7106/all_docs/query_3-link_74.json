        "text": "LLOYDMINSTER – Alberta and Saskatchewan will work partner on a Highway 17 passing lanes project north of Lloydminster.\n\nThe inter-provincial project is moving forward after the two provinces cemented an even closer working relationship by signing the Collaboration on the Advancement of Economic Corridors Memorandum of Understanding (MOU).\n\n“Saskatchewan has already done amazing advance work on a passing lanes strategy and it is exciting to see that will support this major Highway 17 project,” said Saskatchewan Highways Minister Lori Carr. “We know passing lanes make highways safer, are cost effective and support Saskatchewan’s strong and growing export-based economy, which allows our government to invest in the services and quality of life our citizens expect.”\n\nOnce completed, the highway will have three sets of new passing lanes installed on a 46.75-kilometre-long segment of Highway 17 stretching from Lloydminster and heading north. Like Lloydminster, Highway 17 also straddles the Alberta-Saskatchewan border.\n\n“Alberta is proud to work with Saskatchewan to advance these economic corridor projects that will improve the efficiency of our transportation networks, provide safe travel on these highways, and promote economic development opportunities,” said Devin Dreeshen, Alberta minister of transportation and economic corridors.\n\nThe project’s design is expected to be completed in 2025. Tendering will follow with on-road construction expected no earlier than 2025.\n\nThe project’s cost won’t be known until the design and tendering are completed.\n\nTraffic on Highway 17 currently ranges from approximately 1,700 to 6,000 vehicles per day. Some of the key transportation users in the area include commuters, along with the agricultural and energy sectors.\n\nThe Alberta and Saskatchewan governments are also collaborating on plans to complete the La Loche to Fort McMurray all-weather road, which is known as Highway 956 near Garson Lake, SK."
