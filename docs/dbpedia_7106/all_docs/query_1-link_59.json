        "text": "Driving across the prairies can be, well, less than exciting for lack of a better phrase. Despite the seemingly endless flat, there are lot's of fun and exciting things to see and do. Check out these attractions to help break up the drive and infuse a little adventure!\n\nT-Rex Discovery Centre, Eastend\n\nTake a gander at Scotty, the massive T-Rex skeleton who just edged out Sue as the world's largest (and by 'just edged out' we mean by 400 kgs). You can also check out the rest of the specimens and even hone your inner paleontologist at the outdoor 'dig pit'!\n\nhttp://www.visitcypresshills.ca/attractions/t-rex-discovery-centre/\n\nMac the Moose, Moose Jaw\n\nWe might as well continue with the 'World's Largest' theme. Enter Mac, who at the time of writing, is currently undergoing an 'antlerectomy' (antler enlargement) to reclaim his throne from 'The Big Elk' in Norway as the world's largest moose. No matter what you do, you MUST stop and get a picture with Mac!\n\nhttps://www.tourismmoosejaw.com/\n\nSaskatchewan Science Centre, Regina\n\nLocated just off the highway, the interactive science centre is the perfect stop. And that, is a scientific FACT! Anchorman references aside, it really is a great place to bust out your beakers and get your science on. Aside from the regular exhibits, there's always something else going on so be sure to check out the website first.\n\nhttps://www.sasksciencecentre.com/\n\nKenosee Superslides, Moose Mountain Provincial Park\n\nThis one is definitely worth the 30 minute drive from the highway! Slip, slide and lazy river away your day at the waterpark, a great way to beat the prairie heat. While you're there, check out some nature at Moose Mountain Provincial Park, or better yet, pitch a tent!\n\nhttp://www.kenoseesuperslides.ca/\n\nLittle Chicago Entertainment, Moose Jaw\n\nAl Capone was a pretty tough dude, wouldn't you say? If you were trapped in his office, think you could escape? This Moose Jaw escape room is a perfect way to, well, escape, from the drive across Saskatchewan. There's also ax throwing and board game room!\n\nhttps://littlechicagoentertainment.com/\n\nFort Walsh National Historic Site, Maple Creek\n\nTransform your car into a time travelling Delorean and discover what life was like in the lawless time of cowboys and whiskey runners. Experience the Northwest Mounted Police marching on parade and uncover the history of Canadaâ€™s part in the aftermath of the Battle of Little Big Horn. Guess you were right mom, history can be fun!\n\nhttp://www.visitcypresshills.ca/attractions/fort-walsh-national-historic-site/\n\nWascana Place, Regina\n\nBreaking up a long drive to stretch and get some physical activity is essential, and this is the absolute best place to accomplish that. Take an hour and stroll around the beautiful lake, you'll see the parliament building and gardens, speakers corner and the Albert street bridge (complete with buffalo head decorations), which holds the Guinness world record for longest bridge over the shortest span of water!\n\nPrairie Storm Paintball, Moose Jaw\n\nSpeaking of exercise, why not run around a field diving, ducking, dipping and dodging flying paintballs!? Prairie Storm Paintball has a variety of themed fields and also offers less intense nerf gun battles for the youngsters. Nothing like injecting a family road trip with a little fire by shooting each other with hard balls of paint!\n\nhttps://www.prairiestormpaintball.com/\n\nRCMP Heritage Centre, Regina\n\nThe Mounties have a played an integral role in the development of our fine country, a couple hours learning about that role is a couple hours well spent! Regina is the home to the RCMP 'Depot Division' and has been training cadets since 1885. Exhibits and interactive displays cater to all ages, making the heritage centre an ideal pit stop!\n\nCypress Hills Inter-Provincial Park, SW Saskatchewan\n\nSaskatchewan is pretty flat right? A quick 30 minute detour South of the highway (or taking a look at the picture above) might change your mind! The park is partially in Alberta too (hence the name Inter-Provincial) and is home to some of the highest elevations in Saskatchewan. Camping, day use, trails, swimming, interpretive centres, educational and interactive programs, you name it, they have it!\n\nhttp://www.visitcypresshills.ca/accommodations/campgrounds/chippsk/\n\nTunnels of Moose Jaw, Moose Jaw\n\nTwo theatrical tours (and we mean that, it's like a live play in front of you) would be a super fun break pretty much right in the middle of the drive across Saskatchewan. See what life was like for early Chinese immigrants to Canada or experience the days of bootlegging and Al Capone. Better yet, do both!\n\nhttps://www.tunnelsofmoosejaw.com/\n\nThere you have it, 11 road trip worthy things to see while driving across Saskatchewan! We'll let you in on a little hint though, there's a lot more than 11! Get out and explore what Saskatchewan has to offer! On you're drive, check out our free driving tour app as well. There's a tour from Moose Jaw to Alberta, and one from Moose Jaw to Manitoba (direction of travel doesn't matter). There's also walking tours in Regina, Moose Jaw, Whitewood and Maple Creek (so far), with more to come!"
