Backup running back Justin Rankin also chipped in with 60 yards on 10 carries as Edmonton ran all over Saskatchewan.\n\n“We just weren’t doing our job and being where we’re supposed to be,” said Milligan. “We’ve just got to get the corrections and when it’s time to play, just got to execute.”\n\nHaving lost two games in a row, Saskatchewan still sits in a tie atop the West Division with a 5-3 record alongside the B.C. Lions, who are up 1-0 in the season series between the two teams.\n\nThe Riders will now look to right the ship in Week 10 against the 5-2 Ottawa Redblacks on Thursday night (5:30 p.m., TSN) in the nation’s capital.\n\nThe Redblacks, who are 4-0 at home this season led by mobile quarterback Dru Brown, are coming off a bye week after beating the Calgary Stampeders 33-6 the week prior.\n\nArticle content\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nInjury news\n\nDespite returning to practice for the first time since suffering a knee injury in the third game the season, quarterback Trevor Harris has been ruled out of Thursday’s game in Ottawa.\n\nLinebacker Jameer Thurman (elbow) also won’t play this week, alongside receiver KeeSean Johnson (head), offensive lineman Ryan Sceviour (elbow) and linebacker Melique Straker (hamstring), who were all injured against the Elks.\n\nRunning back A.J.
