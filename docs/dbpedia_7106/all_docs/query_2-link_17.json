        "text": "The Transportation Data and Analytics (TDA) Office oversees and supports the FDOT Districts' collection and entry of highway data on the State Highway System and on non-State roads functionally classified as Rural Major Collector and above. These data include administrative items (road number & name, functional classification, federal system, urban location, etc.), geographic items (intersecting roads & interchanges, width, number of lanes, type of shoulder, etc.), and operational items (traffic data, speed limits, etc.). In addition to maintaining the highway data in the Roadway Characteristics Inventory, TDA provides procedures, handbooks, training, and quality control for the data collection and entry process. The highway data are available to Department personnel directly from the mainframe computer, and are also distributed in a variety of reports - both routine and ad hoc, as requested. Less traditional means include maps, videologs, and CD-ROMs. One of the Department's major data customers is the Federal Highway Administration, to which we supply an annual report based on Florida's part of the Highway Performance Monitoring System.\n\nProducts\n\nFederal Aid Systems - Lists and maps of all public roads that are functionally classified as higher than Local, including all State roads and many of the larger City and County roads; used by emergency response teams to determine funding eligibility and by anyone wanting to find names, locations, and other data about the major roads in Florida.\n\nFlorida Transportation Information DVD - Disk with variety of current and historical transportation data.
