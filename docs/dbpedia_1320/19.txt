SEATTLE -- Zoya Ivanova, old for her sport at 38, led a Soviet Union domination in the Goodwill Games women's marathon Sunday, breaking away from teammate Irina Bogacheva with eight miles to go.

Ivanova, who won $6,000 for her 10th victory in 23 marathons, finished the 26.2 mile race in a relatively slow 2:34:57.50 over a hilly, winding course called difficult by the runners.

Bogacheva finished second in 2:36:24.70, followed by Soviet Ramilya Barangulova in 2:37:40.70. Bogacheva also won the silver medal in the 1986 Goodwill Games.

American Lisa Kindelan, a Seattle-area native who learned only four days before the race that she would run, placed fourth in a time of 2:42:05.50.

U.S. runnners Leslie Lewis and Rosa Guitierrez placed fifth and sixth, respectively, while Soviet Nadezhda Gumerova, who won the first Goodwill Games marathon in 2:33:09, placed ninth.

Ivanova and Bogacheva broke from the other six elite runners after four miles and ran shoulder-to-shoulder for the next 14 miles on the scenic course along Lake Washington and the Seattle waterfront.

'I felt very comfortable with my pace and when Irina started to fall back I picked it up a little,' Ivanova said through an interpreter. 'I have trained very hard for this race and it has paid off.'

Ivanova, who teaches sports to children in her home of Alma Atta in the Republic of Kazahkstan, was a cross-country skier until the Soviet Union introduced marathon running 10 years ago.
