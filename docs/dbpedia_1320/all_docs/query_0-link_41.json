First, the self-calibration equations of a star sensor are derived based on the invariance of the interstar angle of a star pair between image frames, without any requirements for the true value of the interstar angle of the star pair. Then, a constant constraint of the optical path from the star spot to the center of the star sensor optical system is defined to reduce the biased estimation in self-calibration. Finally, a scaled nonlinear least square method is developed to solve the self-calibration equations, thus accelerating iteration convergence. Our simulation and analysis results show that the bias of the focal length estimation in on-orbit self-calibration with a constraint is two orders of magnitude smaller than that in on-orbit self-calibration without a constraint. In addition, it is shown that convergence can be achieved in 10 iterations when the scaled nonlinear least square method is used to solve the self-calibration equations. The calibrated intrinsic parameters obtained by the proposed method can be directly used in traditional star map identification methods.

Implementing a personalized machine learning model, utilizing data-driven features, presents an opportunity to facilitate tracking blood pressure fluctuations in various conditions. In this work, data-driven photoplethysmograph features extracted from the brachial and digital arteries of 28 healthy subjects were used to feed a random forest classifier in an attempt to develop a system capable of tracking blood pressure. We evaluated the behavior of this latter classifier according to the different sizes of the training set and degrees of personalization used. Aggregated accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were equal to 95.1%, 95.2%, 95%, and 95.4% when 30% of a target subject’s pulse waveforms were combined with five randomly selected source subjects available in the dataset. Experimental findings illustrated that incorporating a pre-training stage with data from different subjects made it viable to discern morphological distinctions in beat-to-beat pulse waveforms under conditions of cognitive or physical workload.

However, challenges such as speckle noise, acoustic shadows, and variability in nerve appearance complicate the accurate localization of nerve tissues. To address this issue, this study introduces a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN), specifically Scaled-YOLOv4, and investigates an appropriate network model and input image scaling for nerve detection on ultrasound images. Utilizing two datasets, a public dataset and an original dataset, we evaluated the effects of model scale and input image size on detection performance. Our findings reveal that smaller input images and larger model scales significantly improve detection accuracy. The optimal configuration of model size and input image size not only achieved high detection accuracy but also demonstrated real-time processing capabilities.

The preparation method was simple: polydopamine (PD) was coated on a flexible polyethylene terephthalate (PET) film and PANI graft chains were grown on its surface. This distinctive three-layer sensor showed a response value of 12 for 50 ppm NH3 in a dry atmosphere at 50 °C. This value surpasses those of previously reported sensors using structurally controlled PANI films. Additionally, it is on par with sensors that combine PANI with metal oxide semiconductors or carbon materials, the high sensitivity of which have been reported. To confirm our film’s potential as a flexible sensor, the effect of bending on the its characteristics was investigated. This revealed that although bending decreased the response value, it had no effect on the response time or recovery. This indicated that the sensor film itself was not broken by bending and had sufficient mechanical strength.

Due to the characteristics of mmWave, blockages make the localization task more complex. This paper proposes a cooperative localization system among user equipment (UEs) assisted by reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs), which considers device-to-device (D2D) communication. RISs are used as anchor points, and position estimation is achieved through signal exchanges between UEs. Firstly, we establish a localization model based on this system and derive the UEs’ positioning error bound (PEB) as a performance metric. Then, a UE-RIS joint beamforming design is proposed to optimize channel state information (CSI) with the objective of achieving the minimum PEB. Finally, simulation analysis demonstrates the advantages of the proposed scheme over RIS-assisted base station positioning, achieving centimeter-level accuracy with a 10 dBm lower transmission power.

The structure and magnetic properties are investigated in a wide range of temperatures and magnetic fields. The XRD analysis illustrates stable microstructure in the range of ρ from 0.25 to 0.60. The estimations of average grain size and crystalline phase content evidence a remarkable variation as the ρ-ratio sweeps from 0.25 to 0.60. Thus, the microwires with the lowest aspect ratio, i.e., ρ = 0.25, show the smallest average grain size and the highest crystalline phase content. This change in the microstructural properties correlates with dramatic changes in the magnetic properties. Hence, the sample with the lowest ρ-ratio exhibits an extremely high value of the coercivity, Hc, compared to the value for the sample with the largest ρ-ratio (2989 Oe and 10 Oe, respectively, i.e., almost 300 times higher). In addition, a similar trend is observed for the spontaneous exchange bias phenomena, with an exchange bias field, Hex, of 120 Oe for the sample with ρ = 0.25 compared to a Hex = 12.5 Oe for the sample with ρ = 0.60. However, the thermomagnetic curves (field-cooled—FC and field-heating—FH) show similar magnetic behavior for all the samples. Meanwhile, FC and FH curves measured at low magnetic fields show negative values for ρ = 0.25, whereas positive values are found for the other samples. The obtained results illustrate the substantial effect of the internal stresses on microstructure and magnetic properties, which leads to magnetic hardening of samples with low aspect ratio.

However, these approaches are limited in practical applications due to the complexity of neural networks, which require substantial computational resources, thereby hindering the advancement of automated diagnostic tools. To overcome these limitations, this study introduces a new fault diagnosis framework that incorporates a tri-channel preprocessing module for multidimensional feature extraction, coupled with an innovative diagnostic architecture known as the Lightweight Ghost Enhanced Feature Attention Network (GEFA-Net). This system is adept at identifying rolling bearing faults across diverse operational conditions. The FFE module utilizes advanced techniques such as Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), Frequency Weighted Energy Operator (FWEO), and Signal Envelope Analysis to refine signal processing in complex environments. Concurrently, GEFA-Net employs the Ghost Module and the Efficient Pyramid Squared Attention (EPSA) mechanism, which enhances feature representation and generates additional feature maps through linear operations, thereby reducing computational demands. This methodology not only significantly lowers the parameter count of the model, promoting a more streamlined architectural framework, but also improves diagnostic speed. Additionally, the model exhibits enhanced diagnostic accuracy in challenging conditions through the effective synthesis of local and global data contexts. Experimental validation using datasets from the University of Ottawa and our dataset confirms that the framework not only achieves superior diagnostic accuracy but also reduces computational complexity and accelerates detection processes. These findings highlight the robustness of the framework for bearing fault diagnosis under varying operational conditions, showcasing its broad applicational potential in industrial settings. The parameter count was decreased by 63.74% compared to MobileVit, and the recorded diagnostic accuracies were 98.53% and 99.98% for the respective datasets.

This event was the discovery of the piezoresistive effect, which led to the development of semiconductor strain gauges with a sensitivity much higher than that obtained before in conventional metallic strain gauges. In turn, this motivated the subsequent development of the earliest micromachined silicon devices and the corresponding MEMS devices. The science and technology related to sensors has experienced noteworthy advances in the last decades, but the piezoresistive effect is still the main physical phenomenon behind many mechanical sensors, both commercial and in research models. On this 70th anniversary, this tutorial aims to explain the operating principle, subtypes, input–output characteristics, and limitations of the three main types of mechanical sensor: strain gauges, capacitive sensors, and piezoelectric sensors. These three sensor technologies are also compared with each other, highlighting the main advantages and disadvantages of each one.

The magnetic permeability perturbation testing (MPPT) method performs well for thick-walled steel pipes, but the burial depth of the defect is difficult to access directly from a single time-domain signal, which is not conducive to the evaluation of defects. In this paper, the phenomenon of layering of magnetization that occurs in ferromagnetic materials under an unsaturated magnetizing field is described. Different magnetization depths are achieved by applying step magnetization. The relationship curves between the magnetization characteristic currents and the magnetization depths are established by finite element simulations. The spatial properties of each layering can be detected by different magnetization layering. The upper and back boundaries of the defect are then localized by a double-sided scan to finally arrive at the depth size of the defect. Defects with depth size of 2 mm are evaluated experimentally. The maximum relative error is 5%.

In this study, we explored the mechanisms influencing situational awareness by simulating an armored vehicle driving platform with 14 levels of experimentation in terms of five factors: experience, expectations, attention, the cueing channel, and automation. The experimental data included SART and SAGAT questionnaire scores, eye movement indicators, and electrocardiographic and electrodermal signals. Data processing and analysis revealed the following conclusions: (1) Experienced operators have higher levels of situational awareness. (2) Operators with certain expectations have lower levels of situational awareness. (3) Situational awareness levels are negatively correlated with information importance affiliations and the frequency of anomalous information in non-primary tasks. (4) Dual-channel cues lead to higher levels of situational awareness than single-channel cues. (5) Operators’ situational awareness is lower at high automation levels.

Ornithology has made alliances with other disciplines in order to establish a set of methods that play an important role in the birds’ protection and the evaluation of the environmental quality of different ecosystems. In this case, the use of machine learning and deep learning techniques has produced big progress in birdsong identification. To make an approach from AI-IoT, we have used different approaches based on image feature comparison (through CNNs trained with Imagenet weights, such as EfficientNet or MobileNet) using the feature spectrogram for the birdsong, but also the use of the deep CNN (DCNN) has shown good performance for birdsong classification for reduction of the model size. A 5G IoT-based system for raw audio gathering has been developed, and different CNNs have been tested for bird identification from audio recordings. This comparison shows that Imagenet-weighted CNN shows a relatively high performance for most species, achieving 75% accuracy. However, this network contains a large number of parameters, leading to a less energy efficient inference. We have designed two DCNNs to reduce the amount of parameters, to keep the accuracy at a certain level, and to allow their integration into a small board computer (SBC) or a microcontroller unit (MCU).

However, they have limitations for which markerless camera-based 3D motion capture systems (MCBS) could provide a solution. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to compare the accuracy, validity, and reliability of MCBS and MBS. (2) Methods: A total of 2047 papers were systematically searched according to PRISMA guidelines on 7 February 2024, in two different databases: Pubmed (1339) and WoS (708). The COSMIN-tool and EBRO guidelines were used to assess risk of bias and level of evidence. (3) Results: After full text screening, 22 papers were included. Spatiotemporal parameters showed overall good to excellent accuracy, validity, and reliability. For kinematic variables, hip and knee showed moderate to excellent agreement between the systems, while for the ankle joint, poor concurrent validity and reliability were measured. The accuracy and concurrent validity of walking speed were considered excellent in all cases, with only a small bias. The meta-analysis of the inter-rater reliability and concurrent validity of walking speed, step time, and step length resulted in a good-to-excellent intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) (0.81; 0.98). (4) Discussion and conclusions: MCBS are comparable in terms of accuracy, concurrent validity, and reliability to MBS in spatiotemporal parameters. Additionally, kinematic parameters for hip and knee in the sagittal plane are considered most valid and reliable but lack valid and accurate measurement outcomes in transverse and frontal planes. Customization and standardization of methodological procedures are necessary for future research to adequately compare protocols in clinical settings, with more attention to patient populations.

However, current fatigue crack inspection practice based on human vision is time-consuming, labor intensive, and prone to error. We present a novel human-centered bridge inspection methodology to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of fatigue crack detection by employing advanced technologies including computer vision and augmented reality (AR). In particular, a computer vision-based algorithm is developed to enable near-real-time fatigue crack detection by analyzing structural surface motion in a short video recorded by a moving camera of the AR headset. The approach monitors structural surfaces by tracking feature points and measuring variations in distances between feature point pairs to recognize the motion pattern associated with the crack opening and closing. Measuring distance changes between feature points, as opposed to their displacement changes before this improvement, eliminates the need of camera motion compensation and enables reliable and computationally efficient fatigue crack detection using the nonstationary AR headset. In addition, an AR environment is created and integrated with the computer vision algorithm. The crack detection results are transmitted to the AR headset worn by the bridge inspector, where they are converted into holograms and anchored on the bridge surface in the 3D real-world environment. The AR environment also provides virtual menus to support human-in-the-loop decision-making to determine optimal crack detection parameters. This human-centered approach with improved visualization and human–machine collaboration aids the inspector in making well-informed decisions in the field in a near-real-time fashion. The proposed crack detection method is comprehensively assessed using two laboratory test setups for both in-plane and out-of-plane fatigue cracks. Finally, using the integrated AR environment, a human-centered bridge inspection is conducted to demonstrate the efficacy and potential of the proposed methodology.

The Mach–Zehnder interferometer is formed by bending a single-mode fiber to a balloon-like structure and nested in the Teflon tube. Then, an ethanol solution was filled into the tube of the balloon-like fiber interferometer by the capillary effect. Due to the high sensitivity of the refractive index (RI) of ethanol solutions to temperature, when the external temperature varies, the optical path difference changes. The change in temperature can be detected by the shift in the interference spectrum. Limited by the size of the balloon-like structure, three kinds of these structures with different sensitive lengths were prepared to select the best parameters. The sensitive lengths were 10, 15 and 20 mm, respectively, and the RI detection performance of each structure in 10~26% NaCl solutions was investigated experimentally. The results show that when the sensitive length is 20 mm, the RI sensitivity of the sensor is the highest, which is 212.88 nm/RIU. Ultimately, the sensitive length filled with ethanol is 20 mm. The experimental results show that the temperature sensitivity of the structure is 1.145 nm/°C in the range of 28.1 °C~35 °C, which is 10.3 times higher than that of an unfilled balloon-like structure (0.111 nm/°C). The system has the advantages of low cost and easy fabrication, which can potentially be used in high-precision temperature monitoring processes.

However, there is a significant shortage of sign language interpreters in some languages, especially in Saudi Arabia. This shortage results in a large proportion of the hearing-impaired population being deprived of services, especially in public places. This paper aims to address this gap in accessibility by leveraging technology to develop systems capable of recognizing Arabic Sign Language (ArSL) using deep learning techniques. In this paper, we propose a hybrid model to capture the spatio-temporal aspects of sign language (i.e., letters and words). The hybrid model consists of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifier to extract spatial features from sign language data and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) classifier to extract spatial and temporal characteristics to handle sequential data (i.e., hand movements). To demonstrate the feasibility of our proposed hybrid model, we created a dataset of 20 different words, resulting in 4000 images for ArSL: 10 static gesture words and 500 videos for 10 dynamic gesture words. Our proposed hybrid model demonstrates promising performance, with the CNN and LSTM classifiers achieving accuracy rates of 94.40% and 82.70%, respectively. These results indicate that our approach can significantly enhance communication accessibility for the hearing-impaired community in Saudi Arabia. Thus, this paper represents a major step toward promoting inclusivity and improving the quality of life for the hearing impaired.

Farmers using traditional fish farming methods incur enormous economic costs owing to labor-intensive schedule monitoring and care, illnesses, and sudden fish deaths. Another ongoing issue is automated fish species recommendation based on water quality. On the one hand, the effective monitoring of abrupt changes in water quality may minimize the daily operating costs and boost fish productivity, while an accurate automatic fish recommender may aid the farmer in selecting profitable fish species for farming. In this paper, we present AquaBot, an IoT-based system that can automatically collect, monitor, and evaluate the water quality and recommend appropriate fish to farm depending on the values of various water quality indicators. A mobile robot has been designed to collect parameter values such as the pH, temperature, and turbidity from all around the pond. To facilitate monitoring, we have developed web and mobile interfaces. For the analysis and recommendation of suitable fish based on water quality, we have trained and tested several ML algorithms, such as the proposed custom ensemble model, random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), decision tree (DT), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), logistic regression (LR), bagging, boosting, and stacking, on a real-time pond water dataset. The dataset has been preprocessed with feature scaling and dataset balancing. We have evaluated the algorithms based on several performance metrics. In our experiment, our proposed ensemble model has delivered the best result, with 94% accuracy, 94% precision, 94% recall, a 94% F1-score, 93% MCC, and the best AUC score for multi-class classification. Finally, we have deployed the best-performing model in a web interface to provide cultivators with recommendations for suitable fish farming. Our proposed system is projected to not only boost production and save money but also reduce the time and intensity of the producer’s manual labor.

The diagnostics of Fabry disease during newborn screening are reasonable, due to the availability of enzyme replacement therapy. This paper presents an electrochemical method using complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS)-compatible ion-sensitive field effect transistors (ISFETs) with hafnium oxide-sensitive surfaces for the detection of α-galactosidase A activity in dried blood spot extracts. The capability of ISFETs to detect the reaction catalyzed by α-galactosidase A was demonstrated. The buffer composition was optimized to provide suitable conditions for both enzyme and ISFET performance. The use of ISFET structures as sensor elements allowed for the label-free detection of enzymatic reactions with melibiose, a natural substrate of α-galactosidase A, instead of a synthetic fluorogenic one. ISFET chips were packaged with printed circuit boards and microfluidic reaction chambers to enable long-term signal measurement using a custom device. The packaged sensors were demonstrated to discriminate between normal and inhibited GLA activity in dried blood spots extracts. The described method offers a promising solution for increasing the widespread distribution of newborn screening of Fabry disease.

This work aims to match peoples’ trajectories obtained from cameras to sensor data such as acceleration and angular velocity, obtained from wearable devices. Since human trajectory and sensor data differ in modality, the matching method is not straightforward. Furthermore, complete trajectory information is unavailable; it is difficult to determine which fragments belong to whom. To solve this problem, we newly proposed the SyncScore model to find the similarity between a unit period trajectory and the corresponding sensor data. We also propose a Likelihood Fusion algorithm that systematically updates the similarity data and integrates it over time while keeping other trajectories in mind. We confirmed that the proposed method can match human trajectories and sensor data with an accuracy, a sensitivity, and an F1 of 0.725. Our models achieved decent results on the UEA dataset.

In this study, 1–10 kDa PEG-DMA based hydrogels were characterized by gravimetric and electrochemical methods to investigate the diffusivity of small molecules and proteins. Swelling ratios (SRs) of 14.43–9.24, as well as mesh sizes ξ of 3.58–6.91 nm were calculated, and it was found that the SR correlates with the molar concentration of PEG-DMA in the ink (MCI) (SR = 0.1127 × MCI + 8.3256, R2 = 0.9692) and ξ correlates with the molecular weight (Mw) (ξ = 0.3382 × Mw + 3.638, R2 = 0.9451). To investigate the sensing properties, methylene blue (MB) and MB-conjugated proteins were measured on electrochemical sensors with and without hydrogel coating. It was found that on sensors with 10 kDa PEG-DMA hydrogel modification, the DPV peak currents were reduced to 92 % for MB, 73 % for MB-BSA, and 23 % for MB-IgG. To investigate the diffusion properties of MB(-conjugates) in hydrogels with 1–10 kDa PEG-DMA, diffusivity was calculated from the current equation. It was found that diffusivity increases with increasing ξ. Finally, the release of MB-BSA was detected after drying the MB-BSA-containing hydrogel, which is a promising result for the development of hydrogel-based reagent reservoirs for biosensing.

Traditional landslide investigation methods demand considerable human effort and expertise. To address this issue, this study introduces an innovative landslide segmentation framework, EMR-HRNet, aimed at enhancing accuracy. Initially, a novel data augmentation technique, CenterRep, is proposed, not only augmenting the training dataset but also enabling the model to more effectively capture the intricate features of landslides. Furthermore, this paper integrates a RefConv and Multi-Dconv Head Transposed Attention (RMA) feature pyramid structure into the HRNet model, augmenting the model’s capacity for semantic recognition and expression at various levels. Last, the incorporation of the Dilated Efficient Multi-Scale Attention (DEMA) block substantially widens the model’s receptive field, bolstering its capability to discern local features. Rigorous evaluations on the Bijie dataset and the Sichuan and surrounding area dataset demonstrate that EMR-HRNet outperforms other advanced semantic segmentation models, achieving mIoU scores of 81.70% and 71.68%, respectively. Additionally, ablation studies conducted across the comprehensive dataset further corroborate the enhancements’ efficacy. The results indicate that EMR-HRNet excels in processing satellite and UAV remote sensing imagery, showcasing its significant potential in multi-source optical remote sensing for landslide segmentation.

However, traditional electrical and optical strain sensors make access to structural health information challenging because data conversion is required, and they have intricate, delicate designs. Drawing inspiration from the moisture-responsive coloration of beetle wing sheaths, we propose using Ecoflex as a flexible substrate. This substrate is coated with a Fabry–Perot (F–P) optical structure, comprising a “reflective layer/stretchable interference cavity/reflective layer”, creating a dynamic color-changing visual strain sensor. Upon the application of external stress, the flexible interference chamber of the sensor stretches and contracts, prompting a blue-shift in the structural reflection curve and displaying varying colors that correlate with the applied strain. The innovative flexible sensor can be attached to complex-shaped components, enabling the visual detection of structural integrity. This biomimetic visual strain sensor holds significant promise for real-time structural health monitoring applications.

This paper focuses on developing a transformable quadruped wheelchair to address the mobility challenges posed by stairs and steps for wheelchair users. The wheelchair, inspired by the Unitree B2 quadruped robot, combines wheels for flat surfaces and robotic legs for navigating stairs and is equipped with advanced sensors and force detectors to interact with its surroundings effectively. This research utilized reinforcement learning, specifically curriculum learning, to teach the wheelchair stair-climbing skills, with progressively increasing complexity in a simulated environment crafted in the Unity game engine. The experiments demonstrated high success rates in both stair ascent and descent, showcasing the wheelchair’s potential in overcoming mobility barriers. However, the current model faces limitations in tackling various stair types, like spiral staircases, and requires further enhancements in safety and stability, particularly in the descending phase. The project illustrates a significant step towards enhancing mobility for wheelchair users, aiming to broaden their access to diverse environments. Continued improvements and testing are essential to ensure the wheelchair’s adaptability and safety across different terrains and situations, underlining the ongoing commitment to technological innovation in aiding individuals with mobility impairments.

The proposed instrument for solar irradiance measurement is based on an optical fiber as the light beam collector, a semiconductor photodiode to measure the optical power, and a calibration algorithm to convert the optical power into solar irradiance. The proposed radiometer offers the advantage of separating the measurement point, where the optical fiber collects the solar irradiation, from the place where the optical power is measured. A calibration factor is mandatory because the semiconductor photodiode is only spectrally responsive to a limited part of the spectral irradiance. Experimental tests have been conducted under different conditions to evaluate the performance of the proposed device.

The test of retropulsion, consisting of a rapid balance perturbation by a pull in the backward direction, is regarded as the gold standard for evaluating postural instability in PD and is a key component of the neurological examination and clinical rating in PD (e.g., MDS-UPDRS). However, significant variability in test execution and interpretation contributes to a low intra- and inter-rater test reliability. Here, we explore the potential for objective, vision-based assessment of the pull test (vPull) using 3D pose tracking applied to single-sensor RGB-Depth recordings of clinical assessments. The initial results in a cohort of healthy individuals (n = 15) demonstrate overall excellent agreement of vPull-derived metrics with the gold standard marker-based motion capture. Subsequently, in a cohort of PD patients and controls (n = 15 each), we assessed the inter-rater reliability of vPull and analyzed PD-related impairments in postural response (including pull-to-step latency, number of steps, retropulsion angle). These quantitative metrics effectively distinguish healthy performance from and within varying degrees of postural impairment in PD. vPull shows promise for straightforward clinical implementation with the potential to enhance the sensitivity and specificity of postural instability assessment and fall risk prediction in PD.

Communication can be decoupled in two dimensions: symbolic (information aimed to achieve a particular goal) and spontaneous (displaying the speaker’s emotional and motivational state) communication. Thus, to enhance human–robot interactions, the expressions that are used have to convey both dimensions. This paper presents a method for modelling a robot’s expressiveness as a combination of these two dimensions, where each of them can be generated independently. This is the first contribution of our work. The second contribution is the development of an expressiveness architecture that uses predefined multimodal expressions to convey the symbolic dimension and integrates a series of modulation strategies for conveying the robot’s mood and emotions. In order to validate the performance of the proposed architecture, the last contribution is a series of experiments that aim to study the effect that the addition of the spontaneous dimension of communication and its fusion with the symbolic dimension has on how people perceive a social robot. Our results show that the modulation strategies improve the users’ perception and can convey a recognizable affective state.

With a focus on considering the fluctuations in equipment energy consumption and the correlation between multiple pieces of equipment at the workshop production process level (CBMEatWPPL), the EFM of a DTW is obtained to characterize the dynamic evolution of whole energy consumption in the workshop. Taking a production unit as a case, on the one hand, an EFM of the production unit is constructed, which achieved the characterization and visualization of the fluctuations in equipment energy consumption and the dynamic evolution of whole energy consumption in the production unit; on the other hand, based on the EFM, an objective function of workshop energy consumption is established, which is combined with the tool life, robot motion stability, and production time to formulate a multi-objective optimization function. The bee colony algorithm is adopted to solve the multi-objective optimization function, achieving collaborative optimization of cross-equipment process parameters and effectively reducing energy consumption in the production unit. The effectiveness of the proposed method and constructed EFM is demonstrated from the above two aspects.
