The organizer and creator of the idea is Nermin Delić. The competition has been held since 2012, and this is the ninth season. The host country of the competition is Bosnia and Herzegovina, a country in Southeast Europe. According to the American Forbes, in an article from 2018, Mili Dueli is the most popular poetry competition in this part of Europe. So far, they have presented several thousand authors, and they operate in a total of 127 of the 196 countries of the United Nations.\n\nMili Dueli consist of 5 elimination rounds. Each round has different rules and organization, and therefore voting. The Organizer, Jury and Readers participate in the voting. The organizer and the Jury vote in separate polls, anonymously, and their votes and comments are later published publicly. Readers have the opportunity to vote through social networks.\n\nMili Dueli 2023 – First, Second and Third Round\n\nThere were 711 authors from 104 countries of the world in the First Round of the competition. The organizer had the task of reviewing all applications and selecting the TOP 450 authors to present to the Jury and Readers in the Second Round. Automatic passage to the Second Round was won by all authors who were the only ones registered from their country.\n\nIn the Second Round, the TOP 450 authors were presented by dividing the authors into national duels (in each duel there were authors from the same country). Here, too, the authors who were the only ones from their own country had an automatic pass, and received the status of national winner of their country. In the Second Round, the Organizer, the Jury and the Readers voted, and the authors faced for the first time the public literary criticism of the Jury and the Readers.\n\nIn the Third Round there were TOP 250 authors. The Organizer, Jury and Readers voted there, and the authors faced public literary criticism from the Jury and Readers for the second time. The round was also an elimination round.\n\nMili Dueli 2023 – Third round (Semifinals) – Organization and voting rules\n\nPART 1 – INTERCULTURAL DIALOGUE – Intercultural cooperation between the author and the members of the jury\n\nTOP 150 authors from a total of 96 countries of the world (37 European, 24 African, 21 Asian, 6 North American, 7 South American countries and Australia) passed to the Fourth Round. In the Fourth Round, the authors were supposed to send a new poem and an audiovisual performance in which they would present their work. On that occasion, they had the opportunity to collaborate with the Mentor, a member of the Jury assigned to them (from the Third Round), and for help in the form of poem selection and possible corrections to it. For those who are outside the speaking area of the former Yugoslavia (with the exception of Romania, Greece and Albania), our Jury member Anđela Turukalo Dabetić worked with the authors, who also translated all the poems into the Montenegrin language, which is related to other languages of the peoples of the former Yugoslavia and thus understandable to our Readers.\n\nNotes after completing the first part of the Fourth Round:\n\nAuthors from certain countries failed to meet the requirements of the Fourth Round, and those certain countries will not have their representatives in the Grand Final (Fifth Round) when the winner will be chosen. These are the following countries: Norway, Zambia, Chad, Angola, Libya, Uganda, Tunisia, Ivory Coast, Taiwan, Israel, South Korea, China, Uzbekistan and Honduras. The national winners of these countries did not manage to send their application for the end of the contest in the stipulated time,\n\nThe author Gloria Sofia, due to her belonging to the Cape Verde Islands, at the suggestion of the Organizer, decided to represent that country in the Grand Final as the National Winner (and the only author) of that country.\n\nThe author Safet Ćeman, due to his place of residence in Luxembourg, decided to represent that country in the Grand Final as the National Winner (and the only author) of that country.\n\nPART 2 – REVIEW AND EVALUATION OF THE TECHNICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE RECEIVED APPLICATIONS BY THE ORGANIZER\n\nWith the audiovisual performances they sent after working with Mentor, the authors will be presented on the social platform Facebook of our profile.\n\nVoting rules:\n\nOnly the Organizer votes in the Fourth Round.\n\nOrganizer. – The organizer has the task of reviewing whether each author has complied with the technical requirements for participation in the last round of Mili Dueli with exclusive reference to the audiovisual performance.\n\na) Domestic authors. The organizer awarded 50 or 100 points to domestic authors (authors whose speaking area is related to and understandable to the Bosnian language) for the audio-visual performances received. Those authors who sent a recitation, where only the “audio” segment prevails, authors who only read the poem, received 50 points. Authors who sent a performance, where in addition to the “audio” segment, there is also a “video” performance, received 100 points.\n\nb) Foreign authors. Foreign authors (authors whose speaking area is not related and understandable to the Bosnian language) received 25, 50, 75 and 100 points for the received audiovisual performances according to the following criteria:\n\n(25 points) – authors who sent a recitation without subtitles, without performance.\n\n(50 points) – authors who sent a recitation with a subtitle, without performance.\n\n(75 points) – authors who sent a performance without subtitles.\n\n(100 points) – authors who sent a performance with a subtitle.\n\nThe difference between recitation and performance is the “video” segment of the performance, which should be innovative, meaningful and impressive, with clear reflections of dedication.\n\nAuthors who failed to meet the requirements of the finals received 0 points.\n\nWho made it to the Fifth Round (Grand Final)?\n\nThe list of participants of the Fifth Round:\n\nImportant note: In some countries, due to the quality of the applications (authors), more than one author made it to the Grand Final. Thus, the most authors, as many as 7, from one country (Bulgaria) made it to the Grand Final, while we have countries where 5, 4, 3 or 2 authors made it further. The complete presentation of the ranking of authors who have made it to the Grand Final and those who have not will be known (published on our website) after the Grand Final is over, in order to avoid the possibility of favoring certain authors. Therefore, their arrangement is random.\n\nOnly the most successful from their countries and the authors who were the most dedicated of the group of authors from one country, made it to the final round, where we will have the opportunity to watch them.\n\nSince the contest is based on intercultural dialogue, all messages that are not in accordance with our mission, and represent a form of hate speech, automatically eliminate the author from the competitive part of the contest. Remember that in addition to quality poetry, we also choose authors who will contribute to positive vibrations in the world with their appearance!\n\nWhat will happen in the Fifth Round (Grand Final)?\n\nIn the last round, the authors will be presented to the Jury and Readers (on social networks) and through a spectacular vote, we will find out the name of the winner of the ninth season of Mili Dueli.\n\nMili Dueli Junior Poetry Contest: All authors under the age of 18 will participate in the competition, which will be held after the end of this one. The holder of the project for work with young authors is the Bosnian poet from Germany, Lela Zjajo.\n\nMILI DUELI I International Online Poetry Contest\n\nMastermind by Nermin Delić\n\nMade in Bosnia and Herzegovina\n\n© 2023"
