        "text": "LOS ANGELES -- Pedro Ortiz of Colombia, who finished second a year ago, decided Sunday's Los Angeles Marathon was his for the taking.\n\n'I controlled the race and looked for the moment to attack,' Ortiz said after he outdueled Poland's Antoni Niemczak in the final mile and won in 2:11:54. 'I prepared no matter what the pace was.'\n\nNiemczak was second in 2:12:05. Peter Fonseca of Canada was third in 2:12:07.\n\nOrtiz's 2:13:28 last year was 27 seconds behind two-time champion Art Boileau of Canada. Carlos Godoy, Ortiz's coach, said his marathoner was beaten in 1989 because he wasn't cognizant of Boileau.\n\n'We weren't going to let that happen again,' Godoy said. 'I told him to look around.'\n\nNiemczak realized that he was going to be passed.\n\n'Speed is very important and I didn't have it,' he said. 'My legs weren't tired but for the last 200 yards. Of course, I'm happy. I ran my last marathons 2:11, 2:12, 2:12 and 2:12. The next marathon, I'll win.'\n\nBoileau was fifth Sunday in 2:14:36.\n\nJulie Isphording, a two-time Columbus Marathon winner from Cincinnati, bested a weak women's field, finishing in a course-record 2:32:25. She had never run Los Angeles.\n\nSirje Eichelmann of the Soviet Union, who was seventh last year, led most of the way, but was fading in the 21st mile. She held on for second, 71 seconds behind Isphording. Canada's Lizanne Bussieres was third in 2:33:44.\n\n'Coming downhill, I never looked back,' Isphording said. 'I heard somebody say I had a 35-second lead after mile 24. I decided to race the clock and race for home.\n\n'The leaders were always in my sight. I had a lot of strength in the last six miles. It just so happens they were beginning to die. I was lucky.'\n\nEichelmann admitted that she was tired.\n\n'I was just trying to run my own race,' she said. 'When she passed me, I didn't think I could win. I wanted to run my own race and finish in the top 3.'\n\nZoya Ivanova of the Soviet Union had held the women's mark -- 2:34:42, established last year.\n\nThe men's race record remains 2:10:19, set by Martin Mondragon of Mexico in 1988.\n\nThe race was run in damp and humid conditions with temperatures in the mid-50s. A record 18,918 began the race, according to event organizers.\n\nMarathon officials reported the first death of a runner in the event's five-year history, when William McKinney, 59, suffered a heart attack and suddenly collapsed in the 21st mile. Officials said McKinney, of Altadena, Calif., was being treated for hypertension and was training under a doctor's care.\n\nThe marathon, which sought an identity as a race for the average runner, will shift its focus next year. Pending an evaluation, there will be a limit on the number of entrants, what race president Bill Burke calls a substantial increase in the budget for appearance fees for elite marathoners, negotiations for a more lucrative television contract and a course alteration designed to reduce the race time.\n\nThe race began and ended at the Coliseum. The course ran through diverse areas of Los Angeles, including Little Tokyo, Olvera Street, Chinatown, Hollywood and Mid-City."
