Were we previously within our organisations mainly concerned with bringing in diverse talent, now we are coming to the conclusion that our population is diverse. But we still have a long way to go in terms of Equity and Inclusion. And then once the topic of #DEI is on the strategic agenda, the next challenge presents itself. Developing a strategy is much more comprehensive than just recruiting diverse talent or organising Diversity Day or a Cultural Lunch. 💡 A strategy should contribute to the organisational objectives, with preferably measurable KPI`s and if you do it really well, the strategy on this topic should be part of every cultural topic within your organisation. 🤔 Where do you start creating a strategy, who do you need and with what is it all intertwined in your organisation? Curious about how Rabobank approached this? Then join this IT Circle Nederland session with Hord Wbi and register quickly via 👉 info@itcircle-nederland.nl. 🚀 📣 Anyone who has an interest and affinity with the subject of #Diversity, #Equity & #Inclusion from their organisation, from your role or from personal interest. 📆 Tuesday 14 May | 💻 Online | ⌚ 16.00 – 17.00 hrs. #itcirclenederland #DEI #strategy\n\nWe are really thrilled to share with you the launch 🚀 of our IV Global Mentoring Program with new contents, incredible workshops and surprises.🥳🎉 The event began with the intervention of Michelle Dib, CTO Transformation Manager in Santander Consumer Technology services who explained the content of this Kick-off and some details as part of the organization team. Michelle introduced some colleagues who participated last year to understand the impact of this great initiative. Denise Meneses (ella/she) and Ane Olazabal Azpeitia, who took part in the last edition, shared with us their experiences. They highlighted the value of the program that also gave them the opportunity to meet each other in Madrid. 🪭The same feeling was shared by Bożena Kunz-Wróbel & Lucia Saracco that told us how this program has allowed them to grow thanks to the enrichment relationship built between them.🪂🪁 We had the luck to count with Cristina Alvarez Alvarez , head of T&O Europe and sponsor of our mentoring program who emphasized the importance of networking and mentoring in our career. Cristina encouraged us not to let others choose our career for us. It´s vital to find time to take advantage of networking because it will bring us new opportunities. She also talked about the importance of diversity and the necessity to count with inclusive leaders, and the crucial role of technology.🤖🧮💻 “We need to understand technology, and this is the best time to work in IT, where we need people from different areas. Technology is going to be involved in any important decision in the future. And it is critical to be 50/50” she said.👧👦 Finally, Silvia Sebastián , senior programme manager at Santander España explained all the details of this edition. More than 380 men and women from 18 countries in Santander will be working together to foster their development for 6 months.💪🔋🔋 We are happy to have a new opportunity to connect people and to build relationships that will allow them to grow. It is Time to Learn, to Share and to Have Fun. We hope you enjoy as much as we do preparing this fantastic initiative.😊😉 Just a line to thanks all the people involved in the organization. Thanks for your personal time, effort and enthusiasm. ANA ESTHER, Paula, María Cristina, Cristina, Paula, Mercedes, Tosin, Cristina, Idoia, María Moreta, Silvia, Mayte, Esther, Elianni, @Ana García Rama y Ana B. Mateos. This is just the beginning … 😊😉🔋🪁 #Talent #diversity #networking #santanderwomennetwork\n\n🌟 Exciting News: My Journey as a Business Mentor with Santander! 🌟 Four years after founding the #BeMedigitalinclusion mentorship program to empower the global majority women and girls, I am thrilled to announce my new role as a business mentor in the Santander Executive Business mentorship program. I had the inspiring opportunity to connect with the lovely Maria just yesterday. The significance of relationships and strategic connections in business is immeasurable. Whether it's finding the right mentor, connecting with peers, or navigating career transitions, the networks we build are priceless. Through mentoring, I share my experiences and eagerly absorb my mentees' diverse perspectives and backgrounds. Serena Williams perfectly captured the essence of mentorship when she said, \"Every woman's success should inspire another. We're strongest when we cheer each other on.\" Every woman's success should inspire another, as stated by Serena. This sentiment emphasises the importance of supporting and encouraging one another, leading to a stronger and more united community. By celebrating the achievements of women, we foster an environment of growth, resilience, and unity. As I embark on this new role, I am reminded of the strength of unity and support. I eagerly anticipate the journey ahead with my mentee and many others, which promises to be filled with learning, growth, and mutual empowerment. Let's forge the path to success together! #BusinessMentor #SantanderMentorship #Networking #ProfessionalGrowth #Empowerment #SheDISRUPTS #SerenaWilliamsQuote\n\nIt's little things like this that make me appreciate the culture we have here at Comerica Bank. During our team meeting we repped our team for draft day and of course I had to show up for my Detroit Lions! A strong team culture can enhance creativity and problem-solving. In an environment where diverse perspectives are welcomed and respected, team members feel empowered to think outside the box and propose new ideas. This culture of innovation can give companies a competitive edge in their industry. Investing in building a strong team culture is an investment in the success and longevity of the organization. It creates a positive work environment where employees can thrive, collaborate effectively, and achieve their full potential. Just because something is \"virtual,\" doesn't make it less effective in building connections. Teams and LinkedIn are great platforms to build, grow and reaffirm connections built virtually. Take advantage of both when nurturing your network and teammates! #TeamBonding #BuildingConnections #VirtualWorkplace #IWorkForComerica #ComericaBank #RaisingExpectations #Comerica\n\nTommaso Locatelli, originally from Italy, is an Analyst at FTI Capital Advisors. After graduating from Imperial College Business School and collecting investment banking experience across Europe, he moved to Dubai to join #TeamFTI. What made you choose FTI Capital Advisors (FTICA)? Tommaso: As a global boutique middle-market investment bank, FTICA seemed like the perfect fit for my career growth. Interning across Europe, I realized that a collaborative atmosphere is ideal for learning from colleagues at all levels, and this is the most valuable treat that FTICA offered me. Plus, I was eager to ride the wave of growth in the Middle East—it's an exciting time to be here, and I liked the possibility of changing locations. The smaller team size also means I can be right in the thick of things, taking on more responsibility than I might in a larger bank, which I believe is a fantastic opportunity to deepen my expertise. What do you value the most about your experience in FTICA? Tommaso: Working at FTICA, the aspects I value highly include the warm and supportive team culture that encourages sharing ideas and growing intellectually. There’s also a strong entrepreneurial spirit where taking on responsibilities is part of the job. And while the work can be tough, it’s incredibly fulfilling to see how tasks that once seemed difficult become manageable, reflecting personal growth and the ability to take on even more challenging projects. It is immensely satisfying to witness the positive outcomes of hard work, particularly in successful projects and client relationships. What is your greatest accomplishment? Tommaso: During my MSc in finance at Imperial College Business School in London, I co-initiated “The GMA Challenge,” an international event challenging students worldwide to showcase their skills in M&A strategies. This initiative, in partnership with Judge Business School, Imperial and Bocconi, aims to foster gender equality, support underrepresented groups, and encourage students from diverse backgrounds to delve into the complexities of sustainability, behavioural economics and M&A. After over eight months of balancing studies and developing this competition, it was immensely gratifying to secure sponsorships from leading finance firms like Blackstone, CVC, Partners Group and Verdier & Co. as well as collaborations with top business schools. This venture significantly expanded my professional network, particularly with key industry leaders, which played a crucial role when I received an offer from FTICA. The extensive positive feedback and recommendations I received were not only affirming but also instrumental in shaping my decision to join FTICA, marking the beginning of an exceptionally rewarding and exciting career journey. #EmployeeSpotlight #FTICA"
