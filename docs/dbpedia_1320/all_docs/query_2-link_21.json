Due to the complex and dynamic situation in commodities markets, Bulgarian industrial enterprises need to apply more flexible and efficient approaches in order to adapt promptly to contemporary challenges. Industrial enterprises seek to demonstrate behaviour which will enable them to maintain and expand their market positions, respond adequately to changes in consumer demand and react to increasing competition. The aim of this article is to examine the market behaviour of Bulgarian industrial enterprises on the basis of theoretical and empirical research and to summarise some of the specific features of this market behaviour.",
