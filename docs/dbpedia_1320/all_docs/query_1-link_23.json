        "text": "Russian rhythmic gymnastics coach\n\nIrina Alexandrovna Viner (Russian: Ирина Александровна Винер; born July 30, 1948), formerly Irina Alexandrovna Viner-Usmanova (Russian: Ирина Александровна Винер-Усманова), is a Russian rhythmic gymnastics coach who is head coach of the Russian national team, president of the Russian Rhythmic Gymnastics Federation, and former vice president of the Rhythmic Gymnastics Technical Committee of the International Gymnastics Federation.\n\nIn 2015, Viner was awarded the Olympic Order in recognition of her outstanding achievements in global sports, making Viner the first gymnastics coach in history to receive the award. Thomas Bach, the president of the International Olympic Committee, personally handed her the necklace and presented the award.[1]\n\nViner is one of the most successful gymnastics coaches of all time, her pupils include five of the last six Olympic all-around champions: Margarita Mamun (2016), Evgeniya Kanaeva (2008, 2012), Alina Kabaeva (2004), and Yulia Barsukova (2000).[2]\n\nShe was married to business magnate Alisher Usmanov, formerly Russia's richest man.[3]\n\nEarly and personal life\n\n[edit]\n\nViner was born in Samarkand, Uzbek SSR, Soviet Union. Her father, Alexander, was a People's Painter of Uzbekistan. Her mother, Zoya, was a doctor. Viner is Jewish,[4] and in an interview she gave to Russian magazine Hello! at her home, she has said that she reads about Kabbalah, though she doesn't speak Hebrew.[5]\n\nViner was married to Uzbek–Russian tycoon Alisher Usmanov until 2022.[6] She and Usmanov originally met in their youth at a sports hall in Tashkent, where he was involved in fencing; they reconnected many years later in Moscow.[2] She has a son from her first marriage, Anton, who was born in 1973 and later adopted by Usmanov.[7] Anton is a real estate investor.[8]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nAs a young girl Viner wanted to take ballet but was discouraged, so she took up gymnastics at the age of 11.[2] Viner was a three-time champion of the Uzbek SSR and graduated from the Uzbek State Institute of Physical Culture. She worked as coach of the national team in rhythmic gymnastics in Tashkent, and under her tutelage, Venera Zaripova became her first successful gymnast. In 1990, Viner briefly moved to Great Britain to coach the British national team.[9]\n\nAfter Barcelona Irina moved to Moscow and began working for the Moscow City Sports Association (MCSA). Since 1992 Irina Viner-Usmanova was the head coach of the Olympic Training Center. She became the head coach of the Russian National Team in 2001 and the president of the Russian Rhythmic Gymnastics Federation in 2008.[10]\n\nIn 2015, Viner was awarded the Olympic Order in recognition of her outstanding achievements in global sports, making Viner the first gymnastics coach to receive the award. Thomas Bach, the president of the International Olympic Committee personally handed the necklace to her and presented the award.[1][11]\n\nOn 6 February 2016, Viner was elected to the Supreme Council of the United Russia party.[12]\n\nViner featured in the 2017 documentary Over the Limit, which covered her training of Margarita Mamun in the run-up to the 2016 Olympics. The film depicts her controversial training methods including sustained verbal abuse, with statements and insults directed at Mamun such as \"You're going to die bitch\" and \"Go f*** yourself with your shaking\".[13][14]\n\nIn an interview she gave to Russia's Hello! magazine at her home, she has said that her pupils venerate myrrh-pouring icons before every competition.[15] Since she has talked about reading Kabbalah in the same interview, some gymnastics sites translating the article into English assumed she was referring to Kabbalah icons,[16] but this is most likely a mistaken assumption, as myrrh-pouring icons have long been associated with Eastern Orthodox Christianity,[17] while Kabbalah is a form of Jewish mysticism, and Judaism forbids the use of icons altogether.\n\nAfter Israeli gymnast Linoy Ashram defeated Russia's Dina Averina at the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo in the all-around individual competition, Viner attacked Ashram, the judges, as well as the wider gymnastics community, accusing them of bias against Russia and saying that \"Dina is the real champion\".[18][19][20] In the following all-around group competition at the same Olympics, the Russian team lost to the Bulgarian team, and Viner in response once more insinuated an anti-Russian conspiracy in the judging, saying, \"everyone understood perfectly well that this was meant to happen, that Russia’s hegemony had to be stopped.\" Three months later, it was announced that Viner has signed the coach of the Israeli rhythmic gymnastics team at Tokyo, Ira Vigdorchik, to become the new coach of Russia's rhythmic gymnastic team.[21][22][23]\n\nControversies\n\n[edit]\n\nOn 9 May 2022, during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Viner was sanctioned by Latvia, included in the country's list of undesirable persons, and was prohibited from entering the country.[24][25] On 19 October 2022, she was sanctioned by Ukraine as a member of the Supreme Council of the United Russia party.[26][27]\n\nIn 2023, Viner proposed establishing an alternative Olympics Games and invite BRICS and Shanghai Cooperation Organisation countries to participate in it, following the news that Western nations oppose Russia's involvement in the 2024 Summer Olympics due to its invasion of Ukraine.[28]\n\nViner was sanctioned by the International Gymnastics Federation (FIG) on 6 March 2023 for her behavior and statements at the 2020 Summer Olympics. The disciplinary commission ruled that Viner would be prohibited from attending international competitions for the next two years.[29] On 22 November 2023, the GEF Appeal Tribunal Panel upheld Viner's two-year sanction, clarified its scope and timing, and declared the Artistic Gymnastics Federation of Russia liable for the actions of the Russian Rhythmic Gymnastics Federation and its members.[4]\n\nNotable pupils\n\n[edit]\n\nViner has trained many Russian Olympic/World/European/World Cup medal winners,[3] including:\n\nRussian gymnasts\n\n[edit]\n\nIndividual rhythmic gymnasts:\n\nEvgenia Kanaeva (born in 1990) (2 gold at the 2012 Olympics and 2008 Olympics, 17 gold in World, 13 gold in European, 4 gold in World games, multiple World Cup medals)[30]\n\nAlina Kabaeva (b. 1983) (1 gold in 2004 Olympics and a bronze in 2000 Olympics, 9 gold in World, 15 gold in European, 5 gold in World Cup)[31]\n\nMargarita Mamun (b. 1995) (1 gold in 2016 Olympics, 7 gold in World, 4 gold in European, 4 gold in World Cup Final)[32]\n\nYulia Barsukova (b. 1978) (1 gold in 2000 Olympics, 1 gold in World, 3 gold in European, 1 Gold in World Cup)[33]\n\nDina Averina (b. 1998) (1 silver in 2020 Olympics, 13 gold in Worlds, 10 gold in Europeans).\n\nYana Kudryavtseva (b. 1997) (1 silver in 2016 Olympics, 13 gold in World, 8 gold in European, 5 gold in World Cup Final, 4 Gold in European Games)[34]\n\nIrina Tchachina (b. 1982) (1 silver in 2004 Olympics, 3 gold in World, 6 gold in European, 4 gold in World games, 2 Gold in World Cup)[35]\n\nDaria Dmitrieva (b. 1993) (1 silver in 2012 Olympics, 4 gold in World, 1 gold in European, 1 gold in Universiade)[36]\n\nYanina Batyrshina (b. 1979) (1 silver in 1996 Olympics, 5 gold in World, 5 gold in European)[37]\n\nDaria Kondakova (b. 1991) (4 gold in World, 3 gold in European)[38]\n\nOlga Kapranova (b. 1987) (10 gold in World, 5 gold in European, 2 gold in World Games)[39]\n\nVera Sessina (b. 1986) (6 gold in World, 6 gold in European, 1 gold in World Games, 4 gold in World Cup)[40]\n\nArina Averina (b. 1998) (4 gold in Worlds, 9 gold in Europeans).\n\nAmina Zaripova (b. 1976) (5 gold in World, 5 gold in Europeans)[41]\n\nAleksandra Soldatova (b. 1998) (4 gold in World, 3 gold in Europeans)[42]\n\nNatalia Lipkovskaya (b. 1979) (3 gold in World, 1 gold in Europeans).\n\nLyasan Utiasheva (b. 1985) (2 gold in Europeans).\n\nZarina Gizikova (b. 1985) (2 gold in Europeans).\n\nAlexandra Merkulova (b. 1995) (1 gold in 2010 Youth Olympic Games).\n\nOlga Belova (b. 1983) (1 gold in World and European team).\n\nJulia Rosliakova (b. 1975) multiple World and European team medalist.\n\nVera Shatalina (b. 1966) -
