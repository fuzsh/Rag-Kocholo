        "text": "The IAAF World Athletics Championships Doha 2019 officially opened on Friday evening, 27 September. The Championships kicked off with unprecedented participation of at least 2,000 athletes who will compete in 49 races and competitions at Khalifa International Stadium and the Corniche Doha until 6 October.\n\nInteresting to know:\n\nOnly in Daegu 2011, female marathon runners from the same nation have managed to sweep all three medals at the same Championships when Kenyans Edna Kiplagat, Priscah Jeptoo and Sharon Cherop made it to the podium.\n\nKenya is the only nation with athletes who managed to win both men’s and women’s marathons at the same World Championships, when Luke Kibet and Catherine Ndereba topped their races in Osaka 2007.\n\nOnly Rosa Mota (POR) has won both World Championships (1987) and Olympics (1988) gold medals.\n\nNo one winner of All Africa Games, Pan American Games or Commonwealth Games have managed to win a World Championships medal.\n\nEthiopians female marathon runners won their first gold medal at the World Championships just four years ago, when Mare Dibaba clocked 2:27:35 in Beijing 2015.\n\nCan the second fastest in the season Lonah Chemtai Salpeter (ISR) grab her country’s first ever medal in this event?\n\nIf Edna Kiplagat (KEN) wins, she will be the first woman in this event with three golds and the only one with four medals at World Championships.\n\nIf Edna Kiplagat (KEN) wins, she will be the oldest world champion in this event (39 years 317 days this 28 September). Catherine Ndereba (KEN) is on top of the list at the time being. She was 35 years 43 days old, when she won in Osaka 2007.\n\nIf Rose Chelimo (BRN) wins in Doha, she will be the second after Edna Kiplagat with two World Championships golds in a row. She is also the only female marathon runner, who has won the World Championships and the Asian Games.\n\n2:27:03 by Zhou Chunxiu (CHN) is the fastest time in a women’s marathon in Doha since 9 December 2006.\n\n2:17:08 by Ruth Chepngetich (KEN) is the fastest time in a women’s marathon in Asia since she won in Dubai on 25 January 2019.\n\n2:18:11 by Gladys Cherono (KEN) is the fastest time in a women’s marathon in September (Berlin, 16 September 2018)\n\nWCH All-Times Top Performers:\n\n2:20:57 Paula Radcliffe (GBR) Helsinki 2005 Gold\n\n2:22:01 Catherine Ndereba (KEN) Helsinki 2005 Silver\n\n2:23:19 Constantina Tomescu-Dita (ROU) Helsinki 2005 Bronze\n\nSlowest Winning Time:\n\n2:30:37 Catherine Ndereba (KEN) Osaka 2007\n\nBiggest Margin of Victory:\n\n7 mins and 21 secs Rosa Mota (POR) versus Zoya Ivanova (URS) 1987\n\nSmallest margin of victory:\n\n1 sec Mare Dibaba (ETH) versus Helah Kiprop (KEN) 2015\n\nMultiple winners:\n\nCatherine Ndereba (KEN) 2003, 2007\n\nEdna Kiplagat (KEN) 2011, 2013\n\nMost medals by countries:\n\n11 Japan (2g-5s-4b)\n\n9 Kenya (4g-4s-1b)\n\n5 Romania (1g-1s-3b)\n\nRelated Link:\n\nhttps://www.marhaba.qa/event/iaaf-world-athletics-championships-doha-2019/"
