        "text": "Tottenham and Chelsea are competing for the new rising star of African football.\n\nNigerian striker Sani ­Emmanuel has had trials at Chelsea who were impressed by the 17 year-old.\n\nBut so were Tottenham, where the player voted the best player in tournament by FIFA in the world ­Under-17 championships in Nigeria earlier this ­season, was offered an ­extended stay.\n\nEmmanuel plays for the My People football club in Nigeria and had a brief spell with Swedish club Bodens BK.\n\nTottenham appear to have the edge in the race to sign Emmanuel and rather than ask for a transfer fee, the My People club want a long-term relationship with the club Emmanuel joins.\n\nIt will mean trials for promising players and ­donations of kit and ­equipment."
