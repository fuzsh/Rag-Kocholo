        "text": "In this report, JOHNNY EDWARD takes a look at some of the country’s brightest football prospects considered as the future of Nigerian football who went into oblivion sooner than expected\n\nIbrahim Rabiu (Slovan Bratislava)\n\nOnce hyped as the next Austin Okocha, Rabiu, a natural number 10, is arguably one of the most travelled Nigerian footballers, rather than being the most accomplished, as predicted by some keen followers of the game, close to two decades ago.\n\nAt just 16, Rabiu was a special player for Nigeria at the 2007 U-17 World Cup in South Korea, scoring in the first match against France as the Golden Eaglets triumphed for a third time.\n\nHis performance at the tournament saw him being listed in The Times Football’s Top 50 Rising Stars.\n\nStill 16, he was included in the Super Eagles squad for the 2008 Africa Cup of Nations along with his U-17 teammate Haruna Lukman, but a groin injury prevented him from participating in the tournament.\n\nIn 2009, Rabiu helped the Flying Eagles win bronze at the African U-20 AFCON in Rwanda, netting against Ivory Coast and South Africa, with the Nigerian side securing a place in that year’s U-20 World Cup in Egypt, where he appeared in three matches, scoring against Germany in the 3-2 round of 16 loss.\n\nIn 2010, his U-20 coach Samson Siasia singled out Rabiu as one of only two players who could solve the Eagles’ midfield problems.\n\nBut the diminutive midfielder had to wait for another five years before earning his first senior cap on June 13, 2015, playing for 32 minutes in a 2-0 win over Chad in Kaduna in the 2017 AFCON qualifiers.\n\nAt club level, Rabiu joined Portuguese side Sporting CP shortly after the U-17 World Cup but never featured for the first team and his journey started with a loan deal to Real Massama, where he made only one appearance before joining Dutch giants PSV Eindhoven in 2011. But he had his contract terminated because of limited first-team action.\n\nHis travails continued, playing in Scotland for two years with Celtic and Kilmarnock. He managed one appearance for the Glasgow giants and 16 for the East Ayrshire side respectively, before he was released.\n\nCurrently with Slovakian side Slovan Bratislava, the 28-year-old featured in the Europa League this season, but he has fallen in the pecking order amongst the country’s brightest talents.\n\nSunday Mba (Unattached)\n\nSunday Mba, remember him? He is the home-based lad who was Nigeria’s hero at the 2013 Africa Cup of Nations, grabbing the winner in the final against Burkina Faso.\n\nIt still baffles the country’s ardent football faithful how the mercurial midfielder, once at the centre of a highly celebrated ownership clash between local giants Enugu Rangers and Warri Wolves, faded into oblivion less than two years after his AFCON heroics.\n\nMba scored two goals in four games as Nigeria won the continent’s football showpiece event in South Africa seven years ago.\n\nHe played all three games at the 2013 Confederations Cup in Brazil, as the Super Eagles crashed out from the group stage.\n\nHe missed out on the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. At club level, Mba switched to French club CA Bastia in January 2014 after featuring for Enugu Rangers and Warri Wolves in the Nigeria Professional Football League.\n\nHe scored seven goals in 22 appearances in France, before he moved to Yeni Malatyaspor, where he was laid off by the Turkish side in 2017.\n\nMacauley Chrisantus (Hetten)\n\nChelsea, Tottenham, Liverpool and even Real Madrid were all reportedly interested in signing Chrisantus after his impressive showing, firing Nigeria to the top prize at the 2007 U-17 FIFA World Cup.\n\nThe lanky striker was only denied pocketing both the Golden Shoe and Golden Ball by Toni Kroos, the current Real Madrid midfielder.\n\nBut ever since joining Hamburg, it’s been a downward movement for the lanky striker.\n\n“I know very soon I will have the world calling my name again,” Chrisantus once said, in reply to his dwindling form.\n\nBut he has failed to match his words with on-field performances and has gone on a travelling adventure that has seen him feature for clubs in Germany, Belgium, Finland, Israel, Serbia, Scotland, India and Indonesia.\n\nHe is currently on the books of Hetten in Saudi Arabia.\n\nKingsley Udoh (Al-Najaf)\n\nFrom being touted as the ‘New Taribo’ at 16, to playing for an Iraqi team, Al-Najaf FC at 28, perhaps no prodigy has suffered a more spectacular fall from grace than Kingsley Udoh. Capped by Nigeria at the U-17, U-20 and U-23 levels, stardom beckoned when the defender was on the verge of a move to Atletico Madrid, but the deal fell through.\n\nHowever, Udoh failed to prove his worth and found himself in the Nigeria Professional Football League playing for Akwa United, Sunshine Stars and Kano Pillars before he faded into, only to team up with Al-Najaf in the Iraqi league.\n\nSani Emmanuel (Unattached)\n\nA lightning-quick striker with amazing skills and decent goalscoring record for Nigeria’s U-17 and U-20 teams, Sani Emmanuel never made it to the senior level despite the huge promise he showed early in his career.\n\nHe was regarded as one of the future stars of the country after his five goals fired the Golden Eaglets to runners-up spot at the U-17 World Cup on home soil 11 years ago.\n\nHe joined Italian club Lazio from My People FC in 2012 after strings of good performances at the U-20 World Cup the previous year.\n\nHe was shipped out on loan to Salernitana and FC Biel-Bienne after his professionalism was questioned due to his weight problem, before he was unceremoniously released.\n\nEmmanuel also had stints at Beitar Jerusalem and Oskarshamns AIK in the Swedish second division. At 26, he is currently without a club, having been released at the end of last season.\n\nHis career eventually hit the rocks after he copped a long-term Achilles injury that saw him quit the game unceremoniously.\n\nRelated News\n\nBright Dike (Unattached)\n\nTwo goals in his first three and only games for the Eagles earned the then Portland Timbers striker Bright Dike the nickname-New Sensation.\n\nBig, strong and a menace to opposing defenders, he was seen as the solution to coach Stephen Keshi’s striking problems after his debut for the Eagles in a 3-1 win over Venezuela in Miami on November 14, 2012.\n\nThe 25-year-old didn’t score in that game, but his physicality and combative style, as well as an eye for goal didn’t go unnoticed.\n\nBut injuries had a devastating effect on his fledging career.\n\nHis first international goal came against Catalonia in January 2013, but it wasn’t enough to earn him a place in the Eagles’ 2013 AFCON squad. Five weeks later, he suffered a torn knee ligament in a pre-season match against Seattle Sounders, ruling him out of action for six months.\n\nHe returned from the long-term injury to score his second goal in as many starts for the Eagles in their 2-2 friendly draw against Italy in November 2013. But he suffered another setback as he was ruled out of Nigeria’s 2014 World Cup squad after surgery on an Achilles tendon injury in February 2014.\n\nThereafter, the late Stephen Keshi and subsequent national team selectors never looked his way.\n\nAt club level, Dike struggled to revive his career, but only managed bit roles for Toronto FC, San Antonio Scorpions, Amkar Perm and Malaysian side, Pahang FA, who he last played for in 2017.\n\nEjike Uzoenyi (Zvijezda)\n\nHis record is amazing: two NPFL titles and Federation Cup winner with Enyimba, two PSL wins with South African giants Mamelodi Sundowns and Bidvest Wits, as well as the Nedbank Cup and the CAF Champions League with the former and a 2013 AFCON winners medal.\n\nAdd his personal honour, an MVP award at the 2014 African Nations Championship, where Nigeria emerged third, and you would agree Uzoenyi had the abilities to become one of the global stars of the game.\n\nBut truth is, the 33-year has struggled to impress since making his first move away from the domestic scene, despite his prodigious talent. And apart from his CHAN MVP award, he only managed a handful of games for the club titles he won abroad.\n\nAfter moving from Enugu Rangers to Rennes, the midfielder managed just one appearance in Ligue 1 before stints with PSL sides Sundowns, Bidvest Wits, and Ajax Cape Town.\n\nHe joined his latest club Zvijezda 09 in the Bosnian Premier League in January, aged 31.\n\nWith the Eagles, Uzoenyi managed one substitute outing, coming on for Brown Ideye in the 72nd minute as the Nigerians hammered Mali 4-1 in the semi-final, on their way to a third AFCON triumph in South Africa in 2013.\n\nHowever, Uzoenyi’s quality has never been in doubt by the Nigerian football faithful.\n\nAnd the choice of the mesmerising left-footed winger as CHAN 2014 MVP didn’t come as a surprise either, as he scooped three Man of the Match awards at the tournament and also scored three goals dismantling opposing defences with ease.\n\nThe petite winger’s trickery and his goals saw him shine against Mozambique and South Africa, where he was only denied a hat trick by the crossbar. Then he produced another virtuoso display with a master-class showing against Morocco.\n\nMusa Muhammed (HNK Gorica)\n\nHeld in high esteem after leading the Golden Eaglets to their fifth world title in UAE, Turkish side Istanbul Basaksehir snapped Muhammed up but the right-back failed to replicate his performance at the cadet World Cup. He managed just three league games in three seasons for the Turkish club before loan spells with Zeljeznicar in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Lokomotiv Plovdiv of Bulgaria. He moved permanently to HNK Gorica in 2018 but has failed to reignite the magic that once made him the darling of the home fans.\n\nMuhammed made his Eagles debut against Mali in 2016 at 19. Coach Gernot Rohr was full of praises for the defender after his team’s 1-0 victory over Tanzania in Uyo in a 2017 AFCON qualifier.\n\nBut the Franco-German has constantly omitted the left-back as his rating continues to decline.\n\nChidebere Nwakali (Kalmar)\n\nChidebere Nwakali failed to make the grade at Manchester City after an outstanding tournament at the 2013 U-17 World Cup in UAE.\n\nNwakali played every single minute of the Golden Eaglets games during the tournament and was colossal for Manu Garba’s side, who went on to lift the title for the fourth time.\n\nAt just aged 23, Nwakali has since parted ways with Girona, IK Start, Sogndal, Aberdeen FC and Rakow Czestochowa. He signed with Kalmar FF last year.\n\nNnamdi Oduamadi {Unattached)\n\nFormer AC Milan striker Oduamadi got heads rolling with a hat trick against Tahiti at the 2013 Confederations Cup in Brazil.\n\nThat was basically the height he attained as he afterwards failed to seal a place in the national team.\n\nHe joined Milan from Genoa, first on loan in the 2010/11 season, playing just one game.\n\nThe San Siro giants then acquired his full services the next season, but Oduamadi, now 29, failed to play a single game in seven years at the club.\n\nLoan spells within and outside Italy for first team football didn’t help his cause at Milan, forcing him to quit in 2018.\n\nHe last played club football for Tirana in the Albanian topflight in 2019.\n\nCopyright PUNCH.\n\nAll rights reserved.
