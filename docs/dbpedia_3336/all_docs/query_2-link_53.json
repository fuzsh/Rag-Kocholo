        "text": "Allan JiangTransfers Correspondent\n\n25 Most Disappointing Young Guns Failing to Live Up to the Hype\n\n0 of 25\n\nNam Y. Huh/Associated Press\n\nNot every young gun develops into a world-class player like Paul Pogba, so here are the 25 most disappointing prospects in world football, who are failing to live up to the hype.\n\nCriteria\n\nProspect must be 21 years or younger.\n\nThe list will be subjectively ranked via a combination of how hyped a prospect is and the degree the prospect has struggled to live up to expectations.\n\nLong-List Cuts\n\nAndy Polo\n\nBetinho\n\nDavid Moberg Karlsson\n\nGiorgi Chanturia\n\nJohn Lundstram\n\n25. Ravel Morrison\n\n1 of 25\n\nStu Forster/Getty Images\n\nWest Ham United's English central attacking midfielder Ravel Morrison, 21, was the best 14-year-old Sir Alex Ferguson saw at Manchester United, according to former United stalwart Rio Ferdinand.\n\n\"My old boss [Ferguson] said 'Have a look at this boy [Morrison].' He was taking the mick out of everyone on the pitch when he was 14,\" Ferdinand said, per BT Sport (h/t ESPN). \"The manager thought he was the best player he had seen at that age.\"\n\nEven after training with the United first team at 16 years of age, Morrison could not see the light at the end of the tunnel.\n\n\"Off-field indiscretions may have convinced Ferguson that Morrison needed to leave Manchester United,\" per Alec Shilton at The Times.\n\nWhile Morrison has flashed world-class ability, like an amazing solo goal against Tottenham Hotspur, he still continues to frustrate.\n\nLoaned out to Cardiff City, if he does not impress, he would have failed to convince West Ham he is worth the trouble.\n\nThis means he could be in for a nomadic career.\n\n24. Bryan Rabello\n\n2 of 25\n\nEuroFootball/Getty Images\n\nSevilla's Chilean central attacking midfielder Bryan Rabello, 20, is a fantastic talent, but he has been a flop in Spain.\n\nGranted, his cameo appearances for Sevilla came at irregular intervals, he still failed to score or create a goal in 527 minutes of combined La Liga and UEFA Europa League playing time.\n\nBeing loaned out to Luzern in the Swiss Super League, ranked the 11th-best league in Europe, tells you the bar has been lowered for Rabello.\n\nThough, the talent is there because he was identified by FIFA as a key player at the 2013 U20 World Cup, per FIFA's official website: \"Attacking midfielder with excellent technique, good vision and the ability to change the pace of the game.\"\n\n23. Ante Rebic\n\n3 of 25\n\nClive Brunskill/Getty Images\n\nFiorentina's Croatian centre-forward Ante Rebic, 21, faces an uncertain future despite possessing elite upside.\n\nKhouma Babacar is putting forward a case to be Fiorentina's future No. 9 while Rebic's development is stagnating.\n\nLoaned out to RB Leipzig, Rebic has been on the outside looking in.\n\n22. Massadio Haidara\n\n4 of 25\n\nHagen Hopkins/Getty Images\n\nNewcastle United's French left-back Massadio Haidara, 21, is a tough tackler who impressed at Nancy. But he has largely been a bystander in the Premier League.\n\nEntering his third season at Newcastle, he has played a combined 823 minutes in league play, 635 minutes less than his final season at Nancy (1,458).\n\nIf he cannot beat out Paul Dummett for a regular starting position, then Haidara should consider returning to Ligue 1 where he can rebuild his career.\n\n21. Adryan\n\n5 of 25\n\nEnrico Locci/Getty Images\n\nFlamengo's Brazilian centre-forward Adryan, 20, had the world at his feet when he toyed with opposing defenders at the 2011 FIFA U17 World Cup.\n\nScoring five times and creating two goals, he was recognised as an outstanding player for Brazil, per FIFA's official website: \"Dangerous attacker with good dribbling skills and excellent technique.\"\n\nHowever, Adryan has yet to make the transition to senior football after a nondescript loan spell at Cagliari.\n\nHe is currently 639 minutes and counting without a goal in league play.\n\nLoaned out to Leeds United, his match fitness levels are still low, according to Leeds manager Darko Milanic.\n\n\"I think he's [Adryan is] not prepared to play 40 games in the Championship now, not at this moment. He needs time,\" Milanic said, per Phil Hay at the Yorkshire Evening Post. \"I don't want to put too much pressure on him.\"\n\n20. Branimir Hrgota\n\n6 of 25\n\nKerstin Joensson/Associated Press\n\nBorussia Monchengladbach's Swedish centre-forward Branimir Hrgota, 21, scored a hat-trick in a 4-2 win over Mainz last May, but he has been idle most of the time he has played in the Bundesliga.\n\nTwo league goals in 871 minutes since last season proves he has failed to live up to his wunderkind tag.\n\nBeing the backup to a world-class strike force of Max Kruse and Raffael has also contributed to Hrgota's predicament.\n\n19. M'Baye Niang\n\n7 of 25\n\nMarco Luzzani/Getty Images\n\nAC Milan's French centre/right-forward M'Baye Niang, 19, is a lethal attacker, but he could be an early bloomer.\n\nHe is on a 30-game run without a goal in Serie A. When he was loaned out to Montpellier last season, he was unconvincing, scoring four goals in 1,307 minutes of Ligue 1 play.\n\nHe has yet to start a league game for Milan this season.\n\n18. Ryo Miyaichi\n\n8 of 25\n\nDean Mouhtaropoulos/Getty Images\n\nArsenal's Japanese left-winger Ryo Miyaichi, 21, has never been offered an extended starting run at the Gunners since being signed in 2011.\n\nHe has only played 17 minutes in the Premier League under Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger.\n\nLoaned out to Twente, he is still finding his feet, which is a concern because he has played in the Eredivisie before (Feyenoord; 2010-11 season).\n\n17. Connor Wickham\n\n9 of 25\n\nStu Forster/Getty Images\n\nSunderland's English centre-forward/left-winger Connor Wickham, 21, is still the same player that was named UEFA's Golden Player of 2010.\n\nWickham has a career in the Championship, but whether or not he can be an elite Premier League No. 9 remains to be seen.\n\nThis is why he has received playing time on the left wing, but his shoot-first mentality means he is not a viable creative outlet.\n\n16. Sani Emmanuel\n\n10 of 25\n\nSUNDAY ALAMBA/Associated Press\n\nFree-agent Nigerian centre-forward Sani Emmanuel, 21, was the top of his age group when he received the 2009 FIFA U17 World Cup Golden Ball.\n\nNow he is looking for employment and according to Transfermarkt, no club has signed him to a permanent contract yet.\n\nIn hindsight, he should have signed for an Eredivisie or Belgian Pro League club which would have given him more of a chance to break into the first XI, rather than being on the books of Serie A club Lazio.\n\n15. Josh McEachran\n\n11 of 25\n\nIan Walton/Getty Images\n\nChelsea's English central midfielder Josh McEachran, 21, has been one to watch since he made his debut for the England U16s as a 14-year-old.\n\nYes, he is skilful, a magnificent passer and an intuitive footballer.\n\nBut he is not assertive enough, hence why he has been on the periphery throughout his entire professional career.\n\nRemember, he has not even entered Samuele Dalla Bona [1] territory, so perhaps McEachran is not all that.\n\nLoaned out to Vitesse, McEachran was demoted to Jong Vitesse (reserve team).\n\n[1] Dalla Bona was a rising star at Chelsea, but was lured back to native Italy. He pinpoints his decision as a factor why his career slumped, per La Gazzetta dello Sport (h/t Ben Gladwell at ESPN FC).\n\n14. Vitinho\n\n12 of 25\n\nEpsilon/Getty Images\n\nCSKA Moscow left attacking midfielder Vitinho, 21, was lambasted by Botafogo fans when he elected to sign with the Russian Premier League club.\n\nAccording to his wife, \"it was an opportunity that he couldn't pass up,\" per the Associated Press (h/t ESPN FC).\n\nIt is a financially lucrative deal for Vitinho, but does he enjoy being a bench warmer/impact sub?\n\nNo, since he averages 25.4 minutes a game when he plays this season.\n\n13. Nicolas Lopez\n\n13 of 25\n\nDino Panato/Getty Images\n\nUdinese's Uruguayan deep-lying forward/right-forward Nicolas Lopez, 21, was a misfit at Roma even though he was one of the highly touted youth prospects in recent memory.\n\nHe was a bit-part player at Udinese playing more games as a substitute (14) than as a starter (seven) last season.\n\nLoaned out to Hellas Verona, Lopez flashed a moment of brilliance with a goal against AC Milan.\n\nThat type of play is expected from him on a more regular basis, which he has yet to deliver (four goals in his last three Serie A seasons).\n\n12. Viktor Fischer\n\n14 of 25\n\nDean Mouhtaropoulos/Getty Images\n\nAjax's Danish left-forward Viktor Fischer, 20, had struggled with form prior to tearing his hamstring.\n\nAfter a breakout 2012-13 Eredivisie season, he only scored three league goals from 63 shots the following season.\n\nFischer faces an uphill task of transitioning into an elite footballer as questions are raised regarding his durability and his consistency.\n\n11. Mitchell Weiser\n\n15 of 25\n\nVictor Fraile/Getty Images\n\nBayern Munich's German right-back/right-winger Mitchell Weiser, 20, was described as \"quick off the mark\" by FIFA's technical study group during the 2011 FIFA U17 World Cup.\n\nIf anything, Weiser's progress at Bayern has been slow.\n\nSure, being on Bayern's squad list is an achievement, but his development would have been quicker if he stayed at Koln, where he would have been entering his third season as a week in, week out starter.\n\nLoaned out to Kaiserslautern, Weiser's long-term future at Bayern is up in the air.\n\n10. Nick Powell\n\n16 of 25\n\nAlex Livesey/Getty Images\n\nManchester United's English central midfielder/deep-lying forward Nick Powell, 20, is Paul Scholes' successor, according to former United manager Sir Alex Ferguson.\n\n\"Powell is going to be a really good player who, we hope, will fill Paul Scholes' boots,\" Ferguson said, per MUTV (h/t Jamie Jackson at The Guardian).\"He's [Powell has] got terrific vision, good temperament, two great feet, is quick and is a great striker of the ball.\"\n\nPowell's 12 goals on loan at Wigan Athletic last season reinforce his credentials up front, but Ferguson's testament gives you an insight into the all-round playing style of the 20-year-old.\n\nOn loan at Leicester City this season, Powell might be spending the season watching the first team.\n\nHe has no chance of getting a game up front unless Leonardo Ulloa and David Nugent suffer long-term injuries.\n\nIn midfield, if Andy King—a gifted Welsh ball-playing midfielder—is left on the bench, then Powell's chances will come sparingly.\n\n9. Jose Campana\n\n17 of 25\n\nGero Breloer/Associated Press\n\nSampdoria's Spanish central midfielder Jose Campana, 21, is one of the purest passers in the game.\n\nHe can complete every pass in the book and can alternate from keeping the ball Tiki-taka style to making more incisive passes.\n\nYet, Campana's career is bizarre: Role player at Sevilla, failed to make it at Crystal Palace, loaned out to Nurnberg, signed by Sampdoria, and then loaned out to Porto.\n\nHe needs stability in his career if he is to ever maximise his elite talent.\n\n8. Tomas Kalas\n\n18 of 25\n\nClive Brunskill/Getty Images\n\nChelsea's Czech Republic centre-back/right-back Tomas Kalas, 21, cost €6.6/£5.2 million as a 17-year-old.\n\nExpected to be a regular on loan at Koln, Kalas has spent the season starting and finishing games on the bench.\n\nIf Chelsea included an option to recall Kalas, the Blues should activate the clause, and then loan him out to a Championship club.\n\n7. Bruma\n\n19 of 25\n\nEuroFootball/Getty Images\n\nGalatasaray's Portuguese left attacking midfielder Bruma, 19, was a star at youth level. Though, his move to Turkey raised eyebrows.\n\nIt has not been smooth sailing at Galatasaray and he would have been better served establishing himself as a starter at Sporting Lisbon.\n\nThe Turkish club have even considered cutting their losses as they grow frustrated with Bruma, per Bugun (h/t Alex Harris at the Daily Express).\n\n6. Souleymane Coulibaly\n\n20 of 25\n\n5. Matija Nastasic\n\n21 of 25\n\n4. Jan Oblak\n\n22 of 25\n\nClive Rose/Getty Images\n\nAtletico Madrid's Slovenian goalkeeper Jan Oblak, 21, has time on his side.\n\nHowever, his early start at Atleti has been rough having lost out to Miguel Angel Moya for the No. 1 role.\n\nIt is an ominous sign because Atleti welcomed Thibaut Courtois into the starting XI, while Oblak—the most expensive goalkeeper in La Liga history—has to wait.\n\n3. Lazar Markovic\n\n23 of 25\n\nJon Super/Associated Press\n\nLiverpool's Serbian right attacking midfielder Lazar Markovic, 20, does not look like a €25.2/£20 million-valued player, even though he impressed so much at Benfica.\n\nMarkovic has had seven unsuccessful touches and been dispossessed of the ball seven times in his first four Premier League games.\n\nHe has been a liability on the field which is a red flag.\n\nTo those saying he needs time, then why spend £20 million on him when he is soft, his touch has been off and he is making no impact for Liverpool?\n\nHe must up his game.\n\n2. Paulo Dybala\n\n24 of 25\n\nTullio M. Puglia/Getty Images\n\nPalermo's Argentine centre-forward Paulo Dybala, 20, has yet to vindicate the \"new Sergio Aguero\" tag.\n\nFailing to score 15 league goals or more in a season for Palermo, Dybala is a serviceable No. 9, but is he an elite prospect? No.\n\nThat said, maybe he is a late-bloomer i.e. Diego Costa.\n\n1. Adrien Rabiot\n\n25 of 25\n\nChristopher Lee/Getty Images\n\nParis Saint-Germain's French central midfielder Adrien Rabiot, 19, is overrating his ability.\n\nThis is not a Paul Pogba situation as he never received an extended starting run at Manchester United, whereas Rabiot has played 30 Ligue 1 games for PSG.\n\nSure, Rabiot has world-class potential because he has a complete playing style.\n\nThough, his attitude is so off-putting, especially when he has not proven anything.\n\nIt is OK if you are emotionally fragile and high-maintenance if you are a superstar. But, Rabiot has been distinctively average when he has played for PSG.\n\nIt would be a shame if he ended up being another Stephane Dalmat.\n\n@allanjianga\n\n+allanjiang\n\nStatistics via WhoScored\n\nX"
