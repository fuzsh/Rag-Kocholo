Both are barely 14 years old.\n\nOnly two of the stars from Africa tomlegg initially mentioned will be showing up in Nigeria...\n\nI must say the surprise for me of this tournament is Adiyiah. I saw him earlier in the African championships U-20 and I found him not so much. Hard working, but further he was invisible during that tournament. I could not believe my eyes when I saw him play here. He was really the most dangerous men of Ghana along with Osei. Ghana leaned on that two guys.\n\nNice to know. Adiyiah has had his football education at the school of Feyenoord Rotterdam in Ghana. At eighteen he left FFFF for Hearts of Oak. There he scored on a production line, then Fredrikstad took him over. In his first season he didn't play much, but now he is a key-player, if i'm not wrong. I think that Feyenoord didn't count on such a spectacular development of Adiyiah, otherwise he wasn't so easily sold. With Ghanians you have to be patient to let them develop in a decent player. See Nana Asare who's currently playing for FC Utrecht and doing it good, also a former Feyenoord Fetteh player.\n\nAbout the U17 squad lists. I can not believe that Gambia is taking seven U-16 players and one U-15. It is an under 18 tournament. There is a player of 14 - if that's true - he cant never compete physically with boys born in '92. He must be very good, otherwhise I have my doubts about his age.\n\nThe same applies to the many under 16 players they have selected.\n\nNigeria looks for the first time with a selection with not overaged players. They're all not so tall as in the past, where the players of Nigeria were physically strong and huge.\n\nWell... they did it! YYYEESSS!\n\nFriday night was a bloody brilliant night, a friend hosted a U20 World Cup Final party and hooked up his laptop to a projector, then streamed the shoddiest feed I have ever witnessed... the stream could only be viewed through beer goggles! How did you guys watch the final?\n\nWhat a brilliant defensive display from the best attacking side in the tournament. I found it fascinating to see the highest scorers in the tournament - who have been prone to the odd defensive mistakes - defend so calmly and resolutely. To do this whilst being down to ten men (after that appalling decision from the referee) was simply brilliant, and Sellas Teteh must be applauded for organising the defensive strategy so well.\n\nMaruti; couldn't agree with you more. I would probably add Jonathan Mensah to that list as well. One thing that I do worry about with the Ghanaian senior team is their attacking options (a goal-scorer), my hope is that they give both Osei and Adiyah, in particular, a chance against Mali on November the 14th and Angola on the 18th.\n\nMoha; Again, completely agree, Adiyiah has been, by far, the biggest surprise of the tournament. He really was such a frustrating player to watch during the African U20 championships, he could turn a covering defender brilliantly but seemingly lacked the quality in the box. Much like the whole Black Satellites team, he developed and improved game-after-game in this tournament... it has been incredible to watch. I sincerely hope this tournament isn't a flash in the pan moment in Adiyiah's career. I'm not too sure if a move in January is the best thing for him, he needs to be playing regularly especially if he has hopes of getting into Ghana's World Cup squad. What do you guys thing, move this January or wait until the summer?\n\nSome of you may have seen that I've started a thread on artificial pitches in Africa (https://www.bigsoccer.com/forum/showthread.php?t=1202849). After seeing them used in this years U20 World Cup (and soon the U17 World Cup) It be cool to hear what you think about the use of them in professional, youth development and amateur football on the continent. I've also posted an article on the issue on my blog: http://tomlegg.wordpress.com/\n\nLet the Under 17 championships commence...\n\nHi everyone, its been a while.\n\nBefore I put my two pence in on how the Under 17 World Cup is going I thought I'd let those of you who haven't heard know that Ghana's Under 20 hero Dominic Adiyiah is set for a January move to AC Milan after vice-president Adriano Galliani confirmed they had agreed a deal with Fredrikstad FK. On the face of it this move doesn't look like too bad an option; Milan are a side in transition and you would therefore hope this would provide Dominic with some opportunities. AC have historically give first team chances to young players that they feel fit into their system of play and as we all saw in the recent Under 20 World Cup, Dominic is a very accomplished forward who is capable of coming deep and running with the ball and also pushing the defensive live as a target man. Milan have tended to deploy a 4-3-3 under Leonardo, with Pato in the centre of that top three and either the even green Inzaghi, Ronaldinho (when he's not suffering from a hangover), Huntelaar (who's failed to score in almost 10 games this season and may move in January) or Borriello supporting.\n\nThe worry for me surrounds the coaching set up. Despite their recent upturn in form doubts remain as to whether Leonardo is the best long term option as manager. If he goes, where would that leave Dominic when another manager - with other ideas, different style of play and new players - comes in. I guess we'll have to wait and see.\n\nAnyway, onto the U17's. For those of you who haven't been following then the Round of 16 kicks off tomorrow with only two of the five African nations making it past the group stages. Hosts Nigeria and Burkina Faso qualified with Gambia, Malawi and Algeria all biting the dust. The poor performances of the latter two were expected, but with Gambia being reining CAF Under 17 Champions I expect far more from them. I don't want to be too critical as this is Under 17 level, a big plus was the performances of Ebrima Bojang who, despite having a distinct lack of service from midfield, scored two in three games and there looks to be talent their.\n\nAs for the two African sides left in the competition, Nigeria surprised many (including me) by topping Group A ahead of Argentina and Germany and will therefore face an 'easy-ish' game against New Zealand in the Round of 16. The Nigerian's won two and drew one game in the group stage, one of the games was a stunning comeback from 0-3 down to Germany at half time they managed to salvage a 3-3 draw. A positive sign is that the side are scoring goals from all over the pitch, the team ethic seems to have been drilled into them by the coach and they are all playing for each other. Stand outs so far; left back Kenneth Omeruo, captain and central defender Fortune Chukwudi, forward Stanley Okoro and Terry Envoh.\n\nBurkina Faso finished second in Group D, recovering well from a disappointing opening performance against Turkey to draw - despite dominating - against New Zealand side in their second game and then thrash Costa Rica 4-1. They will now face unbeaten Spain on Thursday who with potent attacking options in Borja and Carmona will be a tough test. Burkina have impressed enough to give us a glimmer of hope; their defence looks relatively strong, the midfield is patient on the ball and the strikers look lively. I've been impressed with Fadil Sido and Zidane in the midfield, Soro has organised and brought out the back line well whilst Louckmane Ouedraogo has impressed as an attacking option from the bench.\n\nFor those of you who managed to watch Nigeria v New Zealand last night... what a performance the hosts put on for everyone! The game ended 5-0 to the home side and it could - in fact should - have been double that.\n\nThe undoubted star of the show was Nigeria's support striker Stanley Okoro who conducted the Nigerians attacking threat throughout the game. The hosts play South Korea in the quarter finals, the Asian sides coaching staff have some work to do in constructing a tactical platform to stop Okoro.\n\nThe Nigerian result raised spirits after Burkina Faso were thrashed 4-1 earlier on in the day by an impressive Spanish side."
