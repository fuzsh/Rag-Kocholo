        "text": "The Lagos-based football club, My People FC played a novelty football match on Tuesday at the Agege Stadium in honor of their late chairman pastor Temitope Balogun Joshua.\n\nThe game against St Thomas FC, filled with emotions from both sides ended in a 2-2 draw.\n\nMy People FC who currently competes in the Nigerian National League, the second tier of the country’s football league system was founded by the late pastor T.B Joshua in 2008.\n\nAfter the match, a club official of My People Brown Chidozie told Sports247 in a heartfelt interview:\n\n“We played this game today in honor of T.B Joshua, to give him that respect of a father, of a brother and founder of My People FC. It is also to let others know that he made everything possible for My People FC.\n\n“We thank God for making it possible for us to be here. I am sure he is in a better place right now seeing us from wherever he is and knowing that his players have done him well and done him proud. So may his soul rest in perfect peace wherever he is.”\n\nMy People FC was established with the sole aim of helping talented young football players achieve their dreams. A lot of players nurtured by the club have gone on to make a name for themselves in the game including 2013 Africa Cup of Nations winner Ogenyi Onazi.\n\n“We have lots of players that have played under My People FC,” Chidozie continued. “Talking about the likes of Ogenyi Onazi, Shehu Emmanuel Sani, Leornard Okeke, and Edwin Okpave.\n\n“Onazi currently has club duties. He is supposed to be here if he was in Nigeria. He sent his greetings with a lot of support.”\n\nChidozie concluded, speaking highly of T.B Joshua who was also the founder of the Synagogue, Church of All Nations (SCOAN): “One thing I’ll remember him for is is that he is a giver and he thinks more about others and less of himself. We will always be grateful to him for what he did for this club and his impact in our lives.”"
