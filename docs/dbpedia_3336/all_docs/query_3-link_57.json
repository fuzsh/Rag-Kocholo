        "text": "This article is part of the Guardian's World Cup 2014 Experts' Network, a cooperation between 32 of the best media organisations from the countries who have qualified for the finals in Brazil. theguardian.com is running previews from four countries each day in the run-up to the tournament kicking off on 12 June.\n\nOgenyi Onazi appeared to be just another unknown player in the backwaters of the Nigerian football system until fate played a part in his emergence in the autumn of 2009.\n\nOnazi was part of the Nigeria team who hosted the Under-17 World Cup, a tournament that also featured some of the planet's best new kids on the block, including Neymar, Philippe Coutinho, Isco, Koke and Mario Götze.\n\nAlways competitive at junior levels (Nigeria won the 2013 Under-17 World Cup), Nigeria's preparations for that competition on home soil had been a study in how not to prepare a team, as the selection process was bedevilled by the removal of 17 members of the squad after they failed the MRI test that had been introduced by Fifa to curb age cheating.\n\nA new coach, John Obu, was forced to call up several replacements, including a pair from a church-sponsored team in Lagos called My People which was set up by senior prophet TB Joshua – they were the striker Sani Emmanuel and Onazi.\n\nAt first, it was the latter who made more of an impression as he was named the tournament's best player having scored five goals on Nigeria's progression to the final, where they were beaten 1-0 by Switzerland.\n\nAll the attention of the scouts was focused on him but eventually the Italian side Lazio offered the two friends a trial, before signing them both in 2011. However, while Sani struggled, Onazi has blossomed into a smooth operator in midfield.\n\nHe was promoted to the Lazio first team at the age of 19 and would make his Serie A debut in the penultimate match of the season, coming on as a substitute as Lazio beat Atalanta 2-0.\n\nThe following season he would begin to make his mark, most notably an eye-catching performance against Tottenham in a Europa League game at White Hart Lane, and it was not long before Nigeria came calling.\n\nOnazi made his debut for the Super Eagles at home to Liberia in a crucial Africa Cup of Nations 2013 qualifier in Calabar, and in his second game, a friendly in the United States, he scored his first goal for Nigeria in a 3-1 win over Venezuela.\n\nHis inclusion in the ACN squad for the 2013 finals was seen as that of a fringe player, but after starting as a substitute in Nigeria's opening draw with Burkina Faso, he came on in that game and has been a regular ever since.\n\nOnazi provides the same cover for Nigeria's midfield playmaker Mikel John Obi that he gives to Cristian Ledesma at Lazio and, despite his sleek passing, his strongest attribute is his ability to break up play which has earned him lots of yellow cards and was also why he missed out on the 2013 Confederations Cup through injury.\n\nMany believe that Nigeria's failure to advance from their group in that tournament in Brazil last year was down to the absence of Onazi. He returned to the team for the Nelson Mandela challenge away to South Africa in Durban, and was back to his combative best as Nigeria won 2-0.\n\nI spent four days with the team in Durban and one thing that struck me was Onazi's humble disposition and his very religious disposition. As he told me: \"God and my family are the two most important elements of my life. I wouldn't be where I am today without them.\"\n\nHe talks fondly about spending his holidays back in the central Nigerian city of Jos with his mother and older brothers, Oche and Agbo, with Oche as his biggest influence. But it was Onazi's mother who would buy him kits and register him with local teams and tournaments.\n\nIn the 2-2 draw against Italy in November at Fulham's Craven Cottage Onazi put in a mature display that led the coach, Stephen Keshi, to wax lyrical about his emerging star.\n\n\"A lot of people asked me questions why I believed so much in him when I called him into the squad,\" said Keshi. \"He has come on greatly in the last year – always improving, always demanding the ball, showing for team-mates in trouble and showing high tactical awareness in the heat of the battle. Like many of his team-mates he is only going to get better.\"\n\nRecent reports have linked Onazi to Tottenham and Liverpool and there is no doubt the World Cup is his shop window. He will be the player who will galvanise the Nigeria team in Brazil from deep. While a lot of teams will focus on Mikel, look out for Onazi's tenacity and a lesser-known part of his game, the ability to shoot from distance and with deadly accuracy.\n\nOnazi will also relish the company of two others from that 2009 under-17 team – his fellow midfielder Ramon Azeez and the Chelsea centre-back Kenneth Omeruo. Unfortunately the rest of that side have been lost in the football wilderness.\n\nEmeka Enyadike is a journalist for SuperSport in Nigeria\n\nFollow him here on Twitter\n\nClick here for a tactical analysis of Nigeria"
