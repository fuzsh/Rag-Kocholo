However, in 2011, after trials at several clubs in Europe, Emmanuel signed for Italian Serie A side S.S. Lazio where he was immediately put into their Primavera side.\n\nIn 2012, Emmanuel signed for U.S. Salernitana 1919 of the Lega Pro Seconda Divisione on a co-owned basis from Lazio.\n\nPost Views: 1"
