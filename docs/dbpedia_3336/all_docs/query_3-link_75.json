        "text": "Sani Emmanuel, the former Nigerian football starlet whose recent social media plea for help to fund an operation for his career-threatening injury made headlines, has revealed a stunning plot against prominent Nigerian Pastor TB Joshua by some ‘big men of God’.\n\nIn a tell-all post on Facebook\n\n(https://www.facebook.com/emmanuel.sani/posts/10211694606399866)\n\nEmmanuel revealed he received a phone call from “a woman named Bisola Johnson” who spoke to him for over two hours, promising substantive financial benefits if he agreed “to testify against TB Joshua”.\n\n“She spoke on her relationship with some big men of God,” he asserted, adding they would assist him to “raise up to 10 million naira for my surgery” on the condition that he damningly reveal TB Joshua used his “star” for a ritual.\n\n“She said I had to change the name Emmanuel as the name is cursed,” Sani continued, revealing Johnson tried repeatedly “to convince me that TB Joshua is not a real man of God.”\n\nEmmanuel provided evidence by uploading an audio recording of one of his conversations with Johnson onto SoundCloud\n\n(https://soundcloud.com/user-652685043/bisola-johnson-call-to-sani-emmanuel)\n\nwhere she can be heard coaching him on how to respond if asked about his injury and Joshua’s role in not alleviating it.\n\nSani’s rise to footballing relevance during the 2009 U-17 World Cup, where he won the coveted Golden Ball as the tournament’s best player, was well connected to TB Joshua.\n\nThe young footballer played for My People FC, the grassroots football academy founded and funded by the cleric, revealing in interviews then that he worked as an “altar boy” in The Synagogue, Church Of All Nations (SCOAN).\n\nBefore Sani and his team-mate Ogenyi Onazi were selected to represent the Golden Eaglets, Joshua also sponsored their trip to Sweden to play for a lower-tier team.\n\nClearly miffed at Johnson’s smear campaign against the cleric and her attempts to embroil him in it, Emmanuel stated that he “grew up in the Synagogue” and described Joshua as “the best dad in the world.”\n\n“If not TB Joshua, I would have ended up playing street football at a village called Aso Pada in Abuja,” the footballer continued, adding “he raised me from nobody to somebody.”\n\nSani also revealed that his social media plea for help led to probing questions from people familiar with his connection to Joshua.\n\n“I have received calls and messages from people, asking why couldn’t the man of God help me or heal me,” he stated, explaining that Joshua is just “like you and I” but simply being “used by God”.\n\n“A prophet is not a magician. I believe my time of healing will surely come,” he concluded, before revealing he had been distant from the cleric for a long time and desired to “come back home”.\n\nDays earlier, Emmanuel revealed in an Instagram post that his former team-mate Ogenyi Onazi had paid N1.4m ($4,000) to enable him to undergo surgery for achilles tendonitis which had plagued him since the onset of his career.\n\nAfter his breakout performances at the FIFA U-17 World Cup, Emmanuel had trials with Chelsea and Tottenham before a brief stint at Italian side Lazio but persistent injuries hampered him from making any mark.\n\nSani’s revelation is not the first-time prominent clerics have been implicated in efforts to publicly discredit TB Joshua.\n\nEarlier this year, a video on Emmanuel TV’s YouTube channel chronicled the confession of an ex-militant named James who admitted he was paid “huge amounts” by a Nigerian pastor to “lie against TB Joshua” and malign his ministry in “a public crusade”.\n\nBisola Johnson, the initiator of the phone call with Sani, has been a long-term nemesis of Joshua, brazenly accusing him – without evidence – of perpetuating all manner of atrocities within his popular church.\n\nJohnson, who worked in The SCOAN for several years before turning against her former boss, has previously admitted on camera to being mentally unstable and was recently accused of fraud by a US-based businessman.\n\nIhechukwu Njoku is a freelance Nigerian journalist\n\nAddressing the assembly in the lull of the adoration music, Prophet T. B. Joshua underscored the fact that\n\nour fight is not against flesh and blood but against principalities and demons of all authorities and rankings. As our fight is targeted at demons and principalities, it is not easy to determine our closing time in the Sunday service. In our case, we react proactively to the attack of the devil as and when observed. Demons attack mankind everywhere and every time and we must react as enjoined in Mark 16:17 where God says, in my name you shall cast out all demons. Opening his message with a series of rhetorical questions,\n\nWise Man Racine enjoined the assembly to be vigilant if they were not to be caught napping when the Lord would arrive. Are you prepared for the coming of the Lord, Jesus Christ? How prepared are you to receive Him? Where will He find you when He comes? He advised the church to wake up. He reminded the congregation that what we see on a daily basis on the street are demons at work in various ways and manners. Demons use able-bodied men to perpetrate atrocities of various descriptions and dimensions against their fellow men as orchestrated by the devil whose pre-occupation is to distract mankind from his Creator, God. Demon’s purpose is to distract man from God. There is an unending war between eternity and things which are intrinsically temporal in nature. A war between Christ and evil which is also the war between the Spirit and flesh is unending, according to him. This he maintained would lead to the topic of his message which is:\n\nTHE BATTLE OF THE AGES\n\nOurs is a fight with enemies that we can’t see. He referred the congregation to 2 Corinthians 10:3-5. The weapons of warfare are not carnal, for ours are enemies without flesh. The first place to be victorious is in our mind, he emphasised. It is a war between knowledge and ignorance. He enjoined the congregation to find security in God’s hands. It is in God’s hands that we have victory and blessing. Freedom from fear is in God’s hands. If God is with you, who can be against you? He further reminded the congregation of the Lord’s promise to set a table before you in the presence of your enemies. He advised his listeners to look up to the Lord for eternal victory. Jesus’ victory is a supernatural victory and we should rise up in heart and mind for things above. Our victory is past victory as Jesus, by His victory over the devil, has conquered the world for us. He gave biblical backing to his point by asking the church to open Matthew 4:3 for the Lord’s temptation. The devil tempted Jesus with bread because he knew that after His forty days of fasting and praying, He must be hungry. The devil tempted Jesus to put on a sensational display of power. Jesus, though had all the power, presumed upon the Holy Spirit. This teaches us that the power given to us is not to be exercised at our own will but at the will of God.\n\nBROKEN HOMES AND RECONCILIATION\n\nMounting the altar in succession to the Wise Man, Prophet T.B. Joshua x-rayed the various problems challenging the unity in many families today. In many cases, he went on, families don’t go together to church because there isn’t unity enough in the family to justify that. Even in the same church, husband and wife sit far apart to be comfortable. All this, he maintained, is the work of the devil. The nature of the man’s job could be a source of disunity as wife and children will not be happy to wake up at 4am for family prayer to enable the man to go to work early. So, when there is unity on the outside, there might be disunity on the inside. Many of your children might not accept your faith but would embrace your money.\n\nA HOUSE ON FIRE\n\nThe man of God directed that the video clip on a prophecy relating to the Nworah family be visited. The clip revealed the psychological\n\nturmoil in the mind of Mrs Rose Nworah following a strange phone number she discovered in her husband’s phone. Dialling the phone number in suspicion and anxiety, Mrs Rose Nworah received the shocking news told, with utmost disdain, by a girl her husband nicknamed Baby-Baby. The girl in question had been regaling herself in an illegal sexual relationship with her husband. As Baby-Baby herself put it, in reaction to Mrs Nworah’s phone call, “I have been enjoying your husband for quite some time and in fact, I am now pregnant for him.” What unspeakable effrontery! What a heart-shattering and mind-numbing insolence! What culpable sacrilege of cultural and biblical norms! The reality of the matter, as explained by Mrs Nworah, is that for quite some time the relationship between the couple had gone sour. The man’s amorous yearning for the woman had atrophied. Much to the chagrin of the woman, the husband never relished her meals anymore; they never slept together nor was the man interested in going out together with the wife ostensibly because of his newly discovered Baby-Baby, who incidentally hails from the same village in Anambra, Nigeria as the husband. Rose, the wife felt disadvantaged by this communal relationship between her husband and Baby-Baby as she, herself is a Ghanaian. In spite of the ethnic difference between the couple, the wife cherishes the marriage and had always jettisoned people’s negative comments and wishes about the marriage. She so loves him that she declares her affection for him to be time defiant because, as she says, her love is for ever and for ever she will love him. In his defence, Mr Uchenna Nworah acknowledged the girl as his community girl but denied putting her in a family way. Taking this as an episode for sermonising before giving his verdict, the prophet drew attention to the beauty of the woman and remarked, in confirmation of the Bible, that the battle is not necessarily for the swiftest and that is why, according to him, there are many beautiful women who, in spite of their beauty, live by prostitution in hotels today while many ugly ones are happily married. He added that beauty in the inside is more important than outward appearance. He therefore enjoined his listeners to seek deliverance in this regard. On the issue in question, the man of God declared that their marriage is from God and the so-called pregnancy claims by Baby-Baby were a mere hoax minted out to create bad blood between the couple. In total relief, the woman wore a smiling look and reiterated her yearnings to bear him all her children and love him forever. Hugging each other in their renewed matrimony, both husband and wife were delivered.\n\nThe next prophecy mentioned a woman, who in her dreams would see herself cutting the head of a goat which, on completion, would turn\n\nout to be one of her children receiving the machete cut. A few days after the dream, the affected child would fall sick and die. No sooner the prophecy was given than a woman emerged to claim the prophecy as hers because she had mysteriously lost three children in the process enunciated in the prophecy. Mrs Janet Peter from Kogi State confirmed the prophecy for herself and added that she had visited many pastors in that regard, in the hope of getting deliverance but all in futility. Developing this strand of the issue, the prophet told the church that it is hardly possible for any pastor to issue deliverance that is predicated on a dream or tale by a victim or sufferer. Deliverance, he submitted, is only possible and efficacious if the issue is revealed to the pastor by the Holy Spirit and the pastor divulges it by way of a prophecy to the person affected. Mrs Peter also disclosed her propensity to eat in dreams. The man of God assured her of deliverance. Many other prophecies, some of intriguing nature, were given and claimed by various congregants after which they were delivered and reassured of a more fruitful life in Christ. God, according to the prophet, has intended that His people should not grope in ignorance and consequently perish. He has, on the contrary, planned that a prophet should be among them. Through the prophet, God has intended to reveal essential information to them for their edification, survival and growth. However, this fact is not appreciated by many people and so, such people deride the prophets of God. The prophet is the only book after all books but which is not available in the market.\n\nThe prophet is the mind of God. He thereafter referred to a prophecy relating to Kenya which was issued the previous Sunday in the service. In the said prophecy, the prophet talked of seeing a place in Kenya where people drink and which would be attacked. It was therefore a warning sounded to those who would believe the prophet. This prophecy is confirmed in media reports that a police officer in central Kenyan town went on a shooting rampage killing ten people in different bars. The shooting spree happened late Saturday in Siakago 150 km North East of Nairobi.\n\nThe prophet went into prayer with the congregation as the Wise Men laid their hands on members of the congregation. He prayed that the light of God must shine no matter what the devil does, adding by way of more spirited prayer, that every power limiting the congregation must loose its grip.\n\nThe first fall-out from the mass prayer was a woman from Asaba, Delta State who in spiritual manifestation, confessed that she was ‘ogbanje’(an agent of satan, often born to die) and had been directed to use her powers to kill her husband. She however, according to her, would not do that because she loved her husband very much.\n\nThe second was a prophecy by the man of God in which he saw a royal father or king among the congregation wearing a charm. He therefore asked the unnamed royal father to come out into the open of his own volition. A frail- looking old man in regal attire emerged from the congregation in response to the prophecy and declared himself as the one at whom the prophecy was directed. The royal father declared his willingness to remove the charm and identify with Jesus Christ. However, in recognition of his age and regal status, the prophet never allowed him to be stripped for the charm in the public gaze. The royal father thanked God for pointing him out adding that the charm had rendered him senile and incapable of identifying any of his fifty children. He was however, told that his sickness was the result of a charm he trod on in the past.\n\nAnother prophecy was given relating to a witchdoctor who had killed seven of his children and instilled fear in the entire community leading, in some cases, to a pandemonium as the gods were on the prowl in the village. The man, as the prophecy revealed, had taken to his heels to the church to seek refuge. The witchdoctor revealed, in confirmation of the prophecy that his wife had been disabled by the same gods and might die soon if proactive reaction was not in the offing. By the action of the gods, according to the witchdoctor, they had disappointed him and he would disappoint them in retaliation by identifying himself with Christ and annihilating them. He said he inherited the gods from his fore-fathers and had built a house for them. He appealed to the man of God for deliverance so that he would survive the present threat to his life.\n\nThe man of God frowned at the old man for killing his children and also endangering the lives of the village people with the gods. As the issue unfolded, it became clear that many people in the assembly had not gone to their villages for the past ten years and more because of evil practices that witchdoctors in these villages had perpetrated on the innocent people. The man of God planned a mass prayer for such people who had been afraid to go to their villages so as to fortify them spiritually and encourage them to re-unite with their families in the village. Following the incessant plea by the witchdoctor who feared he might die if the man of God ignored him, the man of God pitied him and promised to deliver him for the Lord. Earlier, the prophet had intimated to him that he had not included some of his most powerful gods in the train of gods he displayed. The man of God mentioned some snakes and tortoises that constituted some of the most dangerous gods he had. The witchdoctor confessed that those ones were too dangerous for him to toy with.\n\nThe Sunday service had too much in package in form of deliverance and healing for one day and so a continuation service was arranged for the following day, Monday 8th November, 2010 beginning at 12 noon.\n\n51.492659 -0.054239\n\nZambia’s Former President Frederick Chiluba was in The SCOAN on Sunday 22nd November 2009. Here is a news report on his visit, and what he said during a live interview with Emmanuel TV after the service…\n\nFORMER president Frederick Chiluba has called on leaders to seek God’s wisdom as they govern people.\n\nIn an interview after attending a church service last Sunday at the Synagogue Church of All Nations (SCOAN) in Lagos, Nigeria, Chiluba said leaders who depended on God led their nations peacefully.\n\nHis first trip outside Zambia since he was acquitted of varying allegations of corruption, Chiluba returned to the SCOAN almost nine years after his first visit as Zambia’s Republican president.\n\nChiluba in The SCOAN\n\nThe former president, who has been the subject of intense scrutiny throughout his post-presidential era, was a guest of Pastor TB Joshua of the Emmanuel TV fame last Sunday.\n\nWhen asked by an Emmanuel TV reporter his experience of the service, which included the deliverance and rehabilitation of several armed robbers as well as a thanksgiving service for the MVP of the recently concluded FIFA U-17 World Cup, Sani Emmanuel, Chiluba was full of praises to God for Prophet Joshua and Emmanuel TV, which he said he watched daily.\n\nDescribing the service as ‘highly inspiring’ and ‘motivating’, Chiluba hoped that leaders would do well to seek God’s wisdom in governance.\n\n“If you read the book of Kings in the Bible, kings that depended on God guided their nations peacefully and successfully. God never changes. When we depend on Him… we will do extremely well,” he said.\n\nChiluba said since declaring Zambia a Christian nation at the start of his presidency, the country had moved steadily forward.\n\nHe also extolled the virtues of Emmanuel TV, TB Joshua’s Christian television station that is\n\ngrowing increasing popularity throughout Zambia and indeed Africa.\n\n“It is really inspiring, not only for ordinary people but even for great leaders. I have been watching Emmanuel TV on a daily basis and my wife and I not only enjoy it, we are taught great lessons. We learn, we are inspired, we are motivated and we keep believing the Lord is truly with us; He is always present.”\n\nHe further admonished other leaders to follow in his stead by watching Emmanuel TV and inculcating the Godly principles taught there.\n\n“For leaders, it is critical that they watch Emmanuel TV. They learn a tremendous amount of knowledge and wisdom. God’s wisdom is the only wisdom. And it helps you guide and lead people extremely well with the knowledge you receive because every utterance from the prophet is based on the Bible, it’s scripture-based.”\n\nChiluba and his wife Regina were witness to the celebration surrounding two members of Pastor Joshua’s football club, My People FC, who were part of Nigeria’s cadet team, the Golden Eaglets, during their recent campaign in the U-17 World Cup. Sani Emmanuel, the MVP of the tournament, was brought up by Joshua and is an altar boy in the SCOAN.\n\nFrederick Chiluba With My People FC’s Sani Emmanuel And Ogenyi Onazi\n\n“This is a beauty to behold,” said Chiluba. “This is the way you build youngsters, the way you draw them away from whatever life of suffering or what they may be going through, and you build and mould them into very responsible citizens. “\n\nProphet TB Joshua, noted for his charitable works and prophetic prowess, also rehabilitated several armed robbers in the service, an act that won commendation from Chiluba.\n\n“Truly and honestly for me, that is the Gospel at work, they ex-armed robbers are bound to change a lot of people, and we welcome those young men. But remember, that could never have happened if this man of God was not highly anointed; so anointed so that he could be able to speak peace and love to those lost souls and they came in.”\n\nBoth Chiluba and Regina were unanimous in their message to viewers: “Don’t miss a single day without watching Emmanuel TV.”\n\nIt would be recalled that John Atta Mills, the President of Ghana was in The Synagogue in January this year, testifying to the accurate prophetic message Joshua had given him before his ascension to power.\n\nSOURCE: Post News, Zambia\n\n51.492659 -0.054239\n\nAn extensive report fron Sports-Day on the thanksgiving service for members of Nigeria’s Golden Eaglets at The SCOAN on Sunday 22nd November\n\nSUNDAY 22nd November, 2009 will go down as one day the over 20,000 worshippers including ex-President Frederick Chiluba of Zambia will forever live to remember. The venue of worship was the famous Synagogue Of All Nations (SCOAN) church which is fast turning into a tourist centre as people from all walks of life especially foreigners visit the holy place to either seek the face of God or view the environment that has become one of the holiest of places.\n\nThe event was the thanksgiving service organized for the duo of Sani Emmanuel and Ogenyi Onazi who helped the Golden Eaglets of Nigeria win the silver medal at the just concluded FIFA U-17 World Cup. It was in that same championship that Emmanuel won the silver boot and golden ball. The service was put together by the church to celebrate its products that shone like million stars before the watching world and as well give all the glory to God Almighty.\n\nSani Emmanuel Addressing The SCOAN Congregation\n\nThe atmosphere was simply electric as the church auditorium was filled to the brim. Worshippers who could not find their way in due to lateness enjoyed the service from their positions outside as Emmanuel TV crew provided television sets from which worshippers could view what was going on inside the magnificent edifice. The program was scheduled to kick off by 9am but was slightly delayed for about one hour to enable guests from overseas arrive the church premises. One of such guests is former Zambia President Frederick Chiluba who came in an entourage.\n\nThe choir group dazzled the worshippers with different gospel songs that left all standing and dancing for hours all in praises and worshipping of God. The normal service started as soon as the man of God, Prophet TB Joshua entered the auditorium at about 10:05am. He apologized for the delay and explained to the worshippers that guests were being awaited. Before the Prophet stormed the auditorium, President Chiluba had entered with his entourage and seated. Prophet Joshua had to introduce the former Zambia President before taking his sermon from the book of Ephesian. His lesson dealt on why man’s integrity and outward appearance don’t grant him desired esteem position but the grace of God.\n\nHe linked his sermon with the success story of young Sani Emmanuel who came to SCOAN as a needy following the many troubles in his family but was able to rely on God to lift him to the pinnacle of success even though he is just beginning.\n\nAt the end of the preaching which drew wild applause from the worshippers Prophet TB Joshua invited the duo of Emmanuel and Onazi to deliver their speeches and cut the ceremony cake. Both players spoke on how God used the Prophet to touch and change their lives. Emmanuel promised to set up a foundation that will cater for the needy as he was a needy. He further promised a scholarship scheme for the deserving ones to ensure that it is used to discover talents just as he was discovered by Prophet TB Joshua. He apologized to the Nation for the inability of the Golden Eaglets to win the World Cup saying, “God is still saying something with that. It is not our intention to lose the World Cup having fought to get to the final but God knows why he allowed the Swiss to win.”\n\nEmmanuel dedicated the awards he won to the needy sating that “I know what it is to be poor. I am here today to show what God’s ability can do. As we all know, going by what happened on the field, I am undeserving. Yet, by the grace of God, I am the best Under 17 player in the world.”\n\nIn his speech Onazi who came to SCOAN through Emmanuel after both players were initially dropped from the camp of the Golden Eaglets and were accepted to live in the church after being introduced to Prophet TB Joshua who counseled the boys and revealed that God is taking them to higher ground, said “we are here to thank everyone for your prayers and support. I don’t want to repeat myself since my brother (Emmanuel) has spoken on my behalf, I will only add that we shall leave the rest till we go to our future clubs.”\n\nThe cutting of cake took place immediately after the speeches which were applauded. There were two cakes, one for the Golden Eaglets as a team and the other for the celebrants (Emmanuel and Onazi). The cake for the duo was cut after the name Jesus was spelt while Eaglets’ cake was cut after Christ was pronounced. The awards were also placed on the table beside the cakes.\n\nPHOTO WITH EX- PRESIDENT CHILUBA\n\nAfter the cutting of cakes the players were allowed to dance with some of their colleagues from the Golden Eaglets and My People FC and immediately the duo went into photo session. They snapped pictures with family members and colleagues but that was after they took some shots with Preseident Frederick Chiluba who hailed the kids for, “their courage and God fearing stance. Their success should surprise no one because they are in safe hands and on the path of glory. It is good to follow God from one’s youth because when one grows old you will always abide in the house and glory of God.”\n\nThe Eaglets’ duo then went into ball juggling. They delighted everyone with skills as they remained on the floor of the auditorium doing ball work.\n\nTEE MAC RAZZMATAZZ\n\nVeteran musician and multi-instrumentalist Tee Mac stormed the choir and did a special tune for the celebrant. The music of the flute expert held the worshippers spell bound as the handsome Tee Mac radiating in his Aso Oke attire danced and sang to the glory of God. It was a razzmatazz as the music icon stylishly left the stage swinging his flute even as the worshippers applauded and sang on.\n\nDOCUMENTARY ON THE SANIS\n\nGrass To Grace Of Emmanuel\n\nA documentary was showed to the worshippers and viewers of Emmanuel TV worldwide. It was all about the family of Sani Emmanuel. In the 30 minutes documentary Emmanuel’s father who said he hails from Edo State revealed how he came to live in the Synagogue. He stated that he was married to his first wife who initially had four girls for him. Pressure came from his ageing parents who demanded for male children or at least a son as they are growing old and needed to see their grand sons who should keep the family lineage alive. This persistent pressure led him to taken a second wife. But before the second wife took in, the first wife took in for her fifth child and miraculous had a son. Later the second wife also put to bed and was delivered of a baby boy. In all the first wife had four girls and two boys including Emmanuel while the second wife had three boys.\n\nThen the trouble attached with polygamy erupted as both women started fighting on daily basis. On this fateful day the man (Emmanuel’s father) went to work and fighting broke out in his home between his wives. He was called to urgently return home to avert further damage. On reaching home he called both women and as peace talk was going on the younger wife picked a bottle, broke it and drove its sharp edge into the neck of the senior wife who fell and was bleeding profusely.\n\nShe was rushed to the hospital but on reaching the hospital she gave up the ghost. The younger wife was arrested and the matter charged to court, where she was convicted. She had to go to jail with her three months old son. And that was just the beginning of trouble for the man who does not understand how to cope with about nine children. He couldn’t pay school fees and the situation was so bad that two of his daughters were forced into early marriages. In a move to commit suicide he was advised by one of his children to see the man of God Prophet TB Joshua.\n\nHe met the man of God and explained his predicaments to him. In one of the church’s programmes for widows and widowers he was given N150,000. e later sent for his son, Emmanuel from Abuja and the two went to see the man of God. Emmanuel’s father appealed to Prophet TB Joshua to allow his son to live with him in the Synagogue. The man of God in his magnanimity accepted and prayed for them.\n\nEmmanuel started living in the church and helps in domestic activities like cleaning of the church’s environment and assisting in project building. From there My People FC was born and the young lad joined the team. It was from the club that he was spotted as a budding star having shone in friendlies with Gateway FC, Golden Eaglets and Flying Eagles. He was invited to the Golden Eaglets but was later dropped alongside Onazi whom he met in camp. They both returned to the Synagogue when Onazi told Emmanuel that he had nowhere to go. On return they reported to Prophet TB Joshua who prayed for them and counseled them.\n\nThe man of God then organized a trip for the players including one Yakubu Azeez for Sweden. The intention of the man of God was to expose the trio to quality football after which they can return and try out with the national team again. They traveled to BK Bodens with all expenses paid by the man of God who gave the trio $5000 for upkeep aside the money spent to procure visas and tickets. They spent six months in Sweden and returned. On return the man of God ordered them to go to the Golden Eaglets camp again unaided. And that was the story celebrated today. The documentary according to the man of God will continue as the best of the players is yet to be seen.\n\nProphet Joshua: I’m Ready To Guide Eaglets\n\nMan Of God Pledges Support\n\nProphet TB Joshua told the worshippers and viewers of Emmanuel TV worldwide that “I am ready to give spiritual guidance to the entire squad members of the Golden Eaglets because these kids need to be protected so that they can reach the heights that God has set for them. We should not forget that destiny can be tampered with and even altered that is why we need to give these boys God’s cover.\n\n“Whoever among them needs my help in this regard is free to reach me. I will not charge them for this service because we have to give out our precious time and most cherished items as gifts to the less privileged and needy. When you give what you don’t need to the needy it does not count before God. The Almighty God wants us to part ways with things we will greatly miss or feel when we want to give to the needy. Therefore I am giving out my time to help these kids to reach their promised land. Last time I sent out three players to Sweden and I am promising by the grace of God that I will be sending six out to Europe the next time, not to go and sign contracts or to go and seek for clubs but to go for training and equip themselves with the current trend in the game because football is dynamic and it is fast changing.\n\nTB Joshua – Use every proper means to discover the youth’s talents\n\n“I want to use this opportunity to inform everyone that My People FC will be conducting screening exercises every Tuesdays and Wednesdays to select the very best players who will be under our care for free. Those who will not be successful during the screening will be given money to take care of their transport back to their respective destinations. The screening is for the whole world and not just for players within Lagos or Nigeria. We expect players to come from the rest of the world. We will cater for them.\n\nThis is one area that everyone here today should endeavor to partake in. Think of how you can help these less privileged people. The future of these young ones is very important because they will determine our future when we grow old. I am out to help the world. Let’s start building the world, let’s start healing the world, let’s start creating hope for all. We can indeed make the world a better place. We have started with Emmanuel and Onazi, more will follow even as I follow the career of the entire Golden Eaglets squad to the top.”\n\nBy DESMOND EKWUEME,\n\nwho was In The Synagogue\n\nSOURCE: Sports Day\n\n51.492659 -0.054239"
