        "text": "In full radiance for the festivities of Easter and located on a dais replete with artistic decorations that speak for the season, the choir crooned melodies to put the congregation in mood and spirit for the day’s worship after which Wise Man Christopher mounted the altar to give the message. Describing Easter as a period set aside to commemorate the resurrection of Jesus Christ who paid the supreme sacrifice for the forgiveness of our sins, the wise man added the Lord died, rose and reigns in power for us. Citing Romans 5:6, Wise Man Christopher asserted that Christ’s resurrection is the foundation of our Christian faith. But for His resurrection, he maintained, our faith would have been futile. In his message entitled, ‘He Has Risen’, the wise man maintained that when the eyes of our faith are opened, we see God. We know God’s opinion about ourselves and others. By his rising, death is swallowed up in victory. All our worries and troubles are swallowed up in victory. His death accomplished salvation for mankind. The death of Christ makes it unnecessary for anyone to suffer any affliction. God sees trouble as an opportunity to glorify His name. ‘What is your trouble?’ He asked.\n\nElaborating on specific strands of the wise man’s message, Prophet T. B. Joshua informed the congregation that there was no peace by His chastisement but by His blood shed on the Cross. He advised his listeners to follow Jesus bearing His cross, reproach and patiently submit to all His suffering. When Jesus was suffering, some of His best friends were but spectators and onlookers, the prophet added. Jesus was delivered up to be crucified and at crucifixion, He said, ‘Father, forgive them.’ Using the expression, ‘Father, forgive them’ as his foundation, the prophet urged the congregation to imbibe the virtue of ‘forgiveness’ in their daily living.\n\nTWO MEMBERS OF MY PEOPLE’S FC DOMINATE SOCCER IN EUROPE\n\nThe prophet announced the arrival of two members, Messrs Sani Emmanuel and Onazi Ogenyi of My People’s Football Club from Italy where they had been after signing a contract with Lazio – a renowned football club in Italy – which was clearly impressed with the skill of the duo in the game of football after watching them in course of their trials there. In the league match with Premavera where they took part, the two were very instrumental for the victory of their team as Sani scored the first goal within ten minutes of the first half and the second goal in the second half. The other team was awarded a penalty but they lost it. However, they later scored one goal to make it 2-1. Along the line, Mr Onazi scored the third goal while a teammate scored the last goal with a penalty giving them a 4-1 win over the other team. In the last four matches where the duo featured, they constantly defeated their opponents ignominiously. According to the man of God who foresees a very bright future for the duo in their chosen career, he had decided to imbue them with an international outlook in football by sponsoring them to visit reputable clubs overseas and practice with renowned players to make them develop more confidence in themselves regarding soccer. In this regard, the duo were sponsored to Sweden where they joined Boden BK Football Club. They were also in Switzerland where they equally hobnobbed with Young Boys Club, St Gallens, Basel FC. In the same way, they visited Chelsea Football Club, Tottenham Hotspur Football Club, Panathinaikos FC in Athens and SS Lazio FC in Italy where they signed a contract after trials, in which they impressed their host club. After a month, Mr Onazi was privileged to join the first team and also participated in the match against Napoli FC. The prophet told his listeners that he would not count costs in ensuring that the boys’ full potentials were exploited to make them among the best in the world in the game of football. He added that they had just arrived from Italy to give thanks to God in the Synagogue for their brilliant performances and victories in the matches they played in Italy.\n\nThanking the man of God for his unwavering commitment to their development in football, Mr Sani Emmanuel, who by extraction hails from Edo State, re-echoed the prophet’s promises to see them through to the ‘promised land’ in their chosen career as a father and mentor. He recalled his days in My People’s FC in Lagos when, by the grace of God, he took part in the Under 17 World Cup in 2009 playing for Nigeria. It was there, according to him, that he was honoured with the title, Most Valuable Player (MVP). It is worth recalling that he was the second highest goal scorer in that tournament. Since then, he asserted, the man of God had remained indefatigable in ushering them from one football club to another in Europe to have their skills honed. In the same vein, Onazi Ogenyi, a Nigerian from Benue State, thanked the prophet as the source of the confidence for all their feats and victories in football. By the prophet’s unfathomable magnanimity, he went on, they had visited a catalogue of teams in Europe through which they had the privilege to hobnob with renowned players such as Drogba of Ivory Coast and Peter Croach of Tottenham Hotspur among others. He specially thanked God for His grace on them in their chosen career.\n\nTHE ANOINTING WATER IN THE US\n\nRegarding the new Anointing Water, the prophet intimated that prayer line would hardly be necessary if the Anointing Water were applied as directed. In endorsement of the wish of the congregation to watch the Washington DC edition of the miraculous powers of the Anointing Water, the prophet directed that the video clip be activated. The clip revealed an array of faithful who were gathered in eager anticipation of the Anointing Water about which they had gleaned much from the Emmanuel TV. Many of them said they used to worship with Emmanuel TV before they would go to their original churches of worship. In the activated video clip, they surged forward in turns to receive an administration of the Anointing water after which they thanked God for their immediate healing. Many of them with contrary spirits found themselves writhing on the floor following the spraying of the Anointing Water on them. On deliverance, they would get up and thank God. A lady among them, who confessed she had attempted to commit suicide and was consequently hospitalized, received deliverance after being sprayed with the Anointing Water and testified to her freedom from depression and other ailments after the deliverance. Another woman who complained of stomach pain was also healed with the Anointing Water. The same was true of another lady named Mary whose case was difficulty in walking. According to Mary, for five years she had consulted five doctors but her problem remained intractable until it faced the healing fire of the Anointing Water. Many others were healed from ailments of varied descriptions and all thanked God for the Anointing Water.\n\nFORGIVENESS AS A PANACEA FOR THE PROBLEMS OF IVORY COAST\n\nOn the unbelieving stance of many African leaders, the prophet recalled how the past Ivorian President had responded to his prophecy regarding the recent political turmoil in Ivory Coast, telling the prophet in reaction that, of all the men of God he had consulted, only Prophet T. B. Joshua foresaw the impending crisis in his country.\n\nThe prophet took advantage of this to sound a note of warning to the incumbent president, advising him to embrace the virtue of forgiveness if he wanted to succeed as a ruler in his country. In the prophet’s words, Ouattara will succeed by forgiving and forgetting. He should solicit the support of everybody. Unless he does this, there will be trouble. It is a generational curse and only forgiveness can break it. The prophet saw a few pockets of antagonism in the country continually disturbing the peace and only a general amnesty can undo them.\n\nANOINTING WATER BREAKS THEIR BARRENNESS\n\nMr Ologbenga Folunronsho whose wife had been diagno-, diagno-, diagno-, diagno-, diagnOSED with multiple fibroids which rendered them barren for a long time happily came to the platform accompanied by his wife carrying their baby for a testimony. They had tried many other places for a solution to their barrenness but to no avail before they finally visited The Synagogue Church Of All Nations where their solution had been awaiting them. As soon as the wife received administration of the Anointing Water, she was compelled to make the toilet her home where she discharged the fibroid piecemeal. This over, she embraced her husband in a spousal intimacy and conceived the same month. They came to the church brimful with gratitude to God for their bouncing baby girl. The entire church got up in unison to dance in thankfulness to God for the gift of a baby to the very famous couple. In view of the continuation service scheduled for 10am Monday, the congregation conceded to the grace to bring the service to a close.\n\nThe prefatory adoration melody over, Prophet T.B. Joshua mounted the altar to minister to the congregation. He assured the assembly that God was with them and that they should be in the attitude of prayer as the message for the service was being delivered, reminding them that the message would deliver them. Soon after, Wise Man Daniel took over the baton to deliver the message. In the same fervour as the prophet, Wise Man Daniel evoked ebullience in the Church, in the presence of the Lord.\n\nIn the words of the Wise Man, the Bible makes us understand that the name, Jesus Christ has authority and power among those committed to His glory. Christ’s duty is to raise us from death and restore the wholeness and fellowship between God and man. Power comes through the Holy Spirit to those who accept Jesus. In His name you can! A Christian, according to the Wise Man, should depend entirely on the power of Christ, if he must overcome satan. Citing Mark 16:15-20, the Wise Man told the Church that the name, Jesus can drive out demons and poison will not have the power to harm believers. Those who depend solely on God’s power show the evidence of this power in them. They are also the people who can move mountains in His name. Citing Mark 16:17, he said the text advises us to kick the devil out of our lives and the lives of others. Ephesians 1:21 says Christ has dominion over all powers and authorities on earth and in Heaven. In His name you can make wonderful things happen!\n\nMounting the altar once more, Prophet T.B. Joshua cited Matthew 9:18-32, where a man who could not talk was brought to Jesus and He cast out the demon (rather than heal the man) and the man spoke. The prophet remarked that there is the spirit of bondage which causes affliction. The sin of the soul is the cause of sickness, poverty and other problems and when you are delivered, you are free and blessed and this is why, he said, everybody needs deliverance. If one is healed without the spirit being delivered, the healing is only momentary as the spirit will cause a relapse of the ailment. To be blessed effectually, you need deliverance because there is a spirit of bondage from which you need deliverance. Deliverance is taking one from the dark kingdom to light. It is making one a channel of light where there is darkness. When your sins are forgiven, you are delivered.\n\nTESTIMONIES RESTORED\n\nThe prophet looked in retrospect at the major events of the previous Sunday service and remarked that man treats but God heals. One of those who received their miraculous healing was,\n\nMr Isiaka Sadik Fache, an ulcer patient from Okene, Kogi State. He got not merely a healing but also a replacement of his tibia. The leg in question (right leg) sustained a fracture and was rotten to the bone as a result of the ulcer that became chronic in defiance of treatment in both hospitals and traditional medical homes for two years. At a stage in the hospital, iron was fixed in the leg but it never gave the relief much sought after. Consequently, both the hospital authorities and his relations considered amputation as wise and inevitable. Fache, however resisted the idea, being used to the miracles relayed on Emmanuel TV. Much against the advice of his people, Fache came to The Synagogue and he was arranged on the prayer line. As soon as the prophet stretched his hand at him and declared him free on the prayer line, the excruciating pain which propelled the ulcer disappeared. He went home and watched the gradual healing of the leg. As he was having a bath at home, he saw that some bone in the affected area fell off. He became afraid that that might be another problem to contend with. Contrary to his fears however, the Lord was doing something about his effectual healing. The Lord was supplying a spare part to replace the damaged bone and in truth, Mr Fache became healed with a new bone. Mr Fache displayed the damaged and rejected bone on a sheet of newspaper as he told his story to the congregation that listened with rapt attention. Today, Mr Fache can contest in a game of 100 metres with anybody!\n\nThe next testimony came from a couple whose male partner received a prophecy in the Church that the wife, like her own mother, had the spirit of lust and that it was a generational curse. As the prophecy was being issued, the man called his wife, Adeola whom the prophecy referred to. On her way to meet her husband in response to the call, she was enmeshed in a web of spiritual frenzy, declaring herself a queen. She told the prophet that she was a queen of the river and that her husband was her wife much to the consternation of all. She vowed never to recognise the authority of her husband as she was a queen. This satanic assertion apparently sent cold shivers down the spine of the husband and the man of God had cause to tell him not to be afraid. Reeling on the floor in the frenzy of the manifestation, she displayed uncanny bravado in utterances and unwillingness to relent. On his part, the husband voiced his refusal to continue with the relationship as he had contracted a new relationship with another lady, who incidentally was present in the Church at the time. The husband accused Adeola of infidelity both outside the matrimonial home and even defiling the marital bed when he travelled. On account of her marital malfeasance, the husband decided to abort the marriage.\n\nThe prophet however, advised him to reconsider his decision because the Adeola who misbehaved as a mermaid in the past was quite different from the delivered Adeola who had become an epitome of love and care for him and the children. He added that the new relationship with the other woman should be discontinued even though it had advanced almost too far to contemplate that idea. The man of God assured the new lady, whom he never allowed to come out, that he would point her way to success and more marital bliss than she could ever get from the present man. On that note, Adeola and her husband were delivered from a marriage of insolence, insubordination and infidelity to the much desired spate of conjugal bliss in a capsule propelled by the trio of prophecy, deliverance and reconciliation.\n\nPicking a strand from the web of interlocking factors for broken homes, the prophet asserted that demons are the causes of broken homes. Accusing individual members of the family of wrongdoing, does not hit the root of the problem. According to him, families should be reconciled and put on the right course. It was the demonic spirit in Adeola that committed the crime and so the person of Adeola should not be punished. Jesus came to restore the relationship and fellowship between God and man.\n\nANOINTING WATER TESTIMONIES\n\nMr and Mrs Paul Udeh gave a startling testimony about The Anointing Water. According to Paul, his case differed from that of others who had low sperm count. In his own case, there was no sperm cell in his semen. That was the reason the couple remained barren for twelve years as no hospital or traditional medicine could provide a solution. He, wise enough, came for The Anointing Water and got one which they applied and soon after, his wife, Nicky became pregnant and bore him a son. By that, he became happy as his penis was no more for urinating alone but also for procreation. They named their miracle son, Treasure. His wife, he added, nursed the pregnancy for nine months without complications. At the time of the testimony, Treasure was only ten months but Nicky was already pregnant again. The bitterness which plagued the family for twelve years has turned to joy, thanks to The Anointing Water. In her testimony, Nicky told the assembly how people had spoken to her in the shadows to void the marriage as she would not bear children. Her patience and prayers have paid off, thanks to The Anointing Water.\n\nThe family of Folunrosho Olugbenga also came out to give their testimony concerning The Anointing Water. For many years, the couple were barren ‘til they collected and applied The Anointing Water. After that, the wife urinated continually because of the diagnosed fibroid. Soon after the fibroid was wiped out, the wife became pregnant and by God’s grace, they hope to be parents soon.\n\nMrs Ann Nwaobi was the next to give her testimony. In her words, she had been married for four years but had had no child because of fibroid. When she got The Anointing Water and applied it as directed, she experienced an unusual flow of the menstrual blood that very month. When she went for test after the menstrual flow, the fibroid had disappeared. She thanked God for the miracle she got through The Anointing Water.\n\nMiss Powerfree Andrew from Cameroon also came to testify to the power of The Anointing Water. She, once a brilliant student, began to wane in academic performance. In one of her examinations, she passed only two courses out of the twelve that she wrote. It was certainly a big issue that needed attention. So, she came to The SCOAN to collect The Anointing Water to remedy the situation. As soon as she applied The Anointing Water as instructed, she noticed a positive change in her memory power. Consequent on her improved academic performance, she got admission in London School of Commerce and also a scholarship thus reaping prosperity from the Prosperity Anointing Water she collected in April.\n\nIn course of t he second servi ce, the prophet, in a vision, saw a man who hid a gun in the Church premises. He called the young man out and he led the prophet to where he had hidden the gun. The prophet recovered the gun and asked the Church to watch out for the man and his mission in the following Sunday’s service adding that the recovered gun would be handed over to the police.\n\nThe service ended on a happy note as all participants were assured of total deliverance from the hands of satan and its agents.\n\nEarlier this year in an interview with The Guardian Newspapers, the presitigious and renowned Nigerian newspaper, TB Joshua spoke on a range of intriguing issues…\n\nProphet Temitope Balogun Joshua, founder of The Synagogue Church of All Nations (SCOAN) was recently mentioned among the world’s leading faith healers by America’s TIME Magazine. He was also awarded the National Honour of Officer of the Order of the Federal Republic (OFR) by the government in recognition of his humanitarian activities. He spoke to TOPE TEMPLER OLAIYA at his church’s headquarters in Ikotun, Lagos on what the award means to him and why his church attracts high-profile visitors.\n\n“If not for the grace of God, I would be like any other man on the street…” TB Joshua\n\nFirst, how do you feel with the National Honour bestowed on you by Mr. President?\n\nHonour where? You mean the one that was given to me in January. Well, that is not new to me and is not something special to me. As you can see for yourself, a lot of people, organisations, government, home and abroad and even foreign missions have been honouring the grace of God upon my life. Just last week, the National Association of Nigerian Students (NANS) presented me with an award. But then, the honour is not meant for me, it belongs to God. I am just a vessel God is using.\n\nFirst, it was your meeting with the Governor General of the State of Bahamas in the early 90s, followed by the visit of President Frederick Chiluba of Zambia, a few years later. Since then, other world leaders have come to visit you, most recently, was the new President of Ghana, Prof. John Atta Mills and you are preparing to receive a South African leader in the next few days, what do you think is the source of attraction?\n\nIt is a simple answer; it is because their needs are met. People will always be attracted to wherever their needs will be met; and the needs of men vary. What I want and like might be different from what you want; so, you will always go to where your needs are met. It is not in my power, it is God, who is answering the needs of his people. Even in the Bible, people travel far and wide to where their needs will be met. Also, the work of God is like honey. Wherever honey is, insects seek and find it. When God is doing a new thing in a place, people are attracted there. So, these presidents and other foreign nationals come to the church, because of what God is doing here.\n\nDespite this, most Nigerians have still not acknowledged what God is using you to do. Why is it so?\n\nYou see, every man of God has his gift. This is my own area. In the academic world, we have professors of English, Chemistry, and Mathematics. If some people do not need my gift, this does not mean that it is not needed somewhere. If what you have is not needed now, that does not mean that it will not be needed tomorrow. So, it would be too soon to begin to say this and it would be too soon to praise or come to the conclusion you have drawn now. God’s time is the best. Sometimes, what you need at the end might be the most important thing to you. Let me give you a good example: a friend you discover later in life may be the most important friend you would cherish more than the friend you have had from the beginning of your life.\n\nApart from the headquarters’ church in Lagos, which has become a tourist attraction, do you have other branches of the church?\n\nBranches everywhere is not the issue, what is the issue now is making disciples of Christ out of men, making another T.B. Joshua. If this could be possible in the life of Elisha and Elisha came out of Elijah even more powerful than his master, why not also in our time, so that after I am gone, there will be men who God would raise up to achieve His purpose in the world. That is the biggest reward God can give to his servant. Like they always say, there is no success without a good successor. The greatest honour will be to make disciples who will do better than what we are presently doing.\n\nDo you see your children taking after your ministry in the Synagogue?\n\nThe ministry is not a will; it is not a property you can will to your children. It is a spiritual inheritance and the Bible talks about the inheritance of saints. You must meet God’s condition and no human hand can be employed to do the work of God, neither can the mouth do the work of God. It is not a matter of ‘I can speak good grammar’, it is only God that will choose who He wants. It is predestined, as it should be by divine will. I cannot force my children to follow in my footsteps, they have to decide on their own, and I can only point them to the way we also have followed. I cannot give them the power because I am not the owner of the power. I can only do my best to train them in the way of the Lord and if they are ready to follow and make a difference, it is their choice, not mine.\n\nWho is T.B. Joshua?\n\nJoshua is a man like you. I am like anybody else on the street; the only difference in my life is the grace of God. That is the difference and that is what separates me from the man on the street. But with that, because I am a man who has known what it is to lack, I do not close my eyes to the needy. Because I am somebody who has experienced what it is to be poor and without money, I give of what I have to help the poor, because I am a man who knows what it is to be hungry, I give food to feed the poor and those who are hungry, as a way of appreciating the grace of God upon my life because if not for the grace of God, I would be like any other man on the street.\n\nSOURCE: The Guardian, Nigeria\n\nA moving story of a woman pursued by death who finally found freedom.\n\nAs Mrs. Gloria Okhae calmly crossed the road, little did she know that the trip from her home to a local chemist and an innocent purchase of medicine would result in a calamity that would send her out of her matrimonial home and into a living nightmare. Her stepson, the son of her husband had fallen sick and Mrs. Gloria had purchased the medicine with every intent to nurse him back to health.\n\nReturning to the house, she gave the child a dose of the medicine, which was to result in his death – the drug from the store being both fake and fatal. Instead of his death leading to arrest and the eventual prosecution of the seller, this innocent woman was falsely accused of having deliberately killed the boy. That was the beginning of her nightmare, a terrifying experience that was to take her beyond the realm of the living: a journey to the land of the dead.\n\nWith dreams filled with visits from the dead, nights were dreaded and sleep troubled. After some time, the visions started becoming a reality and the nightmare went beyond the night. Daily life became deadly life as eating, bathing or walking down the street to the market were tormented by the faces of the dead haunting her and their voices disturbing her.\n\nFor Gloria Okhae, an indigene of Edo State in the southern part of Nigeria, it was a depressing and miserable life. She travelled through every nook and cranny of the state in search of a solution, finding none. Doctors informed her that her case was beyond medical solution. In Gloria’s own words: “It has been a life of struggle… it has been a life of battle with death.”\n\n“I was being confronted with death. I sleep seeing this child in my dream and some other dead people. If I go to the market, what I see is death. If I am in the house, it is death. If am in the bathroom, it is death. I keep seeing dead people, even when I am in a car, all of a sudden the people in the car will turn to dead people. It has been a life of living among the dead.”\n\n“When I am in the market and I want to buy something from somebody, before I get there, the person may initially be looking normal, but the moment I say: ‘How much is this commodity?’ suddenly the person would just change to a known dead person. Then I would leave. I would not buy what I wanted to buy again. Another experience is that, if I want to eat, I will see dead people. They would want to put their hands on the plate, then I would be afraid and would not eat again, and at the same time, I was getting skinny, because the moment they appear, I have to drop the food… They look like normal human beings, but in my heart, I know that they are dead. …They are familiar dead people… They will show me the time. They will tell me your time is up.”\n\nMedical efforts defied and human solution insufficient, the woman slept one night in a state of utter despair, on the verge of giving up the struggle. However, that night proved to be a turning point as in her dream Prophet T.B. Joshua, whom she had never met in her life, appeared to her. Upon awaking, she packed her baggage and headed for Lagos, the vision spurring her on to search for The Synagogue, Church Of All Nations.\n\nHer first encounter with the one who appeared in her dream was during The Synagogue, Church Of All Nations Sunday Service, 12th August, 2007 where in front of the entire church – he spoke directly to her.\n\nFollowing the time of prayer, led by the Holy Spirit, the General Overseer of the church, Prophet T.B. Joshua said: “There is a woman here, a little child died through her mistakenly. The child was sick and you went to a local chemist to buy some tablets and these tablets resulted in the death of the child. The case later became a controversy, and the Lord saved you out of it, but later you left the place. I am telling you, you are facing the spirit of death. You keep seeing this child and some dead people in your dream. You are light in complexion and tall. Stand up – among the newcomers.”\n\nIt seemed like a dream. Rationality suggested that this was not reality. Within three hours of her entering The Synagogue, Church Of All Nations, Mrs. Gloria Okhae received a message from a man she had never met about a situation she had never disclosed to him, in a context she never expected. ‘God’s wisdom’ was at work!\n\nEven before the conclusion of the prophecy, Mrs. Okhae stood up from the midst of the newcomers, stepped out and moved towards the altar, her hands raised in utter amazement.\n\nNarrating her ordeal to the church, she concluded by saying, “As I was coming here today, they were also coming with me. But when I got to the gate, they could not enter”. As the congregation cheered, the man of God prayed for Mrs. Okhae in the power of the Holy Spirit and she received the deliverance she had been crying for.\n\nThe following Sunday, Mrs. Okhae returned to share her testimony with the entire congregation: “When I was delivered by the man of God last Sunday, I went to the shop right inside the church and asked the woman to give me some snacks and soft drinks. I came back inside the auditorium and started eating and watching to see whether there would be any negative reaction, but I did not see dead people”.\n\nShe said further: “So I went home a happy woman. When I got home…I thought maybe it is because I took the snacks inside the church – that is why the dead people did not come around me. I now asked for food to be served again in the house to know whether they would surface again. When the food was served, I was watching, because they normally come. This time, I didn’t see anything. How relieved I was, how bold and confident I became. That marked the end of the threat of death. To God be the glory”.\n\nAfter her deliverance, for the first time in years, her sleep was uninterrupted and peaceful: “I lay down; I slept for the first time in my life for many years. In fact, my sister said she came to find out if I was sleeping and she discovered that I was having a sound sleep. So, since that deliverance, it has been a life of glorious liberty and no more death”.\n\nMrs. Gloria has indeed come a long way full of danger, trial, tribulation and great threat to her life. What more is there to say: Where, oh death is your victory? Where, oh death is your sting? Death has been swallowed up in victory (1 Corinthians 15:54-55).\n\nThe following Sunday, Prophet T.B. Joshua had a conversation with Mrs. Okhae concerning her ordeal.\n\nOkhae: I see dead people.\n\nProphet: You mean you see them physically?\n\nOkhae: Yes\n\nProphet: Okay! How do they look like?\n\nOkhae: They look like normal human beings, but in my heart I know that they are dead.\n\nProphet: How do you know they are dead?\n\nOkhae: Because they are familiar dead people.\n\nProphet: You know that they are dead?\n\nOkhae: Yes, they are dead.\n\nOkhae: The moment the dead people appear, I have to drop the food.\n\nProphet: Why?\n\nOkhae: I don’t want to eat with the dead.\n\nProphet: Can you remember the day you started seeing these people?\n\nOkhae: It started in the dream.\n\nProphet: In the dream?\n\nOkhae: I will just see dead people in my dream and I will say this dream is frightening Oh! I say, thank God it is a dream. But very soon, I started seeing them in the physical.\n\nProphet: What of that child that died?\n\nOkhae: I was seeing him and some other dead people.\n\nPeople, check out this press interview with TB Joshua, the establisher of Emmanuel TV. Some very stirring and memorable statements there…\n\nProphet Temitope Joshua of The Synagogue, Church of All Nations, Ikotun-Egbe, Lagos, explains the source of his strength and vision, and his care for the aged and needy, to The Week team of Clement Okitikpi (MD), Oluwasegun Abifarin (Editor) and Emeka Ngwei.\n\nHow did the ministry start?\n\nWell, I want to start by saying that no one in the world is born with great knowledge. You become what you are; you discover what you know. But if I begin to tell you the genesis of the ministry, we won’t leave here today. Discovery is for forward lookers. So, no one is born with great knowledge.\n\nI was in a trance for three consecutive days, then I saw a hand that pointed a Bible to my heart and the Bible entered my heart and my former heart seemed to immerse with the Bible immediately. Then the awareness came and I saw the apostles and prophets of old with someone whose head I could not see because He was tall to the heaven and suspended, which I believe was our Lord Jesus Christ sitting in their midst. I also saw myself in their midst. After a while, I saw a hand of the same tall man, I could not behold His face, which was glittering with an unimaginable light, tall to the high heavens and suspended in the air. But other apostles I could see their faces, particularly Apostles Peter and Paul, Prophets Moses, Elijah and others. Their names were boldly written on their chests.\n\nI heard a voice saying, “I am your God; I am giving you a divine commission to go and carry out the work of the Heavenly Father”. At the same time, the same hand of the tall man gave me a small cross and a big Bible, bigger than the one that entered my heart with a promise that as I keep pressing in His time and name, I would be given a bigger cross but if I fail the opposite would occur. I also heard a voice of the same tall man, I could not see His head, saying, I am the Lord your God who was and who is – Jesus Christ, giving orders to all the apostles and prophets. The same voice said to me, “I would show you the wonderful ways I would reveal myself through you, in teaching, preaching, miracles, signs and wonders for the salvation of souls”.\n\nSince then, I have been receiving in my vision, every year according to my faithfulness to God, a bigger cross that means to me more responsibilities.\n\nWhat was on your mind when you started the ministry?\n\nThat is one important area. For instance, I have been alone here (in the prayer mountain) for the last five hours. I dreamt of a place like this – a swampy area, neglected, where people or government will not dream of coming. I come here, sit here, read and meditate. Above all, I know that I am a product of grace, not the works of righteousness which I have done. I am weak; I am nobody, without formal education. What I want to say is that God has manifested His strength in my weakness. It can also be explained that I am like a dog without teeth. When you have a house and you keep without teeth as a guard, each time the enemy comes, it will bark and then the owner will come out to do the work.\n\nSometimes, your miracles look like magic…\n\nWhen it comes to power, God Himself is the power. God often uses foolish things to confound the wise. That is why people like me will ever be grateful to God. In terms of knowledge, education and name, I am nowhere – a neglected stone. I think that is why the persecution was too much. Everything about me is nothing, nothing. But I think no man should boast.\n\nWhen you were young, did you have any idea that you will one day go into pastoral work?\n\nThen, when I was very young, one thing I knew then and that still happens to me now, is that there is an invisible chain, invisible padlock. What I want to touch, I can’t touch; what I want to say is not what I am saying. Where I want to go is not where I am going. What I want to wear is not what I am wearing. It is like there is a restriction. That has been my experience right form when I was young. That is why you will never find or see me accusing or condemning somebody. I have always restored anyone who has done any wrong in a gentle way, instead of condemning the fellow, because I know it is not by my power that I am doing the right thing.\n\nSo, I will say the work of righteousness is not my work; it is my faith in His work. The work of healing is not my work, but by faith, healing is done. The work of deliverance, great and mighty deliverance is not my work, but is my faith in Him. It is not the works of righteousness which I have done, but according to His grace. I am a product of His grace.\n\nWhat’s the difference between Joshua as a person and Joshua as a prophet?\n\nYou have two natures in one person – the human and divine nature. Take our Lord Jesus for instance, for his human nature – he was a descendant of David, and for His divine nature – he was raised from the dead by the power of God.\n\nAs for TB Joshua, I am a descendant of my family in Arigidi-Akoko in Ondo State, Nigeria – but as for the divine nature, the power of God affects my life to give peace to people, deliverance to people and healing to people. Apart from the power of God, nobody would have noticed me or known where I am. So, it is the power of God that brings the difference, the challenges and an uncommon persecution.\n\nUncommon blessing attracts uncommon persecution. Common blessing attracts common persecution. Uncommon progress attracts uncommon attacks.\n\nIs the Ikotun Headquarters the only branch in Nigeria?\n\nNo, we have branches in Akure, Port Harcourt, Jos, Kogi and outside the country also. When you get to the church there, you will see at least 30 different countries represented. There are here to take the ministry back to their countries.\n\nYou are on satellite with Emmanuel TV, which is quite expensive. Where is the funding coming from?\n\nMoney. Something unbelievers can have should not be a problem to a child of God. Dubious and unrighteous people, they have money. How much more a man of God? So, what are you talking about? Unbelievers, they have money and throw it about. So, let’s talk about something unique. Money is not a unique thing. It is common. You see, everybody talking about money, money, money. Anybody can have money – but let’s talk of what anybody or everybody cannot have. Even the cathedral, anybody can have it. Even satan can build a big mansion; it is a question of money.\n\nIt is like you are a prophet without honour at home and among your people.\n\nEven Jesus Christ was not popular among His people. Even till today among some Jews. We thank God for that, because if Jesus had been restricted to only His people in Palestine and Jersualem, how will people like you and me know about Christ and the Kingdom of God today, not to talk of preaching the gospel and becoming a pastor or prophet.\n\nAnd even here in Nigeria, most of the popular pastors at home anchor their popularity at home on their fame abroad.\n\nAre you also planning to go to the Lagos-Ibadan Express Road to establish a camp ground, as it is the fashion today?\n\nRight from my youth, I have learnt not to go with the crowd. If we are in the same business of selling shoes for instance, if you are selling in Tejuosho (Yaba) market, I won’t go there. I will find another market to sell my own. That way, we are spreading. This swamp, which is our prayer mountain, is our camp.\n\nWhen you also look at the missionary works outside the country, you will see all the men of God going to Europe and America. I have decided to face the Asian continent. That way, we are fulfilling the mandate of our Lord Jesus Christ to take the gospel to the end of the earth and make disciples of all nations.\n\nWhat is the motivation for your help to the old and the aged?\n\nMy help is not only to the old people, but to the lonely, the weak and the poor in society. The Bible says charity and faith in Jesus Christ go together. When you say you have Jesus by faith, without the work of charity, it is nothing. This does not mean however that charity alone is enough to bring us to salvation, but it forms the basis for judging our level of kindness – because looking the other way when your brother is in trouble is equal to rejecting Christ Himself.\n\nThen, going to the issue of aged people, in this part of our world, it seems it has become a crime to be old and aged. Even many of those who are well to do in our society, the will build a house and put their old and aged in the backyard, as if they are no more useful. But we want to tell the world that it is not a crime to be old and aged. It is time to show appreciation to God for using them to bring us into this world.\n\nThe time they cannot work again is the time we should take it upon ourselves to take care for them, like babies. The life they gave us when we were newly born, it is time to give them back now they are old. It is not the time we should isolate them, put them in isolation.\n\nRejection and isolation are also deadly and incurable diseases like AIDs. We are even praying for God to give us the grace to build a beautiful resort where we can bring them together and properly take care of them, give them medical attention and those who have not travelled before, we fly them outside the country for them to enjoy the best of pleasure, before they die.\n\nFor how long have you been planning this?\n\nWe have been on this for the past 10 years. It is not just now. These people have been lonely and isolated for a long time, and that has killed many of them. It is not just now that we jump into it, we have been showing that love that Christ gave to us.\n\nI want to tell you that our position in Christ Jesus is enhanced each time we help our fellow brothers.\n\nWhat has been the reaction of these people and their relations to the program?\n\nSome of them – in fact, many of them, don’t even know me. They only see me on the television screen.\n\nApart from the aged, do you have programmes for other categories of the needy?\n\nYes, not only the aged – the Lord is also using us to cater for other categories of people. We have a program for the dwarfs and the destitute. We have also given scholarships to many university students. I don’t know any of these people, and we are not doing it to receive ‘thank-you’ from them.\n\nHow did you locate these people?\n\nI believe many of them are not in Lagos. You people live in Lagos, and put your old people in the village.\n\nPeople say you appear to them in their dream. Can you clarify this?\n\nGod can also use you. Don’t be surprised that people can dream and see you. If God can use the pool of Bethesda, He can use anyone. He uses horses and camels. God can use anything. And I want to tell you that everyone is created with a gift, and each gift is meant to meet a need. It is your gift that God will use to bless others through you. So tomorrow, God can use you to appear to other people, and to pray for them.\n\nHow much is the church investing in this care of the aged project?\n\nFor the past nine years, we started the whole thing with about 1.5million but it has gradually gone up to N6million per month. But I must tell you, my brothers, that I don’t have enough to live a flamboyant life because of all these. I even have some students that I gave scholarship to in Ghana, and many other universities in Nigeria.\n\nIt is a rare privilege to do this. We may think we are helping them. No, we are not helping them. Our position in Christ Jesus is enhanced each time we help our fellow brothers. It is a real privilege to be in a position to give. This is what Jesus meant in Matthew 25:45, that whatsoever you do or fail to do to the least of my brothers, that you do unto me. In other words, Jesus has no farm where He expects you to help Him or an office where he expects you to carry files. He said my farm and office are your fellow brothers.\n\nA lot of churches are getting into the business of establishing universities. Are you thinking along that line?\n\nWhat God has commissioned me to do here is to care for these people – the destitute, the needy and the poor. So that church here can have a theology school. That is all. I should not dabble into the issue of university. Theology, from primary school to university – that is my calling. I should not dabble into science or law. Anyone that wants to study law or science should go to University of Lagos!\n\nTaken From: The Week Magazine – Vol. 26 No. 26"
