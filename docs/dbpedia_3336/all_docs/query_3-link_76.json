        "text": "For My People FC’s Sani Emmanuel, the best is definitely yet to come!!\n\nThe young African player of the year is an award presented by CAF to the most talented African footballer who is yet to clock 23. In scope, the award covers all African footballers, whether professional or amateur, who have had the opportunity to showcase their talents to the world.\n\nThe trend observed in the past shows that no player has ever won the award after emerging the best player at any age group competition. The closest observed so far was John Obi Mikel who won the award on the back of his performance at the U-17 world cup in Finland in 2005.\n\nIn the year 2009 alone, young African players have showcased their talents to the world again; winning the MVP awards at both the U-20 and the U-17 competitions. It is expected that one of these will win the award for the young African player of the year 2009.\n\nDominic Adiyiah:\n\nDominic Adiyiah was a member of the Black Satellite’s team that conquered the world at the U20 level.
