        "text": "Prophet TB Joshua is one of the most influential Africans alive. From the streets of Lagos to recently the streets of Konyo Konyo, his name rings more than just a gunshot from a drunk SPLA soldier. His fame actually extends beyond the shores of Africa, through the coastlands of Europe to the far corners of Asia.\n\nThis man of God’s yesterday landed in Juba and accorded VIP reception at Juba International Airport where thousand received him as the “Savior”. Although his coming to Juba received mixed reaction from netizens he was welcomed at the State House.\n\nHot in Juba shares with you ten of the weirdest things you will ever hear about one of the wealthiest ministers of God in the world.\n\nTB Joshua’s strange birth\n\nEven teenage girls know that should they get pregnant, a little baby is expected after nine months. Any time earlier than that is premature and any time later is a delay. No woman prays for even a month’s delay. And when a baby spends the best part of a year-and-a-half in his mother’s womb, it becomes a totally strange occurrence.\n\nWhen Joshua’s mother was heavy with child and it took her 15months before little Joshua was born, it was the first real sign that her baby was a peculiar being.\n\n2. Prophet TB Joshua’s illiterate background\n\nYoung Joshua didn’t complete a single year of secondary school education. Not that he didn’t want to, anyway. But coming from the most humble of backgrounds, he enjoyed very poor educational backing from parents and relatives.\n\nHeck, he had to do menial jobs to keep body and soul together. For a man without any training or skill, carrying chicken waste in a poultry farm was the kind of job he lived on.\n\n3. TB Joshua’s choice of career\n\nNot wanting to be completely useless or resort to a life of crime, Joshua attempted to join the Nigerian army. Even though he knew God was preparing him for a greater calling. But like the Biblical Jonah, he was running away from an uncertain future in the ministry to a guaranteed living in the military.\n\nHe was among those recruited but you can’t outsmart God. A last minute train breakdown en route to the military academy ensured he missed the chance and pass up the opportunity.\n\n4. TB Joshua’s peculiar attraction\n\nGod eventually fulfilled his promises to Prophet TB Joshua, enlarging his ministry to become one of the most sought after ministers of God in the world.\n\nHis church headquarters in Lagos, the Synagogue Church of All Nations, SCOAN, attracts more weekly attendees than the combined number of visitors to the Buckingham palace and the tower of London. It is as much a religious sanctuary as it is a tourist attraction centre.\n\n5. TB Joshua’s unusual anointing water\n\nHealing and miracle works are key components of Prophet JB Joshua’s calling. Many have received their healing through water prayed to by Prophet Joshua. If you can but obtain the ‘Holy Water’ even if you can’t physically go to the Synagogue in Lagos, your healing might just be next.\n\nThis weird conviction sparked a stampede in Ghana which resulted in the death of at least four people with several others injured.\n\nThe Holy Water usually costs a nominal fee but there are special occasions where it is distributed for free.\n\n6. His other odd church products\n\nThe Holy Water, however, is not the only product on sale at the church. Other hot-selling items at the SCOAN apart from the anointing water include car stickers, books and special oils.\n\nPeople have criticised the church’s ‘exploitation’ of innocent people trying to break free of poverty. One notable pastor was quoted as saying ‘Jesus Christ never sold these things’. Forbes estimated the Prophet TB Joshua to be worth up to $15million. That’s a significant wealth for someone who is not a tradition businessman.\n\n7. TB Joshua’s strange church members\n\nGhana’s late president, John Atta Mills, was a prominent follower and friend of the Synagogue Church of All Nations. So is South Africa’s Winnie Mandela.\n\nNotable Ghanaian human rights lawyer Kwabla Senanu has publicly proclaimed his membership. Musician Dennis Williams, famous Nigerian actress Camilla Mberekpe, and Super Eagles energetic midfielder, Ogeyi Onazi have all given testimonies of how their interaction with Prophet TB Joshua has influenced their lives positively.\n\nThe guest list continues to grow: Patience Goodluck, wife of Nigeria’s President. Star actor Jim Iyke Late former Zambian President Frederick Chiluba. How much influential can a Prophet get?\n\n8. TB Joshua’s regular divine miracles\n\nIt’s like never before. Not since Christ. Videos of healing of incurable disabilities and illnesses such as HIV/AIDs originating from SCOOAN continue to flood YouTube. Countless testimonies abound from people all over Africa- Togo, Kenya, Ghana, South Africa, Nigeria, even Europeans.\n\nMedical reports from reputable medical institutions are a prerequisite for prayer for any ailment in an attempt to authenticate the miracles occurring. Top Nollywood act, Tonto Dikeh testified that TB Joshua’s prayers on Emmanuel TV stopped her smoking habit of 14 years.\n\nA host of other public figures and celebrities have claimed to have been healed by the prophet. Ghanaian goalkeeper Richard Kingston couldn’t procure a contract since 2011. TB Joshua prayed for him and he got hired by a Turkish club.\n\n9. His uncanny love for football\n\nAside from fasting, praying and preaching, the SCOAN Leader has another unhidden passion: Football!\n\nIn 2009, Prophet TB Joshua started a football club, My People’s FC, for the youths in the ministry. Sani Emmanuel, top scorer and tournament’s Most Valuable Player at the 2009 FIFA U17 World Cup was a product of the club. In fact, Sani lived in the SCOAN for several years prior to that tourney.\n\nSani’s former colleague at My People’s FC, midfielder Ogenyi Onazi, now plays for Lazio and is a key player for the Super Eagles.\n\n10. His most bizarre prophecies\n\nCurrent WBO International Light Middleweight boxing champion, King Davidson Emenogu once admitted that back in the days when he was a struggling, up-and-coming pugilist, Prophet TB Joshua told him he would one day become a world boxing champion.\n\nMembers of his congregations confessed that the Prophet even foretold Michael Jackson’s death.\n\nIn 2012, he also prophesized the death of an African president, a few weeks later Binguwa Mutharika, President of Malawi died.\n\nTB Joshua was reported to have predicted the outcome of the final AFCON match between Zambia and clear favourites, Ivory Coast. Against the odds, he said Zambia would win and they did. In another AFCON final match between Nigeria and Burkina Faso, his prediction that Nigeria would win was spot on."
