Thank you very much, brother. May God continue to bless you. The surgery is scheduled for 2nd of December 2019,” Emmanuel wrote on his Intagram page.\n\nEmmanuel once had stints with Italian clubs, Lazio and Salernitana.\n\nHe last played for Isreali club, Beitar Jerusalam.\n\nBy Adeboye Amosu\n\nRelated"
