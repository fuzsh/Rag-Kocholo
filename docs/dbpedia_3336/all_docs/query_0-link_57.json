        "text": "In full radiance for the festivities of Easter and located on a dais replete with artistic decorations that speak for the season, the choir crooned melodies to put the congregation in mood and spirit for the day’s worship after which Wise Man Christopher mounted the altar to give the message. Describing Easter as a period set aside to commemorate the resurrection of Jesus Christ who paid the supreme sacrifice for the forgiveness of our sins, the wise man added the Lord died, rose and reigns in power for us. Citing Romans 5:6, Wise Man Christopher asserted that Christ’s resurrection is the foundation of our Christian faith. But for His resurrection, he maintained, our faith would have been futile. In his message entitled, ‘He Has Risen’, the wise man maintained that when the eyes of our faith are opened, we see God. We know God’s opinion about ourselves and others. By his rising, death is swallowed up in victory. All our worries and troubles are swallowed up in victory. His death accomplished salvation for mankind. The death of Christ makes it unnecessary for anyone to suffer any affliction. God sees trouble as an opportunity to glorify His name. ‘What is your trouble?’ He asked.\n\nElaborating on specific strands of the wise man’s message, Prophet T. B. Joshua informed the congregation that there was no peace by His chastisement but by His blood shed on the Cross. He advised his listeners to follow Jesus bearing His cross, reproach and patiently submit to all His suffering. When Jesus was suffering, some of His best friends were but spectators and onlookers, the prophet added. Jesus was delivered up to be crucified and at crucifixion, He said, ‘Father, forgive them.’ Using the expression, ‘Father, forgive them’ as his foundation, the prophet urged the congregation to imbibe the virtue of ‘forgiveness’ in their daily living.\n\nTWO MEMBERS OF MY PEOPLE’S FC DOMINATE SOCCER IN EUROPE\n\nThe prophet announced the arrival of two members, Messrs Sani Emmanuel and Onazi Ogenyi of My People’s Football Club from Italy where they had been after signing a contract with Lazio – a renowned football club in Italy – which was clearly impressed with the skill of the duo in the game of football after watching them in course of their trials there. In the league match with Premavera where they took part, the two were very instrumental for the victory of their team as Sani scored the first goal within ten minutes of the first half and the second goal in the second half. The other team was awarded a penalty but they lost it. However, they later scored one goal to make it 2-1. Along the line, Mr Onazi scored the third goal while a teammate scored the last goal with a penalty giving them a 4-1 win over the other team. In the last four matches where the duo featured, they constantly defeated their opponents ignominiously. According to the man of God who foresees a very bright future for the duo in their chosen career, he had decided to imbue them with an international outlook in football by sponsoring them to visit reputable clubs overseas and practice with renowned players to make them develop more confidence in themselves regarding soccer. In this regard, the duo were sponsored to Sweden where they joined Boden BK Football Club. They were also in Switzerland where they equally hobnobbed with Young Boys Club, St Gallens, Basel FC. In the same way, they visited Chelsea Football Club, Tottenham Hotspur Football Club, Panathinaikos FC in Athens and SS Lazio FC in Italy where they signed a contract after trials, in which they impressed their host club. After a month, Mr Onazi was privileged to join the first team and also participated in the match against Napoli FC. The prophet told his listeners that he would not count costs in ensuring that the boys’ full potentials were exploited to make them among the best in the world in the game of football. He added that they had just arrived from Italy to give thanks to God in the Synagogue for their brilliant performances and victories in the matches they played in Italy.\n\nThanking the man of God for his unwavering commitment to their development in football, Mr Sani Emmanuel, who by extraction hails from Edo State, re-echoed the prophet’s promises to see them through to the ‘promised land’ in their chosen career as a father and mentor. He recalled his days in My People’s FC in Lagos when, by the grace of God, he took part in the Under 17 World Cup in 2009 playing for Nigeria. It was there, according to him, that he was honoured with the title, Most Valuable Player (MVP). It is worth recalling that he was the second highest goal scorer in that tournament. Since then, he asserted, the man of God had remained indefatigable in ushering them from one football club to another in Europe to have their skills honed. In the same vein, Onazi Ogenyi, a Nigerian from Benue State, thanked the prophet as the source of the confidence for all their feats and victories in football. By the prophet’s unfathomable magnanimity, he went on, they had visited a catalogue of teams in Europe through which they had the privilege to hobnob with renowned players such as Drogba of Ivory Coast and Peter Croach of Tottenham Hotspur among others. He specially thanked God for His grace on them in their chosen career.\n\nTHE ANOINTING WATER IN THE US\n\nRegarding the new Anointing Water, the prophet intimated that prayer line would hardly be necessary if the Anointing Water were applied as directed. In endorsement of the wish of the congregation to watch the Washington DC edition of the miraculous powers of the Anointing Water, the prophet directed that the video clip be activated. The clip revealed an array of faithful who were gathered in eager anticipation of the Anointing Water about which they had gleaned much from the Emmanuel TV. Many of them said they used to worship with Emmanuel TV before they would go to their original churches of worship. In the activated video clip, they surged forward in turns to receive an administration of the Anointing water after which they thanked God for their immediate healing. Many of them with contrary spirits found themselves writhing on the floor following the spraying of the Anointing Water on them. On deliverance, they would get up and thank God. A lady among them, who confessed she had attempted to commit suicide and was consequently hospitalized, received deliverance after being sprayed with the Anointing Water and testified to her freedom from depression and other ailments after the deliverance. Another woman who complained of stomach pain was also healed with the Anointing Water. The same was true of another lady named Mary whose case was difficulty in walking. According to Mary, for five years she had consulted five doctors but her problem remained intractable until it faced the healing fire of the Anointing Water. Many others were healed from ailments of varied descriptions and all thanked God for the Anointing Water.\n\nFORGIVENESS AS A PANACEA FOR THE PROBLEMS OF IVORY COAST\n\nOn the unbelieving stance of many African leaders, the prophet recalled how the past Ivorian President had responded to his prophecy regarding the recent political turmoil in Ivory Coast, telling the prophet in reaction that, of all the men of God he had consulted, only Prophet T. B. Joshua foresaw the impending crisis in his country.\n\nThe prophet took advantage of this to sound a note of warning to the incumbent president, advising him to embrace the virtue of forgiveness if he wanted to succeed as a ruler in his country. In the prophet’s words, Ouattara will succeed by forgiving and forgetting. He should solicit the support of everybody. Unless he does this, there will be trouble. It is a generational curse and only forgiveness can break it. The prophet saw a few pockets of antagonism in the country continually disturbing the peace and only a general amnesty can undo them.\n\nANOINTING WATER BREAKS THEIR BARRENNESS\n\nMr Ologbenga Folunronsho whose wife had been diagno-, diagno-, diagno-, diagno-, diagnOSED with multiple fibroids which rendered them barren for a long time happily came to the platform accompanied by his wife carrying their baby for a testimony. They had tried many other places for a solution to their barrenness but to no avail before they finally visited The Synagogue Church Of All Nations where their solution had been awaiting them. As soon as the wife received administration of the Anointing Water, she was compelled to make the toilet her home where she discharged the fibroid piecemeal. This over, she embraced her husband in a spousal intimacy and conceived the same month. They came to the church brimful with gratitude to God for their bouncing baby girl. The entire church got up in unison to dance in thankfulness to God for the gift of a baby to the very famous couple. In view of the continuation service scheduled for 10am Monday, the congregation conceded to the grace to bring the service to a close.\n\nFrederick Chiluba, the former president of Zambia, is admonising all to watch Emmanuel TV, saying it is a source of wisdom and inspiration for the nations…\n\nHis first trip outside Zambia since he was famously acquitted of varying allegations of corruption, Frederick Chiluba has returned to The Synagogue, Church of All Nations (SCOAN) in Lagos, Nigeria, almost 9 years after his first visit when President.\n\nThe former president, who has been the subject of intense scrutiny throughout his post-presidential era, was a guest of Pastor TB Joshua of the Emmanuel TV fame this Sunday, and witnessed an explosive service at The SCOAN, lasting an extraordinary 10 hours.\n\nWhen asked by an Emmanuel TV reporter his experience of the service, which included the deliverance and rehabilitation of several armed robbers as well as a thanksgiving service for the MVP of the recently concluded FIFA U-17 World Cup, Sani Emmanuel, Chiluba was full of praises to God for Prophet Joshua and Emmanuel TV, which he said he watched daily.\n\nDescribing the service as ‘highly inspiring’ and ‘motivating’, he opined that leaders would do well to seek God’s wisdom in governance. “If you read the book of Kings in the Bible, kings that depended on God guided their nations peacefully and successfully. God never changes. When we depend on Him… we will do extremely well,” he said, stating that since declaring Zambia a Christian nation at the start of his presidency, the country had moved steadily forward.\n\nHe also extolled the virtues of Emmanuel TV, TB Joshua’s Christian television station that is growing increasing popular throughout Zambia and indeed Africa. “It is really inspiring, not only for ordinary people but even for great leaders. I have been watching Emmanuel TV on a daily basis and my wife and I not only enjoy it, we are taught great lessons. We learn, we are inspired, we are motivated and we keep believing the Lord is truly with us; He is always present.”\n\nHe further admonished other leaders to follow in his stead by watching Emmanuel TV and inculcating the godly principles taught there. “For leaders, it is critical that they watch Emmanuel TV. They learn a tremendous amount of knowledge and wisdom. God’s wisdom is the only wisdom. And it helps you guide and lead people extremely well with the knowledge you receive – because every utterance from the prophet is based on the Bible, it’s scripture-based.”\n\nChiluba and his wife Regina, who accompanied her husband, were witness to the celebration surrounding two members of Pastor Joshua’s football club, My People FC, who were part of Nigeria’s cadet team, the Golden Eaglets, during their recent campaign in the U-17 World Cup. Sani Emmanuel, the MVP of the tournament, was brought up by Joshua and is an altar boy in The SCOAN.\n\n“This is a beauty to behold,” said Chiluba, “this is the way you build youngsters, the way you draw them away from whatever life of suffering or want they may be going through, and you build and mould them into very responsible citizens.” Emmanuel dedicated his awards to the less privileged, stating that he came from a humble background before being discovered by Joshua. “We must thank this man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua for recognizing and locating such talent,” Chiluba noted, adding that it will inspire others to do likewise.\n\nJoshua, noted for his charitable works and prophetic prowess, also rehabilitated several armed robbers in the service, an act that won commendation from Chiluba. “Truly and honestly for me, that is The Gospel at work – they (ex-armed robbers) are bound to change a lot of people, and we welcome those young men. But remember – that could never have happened if this man of God was not highly anointed, so anointed so that he could be able to speak peace and love to those lost souls and they came in.” The robbers had been living in the church for a fortnight following their deliverance. They were all financially supported to pursue the careers of their choice, promising not to return to lives of criminality.\n\nBoth the former President and his wife were unanimous in their message to viewers: “Don’t miss a single day without watching Emmanuel TV.”\n\nIt would be recalled that John Atta Mills, the president of Ghana was in The Synagogue in January this year, testifying to the accurate prophetic message Joshua had given him before his ascension to power.\n\nSOURCE: Zambian Watchdog"
