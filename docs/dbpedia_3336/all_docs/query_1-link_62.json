        "text": "A stirring example that God uses the foolish things of this world to shame the wise! What a God we have to worship, what a Son we have to praise, what a future lies before us…\n\nIn the recently concluded FIFA U-17 World Youth Championship dubbed Nigeria 2009, Sani Emmanuel had the world in his soccer boots. He mesmerized opponents at will, and sliced through defences the way a hot knife slices through butter. He dazzled and made nonsense of defenders, scoring textbook goals. In all, he scored five goals in 221 minutes of play and won the FIFA U-17 World Cup Golden Ball as well as the Silver Shoe, through a dint of hard work and dedication to God, Emmanuel now rides the crest of fame and has become a toast from clubs across Europe.\n\nBut that is not the news…\n\nThe news is that the boy honed his soccer career at a most unlikely place – the church, specifically the Synagogue Church Of All Nations, where he is top striker with My People FC, a football club owned and funded by the church’s General Overseer, Prophet T.B. Joshua.\n\nEmmanuel has since returned to the Synagogue where he lives. And last Sunday 22nd November 2009, he set thousands of parishioners into rapturous celebration as he stormed the sanctuary for a thanksgiving session. Former Zambian president Frederick Chiluba was among other eminent persons that rejoiced with Emmanuel, who dedicated his awards to Nigeria’s rising army of suffering youth, pledging to start a foundation that would help them become useful and influential members of the society.\n\nMany wept for joy as the golden boy, who currently plays for Bodens BK Football Club’s junior team in Sweden, narrated his rag-to-riches story. His father, Sani Unakhasor, from Edo State, was among the weeping crowd, and he too wept like a baby.\n\nHis tears were both of joy and intense sorrow. Joy for his son’s success and deep sadness over the tragedy that brought him, and later, his son, Sani, to the Synagogue. Though not rich, Unokhasor, a father of nine, and husband of two wives, was enjoying life in his little corner until tragedy struck.\n\nOne day, a hot argument burst out between both women, and in a fit of madness, the junior wife, who was then nursing a three-month-old baby, took a bottle, broke it and stabbed her senior colleague in the throat. The senior wife bled to death before she could reach the hospital. With one wife in a hospital morgue and another in detention for murder, Unokhasor’s life took a spin. There was an uncontrollable chaos in his family. Nothing he did ever worked. He could not cater for his children, and two of his daughters got married out of frustration. He wanted to commit suicide. He almost did, until he met Prophet T.B. Joshua.\n\nWell, as they say, the taste of the pudding is in the eating. Below are excerpts from Unokhasor’s heart-rending narration:\n\n“My name is Sani Unokhasor. I’m form Edo State. I’m a widower. I married my first wife with happiness. We had no problem with child bearing when we got married. We had our first issue, a girl. The second one, too, is a baby girl. The third and the fourth are girls. I was confused because I’m the only son of my father. And my father is an old man. Well. I started worrying (about not having a male child). That’s what made me to go and marry a second wife. But as God would have it, my first wife took in before the second, and she gave me my first baby boy.\n\n“In all, I have five boys, four girls, making nine. Then, the junior one has three boys, while the senior one has four girls, two boys. And there was trouble in my house every day. I didn’t know what to do. Should I divorce one (and retain the other)? I couldn’t do it because they both have children for me. Well, I started battling with them. I was at work one day, and the chairman (of the residents association) called me to say that my wives were fighting. I went out to settle them. When I got there, and as I was settling them, the junior one (broke loose), took (a broken) bottle and stabbed the senior one in the throat.”\n\n“I started shouting, calling on people to rescue her. On my way outside to look for taxi, I removed her wrapper to cover the wound because she was bleeding seriously like pump (like a burst water pipe). Shortly after, she gave up.”\n\n“I was crying (He starts to cry, ). I was crying. I didn’t know what to do. The children were crying, too. There was confusion everywhere. I decided to kill myself. But I couldn’t do it. So, I ran to the police station and invited the police. The police came and took my junior wife to prison. They took me to (the) police station, too.”\n\n“Now, my junior wife was nursing a baby, she went to prison with the baby. The baby grew up inside prison. She spent three years there. Then, they asked me to come and take the baby. I took the baby home and began to nurse him. I suffered a lot to see that he survived. The problem was so much I decided to kill myself but I couldn’t do it. I felt that if I did it, who would take care of my children? That’s what made me to be patient. And I started suffering with them. Out of frustration, I gave out two of the girls, who were about 20 years old, in marriage. They married out of frustration and I continued to battle with the rest. Some of them couldn’t go to school again. They dropped out.\n\n(Still crying, ) “To worsen my problem, my sons began to fight themselves: ‘Your mother killed my mother I will kill you’. It was hell. Then one day, my son (Sani Emmanuel) came home and began tell me about the Synagogue Church. I became convinced and I said, ’Let me go with you’. That’s how I managed to come here. I begged God to help me out of this problem. To eat was a big problem. There was no money to feed. Some of the children have gone to Abuja to work for people because there is no money. I cannot do anything to help them.”\n\nAt the height of Unokhasor’s extreme suffering, he found The Synagogue, through his son. Prophet T.B. Joshua restored him with an unspecified amount of money and Sani Emmanuel, whose mum was stabbed to death, had found comfort in the hollows of Joshua’s hands and had become an altar boy, living in the church and, for the first time in a long time, enjoying the world. Later he became a member of Joshua’s football club, My People FC.\n\nSani Emmanuel’s first invitation to the Golden Eaglets’ camp wasn’t quite successful. He was among others who were sent out of the camp. But while his fellow decampees were sad and forlorn, the striker, who was born on December 23, 1992, moved on as if nothing happened. He even encouraged a teammate, Onazi Ogenyi, and took him to Joshua. Joshua counselled them and restored their hope by sending them to Boden BK Football Club’s junior team in Sweden. They excelled and eventually earned another invitation to the Eaglets’ camp. They made the team that won Silver in the U-17 championship that ended two weeks ago. Onazi Ogenyi, Sani Emmanuel and Dami Paul, the Eaglets’ goalkeeper, were celebrated at the Synagogue last Sunday.\n\nBy Shola OSHUNKEYE\n\nSOURCE: The Spectator – Volume 2, No. 82\n\nRead Full Post »\n\nZambia’s Former President Frederick Chiluba was in The SCOAN on Sunday 22nd November 2009. Here is a news report on his visit, and what he said during a live interview with Emmanuel TV after the service…\n\nFORMER president Frederick Chiluba has called on leaders to seek God’s wisdom as they govern people.\n\nIn an interview after attending a church service last Sunday at the Synagogue Church of All Nations (SCOAN) in Lagos, Nigeria, Chiluba said leaders who depended on God led their nations peacefully.\n\nHis first trip outside Zambia since he was acquitted of varying allegations of corruption, Chiluba returned to the SCOAN almost nine years after his first visit as Zambia’s Republican president.\n\nThe former president, who has been the subject of intense scrutiny throughout his post-presidential era, was a guest of Pastor TB Joshua of the Emmanuel TV fame last Sunday.\n\nWhen asked by an Emmanuel TV reporter his experience of the service, which included the deliverance and rehabilitation of several armed robbers as well as a thanksgiving service for the MVP of the recently concluded FIFA U-17 World Cup, Sani Emmanuel, Chiluba was full of praises to God for Prophet Joshua and Emmanuel TV, which he said he watched daily.\n\nDescribing the service as ‘highly inspiring’ and ‘motivating’, Chiluba hoped that leaders would do well to seek God’s wisdom in governance.\n\n“If you read the book of Kings in the Bible, kings that depended on God guided their nations peacefully and successfully. God never changes. When we depend on Him… we will do extremely well,” he said.\n\nChiluba said since declaring Zambia a Christian nation at the start of his presidency, the country had moved steadily forward.\n\nHe also extolled the virtues of Emmanuel TV, TB Joshua’s Christian television station that is growing increasing popularity throughout Zambia and indeed Africa.\n\n“It is really inspiring, not only for ordinary people but even for great leaders. I have been watching Emmanuel TV on a daily basis and my wife and I not only enjoy it, we are taught great lessons. We learn, we are inspired, we are motivated and we keep believing the Lord is truly with us; He is always present.”\n\nHe further admonished other leaders to follow in his stead by watching Emmanuel TV and inculcating the Godly principles taught there.\n\n“For leaders, it is critical that they watch Emmanuel TV. They learn a tremendous amount of knowledge and wisdom. God’s wisdom is the only wisdom. And it helps you guide and lead people extremely well with the knowledge you receive because every utterance from the prophet is based on the Bible, it’s scripture-based.”\n\nChiluba and his wife Regina were witness to the celebration surrounding two members of Pastor Joshua’s football club, My People FC, who were part of Nigeria’s cadet team, the Golden Eaglets, during their recent campaign in the U-17 World Cup. Sani Emmanuel, the MVP of the tournament, was brought up by Joshua and is an altar boy in the SCOAN.\n\n“This is a beauty to behold,” said Chiluba. “This is the way you build youngsters, the way you draw them away from whatever life of suffering or what they may be going through, and you build and mould them into very responsible citizens. “\n\nProphet TB Joshua, noted for his charitable works and prophetic prowess, also rehabilitated several armed robbers in the service, an act that won commendation from Chiluba.\n\n“Truly and honestly for me, that is the Gospel at work, they ex-armed robbers are bound to change a lot of people, and we welcome those young men. But remember, that could never have happened if this man of God was not highly anointed; so anointed so that he could be able to speak peace and love to those lost souls and they came in.”\n\nBoth Chiluba and Regina were unanimous in their message to viewers: “Don’t miss a single day without watching Emmanuel TV.”\n\nIt would be recalled that John Atta Mills, the President of Ghana was in The Synagogue in January this year, testifying to the accurate prophetic message Joshua had given him before his ascension to power.\n\nSOURCE: Post News, Zambia\n\nRead Full Post »\n\nAn extensive report fron Sports-Day on the thanksgiving service for members of Nigeria’s Golden Eaglets at The SCOAN on Sunday 22nd November\n\nSUNDAY 22nd November, 2009 will go down as one day the over 20,000 worshippers including ex-President Frederick Chiluba of Zambia will forever live to remember. The venue of worship was the famous Synagogue Of All Nations (SCOAN) church which is fast turning into a tourist centre as people from all walks of life especially foreigners visit the holy place to either seek the face of God or view the environment that has become one of the holiest of places.\n\nThe event was the thanksgiving service organized for the duo of Sani Emmanuel and Ogenyi Onazi who helped the Golden Eaglets of Nigeria win the silver medal at the just concluded FIFA U-17 World Cup. It was in that same championship that Emmanuel won the silver boot and golden ball. The service was put together by the church to celebrate its products that shone like million stars before the watching world and as well give all the glory to God Almighty.\n\nThe atmosphere was simply electric as the church auditorium was filled to the brim. Worshippers who could not find their way in due to lateness enjoyed the service from their positions outside as Emmanuel TV crew provided television sets from which worshippers could view what was going on inside the magnificent edifice. The program was scheduled to kick off by 9am but was slightly delayed for about one hour to enable guests from overseas arrive the church premises. One of such guests is former Zambia President Frederick Chiluba who came in an entourage.\n\nThe choir group dazzled the worshippers with different gospel songs that left all standing and dancing for hours all in praises and worshipping of God. The normal service started as soon as the man of God, Prophet TB Joshua entered the auditorium at about 10:05am. He apologized for the delay and explained to the worshippers that guests were being awaited. Before the Prophet stormed the auditorium, President Chiluba had entered with his entourage and seated. Prophet Joshua had to introduce the former Zambia President before taking his sermon from the book of Ephesian. His lesson dealt on why man’s integrity and outward appearance don’t grant him desired esteem position but the grace of God.\n\nHe linked his sermon with the success story of young Sani Emmanuel who came to SCOAN as a needy following the many troubles in his family but was able to rely on God to lift him to the pinnacle of success even though he is just beginning.\n\nCUTTING OF CAKE\n\nAt the end of the preaching which drew wild applause from the worshippers Prophet TB Joshua invited the duo of Emmanuel and Onazi to deliver their speeches and cut the ceremony cake. Both players spoke on how God used the Prophet to touch and change their lives. Emmanuel promised to set up a foundation that will cater for the needy as he was a needy. He further promised a scholarship scheme for the deserving ones to ensure that it is used to discover talents just as he was discovered by Prophet TB Joshua. He apologized to the Nation for the inability of the Golden Eaglets to win the World Cup saying, “God is still saying something with that. It is not our intention to lose the World Cup having fought to get to the final but God knows why he allowed the Swiss to win.”\n\nEmmanuel dedicated the awards he won to the needy sating that “I know what it is to be poor. I am here today to show what God’s ability can do. As we all know, going by what happened on the field, I am undeserving. Yet, by the grace of God, I am the best Under 17 player in the world.”\n\nIn his speech Onazi who came to SCOAN through Emmanuel after both players were initially dropped from the camp of the Golden Eaglets and were accepted to live in the church after being introduced to Prophet TB Joshua who counseled the boys and revealed that God is taking them to higher ground, said “we are here to thank everyone for your prayers and support. I don’t want to repeat myself since my brother (Emmanuel) has spoken on my behalf, I will only add that we shall leave the rest till we go to our future clubs.”\n\nThe cutting of cake took place immediately after the speeches which were applauded. There were two cakes, one for the Golden Eaglets as a team and the other for the celebrants (Emmanuel and Onazi). The cake for the duo was cut after the name Jesus was spelt while Eaglets’ cake was cut after Christ was pronounced. The awards were also placed on the table beside the cakes.\n\nPHOTO WITH EX- PRESIDENT CHILUBA\n\nAfter the cutting of cakes the players were allowed to dance with some of their colleagues from the Golden Eaglets and My People FC and immediately the duo went into photo session. They snapped pictures with family members and colleagues but that was after they took some shots with Preseident Frederick Chiluba who hailed the kids for, “their courage and God fearing stance. Their success should surprise no one because they are in safe hands and on the path of glory. It is good to follow God from one’s youth because when one grows old you will always abide in the house and glory of God.”\n\nThe Eaglets’ duo then went into ball juggling. They delighted everyone with skills as they remained on the floor of the auditorium doing ball work.\n\nTEE MAC RAZZMATAZZ\n\nVeteran musician and multi-instrumentalist Tee Mac stormed the choir and did a special tune for the celebrant. The music of the flute expert held the worshippers spell bound as the handsome Tee Mac radiating in his Aso Oke attire danced and sang to the glory of God. It was a razzmatazz as the music icon stylishly left the stage swinging his flute even as the worshippers applauded and sang on.\n\nDOCUMENTARY ON THE SANIS\n\nGrass To Grace Of Emmanuel\n\nA documentary was showed to the worshippers and viewers of Emmanuel TV worldwide. It was all about the family of Sani Emmanuel. In the 30 minutes documentary Emmanuel’s father who said he hails from Edo State revealed how he came to live in the Synagogue. He stated that he was married to his first wife who initially had four girls for him. Pressure came from his ageing parents who demanded for male children or at least a son as they are growing old and needed to see their grand sons who should keep the family lineage alive. This persistent pressure led him to taken a second wife. But before the second wife took in, the first wife took in for her fifth child and miraculous had a son. Later the second wife also put to bed and was delivered of a baby boy. In all the first wife had four girls and two boys including Emmanuel while the second wife had three boys.\n\nThen the trouble attached with polygamy erupted as both women started fighting on daily basis. On this fateful day the man (Emmanuel’s father) went to work and fighting broke out in his home between his wives. He was called to urgently return home to avert further damage. On reaching home he called both women and as peace talk was going on the younger wife picked a bottle, broke it and drove its sharp edge into the neck of the senior wife who fell and was bleeding profusely.\n\nShe was rushed to the hospital but on reaching the hospital she gave up the ghost. The younger wife was arrested and the matter charged to court, where she was convicted. She had to go to jail with her three months old son. And that was just the beginning of trouble for the man who does not understand how to cope with about nine children. He couldn’t pay school fees and the situation was so bad that two of his daughters were forced into early marriages. In a move to commit suicide he was advised by one of his children to see the man of God Prophet TB Joshua.\n\nHe met the man of God and explained his predicaments to him. In one of the church’s programmes for widows and widowers he was given N150,000. e later sent for his son, Emmanuel from Abuja and the two went to see the man of God. Emmanuel’s father appealed to Prophet TB Joshua to allow his son to live with him in the Synagogue. The man of God in his magnanimity accepted and prayed for them.\n\nEmmanuel started living in the church and helps in domestic activities like cleaning of the church’s environment and assisting in project building. From there My People FC was born and the young lad joined the team. It was from the club that he was spotted as a budding star having shone in friendlies with Gateway FC, Golden Eaglets and Flying Eagles. He was invited to the Golden Eaglets but was later dropped alongside Onazi whom he met in camp. They both returned to the Synagogue when Onazi told Emmanuel that he had nowhere to go. On return they reported to Prophet TB Joshua who prayed for them and counseled them.\n\nThe man of God then organized a trip for the players including one Yakubu Azeez for Sweden. The intention of the man of God was to expose the trio to quality football after which they can return and try out with the national team again. They traveled to BK Bodens with all expenses paid by the man of God who gave the trio $5000 for upkeep aside the money spent to procure visas and tickets. They spent six months in Sweden and returned. On return the man of God ordered them to go to the Golden Eaglets camp again unaided. And that was the story celebrated today. The documentary according to the man of God will continue as the best of the players is yet to be seen.\n\nProphet Joshua: I’m Ready To Guide Eaglets\n\nMan Of God Pledges Support\n\nProphet TB Joshua told the worshippers and viewers of Emmanuel TV worldwide that “I am ready to give spiritual guidance to the entire squad members of the Golden Eaglets because these kids need to be protected so that they can reach the heights that God has set for them. We should not forget that destiny can be tampered with and even altered that is why we need to give these boys God’s cover.\n\n“Whoever among them needs my help in this regard is free to reach me. I will not charge them for this service because we have to give out our precious time and most cherished items as gifts to the less privileged and needy. When you give what you don’t need to the needy it does not count before God. The Almighty God wants us to part ways with things we will greatly miss or feel when we want to give to the needy. Therefore I am giving out my time to help these kids to reach their promised land. Last time I sent out three players to Sweden and I am promising by the grace of God that I will be sending six out to Europe the next time, not to go and sign contracts or to go and seek for clubs but to go for training and equip themselves with the current trend in the game because football is dynamic and it is fast changing.\n\n“I want to use this opportunity to inform everyone that My People FC will be conducting screening exercises every Tuesdays and Wednesdays to select the very best players who will be under our care for free. Those who will not be successful during the screening will be given money to take care of their transport back to their respective destinations. The screening is for the whole world and not just for players within Lagos or Nigeria. We expect players to come from the rest of the world. We will cater for them.\n\nThis is one area that everyone here today should endeavor to partake in. Think of how you can help these less privileged people. The future of these young ones is very important because they will determine our future when we grow old. I am out to help the world. Let’s start building the world, let’s start healing the world, let’s start creating hope for all. We can indeed make the world a better place. We have started with Emmanuel and Onazi, more will follow even as I follow the career of the entire Golden Eaglets squad to the top.”\n\nBy DESMOND EKWUEME,\n\nwho was In The Synagogue\n\nSOURCE: Sports Day\n\nRead Full Post »\n\nA feature article in Nigeria’s popular evening newspaper, PM News, detailing the inspiring charitable works taking place at The SCOAN. Remember, your rewards in life are determined by the problems you solve for someone else!\n\nHis words are witty but powerful. Perhaps this accounts for the number of prominent individuals around the world who have paid visit to Prophet T.B Joshua, head of the Synagogue Church of All Nations (SCOAN).\n\nAt the last count, presidents of various countries have been to the church, which is conspicuously located in the hilly Ikotun Egbe, a busy Lagos suburb. The Ghanaian president, Prof. John Attah Mills visited the Church before the keenly contested election in his country, which ushered in his government. He also came to give thanks for his victory. The King of Limpopo, Koshi Kgabo Moloto, and his Zulu, South African counterpart, King Godswill Zwelithni Kabhekuzulu have visited the church too.\n\nYet the man of God, renowned for his exceptional simplicity, is not satisfied, and until he is able to reduce the suffering and hunger daily experienced by the majority, he says his job is not done .\n\n“People are helpless, they have no hope … They know what they want in life and can achieve them when faced with the right opportunities, but they are facing serious challenges in their lives and this is my utmost concern,” he has continued to emphasise – while asking, “How many of these people have you helped to become happy again?”\n\nLittle wonder, last Sunday, 8 November, 2009 the prophet declared a N4.3 million cash gift and scholarships to indigent students, especially the physically challenged. One of the beneficiaries, Miss Ibeabuchi Onyinyechi, who is a second degree student of the Abia State University where she currently studies Business Administration, would forever tell the story of her life and how the prophet has shown her there is life beyond disability.\n\nThe lady, who is now proud owner of a specially made car for the disabled, could not hide her emotions when she shared her testimony. “Before I came to this church, I was living a life of no hope…. from hand to mouth. I used to crawl on the ground because of the problem that made me unable to walk like every normal human being,” she said in an emotion-laden voice.\n\nOnyinyechi continued, “But with the wheel chair donated by Emmanuel TV, a branch of the church, my mobility problem was solved. When I met the man of God, he took over my education problems and paid my school fees. He said he would continue to do so.”\n\nThe beneficiary told this medium that Prophet Joshua has also been taking care of her other expenses including payment for her accommodation, transportation and every other daily expense.\n\n“Last session, we were here and he treated us well. Can’t you see me full of smiles? I am doing my masters degree programme and now this is my second year.”\n\nOnyinyechi never anticipated that she would get more than just the school fees as usual, but that Sunday, after telling the church how she had fared academically, the prophet declared that she must go home with an automatic car. All others of her kind who were in the church for their school fees that day also got blessed with a car gift apart from their school fees, some bags of rice and wheel chairs.\n\nFor Adams Surajudeen, it was a tale of hopelessness turned victory over death and dejection. The final year Computer Science student of Adekunle Ajasin University, Akungba – Akoko, Ondo State, said that being from a poor home, his condition got his parents discouraged. Though he wanted to go to school, there was no money and “l go to the street begging for alms. I used part of the money I derived to pay my school fees till I met Prophet T.B. Joshua. The man of God provided me with money enough to pay my fees, transport myself and solve other problems of life money can solve,” he said.\n\nAnother beneficiary, Nwokorobia Grace, a Mass Communication student of Imo State University, told P.M.NEWS that when she started watching the prophet on television, she knew that her time for God’s blessing had come. “He has assisted me since I first met him,” she added.\n\nThe man of God, who was deeply encouraged by these less privileged, said apart from the scholarships, he was setting up a Non Government Organisation (NGO), to cater for the needs of the poor in the society.\n\nThe beneficiaries of the NGO, he said, would include widows, those who are victims of social wickedness and those wrongfully accused of evil practices. According to him, “How would a normal person feel to see people like these litter the streets?”\n\nSpeaking about Onyinyechi, Joshua emphasized that, “a sister like this actually needs an automatic car since she has her two hands working. She is in the condition so that we can help to support her and others.”\n\nJoshua added that the NGO would collaborate with some vehicle manufacturing companies for the manufacture of specially built vehicles for these set of people whom he said have been divided into 10 batches. “Even if there is nobody to support me, I can sell my property including my clothes and underwear to see that these people are happy,” he said.\n\nBut hardly had the man of God finished explaining the nature of the NGO when calls and e-mail messages flooded the church from every part of the world. While some promised several thousands of dollars, others promised to provide specially built vehicles most of which are Honda ,Toyota , Peugeot brands to the NGO for onward donation to the needy.\n\nHear Joshua: “This donation will be used solely for these special people. We will encourage them too to have good husbands and wives. If you have a beautiful church and the people there are suffering, then it is useless. The heat will continue until we are able to provide adequately for the needy. This is what ministry is all about and you know this has been my calling. I will not relent.”\n\nHe added that another paramount area the NGO, which name has not been made public, will focus on are “armed robbers, especially those who are tired of the act and want to be delivered. We will rehabilitate and help them find their bearings in the society,” he promised.\n\nA church member, who gave her name as Musa, told P.M. NEWS that he had to change his religion after meeting the man of God. “I came to this church on invitation. But my orientation about the church and the man of God changed when I saw how he was helping the poor. Repented armed robbers have been rehabilitated and given money to start something. These people are really doing well.\n\n“I can tell you categorically that this man is a father of over 12,000 needy people, some of whom he does not even know .This church is always busy, full of people and 90 percent are under the care of Prophet T.B. Joshua,” he told P.M. NEWS.\n\nMusa may not be far from the truth. Recently, Mr Kefa Olatunji Taiwo, his wife and 11 children were brought out from a slum in Lagos where they had been living for several years due to acute poverty. The 60-year old man was looked upon as a lunatic due to this extreme condition. One day, he decided to visit The Synagogue, Church of All Nations. Mr Taiwo explained that the man of God suddenly came to him and said, “You are the one I am chasing. Where is your family? You are getting old and a man of your age should not be sleeping outside.”\n\nThe former furniture maker said he told the man of God that he had become a useless person. “I just went there to hide myself when it is night. This is a shameful place, but I have no alternative. That is why I stay there living like a mad man,” he told the prophet. But the man got a comfortable accommodation, his children all got scholarships and he was empowered with N300,000 and some bags of rice.\n\nClose to this was the tale of Philomena Sunday, a mother of nine, whose husband died in 2004. Since then she became a regular visitor to dump sites, where she got her clothing and foods.\n\n“Even the clothes we wear, we picked them up from the dust bin. Sometimes, if we don’t make it early to the dust bin, we don’t have anything to eat at all. We pick bread, groundnuts, yams and everything we could find to eat.”\n\nShe, however, claimed that she was one day approached by a lady she did not know. This lady, Philomena claimed, asked her what she was doing there. “My explanation must have touched her, but I didn’t know she had a video recorder with which she recorded us.\n\n“The lady later gave me the video clip and directed me to go and see the prophet after hiring a bus for us. Even the clothes we wore to church were from the dustbin.\n\n“After listening to our story, T.B. Joshua asked the whole church to come to our aid. I remember him saying ‘we must do everything possible to restore this family and make them part of our families and counsel them, we must not allow these children to be destroyed.’ And that was it. We got a donation of N500,000, some bags of rice and the Bible. He also promised to assist in the education of my children. Viewers around the world who watched us on television also donated money, which was given to us.”\n\nShe concluded by saying she daily offers prayers that God should strengthen the prophet and empower him to continue to help the needy.\n\nHis charity works, which have become widespread, have been attracting commendations, one of which recently came from Senator Anthony Agbo, vice chairman of the Senate Committee on the Federal Capital.\n\nThe senator, who said he watched the church’s television and saw all efforts by the man of God to alleviate poverty, explained that the number of foreigners who trooped into the church made him think about any other spots in the county that could attract such influx of foreign nationals in Nigeria.\n\nThe senator, who is also the National Patron of the National Association of Disabled Persons in Nigeria, said the influx of foreign citizens to the church to benefit from healing and the ‘unparalleled charity works’ of the man of God made him happy to be a Nigerian in spite of everything.\n\n“Watching Emmanuel TV, I cannot see myself fail to glorify God for giving this kind of gift and man of God to Nigeria. The TV channel has made Nigeria one of the world’s hottest spots for religious tourism.”\n\nAgbo, while lamenting that the greatest problem bedevilling the country was poverty, also lamented that the situation is further compounded by the fact that the rich get richer but hold tightly to what they have because no rich wants to give the smallest bit of what he has to the next poor person in his community.\n\nHear him: “On Emmanuel TV, I see in contrast how an individual is being used to associate with widows with pathetic and plaintive cries as well as disabled persons who live under the bridges and on the streets of all states in this country.\n\n“He clothes, feeds and rehabilitates them. Mother Theresa of Calcutta got the Nobel Prize and highest award in India. From what I have seen on Emmanuel TV within the last months, Pastor Joshua deserves a national award; not only for his charitable works, but to glorify God. It is not for him as a person but to God for giving this gift to Nigeria and Africa.”\n\nBut TB Joshua believes helping the poor remains the most important part of his work on earth. “People out there are waiting for you for a lifetime, to give them a chance to smile again. You cannot afford to fail them. Failing them is failing God. Remember, God is speaking to you through them, saying: ‘They are fatherless so that you can be their father; they are lonely so that you can be their companion; they are in want so that you can be their benefactor.’\n\nWritten by Eromosele Ebhomele\n\nSOURCE: The PM News – Vol. 15, No 218\n\nRead Full Post »\n\nA touching interview in Nigeria’s daily sports paper, Complete Sports, with My People FC’s Sani Emmanuel, who has learned from Prophet TB Joshua that we make a living by what we get, but we make a life by what we give… Excerpts\n\nGolden Eaglets striker Sani Shehu Emmanuel rose from the depths of obscurity to worldwide recognition when he came off the bench to score five goals and helped his team to second place at the just concluded U-17 World Cup.\n\nIn this interview with MIKE NDIDI, Emmanuel narrates his story from the squalor of a one-room apartment to life as an altar boy in Prophet T.B Joshua’s church and now, on the verge of a major breakthrough in professional football.\n\nHe regrets the death of his mother but remains grateful to the Synagogue Church of All Nations where he has found home and is desperate to help other kids out of poverty as soon as he makes it big in his chosen career.\n\nCongratulations for winning the MVP award and Silver Shoe. How do you feel getting into this stage?\n\nI am glad because I have always wished and dreamt that God would crown my effort with success though I was not happy we lost the cup.\n\nTell us about your background?\n\nI am from Edo State, specifically I hail from Auchi in Etsako East Local Government Council. I was born and raised in Kano but my parents moved over to Abuja in 2003. My father is a Muslim but I am a Christian because I am now born into a Christian family.\n\nWhat do you mean that you are born into a Christian family?\n\nThe man of God, Prophet T.B Joshua has been responsible for the up-keep of my whole family..\n\nHow did you make the U-17 National team?\n\nI was playing for my church Synagogue Church of all Nations’ team, My People Football Club when I was invited to the national U-17 national team screening exercise after a friendly match with the U-17 team. But before now I played for a local team in Abuja from where I joined Abuja YSFON team. The same year I won a scholarship to Naval YSFON Academy in Calabar but I couldn’t complete my Senior Secondary School Certificate Examination. I dropped out in S.S. 3.\n\nHow was your stay at the Academy in Calabar?\n\nIt was very brief and I returned to the Synagogue of All Nations. I am an Altar boy. The man of God, Senior Prophet T.B Joshua took an exceptional liking for me and offered to help me.\n\nTell us about your family?\n\nMy mother and father got separated when I was still a very small boy but unfortunately my mother is late now. She died when I was still very young. We are nine in number and I am the seventh child in the family of which five are boys and four are girls.\n\nHow many of your brothers play football?\n\nAll of us, except my elder brother who the man of God, Prophet T.B Joshua is sponsoring in school. Although none of them has attained the level God has taken me to, I still have one of my brothers who is a goalkeeper and he is presently with My People FC and the rest are staying with my father in Abuja.\n\nWhat is your father’s occupation?\n\nMy father is a tailor and we were struggling to survive. You won’t believe it that we hardly fed every day. We lived in a deplorable place in Maraba in Abuja. My father does his tailoring business in a small hut in the front of our house where he puts his sewing machine every day. I never attended Primary School in my life and it was when I went to Calabar that they put me in school. So I never enjoyed any basic education like my fortunate colleagues. Prophet T.B Joshua is today catering for my family.\n\nYou were described as a super-substitute, how do you feel about this?\n\nGod was very faithful to me and each time I was introduced into a match I always had the conviction that I would score.\n\nYour predecessors, the 2007 Golden Eaglets won the FIFA U- 17 World Cup in Korea and were rewarded with houses and national honours. What will you wish to be honoured with, even though you only managed to win silver.\n\nI can’t begin to mention. Before I came to the U-17 National team like I earlier said I am from a very poor family. But thank God today, He has used the nation (Nigeria) to bless me. I will continue to be very grateful for getting the opportunity to play in the U- 17 National team.\n\nIf you are rewarded with 100 million naira for winning the U- 17 World Cup, what will you do with the money?\n\nFirstly, I will go to the orphanage and donate a substantial sum out of the money because I passed through a lot of difficulties growing up as a child. I couldn’t feed and I could not go to school because my father could not afford my school fees and I have always prayed and wished that one day I could touch the lives of the less privileged ones.\n\nHave you been contacted by any agent for a foreign deal?\n\nProphet Joshua had earlier sponsored me to Europe for trials. I was in Sweden for four months before I came back to join the national U-17. I have always wished for a football career in Europe and I belief now that I have distinguished myself in the U- 17 national team, offers will start coming to begin a soccer career in Europe.\n\nWhich Coach has had the biggest influence on your football career?\n\nAll the coaches I have played under.\n\nWhat is your greatest regret and who did you missed the most that you would have loved to share this moment of joy with you?\n\nMy regret is that my mother is not alive to see what I have turned to be in life.\n\nWhat is your best meal?\n\nRice and stew.\n\nWhat are your favourite cars?\n\nI am not a car freak and it has never crossed my mind to own a car anyway.\n\nThank you for talking to us.\n\nThe pleasure is mine, sir.\n\nSOURCE: Complete Sports\n\nRead Full Post »\n\nAnother touching account of the charitable works in The SCOAN…\n\nThe story of Job in the holy book sounded like a fairy tale to Mr Ezekiel Ayodeji until the cruel hands of nature and man unleashed deadly blows on him in quick succession recently. Within two weeks he lost his wife to typhoid fever, his shop that was full of goods he had just purchased to fire and duped of the sum of N240, 000 by a close friend.\n\nThe physically challenged indigene of Ondo State had lived up to his dream of not being liability to anybody by acquiring skills in rewinding coils. In Year 2000, he married a fellow artisan, Medinat Omokeinde. Within five year of marriage, the family was blessed with three children. His business was also thriving. Consequently, he said they lived a life of paradise on earth.\n\nFilled with the joy of having a peaceful home and without any premonition of early exit of either of the couples to the world beyond, he averred that they drew out plans for projects they would execute over a period of time. But this was not to be as the wife fell ill along the line. She was diagnosed of typhoid fever and all effort by medical doctors to cure her of the sickness proved abortive.\n\nAccording to him, she passed on a few weeks after, precisely on June 5, 2009. With the sudden exit of his wife, Ayodeji’s life was shattered. The sorrow of losing his heartthrob barely 9 years after marrying her and the pain of becoming a single parent of three children shattered his whole existence.\n\nAs a strong adherent of traditional statutes, he observed 7-days confinement at home as a mark of respect for his beloved wife after the burial. As the end of the confinement period drew near, he braced himself up for a return to his business in order to have the wherewithal to cater for his three children and other pressing needs.\n\nSuddenly, another arrow was thrust into his heart when he got a call on his mobile phone informing him that the shop he just stocked with goods had been razed by fire. Having lost his wife and means of livelihood within a week, his every hope was instantly lost and committing suicide became the best option but for the love of his children.\n\nSpeaking with National Life in Lagos last Sunday, Ayodeji tearfully recounted how joy and contentment that defined his life gave way to sorrow and gloom. “As you can see, I am physically challenged. But I resolved never to be a burden to anybody in my life. To live up to that, I learnt electrical rewinding and thereafter, carved a niche for myself in the job. My dexterity drew many customers to me and as a result, I delved into selling electrical wiring parts. When I had made enough money that I was certain would empower me to cater for a family, I married my late wife Medinat. She was such a nice wife that brought me good luck. Because of my turn around in my fortune, we started making plans for the future of our children and ourselves. But the whole plan suffered a serious setback when my wife fell sick. I took her to the hospital and spent so much all to no avail. One day, I was asked to go and buy drugs for her but when I returned, they told me that she passed on. The news devastated me a great deal. I got her family informed of the development and got no resistance whatsoever from them in going ahead to bury her.\n\n“After the burial, I stayed back in the house for seven days as a sign of respect for her. When it was the seventh day, I heaved a sigh of relief that I would at least go back to my business to get money to feed my children. It was not long I thought about that that I received a call from my colleagues in the market that my shop had been razed by fire. When I heard the news, my whole life completely collapsed and various thoughts crossed my mind. Because I love my children so much I jettisoned all the unholy thought”.\n\nHis hope of living a meaning life again was rekindled when Governor Olusegun Mimiko visited the scene of the fire incident and promised to give financial relief to all the victims. What that, smile returned to his face. He then relied on a close friend who was saddled with the responsibility of giving details of each victim’s business financial worth to collect the governor’s monetary promise for him.\n\nEven though, the governor made good his promise by approving the sum of N250, 000 for Ayodeji, the story became the third sojourn into another life of sorrow. He narrated that his friend who was very much aware of his predicament, collected the money on his behalf but merely sent him a token sum of N10, 000 and bolted with the remaining.\n\nConfused over what could have informed his friend’s inhuman action, Ayodeji explained how all efforts he made to retrieve the money from his friend proved abortive.\n\n“I am very surprised by my friend’s action. He was put in charge of giving the government details of our loss to the inferno but after collecting N250, 000 on my behalf, he only sent N10, 000 to me and ran away with the balance. This is a person who was duly informed of my pitiable plight but still went ahead to confiscate the money that the governor approved for me to start up after the fire incident that razed my shop. I called him severally but he would not act accordingly. At a stage, he stopped taking my calls. I went and reported him to the Commissioner for Environment but all efforts to get him to return the money falied”.\n\nLeft with no money to make both ends meet, Ayodeji said he had his children sent out of school while his landlord threatened to eject him for unpaid rent. To save his children, from pangs of hunger, he stated that he had to take to the street to beg neighbours and privileged members of his community for help. “When I didn’t have money to feed my children, I resorted to begging people for help. I bought food on credit for a period of time and such opportunities closed I started begging people around for both money and food”.\n\nNow a silver lining seems to have appeared at the end of his dark cloud. Besides being financial empowered, Ayodeji is now a proud owner of a Mercedes Benz and has fast forgotten his past. He explains to sudden turn around in his fortune to National Life.\n\n“I must confess to you that I was terribly weighed down by all those bitter experiences. One day, while ruminating on the way out of these problems, my mind went to Synagogue Church of All Nations. I had heard and seen how people who had problems were helped there. With faith, I went there and as God would have it, Prophet T.B Joshua revealed the whole problem in his prophecy.\n\n“Thereafter, he gave me the sum of N300, 000 to start my business all over and also gave me a Mercedes Benz. Somebody had presented him with the car, but he gave it to me and made provision for the maintenance. Now my children can go back to school and I can live a meaningful life again”.\n\nWritten by Innocent Duru\n\nSOURCE: National Life – VOL.2 NO. 68\n\nRead Full Post »"
