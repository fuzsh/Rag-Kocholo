        "text": "India Pakistan in New York on 9 June could well be a day game to ensure peak television viewership in the sub-continent. World T20 India Pakistan either on 8 June Saturday or mostly 9 June Sunday. To adjust timings to suit Television needs isn‚Äôt new. ICC isn‚Äôt doing anything radically different either. There is a long history of sports having to change their accepted timings to accommodate the demands of live television, especially when events are held in the Americas. As long ago as 1970, the marquee clash of the football World Cup in Mexico ‚Äì between England, defending champions, and Brazil, the eventual winners, kicked off at noon at the Estadio Jalisco in Guadalajara. A fortnight later, the final between Brazil and Italy in Mexico City also had a noon kick-off. In both cases, the scheduling, which led to multiple complaints from players and coaches, was done with a prime-time European TV audience in mind. Nearly a quarter-century later, when the USA hosted the World Cup, as many as 16 of the 36 group-stage matches and 11 of 16 of the knockout games kicked off before 2pm, in intense mid-day heat. Temperatures soared past 40C at some venues, and again, the TV audience in Europe and Asia was considered more important. Another football World Cup is set to be staged in the US, Mexico and Canada in 2026. In the wake of the tragic on-field deaths of Marc-Vivien Foe and others this century, it will be fascinating to see if player-welfare groups allow kick-offs at times when conditions are likely to be hazardous to player health.\n\nüåü Exploring Football: Entertainment versus Passion üåü Football ‚Äì a game that holds a unique place in our hearts, transcending mere entertainment to become a profound passion deeply intertwined with our cultural identity. ‚öΩ In many parts of the world, football serves as a form of entertainment, where fans gather to cheer on their favorite teams, reveling in the skill and excitement displayed on the field. However, in countries like Argentina, where I was born, football is more than just a game; it's a visceral passion that defines us. Here, football isn't merely a source of entertainment; it's an emotional journey, a rollercoaster of highs and lows that binds us together as a community. The sensations it evokes are raw and intense, reflecting the very essence of our national character. The idiosyncrasies of each country are reflected in the way football is embraced. In Argentina, the passion for football is unparalleled, with fans living and breathing every moment of the game. The sense of belonging to a team becomes inseparable from one's own identity, driving an unparalleled level of devotion and loyalty. But as I observe the landscape of football in Argentina, I can't help but notice a shift. The passion that once burned fiercely seems to be waning, threatened by various external forces. In contrast, in more developed countries, while the passion for football still exists, it's often tempered with a sense of detachment, allowing fans to enjoy the sport as a mere spectacle. Yet, it's this very passion that sets us apart, fueling the drive and determination of Argentine players who excel on the world stage. Our South American heritage instills in us a responsibility to keep the flame of passion alive, for it is what defines us and sets us apart in the global football community. In the end, football is more than just a game ‚Äì it's a reflection of who we are, a celebration of our shared experiences, and a testament to the enduring power of passion. Let's embrace it, nurture it, and keep the spirit of football alive for generations to come. ‚öΩüî• #FootballPassion #Argentina #SouthAmericanSpirit\n\nYou love confessions on LI right? Here's my riskiest and most defiant confession-like post ever. üëâ I don't need clients! üëà üôã‚ôÇÔ∏è Denmark won the Euro in 1992 against all odds. They shocked the footballing universe by lifting the 2nd most-coveted trophy in world football on national team level: UEFA's European Championship Cup What most people don't know is WHY/HOW this happened -- the secret behind a miracle. It happened because the Great Danes played a most stress-free and relaxed football. They partied. Played for fun. üëâ Had nothing to lose. ü§¶‚ôÇÔ∏è (Former) Yugoslavia were kicked out of Euro '92 and sent home 10 days before the tournament began. So Denmark qualified literally in the last minute. Danish players holidayed, frolicking on the sand with wives+kids, soaking up the sun and sipping Margaritas. Their federation pulled them off the beach in rush. Players reported for duty overnight, formed the 22-strong team, and travelled to Sweden. The myth began... ...and ended by beating the mega-Germans (World Cup Champions, 1990) in the final. Secret? Nothing at stake! They played so stress-free as if a fairy tale mermaid had touched their feet with a magic stick and stuck wings to them. Denmark was the most careless team. They need not play football. Did it for fun! And won. üëá Here comes my Denmark-related confession now: I want clients/leads here but don't need them. I'm here like the Danish players: got nothing to lose. ü•± $$$ promises and 3x leads and overnight growth abound on Linkedin. If you notice, nearly ALL service providers are vying for clients. I'm not. Because I play football (a.k.a. write) for self-expression first and then for business. And this is a massive Denmark-like differentiator, my friend. I confess I did get stressed at some point but bounced back as soon as I looked inside me and figured out my 'whys'. I now play football (write) like Denmark. You see, I don't really 'need' LI or clients to live off. üôè Thank God for that. If LI goes down, I won't. This now gives me an advantage: I exercise my skillset for fun in order to lift the...Euro. This makes me the üòâ best choice for some clients because I play (write) like Denmark, who beat the favourites -- the detail-obsessed and meticulous Germans. üëá Denmark had nothing to lose, just like me. But the Germans, with an organised 2-year prep prior to the Euro '92 lost it all in the final. The Germans are all of you who try day and night to attract leads/clients on LI, with fake or unfeasible promises that lead many newbies to desperation. Fortunately there are quite many trustworthy professionals. But the Danish players (skillful, talented, and highly competent) are all of you who post on LI for fun, self-expression, and love for words. Because you do it for 'free'. For fun. For love. This is the Danish way of winning: not needy/greedy. But (care) free. üòâ\n\nIt's very complicated for a person to reflectively encompass their entire life. For this reason, certain events are established to which one can relate. The same is true in the life of a football club. People have decided that trophies, anniversaries, tough moments, and so forth are important. The principle of counting your years from year to year governs our memories more powerfully than anything else. I believe that the most important indicator for celebrating a football club is the number of matches played. There is a strange tendency to focus exclusively on a person's money, just as there is to relate to a club only through its trophies. This is so dangerous and limited that I believe if you are of this mindset, you belong to the category of those capable of seeing football from different angles. For example, in the match against Farul, Rapid played its 2,000th match in the top league. From the first season in the top league in 1932-1933 with Ripensia to the match with the Constanta team, Rapid, in its various forms, has accumulated 2,000 matches. In the pursuit of trophies, this impressive number of Rapid's matches in the top league marks an undeniable tradition. In the shadow of football time, the white-maroon color represents an energy capable of regeneration season after season. For 100 years, Rapid has managed to face opponents, build stories off the field, and more importantly, carry the tradition forward. Football is an animal that never stops. It demands matches even when you are weakened, tests you at the end of each week, constantly punishes you, and when you are at your best, time passes the easiest. Rapid has delighted us in 2,000 matches on the main stage and many others through the trenches of Romanian football. For Western culture, entering the year 2000 was an important milestone to celebrate the entrance into the third millennium. For Rapid, the 2,000th match is the statistical confirmation of hopes, pains, and, above all, joys.\n\nü§î Is sport all about winning at any cost, or is the way you play and entertain also important? ü§î During the conclusion of the Performance Coaching Minor with Janneke Wikkerink, Kelly Cummins-Smith, Drs. Nicole Ebben, and Tim Rademakers, this question came up, especially with the Euros and Wimbledon in full swing. The question still lingers in my mind, leading me to discuss it further with Bastiaan Riemersma tonight. Three observations: France reached the finals in three of the last four major tournaments and even became world champions in 2018. They are again among the top four football nations in Europe. Yet, in France, there is widespread criticism of their play, which is considered boring. Novak Djokovic played in 36 Grand Slam finals, winning 24 of them, including seven Wimbledon titles. However, he was booed by the British crowd during his last match at Wimbledon. The Netherlands reached the semi-finals of the Euros for the first time in 20 years. However, this is not enough to generate only positivity among our 17 million national coaches. This brings to mind two quotes: The first is from Juanma Lillo, an inspiration to Pep Guardiola, who said something like: \"People don't come into the stadium in the 89th minute just to see the result. They come because they want to be moved and entertained during those 90 minutes of football.\" The other quote contrasts sharply with the first. Many great coaches believe that the number of trophies you win is all that matters. For example, Didier Deschamps, the current coach of France, who led the team to the World Cup victory in 2018. Deschamps responded to the current criticism from his fellow countrymen with something like: \"Results are sacred. That is all that matters. And if you don't like the way we play, then turn off your TV.\" So, what do you think? Is sport only about winning, or does the way you play and the level of entertainment also matter?\n\nThe England football team frequently faces a storm of negativity, fueled by high expectations, historical disappointments, and relentless media scrutiny. As the birthplace of modern football and home to the prestigious Premier League, England is expected to excel internationally. However, the team's lone World Cup win in 1966 looms large, with each subsequent failure intensifying the disappointment. The British media contributes significantly to this negativity. Intense scrutiny of players, coaches, and strategies means successes are fleetingly celebrated, while failures are dissected and criticized extensively. Off-field issues often overshadow on-field performances, creating a toxic environment that hampers morale. Cultural factors also play a role. England's traditional football style, often seen as rigid compared to the innovative approaches of other nations, frustrates fans and pundits alike. This resistance to change adds to the sense of discontent when the team underperforms. Social media exacerbates these issues, providing a platform for extreme reactions. Platforms like Twitter amplify both praise and vitriol, entrenching negative discourse. Despite these challenges, recent successes under Gareth Southgate show promise. Progress in tournaments like the 2018 World Cup and Euro 2020 suggests that with balanced expectations and constructive support, the England team can rise above the negativity and achieve sustained success. Now if you've got this far put your thoughts in the comments below. Come on England...\n\nAFC Ajax today announce the signing of Jordan Henderson from Al Ettifaq, the former Liverpool player departs 'by mutal agreement' only 6 months into a three year agreement that cost the Saudi club, which is managed by Henderson friend, Stephen Gerrard, a fee of ¬£12m (Transfermarkt). The England midfielder was earning a reported a tax free '¬£700,000 per week' at an age of 33 when many players are considering retirement and will take a reported \"65% pay cut\" by returning according to Ben Jacobs of Talksport today. So what are the reasons? Attendances in the Saudi Pro League are very low, the average in the first half the season is quoted as 1,000 by analysis by Al Jazeera. In recent weeks attendances of these first tier games were: Al Riyadh v Al Khaleej 144 Abha Club v Al Hazm 257 Al Wehda v Al Khaleej 457 Al Feiha v Al Ettifaq 657 In a country with a population of 35m. Especially for European athletes the weather is an issue, currently 25o, the weather can get up to 48o between June and September, with humidity averaging 29%, but going up to 70%. Of course the country is also a dry state, which means alcohol is not served, which is an unaccustomed restraint. Although Jordan Henderson is reported by The Athletic to live in Bahrain, like some other international players, which does permit the sale of alcohol. Former Manchester City defender, now of Al Nassr, Aymeric Laporte recently speaking to Adriana Garcia of ESPN spoke of 'broken agreements' and 'problematic working conditions' and spoke of his wish to 'return': https://lnkd.in/edh4Es_P Roberto Firmino, and Karim Benzema are also reported today by The Daily Mail to be wanting to follow Henderson. Recent transfers out of the league have seen former Inter Argentina international Ever Banega leave Al Shabab for Newell Old Boys (Argentina), former Udinese Brazil international centreback Naldo depart Al Tawooun for Antalyaspor (Turkey), former Blackburn Rovers Swedish winger Moudou Barrow leave Al Alhli for Sivaspor (Turkey), former Lazio centreback, Angola international Bastos leave for Botafogo (Brazil), and Spain international winger Juanmi has left Al Riyadh for Real Betis. Not massive names yet but there is a trend. The Turkish Super League cup, which was scheduled to take place in Saudi in December was cancelled due to reported \"disagreements with the local federation\". With the Euros coming up in the summer, players are also concerned about visibility playing in the nascent league. Over $1bn was invested in players by Saudi clubs this season, so what is the plan for the league? This piece by CNN's Amy Woodyatt, Krystina Shveda and Antonio Jarne Cubero is insightful in explaining the motivations and plans: https://lnkd.in/eSUTAQ65 Could the issue of increasing political instability in the Red Sea region, and Yemen which borders Saudi, disrupt the Gulf state's plans? And is the Henderson transfer the start of a bigger Saudi league 'brain drain'? #benmcfadyean"
