        "text": "The praise was Nigeria’s but the prize was Switzerland’s. Hot on the heels of the Under-20 World Cup in Egypt and sandwiched between that and the real thing next summer, the Under-17 World Cup 2009 has now drawn to a close in Nigeria. FIFA President Sepp Blatter, taking a moment out of his busy days spent working out how to most ‘effectively’ seed World Cup draws, praised Nigeria for a “successful and well-organised competition” in which the participating teams “all expressed their satisfaction” at the warm hospitality of their hosts. A relief for the country at large, who were forced to put up with all the doubts and negativity and patronising votes of confidence right until the first games kicked off in Abuja.\n\nAs ever, the U-17 World Cup offers a great opportunity to get an early heads-up on the stars of tomorrow. You need only look at standout performers from previous competitions to realise that. Young men voted the best players of the last three tournaments before this one go by the names of Toni Kroos, Anderson and Cesc Fabregas. All three have used success at U-17 level as a springboard to brighter things, so the tournament’s role as useful window into the future is undeniable.\n\nSo as Switzerland etch their name into the competition’s history with their first ever trophy at this or indeed any level, which young players look destined to carve their names most memorably into football’s future? Here are Just-Football.com’s 7 best players of the tournament:\n\n1, Stanley Okoro (Nigeria)\n\nAs far as I’m concerned Stanley Okoro was the best player of the tournament in Nigeria and it was a big surprise not to see his name on the list when individual honours were handed out. Already vastly influential for his club Heartland FC in Nigeria, Okoro defined the word ‘talisman’ in this competition. When he played the Golden Eaglets ticked, and at times the mantra ‘if in doubt, pass to Stanley’ seemed to be the order of the day for Nigeria.\n\nMost of the time it worked too as Okoro’s pace, dynamism, direct running and immense drive powered the team relentlessly on. 3 goals and 5 assists in 7 games tells the tale. No matter what Spain tried in the semi-finals they absolutely couldn’t handle him and in the final there was a telling moment when, having been skinned by Okoro down the wing only for the move to break down, Swiss defender Bruno Martignoni looked around desperately at his teammates as if to say ‘come on guys, help me out here.’\n\nOkoro is a modern forward in the sense that he can play either as striker, winger or attacking midfielder. Such technical versatility, alongside his superb dribbling skills, will doubtless see Stanley Okoro leaving Heartland FC before long.\n\n2, Iker Muniain (Spain)\n\n“Football only has one language,” says Athletic Bilbao veteran Joseba Exteberria, “and Iker Muniain has mastered it. If he continues along this path I believe he will become a world class player.” The faith Exteberria has in his fellow Basque teammate certainly doesn’t appear misplaced. Iker Muniain looks the real deal.\n\nA rising star in the Athletic Bilbao first team, Muniain is breaking records left, right and centre for the Basque giants. First he became the youngest player ever to play for Bilbao, then the youngest to score for the club, then the youngest player to play for Bilbao in a league game. On October 4th 2009 Muniain then broke another record when, at just 16 years and 289 days, he became the youngest player to ever score in a La Liga match, bagging a goal against Real Valladolid.\n\nIn Nigeria, Muniain’s influence was obvious. The “Basque Messi” was the first port of call for many of his teammates, the standout player in a team of technically impressive talents, and they sought to give the ball to the winger-cum-forward wherever possible. It was a shame to see him limp off in the semis against Nigeria. Spain were already under the cosh, but their fleeting hopes faded for good the second Muniain left the field. Boasting an explosive burst of pace and a delicate touch, Iker Muniain was one of the tournament’s stars.\n\n3, Nassim Ben-Khalifa (Switzerland)\n\nFour goals and three assists in seven games secured Nassim Ben-Khalifa the Silver Ball award for second best player of the tournament in Nigeria, and the Grasshopper Zurich youngster was worthy of his award. Defences regularly struggled to cope with his dynamic, attacking play for Switzerland and together with striker partner Haris Seferovic the pair shot the Swiss to U-17 World Cup glory.\n\nOne of the most striking of Ben-Khalifa’s many attributes on the pitch has to be his composure. For one so young it was thrilling to see how calm the 17-year-old kept in pressure situations throughout the tournament, and in the box this cool manner paid dividends. Perhaps it explains why he’s already playing in Grasshopper’s first team. His abilities on the ball are also hugely impressive. Initially of Tunisian origin, Ben-Khalifa was born in Switzerland and has represented his country at youth level from U-15s up. It seems only a matter of time before he makes the step up to Under-20 and eventually full international level.\n\n4, Sani Emmanuel (Nigeria)\n\n16-year-old Nigerian Sani Emmanuel must have one of the best goals per minute ratios in FIFA tournament history after his exploits for the Golden Eaglets here. The striker consistently came off the bench to score, but couldn’t force his way into the starting lineup until Omoh Ojabu’s injury finally saw Emmanuel thrust into the first team, for the final. Where, predictably, he failed to score. Nevertheless, 5 goals in 221 minutes playing time amounts to a goal every 44.2 minutes – a superb scoring record that saw the My People FC frontman named Golden Ball winner for the player of the tournament.\n\nDiminuitive yet solidly built, there was an odd ‘scorned son trying to impress ultra demanding father’ narrative going on between Emmanuel and Nigeria Under-17 coach John Obuh during the competition, which explains Emmanuel’s role as perennial supersub. During the final Obuh was constantly barking orders at the young striker and after one glorious chance went begging at his feet the manager pillared Emmanuel relentlessly, pointing at the bench angrily as if to say ‘this is where you’ll end up if you waste any more chances.’ He was then taken off in the second half.\n\nWhether this hints at a lack of tactical discipline on Emmanuel’s part breeding mistrust in the manager, isn’t clear. But the evidence on the pitch shows the young striker as a real handful for defenders. Quick, opportunistic in front of goal and a good finisher, Emmanuel played the role of team secret weapon to perfection.\n\n5, Haris Seferovic (Switzerland)\n\nScorer of five goals in Nigeria including the winner against the hosts in the final, Haris Seferovic is a striker with the type of killer instinct that terrifies defenders. Originally of Bosnian heritage, Seferovic names Zlatan Ibrahimovic (also from a Bosnian background) as his biggest influence and it is clear to see that the Grasshopper Zurich youngster models his game on that of the FC Barcelona frontman.\n\nSeferovic has something of the Alan Shearer about him. Direct and strong, the Swiss youngster is a number 9 in the traditional sense. He likes to play off the shoulders of defenders, makes intelligent runs in behind his man and when a chance comes his way he is clinical. At 6.1ft Seferovic also poses an aerial threat, as Nigeria learnt to their dismay in the final. Haris Seferovic is already playing in the first team at Grasshoppers having made his debut last season. The 17-year old has a promising future.\n\n6, Marc Muniesa (Spain)\n\nA product of FC Barcelona’s thriving La Masia youth academy, Marc Muniesa is a 17-year-old defender considered by sources within the club to be the heir apparent to club captain Carles Puyol. Both strong and athletic, Muniesa can play either at centre defence or left back and has already made his first-team debut for the European champions, appearing as a substitute against Osasuna back in May. It didn’t go too well for Muniesa however. He was sent off.\n\nThat didn’t deter Pep Guardiola though and Muniesa found himself on the bench for the Champions League final a week later. A natural defender, the youngster from Lloret de Mar has a good left foot and loves to throw himself into tackles. In Nigeria Muniesa looked determined and assured at the back, though another sending off against Uruguay means he might have to work on the not getting sent off part of his game. Still, with the full backing of the club’s hierarchy and provided they can ward off persist interest from Chelsea, Marc Muniesa should be appearing more regularly at the Camp Nou pretty soon.\n\n7, Sebastian Gallegos (Uruguay)\n\nUruguay have a promising young generation of talent coming through the ranks at the moment with players like Nicolas Lodeiro, Jonathan Urretaviscaya and Sebastien Coates all impressing. Add to that list now Sebastian Gallegos. A left back turned winger who can also operate as a number 10, Gallegos was an integral part of the Uruguay U-17 team in Nigeria, dazzling with his authoritative style, deft touch and powerful left foot.\n\nGallegos scored five goals in Nigeria and was awarded the Bronze Shoe for his efforts. Signed by Atletico Madrid for a fee rumoured to be around €7 million euros in the summer, Gallegos has a big reputation already at youth level and lived up to it proudly with his exploits for the junior Celeste. His goal against Algeria and his second of two against Iran in the last 16 were magical testaments of his creative qualities. Two footed, crafty and an incisive passer to boot, Atletico look to have signed a top class player in the making.\n\nWhat do you think? Anyone you believe should have been included?
