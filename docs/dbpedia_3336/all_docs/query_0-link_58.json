        "text": "Aside the significant sermon are works of prophecy, charity and moving testimonies by worshippers at the church from the world over among which were the following:\n\nHENRY CHUKWU ONYEAMA – EXPERIENCED VISA BREAKTHROUGH THROUGH ANOINTING WATER\n\nThe Enugu state born Nigerian businessman had experienced poverty, dejection and stagnation in his life for years. He even sold some of his personal belongings such as cars, television and even the mattress he slept on, just to recover from the stroke of economic uncertainty. But he soon laid hands on the Anointing Water as an avid viewer of Emmanuel TV with which he prayed and ministered and after six days, was invited into a business which instantly fetched him one million naira in profits. Stung by the quest to further his education, he had applied for admission in Ukraine but at the Nigerian Embassy, he was denied a visa.\n\nHe also attempted to go to South Africa to accomplish his dream but this hit the rock. He then wrote to ask for an invitation by a business concern in South Korea, ministering the Anointing Water on his documents.\n\nAfter four days, contrary to the normal practice, he had gone for an interview at the Korean Embassy and was successful.\n\nWith his visa at the ready, he hopes to leave Nigeria for Korea in a few days. He advised that in every situation, people should look up to God and that the Anointing Water should be seen and appreciated as a special gift from God for this generation of believers.\n\nFELICIA NGWUTA – DELIVERED FROM EVIL FORCES THROUGH ANOINTING WATER\n\nMrs Ngwuta told the congregation in church how God dealt with evil forces plaguing her peace in her own home. She said she used to experience visits of snakes in her dreams. Her well kept money in her wardrobe was always getting lost and there was a time she was even shot an in the dream. She was so tormented and has to visit The SCOAN, during which she ministered on herself and the entire house.\n\nShe was surprised to later discover a dead snake in her wardrobe even when there was no outlet through which it could have come in.\n\nDisplaying the photograph of the decayed snake, which did not smell inside her wardrobe, she said since then, her money has stopped getting lost and she has not experienced any bad dreams. Cheerfully, she implored people to go to God to solve the riddles of their lives because solutions lie only with Him.\n\nHEALED OF STROKE THROUGH THE ANOINTING WATER\n\nThis oil businessman had experienced a devastating stroke but was triumphantly restored to health through the Anointing Water. When under the affliction, he had journeyed to The SCOAN from the Republic of Benin on 4th October, 2012. His vessel was expected to go for inspection but his health mattered more to him. He had visited different hospitals that had rejected him as he could neither stand nor talk. The stroke had affected him physically to the degree that part of his mouth was bent owing to the affected muscles on his face and mentally, when his wife and family visited him, he did not recognize their presence for four days. His wife prayed for him using the Anointing Water and in the name of the God of Prophet T.B. Joshua, and he recovered the use of his hands; his bent mouth was restored and he could speak once again. The doctors later confirmed him medically fit, for which he showed his medical report as evidence. An astonishing revelation came when, during his testimony, he admitted he knew he was lucky to survive as his elder sister who similarly suffered a stroke attack three months after his, had died. Finally, he concluded with the word of advice that the Anointing Water had become his spiritual battleaxe and weapon of war. Full of joy, his wife testified that the Anointing Water shows that God is ultimate in power and that people should trust in God and run to Him, when faced by challenges beyond their control.\n\nANTHONY AGUNU – SAVED FROM A GRUESOME ROAD ACCIDENT THROUGH ANOINTING WATER\n\nMr Agunu based in the Republic of South Africa, decided to visit his home in Nigeria in December of 2012 but not without first visiting The SCOAN on 27th December where he was privileged to receive the Anointing Water .\n\nOn the 31st of December, he travelled to his home State of Delta but forgot to pray and minister the Anointing Water before embarking on the journey. During his trip, another car moving out of control at high speeds smashed into his own vehicle.\n\nAs they were shouting Jesus, they discovered that though the car was badly damaged beyond repair, neither Mr Agunu nor any of his passengers were injured. As he showed the picture of the crash scene, he thanked God and encouraged others not to toy with the idea of embracing and using the Anointing Water.\n\nMRS LUCKY EDWARD – DELIVERED FROM 32 YEARS OF SMOKING AND DRINKING THROUGH ANOINTING WATER\n\nShe said that she had smoked for some 32 years, 23 of which had actually driven her to smoke marijuana to stem the emotional pain she encountered in her marital home. The problem had started at the age of 17 when her schoolmates told her that in order to be cool she had to smoke and drink alcohol.\n\nShe explained that the friends were the most popular in her school and she desired to be seen like them, therefore she engaged in their addictive behaviours. Initially, she coughed and spluttered on the cigarette smoke but was told it was normal and as she took more, she would enjoy it the more. The addiction formed and she got to the level of being able to consume four packs of cigarettes every day. After marrying her husband and upon falling pregnant, her mind began to change and she wanted to drop the foul habit but found to her dismay that she was unable to.\n\nThen she began to move from churches to prayer houses to get delivered from the chain but without success until she was introduced to Emmanuel TV where she became convinced that the power of God in the Anointing Water was real.\n\nOn getting her own bottle of Anointing Water and ministering it to herself, she went to sleep. It was a week later that she realized that for the past week, she had not even the urge to smoke a cigarette or take a single drink since ministering the Anointing Water. Today, she is full of gratitude to God for her deliverance and advises that people should go to real men of God to solve their problems.\n\nMR GODFREY – SAVED FROM A TRAILER CRASH THROUGH THE ANOINTING WATER\n\nIn 2012, Mr Godfrey had visited the church and received two Anointing Stickers both of which he placed on his truck as a professional transporter. On one such long haul journey, Mr Godfrey saw in the distance that a tanker had had an accident blocking the adjacent lane for oncoming traffic.\n\nHis own lane however, being unobstructed thought little of it and continued to accelerate. Suddenly, with horrific speed, a large speeding lorry crossed into Mr Godfrey’s lane while trying to pass round the obstacle and collided with Mr Godfrey’s truck slamming the two vehicles into the already crashed tanker with such horrible force that the drivers section or head of the oncoming lorry was thrown into the air and across the street.\n\nThe conductor died on impact and the lorry driver was in a critical condition, but at the moment of impact, the Anointing Sticker Mr Godfrey kept on the shelf of his truck floated down to land over his chest and both he and his co-pilot came out of the valley of the shadow of death without a scratch. Without words to express his appreciation to the God of TB Joshua, he advised all that if God was with you, no weapon fashioned against you would prosper and that God’s protection was the only protection.\n\nMR AND MRS AMADIKE – HOTEL RESCUED FROM ATTACKERS THROUGH EMMANUEL TV\n\nThe middle aged couple run a popular hotel as a business outfit and in each of its guestrooms is installed the Emmanuel TV cable to allow all the visitors to view the wonders of God as they enjoyed their stay with them. In the dead of night, strange noises were heard throughout the hotel as unknown gunmen raided the hotel, breaking down doors in search of the proprietor, Mr and Mrs Amadike, to demand their money or their lives. The couple locked themselves inside their room and prayed with Prophet TB Joshua watching Emmanuel TV as the rampage continued. When the invaders could not find the couple, in the course of their fury, they broke one of the window panes of Mr Amadike’s car parked in the hotel forecourt. Instantly, the car alarm went off and confusion descended upon the raiders like a heavy blanket thinking security guards were upon them, they took to their heels only to be caught by patrolling policemen who took them into custody and seized their ammunition. The couple advised that Emmanuel TV was no ordinary station and people that stick to it as their channel of choice would surely reap the reward.\n\nMR AND MRS ROMANUS UDEAKU – DELIVERED FROM BARRENNESS THROUGH PROPHECY\n\nA couple came to testify of the irresistible power of prophecy, telling the worldwide audience that Prophet TB Joshua had prophesied to Mrs Udeaku that her underwear had once gone missing and since that time, she had suffered irregular menstruation which was the cause of the couples 16 years of infertility.\n\nThe couple had gotten to the point of desperation that they were considering adopting a child but two weeks after confirming the prophecy of the man of God to be true, Mrs Udeaku conceived and has since delivered a beautiful girl named Precious.\n\nMr Romanus Udeaku said that at the age of 53 this was his first child even though it was not his first marriage and he had faced the same problem in his first step in life. With the soft smile of glorious vindication on their faces, the couple simply said if you want God to do the same for you, just believe Him through ordinary circumstances. He is not a man that disappoints.\n\nTWO ZAMBIAN PILGRIMS REWARDED FOR THEIR FAITH\n\nAnother chapter of testimony closed in the annals of history as two pilgrims who braved the danger of travelling by road to The SCOAN in Nigeria from Zambia in Southern Africa, a journey taking them 44 days to complete, stood before the congregation with the happy faces and hearts of those whom the Lord has located in His mercy and favour. The men recounted their experience of the bitter trials they faced on the way to the church prompted by their financial hardship which had cast doubtful shadows over the furtherance of their education with all their efforts hitting nothing but the rocks of frustration. Spurred on by their keen interest for the works of charity performed on Emmanuel TV, the friends stirred with radical faith, departed on their mission passing through seven countries including CAR, Tanzania, Kenya, Mali, South Sudan and Nigeria. In a nutshell, the hazards of their journey had taken their toll surviving on bread and water where it was available, encountering hostile natives, rough border checkpoints, wild animal attacks and insensitive bystanders but through they were silent in their trouble, they did not silence their faith and hope and by God’s grace, they made it to The SCOAN. Prophet TB Joshua remarked concerning the determined duo that he was touched by their faith and on behalf of the ministry and Emmanuel TV Partners gave them each 2000 USD; flight tickets back to Zambia and his promise to support their educational pursuits. The men who made a journey of 44 days would return home in just one spoke to youth all over the world that once they had made a heart decision, they should be determined concerning their future and the sky would be their limits.\n\nMR ALEX ALABA AND HIS SIX CHILDREN\n\nMr Alex and his children were given the sum of half a million naira to support their upkeep and education as they went back to continue their lives in the peace and comfort of reconciliation in Christ Jesus. The man of God declared that each of the children would be awarded scholarships and were to decide if they would move to live with their father or stay with the family who had raised them thus far.\n\nHowever, the former Pastor Alaba was advised to return to his career of driving and remove the title Pastor from his name for the time being unless God Almighty spoke again on the contrary.\n\nPersonally thanking each of the guardians of Mr Alaba’s children, Prophet TB Joshua said he would see each of them in his office to discuss the future and give a special blessing for their love, care and understanding shown in this unusual situation.\n\nAn extraordinary end to an extraordinary situation, God Almighty has once again proved that nothing is impossible to those who believe and sending the families on their way the man of God gave each person three bags of rice.\n\nTHE OBASI FAMILY DELIVERANCE AND RESTORATION\n\nMrs Shelly Obasi and her family, who had been delivered from the destructive use of demonic entities which had given them evil power to seduce, destroy and steal from those who had not learnt to walk in the Spirit in Christ Jesus.\n\nThe mother and daughter, Princess who had both manifested during previous services at The SCOAN and were delivered from the hands of the devil testified of how the peace of God had enveloped their hearts and now their desire was to return to South Africa, the children to continue in their education, and their mother, Shelly, to return to her business, grateful for the freedom they had received in the name of Jesus Christ. After providing flight tickets for the family of five, the man of God TB Joshua also gave the family N600,000 to launch them into their new lives. The tearful, quivering voice of Princess Obasi thanked the man of God and Emmanuel TV Partners on behalf of the family.\n\nMRS LENA OFOSU – AN UNNERVING ACCOUNT OF THE REALITY BEING A WIFE TO A MARINE SPIRIT\n\nMrs Lena Ofosu, stood before the congregation while a cassette was played documenting how the Emmanuel TV Team accompanied her on her return to her shrine in Ghana where she had practiced as a wife to a spiritual husband, spiritualist and queen mother in the marine kingdom. Now, delivered from the spiritual husband that had plagued her life since birth, Mrs Ofosu exposed the kingdom of the devil and the many ritual practices she had been involved in since the age of 14.\n\nShe described and demonstrated the way she was taught to serve her spiritual husband and recounted the disturbing visits and their destructive effects on her life and marriages causing death, poverty, failure and immorality. Then, Lena Ofosu went on to divulge the secrets of the spiritualists and their demonic influence on society, her having been released from their dark tentacles.\n\nThe Goliath in her life had truly been defeated and disgraced by the light of Jesus Christ and she told the congregation not to doubt what they saw in The SCOAN because it was real; she was a real agent of darkness and had done so much damage. Therefore, others should learn now to maintain a strong relationship with God and never let Him go.\n\nINDONESIA AND CURRENT PROPHESIES\n\nThe man of God, Prophet TB Joshua then reminded the worldwide congregation of some of his recent prophecies, some of which had recently come to pass including the horrendous flooding in Indonesia and the reiteration of some of his prophesied made on New Year’s Day and a few new prophecies to the nations of France, Germany, Nigeria and the United States of America, further details of which would soon show on Emmanuel TV as the events came closer.\n\nThe man of God reminded all and sundry that prophecy was to expose the intrigues, plan and strategy of the devil and stop them by coming together to pray. Clearly, the response of a humble believing soul is to take the Word from the mouth of the Lord and commit it to God in prayer for His favour and mercy. He, who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit is saying to the churches.\n\nRelated articles\n\nLeg Ulcer Healed At SCOAN London – TB Joshua\n\nHealed of Barrenness for Five Years Through the Anointing Water -tb Joshua\n\nTESTIMONY TIME @ SCOAN LONDON – 13th JANUARY, 2013\n\nSpirit of Death – Exposed and Expelled – Tb Joshua\n\nLifted From the Depths – a Testimony From the Heart\n\nI Now Enjoy Kissing My Wife – Tb Joshua Testimony\n\nNo Bullet Touched Me!!! – Tb Joshua Testimony\n\nThe Thief Threw My Handbag Back!!! TB Joshua Testimony\n\nWife Was Healed of a Mental Disorder Through the Anointing Water – Tb Joshua\n\nThree testimonies in one through the Anointing Water from TB Joshua\n\nProphet T.B. Joshua opened the Sunday sermon with a word of encouragement for the nation of Nigeria and the world at large. Citing the example of current events around the world, he opened the book of Daniel 3:16 and stated that we, people of God we do not defend ourselves because we have a Defender. This is what three Hebrew men, Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego said in response to King Nebuchadnezzar.\n\nThe prophet stated that the lives of believers in both the Old Testament and New Testament testify that being faithful to God does not eliminate adversity but may actually be a sign of being faithful to God. He then urged the congregation not to use the weapon of the enemy to defend themselves but realise that when our faith is tested, our endurance has a chance to grow.\n\nThe mother explained that her daughter used to be very brilliant and the best in her class but when this problem began, she starting having a dull brain and her classmates were now far ahead of her in school. Prophet T.B. Joshua instructed the mother to pray for her in Jesus’ name. Prophet T.B. Joshua instructed the mother to pray for her in Jesus’ name. There was no movement, no shaking, nothing to indicate that deliverance was going on but after the prayer, Prophet T.B. Joshua declared her free. He then asked her to eat her hair and she almost vomited it onto the floor saying it was no longer ‘sweet tasting’ in her mouth.\n\nMrs Obiageli testifed that after receiving the Anointing Water and praying with it, she was promoted to Director of the NYSC (National Youth\n\nService Council).\n\nHon. Tebite from Ughelli, Delta, Nigeria alongside his colleagues gave a testimony of how he contested and won the election as the House of Assembly Leader in Delta after praying with the Anointing Water.\n\nMr & Mrs Obuari Goodhead, with child in hand, described how they had suffered from barrenness for 5 years but after administering the Anointing Water, their problem was over and they became pregnant with t\n\nICE CUBE AND MINT SWEETS ADDICTION A THING OF THE PAST\n\nIt has become a common occurrence at The SCOAN to hear testimonies from those that have been delivered from one addiction or another.\n\nThis Sunday, Marinela Simente, from Cameroon gave an astonishing testimony of deliverance from addiction to eating ice cubes and mint sweets. She told the congregation and the world watching on Emmanuel TV that before her deliverance, she only had an appetite for these items and as a result, suffered from anaemia. After watching Emmanuel TV and seeing the deliverance of others with the same type of problem, she decided to come down to The SCOAN herself for deliverance. Whilst giving her testimony, the video of her deliverance on the night of the candlelight service was played. During the candlelight service on the 31st December 2011, Prophet T.B. Joshua used the candle as the medium for deliverance. Holding the burning candle in reverence to God during the service, one of the visitors from South Africa came forward at the prophet’s request to pray for Marinela and deliver her from her addiction. At that name, Jesus Christ, she was freed from her bondage and no longer craved mint sweets or ice cubes.\n\nYOUNG GIRL DELIVERED BY OWN MOTHER FROM HAIR EATING ADDICTION\n\nRuth, a young girl from Nigeria and her mother came forward expressing a desire to be free from an addiction of eating her own hair.\n\nThe wise man reminded the congregation and viewers that God Almighty gives everyone plenty of evidence to believe Him and that we should therefore never doubt God’s desire or ability to help us. Using 2 Corinthians 12:7-10, he revealed that even though Paul’s challenges were so great, the apostle knew that the thorns in his flesh were to keep him from becoming proud or conceited. He saw his challenges as a reason for believing God just as he saw his good times as a reason for believing God. He was encouraged that God loved him enough to correct him. Wise Man Daniel then encouraged us to see our own challenges as a way of God correcting us, remembering that our situation is not like others’. Others’ challenges are meant to destroy them but ours, as Christians are meant for the glory of God. He concluded by reminding all that in our spiritual walk with the Lord, there are good and hard times alike. In both good and hard times alike, Jesus Christ must be honoured.\n\nLOVE IN ACTION\n\nWhen it comes to giving, Prophet T.B. Joshua says that it is more blessed to give than to receive. During this holiday season and throughout the year, he encourages the viewers and partners of Emmanuel TV to look around and see those that are in need. He leads by example not only by instructing others to give but by showing them how to give in sincerity, simplicity and cheerfulness.\n\nIn response to his example, many Emmanuel TV Partners were challenged to go and do the same in their own countries. One of them, Mrs Christaline from Namibia gave account of how she was able to set up a charity feeding 450 orphan children and how she planned to build a centre to care for 1,500 orphans around the nation, taking care of their accommodation, feeding, health and schooling. While she was speaking, the video footage of her acts of giving was shown.\n\nThe video showed a trailer of maize meal being unloaded and distributed among the crowd and brand new wheelchairs being unpacked and presented to many physically challenged. The joy and smiles on their faces that followed were enough of a blessing for the gift that was given.\n\nThe final person to tell her story was Mrs Josephine from Namibia, founder of the Mount Sinai Centre, an centre for children afflicted by HIV, reporting to the viewers that she had indeed handed over the centre to the prophet and was now receiving a salary from the man of God to care for the HIV positive mothers and children.\n\nIn the short span of a few weeks, Prophet T.B. Joshua had donated to her organisation $50,000 which was providing life-saving supplies for hundreds in Namibia. At the close of the service, the prophet gave $10,000 to each of the three charity founders to assist them in their work and promised to send the same amount each week to support the children and needy individuals they were caring for.\n\nAnother video was played for the congregation and the viewers of Emmanuel TV showing a news report on giving in the United States. Emmanuel TV Partners and representatives in the USA, with donations sent by T.B. Joshua, visited and presented much needed supplies and a cash gift to a family resource centre caring for children with special needs in Kennewick, Washington, USA. A national news station, NBC, was present at the centre to do a live report, commenting that the roles had been reversed and that this time, a church in Africa were supporting the USA.\n\nThe service drew to a close as Prophet T.B. Joshua led the congregation and viewers worldwide in powerful prayer, inspiring them to dream again. These were his words: “I don’t care where you are or how big a mess your life has been – begin to dream again! I prophesy to your life. God has positioned you in this New Year. God has positioned you for breakthrough in this New Year.\n\nGod has positioned you in this New Year for victory, for healing, in the name of Jesus! God has positioned you to achieve your destiny, in the name of Jesus! Your limitations are your opportunities! Your mess is your opportunity, in this New Year, in the name of Jesus. Dream again!”\n\n51.492659 -0.054239\n\nProphet T B Joshua of the Synagogue Church of All Nations in Nigeria needs no introduction; a man of God with immense gifts and abilities. Yet, considering the positive roles he is playing on the world stage, some people still harbor nefarious reasons to doubt or hate him. In 2009 alone, there was a wave of attacks on the man in the Synagogue from some of his counterparts in the vine yard and some others who have not even met him. Yet, God continues to use him greatly to set the captives free both nationally and internationally.\n\nHaving followed the defamatory commentaries of some of the so called Christian leaders in Nigeria and in some other African countries, I was able to know that the primary reason behind the false accusations against this anointed man of God is simply to create a sense of confusion and fear in the minds of the masses and their innocent followers in order to keep them away from flocking to the Synagogue Church of All Nations for deliverance. These Christian groups appear to have abandoned the basic biblical rules and developed a modern day thug-like instinct of ‘do or die sermons’ against Prophet TB Joshua whom they regard as a threat to their parishes.\n\nThese gangs work in collaboration with freelance agents, some news media and use of internet systems to spread false information and defame the person of Prophet TB Joshua. They say, ‘he is satanic, an occultist, a conman, we don’t know his mentor; we cannot associate ourselves with him’.\n\nFor once, I tend to agree with them for not associating themselves with him because it is clearly written that ‘Do not be yoked together with unbelievers. For what do righteousness and wickedness have in common? Or what fellowship can light have with darkness? 15What harmony is there between Christ and Believers? – 2 Corinthians 6:14-15\n\nThese groups of Christians are happy in appointing themselves as a judge over others and by so doing have trampled under feet one of the cardinal principles of the teachings of Jesus Christ in Matthew 7:1-3 which states, “Do not judge, or you too will be judged. 2For in the same way you judge others, you will be judged, and with the measure you use, it will be measured to you. 3“Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother’s eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye?\n\nIt is interesting to note that Jesus Christ was also accused by the religious leaders of his time for being a threat to their establishments. They rejected the son of God and accused him of being possessed by Beelzebub the prince of demons, Luke 11:14-36.\n\nIn the midst of all the falsehood, Prophet TB Joshua has maintained a dignified silence and continues to grow from strength to strength. In some of his statements, Prophet TB Joshua would say ‘love those that hate you and do not pay evil for evil’.\n\nIt is evidently clear over the years that his accusers have not been able to obtain the level of God’s achievements known in the life of Prophet TB Joshua. Probably they need to be informed that the Almighty God does not consult with mere mortals before He create, elect or anoint anyone to represent Him on earth. The example of God’s authority and wisdom is seen in the book of Jeremiah: “Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, before you were born I set you apart; I appointed you as a prophet to the nations.” Jeremiah 1:5\n\nIn conclusion, I feel rather sorry for his accusers, some having obtained good degree of academic education, some from well established backgrounds; whilst some are having good command of English language and power to pull large crowds, but here comes a humble Prophet TB Joshua who cannot boast of good education or let alone speak fluent English language, and God took delight in him.\n\nIf I were one of his accusers I would have petitioned God Almighty to know why He has chosen Prophet TB Joshua of the Synagogue Church of All Nations in Nigeria but not anyone of us.\n\nFurther, I have provided hand-full compilations of some of his ministries’ activities in 2009.\n\nSCOAN click here to visit the offical wesite\n\nEMMANUEL TV\n\n” Changing lives, changing nations and changing the world…”\n\nEmmanuel TV is dedicated to changing lives, changing nations and changing the world by spreading the Gospel of Jesus Christ through the powerful media of television and internet broadcasting. Our vision is to produce and air first class programmes that lead people of all ages, all backgrounds, all repute and all cultures to salvation.\n\nPROPHESY\n\nThe book of Amos 3:7 tells us that God does nothing without first revealing it to His servants. Therefore, a true prophet of God is a communicator between the visible and invisible world. Just as The Synagogue, Church Of All Nations is a ministry of all nations, so too, God continues to use Prophet T.B. Joshua as a mouthpiece to the nations. Numerous prophetic words of both national and global concern have been given by T.B. Joshua and confirmed by the events that followed. In this section are some of the recent prophetic messages revealed during the live Sunday services at The SCOAN that have come to fulfillment.\n\nHEALING\n\nHIV CANCER FRUIT OF THE WOMB OTHER HEALING INTERNATIONAL VISITORS\n\nCHARITY\n\n“Do what is good to change the bad you see” – T.B. Joshua\n\nHeaded by Prophet T.B. Joshua and the Emmanuel TV team, Another Ministry is committed to:\n\n· Feeding, educating and providing necessities of life for the poor.\n\n· Providing educational funds for promising students.\n\n· Taking care of the elderly.\n\n· Building schools and classrooms.\n\n· Giving love and hope to the needy.\n\nKnowing God is not only seeing His works, but learning His way. His way is love, kindness, hope and goodness. Therefore, we should let love be uppermost in our hearts because all our doings without love are nothing. Another Ministry shares the love of Jesus Christ to the less privileged and needy. Join Another Ministry to feed the hungry, bring relief to the poor, support the weak the handicapped and bless the needy.\n\nJames 2:14-17 – “What good is it, my brothers, if a man claims to have faith but has no deeds? Can such faith save him? Suppose a brother or sister is without clothes and daily food. If one of you says to him, “Go, I wish you well; keep warm and well fed,” but does nothing about his physical needs, what good is it? In the same way, faith by itself, if it is not accompanied by action, is dead.”\n\nRemember, nothing is too big or too small to share with others. Build your life around your contribution to others because your contribution to others is an assignment from God.\n\nInstead of criticising our sick society and our fellow men – do what is good to change the bad you see and make a tangible contribution in the life of someone who needs help. We should be known as people who are for good, and not just against bad.\n\n1 John 3:18 – “Dear children, let us not love with words or tongue but with actions and in truth.”\n\n“In a world that cares less, we should care more” – T.B.

Here is a news report on his visit, and what he said during a live interview with Emmanuel TV after the service…\n\nFORMER president Frederick Chiluba has called on leaders to seek God’s wisdom as they govern people.\n\nIn an interview after attending a church service last Sunday at the Synagogue Church of All Nations (SCOAN) in Lagos, Nigeria, Chiluba said leaders who depended on God led their nations peacefully.\n\nHis first trip outside Zambia since he was acquitted of varying allegations of corruption, Chiluba returned to the SCOAN almost nine years after his first visit as Zambia’s Republican president.\n\nChiluba in The SCOAN\n\nThe former president, who has been the subject of intense scrutiny throughout his post-presidential era, was a guest of Pastor TB Joshua of the Emmanuel TV fame last Sunday.\n\nWhen asked by an Emmanuel TV reporter his experience of the service, which included the deliverance and rehabilitation of several armed robbers as well as a thanksgiving service for the MVP of the recently concluded FIFA U-17 World Cup, Sani Emmanuel, Chiluba was full of praises to God for Prophet Joshua and Emmanuel TV, which he said he watched daily.\n\nDescribing the service as ‘highly inspiring’ and ‘motivating’, Chiluba hoped that leaders would do well to seek God’s wisdom in governance.\n\n“If you read the book of Kings in the Bible, kings that depended on God guided their nations peacefully and successfully. God never changes. When we depend on Him… we will do extremely well,” he said.\n\nChiluba said since declaring Zambia a Christian nation at the start of his presidency, the country had moved steadily forward.\n\nHe also extolled the virtues of Emmanuel TV, TB Joshua’s Christian television station that is\n\ngrowing increasing popularity throughout Zambia and indeed Africa.\n\n“It is really inspiring, not only for ordinary people but even for great leaders. I have been watching Emmanuel TV on a daily basis and my wife and I not only enjoy it, we are taught great lessons. We learn, we are inspired, we are motivated and we keep believing the Lord is truly with us; He is always present.”\n\nHe further admonished other leaders to follow in his stead by watching Emmanuel TV and inculcating the Godly principles taught there.\n\n“For leaders, it is critical that they watch Emmanuel TV. They learn a tremendous amount of knowledge and wisdom. God’s wisdom is the only wisdom. And it helps you guide and lead people extremely well with the knowledge you receive because every utterance from the prophet is based on the Bible, it’s scripture-based.”\n\nChiluba and his wife Regina were witness to the celebration surrounding two members of Pastor Joshua’s football club, My People FC, who were part of Nigeria’s cadet team, the Golden Eaglets, during their recent campaign in the U-17 World Cup. Sani Emmanuel, the MVP of the tournament, was brought up by Joshua and is an altar boy in the SCOAN.\n\nFrederick Chiluba With My People FC’s Sani Emmanuel And Ogenyi Onazi\n\n“This is a beauty to behold,” said Chiluba. “This is the way you build youngsters, the way you draw them away from whatever life of suffering or what they may be going through, and you build and mould them into very responsible citizens. “\n\nProphet TB Joshua, noted for his charitable works and prophetic prowess, also rehabilitated several armed robbers in the service, an act that won commendation from Chiluba.\n\n“Truly and honestly for me, that is the Gospel at work, they ex-armed robbers are bound to change a lot of people, and we welcome those young men. But remember, that could never have happened if this man of God was not highly anointed; so anointed so that he could be able to speak peace and love to those lost souls and they came in.”\n\nBoth Chiluba and Regina were unanimous in their message to viewers: “Don’t miss a single day without watching Emmanuel TV.”\n\nIt would be recalled that John Atta Mills, the President of Ghana was in The Synagogue in January this year, testifying to the accurate prophetic message Joshua had given him before his ascension to power.\n\nSOURCE: Post News, Zambia\n\n51.492659 -0.054239"
