Description: Young Striker

Personality: Fairly Loyal

Poacher - Attack

Advanced Forward - Attack

Special Notes:

He has a lot of potential, but as I found out a lot (if not all) of his stats are randomly generated each save, so if you find him he my have not look exactly like in the screenshots.

Just scout him and see for yourself.

As for signing, he plays for an Amateur club in Nigeria, so all you need to pay is around 18k in compensation when you sign him, and he will go nearly anywhere. There has never been any club interested in his signature when I went after him so he might be a very safe bet. As you can see from the screens, he doesn't ask for lot of wage and develops rather nicely for a lower league team. If nothing else, he can be a fantastic investment.
