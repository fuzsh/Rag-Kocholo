        "text": "Gitega : the Frodebu party exasperated by actions of the CNDD-FDD calls on Burundians to break fear\n\nOn Sunday, the Sahwanya Frodebu party celebrated the 31st anniversary of the first victory of a Hutu president elected as head of state, in the political capital Gitega. Its chairperson Patrick Nkurunziza as well as the former speaker of the National Assembly Léonce Ngendakumana denounced cases of assassinations and kidnappings which have become commonplace in Burundi in recent days. They also recalled that it is Frodebu that set up the old Hutu rebellion, after the assassination of Melchior Ndadaye. They ask the ruling party to put an end to the exclusion which characterizes Burundian institutions and for Burundians to “break the silence”.\n\nINFO SOS Médias Burundi\n\nThe high cost of living, targeted assassinations, kidnappings, corruption which characterizes Burundian authorities, exclusion, poor management of public affairs, abuses committed by the Imbonerakure (members of the CNDD-FDD youth league), ….the list of reproaches from the Frodebu party to its former student is very long.\n\nIn a ceremony which took place in the political capital Gitega, the two men deplored the behavior of those in power. For Léonce Ngendakumana, the Sahwanya Frodebu party has created its own problem.\n\n“When we created the Frodebu party, we said that the Hutus were discriminated but since the CNDD-FDD came to power, the latter pushed Frodebu aside. During 19 years in power, it did not hire any Frodebu activists. We create our own problem, I tell you, we are the ones who created them (the CNDD-FDD), we financed them with equipment, medicines, food and we helped them financially, we did everything for them. The only Frodebu activist who was hired by the CNDD-FDD is the chairperson of the party, but he was fired. We don’t know what happened but he got up one morning and was fired,” declared Mr. Ngendakumana, known for his eloquence and courage.\n\nPatrick Nkurunziza spoke in the same direction.\n\n“The CNDD-FDD is the work of Frodebu, the current leaders must accept it. You will hear some say that they formed a coalition following anger. Why don’t we put something in place today similar to the CNDD-FDD while we are frustrated? The CNDD-FDD must internalize it, it is a work of the Frodebu party. Since June 1, we have started a campaign to tell the CNDD-FDD that the country is belongs to us all. Break fear wherever you go. The CNDD-FDD must understand that this country belongs to us all,” said the chairperson of the first Hutu party to win an election in Burundi.\n\nAnd he deplores, “They tell me every day and make fun of me in these terms : how can you lead a party without an army and without guns!”\n\nPatrick Nkurunziza calls on the activists of his party in particular and Burundians in general to “resist arbitrary arrests and kidnappings”, by always demanding arrest warrants “when people in vehicles with tinted windows come to kidnap citizens”.\n\n“It concerns us all, I repeat it and I ask the journalists here present to repeat my words without omitting anything,” he insisted.\n\nHe hopes for change despite the exclusion of other parties from the CENI (Independent National Electoral Commission).\n\n“You just have to break the fear. Even in 1993 when we won against the UPRONA, the CENI was one-colored. I know that many of you will hide your scarves and hats when you come back home for fear of repression of the Imbonerakure (members of the CNDD-FDD youth league). These Imbonerakure are also frustrated because they are also affected by poverty. This is why they are looking for victims to beat and rob because they have to find something to eat. You will have to make them aware. Apart from the Motorolas that were given to them to deceive them that they are strong, can they eat these Motorolas? You will have to remind them that Burundi has collapsed,” added Patrick Nkurunziza.\n\nFrodebu activists sing their party’s anthem in a ceremony marking the 31st anniversary of the first victory of a Hutu president elected as head of state in Burundi, June 2, 2024 in Gitega\n\nAccording to Léonce Ngendakumana, the CNDD-FDD, which does not tolerate being criticized, should put an end to all acts which give rise to accusations.\n\n“Can we say that we have sugar when there is none? Are we going to be silent when children are learning nothing at school? Are we going to stop shouting when people are kidnapped and found dead? It’s impossible for them to know that the Frodebu party will denounce bad practices if they continue to do so and we are ready to face the related consequences”, insisted the former speaker of the national assembly. He asked all Burundians to “refuse authoritarian power”.\n\n“Ndadaye wanted a respectful and respected Burundi where the Hutus, Tutsis, Ganwa and Twa must come together to refuse authoritarian power.”\n\nHe deplored the corruption which characterizes Burundian authorities who asphyxiate Burundians with taxes and want to regress all the rights acquired with the advent of the Frodebu party in 1993.\n\n“The current leaders have failed on every level during their 18 years in power,” he accused.\n\nLéonce Ngendakumana calls on political parties, religious denominations, civil society, intellectuals, all Burundians in general, of all ages, to stand up as one man to change things.\n\n“The indignant people are numerous and are stronger than the well-off people,” he believes.\n\nFor Léonce Ngendakumana, the Burundian problem is not ethnic. He gives the example of the former Tutsi military officers who ruled Burundi by always resorting to coups d’état, and the current leaders of the CNDD-FDD who discriminate against the Hutus like the traditional CNL leader, Agathon Rwasa whereas he was in the maquis like them for the same cause.\n\nFor the moment, the Frodebu party is aware that the electoral period promises to be tough but remains confident that if Burundians vote responsibly, “we will first start by winning the legislative elections.”\n\nIts leaders remind Burundians that the few rights that citizens still enjoy, including those linked to the promotion of women and the Batwa minority, were born with the takeover of power by Melchior Ndadaye.\n\nThe first Hutu elected as head of state in the small East African nation on June 1, 1993 before being assassinated on October 21 the same year, Melchior Ndadaye remains a hero for the majority of Burundians and all Hutus. He was recognized as a “hero of democracy” by the CNDD-FDD. Ndadaye has his monument in the commercial city Bujumbura not far from his palace.\n\nThe CNDD-FDD in power in Burundi is a former Hutu rebellion that emerged after the assassination of Ndadaye. But since its accession to power in 2005 thanks to the Arusha peace and reconciliation agreement of August 2000, it has found other support among Hutu and Tutsi political groups and organizations, which disgusts its former mentor, including intellectual activists who say that “we are being sidelined even though we have a lot to contribute for the good of this country where everything is chaotic.”\n\n—————\n\nFrodebu party officials greet activists in a ceremony marking the 31st anniversary of the first victory of a Hutu president elected as head of state in Burundi, May 2, 2024 in Gitega"
