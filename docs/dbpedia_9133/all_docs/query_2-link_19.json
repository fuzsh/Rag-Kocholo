Burundi is a part of the Albertine Rift, the western extension of the East African Rift. The country lies on a rolling plateau in the center of Africa. The source of the Nile River is in Bururi province, and is linked from Lake Victoria to its headwaters via the Ruvyironza River, Lake Victoria is also an important water source, which serves as a fork to the Kagera River, while Lake Tanganyika is located in much of Burundi’s southwestern corner.\n\nLanguages\n\nKirundi and French are the official languages, and Kiswahili and English are widely spoken.\n\nCommunications\n\nCountry code 257 (no area codes); internet domain ‘.bi’.\n\nPublic holidays\n\nNew Year’s Day, Unity Day (5 February), Ntaryamira Day (6 April), Labour Day (1 May), Ascension Day (May), Independence Day (1 July), Assumption (15 August), All Saints’ Day (1 November), Christmas Day and Boxing Day.\n\nReligious festivals whose dates vary from year to year include Good Friday, Eid al-Fitr (End of Ramadan, two days) and Eid al-Adha.\n\nTransport\n\nThere are 12,300km of roads, 10% paved.\n\nThere is no railway.\n\nThe main international airport is Bujumbura International Airport in Bujumbura.\n\nInternational relations\n\nBurundi is a member of the African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States, African Union, Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa, Non-Aligned Movement, Organisation internationale de la Francophonie, United Nations and World Trade Organization.\n\nTopography\n\nBurundi is a country mainly of mountains and plateaus, with a western range of mountains running north-south and continuing into Rwanda. The highest point is Mt. Heha at 2,670 m. The country is popularly known as the ‘the heart of Africa’.\n\nClimate\n\nBurundi has a moderate tropical climate with average temperatures between 23 and 24ºC, a fortunate average for a country located near the Equatorial area renowned for its heat and humidity.\n\nEnvironment\n\nThe most significant environmental issues soil erosion as a result of overgrazing and the expansion of agriculture into marginal lands as well as deforestation due to little forested land remains because of uncontrolled cutting of trees for fuel. In addition, habitat loss threatens wildlife populations.\n\nVegetation\n\nThe growth and development of Burundi Flora and Fauna depends on the location and the climate of the country. However, the flora of Burundi has undergone huge exploitation throughout the past and consequentially the fauna of Burundi has also been affected. Savanna grasslands cover most parts of Burundi. The trees thriving in Burundi concentrate in the regions surrounding the lakes.\n\nWildlife\n\nWildlife was abundant before the region became agricultural. Still found are the elephant, hippopotamus, crocodile, wild boar, lion, antelope, and flying lemur, as well as such game birds as guinea fowl, partridge, duck, geese, quail, and snipe."
