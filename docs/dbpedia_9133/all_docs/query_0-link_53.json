        "text": "In an ever-worsening climate for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people in East Africa, Burundian president Évariste Ndayishimiye has added fuel to the fire. Speaking with journalists on December 29, he said, “if you want to attract a curse to the country, accept homosexuality,” and “it is better to take [LGBT people] to a stadium and stone them” because “that’s what they deserve.”\n\nThe reaction was swift. One LGBT activist in Burundi who requested anonymity told Human Rights Watch: “Very quickly, on social media networks, a thousand comments from [the president’s] supporters [emerged] with competing threats and calls for murder, each more atrocious than the last.” Many of the comments went further than the president, calling for even more violence and brutal punishments against LGBT people.\n\nDays later the Burundian ambassador to Belgium issued a statement claiming the president’s remarks had been “misinterpreted.” The United States and European Union called on Burundi’s government to respect the rights of all Burundians, but stopped short of calling out the remarks for what they were: homophobic.\n\nThis type of fearmongering is not new in Burundi, where sexual relations between people of the same sex have been illegal since former president Pierre Nkurunziza signed a new criminal code into law in 2009. The law was a fierce blow to Burundi’s LGBT people, who had begun to come out and organize, albeit in small numbers, to demand their rights be respected.\n\nThe National Assembly’s human rights commission added the anti-homosexuality provision in the 2009 criminal code at the last minute, apparently under pressure from Nkurunziza, who made statements on television condemning homosexuality as a “curse.” His offices also telephoned lawmakers seeking to influence their votes."
