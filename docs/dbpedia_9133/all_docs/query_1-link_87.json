        "text": "Three HROC basic workshops were conducted in Gitega during June 2020. The motivation for returning to Gitega is explained by the following events and circumstances.\n\nFollowing the 2015 election crisis, Bujumbura was the most impacted by the situation related to the protest against the third term of later President Nkurunziza. This pushed IPB-HROC to concentrate its efforts there, in partnership with AGLI, AFSC and QSN, all Quaker organizations, through peace dialogues using the HROC program strategies of intervention and nonviolent conflict management.\n\nIn 2017, Catholic Relief Services opened a space for our HROC program in its project “Be healed and cohabitate together” to offer technical services related to trauma healing. This continues today in Bujumbura and Bubanza provinces.\n\nIn 2019, the Burundi government separated the country’s economic capital and its political one. Bujumbura remained the economic capital and Gitega became the political capital. Today the political sphere of the country at high levels is managed in Gitega and new initiatives are today piloted there.\n\nTaking in account the way the 1993 Burundi crisis following the assassination of the hero of democracy, President Ndadaye Melchior, affected Gitega province and its surroundings, trauma healing is one of the needs for everyone there. IPB-HROC plans to open a sub-office in Gitega and manage its interventions from the two strategic parts of the country today: Bujumbura and Gitega.\n\nThe first three HROC basic workshops were conducted at Kwibuka Friends Church Center in three different schools. 80 students participated in those workshops."
