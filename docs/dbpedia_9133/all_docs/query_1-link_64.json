        "text": "Introduction\n\nIntroduction\n\nIntroduction\n\nBackground\n\nBurundi is a small country in Central-East Africa bordered by Tanzania, Rwanda, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Lake Tanganyika. Burundi gained its independence from Belgium in 1962 as the Kingdom of Burundi, but the monarchy was overthrown in 1966 and a republic established. Political violence and non-democratic transfers of power have marked much of its history; Burundi's first democratically elected president, a Hutu, was assassinated in October 1993 after only 100 days in office. The internationally brokered Arusha Agreement, signed in 2000, and subsequent ceasefire agreements with armed movements ended the 1993-2005 civil war. Burundi’s second democratic elections were held in 2005. Pierre NKURUNZIZA was elected president in 2005 and 2010, and again in a controversial election in 2015. Burundi continues to face many economic and political challenges.\n\nGeography\n\nGeography\n\nGeography\n\nLocation\n\nCentral Africa, east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, west of Tanzania\n\nGeographic coordinates\n\n3 30 S, 30 00 E\n\nMap references\n\nAfrica\n\nArea\n\ntotal: 27,830 sq km\n\nland: 25,680 sq km\n\nwater: 2,150 sq km\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 147\n\nArea - comparative\n\nslightly smaller than Maryland\n\nLand boundaries\n\ntotal: 1,140 km\n\nborder countries (3): Democratic Republic of the Congo 236 km, Rwanda 315 km, Tanzania 589 km\n\nCoastline\n\n0 km(landlocked)\n\nMaritime claims\n\nnone (landlocked)\n\nClimate\n\nequatorial; high plateau with considerable altitude variation (772 m to 2,670 m above sea level); average annual temperature varies with altitude from 23 to 17 degrees Celsius but is generally moderate as the average altitude is about 1,700 m; average annual rainfall is about 150 cm; two wet seasons (February to May and September to November), and two dry seasons (June to August and December to January)\n\nTerrain\n\nhilly and mountainous, dropping to a plateau in east, some plains\n\nElevation\n\nmean elevation: 1,504 m\n\nlowest point: Lake Tanganyika 772 m\n\nhighest point: Heha 2,670 m\n\nNatural resources\n\nnickel, uranium, rare earth oxides, peat, cobalt, copper, platinum, vanadium, arable land, hydropower, niobium, tantalum, gold, tin, tungsten, kaolin, limestone\n\nLand use\n\nagricultural land: 73.3% (2011 est.)\n\narable land: 38.9% (2011 est.)/permanent crops: 15.6% (2011 est.)/permanent pasture: 18.8% (2011 est.)\n\nforest: 6.6% (2011 est.)\n\nother: 20.1% (2011 est.)\n\nIrrigated land\n\n230 sq km (2012)\n\nPopulation distribution\n\none of Africa's most densely populated countries; concentrations tend to be in the north and along the northern shore of Lake Tanganyika in the west; most people live on farms near areas of fertile volcanic soil\n\nNatural hazards\n\nflooding; landslides; drought\n\nEnvironment - current issues\n\nsoil erosion as a result of overgrazing and the expansion of agriculture into marginal lands; deforestation (little forested land remains because of uncontrolled cutting of trees for fuel); habitat loss threatens wildlife populations\n\nEnvironment - international agreements\n\nparty to: Biodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Endangered Species, Hazardous Wastes, Ozone Layer Protection, Wetlands\n\nsigned, but not ratified: Law of the Sea\n\nGeography - note\n\nlandlocked; straddles crest of the Nile-Congo watershed; the Kagera, which drains into Lake Victoria, is the most remote headstream of the White Nile\n\nPeople and Society\n\nPeople and Society\n\nPeople and Society\n\nPopulation\n\n11,844,520 (July 2018 est.)\n\nnote: estimates for this country explicitly take into account the effects of excess mortality due to AIDS; this can result in lower life expectancy, higher infant mortality, higher death rates, lower population growth rates, and changes in the distribution of population by age and sex than would otherwise be expected\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 76\n\nNationality\n\nnoun: Burundian(s)\n\nadjective: Burundian\n\nEthnic groups\n\nHutu 85%, Tutsi 14%, Twa (Pygmy) 1%, Europeans 3,000, South Asians 2,000\n\nLanguages\n\nKirundi only 29.7% (official); French only .3% (official); Swahili only .2%; English only .1% (official); Kirundi and French 8.4%; Kirundi, French, and English 2.4%, other language combinations 2%, unspecified 56.9% (2008 est.)\n\nnote: data represent languages read and written by people 10 years of age or older; spoken Kirundi is nearly universal\n\nReligions\n\nRoman Catholic 62.1%, Protestant 23.9% (includes Adventist 2.3% and other Protestant 21.6%), Muslim 2.5%, other 3.6%, unspecified 7.9% (2008 est.)\n\nDemographic profile\n\nBurundi is a densely populated country with a high population growth rate, factors that combined with land scarcity and poverty place a large share of its population at risk of food insecurity. About 90% of the population relies on subsistence agriculture. Subdivision of land to sons, and redistribution to returning refugees, results in smaller, overworked, and less productive plots. Food shortages, poverty, and a lack of clean water contribute to a 60% chronic malnutrition rate among children. A lack of reproductive health services has prevented a significant reduction in Burundi’s maternal mortality and fertility rates, which are both among the world’s highest. With two-thirds of its population under the age of 25 and a birth rate of about 6 children per woman, Burundi’s population will continue to expand rapidly for decades to come, putting additional strain on a poor country.Historically, migration flows into and out of Burundi have consisted overwhelmingly of refugees from violent conflicts. In the last decade, more than a half million Burundian refugees returned home from neighboring countries, mainly Tanzania. Reintegrating the returnees has been problematic due to their prolonged time in exile, land scarcity, poor infrastructure, poverty, and unemployment. Repatriates and existing residents (including internally displaced persons) compete for limited land and other resources. To further complicate matters, international aid organizations reduced their assistance because they no longer classified Burundi as a post-conflict country. Conditions have deteriorated since renewed violence erupted in April 2015, causing another outpouring of refugees. In addition to refugee out-migration, Burundi has hosted thousands of refugees from neighboring countries, mostly from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and lesser numbers from Rwanda.\n\nAge structure\n\n0-14 years: 45.52%(male 2,712,836 /female 2,678,223)\n\n15-24 years: 19.21%(male 1,135,145 /female 1,139,717)\n\n25-54 years: 28.7%(male 1,694,547 /female 1,704,369)\n\n55-64 years: 3.89%(male 218,272 /female 242,855)\n\n65 years and over: 2.69%(male 137,590 /female 180,966) (2018 est.)\n\npopulation pyramid:\n\nDependency ratios\n\ntotal dependency ratio: 89.6 (2015 est.)\n\nyouth dependency ratio: 84.8 (2015 est.)\n\nelderly dependency ratio: 4.7 (2015 est.)\n\npotential support ratio: 21.1 (2015 est.)\n\nMedian age\n\ntotal: 17.1 years (2018 est.)\n\nmale: 16.8 years\n\nfemale: 17.3 years\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 221\n\nPopulation growth rate\n\n3.23% (2018 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 4\n\nBirth rate\n\n40.9 births/1,000 population (2018 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 7\n\nDeath rate\n\n8.6 deaths/1,000 population (2018 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 74\n\nNet migration rate\n\n0 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2018 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 80\n\nPopulation distribution\n\none of Africa's most densely populated countries;

Agriculture accounts for over 40% of GDP and employs more than 90% of the population. Burundi's primary exports are coffee and tea, which account for more than half of foreign exchange earnings, but these earnings are subject to fluctuations in weather and international coffee and tea prices, Burundi is heavily dependent on aid from bilateral and multilateral donors, as well as foreign exchange earnings from participation in the African Union Mission to Somalia (AMISOM). Foreign aid represented 48% of Burundi's national income in 2015, one of the highest percentages in Sub-Saharan Africa, but this figure decreased to 33.5% in 2016 due to political turmoil surrounding President NKURUNZIZA’s bid for a third term. Burundi joined the East African Community (EAC) in 2009.Burundi faces several underlying weaknesses – low governmental capacity, corruption, a high poverty rate, poor educational levels, a weak legal system, a poor transportation network, and overburdened utilities – that have prevented the implementation of planned economic reforms. The purchasing power of most Burundians has decreased as wage increases have not kept pace with inflation, which reached approximately 18% in 2017.Real GDP growth dropped precipitously following political events in 2015 and has yet to recover to pre-conflict levels. Continued resistance by donors and the international community will restrict Burundi’s economic growth as the country deals with a large current account deficit.\n\nGDP (purchasing power parity)\n\n$8.007 billion (2017 est.)\n\n$8.007 billion (2016 est.)\n\n$8.091 billion (2015 est.)\n\nnote: data are in 2017 dollars\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 164\n\nGDP (official exchange rate)\n\n$3.396 billion (2017 est.)\n\nGDP - real growth rate\n\n0% (2017 est.)\n\n-1% (2016 est.)\n\n-4% (2015 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 196\n\nGDP - per capita (PPP)\n\n$700 (2017 est.)\n\n$800 (2016 est.)\n\n$800 (2015 est.)\n\nnote: data are in 2017 dollars\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 227\n\nGross national saving\n\n-5.3% of GDP (2017 est.)\n\n-4.1% of GDP (2016 est.)\n\n-6.7% of GDP (2015 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 183\n\nGDP - composition, by end use\n\nhousehold consumption: 83% (2017 est.)\n\ngovernment consumption: 20.8% (2017 est.)\n\ninvestment in fixed capital: 16% (2017 est.)\n\ninvestment in inventories: 0% (2017 est.)\n\nexports of goods and services: 5.5% (2017 est.)\n\nimports of goods and services: -25.3% (2017 est.)\n\nGDP - composition, by sector of origin\n\nagriculture: 39.5% (2017 est.)\n\nindustry: 16.4% (2017 est.)\n\nservices: 44.2% (2017 est.)\n\nAgriculture - products\n\ncoffee, cotton, tea, corn, beans, sorghum, sweet potatoes, bananas, cassava (manioc, tapioca);

cross-border conflicts persist among Tutsi, Hutu, other ethnic groups, associated political rebels, armed gangs, and various government forces in the Great Lakes region\n\nRefugees and internally displaced persons\n\nrefugees (country of origin): 84,469 (Democratic Republic of the Congo) (refugees and asylum seekers) (2019)\n\nIDPs: 103,352 (some ethnic Tutsis remain displaced from intercommunal violence that broke out after the 1,993 coup and fighting between government forces and rebel groups; violence since April 2015) (2019)\n\nstateless persons: 974 (2018)\n\nTrafficking in persons\n\ncurrent situation: Burundi is a source country for children and possibly women subjected to forced labor and sex trafficking; business people recruit Burundian girls for prostitution domestically, as well as in Rwanda, Kenya, Uganda, and the Middle East, and recruit boys and girls for forced labor in Burundi and Tanzania; children and young adults are coerced into forced labor in farming, mining, informal commerce, fishing, or collecting river stones for construction; sometimes family, friends, and neighbors are complicit in exploiting children, at times luring them in with offers of educational or job opportunities\n\ntier rating: Tier 3 – Burundi does not comply fully with the minimum standards for the elimination of human trafficking and is not making significant efforts to do so; corruption, a lack of political will, and limited resources continue to hamper efforts to combat human trafficking; in 2014, the government did not inform judicial and law enforcement officials of the enactment of an anti-trafficking law or how to implement it and approved – but did not fund – its national anti-trafficking action plan; authorities again failed to identify trafficking victims or to provide them with adequate protective services; the government has focused on transnational child trafficking but gave little attention to its domestic child trafficking problem and adult trafficking victims (2015)\n\nFlag of Burundi\n\nFlag of Burundi\n\nFlag of Burundi"
