        "text": "Gitega\n\nBurundi\n\nFormerly known as:\n\nKitega\n\nGitega, town, central Burundi. The town lies about 40 miles (65 km) east of the national capital of Bujumbura. For centuries Gitega was the seat of the Burundian mwami (king) and the capital of the kingdom of Burundi. It also served as an administrative centre when Burundi was under colonial rule. In 2007 the Burundian government announced plans to eventually move the national capital from Bujumbura to Gitega.\n\nConstituting the second largest town in the country, Gitega functions as a centre for religion and education; it has primary, secondary, technical, and vocational schools and places of worship for Muslims, Roman Catholics, and Protestants. Industrial enterprises in Gitega include a livestock market, peat exploitation, and a tannery. The National Museum, featuring exhibits on history and art, is also located there.\n\nGitega is situated on Burundiâ€™s central plateau. Most of the surrounding area is devoted to livestock (cattle, goats, and sheep) grazing and the growing of such crops as bananas, peanuts (groundnuts), sweet potatoes, cassava (manioc), beans, corn (maize), sorghum, and coffee. A major road links Gitega with the national capital. Pop. (2004 est.) 25,500.\n\nThis article was most recently revised and updated by Amy McKenna."
