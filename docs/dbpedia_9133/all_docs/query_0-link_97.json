        "text": "History & Collections\n\nBurundi, a republic in central eastern Africa, is bordered by Rwanda on the north, Tanzania on the east and south, Lake Tanganyika on the southwest, and Zaire on the west. Population (1990) 5,356,000; area 27,834 sq.km. The official languages are Kirundi and French; Swahili is also widely spoken.\n\nHistory\n\nA kingdom since the 16th century, Burundi was a Belgian colony called Urundi (often associated with Ruarida) Until it gained its independence in 1962. A military coup overthrew the monarchy in 1966 and established a republic.\n\nNational Library\n\nThe national library and archives are combined and located in Bujumbura, the capital. They offer a wide range of services and facilities for research, but they are not professionally organized, nor are the collections properly housed, because the institutions lack professional staff and funds. They do have book and card catalogues oftheir holdings and a reading room.\n\nAcademic Libraries\n\nMajor academic libraries in Burundi are those of the University of Burundi (150,000 volumes and 600 current periodicals), L11C theological college of Bujumbura (15,000 volumes), and the higher military institute 14,600 volumes). The University of Burundi has a central library and several departmental and institute libraries on the main campus in Bujumbura and one library at the Institute of Agriculture in Gitega. The central library is housed in a two-story building with seats for about 1,500 readers. The university libraries are designed to help students and faculty conduct research on a wide range of subjects. They also offer their services to the general public for a small fee. The university libraries offer library tours and bibliographic instruction to new students at the beginning of each academic year.\n\nPublic Libraries\n\nNational cultural centers were created in the provinces starting in 1989; by the early 1990s, 10 of the 15 provinces had them. Their holdings average 15,000 volumes of general-interest books and small collections of audiovisual materials. There are three major libraries open to the public in Bujumbura: the American cultural center (4,000 volumes and 50 periodicals), the French cultural center (21,000 volumes and 50 periodicals), and the United Nations information center (almost 6,4 K) volumes and more than 200 periodicals). They are used mostly by high school students and civil servants.\n\nSchool Libraries\n\nMany secondary schools throughout the country have school libraries. However, these libraries are not supported by the government, but by the local schools themselves. The quality and the number of their collections vary according to the budgets provided by local school boards.\n\nSpecial Libraries\n\nMost government mininistries maintain important technical and historical collections, including the National Center for Statistical Documentation in the Ministry of Planning, the Library of Agronomic Sciences in the Ministry of Agriculture, the library of the Department of Scientific Research in the Ministry of Education, and the library of the Continuing Education Center in the Ministry of public Administration. In many cases the documents, though useful for research, are not well used, because most libraies are not well organized and few have professional staff.\n\nThe Profession"
