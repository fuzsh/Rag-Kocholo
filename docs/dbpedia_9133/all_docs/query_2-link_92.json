        "text": "BUJUMBURA January 1st (ABP) – Residents of the economic capital of Burundi were preparing on Tuesday, December 31 for the end-of-the-year and New Year celebrations, a check on the site by ABP has revealed at the market commonly known as COTEBU which replaced the central market in Bujumbura.\n\nDuring that visit, the ABP noted an unusual movement of people who buy various items, especially kitchen items, to be able to decorate the meal of the last day of the year and celebrate the New Year with joy in the family.\n\nThe traders contacted did not complain. They clarified that the buyers are constantly coming. Buyers have reported that looking at market prices, food prices have not increased much as has happened in previous years. Only the price of meat has been revised upwards, from 9,000 BIF per kilo to 12,000. A meat seller contacted said that this increase was the result of speculation by wholesalers selling meat at the slaughterhouse who took advantage of holidays, like those at the end of the year, to drive up the price.Some items were preferred more than others, including peas, meat, potatoes and other ingredients.\n\nThe prices of other products were reasonable. It’s the case for peas, whose price per kg was between 2,800 and 3,000 BIF. That price is normal, said a buyer contacted, who said that even on other days, the pea bought at 2,500 BIF per kg.\n\nNote that the mayor of Bujumbura town has agreed to those wishing to participate with others in closing ceremonies of the year that are organized, whether at the level of churches or in other places known by the law. He said this in correspondence that he released on December 30, 2019."
