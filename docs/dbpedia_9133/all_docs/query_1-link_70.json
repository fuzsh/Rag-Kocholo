        "text": "This guide also has safety advice for regions of Burundi.\n\nTerrorism\n\nThere is a high threat of terrorist attack globally affecting UK interests and British nationals, including from groups and individuals who view the UK and British nationals as targets. Stay aware of your surroundings at all times.\n\nUK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on staying safe abroad and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out how to reduce your risk from terrorism while abroad.\n\nTerrorism in Burundi\n\nTerrorists are likely to try to carry out attacks in Burundi.\n\nAttacks could be indiscriminate, including in places visited by foreign nationals.\n\nAl-Shabaab, although based in Somalia, poses a threat across the East Africa region. Al-Shabaab has previously made public threats against Burundi because of its support for the African Union peacekeeping mission in Somalia. Al-Shabaab have claimed responsibility for attacks in Kenya and Uganda, linking some attacks to support for the African Union peacekeeping mission.\n\nFollow the advice of local authorities and exercise caution while travelling around the country.\n\nPolitical situation\n\nSecurity incidents do happen in Burundi, and there remains concern about the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) border region as a result of the security situation in eastern DRC.\n\nBurundi closed its land borders with Rwanda on 11 January 2024 because of escalating bilateral tensions. It is still possible to fly between the two capitals.\n\nThere are reports of arbitrary arrests, detentions and disappearances of Burundians, most often from civil society, independent media and pockets of society perceived to be anti-government.\n\nGrenade attacks are common in Burundi. On 10 May, there were two grenade attacks in central Bujumbura targeting crowded areas. Attacks of this kind can be used by criminal gangs or have a political motivation.\n\nAvoid all large gatherings, stay alert and follow the instructions of local authorities.\n\nCrime\n\nThe crime rate in Burundi is high. There is a risk of muggings at gun and knifepoint, bag-snatching, pickpocketing, burglary, car break-ins and armed carjackings.\n\nProtecting yourself and your belongings\n\nYou can take steps to reduce your personal risk, by:\n\nnot walking in the streets or using public transport after dark, even in Bujumbura city centre\n\nnot carrying large amounts of money\n\ntaking care when withdrawing or exchanging cash, and not doing so at night\n\nstaying in hotels that have good security\n\nusing hotel safes where possible\n\nkeeping copies of important documents, including your passport and visa, separately\n\nbeing wary of who you plan to meet and where, and informing colleagues or family members of your plans\n\nLaws and cultural differences\n\nIllegal drugs and prison sentences\n\nThere are severe penalties for all drug offences.\n\nLGBT+ travellers\n\nSame-sex sexual acts are illegal. Punishment includes a prison sentence of between 3 months and 2 years and a fine. Burundi is a socially conservative society and LGBT+ people are not accepted. Showing affection in public may receive unwanted and negative attention.\n\nRead more advice for LGBT+ travellers.\n\nMoney\n\nBurundi is largely a cash-based society. Take US dollars dated post-2006. Most businesses will not accept or exchange older currency and US dollars with small tears will also be rejected. You can usually exchange euros and British pounds.\n\nThere’s a shortage of foreign exchange currencies in Burundi and an unofficial FX exchange rate exists. The unofficial rate can be substantially different from the official exchange rate.\n\nOutside Bujumbura credit and debit cards are rarely accepted, and there are not many ATMs. Do not rely on cash withdrawals. You can often use mobile money in tourist hotels.\n\nOutdoor activities\n\nSwimming\n\nAvoid swimming in Lake Tanganyika due to the risk of:\n\nbeing attacked by wildlife\n\nwaterborne diseases\n\nTransport risks\n\nRoad travel\n\nIf you are planning to drive in Burundi, see information on driving abroad.\n\nYou can use a UK photocard driving licence to drive in Burundi for 6 months. If you still have a paper driving licence, you may need to update it to a photocard licence.\n\nDrink -driving is a serious offence in Burundi. Penalties include fines and possibly a prison sentence.\n\nRoad conditions\n\nThere are only a small number of paved roads and these are sometimes in poor condition. Road infrastructure generally is poor and roads are frequently blocked or damaged by landslides, especially after heavy rain.\n\nLandslides can destroy road bridges, making some routes impassable. Check local advice on road conditions when planning travel by road and have an alternative plan in case your route is blocked.\n\nDriving standards are very poor and vehicles are often poorly maintained. Serious accidents are common.\n\nIf you’re involved in a car accident it’s unlikely the emergency services will be able to respond quickly or effectively. You can request help from the Red Cross by calling 109. They will act as first responders, along with the local traffic police (‘police de la protection civile et gestion des catastrophes’). You can contact the police by calling 112.\n\nKeep car doors locked and windows closed. Avoid travelling by road outside Bujumbura after dark, because of the security situation and road safety concerns.\n\nRoadblocks\n\nRoadblocks and document checks are common, and not always official. Carry a copy of your passport and visa, but you may need to produce originals.\n\nAccess into and out of Bujumbura city is controlled by police at night.\n\nFuel shortages\n\nBurundi is currently suffering from severe fuel shortages. Do not assume you’ll be able to get fuel in the country. Where fuel is available, there can often be long lines.\n\nPublic transport\n\nPublic transport vehicles (buses and motorbike taxis) are often poorly maintained and have low driving standards.\n\nExtreme weather and natural disasters\n\nFind out what you can do to prepare for and respond to extreme weather and natural hazards.\n\nFlooding\n\nThe rainy season in Burundi runs from February to May and can result in flash floods.\n\nEarthquakes"
