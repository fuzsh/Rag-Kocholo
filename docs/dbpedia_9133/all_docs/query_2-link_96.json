        "text": "Author’s note―Bonaventure Nicimpaye is a lawyer by training, with a specialization in International Relations. He pursued a career that began in 1973 in the public sector as a Legal Advisor to the Prime Minister of the Republic of Burundi, to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and then to the Presidency of the Republic. He then led the University of Burundi as Dean, from December 1977 to May 1981. After this mandate, he turned to the private sector by creating INTERCONTACT SERVICES, a company specializing in the provision of legal, administrative, and logistical services in favor of international companies and organizations. This biography looks back on a life marked by the values ​​of efficiency, transparency, and integrity.\n\nThe day after Burundi’s historic qualifying match against Gabon, on March 23, 2019, for the final phase of the African Cup of Nations football (CAN), we met in Bonaventure Nicimpaye’s office for our first writing session, which was more of an exercise in dialogue, sizing each other up, and preparing our minds for the best ways to achieve our common goal: writing one’s memoirs. It was about how to write the adventures we have lived, the way we remember them, and how we build on our reminiscences, a life story worthy of inspiring a reader.\n\nIt was necessary to take into account the current tendency to confuse in the same set, keeping a diary, writing a memoir, publishing an autobiography, in short, everything that speaks of oneself. And, during this first session we talked about many different aspects of a man’s life, as he diplomatically communicated his perspectives towards these notions, and in particular about his spiritual journey through the Communauté Chemin Neuf, a Catholic community birthed out of an ecumenical vocation in 1992, and which did not fail to influence his way of seeing the world and business.\n\nIn this same manner, he draws my attention to a passage from the Holy Bible: “What have you that you have not received? And, if you have received it, why do you boast, as if you had not received it? “. Indeed, even if he recognizes having worked hard in his life, he is indebted to God, and appreciates with gratitude and humility the importance of the values, the key role, and the merit of the various people, within his family, in his neighborhood and in his company, who helped him pave the way to success.\n\nHe then informs me that he was marked by his experiences as a boy scout, traveling, and international relations, and goes back to the personalities on his path who strongly influenced him, such as Father Gabriel Barakana, former Prime Minister Albin Nyamoya, Ambassador Laurent Nzeyimana, Doctor Charles Bitariho, and Mr. Dominique Shiramanga.\n\n*\n\nOn the other hand, I personally knew Mr. Nicimpaye through his son, Aristide, a person who figures as one of my best friends in life. I had the chance to meet Aristide in Nairobi, almost 20 years ago, when we attended the same higher learning institution, the United States International University Africa campus.\n\nFor the record: we lived together in the same apartment in Kenya. Aristide saw me and helped me become the person I am today. When I started writing my first novel, Greener On The Other Side during the last week of October of 2012, he was the first to know about it, as well as the first to support me in this literary adventure. Aristide, after having discussed it with his father, recommended me.\n\nInitially, Mr. Nicimpaye wanted to write something for his children and grandchildren, an official way to leave a mark on this earth. Why leave a trace, one might ask? Men have always been particularly interested in the notion of inheritance, and in this context, it is important to know that Mr. Nicimpaye hardly knew his father, not even a photograph remains of him, and therefore he does not want his children to find themselves in a comparable situation.\n\nIn all honesty, I found it difficult to write everything down while Mr. Nicimpaye was speaking, it is so fascinating to understand someone’s life because Burundian tradition and literature, in its slightly anemic state, is largely based on orality. However, it is well known that writing a book is one of the main ways of transmitting knowledge and ideas from generation to generation.\n\nI thank him for entrusting me with such a delicate mission. I am flattered, and this motivation allows us to organize the best way forward, insisting that he can publish his book.\n\nWe meet, we exchange, and the idea of ​​publishing is not a priority on his part. Discarded, unthinkable! For what? We live in a negative environment, it can be dangerous to write because we expose ourselves, why this risk? Mr. Nicimpaye has nothing to defend against public opinion. He only owes an explanation to those he cares the most about!\n\nHe continues the writing session by giving me a lesson on “what it takes to be qualified for life”: the importance of allies, discipline, understanding the nature of adversity, and creating your own luck by taking responsibility.\n\nListening to him, one feels the urge to capture a special place, time, people, and moments, somehow bringing together a time that has gone forever, and at the same time wanting it back, re-creating it again on a page. We have the idea of ​​recording… On the first Sunday of May of 2019, Mr. Nicimpaye begins to make recordings which launches the project to the next phase.\n\nThroughout the discussion, Mr. Nicimpaye keeps this impenetrable gaze, his voice is calm. His office, with a confident and elegant look that one would expect from a diplomat, lends itself well to the moment. As the project progressed, I approached journalist and writer, Roland Rugero, for professional editorial support, as part of his nascent project, the Burundian publishing company, Edition Gusoma.\n\n*\n\nFor those who have received a lot, much will be asked: Mr. Nicimpaye has the privilege of having lived a long time, but above all, having founded and managed the same company for 40 consecutive years, based on the same values ​​of efficiency, of transparency, and integrity throughout these four decades… He succeeded in this challenge thanks to his permanent desire to provide the best possible service available. Everything he did had to be rated “Very well done” ―Day after day, week after week, month after month, year after year. He admits being extremely lucky to have a wife with whom he shared this taste for perfection. Every detail counted so that these activities generated income and contributed to the maintenance of their social and professional reputation. It’s this culture of excellence that will earn Intercontact Services the acquisition of an invaluable capital: trust.\n\nThose who fail to tarnish the image of your company will sometimes try to imitate you. Which is quite normal, in this Burundi where we imitate bakeries, pharmacies, kiosks on the corner of the street, etc. But many of them have realized that it is not enough to brandish such a label of what you can or want to do, you still have to attract customers. For this, you need personality, an identity, rigor and consistency. These are the values that guided Mr. Nicimpaye. His credibility depended on it.\n\nOne day, someone asked him how he managed to have a forty-year-old business? The question left him speechless. He ended up answering that it was respect for the law.\n\nThe public authorities will recognize these values ​​of integrity, as evidenced by the Prize of the Burundian Revenue Office (OBR) obtained in 2021! The Minister of Finance, before the National Assembly, announced the same year that Intercontact Services was the only broker who pays his taxes in Burundi.\n\nBy respecting the law, you’re at peace and protected. You also gain the respect of authority. Everyone knows that Mr. Nicimpaye respects authority, the law, and that he does not kneel before anyone. What one loses here by taking the straight road, one recovers by good reputation. These are the things that matter; this aspect of integrity will constantly come up in the communication on the values that underpin his brand. When his successors tell him that these values serve them, he gives thanks to God.\n\n*\n\nToday, Mr. Nicimpaye is 75 years old. He’s retired, and this transition to retirement generally sounds like a loss. A sum of losses, more exactly: loss of identity since one’s functions in the company that one created were for the most part merged with one’s personality. Added to this is a kind of loss of social recognition, that is to say, the progressive exclusion from a certain social network made up of professionally active people, who create things, who constantly measure themselves against the challenges of life, who try to build projects, (kwubaka in Kirundi). Only God knows how exhilarating and tiring it is. More than anything, what he feels the most is the loss of the rhythm of life to which he had been accustomed to for forty years; a daily life on the run, not to mention that the transition to retirement is a generational marker.\n\nOne would almost be tempted to say that to become retired is to fall into the category of the inactive lot. However, Mr. Nicimpaye doesn’t feel inactive. He has the impression of having simply changed the register of life, now with new possibilities. In particular, he engages in physical and spiritual exercises. There is walking and swimming, sometimes in a group, sometimes, alone. Also, he continues to participate in the activities of the Communauté du Chemin Neuf, to the extent of his strength, which is constantly declining, of course. He leads a quiet life, devoid of all stress, far from the frantic race that is the daily life of an entrepreneur, on the run. Today, I find a new balance, I accept the passage of time. I finally find the time to indulge in my hobbies.\n\nHe now enjoys a different perspective on the company he created, a privileged view that gives him the fact that he is no longer involved in the daily life of Intercontact Services. Mr. Nicimpaye has confidence in the new generation.\n\nCompanies around the world are beginning to replace human personnel with artificial intelligence: how, in this context of fierce inter-human and soon human-machine competition, will Burundi be able to position itself when we don’t have competent teams in terms of training and experience?\n\nIf our country is to hope to achieve high growth and a significant and rapid reduction in poverty, the major challenges facing Burundi are mainly the establishment of lasting peace and security, the construction of stable institutions committed on the development, establishment and maintenance of a macro-economic environment conducive to investment, State disengagement from the productive sector and promotion of the private sector, promotion of non-traditional methods, reduction of indebtedness, development of human capital, as well as an effective public health policy including reduction of the population growth rate. Among all these priorities, there is one on which Mr. Nicimpaye has enough experience in, to be able to express himself on. It is the issue of human capital.\n\nWith all that he has been through, he often wonders what to do with all his experience in the service sector, and the development of human capital, and how to exploit both the potential of the tertiary sector, which is within our reach here in Burundi, by betting in particular on the physical assets of the country, as well as the diaspora which specializes around the world, but who remain confined to limited contributions to national life.\n\nSeveral avenues are available to us to create wealth, in particular by outsourcing the human resources of companies. What attracts large companies to this process, especially in African countries, is mainly the rapid growth of their economies and their cheap labor force. If outsourcing refers to dubious exploitative intent (as we will have seen with the outsourcing scandals in Asian countries), this can have a positive impact on the populations of these developing economies.\n\nIn Africa, several countries compete in global outsourcing markets. For example, Kenya and Nigeria export business and IT services primarily to UK and US-based customers, relying on lack of jet lag, cultural similarities, linguistic proximity and quality of infrastructure. Outsourcing is also beneficial for Africa (Burundi) and contributes to the fight against youth unemployment and underemployment, thus stimulating economic growth. Thus, companies that outsource to Africa include multinationals like Orange, Vodafone, Microsoft, Intel, Virgin, among many others.\n\nThere are a host of services that can be effectively outsourced to Africa, including IT support, data entry and database management, call center services, data tagging, transcription, creation and content writing, engineering services, software development, virtual assistance, web analytics, and more. All of this work can be done remotely and on the basis of an independent contract.\n\nGradually, the African continent can align a highly qualified labor force, responding to the problem of unemployment which mainly affects young people on the continent. Research has also shown that workforces mobilized for example through service outsourcing exhibit high levels of emotional intelligence, low attrition rates and are extremely hardworking and dependable, considering the employment entrusted as an opportunity for social demarcation compared to local hiring…\n\nHiring web developers, content writers, photo editors, customer service representatives, and transcription or data labeling specialists in Burundi would be one of the strategies to attract foreign investors whose country so badly needs, by responding to the urgency of job creation by diversifying the sectors of intervention of the Burundian economy. The primary sector, which employs more than 80% of Burundians, is increasingly showing its limits with the scarcity of land and the means of production that have changed little over the years. If the national meeting is set for 2060 to make Burundi “a developed nation”, we must be creative, and strategic and keep in mind that time passes quickly, so quickly.\n\nThis work, Mr. Nicimpaye will have written for his children and grandchildren, but also for the young people of Burundi of today and tomorrow, who will learn so much about the attitude that makes it possible to win in life, in a society as complex as ours.\n\nKirundi: Iratiro ry’akaranga k’Uburundi, French: Musée National de Gitega, is the national museum of Burundi. The palace of the Mwami, it is located in Gitega and was founded under Belgian colonial rule in 1955, before independence. It was a thank you because Burundi had participated in the Second World War. The goal was to be able to gather or collect everything that characterized Burundi before colonization.\n\nRenowned for having been the first capital of Burundi under German colonization, Gitega is home to many buildings which, in the beginning, were the spearhead of tourism. However, today, these tourist spots give the impression of an abandoned place. Apart from the shrine of the drummers of Gishora, tourists no longer visit the town of Gitega. Since 2019, Gitega province reclaimed its status as the capital of Burundi. Henceforth, the National Museum expects to welcome many visitors.\n\nBy setting this goal, the Belgians were afraid that the rising generation would lose this wealth. The museum is one of the only places in the country where one can familiarize itself with the historical and cultural heritage of Burundi. The museum was intended to preserve artifacts from Burundian folk culture which were declining as a result of modernization and social change.\n\nThe museum’s collection includes ethnographic and historical objects originating in the country, including artifacts from the court of the Burundian monarchs— The objects found in this museum are archeology (hewn stone), trades (blacksmithing, cattle breeding, agriculture, clothing and ornaments, stone works, carpentry), and life in general in the court of the king.\n\nTo keep these objects in good condition, the embassies of Germany, Belgium, and the United States have equipped the museum with display cases allowing objects to remain in good shape. The museum is the largest of Burundi’s public museums although its collection is displayed in a single room.\n\nIn 2014, it averaged 20–50 visitors per week. The lack of funds has meant that the museum has made a few recent acquisitions. Africa’s cultural heritage is held outside Africa by major museums in Europe. During colonial rule in Africa, thousands of cultural artifacts were seized from the continent by western countries. But now, France has launched a report calling for thousands of African artifacts in its museums to be returned to the continent. This comes as major museums across Europe have agreed to loan key artifacts back to Africa. In building exhibits for the new museum, the focus will be geared towards reinventing displays, discourse, and design to create a new kind of space for self-representation.\n\nAmid this heated discussion about Africa reclaiming artifacts looted during the colonial era; and not as an act of repentance, but an act of friendship and trust, Lionel Muhoza Ntasano, a hospitality and tourism entrepreneur from Burundi, a novelist and innovation researcher at the novel Doctoral School of the University caught wind of this new cultural paradigm shift and discussed the phenomenon with the director of the Doctoral School of the University of Burundi, Dr. Juma Shabani and world-renowned civil engineer and Architect, Prof. Yves Weinand.\n\nIn collaboration with CRELACS (Centre de Recherche en Langues, Culture et Société), the academic research project looks at creating an innovative museum concept through a philosophical and physical renovation and restoration of the National Museum of Gitega using advanced Integrally-Attached Timber Plate Structures as the main structural component.\n\nThesis Proposal: Museum Concept from Sustainable Tourism & Architecture to Centers of Education and Cultural Heritage: A Case for Burundi\n\nOverview description for the project: The purpose of the ‘Ethnographic Museum of Gitega’ project is to create an innovative museum renovation concept in view of Building a homegrown cultural revival, while promoting among many issues, new and efficient innovations that help reduce net emissions and create a cleaner environment.\n\nMuseums, “past guardians” of ancient objects or treasures, are generally known to be locations or buildings where art and science artifacts are preserved; kept, and meet the viewers. When examined in more detail, museums are organizations with the mission of investigating the production of humanity along the ages from the viewpoint of science and art to enlighten them about their history in addition to being spaces that present and conserve the treasures of science and art.\n\nBurundi’s national museum is in an anachronistic physical condition. In recent years, the necessity of using renewable and sustainable resources in the building sector has become obvious, and interest in timber as a building material has revived. New timber-derived products such as massif block panels are emerging, and the use of such products has largely increased over the past years. There is a strong global belief in natural sustainable building practices. The vision is to explore the use of architecture as a medium to foster a balance in building that is healthy for the environment and the user, while beautiful in its design.\n\nSustainable tourism has become a travel concept where globally there is an increasing environmental awareness as people wish to visit natural locations rather than man-made tourist destinations. This form of tourism grabs the attention of those interested in ecological and social concerns.\n\nThe tourist is educated about the area and physical landscape; cultural heritage and characteristics, which are the main attractions and provide opportunities to help support local communities or fund economic development and conservation of sites or cultural traditions. With its focus on Burundi’s cultural contributions across the world, this museum would re-open amid a heated debate about reclaiming plundered art that was looted during the colonial era. The scale of artifacts in question is staggering.\n\nUp to 95 percent of Africa’s cultural heritage is held outside Africa by major museums. For example, France alone holds 90,000 sub-Saharan African objects in its museums. UK national institutions the British Museum and Victoria & Albert Museum—which are prohibited by law from removing objects from their collections—are in talks with the Nigerian and Ethiopian authorities to return plundered objects, but only on the basis of long-term loans.\n\nThe science or technology behind this project: Prof. Dr. Yves Weinand –Director of IBOIS laboratory: Architect and civil engineer, Yves Weinand is one of the most recognized researchers in contemporary wood construction. Founder of the Bureau d’Etude Weinand, he has, since 1996, designed and worked on many emblematic wooden buildings, such as the Saint-Loup Chapel, the new Vaudois Parliament, or, more recently, the Pavillon de Vidy in Lausanne.\n\nHis fundamental research questions the technical and static possibilities of wooden materials. The interdisciplinary exploration carried out at the EPFL’s Laboratory for Timber Constructions (Ibois), of which he is director, concerns wood in all its aspects, from round wood to manufactured wood. The recent research carried out at Ibois on free structures with wood-wood connections (without screw nor glue) has been the subject of several technological transfers, and stands as tangible proof of new possibilities for wood construction.\n\nThe project’s approach regards the mechanical requirements of form and structure as attributes that can gain full meaning and sense only in the context of the geometrically scaled phenomenon on which they depend.

He attended university in the U.S.A, Kenya and Switzerland; earning a Bachelor in Management and a Masters in International Business. He now runs Nonara Hotels s.a focusing on hospitality and real estate in Bujumbura, and Nonara Productions Inc, writing and creating film projects for theatrical release in Los Angeles.\n\nAs a voracious reader since childhood, and an avid follower of the philosophical school of Stoicism, he decided on writing as therapy and wrote his first novel, ‘Greener on the Other Side’ to great reception. He followed this feat by writing a short story ‘Recipe for an Escape’ in the anthology: ‘The Gods Who Send Us Gifts’ – by Ivor Agyeman-Duah and Wole Soyinka. He is currently writing the personal memoirs of the University of Burundi’s first Dean, Mr. Nicimpaye Bonaventure, titled: ‘Une Vie au Pas de Course’ –and French Pastor, Franck Pecastaing, an autobiography titled: ‘La Soif de Liberté’\n\nAmong other projects, he plans on completing his sophomore novel, ‘Nights In April’ and ‘Pacific Fleet’, the personal memoirs of Rwandese-born, U.S Navy veteran, Second Class Petty Officer, Yvette Traudel– pertaining to her time in the U.S Navy, the sexual harassment that ensued, and the manner in which she deals with the Post-traumatic stress disorder that has resulted from this experience. Yvette is interested in writing this book now because she has a unique story that needs to be told. The purpose of this book is to educate young girls on some dangers that can arise if they are not careful in life.\n\nLionel is also currently a doctoral candidate at the novel Doctoral school of the University of Burundi under the supervision of Professor Juma Shabani. The aim of the research project is to create a novel museum concept through a philosophical and physical renovation and restoration of the National Museum of Gitega.\n\n~\n\nFigure 1: Christianization of Africa undertaken by the missionaries of Our Lady of Africa better known under the name of the “White Fathers”, under the leadership of Cardinal Lavigerie. – The inhabitants of the south of the Great Lakes region (Rwanda and especially Burundi) who witnessed between the 1850s and the 1890s the passage of a series of foreign expeditions where weird beings with white skin and feet without toes stood out (wrapped in shoes), but comprising hundreds of men sometimes from far away, sometimes from neighboring regions already known.

Though the blood of tribalism so often runs deeper than the waters of baptism, gauging the sufferings of the past allows us to better understand both the tragedies of decolonization and the difficulties of recent decades.\n\nIn the well-known Biblical story, the older brother, Cain, was a cultivator, and Abel, the younger, was a herdsman. They made their offerings to God – Cain from his crops, Abel from his herds. Abel’s portion won God’s appraise; Cain’s did not. So, Cain killed Abel. In Burundi, Hutus were cultivators and Tutsis were herdsmen. This was the original inequality: Cattle are a more valuable assets than produce, and although some Hutus owned cows while some Tutsis tilled the soil, the word Tutsi became synonymous with political and economic elite.\n\nThe application of agricultural policy was the work of cultural intermediaries who – apart from the Church – used coercion. Before the Belgians, Ruanda-Urundi, a former German protectorate practiced agriculture geared mainly towards animal husbandry. These practices which, moreover, were complex had not only an exclusively economic aim; albeit, they responded to social efficacy, they encountered natural, demographic, and socio-political constraints. Clearly, the colonial administration, with their Indirect Rule needed a strong, indigenous king who was committed to the colonial cause. Which is to say that the Belgian colonial administration needed a king who was weak in spite of himself – An antinomian relationship of sorts was forged.\n\nRelations were cordial, but the Tutsi gradually subjugated the Hutu in a feudal system similar to that of medieval Europe. Taking advantage of the status quo, the Belgian colonial administration, having been mandated Ruanda-Urundi by the League of Nations after the first world war, ruled through the Tutsi chiefs and princes. Other reasons for these impositions, officially denied, were aimed at the integration of Burundi in the market economy, and the provision of food to mining companies that worked in the territory. The establishment of coffee plantations and the resulting concentration of wealth in the hands of the Tutsi elite, provoked tensions between the two tribal groups.\n\n2.\n\nThe social, political, and cultural situation resulting from the clash between the indigenous communities and the European settlers was, at some point, to provoke large-scale revolts. These revolts, often located in regions administratively controlled by chiefs established by colonization and badly accepted by the population, begun rapidly gaining ground. Like the one led by a certain Runyota Kanyarufunzo.\n\nIn fact, around 1922, mid-May, an insurrectionary movement broke out in the central and north-eastern regions of the country with Runyota’s signature all over it. The man with supposed magic-religious power advocated the abolition of taxes. Described as a small being with dirty, bushy hair and dressed in antelope skin, he prohibited the wearing of new imported fabrics. Runyota would go on and burn eight customary authorities’ enclosures in less than two months. And to win the sympathy of the local population, he would distribute freely the meat of the raided cattle from the enclosures. This would announce the advent of the new King Ntare and promises to restore to law those who had been robbed of their property by first attacking the Baganwa and Batware whom he accused of collaborating with the white settlers.\n\nWith no less important means: a hundred soldiers armed with three machine guns, commanded by a certain Collette; the bullets which were supposed to turn into water according to the belief inoculated by Runyota to his “fighters” quickly brought the rebellion to a poignant halt. Runyota would be captured at the home of a certain king of the Bushubi. The latter handed him over to the Belgian authorities in October 1922. Runyota was burned alive in Gitega and his ashes thrown into a river while his collaborators seized and punished. Also, from a religious point of view, a large-scale battle against paths and rituals to Christianity was waged by the colonial administration, carrying in its wake a witch hunt.\n\nIn the end, the speed with which the insurgents found supporters shows that if the means of repression had not been strong, the movement would have quickly won over a large part of the country at the risk of weighing more than it did on the mandatory authority of Belgium.\n\nFigure 2: Leaving Mass in Mugera in 1930 (Gitega). This parish of the Catholic mission of Mugera founded on February 11, 1899 by Fathers Desoignies, Van Der Burgt and Van Der Wee, was from 1922 to 1936, the very 1st cathedral in the country as the residence of Archbishop Julien Gorju ((Photo courtesy of Michèle de Coninck)\n\n3.\n\nAs for proper beginnings, on May 1879, Chief Bikari of Rumonge welcomes Fathers Deniaud and Dromaux, the first missionaries to set foot on Burundian soil. Against all expectations, the reception is done in a warm atmosphere and the chief will even accept their gifts before turning around thereafter. In the reprisal which followed, the lives of two white fathers who came after the first two lose their lives at the hand of the natives. Despite this tragedy, the ecclesiastical caravan did not abandon its mission. It continued in Uzige, the current region of Bujumbura headed by chief Rusavya, there too without success. The Missionaries did not intend to throw in the towel in the face of all the hostility from the natives. It is ultimately in Muyaga, in the region of Buyogoma that the intervention of the Germans forcefully subdued the refractory leader Muzazi, which allowed the foundation of the first Catholic mission in Burundi, led by the Dutch Father Johannes Van der Burgt in 1896. Soon after, the missions of Mugera (1899), Buhonga (1902), Kanyinya (1905), Rugari (1909) and Buhoro (1912) were all implanted.\n\nFigure 3: The unifying cult of “Ukubandwa” strongly opposed by Christianization. (Photo courtesy of Michèle de Coninck)\n\nIt is also important to underline the crucial role played by the Church in the training of Burundian intellectuals with in particular the creation of the first school in the history of Burundi, in this case the Petit Séminaire de Mugera created on February 11, 1926. Many other primary and secondary schools would be created thereafter. Lest we forget that the Grand Séminaire of Burasira created in 1951 was for a long time the only institution of academic training in Burundi.\n\nFigure 4: On the mountainous hills of Bujumbura, the Interracial College of the Holy Spirit in 1959 sits above everything else. In the background, the city on the shore of Lake Tanganyika. Nonetheless, racial barriers existed because it was compulsory that natives have a special booklet to travel at night in the urban district inhabited by Europeans, and only the” house-helps “who worked there had it. (Photo courtesy of Michèle de Coninck)\n\nThe origin of the Collège du Saint-Esprit can be traced back to the late 1940’s when the Mwami of Rwanda – the local king- asked the Jesuit fathers to construct a secondary school for the education of Rwanda’s elite youth near the town of Nyanza, which was the traditional seat of power. For the Jesuit fathers this request provided a rare opportunity to develop an educational program for the African students that would be competitive with those in the ‘mother country’. Indeed, in Belgium’s Africa, the official policy in education still was focused almost exclusively on primary education. Under the pressure of Belgium government, and the governor general in particular, the school’s location finally was changed to Bujumbura in Burundi. While arguing that this new situation was economically more sound and allowed for wider geographical recruitment of students, colonial officials no doubt preferred a location closer to the center of colonial administration in order to exercise control over an institution where future elite of Belgium’s Africa was to be trained. The government furthermore insisted that the school be open to all students, basing selection on proven skills rather than origin. As such, the complex became the first ‘collège interracial’ in the region, educating both European and African students, but also Asians and even Muslims, who formed a non-negligible part of society in and around Bujumbura. The initiative was received with notable hostility by anti-Catholic members of Bujumbura’s settler community. In the local press, Belgian settlers or Colons furthermore campaigned against the formation of an African elite whom they regarded as a threat to their own future in Africa.\n\nFigure 5: The swimming pool reserved for “black” Africans in Bujumbura. In the 1950s, there were three swimming pools in Bujumbura. One for Europeans (Entente Sportive), one for Asians and that of Africans in Buyenzi.(Photo courtesy of Michèle de Coninck)\n\nAppearances of deliverance sometimes occasion trouble and perplexity. For instance, Jesus walking on the water, depicted as one of the miracles of Jesus recounted in the new testament – In the well-known story, in the holy bible, following the miracle of the feeding of the five thousand; the legend posits that Jesus sent his disciples by ship back to the ‘other side’ of the sea of Galilee while he remained behind, alone, to pray. Night fell and the sea arose as the ship became caught in a windstorm. After rowing against the wind for most of the night the disciples saw Jesus walking on the water. They were frightened, thinking that they were seeing a spirit, but when Jesus told them not to be afraid, they were reassured. After Jesus entered the ship, the wind ceased, and they arrived at land.\n\nSo why did the black boy drown?\n\nBecause he could not swim!\n\nSwimming lessons are a rite of passage for most European children. But race complicates the splashes, shrieks, and laughter in swimming pools. A warm lake and tropical palm trees are standard icons in tourism images of Bujumbura. So too are hotels with deep blue swimming pools. Surrounded by so much water, one would expect Burundians to be expert swimmers. They are not!\n\nThe majority of swimming pools are now owned by hotels and cater to foreign tourists. Race colors the pools. Most of the people in the pools are white visitors, while those cleaning or serving cocktails at the pool-side bar are natives. Most people in Burundi do not have access to swimming pools. At the ‘collège interracial’ all students learn how to swim as the lessons are part of the curriculum.\n\n4.\n\nRacial segregation was a pillar of Belgian colonial rule. Until the late 1950’s, the colonial authorities discouraged interracial romance and banned interracial marriage before the catholic church. Children born out of parents of mixed color during colonial times were always considered a threat to the colonial enterprise, to profits and to the prestige and domination of the white race. Many white Belgian men, nevertheless, married Burundian women according to local customs, producing children sometimes called métis. But in the eyes of Belgium, these children undermined official segregation policies and blemished the white race’s prestige.\n\nThe historiography of Burundi is the result of a confrontation between two cultures, that of the oral and that of the written one. On the one hand, Burundians have developed a mode of knowledge of the past centered around traditions and legends depicting royalty and society and transmitted from generation to generation. On the other, Europeans, missionaries, or colonizers, were inspired by this local material to write a history of Burundi, at the service of their projects and largely steeped in racial ideologies. The institutionalization of ethnic groups with the colonization and the discriminations that came from it have put into question the equilibrium of the national community, triggering a wave of extreme and endemic violence since its independence.\n\n*\n\nUnder Belgian supervision since the 1920s, Ruanda-Urundi, became a republic in 1961, and split in two in July 1962. One of the two states born of this split was Burundi, whose capital is Bujumbura (ex -Usumbura).\n\nWhile the march towards independence for Rwanda was punctuated by ethnic tensions between Tutsi and Hutu and violent confrontations, Burundi was progressing in a climate of relative stability. Despite the desire of the United Nations to see the territory of Ruanda-Urundi remain unified, separate steps were taken. The Party of Unity and Social Progress (UPRONA) of Louis Rwagasore Mwambutsa, winner of the elections held on September 18, 1961, played a central role in Burundi. Louis became prime minister. Rwagasore, who was the eldest son of the sovereign, the one who was supposed to lead Burundi into independence, after studying administration and agronomy in Belgium, where he met African students from all over the continent and quickly took the lead in Burundi’s anti-colonial movement.\n\nHe became popular through his charisma and his ability as a strategist. Rwagasore was a skilled diplomat and a great unifier. He impressed Burundians firstly by his spirit of initiative, with the creation of agricultural cooperatives that were supposed to give Burundians back control over production and by putting an end to the monoculture of coffee. He also had strong relationships with great figures of African independence. The Prince met Congo’s Patrice Lumumba several times, he exchanged letters with Egypt’s Gamal Abdel Nasser and he developed his political project thanks to his friend Julius Nyerere. The cooperatives project failed, but it made him famous and he created his party, the National Progress and Unity Party in 1958 with a very diversified militant base, also, marring a beautiful woman of the opposite ethnic tribe.\n\nLest we forget to mention, in the run-up to independence, Rwagasore was declared prime minister. Just weeks later, he was assassinated on October 13, 1961 by a Greek sharpshooter. Independence, to which Belgium was favorable, was proclaimed on July 1, 1962.\n\nSince independence, Burundi had become a constitutional monarchy. Legislative elections were held on May 10, 1965. Despite the success of Hutu candidates, the majority ethnic group in Burundi, King Mwambutsa IV chose a Tutsi, Léopold Biha, as Prime Minister. Although a minority, the Tutsis traditionally control politics and the army. Shortly after Biha’s swearing-in on October 13, Hutu officers attempted a failed coup. In retaliation, severe repression was exercised against the Hutus. It was in this tense context that, on July 8, 1966, the heir to the throne Charles Ndizeye overthrew his father, King Mwambutsa IV. According to the new king, who would bear the name of Ntare V, the country lacked leadership in addition to being afflicted by corruption. Ntare V promised a new Constitution and dismissed Biha to succeed Captain Michel Micombero of Tutsi origin. Micombero, who was also Minister of Defense, made sure to place allies in the cabinet. Worried about the prospect of a coup, Ntare V was considering the possibility of disposing of his prime minister. However, he took control of the situation and overthrew the king on November 28, 1966. The monarchy was abolished and Micombero became president of the Republic of Burundi. He established an authoritarian regime with a single party, the Union for National Progress. The country would adopt a model of socialist development and benefit from the support of China. In 1969, an attempted overthrow against Micombero was severely repressed, particularly with executions. Conflicts broke out again in 1972 between Hutus and Tutsis, degenerating into massacres of an unprecedented scale in Burundi. Micombero was in turn overthrown by a coup on November 1, 1976.\n\nThe military’s emergence as the central power broker gave many Burundians cause for concern. Its involvement in party politics had been at the center of Burundi’s complicated conflicts: the 1972 genocide against Hutus, the 1993 genocide against Tutsis, the 1993–2005 civil war, and revenge killings in between and since. The Arusha peace process mediated by former Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere and former South African President Nelson Mandela focused on three priorities: creating an apolitical military, de-ethicizing politics, equitable power-sharing, representation, and ethnic coalition-building.\n\nNevertheless, the racial theories formulated in the wake of colonization are part of the general speech in this country and feed the supremacist positions of men of power and of a certain part of the population. Thus, the past is called upon to justify massacres and to absolve revenge. Ethnicity has become pretense and a mean to poach power. A prominent European-Burundian intellectual justified the massacre of young Tutsis in 2015 by the obligation of revenge of the fathers killed in 1972. It is important to recall that we were in 2015 when the intellectuals proclaimed that statement, years after the genocide against the Tutsis in 1993 which killed 300,000 victims. What would be the right number to pay the blood debt and quench the spirit of revenge if 300,000 Tutsi deaths are not enough. Proof that the Burundian problem exceeds us and is more complicated than the aspiration to the rule of law which is the solution, but so elusive. Even in Rwanda, after a million Tutsi deaths, the genocidaires are mobilizing and organizing to finalize the final solution.\n\nWhat to do in these conditions? This dichotomy of suffering proves that we find ourselves in a centuries-old nation that no longer exists since the importation of the Rwandan ideology of the genocide against the Tutsis. By the strength of the Rwandan genocidal ideology, we have become one nation and two peoples. A man as rigorous and experienced as former President Bagaza said that the only solution was the partition of the country in ‘Hutuland and ‘Tutsiland. He added with quite military precision, “in any case, the partition is already de facto since we have the majority people who have the right to live on earth and the minority condemned to live underground”. The thesis of the partition of the country was developed for the first time by the American Ambassador to Burundi in 1972, Patrick Melady, in the pragmatic spirit of which the Americans are fond. Despite Bagaza’s cold military insight and Ambassador Melady’s gringo pragmatism, the most virtuous solution in human life and economic prosperity is the rule of law. The rule of law is the solution, but the rule of law is like the gospel of Christ: love one another. Easier said than done. It was the dream when the late President Nkurunziza arrived in 2005. The small Tutsi people had breathed a sigh of relief at the time, because they believed that they would no longer be massacred for a policy of distant Burundi which they has nothing to do with their misery. Alas, Burundian history has been an eternal restart for 60 years. One must kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, not just kill, kill innocent women and children. The rule of law is really the one and only solution, because in a rule of law there is neither Hutu nor Tutsi, but citizens. The existential question that arises is how to get there since only evil has triumphed in Burundi since independence.\n\n*\n\nI may be an atypical Burundian, but I do not make a distinction in suffering, because, truth be told, there is no ethnic suffering, but human suffering. I am even convinced that there are no ethnic groups in Burundi, because the only ethnic groups that exist are the rich and the poor. Everything else is political manipulation. Christianity was an agent of great change in Africa. This has destabilized the status quo, offering new opportunities to some and by weakening the power of others. With Christian missions, education, literacy, and people’s hope appeared. However, the dissemination of Christianity opened the way for commercial speculators and, in its original rigid European form, robbed people of their pride in their culture and their ceremonies.\n\nPeoples, rarely and with great difficulty recognize their errors and their responsibility in historical crimes because it was done in the name of people; the Belgian people, God, Hutu or Tutsi — and symbolic, because it doesn’t efface the aftermath of the colonization.\n\nFin.\n\nSources:\n\nMelchior Mukuri (1990), Les Transformations de l’Agriculture au Burundi sous la Colonisation Belge (1924 -1959).

But perhaps fundamental to the essence of America has been the concept of the American Dream. It has captured the imagination of people from all walks of life and represents the heart and soul of the country.\n\nThe American Dream has served as a road map for the way we often envision the course of our lives. The rules of the game are well-known, as is the bargain that is struck. For those willing to work hard and take advantage of their opportunities, there is the expectation of a prosperous and fulfilling life. The United States has long been epitomized as a land of equal opportunity, where hard work and skill can result in personal success and fulfillment, regardless of one’s station in life. While the specifics of each dream vary from person to person, the overall vitality of the American Dream has been fundamental to the nation’s identity.\n\nIt can be found throughout our culture and history. It lies at the heart of Ben Franklin’s common wisdom chronicled in Poor Richard’s Almanack, in the words of Emma Lazurus etched onto the Statue of Liberty, the poetry of Carl Sandburg, or the soaring oratory of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. It can be heard in the music of Aaron Copland or jazz innovator Charlie Parker. And it can be seen across skylines from Manhattan to Chicago to San Francisco. Yet it can also be found in the most humble of places. It lies in the hopes of a single mother struggling on a minimum wage job to build a better life for herself and her children. It rests upon the unwavering belief of a teenager living on some forgotten back road that one day he or she will find fortune and fame. And it is present in the efforts and sacrifices of a first generation American family to see their kids through college.\n\nIn many respects, the American Dream has been deeply rooted in the concept of a journey-the journey to a new country, the journey across generations, and of course, the journey within one’s life. It is about motion and progress, it is about optimism, and it is about finding success and fulfillment along the way. And yet the conditions under which Americans have pursued this Dream have been fraught with risk and economic uncertainty.\n\nThe settlers of the eighteenth, nineteenth, and twentieth centuries took enormous risks coming to the new world, often arriving with little more than the clothes on their backs. Once here, there was not much in the way of government help or financial assistance (with the exception of available land). Self-reliance, rugged individualism, and determination were seen as the keys to prosperity. And yet, in spite of the risks and struggles, the American Dream has been, and continues to be, a guiding force reflecting the manner in which we see our lives unfolding. Turn on the television, listen to the radio, surf the Internet, or pick up a magazine while waiting in an airport, and the images of the American Dream are ever present. From the solidly middle class couple engaged in their careers and lifestyle, to the rags to riches superstar making millions of dollars each year, the American Dream is portrayed as attainable, as long as we commit ourselves to hard work and perseverance in striving toward our goals.\n\nThe American Dream has ultimately been about the manner in which our lives unfold and the ability of the individual, no matter where he or she comes from, to exert considerable control and freedom over how that process occurs. In a sense, it is about being able to live out our individual biographies to their fullest extent.\n\nFor more than three centuries, the hallmark of liberalism has been the attempt to promote individual liberty. Liberalism is a group of political, social and economic theories that centers on the values of individual liberty, equality, economic freedom, limited and democratic government and the rule of law. Words such as liberal, liberty, libertarian and libertine all trace their history to the Latin liber, which means “free”. Liberalism holds that all individuals should have equal treatment before the law regardless of social status, race or sex. Some important liberties in modern liberal states include freedom of speech, press, religion and association. Liberty is constrained by the harm principle, which states that you have liberty as long as you do not harm others. Liberty is a political concept that refers to freedom from undue or oppressive restraints on a person’s actions, thoughts or beliefs imposed by the state.\n\nThe modern ideology of Liberalism can be traced back to the Humanism which challenged the authority of the established church in Renaissance Europe, and more particularly to the 17th and 18th Century British and French Enlightenmentthinkers, and the movement towards self-government in colonial America. John Locke’s “Two Treatises on Government” of 1689 established two fundamental liberal ideas: economic liberty (meaning the right to have and use property) and intellectual liberty (including freedom of conscience). His natural rights theory (“natural rights” for Locke being essentially life, liberty and property) was the distant forerunner of the modern conception of human rights, although he saw the right to property as more important than the right to participate in government and public decision-making, and he did not endorse democracy, fearing that giving power to the people would erode the sanctity of private property. Nevertheless, the idea of natural rights played a key role in providing the ideological justification for the American and the French revolutions, and in the further development of Liberalism.\n\n“all men are created equal. . . . ” This phrase caused some embarrassment when the Declaration was issued, for a number of colonists, American “patriots” as well as pro-British “tories,” pointed out that it was hypocritical for a slaveholding country to proclaim the equality of all mankind. In England Dr. Samuel Johnson criticized Washington, Jefferson, and other slaveholding colonists for their hypocrisy: “How is it that we hear the loudest yelps for liberty among the drivers of Negroes?” In fact, Jefferson, a slave-owner himself, included a sharp attack on the slave trade in his original draft of the Declaration. This section was removed by other members of Congress, however, while the claim that all men are created equal remained.\n\nAMERICA: chronology of key events –\n\n1565 – First permanent European settlement in North America – St Augustine, present-day Florida – founded by the Spanish.
