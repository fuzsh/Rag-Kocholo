        "text": "Burundi is a country in the Great Rift Valley that exists where East Africa and the African Great Lakes region meet. It is a landlocked country that is bordered by Rwanda, Tanzania, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Lake Tanganyika. The capital was Bujumbura, but changed to Gitega in February of 2019. Burundi is home to the Twa, Hutu and Tutsi peoples, existing as an independent kingdom until the beginning of the 20th century. Burundi won its independence in 1962, eventually establishing a one-party state in 1966. Today, Burundiâ€™s political system consists of a presidential representative democratic republic founded on a multi-party state. The President of Burundi serves as both the head of government and the head of state."
