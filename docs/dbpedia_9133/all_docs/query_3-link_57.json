        "text": "City Spotlight: Mukaza Commune\n\nMukaza Commune is one of three communes that make up Bujumbura Mairie Province, the economic capital of Burundi. It lies at Lake Tanganyika, close to the border with the Democratic Republic of Congo and has a rapidly growing population of over 250,000 people. It is home to a significant number of migrants from both within and outside Burundi. The Commune is actively involved in various initiatives that aim to promote good governance, peace, security and the development of its local population, and has aligned these activities with Burundi’s Security and Development Plan 2020-2024. Mukaza Commune first engaged with Strong Cities Network in an April 2023 workshop that the East and Southern Africa (ESA) Regional Hub held in Bujumbura for mayors from across Burundi on their role in preventing hate, extremism and polarisation. Mayor Renovat Sindayehebura of Mukaza participated in this engagement, noting that “our capacity as leaders can be built from the interactions” Strong Cities facilitates. He additionally participated in a Strong Cities regional workshop in Johannesburg (South Africa) in June 2023.\n\nWhat is the local government concerned about?\n\nMukaza Commune faces several challenges that stem largely from the aftermath of the Burundian Civil War (1993 – 2005) between the country’s primary ethnic groups, the Hutus and Tutsis. Challenges include ongoing ethnic divisions, high levels of youth unemployment, high rates of urban crime such as theft and robbery, limited resources for emergency response, a large population influx due to Mukaza’s prime location in the centre of Bujumbura Mairie Province, which serves as both the country’s economic capital a regional trade hub. Terrorist recruitment and activity also remains a concern, particularly with Al-Shabaab having previously made threats against the country.\n\nHow is the local government responding?\n\nTo address these challenges, the Commune has developed and started implementing a “Good Governance, Peace, Security, and Prosperity as an Involvement of All” initiative, which aims to restore the traditional African concept of “ubuntu”, or humanity and harmony, by emphasising the importance of working together for the prosperity of the Commune and country as a whole. The initiative includes various long-term commitments to foster cohesion and improve the safety and security of all residents. These include:\n\nRegular community meetings and workshops to promote dialogue within the population. This gives residents the opportunity to participate in decision-making and to inform everything from urban planning (e.g., where there needs to be better street lighting to ensure residents feel safe) to the social activities delivered. The Commune has also established a Joint Communal Security Committee which brings residents together with law enforcement officers and the local government, strengthening mutual cooperation and trust.\n\nThe delivery of urban improvement activities in partnership with the wider community. The Commune recognises that its physical safety and urban design can build resilience by helping residents feel provided for and has thus invested in urban improvement programmes. This includes a health and sanitation programme to portray the Commune as a healthy, safe and liveable area, weekly mobilisation of the population for community work (e.g., community clean-up activities), campaigns about healthy living and investments in better drinking water, housing and security measures, such as public street lighting.\n\nA youth engagement pillar through which the Commune promotes education, sports and cultural activities and seeks ensure that youth are engaged proactively to prevent them from resorting to harmful behaviours, such as (violent) crime. This has culminated into the formation of 30 youth cooperative groups throughout the Commune."
