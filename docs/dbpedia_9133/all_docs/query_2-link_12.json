        "text": "Burundi -- History\n\n5th TO 11th CENTURIES AD: Bahutu agriculturalists migrate into the region and dominate the indigenous tribal groups, including the Batwa. 14th TO 18th CENTURIES AD: Tutsi cattle-herders arrive. Among the first are the Banyaruguru from the North; later, in the 17th and 18th centuries, the Bahima group comes from the East.\n\n1858 Richard Burton and John Hanning Speke explore the Ruzizi river. 1885 King Leopold of Belgium establishes a claim to the Congo region; Rwanda and Burundi become part of German East Africa.\n\n1892 Oscar Baumann explores northern and central Burundi.\n\n1898-1903 German troops attack Mwezi Gisabo and force him to sign the Treaty of Kiganda on May 24, 1903, recognizing German authority.\n\n1907 The first Protestant missions are founded.\n\n1910 Borders between German East Africa, the Belgian Congo and British East Africa are established.\n\n1919 Belgium is granted mandate over Ruanda-Urundi by the Allied Supreme Council.\n\n1922 The League of Nations awards Belgium mandate over Ruanda-Urundi, which it accepts in 1924.\n\n1928 - 29 Famines ravage Burundi.\n\n1934 A major Bahutu revolt at Ndora is suppressed.\n\n1946 The United Nations General assembly approves a proposition making Ruanda-Urundi a Belgian trust territory.\n\n1955 The Progressive Democratic Movement, a political association, is denied legal status.\n\n1959 A serious outbreak of violence between the Bahutu and the Batutsi occurs in Rwanda; thousands of Batutsi flee into Burundi, increasing ethnic tension there.\n\n1960 In January the UPRONA (Unit et Progrès National party), established by Rwagasore, is officially registered. UPRONA holds its congress in March and by December demands independence. Burundi undergoes a political awakening during this time. More than 20 political parties are formed and a temporary commission replaces the High Council of the country.\n\n1961 In January a Bahutu coup d'ètat is staged in Rwanda and a Republican government is established. In April the UN overturns the elections of 1960 and invalidates local government organizations established under the Belgians. During September, elections are held under UN supervision. UPRONA wins 58 out of 64 seats in the National Assembly, half of them going to Bahutu representatives. Rwagasore is elected Prime Minister. On October 13 Rwagasore is assassinated. A Batutsi, Ganwa Andr Muhirwa, is appointed Prime Minister, but proves a weak leader.\n\n1962 On June 20 the UN General Assembly votes to allow Ruanda-Urundi to become two independent nations. Rwanda is to be a republic led by Bahutus, while Burundi is to retain a ceremonial head of state called the mwami, and is dominated by Batutsis. On July 1 independence is declared, with Mwami Mwambutsa as head of state and Muhirwa as Prime Minister. In November a retrial of the assassins of Rwagasore is conducted and five opponents of UPRONA are found guilty of the crime.\n\n1963 The execution of Rwagasore's assassins is carried out on January 15. UPRONA is sharply divided into two ethnic factions, Batutsi and Bahutu."
