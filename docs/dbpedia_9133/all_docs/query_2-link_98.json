        "text": "General Overview\n\nImplementation of the Transition Government\n\nOn 1 November President Pierre Buyoya was sworn in to head the first half of a three-year transitional power-sharing government in Burundi. Several Heads of State and the mediator, former South-African President Nelson Mandela - who negotiated the formation of the new government -, South African Deputy President Jacob Zuma, and OAU Secretary-General Amara Essy were among the guests at the inauguration ceremony. The constitution of the transition government had already been adopted by Burundi's parliament on 27 October. Mediators hope that the transition government will restore peace to the country after eight years of civil war. A ceasefire agreement with the armed opposition, crucial to attaining sustainable peace, has not been reached so far and remains a major challenge ahead for the new government. The fact that the armed opposition groups Force for the Defence of Democracy (FDD) and National Liberation Forces (FNL) announced on 25 November that they were adopting a joint negotiating position is regarded as a positive development by many observers.\n\nDuring the first week of November a contingent of 700 South African militaries arrived in Bujumbura, forming the core of the special unit to offer protection to returning politicians who were in exile so far, and who are expected to take part in the transitional government and state institutions. The South Africans will also train an all-Burundian protection force. The UN Security Council reaffirmed its support for the establishment of the transitional government and urged the international donors to honour their pledges made at a Paris conference in December 2000.\n\nAssassination of the WHO Representative to Burundi\n\nThe Humanitarian community in Burundi is still shocked and deeply saddened by the assassination of the WHO Representative to Burundi, Dr. Kassi Manlan. Dr. Manlan, a national of Ivory Coast died at the age of 53. He had been reported missing since the morning of 20 November. In the late afternoon of the same day his body was found in Lake Tanganyika. A memorial service in Bujumbura's main church was held on 23 November and was well attended by government representatives, United Nations staff, donors and members of the international and national humanitarian community. Meanwhile, security measures to further improve protection all UN international staff have been put in place, including regular night patrols. A stress counsellor from UNSECOORD has assisted those, who were most affected by Dr. Manlan's death. Investigations by a specially appointed governmental commission are being carried out and have not yet reached any conclusion.\n\nVulnerable populations\n\nInternally Displaced Populations\n\nAfter the passage of armed opposition groups through the east and northeast of the country and frequent fighting with government military forces, more than 3,200 new displaced were registered in Ruyigi province, over half of whom were children, and some 6,000 in Muyinga province further north. Humanitarian actors on the ground provided them with basic return packages consisting of food, and, where necessary, shelter materials and non-food items.\n\nDuring the first 10 days of November an armed group kidnapped 31 children from a school in Ruyigi between the ages of 13 and 16 and marched them through Gitega, Ruyigi and Cankuzo. Some of the children were used as carriers. Most of these children could flee when not being observed. In Kayanza province some 95 high-school pupils were kidnapped on 8/9 November. While the majority of these children have escaped, some had not returned by end of November. The humanitarian community helps to trace the families of the kidnapped school children and provides psychosocial support, wherever necessary, in addition to responding to emergency needs by distributing food assistance and school supplies to the schools that were attacked.\n\nProtection of Internally Displaced\n\nA field mission of the Follow-up Technical Group of the Framework for the Protection of IDPs conducted a field mission on 13/14 November to IDP camps in Bubanza province (after field visits to Bujumbura Rural and Gitega in September and October) to assess their general living conditions and to follow up on recent displacements of several thousand people, which occurred in early October. Mission findings and recommendations are similar to those made after assessments in the other two provinces and include better protection and accommodation of newly displaced populations, preparation for their reinstallation, creation of income generation schemes, facilitation of access to farming lands and access to basic education free of charge.\n\nRefugees\n\nBetween 12 and 15 November UNHCR facilitated an Inter-Agency follow-up mission to the northern provinces of Muyinga, Ngozi and Kirundo with the aim to evaluate the conditions of reception and re-integration of refugees returning from Tanzania. The mission was composed of representatives from Unicef, the office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, (OHCHRB), UNHCR Burundi and Tanzania. They met with NGOs on the ground, local and provincial authorities and interviewed returnees in reception and transit camps to assess:\n\nGeneral security issues\n\nAccessibility for humanitarian actors to the three provinces without military escort\n\nIssues relating to the reintegration and peaceful co-existence between the communities concerned, i.e. returnees, IDPs and the local population\n\nAfter analysing their findings, the mission expressed concern about the insecurity along the route from the refugee camps in Tanzania to entry points in Burundi, particularly for small groups and individuals who repatriate spontaneously. To assist vulnerable spontaneous returnees the mission recommended to reinforce the cross-border spontaneous repatriation monitoring and verification system and to harmonise the returnee statistics for both UNHCR Tanzania and Burundi. In addition, the July 2001 Action Plan for Voluntary Repatriation developed by humanitarian actors working with refugees in Burundi and Tanzania is to be strengthened for the northern provinces.\n\nSECTORS\n\nAgriculture and Food Security\n\nFAO and partner organisations have successfully completed the countrywide seeds distribution for the September 2001 to January 2002 season (2002 A season). FAO reported on 20 November that a total of 201,350 vulnerable households (over one million individuals) had received seeds for planting. Hoes could not be distributed to each household due to a shortage of these tools. To ensure that seeds for planting were not eaten, WFP distributed complementing Seed Protection Rations to food insecure families, mainly through the NGO CARE. Over 120,055 households (600,274 individuals) for the first time received 20-day rations, to cover their food consumption needs as opposed to the 10 or 15 day rations previously distributed for season 2001B. A joint evaluation of FAO, WFP, UNICEF and the Ministry of Agriculture, assessing the 2002 A food and crop supply is scheduled to take place in December.\n\nA joint WFP and FAO evaluation of the Seed Protection Programme, conducted between 4 and 23 November in the provinces of Karuzi, Kayanza, and Gitega, aimed to evaluate the impact and adequacy of the programme, and to further develop a detailed profile of vulnerability criteria for the February to July 2002 B.\n\nFood Assistance\n\nWFP Food Economy Assessment teams recommended that some 17,200 households (86,000 vulnerable beneficiaries) in the northern province of Muyinga receive targeted rations of food assistance. In Rutana province, recommendations for food aid included 35,628 beneficiaries, including repatriates, displaced persons, and those affected by hail.\n\nMonitoring teams also reviewed the operations of social centres under the Quick Action Programme (QAP). This project is designed to serve particularly vulnerable populations, such as widows, the disabled, and orphan headed households. QAP centres must have a component, which encourages increased self-reliance, through training, for example. 28 centres have been reviewed so far and 16 will be allowed to remain on the Programme.\n\nIncreased insecurity during November has meant that WFP was able to reach only 29,9% of planned recipients (111,883 actual beneficiaries versus 374,094 anticipated for the month).\n\nHEALTH\n\nNutrition\n\nLatest data on malnutrition from end October (836 patients treated in Therapeutic Feeding Centres; 40,744 beneficiaries receiving supplementary nurture at Supplementary Feeding Centres) have been analysed in more detail. UNICEF reports that, while the numbers of beneficiaries continue to decrease, numbers of new admissions show a slight increase, particularly in provinces that have recently been affected by insecurity, such as Bujumbura Rural and Rutana. A nutritional study in the province of Rutana of the 80% of the population that was accessible showed that the rate of global acute malnutrition in the province had risen to 19,2% compared to the average global acute malnutrition rate in the entire country of 7%. A less significant increase in admissions to Supplementary Feeding Centres (SFC) was seen in the provinces of Cibitoke, Gitega, Muramvya, Mwaro, Cankuzo, and Kirundo.\n\nHIV/AIDS\n\nIn November the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has launched a campaign on HIV/AIDS prevention, AIDS testing and medical support for those suffering from opportunistic diseases linked to AIDS for inmates in various prisons in the country. Official statistics place AIDS as the first cause of adult mortality in Burundi, with 40,000 people killed by AIDS in 2000 alone. UNAIDS estimates that there are at least 230,000 AIDS orphans in the country.\n\nEDUCATION\n\nOn 31 August, before the beginning of the new school year, the Government of Burundi passed a decree decentralising responsibility for identifying the most needy children and the provision of school fees, materials and uniforms to the community-level authorities. The Government criteria for the most needy children include those displaced and repatriated, orphans, child heads of household and extremely impoverished children. As hundreds of thousands of children in Burundi fit into these categories and the communities do not have sufficient resources to meet needs, many children remain without access to education, making the need for outside assistance evident. UN Agencies active in the sectors and NGOs are distributing school supplies to the most needy children and work with the Ministry of Education to come up with a joint strategy to ensure that the neediest children receive support for their education.\n\nAmong others, the Follow-up Technical Group of the Framework for the Protection of IDPs has raised this issue after field visits to various provinces, demanding that a representative of the Ministry of Education joins them on assessment missions and strongly recommending that access to basic education should be provided free of charge.\n\nThe UNICEF Girls Education project continues to make progress in the 4 pilot provinces of Kirundo, Muyinga, Ngozi and Gitega. Awareness-raising by the Ministry of Education and the African Girl's Education Initiative (AGEI) Steering Committee are targeted toward girls and women to empower them to seek an education. Through these campaigns, the negative effect of the ongoing conflict particularly on girls and women is starkly evident. This project seeks to counteract these trends through a multi-sector approach that addresses both cultural and material factors that keep girls and women uneducated.\n\nPromotion of Human Rights\n\nOn 21 November the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights in Burundi (OHCHRB) signed an agreement to reinforce the capacities of 28 local rights associations in the country. Activities include the provision of additional human rights training for the staff of these associations, improvement of the associations' organisational skills, and the provision of office equipment.\n\nOn 30 October, UNICEF signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Government of Burundi, represented by the Minister of Human Rights, on the issue of child soldiers. The MOU acknowledges the problem of child soldiers in Burundi and outlines activities that will allow UNICEF and partners to conduct a thorough study of the situation of child soldiers and conduct a large-scale awareness raising campaign and develop a program for demobilization and reintegration of child soldiers into the community in collaboration with the Government, UN Agencies and NGOs in 2002.\n\nCoordination\n\nCAP 2002\n\nThe Consolidated Inter Agency Appeal for Burundi was launched on 27 November in Brussels. The CAP 2002 seeks a total of US$ 107,865,224 to address immediate humanitarian needs and to assist Burundians to bridge the gap towards a period of transition.\n\nProvinces\n\nCibitoke\n\nParticipants of a provincial focal point meeting held in October described the security situation as stable. Yields of the July to September 2001 C agriculture season have been disappointing. An assessment to follow up on the nutritional situation was scheduled for November. Health structures have recently been reinforced through the establishment of a 6th communal pharmacy. An additional centre for unaccompanied children has been opened. A provincial plan of action is to be developed, which will enable all humanitarian and development actors on the ground to improve coordination of their activities.\n\nBubanza\n\nA focal point meeting held in October discussed the possibility of establishing sector coordination meetings for the sectors of health, education, as well as agriculture and livestock. As the NGO International Rescue Committee (IRC) ended its activities in the province, a new organization conducting activities in the water and sanitation sector, where needs remain great, is urgently sought for.\n\nMwaro\n\nThe overall security situation in the province is good. However, there were pockets of insecurity in areas bordering the provinces of Bururi in the south and Bujumbura Rural in the west. UNDP presented its Community Development Project for the Fight Against Poverty. The project will focus on income generating activities, local capacity building and the rehabilitation of public infrastructures, particularly in the sectors health, education and water and sanitation.\n\nSECURITY ISSUES\n\nThe security situation has become more precarious since the instauration of the transitional government. The delivery of humanitarian assistance has become more difficult, as a significant increase of violent assaults has been observed countrywide, with the rebel groups of FNL and FDD active in several locations. In the last decade of November, fighting moved close to the capital, with armed opposition firmly entrenched in Tenga Forest/Bujumbura Rural, bordering Kinama in the outskirts of Bujumbura.\n\nThe passage of armed opposition groups through the east and northeast of the country and frequent skirmishes with government military forces, left hamlets looted and/or burnt in the provinces of Ruyigi, Gitega, Cankuzo, and for the first time after years of calm, also in Muyinga. The series of attacks were launched in the province of Ruyigi, resulted in the destruction of schools, health centres and administrative buildings. There are rising concerns about mines in certain areas of the province close to the border.\n\nMISSIONS AND APPOINTMENTS\n\n29 November - 12 December: Visit by Marie-Therese Keita-Bocoum, Special Rapporteur on the Human Rights situation in Burundi. On her 5th official mission to Burundi, Keita-Bocoum is scheduled to meet executives of the Burundian transition government, parliamentarians, as well as members of the diplomatic corps, international and national human rights organisations, security experts, and representatives of a number of organisations involved in peace and reconciliation activities.\n\n05 December: Arrival of Piero Calvi-Parisetti as interim head of office, OCHA Burundi until 04 January 2002.\n\nOCHA Burundi, December 2001"
