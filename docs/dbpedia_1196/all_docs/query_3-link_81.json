        "text": "WILDERNESS GIANT EDITION: BOOK FIVE\n\nThe Trail West\n\nNate King was a master trapper, a loyal friend and an almost legendary grizzly killer. But when a rich Easterner hired the bravest of all the frontiersmen to guide him to the virgin lands west of the Rockies, Nate found his life threatened by hostile Indians, back-shooters and renegade settlers out to rob him and his party. If he failed to meet every challenge and defeat every enemy - he and those he loved would perish. Published November 22, 2017Recommended Price: $3.50/ &pound2.75 WILDERNESS GIANT EDITION: BOOK FOUR\n\nOrdeal\n\nBack before the poison of civilization had corrupted the wilds of the Rocky Mountains, brave mountain men struggled to carve a life from virgin land. But few of these hardy souls had ventured beyond the mountains to the Oregon Territory and the vast Pacific Ocean. Lewis and Clark, Kit Carson and other living legends blazed trails through the unknown regions, often leading settlers. When one party of pioneers disappeared, Nate King and his mentor, Shakespeare McNair, were hired to track them down. The perils along the way were unending, but if Shakespeare and Nate survived, they would earn the greatest reward imaginable - the courage to live free. Published January 15, 2017Recommended Price: $3.50/ &pound2.45 WILDERNESS GIANT EDITION: BOOK THREE\n\nPrairie Blood\n\nWhen America was still a wild land, tough mountain men like Nathaniel King dared to venture into the majestic Rockies. When Nate and his family get separated due to a monster storm they all have to muster up their wits and find a way to see each other again. A desperate search is mounted to save his son, Zach before he falls victim to untold perils. Without his son, the life Nate has struggled to build seems worthless. Published July 15, 2016Recommended Price: $3.50/ &pound2.30 WILDERNESS GIANT EDITION: BOOK TWO\n\nSeason of the Warrior\n\nUndaunted by the countless threats that imperiled them, Nathaniel King and other brave mountain men struggled to build a life unfettered by the corruption of society. It was a fight to the death, and only the strong could hope to survive. But when a group of English travelers journeyed into the Rockies, they had no defense against the fierce Indians, deadly beasts, and hostile elements. If Nate and his friend Shakespeare McNair couldn't save them, the young adventurers would suffer unimaginable pain before facing certain death. Published April 15, 2016Recommended Price: $3.50/ &pound2.30 WILDERNESS GIANT EDITION: BOOK ONE\n\nHawken Fury\n\nWhile the United States was still a new nation, some cities had already grown into bustling, overcrowded metropolises gripped by corruption. There a young man had little chance of ever realizing the great American Dream of liberty. It took immense courage for men like Nathaniel King to venture into the vast territories west of the Mississippi River. Although they had to fight an endless battle against savage Indians, wild beast, and the hostile elements, the freedom that these bold adventures won in the unexplored region was worth the struggle. But when an old sweetheart from New York came searching for him, King learned that sometimes the deadliest foe could appear to be a trusted friend. And if he wasn't careful, the life he had worked so hard to build might be stolen from him and traded away for a few pieces of gold. Published January 15, 2016Recommended Price: $3.50/ &pound2.30"
