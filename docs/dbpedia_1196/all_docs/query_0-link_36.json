        "text": "Kevin Lynch emphasized that, urban design is a kind of “art of time”, yet contemporary thought in design often forgets this fourth dimension – time. We move through time just as inevitably as we move through space, and via the rules of Einstein's relativity, our motion through space and time are inextricable from one another. In our hyper accelerated 24-hour news cycle of thoughts and propaganda designers - and really people in general - constantly ignore the realities of time and the basic concept that we must crawl before we walk, yet alone, we run. As a landscape architect and designer, many of my projects offer almost instant gratification and are completed in at most a couple of years. As a planner, the opposite is the case, and I am in for the long haul as these projects can go on for a decade or more. It’s a passion of patience that’s centered around sound design. I have now practiced long enough to see the cycles of trends and gimmicks that pass across the drawing boards and are endlessly pontificated on in journals and online. In the end it always comes back to the basics and a framework for development that is adaptable and flexible enough to accommodate options over time. You may ask what sparked this commentary…I was speaking with a friend about projects I have been fortunate enough to work on around the globe and the fact that I get to watch them develop over time via google earth. I recognize that none of these projects will be built exactly as I designed them, however, I can always see that critical framework that set the stage for development and has allowed them to flourish. Its cliché, but these projects really are like children. We give them all the support, direction, and structure we can and hope they grow to be everything we wanted them to be and more. These images are of a project I designed at RTKL a little over 20 years. The City of Hefei is the provincial capital of the Anhui Provence of China. This new central business district provides for a seamless integration of living, playing, shopping, and sightseeing within a beautiful green framework that serves as the hub of the developing city. Six key elements defined the master plan: 1. The centrally located “great lawn,” arranges cultural, civic and commercial land uses on a grand mall. 2. The east west “Grand Waterway” accommodates a range of uses, is a central landmark, and provides for both active and pastoral environments. 3. The \"retail core\" is an east west corridor with distinct nodes. 4. The “Emerald Necklace” is a community scaled urban greenway that embraces the district. This includes a series of pastoral and active open spaces. 5. Four “Neighborhood Districts” provide a range of residential typologies. The neighborhoods are defined by pedestrian friendly streetscapes, humanistic scaled buildings, and the greenspaces. 6. Located throughout the neighborhoods are a series of centralized “Themed Parks” that serve as local destinations. #davidrobbinsdeigns"
