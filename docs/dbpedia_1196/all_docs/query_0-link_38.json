        "text": "Do you hate snakes? I believe that most Americans would say they do hate them. The primordial fear/loathing must have begun in the Garden of Eden. You know the story: the serpent entered the Garden to tempt Eve to eat from the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil. God had told Eve and Adam not to eat from this tree but the serpent used cunning to persuade Eve to do it, anyway. Adam ate the forbidden fruit, also. Thus, God pronounced judgment on Adam and Eve, as well as on the serpent. God placed a cursed the snake to crawl on its belly, eat dust, and to live in enmity with mankind forever. That is the Cliffs-Notes version of events. But, not everyone hates and fears snakes.\n\nI am a 55-year old man and am in my second marriage. In 2001, right before 9/11, I worked for an elderly sitters agency out of Murfreesboro, Tennessee, which is 30 minutes east of metro Nashville. I actually worked out of the Green Hills Office in Nashville. I hired new employees and answered phones. Soon thereafter, I fell in love with the company manager, Becky, and married her in 2002. After our wedding, we found an old farmhouse in Murfreesboro which we bought cheap. We had several cats and many dogs, some of which we bred to sell plus several who were only pets. It was Noah’s Ark 2.0. When we moved in, we also had a rat, a pot-bellied pig named Elmer, and two Ball Pythons. We soon met a guy and his girlfriend who lived together down the road from us. His name was Mike, but he went by Dennis. His girlfriend’s name was Rachel. The couple had five kids who lived with them. All of the kids were young except the teenaged boy.\n\nSo we got to know them fairly well. Dennis was about 120 lbs. soaking wet and was quite eccentric. Rachel kicked him out of the house about every other night, thus he slept on his porch or in his car. One day my wife and I were visiting them. We had my 13-year old stepson with us. There was a small building in their back yard. We asked what it was. Dennis took us in there and we saw three, 15–20 foot pythons eating live chickens. We said, “wow!” I felt sorry for the chickens that had yet to be consumed because they stood in the corner of the enclosure as far away as they could get from the snakes with sheer terror etched all over their faces, while waiting to be swallowed whole. Rachel told us not to tell anyone about their large carnivores. We knew that the other neighbors did not need to know that there were serpents in the neighborhood that were large enough to eat a Ford Pinto. Becky and I were okay with it all. We were not afraid. Snakes can be cool. Two of the three snakes were a bit snappy and cantankerous but snake #3 was very docile. Like I said earlier, there were 4 small kids, ages 1 to 8, living in their house. Snakes are escape artists and had they slimed out of their small building out back, the kids could’ve easily become a meal. We held the Burmese Python one day only to discover that it was nothing but muscle, a very powerful animal. Dennis did have his teenaged son to help him. One day, two of the snakes got into a fight and Dennis and son had to break them up before they killed each other. As I said, Becky and I had no problem with our serpent neighbors. But, having those huge snakes close to young kids was very irresponsible, in my opinion. However, at least Dennis knew how to handle and care for them. And, he had his 15 year old son, as I said, nearby in case one of them attacked Dennis or one of the children. He had held educational shows for people in the past, complete with live feedings. Contrary to Dennis, most people do not know enough about large snakes to care for them. Prople buy cute little Reticulated Pythons, for instance, at a pet store that look cute and easy to maintain. Then, they grow too large and too nasty to control. Additionally, the reptile trade via the black market in the United States is big business. Yes, it involves illegally smuggling them to the U.S. from Africa, South America, etc. Another couple Becky and I knew in Murfreesboro bred several different species of snakes including, but not limited to, pit vipers. We were visiting them one time and saw a room full of cages containing all sorts of snakes. It was kind of scary, to be honest, due to the poisonous ones. In most respects, snakes are like any other type of pet: they have their moods, and need food, water, supervision, and medical care such as for a toothache, an abscess of some kind, a bowel blockage, etc. And, the temperature must be optimal and consistent for them to survive and thrive. That takes research. And, snakes do not have any emotions like a dog does, so if you want love in return, don’t buy a snake. Most potential snake owners don’t consider these factors prior to purchase. If one wants a python, it is better to buy a Ball Python like Becky and I did. They stay 4–5 feet in length and are quite calm. Or, Corn Snakes and King Snakes stay small and make good pets. You can still observe them eating live prey just like their larger counterparts, which is fascinating. Fido and kitty would not be in danger, either.\n\nBack to Dennis. He told us once that he would go in the reptile shop in Nashville called The Aquatic Critter. He once was holding a snake for sale only to walk out of the store with it when the employee stepped out of the room. And he would steal rats from pet stores, in general, in order to feed his snakes. This didn’t surprise me, to be honest.\n\nA huge problem in Florida is the number of large pythons which inhabit the state. People in droves have released their pet pythons into the Everglades once they grew too large to handle. So, over time, these occurrences compounded and now there are pythons eating much of the native wildlife in Florida, not to mention some household pets. Pythons will eat nearly anything and have migrated from the Glades in South Florida all the way to counties in Northern Florida. This fact is quite alarming.\n\nIn conclusion, if you want a pet python, I strongly encourage you to buy a Ball Python. They stay 5 feet long, or less, and are very docile. Those other Pythons become huge and powerful. And they require medical care, too. Do you want to have to pull your pet snake’s tooth? Think about it: how many snake vets are you going to find through Google who come to residential neighborhoods to work their reptillian magic? If you educate yourself before you buy a potentially monstrous snake and you are responsible about it, more power to you! Go for it, but not with small children nearby. Snakes can be very fascinating. Just do not under-estimate the power of larger pythons and Boa Constrictors…\n\nPlease do not buy snakes thru the illegal reptile trade. Some of the snakes die in transit usually do to excessive heat or suffocation. I am not sure of all the restrictions involved by law. Try to check into this. I think they should be left in their natural habitats.\n\nBy the way, I wonder whatever happened to “Snakeman Dennis!”\n\nHave a good one..\n\nDavid"
