        "text": "Dan Robbins, an artist who created the first paint-by-numbers pictures and helped turn the kits into an American sensation during the 1950s, has died. He was 93.\n\nRobbins, whose works were dismissed by some critics but later celebrated by the Smithsonian Institution’s National Museum of American History, died on Monday in Sylvania, Ohio, said his son, Larry Robbins.\n\nHe had been in good health until a series of falls in recent months, his son said.\n\nRobbins was working as a package designer for the Palmer paint company in Detroit when he came up with the idea for painting by numbers in the late 1940s. He said his inspiration came from Leonardo da Vinci. “I remembered hearing that Leonardo used numbered background patterns for his students and apprentices, and I decided to try something like that,” Robbins said in 2004.\n\nHe showed his first attempt – an abstract still life – to his boss, Max Klein, who promptly told Robbins he hated it.\n\nBut Klein saw potential with the overall concept and told Robbins to come up with something people would want to paint. The first versions were of landscapes, and then he branched out to horses, puppies and kittens.\n\n“I did the first 30 or 35 subjects myself, then I started farming them out to other artists,” said Robbins, who mainly stuck to landscapes.\n\nWhile the Craft Master paint-by-numbers kits weren’t embraced initially, sales quickly took off and peaked at 20m in 1955. Within a few years, though, the market was flooded, sales dropped and Klein sold the company.\n\nTogether, Robbins helped create slices of Americana that are still collected and are found framed in homes across the nation. Palmer still sells at least two kits: one remembering the 11 September attacks and the other depicting the Last Supper.\n\n“We like to think dad was one of the most exhibited artists in the world,” said Larry Robbins. “He enjoyed hearing from everyday people. He had a whole box of fan letters.”\n\nRobbins, who spent much of his life in the Detroit area, was modest about his work and didn’t get too bothered by those who mocked the paintings.\n\nCritics came to view the paint-by-numbers kits as a metaphor for a commercialized, cookie-cutter culture and fretted that they far outnumbered original works of art, said William Lawrence Bird Jr, curator of the 2001 exhibition at the National Museum of American History.\n\nRobbins, who wrote a book, “Whatever Happened to Paint-by-Numbers,” said at the exhibition: “I never claim that painting by number is art. But it is the experience of art, and it brings that experience to the individual who would normally not pick up a brush, not dip it in paint. That’s what it does.”\n\nRobbins is survived by his wife, Estelle, sons Michael and Larry, and several grandchildren and great-grandchildren."
