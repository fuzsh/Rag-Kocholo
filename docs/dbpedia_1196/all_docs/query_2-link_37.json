        "text": "Proven Excellence\n\nOpening Minds through Art (OMA) is an award-winning, evidence-based, intergenerational art-making program for people living with dementia. It was developed at Scripps Gerontology Center, an Ohio Center of Excellence at Miami University, in 2007. People living with dementia (artists) are paired with volunteers (students, families, caregivers) who are trained to rely on imagination instead of memory and focus on remaining strengths instead of lost skills. OMA enables people living with dementia to assume new roles as artists and teachers and leave a legacy of beautiful artwork. OMA has been widely replicated.\n\nIntergenerational Connections\n\nAge segregation in our society has caused people across generations to see each other as strangers. By connecting people across generations via direct, regular interactions centered around the arts, we build positive attitudes about each other in a joyful way.\n\n“The time was well spent because I got to spend it with you! You would do something for me and I’d do the same for you.” -OMA older adult participant\n\n“My partner has the most giving spirit and is so kind it is hard not to love her. I feel like since I have started this experience at OMA I have been more happy in my day-to-day life because my Fridays are so good.” ~OMA student volunteer\n\nResearch-Backed\n\nPublished studies have documented OMA’s positive impact on both sides.\n\nCompared to other activities, people living with dementia during OMA show:\n\nMore expressions of pleasure\n\nGreater engagement\n\nBetter overall well-being\n\nStudents who participated in OMA show:\n\nIncreased positive attitudes toward people living with dementia\n\nIncreased comfort levels interacting with people living with dementia\n\nIncreased affection, enthusiasm and a sense of kinship toward people living with dementia\n\n“I was feeling blue but now I’m feeling better.” -OMA older adult participant\n\n“I am becoming more empathetic and patient with her. I am happy that I can grow this way as a human being.” -OMA student volunteer\n\nOur Research\n\nMeaningful Art\n\nCheck out the diverse collection of vibrant artwork by people living with dementia in the OMA program. Most of them have not done art since their elementary school days. Many surprised themselves and discovered hidden talents.\n\n“I can’t believe I created that!”\n\n“I love that. The art just comes out of me.”\n\n“I feel like I can do anything!”\n\nArt Gallery"
