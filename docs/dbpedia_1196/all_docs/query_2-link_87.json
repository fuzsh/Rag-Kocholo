        "text": "Hi there, Liron here!\n\nHope you are doing great ^_^\n\nI recently posted a people painting process on Instagram.\n\nWanted to share here as well.\n\nHere are the stages:\n\nAnd here’s the comparison with the reference photo:\n\nAnd here’s a closer look at each stage:\n\nSketch – very loose and simple.\n\nStarting to paint the first layer, not worrying too much about the colors merging a little.\n\nFinished the first layer.\n\nAdded the shadows and some people in the background (and perspective lines).\n\nPainted the background – coolest part (:\n\nAnd added some more shadows to the people in the foreground.\n\nI didn’t use many details, and this is a very small sketch (about 5″ x 7″). I think this really goes to show you how few details are necessary to establish a fairly realistic impression.\n\nAlso, with this being a small sketch, I used a fairly direct approach, with lots of negative painting and basically zero washes that cover all of the paper.\n\nI hope you enjoyed seeing the stages and the final result!\n\n– Liron\n\n- Liron Yanconsky\n\nMy YouTube Channel - Learn Watercolor Painting!\n\nThanks for the process images. Realism is an interesting topic as well; when asked about it people seem to diverge on whether something is realistically render or not based solely on the idea of whether or not a painting has details, but I feel it has less to do with the details and more to do with handling the lights and shadows. If one is achieving realistic lighting, atmosphere, perspective, distance, and surface qualities; then they are painting realistically to me. On the other hand, one can put in every knob, button, and pattern extremely accurately and not apply realistic effects of the aforementioned and end up with something that has all the details in the right places, but simple does not seem realistic in the slightest.\n\n- Delo Delofasht"
