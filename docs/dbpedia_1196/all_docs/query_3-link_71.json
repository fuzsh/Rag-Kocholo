This is the beachhead where the battle will be won or lost.\n\nChurch, Culture, and Context\n\nWe can’t communicate with an audience we don’t understand, and we can’t understand our audience without understanding something about the cultural soil in which their lives are rooted (cf. Acts 17: 23; Matthew 13: 18-23).\n\nCommunicating the Gospel\n\nGood news communicated badly can still sound a lot like bad news. Good intentions do not guarantee we’ll get attention. Good communication requires good listening, a clear message, an engaging delivery, and hard work.\n\nLeadership and Administration\n\nIt’s not enough to believe that healing can happen at the feet of Jesus. Someone has to be willing to do the tedious work behind the scenes of getting people to the feet of Jesus (cf. Mark 2:1-12). That tedious work includes planning, administration, budgeting, team-building, working through conflict, legal issues, decision-making, etc. Nobody ever gets into ministry to deal with these questions. But, a lot of people get out of ministry because they didn’t learn how to deal with these issues.\n\nPreaching Ministry\n\nGood communication takes practice, coaching, and careful theological/practical reflection.\n\nWhat is the most important piece of advice you give students to help them succeed?\n\nMinistry is not about you and your people; it’s about you and God. Everything else in ministry flows out of that relationship.\n\nSelected Publications\n\nThis Way to Youth Ministry: An Introduction to the Adventure, Zondervan/Youth Specialties Academic.\n\nYouth Ministry: The Basics and Beyond co-edited with Deon Kitching (Youth Specialties - South Africa)\n\nEnjoy the Silence, co-authored with Maggie Robbins, Zondervan/Youth Specialties\n\nSpeaking to Teenagers, co-authored with Doug Fields, Zondervan/Youth Specialties\n\nBuilding a Youth Ministry That Builds Disciples, Zondervan/HarperCollins\n\nYouth Ministry Nuts and Bolts (Revised), Zondervan/Youth Specialties"
