        "text": "Born and raised in Waimea, Hawaii, Chef David Robbins grew up working on his family's flower and lei business on their all natural produce farm. There he developed a strong passion for local ecology and a deep understanding of where food comes from which eventually led to him joining the culinary world as a chef.\n\nRobbins moved to Florida as a teenager, and went on to pursue his degree at Florida Coast University in Cultural Ecology. He then began to hone his skills in the kitchen with The Bonita Bay Group and Fiddlesticks Country Club before taking on a leadership role at the Naples Grand Resort - Waldorf Astoria Collection in 2006. As sous chef at the AAA Four Diamond Resort, Robbins came into his stride as a chef while working in a world-class level environment serving a high volume of guests on a daily basis with top quality and consistency.\n\nNext, Robbins sent 7 years at Fiddler's Creek Club and Spa, Naples, FL where he eventually took over the helm as executive chef.\n\nWhile continuing to push himself professionally, in 2015 Chef Robbins accepted a position at The W Hotel & Residences, South Beach and The Dutch Miami - the AAA Four Diamond resort is home to the South Florida outpost of acclaimed Chef Andrew Carmellini’s NYC modern American restaurant. Robbins, brought with him over 15 years of professional experience in culinary arts and dining room services to the team. While at The W he collaborated with Executive Chef de Cuisine Adonay Tafur in managing all resort food and beverage operations including banquet functions, in-room dining and overall food and beverage operations for the resort’s venues: WET Deck, Beach Cabanas & Food Truck, Living Room, The Wall, The Grove, and The Dutch Miami.\n\nChef Robbins returned to Naples at the end beginning of 2016 to pursue new opportunities and to have more time with his sons Micah & Aiden - and wife Arianna. Since, he has privately consulted on a range of projects including working with private Country Clubs /Yacht Clubs & multiple restaurant openings.\n\nRobbins is honored being part of the tight knit culinary community of Southwest Florida and being closer again to friends, family, and beautiful Naples beach sunsets. He tells us that \"Naples is such a warm, friendly, and hospitable community. A part of Miami will now always be with me, but I’m glad to be back, I’m excited to play a role in the growing Naples food scene. SWFL is ripe with potential. It’s awesome, humbling, and inspiring to be part the new fabric of the area’s culinary culture.\""
