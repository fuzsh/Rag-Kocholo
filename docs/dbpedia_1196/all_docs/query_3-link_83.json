The third-year drama student will record his first comedy album during a live performance of his stand-up act Friday, November 16.\n\n“It’s incredible,” says Robbins-Singh, who uses a wheelchair and performs under the stage name “Squeaky Wheelz.”\n\nHe has labelled Friday’s event “Roll with it,” and the line-up of comedians includes Tim Bailey, Billy Rae Bauer and Cameron Adamson, in addition to Robbins-Singh."
