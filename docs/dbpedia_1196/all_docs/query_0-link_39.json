        "text": "WINTERKILL\n\nSavage and dangerous, the unexplored Rockies hid threats that could kill even the most experienced mountain men. And any greenhorn unlucky enough to get stranded in a wilderness blizzard faced a brutal death. Settlers like Nathaniel King had the survival skills needed to live through the fierce winter storms, and they willingly helped any stranded traveler. But when Nate took in a pair of strangers who had lost their way in the snow, their kindness was repaid with vile treachery. If King wasn't careful, he and his young family would not live to see another spring.\n\nBLOOD TRUCE\n\nUnder constant threat of Indian attack, a handful of white trappers and traders lived short, violent lives, painfully aware that their next breath could be their last. With only raw courage to aid them, Nathaniel King and other pioneers braved the savage Rockies to claim the freedom they found there. But when a deadly dispute among rival tribes blew up into a bloody war, Nate had to make peace between the enemies–or he and his young family would be the first to lose their scalps.\n\nWILDERNESS DOUBLE #6:\n\nNorthwest Passage\n\nLife in the savage Rockies was never easy for the courageous mountain men who dared to live there. Threatened every day by hostile Indians and cutthroat frontiersmen, Nathaniel King and other intrepid settlers knew that trusting the wrong person could cost them their lives. But when Nate agreed to lead a seemingly innocent group of pioneers through the treacherous mountains, he made a mistake that could be his last. For the Banner party had a secret they did not want revealed, and they were more than willing to kill to keep it hidden.\n\nApache Blood\n\nLife in the wild Rockies was never easy for the courageous mountain men who lived there. And those settlers who dared to travel were endangered by murderous cutthroats and vicious beasts. Only intrepid pioneers like Nathaniel King had the strength and skill to battle the ever-present perils. But when Nate and his young family journeyed to the southern Rockies, bloodthirsty Apaches kidnapped his wife and son. With the help of his friend Shakespeare McNair, Nate would save his loved ones—or pay the ultimate price.\n\nWILDERNESS DOUBLE #5:\n\nMountain Devil\n\n1832: life in the Rocky Mountains was filled with danger and mystery. Indian legends held that deep in secluded valleys lurked bizarre creatures bent on destroying man. Although Indians shunned such places, courageous settlers like Nathaniel King had no time for such tales, and they willingly braved these forbidden areas. But when Nate led a hunting expedition into a valley where one of these monsters was said to live, several of his fellow hunters were viciously slain. And before long Nate himself became the prey of a beast that might have come out of his worst nightmare.\n\nBlackfoot Massacre\n\nLife in the savage Rockies was not easy on Nathaniel King and other courageous mountain men who dared to settle there. For every day, wild animals, treacherous Indians, or brutal elements threatened their very existence. With all these dangers, Nate never expected any trouble from a missionary bent on converting the hostile tribesmen. But when the Reverend John Burke was trapped in perilous Blackfoot territory, Nate had to save the man&emdash;or heâd bear the brand of a coward until the day he died.\n\nWILDERNESS DOUBLE #4:\n\nVengeance Hunt\n\nIn 1829, life west of the Mississippi was filled with constant peril and hardship. At any moment, a settler might find himself threatened by a murderous Indian or a deadly beast. Only rugged mountain men like Nathaniel King had the courage to challenge the unknown dangers for the freedom the wilderness offered. But when Nate and his mentor Shakespeare McNair made enemies of two Flathead Indians, their survival skills were tested as never before. If either man made one mistake, both would suffer merciless deaths.\n\nDeath Hunt\n\nA new life in the vast uncharted region beyond the Mississippi River was a cause for celebration and fear. With wild beasts, lawless renegades, and hostile Indians enough there to threaten even the bravest of men, a newborn had little hope for survival. Upon the birth of their first child, trapper Nathaniel King and his Indian wife were overjoyed. But their delight turned to terror when Nathan accompanied the men of Winonaâs tribe on a deadly buffalo hunt. If King didnât return, his family was sure to perish.\n\nWILDERNESS DOUBLE #3\n\nTomahawk Revenge\n\nIn 1828, few white men had set foot west of the Mississippi River, and of those who did, even fewer lived to describe the unknown territory. Only tough mountain men like Nathaniel King had the strength and knowledge to carve out a life in that savage region. But when a war party of Blackfoot Indians kidnapped his friend Shakespeare McNair, Nathaniel found his survival skills tested as never before. If King made one mistake, neither he nor Shakespeare would ever tell anyone their tale.\n\nBlack Powder Justice\n\nAt the turn of the 19th century, very few white men dared to venture into the immense, unsettled region west of the Mississippi. And of those who did, only courageous men like Nathaniel King had the skills and strength to survive the harsh, frozen wilderness. But when three vicious trappers ambushed him and kidnapped his pregnant wife, Winona, King faced the greatest challenge of his life. For if Nate did not rescue Winona and their unborn child, the life he had worked so hard to build would be worthless.\n\nWILDERNESS DOUBLE #2\n\nSavage Rendezvous\n\nIn 1828, the Rocky Mountains were an immense, unsettled region through which few white men dared to travel. Only courageous mountain men like Nathaniel King were willing to risk the unknown dangers for the freedom the wilderness offered. But while attending a rendezvous of trappers and fur traders, Kingâs freedom was threatened when he was accused of murdering several men for their money. With the help of his friend Shakespeare McNair, Nathaniel had to prove his innocence. For he had not cast off the fetters of society to spend the rest of his life behind bars.\n\nBlood Fury\n\nIn 1828, the Rocky Mountains were wild and treacherous. Anyone daring to travel there faced unknown dangers and adventures at every turn. On a hunting trip, young Nathaniel King stumbled onto a disgraced Crow Indian. Attempting to regain his honor, Sitting Bear placed himself and his family in great peril, for a war party of hostile Utes threatened to kill them all. When the savages wounded Sitting Bear and kidnapped his wife and daughter, Nathaniel had to rescue them or watch them perish. But despite his skill in tricking unfriendly Indians, King might just have met an enemy he could not outsmart.\n\nWILDERNESS DOUBLE EDITION #1\n\nKing of the Mountain\n\nNathaniel King left New York City in 1828 to venture into the vast, unexplored regions beyond the Mississippi because his uncle had promised to share with him the greatest treasure in the world. Nathanielâs trail led him from danger to danger, and into the wild, uninhabited Rocky Mountains, where life was a struggle to survive from one day to the next. But if Nathaniel lived, he would unearth a treasure far more valuable than he had ever imagined!\n\nLure of the Wild\n\nUp in the Rockies, where a man could live free, Nathaniel King and a rugged mountain man named Shakespeare McNair headed for a rendezvous of trappers and fur traders. But hostile Utes and Blackfoot Indians pursued them relentlessly, determined to have their scalps. Despite the protection of a friendly band of Shoshone, Nathaniel and Shakespeare faced a peril that might mean not only the end of their quest for freedom, but also the end of their lives!"
