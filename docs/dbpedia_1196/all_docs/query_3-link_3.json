        "text": "David L. Robbins was born in Richmond, Virginia. In 1976, he graduated from the College of William & Mary with a B.A. in Theater and Speech. He returned for law school in 1980, but worked as an attorney for only one year before focusing on a career as a writer. Since 1997, he’s published fifteen novels, made repeated visits to the NY Times bestsellers list, has had several of his works optioned for film, and has had five stage plays professionally produced. Also, David has taught advanced creative writing at the university level for fifteen years. He founded James River Writers, a non-profit helping aspiring writers work and learn together as a writing community; co-founded the Podium Foundation, supporting writing for city youth; founded The Mighty Pen Project, giving Virginia veterans and their families training to turn their memories of military service into written, archived narratives; and founded Frontline Writers, a writing program for Richmond area first responders. In 2018, David was named one of the two Most Inspiring Writers in Virginia for the Past Fifty Years by the Virginia Commission for the Arts."
