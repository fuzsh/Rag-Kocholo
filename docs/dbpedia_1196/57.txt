For his initial NFT, internationally known artist (Talent, The Ice Cream Social) and writer David Robbins (Concrete Comedy: An Alternative History of Twentieth-Century Comedy) has chosen a fitting pivot to a new era of communication. A Retrospective, a two-minute video scoring 3D animation with a collage of found sound, plays with the reputation Robbins garnered as an art world jester/provocateur during the object-and-exhibition-making phase of his output, which began in the mid-1980s and continued until 2012. In that year he withdrew from exhibition-making in order to develop digital skills appropriate to the changing landscape of art.

Mr. Robbins's art is in many public collections, including the Metropolitan Museum and the Whitney Museum, New York, the Hammer and the Broad, Los Angeles, Moderna Museet, Stockholm, MAMCO, Geneva, and Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen, Rotterdam.
