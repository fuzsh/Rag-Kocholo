        "text": "Iceland could be the next stop for MoMA’s Björk exhibition, currently on view in New York (until 7 June). “The mayor has seen the show and would like to bring it to Reykjavík,” Bjarni Brynjolfsson, the city’s director of information, told The Art Newspaper. The city council has assigned Svanhildur Konráðsdóttir, the director of culture and tourism, to look into the feasibility of putting on the show at the Reykjavík Art Museum.\n\nMoMa is “exploring opportunities to tour the Bjork exhibition,” a spokeswoman for the museum told The Art Newspaper, adding however that “there are no tour dates to announce at this time”.\n\nThe multi-media retrospective might find a better reception in Björk’s hometown, which the Icelandic musician still often visits, than it has in New York, where the show and its organiser, MoMA’s chief curator at large Klaus Biesenbach, have met with hefty criticism. The Atlantic’s entertainment critics, for example, called the exhibition “a beautiful, ill-conceived disaster”.\n\n“It would not be the same show, but would have to be altered,” Brynjolfsson said, adding that at a final decision has not yet been made."
