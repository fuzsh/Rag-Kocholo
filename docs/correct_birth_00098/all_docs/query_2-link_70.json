        "text": "Björk Guðmundsdóttir was born November 21, 1965, in Reykjavik, Iceland. The road to becoming Iceland's most well known musician does not come without hard work. Young Björk started her musical training by studying the flute, piano and voice. Björk was no stranger to rock music; her stepfather was also a member of a rock band in Iceland.\n\nBefore becoming a solo act -- a phenomenally successful solo act, one might add -- Björk was the vocalist of several bands throughout her career.\n\nIn 1977, Björk recorded her first album. Her self-titled debut included a tribute to Iceland's greatest landscape artist, Johannes S. Kjarval.\n\n2 years later, the eccentric 13-year old became a member of Exodus, and the band made an appearance on Icelandic television. It was when she formed the band Tappi Tikarass that Iceland would get to know Björk as the star act. Bitio fast I vitio, the band's first album, was released in 1981.\n\nBjörk's fame in Iceland was cemented when two of Tappi Tikarass' songs were featured in Rock in Reykjavik, a documentary on the Icelandic New Wave. When she was invited along with other members of the New Wave to become a \"supergroup\" for a one-time session on radio program, Björk met her future band mates Einar Orn and Sigtryggur Baldursson.\n\nThe three formed a new group, Kukl (Icelandic for \"witch\"). Björk put all her creative energy in the new band, and together they released two albums, The Eye and Holidays in Europe, and went on a European tour before calling it quits in 1986.\n\nWhile 1986 marked the end for Kukl, it marked a new beginning for Björk and her husband, guitarist Thor Eldon, who saw the birth of their son Sindri. 1986 also saw the birth of The Sugarcubes, a new band formed by Björk, her husband and several Kukl members.\n\nIn 1987, the success of the band's first single, \"Birthday,\" took effect and The Sugarcubes landed a record deal with Elektra. While their debut album, Life's Too Good, was a huge critical success in both Europe and the US, Here Today Tomorrow Next Week did not do as well. Between the band's second album and Stick Around For Joy, Björk recorded Gling Glo.\n\nIn 1992, the single \"Hit,\" off the album Stick Around For Joy was a huge success; unfortunately, the Sugarcubes did not stick around for more joy and broke up that year.\n\nIt wasn't difficult for Björk to pursue a successful solo career, since she was undeniably the star of the Sugarcubes. On her own after having broken up with her husband, Björk moved to London with her son in 1993, ready to begin her solo career.\n\nBjörk's appropriately titled solo album, Debut, was a huge commercial hit, and also marked a departure from her post-punk rock scene. Björk opted to delve into a style that was influenced by the British dance scene. With the success of the album and the single \"Human Behavior\", Björk's success had crossed the Atlantic to the United States.\n\n2 years later, Björk's sophomore solo album, Post was released, but did not see the same success as Debut. Telegram, which features remixed or rerecorded versions of Post's tracks, was released in 1997.\n\nBjörk took home the Best Actress award at the 53rd Cannes Film Festival, for her role in the musical Dancer in the Dark. Playing a factory worker in the film, she also wrote and performed the film's score. Björk has prior acting experience; in 1986, she performed in an independent American film that was filmed in Iceland, based on the folk tale \"The Juniper Tree\"."
