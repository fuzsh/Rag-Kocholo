        "text": "Two influential women have emerged as trailblazers, expressing their sentiments through raw and uncensored lyrics, accompanied by unique and ethereal vocalizations. coming from different corners of the globe, Fiona Apple McAfee-Maggart, born on September 13, 1977, in New York City, New York, and it stands as a remarkable example of a sullen girl. Apple unveiled her debut album, “Tidal,” at the age of 19 in 1996, infusing it with melancholic and soft ballads such as “Sullen Girl,” “Never is a Promise,” and “Slow Like Honey.” Yet, “Tidal” wasn’t fully characterized by melancholy; it also featured more upbeat yet emotionally resonant tracks like Apple’s iconic “Criminal.” Beyond “Tidal,” Apple has another hit standout album titled “When the Pawn…,” among another 3 remarkable albums widely regarded as an inspiring masterpiece. This album has served as an inspiration for emerging artists, notably Melanie Martinez, who incorporates whimsical melodies and instrumentation reminiscent of Apple’s style. Martinez even paid homage to Apple by covering “Criminal” during her audition for “The Voice,” underscoring her deep admiration for Apple’s musical legacy.However, Apple’s journey has been far from easy; she has struggled with conditions such as Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, Depression, Anxiety, and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. Her struggles with drug addiction and negative experiences with love further shaped her identity and artistic expression. Drawing inspiration from the raw and unfiltered literary icon Maya Angelou, Apple has gifted audiences with profoundly relatable and thought provoking lyrics, such ase “You fondle my trigger, then you blame my gun” and “I have never been so insulted in all my life I could swallow the seas to wash down all this pride\n\nFirst you run like a fool just to be at my side And now you run like a fool but you just run to hide I can’t abide’’\n\nBjörk Guðmundsdóttir, born in Reykjavík, Iceland, stands as a pioneering figure if not the mother of the Art Pop avant-garde electronica experimental genre alongside artists like Kate Bush, Pj Harvey and Tori Amos among many more. Emerging from humble beginnings in small fusion punk/jazz bands like Spit and Snot, also fans and my personal favorite the sugarcubes, she captivated audiences with her eclectic sound and unusual and experimental approach. Her journey began at a remarkably young age, with her first album released at the age of 12 but this wasn’t her big breakthrough but her debut album titled debut was released July 5th 1993. Channeling the spirit of artistic trailblazers like Yoko Ono, Björk experimented fearlessly, blending melodies with unconventional vocalizations, as exemplified in tracks like “Venus as a Boy,” where metaphor and emotion intertwine seamlessly. Notably, her vocal range and expressive depth reached new heights in the hauntingly beautiful “It’s Oh So Quiet.”Despite encountering challenges such as a notable stalker incident in the 90s and struggles with facial tics, Björk’s resilience and compassion have always shone through. Her empathy and generosity were underscored by her gesture of sending flowers to the family of the individual who attempted to harm her. In essence, Björk embodies a spirit of boundless creativity, resilience, and compassion, you could say “All Is Full of Love,” both in her artistry and in her approach to life. Bjork has seamlessly inspired amazing big artists of our generations like Kanye West (Ye), Frank Ocean, Radiohead and more notably Arca whom she’s performed with multiple times and also released multiple collaborations with. Venezuelan artist ARCA has also produced the album Vulnicura and Utopia by bjork.\n\nOverall these women aren’t just what critics paint them out to be, these are women who have made a name for themselves not just for their lyrics, sound and style but for being raw and authentic."
