        "text": "(1965-)\n\nSynopsis\n\nBorn on November 21, 1965, in Reykjavik, Iceland, Björk founded the band the Sugarcubes in 1986 before striking out on her own to a hugely successful solo career in 1993. She's known for such albums as Debut, Post, Vespertine, Medúlla, Volta and Biophilia, and for songs like \"I've Seen It All,\" \"Human Behaviour\" and \"Big Time Sensuality.\" In 2000, Björk appeared in the critically acclaimed film Dancer in the Dark, which she also scored. She won the prize for best actress at the Cannes Film Festival and a Golden Globe nomination for her performance in the film.\n\nEarly Life\n\nFamed singer-songwriter and actress Björk was born Björk Guðmundsdóttir on November 21, 1965, in Reykjavik, Iceland. Having grown up in a highly musical household, Björk released her first album, a compilation of traditional Icelandic folk songs, when she was only 11 years old.\n\nEarly Career\n\nThroughout her teen years, Björk sang with a series of anarchist punk bands, among them KUKL, with other members including Einar Örn, Siggi Baldursson and Einar Melax. With several of her fellow KUKL bandmates, in 1986, Björk formed the pop group the Sugarcubes, joined by Magga Örnólfsdóttir, Bragi Ólafsson and guitarist Thór Eldon. That same year, Björk and Eldon married and (on June 8, 1986) welcomed their first child, son Síndri Eldon Thórsson. The couple divorced in 1987.\n\nThe Sugarcubes released their full-length debut, Life's Too Good, in 1988, winning a cult following in both the United States and United Kingdom. The group's final album, 1992's It's It, was a collection of dance remixes of earlier material—a result of Björk's fascination with the genre.)\n\nSuccessful Solo Career\n\nIn 1993, Björk released her first solo album as an adult, aptly named Debut, which featured two Top 20 singles, Human Behaviour and Big Time Sensuality, and sold nearly 3 million copies worldwide. After relocating to London, England, Björk released 1995's Post, which outsold her first album thanks to innovative collaborations with techno gurus Graham Massey, Howie B and Tricky.\n\nIn 2000, the diminutive Icelandic pop star appeared on the big screen, in the critically acclaimed film Dancer in the Dark by Danish director Lars von Trier. Though it was rumored that tension had grown between the director and his star, who also scored the film, Björk went on to win the prize for best actress at the Cannes Film Festival and a Golden Globe nomination (best actress) for her performance.\n\nBjörk garnered further acclaim in early 2001, when she and von Trier were nominated for an Academy Award (best song) for \"I've Seen It All.\" She made fashion history when she wore her infamous \"swan dress\" while performing the song at the Academy Awards that same year. It was also in 2001 that Björk released her first album in four years, Vespertine.\n\nBjörk went on to build her career as a solo artist with the release of Medúlla (2004), Volta (2007) and Biophilia (2011), each album including its own unique aesthetic and message. In 2004, Björk performed \"Oceania,\" a single from Medúlla, at the Summer Olympic Games in Athens, Greece. At the 55th Annual Grammy Awards in 2013, Biophilia—featuring songs like \"Moon,\" \"Dark Matter\" and \"Hollow\"—took home the award for best recording package, also receiving a nomination for best alternative album.\n\nAround this same time, Björk was added to the lineup of the 2013 Bonnaroo Music & Arts Festival in Manchester, Tennessee, alongside the likes of d Billy Idol.\n\nPersonal Life\n\nFollowing her short-lived marriage to Thór Eldon, Björk was romantically involved with several other members of the music industry, including U.K. artists Goldie and Tricky (of Massive Attack). Then, in 2000, she met Matthew Barney—the artist responsible for the Cremaster project—in New York while promoting Dancer in the Dark. The two soon began dating and remain together today. The couple had a child, daughter Isadora Bjarkardottir Barney, on October 3, 2002, and later worked together on the film Drawing Restraint 9 (2005). They reside in New York City.\n\nQUICK FACTS\n\nName: Björk\n\nBirth Year: 1965\n\nBirth date: November 21, 1965\n\nBirth City: Reykjavik\n\nBirth Country: Iceland\n\nGender: Female\n\nBest Known For: Björk is an Icelandic singer-songwriter and founding member of the band the Sugarcubes.
