        "text": "Björk releases her tenth studio album, and first in five years, \"Fossora\", via One Little Independent Records; stream / listen to the album here. \"Fossora\", a word created by Björk, is the feminised version of the Latin word for “digger,” and a reflection on roots, grounding, love, and family in the context of an underground mushroom world. The album is produced by Björk and recorded by Bergur Thorisson.\n\nThe new album finds Björk nesting at home in Iceland through the pandemic long enough to set down roots - both literally in her hometown Reykjavík and symbolically. While Björk’s last album, 2017’s critically acclaimed Utopia, was a city in the clouds, Fossora is the sonic opposite: an earth-focused, natural eco-system of bass clarinets and punchy sub-bass.\n\nAlbum link: https://bjork.lnk.to/fossora\n\nfossora website: https://www.fossora.com/\n\n“Each album always starts with a feeling that I try to shape into sound, this time around the feeling was landing on the earth and digging my feet into the ground (after my last album utopia which was all island in the clouds element air and no bass). It was also woven into how I experienced the \"now\" this time around 7 billion of us did it together nesting in our homes quarantining being long enough in one place that we shot down roots.\n\nMy new album \"Fossora\" is about that, it is a word I made up, it is the feminine of fossore (digger, delver, ditcher) so in short it means \"she who digs\" (into the ground), so sonically it is about bass, heavy bottom-end, we have 6 bass clarinets and punchy sub, Björk”\n\nThe album features contributions from serpentwithfeet; Björk’s son, Sindri, and daughter, Ísadóra; clarinet sextet Murmuri; The Hamrahlíð Choir; Emilie Nicolas; Kasimyn of Gabber Modus Operandi; sideproject; El Guincho; many of Björk’s Icelandic acoustic musical collaborators; and bass clarinets, strings, trombones and more. The album also deals with legacy, with two tracks paying tribute to her late mother, Hildur Rúna Hauksdóttir, who died in 2018.\n\nBjörk is a multidisciplinary artist who, time and again, innovates across music, art, fashion, and technology. From writing, arranging, and producing an expansive music catalog to her collaborations with scientists, app developers, writers, inventors, musicians, and instrument makers, Björk continues to inspire and experiment, redefining the boundaries of what it means to be a musician.\n\nFacebook | Website | Instagram | Spotify | Twitter\n\nphoto credit: Vidar Logi, Dress: Burberry\n\nBjörk has unveiled her new single “ovule”; listen here. The fragility of love is explored as she imagines a glass sphere; the expectations within attachment, and the balancing act that forms relationships, are held up so they can be elevated toward a more harmonious future. Watch / share the video here ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPr_D-b5v2Q ). The track is taken from her forthcoming album, “fossora”, set for release September 30th via One Little Independent Records.\n\n“Ovule for me is my definition of love, it is a meditation about us as lovers walking around this world and I imagine 2 spheres or satellites following us around, one above us that represents ideal love, one below us representing the shadows of love, and we ourselves walk around in the third sphere of real love, where the everyday Monday-morning meet-in-the-kitchen-love lives in”\n\nThe video is directed by Nick Knight with co-creative direction by Björk with creative consultant and long-time collaborator James Merry.\n\nBjörk is a multidisciplinary artist who, time and again, innovates across music, art, fashion and technology. From writing, arranging and producing an expansive music catalogue to her\n\ncollaborations with scientists, app developers, writers, inventors, musicians and instrument makers, Björk continues to inspire and experiment, redefining the boundaries of what it means to be a musician.\n\nSpecial thanks to Alessandro Michele and Gucci for all their help and support in making this video, especially for the collaboration on the stunning dress that Björk wears in the video, and Squarespace for helping in creating special web sites to launch these audio-visual projects.\n\nFacebook | Website | Instagram | Spotify | Twitter\n\nPhoto by Agúst Atlason\n\nIcelandic post-rockers Isafjørd have announced their brand new album \"Hjartastjaki\", coming via Svart Records The first single taken from the upcoming release is 'Falin Skemmd', an ethereal landscape of icy chills and cinematic warmth.\n\nOn the new track, Isafjørd state:\n\n“This song is about freeing yourself from a toxic relationship and moving on to a brighter future.”\n\nWatch the visualiser here.\n\nListen to the track here.\n\nPre-save the album here.\n\nIsafjørd’s new album, Hjartastjak, is an infectious rush of euphoric melancholy, quiet-loud dynamism, lush instrumentation and unforgettable atmospheric landscapes of song. Meeting on the road, night creatures of the same renowned Reykjavik music scene, Ragnar playing live session bass for Sólstafir, Addi and Ragnar’s musical paths finally intersect in Isafjørd with a sound that reaches like a stalactite from the past into a gleaming future.\n\nNow coming of age, matured into a shimmering diamond of Icelandic pop at its finest, Isafjørd is on another plain from Addi’s own Sólstafir, where their cinematic metal roots have been retraced into sweeping glacial song-craft. A country known for their honest and heart–wrenching emotional take on pop music with Björk and Sigur Rós, Isafjørd gives a new definition to “landscape music”. When an album feels like a place you want to inhabit and experience, Hjartastjaki is a journey that you’re going to want to take.\n\nIsafjørd, literally meaning 'fjord of ice', is a shining new ethereal post-rock band from Iceland. Named after the town that both of their fathers came from, Ísafjörður, Aðalbjörn Addi Tryggvason (Sólstafir) and Ragnar Zolberg (Sign/x-Pain of Salvation) sculpt beautiful and desolate pop, as bright and dark as the sub-arctic seasons.\n\nHoled up in the middle of winter, in an old house with a broken piano in the freezing cold, Hjartastjaki is an album of songs that were written straight from the heart, sometimes in a single day. Their chemistry is as immediate as the climate they survive in, and is a real meeting of spirits, with Ragnar’s sleek and cherubim voice to brilliantly counterpoint Addi’s dusty and aching cries, over orchestrated build-ups of soaring piano and sliding guitars.\n\nThe catchy and haunting music that Addi and Ragnar create in Isafjørd is just as familiar in the same way a lived-in, well-worn great song can touch your soul. Having both lived in Norway and speaking Norwegian, Addi and Ragnar speak the same language of the heart, as their Nordic melancholy makes for deep and mountainous music. Isafjørd’s songs are sincere icebergs of tundra-anthems that bring to mind Fields Of The Nephilim and Duran Duran jamming in a frozen valley, where the creative 80s new wave sound meets GodSpeed You Black Emperor. With influences that range from Cardigans, Beatles, early Judas Priest and Neil Young, Addi and Ragnar have struck a vein of gold that crystallises their own heritage of wide-screen metal gloom into something new.\n\nphoto credit: Vidar Logi, Dress: Burberry\n\nBjörk is unveiling her new single “Atopos” now; listen here. The track is accompanied by a new video, also out now, introducing Björk’s sonic underground world brimming with saturated fungi and bass clarinets. Watch / share the video here. The track is taken from her forthcoming album, “Fossora”, set for release September 30th.\n\nThe title “Atopos” comes from the Latin word meaning \"the other\" both loving and in opposition. Born from the last three years living in her home country of Iceland, Björk writes and produces the song’s clarinet arrangements, repeating lyrics like “our differences are irrelevant” and “hope is a muscle” to the backdrop of painted mushrooms and rock formations.\n\n\"sonically this is a heavy bottom-ended bass world we have 6 bass clarinets and punchy sub drilling, nesting and digging us into the ground\"\n\nThe video is directed by Viðar Logi with co-creative direction by Björk with creative consultant and longtime collaborator James Merry. Their underground world is inspired by digital root plants design from M/M Paris. Additionally, the video includes performances by Kasimyn of Gabber Modus Operandi and clarinet musicians Grímur Helgason, Hilma Kristín Sveinsdóttir, Helga Björg Arnardóttir, Kristín Þóra Pétursdóttir and Rúnar Óskarsson.\n\nBjörk is a multidisciplinary artist who, time and again, innovates across music, art, fashion and technology. From writing, arranging and producing an expansive music catalogue to her\n\ncollaborations with scientists, app developers, writers, inventors, musicians and instrument makers, Björk continues to inspire and experiment, redefining the boundaries of what it means to be a musician.\n\nSpecial thanks to Riccardo Tisci & Burberry for all their help and support in making this video, especially for the collaboration on the stunning dress that Björk wears in the video, and Squarespace for helping in creating special web sites to launch these audio-visual projects.\n\nFacebook | Website | Instagram | Spotify | Twitter"
