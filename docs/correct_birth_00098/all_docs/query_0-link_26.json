        "text": "MARITAL STATUS\n\nProfessions Actress , Composer\n\nBirth name Bjork Gudmundsdottir\n\nIcelandic nationality\n\nBirth November 21, 1965 (Reykjavik, Iceland)\n\nBIOGRAPHY\n\nAfter her parents divorced, when she was five years old, Björk grew up with her mother in a hippie community. She began her artistic awakening very early, taking piano and flute lessons. Gifted and hardworking, she released her first album at age 12 then, four years later, founded her first group, Tappi Tikarrass , already mixing various musical styles (even if punk predominates) and with which she released her first album. Then, she released two other albums with another group, The Sugarcubes ( The Eye in 1984 and Holidays in Europe in 1986).\n\nStrong of her powerful voice mixed with a desire to borrow from various branches (punk, jazz, pop, electro, underground, experimental, etc.) via multiple collaborations, Björk began her solo career in 1993, with the album Debut which knows a great success in the world. Post (1995), Homogenic (1997), Vespertine (2001), Medúlla (2004), Volta (2007), Biophilia (2011), Vulnicura (2015) and Utopia (2017) will follow . So many albums which all enjoyed commercial success and which earned the musician numerous prestigious awards and distinctions.\n\nFurthermore, his music videos constitute a real extension of his music for the artist. With this in mind, she does not hesitate to collaborate with talented directors, such as Michel Gondry .\n\nOn the cinema side, Björk plays the main role in When We Were Witches (1990) based on The Juniper Tree Tale by the Brothers Grimm . But it was in 2000 that she achieved recognition thanks to her meeting with Lars von Trier who offered her the central role in his musical film Dancer in the Dark , whose impressive choreography and songs (sung and composed by Björk) won all the votes. The feature film won the Palme d’Or at Cannes and the actress won the Best Actor Award. Furthermore, the film grossed 46 million dollars worldwide, for a budget of 13 million.\n\nBjörk continues, always in parallel with her musical career, by appearing more or less furtively in documentaries and experimental films, most of the time in her own role, as in I’ve Been Twelve Forever , Arakimentari , Screaming masterpiece , Drawing Restraint 9 and Glastonbury. In 2022, she created a surprise by playing a character in the Viking film The Northman directed by Robert Eggers (to whom we owe the horror The Witch ) and led by a four-star cast including, among others, Alexander Skarsgård , Claes Bang , Nicole Kidman and Ethan Hawke ."
