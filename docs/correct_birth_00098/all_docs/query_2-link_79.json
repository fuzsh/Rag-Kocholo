After the band's 1992 breakup, Björk embarked on a solo career, releasing successful albums such as Debut (1993), Post (1995), and Homogenic (1997), while collaborating with a wide variety of artists.\n\nBjörk was listed in Time's 2015 list of the 100 most influential people in the world and was ranked both 60th and 81st in Rolling Stone's 100 greatest singers and songwriters, respectively. As of 2015, her music has reportedly sold between 20 million and 40 million copies. She has been nominated for 15 Grammy Awards, two Golden Globes, and an Academy Award.
