        "text": "You have a complex personality. You are restless with contradictory impulses and desires, some of them imperious. Although your rational mind is highly developed and seems to be the source of motivation for your behavior, the most significant realm of your psychology is your subconscious. Therein, a conflict between understanding and feeling is raging, between the psychological functions of thought and sensation (C.G. Jung’s terms). Until this conflict subsides, you might feel a sensation of emptiness. You are troubled by and unable to explain this feeling, which leads you to adopt an attitude of doubt and skepticism. This conflict, and its various ramifications, are the main obstacle to your individuation. Your task consists of becoming the master of the energies of your subconscious, and developing your consciousness in terms of the hidden and invisible. Your evolution will occur through a series of metamorphoses and rebirths. However, at certain points in your life, despite your caution and clear thinking, you find yourself in situations you neither desired nor planned, as a result of explosions and eruptions of the elements fermenting in your psyche. You always survive the worst physical, emotional, or intellectual tests, however, fairly unscathed, because of your ability to be reborn and start afresh. As a partner, you might struggle to make compromises. You may appear frosty and distant at times, and you have a taste for challenging, provocative remarks. With yourself, as well as with others, you are sometimes excessive and complicated. In a discussion, you will express strong, honest opinions. In crisis situations, you wish for your efforts to be noticed. You are obsessed with the problem of death. You tend to believe it holds the secret of life – that death can be overcome. Sometimes your anxiety about death is expressed as a search for answers – how can one learn to live with death, how can one detach oneself from the past and its flesh-curdlingly morbid realities… Decay, immobility, ultimate delivery – these images, which are all symbolically associated with death, sometimes haunt you.Intellectually, you have powerfully developed intellectual faculties which yield the maximum effectiveness for your behavior. Deductive, analytical, prospective, you are at once a researcher, a detective, and a scientist. You are fairly introverted, and your discrimination tends to direct you toward the spheres of inner life. You are astute at drawing rational parallels between phenomena of different origins. Your love life will be subject to desire and passion. But since you are more aroused by ideas and fantasies\n\nDue to the influence of Sagittarius (the Centaur-Archer) rising, you, like the half-animal, half-human Centaur, have a dual, ambivalent nature, vagrant and capricious. It is natural for you to be simultaneously conventional and rebellious. You can happily submit to society and convention for a time, only to emerge committed to rugged individualism, or vice versa. Your inner attachment to an ideal of liberty and emancipation does not prevent you from adopting a sociable, pleasant attitude at social events. This dichotomy in your personality grants you such useful social skills as adaptability and poise, but inside, you face a quest for your true identity and consciousness. Your primary psychological task is to maintain the harmony reigning between the two entities dwelling within you. You must not limit yourself to being either one or the other. You will achieve true psychic and existential stability by personifying a blend of these two behavioral tendencies. When you are comfortable with your individuality, you can radiate optimism and energy; flexible and elastic, you will delight in any change or unpredictability, without losing sight of your long-term purposes. Eminently social, you will express your true nature by becoming deeply involved with groups and taking on duties and responsibilities as a member. You will enjoy your ability to infuse them with your idealistic enthusiasm and visions for the future. Your special gifts for dealing with energy make you apt to occupy a position of great social responsibility.\n\nBjörk needs movement. She is a talented communicator.\n\nBjörk has a sense of selfless duty and devotion. Work is one of the most important aspects of life for her.\n\nAt the time of your birth, your rising sign was located in Sagittarius (the Archer), while the sun was passing through the sign of Scorpio (the Scorpion). A summary of the various clues mentioned above provide your personality profile. The following key words capture the essence of your character and indicate certain contradictions which may be sources of tension:\n\n-Enthusiasm – Adaptability – Pugnacity – Charisma – Dignity – Shrewdness – Concentration – Optimism – Common sense.\n\nEndowed with a strong but complex personality, you are animated by a thirst for power. A certain anxiety in relation to fundamental existential questions is at the root of this determination. A strong desire for material, mental, or spiritual mastery over others could compensate for deep-rooted insecurities. Optimistic and pragmatic, you have mental abilities that predispose you to complex investigations, diagnostics, and research. You are an aggressive competitor gifted with an ability to sniff out your rivals’ weaknesses and neutralize them with a thrust of your sharp wit. As a result, your social status is well assured in a competitive world, and you do not shrink from struggle, but you are vulnerable to your inner weaknesses. Fastidious, you are skeptical by instinct. You are energetic and dynamic and see existence in terms of a battle. Likewise, you are continually ready to vanquish yourself. Your best qualities emerge in times of crisis.\n\nBorn on the third day before the new moon’s appearance, you are said to be of the “balsamic moon” type. This soli-lunar configuration gives you a spiritualistic character closely attached to generous humanitarian ideals. You are sometimes sorely tried to limit yourself to the narrow scope of individual ambition. Indeed, you aim for a humanitarian ideal which would include the outcasts and the unfortunate. You fervently hope the meek will inherit the earth. To bring about this ideal, you are likely to seize every resource placed at your disposal: physical effort, money (if you have it), speech, your writings, and your poetic or artistic talents. However, you should be wary of your unconscious guilt feelings. Actually, there is no reason for you to devote yourself to your mission entirely; a simple daily effort should suffice to express your philosophy and free your conscience. Usually, the three days preceding the new moon will be time in the monthly lunar cycle most favorable to your activities and your general energy level.\n\nThis relationship could yield a high degree of psychological compatibility and powerful mutual attraction. The physical and psychological reality of Björk’s personality will exert a magnetic pull over the sensitivity, receptivity, tenderness, and other key qualities of her partner.\n\nThe moon is located at 9 degrees Scorpio. Your ideal match is someone who has the sun at 3 degrees Scorpio or Taurus.\n\nBjörk would be particularly well-matched to someone who mirrors her underlying psychic and unconscious aspirations. The secret ideal you cherish of the perfect partner would be aroused; it would harmonize beautifully with your ideal imaginary lover. This great psychic compatibility is the result of a harmonious relationship between the Moon of the masculine chart and the sun of the feminine one. It is propitious to a rich flow of energies between the most hidden and secret parts of both people. They are linked by an unconscious emotional bond.\n\nBjörk’s Venus is located at 16° CAPRICORN. Her ideal match is a partner with Mars at 10/22° CAPRICORN or CANCER.\n\nThis type of partner would complement you perfectly in emotional and sentimental terms. This person would reflect and fulfill your ideal of sensuality to the greatest degree. Moreover, your ideal partner would resonate lastingly with your own psychic projections of your ideal. This positive relationship between the unconscious sexual yearnings of both partners would be likely to yield sensual relations of a tantalizingly mysterious and secret nature.\n\nYou are a sensitive person, and you try to protect yourself by adopting a somewhat reserved and distant attitude. Cautious and a bit wary about committing yourself to an amorous relationship, you cannot relax your inhibitions unless you feel completely safe. Once you’re in love, you are both passionate and cold, demanding and devoted, possessive but reasonable. You do not readily express your affections in public and may have a fairly practical, down-to-earth attitude toward the relationship. You would be well-matched with such a partner who is serious and in control of themselves. Because this person, too, is wary of being disappointed, they will not engage in an intimate relationship without clear knowledge that their budding feelings are reciprocated. However, once they make their mind up, they will be extremely faithful, affectionate, and tender.\n\nBjörk’s planet, Mars, is located at the 5th house in Capricorn. She is attracted to partners with Venus in the 0th house or Cancer."
