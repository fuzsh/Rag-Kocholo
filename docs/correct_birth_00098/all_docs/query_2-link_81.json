        "text": "BJÖRK: .. Iceland Alternative rock ..1993\n\n..\n\nBjörk Guðmundsdóttir, born 1965 in Reykjavik, Iceland (photo 1993, LP ‘Debut’)\n\n..\n\nBjörk is an Icelandic singer with her own peculiar musical universe. She makes her first recordings – music for children – at the age of 12 and continues as lead-singer in various Icelandic groups, in particular Tappi Tikarrass in 1982-1986 and The Sugarcubes in 1987-1991. The latter becomes popular on the British post-punk scene with 4 LPs and 17 singles. Björk then launches her solo-career with original trip-hop and alternative rock music, achieving mass-success with her 3 LPs ‘Debut’ (1992), ‘Post’ (1993) and ‘Homogenic’ (1997). As from her LP ‘Vespertine’ (2001), she evolves into more esoteric and experimental folk music, composing several film soundtracks and releasing 5 more albums in 2004-2017.\n\n..\n\n∙ 1977 ∙ BJÖRK’S CHILD ALBUM ∙ Arabadrengurinn ∙ 1981-83 ∙ TAPPI TIKARRAS ft BJÖRK ∙ Hrollur ∙ Dúkkulísur ∙ Seiður + Sperglar ∙ Live in London ∙ 1987 ∙ Jólakötturinn ∙ 1987-1992 ∙ THE SUGARCUBES ft BJÖRK ∙ Leash called love ∙ Birthday ∙ Ammæli (song ‘Birthday’ in Icelandic) ∙ Planet ∙ Hit ∙ Walkabout ∙ Vitamin ∙ Regina ∙ Coldsweat ∙ Motorcrash ∙ Deus ∙ Luftguitar (ft Johnny Triumph) ∙\n\n∙ 1993 ∙ I remember you ∙ DEBUT ∙ Big time sensuality ∙ Come to me ∙ Human behaviour ∙ Venus as a boy ∙ Violently happy ∙ 1995 ∙ Charlene ∙ I go humble ∙ Jólasveinar ∙ Nu Flyver (Child movie ‘Anton’) ∙ POST ∙ Army of me ∙ Isobel ∙ I miss you ∙ Possibly maybe ∙ Hyperballad ∙ It’s oh so quiet ∙ 1997 ∙ HOMOGENIC ∙ Hunter ∙ Bachelorette ∙ Alarm call ∙ All is full of love ∙ Jóga ∙ 1999 ∙ Amphibian (movie ‘Being John Malkovich’) ∙\n\n∙ 2001 ∙ VESPERTINE ∙ Hidden place ∙ Pagan poetry ∙ Heirloom ∙ Unison ∙ Cocoon ∙ Domestica ∙ Foot soldier ∙ 2002 ∙ It’s in our hands ∙ 2004 ∙ MEDÚLLA ∙ Who is it (my joy on the left, my pain on the right) ∙ 2007 ∙ VOLTA ∙ The dull flame of desire (ft Anohni) ∙ 2011 ∙ BIOPHILIA ∙ Moon ∙ 2015 ∙ VULNICURA ∙ Stonemilker ∙ 2017 ∙ UTOPIA ∙ The gate ∙\n\nCOLLABORATIONS"
