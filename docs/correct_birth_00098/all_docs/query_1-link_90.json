Below is the description of the app, which probably does a better job of explaining the song than I ever could:\n\n\"Eruptions and earthquakes, the building of continents, the formation of mountain ranges and oceanic trenches, all are powerful geological signs of earth’s underlying structure and mechanics. In \"Mutual Core\" earth’s geology is transformed into a metaphor for human relationships. Opposing forces of compression and release, central to continent building and to human feelings, are expressed sonically, and in the app, by the contrast between the shifting of chords in the verse and uplifting chorus. The contrast can also be seen in the contrasting visual patterns of the animation, and is evoked by Björk’s working title for this track, ’organ plaid’, which describes an interwoven musical fabric. While the song’s themes are universal, the lyrics indicate a specific, autobiographically significant geographical region: the boundary of the north american and eurasian tectonic plates, on which sits Björk’s birthplace —Iceland.\"\n\nYeah, I'll just get this out of the way now: I'm not really a fan of Biophilia. It's actually quite interesting from a technological standpoint and as an interactive experience but I just don't care very much for the music behind it. Biophilia is the only Björk album not to be included in the main countdown. I chose to kick off my countdown with \"Mutual Core\" because I think it shows what Björk is capable of as a visual artist. Whatever that is, anyway.\n\nBjörk has much more interesting and melodic material which I look forward to begin showcasing tomorrow. Until then, sit back and enjoy the pretty colors!\n\nPost by God on\n\n40. \"Pleasure Is All Mine\"\n\n(click for audio)\n\nAlbum: Medúlla (2004)\n\n\"Pleasure Is All Mine\" opens Medúlla, Björk's fifth studio album, with an eerie tone by repeating samples of hums, grunts, and various other vocal sounds. Medúlla, meaning \"marrow\" or \"the inner or deep part of an animal or plant structure\", emphasizes the core, and gets down to the roots of music. All of its songs feature voices in place of instruments; rather, all songs feature the oldest instruments on Earth: voices. With the exception of a gong chime here and there, the entire instrumental is completely reliant on background vocals (Inuit throat singing, in this case) to carry its melody. The voices unfold, one by one, like a flower opening up. The layering of sounds and chords is so meticulously put together that it actually sounds, well, natural. It's pure, crisp, and totally arresting.\n\nBut rather than convey an air of beauty or serenity, the song instead offers a blunt philosophy about relationships: \"When in doubt, give.\" Casting aside the familiar stereotypes of our traditional dominant/submissive conception of relationships, Björk argues that generosity is what ultimately benefits - and exhilirates - both people. While a giver also receives happiness from giving, it also makes them stronger. The \"host-like\" exchange creates a dependency from the receiver to the giver. At the core, behind all the layers of noise, the pleasure is all hers.\n\nPost by God on\n\n39. \"There's More to Life Than This\"\n\n(click for audio)\n\nAlbum: Debut (1993)\n\nDebut isn't technically Björk's debut album. Her official debut was released in her native Iceland in 1977, when she was only 11 years old. She would later record three albums with Icelandic altrock band The Sugarcubes before splitting from the group and following her muse all the way to England in 1992. She became fascinated by London's dance scene and hired Nelle Hooper (Soul II Soul) to produce her \"debut\" album, released the following year.\n\n\"There's More to Life Than This\" was recorded live in the bathroom of a club called The Milk Bar (yes, really). A studio version was also recorded, later released as a b-side to the second single from Debut, \"Venus as a Boy\" (but more on that later). The song itself is a rather pedestrian dance track, and just isn't very exciting in its original state. What makes this song unique is its final presentation, which gives its message a much-needed spark of authenticity. In Björk's words:\n\n\"I went to a party with this big, exciting girl who I really liked and she was a bit daring, and I kind of sneaked off with her. So we got drunk together by the harbour and had a really good time.\"\n\nThe song features Björk dragging her friend, quite literally, away from the boisterous, sweaty crowd, and into the bathroom. She takes advantage of the peace and relative quiet it provides to describe the fantastically simple things they could do rather than vegetate at The Milk Bar, like in my favorite verse: \"We could nick a boat and sneak off to this island/I could bring my little ghettoblaster, there's more to life than this.\" I'm sold!\n\nTomorrow: Telegram and Vespertine make their debuts.\n\nPost by God on\n\n38. \"You've Been Flirting Again (Flirt Is a Promise Mix)\"\n\n(click for audio)\n\nAlbum: Telegram (1996), originally from Post (1995)\n\nBjörk originally recorded \"You've Been Flirting Again\" for her second studio album Post, which was later remixed in its entirety and released as Telegram the following year. The original version serves as a two and a half-minute prelude to \"Isobel\", an epic fable that... well, we'll get to that later. Björk created the string arrangement for \"You've Been Flirting Again\" by herself, and later proclaimed the song to be her proudest achievement. \"It feels like I've passed a maths test!\" She elaborates:\n\n\"I guess the title is taking the piss out off myself more than anything else. Hmmm ... It is hard to pin it down ... I guess that is the nature of flirting, it is ambiguous and slippery. The lyrics are an attempt to describe that.\"\n\nThe Telegram remix, subtitled \"Flirt Is a Promise\", features re-recorded vocals and a brand new string arrangement, created by Björk herself (once again!). It evolves from an echoing whisper into a booming whirlwind of strings, only to get sucked back into itself by the song's end. The additional lyric, \"You're all I ever wanted...\" begins and ends the song on a decidedly tragic note. The original version is nice, and works as a pleasant little prelude, but the remix has a life and identity all of its own.\n\nOne more to follow.\n\nPost by God on\n\n37. \"Unison\"\n\n(click for audio)\n\nAlbum: Vespertine (2001)\n\nWhen compared to the rest of Björk's discography, Vespertine sticks out like a sore thumb. To some, it's her \"quiet album\", to others it's her \"sex album\". But to most people, it's her \"Swan dress album\". Released at the start of the new millennium, Björk's fourth studio album (we're going to continue to ignore her 1977 debut, just FYI) Vespertine finds the singer at her most intimate and emotionally direct. The album mostly deals with sex and love, but approaches the intimate subject from a uniquely cerebral point of view. The title \"Vespertine\" comes from the Latin word \"vesper\", meaning \"evening\". Björk explains her reasoning behind naming the album:\n\n\"It sounds like a winter record ... If you wake up in the middle of the night and you go in the garden, everything's going on out there that you wouldn't know about. That's the mood I'm trying to get.\"\n\nTo create its twilight feel, Björk enlisted the help of electronic duo Matmos, who created microbeats from sounds made by household items, such as cards (shuffled against wooden tables), and nature, such as ice (cracked and stomped on). These sounds putter against a backdrop of chamber orchestras and choirs, creating an air of light, dreamlike serenity. Björk's idiosyncratic singing technique is either frighteningly loud or markedly restrained throughout Vespertine, but its final track \"Unison\" showcases a grand compromise.\n\nComposed over an Oval sample, \"Unison\" ends Vespertine on a bright and uplifting note. This gentle album closer expresses a newfound state of happiness and contented clarity. \"Unison\" features catchy verses and an infectious synth hook full of harps and choirs. At nearly seven minutes long, it's no wonder the song wasn't released as a single despite its hit potential. I'm not totally convinced that a single edit would be able to do the song proper justice.\n\n\"Unison\" is highly personal, relating the joys of resolution to Björk's love of nature. In the first verse, she compares her relationship to a tree. It only takes her three seconds into the relationship (and 40 seconds into the song) to grow her own private branch. She stubbornly maintains her independence while her partner, who she affectionately refers to as her \"gardener\" and \"discipliner\", accepts her for her habits and still loves the person she is. As someone who enjoys introverted solitude, she realizes and admits that she can still be herself in the presence of her lover. \"I never thought I would compromise,\" she repeats. In spite of her ardent sense of individualism, she puts her more unrealistic wishes aside to promote unity between the both of them. To strengthen their relationship, she suggests that they have sex. Sounds foolproof if you ask me!\n\nTomorrow: beatboxing and glowing lights.\n\nPost by God on\n\n35. \"Triumph of a Heart\"\n\n(click for audio)\n\nAlbum: Medúlla (2004)\n\n\"Triumph of a Heart\" features what is easily one of the most fascinating and original arrangements I've ever heard in a pop song. It kicks off immediately with the sound of balloons being blown up, followed by a sequenced cacophany of mouth percussion courtesy of beatboxers Dokaka and Rahzel (formerly of The Roots), and human trombone - before I heard this song I had no idea mouth brass was even a thing, but we'll go with it - Gregory Purnhagen. The beatboxing is instantly placed up-front and center, showcasing a punching rhythm that shocks and twitches through the spine like a defibrillator. \"Triumph of a Heart\" is at once simultaneously alarming and demanding of the listener's undivided attention. No matter how many times I listen to it, I always find myself discovering new babbles and mewls I hadn't noticed before.\n\nThe song's lyrics are an unorthodox celebration of love, describing how the nervous and respiratory systems of the human body work together because of the heart. Believe it or not, \"Triumph of a Heart\" is one of the more easily digestible songs from Medúlla. It's placed at the very end of the album to serve as a kind of reward for being able to make it through crazy s**t like this. Despite its underlying gleeful flirtation with hip-hop, the song manages to maintain the same otherworldly and inventive quality present throughout the rest of Medúlla.\n\n\"Triumph of a Heart\" was released as Medúlla's second and final single in February of 2005, peaking at #31 in the UK. To date, it is Björk's final single to chart in the Top 40 there. The song's music video, directed by Academy Award™-winner Spike Jonze (Her), portrays Björk as a bored housewife who runs off to a local pub to cause mischief away from the prying eyes of her husband (who, by the way, is actually a cat). Her husband would later find fame as a completely unfunny Internet meme seven years later.\n\n\"The last time Spike and I got drunk together ... we invented something called ‘The Falling Down Dance’. The plan is to recreate that moment at my local pub in Iceland.\"\n\nAnd she succeeded! It's a fun video, but they've done better. But, as is often the case, we'll get to that later. Next time: six glasses of water and two suns.\n\nPost by God on\n\n34. \"It's Not Up to You\"\n\n(click for audio)\n\nAlbum: Vespertine (2001)\n\n\"It's Not Up to You\" opens quietly, with a strange percussive pattern of wet blips (supposedly sampled from a coffee machine in an office). The verses churn with synthesizers, harps and clavichords before culminating in a gorgeous, celestial sing-a-long chorus. Björk sends a singular message through multiple channels by using overdubbed lead vocals - one that whispers as the other cries out loud - to create profound, sometimes condemning, internal conversations. Her second album Post was critically lauded for Björk's ability to express her own unique sense of interiority, but Vespertine is undoubtedly her most introverted album.\n\nA typical theme found in Bjork's music, \"It's Not Up to You\" deals with the strong forces of nature. Its lyrics describe fate's mysterious powers and our inability to change what it has in store for us. \"Unthinkable surprises/About to happen/But what they are/It's not up to you.\" It's basically about surrenduring control over things we, well, can't. Just go with the flow!\n\n\"It's Not Up to You\" was allegedly set to be released as the fourth and final single from Vespertine until Björk became pregnant with her second child. A greatest hits album (the aptly titled Greatest Hits) and new single \"It's in Our Hands\" (originally written for inclusion on Vespertine) were released instead.\n\nPost by God on\n\n33. \"One Day\"\n\n(click for audio)\n\nAlbum: Debut (1993)\n\nThe melodies in her early work, Jesus. Disregarding the impish giggle f**k s**t that opens it, \"One Day\" is a wondrous, dreamlike slice of disco-lite. There's a certain feeling of eager, escalating anticipation that's bursting at the seams. All the while, Björk seems to float through an exuberant, animated soundscape of billlowing beats and glistening keyboards. Never the Negative Nancy, Björk reassures the listener that \"One day it will happen ... It will all come true\" and that \"An aeroplane/Will curve gracefully/Around the volcano/With the eruption that never lets you down ... I can feel it!\" We're definitely not in Kansas anymore.\n\nDespite not being released as a single, \"One Day\" was remixed by The Sabres of Paradise twice: the Endorphin Mix and the Springs Eternal Mix (I prefer the latter, which has aged pretty well 20 years later). Both remixes can be found on the EP The Best Mixes from the Album Debut for All the People Who Don't Buy White Labels (yeah). Considering that it was never a single, Björk has performed the song quite a few times over the years. How kawaii did she look at MTV Unplugged? She also performed a similar arrangement during the encore of her Biophilia Tour. Her performance during the Post Tour (which can also be found on Post Live) is my personal favorite. The lack of bouncing synths post-chorus makes for a less playful experience, but it's just as captivating as the original one.\n\nTomorrow: locomotives and virgins.\n\nPost by God on\n\n31. \"Headphones\"\n\n(click for audio)\n\nAlbum: Post (1995)\n\nBjörk's sophomore album Post (get it, post-Debut? Never mind) showcases a wide array of musical styles - big band, trip hop, industrial rock, jungle drum'n'bass - but ends with two deliberately quiet songs. \"Headphones\" closes the album on an ambient, dreamlike note. Björk's vocals (which barely go above a whisper for much of the song) are repeatedly layered until they orbit each other atop a hypnotic, minimal beat. The lyrics are presented in a drowsy stream-of-consciousness narrative that eventually develops into pure wordless vocalization. The result is an eerie, yet bizarrely ecstatic, exploration of unknown sounds and balmy atmospheres.\n\n\"Headphones\", both co-written and co-produced by Tricky, plays like a twisted lullaby in which Björk marvels at the wonder of possibility. She describes his influence below:\n\n\"I did \"Headphones\" with Tricky, sort of a thank-you to a friend who always sent me tapes with his favourite music. I saw that as one of the most beautiful and valuable gifts someone can give you. Such a tape says so much about someone's personality and about what that person wants to tell you. I always saved a tape like that until it was evening, all the work had been done, I was all alone and had taken a bath. Then I'd lie on my bed, with my headphones on, to slowly fall asleep, listening to that tape. That's what that song is about. There's little sounds in there to amplify the effect of rest, solitude and dreaminess.\"\n\nTomorrow: Timbaland and Danja deliver us to the Top 30.\n\nPost by God on\n\n30. \"Innocence\"\n\n(click for audio)\n\nAlbum: Volta (2007)\n\nLmao, I used to really hate this song. Produced and co-written by Timbaland and Danja, \"Innocence\" is built on a looped sample of a single grunt. It's about as innovative and avant-garde as it sounds. The production is total bullshit, but its catchiness is undeniable. The thumping backbeat is harsh and grainy, stopping and starting at an exaggerated pace. The melody is accordingly clipped, crude and totally abrasive. Combine the two and it's like a sucker punch to the gut (or rather, several of them). The result is absolutely jarring - and initially nauseating - but surely remains one of Volta's most memorable and intense moments.\n\nIn \"Innocence\", Björk explains how uninhibited naïveté becomes more powerful with experience. In her own words:\n\n\"I guess it's a handshake with fear. When you're 19, things don't enter your mind. You're untouchable. Later you're like, 'Whoa, what can I learn from experience?' ... For this album, I was trying to get that sensation of not knowing what you're doing, which I really love. We like to close ourselves in a little box where everything's certain. Out there in the world, there are five million billion things but we're only dealing with seven. It's so arrogant to say, 'I'm not innocent anymore' so I'm just taking the piss out of myself really.\"\n\n\"Innocence\" was set to be released as the third single from Volta after \"Declare Independence\" until a last-minute change of plans prompted its release date to be pushed forward by five(!) months. It failed to chart in the UK (Björk's third single to do so), most likely due to lack of a proper physical release. The music video for \"Innocence\" was created as a result of a fan contest in which over 500 contestants submitted their own ideas for what would be later become the official video. But for whatever reason, an official video was never shot. The top ten concepts were instead included on a limited 12\" vinyl/CD/DVD package (she always pulls shit like that, by the way) and the winning entry is embedded above. Björk has one of the best videographies out there but I don't know where her head was at during the Volta era.\n\nTomorrow: an album track from Medúlla.\n\nPost by God on\n\n28. \"Enjoy\"\n\n(click for audio)\n\nAlbum: Post (1995)\n\nThe second of two collaborations with Tricky, \"Enjoy\" features a distinctly sensual trip-hop undercurrent bristling through its filthy, pulsating industrial rhythms. Its seedy percussion grinds against Björk's trademark roars, which curse her own dangerous curiosity and the passionate lust for life which consumes her. The song's robotic beats are punctured suddenly by wild and menacing stabs of brass, courtesy of former Sugarcubes bandmate Einar Örn. \"Enjoy\" plays out like a volatile deluge of pent-up frustration so enthralling that the only thing one can do while listening is, well, enjoy!\n\n\"Enjoy\" was set to be released as Post's second single, but Björk was adamantly against it (bless!). As much as I love \"Enjoy\", she made the right choice-- there were FAR better songs on the album, all of which were rightfully released. As a sort of compromise, a remix of the song (simply titled The Beats Mix) was released as the b-side to a couple of the final Post singles. The song was remixed a second time by Outcast (not OutKast, sadly) for inclusion on the Post remix album Telegram. Neither are among my favorite Björk remixes, but they're intriguing enough to warrant a listen or two.\n\nNext time: Peru, China, Paris, and New York City. Meh.\n\nPost by God on\n\n27. \"I've Seen It All\"\n\n(click for audio)\n\nAlbum: Selmasongs (2000)\n\nBjörk starred in Lars von Trier's musical drama Dancer in the Dark as Selma, a poor Czech immigrant and single mother with a hereditary disease that causes her to slowly become blind. Knowing her son will suffer the same fate, she works night and day at a local factory, saving every penny so that she can pay for her son to receive a preventative operation. Despite winning Best Actress at Cannes for her performance, the demands of the role and the subsequent behind-the-scenes turmoil ultimately proved to be too emotionally taxing for Björk, who vowed that she would never act again.\n\nBjörk composed the entire soundtrack for the film, released as Selmasongs that same year. The album consists of classical arrangements usually associated with Hollywood musicals, filtered through Björk's highly idiosyncratic approach. Its centerpiece, \"I've Seen It All\", was nominated for both the Golden Globe and Academy Award for Best Original Song. Björk performed the song at the Oscars while wearing one of the few dresses in the world to have its own Wikipedia article. My personal favorite excerpt: \"She had two copies of the dress produced, given that it couldn't be taken to the dry cleaners.\" But anyway, back to the music. The film version is a duet with actor Peter Stormare (yes, THAT Peter Stormare), while the album version (linked above) features Thom Yorke of Radiohead in his place. Yorke's trademark indifference normally bores me to tears, but in this case his vocals manage to further emphasize the song's message.\n\n\"I've Seen It All\" finds Björk Selma attempting to convince an infatuated coworker, Jeff, that she doesn't care that she's going blind by responding to each of his questions with apathetic resignation. The song utilizes a familiar call-and-response pattern, not unlike The Sound of Music's \"My Favorite Things\" (a song that Selma actually rehearses at the beginning of the film), listing a number of sights (and sites) that the character has or hasn't seen. It's a brilliant twist on a cliché, turning the simplest and most melodramatic of phrases (\"I've seen what I was, I know what I'll be/I've seen it all, there is no more to see\") into complex glimpses of deep internal conflict as it becomes clear that Selma is trying to convince herself as much as Jeff. Featuring a slow, dark rhythm (created by the trains Selma passes on her way home) contrasted with dramatic, soaring orchestration, \"I've Seen It All\" serves as an emotional and compelling retrospective of a life already lived.\n\nNext time: something from Homogenic, FINALLY.\n\nPost by God on\n\n26. \"5 Years\"\n\n(click for audio)\n\nAlbum: Homogenic (1997)\n\nBjörk debuted a new song, \"I Dare You\", during her Post Tour in 1996. Following a highly-publicized tumultuous period in her life, the song was given a much-needed makeover. It appears on Homogenic as \"5 Years\", an uncharacteristic display of snide aggression. Co-produced by Mark Bell of LFO (no, not that LFO), \"5 Years\" pushes stuttering, scratchy beats beyond their breaking points (until it becomes actual static) and brings them back to life with live instrumentation, courtesy of the Icelandic String Octet. The juxtaposition of organic instruments (strings, organs, and even accordions) and artificial elements (drum machines, synthesizers, and the like) is a recurring motif throughout Homogenic, meant to highlight nature's unyielding beauty against modern electronic crutches.\n\nBut make no mistake, \"5 Years\" isn't a cue to stop and admire a scenic landscape. Björk is simply pissed off, and she wants everyone to know it:\n\n\"[...] last September everything exploded. My unconscious had asked for that. A lot of things ended in my life. I went to Spain in the same week and crashed. I'd been holding my breath in London for four years. Emotionally, this album is about hitting rock bottom and earning your way up. So it's the darkest album I've done emotionally, but it's got a lot of hope. 'Okay, I'm on the bottom but I'm f**king going there.' It's the darkest, but the bravest.\"\n\nHence the album cover (designed by Alexander McQueen!) which depicts a character who, in her own words, \"had to become a warrior. A warrior who had to fight not with weapons, but with love.\" And fight she does! Everything about \"5 Years\" is a battle, from its production to its lyrical content. The song is an angry, snarling tirade against a certain gold-toothed fool who took her love for granted. \"I dare you to take me on/I dare you to show me your palms,\" she challenges. \"I'm so bored of cowards/Who say they want/Then they can't handle!\" Ouch. What a Scorpio (but more on that another time).\n\nNext time: a more tranquil selection from Debut.\n\nPost by God on\n\n25. \"Come to Me\"\n\n(click for audio)\n\nAlbum: Debut (1993)\n\nI've already trashed both \"Violently Happy\" and \"The Anchor Song\" in an earlier entry so it shouldn't come as a surprise when I say that, for me, \"Come to Me\" is Debut's true closer. The song was among the final two to be submitted for inclusion on the album, and it's truly a blessing that it wasn't relegated to b-side status in the end. It features orchestration by Talvin Singh, whose Eastern strings and tablas give the song an exotic and intimate air. The song's spacious, atmospheric arrangement leaves more than enough room for the listener to appreciate each and every instrument (Björk's soft, tender vocals included). The haunting piano line and the dreamlike, almost hypnotic harmonies in the background make me melt with every listen. Twenty years have shown that \"Come to Me\" has aged spectacularly and is still among the brightest gems of Björk's entire catalogue.\n\n\"Come to Me\" was remixed by Sabres of Paradise (meh) and Black Dog Productions (double meh) and released alongside \"One Day\" as a 10\" white label promo. Like \"One Day\", \"Come to Me\" has also been revisited several times over the years, my favorite performance being from the Homogenic Tour in 1997. Those strings!\n\nLater: a return to the aforementioned Homogenic, picking up right where \"5 Years\" left off.\n\nPost by God on\n\n24. \"Immature\"\n\n(click for audio)\n\n\"How could I be so immature?/To think he could replace the missing elements in me/How extremely lazy of me!\"\n\nThat's it; those are all the lyrics. For once, it's really that simple! The song is deliberately placed right after \"5 Years\" to indicate a breakthrough (not a breakdown!) of sorts. After a bitter diatribe against her ex in the preceding track, Björk then places the blame on herself in \"Immature\". She chastises herself for her own simple-minded, naïve attitude on love. She realizes that she was really only in the relationship just because didn't want to be single, and that the only person with the ability to fill any gaps in her spirit is herself. In her own words:\n\n\"I think that one's about an ongoing battle I have with myself. ... It's me trying to work out whether it's braver to be self-sufficient or to need a person. Because when I was a kid, I'd go off camping on my own and being in the middle of nowhere for two weeks, being able to cook and hunt for myself, was my idea of bravery. As I've got older, though, I've realized that, in fact, I was being a coward, because I wasn't communicating with anyone.\"\n\nAnyway, much like the lyrics, the production itself is also melancholy, but concise and to the point. It glows radiantly with the help of gentle harps and a bouncy synthesizer. Rather than manipulating its beats past their limits (as in \"5 Years\" just before it), Björk chooses to manipulate its words, deliberately mispronouncing them and stretching their vowels and consonants past proper enunciation. She repeats the same three lines several times, each instance more Björkish than the last. It's a soulful improvement on the trash demo, found on the \"Jóga\" single. Bless you, Mark Bell!\n\nNext time: Björk tells her little brother to f**k off on Medúlla's second-best song.\n\nPost by God on\n\n23. \"Where Is the Line\"\n\n(click for audio)\n\nAlbum: Medúlla (2004)\n\nLike \"Desired Constellation\" before it, \"Where Is the Line\" made its debut live during Björk's Greatest Hits Tour in 2003 before a studio version appeared on Medúlla the following year. The song finds Björk laying down the law for her younger brother, who she feels is imposing on her principles, violating her morals, and ultimately testing her patience. It's actually the second song she's written about her brother, who never seems to be satisfied with her help. Since threatening him ten years earlier didn't seem to work, Björk has decided to scare the s**t out of him instead, putting her foot down once and for all.\n\n\"Where Is the Line\" begins with Björk repeating the chorus in a confrontational tone until a demonic voice (Mike Patton, of Faith No More) joins in, creating a jarring and largely uneasy listening experience from the get-go. Human beatbox Rahzel returns just before the first verse to carry Björk's discordant melody and complement Patton's menacing growls. Together, the three voices create more jarring beats and basslines than any real instrument could. And just when it seems as though the production couldn't get any more claustrophobic, a choir chimes in with cartoonish whistles. The whole thing sounds like some kind of sonic battle between good and evil, though I'm not sure which side wins.\n\n\"Quite a lot of people said ['Where Is the Line']'s their favorite track. I wanted a head-banging track, like Goth, gory horror music. My splatter B-movie. But it's a bit tongue-in-cheek, like 'Bohemian Rhapsody' by Queen. It's about that complicated voices thing - 'Galileo, Galileo, Figaro!' - for some reason I find it hilarious. I just piss myself laughing.\"\n\n\"Where Is the Line\" was intended to be Medúlla's third and final single, but its release was cancelled with the announcement of Björk's Drawing Restraint 9 project. However, a music video was filmed prior to the cancellation, directed by Icelandic artist Gabríela Friðriksdóttir. The footage ended up being used for one of Fdslqfvckl;dfir's art installments that same year, and can be seen by clicking the photo above. The song is captivating enough without the ghastly visual; I highly recommend listening without watching.\n\nThe song has been performed on every one of Björk's tours since its conception. The original version performed during the Greatest Hits Tour features industrial clangs and chaotic strings that follow the melody with meticulous precision. The Volta and Biophilia Tours both give it a more electronic feel, which probably suits the song far better than the strings.\n\nNext time: TURmooooIL! CARnaaaaGE!\n\nPost by God on\n\n22. \"Earth Intruders\"\n\n(click for audio)\n\nAlbum: Volta (2007)\n\n\"Earth Intruders\" was released as Volta's first single on April 9, 2007. That I write this entry today, seven years (and one day) to the date, is a total coincidence; I swear! Anyway, following the quiet Vespertine and naked Medúlla, Björk (with Timbaland and Danja in hand) came back swinging. The song apparently came to Björk in a dream during a flight from Indonesia to New York. In her own words:\n\n\"I had been invited by UNICEF to visit the areas hit hardest by the tsunami. I was there for a few days, and I just sucked it all up, I couldn't even react to it, it was just too much. And then I had to take several airplanes and go to New York, and in a fit of jet lag, trying to sleep in airplanes, I had this dream:\n\nI dreamt that a tsunami of people would go over the airplane and hit the White House and sort of scrape it off its ground. And as I was in the dream, I was looking up at the floor tiles. Because that was something that was really weird in Indonesia, that you could see how a whole town was just scraped off the ground, but you could still see the floortiles and go, 'This is the bedroom, this is the bathroom...' And all the mud and the bones, and people still digging out with teaspoons finding toys. I was with a woman who found her mom's favorite dress there, her crying while pulling it out of the mud. It was pretty fierce.\n\nSo this dream is like some peculiar naïve fantasy, that maybe a tsunami of people will take over the White House and correct it all. But it's a very chaotic song. It's kind of hard for me to put into words, because obviously at the end of the day it was nature that created this event. Also UNICEF was showing a lot of pamphlets about AIDS in Africa and I was looking at all that when I was falling asleep. ... And the war in Iraq doesn't exactly help the state of the world. So maybe this song is a sort of a mega-mix [laughs] of those themes. It's a lot of things to be in one little song, but sorry, it's a bit of a chaotic song. It's speculation on the human tribe, globalization, that we all are. We are just a human tribe, and we're just trying to deal.\"\n\n\"Earth Intruders\" is essentially one great big war march. It begins with the sound of marching feet, which quickly evolves into a bubbling, manic beat. Congolese group Konono No. 1 play electric thumb pianos against Timbo's makeshift military production as Björk, whose trademark elongated notes have never sounded so feral, chants the song's tribal hook. The whole thing is like an apocalyptic riot of noise. For whatever reason, the hitmakers were incapable of mixing the song properly, so the final version sounds weirdly muffled and distorted beyond intent. Thankfully the single version resolves that issue, giving each \"Intruder\" room to breathe while still retaining the song's primitive charm.\n\n\"Earth Intruders\" became Björk's highest-charting single in the US, peaking at... #84. Due to lack of a physical release, it flopped worldwide, peaking at #78 in the UK. For whatever reason, a multiformat box set (including two 12\" vinyls, a CD and a DVD) was released ten months later. The DVD features the music video, which has got to be one of the worst I've ever seen, especially for a lead single. It's a complete and total mess and I highly recommend listening without watching. [2]\n\nNext time: what being a triple Scorpio sounds like."
