        "text": "Björk is Iceland’s most famous progressive pop personality, the exotic and modern singer/songwriter who did the song “Human Behavior,” a nightclub hit in 1993.\n\nAt the age of 12 she had already released an album, and in the late ’70s and early ’80s she was part of Iceland’s punk scene, ending up in the band Kukl and touring Europe. The lead singer for the Sugarcubes from 1988-92, Björk’s unique voice helped propel the band to cult status in the U. K. and U.S.\n\nHer 1993 solo album, Debut was a hit with critics and spawned two singles.\n\nSince the ’90s Björk has collaborated with DJs and remixers, who have turned several of her songs into dance club favorites.\n\nHer albums include Post (1995); Selmasongs (2000, music from the movie Dancer in the Dark, in which Björk had a starring role and had an Oscar-nominated song, “I’ve Seen It All”); Vespertine (2001); Volta (2007, with the hit “Earth Intruders”); Biophilia (2011); Vulnicura (2015); Utopia (2017); and Fossora (2022).\n\nHer songs include “Play Dead,” “Violently Happy” and “Venus as a Boy.”"
