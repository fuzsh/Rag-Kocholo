        "text": "You could say that BjÃ¶rk GuÃ°mundsdÃ³ttir was born twice: First in Reykjavik in 1965âand again in the studio in 1993, thanks to her aptly titled solo Debut. By the early 1990s, BjÃ¶rk had been a staple of Icelandâs alternative-music scene for more than a decade, thanks to her work with several scrappy local bands, as well as her time with The Sugarcubes, the co-ed quintet that shot to international fame thanks to its 1988 hit âBirthdayââa song all but defined by BjÃ¶rkâs inimitable breathless vocals. But none of that earlier work prepared listeners for Debutâan album that belongs within another solar system entirely. Itâs a strange and singular piece of work, one that seemed to emerge fully formed from BjÃ¶rkâs deep creative wellspring. Indeed, as a guide to the next few decades of BjÃ¶rkâs career, there could hardly be lyrics more fitting than those on Debutâs opening track, the galloping, frost-tipped hit âHuman Behaviourâ: âAnd there is no map/And a compass wouldnât help at all.â Armed with yearsâ worth of song sketchesâincluding a few compositions sheâd started while still in her teensâBjÃ¶rk passed through several early collaborators on Debut before opting to work with British producer Nellee Hooper, whoâd recently helped make hits for SinÃ©ad OâConnor and Soul II Soul. The result is a dance-floor outlier threaded through with brightly syncopated beats and global-citizen flourishes. âVenus as a Boyâ sways to an unhurried, almost tropical rhythm, while âBig Time Sensualityâ finds its joyful backbone in rubber-band electro-funk. The lovestruck ballad âCome to Me,â meanwhile, shivers with woozy longing and ice-crystal orchestration. Still, even in the midst of Debutâs constant tonal shifts and switchbacks, certain anomalies stand alone: âLike Someone In Love,â for instance, is a stripped-down, fairly faithful cover of a standard first made popular by Bing Crosby in 1945. And the albumâs closing track, âThe Anchor Song,â is strung together with little more than mournful horns and plaintive vocals. But, in their own ways, each track here serves as a signpost of where BjÃ¶rk would go in the years ahead, illuminating a path forward for this unparalleled and forever unpredictable artistic force."
