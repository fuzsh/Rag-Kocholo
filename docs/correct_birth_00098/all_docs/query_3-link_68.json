        "text": "Iceland held its traditional national selection: Söngvakeppnin, where the top five candidates that had made it to the final aimed to wave the Icelandic flag at Eurovision 2024. In this final, as usual, a super final was held between the two candidates with the most support. The favorites of the night, Bashar Murad, and on the other hand, Hera Björk, were in it.\n\nIn the first round where both jury and televoting were counted, Bashar won both votes. However, in a surprising turn of events, the winner was Hera Björk with her song “Scared Of Heights,” securing victory with a very tight 50.8% of the votes. She accepted the challenge of representing Iceland in Eurovision 2024, returning to the European festival 14 years later, where she will try to improve on her nineteenth position achieved in the Nordic Oslo.\n\nWho is Hera Björk?\n\nHera Björk Þórhallsdóttir was born in Reykjavik on March 29, 1972. She rose to fame by hosting the show Sirkús Skara Skrípó. Her life soon became intertwined with Eurovision, as in 1999, she appeared in the music video of the Icelandic singer Selma.\n\nIn the year 2000, she released her first album titled “Ilmur Af Jólum.” This marked the beginning of her music career. In 2006, she released her second album, which stood out for its versatility in covering “Alvedansen,” the song that represented Norway in Eurovision that same year.\n\nIn 2007, she attempted to represent Iceland in Eurovision for the first time by participating in Söngvakeppnin, but she didn’t make it past the semifinals. It wasn’t until 2008 when she stepped onto the Eurovision stage for the first time as a backing vocalist for the duo Euroband. In 2009, she tried again to go to Eurovision, participating in the Dansk Melodi Grand Prix, where she finished in second place. However, she didn’t give up on Eurovision, as she became part of the backing choir for the Icelandic singer Yohanna. In 2010, she tried again, but this time in her homeland. She participated in Söngvakeppnin with “Je ne sais quoi,” winning the competition and representing Iceland in Eurovision.\n\nIn 2013, she participated in the Viña del Mar Festival with the song “Because you can,” winning the competition and becoming the first Icelander to win the Silver Seagull. Her adventure in America went further as she moved to Santiago, Chile, where she lived until 2015. It was that same year when she returned to Eurovision as a backing vocalist for Maria Ólafs.\n\n“Scared of Heights” the Icelandic entry for the Eurovision Song Contest 2024.\n\nWith this song, Hera Björk brings us her unmistakable blend of dance and pop. A song that delves into the complexities of love and romantic relationships, all through the metaphors of heights and the fear of falling. It’s a universal message, as we’ve all experienced the fears of opening our hearts to someone else.\n\nLyrics of «Scared of Heights»\n\nI feel it coming\n\nI feel it coming\n\nLook how far we made it\n\nStanding on the edge of a promise\n\nI’m not one to take risks\n\nGetting hurt taught me to be cautious\n\nMaybe we should leave this\n\nCause what would be the use\n\nOf crashing into you\n\nWe could end up in pieces\n\nDon’t need another heart-shaped bruise\n\nI feel it coming\n\nBeen here before and never got it right\n\nBaby I’m wondering\n\nIf falling in love has got me scared of heights\n\nI know we’re going sky high\n\nGoing sky high\n\nBut what if we forget how to fly\n\nBaby I’m wondering\n\nIf falling in love has got me scared of heights\n\nDive in with my heart first\n\nI’m still drowning in this rational fear\n\nWish that I could unlearn\n\nI can’t enjoy the view from up here\n\nMaybe we should leave this\n\nCause what would be the use\n\nOf crashing into you\n\nWe could end up in pieces\n\nDon’t need another heart-shaped bruise\n\nI feel it coming\n\nBeen here before and never got it right\n\nBaby I’m wondering\n\nIf falling in love has got me scared of heights\n\nI know we’re going sky high\n\nGoing sky high\n\nBut what if we forget how to fly\n\nBaby I’m wondering\n\nIf falling in love has got me scared of heights\n\nI feel it coming\n\nI feel it coming\n\nI feel it coming\n\nBeen here before and never got it right\n\nBaby I’m wondering\n\nIf falling in love has got me scared of heights\n\nOh I’m scared of heights\n\nFell a couple times\n\nAnd I barely made it out alive\n\nOh I’m scared of heights\n\nBut the truth is I’m\n\nStill falling if I kiss you goodbye\n\nSo baby I’m wondering\n\nIf falling in love has got me scared of heights\n\nIceland in the Eurovision Song Contest\n\nIceland joined Eurovision in 1986, and since then, it has been a consistent participant, only absenting itself in 1998 and 2002. Despite its presence, Iceland has only managed to place within the Top 10 on seven occasions throughout its history.\n\nInitially, its results were modest, even reaching last place in 1989 with the song “Það Sem Enginn Sér” performed by Daníel Ágúst Haraldsson. Its greatest successes came in 1999 and 2009 when Selma and Yohanna achieved second place with the songs “All Out Of Luck” and “Is It True?”, respectively. The latter scored 218 points, the highest score Iceland has ever achieved in the contest. However, with the change in the voting system, Daði & Gagnamagnið secured 378 points in Rotterdam 2021 with “10 Years,” placing fourth, Iceland’s highest-scoring entry.\n\nThe Icelandic broadcaster RÚV has used Söngvakeppnin as its primary method of selecting representatives for Eurovision. Over the years, the format of the contest has varied, but it generally includes semifinals and a grand final. On some occasions, the broadcaster has opted for the internal selection of its representatives."
