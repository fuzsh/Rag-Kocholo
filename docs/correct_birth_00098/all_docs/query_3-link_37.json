        "text": "The name Björk conjures some well-worn images. She's the otherworldly artist whose album rollouts resemble large-scale art projects. She's the avant-garde fashion maven who smiled serenely in the \"swan dress\" at the 2001 Oscars. And yes, she's the eternal kook selling a box set of 14 handmade bird-call flutes to complement her 2017 album, Utopia.\n\nBut there's a relatable image often missed in all the mythmaking: Björk in her late-20s, a wide-eyed new arrival in London, still at the grimy nightclub when the lights come on.\n\nBorn Björk Guðmundsdóttir, the singer moved from her native Iceland to London in the early '90s. Single in the big city with a young son, Sindri, the musician was eager for new experiences. London's sound clash of electronic music promised endless possibilities.\n\nBjörk went headlong into the nighttime world of the city, sampling jungle, drum & bass, house and techno. Not all of it connected. \"Ninety-five percent of the dance music you hear today is crap,\" she told Rolling Stone in 1993. \"It's only that experimental five percent that I'm into — the records that get played in clubs after seven o'clock in the morning, when the DJs are playing stuff for themselves, rather than trying to please people.\"\n\n<style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed//sPBBk6qB788' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n\nGradually, Björk met her people. She found kindred spirits in Graham Massey, founding member of Manchester acid house innovators 808 State, and Nellee Hooper, a sound system veteran known for his work with Soul II Soul. Out of this creative awakening came Björk's Debut, in 1993, and its astonishing follow-up, Post, which turned 25 this June.\n\nIn her formative years, Björk played in rock bands, but she was never a rock loyalist. Growing up in the Icelandic capital of Reykjavík, she learned the country's folk songs from her grandmother. After her parents divorced early in her life, Björk moved between the domains of her straight-laced electrician father and free-spirited activist mother.\n\nIn spite of splitting her time between parents, she was always surrounded by music. Her mother couldn't afford an oboe, so Björk learned the flute instead. On the long walks to and from school, she honed her remarkable singing voice. She released an album at 11 years old and found success in the Icelandic alt-rock group, The Sugarcubes. (Her former husband and father to her son, Sindri, was the band's guitarist.)\n\nBut Björk was unfulfilled, and 808 State's Graham Massey represented a new path. On Björk's request, the pair met in London to discuss beats. She liked the uncommercial approach to electronic music he’d honed in Manchester’s acid house scene; he was floored by her spine-tingling voice. Björk had arrangements for two songs, \"Army Of Me\" and \"The Modern Things,\" that needed some edge. They finished \"Army Of Me\" in an afternoon, with Björk tinkering on a pocket sequencer while Massey perfected a giant bass riff. (Meanwhile, Björk appeared as a vocalist on 808 State's 1991 album, ex:el, and brought the band to Reykjavík to play the songs live.)\n\nBjörk also found a creative groove with Nellee Hooper, a former member of the Bristol DJ collective The Wild Bunch turned GRAMMY-winning superproducer for the likes of U2, Sinead O'Connor and Gwen Stefani, among others. Björk and Hooper shared a vision for a complete concept, which would later become her aptly titled 1993 debut album, Debut. (The Massey-assisted \"Army Of Me\" and \"The Modern Things\" were shelved for later use.) Produced by Björk and Hooper alone, Debut cleanly broke ties with the singer's rock past and instead welcomed trip-hop, house and synth-pop into her sound.\n\nIn the afterglow of Debut, Björk went deeper into London club culture. She wanted her next album to reflect the restless pulse and possibilities of her newly adopted home. \"Most acts were putting out seven-inches with throwaway lyrics like, 'Ooh, baby, baby,'\" Massey told Paper Magazine in 1997. \"But Björk took that culture and made an album with poetic lyrics. It blew everyone away. She never tried to fit in with any electronic movement, she just took the ideas and got personal with it.\"\n\nThat \"poetic\" album was Post. On its cover, Björk looks out from a heightened Piccadilly Circus in London's West End. Her jacket, designed by art world favorite Hussein Chalayan, resembles a U.K. Airmail envelope. (Björk, a frequent shopper at London's acid-house-inspired fashion store Sign Of The Times, already had designer cred.)\n\nOn nights out, Björk had got to know Hooper's friends, including Massive Attack collaborator Tricky and Scottish producer Howie B. With input from her nocturnal cohort, Björk was determined to make Post much more riotous than Debut.\n\nBjörk left the hustle of London to begin work on Post at Compass Point Studios in the Bahamas. The stories from those sessions are pure, uncut Björk excess. She used extra-long leads on her microphone and headphones to record at the ocean's edge. She sang \"Cover Me\" in a cave full of bats. On a side trip to Iceland, she swam in hot springs and admired glaciers with Tricky. (The pair briefly dated, but as Tricky put it bluntly to self-titled years later, \"I wasn't a good boyfriend.\")\n\nBack in London, Björk continued to hone Post, reaching for a balance between organic sounds and machine-made elements. In the final stretch, she coaxed Brazilian composer Eumir Deodato from semi-retirement to help fill out the sound. At last, Post was ready for the world.\n\n<style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed//jPeheoBa2_Y' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n\nAlbums often open with something moody and instrumental to set the tone. Post is not that kind of album. From the first moment, \"Army Of Me\" is all crunching propulsion, its shoulder-shaking lyrics sparked by Björk's sometimes-wayward younger brother. (\"It's sort of a 'big sister telling little brother off' song,\" she told Stereogum in 2008.)\n\nFrom the jump, Post refuses to sit still. No two tracks can be easily grouped. \"Hyperballad\" is somehow a few songs in one five-minute package: equal parts acid house and Deodato's swelling strings, with a virtuoso vocal performance that combines innocent wonder and furious catharsis.\n\nThere's no greater example of the album's tonal shifts than \"It's Oh So Quiet\" into \"Enjoy.\" The former became the album’s biggest hit—its visual was nominated for Best Music Video, Short Form at the 1996 GRAMMYs, alongside a Best Alternative Music Performance nod for Post. But awards glory was never in the plan. \"It was the last song we did,” Björk told Stereogum of \"It's Oh So Quiet.\" \"Just to make absolutely certain the album would be as schizophrenic as possible.\"\n\nAll these years later, \"It's Oh So Quiet\" remains an uninhibited thrill. While reverent to the 1951 version by Betty Hutton, itself a powerhouse, the song's ecstatic Björk-ness cuts through the throwback big-band sound, building from a whisper to gale-force theatrics.\n\n<style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://player.vimeo.com/video/216125945' frameborder='0' webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe></div>\n\n\"Enjoy\" then switches the setting from wartime revue to Bristol basement club. Created with Tricky—who released his masterful debut album, Maxinquaye, in the same year—\"Enjoy\" is scuffed and oppressive in the best way. In short: This ain't a show tune.\n\nOn \"Isobel,\" written with Icelandic poet Sjón, Björk reached for, as she later told Stereogum, a \"heightened mythical state.\" The song sounds like scaling a glacier and singing to the stars. But Post never lets you pin Björk as an ethereal, unknowable pixie. She also does \"normal people\" things, like getting too drunk and staying out until sunrise. (Hungover Björk interviews were a theme of the mid-'90s. \"I come from a country where from the age of 15 you drink one liter of vodka every Friday straight from the bottle,\" she told SPIN in 1997.)\n\nShe also knows a messy breakup as well as anyone. So from the astral plane of \"Isobel\" we go to \"Possibly Maybe,\" a lovelorn, but still wry slowburner. You picture it sung late at night in a London apartment, far from the warmth of the Bahamas.\n\n\"I Miss You,\" the final single released from Post, is the synthesis of all its wild instincts. There's so much here: horns, relentless percussion, a skittering, curving beat and Björk in blistering form. But the excess works. \"Cover Me\" and then \"Headphones,\" written as an ode to Graham Massey's mixtapes, provide the album's gentle comedown. By the hushed final moments of Björk singing about sleep, you forget how furiously Post began.\n\n<style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed//cTZ7XZIiT7o' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n\nIt's hard to pinpoint the exact influence of Björk's Post over the past 25 years. Forever on the move, the 15-time GRAMMY nominee has never been defined by one album alone.\n\nAfter a nightmarish 1996, which included a scuffle with a journalist and a bomb threat from a stalker, Björk decamped to Spain to record a follow-up to Post. Released in 1997, the brilliant Homogenic was more unified and consciously Icelandic than its predecessors.\n\nHomogenic set a precedent for an artistic reinvention by the singer every few years. As a result, other artists tend to credit the totality of Björk's output, rather than a single album, as inspirational. Most avoid her name at all: Citing a talent as vast and singular as Björk can only invite unfair comparisons.\n\nOver the decades since Post, Björk has made a habit of working with artists she's inspired. \"That's the good thing with being so obsessed with music,\" she told the Evening Standard in 2016, \"you've always got other nerds who are obsessing, too. It's kind of ageless.\"\n\nIn recent years, those collaborators have included experimental electronic producers The Haxan Cloak and Arca as well as art-pop original ANOHNI. Throughout her many creative partnerships, Björk has battled sexist notions of authorship. \"It's always like I'm this esoteric creature; that I just turn up and sing and go home,\" she vented to the Evening Standard.\n\nContemporary singer-songwriters Jenny Hval and Mitski openly worship Björk, both jumping at the chance to interview their hero for a Dazed feature in 2017. Other parallels can be reductive. Shapeshifting singer FKA twigs, for one, is often cited as Björk-like. While the pair share a collaborator in music video visionary Andrew Thomas Huang, the comparison is a too-easy catch-all for women skirting traditional pop.\n\nIn the 25 years since its release, Post has come to represent something wider than Björk's specific viewpoint. It's the best possible outcome of a timeless conceit: the transplant intoxicated by a new city, channeling their experiences and anxieties into art. In an era when cities are siloed and flights are grounded, Post feels impossibly romantic.\n\nSparks' Russell Mael Talks 24th LP, 'A Steady Drip, Drip, Drip,' Adam Driver & That Time They Showed Up On 'Gilmore Girls'\n\nHer Origin Story Features A Lot Of Car Talk\n\nAllen's early musical growth relied on four-wheeled vehicles to drive the plot forward — in many different forms. Growing up in rural Maine meant long car rides to for school and family outings, which in turn meant a lot of time with the radio.\n\n\"My dad is the biggest classic rock fan, so since I was little, I spent hours every day listening to music in the car with him and my sisters,\" she told Variety earlier this year.\n\nWhen it came time for one of her sisters to start a band, the elder Allen named it No U-Turn, setting the theme. When the band needed a new bassist, Amy took up the low end at just 8 years old, learning classic songs from the likes of Tom Petty and Rolling Stones. The band started collecting opening spots at a bar in Portland, Maine, and lasted until Allen was in high school and her sisters had left for college. In addition, she started playing in a bluegrass band called Jerks of Grass alongside her high school guitar teacher.\n\nEventually, Allen thought about moving on and changing course. \"I went to nursing school at Boston College for two years, and within a month of getting there I was like, 'I made a big mistake,'\" she continued. After moving over to the prestigious Berklee School of Music, Allen started a new project, yet again turning to vehicular terminology: Amy and the Engine, who would go on to open for the likes of Vance Joy and Kacey Musgraves. The project's timeless indie pop charm shone brightly on singles like \"Last Forever\" and the 2017 EP Get Me Outta Here!, fusing references ranging from the Cranberries to the Cure.\n\nShe's A Major Champion For Women In Music\n\nBack in 2021, Allen pondered whether it was time to carve up one of America's most prominent monuments. \"Can you imagine tits on Mount Rushmore/ And Ruth Bader Ginsburg from dynamite sticks?\" she sang on \"A Woman's World,\" a highlight from her 2021 solo EP AWW!. The song backs off from that explicit ask, but the low-slung waltz of ghostly piano and gentle acoustic guitar still subversively slices at traditional gender roles and power dynamics.\n\nAnd while the track may focus its first verse on the Notorious RBG, Allen designed it as a more approachable anthem. \"I felt very proud of that song. And it's something that I love to play live, because I think that it's nice as a woman to give that moment to other women in the audience where I see them,\" she told The Line of Best Fit upon the EP's release.\n\nHer solo work sits in a long line of female pop and rock stars looking to lift others up — with Allen's list of influences including everyone from the Carpenters and Pat Benatar to No Doubt, Hole, and Siouxsie and the Banshees. But she's also aware of the shortcomings in the industry when it comes to behind-the-scenes matters, with female songwriters representing a disproportionately small percentage of the industry and often at lower revenue than their male counterparts.\n\n\"It's important to have more women writing and performing so that younger girls can be hearing that and really connecting with that and resonating with that, and then being inspired to do that themselves,\" she continued. \"I'm really excited to hear what the next generation of singer songwriters creates, and I want to do my part in making sure that they're able to.\"\n\nShe Went Full Circle With Selena Gomez\n\nAllen's emotionally salient and indelibly quirky songwriting with the Engine caught the attention of more than just adoring fans. While on a tour stop in New York, she connected with Scott Harris, a songwriter who has worked with the likes of Shawn Mendes, Camila Cabello, Niall Horan, and Meghan Trainor; when Allen eventually moved to New York, she would take on some of Harris' writing sessions when he was in Los Angeles. One of those sessions spawned the first song she'd place with another artist: Selena Gomez's \"Back To You,\" which ended up on the soundtrack for the second season of Netflix's teen drama \"13 Reasons Why\" in 2018.\n\n\"I grew up listening to Selena Gomez, and I know that she's going to be a pop icon forever,\" Allen told People in 2020. \"She's awesome. I was so psyched…It definitely propelled my career in the pop writing field further.\"\n\nTwo years later, she would re-team with Gomez for \"My Mind & Me,\" a single released alongside a documentary film of the same title following the impact of the star's diagnoses with lupus and bipolar disorder on her career. The single similarly offers an openhearted, empathetic look at big mental health struggles, this time in the form of a sweeping, cathartic power ballad driven by stumbling syllables and stair-step piano.\n\nThe track was shortlisted for Best Original Song at the 2023 Academy Awards, charted in more than a dozen countries, and, perhaps most importantly, seemed to have made quite the connection with Gomez. \"Honestly, it was therapeutic for me,\" the pop star and actress told Variety in 2022. \"I felt super connected to what I was singing and what I was saying.\"\n\nShe Loves Seeing Her Collaborators Live\n\nSongwriters often wind up hidden behind the scenes, unable to really gather the impact that their artistic expression is making on others. But thankfully, Allen has been able to catch a peek in on the arena-sized reactions for some of her biggest collaborators.\n\nOne of Allen's most-played co-writes is \"Adore You,\" a highlight from Harry Styles' 2019 album, Fine Line, which has nearly 1.7 billion streams on Spotify alone as of press time. The buoyant, slippery burst of Fleetwood Mac-indebted funk pop embodies the start of an infatuation, and fans similarly felt under the song's spell. And Allen finally got to see that feeling come to life at Styles' album release show at the Kia Forum in Los Angeles in 2019.\n\n\"Watching Harry, I was really nervous because the album had only been out for a couple days and I wasn't sure if anybody would know that song,\" Allen told Variety in 2020. She also noted that the song was a hard turn from more heartbroken tracks she'd written for the likes of Halsey. \"'Adore You' was my first feel-good song, so I'm psyched about that,\" she added.\n\nThough not in person, Allen got a similar bolt of joy when she was able to watch Lizzo perform Styles' track for BBC Radio 1 in 2020. \"I idolize Lizzo,\" Allen continued. \"It really just goes to show that the right song can be performed by many different people.\"\n\nLittle did Allen know that she'd get to celebrate a GRAMMY nomination and win alongside Lizzo and Styles, respectively, just three years later. She co-wrote \"If You Love Me\" from the flute-jamming pop star's 2022 record Special, which was nominated for Album Of The Year at the 2023 GRAMMYs, where Styles' Harry's House (which featured Allen's co-write \"Matilda\") won the coveted honor.\n\nAhead of the EP's release, the queer GRAMMY nominee (and frequent Queen collaborator) celebrated his new musical chapter with a special party at The Standard High Line's nightclub Le Bain. Organized by legendary NYC nightlife impresario Susanne Bartsch as part of her famous On Top! event series, the soiree felt like a full-circle moment for Lambert as he watched drag artists like God Complex and ShowPonii slay the house down boots to his new music.\n\n\"I've always really been drawn to that kind of world,\" Lambert says of the thriving LGBTQIA+ party scene. \"I think even way back before '[American] Idol,' I remember being in L.A., when I was in my early twenties and trying to find the parties. They were pretty underground at the time, where people would dress up and wear crazy makeup. And of course, I was there in my platform boots, stompin' in. So I've always sort of sought out that community. I love it.\"\n\nBelow, Lambert takes GRAMMY.com through the colorful and unapologetically queer inspirations that led to Afters, from the '90s house sounds of Crystal Waters to finding freedom in radical creative expression — and, of course, plenty of sex.\n\nFeeling Free — And Sexy\n\nI've always loved electronic dance music, I've always loved house. And it's interesting because, for a long time, it was considered sort of \"niche\" for a gay person to make dance music. And now it just feels like it makes sense. [Laughs.] It's so obvious, you know?\n\nI was working so hard for so long and on tour for so long, and I did a lot of tours with Queen and on my own stuff. I was so focused on my career for so many years, and then as the pandemic kind of faded and we were getting into that next chapter, I made some time for a social life. Which was much needed. That's what kind of inspired me to want to make this music.\n\nI just wanted to make something that felt like my actual social life — that felt like my life. I'm in a relationship, we've made lots of friends in L.A., we have lots of after-parties. We socialize, we go out, we go to clubs, we go to bars. I wanted to make music for that.\n\nMy private life is...exciting is how I would probably put it, and passionate. So it's definitely fueled from that. The music is written in first person, but it's also sort of meant to inspire the listener to want to feel that type of freedom as well. You listen to something about sex and hopefully it makes you go, \"Yeah! I feel sexy!\"\n\nOvercoming Post-'American Idol' PTSD\n\nWhen I first came out the gate after Idol, I did a big old performance [at the 2009 American Music Awards]. I got in trouble for kissing the guy and having sexy dance moves and stuff, and that gave me a little dash of almost a PTSD of, like, \"Oh, OK, there's a line that I can't cross. And if I do, I could risk losing everything.\" And that fear drove me down a certain path where I felt like I had to hold back a certain amount.\n\nThat was very much a reflection of where we were at as a society at the time, and what the mainstream was able to digest. The music industry was a different game back then. There were a lot more gatekeepers, a lot more obstacles that I encountered. Now, the industry has shifted so much, just in terms of how people get music, how you can reach your listener, how you can make music, what kind of label situation you have set up. There's a lot less filtering going on. That's what also inspired me to want to make something that was more liberated.\n\nMy perspective has shifted a lot. That fear early on came from a place of, \"I don't want to lose this opportunity.\" There was a little dash of imposter syndrome in there. You know, coming off of \"Idol,\" feeling like, \"Oh my god, how did I get here?\" It happened so fast. And I think just having stayed in the game over the last 14 years has given me a sense of confidence. It's given me a sense of belonging.\n\nI've found more of who exactly I am over that time. Working with Queen has been a real boost in confidence as well, and has allowed me to sort of feel like I've earned something.\n\nSetting The Mood\n\nI love music that puts you in a mood, in a headspace. And that's what I wanted Afters to be. That's why I called it Afters. It was, yes, you could totally listen to these at a club, but it's also, like, lyrically, when you go to a club and then you go to an afterparty, the rules are out the window. You can do whatever you want, you know? And people feel that freedom.\n\nThere's something to be said about growing up a bit and maturing as a performer. You feel less of a need to prove something [vocally]. I think I'm finding less of an impulse to be, like, \"Look what I can do!\" and more, \"Look what I can make you feel.\" The \"less is more\" thing does start to become more obvious.\n\nAs I've gotten a little older, too, my voice has shifted a bit. And I have, like, lower parts of my voice that I haven't really dug into before that I definitely did on this project. Which is kind of a fun experiment. I just wanted to do something that was more vibey.\n\n'90s House & '20s Hyperpop\n\nI like going into a project with, like, a reference and a direction. It gives you sort of a roadmap…I have a whole playlist of newer stuff that I kept adding. A lot of it's somewhat obscure, but then there's artists out there that I think are really cool, like Slayyyter [or] COBRAH. A lot of the DJs that I really like — Chris Lake is amazing. Even stuff like Disclosure… I really love them. I just wanted to make music that made me move.\n\nI found myself gravitating towards a similar sound over and over again — sort of a dirty house, kind of sexy tech-house sound. Certain textures and sonics that I started noticing as a pattern of the stuff that I liked.\n\nI love a good, soulful house vocal, always…Like Crystal Waters or any of those. I love that, like, '90s house vibe. And obviously \"DEEP HOUSE\" [on Afters] has a little bit of that. So does \"WET DREAM,\" where you get into that soulful pocket. It's so fun to sing from that place.\n\nQueer Voices In The Studio\n\nIt was really important for me to make sure there were queer people in the room when I was writing these songs. Back when I was first starting, the major label writing setups that I was put into, there weren't many queer people. And that's changed so much — there's more and more queer people in the music space. Definitely top-line songwriters, and then even more and more, I'm finding producers that identify as queer, and that's really exciting. 'Cause it makes everybody less afraid and just willing to sort of go for it.\n\n\"WET DREAM,\" I did with Sarah Hudson and JHART and Ferras, who I've known for ages. Vincint and Parson James worked with me on \"LUBE.\" Just people that I really admire. Vincint did some background vocals on \"LUBE,\" actually, which is cute. Vincint and I did a collab on his project recently as well, so that was cool that we got to each kind of add to each other's project.\n\nA lot of the songwriters are friends of mine who I've known for a long time. I was like, \"Do you want to do a song?\" Which makes the writing process so much fun.\n\nQueer Rebellion & Sexual Healing\n\nI think, right now, people want to find freedom. I think people want to find an escape. There is a lot of sociopolitical energy right now that's kind of dark and negative, that's coming at us from the right wing, super-conservative side of the world. Some of that can make us feel dark as well, and kind of discouraged.\n\nBut I also think there's a lot of us, including myself, that feel like that lights a bit of a rebellious flame in us, and makes us want to shine brighter and be bolder and be wilder and crazier than we are. And [I] see that out and about: people are more and more expressive, emotionally, with their identity [and] how they want to explore [it].\n\nThere are members of our community that want to explore their gender identity; there are members of our community that want to explore their feminine side or their masculine side. There's, I think, more acceptance in that exploration and that expression right now than there's ever been. It's f—ing great. It's always been there in the [LGBTQIA+] community, but you're just seeing it on display a little bit more. People are more comfortable going there and exploring it, and I love that.\n\nThere's less and less shame around sex than there's ever been. We're more mainstream than we've ever been — there's more with social media and [pauses] other types of media on the internet. And that's really exciting. 'Cause sex is f—ing great. And healing, and wonderful, and exciting. It's our human right to explore our sexuality, and I see more people feeling freer in that.\n\nFinishing With A Climax\n\nOne of the Afters songs, \"FACE,\" was actually created a while ago. I wrote that with Pete Nappi, like…four-ish years ago? During the pandemic, I think. But it sounded very different. And once I started getting more house tunes together, I kinda was like, \"OK, can we take this idea and evolve it into a higher BPM and a dancier kind of direction?\"\n\nWe sped it up, we added a bigger beat to it, more of a four-on-the-floor feel to make it feel \"club.\" But it's definitely the last track on the EP for a reason. 'Cause it slows down compared to the other songs a bit. If the rest of the EP is foreplay, it's sort of like the home run. [Laughs.] It's like once you get that person that you've been into all night into the bed, what happens?"
