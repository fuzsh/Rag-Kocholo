        "text": "Coachella 2023 has now come to a close. The second weekend of the Southern California mega-festival concluded with another series of bespoke performances that continued to build the event’s reputation as a place where legendary moments become history.\n\nWeekend two was packed with drama and intrigue, led by the last-minute removal of Frank Ocean from the Sunday lineup due to injury. Fans were already buzzing following his controversial first weekend performance, while organizers worked quickly to replace his headlining set. The results were top notch, closing Coachella on a very energetic and celebratory note.\n\nAs a result, Blink-182 — who had a surprise set on Friday afternoon of the first weekend — were given a main stage slot on Sunday night, followed by an act to be announced.\n\nThe mystery act didn't remain hush-hush for long, though. Sunday's headliners were revealed to be the supergroup DJ trio of Skrillex, Four Tet, and Fred Again.., who in their brief time playing music together have become one of the most sought-after acts in the world. (So much so that they sold out Madison Square Garden in two minutes after announcing the show.)\n\nBeyond the Sunday scramble, weekend two of Coachella 2023 brought much of the same excitement as the previous week — replete with more stand-out sets than even the most experienced festival goer could manage to catch. Below, relive seven sets that showcase Coachella’s reign as one of the most popular festivals in the world.\n\nWet Leg Encourages Communal Release\n\nThe British alternative rock band only has one self-titled album’s worth of material, which they've been diligently touring around the globe. And yet they still managed to bring a sense of zeal and authentic excitement to their second Coachella set.\n\nWet Leg's Rhian Teasdale and Hester Chambers set the example of this energy. Throughout the performance, they shared excitable looks, occasionally dropping lyrics in favor of laughter. Other times, they led the crowd in an epic scream, just for the sake of it. Dave Grohl even showed up to scream with them.\n\nThe climax of the performance at the Mojave stage on Friday afternoon was \"Chaise Longue,\" the upbeat rock and roll heater that earned the group a 2022 GRAMMY for Best Alternative Performance. When Teasdale would ask, \"Excuse me,\" the crowd would shout back \"What?!\" with all their might. Then the rapid fire guitar came in, and everyone in the crowd understood that the assignment was to dance.\n\nGorillaz Take Special Guests Appearances To The Next Level\n\nGorillaz last performed at Coachella in 2010 as Sunday headliners, and brought headliner energy to Friday night's penultimate set. When it comes to special guests — a Coachella tradition already ingrained in Gorillaz's music — the group stepped up their game.\n\nBy the third song, the L.A. alternative legend Beck was on stage to sing his feature on \"Valley of the Pagans\" from Gorillaz’s 2020 album, Song Machine, Season One: Strange Timez. From there, more than half of the 17-song set included a guest.\n\nThundercat came on for his contribution to the title track of Gorillaz's latest, Cracker Island, Little Simz performed \"Garage Palace\" off 2017's Humanz, and Yasiin Bey, formerly known as Mos Def, joined Gorillaz along with the Hypnotic Brass Ensemble for \"Sweepstakes\" from 2010’s Plastic Beach. Minutes before his own headlining set, Bad Bunny came out in a mask to perform \"Tormenta,\" his feature on Cracker Island.\n\nAn IRL Bad Bunny collab may have been the ultimate surprise guest coup de grâce, but Gorillaz weren't finished yet. In a touching moment of unity, Gorillaz paid tribute to their late collaborator David Jolicoeur after the surviving members of De La Soul joined Gorillaz for a performance of \"Feel Good, Inc.\"\n\nEric Prydz Brings Artificial Into Reality With His HOLO Show\n\nIf Eric Prydz had decided to simply play a DJ set, he still likely would have landed one of the festival's top booking slots; instead, he brought his HOLO show to Indio.\n\nThis unique live production is known in the global dance music circuit for pushing the limits of visuals in the live space. There are hundreds of videos on the internet heralding its epicness, but those videos don’t compare to experiencing it in person.\n\nPrydz’s closing set at Outdoor Theater on Saturday night was scheduled to begin at 10:20 p.m., but when the time rolled around, the screens remained dark. However, a keen ear could tell that the scene had actually begun; a subtle line emanated through the speakers and, for 20 minutes, kept getting louder and extending in its repetition.\n\nAt 10:40, a giant mechanical hand appeared on the screen, as if it was floating out into the audience. With an iPhone between its Transformers-esque fingers, the hand took photos as a wash of electronic music started building. Then as the hand flipped the phone to show an image of the audience on its screen, the first track of the set took full form, and a tidal wave of energy was released from the crowd.\n\nFor the remainder of the set, every new song was accompanied by an evermore impressive audiovisual creation. One frame was Prydz himself wearing a spacesuit. Another was a team of spacemen firing laser guns at the crowd. It felt so real that someone probably ducked to avoid the virtual projectiles.\n\nChristine & The Queens Do So Much With Not-So-Much\n\nCoachella is a festival where most artists like to do a lot, but Christine & The Queens demonstrated that you can actually do a lot with a little.\n\nProduction during the Sunday sunset slot at Mojave was minimalistic: two separate platforms on stage, one for Christine and her three-piece band, the other open for use. Like her stage setup, Christine & The Queens' music is generally minimalistic — though Christine doesn't require much to completely enthrall her audience.\n\nSongs began calmer, exemplified by the use of Red Hot Chili Peppers' alt-rock ballad of \"By The Way\" as a transition into her hit song, \"Tilted.\" As that steady and simple beat moved along the intensity only increased. Christine threw her body around, ending up on the floor, on the platform, all the while nailing every note with her serenading tones.\n\nOther than her soothing yet powerful vocals and mesmerizing stage presence, Christine was just as much a preacher as a musician. She decried patriarchal capitalism and stood strong in her belief that music is the greatest weapon against it.\n\n\"You are not going to surrender!\" she shouted as her drummer threw down a high speed solo.\n\nBoygenius Provide A Musical Safe Space\n\nWhen the indie supergroup took the Outdoor stage for the first set of Saturday night in complete darkness, everyone was primed and ready to feel all the things. Thus commenced the musical therapy session that was boygenius' Coachella performance, as members Phoebe Bridgers, Lucy Dacus, and Julien Baker sang the first few lines of \"Without You Without Them\" together on a single mic.\n\n\"I want to hear your story and be a part of it,\" the trio sang — their message a call to everyone in earshot, from the audience to the security guards and production workers.\n\nAlthough the crowd wasn’t the biggest that the Outdoor stage would see throughout the weekend, the environment allowed for plenty of space for the audience to be with themselves under the stars. Then as the band went through the various moods on their debut album, the record, the audience responded to their energy in kind.\n\nWhen the trio were rocking out on songs like \"$20\" and \"Satanist,\" the energy was high and lively as everyone took in Bridgers' towering shouts before returning with their own. Then when the volume came down for the raw, unfiltered honesty in songs like \"True Blue\" and \"Emily I’m Sorry,\" the people who were shouting before began to gently sway, murmuring the lyrics to themselves word for word, experiencing them on a personal level.\n\nBjörk Reworks Her Classics With An Orchestra\n\nIceland’s own Björk last performed at Coachella in 2007, when she headlined Friday. For her first Coachella set in over 15 years, the artist returned with a full orchestra that performed original interpretations of her past works.\n\nBacked by the Hollywood String Ensemble and conducted by fellow Icelander, Bjarni Frímann, pleasant indie songs such as \"Aurora\" and \"Come To Me\" became operatic epics. The orchestra allowed her to accurately and succinctly reproduce \"Freefall,\" a song from her latest album, 2022’s Fossora, which integrates orchestral composition with alternative production.\n\nClosing the set, Björk embarked on an exploration of orchestral techno, as Hollywood String Ensemble rearranged her industrial masterpiece, \"Pluto.\"\n\nVisually, Björk satisfied expectations on all levels. Her dress was reminiscent of a spider web, with feathers caught in the adhesive like several birds all flew through at the precise angle. Above the stage, an aerial drone show reacted to her voice as if her tones were literally reaching the heavens.\n\nSkrillex, Four Tet & Fred Again.. Party In The Round\n\nSaving the day, Skrillex, Four Tet, and Fred Again.. took their last-minute headlining set to epic proportions. The trio of DJs performed in the round on the satellite stage, while extra speakers were brought in so fans in every part of the field could bathe in their electronic sounds.\n\nTheir set was just a straight party, complete with plumes of glowsticks flying into the air during various drops. Then when they fell other people would scavenge the field and pick them up so they could throw them on the next great drop.\n\nAt other performances like MSG where they were the sole act, the trio had as long as five hours to explore all the music they wanted. This time they had less than two, and filled the set with as many bangers as they could.\n\nSome examples were the scraping dubstep track \"COUNTRY RIDDIM\" by the rising dubstep producer HOL!, \"RATATA,\" a breakbeat tune supported by a vocal feature from Missy Elliott, and even \"Party In The USA\" by Miley Cyrus.\n\nBut the glue holding together the set were the booming bass tones of UK grime rapper Flowdan. The new trio made new versions of his hook from the massive collaboration with Skrillex and Fred Agan.., \"Rumble.\"\n\n7 Jaw-Dropping Sets From Coachella 2023 Weekend 1: BLACKPINK, Bad Bunny, Blink-182 & More"
