        "text": "The most important and future-oriented musician of his generation is Björk. The music star who is often seen as an experimentally restless creative force is an Icelandic singer, songwriter, producer and actress. She is best known for her works that cross a wide variety of musical styles.\n\nMusically, she explores the relationship between nature and technology and integrates electronic and biography sounds. She is widely acclaimed for songs like Ive Seen It All, Human Behavior and Big Time Sensuality. Here you will find everything you need to know about her.\n\nBiography of Björk\n\nThe Human Behavior singer was born in Reykjavik, Iceland, on November 21, 1965, and given the birth name, Björk Guðmundsdóttir. Her first name is a common name for women in Iceland and means birch while her other name is patronymic. She has a mix of Irish and Norse ancestry.\n\nShe was born to a mother, Hildur Runa Hauksdottir, who was an activist and her father, Guomundur Gunnarsson was a trade union leader and electrician. His mother protested against a hydroelectric development in Iceland. She didn’t want to be a housewife and left marriage with her daughter to join a hippie group.\n\nHilduh remarried a guitarist, Sævar Árnason, in a band called Pops who were considered the Jimi Hendrix of Iceland at the time. This second union provided a musical platform for the potential singer.\n\nCarrier start\n\nBjörk studied classical piano music in primary school from the age of 11. Afterwards, she started recording and released some of her songs on the radio. Soon after, she compiled traditional Icelandic folk songs, which would become her debut album, Björk. The album was released in 1997 and she got a contract with the Franklin label.\n\nShe was a member of various music groups throughout her teenage years. Some of these bands include Spit and Snot (an all-female band), Jam-80 later replaced by Tappi Tikarrass (formed in 1981), Exodus (a jazz fusion band formed in 1979) and KUKL (a gothic rock band) which she joined at the age of 18.\n\nBjörk would form the pop group Sugarcubes in 1986 with fellow KUKL members including Einar Örn, Siggi Baldursson and Einar Melax. The band was joined by Magga Örnólfsdóttir, Bragi Ólafsson and guitarist Thór Eldon (who later became her first husband).\n\nThe group came out with their first hit single Anniversary. They got a deal with One Little Indian record label as a result of this song. Their second song, Life’s Too Good (1988) earned them a cult following in both the US and UK. The band released their album, It’s It in 1992 before they broke up.\n\nSolo career, acting career\n\nAfter being in a band for many years, Björka moved to London where she began her solo career after Sugarcubes split in 1993. She collaborated with producer, Nellee Hooper to produce her hit single, Human Behavior . The clip was directed by Michel Gondry and broadcast on MTV.\n\nShe released Debut, her second album since Bjorken 1993, which met with enormous success with nearly 3 million copies.
