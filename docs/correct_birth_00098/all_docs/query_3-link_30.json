        "text": "Bjork became a household name when she walked the red carpet at the 2001 Academy Awards in her swan dress.\n\nMany consider the pop darling eccentric, but with her 2011 album, “Biophilia” (Nonesuch), and the Biophilia Educational Program, Bjork (pronounced “Berk”) has proved herself a forward-thinker, both intelligent and innovative.\n\nShe will be performing a series of concerts at the Hollywood Palladium and Hollywood Bowl Sunday through June 11, and the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles will offer a one-day children’s workshop Sunday.\n\nBorn in Reykjavik, Iceland, Bjork began studying music as a child and earned a recording contract by age 11. At 14, she formed the all-girl punk band Spit and Snot, which led to other projects, including KUKL and The Sugarcubes, and a diverse selection of genres from which she honed her own style. She graduated from music school in 1980 and released her first solo effort, “Debut,” in 1993. “Biophilia” won the Grammy Award for “Best Recording Packaging” in 2013.\n\nBjork has continued to evolve and experiment throughout her music career.\n\n“I’ve been doing music for a really long time and I’m just trying to be truthful to whoever I am,” Bjork said. “It’s very rare that you see women that are allowed to change or mature in their work. I have idols like Joni Mitchell for example, who was writing songs in her 50s with the intelligence that a 50-year-old experiences, that a 50-year-old would have, and not pretending to be 25. I have always tried to be the person I am at any given time, but there are certain things that never change like my voice and my taste.”\n\nBjork approaches her writing in many ways, but inspiration usually sparks when she is taking a walk. It’s in the open areas around Reykjavik that she’ll sing, working out melodies where no one else can hear her.\n\nThe idea for “Biophilia” and its resulting educational program emerged when Bjork began using a touchscreen computer to play live during the Volta tour.\n\n“I got very excited in 2008 and started to write with the touchscreen, actually write programs especially for it that I could play myself, almost like a troubadour, and strum while I was singing,” Bjork said. “I don’t really play the piano or the guitar or anything, so I was like, wow, technology’s caught up and it has arrived. I got really excited about mapping out how I feel about musicology.”\n\nBjork wanted to use the computer to make visual representations of the rhythm, chords and other parts of music she was performing and, for her, the most logical way to do this was by connecting the sounds with nature.\n\n“Before I knew it, I had spent two years writing programs and I had 10 songs for 10 different types of musicology and I had tied each one of them to different natural elements. And then the iPad came out and it was like, hmmm, wait a minute, it seems kind of crazy to have written 10 different programs with 10 different songs and to just record them and throw them on a CD, when we could give people in their homes the same thing that we’d been playing with,” Bjork said.\n\nShe contacted a group of app builders and, as they worked, Bjork kept thinking of her childhood in music school and what she would have liked it to be. It became obvious to her that “Biophilia” would translate easily into lessons that could reach out to children around the world.\n\nThus, the Biophilia Educational Program for children ages 9-14 came to fruition with workshops based on Bjork’s app suite that uses new technology to teach science and nature combined with music and art. The city of Reykjavik has adopted the program as part of its school curriculum for the next three years. It will also be offered in workshops in select cities throughout Bjork’s tour, including the MOCA in Los Angeles.\n\nThe ideas behind the Biophilia project are very similar to the strong links between art, science and technology in Pasadena and the Silicon Valley.\n\n“I noticed that with this project, the people we ended up working with, they would always come back to California,” she said. “I guess Iceland is a bit like this, where technology and nature isn’t far off, where you have very extreme nature, but the most up-to-date technology. It’s interesting that the next generation of kids who are in their 20s now, it’s not even a question that those two can collaborate, it’s obvious, so that’s really comforting.”\n\nBjork’s son, Sindri Eldon Thorsson, is a journalist and a musician. Her daughter, Isadora Bjarkardottir Barney, 10, is learning piano and enjoys writing stories.\n\nBjork is already writing new material and expects to spend the next two years allowing her instincts and interests lead its direction.\n\n“It’s hard to explain or describe right now because I’m in that mysterious stage with my next album,” Bjork said. “It’s really important to let it become what it is and what it wants to be because once you can mold it and put it into an album and start touring, it’s sort of has to be something that has a spark and it’s alive.”\n\nHowever the new effort comes out, Bjork is sure it will be different than her previous work.\n\n“I have to say I get very easily bored and I think that may be a very big factor in why I change. Of course it would be easy for me to go and do another ‘Biophilia,’ but I couldn’t do that,” Bjork said.\n\nmichelle.mills@sgvn.com\n\nmickieszoo on Twitter"
