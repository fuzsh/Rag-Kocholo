        "text": "BjÃ¶rk\n\nObviously, Iâm very biased. I love Iceland. I feel very blessed to come from a place like this that actually happens to have the cleanest air and most space, no army. Sorry â we got no army. Sorry to rub it in. So in that way itâs really ideal. As a person, I really like this village vibe, the fact that Reykjavik only has 150,000 people, and everybody knows somebody from somewhere or is the brother of someone. You canât get away with shit.\n\nEmma Warren\n\nItâs the whole, like, âIâm going to tell your mom.â Everybody knows someoneâs mom. Itâs an incredible way of keeping control on things.\n\nBjÃ¶rk\n\nYes. So obviously I really like Iceland, but I understand that what youâre talking about is more utopia, a different thing. I really believe in utopia. In a simple way itâs about knowing what you want, and aiming for making a bubble of what you think the ideal thing would be. I think itâs really important to be really clear about that and very determined. Then, of course, only half of it is going to come true because reality is different from the ideal. So I donât think itâs escapist. You have to be really clear about your dream and then be aware that it is a dream. Reality is this other beast that you surf and deal with on a day-to-day basis. Iâm a big believer in utopia and this reaching out for the dream. We need it very much, as a human species.\n\nEmma Warren\n\nThe word utopia has come up in the few things youâve said about the new record youâre working on. I know you donât want to talk about it in any detail because itâs fragile and it needs its own space, but I wondered if it would be accurate to say that Biophilia was very much about the whole universe, Vulnicura was very much about the reality of one broken heart, and with you using this word utopia about happiness, is it fair to say that the music youâre writing now is looking out into the world again?\n\nBjÃ¶rk\n\nItâs probably a bit too early to talk about the new album. Iâm still in the bubble. As much as Iâd like to, I canât see it from the outside. Itâs very convenient for me that usually I do interviews afterwards, because there may be two to three years since I wrote the songs. And then I go, âOh, thatâs what it is.â But when youâre in the middle of it, you canât see out. The little I can tell you is, yes, I think I was very aware about utopia, the fact that Iâm curious about the dream, about what of it is real and what of it is not real.\n\nCelebrating the unreality of it, especially in this day and age where technology can be very helpful and itâs very easy to sketch up digitally what you want. I got my laptop in 1999, and it totally liberated me from the studio. I could do 90% of my music in my bedroom. I could basically make up the dream but make the dream real. I think technology is really helping us with that. But on the other side, if you really want to go into utopia, what Iâm really concerned about it is the ecology, global warming, the environment.\n\nThis is something we have to be realistic about. If we know how to make iPhone 7, we should know how to get rid of fossil fuels and live in a totally green world. We should have done that a while ago. We should get that done now.\n\nEmma Warren\n\nSpeaking of utopia, I wanted to talk to you about the womenâs strike, the original one in Iceland in 1975. We have the photograph on the screen here because this taps into what youâre saying about your utopian interest at the moment is, around the environment. This was an iconic moment in Icelandic history, where 90% of the women went out on strike. I believe that when it was originally called Womenâs Strike, less people joined, but when they renamed it Womenâs Day Off, everyone came out. I just wondered, were you there on that day?\n\nBjÃ¶rk\n\nYes. I was ten. With my mom. We just had another one.\n\nEmma Warren\n\nIs it an annual thing, or was it just that it happened a couple of days ago as a response to something else?\n\nBjÃ¶rk\n\nNo, I think itâs still 14% that women have as wages less than guys. Even though that gap is the least in the world today, in Iceland â bragging, sorry â weâre still trying to get rid of it. So women went yesterday, left their jobs at 14.38 oâclock, because thatâs how much percentage there is in the gap, and went downtown and protested. Thereâs really nice footage of them on YouTube now, everybody chanting. I was very proud of them.\n\nEmma Warren\n\nWhat Iâm interested in is your nine, ten year old self â you went out there with, Iâm guessing, your family â if that sight sowed the seeds of what you generally refer to as punk or hardcore. Whether or not that gave you the punk or hardcore feeling of seeing all the women in your community stand up to do what they wanted to.\n\nBjÃ¶rk\n\nIt had a big effect on me. I was in the music scene in Iceland as a teenager. Half of it was girls, and I was brought up to think that the girls are just as important and as strong as guys. So it wasnât until I went abroad that I would hit walls. I was maybe 30 years old. So I thought that put light on this, and try to show other women and guys that a society exists and functions where we are equal.\n\nEmma Warren\n\nDid that inform the way you were in bands with lots of guys in your teens?\n\nBjÃ¶rk\n\nPart of that scene, there were a lot of girls.\n\nEmma Warren\n\nFor me, I think, what a wonderful thing for a child to come up and see all those people standing up for themselves, and absolutely something to be very proud of. If weâre going to take it back to some of the stuff thatâs happening now, some of the people here will have seen the VR exhibition. The new video has a capacity for you to use your hands. Are these representations of your hands?\n\nMatilda Abraham\n\nHello. Thank you so much for being here, I think weâre just so privileged to be hanging out with you. I just wanted to ask about how you were talking about letting go, getting to that 1000% thing with singing or performing or any aspect of expressing your music. I was wondering if you have any advice for practicing that, and being able to just let go immediately, just go for it.\n\nBjÃ¶rk\n\nYeah, like I said before, at these events I drink a thousand coffees, and Iâm probably guilty of making it all sound really simple. But itâs easy to sometimes talk about things afterwards, right? But I definitely have issues like everyone. I pick my daughter up from school, I go to family birthday parties, all these everyday things. You trying to find the sublime in that can be tricksy, you know? I tend to go on walks outside. Thatâs really helpful for me, and when Iâve traveled Iâve found it very hard to be in cities because of this reason. Thatâs why I quite like being in cities by water, because itâs quite easyâ¦ When you walk by water, itâs maybe not even about the water, but when you walk by the ocean, at least 180 degrees is empty. Itâs about space more than anything else.\n\nBut solitude is not the only way. Thatâs one of the reasons I love DJing, especially with friends where weâre all doing it together and itâs not like me onstage, but more getting lost in that moment. One of my prime inspirational moments has been a moment on the dancefloor, a moment like that, where you just get lost in it all. I really love feeling small and trusting the universe or whatever, or âthat song,â the particular song youâre listening to very loudly, you just merge into it and become part of a flow, and then you get rid of this burden that life sometimes can be. But like anyone, Iâm trying every day and Iâve got different methods. One method works for a year and then it doesnât work anymore, and I just basically do my best. Confessionals with friends, one-on-ones, they are pretty epic and helpful too. Anything helps, right?\n\nDani Shivers\n\nHi, thank you for being here. Iâm really interested in your visual work and symbolism. I know it plays a big role in your art, and I was wondering if a mask, or the mask, means something, or if they have a story or thereâs a story behind them.\n\nBjÃ¶rk\n\nI think my visual work has mostly been with collaborators, and I think the way I look at it is I was in bands for ten years, and then I started being bossy with my music, and wanting to make my own music, mostly myself, or at least 80 or 90%. And then the visual thing became more collaborative, like group work. But at the end of the day, the directors I work with, and the photographers, they have the authorship. I like that.\n\nThe masks is something I probably started doing myself. I would both buy masks and find them and then make some very simplistically myself, and they would stand for different things. And then my collaborator and partner-in-crime James Merry, who is here with us now, actually didnât sleep for one night, and presented me in the morning with a mask, like a surprise. And I was like, âWhat!â Kind of what I was trying to do myself but didnât have the craft talent to do myself. but then he obviously took it way further. That sort of collaboration startedâ¦ Like, for example, the mask Iâm wearing now he made, and it started from me wanting to make something come out of my vocal cords, and it was that simple. Thatâs what I said, and then he totally did everything.\n\nSometimes itâs really just basic like that. And then, when I feel this connection like I do with James â which is really intense and really strong, one of the most strongest connections Iâve felt â the best thing you can do is you just let people rip. And most of the masks now that James has done, heâs totally done in his own space, and they come from his own ideas. But they are kind of based on this connection that we have, and I think thatâs probably why it works with this period, and probably with my face, and probably stuff that I donât know about. But obviously, the mask on its own is a very interesting thing, because itâs a way to hide, but also a way to reveal. Iâve felt like Iâve got burned from the amount of photographs that are taken of me, and itâs kind of with phones and selfie culture and the internet. I go to a concert, and I can feel the [impersonates a camera clicking] around me the whole night. Itâs a really weird energy. Having a mask, I feel more protected. I feel like I can be more myself, and accept the fact that part of my job is being public. I get that â itâs self-inflicted, right? But I also think itâs important to make it yours.\n\nI think with celebrity and with the selfie and blah, blah, blahâ¦ One thing the internet has done in the last ten years, fifteen years, is itâs emphasized that each celebrity is different. Actually, you know, fifteen years ago before people had laptops, people just presumed all celebrities were the same. âI want my autograph, I want to take my photo with you.â It would be the same demands on celebrities 24/7. One thing thatâs good about the internet is that each person is different now. People know, âOkay, donât bother this person. She doesnât like that, she just wants to live her own life.â And then there are the other people who want to be photographed a hundred times a day, and thatâs okay. I think the mask is kind of my, instead of moaning about that, is actually make it into something thatâs fun and creative and also collaborative, because I really love working with people, and itâs really been a blessing and a privilege to see someone as talented as James Merry blossom.\n\nAuâur\n\nHi. Hae, takk fyrir ad vera herna med okkurspeaks. You spoke earlier about nationality and time, how you embrace your nationality but still donât want to become patriotic, like fodurlandsrunk or something. I was wondering if you could just elaborate on how toâ¦ Because Iâve been listening to all of these participants, and I listen to them, and itâs like, âThis really sounds like itâs from Cape Town, this sounds like itâs coming from Tokyo,â but at the same timeâ¦ Basically, if you could elaborate on how to embrace your roots without, you know, doing it too much, I guess.\n\nBjÃ¶rk\n\nThank you, thatâs a good question. I think itâs something you re-evaluate over and over again, and you have to adjust it all the time, because it can be a crutch. You know, I could just be wearing a woolen sweater with a Viking helmet and it would be a little lazy, perhaps. But then, you canât go away from it too much, because that informs me a lot, who I am. My accent in English will always be a bit dodgy. My outlook â for example, my relationship with nature â itâs really hard to explain it sometimes to foreigners, because they think itâs some hippie, âLetâs all move into a cave with a guitar and butterflies.â Itâs like, âNo, thatâs not what itâs about.â Actually, nature in Iceland is hardcore. Thereâs nothing soft about volcanic explosions and an earthquake â itâs brutal. I think collaborating with nature is more about, in Iceland weâve got so much space. We donât really have animals, we donât really have trees, we donât have skyscrapers. Itâs just empty. We just have geology screaming in our faces, which is actually pretty brutal. Itâs nothing hippie-dippie, itâs not that romantic at all.\n\nI think youâll always be from where you are, and sometimes itâs most beautiful when it shows itself without you being too conscious about it. Itâs not too organized, you know? But then I will contradict that and say itâs good to know where youâre from once in a while. Like, for example, when I did the string arrangements for Homogenic I was like, âOkay, Iâm going to do these sorts of songs we know, and all these romantic, national songs all the Icelandic people sing when theyâre drunk. I was actually with Bobby, Haxan Cloak, he came to Iceland, and we ended up drunk outside a bar two weeks ago, and there was no after-party. We literally stood on the main street, and it was a group of 15 people who actually didnât know each other that well doing different harmonies and some really difficult choral Icelandic songs, just improvising the harmonies and jumping in-between alto or soprano or whatever. Just screaming, top of their lungs, with their really drunk and warbly voices. Weâve all been there, right? Yes. But thatâs definitely part of what we are.\n\nAnd I hear it â for example, I just listened to a JÃ³hann JÃ³hannsson album last night before I DJed, and it was some choral music there. I think you embrace, but if itâs too much you walk away from it. You embrace it, you walk away from it. And then, it also means different things. Iâm sure coming from Cape Town, it can be amazing to be associated with Die Antwoord or â I canât remember what that film was called, District 9 or whatever â and thatâs cool for three years, and on your fourth youâre just really bored of it. Thatâs not what itâs about. Itâs actually about my grandmother in the suburbs and that particular tea we used to drink. Itâs just an ongoing process that you have to be keep being truthful. If it turns you on, it works, if it doesnât, it doesnât work. It just has to be something like that.\n\nPan Daijing\n\nCan I ask? Iâm here in the back. Thanks for the lecture. I have two quick questions for you. The first one is that I reckon during the process of shaping your concept youâve always taken consideration of other elements in different forms of art, like visual art or design, like your collaboration with Andrew and Alexander. Iâm just curious that, living in the era that definitely overflows with information, how do you filter all these information sources and pick the one that would serve you, to shape your concept and realize your concept, and how does your relationship with your team and your collaborators help you and support you to realize those? The second question â and please skip it if itâs too personal â itâs in regard to having children, because Iâve heard a lot of female artists, especially those that have decided not to have children until their very late years or through their life, think that having kids can be an obstacle for realizing their career or their artistic goals. How do you feel about having kids and the role of having family in your life? Do you think having kids is a trouble? I mean, of course itâs a loving experience, but Iâm sure thereâs a lot of downsides to it, too, and Iâd like to know your ideas about. Thank you.\n\nBjÃ¶rk\n\nIâll first do the collaboration question. The best way to describe it is kind of like friendships. Any given year â I donât know if you look back five years or something and you go, âOkay, that year I felt really connected to John and Susan, but Paul and Anna werenât really, I just didnât get them, I just donât know why.â And then five minutes later it will be the other way around. Youâll be, âOh, I feel so connected to Anna now, we really resonate and we can talk for eight hours and we still seem to be nourishing each other and I donât know why.â And I think with my collaborators itâs very similar. You bump into several people for various different reasons, and then you do something together, and once itâs done youâre like, âOh, are we going to have more conversation or not?â I think itâs very important to be really respectful of everyoneâs journey. Everybody has their own journey to take, and you have to let them, after each project, have this feeling that we might not work together again, and then rediscover, âActually, our next paths do continue a little bit together.â For me, Iâm really blue-eyed.\n\nI really believe in this thing, where if you find this point where itâs nourishing both, usually in very, very different areas, but it sort of has the feeling. But I think you can really trust yourself instinctively the same way as you trusted in friendships. You know if you are being on the receiving end or the other way around, if itâs lopsided, if youâre just sitting there listening to someoneâs problems for years but itâs not going the other way. Itâs like, âHmm, thereâs something not right about this.â And then the other way around, youâre getting so much from this person but youâre not capable of feeding the, you know, and thatâs really sad and it just feels wrong.\n\nI think itâs the same with collaborations, and I just feel really, really, really blessed that I bumped into Alejandro, Arca. He actually reached out to me and then we are still on this journey together. Every morning Iâm like, âOkay, maybe itâs over now,â but no, we have still one more thing to do together, and one of the reasons is that heâs obviously doing his work a billion percent, and Iâve been able to be a third ear, and then it goes the other way around, you know? So it feels, at least still, like itâs really nourishing both ways. Itâs a really different story with Andy Huang. Heâs obviously someone whoâs just so talented and so fertile and so technically incredible, it doesnât matter what riddle you put on the table, he always, always solves it. And anything we do together I just feel really lucky that he put a loop on his own mission for me, and hopefully I feel he feels like itâs his mission to, you know, and that itâs something he can put his name on and be proud of. I donât know if that answers your question.\n\nWith children... I obviously come from a family. I have six younger brothers and sisters, and then my son is actually older than my youngest brother. Iâve just always had a lot of kids pulling my skirt while Iâm working, and I feel a bit odd if thereâs not one person doing this. Thatâs sort of something Iâm used to. Familyâs really strong in Iceland, but also youâve got a lot of babysitters. I feel sorry for people who are in cities with maybe no relatives there to help them out. Itâs hard. Or maybe one, you know? Iâve had all of my six brothers and sisters babysit for me or come with me on tour at some time, so itâs a family affair.\n\nI was really lucky in the Sugarcubes, when I had a baby and we first went on tour, nobody asked me, âAre you going to leave him behind?â Nobody asked that question, and I only noticed ten years later that was actually quite a feminist thing. It was just, of course weâd take him along, and of course weâd bring our babysitter, and of course the tour will pay for the babysitter, it wonât come off my wages. Itâs like a communal thing. I was probably spoiled in that way, but maybe the good side of that is hopefully I could inspire someone. I know what you mean. I have looked up to women, artists, especially the generation before me born in the â40s, who are like, âOkay, the only way to be an artist is to have this sacrifice, and not have a child.â I get it. I probably would have done the same if I was born in those years. I donât know. Who knows? But maybe itâs also the cultural thing in Iceland, Iâm not sure.\n\nI believe that you can have a family, you can have kids, you can make music, you can do all of the things together, and they should coexist. I donât believe in this isolation of things, I believe in the flow between everything, and that itâs actually good for kids to see a parent that, âActually, I donât have time for you now, I have to finish this thing.â Itâs good for them to see a person do that and deal with life, you know? Thatâs the best school sometimes. Thatâs my answer, I guess.\n\nJuliÃ¡n Mayorga\n\nSorry, I got really excited. âPlease here!â Hello. My question is related to what you were saying about redirecting public exposure, being a public figure and redirecting that into a creative force. I was wondering, how do you deal with the public expectation and the media expectations, and maybe your own expectations every time you are involved in a new project, and if that maybe gets in the way of your creative force.\n\nBjÃ¶rk\n\nYou mean as a musician, or visually?\n\nJuliÃ¡n Mayorga\n\nAs a musician, yeah. Like, every time youâre making a new album, if you have expectations likeâ¦ We all have expectations when youâre about to make a new album, right? We all want to hear whatâs the next BjÃ¶rk album. So Iâm wondering if maybe you feel pressure from the media or from the public, I donât know.\n\nBjÃ¶rk\n\nI actually donât feel pressure from the media and the public, and I think I would like to thank that for being for ten years in bands. I was in the background in bands, and I was a lot younger than the other members, and I didnât realize until later that was actually a really good school. I saw the hard way that if you do things that youâre supposed to do, it always goes really wrong. We actually went through a couple of times, âOh, lets do the album people think we should make now,â and it just went horribly wrong. So I actually learned that. I was actually quite late when I started doing my own music â I was 27 â and then I was like, âOkay, the one lesson I learned was I am the only person whoâs me, and Iâm the only one who knows what seeds are growing inside me.â When you release an album, itâs like the plant is ripe and thereâs fruits and shit, but if youâre giving oranges this time around, it doesnât mean like the seeds in your stomach are another orange tree. You are the only one who knows what that is, so youâre sort of responsible for protecting that, because youâll know. How should Jack and Jill know? They donât know. Theyâre not you. I think thatâs very important.\n\nI mean, I use time a lot. When it comes to my work methods, I really use time a lot. Like, Iâll do a song and Iâll work on it for half an hour, and Iâll just leave it and Iâll work on some other song. A week later, Iâll be like, âAm I ready? No, Iâm not ready.â Three weeks later Iâll be like, âToday is the day.â And Iâll maybe work on it for only half an hour. I think thereâs a window that you feel you can actually add to that conversation, and then when youâre just going into some routine, or some conveyor belt behavior, just stop. Just go and have an orange juice or something. Just leave it. What Iâm trying to say, in a very clumsy way, is that if you wait, and look at it again in three months time, you can be the other person that sees it from the outside. You can be both the maker and the critic. The way to be both of these things yourself is to use time.\n\nSome songs, like for example âAtom Dance,â it took me four years to make that song. It didnât make Biophilia. It made Vulnicura. I think the key is just to leave it and wait for the right moment, until itâs ripe, but not stand there and go, âBe ready the way I want now!â Nothing will happen. It has to be the other way around, I think. Does that make sense?\n\nEmma Warren\n\nOkay, I think one more question. Where is it coming from, which direction?\n\nNicholas G. Padilla\n\nHello. Thank you for the performance yesterday and thank you for the lecture. My question for you is, seeing how the universe is blessing this era by allowing humans to reach this actualized form of Singularity-\n\nBjÃ¶rk\n\nSorry, can you say that again? I didnât hear it. Can you be a little clearer?\n\nNicholas G. Padilla\n\nSorry. Seeing as how the universe is blessing this era by allowing humans to reach this actualized form of Singularity, how much of that is allowing artists to immerse their audience in their subjective dimensional states of channeled external energy?\n\nBjÃ¶rk\n\nIâm sorry, English is my second language so I donât fully understand it.\n\nEmma Warren\n\nI think the question is about, âWhy is this moment in time a good time for people to be making music?â\n\nNicholas G. Padilla\n\nWell, itâs many art forms, so itâs like speaking on a multi-sensory level. So itâs not just music, itâs also visuals. Itâs also like in the exhibition you have, thereâs the headset, which also is motion-tracking the head of the individual wearing it, so itâs complete immersion in a different environment that the artist has made for the observer or the audience to be able to absorb through their spiritual connection, or through their external sources, whether it be demons or saints that are embedded inside of the subjective truth of the artist. So, thatâs what Iâm trying to get at.\n\nBjÃ¶rk\n\nI would say that the digital exhibition is very impulsive, actually, and very collaborative. Iâm doing it with a lot of people. I feel really right about it. It is very punk, and we knew from the start it would have a lot of mistakes, but it kind of had to be mistakes made out in the open, and I think in that sense it is maybe what you are saying. Like, itâs a child of 2016, very much. Like Iâve said before, Vulnicura was made in this bubble at home, very protected, and the only album I have that has chronology. So it felt like if there was any structure of any album Iâd done that could take this kind of experimentation, it would be this format, VR. And I think also, because itâs so experimental and itâs so many companies we work with, with so many different softwares and goggles and groups of teams, itâs been one of the most complex things weâve done, ever. I kind of knew that when we headed into that world, so I felt, well, Vulnicura could take it, because it is that sort of old school, singer-songwriter, almost Greek tragedy-like narrative. Itâs almost so old school that it could take this crazy-ass improv tech session. I hope so. It is still in the making.\n\nWe still have a few videos we havenât completed, and think everything will make more sense, because thereâs one, like a homepage, where you see the whole thing when the album comes out, thereâs also going to be room for the string album, for the notation, for all these other aspects. You can listen to it linear, or not linear. I will then try to update and make it of that moment, which will probably be 2017 by this time. But maybe that answers your question in another way. I do think it is a little bit a role of the artist to use the tools that you are using in your everyday life, if itâs a phone or a laptop or VR or iChat or whatever it is. Skyping.\n\nAlso, itâs just more honest, and just the fact that you donât know. Already, strings are actually kind of lazy, because theyâve already gone through this process. The symphony orchestra was the VR of the 1600s or 1700s, because it was like this machine of 40 people in a room all partaking in one thing. Iâm sure there were some horrible string songs. You had these composers writing a whole symphony in their heads, and theyâd never even heard it. They didnât have any Sibelius. And then they would hear it after ten years, and itâs gone through a lot of trial-and-error, and thereâs probably a lot of stuff in it that didnât work, that was horrible, you know? The things that we are listening to today are the few moments, 5%, where it actually was a really good idea.\n\nI like roots and history. My voice is the same human voice as has been for thousands of years, so I try to escape that a lot of time, but believe me, it doesnât work that much. So I already have a lot of history, and I have strings, and I was in indie bands. But I like also to have this conversation and take a risk in being part of the conversation of the moment, and make mistakes in the open. I think itâs important for an artist to be in that heat, and with that sort of risks you make a lot of mistakes, but also the things youâre proudest of on your deathbed are probably those sort of things. Did that answer it?\n\nNicholas G. Padilla\n\nYeah, to a degree. Thank you.\n\nEmma Warren\n\nWell, youâre dealing with the universe. Really all thatâs left to say is BjÃ¶rk, thank you very, very much."
