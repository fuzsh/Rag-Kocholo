        "text": "Björk collaborated with app developers, scientists, writers, inventors, musicians, and instrument makers to create a unique exploration of the universe and its physical forces—particularly those where music, nature and technology meet. The project is inspired by and explores these relationships between musical structures and natural phenomena, from the atomic to the cosmic. Born Björk Gudmundsdottir on November 21, 1965, in Reykjavik, Iceland., Björk founded the band the Sugarcubes in 1986 before striking out on her own to a hugely successful solo career in 1993. In 2000, Björk appeared on the big screen in the critically acclaimed film Dancer in the Dark. She also scored the film and won the Best Actress prize at the Cannes Film Festival for her performance."
