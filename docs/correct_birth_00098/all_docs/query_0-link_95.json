        "text": "Who is Bjork?\n\nBjörk Gudmundsdottir was born on 21 November 1965 in Iceland.\n\nBjork released her first record at just 11 and it proved popular in Iceland. According to Bjork.com:\n\n\"The songs were a mixture of covers translated into Icelandic, like the Beatles hit \"Fool On The Hill\" ('Alfur Út Úr Hól') and Stevie Wonder's song \"Your Kiss Is Sweet\" ('Búkolla'), but it also contained some songs written specifically for the album, like the title song \"Arabadrengurinn\" ('The Arab Boy') written by stepdad Sævar, and one instrumental flute-tribute to Icelandic painter Jóhannes Kjarval written & performed by none other than 11-year old Björk herself!\"\n\nBjork joined a group called Kukl, which split up and Bjork and others went off to form the excellent band, 'The Sugarcubes'. They became Iceland's biggest export. The Sugarcubes kicked off were formed on the day Björk's son was born and released Life's Too Good in 1988, but disbanded in 1992 and Bjork recommenced her solo career.\n\nIn 1996 Bjork was awarded 'Best Female International Artist' at The Brits - a few days later she famously had an altercation with an intrusive camerawoman at Bangkok airport.\n\nBjork's work includes: 'Debut' (1993), 'Post' (1995), 'SelmaSongs' (2000), and 'Vespertine' (2001).\n\nThe book called 'Bjork - A Project by Bjork' includes a lot of pictures of Bjork, but its highlight is a transcript of Bjork interviewing Sir David Attenborough.\n\nIt starts with a wonderful 'definition' of Bjork:\n\n\"Bjork: Artist. Species: human (-ish), sex: female, natural habitat: an ocean of sound, outstanding characteristic: instinctive curiosity.\"\n\nBjork won the best actress award at Cannes for her role in Lars Von Trier's 2000 film Dancer In The Dark. She also wrote the film score.\n\nOne of Bjork's most interesting albums is Medúlla (2004), which features Inuit throat singer Tanya Tagaq Gillis, Japanese acappella artist Dokaka and The Icelandic Choir, and other interesting artists.\n\nBjork was also a winner at World Music awards in 2005.\n\nBjork was voted the world's most eccentric star by readers of the BBC's Homes and Antiques magazine!\n\nIn 2006 Bjork and her boyfriend Matthew Barney launched Drawing Restraint 9 at the Venice Film Festival. The film, shot on a Japanese whaling vessel features Bjork and Barney as human beings who turn into whales.\n\nIn 2007 Bjork performing The Boho Dance, was one of the artists on the Joni Mitchell tribute album.\n\nIn May 2007, the BBC article 'Bjork tackles 'megamix' of issues', reported that:\n\n\"Icelandic singer Bjork has said she wanted to tackle a \"megamix\" of issues on her sixth album Volta ... produced by Timbaland and also featuring Antony Hegarty of Antony And The Johnsons, Volta features songs about religion, tsunamis and suicide bombers, as well as the singer's relationship with her teenage son.\"\n\nIn March 2008, The Guardian reported how Björk shouted \"Tibet! Tibet!\" at the end of her song Declare Independence at a concert in Shanghai.\n\nIn December 2008, Forbes revealed that Bjork was partnering with a financial services firm Reykjavik-based Audur Capital to raise money to invest in sustainable businesses in Iceland.\n\nIn May 2010 Bjork and Ennio Morricone shared the 2010 Polar Music prize, described in Sweden as the \"Nobel prize of music\".\n\nIn 2011, Bjork opened her Biophilia world tour at the opening of the Manchester International Festival.\n\nBack to Top"
