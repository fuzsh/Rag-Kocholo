        "text": "Well, it seems a new blog post has just arisen for you! It’s time for your Monday post!\n\nBjörk (It’s pronounced B-ee-yerk, by the way) is a very famous art-pop musician from Iceland. Seen as a bit of a misfit doll in the 1990’s and reinvented as a massively daring, not to mention, true artist over the few decades since, she is a lady who I find to be absolutely fascinating and admirable. I was introduced to most of her discography over the summer courtesy of a guide to her work and her life on YouTube (Credit: Deep Cuts) and I found her to be a highly dynamic songwriter who is never going to just walk into a studio and record her voice over a track, instead being intent on creating and writing all of her music, mostly on her own accord, completed with a visually striking range of costumes and a very flamboyant sense of imagination in her creative music videos. I’m yet to check out “Vulnicura” (2015) and “Volta” (2007), but I’m very fond of her experimentation on “Homogenic” (1997) “Vespertine” (2001), “Biophillia” (2011), which remain as three of my favourites records from her library. Her latest LP record, “Utopia” (2017) is also a surprising, but delightful, work of art. It’s a record that brings the roots in Björk’s love of nature and environment to the table, while experimenting with electronic instrumentation in interesting and exciting ways. “Arisen My Senses” is one of the main singles from the record, accompanied by an odd video which sees Björk born out of a giant womb and reincarnated as a butter-fly. It controversially features Arca, an artist from Venezuela, who co-produced the LP.\n\nIt’s an odd video, but I still think the idea is delivered very sweetly and the themes are easily decipherable. There’s a real beauty to the track which makes the video so good in it’s execution. It’s filled with lush synths that blast right into your ears and a style of writing that is more complex than you may think after a first listen, as Björk croons: “Just that kiss/Was all there is” and “Every cell in my body/Lined up for you” over a bed of winding electro-pop melodies and a chorus of ambient piano chords. It’s layout is excellent, with Björk putting her heart and soul into her vocal performance on the track, which is made even more effective if you have the context of the previous record, “Vulnicura”, a dark and bleak album she calls her “heartbreak” album, which was explicitly influenced by her real life split with long-time partner, Matthew Barney, in real-life. The lyrics, thematically, explore the ideas of finding love after loss and the emotion of infatuation after a long time of feeling empty and flat inside. It has one of the most gut-wrenching bridges that I think I’ve ever heard, as Björk fades out the synths and the layers of instruments, by simply calling out to her lover, with her lips trembling as our narrator, with: “For him I heed” and “am I keen or not too keen”, before the track ends as she chimes: “He sees me for who I am”, as the synths dissipate and the track fades into a simple flute melody. Overall, as you can probably tell from my writing, it’s a track that I could easily write about all day. There is loads to unpack here for fans of Björk, who were just over the moon to hear Björk making vibrant and colourful, new, material again. It’s a very impressive single and it becomes very emotional if you know about the story behind it. At that point, it’s simply just masterful!"
