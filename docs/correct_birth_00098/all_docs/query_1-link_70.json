        "text": "I call this Bjork Art, a form of Bjork fan art. I started doing these shortly after hearing Bjork's music for the first time. I hope she won't mind me calling it Bjork art. The true definition of Björk art is Björk's music!\n\nI don't know a lot about Bjork but I know her music. I have a lot of respect for what she does and the way she does it. I love Bjork's music and her originality, and I sometimes make things to express that. Bjork's music was the inspiration for these images and metal works. Music and art is what it's about! At a time when I thought I was near my end, Bjork's. music gave me distraction, enjoyment, perspective, strength, influence and inspiration! Believe it or not, Bjork music helped give me another chance at life. The first things I did were not very creative but they were a way for me to get back to doing my art again. They were inspired by her songs, her musical and artistic nature and her creative uniqueness.\n\nRepousse Bjork Art\n\nRepoussé is the ancient art of embossing or pressing shapes into metal to create a design. The design is drawn on a piece of metal and then a variety of tools are used to form different shape into the metal. Some shapes are hammered in and some are done with hand pressure and tools. The design is worked into the metal from both sides a little at a time. The metal is not forgiving so if a mistake is made it's usually permanent. After the tool work is done I use volcanic pumice, acids and polish to finish the surface. They take a while to do but it's worth it when they come out right, although they're never perfect."
