        "text": "Even though she is probably the world’s most famous Icelander (Leif Erikson may have discovered America, but he was no singer), not many people will realise that the release of Björk’s new album Volta this summer marks the 30th anniversary of her recording career. Not bad for a 41-year-old. Yet Björk remains, even for the devotee, ever full of surprises: a genre-hopper extraordinaire, each new release packed with new fearless experiments and expertly chosen collaborators from all corners of the musical world. The phrase “Björk by numbers” is pretty much oxymoronic.\n\nFrom a young age, she soaked up all kinds of influences (classical theory at music school, classic rock from her parents, jazz from her grandparents), and by 11, the young Björk Guðmundsdóttir done enough absorbing, and was ready to put back out.\n\nHer debut proper, Björk, was recorded with the help of her stepfather’s musician friends and released on Falkinn records in 1977. It featured covers of The Beatles’ The Fool On The Hill (or Alfur ‘Ut ‘U Hol) and Alma Mira by early Björk favourite Edgar Winter. It’s the first item in catalogue that offers endless joy for the collector, from early Icelandic rarities to a wealth of beautifully designed singles, boxes and promos packed with achingly desirable remixes. The record went platinum in Iceland, but even at 11, Björk could take or leave stardom. “Everyone at my school hated the record and they hated me, “ she later told NME. The musicians wanted me to make a second one but I didn’t want to. I wanted to be with kids my own age for a bit.” So, she dyed her hair orange and at 12, formed an allfemale punk band called Spit & Snot, who screamed about the rubbishness of boys. True to her later preoccupation with rhythm, Björk played drums. After a brief spell in the proggy Exodus, she moved on to Tappi Tíkkarrass, a pop-punk band who took their name from their bassist’s descriptively gifted father, who said that their music “fitted like a cork in a bitch’s arse”(Tappi Tíkkarrass meaning “cork the bitch’s arse” in Icelandic).\n\nIn 1982, following TT’s demise, Bjork fell in love (zing, boom!) with Thór Eldon, the father of her son Sindri, and through him met hip surrealist poet collective Medusa, who gave birth to the dark, postpunky KUKL (whose name means ‘witchcraft’). This band managed to make it out of Iceland, releasing two LPs in the UK, where they toured with Crass and Flux Of Pink Indians (Flux bassist Derek Birkett would later set up the independent label to which Björk remains signed to this day, One Little Indian). Once, when KUKL played at an outdoor festival in Iceland, the crowd clamoured for Björk to sing a hit. She promptly jumped off stage and defecated in the middle of the floor. These days, fortunately, her reaction to crowd requests is a little less direct.\n\nThe intensely serious KUKL eventually imploded, leaving Björk distraught, but it wasn’t long before Eldon and former KUKLer Einar Örn set up a new company, Smekkleysa SM SF, or Bad Taste Limited, a subversive art organization with the motto “world domination or die” who believed that the worst enemy of creativity was good taste. “We wore pink and encouraged irresponsibility…. Einar drove a huge, impractical convertible and everyone hated us. It was a magical time, and out of this grew The Sugarcubes,” said Bjork. The new band, filled with a lighthearted, pranksterish spirit miles from Kukl, made their debut in August 1986, by which time Bjork and Thór had split amicably. By the following September, their first UK release, the woozy, bewitching Birthday, was declared Melody Maker single of the week. The Sugarcubes became a flavour of the year, and toured the US with their debut, the joyous Life’s Too Good (released in six different coloured Day-Glo sleeves). Their follow-up the next year, Here Today, Tomorrow Next Week! (also released sung in Icelandic as Illur Arfur!), was less well received. To many, the wide-eyed abandon of the music and Björk’s luscious singing was obscured by the surrealistic buffoonish spoken word of Einar Örn. Björk was irritated by such criticism: to her, it was all part of The Sugarcubes’ ethos: the songs weren’t meant to be tasteful. The prank finally came to an end in 1992 following the release of their third album, Stick Around For Joy, and a US tour with U2 (the ultimate in bad taste, the band thought).\n\nBjörk had been busy branching out: she indulged her early fondness for jazz by releasing a charming record of Icelandic jazz standards, Gling-Gló, with the Tríó Guðmundar Ingólfssonar in 1990. The album was a huge hit in Iceland, outselling Here Today… and going platinum. She also contributed vocals to two tracks on 808 State’s Ex:El album, a collaboration that would prove valuable in the future.\n\nBuzzing with ideas, she moved to London, where she felt creative energy and the right sort of people to bounce concepts off could be found. She found her perfect foil in Bristolian DJ Nellee Hooper, who had worked on Soul II Soul’s Club Classics Volume II and Sinead O’Connor’s chart-topping cover of Prince’s Nothing Compares 2 U. Hooper added a smoothness to Björk’s experimental fervour and love of hardcore dance (Public Enemy and Black Dog were favourites). The lyrics to Big Time Sensuality record Björk’s excitement with her new partner in crime: “something huge is coming up/And we’re both included”. She wasn’t wrong: in 1993, when her putative Debut tumbled out amid the chirpy, retro of Britpop and the frustrated spleen of grunge, it seemed a magical, positive record, its lyrics and its sound argument that life didn’t have to be misery: other people were an exploration and joy was a responsibility. It blended world music, jazz, Icelandic folk, house and purest pop into a immediately accessible whole. She walked off with Best International Female artist and Newcomer at the 1994 Brits, where she performed a riveting, subversive duet of the Stones’ (I Can’t Get No) Satisfaction with Polly Harvey (having wisely rejected the organisers suggestion of singing with Meat Loaf).\n\nUncomfortable with indie darling status, she followed it up in 1995 with the harder, spikier Post, with its sharper contrasts and the aggressive, piledriving opener Army Of Me. The album was recorded in Nassau in the Bahamas, with Björk singing many of her takes on the beach into a portable tape recorder. For three of the tracks, (Isobel, Hyperballad and You’ve Been Flirting Again) she collaborated with 808 State’s Graham Massey and veteran Brazilian string arranger Eumir Deodato, who arranged the theme to 2001: A Space Odyssey. He was impressed with her bravery, telling Rolling Stone “When I heard her material, I freaked out and I said, “What are you doing? This is crazy, this is so difficult, to take this kind of style to the people!” The people came with her, though, and It’s Oh So Quiet (a renamed cover of Blow A Fuse by 40s actress Betty Hutton) became Bjork’s first UK Top Five hit, reaching No 4. In November the following year, she treated her fans to a thank-you/Christmas present in the shape of Telegram, a remix album with reimaginings of tracks from Post by artists as diverse as classical percussionist Evelyn Glennie, hip-hopper Dobie and drum’n’bass artist Dilinja. Collaborations and remixes have always been an important part of Björk’s work: not because she needs the help, but because she relishes the challenge. “I could easily have done an album on my own ages ago and done everything myself, but that’s not really an ambition for me,” she claims. “It was always more challenging to work with other people as different to you as possible, so you can learn from them.”\n\nThe high-class Homogenic appeared in 1997, marking a move to a more adult pop sound. Persistently dogged by the image she’d set up for herself with Birthday and Human Behaviour as a pixieish, elfin, nature child, Björk was determined to show the world her womanly roar. From the high drama of Jóga, a love song to her best friend, via the modern girl’s manifesto of Bachelorette (again with strings by Deodato) to the furious techno panic attack of Pluto, it’s an album that’s in-your-face but also, with more luscious strings from Deodato, soon under your skin. Björk felt it was the closest she’d got to the sounds she heard in her mind, telling Raygun “this album is the most me yet. But my friends tell me not to fool myself. The only thing that will surprise people from me is if there are no surprises.”\n\nThe next surprise was a corker: she already had starred in an Icelandic independent picture called The Juniper Tree in 1986, but now found herself part of a much higher-profile film project under the direction of celebrated Danish maverick Lars Von Trier. Originally hired just to write the soundtrack, Björk eventually accepted, after much cajoling from Von Trier, the starring role of Selma in the alternately gruelling and charming Dancer In The Dark (the title taken from a song by Björk’s heroine Joni Mitchell). The result was one of the most powerful performances ever committed to celluloid by a pop star, and deservedly won her the Best Actress award at Cannes in 2000. She didn’t take anything home at the Oscars, but settled for stealing the show in her infamous swan dress (complete with ‘eggs’ which she ‘laid’ around the ceremony, to the bemusement of staff). Filming was not easy for director or star, however, and there were reports of angry clashes, Björk walking off set at one point.\n\nFrom the stress of the big screen, Björk retreated into the intimate cosiness of 2001’s Vespertine, an album that contains some of her most beautiful moments. “Homogenic, for me, was very emotionally confrontational and was very dramatic, both in the melodic sense of the strings and the distorted beats,” she said at the time. “Vespertine is sort of the opposite. Very introverted, very quiet and calm and peaceful, and at peace with one’s self.” Vespertine also saw her take her penchant for outré videos to the limit, with some beautiful but erotically charged promos. The ‘body piercing’ video for the raw, beautiful Pagan Poetry, in particular, has to be seen to be believed and was banned by US MTV. The year afterwards, Björk released a greatest hits box set, Family Tree (Björk means ‘birch tree’ in Icelandic), with artwork by Iceland artist Gabriela Fridriksdottir. The set consisted of a book of lyrics entitled Words, five 3-inch CDs of rare material and a regular-sized compact disc of Greatest Hits selected by Björk (a single CD Greatest Hits was released at the same time, this one selected by her fans via her website). She described the experience of compiling it as “like spring cleaning, complete with nostalgic, boring and mushy moments. But ultimately, it was liberating to have an absolutely clean attic. Now, I have a brandnew chalkboard on which to work.”\n\nHer next doodlings on this blank slate would take her further into the avant garde than ever before. For 2004’s Medúlla, she recorded 14 songs using only the human voice for instrumentattion. Only one track, the exuberant, insistent Triumph Of A Heart, would be at all at home on a dancefloor: the others were spooky, abstracted, relying more on texture than rhythm. She drew in ever more unusual sparring partners: ex Faith No More singer Mike Patton, The Roots’ human beatbox Rahzel, and her long-time hero Robert Wyatt.\n\nMedúlla was not an immediate record, and one easier to admire than love, but each listen brings you to closer in to its strange, interior world. Björk described it as a physical, bodily record, and explained that the title “means ‘marrow’ in medical language, in Latin. Not just your bone marrow, but marrow in the kidneys and marrow in your hair, too. It’s about getting to the essence of something, and with this album being all vocals, that made sense.”\n\nOne track, Oceania, aimed to get to the essence of the whole human race: its lyrics gave voice to the sea, contemplating the evolution of humans. It was written for the 2004 Summer Olympics opening ceremony in Athens, where Björk peformed following the Parade Of Nations, dressed in an enormous, billowing blue dress that seemed to flow around the entire stadium.\n\nOceania’s gentle take on a mothering sea was cruelly rebutted, however, by the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. Like the rest of the world, Björk was dumbfounded by the images of destruction and desolation beamed around the world on Boxing Day, and put a call on her website asking her fans to donate remixes of Army Of Me for a charity album to help relieve the suffering. Over 600 reimaginings of the song were sent in, which Björk then whittled down 20, including a charming death metal take and a contribution from young fan and fellow art-pop experimenter Patrick Wolf. Army Of Me: Remixes & Cover Versions was released in 2005, and all profits were donated to UNICEF. For her next release, she did one thing she swore she’d never do: acted again. Her collaboration with her artist partner Matthew Barney, (the father of her daughter Ísadóra) could hardly be called a movie in the conventional sense, though: Drawing Restraint 9, a bizarre dreamscape in which two lovers meet aboard a whaling ship and conduct a Japanese inspired tea ceremony, is demanding, but beautiful. Björk also wrote the music, which sounded not a million miles from the sonic world of Medúlla, but even more abstracted. “It isn’t like, ‘Hello, this is me!’” she said. “It’s music that is all around you, and I’ve never done anything like that before.”\n\nStill finding new beginnings and new surprises , she’s never done anything quite like her new album Volta before, either. Reportedly looking for someone to take her out of her comfort zone, she plumped for hip-hop’s über beatmaster, Timbaland,. The album’s name references Italian physicist Alessandro Volta, inventor of the battery, and is fittingly spilling with energy: her collaborations with Timbaland in particular are bound to see this most erudite and unpredictable of pop stars nound for the charts, and the dancefloor, once again. Wherever she goes from there, you can be sure you won’t have expected it.\n\ni’ve seen it all\n\nBjörk is well known for her beautiful, bizarre videos, shot by the hippest directors. Here’s five of her best…\n\nViolently Happy Björk plays on her “loopy puffin-eater” image by letting Jean-Baptiste Mondino put her in a padded cell, where she a gang of models shave their heads, dance around and disembowel hapless teddy bears.\n\nArmy Of Me Björk drives an enormous juggernaut through a dark city, flashing some scary metal teeth. She goes to see the dentist, who is, naturally, a gorilla. He finds an huge diamond in her mouth, which she feeds to her truck, before setting off a bomb in an art gallery. Don’t think about it too hard.\n\nAll Is Full Of Love This Chris Cunningham effort won an MTV Breakthrough Video award. It features a Björk-faced robot finding hot electronic love with another Björkfaced robot on a factory line.\n\nPagan Poetry Directed by Nick Knight, Björk’s most controversial video ever shows her in a topless Alexander McQueen dress, intercut with distorted, did-I-just-see-that images of sex and body piercing."
