        "text": "ONE OF BJÖRK'S other effectively humanoid tricks is a kind of lingua-scat in which she deliberately mispronounces English words and vowel sounds. At one point, on the song \"Immature\" (\"eeem-ma-cheeeoooah,\" in Björkese), she talks about how \"ex-ta-reemly lacy I feel,\" and it's some time before you realize that she doesn't feel like a doily, but, you know, sluggish. On \"All Neon Like,\" she sings the word \"nourish\" over and over, also \"fetuslike,\" and it takes quite some time to figure out what she's saying, much less why.\n\nHomogenic does boast some elegant touches, particularly the use of an Icelandic string octet--led by Brazilian composer/arranger Eumir Deodato (best known for the disco remix 2001)-- for color within songs that otherwise rely on a variety of electronic instruments, beats and textures. Some of these are rather pleasing, particularly the one that sounds like a heartbeat that opens the entire album, and the octet is also very effective, particularly on the single \"Joga\" and the dramatic \"Bachelorette.\"\n\nThroughout, Björk sings with almost operatic control, but her lyrics sometimes verge on self-involved nonsense: \"I am the hunter!\"; \"I am the branch broken from your tree!\"; \"I'm so bored with cowards\"; \"It's obvious ... it's obvious ... it's obvious.\"\n\nAs she hinted on \"Bedtime Stories\" (\"Let's get unconscious, honey\"), Björk is hip to Freud, and one of her themes is the innate surrealness of life and language. But it's a thin line between revelatory stream of consciousness and mere nonsense. When you add in the subjective nature of music and Björk's decided anti-pop bent, her records can become troublingly obtuse: danceable at times and listenable in a highly technical way but never quite free from calculation, the way all the best pop should be.\n\nBjörk should be commended for her commitment to experimentation, but although trying to figure out her lyrics can be fun, it's a disappointment when you've finally done so to realize how empty they are at bottom. Somehow, one expects more depth from a woman who is willing to dress up like a fuzzy bear, say strange things in public and just basically be a goof. When the depth's not there, one is all the more disappointed.\n\n[ Metro | Metroactive Central | Archives ]"
