Bush followed the playbook of the Reagan administration which declared a “war on terrorism” in 1984, linking terrorism to nation-states.\n\nU.S. forces mainly fought insurgents, not terrorists, in Afghanistan and Iraq. Bin Laden escaped to Pakistan in December 2001.\n\nThe Afghanistan Papers, released in 2019, documented how senior U.S. officials “failed to tell the truth about the war in Afghanistan through the 18-year campaign, making rosy pronouncements they knew to be false and hiding unmistakable evidence the war had become unwinnable,” according to Washington Post correspondent Craig Whitlock.[1]\n\nDuring the 1980s, the Reagan administration was on friendly terms with Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein, providing military assistance to Iraq in its war against Iran.\n\nThough Saddam Hussein had nothing to do with the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the Bush administration made oil-rich Iraq the next target, claiming that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction. No such weapons were found.[2]\n\nOn Feb. 15, 2003, between six and eleven million people demonstrated in 650 cities around the world against the threatened U.S. invasion of Iraq.[3]\n\nWith France, Germany, and other members of the UN Security Council opposing war against Iraq, the UN did not approve it, thus making the war illegal under international law.\n\nThe broader U.S. counterterrorism mission ran afoul of international humanitarian laws. Human rights groups documented a wide pattern of torture and brutal treatment at U.S. overseas detention centers, notably Abu Ghraib in Iraq, Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan, and Guantánamo in Cuba.\n\nAs part of its “war on terror,” the U.S. assassinated suspected terrorists anywhere in the world via remotely controlled armed drones. In February 2014, the European Parliament rebuked such methods, calling on member states to “oppose and ban the practice of extrajudicial targeted killings” and to “not perpetrate unlawful targeted killings or facilitate such killings by other states.”[4]\n\nThe human costs of the U.S. “war on terror” were considerable. Some 241,000 people were killed in Afghanistan and Pakistan between 2001 and 2021, including more than 71,000 civilians, and another 300,000 people were killed in Iraq, two-thirds of whom were civilian. Over 14,500 U.S. soldiers and contractors lost their lives in these war zones.[5]\n\nI. Introduction\n\nImagine if Belgium had been ruthlessly attacked by terrorists as the United States had been on September 11, 2001. Would Belgium have launched two wars against other nations? Not likely. Not being a military superpower, Belgium would have turned to the United Nations and sought assistance from other countries, building an international coalition to neutralize terrorist groups through intelligence sharing and police cooperation. This was an option for the United States as well, but the George W. Bush administration had a larger agenda beyond counterterrorism.\n\nThe U.S. “war on terror,” announced by President Bush on September 20, 2001, served some of the same functions as the Cold War against “communism” (1946-1991). It provided an overarching justification for U.S. global power projection and hegemony, bolstered U.S. military spending and the “imperial presidency,” and refurbished national myths of grandeur and “exceptionalism.”[6] The Pentagon’s National Security Strategy of 2002 stated that U.S. military forces must be “strong enough to dissuade potential adversaries from pursuing a military-build-up in hopes of surpassing, or equaling, the power of the United States.”[7] That is the definition of global hegemony.[8]\n\nMaintaining U.S. hegemony required an extensive network of military bases and installations abroad – some 800 as of 2022 – along with numerous military partnerships. According to the Costs of War Project at Brown University: “From 2018 to 2020, the United States government undertook what it labeled ‘counterterrorism’ activities in 85 countries.” In thirteen of those countries – Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq, Syria, Yemen, Somalia, Kenya, Nigeria, Mali, Libya, Cameroon, Niger, and Tunisia – U.S. personnel were engaged in some form of combat, drone strikes, special forces missions, or planning and control operations. The U.S. conducted joint military exercises in 41 countries and training operations in 79.[9] In 2021, U.S. military expenditures totaled $801 billion (not including veterans’ health care costs), constituting 38 percent of $2,113 billion in global military expenditures, far more than any other nation. The U.S. was also the world’s largest arms dealer, accounting for 39 percent of major arms deliveries worldwide between 2017 and 2021.[10]\n\nThis multi-part essay reviews and analyzes U.S. foreign policies in the two decades following the 9/11/2001 terrorist attacks on the United States. The next section (Section II) outlines five operational missions undertaken by the U.S. in the name of counterterrorism, ranging from the necessary protection of the American people to unnecessary wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.[11] While it is widely known that the Bush administration made false claims in the lead-up to the invasion of Iraq in March 2003, it is less well known that the administration rejected opportunities to negotiate a peaceful settlement in Afghanistan in the fall of 2001.\n\nSection III examines the themes and arguments used to frame and sell the “war on terror” to the American people, beginning with a review of historical antecedents. To a large degree, the Bush administration’s “war on terror” followed the playbook of the Reagan administration’s “war on terrorism” in the 1980s, but with greater effect.[12]\n\nSections IV and V examine the conduct and costs of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, respectively. Both wars devolved into long-term occupations with harsh counterinsurgency measures resulting in large numbers of civilian casualties.[13] Section VI surveys U.S. global counterterrorist operations, which included extrajudicial rendition (kidnapping), indefinite detention (holding prisoners without trial), torture, and assassination of suspected terrorists by armed drones, all of which violated international humanitarian laws, undermined cooperation with other nations, and were largely ineffective.\n\nSection VII surveys various aspects of the “homefront,” including veteran issues, government surveillance, anti-Muslim prejudice, and peace protests and politics. The last section probes what lessons may be learned from America’s misadventures and suggests alternatives to Pax Americana.\n\n* * * * *\n\nII. Five dimensions of the “war on terror”\n\nOn the morning of September 11, 2001, nineteen men – fifteen from Saudi Arabia, two from United Arab Emirates, one from Lebanon, and one from Egypt – highjacked four U.S. commercial jets and turned them into attack missiles. Using small knives, pepper spray, and physical force, the hijackers gained entry into the airplane cockpits. As four of the hijackers – Mohamed Atta, Ramzi Binalshibh, Marwan al Shehhi, and Ziad Jarrah – had previously attended flight schools in Florida, Arizona, and Minnesota, they knew how to reroute the Boeing jets to designated targets.[14] Two of the aircraft struck the World Trade Center in New York City causing the massive, 110-story Twin Towers to collapse. One smashed into the Pentagon. Another, presumably headed for the White House, crashed into an empty field near Shanksville, Pennsylvania, after passengers courageously fought the hijackers. All in all, nearly 3,000 people died and over 6,000 were injured. Americans were shocked and outraged, bewildered as to why this happened, and fearful of future attacks.[15]\n\nThe Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) quickly concluded that the perpetrators of the 9/11 attacks were members of al Qaeda, a terrorist group led by Osama bin Laden, a wealthy Saudi native residing in Afghanistan. Bin Laden had once been a de facto ally of the United States, with both helping Afghan Mujahideen guerrillas defeat a Soviet-backed government during the 1980s. He turned against the U.S. in the lead-up to the 1991 Persian Gulf War when the U.S. established military bases in Saudi Arabia. In February 1998, bin Laden issued a fatwa, or religious proclamation, denouncing the U.S. for “occupying the lands of Islam in the holiest of places, the Arabian Peninsula, plundering its riches, dictating to its rulers, terrorizing its neighbors, and turning its bases in the Peninsula into a spearhead through which to fight the neighboring Muslim peoples.” He called on all Muslims “to kill the Americans and their allies – civilian and military.”[16] Muslim religious leaders deemed the fatwa invalid as bin Laden had no standing as a religious scholar.\n\nBin Laden put his manifesto into practice by orchestrating two bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania on August 7, 1998. A total of 224 people were killed, including twelve Americans. President Bill Clinton responded by ordering Tomahawk cruise missiles fired at four paramilitary training camps in Afghanistan associated with al Qaeda, and a pharmaceutical plant in Sudan, erroneously identified as a chemical weapons plant.[17] Clinton also authorized the CIA to assassinate bin Laden, but the CIA’s Counterterrorism Center was unable to locate him for three years running. Beginning in September 1999, the CIA picked up international “chatter” indicating that a major terrorist attack on U.S. soil was being planned. The chatter increased in 2001, but neither the CIA nor the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) was able to discover the plan or identify the operatives.[18]\n\nPresident George W. Bush, during his first nine months in office, paid little heed to urgent warnings of a terrorist attack. After September 11, he presented himself as the paramount leader in a global fight against terrorism. As Bush later explained to journalist Bob Woodward in an interview, “I had to show the American people the resolve of a commander in chief that was going to do whatever it took to win. No yielding. No equivocation. No, you know, lawyering this thing to death, that we’re after ‘em. And that was not only for domestic, for the people at home to see. It was also vitally important for the rest of the world to watch.”[19]\n\nIn the weeks following 9/11, the president regularly met with his principal advisers – Vice President Dick Cheney, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, CIA director George Tenet, National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice, Secretary of State Colin Powell, Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz, Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage, Treasury Secretary Paul O’Neill, and White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card – to discuss counterterrorism strategy and public relations. Bush declared early on that the American people must be shown visible progress. He told the principals that he would keep a “scorecard” to measure and demonstrate his administration’s accomplishments. “And we’ve got to start showing results.”[20]\n\nOn September 20, Bush delivered a televised address to a joint session of Congress in which he announced a new “war on terror” and outlined multiple objectives. Though presented in seamless sequence, the objectives entailed distinct operational missions: (1) protect the American people from future terrorist attacks, (2) bring bin Laden and al Qaeda leaders to justice, (3) defeat all terrorist groups with international capabilities, and (4) counter, possibly by war, any nation that aided or harbored terrorist groups.[21]\n\nThe first order of business was to ensure the safety of the American people. “We will take defensive measures against terrorism to protect Americans,” Bush said. “Today, dozens of federal departments and agencies, as well as state and local governments, have responsibilities affecting homeland security. These efforts must be coordinated at the highest level. So tonight, I announce the creation of a Cabinet-level position reporting directly to me – the Office of Homeland Security.” The new agency would eventually coordinate twenty-two sub-agencies responsible for the detection of terrorist threats within the United States and related responses.[22] Bush also secretly authorized the National Security Agency to eavesdrop, without a warrant, on American citizens’ communications.[23]\n\nThe second important task was to bring the perpetrators of the 9/11 terrorist attacks to justice. “Who attacked our country?” asked Bush. “The evidence we have gathered all points to a collection of loosely affiliated terrorist organizations known as al Qaeda,” led by “a person named Osama bin Laden.” Bush did not offer any clues as to how the U.S. might find and capture or kill bin Laden. Instead, he immediately folded this second objective into a third, calling for a global war against terrorism.\n\n“This group and its leader,” continued Bush, “are linked to many other organizations in different countries, including the Egyptian Islamic Jihad and the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan. There are thousands of these terrorists in more than 60 countries. . . . Our war on terror begins with al Qaeda, but it does not end there. It will not end until every terrorist group of global reach has been found, stopped and defeated.”\n\nThis third dimension greatly expanded and complicated the nation’s counterterrorism mission.[24] Indeed, U.S. intelligence agencies had been unable to thwart the designs of even one terrorist organization – al Qaeda. The global scope was nonetheless appropriate insofar as the U.S. cooperated with other nations and the United Nations. On September 12, at the behest of the United States, the United Nations Security Council adopted Resolution 1368, declaring “international terrorism as a threat to international peace and security” and expressing its “readiness to take all necessary steps to … combat all forms of terrorism.”[25]\n\nBush did not address the sticky problems involved in international cooperation. National governments characteristically disagree on what kinds of violence constitute “terrorism,” which groups should be labeled “terrorist,” and which nations, if any, should be designated as “state sponsors of terrorism.”[26] As of September 2001, the U.S. State Department identified 23 groups as “foreign terrorist organizations,” five of which were Palestinian, and listed seven nations as “state sponsors of terrorism,” including Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Syria, Iraq, Libya, and Sudan.[27] Other nations undoubtedly kept different lists.\n\nBush attempted to sweep away the difficulties of international cooperation by brazenly calling on all other nations to follow the U.S. lead. “Every nation in every region now has a decision to make: Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists,” he said.[28] While virtually every government in the world sympathized with Americans in the aftermath of 9/11, the implication that any government that disagreed with the U.S. over targets or strategy was “with the terrorists” hardly facilitated global teamwork. The Bush administration intended to call the shots in the newly announced global “war on terror.” As one unnamed senior official told New York Times reporters, “The fewer people you have to rely on, the fewer permissions you have to get.”[29]\n\n“How will we fight and win this war?” Bush asked rhetorically in his September 20th speech. “We will direct every resource at our command – every means of diplomacy, every tool of intelligence, every instrument of law enforcement, every financial influence, and every necessary weapon of war – to the disruption and to the defeat of the global terror network.”\n\nAlthough Bush used the term “war” to describe the nation’s global counterterrorism mission, the primary means of rooting out terrorist cells involved intelligence gathering, police operations, financial regulations, and diplomatic cooperation. While military-like SWAT (special weapons and tactics) teams might be needed at times, mobilizing national armies against stateless individuals and clandestine cells made no sense.[30]\n\nThis reality, however, was problematic for Bush, as police and intelligence operations were unlikely to produce the impressive “results” he desired. Apart from the possible capture or killing of bin Laden, which could not be predicted, there was nothing sensational about counterterrorism – which is mainly concerned with preventing terrorist attacks. Employing military force, on the other hand, would demonstrably exact retribution for the 9/11 attacks and visibly prove the president’s resolve in the eyes of his domestic audience.\n\nThe military option meant targeting nation-states. At a meeting of the principals on September 12, Vice President Chaney explained, “To the extent we define our task broadly, including those who support terrorism, then we get to states. And it’s easier to find them than to find bin Laden.” In another meeting on September 25, Bush affirmed, “We can’t define the success or failure in terms of capturing UBL [bin Laden].”[31]\n\nDefining success in terms of capturing bin Laden would have left too much out of President Bush’s control. Who knew how long bin Laden could prevail in a game of cat and mouse? Framing the mission in terms of military action against states, on the other hand, would allow the administration to display its power at a time of its choosing and pursue its larger geopolitical goals.[32]\n\nMisnamed “counterterrorism” wars\n\nBush added this fourth dimension to his announced “war on terror” when he declared in his September 20th address that the U.S. would “pursue nations that provide aid or safe haven to terrorism. . . . From this day forward, any nation that continues to harbor or support terrorism will be regarded by the United States as a hostile regime.” The implicit military threat here transformed the phrase “war on terror” from a metaphor – in the vein of Lyndon Johnson’s “war on poverty” and Richard Nixon’s “war on drugs” – into actual war plans. Indeed, Bush’s blanket threat posed the possibility of many wars – against any nation identified by U.S. leaders as a “state sponsor of terrorism.”[33]\n\nThough none of the suicidal terrorists responsible for the 9/11 attacks were from Afghanistan, Bush made it the first state target. The Taliban government of Afghanistan had allowed bin Laden to remain in the country despite repeated entreaties from U.S. and Saudi officials over the past three years to expel him. Bush now demanded that the Taliban deliver to the U.S. “all the leaders of al Qaeda who hide in your land” and also allow the U.S. “full access to terrorist training camps, so we can make sure they are no longer operating.” The president added, ominously, “These demands are not open to negotiation or discussion. The Taliban must act, and act immediately. They will hand over the terrorists, or they will share in their fate.”[34]\n\nBush’s conflation of al Qaeda with the Taliban was the origin of much misery to come. Whereas al Qaeda represented a real threat to the security of the United States, the Taliban did not. The Taliban did not participate in the planning or implementation of the 9/11 attacks; nor did they endorse the terrorist actions afterward. Indeed, the chief spokesperson for the Taliban at the time, Foreign Minister Wakeel Ahmed Mutawakel, told the Arab television network Al Jazeera, “We denounce this terrorist attack, whoever is behind it.” The Taliban ambassador to Pakistan, Mullah Abdul Salam Zaeef, also condemned the attacks. “We want to tell the American children that Afghanistan feels your pain,” said the ambassador. “We hope the courts find justice.”[35]\n\nBin Laden had been a guest of the Taliban government since being expelled from Sudan in 1996. He had curried favor with the Taliban supreme leader, Mullah Mohammed Omar, by funding construction projects and recruiting international jihadists to fight against the Taliban’s internal enemies. There were nonetheless many Taliban leaders who wanted to get rid of bin Laden and the al Qaeda Arabs, especially after the United Nations imposed economic sanctions on Afghanistan in November 1999 due to al Qaeda’s international terrorist activities.\n\nA deal with the Taliban was not out of the question, but this could be accomplished only through dialogue, not an ultimatum. On September 18, 2001, Pakistani intelligence chief Mahmud Ahmed informed U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage that he had conveyed to Mullah Omar all U.S. demands. Omar’s response, according to Ahmed, was “not negative on all these points.”[36] Direct talks were hampered by the fact that there was no U.S. envoy in Afghanistan. In early October, Taliban ambassador Zaeef held a news conference in Quetta, Pakistan. “We are ready for negotiations,” he said. “Only the way of negotiations will solve our problems . . . We have yet to receive any detailed evidence about the persons responsible for the horrendous act of terrorism, or other links with bin Laden or al Qaeda.”[37] Such evidence was never delivered.\n\nOn October 14, a week after the U.S. air war against Afghanistan began, Afghanistan’s deputy prime minister, Haji Abdul Kabir, reiterated the point, telling reporters, “If the Taliban is given evidence that Osama bin Laden is involved” and the bombing campaign is stopped, “we would be ready to hand him over to a third country,” adding that it must be a state that would never “come under pressure from the United States.” The Bush administration refused all conditions, and the war continued. “There’s no need to discuss innocence or guilt. We know he’s guilty,” President Bush told reporters.[38]\n\nBetween 1998 and the fall of 2001, U.S. officials had met in secret with Taliban representatives at least thirty times to discuss ways in which the Taliban could bring suspected terrorist bin Laden to justice.[39] The main sticking point was that U.S. officials wanted bin Laden to face trial in the U.S., whereas the Taliban would agree only to turn bin Laden over to a neutral third country. According to the Washington Post, “Some Afghan experts argue that throughout the negotiations, the United States never recognized the Taliban need for aabroh, the Pashtu word for ‘face-saving formula.’ Officials never found a way to ease the Taliban’s fear of embarrassment if it turned over a fellow Muslim to an ‘infidel’ Western power.”\n\nMilton Bearden, the CIA station chief in Pakistan from 1986 to 1989 who had overseen the U.S. covert aid program to the Mujahideen, blamed the diplomatic failure on U.S. obtuseness and inflexibility. “We never heard what they were trying to say,” he told the Washington Post. “We had no common language. Ours was ‘give up bin Laden.’ They were saying ‘do something to help us give him up.’” Similarly, Richard Hrair Dekmejian, an expert in Islamic fundamentalism, commented, “We did not engage these people creatively. There were missed opportunities.”[40]\n\nBin Laden was akin to a corporate executive of a multinational corporation with headquarters in Afghanistan and operations across the world. Al Qaeda was not tied to Afghanistan as a home base. Indeed, following the U.S. air assaults on Afghanistan, which began October 7, 2001, bin Laden and most of his top aides slipped across the border into Pakistan, leaving Afghanistan largely free of the terrorist group. The quick military victory over the Taliban by Northern Alliance forces backed by overwhelming U.S. air power in the late fall of 2001 was greeted in the U.S. as a phenomenal success, but it was not a victory over al Qaeda, which continued to operate out of Pakistan. In early December, President Bush pulled out his scorecard and crossed off only six of the top 22 al Qaeda leaders, these being killed or captured; the rest remained at large.[41] The war did achieve at least one of the “results” Bush desired. His public approval rating skyrocketed from 51 percent to 90 percent that fall.[42]\n\nWhile forcing al Qaeda leaders to run and hide undoubtedly disturbed their operations, the larger effect of the U.S. war in Afghanistan was to deflect U.S. counterterrorism efforts. The Taliban became the replacement “terrorists” for the absent al Qaeda in this mislabeled “war on terror.” Richard C. Holbrooke, appointed U.S. special representative to Afghanistan and Pakistan in January 2009, commented, “We may be fighting the wrong enemy in the wrong country,” referring to the fact that the remnants of al Qaeda had moved to Pakistan.[43]\n\nFor some twenty years, tens of thousands of U.S. troops were sent to Afghanistan to buoy up the central government in Kabul. They fought, not against terrorists threatening the United States, but against a reconstituted Taliban insurgency; against local Afghans enraged by U.S. military assaults (air strikes, night raids, and drone attacks) that killed an estimated 71,000 civilians; and against a corrupt kleptocracy in Kabul.[44] On May 2, 2011, a Navy Seal team killed Osama bin Laden in his Pakistani hideout. Yet this action had no virtually effect on the U.S. counterinsurgency war in Afghanistan, which continued for another decade.[45]\n\nIn August 2021, the Taliban regained control of Kabul and, by prior treaty agreement, U.S. troops departed. Many Americans rued this outcome, but in truth, the war was unnecessary and avoidable to begin with. However regressive the Taliban’s social policies, the Taliban were not international terrorists and should not have been treated as such by successive U.S. administrations. Adam Nossiter, the Kabul bureau chief for the New York Times, pointed out that the ideological narrative posited in Washington concerning the Taliban was not shared in Afghanistan: “The United States thought it was helping Afghans fight an avatar of evil, the Taliban, the running mate of international terrorism. That was the American optic and the American war. But the Afghans, many of them, were not fighting that war. The Taliban are from their towns and villages.”[46] The Taliban had roots in the Pashtun ethnic majority in Afghanistan and the support of many students at Islamic madrassas (the word “Taliban” in the Pashto language means “students”).\n\nThe American optic also prevented U.S. leaders from including the Taliban in the new Afghan government formed in the fall of 2001, and from facilitating reconciliation between Taliban leaders and their rivals.

Rubin, a journalist who covered the war in Afghanistan during the early years, described the Taliban’s initial attempts at reconciliation:\n\nIt was in the waning days of November 2001 that Taliban leaders began to reach out to Hamid Karzai, who would soon become the interim president of Afghanistan: They wanted to make a deal. “The Taliban were completely defeated, they had no demands, except amnesty,” recalled Barnett Rubin, who worked with the United Nations’ political team in Afghanistan at the time. Messengers shuttled back and forth between Mr. Karzai and the headquarters of the Taliban leader, Mullah Muhammad Omar, in Kandahar. . . . But Washington, confident that the Taliban would be wiped out forever, was in no mood for a deal.[47]\n\nAt a Pentagon press briefing on November 19, 2001, Rumsfeld was asked: “Mr. Secretary, we’re getting reports that Mullah Mohammed Omar is trying to negotiate a surrender from Kandahar – surrender for himself, the Taliban, including those now being encircled by Northern Alliance forces at Kunduz. Is that true? And if so, what are the terms of the surrender the United States will accept?” Rumsfeld curtly replied, “The United States is not inclined to negotiate surrenders.”[48] This dismissive attitude carried over into the UN-sponsored conference in Bonn, Germany, where a new Afghan central government was formed in early December 2001. According to Carter Malkasian, a civilian Pentagon adviser with firsthand experience in Afghanistan, “Rumsfeld vetoed any peace with the Taliban. He also sent a private warning to Karzai that any deal would be against U.S. interests.”[49]\n\nThis uncompromising U.S. approach doomed peacemaking within Afghanistan. According to U.S. diplomat James Dobbins, “A number of Afghans with the Taliban offered to surrender and, when they did, we [the U.S.] put them in prison, in Bagram [near Kabul] and Guantánamo [Cuba], and there was never any discussion if that was a good idea.” Malkasian similarly noted, “One mistake was that we turned down the Taliban’s attempt to negotiate. We were hugely overconfident in 2001, and we thought the Taliban had gone away and weren’t going to come back. We also wanted revenge, and so we made a lot of mistakes that we shouldn’t have made.”[50]\n\nAlthough Afghan military commanders had been fighting each other over political power since the late 1970s, negotiations, compromises, switching sides, and reconciliations were part of the Afghan way of war. Once it became clear that the Taliban government would not prevail against the Americans and their allies, “it didn’t take long for Taliban leaders to flock to the proverbial bargaining table, hoping to cut deals with the new government,” according to Pakistani journalist Anand Gopal who conducted extensive interviews in Afghanistan. “It was a replay, in their minds, of their own rise to power, when they had struck accords with anyone willing to submit to their authority.” Gopal describes the efforts of Mullah Obaldullah, a senior Taliban leader, to find an accommodation with the invading Americans:\n\n“We expected that if we offered no resistance, they would accept us and we could live in peace,” said former minister of defense Mullah Obaidullah, one of the movement’s most senior figures. Obaidullah, a confidant of supreme leader Mullah Omar, attempted multiple times to engineer deals with the new authorities. In January 2002, he contacted Kandahar governor Gul Agha Sherzai with a compelling offer: in return for amnesty, he would pledge loyalty to the Karzai government, forswear political life, and submit to regular government monitoring. Joining him were six other leading Taliban officials, including the notorious one-eyed, one-legged Mullah Turabi, who as minister of justice and head of the religious police had been a zealot’s zealot, an architect of edicts outlawing everything from kite flying to music. The group now accepted the US-backed government’s legitimacy, and after Sherzai signed off on the deal, retired quietly to their home villages. . . .\n\nThe Obaidullah group, and the three top Taliban officials who went to Khas Uruzgan in January 2002 in search of a pact (only to be stymied by the standoff between the district’s competing governors) were far from the only ones looking to make arrangements. In fact, from Washington’s list of the twenty-seven most wanted Taliban, a majority attempted to engineer similar deals. . . . No sooner had the olive branch been extended, however, than it was withdrawn. When news of Sherzai’s deal with Obaidullah and his comrades surfaced, U.S. officials were furious. Responding to Washington’s pressure, Sherzai reversed his position, announcing that all Taliban would be detained and handed over to the Americans. Obaidullah and company fled to Pakistan.[51]\n\nIronically, in the view of many Afghans, the Americans themselves had switched sides. During the 1980s, the U.S. had armed and aided Mujahideen jihadists against a Soviet-backed government, whereas now the U.S. was fighting the Taliban, an offshoot of the Mujahideen. Some former Mujahideen fighters, such as Abdul Salam Zaeef, helped found the Taliban movement in September 1994.[52] Former Mujahideen commander Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, once a favorite of the U.S., asked rhetorically, “What’s the difference between the Soviet occupation and the American occupation? Is there a difference? . . . Afghans are fighting the U.S. presence in Afghanistan with the same motivation that they did the Soviets. There is not difference between the two jihads. . . . Yesterday, they called us freedom fighters. But when we do the same thing today, they call us their enemies, and they call us terrorists.”[53]\n\nThe distinction between the Taliban and al Qaeda is meticulously explored by researchers Alex Strick Van Linschoten and Felix Kuehn in An Enemy We Created: The Myth of the Taliban-Al Qaeda Merger in Afghanistan (2010). The title summarizes their conclusion that the two entities were distinct and should not have been conflated by U.S. leaders.[54] The idea of delinking the Taliban and al Qaeda belatedly struck Newsweek political commentator Fareed Zakara after seven years of fighting in Afghanistan. In the February 9, 2009 issue of Newsweek, he wrote, “The most important departure from current thinking would be to make a distinction between Al Qaeda and the Taliban. . . . Now, it is certainly true that some elements of the Taliban might be closely wedded to Al Qaeda. But others are not. Even the most hard-line Taliban – the so-called Quetta Shura led by Mullah Omar – have at various points made overtures to the Afghan government, always asking that they be distinguished from Al Qaeda.”[55]\n\nThe fifth dimension\n\nThe fifth dimension of the “war on terror” entailed turning this elastic phrase into a justification for military action against virtually any state; that is, states that had nothing to do with 9/11 or al Qaeda. Top Bush administration officials conceived of the “war on terror” as an overarching framework for justifying the pursuit of U.S. global interests and power goals generally, much like the Cold War anti-communist framework. “The Global War on Terror,” writes the historian Andrew Bacevich, “now became the organizing principle for American statecraft, serving a function comparable to the Cold War during the second half of the prior century.”[56] From this perspective, marking the Taliban government as a military target in the incipient “war on terror” was not a strategic blunder or mistake at all but rather a calculated attempt to establish the legitimacy of military responses to 9/11, which then could be applied to other nation-states.\n\nIraq was the next target, indeed the primary target for a number of officials. Bringing down Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein had been the goal of a group of influential neoconservatives, or neo-cons, since the end of the Persian Gulf War in 1991. Led by William Kristol, Robert Kagan, Donald Rumsfeld, Paul Wolfowitz, Dick Cheney, Richard Perle, and others, the group formed the Project for an American Century in 1997 and successfully lobbied Congress to pass the Iraq Liberation Act of 1998. The act stated, “It should be the policy of the United States to support efforts to remove the regime headed by Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq and to promote the emergence of a democratic government to replace that regime.”[57] With the election of George W. Bush as president, the neo-cons were placed in key policymaking positions. Following the 9/11 attacks on the United States, they saw their opportunity.\n\nRumsfeld and Wolfowitz wasted no time in pushing the U.S. toward a regime-changing invasion of Iraq. On the very day of the 9/11 attacks, Rumsfeld raised the question at a National Security Council meeting as to whether Iraq should be a priority on the U.S. hit list. “Not now” came the reply from other principals, but maybe later. President Bush was on board. On September 12, he told a White House group that included Richard A. Clarke, chief counterterrorism adviser on the National Security Council, “See if Saddam did this. See if he’s linked in any way.” The following day, Clarke heard Rumsfeld and Wolfowitz talking about “getting Iraq.” Clarke turned to Powell, “I thought I was missing something here. Having been attacked by al Qaeda, for us now to go bombing Iraq in response would be like our invading Mexico after the Japanese attacked us at Pearl Harbor.”[58]\n\nOn September 14, Wolfowitz went public. “It’s not just simply a matter of capturing people and holding them accountable,” the deputy secretary of defense told the press, “but removing the sanctuaries, removing the support systems, ending states who sponsor terrorism.” Wolfowitz said that the U.S. would wage “a campaign, not a single action” against terrorist groups and the governments that support them.[59] In a meeting of the principals the following day, he suggested that it would be easier to win a war against Iraq than against Afghanistan, given the latter’s reputation as “the graveyard of empires.” Rumsfeld, for his part, complained that Afghanistan lacked adequate military targets and asked again whether it was time to attack Iraq. At another meeting on September 25, Rumsfeld queried, “Look, as part of the war on terrorism, should we be getting something going in another area, other than Afghanistan, so that success or failure and progress isn’t measured just by Afghanistan?”[60]\n\nAfter the war in Afghanistan began in October, Rumsfeld requested that General Tommy Franks, head of U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM), prepare plans for invading Iraq. Franks presented his war plans to Rumsfeld on December 4, about the same time that the Taliban fell from power. “Taking down the Taliban regime, and taking down Afghanistan,” reflected Ali Soufan, former FBI Special Agent, “was just a step for some people in Washington to go to another war, and it’s in Iraq . . . [a] country that had nothing to do with 9/11.”[61]\n\nAlong with military invasion plans, the Bush administration initiated a propaganda campaign aimed at convincing Americans and the world that Saddam Hussein had to be ousted. Lacking evidence of Iraqi involvement in 9/11 or any connection to al Qaeda, President Bush focused his State of the Union Address on January 29, 2002, on demonizing Saddam Hussein as another Adolf Hitler. He described Iraq as part of an “axis of evil,” consisting of Iraq, Iran, and North Korea, that was “seeking weapons of mass destruction.” If obtained, these states “could provide these arms to terrorists, giving them the means to match their hatred. They could attack our allies or attempt to blackmail the United States. In any of these cases, the price of indifference would be catastrophic.”[62]\n\nThe phrase “axis of evil” was designed to rekindle memories of World War II, the “good war,” in which the U.S. fought the Axis powers of Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy, and Imperial Japan; and by analogy, to make the idea of war against Iraq seem reasonable. In fact, there was no alliance between Iraq, Iran, and North Korea; indeed, Iraq and Iran fought a war in the 1980s that cost the lives of some one million people.[63] (Bush’s justifications are further analyzed in Section III.)\n\nTo be sure, nuclear proliferation was and is a danger to the world community, but Bush proffered a skewed view of the problem by ascribing the danger only to governments deemed unfriendly to the U.S., and not to America’s friends. Israel, for example, acquired its nuclear arsenal without protest from the United States. In a 2002 report titled “Weapons of Mass Destruction in the Middle East,” Anthony Cordesman of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, noted that the following nations in the Middle East and South Asia possessed weapons of mass destruction: Egypt (chemical), India (chemical, biological, nuclear), Iran (chemical, biological), Israel (chemical, biological, nuclear), Libya (chemical), Pakistan (chemical, biological, nuclear), and Syria (chemical, biological).[64] The U.S. itself possessed large caches of all three types of weapons of mass destruction and an ample supply of missiles to deliver them; and U.S. leaders never renounced the first use of such weapons.\n\nIn addition to targeting U.S. geopolitical adversaries, Bush assumed it was up to the U.S. rather than the UN to prevent “rogue states” from acquiring weapons of mass destruction (WMD), and that offensive military force was an appropriate means of prevention.[65] U.S. unilateral aggression against perceived threats abroad became official policy in the National Security Strategy for the United States of September 2002. This policy, which became known as the Bush Doctrine, justified “preventative” wars in order to deter possible future attacks on the United States, a prescription that had no basis in international law.[66] According to international relations scholar Patrick Hayden, the Bush Doctrine reserved for the U.S. alone, as the world’s only military superpower, “the right to strike preemptively at any perceived threat with or without UN endorsement and irrespective of international legal prohibitions.”[67]\n\nIn the lead-up to the U.S. invasion of Iraq in March 2003, Bush administration officials cherrypicked intelligence and included rumors discounted by the CIA, to the effect that Iraq was developing nuclear and chemical weapons and that such weapons could be transferred to terrorist organizations.[68] “The problem here,” said Condoleezza Rice in an interview on September 12, 2002, “is that there will always be some uncertainty about how quickly he [Saddam Hussein] can acquire nuclear weapons. But we don’t want the smoking gun to be a mushroom cloud.”[69] The image of a mushroom cloud caught the public’s attention. “We know they have weapons of mass destruction,” Rumsfeld insisted on September 26. “There isn’t any debate about it.”[70]\n\nAmong the principals pushing for war, Secretary of State Colin Powell was considered the most reticent – at least until he made the case for war at a UN Security Council on February 5, 2003. “Iraq cannot prove that it has disarmed,” he averred.[71] Like other U.S. officials, Powell used a clever ruse to convict Iraq in the eyes of the world, demanding that Iraq prove it had no WMD, rather than relying on U.S. or UN inspection teams to prove that Iraq had such weapons. This “guilty unless proven innocent” scheme was exactly opposite the legal procedure in U.S. courts which assume innocence unless proven guilty. As it was, invading U.S. troops found no hidden caches of WMD, making a mockery of the pre-war hype against Iraq.\n\nHans Blix, the Swedish diplomat who served as the UN’s chief weapons inspector from 2000 to 2003, described the Bush administration as having “the same mind frame as the witch hunters of the past,” looking for evidence to support a foregone conclusion of guilt. Speaking with CNN correspondent Christiane Amanpour one year after the invasion, he said that the primary difficulty his team faced was the “problem of proving the negative. For example, how can you prove that there is not a tennis ball in this room? Or that there is no anthrax in all of Iraq?” He added, “There were about 700 inspections and in no case did we find weapons of mass destruction.” In the end, said Blix, America’s pre-emptive war “bred more terrorism there and elsewhere.”[72]\n\nHad Hans Blix and his UN inspection team been allowed to complete their search for WMD in Iraq, this would have established the legitimacy and viability of UN arms control agencies and furthered world security through world law. Instead, the U.S. took pre-emptive military action, engaging in an unnecessary war, undermining international law and setting a dangerous precedent for other powerful nations.\n\nThe U.S. war against Iraq was heralded as part of the “war on terror,” but in reality, it had nothing to do with curbing terrorism. As in Afghanistan, tens of thousands of U.S. troops were sent to fight, not against international terrorists, but against Iraqis resisting foreign domination. Though many Iraqis were happy to see Saddam Hussein toppled, the massive destruction wrought by the U.S. invasion followed by an inept and abusive U.S. occupation destabilized the country and fostered insurgencies and sectarian violence as well as the arrival of new terrorist groups.\n\nClarke, appointed by President Bill Clinton in May 1998 as the first National Coordinator for Security, Infrastructure Protection, and Counterterrorism, resigned in March 2003, charging that the Iraq War was a diversion from the nation’s counterterrorism efforts. In his book, Against All Enemies: Inside America’s War on Terror (2004), he wrote, “In Muslim countries, the U.S. invasion of Iraq increased support for al Qaeda and radical anti-Americanism. Elsewhere, we were now seen as a super-bully more than a superpower, not just for what we did but for the way we did it, disdaining international mechanisms that we would later need.” Clarke took issue with Bush’s claim during the 2004 election campaign that the U.S. was “fighting the terrorists in Iraq so that we don’t have to fight them in the streets of America.” In his view, Bush “never points out that our being in Iraq does nothing to prevent terrorists from coming to America, but does divert funds from addressing our domestic vulnerabilities and does make terrorist recruitment easier.”[73]\n\nOther knowledgeable people also recognized Bush’s war against Iraq to be counterproductive in the global struggle against terrorism. French foreign policy adviser Bruno Tertrais stated in 2004, “The campaign [in Iraq] conducted by the United States has strengthened the Islamists’ sense of being totally at war against the rest of the world.” Judge Jean-Louis Bruguiére, the first vice president of the Tribunal de Grande Instance de Paris, concluded: “The war in Iraq did not reduce the terrorist threat, and in fact, has increased the risk of attacks in the United States and Europe by increasing the level of Islamist and anti-American rhetoric, by diverting the attention of political leaders from the central issue of the war on terrorism, and by encouraging the view among the public that the war on terrorism is nearly won.”[74]\n\nAlthough a majority of U.S. citizens voiced support for the war when it began, many people in the U.S. and across the world were not taken in by the Bush administration’s pre-war propaganda.[75] Antiwar protests increased in number and size over the course of 2002. They peaked on Feb. 15, 2003, when somewhere between six and eleven million people demonstrated in 650 cities around the world to protest the threatened U.S. invasion of Iraq.[76] Three million marched in Rome, the largest single antiwar demonstration in history; another 1.5 million in Madrid, one million in Great Britain, and close to half a million in New York City.[77] Phyllis Bennis, one of the organizers in the U.S., commented on how these worldwide demonstrations affected the outcome of a war resolution pushed by the U.S. and Britain in the UN Security Council:\n\nIt was an amazing moment – powerful enough that governments around the world, including the soon-famous “Uncommitted Six” in the Security Council, did the unthinkable: they too resisted pressure from the United States and the United Kingdom and said no to endorsing Bush’s war. Under ordinary circumstances, alone, U.S.-dependent and relatively weak countries like Angola, Cameroon, Chile, Guinea, Mexico and Pakistan could never have stood up to Washington. But these were not ordinary circumstances. The combination of diplomatic support from “Old Europe,” Germany and France who for their own reasons opposed the war, and popular pressure from thousands, millions, filling the streets of their capitals, allowed the Six to stand firm.[78]\n\nU.S. and British representatives, recognizing that they did not have the votes to pass their war resolution, refrained from submitting it. President Bush nonetheless announced that the U.S. would proceed with the invasion, joined by a “coalition of the willing.” He asserted that Saddam Hussein was in breach of Security Council Resolution 1441 passed on November 8, 2002, and of previous resolutions calling on him to give up WMD, even though UN inspectors were still conducting investigations. France responded that these previous resolutions were insufficient grounds for war.[79] This claim was reinforced by the International Commission of Jurists in Geneva which declared on March 18:\n\nA war waged without a clear mandate by the Security Council would constitute a flagrant violation of the prohibition of the use of force. Security Council Resolution 1441 does not authorise the use of force. Upon its adoption, France, Russia and China, three permanent members of the Security Council, issued a declaration indicating that the Resolution excludes such authority. The bottom line is that nine members of the Security Council, including the five permanent members, need to actively approve the use of force – such support is blatantly lacking.[80]\n\nThe U.S. war against Iraq, as such, was illegal under international law. It was not undertaken for self-defense and not approved by the UN Security Council, the only two legal bases for war. Asked in September 2004 whether the invasion of Iraq was illegal, UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan told BBC News, “Yes, if you wish. I have indicated it was not in conformity with the UN charter from our point of view; from the charter point of view, it was illegal.”[81]\n\nThe invasion of Iraq ultimately undermined America’s standing in the world. According to the Pew Research Center (June 3, 2003):\n\nThe war has widened the rift between Americans and Western Europeans, further inflamed the Muslim world, softened support for the war on terrorism, and significantly weakened global public support for the pillars of the post-World War II era – the U.N. and the North Atlantic alliance. . . . In addition, majorities in five of seven NATO countries surveyed support a more independent relationship with the U.S. on diplomatic and security affairs. Fully three-quarters in France (76%), and solid majorities in Turkey (62%), Spain (62%), Italy (61%) and Germany (57%) believe Western Europe should take a more independent approach than it has in the past.[82]\n\nSo much for following the U.S. lead. When President Bush visited stalwart ally Prime Minister Tony Blair in London in November 2003, he was met by 110,000 protesters at Trafalgar Square. When he visited Ireland in June 2004, 10,000 people turned out for a “Stop Bush” rally in Dublin, while others marched in Shannon, Galway, and other Irish cities.[83]\n\nCongressional authorizations and “forever wars”\n\nThe transformation of U.S. counterterrorism operations into regime-changing military interventions and wars was underpinned by Congressional legislation. Although not intended as an abdication of its Constitutional powers, Congress passed two authorizations that allowed successive administrations to engage in wars in Afghanistan and Iraq as well as conduct combat operations and airstrikes in at least ten other nations – Libya, Pakistan, Somalia, Syria, Yemen, Kenya, Mali, Nigeria, Niger, and Tunisia.[84]\n\nCongress was quick to act after the 9/11 attacks. On September 14, 2001, both chambers passed an Authorization for the Use of Military Force (AUMF) that permitted the president to “use all necessary and appropriate force” against “those nations, organizations, or persons he determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001.” The act furthermore empowered the president to take action against any nation that harbored terrorist organizations (as defined by the U.S.) “in order to prevent any future acts of international terrorism against the United States.”[85] The vote was 420 to 1 in the House and 98 to 0 in the Senate. The 2001 AUMF did not define terrorism nor mention any specific enemy. Hence, presidents were free to fill in the blanks.[86] National security expert Karen J. Greenberg writes:\n\nRiddled with imprecision, its terminology was geared to codify expansive powers. The president could ‘use all necessary and appropriate force’ with no limits specified and could do so against a nameless set of enemies. . . . The battlefield, like the enemy, was nameless. . . . Nor was there a mention of what could signal the end of conflict. In sum, it was to be a war with neither temporal nor geographical boundaries, and lacking definitional limits when it came to the enemy.[87]\n\nThe one dissenting House member, Barbara Lee, Democrat of California, explained her vote in a later interview. “Growing up with stories and being in a military family,” she said, “I understand that we don’t want to send our young men and women into harm’s way if we can avoid that.” Her father was a veteran of World War II and Korea. She was concerned that Congress was rushing to approve a war without a clear strategy or endgame. She confirmed her decision to vote against the measure after attending a memorial service at the Washington National Cathedral for the victims of 9/11, where President Bush vowed to “rid the world of evil.” Reverend Nathan Baxter, in prayer, called upon the nation’s leaders to “consider the necessary actions for national security” but not allow the U.S. to “become the evil we deplore.”[88] In later years, many members of Congress, including future president Senator Joe Biden, regretted their vote for war.\n\nAt the behest of the Bush administration, Congress signed off on a second AUMF on October 16, 2002, in anticipation of the war against Iraq. This act authorized the president to use the U.S. Armed Forces “as he determines to be necessary appropriate in order to – (1) defend the national security of the United States against the continuing threat posed by Iraq; and (2) enforce all relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions regarding Iraq.”[89] Notwithstanding the use of the word “defend,” the Bush administration used this AUMF to take offensive military action against Iraq based on the unproven assumption that Iraq had acquired WMD. Both acts remained in force through 2021, providing the legal basis for engaging in a broad range of military activities in other lands.\n\nRonald Spiers, former U.S. ambassador to Pakistan, wrote in March 2004 that President Bush’s “‘war on terrorism’ is a war without an end in sight, without an exit strategy, with enemies specified not by their aims but by their tactics. . . . The President has found this ‘war’ useful as an all-purpose justification for almost anything he wants or doesn’t want to do; fuzziness serves the administration politically.”[90]\n\nOn October 30, 2017, two weeks after four U.S. service members were killed in Niger in a counterterrorism mission, a Congressional Hearing was held in which Senator Benjamin Cardin of Maryland appealed for a new approach:\n\nIt seems we have U.S. troops deployed almost everywhere in the world. In addition to significant deployments in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Syria, and major deployments in South Korea, Japan, and Europe, U.S. forces are and have been engaged in counterterrorism operations in Yemen, Somalia, Ethiopia, Libya, and Chad, with extensive advice, train, and capacity-building efforts in many more. . . .\n\nThe United States has relied for too long on military force as the first response to the problems of terrorism, insurgency, and instability abroad. In this [Donald Trump] administration, one wonders – one wonders whether it has become the first and only response. It has proposed a dramatic increase in the defense budget, while the foreign affairs’ budget has been slashed by 30 percent. Very soon, practically the only tools left in the U.S. foreign toolbox will be the massive hammer applied everywhere for lack of better options. We need to both authorize and to set limits on the use of that hammer. In so doing, perhaps the administration will rediscover the necessity and the value of diplomacy, development, and support for human rights as the means to build a safer world for everyone, especially the United States.[91]\n\nIn February 2019, Rep. Barbara Lee introduced legislation to repeal the 2001 AUMF. “The authorization to use military force has been used over 41 times in about 19 countries not related at all to 9/11,” she said. “It’s also been used for domestic spying in the United States. It’s been used in Somalia, Yemen, you name it. It’s been used all over the world as the basis to use force, and to bomb and engage in military operations.”[92] The House passed Rep. Lee’s bill by a vote of 268-161, but the Senate failed to pass a corresponding measure and thus the AUMF lived on.[93]\n\nIn the final analysis, the “war on terror” was a vacuous phrase. Literally, it meant that war would be waged against a violent tactic, without identifying who the enemy might be. This lack of inherent content proved eminently useful to U.S. officials, as it allowed them to fill in the blanks and define the “enemy,” directing American anger over 9/11 at their chosen targets.\n\n* * * * *\n\nIII. Framing and selling the “war on terror”\n\nThis section examines the themes and arguments used to frame and sell the so-called “war on terror” to the American people, noting contradictions between rhetoric and practice. It begins with a review of historical antecedents.\n\nHistorical antecedents\n\nThe gap between words and deeds in the history of U.S. foreign policy is wide. Nearly a century before the George W. Bush administration’s “war on terror,” President Theodore Roosevelt issued the Roosevelt Corollary to the Monroe Doctrine which asserted the right and responsibility of the U.S. to militarily intervene in nations of the Western Hemisphere in order to prevent “chronic wrongdoing.” As Roosevelt stated in December 1904, “Chronic wrongdoing, or an impotence which results in a general loosening of the ties of civilized society, may in America, as elsewhere, ultimately require intervention by some civilized nation, and in the Western Hemisphere the adherence of the United States to the Monroe Doctrine may force the United States, however reluctantly, in flagrant cases of such wrongdoing or impotence, to the exercise of an international police power.”[94]\n\nRoosevelt’s claim was a ruse, as there was no international law or institution to support this self-assigned hemispheric policeman role. Nor did the concept of “chronic wrongdoing” have any legal legitimacy. It was a pliable, amorphous rationale that allowed U.S. leaders to use it as they saw fit – which they did. Over the next thirty years, the U.S. conducted numerous military interventions in Central American and Caribbean nations, generally to secure U.S. economic interests and client governments. The Roosevelt Corollary paralleled the equally misleading “civilizing missions” of Great Britain and France in Asia and Africa.\n\nPresident Woodrow Wilson offered a variation of the “civilizing mission” in his war message to Congress on April 2, 1917. The United States, he said, would fight for “the rights of all mankind” and to make the world “safe for democracy.” Such high-minded idealism was needed to convince Americans to enter the slaughterhouse of the Great War (First World War). Promoting human rights and democracy, however, were hardly the war goals of the U.S. and its allies. Indeed, in the aftermath of the war, the British and French expanded their empires in the Middle East and the U.S. continued to lord over the Philippines and impose authoritarian military rule in Haiti and the Dominican Republic.[95]\n\nThe rhetorical mission to spread democracy gained credence in the Second World War, given the dictatorial nature of America’s enemies, but it was not why the U.S. entered the war. Nor was this a goal of America’s allies. The Soviet Union was thoroughly authoritarian, while Great Britain was intent on keeping its African and Asian colonies in tow. The idea nonetheless corresponded with America’s internal democratic institutions and presented to American citizens a moral rationale for becoming a world power in the aftermath of the war – even if the U.S. did not actually promote democracy.\n\nU.S. foreign policies during the Cold War were riven with contradictions and hypocrisy. While rhetorically committed to freedom and democracy, the U.S. aided a host of repressive and dictatorial governments, including at various times, authoritarian regimes in Greece, South Korea, French-controlled Vietnam (1950-54), South Vietnam (1954-75), Indonesia, Iran, Zaire, Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, Guatemala, El Salvador, Brazil, Chile, Pakistan, and the Philippines. The U.S. also covertly aided the overthrow of democratic governments, notably in Iran (1953), Guatemala (1954), and Chile (1973), each of which was replaced by a murderous rightist regime backed by the United States. The truth about U.S. policies was obscured by references to U.S.-supported governments as the “free world,” and by patriotic idealism and missionary zeal, exemplified by President John F. Kennedy’s promise “to pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe to assure the survival and the success of liberty.”[96]\n\nThe term “terrorist” was occasionally used during the Cold War, mainly to bolster the “bad guy” image of communists. President Harry Truman employed it in his Truman Doctrine speech of March 1947, when he declared that the Greek state was “threatened by the terrorist activities of several thousand armed men, led by communists.” This was a half-truth at best, as the Greek royalist government was violently repressive and had outlawed the Greek communist party – which formerly held seats in the national legislature. According to one U.S. official, “That the Greek government was corrupt, reactionary, inefficient, and indulged in extremist practices was well known and incontestable.”[97] Truman nonetheless depicted the Greek civil war as a mythic battle between democracy and totalitarianism, establishing the dominant U.S. ideological framing of the Cold War.[98]\n\nThe Kennedy and Johnson administrations similarly employed the “terrorist” label to depreciate communist-led North Vietnam and its southern allies. As communications professor Carol Winkler notes, “All violent acts of the Viet Cong, the NLF [National Liberation Front], or the North Vietnamese were [labeled] terrorism. All actions by the United States and its allies were [labeled] counterterrorism.”[99] The CIA’s Orwellian-named “Counter Terror” program initiated in 1965 was described by one CIA analyst as an attempt to use “techniques of terror – assassination, abuses, kidnappings and intimidation – against the Viet Cong leadership.” The operation was renamed the Phoenix program in 1968 and expanded into a systematic assassination campaign responsible for the deaths of some 20,000 people.[100]\n\nU.S. Cold War policy was officially designated as “containment,” indicating a defensive mission, but the U.S. also undertook offensive actions aimed at undermining states deemed friendly to the Soviet Union. Afghanistan was one such state. In the summer of 1979, President Jimmy Carter signed off on a CIA program to secretly aid the Mujahideen guerrillas who were attempting to oust a communist-led government. The jihadist rebellion prompted Soviet military intervention in December 1979, which in turn led to a major war. Beyond aiding the Mujahideen, the U.S. collaborated with Saudi Arabia and Pakistan to recruit, arm, train, and finance Islamic jihadists from around the world.[101]\n\nAmong those who flocked to Afghanistan was Osama bin Laden. Working alongside Saudi, Pakistani, and U.S. agents, bin Laden raised funds from wealthy Saudis, directed construction projects, recruited Arab jihadists, and established military training camps. In 1988, he initiated al Qaeda (meaning “the base”), a jihadist terrorist group with global ambitions. When the communist-led government of Mohammad Najibullah fell in April 1992, Washington policymakers viewed their handiwork with satisfaction, oblivious to the blowback yet to come from fostering jihadist militancy.[102]\n\nThe Reagan administration’s “war on terrorism”\n\nInternational terrorism has long been a problem for all nations. The year 1975 was labeled by Newsweek magazine the “Year of Terror” after a wave of assassinations, hijackings, hostage takings, letter bombings, and armed raids around the world. No one at the time suggested that the U.S. or any other nation undertake wars or military invasions to subdue terrorism, as it was understood that preventing terrorism and apprehending terrorists were essentially police and intelligence functions. The U.S. response to terrorism during the 1970s generally involved beefing up security and surveillance, especially at U.S. embassies, establishing better communication and coordination among agencies, and adopting new regulations designed to prevent theft of nuclear materials and sabotage of nuclear power plants.[103] These were reasonable policies.\n\nThe Reagan administration played up the “terrorist threat” alongside the “communist threat” in order to justify more muscular foreign policies.\n\nDuring the 1980s, the Reagan administration sought to change the way Americans viewed terrorism, from focusing on clandestine groups to demonizing alleged state sponsors of terrorism. Administration officials played up the “terrorist threat” alongside the “communist threat” in order to justify more muscular foreign policies.[104] Ideologically, the goal was to reinforce the “evil” nature of America’s geopolitical foes while establishing the U.S. as the “good guy,” the global crusader for justice, reinforcing self-righteous nationalist myths.\n\nOn January 28, 1981, Secretary of State Alexander Haig announced at his first news conference that “international terrorism will take the place of human rights” as the administration’s priority concern. Terrorism, he averred, “is the ultimate in abuse of human rights.” Haig identified the Soviet Union as a state sponsor of terrorism, accusing it of “training, funding and equipping” terrorists.[105]\n\nHaig’s statement was cause for concern among some terrorism experts. “Combatting terrorism is a police problem,” said Walter Laqueur of Georgetown University. “Haig made a sweeping statement. He seemed to make terrorism synonymous with all forms of political violence. One should be a bit more careful.”[106] In fact, Haig was clear in his intentions. His purpose was to apply the “terrorist” label to U.S. geopolitical adversaries while identifying the U.S. as the champion of counterterrorism. Critics at the time were berating the administration for supporting state terrorism in El Salvador, where U.S.-trained military units and their allied “death squads” were committing scores of murders and atrocities.[107] Haig and company wanted to shift the spotlight to America’s foes.\n\nIn subsequent years, administration officials undertook concerted efforts to establish a “terrorist threat” narrative. There were four major discursive threads:\n\n(1) hyping the “terrorist threat,” in part by describing terrorist attacks as “acts of war against the American people,” thereby making U.S. military action seem reasonable in response;\n\n(2) identifying U.S. geopolitical rivals as sponsors of terrorism, a so-called “network of terrorist states” that included the Soviet Union, Cuba, Nicaragua, Iran, and Libya;\n\n(3) establishing “self-defense” legal arguments to justify the use of force against alleged state sponsors of terrorism; and\n\n(4) demonizing terrorists and their alleged sponsors as “evil” while scripting the U.S. as a righteous nation duty-bound to save the world from terrorism (in addition to communism).\n\nPresident Ronald Reagan, known as the Great Communicator, sounded the alarm bell in a letter to Congress on April 26, 1984, asserting that international terrorism posed a “growing threat to our way of life . . . a frightening challenge to the tranquility and political stability of our friends and allies . . . [and] a severe challenge to America’s foreign policy.” He linked these alleged threats to rival nations, stating that “the training and support of terrorist groups and activities by a number of countries has reached alarming proportions.” The U.S., as such, must “assure that the states now practicing or supporting terrorism do not prosper in the designs they pursue.”[108]\n\nAdministration officials extensively promoted these themes in what amounted to a propaganda blitz. Reagan claimed that “the deadly menace of international terror” posed a “pervasive and insidious threat to all free peoples” (October 19, 1984); that a “confederation of criminal governments” is “now engaged in acts of war against the government and people of the United States” (July 8, 1985); that “Government-sponsored terrorism, in particular, cannot continue without gravely threatening the social fabric of all free societies” (April 23, 1986); and that terrorism constitutes “a unique threat to free peoples” as well as “an attack upon the world,” and the U.S. “would not tolerate what amounts to acts of war against the American people” (May 7, 1986).[109]\n\nSecretary of State George Shultz, the man in charge of diplomacy, similarly ratcheted up fear of terrorism in a speech on October 25, 1984. He described terrorism as a threat, not just to U.S. “national security” and “our way of life,” but also to “Western moral values” and “modern civilization.” Terrorism, he said, “is not just criminal activity but an unbridled form of warfare,” and it “is being used by our adversaries as a modern tool of warfare.” As such, he argued, a forceful response was needed, a “war on terrorism.” “We should be alarmed,” said Shultz. “The magnitude of the threat posed by terrorism is so great that we cannot afford to confront it with half-hearted and poorly organized measures.”[110]\n\nA far less sensational assessment of the dangers of international terrorism was presented in an unheralded official report titled “Public Report of the Vice President’s Task Force on Combatting Terrorism,” published in February 1986. The report noted that in 1985, “23 Americans overseas lost their lives [due] to terrorists,” while “two citizens were killed within our own borders.”[111] Though disturbing, these numbers hardly merited the inflated warnings by administration officials, especially when compared that year to the number of homicides (18,980), motor vehicle deaths (43,825), drug overdose deaths (3,612), and lightning strike fatalities (74).[112]\n\nAll in all, during President Ronald Reagan’s eight years in office (1981-1989), there were 518 U.S. fatalities attributable to international terrorism, 248 military and 270 civilian. Most of the deaths occurred in two incidents: the bombing of Marine barracks in Lebanon in October 1983, which killed 241 U.S. military personnel, and the bombing of Pam Am Flight 103 over Scotland in December 1988, which killed 190 U.S. citizens. The first incident was war related, as the Marines entered a volatile area occupied by Lebanese, Israeli, Palestine Liberation, and Syrian-backed forces. The bombing of the Pam Am flight also had military overtones, as Libyan leader Muammar Qadhafi appears to have directed this act of terrorism in response to the U.S. bombing of Libya in April 1986 – which killed at least 37 people and injured 93, including two of Qadhafi’s sons (casualty reports vary). Other U.S. civilian deaths, including 26 embassy personnel, totaled 80 between 1981 and 1989, or about ten per year.[113] Murders in the U.S. during this same eight-year period totaled 162,000, or over 20,000 per year.[114]\n\nAmericans were less than enthusiastic about the administration’s anti-terror campaign in large part because the actual threat did not measure up to the administration’s hype. International endorsement of the Reagan administration’s so-called “war on terrorism” was also lacking. According to international relations scholar Richard Jackson, U.S. rhetoric differed “markedly from other states like the United Kingdom and Spain, where a war-based language of counter-terrorism was entirely absent.”[115]\n\nTo be clear, the Reagan administration’s innovations with respect to counterterrorism were in inflated rhetoric rather than policy. In terms of counterterrorism operations, apart from the bombing of Libya, the administration continued much the same as previous administrations, working to prevent terrorist attacks and struggling to identify and apprehend suspects when they occurred. The rhetorical framework advanced by the Reagan administration did not take deep root at the time, but it laid the basis for President George W. Bush’s post-9/11/2001 “war on terror” campaign, which did gain wide public acceptance.\n\nLegal and moral justifications under Reagan\n\nIn arguing that international terrorism amounted to “war” against the United States, Reagan administration officials established the basis for justifying U.S. military actions abroad as “self-defense.” In July 1985, President Reagan stated that, “under international law, any state which is the victim of acts of war has the right to defend itself.”[116]\n\nWhile international law makes allowances for national self-defense, it does not confer an absolute right. Article 51 of the United Nations Charter makes it clear that self-defense is conditional: “Nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations, until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security.” The intent of this article is to allow all nations to defend themselves against immediate attacks while reserving ultimate decision-making authority to the UN Security Council. National leaders are not empowered to self-define “self-defense.”\n\nOther sections of the UN Charter (Article 2, sections 3 and 4) require nations to exhaust all diplomatic options before resorting to war and to obtain UN approval prior to military actions. Article 39 assigns to the UN Security Council sole authority to “determine the existence of any threat to the peace, breach of the peace, or act of aggression,” and to “make recommendations, or decide what measures shall be taken. . . . to maintain or restore international peace and security.”[117]\n\nSecretary Shultz nonetheless argued in a speech in February 1988 that the U.S. not only had the right to “defend” itself against international terrorism, but also that such defense includes offensive action. “The terrorists are waging war against us,” he said. “And we have every right under international law to defend ourselves. Part of that defense is to take the offense.” Shultz offered as an example the “American bombing raid on Libya” on April 15, 1986, which “opened a new chapter in the international fight against terrorism.” He added, “European allies, initially a little reluctant, very quickly followed with political, diplomatic, and economic measures against Libya.”[118] The U.S. strike was mainly in response to a bomb explosion in a West German discotheque ten days earlier that killed three people, including two Americans, and wounded 154 more, including 50 to 60 Americans. U.S. officials said that the bombing was part of a “pattern of indiscriminate violence” against Americans by Libya.[119]\n\nContrary to Shultz’s claim, responses of the world community to the U.S. retaliatory strike against Libya were overwhelmingly negative. According to international law scholar Gregory Francis Intoccia: “Positive American reaction to the raid was not shared by other Western nations. Most American allies in Western Europe criticized the attack.” Greece and Italy denounced the U.S. air strike as setting “dynamite to peace” and “provoking explosive reactions of fanaticism,” respectively. France viewed the bombing as a reprisal “that itself revives the chain of violence.” Belgium regretted the American “recourse to a military action.” West Germany warned that “a violent solution will not be successful and is not very promising.” Foreign ministers of the Movement of Non-Aligned Nations condemned the U.S. raid at their meeting in New Delhi, India. The UN General Assembly adopted a resolution condemning the U.S. attack on Libya by a vote of 79 to 28, with 33 abstentions.[120] Notwithstanding this global censure of U.S. retaliatory violence, Reagan administration officials continue to claim that the U.S. was acting on behalf of the world community in “defending” against international terrorism.\n\nMore than this, the Reagan administration framed its “war on terrorism” as a crusade against “evil.” President Reagan, in his various speeches, referred to “the evil scourge of terrorism” (October 17, 1985); declared that the world must “stamp out this ugly, vicious evil of terrorism” (June 30, 1985); and opined that “terrorism is the preferred weapon of weak and evil men” (April 15, 1986). Having also described the Soviet Union as an “evil empire” and the “focus of evil in the modern world” in a speech to the National Association of Evangelicals on March 8, 1983, it was a simple matter to link terrorism to the Soviet Union by virtue of their allegedly “evil” characters.[121] The attribution of “evil,” as such, was not merely rhetorical excess but served a useful, if malign, geopolitical purpose.\n\nThe corollary to this labeling of U.S. adversaries as “evil” was the presumption that the United States is “good,” its foreign policies benevolent and protective. Arriving at this superlative generalization required that much U.S. history be whitewashed, including the nation’s engagement in offensive wars and terrorism, disregard for international law, and profound contradictions between stated principles and actual policies.[122]\n\nU.S. terrorism in Nicaragua\n\nThe contradictions in the 1980s were most notable in the Reagan administration’s rhetoric and policies toward Nicaragua. In seeking to undermine and overthrow the leftist Sandinista government – which came to power in a popularly supported revolution in July 1979 – the U.S. organized a counterrevolutionary group, known as the Contras, which attacked villages, laid road mines, and murdered government employees, including teachers and health workers.[123] The discovery of a CIA-produced “assassination manual” in October 1984 confirmed the administration’s culpability as a state sponsor of terrorism.[124] The 134-page manual, written in Spanish, encouraged the “selective use of violence” against Nicaraguan officials, judges, security officers, and others. “If possible, professional criminals should be hired to carry out specific selective ‘jobs,’” the manual advised. Other pages explained how to assassinate victims with a rope, wire, belt, pistol, rifle, shotgun, machine gun, or explosives.[125]\n\nUpon hearing about the manual, Senator Claiborne Pell, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, commented, “The administration has launched an aggressive anti-terrorism campaign, and yet we seem to be engaged in the very same terrorist activities which we deplore elsewhere.”[126] Rep. Samuel Gejdenson, chair of the House Subcommittee on Western Hemisphere Affairs, remarked, “It’s clear we have a situation where the Contra targets are primarily and almost exclusively civilians.”[127]\n\nGejdenson’s subcommittee held a three-day hearing in mid-April 1985. Among those testifying was former CIA director Admiral Stansfield Turner who acknowledged, “Rightly or wrongly, there are many of us today who see the actions of the Contras as being beneath the ethical standards we would like the United States to employ. And specifically, I believe it is irrefutable that a number of the Contras’ actions have to be characterized as terrorism, as State-supported terrorism.”[128]\n\nThe Reagan administration responded to the revelation of its misdeeds by ratcheting up its rhetorical attacks on the Sandinistas.[129] “If the Sandinistas are allowed to consolidate their hold on Nicaragua,” Reagan warned on March 5, 1986, “we’ll have a permanent staging ground for terrorism.”[130] The following month, he accused the Sandinistas of “training, supporting, and directing, as well as sheltering terrorists” and drug dealers. He added that “the march of freedom, especially in Central America, and the fight against terrorism, are directly related.”[131] Contrary to the president’s claims, however, Newsweek noted that “Reagan’s own State Department contradicted the president’s assertion that Brazilian radicals are being trained in Nicaragua”; also that the U.S. “Drug Enforcement Administration can’t substantiate his charge that the Sandinistas have been involved in international narcotics trafficking.”[132] A 1988 report by the Senate Subcommittee on Terrorism, Narcotics and International Operations identified the Contras, not the Sandinistas, as being involved in international drug trafficking.[133]\n\nIn addition to supporting the Contras, the CIA directly engaged in acts of terrorism by employing covert agents to mine Nicaraguan harbors and blow up oil storage tanks in April 1984. In response, the Sandinista government brought suit against the U.S. in the International Court of Justice, or World Court. On June 27, 1986, the court ruled that “by training, arming, equipping, financing and supplying the Contra forces or otherwise encouraging, supporting and aiding military and paramilitary activities in and against Nicaragua,” the U.S. was “in breach of its obligation under customary international law not to intervene in the affairs of another State.” The ruling obliged the U.S. to cease its support for the Contras and make reparation payments to Nicaragua “for all injury caused.”[134] The Reagan administration ignored the ruling. Adding insult to injury, Reagan appointed Duane R. Clarridge, the CIA division chief who organized the main Contra group, as director of the CIA’s Counterterrorism Center in 1986.[135]\n\nAll in all, the first “war on terrorism” was a huge scam, designed by the Reagan administration to provide cover for its aggressive foreign policies by branding designated enemies as “terrorists,” making the specious claim of “self-defense,” and denying its own state-supported terrorism.\n\nAl Qaeda terrorism\n\nThe bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania by al Qaeda operatives in August 1998 signified a real terrorist threat to the United States. Al Qaeda was feared not only for its barbaric surprise attacks but also for its apparent ability to recruit Muslim radicals, or jihadists (holy warriors), although the vast majority of Muslims (about 24 percent of the world population) have rejected terrorist violence. President Bill Clinton discounted al Qaeda’s stated reasons for the attacks – the existence of U.S. military bases on the Saudi Arabian peninsula and the so-called U.S. “colonization” of the Middle East – and explained the group’s motivation as a morbid hatred for America and its values: “America is and will remain a target of terrorists precisely because we are leaders,” said Clinton, “because we act to advance peace, democracy and basic human values; because we’re the most open society on Earth; and because, as we have shown yet again, we take an uncompromising stand against terrorism.” The next president, George W. Bush, would similarly ignore political considerations and explain the motives of al Qaeda in moralistic terms: they “hate our freedoms – our freedom of religion, our freedom of speech, our freedom to vote and assemble. . . .”[136]\n\nThe leader of al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, did not begin his life as a terrorist. He was born in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, in 1957, the 17th of 52 (half) brothers and sisters. His father, Mohammed bin Awad bin Laden, a native of Yemen, accrued substantial wealth in the construction business and became close to the Saudi royal family. Osama graduated from King Abdul-Aziz University in Jeddah with a degree in public administration in 1981. He used his inherited wealth and knowledge of construction to establish a prominent role for himself in support of the Mujahideen revolt in Afghanistan during the 1980s, working in tandem with Pakistani and U.S. (CIA) agents.\n\nOsama’s mother, Alia Ghanem (Hamida al-Attas), was born in Syria and married Osama’s father at the age of fourteen. She was his fourth wife and they divorced soon after Osama’s birth. Osama helped raise her other children from a later marriage to Mohammed al-Attas. Journalist Martin Chulov interviewed Ghanem in 2018. She described her firstborn son, Osama, as shy, smart, and pious. “He was a very good child until he met some people who pretty much brainwashed him in his early 20s,” said Ghanem. “You can call it a cult. They got money for their cause. I would always tell him to stay away from them, and he would never admit to me what he was doing, because he loved me so much.”[137] None of Osama’s brothers and sisters endorsed terrorism, and most were decidedly pro-Western in their dress and attitudes.\n\nThe practice of terrorism, in any case, is not fundamentally rooted in religion of any kind. The most lethal terrorist act in the U.S. during the 1990s was committed by a home-grown antigovernment militant. Timothy McVeigh, an ex-Army soldier who had fought in the Persian Gulf War and been awarded the Bronze Star, came to the conclusion that the U.S. government was the enemy of the people, or at least the white nationalists and antigovernment extremists whom he admired. On April 19, 1995, he parked a rented Ryder truck in front of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in downtown Oklahoma City. Inside the vehicle was a powerful bomb made out of agricultural fertilizer, diesel fuel, and other chemicals. The bomb’s massive explosion demolished one-third of the building, killing 168 people, including 19 children, and wounding several hundred more. McVeigh showed no remorse. He told his biographers that he wanted to get caught in order to give a platform to his antigovernment message.[138]\n\nThe George W. Bush administration’s “war on terror”\n\nThe manufactured themes of the Reagan administration’s “war on terrorism” rose to the fore again in the George W. Bush administration’s post-9/11/2001 “war on terror.” There was one huge difference. The 9/11 attacks immediately convinced Americans of the real danger of international terrorism, and thus the vast majority were eager to support the administration’s counterterrorism program. The president needed only to define the threat and direct the response. According to Bruce Hoffman, Senior Fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, “the phrase ‘war on terror,’ was an enormously compelling summons to battle, but it was enormously misleading.” U.S. policies, he argued, should have focused “on the group, the individuals that had caused the 9/11 attacks and were continuing to threaten us. Once it became a war on terror, it became anything that scared us.”[139]\n\nThe amorphous quality of the “war on terror,” announced on September 20, 2001, served the Bush administration’s larger purposes. The phrase was meant to be flexible and applicable to a variety of adversaries and approaches. The administration’s rhetorical framework was similar to that of the Reagan administration but with some adaptations. Bush administration officials:\n\n(1) hyped the threat of international terrorism as an “act of war” against the United States – notwithstanding the fact that the 9/11 attacks were carried out by nineteen stateless terrorists, all originating from friendly countries – thus making U.S. military actions seem reasonable in response;\n\n(2) expansively defined the “terrorist threat” to include adversarial nation-states, including Afghanistan, Iraq, Iran, and, North Korea, thereby identifying potential targets for U.S. military actions;\n\n(3) advanced legalistic “self-defense” arguments to justify both the use of force against other nations and extreme counterterrorist measures such extraordinary rendition (kidnapping), indefinite imprisonment, torture of detainees, and assassination of suspected terrorists; and\n\n(4) employed a dualistic moral framework in which terrorists and their alleged state sponsors were demonized as “evil,” while the U.S. was charged with a mission to save the world from terrorism, a jihad of its own.\n\nAt a commemoration service held at the National Cathedral in Washington on September 14, 2001, President Bush called the nation to arms, declaring, “War has been waged against us by stealth and deceit and murder.” As such, “our responsibility to history is already clear: to answer these attacks and rid the world of evil.”[140]\n\nRichard Jackson writes that Bush administration officials “employed a hyperbolic language of threat that directly echoed Reagan’s earlier formulations.”\n\nAccording to the administration, terrorism posed not just a threat of sudden violent death to individual citizens, but a “threat to civilization,” a “threat to the very essence of what you do,” a “threat to our way of life,” and a threat to “the peace of the world.” The cold war notion of a “threat to our way of life” vastly inflates the purported danger: instead of a tiny group of dissidents with resources that do not even begin to rival that of the smallest states, it implies that today’s terrorists are as powerful as the Soviet empire was once thought to be with all of its military resources.[141]\n\nThe connection between terrorist groups and nation-states was initially made through the presence of bin Laden and al Qaeda leaders in Afghanistan. Though the Taliban had no part in the 9/11 attacks or in al Qaeda’s international operations, the Bush administration equated the two and proceeded to overthrow the Taliban government using massive air power in combination with local alliances (see Section IV). The next target, Iraq, required more sleight-of-hand to justify U.S. military intervention, as no connections could be found between Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein and al Qaeda or 9/11. The president nonetheless charged in his State of the Union Address on January 29, 2002, “Iraq continues to flaunt its hostility toward America and to support terror,” although he did not specifically link Iraq to al Qaeda.[142]\n\nCrusading against evil\n\nThe administration’s most potent rhetorical strategy was to frame terrorists and alleged terrorists such as Saddam Hussein as “evil doers.” Bush used the terms “evil” or “evil doers” nine times at a press conference on the White House lawn on September 16, 2001.[143] He repeated these terms six times in a speech on October 11, and three more times in a speech on November 10.[144] He told Newsweek in November that Saddam Hussein was “evil.”[145] Such rhetoric had strategic implications. If Saddam Hussein was an “evil” leader, then peace negotiations were futile and he must be removed by force. Indeed, administration propaganda was designed to remake Saddam Hussein into a new Adolf Hitler in the minds of Americans, thus justifying a U.S. war to oust him.\n\nPresident Bush, in his State of the Union Address on January 29, 2002, identified Iraq as part of a fictional “axis of evil,” a reference to the Axis powers of World War II. The point here was to brand Iraq as a formidable enemy by analogy and to establish the idea that a war to remove him was necessary and proper. The phrase was conjured up by White House speechwriter David Frum with input from National Security Advisors Condoleezza Rice and Stephen Hadley. Senior advisor Karl Rove considered it a signature phrase that would indicate “a great mission” for the United States.[146]\n\nAccording to the Mideast scholars Daniel Heradstveit and G. Matthew Bohham, “The use of the phrase Axis of Evil was a restructuring of the American understanding of the ‘War on Terror,’ in which the focus shifted from Usama [Osama] bin Ladin and al Qa’ida [Qaeda], with their allies and bases in Afghanistan, to a series of other states, whose involvement in that operation ranged from minimal to non-existent.” The phrase assumes a “dualistic picture of the world,” with the U.S. considered “a Force for Good, even the Force for Good. This means that anything it chooses to do is Good and anything that offends or inconveniences it is Evil.”[147]\n\nThis is a recipe for holy wars, a concept that has a long history in the West quite apart from Islamic jihadism. The First Christian Crusade in 1095 was launched by Pope Urban II with the words, “Enter upon the road to the Holy Sepulcher; wrest that land from the wicked race, and subject it to yourselves. God has conferred upon you above all nations great glory in arms. . . . Accordingly undertake this journey for the remission of your sins, with the assurance of the imperishable glory of the kingdom of heaven.” Under this ideological framework, the Crusaders could take the land of Jerusalem, kill Muslim inhabitants (identified as “the wicked race”), and regard themselves as morally superior for doing so.[148]\n\nA few weeks after President Bush’s State of the Union address, New York Times correspondent Robert Worth reflected on the connections between the incipient “war on terror” and the Cold War. In an article titled “Truth, Right and the American Way; A Nation Defines Itself by Its Evil Enemies,” he noted that during President Bush’s recent tour of Asia “some world leaders worried publicly that the war on terrorism was starting to look suspiciously like the last great American campaign – against Communism.”\n\nIt is hard to miss the cold war echoes. Once again America’s allies are being told that the world is divided starkly into zones of good and evil, darkness and light, and that “the United States and only the United States can see this effort through to victory,” as Vice President Dick Cheney told a gathering at the Council on Foreign Relations two weeks ago.\n\nAmerica’s discovery of an enemy who is not merely an enemy, but “evil,” has impeccable historical credentials. In a long history of responding to real and perceived threats, it seems clear that this large, heterogeneous country defines itself in part through its nemeses. . . . And to the extent that those enemies are seen as evil, America can regard itself as good, a desire rooted in the Puritan vision of establishing a new Eden in a fallen world. . . .\n\nThe country’s religious roots and its continuing high level of religious faith make Americans more likely to see enemies not just as opponents but as evil. Linked to that is the belief that America is the world’s last best hope of liberty, so that those who oppose America become the enemies of freedom.[149]\n\nThe framing of Hussein as “evil” established the basis for fearful forecasts that if the Iraqi leader were left to his own devices, he would acquire weapons of mass destruction and either attack the United States or pass them on to terrorists. This framing was extremely potent. In the public mind, it diminished the need for actual evidence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, as the very idea that Saddam Hussein could acquire such weapons and would use them was enough for many Americans to support a U.S. invasion.\n\nIn April 2003, one month after the U.S. invasion of Iraq began, Vice President Dick Cheney explained that “no rational person can doubt that terrorists would use such weapons of mass murder the moment they are able to do so.” Such a prediction was based on the belief – or propaganda – that Saddam Hussein was evil incarnate and would willingly use WMD against the West, if not directly, then by his alleged association with terrorists. As such, the Iraqi leader had to be removed from office, if not executed (the U.S. did both). “If we are to protect the American people and defend civilization against determined enemies,” said Cheney, “we cannot always rely on the old Cold War remedies of containment and deterrence. Containment does not work against a rogue state that possesses weapons of mass destruction and chooses to secretly deliver them to its terrorist allies.”[150] In short, only offensive military action could accomplish the task of removing the alleged threat.\n\nOn May 1, 2003, President Bush stood on the flight deck of the aircraft carrier, USS Abraham Lincoln, 30 miles off the coast of San Diego, with a large banner inscribed with “mission accomplished” behind him. He declared that major U.S. combat operations in Iraq were over. “The liberation of Iraq is a crucial advance in the campaign against terror. We’ve removed an ally of al Qaeda, and cut off a source of terrorist funding.” As is common in U.S. foreign policy, the president mixed security rationales (stopping terrorism) with idealistic ones (promoting freedom and democracy). “In this battle,” he continued, “we have fought for the cause of liberty . . . the tyrant has fallen, and Iraq is free.”[151]\n\nBush failed to mention that international law does not permit aggression against other nations for purposes of removing a tyrannical government or bringing democracy, if indeed that can be done by military interventions. Nor did Bush mention the fact that, following Hussein’s removal, Iraqis were subjected to the dictates of U.S. rule via the Coalition Provisional Authority, and that thousands of Iraqis were imprisoned as suspected insurgents.\n\nAs the U.S. invasion turned into an occupation, President Bush attempted to shore up the “liberation” rationale during a brief trip to the Philippines in mid-October 2003, suggesting the Filipino experience under American rule (1899-1946) as a model for Iraq. “America is proud of its part in the great story of the Filipino people,” he said. “Together our soldiers liberated the Philippines from colonial rule.” Bush’s grasp of history was woefully lacking here. The real story was that the U.S. replaced the Spanish as colonial overlord of the Philippines at the turn of the 20th century. U.S. forces helped Filipino rebels defeat the Spanish in August 1898, then turned on the very same rebels when they resisted U.S. control. Rather than liberating the Philippines, the U.S. fought a brutal and racist four-year war to suppress Filipino independence, resulting in the death of some 200,000 Filipinos and 4,200 U.S. soldiers. The Philippines remained a U.S. colony until 1946.[152]\n\nThe following month, Bush expanded the “liberation” theme from Iraq to the entire Middle East. “As long as the Middle East remains a place where freedom does not flourish,” said Bush on November 7, 2003, “it will remain a place of stagnation, resentment and violence ready for export.” One editor of Arabic daily newspaper commented that, yes, “Arabs want democracy. They hate their corrupt regimes . . . But they are not going to listen attentively to the speech of the American president, first because consecutive American administrations over the past fifty years supported those"
