        "text": "Too many people seem to formulate their beliefs based upon other people's emotional outburts and bumper stickers rather than rational thought and objective examination of facts. Apparently that is the case all over the country. Even so-called conservatives know the power of emotional appeal and sentimental rhetoric, which is why, for example, the federal takeover of school standards was given the name of \"No Child Left Behind.\" What heartless beast of a Congressman would vote to leave children behind? But you see, the Constitution does not authorize federal involvement in education issues. The only way to keep people from mentioning that little technicality is to give that federal involvement an irresistibly warm and fuzzy name.\n\nOther warm and fuzzy names that have been successfully applied in the past include \"The Fairness Doctrine\", \"The Great Society\" and \"Social Security.\" So-called conservatives use the same technique, which is one reason almost nobody in the Congress voted against the Patriot Act, even though they hadn't read it. Many other words in the liberal vocabulary have their connotations — some more sinister than others.\n\nUsually it is the more liberal-leaning voters who operate this way. That's why political candidates are chosen (subconsciously or not) on the basis of hair styles or general cuteness. But even without the influence of television, people seem to be easily swayed by sound bites and one-liners.\n\nLiberal (or \"progressive\") politicians and their allies in the news media would like us all to believe that we live in an endless series of crises that only the government can resolve. Every day there's another emergency, another shocking update, or another politically incorrect outburst that must be addressed with more legislation.\n\nAnd no matter what evil deed you've done, liberals will forgive you. All you have to do is apologize, cry on television, and go into rehab.\n\nHere's a helpful tip for you liberal crybabies: After fifty years of the same old chant, maybe it's time for something more convincing than, \"Hey Hey Ho Ho [fill in the blank] has got to go.\n\nUN chief warns 'the ocean is overflowing' as Pacific sea-level rise surpasses global average. The United Nations chief has warned of the peril faced by islands in the Pacific Ocean, as sea levels have risen almost twice the global average in the past 30 years. Making a speech from the island nation of Tonga, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres issued a 'Save our Seas' plea for the world to increase support for countries endangered by the climate crisis. \"The ocean is overflowing,\" Guterres said. \"This is a crazy situation: Rising seas are a crisis entirely of humanity's making. \"A crisis that will soon swell to an almost unimaginable scale, with no lifeboat to take us back to safety.\" The Pacific Islands are being hit harder than most, suffering a triple blow of ocean heating, sea level rise and acidification. The effects are harming ecosystems, damaging crops, contaminating fresh water sources, and destroying livelihoods.\n\nThe Editor says...\n\nThe rash pronouncements by the UN Secretary General were met with zero skepticism by the writer at itv.com, who passed along all the claims as if they were based on sound observations and established facts, which they are not. For example, \"Rising seas are a crisis entirely of humanity's making.\" How does he know that? How much have sea levels risen, to get him so alarmed? Some number of millimeters? What does he know about acidification? How much additional acid would it take to make a measurable change in the pH of the entire Pacific ocean? Can he prove such a thing has happened? Why does the U.N. still exist?\n\nIs America Reaching a Suicidal Level of Complacency? [Scroll down] Most Democrat voters are those who vote their feelings. The non-voters and the \"feelings\" voters comprise the complacent gullible segment of Americans. The MSM propaganda machinery is determined to sell the socialist narrative to the gullible. It does so by playing to their feelings. Socialism is described as \"neighborliness.\" Government seizure and redistribution is simply \"spreading the wealth around.\" The government picking commercial winners and losers is \"saving the planet.\" The propagandists hope the gullible find blind acceptance of the narrative less troublesome than observation and analysis. The narrative asks us to sacrifice our freedom because\n\n• Carbon dioxide is killing us — even though it's essential for life\n\n• Speech is violence — but actual violence requires context\n\n• Killing the unborn is a fundamental right — but defending ourselves is not, and\n\n• All races are equal — but some are incapable of achievement without government intervention.\n\nThe narrative is designed to make the gullible \"feel good\" about sacrificing their rights for centralized control.\n\nHere we go again with that hopey-changey scam. Kamala Harris is trotting out Version 2.0 of Hope and Change. Of course she can't call it that, since Obama owns that empty phrase and, besides, promising \"change\" sounds funny from someone whose distance away from the presidency the last four years was just a heartbeat, and a very feeble one at that. And even she is smart enough not to make a dramatic multicolored poster of herself like the one Obama traded on, pictured above. That's sui generis. (Art, not so much.) So... she ginned up something similar to \"Hope and Change.\" It's \"Joy.\" We're told her campaign is full of \"joy.\" [...] The reason for Kamala's joy is that she looks forward to a future \"unburdened by the past.\" In other words, don't judge her by her words and actions in the past, including the past four years. Instead, judge her by the words and actions you imagine her speaking and doing in the future. Anyone who dredges up her words and deeds of the past is not unburdened by the past and is a real killjoy.\n\nHalf of America Are Cult Members. The great Rush Limbaugh used to call them \"low-information voters,\" the tens of millions of Americans who believe the mainstream media and who aren't engaged politically. For them, if they do think about politics, it's at the level of a meme, the conventional wisdom that \"Republicans are greedy and Democrats care.\" On Election Day their decision is based not on the Truth but on how much they drank in the disinformation of the Establishment. Today, matters are much worse. Today, we are not politically divided based on our attitude to simple concepts, such as whether or not government should \"do more,\" or whether the liberties of the individual should come first. Today, one of the nation's parties has utter disdain for the Constitution and is supported by voters who act more like cultists than autonomous adults. The Democrat Convention in Chicago is Exhibit A.\n\nRobert Kennedy Jr. Slams Hypocritical Democrats: 'The DNC in Chicago Is Claiming to Defend Voting Rights While Spending Millions to Keep Me Off the Ballot'. Presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has accused his own party of blatant hypocrisy regarding voting rights. He asserts that while the Democratic National Committee (DNC) publicly champions the cause of voter access, they are simultaneously engaged in efforts to suppress the opponent's candidacy, including him. Kennedy Jr., who is facing significant resistance from party insiders, claims that the DNC and various state-level organizations are employing underhanded tactics to undermine his campaign. His vice-presidential pick, Nicole Shanahan, echoed these sentiments, highlighting the alarming trend of legal battles initiated by Democrats against political opponents. \"Trump has had 6 court battles to fight during this election, while we have 9 and counting across the country. By bringing these suits against political opponents, the Democrats bankrupt the underpinnings of democracy,\" Shanahan said.\n\nWho's to decide what's needed? We often use the word \"need\" a little more than we probably should. [...] The truth is that our needs are much more basic than that. We need clothing, food, shelter, etc. And that worries me because Michelle Obama thinks that taking more than we absolutely need is a problem. To be accurate, she said, \"suspicious of people who took more than they need.\" I find this fascinating because, well, the Obamas own three homes. The least amount they paid for a home was $1.65 million, and that was in 2005. I'm always amazed at how people who spend their lives working in the public sector and for non-profits can amass so much wealth, but apparently, that's just what they need. Let's understand that most of us are living with far more than we absolutely need to survive. We also have a lot of things that simply provide comfort, such as smartphones, televisions, computers, and so on. [...] Who decides what one needs? To what level are we ascribing the term \"need\" anyway? Does anyone need $750,000 for an hour-long speech?\n\nDemocrat Platform Says America Was Built on Stolen Land. The DNC 2016 party platform began by claiming that \"Democrats meet in Philadelphia with the same basic belief that animated the Continental Congress when they gathered here 240 years ago.\" Four years later, out went the Continental Congress and all of America. The 2020 DNC platform began with a politically fashionable 'land acknowledgement' asserting that America was an illegitimate entity operating on stolen land \"built on Indigenous homelands.\" The 2024 platform likewise begins with a 'land acknowledgement' claiming that Chicago properly belongs to 13 different Indian tribes. Once again, the DNC asserts that they \"recognize that our country was built on Indigenous homelands.\" That is to say America should not exist. If the Democrats truly believe it, why not turn over Chicago to the Indian tribes?\n\nThe Editor says...\n\nIf the Democrats are right about America (and they aren't), then what was the last country that was NOT \"built on stolen land?\"\n\nDenial and Delusion: The DNC at the United Center. Opening night in Chicago saw a cavalcade of minor county and state officials, from county executives to lieutenant governors, clearly chosen to represent the rainbow — black and white, young and old, male and female — all bounding up to the microphone to deliver their brief pep talks and talking points, each one more jubilant than the last. One minute, they were giving credit to the Biden-Harris regime for rebuilding roads and bridges, when those roads and bridges were the states' responsibilities, which states had been neglecting for years. The next minute, they were patting themselves on the back for handling power outages, without admitting that it was Democrat policies that caused those power grid failures in the first place.\n\nBig Media conducted polls to determine which climate terms induced the most hysteria. As it turns out, all that hysterical language, tsk-tsk finger-wagging at we commoners to abandon our modern luxuries like personal vehicles and gas stoves, and temperature map graphics with exaggerated red shading to suggest that we're in an emergency situation didn't do anything but turn the people off of to the whole \"urgency\" of the narrative. [...] Now to backtrack a little bit: According to Williams, in April 2019, a \"team of advertising consultants\" published another study that suggested the climate terms commonly used at the time (\"climate change\" and \"global warming\") didn't do enough to whip the average media consumer into a panic — they suggested buzzwords like \"climate crisis\" and \"environmental collapse\" as it elicited a stronger \"emotional\" response. Yes, you read that correctly: They didn't want to encourage a more rational response, or be more objective, but play to a person's emotions... and exploit them. Without facts on your side, what else do you have?\n\nNo, GB News Isn't \"Far Right\". One of the most peculiar aspects of the culture wars is that while the word 'fascist' is deployed more than ever, very few people seem to know what it actually means. To take just one example, the journalist Paul Mason wrote a book called How to Stop Fascism in which he redefined the term so broadly that he was able to incorporate anyone who deviated from his own political worldview. Convenient, isn't it? This explains, although it does not excuse, Mason's recent histrionic thread on \"fascism\" in the U.K., which culminated in the demand for more state censorship and the suppression of the press. That all fascist regimes in history have enacted such measures is an irony that appears to escape him.\n\nHere is the non-sequitur of the month:\n\nKamala Harris Scolded Americans for Celebrating Christmas While Illegal Aliens Were Denied Amnesty. Video from December 2017 surfaced Thursday of then Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) berating Americans for celebrating Christmas while illegal aliens were being denied amnesty. Harris is now the presumptive Democratic Party presidential nominee and her record is facing fresh scrutiny. In the video first reported by Fox News, Harris is seen wagging her finger and scolding Americans, \"And when we all sing happy tunes, and sing Merry Christmas, and wish each other Merry Christmas, these children are not going to have a Merry Christmas. How dare we speak Merry Christmas. How dare we? They will not have a Merry Christmas.\" [Tweet with video clip]\n\nDon't Misunderestimate Her. Those who are looking forward to a Trump victory in the coming (s)election might not want to get too cocky just yet. The sudden departure under-duress of obviously declining Joe Biden does not make it more likely that Trump will win. Arguably, it makes it less likely. People who aren't Leftists have a weakness. It is their assumption that Leftists — there are no Democrats anymore — base their opinions and actions on evidence, logic and principles. They do not. They base them on feelings — and their only \"principle\" is that power (to impose their feelings) must be pursued by any means necessary.\n\nDeep State Carnival Barkers Distract Us with Kamala. A manufactured cycle of psychological highs and lows keeps Americans' attention directed toward anything that is glamorous and away from everything that matters. Consider the roller coaster we've all been riding at higher and higher rates of speed and evermore-dangerous heights these last few months: One New York judge abuses a civil fraud statute to steal hundreds of millions of dollars from Donald Trump. Another ignores settled law and relevant facts to help convict him of thirty-four fake felonies. Democrats break out in euphoria. Then, the U.S. Supreme Court steps in to recognize presidential immunity in a way that threatens three other criminal cases against bogeyman Trump. Democrats scream obscenities in protest and demand the Court's \"cancellation.\"\n\nTrump Return Could See Climate Progress 'Unraveled,' Sally Jewell Says. Sally Jewell, who served as US Interior secretary from 2013 to 2017, said the climate stakes of the election in November \"could not be higher\" and that she's \"really afraid for the future of our planet\" should former President Donald Trump return to the White House. \"To go backwards is not acceptable,\" Jewell told attendees at the Bloomberg Green Festival in Seattle on Thursday. \"I can't say enough about the importance of continuing the progress that has been made over the last three years\" on climate change, she added, especially the passage of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Inflation Reduction Act.\n\nThe Editor says...\n\nNothing has been done by the Biden administration that will ever have any measurable impact on the world-wide climate. There has been no \"progress\" in any direction. Neither Donald Trump nor any other individual is a threat to the \"the future of our planet.\" The environmentalists do their best to stir up baseless fear. That's all they've got. They want you to be afraid of environmental catastrophe, so they can ride to the rescue and stop it. In reality, there will be no catastrophe, and nothing they can do would ever alter the weather. They hope you don't know that.\n\nThat Was Quick: Biden Is Getting Nasty Again. For one bright, shining moment Joe Biden made the case for toning down the rhetoric, turning down the political temperature, and unifying the country. Of course, he didn't mean it, but at least you would have thought that he would recognize that getting nasty two days after an assassin shot Donald Trump, leaving one dead spectator and others grievously wounded. But no, this is Joe Biden. He is, at base, a nasty person who cannot NOT tell a lie and smear his opponents. It is his nature, and the only thing holding him back now is his mental incapacity. [Tweet with video clip] Biden's position is that the problem with heated rhetoric is entirely on Republicans, and nothing he has ever said or done has been anything but loving and unifying. All that talk of existential threat to democracy? About MAGA extremists? About this being the last election if Trump wins? All totally normal, says Joe Biden. It's Trump who is the nasty one. [Tweet with video clip]\n\nNEA Mussolini Demands 'All the Things' in Unhinged Speech. At the annual assembly of the National Education Association (NEA) in Philadelphia last weekend, President Becky Pringle addressed representatives of the three-million-member labor union with a bombastic speech that sparked social media comparisons to Italian fascist dictator Benito Mussolini. In her heavily political speech, Pringle raised such progressive issues as LGBTQ rights, unrestricted abortion, equity and inclusion. She shouted about the union having \"worked hard to rid ourselves of a tyrannical, deceitful, and corrupt [Trump] White House,\" about resisting any \"scheme\" such as school vouchers to \"drain resources from our beloved public schools,\" about fighting nonexistent \"book banning\" in Florida, and about \"transforming\" the American educational system \"into something it was never designed to be — a racially and socially just and equitable system that prepares every student, EVERY student, EVERY STUDENT, EVERY ONE!\"\n\nThe Press and Pundits Make Wild Claims in the Wake of the Court's Immunity Decision. On MSNBC, Rachel Maddow warned that the Supreme Court had just unleashed death squads to roam our streets. CNN legal analyst Norm Eisen announced that murder was now legal (at least for presidents), while others predicted that the ruling on presidential immunity would invite \"tyranny.\" Anyone reading the coverage would conclude that James Madison has been replaced by John Wick in a new \"Baba Yaga\" Republic. President Biden fueled the sense of panic in an address that repeated widespread false claims about the decision in Trump v. United States. Biden told the country that \"for all practical purposes, today's decision almost certainly means that there are virtually no limits on what a president can do.\" That, of course, is not true. I have long opposed sweeping presidential privileges and powers. I have long argued that a sitting president can be criminally charged in office. But the portrayal of this Supreme Court opinion by the left and the media is wildly off base.\n\nAbout that 'insurrection'.... Democrats and their media toadies like to characterize \"MAGA\" types as crazed, gun-owning and gun-toting neanderthals of the \"far right.\" They frequently state or imply that these folks own every type of firearm imaginable, from pistols to shotguns to rifles to AR-15s. They say guns should be banned because otherwise these gun-crazed fanatics carry them everywhere... and that would lead to bloodshed and death. They don't just think the MAGA people shoot hundreds of rounds a day out back of their trailer parks, farms, or cabins in the boonies; they think they carry them into the shower, restaurants, bars, weddings, funerals, bar mitzvahs... everywhere! The Democrat-Media Complex would have you believe that Trump urged these gun-toting extremists to overthrow the government — and directed them to \"attack\" the Capitol Building. And, of course, they say, these mind-numbed Trump-loving automatons did as they were told. Yet when all these MAGA folks strolled through the People's House in an attempt to seize power and reinstall Trump, not a one of them carried a firearm. Is it possible that every one of these thousands of \"violent\" protesters and insurrectionists forgot their weapons? Every one?\n\nStark Raving Mad. You might think the Democrats would be able to keep it together, given that they control the presidency, the Senate, the federal bureaucracy, and the press, and are only a few seats away from controlling the House. But, for whatever reason, they have gone mad. Democrats have reached a fever pitch of hysteria that I doubt we have seen before in our history. One example among many is their mental breakdown over the Supreme Court's presidential immunity decision, Trump v. United States. As I wrote here, that decision was moderate, middle of the road, and entirely predictable. While it addressed a novel issue, it is consistent with past Supreme Court decisions. But to hear the Democrats tell it, the Court has unleashed anarchy and turned the president into a dictator.\n\nSupreme Court's Trump immunity ruling is what the body was designed for — unpopular but constitutionally correct. Within minutes of the Supreme Court's decision on presidential immunity, liberal politicians and pundits seemed to move from hyperbole to hyperventilation. When not breathing into paper bags, critics predicted, again, the end of the republic. CNN's Van Jones declared that it was \"almost a license to thug, in a way.\" [...] Jones warned the justices that \"politically it's bad\" for them to rule this way. The comment captures the misguided analysis of many media outlets. The Supreme Court was designed to be unpopular; to take stands that are politically unpopular but constitutionally correct. Indeed, the Democrats have become the very threat that the court was meant to resist. Recently, senators demanded that Chief Justice John Roberts appear to answer to them for his own decisions. (Roberts wisely declined.)\n\nThe Editor says...\n\nThis is the first time I've seen thug used as a verb. Using a noun as a verb doesn't make it a verb.\n\nGullibility 101. We watch Washington D.C. like we'd watch a ship steaming way too fast toward a crowd on the pier. Our nation's capital is so filled with corruption, ladder-climbing, and plain stupidity that it's embarrassing to watch. This is America?!? Yet the Democrats we know personally are not guilty of those sins. Many are smart, hard-working, kind, educated people and yet they voted for the wasted shell in the oval office — a man who is not only suffering from dementia, but has never been very bright, or very good. A lot of these lovely people appear to be planning to vote for him again. How can that be? How can even a third of our compatriots think Biden is okay? I believe it to be one of the most startling paradoxes of our time. These proud, sophisticated, overeducated folks are, unlike the power brokers of the party, simply naive. They're hopelessly gullible. How they can possibly be both — naïve and sophisticated — is beyond me.\n\nAOC goes bonkers at Bronx Bowman rally, breaking out into black English. Is Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez going off the deep end? Sure seems like it, given her manic campaign appearance before a New York City crowd on behalf of beleaguered pro-Hamas congressman Jamaal Bowman, who's running for reelection, following a string of disgraceful incidents in Congress, such as being caught pulling a fire alarm in an apparent bid to disrupt Congressional proceedings. [Two tweets with video clips] Her mania can be seen here, too: [Advertisement] [Tweet with video clip] [Advertisement] She not only got out of control, bouncing up and down and waving her arms, she fell into speaking black English, complete with 'yalls' and other words and phrases that Democrats think will appeal to blacks in front of black audiences. Hillary Clinton did this, Kamala Harris did this, and so did many others. None of them has any sort of down-home black background, it's pure cosplay for them.\n\nThe trans superiority narrative. The narrative is not merely a cry for \"trans rights,\" but an in-your-face rejection of objective reality that begins before birth. We are now told fetuses know in the womb they are trans, and mentally ill parents are encouraged to believe their infants have similar knowledge and must be transitioned lest they inevitably kill themselves. \"Do you want a trans son or a dead daughter?\" supposed therapists and doctors demand. What portion of the population \"identifies\" as trans? That's a difficult question, largely because the only way to determine if anyone is trans is if they are willing to identify as such, and that identification is subject to immediate change.\n\nIs it projection or just horse hockey? I can't tell.\n\nChicago Teachers Union President Claims Republicans Don't Want Black Children to Read. Stacy Davis Gates, president of the Chicago Teachers Union, seems nice. She verified what a lot of teacher union critics say. In a radio interview on Sunday, Gates told the host that conservatives don't want black children to learn to read because it is \"part of the oath they take to be right wing.\" [Advertisement] Well now. I must have missed that memo because I don't know anything about an oath. [...] It is as Republicans have claimed for many years — teacher unions are political activists not particularly focused on the needs of American school children. The union contract being negotiated now with Chicago's public school system calls for an extra $50 [billion] in funding. That's right — with a 'b'. The giant hike would pay for wage hikes as well as other demands. For example, the demands include fully paid-for abortions for union members, new migrant services and facilities, and many LGBTQ-related requirements and training in schools.\n\nBiden Launches $50M Anti-Trump Ad Blitz to Highlight Trump's Conviction. Joe Biden's campaign launched a $50 million television ad blitz on June 17, 2024, to hit Donald Trump over his 34-count felony business fraud conviction, which many of Trump's supporters describe as witchhunts. The 81-year-old's ad campaign was created to highlight Trump's conviction by a Manhattan jury on May 30, 2024, attacking Trump by calling him \"a convicted criminal who's only out for himself,\" the New York Post reported. \"In the courtroom, we see Donald Trump for who he is. Meanwhile, Joe Biden's been working, lowering healthcare costs and making big corporations pay their fair share. This election is between a convicted criminal who's only out for himself and a president who is fighting for your family,\" the narrator says in the 30-second ad titled \"Character Matters.\"\n\nThe Editor says...\n\nYes, character matters. Leaving a packet of cocaine in the White House matters. Ten percent for the Big Guy matters. Laundering money through Ukraine matters. Lying about an abandoned laptop matters. Stealing the 2020 presidential election matters. Putting a brain-dead puppet in the White House who will sign any bill they put on his desk really matters. Not knowing who the puppet masters are matters a lot, because nobody voted for them.\n\nJune temperatures [are] at half the level of this time last year. Temperatures in June 2024 are at half the level of 2023, the Met Office has said, although warmer weather is predicted towards the end of the month. While London was experiencing 32C (89.6F) a year ago, temperatures were around 16C (60.8F) in the capital on Tuesday. Similarly Cambridge had temperatures of 30.3C (86.5F) on June 11 2023, and 15C (59F) on the same day in 2024. Temperatures are around 2C (35.6F) below average for the time of year, with scattered showers this week that could turn into heavy rain by Thursday, while some areas could see ground frosts.\n\nThe Editor says...\n\nSomehow I would like to rebut the article above without including a cliché like cherry-picking. Oops, too late. It's easy to find examples of a high (or low) temperature on some date that was \"half\" (or \"double\") the temperature on the same day in the previous year. This is made easier by the use of the Celcius temperature scale, in which the day-to-day ambient temperatures are recorded with smaller numbers than in areas that use the Fahrenheit scale. But a decrease from 32°C. to 16°C. does not mean it's only half as warm outside. On the absolute (Kelvin) scale, that's a change from 305°K. to 289°K. Hardly any difference. This is another example of the news media attempting to make problems sound worse than they really are, and hoping you don't know why they are in error. These are the same people who sound the alarm about a one-half degree average temperature increase by the end of this century. On the absolute scale, it's almost no change at all. It's background noise, especially compared to the temperature differences between day and night and between summer and winter.\n\nAOC Worries Donald Trump Will Imprison Her Should He Win Re-Election.. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., recently expressed concern that if former President Trump were to win the November election, he might seek retribution against her by imprisoning her. Ocasio-Cortez shared her apprehensions during an interview with podcast host Kara Swisher for \"On with Kara Swisher,\" which was published on Thursday. During their conversation, they covered various topics including the influence of technology corporations, Ocasio-Cortez's previous clashes with Amazon, conservative fundraising by tech moguls, Israel, artificial intelligence, and the upcoming presidential election. Reflecting on Trump's past rhetoric, particularly his rallying cry of \"lock her up\" during his first campaign, Ocasio-Cortez remarked, \"I mean, it sounds nuts, but I wouldn't be surprised if this guy threw me in jail. He's out of his mind. I mean, he did his whole first campaign around 'lock her up.' This is his motto.\"\n\nThe Editor says...\n\n\"Lock her up\" was not Trump's motto, nor is it now, but rather a spontaneous chant from some of the crowds at his rallies, and it referred to Hillary Clinton, not AOC.\n\nThe Evidence Is In: Progressivism Is a Mental Illness. If elections and societal outcomes were about policies, conservatives would win every election, every time. By an overwhelming majority, the American electorate, even blacks, are desirous of a border wall with illegal migration sharply curtailed. The public strongly favors mandatory voter ID. The public wants a stronger police presence to ensure less crime. A majority of voters prefer lower taxes; school choice; and a colorblind, meritocratic society, rather than the race and gender-obsessed, tribalistic caste and spoils system the Democrats have forced upon us. Unfortunately, a majority of the electorate vote on base emotion, not policy, and this largely explains why Democrats are more successful at winning elections. Democrats have made the personal political, injecting politics into all subject matter and all sectors of society, and know how to carve up the electorate by race, playing to ethnic voters' fears and resentments, inflaming and then stroking each tribe's erogenous zones. This emotion-based play is why outright kooks and racists like AOC, Rashida Tlaib, and Ayanna Pressley are vastly more effective with the Democrat base than hapless and ineffectual Republicans are with the Republican voter base.\n\nMaxine Waters Demands Widespread Investigation of Trump Supporters, Claims They're 'Domestic Terrorists'. In a recent statement that has stirred significant controversy, Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA) has called upon the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to investigate the Trump fanbase, labeling them as âdomestic terrorists.â Waters expressed deep concern over the potential for violence and unrest from these supporters, accusing them of being a threat to national security and democracy. [Advertisement] âIâm going to spend some time with the criminal justice system, with the justice system,â Waters said during an appearance on MSNBC. âTell us what is going on with the domestic terrorists? Are they preparing a civil war against us? Should we be concerned about our safety? What is he doing with this divisive language?â [Tweet]\n\nPunked. This week, a lot of people and institutions got \"punked,\" that is, humiliated, by their own actions. [...] Let's start with the attack on Justice Samuel Alito. The Left simply cannot abide the fact that it doesn't control all branches of the government, and threatens to pack the court and, barring that, disparages and tries to force the recusal of justices Clarence Thomas and Alito from the presidential immunity case, if not their removal from the court altogether. They promote one pretext after another. Someone — maybe a dummy or a prankster determined to expose them as idiots — reported that once the American flag at Alito's home in Virginia briefly was flown upside down. In the fevered world of the Left, this represented Justice Alito's support of the January 6 \"Insurrection.\" [...] Not satisfied with this first, not terribly successful, smear of the justice, a second flag, a pine tree with the words \"An appeal to God\" flown at the family's vacation home, became the get-Alito rallying point. The usual media mob, and even the once sane Bill Kristol (who years before had endorsed Alito for the court) argued this was further evidence of disqualifying bias by Alito because one person on January 6 waved such a flag. In fact, the flag is an historic one. It was created during the Revolutionary War and was used by George Washington's troops.\n\nEscaping from Bloody Reality. The latest illustration of a disastrous gaffe concerns Kristi Noem, South Dakota's telegenic governor who was seriously considered a potential vice presidential candidate for Donald Trump. In her forthcoming book, [...] she admitted to personally shooting her 14-month-old dog, Cricket, who was unsuitable for hunting due to her aggressive nature. Cricket also killed chickens, seemingly for the fun of it. She further dispatched a goat that smelled \"disgusting, musky, rancid,\" and loved to chase her children, even knocking them down and dirtying their clothes. The shooting incident happened 20 years ago but the current re-telling immediately went viral and her identity became Kristi Noem, puppy and goat killer. [...] According to the ASPCA's recent data, approximately 390,000 dogs are annually euthanized in its shelters. An estimated 2 million dogs die in \"puppy mills\" each year due to being unsellable or no longer able to breed. [...] Clearly, the governor is not a sadistic nutcase, and she explains in her book that the purpose of telling this story is to show that she is willing to make tough decisions when necessary. Roughly three-plus million dogs are euthanized annually, and 20 years ago Kristi Noem killed one.\n\nThe Damaging Modern Cultural Imperative of 'Compassion'. Once you see misguided \"compassion\" as the foundational leftist value, it's no longer so confusing to see the relentless push for obscure and societally rare practices such as trans athletes, queer, or other strange and hard-to-define proclivities like gender fluidity. We are no longer allowed to make judgments based on logic, history, and our powers of deductive reasoning. Instead, we must travel with the herd and make sure we don't think independently or rationally, lest we realize that compassion is not a foundation but is, instead, the emotion we use that can fend off logic.\n\nYou are being nudged. These strategies of influence exploit the fact that human beings operate almost all of the time on autopilot, making moment-by-moment decisions without conscious reflection and relying on imperfect heuristics to navigate the complexities of the world around them. The most obvious example of the government's use of behavioural science strategies occurred throughout the Covid years, when the public health messaging campaign, aimed at levering compliance with restrictions and the vaccine rollout, was infused with these covert methods of persuasion. Three of the most prominent nudges deployed during this period were fear-inflation, shaming and peer pressure — or \"affect\", \"ego\" and \"norms\", to use the language of behavioural science. A frightened population is typically a compliant one, so we were bombarded with daily death counts and slogans such as, \"If you go out, you can spread it, people will die\".\n\nBiden's Climate Change Scare Tactics Aren't Working. First, the stage must be set. The joke that currently occupies the Bully Pulpit says he's the first climate president, says he's making history by confronting the climate crisis, not denying it. \"I'm taking the most significant action on climate ever in the history of the world.\" Now to his latest tactic. Biden gave a warning on climate change in September 2021, when he surveyed damage caused by Hurricane Ida in New York and New Jersey. \"We've got to listen to the scientists ... they all tell us this is code red. ... The nation and the world are in peril, and that's not hyperbole. This is everybody's crisis.\" While in Louisiana he said, \"We don't have any more time.\" [...] There's little doubt that our \"first climate president\" is trying to scare people, especially young voters, into thinking climate change has reached crisis mode and we must do whatever it takes to mitigate it — now!\n\nMany of the 'Climate Experts' Surveyed by the Guardian in Recent Propaganda Blitz Turn Out to be Emotionally-Unstable Hysterics. The Guardian last week published its survey of 'climate experts'. The results are a predictable mush of fire-and-brimstone predictions and emotional incontinence. This stunt may have convinced those already aligned to the newspaper's ideological agenda to redouble their characteristically shrill rhetoric, but encouraging scientists to speculate and emote about the future of the planet looks like an act of political desperation, not scientific communication. For the purposes of creating this story, the Guardian's Environment Editor Damian Carrington contacted 843 'lead authors' of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's reports (IPCC) and 383 responded to his questions. The actual substance of the survey does not seem to have been published by the paper, but the main response Carrington wanted to get from his respondents was an estimate of how much global warming there will be by the end of the century.\n\nFearmongering keeps the elites in power. \"CO2 levels are rising faster than ever\" read the headline of the StarTribune, citing a recent Washington Post article. The earth is burning up! Back in the 1970s, \"experts\" were certain that the earth was going into a global deep freeze. And that the \"population bomb\" would lead to a mass die-off of people in just a few short decades. (And now most Western nations' fertility rates are well below replacement level.) Soon thereafter, experts warned that acid rain was going to dissolve all our buildings and statues, and otherwise wreak havoc on us all. That didn't happen, but groups like BLM and Antifa stepped in to do the job. [...] Purple loose strife is taking over our land, and zebra mussels and spiny water fleas are taking over our lakes, rivers, and oceans! The glaciers are melting, and we're all going to drown! Climate change is leading to drought everywhere and we're all going to die of thirst and starvation! [...] The incessant oncoming disasters rarely, if ever, pan out.\n\nMaxine Waters Thinks Trump Supporters Are Training for Massive Attack on Nation. California sure has a way of finding the worst possible candidates to represent them in Congress. Many are the most extreme kind of leftists who saw Donald Trump's presidency as the second coming of Adolf Hitler. Like, Democratic Rep. Maxine Waters, who, in a recent interview on MSNBC, spouted an unhinged conspiracy theory about evil Trump supporters. As seen in a clip shared to the social media platform X by RNC Research, Waters spoke to Jonathan Capehart on his show, \"The Sunday Show with Jonathan Capehart.\" [Tweet with video clip]\n\nRenowned Scientist: All Covid-Vaxxed 'Will Die in 3 to 5 Years'. A world-renowned scientist and leading immunology expert has raised the alarm with an explosive warning to the public that everyone who has been vaccinated with Covid mRNA shots \"will die within 3 to 5 years, even if they have had only one injection.\" The alert was issued by Professor Dr. Dolores Cahill. Prof. Cahill has over 25 years of expertise in high-throughput protein array, antibody array, proteomics technology development, and automation. The experience includes work on how proteins and antibodies can be used in biomedical applications, including in biomarker discovery, diagnostics, and personalized medicine.\n\nThe Editor says...\n\nI don't believe everyone will die from vaccinations any more than I believe doomsday predictions about global warming. Statements like this make good clickbait, that's all.\n\nMarxist Health Officials Want You Committed. One of the more insidious features of Marxism's manipulation of language is its stigmatization of opposing points of view as some form of mental disorder. Opposition to \"gay marriage\" is said to be a \"sign\" of homophobia. Distrusting Islamic terrorists who celebrate 9/11 and shout, \"Death to America,\" is a \"symptom\" of Islamophobia. Wanting the federal government to secure our borders and enforce existing immigration law \"reveals\" underlying xenophobia. Not wanting biological men to force their way into ladies' locker-rooms and showers suggests that a person \"suffers\" from dreaded transphobia. Notice that all these purported psychiatric disorders are categorized as \"phobias,\" or more plainly, as \"irrational fears.\" Marxists routinely use loaded medical language not only to demonize or disgrace their foes but also to transform any political disagreement into something that it is not. [...] You could say that Marxists are committed to the lie that opposition to Marxism rests on irrational fear.\n\nProjection:\n\nJoe Scarborough Melts Down Again, Says Trump Supporters \"Hate America\" and Want a \"Dictatorship\". Watching Joe Scarborough's Morning Joe is a front-row seat to the effects of Trump Derangement Syndrome. Scarborough suffered a humiliating meltdown in March after getting called out for lying about President Trump on X. Now, in his latest episode of unhinged anger, Scarborough rages that Trump supporters \"hate America.\" \"What's wrong with you? Who raised you? What history did you read? Where are you from? Because you may claim to be from where I'm from, but you were not raised by the same teachers I was raised by, and you don't read,\" Scarborough said.\n\nMore projection:\n\nHillary Clinton Says Trump Wants to Kill His Opposition. Hillary Clinton described Joe Biden and the Democrat party and she trashed Trump during her podcast interview with Marc Elias, a far-left lawyer who helped Hillary purchase the fake Trump-Russia dossier in 2016. Typical projection. \"Putin does what [Trump] would like to do,\" Hillary Clinton said to corrupt left-wing lawyer Marc Elias on his \"Democracy Docket\" podcast. \"Kill his opposition, imprison his opposition, drive journalists into exile, rule without any check or balance. That's what Trump really wants. And so we have to be very conscious of how he sees the world because in that world, he only sees strong men leaders. He sees Putin. He sees Xi. He sees Kim Jong Un in North Korea. Those are the people he is modeling himself after and we've been down this road in our, you know, world history. We sure don't want to go down that again.\"\n\nIt's time to talk about Eco-anxiety. [\"]If it bleeds, it leads[\"] has long been newspapers' motto and nothing has changed. There's even books on the subject, as sociology writers pounce upon social manias like carrion birds. Ben Cooke in reviewing The Weight of Nature by Clayton Page Aldern says how he reads about climate change and climate disasters every day, without any reflection upon the fact that fatalities from natural disasters (notice the importance of switching 'climate' with 'natural') have been in steady decline over the past 100 years. In a no way hysteria-led piece of research, Scientists now say that even a pair of jeans could be bad for the environment. Funny how they're not accusing lab coats, or even pointless face masks, of the same thing. [...] It's little wonder that eco-anxiety involves 'feeling grief, guilt, fear or hopelessness about the future of the planet due to climate change' if experts are competing for the bigger horror story.\n\nTrump Apocalypse Hysteria Is Spiraling Into Madness. Take a dip in the murky waters of recent Trump Apocalypse journalism — it says there's gonna be a civil war and dictatorship. But don't worry, not really — it's just the politics of fear. In a scary article subtitled \"Donald Trump is warning that 2024 could be America's last election,\" New Republic alerts us that, if Trump wins, America is pretty much done being a democracy. [...] Whew. Once you step across the line into writing about Trump dictatorships and Christian nationalism as living, breathing threats, things get pretty crazy pretty fast. Why is this? Occam's Razor says this is all hullabaloo, pure malarkey, with tabloid-jealous writers doing it for the most clicks and dopamine hits, trying to outdo one another trying to whip up fear of Trump. It is good for business, and very easy to do. Freed from the old-school journalism restraints of having to muster facts to support opinions, anything — including imagining a civil war — is possible.\n\nNo Political Movement On Earth Can Match The Hyperbole Of The Climate-Alarm Community. When it comes to rank hyperbole, no political movement on earth can ever hope to match the stuff that comes out of the climate alarm community. They have treated us to so many dire warnings about having just 10 years or 7 years or 12 years or 5 years to ward off certain impending doom since the global warming movement sprung to life in the 1980s that it has all long since become so much background noise to most ordinary citizens. That in and of itself is a problem, given that, while we \"normals\" out here in flyover county laughingly dismiss their latest bit of nonsense, the activists and their coordinating policymakers keep doubling- and tripling-down on their freedom and energy security destroying initiatives. Laugh all you want, but this is all deadly serious business. There are trillions of dollars at stake. A great example of the seemingly limitless stream of hyperbole came this week from United Nations executive climate secretary Simon Stiell, who told an audience at the Chatham House think tank in London that previous predictions of having just 12, or 10, or 7 years to act were overly generous. In fact, in Mr. Steill's version of climate reality, the global community is now down to just 2 short years to reverse the flow of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere to stave off catastrophic climate change of some sort or another.\n\nHidden Behind Climate Policies, Data From Nonexistent Temperature Stations. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) predicts July, August, and September will be hotter than usual. And for those who view warmer temperatures as problematic, that's a significant cause for concern. \"Earth's issuing a distress call,\" said United Nations secretary-general António Guterres on March 19. \"The latest State of the Global Climate report shows a planet on the brink.\n\nThe Editor says...\n\nThe Earth is not issuing a distress call. There is no climate emergency.\n\nHow to spot the next mania: Each new panic follows the same playbook. The social mania displays a few consistent characteristics. First and foremost, it never seems like a social mania at the time. In the thick of a widespread preoccupation, its precepts simply seem like the truth. Trans women are women; get over it. Or: masculinity is toxic; virtually all women have been subject to sexual torment and male abuse of power; regarding any accusations they make, no matter how far-fetched or petty, women must be believed. Or: Covid-19 is so lethal, and such a threat to our endurance as a species, that we've no choice but to shut down our whole economies and abdicate our every civil liberty to contain the disease. Or: all Western countries are \"systemically racist\"; all white people are genetically racist; the police are all racist (even if they're black) and should be defunded or abolished; the only remedy for \"structural racism\" is anti-meritocratic, over-compensatory racial quotas in hiring and education.\n\nDems Realize They Can't Win on Biden's Record, Stake Everything on Trump-Hate. Hey, have you heard the news? \"Our democracy\" is on the brink. An unscrupulous narcissist with dictatorial ambitions and a hatred for legitimate political opposition could win the presidency in November, and that will very likely be the last time that patriotic Americans get a chance to elect their chief executive. [...] In fact, there is a very real threat to America's continuing to function as a free republic, but that threat isn't coming from where Democrats are claiming. They're saying that if Bad Orange Man returns to the White House on Jan. 20, 2025, \"democracy\" will be dead. [...] This claim is not only absurd and offensive; it's a classic case of projection. The American republic (remember, kids: it's not a democracy) is indeed in serious danger, but the danger is coming from those who are claiming that they are trying to save it from Trump.\n\nReady for the 2024 Election Pandemic? It's that time of the election season again. Pandemic time! And this time it's angry! [Tweet] I don't want to dismiss the possibility of a genuinely bad pandemic hitting our shores because it is obviously possible. But really? After the last few years, you would have to be an idiot not to be suspicious when people start trotting out the \"We are all going to die!\" meme. COVID, but 100 times worse! Disease X. Bird Flu.\n\nIt Seems Climate Extremism Knows No Bounds. From blocking commutes by lying in traffic to vandalizing priceless pieces of art, it seems there's no conduct too low for the climate extremists[.] The latest gambit came from a group called \"Climate Defiance\", which accused the head of Chevron of \"killing people\" during a disgraceful outburst in New York. [...] An alarming story from the Washington Post detailed that, \"vast swaths of the United States are at risk of running short of power.\" The rise of emerging technology like AI and data centers are two major drivers. Power outages become even more frightening during bouts of extreme heat or cold that can quickly become life-or-death situations. We need more energy from every direction. Now is not the time to be taking the most reliable players off the board. Then there is the issue of the environment. American oil and gas companies are highly regulated and subject to strict standards. They also are trying good faith partners in environmental stewardship. Chevron has pledged $10 billion in lower 'carbon' investments and projects by 2028. Other countries cannot say the same.\n\nRepublican 'War on Women' Is a Media Myth. Republicans have been accused of waging a \"war on women\" for several election cycles now. But is there any truth to this claim? Democrats and their supporters in the media are leaning into an election-year fear-mongering campaign about Republican \"bans\" on reproductive rights. In their redefinition, any limitation on abortion throughout pregnancy, even in the third trimester, is a \"ban.\" Even more disingenuous, Democrats have also accused Republicans of threatening birth control and, most recently, IVF. Welcome to the political silly season. Both parties have people on their fringes who take extreme positions, but that doesn't make it the party's position or long-term objective. And both parties have political consultants who know how to misconstrue the intention behind certain pieces of legislation.\n\nGlobalism Thrives on Crisis. Globalists know that nothing drives public policy so much as the fear of impending death. Nuclear weapons and intercontinental ballistic missiles may have scared the snot out of anyone living through the Cold War, but they were (and still are) the gifts that keep on giving for the military-industrial complex and national security surveillance State. The more catastrophic the consequences of any perceived threat, the more likely that otherwise skeptical human beings will hand over their freedoms in exchange for the elusive promise of personal security. Political systems specialize in exploiting this \"Save Me!\" impulse for maximum leverage. \"Looming apocalypse\" is Big Government's best salesman every year. Ghost stories about \"global warming\" work the same way.\n\nSan Francisco man who stabbed Asian woman, 94, multiple times gets probation after soft-touch judge was told he'd suffered 'trauma'. A San Francisco man who stabbed a 94-year-old in the street has avoided jail after being sentenced to probation and a 'behavioral and mental health treatment program.' Daniel Cauich stabbed Chinese and Vietnamese immigrant Anh 'Peng' Taylor multiple times in San Francisco's Lower Nob Hill neighborhood in broad daylight in June 2021. The senseless attack was caught on camera and sent shockwaves through the city during a period of increased attacks on Asian Americans.\n\nThe Government Is Not Your Daddy. It's no secret that many Democrat voters have \"daddy\" issues. They grew up in homes without strong, loving fathers and desperately seek from government what they never found in their youths: a protective authority figure and lifelong role model. When Democrats with \"daddy\" issues find their way into power, they force their own psychological deficiencies upon the broader populace. Why? Because they try to play \"father\" to their constituents but have no idea how a good father is supposed to behave. They scream and shout because they confuse insults and tantrums with masculinity. They reimagine the ideal male leader as someone who would enjoy wearing make-up and behaving like a teenage girl. They demand that male \"allies\" relinquish any say over the healthy delivery of their unborn children. Instead of taking personal responsibility for missteps in life, they blame their problems on the nebulous \"patriarchy\" — or rather, the failed fathers of the past!\n\nSynthetic Controversy. [Scroll down] Synthetic controversy is often weaponized and deployed in the context of another social media trolling strategy known as \"rage farming\" or \"rage-baiting\". Wikipedia defines these terms as manipulative tactics designed to elicit outrage with the goal of increasing internet traffic, online engagement, revenue and support. Rage baiting or farming can be used as a tool to increase engagement, attract subscribers, followers, and supporters, which can be financially lucrative. Rage baiting and rage farming manipulates users to respond in kind to offensive, inflammatory headlines, memes, tropes, or comments. Rage-farming, which has become a widespread troll and bot tactic since at least January 2022, is an offshoot of rage-baiting where the outrage of the person being provoked is farmed or manipulated into an online engagement by rage-seeding that helps amplify the message of the original content creator. It has also been used as a political tactic at the expense of one's opponent. You are probably familiar with individual substacks, podcasters and self-styled online \"independent reporters\" who specialize in these methods.\n\nI haven't seen this many projectors since elementary school.\n\nKamala Harris Says if Reelected, Trump Will Weaponize the Department of Justice Against His Enemies. During a campaign appearance in Denver this week, Vice President Kamala Harris warned the audience that if Trump is reelected, he will weaponize the Department of Justice against his enemies. That's a rather ironic statement, considering that this is exactly what the Biden administration is doing right now. In recent years, Democrats have mastered the art of projection, accusing others of trying to do what they are actually doing in real time.\n\nThe true cost of everything. [Scroll down] Hope and change was out the window. That mantra's time had passed. It was now time to declare an all-out war on those who would destroy our democracy and was reflected in Biden's intro with a \"worst of times\" reference to FDR's wartime SOTU. While not outright comparing himself to Roosevelt, the implication was there, and so was the thesis that freedom and democracy are under attack. Having set his rhetorical table, he moved through his laundry list of issues, taking great care to touch all bases with all potential voting groups. He laid out a smorgasbord board of pandering to every American, encouraging all of us to take what we wanted because there was more in the kitchen if we would only not rehire the previous cook. The speech was also a liberal's road map for government largesse that would require Americans to suit up and go to war with big corporations, big pharma, unscrupulous landlords and all those (read: Republican) insurrectionists who are intent on bringing down the world's greatest democracy. Some examples of Bidenspeak were: \"You can't love your country only when you win,\" \"Trump failed at COVID,\" \"I will restore Roe v. Wade again,\" and my favorite, which sums up his administration's and his party's credo: \"You can't lead America with ancient ideas.\"\n\nThe Editor says...\n\nThe Constitution, the Declaration of Indepence, the Magna Carta, and the Bible are full of \"ancient ideas\" that are well suited to government.\n\nThe Real State of the Union. Most of the time, a president's State of the Union speech is avuncular. [...] The point of a president presenting himself as everyone's favorite uncle is to sell us on the idea that all is well in the Land of Oz: \"all friendly like\" as Eliza Doolittle put it. But obviously, right now in Bidenomics America, everything is not under control. So forget Uncle Joe. It was Biden the Barbarian, politics red in tooth and claw, on Thursday night. Naturally, the president started out by bellowing that the U.S. is beset by enemies, foreign and domestic. [\"]What makes our moment rare is that freedom and democracy are under attack, both at home and overseas, at the very same time.[\"] It's Putin abroad and insurrectionists at home.\n\nBiden Campaign Releases New Ad Comparing Trump and His Supporters to the KKK. The internal polling on African Americans must be through the roof for Donald Trump. After his nasty dishonest SOTU Address last night — the Biden team released a new ad on Friday comparing Trump supporters to the KKK. The Biden ad shows images of Donald Trump with KKK marchers and a noose. Why is this not flagged by Google-YouTube for violent content and misinformation? [Video clip]\n\nFact-Checking the Fabulist in Chief's State of the Union. During Thursday's State of the Union address, Biden fully displayed his fabulist tendencies. His assessment of the administration's accomplishments and his impact was not anchored in reality. [...] Of course, he went on a \"pay your fair share\" rant, accusing Republicans of giving corporations and the wealthy tax cuts. The top 10% of taxpayers pay roughly 75% of all federal tax collected. And the U.S. Treasury begs to differ. The wealthy pay a much larger share of their total income.\n\nTrump's Promise — Retribution or Revenge? [Scroll down] The New York Times, with a long history of publishing falsehoods about Donald Trump, has already labeled Trump's potential second term, \"The Retribution Presidency.\" There is a smell of panic rising from midtown Manhattan and from the Beltway. Is this revenge or retribution? Is there a distinction? [...] Here is a summary of the two terms. Words do matter.\n\n• Retribution is a form of punishment imposed by law and legally authorized.\n\n• Revenge, in contrast, is a form of personal punishment, one not sanctioned by law.\n\n• The ultimate goal of Retribution is to punish the wrongdoer or offender and ensure that justice is served to the victim and public as a whole.\n\n• Revenge, however, is a form of payback, to ensure that personal justice is served. Thus, the goal of Revenge is vengeance or getting even.\n\n• Retribution is only carried out for crimes and wrongs recognized in the law. It is not personal and not fueled by a desire to persistently seek the suffering of the wrongdoer. Instead, it imposes a punishment that is proportionate to the gravity of the crime or wrong. Furthermore, it is governed by procedural rules and codes of conduct.\n\n• In contrast, Revenge can be carried out for various wrongs, injuries, suffering and any other action considered harmful or hurtful. There is no limit to the type of punishment imposed and the severity of such punishment. As mentioned before, Revenge is personal and driven by a strong emotional desire to see the suffering of the person who committed the wrong or injury.\n\nWhich of these two words describe what the deep state ruling class has done to Trump versus what he will hopefully do if reelected president?\n\nJohn Kerry Tries Out A New Climate Catchphrase To Ratchet Up The Fear. In an interview with The Guardian this week, ex-White House climate envoy John Kerry tried out new language to describe the globalist view of what is happening with the world's climate. Now, according to Mr. Kerry, we are in the midst of a \"climate breakdown.\" To review, here is the progression of favored terminology dictated by the globalist elites related to their climate hysteria:\n\n• In the beginning, there was \"global warming.\"\n\n• Then, the favored talking point morphed into the more inclusive \"climate change\" to allow the scaremongers to blame every weather event, whether warm or cold, on their problem.\n\n• Next, they elevated the fright rhetoric to a nebulous \"climate crisis.\"\n\n• When that didn't work to sufficiently hold the public's attention, they elevated it further to a \"climate emergency.\"\n\n• Seeing their 2024 election year polls lagging, they now move to the even more alarming \"climate breakdown.\"\n\nCan a \"climate catastrophe\" or, even better, a \"climate collapse\" be far behind?\n\nJoe Biden's Scary Speech on Jan. 6. Just recently, ahead of the anniversary of Jan. 6, President Joe Biden gave a speech near Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, to kick off his 2024 campaign. His theme was that the upcoming presidential election will determine whether or not America remains a democracy because a vote for Donald Trump is a vote to end democracy in America.\n\nOn Being a White, Male, Nazi, Insurrectionist RINO. A recent email exchange with a feminist college professor regarding the resignation of Harvard president Claudine Gay was abruptly terminated with an angry email informing me that White men were responsible for all the evils in America and that if this group of racist \"genocidal maniacs\" were eliminated this country would be a more \"loving and hospitable\" place for women and people of color. A stance long espoused by the radical American Left and a position increasingly permeating the festering halls of academia. My immediate thought after the exchange was that we have reached the pinnacle of lunacy in this country and that my résumé is now complete. I am not only a racist but, due to my sex and skin color, I am also a genocidal maniac who should be summarily executed. Per many in the Democrat Party, I am a Nazi sympathizer because I voted for Donald Trump in 2016 as well as financially supported, campaigned, and voted for him in 2020 but far worse, I am extraordinarily fond of this nation. The Biden Administration has categorized me as an \"insurrectionist\" for attending the January 6, 2021 \"Stop the Steal\" rally.\n\nSo Trump is Really Hitler? Donald Trump is often compared to Hitler by otherwise normal people. If they go beyond a simple assertion of similarity the fearful ones do not compare the actions and experiences of the two, but rather they take their worst imaginings of what Trump might do in the future — which, surprisingly, are very like what Hitler did. These wild fears are too removed from reality to deserve serious consideration. But we have detailed information about both Trump and Hitler, so real comparisons can be made, and there are significant differences that ought to be remembered. The first has to do with political activity. From the end of World War I when Hitler was nearly 30 years old he devoted his life exclusively to seeking power. Donald Trump, on the other hand, graduated from U. Penn at the age of 22, and for the next 40 years or more devoted himself to making money. [...] In 2016, at the age of 70, Donald Trump, for the first time, decided to seek power. He subjected himself to years of calumny and subversion and harassment by petty politicians, lawyers, and media personalities. His net wealth declined significantly.\n\nTaylor Lorenz Whines About Missing Christmas, Blames the Unmasked. When it comes to the COVID-19 hysteria, it appears most people have moved on. But others can't seem to let the pandemic go. Washington Post media activist Taylor Lorenz is one of the latter. Since it became clear that the coronavirus was no longer a threat, she has been insisting that the rest of the nation should still go through mask and vaccine mandates and take precautions to keep people like her safe.\n\nDem Rep. Moulton: We Need Citizenship for DACA Kids. On Friday's broadcast of CNN International's \"State of the Race,\" Rep. Seth Moulton (D-MA) stated that Israel and Ukraine funding are important and border security needs to be tightened, but House Speaker Rep. Mike Johnson (R-LA) is \"catering to the extremists\" by putting them together because it doesn't include \"a pathway to citizenship for kids like DACA kids, who came here with their parents through no fault of their own, and are essentially living as aliens in their own country.\"\n\nThe Editor says...\n\nNo, they are living as aliens in someone else's country, because they are aliens! If you don't like living as an alien, go back to your home country.\n\nGlobalists Fear the Unconquerable. For fifty years, politicians and oligarchs in search of an excuse to seize greater control over economic activity have urged humanity to fear the weather. If the recent government-induced hyperventilation over COVID is a harbinger of things to come, politicians and oligarchs will continue to urge humanity to fear pathogenic illnesses. What if the spirit of Montaigne, Henley, or Kipling instead gripped today's generations as they did in the past? Children would not be indoctrinated to fear a \"climate apocalypse\"; they would be assured that humanity is never more ingenious than when it is tested. Grown adults would not be infantilized to hide under their beds at the sound of a sneeze; they would be encouraged to \"keep calm and carry on\" for the sake of their families and communities. Can you imagine political leaders telling those generations who endured the Great Depression and two world wars that the obstacles before them were too daunting to survive? Yet political \"leaders\" today throw their hands up in the air at the first sign of trouble and scream for everyone to hear, \"We're all gonna die!\"\n\nDictatorship Is as Dictatorship Does. The lower President Biden sinks in the polls, the more outlandish his claims about his likely 2024 opponent become. He insists that the main reason he is running for another term is that former President Trump poses an existential threat to \"our democracy.\" Recently, for example, Biden equated Trump's speeches with the \"language you heard in Nazi Germany in the '30s.\" This is an increasingly popular theme with Trump's antagonists. TDS victim Liz Cheney recently told CBS News that electing Trump was analogous to \"sleepwalking into dictatorship.\" Trump, on the other hand, says that Biden is the real threat: \"Joe Biden is the destroyer of American democracy.\" In a healthy political environment with a properly functioning Fourth Estate, the voters could easily differentiate between fact and fiction in this surreal debate. Sadly, the legacy media amounts to little more than the propaganda arm of the Democratic Party. There are still honest news outlets — like the one you're reading now — but many are being systematically suppressed on behalf of the government through entities such as Newsguard that ostensibly identify and demonetize purveyors of \"misinformation.\"\n\nJoe Biden's dull-witted campaign, plagiarized from Obama. Anybody smell the aroma of stale campaign narratives, dating from the Obama years? Look at these talking points coming out from Team Biden's stepped-up presidential campaign on Twitter: [Tweets] [...] It sounds like the consultants and political operatives crafting the Biden campaign can't think of a thing good to say about the Biden administration, so they resort to the old Obama-era tropes, plagiarizing them in the Biden way. Tax the rich and all will be fixed. Women make 59 cents on the dollar compared to what men make. Trump wants to take away your health care.\n\nChicago Mayor Brandon Johnson Blames 'Right-Wing Extremists' for City's Problems. Democrat Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson blamed \"right-wing extremism\" for some of the ills facing his crime-ridden city. Johnson issued his statement about the \"far right\" during a press conference on Tuesday. \"What we've seen is a very raggedy form of right-wing extremism,\" the mayor said. \"Everyone knows that the right-wing extremism in this country has targeted democratically run cities, and quite frankly, they have been quite intentional about going after democratically ran [sic] cities that are led by people of color.\"\n\nThe Editor says...\n\nWhat does \"going after\" mean? If someone \"goes after\" you, does that cause you to make bad decisions?\n\nPope Francis: Climate Change Puts 'Life on Earth' at Risk. Pope Francis asserted Sunday that global warming is contrary to God's plan and presents a significant risk to all \"life on earth.\" \"Besides war, our world is threatened by another great danger, that of the climate, which puts life on Earth, especially for the future generations, at risk,\" the pontiff stated in a written text, which was read aloud by his aide Monsignor Paolo Braida following the weekly Angelus prayer.\n\nThe Editor says...\n\nThe Pope is either badly misinformed, poorly educated, delusional, or dishonest to state that the Earth has been operating perfectly for thousands of years, but our use of the internal combustion engine is about to make it uninhabitable.\n\nAnother Climate Snow Job. A federal bureaucrat is telling us that due to human activity, global snowfall is in decline. There's no reason to be worried, though. We've seen the climate doomsday predictions before, and somehow they always turn out to be wrong. Nearly a quarter of a century ago, we were assured by the British Independent that \"Snowfalls are now just a thing of the past.\" (Don't bother to try to find the story in the Independent's archives — that page doesn't exist or has been moved, presumably because it's an embarrassment to the newspaper.) In that article, reporter Charles Onians appealed to the correct authorities, citing David Viner, then a senior scientist at the climatic research unit of the University of East Anglia, who declared that \"within a few years winter snowfall will become 'a very rare and exciting event.'\" He told Onians that \"children just aren't going to know what snow is.\"\n\nFormer Democrat Senator Says Trump Is More Dangerous Than Hitler. MSNBC contributor and former Democrat U.S. Senator of Missouri, Claire McCaskill, recently went on air and wrongly claimed Donald Trump is \"even more dangerous\" than dictators Benito Mussolini and Adolf Hitler. While on MSNBC's Dateline, McCaskill stated, \"A lot of people have tried to draw similarities between Mussolini and Hitler and the use of the terminology like 'vermin' and the drive that those men had towards autocracy and dictatorship.\" She continued, \"The difference, though, I think makes Donald Trump even more dangerous, and that is he has no philosophy he believes in.\"\n\nJoe Biden supporters had an especially paranoid couple of days. It's amazing that this man was once a congressman, because he clearly has zero understanding of both political philosophies and the American political system — for the umpteenth time, fascism is a leftist ideology and America was never supposed to be a democracy — and on a recently-broadcast televised MSNBC segment, Joe Scarborough issued an ominous warning: if President Trump secures a second term, he will \"imprison\" and \"execute\" any and all political opponents that he can. Projection much? Who's really been imprisoning and executing political opponents? Does the name Ashli Babbitt ring a bell? What about Craig Robertson? Owen Shroyer? Or how about the J6ers? Or, is this a signal of guilt? Has he done something criminal and he's starting to sweat? Talk about paranoia! But it wasn't just Scarborough because Scary Larry, a prominent Twitter Democrat, announced that another Trump presidency meant an official Brownshirt squad, and Trump already had his gang ready to go: [Tweet]\n\nWhy Governments Have Replaced God with Global Warming. At the United Nations, dopey diplomats speak in flowery clichés about the value of international cooperation. In the real world, though, governments succeed in corralling their peoples into pens only if everyone is afraid. North Korea's dictator must make his people afraid of Americans. America's dictator must make his people afraid of Russians. The European Union's dictators must make their hodgepodge of nations all afraid of nationalists. The ruling atheists must make their postmodern peoples all hostile to Israel. And the whole smorgasbord of manipulative, malicious governments must keep the world's peasants perpetually petrified of COVID... and \"hate speech\"... and Donald Trump... and, most importantly, \"global warming\"!\n\nNew York Times Claims 'Economic Turmoil' if Trump Enforces Border Laws. The nation will be pushed toward \"social and economic turmoil,\" if a reelected President Donald Trump tries to enforce Congress's border laws, the New York Times claimed on November 11. \"Sweeping Raids, Giant Camps and Mass Deportations: Inside Trump's 2025 Immigration Plans,\" declared the headline for an article about President Donald Trump's campaign promises to enforce border policies if he is elected.\n\nUnhinged Democrats seethe at Republicans even existing. A viral video of a Democrat abusing a poll greeter on Election Day in northern Virginia encapsulates how the demonization of \"MAGA Republicans\" and the weaponization of the justice system has unhinged and energized voters on the left. [Profanity-infused tirade omitted.] The object of his ire was Matthew Hurtt, the clean-cut young chairman of the Arlington County Republicans, who was handing out sample ballots alongside his Democratic counterpart. \"Have a nice day,\" Hurtt said pleasantly. The courtesy only further enraged the aggressor, who has been identified online as a federal government employee — no surprise. [...] Arlington Man clearly has anger management issues, but his freak-out at the imaginary threat posed by his Republican neighbors is by design. He's a model product of the Disinformation Industrial Complex, brainwashed and triggered by the hateful lies he's been fed about the Jan. 6 Capitol riot and the nature of Republicans. He is why Democrats work so hard to preserve their dishonest \"narrative\" — and that requires censorship of dissenting views and suppression of contrary evidence, as well as seeding lies into the media. It's why Hillary Clinton salivates about \"deprogramming\" her political opponents. She is projecting again.\n\nWas October 7 an Earthquake for the Democrats? [The average] Joe has always voted for Democrats because a vote for Republicans is unthinkable. A vote for a Republican would be a vote for\n\n• Putting Blacks back in chains,\n\n• Pushing grandma off a cliff,\n\n• Returning women to their role as domestic servants,\n\n• Turning the Earth into a lifeless cinder, and\n\n• Giving machine guns to every deranged nut looking for a headline.\n\nIn short, Joe has bought the \"Republicans are evil\" rubbish of the propagandists. True evil always masquerades as virtue. Joe has simply been fooled by the virtuous mask — so he votes Democrat.\n\nThe Food Insecurity Lie. President Joe Biden says 24 million Americans \"suffer from food insecurity!\" News anchors were shocked that there is \"food insecurity in the richest country in the world!\" ABC hosts turned \"insecurity\" into \"hunger.\" But in my new video, Rachel Sheffield, who researches welfare policy at the Heritage Foundation, explains, \"Food insecurity is not the same thing as hunger. It just means that they had to rely on cheaper foods, store-brand alternatives ... or reduce variety.\" Really? The alarm about \"food insecurity\" is based on that? Well, yes.\n\nThe Elite Conspiracy to Monopolize Opinion Through Propaganda. Sadly, we are not taught how to guard against these techniques, writes Michelle Stiles in One Idea to Rule Them All: Reverse Engineering American Propaganda. This ignorance, she says, has \"devastating consequences for both individuals and society as a whole.\" [...] The author's primary motivation in writing the book is to help people recognize the extent of propaganda. One key, she says, is to pinpoint the distortion of reality through words — size-challenged for fat, and minor-attracted persons for pedophiles come to mind. Another, she says, is the manipulative infusion of moral connotations into language — science vs. anti-science, and climate denier or climate skeptic for those who question climate change. She hopes her parsing of numerous examples will teach those who believe in freedom to recognize patterns of manipulation, start to follow the money, listen to whistleblowers, and dig deep to seek the truth and counter tyranny.\n\nThe actual 'climate change' agenda. The latest edition of the State of the Climate Report, published this week in the journal BioScience, begins rather ominously: \"Life on planet Earth is under siege. We are now in an uncharted territory.\" These sentences are meant to instill abject fear and evoke a sense of doom in the general public. However, they are patently absurd and ought to be disregarded outright.\n\nThe Role of the Smartphone and Digital Content in the Left's Revolution. Christopher Rufo, Douglas Murray, and Victor Davis Hanson have all pointed out that we are in the middle of a cultural revolution that is assailing our culture, values, traditions, and institutions, our national security and sovereignty, our economy, our Constitution and rule of law, and our overall quality of life. The percentage of Americans saying they are worse off is at its highest level since 2009. One of the most fascinating aspects of this obvious decline is that leftists have managed to convince a very large portion (in many cases a majority) of Americans to support the divisive and corrosive policies producing their own destruction. What arguments have leftists used to accomplish this? Chiefly, though not exclusively, they have employed a trifecta of completely nonsensical tropes about race, gender, and climate.\n\nClimate Change Alarmist Al Gore Declares War on Fossil Fuel Industry. Climate change alarmist and former United States Vice President Al Gore has blasted the fossil fuel industry, accusing oil and gas companies of \"using the atmosphere as an open sewer.\" Mr. Gore, whose climate rants have grown progressively more unhinged, said this week that fossil fuel companies are \"digging and drilling and pumping up the fossilized remains of dead animals and plants and burning them in ways that use the atmosphere as an open sewer, threatening the future of humanity.\"\n\nBoston's mayor declares 'heat emergency' for high-80s summer day. The reputation of \"politician\" precedes any civil servant, so right off the bat, I hold a less-than-flattering bias against those entering government (to put it mildly); it's a \"guilty until proven innocent\" prejudice, but I will say, it's evenly applied. Then last week, Michelle Wu, Boston's hardcore leftist mayor, opened her big mouth and showed (again) just how right on the money one can be when you operate under the assumption that ineptitude and uselessness are shared traits amongst elected officials. On September 7th, Wu declared a \"heat emergency\" saying temperatures were expected to reach into the... ready for this? The nineties. (Turns out, Thursday the 7th peaked at 89°F and Friday reached 88°F.)\n\n'Experts' swear the world is on the brink of disaster — again. Weather forecasters have trouble predicting weather accurately a few days out, yet we are supposed to believe they can predict the climate 100 years out within a degree if we just cave to the radical green pushers and surrender all our liberties. Does that make any sense?\n\nDemocrats' 2024 Magic Bullet: Mass Mail-In Voting. Put it together and Biden's road to 270 electoral votes is paved on reusing the 2020 COVID playbook. Hence the recent ramp-up in COVID panic, once again ushering in debates regarding school closings, masking and, ultimately, more sweeping changes to the country's election systems. Even the most doe-eyed twentysomething Biden White House staffer must realize that the full-on lockdowns of the early pandemic are not coming back. However, a new COVID variant gives left-wing activists justification to usher in mass mail-in balloting once again — you know, for \"safety\" reasons. After all, you don't want grandma to die, do you?\n\nIf it Saves One Life and Other Meretricious Lies. It's not unusual that power-mad politicians justify depriving us of liberty using the appeal to emotion: \"If it saves one life.\" Former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo justified the statewide shutdown with this poppycock: \"And if everything we do saves just one life, I'll be happy.\" Former president Obama said \"If we save even one life from gun violence, it's worth it.\" Then vice president Joe Biden endorsed that: \"As the President said, if your actions result in only saving one life, they're worth taking.\" This is not justifiable constitutionally any more than it is factually: These actions often cost far more lives than the theoretical one life saved. Everything in life is a tradeoff.\n\nRed-state university demands faculty 'accept and encourage change for the greater good'. As always throughout history, \"for the greater good\" go individual rights and the notions of natural law... and freedom. \"For the greater good\" means that if you are in the minority (of anything), you are likely screwed. And, as individuals, we are all a \"minority of one,\" the ultimate minority. So do you like your home? Sorry, it's in the way of plans for a community center/public park/bike path. You've gotta give it up for the greater good. Wanna keep your hunting rifle? That's as may be, but we in government think it presents a hazard to many other people, so hand it over. Fond of your burger, your gas stove, your gas car, your gas lawnmower? Too bad, you can't have them... because we say they are bad for the climate. The greater good, you know. Are you refusing to comply with a stranger's demands that you address him by his preferred pronouns? Have you expressed support for J.K. Rowling or Jason Aldean on social media? Are you a \"MAGA\" supporter who is planning to vote for Donald Trump in the upcoming presidential election? So sorry, but we can't allow that. You must be ostracized, punished, or canceled (one way or another) for the greater good.\n\nUsing the Dictator's — and the Mafia's — Playbook. During President Trump's presidency, the Dems, leftists, and other anti-Americans screamed that he was going to \"destroy Democracy.\" Daily we heard warnings about authoritarianism (imposed by Trump), voter suppression (executed by Trump), how he was going to throw Hillary in jail and investigate Biden (his rival). It turns out that Joe Biden and his Dems are everything, and more, of the authoritarians, vote suppressors, and witch-hunters they accused Trump (and his followers) of being. Then again, projection has long been a character trait of totalitarians — accuse others of what you're doing or planning on doing.\n\nSelf-Involved NASA Climate Scientist Complains about \"Climate Grief\". I would like to introduce you to Dr. Kimberley R. Miner, a Climate Scientist at the NASA Jet Propulsion Lab in Pasadena, California, and a Climate Change Institute Research Assistant Professor. She is also a Fellow at the Center for Climate and Security in DC and Co-chair of the NASA Interagency Forum on Climate Change Risks, Impacts, and Adaptation. Given those credentials, you might expect an editorial she prepared for a leading science publication would be a sober, serious analysis of the data related to the Earth's atmosphere, oceanic currents, or geologic history. You would be wrong. In Nature, Miner wrote a histrionic, emotion-laden diatribe about \"climate grief.\"\n\nKimberley Miner: 'I'm a NASA Climate Scientist. Here's How I'm Handling Climate Grief'. NASA climate scientist Kimberly Miner of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory & University of Maine: \"I am in my mid-thirties, working at NASA as a scientist, and I already have five scientist friends with severe, emergent health challenges. They are all affected by overwork, exhaustion and extreme stress.\" \"The best treatment for climate grief, he says, is knowing you've made a contribution to reducing emissions or building resilience.\"\n\nIn California This Weekend, We Saw, Again, How Easy It Is to Panic Americans. I am writing this column on a beautiful sunny day in Southern California. It is a Monday in mid-August, so it is not a national holiday, yet in Los Angeles County, where I live, all the schools and all government offices are closed. Why? Because, for the past week, the National Weather Service, state and local authorities, and national and local media have been ceaselessly warning that a tropical storm would hit Southern California on Sunday night and Monday with a \"life-threatening\" intensity not seen since the last tropical storm hit California in 1939, 84 years ago. [...] Unlike the invisible COVID-19 virus, the reason for panic this time was completely visible. All these people needed to do was walk outside of their home or hotel — or just look out the window. Had they done so, they would have seen that steady but moderate rain was falling. Just rain. No high winds, no downpour, no storm, not even thunder or lightning.\n\nIs This The Most Asinine Sentence Ever Written About 'Climate Change'? In reporting on a Montana case in which a judge ruled that the state had to include the climate effect of oil and gas permits before deciding on them, the Associated Press showed just how brain-dead the discussions of \"global warming\" have become. District Court Judge Kathy Seeley ruled in favor of several young plaintiffs — ranging in age from 5 to 22 — saying they \"have a fundamental constitutional right to a clean and healthful environment, which includes climate as part of the environmental-support system.\" [...] The ruling was heralded by the likes of Julia Olson, executive director of the Oregon-based Our Children's Trust, which has filed similar lawsuits in other states, who said: \"Today's ruling in Montana is a game-changer that marks a turning point in this generation's efforts to save the planet from the devastating effects of human-caused climate chaos.\" (Apparently, after \"global warming,\" and \"climate change,\" and \"climate crisis\" failed to move the needle, the left is trying out \"climate chaos.\")\n\nDemocrats' proposed wealth tax spells doom for entrepreneurs and economic growth. A group of far-left lawmakers has introduced yet another bill to soak the rich. The new bill is called the Oppose Limitless Inequality Growth and Reverse Community Harms Act — the OLIGARCH Act, get it? It would introduce an entirely new tax on wealth above $120 million, starting at 2% and climbing to 8%. This new tax would be in addition to the income tax. Rep. Barbara Lee (D-CA) claims the legislation is designed to \"tax extreme wealth, reduce inequality, and combat the threat to democracy posed by aristocracy.\"\n\n\"Global Boiling\": An Assault On Reason and Science. An interesting and troubling double standard is applied to the acceptability of individual actions and those of political agents. An individual declaring an emergency when none exists, e.g., shouting \"fire\" in a crowded cinema, would lead to rightful punishment, yet public officials can do so without attracting the same scrutiny. According to United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres, \"the era of global warming has ended\" and \"the era of global boiling has arrived.\" Of course, this statement was made with little or no sense of perspective or the possibility that any sensible human would challenge or refute it. This comment is the latest reference relating to what is and has been going on with the weather and climate. After the warming showed a slowdown; climate change became the operative term, but this was found to be insufficiently alarming. In turn, climate action became the necessary antidote to a \"climate emergency\" or \"climate crisis.\" Having gone full circle, with the focus back to the fetish with high temperatures during a seasonal, localized and predictable heatwave, the assertion is that we are in the midst of climate boiling.\n\nNancy Pelosi says the U.S. will come to an End if Trump is re-elected. Nancy Pelosi thinks that the U.S. is doomed if Donald Trump becomes president again and says the latest indictment of the ex-President stands the best chance of getting him into prison rather than the White House. The former House Speaker launched the war of words with Trump after claiming he looked like a 'scared puppy' during his D.C. court appearance on Thursday. She also called the third and latest indictment against Trump 'beautiful' and said he knows he is going to have to face the music for trying to overturn the 2020 election results.\n\nGlobal boiling? Don't be ridiculous. And just like that we've entered a new epoch. 'The era of global warming has ended, the era of global boiling has arrived', decreed UN chief António Guterres last week. It's hard to know what's worse: the hubris and arrogance of this globalist official who imagines he has the right to declare the start of an entire new age, or the servile compliance of the media elites who lapped up his deranged edict about the coming heat death of Earth. 'Era of global boiling has arrived and it is terrifying', said the front page of the Guardian, as if Guterres's word was gospel, his every utterance a divine truth. We urgently need to throw the waters of reason on this delirious talk of a 'boiling' planet.\n\nDoes it seem as though every news story lately is on climate doom? [Scroll down] [Y]ou've probably also noticed that these days that there isn't a news story that somehow doesn't have a climate connection. That is by design, and not an overwrought term \"conspiracy theory.\" (The ruling class needs to know that it's used that excuse far too many times, but we digress.) What are global cooling, global warming, global boiling, climate change, climate crisis, and now climate emergency? Will it soon be climate calamity, catastrophe, or cataclysm, depending on which sounds scariest and will bring in the most money and votes? The initiative of the Columbia Journalism Review and The Nation, proudly announced four years ago, was entitled \"Covering Climate Now,\" \"Transforming the media's coverage of the climate crisis.\" It quickly amassed more than 170 news outlets from around the world to Rahm this propaganda down our throats. It triumphantly announced that \"Climate Stories Are Everywhere.\"\n\nUN: Don't Call It Global Warming, Call It \"Global Boiling\". When you constantly have to rename and rebrand whatever scam you're pushing this week, it's a scam. Corporations constantly rename certain products to upsell them or make them sound new and exciting. It's not junk anymore, it's e-junk or smart junk, and it's not global warming anymore, it's climate change. No wait, that sounds boring. Let's switch to Global Boiling, that sounds new and exciting.\n\nU.N. Chief Guterres Warns 'Era of Global Boiling' Is Here. Be afraid. Be very, very afraid. United Nations chief Antonio Guterres on Thursday night rolled out some of his most apocalyptic climate rhetoric to date declaring \"the era of global warming has ended, the era of global boiling has arrived.\" He went on to lament how \"terrifying\" it is seeing children \"swept away by monsoon rains, families running from the flames, workers collapsing in scorching heat.\" The veteran Portuguese socialist painted his picture of a world in peril during a streamed speech from U.N. headquarters in New York, returning once more to a theme of climate doom he has used almost without respite since he took office.\n\nThe Left's Latest Trump Freakout — He Wants To Control The Executive Branch! It didn't take long for a New York Times article about Donald Trump's plans to \"increase presidential power in 2025\" for the left to suffer yet another mental breakdown, rushing on the air and in print to call the news \"terrifying,\" \"frightening,\" \"menacing,\" \"incredibly alarming.\" And, of course, \"fascist,\" or as a University of North Carolina professor took to the Atlantic to declare, \"a new kind of fascism.\" What has the left grasping for the Xanax again? Here are the horrifying facts as reported by the Times: Trump — as well as other Republicans running for office — hope to \"increase the president's authority\" over the executive branch of government, including \"independent\" federal agencies. \"He wants to revive the practice of 'impounding' funds, refusing to spend money Congress has appropriated for programs a president doesn't like,\" the Times reports. \"He intends to strip employment protections from tens of thousands of career civil servants, making it easier to replace them if they are deemed obstacles to his agenda.\"\n\nWho wants to read 15 tweets about how the Left uses \"climate change\" as a rhetorical trap? Auron MacIntyre has some thoughts to help us understand the rhetorical tricks the Left uses and why we so often fall for them. [Tweet] We all know the climate agenda is a hoax to gain power, but being reactionary and anti-environment is far from the correct response. [...] The climate changes by definition. Some lefties, the RFK Jr. types, and maybe even the Al Gores of the world, care about the environment. But most are using this as a tool to consolidate power in a totalitarian fashion. I mean, have you read the Green New Deal? [...] Why else would the Left be attaching EVERYTHING to \"Climate Justice\" or \"Environmental Equity\"? It's all about one plan to consolidate power and do so as the \"good guys\" who care about the planet and the poor.\n\nJoin Us in Mocking Ilhan Omar for Saying Earth Broke Heat Record Last Set in 117,977 BC. Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) called for a \"national climate emergency.\" She says the government must take action because the Earth \"broke the record for the hottest day in 120,000 years.\" In other words, Omar thinks the Earth broke a record it last set in 117,977 BC. Except, she does not know that. Daily temperature records do not date back 120 thousand years ago. Omar appears to refer to a flimsy report from a local Florida outlet WFLA-TV that matched her tweet. But even that report admitted it cites a dashboard that dates back to only 1979 and warned data \"should NOT be taken as 'official' observational records.\" Official enough for Omar, the densest of The Squad members, nonetheless.\n\nUnearthed Video Shows Teachers Union President Ranting And Raving On Stage, Calling Students 'Our Babies'. A recently unearthed video shows the head of the largest teachers union wailing on stage during a keynote address, calling students \"our babies.\" During the National Education Association's (NEA) July 3 Representative Assembly, Becky Pringle gave a keynote speech addressing more than 6,000 NEA delegates in Orlando, Florida. Toward the end of her speech, Pringle shouted about the union's \"righteous fight for freedom\" and changing \"the world for our students.\" \"We will never bend,\" Pringle shouted. \"We will never be broken because we are the NEA and we will always do what we must to be worthy of our students. Thank you NEA for all you do every day for our babies and for our colleagues and for your states and for this country. Onward NEA. Onward.\"\n\nThe Brutal Crushing of the Lower 50%. Last week the WEFers held their summer camp in China. More to come, they warned us. More pandemics, more catastrophic global warming, more inflation, hell on wheels, they promise us, Armageddon is coming. Be very afraid. The following was a particularly lovely event: \"How to Stay Within Planetary Boundaries - Carrot or Stick?\" which focused on whether to incentivize or force compliance with \"climate goals\". It was hosted by some joker who edits a magazine called Nature Energy, no doubt funded by the WEF and read by exactly nobody.\n\nThe Assault on Our Rights is Not Sustainable. The Left is big on de-escalation of conflict. They insist on talk rather than action to address rioting, theft, and even violent assault. The one place where they will not use it is in politics. De-escalation of political conflict would require them to do something they are loath to — debate ideas. The left is instead attacking our right to speech. Try disagreeing with any element of leftist orthodoxy and see what happens. Challenging any of their core positions will not be met with robust debate, but with insults, cancellation, and even physical attack. Challenge them on:\n\n• Climate change — you're a denier.\n\n• Trans grooming of children — you're a homophobe.\n\n• Affirmative action — you're a racist.\n\n• Abortion — you're anti-human rights.\n\n• 2020 election — you're part of the big lie.\n\nThe Left insists that words can be a form of assault. That's a silly assertion that one's opinion is somehow harmful to others. However, they use that claim as justification for \"cancellation,\" which really is an attack on the well-being of others.\n\nMessaging vs. reality: Democrats leave ordinary Americans behind. A car in front of me recently at a traffic light had a political sticker on its rear bumper that read, \"Leave no one behind — vote Democrat.\" The message isn't new, and I've seen the sticker before, but I found it freshly notable because it has surely never been more obviously false than it is today. It expressed the quintessence of the party's message that Democrats are for the masses, the millions of little guys, rather than the big guys who have too much power already.\n\nIf You Think All Teachers Are 'Heroes,' You're Part Of The Problem. Many factors have contributed to the downfall of America's schools. One rarely discussed issue is the disproportionate praise heaped on the teaching industry, which has led teachers to believe the scope of their influence ought to extend beyond the teaching of facts and figures. As a society, we have praised teachers to the extent that even mild criticism of the profession is met with a chorus of boos. \"My sister is a teacher!\" When discussing widespread problems in the profession, instead of presenting an actual argument, those who reflexively defend the industry will often mention having friends or relatives who are teachers, as if this anecdotal tidbit is a meaningful response. \"Teachers are heroes\" is practically an infallible dictum. It is unclear why teachers,"
