Inspired by the ancient Sufi tradition, the band's music and lyrics reflect the moderate, liberal side of Islam. This program follows Salman Ahmed as he journeys to the tolerant, ancient city of Lahore and the fundamentalist stronghold of Peshawar to reveal the internal religious and political conflicts of nuclear-armed Pakistan."
