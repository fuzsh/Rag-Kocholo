For five years, Cartoon Bar Fight has gone through lineup changes, with only two of the founding members left: Kendall Sallay and Dirk Milotz. Despite the instability, they’ve mastered a few songs along the way. Following their release of their debut EP, Tell All The Children, almost exactly last year to date ( Nov. 18th), the San Jose band presents a full album showcasing songs they have long waited to present. Beautiful, haunting melodies create a surreal, peaceful mood on CBF’s Reincarnate. Starting fresh after a previous life seems to be the theme for CBF, from their original formation to now. In a sense they have reincarnated themselves in the process of releasing this album. The album starts with an eerie organ-like movement, “A Beautiful Death” (the same title as the album artwork by Terry Fan), and into “Dear Victoria,” a solemn song almost styled as a shanty. “Circus” continues in the same vein with a cry for change as the ending chant repeats the lyrics “I sleep too often, when will I awake?” and “I know I’ve fallen away.” The title track, “Reincarnate,” helps close the album with much more hopeful lyrics for life and change as heard in the chorus, “in life and death, disappear, change your shape, reappear, reincarnate” before the final song “A Beautiful Life.” The album really shows a much darker and reflective side of CBF not present in Tell All The Children, with more musical development, instrumentation depth and richness to their songs.

Preferred, they work with historically charged sites to which they respond with transmedia interventions. Their works are digitals systems that interfere with the analog status quo via image and sound applications. They generate data systems that control audiovisual projections which are applied in real-time to a chosen environment. Their transmedia compositions are based on dialogic principles ranging from between the two artists, between to two spheres “audio” and “visual”, between analog and digital architecture, between light and sound waves, between the material and immaterial dimension. In their research on a site, they cover architectural concepts and structures, emblematic qualities and acoustic patterns. They ponder on function and use, history and memory, experiences and associations as well as culture-historical, scientific or theoretical aspects. The process of exploring and developing constantly shifts between concrete and universal, specific and fundamental, practice and theory. They collect and sort, reflect and experiment with their finding to develop a semantic map that serves as the foundation of their compositions. In the development process, joeressen+kessner focus on the transition of how coding content leads to a character, on how the hosting medium influences the appearance and on how space and time alter a digital figuration – in general as well as on the site in particular. They consider a character an abstract unit where a formative framework and associated meaning, significance and representation are in constant, reciprocal negotiation. They develop set of characters as an artistic system that allows expression, that can be read as a language, and that allow hosting knowledge in a new way. Their works come as digital character sets that drive image and sound projections that interfere with the appearance of the space. Their encodings instruct self-organizing processes, and these develop as autonomous patterns in which the intentional and the non-intentional engender a performative play. This leads to rhizome of influences that are too complex to be fully analyzed and which can only be understood by extended observation of the interaction. The unpredictable part of this approach links to them to artistic approaches based on generative processing but to ensure their artistic autonomy, joeressen+kessner work without pre-programmed standards as well as without any form of presets and plug-ins. They form a network of interconnected paths and tracks which overlap each other and branch out repeatedly as a real-time environment. Unlike image systems as known from film, video, and animation which are generated separately, illuminated, reckoned, reworked and cut before they are broadcasted, real-time processing is a high performative system in which rendering and display coincide and which reinvent itself while performing. By coding open systems, a continuous change between analysis, instruction, and expression takes place. The traditional separation between development, production, and performance is abolished and notation, recording, and display are modulated in real time. Complexity, incomprehensibility, and incompleteness are part of this kind of artistic research. The formatting of these processes is the composition process of joeressen+kessner. The implementation of the digital dimension in an analog space via projection allows to disintegrate found settings and limitations and permits a redesign of references, reference sets, and reference qualities. The physical space with its architectural, spatial and temporal ratios turns into a media system. Light as primary media of the analog sphere and as the media of display of the digital sphere serves as the interface and permits the linkage. With their transmedia interventions, joeressen+kessner further a development that altered the canon of fine arts in the middle of the 20th century. The first electronic-spatial environment that combines architecture, film, light, and music into a fusion of space and time is the Philips-Pavilion, that was realized 1958 in Brussels. The artistic direction was at Le Corbusier in co-operation with Iannis Xenakis and Edgard Varèse. Compositions of acoustic space and architecture, light behavior and image generation, aesthetic qualities and perception properties and digital technologies led to a new synthesis. Golo Föllmer describes the Philips Pavilion: “Two tape compositions were created for this: “Poème électronique” by Edgard Varèse which aimed at an intensive fusion of space and sound experience. The used synthetic and concrete sounds were shown to Le Corbusier ‘s film or light projection with the help of elaborate loudspeaker technology as lines and volumes in the space.” In the 21st century, the transmedia interplay was expanded by generative data systems by artists like joeressen+kessner. Since 2001, Eva-Maria Joeressen and Klaus Kessner have been working together developing transmedia compositions as spatial interventions. Both are professional artists since the 1980s and both are active teachers: Klaus Kessner has been visiting lecturer at University of Applied Sciences Duesseldorf and the Peter-Behrens-School of Arts and Eva-Maria Joeressen holds a professorship at the Peter-Behrens-School of Arts in Duesseldorf. In addition, she is involved in the German “Light in Fine Arts (LIFA)” – network to strengthen research and discourse on light in fine arts in higher educations.

The second Assembly Series of the next 5 cities begins with Phnom Penh (2017), and will offer all participants a fresh look of South East Asia. The new Phnom Penh Masterplan (since 1954) presents much opportunity for commerce and economic revitalisation. Formerly the Paris of the East, the city has previously degenerated into the dark ages of civil war, political unrest and revolution, literally wiping out much of it's Indochina legacy. Nonetheless, there is a resurgence in optimism and enterprise, judging by the new gleaming and still climbing residential towers on Diamond Island, new airport terminal, road improvements and more. Phnom Penh still has it's fair share of bullet scarred art deco buildings, old markets and heritage districts. Phnom Penh is not a sprawling metropolis, it is easy to orientate and has a compact low-rise/high-density urban plan. Somehow, it's intersections, roundabouts and arterial road system conjure up a tight urban fabric - creating a very balanced scale. It is a city to be experienced at the human scale, it is safer than western cities at night and it is definitely Rising!

But last night, the Tower was lit for another kind of win: A student team was crowned champion of a global supercomputing competition. Team Texas took home the top prize at the 8th-annual Student Cluster Competition at the Supercomputing Conference in Denver. The 72-hour battle requires students to build, optimize, and run the most efficient predesigned cluster computing system, along with a couple surprise assignments, all with a strict power budget. Teams are then awarded points based on workload completion, benchmark performance, conference attendance, and interviews. Junior biology major Eric Dawson was one of six student members of Team Texas, along with Jim Given, Reid McKenzie, Julian Michael, Suvamsh Shivaprasad, and Zachary Tschirchart. The team also includes three coaches from the Texas Advanced Computing Center and two former team members who acted as student advisors. “The Supercomputing Conference is a collection of industries, academics, and research coming together to share ideas for high-performance computing,” Dawson says. “The competition is friendly. Everyone shows up with blood in their eyes, but by the end of the week we got to know the other eight teams.” The teams worked constantly during the three-day competition, apart from taking occasional naps on the exhibit floor. But fatigue didn’t stop the Texas Team from reveling in its win. UT’s team walked away winners for the second year in a row, with a score of 67 points, 11 higher than second place. “It’s cool to show that UT has a strong HPC program and it’s not just a fluke or super team,” Dawson says. “We’ll see about next year. I think we have Xs on our backs now.” Next year’s Supercomputing Competition will be held in New Orleans. But until then, Dawson is still enjoying this year’s win. “Turning the Tower orange is a crowning thing I’ve wanted to do since I got to UT,” Dawson says. “I got lots of pictures with my horns up in front of it.” Photo courtesy Faith Singer-Villalobos.

Especially in this day when so much is being made available online, but that really is just a matter of scale when there are plenty of historical examples of similar things, such as Aleister Crowley revealing the initiatory rituals of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn as serialized in the pages of the Equinox, the varied publication and exposé of so much Freemasonic ritual, and so forth. There are still some pretty legitimately secret societies, which while well-known to exist are not revealed, such as the Skull and Bones society, and recently breaking the Copiale cipher seemed to tantalizingly promise that there might be still some complex and completely unknown societies, at least until it was revealed the material was pretty clearly Freemasonic in nature. But for the most part, I object that when people talk about secret societies they are engaged in flights of fancy about group about which not only their existence but much of their particulars are known. Quite often, of course, such wild imaginings are part and parcel with an agenda of fear mongering, but even still there are otherwise sane and rational people talking about certain societies as if they were actually not completely or almost completely public. Certainly Freemasonic tradition and ritual cannot rationally be called secret anymore, and the membership is in the habit of parading around, not to mention things like having decals on their cars and fobs on their keychains, and thus it cannot be called a secret society. Even traditional boogeymen like Aleister Crowley and Ordo Templi Orientis can only by the slimmest margin come anywhere near being called a secret society, with websites, public spaces, public event calendars, and so forth. There may indeed be legitimately unavailable secrets still, for example within A∴A∴, but that’s not enough to call these fraternal orders by the name of a secret society. In these cases there’s perhaps some legitimate secrets, but there must also be a practical recognition that most material related to these groups is available, outside the structured system of the society itself, somewhere, if one wants to find it. Of course, just as much as one can avoid spoilers for movies and books and other things sequentially revealed, it is possible to avoid, for the most part, much of that material. It is not that there are no spoilers. Rather that spoilers do very much exist. Which is to say, the existence of spoilers requires one to decide to avoid the spoilers in order to fully enjoy the reveal. This is quite different from a society that pretends it doesn’t exist to outsiders, or a known society with things that it keeps secret. There are modern examples of working with secrets within esoteric systems, and there’s clearly something interesting going on around secrets. There is smoke pointing to something important and useful at the source. There’s a tension, perhaps much as it ever was, between the urge to make information available and the various efficacies of secrets. T Thorn Coyle wrote a bit about the division in Feri between what had been called the “Mystery tradition” and the “public religion” factions, at “The Sundering of Feri“. Thorn, of course, also runs an online Mystery School. I was trying to find a quote where I recall her saying something about how paganism needed to have a Mystery tradition as part of it, but can’t find that right now. Generally, when I talk about such things to people who ask, I suggest that initiation ritual, especially, is like a good book or movie with a savoury plot twist or two. You will only ever get a single chance to experience the participatory drama without knowing how it develops; that’s if one goes through it the first time not having read the materials. One and only one chance. Ever. So why throw that away by reading ahead? One can always read the materials afterward, as many times as one likes; but to read the spoilers is to waste a wonderful opportunity that cannot ever, barring soap opera amnesia tropes, be experienced once the reveal has been spoiled. Whether one “gets” it or not (either initially or on subsequent viewings of a ritual or readings, of material) is another question entirely. And, it seems to me, in my experience, what constitutes “getting it” will likely evolve and change over time no matter what else is a consideration. When given the opportunity, I like to point out that one can go to many stagings of a play by Shakespeare and get new things, new depth of understanding and new enjoyment, as well as savour slightly different interpretations, so to me the re-play value depth of meaning of a work or body of work is something that is a different question to the idea of seeing something for the first time without spoilers. But, still, people freak about things unknown, and try to minimize and control things by figuring things out ahead instead of being comfortable with being uncomfortable as a thing itself. Seems to me the still prevalent modern desire to conquer Nature and the pervaisive post-modern existential nausea about information overload and slavish ‘inbox zero’ mania are examples, perhaps symptoms, of where the ability to just relax about not knowing, not being in control, would be useful for people to practice in specific so they can have skill in applying it in general. Another aspect that always comes up around secrets is the idea that somehow no matter what is revealed, the real secrets are impervious to such petty concerns. Seems to me blather about mystery being unspoilable is semantically empty jazz hands (or worse self deception (or worse-worse deception of others) about “spiritual” exceptionalism), and misses the point of initiation as orchestrated stressful situation intended to create a kind of imprint vulnerability, an altered state, in the initiate, and attempts to diffuse that stress and that experience before experiencing it is an attempt mitigate and in some form to not have the experience at all. The efficacy of secrets in a system are not just about the information, true, but the information is interwoven into an experience, and the experience is changed by the quality and obscurity of the information on which the experience is built. If one knows the rollercoaster has a blind drop at the end, one still experiences the drop in and of itself, but the surprise in and of itself is changed into anticipation, and that’s a different thing entirely which not only changes the experience of the drop but distracts from the experience of what occurs before. For me, when I talk about “reading ahead” (spoiling) I mean that as a placeholder for activity the diffuses the effectiveness of initiation and mystery, whether written down and read or spoken and heard or whatever and whatevered. For me, being a candidate in initiation and mystery is to be an improv actor stumbling into a rehearsed stage play, and both savoury and exciting. One tends to think all kinds of things about structure and likely scenarios, if nothing else than a rite of passage (exit normal, experience liminal, re-enter normal changed) but it is the actuality, specifics and plot twists, the things that can be spoiled, which I think should be avoided and, yes, allowed as a personal experience. To bring it around, my point of wondering about classification of societies is that there is a kind of society which is not itself attempting to pretend it doesn’t exist, and which has essentially much of its material revealed or potentially could be in future somewhere, but that points out there is a reason not to “read” ahead as a practice of discipline in and of itself; that there is a place for not knowing as a thing, and experience, to be embodied through ritual, especially dramatic ritual like initiation. The trick of improv is to have characters and bits of business prepared and figure out ways to fit those into any circumstances, so perhaps the corollary is to become good at mystery and a good initiate prepared by building the foundation of skills, whatever those are in one’s tradition, that make the personal experience of the unknown richer. If an initiatory working is in some form or another purely ecstatic, then perhaps more than one person will have no prior exposure. That seems quite different than a mystery tradition where something is being revealed. But, whether there is an actual script or not, a mystery tradition will have participants who have experienced or developed a relationship with the mystery who are inducting others. If those others have exposed themselves or been exposed prior to some element meant to be revealed, then they have failed to avoid spoilers, they have whatevered the whatever. Maps certainly won’t always apply, especial when applied outside their intended scope. Just add as given to any structural approach “except where this doesn’t apply”. But, to be clear, there are other structures, but I’m primarily talking about a mystery tradition where something is being revealed. But, whether there is an actual script or not, a mystery tradition will have participants who have experienced or developed a relationship with the mystery who are inducting others. Here the word ‘mystery’ in a religious sense comes from Greek mysterion “secret rite or doctrine,” as in a thing to be revealed to initiates, whether, additionally as previously stated, those are “written down and read or spoken and heard or whatever and whatevered”, a secret doctrine passed on or a secret rite enacted. Which begs the question: without a mystery (neither secret rite or secret doctrine) to be revealed, whither the mystery cult? Further, without a mystery, one might even be tempted to ask how can there actually be an initiation at all? Perhaps, one might say of a modern non-mystery that an “impromptu ecstatic divinatory rite” took place which offered UPG, such that a previously unknown rite is enacted or previously unknown doctrine is developed. But without the secret rite or secret doctrine, which would have to have previously existed to those initiated few inducting others, there’s nothing to pass on that was previously held sacred, no previously held in secret doctrine or rite, tautologically. “Nothing to pass on that was previously held sacred” may offer another name, perhaps more tripping, instead of “society without spoilers”: a “sacred society”, a society with things held sacred as in separate, something bound, enclosed and protected. Unfortunately, one can follow the etymology of ‘secret’ to essentially the same place, the difference being one implies holiness and the other does not, I suppose, which “holiness” seems, to my mind, just a special case of any of the others three terms I suggested. I suspect the apparent failure of the modality of a “mystery cult” in the modern world has to do with modernity, modernism and existentialism, and the lack of acceptance of shared concrete and coherent gnosis, thus the ground on which a modern mystery cult would be built is unsuitable for lavish neo-romantic structures, except for those already conditioned to such things, such as lapsed Catholics and such. Which is to say, perhaps any mystery cult would seem too superficial to a modern person to have the same religious and social impacts, simply because the assumed rich foundation is missing. So, the feeling one might have that a mystery cult or tradition in the modern age has lost its luster is due not to the mystery cult but rather due to the overall modern age. There is still a lingering notion that something may be missing for rootless moderns which a mystery cult can offer by way of a more structured ritual, initiations, and a focused mythic basis for ritual; more robust spiritual meaning which then, in turn, offers deeper experience of life in general. But, I find myself wondering if the project of modern mystery traditions is undermined by a general lack of cultural foundation, those foundations of community and cohesion being so efficiently eroded in our public, political and even private lives. Not to mention the lack of what is still called a “classical education” with the broad base of and relationship of familiarity with languages, myths, archetypes and so on. This, then becomes a chicken and egg, which can only be resolved by realizing the false dichotomy that one must be completed before the other, and that the development in general is aided by development in specific, and visa versa, synergistically. One possible route out of the morass, for moderns and post-moderns, I sometimes come to is the suggestion that situational certainty is a tool for meta-cognition. By this I mean, that the ground on which a mystery cult could be built, the solid ground of structured ritual, initiations, and a focused mythic basis for ritual is sufficient when internally consistent for its purpose and held to be true for the time that it is necessary. But, that threatens what is perhaps an entirely different discussion. But, to bring it back around again, a ‘mystery cult’ is a cult with a mystery. A ‘cult’ is the external activity enacting a religious metaphor, a ritual behaviour. A ‘mystery’ is a secret rite or secret doctrine (to be revealed). Therefore, a ‘mystery cult’ is specifically ritual behaviour that involves a secret rite or secret doctrine. ‘Tradition’ is shared belief or behaviour through time. Therefore, ‘mystery tradition’ is belief and ritual behaviour that involves a secret rite or secret doctrine shared through time. I’m so strongly reminded by this of something. I believe it was something by Karl Kereny (but it might be form Van Gennep or Turner, I can’t recall right now) which I paraphrase: “Ritual enacts Myth and Myth explains Ritual.” It seems possible to conflate a general meaning of “mystery” as more of a kind of ‘gnosis’ or noetic experience with how I understand it is used in the specific sense within the term “mystery cult” which is more what I am talking about here. When speaking of the idea of whether a ‘mystery cult’ within modern systems would be useful in order to ground the work in structured behaviour, I’m assuming that we’re actually talking about ‘mystery cult’ not general unspecific noetic experience or so forth. This of course somewhat ironically points out a possible initial critique of paganism as a generalized, syncretic, eclectic system which lacks the benefit of what a mystery cult offers and hence the possible utility of that structured influence, offering specific external ritual behaviour around a secret rite or secret doctrine. If you want mystery without mystery cult, that already exists in various forms of wild and wishy-washy moments of gnosis within the ecstatic traditions of modern life; but, why not try adding an actual ‘mystery cult’ back into the cultural mix? In fact, I could easily argue that there already is ‘mystery cult’ in various places within neopaganism, with a facile example being initiatory orders like OTO and others, which are perfect examples of mysteries for which spoilers exist and which spoilers therefore can be intentionally avoided. A very salient point for this modern information age is the value an experience of not knowing, so that one can and must do less thinking prior to events, not more. Perhaps the suggestion contained within the experience of not knowing is that one should do one’s thinking after: praxis before theory, so that theory is informed by praxis without prejudice. If this is the case, why not work toward maximizing the possible experience instead of minimizing the probable damage of knowing by seeking after spoilers of any kind, even the mundane accidents surrounding specific quanta and quality? Indeed, I would suggest that one approach an initiatory experience within an mystery tradition not as a result of successful prior thinking or a seal on attainment, like we are so often familiar with from diplomas, certificates and honors; but an invitation to view the world through a particular lens for a particular period of time, determined by the particulars of the ritual and tradition in which the initiation takes place. In other words, the initiation is really the beginning, suggested by the word itself, of an pervasive life experience. The full experience of a mystery event intended to involve surprises, plot twists or situations unknown can be self-evidently spoiled by prior knowledge of those circumstances. Especially if part of the trigger for the full experience is the stress of not knowing. Certainly, I don’t mean that these things are binary (and it may be possible to salvage some part of the experience even if spoiled, but why not go for the whole thing instead of the tatters?), but that avoiding spoilers is a discipline that seems worthy if one is serious about that experience, and looking to have it be as rich as possible. And, that this, in specific, will inform one’s general life as well. And yes, one can point out that for completely ecstatic visceral events and such that are not within a mystery tradition, there’s mostly nothing to spoil by prior knowledge, per se. Except that maybe even still, for example, having that ecstatic visceral experience is based on a not knowing, in some fashion; for example, there’s only one time for the first such experience. All subsequent such experiences are informed by prior such similar events; but also, there may be circumstances around how the experience is induced that involve some fashion of not-knowing the mechanisms being used, which after the initial experience become less effective in themselves and experienced practitioners then rely on other means more, such as anchoring past experience to ease induction subsequently. Also, for purely personal experience based on involvement in a mystery cultic practice, the former requires the latter, so saying the former can’t be spoiled is only true on the former level but it’s a logical typing fallacy to presume that spoiling the more primary function of mystery cultic practice can’t spoil the dependent personal experience of it. Mystery rituals are built around some kind of surprise, a revealing of the secret practice or doctrine at least. One could try to criticize the practices of mystery traditions by bringing up features of non-surprise ritual is not a feature of surprise ritual merely because they participate in the prior category of ritual. But, still the one is not the other. Noetic mystery is not mystery cult merely because the English word mystery is in both. But these are mostly different topics than suggesting the efficacy a mystery cult with structured ritual behaviour involving a secret doctrine or secret rite to a previous practice of generalized, syncretic, eclectic practice. So, for my own part, I have come to prefer the discipline of having structured ritual events with their reveals unspoiled so that I can experience them with as little prior knowledge as possible, because it’s the only time I will ever get that experience in that way, ever. Of course, you go about your experiences however you like, but I suspect if the initial spoiler free experience is not preserved you’re not actually experiencing ‘mystery cult’ anymore, but rather just, one might say, an extended re-enactment of a transcript of someone else’s dramatized experience. And, if you want that, just watch reruns of some reality television program, or another, instead.

Somehow, it had found its way to the other side of the room. That wasn’t good because, now that he had caught sight of it, he wanted it. No, he needed it, and he needed it now. For most youngsters his age, this would not have been a problem. It would have been a simple matter to take a few steps and grab that blankie up, but most 16-month-olds have been walking for ages. Benny, though, refused to yield to that tradition. In reality, on more than one occasion, he had been spotted taking a step or two, but only when he was alone, and as if to deny it ever happened, had dropped to his knees as soon as he realized he was being watched. His resistance to walking was so complete that if someone tried to make him stand up, he would hold his legs straight out in front of him as if he were sitting on the floor, making him look like Aladdin on an invisible flying carpet. At any rate, for an experienced crawler like Benny, getting to his blankie wouldn’t normally be a problem, but the activity surrounding him had been escalating over the past hour and could legitimately be described as chaotic. He unconsciously flexed his dimpled fingers, remembering the weight of Laura’s foot tromping on them as she pranced into the room earlier. After that, Benny had found a secluded place to play at the end of the couch. He leaned against it now, his gaze intent on the precious blankie which seemed to be calling his name. Though not anxious to enter the fray, his need was strong. He began to lower himself to the floor, then stopped. Amid the swirling forest of legs and bodies, Joy was hopping toward him. Benny’s eyes widened in alarm. Only half an hour ago Joy had decided he would make a fine pony and had plopped herself down on his back as he was crawling toward the toy-box. Now, seeing her heading his way, he pulled himself back up against the couch. Shaking his head, he pointed and waved one arm towards her, declaring, “No! Go!” Benny didn’t like being Joy’s pony. But he did need his blankie. His consternation produced a bit of drool that momentarily perched on his lip, then reluctantly slid down and was gone. With it went his distraction. Once more, his eyes found the spot of blue. Once more, he knelt down, and this time he moved out… closer, then closer. “Unh!” Bump! Thump! “Ow!” “Oops! Are you okay? I didn’t see you down there!” Ronnie was six, and big enough to lift Benny up and give him a comforting hug. Tender-hearted Ronnie hadn’t meant to hurt him, but when all was said and done, Benny was back against the couch and his little blue blankie was still across the room. If ever a little one looked like he could use a cuddle with his blankie, it was Benny. Tears welled up in those blue eyes, his lip quivered, and his body sagged against the couch. But then he grew still, as if fighting an internal battle. For the next few minutes, more than one emotion flitted across his face. When at last he blinked, his expression was transformed. A junior-sized portion of resolve and determination were etched into his baby face. His eyes darted around the room then settled on his blankie. With quickened breath, he stood up tall and moved one foot forward. The other one followed, hesitantly, and both arms worked to keep his balance. Then again… five, nine, fifteen… each step deliberate. Within seconds, the cherished prize was clutched in his hands, and with those steps, Benny had become the victor, in more ways than he knew.

This way of thinking is frequently ascribed to women under the title of so-called \"female intuition,\" and now, researchers suggest this could have a biological influence, rooted in lower prenatal exposure to testosterone in the womb. The researchers, from the University of Granada, the Barcelona Pompeu Fabra University - both in Spain - and the Middlesex University of London in the UK, publish their study in the journalPsychoneuroendocrinology. They note that previous studies have suggested prenatal exposure to testosteroneinfluences developments in the brain, which determine behaviors and tendencies throughout an individual's life. For example, researchers have suggested that higher testosterone exposure in the womb for males influences them to take more risks than females. Contrary to intuitive thought, reflexive thought takes greater cognitive effort and conscious analysis. But both thought processes can be useful in different contexts; for example, in some situations, allowing intuition to guide choices may be better than stopping to think, the team says. To investigate the relationship between testosterone exposure and thought processes, the researchers carried out a study on more than 600 students from the University of Granada Faculty of Economics and Studies. Digital ratio determines testosterone exposure Results of their study show that men did better on the CRT test than women. However, women who showed a more \"masculine\" digital ratio answered equally as well as the men. Image credit: Antonio M. Espin, et al. The team used what is now a widely studied and accepted marker for prenatal testosterone exposure, called the second-to-fourth digit ratio, which is determined by dividing the length of the forefinger by the length of the ring finger on the same hand. Lead author Antonio Manuel Espin, lecturer at the University of Granada, explains: \"The lower the ratio, the greater the prenatal testosterone received and, therefore, the more 'masculine' the cerebral disposition, regardless of the person's gender.\" He adds that, compared with women, men naturally have a lower average digital ratio. Study participants responded to several questionnaires, one of which contained the cognitive reflection test (CRT). This test is designed to measure the ability to override an incorrect intuitive response and further reflect, leading to the correct answer. In short, the test measures the difference between intuition and reflection, and in order to get the right answer, subjects must stop, reflect and recognize that the first answer to jump into his or her head was incorrect. After administering the tests, the team measured the participants' hands so they could calculate their digital ratio. Women with more 'masculine' digital ratio did as well as men on CRT test \"What is most important here,\" says Espin, \"is that women tend to give more intuitive answers, whilst men respond in a more reflexive way. In other words, in this specific test, which penalizes intuitive thought, men generally do better than women.\" Results of their study show that - predictably - men did better on the CRT test than women. However, women who showed a more \"masculine\" digital ratio answered equally as well as the men. Espin says: \"To be more specific, what we found was an indication that prenatal exposure to testosterone predisposes people to adopt a more reflexive and less intuitive mindset. Furthermore, this effect seems to be stronger among women.\" Though interesting, it is important to note that the study does have some limitations. The research team admits that \"trying to pin down differences in the CRT answers to one single factor, prenatal testosterone/estrogens ratio, is simplistic.\" They add that this simplicity could lead to \"conflicting, erratic or inconclusive results.\" Still, the researchers say their findings should prompt future controlled experiments to investigate why individuals exposed to larger amounts of testosterone in the womb \"offer better, more reasoned, solutions in the CRT 20 years after the fact.\" Medical News Today recently reported on a study that suggested pain reduces sex drive in women, but not in men.

In the BC3 category, two-time Paralympian McCowan had finished second in his pool which meant that in the semi-final he was pitted against his brother Jamie who had topped his. In a tight match, Scott edged out his younger brother, winning 4-3 and setting up a Scotland v England final against Matt Berry. Berry had recently taken the silver medal at the Boccia England Cup in Sheffield in May and was hoping to take home a different colour this time. However, even though he forced a tie-break, it was the more experienced Scott McCowan who claimed gold, giving his father Gary, who is his ramp assistant, the perfect Fathers’ Day present. It was Scotland v England again in both medal matches in the BC4 category. Scotland’s Stephen McGuire beat England’s Louis Saunders 7-2 in the Gold medal match, maintaining his 100% record in these championships. The battle for bronze also went Scotland’s way with Ross Munro beating Evie Edwards 6-3. However, the standings were reversed in the BC1 category with reigning World and Paralympic Champion David Smith MBE in commanding form, winning his semi-final 11-0 against fellow English player Dan Bentley, a score which he repeated in the final against Scotland’s Reegan Stevenson. In the all-England bronze medal match, it was Daniel Wain who came out on top, beating Dan Bentley 6-4. But it was Northern Ireland’s Claire Taggart who got the biggest cheer from the home crowd when she beat England’s James Clowes 4-0 in the Gold medal match. The home crowd were also hoping that their countryman Scott Cromie could also bag a medal in the bronze medal match but it wasn’t to be as England’s Reshad Saraj finished on top 3-2. Commenting on the event and the results, Boccia UK Performance Director Helen Nicholls said: ”We have seen some outstanding Boccia played here this weekend and I’ve been really impressed with the performances and the attitude of all the players. Playing against the world ranked players has been a great experience for the pathway players and they have shown that they are pushing hard to improve. With just over a year to go to Tokyo, being tested on home soil is great for the World Class Programme athletes too. “The Championships were played in a great spirit so a huge thank you to the volunteers and Disability Sport Northern Ireland for all their hard work in making it such a success and enjoyable weekend.” The championships were hosted by Disability Sport Northern Ireland (DSNI) were sponsored by Antrim and Newtownabbey Borough Council and TBC Conversions.

I guess JF invested similar trust in me on this, All Fools' Day. The weather was bright, following some heavy overnight rain; the forecast was for a typical April day of sunshine and showers. As I arrived in the village, JF's car was in evidence outside of our agreed meeting point. ALL SAINTS, CHITTERNE At a quick glance looks medieval. However you quickly spot how wrong it looks because it is a Victorian building on a new site, replacing two medieval churches at either end of the village, St Mary to the west and All Saints to the east. Wrong, the west doorway into the tower and no porch, wrong the regular appearance of walls and stonework (flint and rubble chequer pattern), and very wrong the churchyard, a grassed garden without a single tombstone. The architect was T H Wyatt, the Salisbury diocesan architect, who brutally restored many Wiltshire churches, and designed a few exceptional churches and many very ordinary dull churches. All Saints is somewhere in between, supposed to fool, large and spacious but not quite first rate. The chancel has an east apse, the windows rather small, and probably the weakest part of the design. From the other churches several monuments are gathered under the tower, the best unfortunately skied making enjoyment difficult of the intricate naval battle scene. The font came from St Mary, Norman circular, the cover from All Saints C17 octagonal. The low stone screens to the chancel are dissimilar and incorporate medieval tracery from St Mary. The pulpit is Jacobean also from St Mary and the stalls incorporate C17 carved panels, two with birds and foliage and the other two with figures (Moses and possibly Faith). The epitaph to Robert Michell d1779 records how he was most miraculous preserv'd when ten chimneys fell onto his bed in Lincoln's Inn at 6am in the morning leaving him exposed (!) during the Violent Storm of Wind on 2nd December 1763. [Open] The original All Saints has disappeared but ST MARY, CHITTERNE Survives in part, that part being the chancel. Not a great deal to see, but the south windows are rather pretty, depressed two light Perp windows in a square headed frame. Inside the north window incorporates the ogee canopy arch of a former tomb, arranged thus probably by Wyatt. There was an uncommon gravestone in the churchyard of 1850, to a husband a wife with two carved hands one pointing to the left and the other to the right. Also a line of music is incised on the stone. [open] Leaving Chitterne we espied a large modern-looking village not on the map. When it was built there was a flurry of enquiries to local estate agents from people wanting to live there. It is in fact a replica East German village, built for training purposes for the British army who occupy large tracts of Salisbury Plain for military manoeuvres! ST THOMAS A BECKET, TILSHEAD has appeared on the ChurchCrawling group before when Mr Neil and I tried to get inside unsuccessfully a few years back. Today it was open, which it is apparently during British Summertime months. The long low church is grouped around a central tower and is of some antiquity. Inside Norman arcades with the plainest semi-circular arches, but it all seems a little too regular for me and I wonder how much of this is early Wyatt work who restored the church in 1845-6. The clerestory of quatrefoils is probably his work to and the roofs definitely are by him. We wondered what had happened to the cleaner, a vac was lying in the centre of the nave and one rubber glove was placed on a pew near the vestry. Had she spontaneously combusted JF wondered? Nope - she had gone for coffee leaving the vestry floor to dry. She was interested in what we were doing but on hearing the word internet rang her husband unbeknown to us and he appeared to ask further questions. We must have passed the test, which was done in ever-so-friendly a manner! [open] ST MARY, ORCHESTON Like Chitterne, Orcheston is a village that has two churches, one at either end of the village. St Mary's lies to the west and is extremely picturesque outside thanks to its saddleback SW tower and the early C19 pinnacles flanking the gables of the nave, chancel and the porch. It is kept locked but the Cat Hotel next door has the key, or they should have had. A lady had checked it out but not returned it, yet the church was locked. I set off in pursuit and whilst I followed her around the village she retuned to the church and let JF in! Cats talked to us everywhere we went. And on the way out I noticed that the stained glass memorial in the porch was a - er - cat. [locked with keyholder notice] ST GEORGE, ORCHESTON is in the care of the Churches Conservation Trust (CCT). It is not large, a nave and chancel, with a medley of windows. Added since a C19 vestry (which hides the Norman north doorway) and an ashlar built west tower of some pretension, although barely rising above the nave roofline. Inside it has a fine panelled arch. The vestry is kept locked and therefore it is difficult to see the doorway apart from glimpses through the vestry windows. Pretty fittings in the chancel, probably of c1833. The church also has some very high quality stained glass, the best seen so far today (and a couple of poor windows too!) [locked with keyholder notice] (Lunch taken at a local's recommendation \"The George\" which looked less inviting than the Plume of Feathers opposite but the food was excellent and good value.) ST MARY, SHREWTON Shrewton is an odd place, really what seems to be main-road Shrewton is Maddington village. You would be forgiven for thinking the church to be a Victorian rebuilding, against a medieval tower, indeed I said as much to JF as we approached. A dog was tied to the outside gates of the porch, and a friendly lady was just locking the church as we arrived. She was only too pleased to let us inside and thank goodness she did as here was some of the best architecture of the day. Transitional Norman north and south arcades, built slowly, so that by the time the chancel arch was reached the style merged from upright leaf decoration on the south capital to full stiff leaf on the north, yet both with trumpet scallops. This chancel arch has three detached shafts to both responds, a sophisticated design. The rest looks C19, clerestory, aisles and chancel - yes Mr Wyatt again. His too the Norman font with upright leaf design, too perfect to fool anyone but quite nice. On a sill in the south aisle is a piece of sculpture, carved on all four sides, including a crucifixion, and was probably the head of a churchyard cross. [usually locked, no keyholder] ST MARY, MADDINGTON on a hill in the centre of Shrewton, surrounded by new executive housing to the west, the Old Vicarage to the north and the Manor House to the south. Another CCT church, and one which owes much of its appearance to the C17 and of course the indefatigable Wyatt. The original nave and chancel was extended in the C14 by a chantry chapel, which was extended west by an aisle in the C17, and to the south by a transept of the early C19. The nave roof is of 1603 (date on a corbel), and the west wall of the nave has plasterwork with a large date 1637, reckoned to be the date a west gallery was added of which no trace now remains. The oddest thing inside was a length of battlements and one pinnacle which used to be on top of the tower but now stand underneath it along with the parish bier. [locked with keyholder notice] ST ANDREW, ROLLESTONE is yet another CCT church. Bizarrely three churches out of five in a very small area have been vested, and although I am not complaining it does seem odd or lucky. This one is a delight, no more than a nave and chancel, reached by a grassy track from the main road to Stonehenge and just outside of Shrewton. The C19 restoration (suspect is Wyatt) provided a bellcote and built a porch to shelter the Norman doorway which they also mutilated in the process. [open] ST PETER, WINTERBOURNE STOKE is delightful outside, massed around a C13 crossing added on to a Norman nave. The tower was completed in the C15 and the nave west front is also from this time. Norman N & S doorways, the south blocked and weathered badly, the north doorway, harshly and yet incompletely restored. Some amusing external carvings all add to the anticipation on opening the door. What a disappointment! The dullest interior of the day, largely the fault of the very poor and oppressive roofs of the C19. I cannot blame Wyatt for these a W Crook was responsible - and to his credit Wyatt would have done better. In more recent times the chancel has been emptied of the expected furniture and carpeted and given comfy upholstered chairs. The north transept is screened off for a vestry, and the south transept is separated from the crossing from very heavy curtains, and now equipped with kitchen cabinets, sink etc. If you visit here and don't get in don't be too disappointed. The two features you might want to see can be seen by looking through the two westernmost side windows at the other, glass dated 1835, four saints and a overly pious depiction of the BVM, and the plain Norman font with its exotic Jacobean crown cover. We returned to Chitterne and parted on our separate ways, agreeing that this was yet another successful day out. We both I suspect snuck a 10th church visit in, mine was at NORTON BAVANT (All Saints) which I found locked. The key hanging in the porch did not unlock the door sadly yet looked like it should have! This was an odd shaped church with an unusual roofed low burial extension south of the south transept. I will be returning here when there is better light left in the day (it stands in trees) and I have more time to track down a key if one is needed at a more respectable hour!\n\ncc/2019-30/en_middle_0021.json.gz/line51\n\n__label__cc\n\n0.740912\n\n0.259088\n\nChanges To Partnership Returns “There are two changes in this revised version of T5013 that are worth noting..” New Disclosure Requirements In February 2012, the Canada Revenue Agency (“CRA”) issued a revised version of its Partnership Information Return (Form T5013) to reflect new information that the CRA requires. There are two changes in this revised version of T5013 that are worth noting: The adjusted cost base (ACB) and “at-risk amount” for each partner are to be reported on the revised version of Schedule 50 of Form T5013, entitled “Partner’s Ownership and Account Activity”. Persons affiliated with the partnership must be listed on new Schedule 9 of Form T5013, entitled “Affiliated Corporations, Partnerships, Partners or Trusts”. Effective Date and Transitional Relief These new requirements apply to filings beginning February 2012. However, the CRA, recognizing that these new requirements significantly increase the compliance burden for many partnerships, has provided transitional administrative relief. On February 29, 2012, the CRA announced that it will accept returns containing either the 2010 or 2011 version of Form T5013 Schedule 50 if the return meets the following conditions: It is filed on time; and It contains complete information on partner identification and annual transactions between partners and the partnership. The CRA recognizes the increased demands imposed by new Schedule 9, and recommends that this schedule be prepared based on the best knowledge and ability of the partnership and preparer. The CRA has announced that it will not impose penalties for incomplete Form T5013 returns, filed for 2011 fiscal periods, that have been prepared, to the best knowledge and ability of the partnership and preparers, and submitted by the filing deadline. While transitional relief is available, preparers and their clients should start early to gather the information needed to support the new requirements. This may be an onerous task for partners who have not maintained the required ACB and at-risk amounts calculations historically, especially for partnerships that have not been preparing and filing T5013 returns previously because of the exemption for partnerships with less than five partners (see Tax Tip 10-25). Additional information with respect to partnership and information return filing requirements can be found on the CRA website at www.cra.gc.ca/tx/bsnss/tpcs/slprtnr/prtnrshp. The professionals in the TSG will be happy to assist you with questions regarding the preparation of Form T5013 returns and the revised disclosure requirements.\n\ncc/2019-30/en_middle_0021.json.gz/line53\n\n__label__cc\n\n0.547462\n\n0.452538\n\nHome » Car sales Europe » Car sales by segment » Midsized SUV segment Car sales statistics for the midsized SUV / crossover segment segment in Europe, updated every quarter. May 19, 2019 by Bart Demandt 5 Comments The compact crossovers segment in Europe has been growing briskly in recent years, but in the first quarter of 2019 that growth has stalled as the segment grew by just 1% to 476.000 sales. That means it now makes up 11,7% of the total Euorpean car market, up from 11,1% in 2018. We’ve separated the tables of the compact and midsized crossover segments but still feature them in one post and in one graph as the models in these classes are so close to each other in size and there are so many different opinions on which models belong in which of these segments. Combined, sales in these segments are down 1,5% to 14,2% of the total European car market, and VW Group improves its share of these segments to 23,7% while Renault-Nissan is down to 20,6% and PSA grows to 18,8% of these segments combined, for a whopping 63,1% share by just three manufacturers. The traditional class leader Nissan Qashqai loses a significant chunk of its advantage over its rivals with a loss of 18% and almost 3 percentage points of share. The Volkswagen Tiguan in 2nd place is also down, but by just 4% while the #3 Peugeot 3008 sees stable sales and therefore closes in on its two rivals. The Ford Kuga loses more than a fifth of its sales and is knocked off its 4th place by the Toyota C-HR, up 13%. The C-HR also passes the two South-Korean players Hyundai Tucson and Kia Sportage, both down by double digits. The Renault Kadjar, freshly facelifted, is down 4% and feels the Skoda Karoq and Opel/Vauxhall Grandland X breathing down its neck.

Most of the growth comes from newly launched or very recent models. We’ve decided to separate the tables of the compact and midsized crossover segments but still feature them in one post and in one graph as the models in these classes are so close to each other in size and there are so many different opinions on which models belong in which of these segments. Combined, sales in these segments are up 15% to 13,7% of the total European car market, and VW Group and Renault-Nissan each control 22% and PSA another 17% of these segments combined, for a whopping 61% share by just three manufacturers. The Nissan Qashqai is still the best selling crossover in Europe, despite losing 7% on its record volume of 2017. Its closest rival is still the Volkswagen Tiguan, down 9% although its figures are estimates, as we don’t have official split figures from the 7-seater Tiguan Allspace and we estimate a 15% take rate for that version, which is featured in the midsized crossover segment. The Peugeot 3008 continues its impressive run and also crosses the 200.000 sales threshold thanks to a 20% increase on last year. When combining these segments, the 3008/5008 duo would be on top of the charts, just ahead of the Qashqai/X-Trail, with the Tiguan trailing at a distance. By any standard an impressive performance from the French brand, and we’re curious to see how the all-new Citroën C5 Aircross will perform once its deliveries start to show its true potential.

The entire top-5 has set new sales records in 2017. We’ve decided to separate the tables of the compact and midsized crossover segments but still feature them in one post and in one graph as the models in these classes are so close to each other in size and there are so many different opinions on which models belong in which of these segments. Combined, sales in these segments are up 32% to 11,9% of the total European car market, of which Renault-Nissan controls 26% and VW Group 20%. The Nissan Qashqai is still the best selling crossover in Europe, despite adding just 6% to its record volume of 2016 to close in on a quarter million sales. Its closest rival is still the Volkswagen Tiguan, up 31% to become the second nameplate in this segment to top 200.000 sales and to close the gap with the top spot to less than 14.000 sales. The new Peugeot 3008 immediately jumps onto the segment podium with nearly 170.000 sales in its first full year, an impressive performance against any standard. It beats the two South-Korean rivals that have fought for the segment podium for years as well as the Ford Kuga which shows an impressive 27% growth despite being 5 years old already, apart from a facelift in 2016.

Almost 1,13 million compact crossovers have already been sold so far this year, virtually the same number as the small crossover segment whose growth curve has flattened. The Nissan Qashqai still tops the ranking and continues to win sales, but it’s losing share of the segment as it increased by just 8% both in Q3 and YTD. Its main rival Volkswagen Tiguan gained just 4% in the third quarter, as the new generation had just reached its full potential in the same period last year. Behind these two leaders, three players are having a pretty close race, selling within 2.000 units of each other in the third quarter. The Peugeot 3008 holds the final step of the segment podium and behind it, the Hyundai Tucson feels the Ford Kuga breathing down its neck in the third quarter as the Ford improves 11% while the Tucson sees stable sales. This top-5 holds almost two thirds of the segment with the rest of the top-10 holding nearly the other third as the remaining models make up just 2,6% of the segment. [Read more…] European sales 2017 first half: compact & midsized crossover segments August 12, 2017 by Bart Demandt 6 Comments Sales of compact crossovers in Europe maintain their explosive growth rate, jumping 29% in Q2 and 33% in the first half, to 720.194 units. This is 8,6% of the total European market, almost 2 percentage points up from the 6,7% in the first half of 2016. The Nissan Qashqai holds on to its top spot for the first half, but sales were up only 2% in the second quarter as it was outsold by the Volkswagen Tiguan by 300 sales. It seems like the Qashqai will keep its crown of the segment for yet another year, extending its streak to 11 years as the compact crossover champion. The all-new Peugeot 3008 SUV storms up the charts to third place, up from #6 in the first quarter, proving it is an instant hit for the French brand. It’s unlikely to be able to challenge the two top players in this segment, considering it was still at only 75% of their volume in the second quarter, but nonetheless an impressive performance for a newcomer to the segment. It also manages to outsell the two South-Korean models which have been around for a few generations now and have built up quite some recognition and a customer base over the years. [Read more…] Midsized SUV segment Citroën C4 Aircross, europe, Ford Kuga, Honda CR-V, Hyundai Tucson, Jeep Cherokee, Jeep Compass, Jeep Wrangler, Kia Sportage, Mazda CX-5, MG GS, midsized suv, mitsubishi outlander, Nissan Qashqai, Nissan X-Trail, Opel/Vauxhall Antara, Peugeot 3008, Peugeot 4008, Renault Kadjar, Renault Koleos, sales, Seat Ateca, Skoda Kodiaq, SsangYong Korando, Subaru Forester, Subaru XV, Toyota RAV4, Volkswagen Tiguan May 9, 2017 by Bart Demandt 12 Comments The midsized crossover segment remains one of the fastest growing segments in Europe, even faster than the small crossover segment at +28% in the first quarter of 2017, to 371.500 sales. The Nissan Qashqai holds on to its top spot, thanks to sales up 13% on its already impressive score last year, but the Volkswagen Tiguan is closing in quickly with a gain of 78% to come within 10.000 sales. Considering the Tiguan outsold the Qashqai in the second half of last year, this is actually a bit of a disappointment for the model, than may suffer from a bit of cannibalization from the Seat Ateca and to a lesser degree the Skoda Kodiaq. In third place we find the Hyundai Tucson, similar to the full year 2016 ranking, but the facelifted Ford Kuga is growing at double its rate and is not far behind in 4th, up from 6th last year. European sales 2016 midsized crossover segment Sales of midsized crossovers are growing even faster than their smaller rivals, at +26,8% in Q4 and +22% in the full year 2016, compared to +16% for the small crossover segment and +6,2% for the overall market. And while the growth is fueled by newcomers and updated existing models, the segment leader and the model that started the popularity of this segment Nissan Qashqai maintains its leadership of the segment, even though its volume is stable on last year. However, its dominance of the segment will be challenged in 2017, as the new generation Volkswagen Tiguan already outsold its British-Japanese rival in Q4, by 2.600 sales and will fight for the segment lead for the first time ever. In third place we find another relative fresh model: the Hyundai Tucson, knocking down its sibling Kia Sportage off the podium for the first time since 2012.

After being outsold by the small crossover segment in Q2, the midsized models rebound in Q3 and also pass the 1 million sales mark in the first nine months, a figure it took all twelve months as recently as 2014. In a sign of consolidation, all top-8 models gain volume, of which only two with less than 2 digits, while the following 9 modles all lose volume, #9 to #12 with single digits and #13 to #17 with double digits. The Nissan Qashqai is stable, which means it loses share of the segment, from 19,4% last year to 16,6% this year, but 2016 will be the 9th consecutive year the Qashqai leads the segment. However, next year may offer a change of guard, as the Volkswagen Tiguan was only 4.200 units behind in Q3 and even outsold the Nissan in August.

Nonetheless, sales of midsized crossovers are expected to continue increasing, as new brands and models keep entering this highly competitive class. The increased competition takes away some share from the segment leader Nissan Qashqai, but so far no other model can come close to challenging its leadership. Its closest rival of last year, the Volkswagen Tiguan suffered from a model changeover and has dropped to 4th place, making room for the two South-Korean sister models to step onto the podium. Even the all-new Renault Kadjar outsold the Tiguan in Q2, but the VW is likely to strike back in the second half, when deliveries of the new generation gain traction. As a result of these new or updated models, the Ford Kuga loses two spots on last year to become a distant #6 despite growing 22%.

And that growth is very likely to continue, as new players keep entering the segment. Due in the next 18 months are the Tiguan-based Seat Ateca and the slightly larger Skoda version of those cars, Peugeot will enter the segment with crossover-like replacements of the 3008 and 5008, Renault has just revealed the Koleos in China which will start sales here next year and MG may bring the GS to the UK. So far, no model has been able to come even close to the Nissan Qashqai, the undisputed segment leader since 2008. Sales of the Qashqai are stable at +2% despite new generations of its closest rivals and also despite its partner Renault successfully launching a Qq derivative with the Kadjar. And don’t forget the 7-seater Qashqai+2 has been replaced by the X-Trail as well. In fact, the share of Renault-Nissan in this segment has grown from 23,8% last year to 31,7%. Last year’s #2 Volkswagen Tiguan loses just 1% of its volume right before the new generation is launched. As result, the model is outsold by the new generation Kia Sportage and under heavy attack from the all-new Hyundai Tucson. The two South-Korean brands grow their share of the segment from 17,9% to 21,4%. The Tiguan was outsold by the Tuscon in January and February and both were outsold by the Kadjar in March, indicating it will be an interesting fight for the podium this year. That’s unlikely to include the Ford Kuga, which loses a position despite adding almost a quarter to its volume of last year.

Torrent: Download, Magnet A clarification about the source of our Detective Conan videos By buricco on October 29, 2018 3:21 PM | \" Usually I don't entertain people who try to spam the site to promote their own encodes or whatever, but I got a comment in my spam filter that I felt merited attention (although the commenting engine wouldn't let me delete the link and then post the comment with edits, so my only choice was to leave it in the trap). This person says he checked the Baaro XDCC bot and found \"just TV rips with pretty low quality\". Apparently he has a vision problem: apart from the \"remastered\" episodes, none of our episodes prior to 453 (and we have subbed many episodes prior to 453--in fact almost all our Conan subs are from that period) are DVD rips at a minimum. Although episodes 453 and up are, in fact, TV rips, they are HDTV rips, and come from the best available sources, and are encoded to the same standards as the DVD rips. They should be higher quality than DVD rips, and they are certainly higher resolution. In all cases the raws are from as close to source as possible - the original DVDs, the original VOD streams, the original broadcast transport streams - and are never taken from publicly available encodes (unless said encodes come from our own staff, or those of our sister groups on Hoshinet). I suspect the real reason for the comment was that the poster merely wished to pump his own raws. As, again, I could not delete part of the comment and let the remainder stand, I had to leave the comment unapproved; as there was no way to make this post make sense in a thread, I felt it necessary to create a separate post on the blog to clarify matters, in case someone else thinks we use substandard public raws on our releases. Detective Conan 474 So I banged out a quick resub over the past few days to prove that I was still alive. I was originally going to do it as part of the DCHD project but decided to start from scratch (or rather, from the English manga) instead. Torrent: Download or Magnet So a funny thing happened...

This doesn't mean that Baaro will cease to exist, but we'll be working together on improving some of the older episodes of Detective Conan, which had in the past 5 years been my bread and butter.

(Thankfully, using the ColdFusion/Baaro subs, and thus mostly the official translation, instead of some ancient fansub. :P) This of course means I had to put it on top priority to get an actual Baaro sub out. By the way, something you won't get with a public raw, but you will get with our encodes: I cleaned up a lot of the earthquake news flash *by hand* before resorting to a second source to get rid of the rest. Detective Conan 468, or What's Project DCHD? By buricco on July 5, 2016 6:06 PM | \" Back in November 2014, I started getting raw rips of Detective Conan in HD, starting from the first episode when they switched to widescreen, from satellite TV in Japan. I hung on to these rips, and did encodes from them, but I really wanted to use them to make subtitles - especially for episodes which were originally not available to the subbers in HD, and which were only released in the measly resolution (standard at the time) of 704x396. For a while, I didn't do anything with the opportunity. Making bad blood with DCTP is not something I want to do, even now. But here was this chance - to make bad subs good and to make good subs better - and I didn't want to let it pass by. The idea of Project DCHD is to take DCTP's subs which were originally released only in 396p, give them a coat of paint, and put them on new 720p raws. I will credit them as completely as possible. Here's some improvements I intend to make: The song translations are completely redone, mostly by bluesun (of The Moonlighters). Other boilerplate translations are generally edited to match The Moonlighters and Baaro Fansubs conventions. Timing and typesetting completely redone from scratch out of necessity. This also means sometimes, line breaks are changed. As far as ability and/or availability permits, additional editing and TLC is done. Some of these episodes, let's be honest, really need it. You occasionally find a line that's a complete howler. I would like to emphasize that these are not official DCTP releases, they're Baaro releases adapted from DCTP's work.

And so I did--and the biggest gaping hole in competent fansubs of Conan going back all the way to the beginning of the HD era is now filled, even though to be fair, these 6 eps could certainly still use some work. These are the last 2 episodes of the aforementioned 6; the previous 2 Baaro releases are the other 4 episodes. « Lupin III | Main Index | Archives | Baaro Fansubs » Getting Releases The Conan 132-134 Question We're Recruiting!

Lero, the UL-based Software Research Centre, has announced a new fellowship which will attract world leading software researchers to Ireland on a short term basis. Under the Parnas Fellowship, global leaders in software will consult with industry clients, staff and students across Lero partner third level institutions during their stay in Ireland. For the first time anywhere in the world, Canadian software engineering pioneer David Parnas has allowed his name to be used in a sponsorship of this kind. To mark the launch of the fellowship, he will visit the University of Limerick on 31st May to present a paper on software engineering. The first recipient of the Lero Parnas Fellowship award, Dr Axel Legay, will also deliver his inaugural address on Statistical Model Checking (SMC) which is used across robotics, automotive and systems biology. “We are honoured that Dave Parnas, one of the fathers of software engineering, has agreed to lend his name to this fellowship. As reflected in the calibre of the first recipient, Dr Axel Legay, the fellowship will add to the knowledge of the Irish software sector,” commented Professor Brian Fitzgerald, chief scientist, Lero. “We welcome anyone who would like to hear these distinguished speakers on May 31"
