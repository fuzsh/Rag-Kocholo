These pioneering She won first place in most art contests that she chose to enter â a path that eventually led to a full art scholar- ship, putting Rose on the fast track to success. But hold on. Not so fast. This is the point where Roseâs story, already a very Jewish one, morphs into the story of a womanâs struggle to live her life on her own terms. Roseâs controlling mother, Pauline, refused to let her follow through with her education. Period. End of story. In fact, her son does not even know the name of the school where she had gotten the scholarship. âThe boys can go to college, but girls must stay home and help take care of the store,â her mother said. Thatâs the way things were done in those days. Roseâs dream of becoming an artist came to a halt. Rose married her first husband, Irving Harelick, in the late 1930s. Like her mother, he had a very controlling personality. He did not want her spending time with her uncle and his artist friends in Woodstock, Greenwich Vil- lage, or God help us, Provincetown. He wanted dinner on the table, not paint on the palette. That wasnât unusual behavior in a husband at that time, so Rose went along with it. Eventually, she recognized that this was not a good marriage, so even though it was rare at the time, she left her husband. They divorced in 1939. In 1946 Rose married Walter Hertzberg. Walter was a really nice guy. When Rose came to him one day and said, âI want to be an artist,â he said, âFine. Go find the best art instructor you can, and Iâll pay for it.â That resulted in the creation of over 4,000 works, some in private collec- tions, museums, and galleries worldwide. Some are in the Montclair Art Museum, and some are in the Smithsonian. Rose always had a talent for drawing and painting. In the late 1940s, she studied with the pioneering post-im- pressionist painter Ben Benn. She came to abstrac- tion at the Art Studentsâ League, but it was through her private studies with Hans Hofmann, the dean of 10 JEWISH STANDARD APRIL 12, 2019\n\nP:11\n\nLocal We protect your family with passion and compassion. low-relief constructions opened new vistas in collage.
