        "text": "Note: You might want to start at the Barack Obama Index Page, especially if you arrived here by using a search engine.\n\nBarack Obama seems to have associated himself with a number of people and organizations that are, to say the least, out of step with most Americans.\n\nOn this page:\n\nMichelle Obama\n\nValerie Jarrett\n\nMrs. Obama\n\nFear and Trembling in the Deep State. Michelle Obama, gussied up in about three grand worth of designer clothes and shoes and stepping away from her four mansions and almost 200 million dollars in assets, also played the race and class card, wagging her finger at the rich and saying her parents were \"suspicious of folks who took more than they needed.\" Ignoring the multi-millions the Obamas set aside for her own children, she talked about the fact that most \"will never benefit from the affirmative action of generational wealth.\" Translated, this means she's still for reparations and redistribution of wealth — though surely not from her.\n\nNo One Is Buying It. Barack and Michelle tried to gin up artificial enthusiasm for Harris by recapturing the good ol' days 2008-era magic of \"hope\" and \"yes we can!\" No sentient human being could plausibly nod along to a comparison between Barack Obama and Harris. Shared far-left politics and general swarthiness aside, the talented orator Obama does not in any way resemble the dimwitted California cackler-in-chief, who is less popular than venereal disease and was only installed as Democrats' presidential nominee following Uncle Joe's bloodless coup due to a forced hand and lack of any other viable option. In his speech, Obama also referenced how tapping his \"friend\" Biden as his 2008 running mate was one of his \"best\" decisions. Really, how stupid do they think we are? Obama, although he didn't have the courage to publicly call for it, was — along with Nancy Pelosi — a leading plotter of Biden's fateful July coup.\n\nBarack and Michelle Are Greedy Grifters Who Hate America. Barack and Michelle Obama pretend to be evangelists preaching the political gospel of hope and change in a post-racial America. But in reality, they are nothing but race-baiting con artists who loathe our way of life — using the race card to line their pockets with tens of millions of dollars. And last night — they exposed their ugly underbellies — Americans who hate America. [...] Michelle told the DNC that her father was always suspicious of folks who took more than they needed. The lack of self-awareness was something to behold. They also own an $8 million mansion in Washington, D.C., a million-dollar apartment in New York City, and a house in Chicago. And their real estate empire also includes an estate in Hawaii. Just last year Mrs. Obama was invited to deliver a speech on diversity, equity and inclusion. She was paid nearly $750,000 for the one-hour speech. How much of that money did she spread around Chicago's South Side? Before the Obamas moved into the White House, they had a combined income of about $1.6 million. Today, the Obamas are worth about $70 million. Anybody want to explain how that happened?\n\nWho's to decide what's needed? We often use the word \"need\" a little more than we probably should. [...] The truth is that our needs are much more basic than that. We need clothing, food, shelter, etc. And that worries me because Michelle Obama thinks that taking more than we absolutely need is a problem. To be accurate, she said, \"suspicious of people who took more than they need.\" I find this fascinating because, well, the Obamas own three homes. The least amount they paid for a home was $1.65 million, and that was in 2005. I'm always amazed at how people who spend their lives working in the public sector and for non-profits can amass so much wealth, but apparently, that's just what they need. Let's understand that most of us are living with far more than we absolutely need to survive. We also have a lot of things that simply provide comfort, such as smartphones, televisions, computers, and so on. [...] Who decides what one needs? To what level are we ascribing the term \"need\" anyway? Does anyone need $750,000 for an hour-long speech?\n\nMichelle Obama wore nearly $3K pantsuit to DNC while touting her parents were 'suspicious' of the wealthy. Michelle Obama wore a nearly $3,000 pantsuit to the Democratic National Convention (DNC) in Chicago while touting to attendees that her parents were \"suspicious\" of the wealthy. The former first lady began her DNC speech on Tuesday by saying the last time she was in her hometown of Chicago was to memorialize her mother, the woman \"who showed me the meaning of hard work and humility and decency\" and \"who set my moral compass high and showed me the power of my own voice.\" \"She and my father didn't aspire to be wealthy. In fact, they were suspicious of folks who took more than they needed,\" Obama said. \"They understood that it wasn't enough for their kids to thrive if everyone else around us was drowning. So my mother volunteered at the local school.\"\n\nThe Editor says...\n\nThe Editor says...\n\nAs I understand it, the Obamas have a mansion in Chicago, 29 acres at Martha's Vineyard, a mansion in Hawaii, and a residence in Washington DC which is probably quite nice, too. Companies (like Netflix) give them money for apparently doing next to nothing, unless the Obamas are providing some service that is hidden from the public, and what legitimate service would that be? (Nobody gives a politician millions of dollars without expecting something in return.) If ever there were \"folks who took more than they needed,\" they are the Obamas themselves.\n\nBig Mike, Who Is Worth 70 Million Dollars, Says His Parents Were Always Suspicious Of People Who Took More Than They Needed. Michelle Obama, who has a net worth of about $70 million, says her parents were always suspicious of people who took more than they needed. \"[My mom] and my father didn't aspire to be wealthy. In fact, they were suspicious of folks who took more than they needed.\" \"They understood that it wasn't enough for their kids to thrive if everyone else around us was drowning. So my mother volunteered at the local school.\" [Video clip]\n\nThe Fate of Kamala Harris. The preferred narrative that the true power brokers will serve up to the ever dutiful mainstream media will come in the form of \"internal polling numbers\" that will show the bloodbath the Democrats face if Kamala is the only choice. They will turn up the heat on Kamala's feeble candidacy through media while they float another name, someone being recruited by the likes of Pelosi and Shumer, and this pre-determined outcome will finally be revealed. The process will play out as designed, and the country will be stunned by the outcome. The winning ticket that will rise up through the nomination process will be Obama/Whitmer — yes, the other Obama. Representing the reluctant politician, Michelle Obama will step up for her country and will generate a seismic reaction that will prove to be a formidable contender possibly capable of fending off the solid Trump/Vance candidacy. As far-fetched as this might seem, don't lose sight of what is at stake: not just the White House, but control of Congress. Winning at all costs is the only option remaining.\n\nMichelle! The one-half. [Scroll down] I've continued to keep an eye on Michelle, who, we are assured, hates politics and absolutely does not want to be president and will not run. Now we are told a Reuters/Ipsos poll predicts Michelle would beat Donald Trump 50 to 39. Perhaps, to save \"our democracy,\" Michelle would nobly sacrifice herself to ensure a fourth Obama term? Why 50 to 39? Because she's more than Kamala-sort-of-black? Because reporters have long drooled over her arms? Because some of the messianic shine might rub off from Barack? Instead of being \"the one,\" she might be becoming — the title of one of her books — \"the one-half?\" But what are Michelle's qualifications for the office, other than being the first lady to the most malignant, America and American-hating narcissist ever to occupy the Oval Office?\n\nA Biden Replacement? Obama Involved? In this context, it's instructive to consider an article in Axios that appeared some hours before last Thursday's debate, purporting to explain why Michelle Obama was not campaigning for President Biden: her distaste for politics and her dislike of the way the Biden Family had treated her friend Kathleen Buhle, Hunter Biden's ex-wife. Both of these reasons were less than sturdy. [...] But, viewed politically, this information and the date of its release make sense. If Michelle Obama is seen by her husband or the party as a plausible replacement for President Biden, then there's real incentive to make her lack of participation in the Biden re-election effort seem like something other than a potential candidate avoiding sullying-by-association. Viewed from this angle, well placed Democrats' response to the Thursday debate disaster supports the view that the Biden implosion was part of a planned obsolescence. There was something ritualized about the self-described Democratic \"freakout\" after the debate: these spontaneous eruptions all used the same language. Biden, it was said, had one job — to \"reassure\" his \"neurotic\" party — and he failed. These Democrats were \"heartbroken,\" and their \"voice[s] cracked\" as they critiqued the President.\n\nBarack Obama and the Stupidity of the American Voter. This is so simple, so elementary, that I really hate to state it. Joe Biden will soon be kicked to the curb for Michelle Obama. She's the perfect Democrat nominee. She's got dark skin and female genitalia, and she absolutely hates America as founded! And her bicurious hubby is the man behind the curtain giving the orders. Unless Donald Trump wins in a landslide, thereby overcoming all the Deep State machinations, coordinated media lies, and ballot mischief sure to come, Michelle Obama will be our next president. And Barry O. will have another four, or possibly eight, years to continue wrecking... er transforming our formerly great country. Will the stupidity of the U.S. electorate lead to the election of Michelle Obama and the death of the American dream?\n\nMichigan Non-Profit Is Reportedly Sending Out Voter Registration Mailings With Image of Michelle Obama. A Michigan non-profit is reportedly sending voter registration mailings containing a picture of Michelle Obama on the front. In a post on X, Leading Report wrote, \"BREAKING: A non-profit organization in Michigan is reportedly sending out voter registration mailings with Michelle Obama on the cover.\" The Voter Participation Center sent the forms according to the return address listed on the mailings. The About section of The Voter Participation Center's site describes the organization as \"a non-profit, non-partisan organization founded in 2003 to help members of the New American Majority register and vote. Since then, the organization has helped more than 6 million people register and cast ballots.\"\n\nMichelle O breaks cover, and her timing is spot on. All over the media in the past two days was Michelle Obama's \"exclusive\" interview, in which she dished on the Biden family dysfunction. [...] To any of us who attended the First and Second ladies' horror shows during Barack's first and second terms, we saw, repeatedly, strain, and certainly no love lost between Michelle and Jill. Both are ambitious, to put it mildly, vain, and love money. Both serve as expensive props for their spouse. Neither accept rivalry from any quarter. Michelle's abrupt garrulousness this week was not a coincidence. It is a clear sign that the faux indifference of Ms. Obama to \"be\" president of the United States may be about to evaporate. We can anticipate, although most hopefully not, a putative fourth Obama administration, as Michelle and her expensive, fascistic PR network further obliterates any sign of her consistent, overarching love of power and cash, \"for the good of the country.\"\n\nThe Editor says...\n\nThe network of evil people who stole the 2020 election (in part, by simultaneously stopping the ballot counting in four critical states in the middle of the night) in order to install Joe Biden as their hapless puppet are probably eager to steal another election and install Michelle Obama, and give Barack H. Obama another two terms as virtual president. With the amount of power and money at stake, they will find a way to pull it off, and they don't care whether they get caught or not!\n\nSummer Surprise: The Looming Biden Replacement. [Scroll down] It's still hard to imagine that Biden won't drop out of the race just before the convention in late August. I expect that he'll cite a need to focus on family, particularly given his son's criminal trials, and will bow out. He can then pardon Hunter before leaving office. To capitalize on the ruse, however, Democrats have very few \"elite mounted troops\" to deploy. But arguably, there are two. Michelle Obama might qualify, but the going wisdom suggests that she's not interested. I've never truly counted her out, though. Replacing Joe and passing over Kamala as a black woman will carry a bit of outrage that Michelle Obama's nomination would easily overcome. However, Michelle Obama has never governed or served in any political office, and besides being put in high-paying make-work jobs (her job earning $317,000 as a diversity consultant before becoming first lady doesn't count), she has no previous experience suggesting executive leadership.\n\nMichelle Obama's Big Day Out. Michelle Obama wrote a book. [...] I get the idea of a new author feeling giddy that she has a book on the shelves and maybe even going out to the stores to bask in the moment. But Obama is hardly a stranger to the spotlight. She is not an \"unknown.\" This is her fourth book, not her first. [...] The Obamas are just like us! They shop at Target! They are celebrities in their own right, but they still empathize with the masses who are paying way too much for gas and groceries and who have maxed out their credit cards just trying to stay alive. [...] The problem is that none of that is true. Among their many properties, the Obamas have an opulent home in Martha's Vineyard and continue to rub elbows with the elite. They haven't the slightest clue or concern about the things that are giving ulcers to the people who shop at Target every day. They are beyond those things but still expect Americans to back the president and party that have made it impossible to gauge if one's paycheck will outlast the month. Some critics on X were of the mind that this was a stealth campaign ad. Others saw it as a blatant attempt to peddle books.\n\nIt Doesn't Matter Who the Democrat Nominee Is. While Biden's poor record makes him vulnerable, we shouldn't expect any other Democrat to be viewed very differently. In fact, all of the most rumored replacements, Michelle Obama, Gavin Newsom, and Kamala Harris, have their own unique way of attaining unpopularity. While Michelle Obama would be their ideal choice, so Barack would no longer have to lurk in the shadows, since 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue would once again become his residence, the Obama popularity has been on a steady downtrend since 2008. Barack became the only president to ever win re-election by a smaller popular and Electoral College vote margin than he did previously. His coattails were also not long enough to propel Hillary Clinton to victory on his way out of office in 2016, due in large part to the estimated 13 percent of Obama voters who switched to Trump. And 2020 was, well, 2020. With a staggering 78 percent of Americans believing we are heading in the wrong direction, there is no reason to believe that the spouse of the person widely believed to be responsible for this destruction would perform well in a general election, not to mention that most of the children whose school lunches were ruined because of Michelle are of voting age now.\n\nDid someone mention school lunches?\n\nWhy the Democrats Can't Replace Biden. Privately, Democrats may be pining badly for Michelle Obama to leap-frog ahead of the vice president without splintering the party faithful. The former first lady would presumably campaign arm-in-arm with her husband on the old party platform of \"two presidents for the price of one.\" But on more than one occasion, Ms. Obama has essentially announced through her and her husband's political associates that she has no intention of running for the Oval Office. Who can blame her? She has always been repelled by the tawdriness of retail American politics, and she is well satisfied with her and her husband's place in American history. Whoever becomes president next year will encounter a continuing steam of foreign and domestic calamities, as well as well-nigh insurmountable financial challenges. Michelle Obama is justifiably prudent in her unwillingness to subject herself and her family to lower approval ratings this time next year than either Joe Biden or Donald Trump are scoring this year.\n\nMichelle Obama: September Savior or 'Suicide Mission'? Joe Biden is, as a candidate, a dead man walking. Forget about doctors; anyone who has cared for an aging parent with cognitive decline can see all the signs and knows what is coming next. Joe can't remember words, names, or dates, and walks stiffly with his arms locked. He falls often. He gets angry and cusses. It is all there. [...] Problem is, bound by tradition, Joe Biden is \"entitled\" to run for a second term — which he is in theory doing. No primaries, no public discussion, just an assumption that Joe is allowed two cracks at the ball. Is tradition powerful enough to hand the White House over to a senile old man for four more years? Or is Joe Biden's legacy among Democrats to be the guy who put Trump back into power?\n\nWill Dems Swap Michelle Obama for Joe Biden? No Way. For the last couple of days, the news world has been abuzz with the Hur Report, its condemnation of President Biden's mental state, and its implications for the 2024 Presidential race. Day by day, more and more Democrats are showing some willingness to yank the rug out from under old Joe and sub in someone else. There is a lot of noise about someone either belling the cat and convincing Joe (or, more likely, Jill) to step down for \"reasons of health\" or \"family matters\" or to outright 25th Amendment the old man into the next time zone, which would put Kamala Harris at the Resolute Desk and, oh, by the way, would make her the incumbent heading into the election. The question is this: Who will replace Joe Biden on the ticket, should this come to pass? Will it be Kamala Harris, whose approval ratings are somewhere between divorce lawyers and dysentery? Maybe, but recent GOP candidate Vivek Ramaswamy thinks it will be former First Lady Michelle Obama.\n\nThe Editor says...\n\nIt doesn't matter that Michelle Obama is incompetent, and would merely serve at the puppet of Barack H. Obama. That just means she and Biden are functionally equivalent. With Michelle Obama in place as President, we still won't know who's really running the country.\n\nWhat 'the Obama woman' would offer as president. The Obama woman is a grotesquely unattractive, boorish harridan who suffers more humiliation than Hillary Clinton whose husband molested and battered women into submission. The Obama woman endures the ignominy of being married to someone that publicly boasts that his days are consumed with fantasies of sodomizing and being sodomized by men. Add the fact that she has an insatiable hatred for America and the American people, specifically those Americans with the absence of melanin she exhibits. She epitomizes a person with a massive inferiority complex who suffers from the realization that no matter what she does in the futile attempt to exhibit the more desirable qualities of womanhood, her husband will always find men more alluring than he finds her. [...] Imagine the baggage she would bring to presidential race. If she was a runaway train fueled by usufruct when she was the \"first woman\" (I cannot in good conscious call her a lady), just imagine her if the Democrats were able to steal her the election.\n\nMichelle, Ma Belle. For starters, how pathetically weak is the party that such a walking fiasco as \"Joe Biden\" is allowed to even pretend that he can run this race? His campaign is an obvious sham, a place-holder in hopes that one or another of the [specious] lawfare court cases against Mr. Trump might knock him off the game-board — and that's not looking so great now since Fulton County DA Fani Willis [erred] in her giant RICO action and Special Counsel Jack Smith is getting smacked around week after week on esoteric points of procedure. [...] A late August kick off for Michelle Obama would minimize her public exposure until, really, the last two months of the race. (She reportedly hates being on display.) [...] Except for one thing: none of the people chattering about this (James Rickards, Dan Bongino...) have mentioned that the Michelle plan actually represents a fourth term for Barack Obama. I mean... really... do you suppose that Barack will spend the next four years upstairs in the White House \"residence\" with an apron on, baking red velvet cakes and sweet potato pies while Michelle presides in the Situation Room, directing drone strikes against various people of the Koran?\n\nIf Michelle Obama's Running, Two Sentences from Her College Thesis Should Be Read by Everyone. Since Michelle Obama is now being discussed as an alternative if the powers that be within the Democratic Party decide to dump Joe Biden at the Democratic nominating convention, it's time we start telling the truth about this woman. I have collected much research on her over the years but for now, let's discuss her college thesis. In her thesis, she makes the wild claim that America was founded on \"crime and hatred\" and that whites in America are \"ineradicably racist.\" Of course, history is a lot more complex than that. Most Americans opposed slavery, which is why we had a civil war to end this evil institution. And after the Civil War, racist laws would have been abolished a lot sooner, but the party Michelle belongs to — the Democratic Party — blocked civil rights legislation for decades. They were the party of slavery, Jim Crow and segregation. The Republican Party was specifically founded to oppose slavery and racist laws, but Michelle seems to be unaware of this. What's disturbing is that she constantly uses the terms \"separationist\" and \"integrationist\" in her thesis when describing the views of black people, and her thesis clearly identifies her as a separationist. So, if you are a minority who wants to get ahead in broader society, Michelle thinks you're a sellout. Talk about divisive.\n\nTerrors of the Michelle Obama Prophecy. [Scroll down] Biden is failing, especially in the key swing states. \"We had a poll come out in Michigan the other day and he's down like eight points,\" said Bevan. \"And these are scary, scary numbers for Democrats, and the longer they continue the more I think you will hear about Michelle Obama. And the reason you'll continue to hear about her because she's the only answer to the question of 'Who else?'\" Biden can drool all over his ties and look vaguely into space but they couldn't dare replace him because that would mean the ascension of Kamala Harris to the presidency, and that would mean the end of the world. But a Michelle Obama could obliterate Kamala's idiotic ambition as an identity politics totem, because Michelle could take her off the board and the Democrat political logic still holds.\n\nReport: Michelle Obama's Secret Plan to Replace Joe Biden for President Emerges. The Gateway Pundit's Kristinn Taylor shared an explosive story last week that Barack and Michelle Obama are angling to replace decrepit, unpopular Joe Biden with the younger and more popular Michelle as the Democrats' presidential nominee. Michelle has reportedly already surveyed major Democrat donors about her potential candidacy and in 2022 allegedly told a gathering of CEOs in New York City she was running. Now, the New York Post's Cindy Adams reveals that a secret plan has emerged to throw Old Joe under the bus. She claims it comes from \"credible sources few have access to and usually not meant for the noses of the media.\" Barack has reportedly polled donors and put together a plan for Michelle, which is still being tweaked, according to Adams.\n\nReport: Michelle Obama Angling to Replace Joe Biden for President. An article by New York Post legendary gossip columnist Cindy Adams reports Barack and Michelle Obama are angling to replace Joe Biden with former First Lady Michelle as the Democrats' 2024 presidential nominee. Obama world was rocked when Donald Trump short-circuited the Obama revolution to remake America when he defeated would-be Obama successor Hillary Clinton in 2016 and has taken merciless revenge on President Trump ever since. Barack Obama is thought by many to be the behind the scenes power of the Biden presidency. But with Joe Biden and Kamala Harris having some of the worst polling numbers for incumbents seeking a second White House term and Trump leading Biden in most polls, it appears the Obamas are quietly laying the groundwork for Michelle to step in and save the Obama revolution.\n\nWho is Trump's real opponent? Not Biden. Biden is a symptom, not a cause of America's illness. The cause lies in the embrace by the Democrat party of a Marxist/fascist hybrid collectivism, to be elevated by any means necessary. Biden will almost certainly be replaced before the general election, and not with Kamala Harris. This will likely be timed to happen very deep into the election cycle to ensure that Republicans have as little time as possible to expose the new nominee as the Marxist puppet he surely will be. Given the puppeteer role Barack Obama has played in the present administration, the theory that Biden will be supplanted by Michelle Obama at the eleventh hour is emerging as the most credible. The Democrat party will forcefully focus voters on the celebrity of their nominee to forestall meaningful scrutiny of her lackluster qualifications and the disturbing anti-white American animus evidenced throughout her life.\n\nDon't be shocked if Michelle Obama sneaks her way into 2024 race. Coming back now — Obama. Not him. HER! We've heard this drumbeat for a while. Now it's louder. Plans are to grab Michelle for the Democratic presidency choice. Making the music is Barack the orchestra leader. Michelle says she's \"terrified\" Trump will win. No casual burp. Was programmed. She's sent a survey to Dem biggies asking their feelings about her candidacy. Obama's quietly angling for Joe to go. He's weaseled up to this for a few weeks. Mouths aren't talking. But mouths are knowing. Over one year ago, summer of 2022, she was in NYC meeting several big hedge CEOs, and said, \"I am running, and I am asking for your support.\"\n\nIs Michelle Obama Running a Shadow Campaign for President? Michelle Obama is very popular with Americans and was even proud to be an American once. She's out making speeches and giving interviews, explaining how terrified she'd be if Donald Trump won. Barack Obama needs his fourth term to complete the US transformation. He'd have it with Michelle as president. [...] Michelle Obama has been copying Obama's path to the White House, but Benny wrote on X that most people haven't been paying attention.\n\nTwo Racial Grievance Girls: Michelle and Meghan. How much do Meghan Markle, duchess of Sussex, and Michelle Obama, ex-first lady, have in common? [...] The two women share middle-class backgrounds and higher education (Michelle Ivy League, Meghan top-tier) degrees. Both women have been (Michelle) and are (Meghan) using their own mothers to \"help\" raise their children, in a sort of familial au pair capacity. Both have high-fashion tastes and use private jets for travel. Both are frequent commentators on their own racial victimization. The serious press doesn't run much on Meghan, yet just enough to legitimize the tabloids; [...] Michelle Obama, by contrast, is heavily reported, always, in the MSM. Michelle does revolving books (or someone does for her). Apparently, she has a heavy hand in the Obama Netflix MAGA attack theatre. She routinely fills up the Obama unearned privilege tank with loads of cash, to spend or invest, from wildly overpaid speeches and \"cameo\" appearances. Never has grifting been so easy. At last count, Michelle has four mansions to \"live in\" and enjoys her subsidized, international celebrity vacation tours annually.\n\nMichelle Obama White House 'coup' likely underway, Peter Navarro says. Former Trump administration adviser Peter Navarro claims a \"coup\" is underway to put former First Lady Michelle Obama in the White House, replacing President Joe Biden on the November ballot. Navarro warns that all signs point to Biden being replaced as the Democrats' 2024 candidate. The media is quick to write off Navarro's warning as a \"conspiracy theory,\" but it's obvious Biden is not the best choice Democrats have for 2024 — and they know it. \"President Biden will not be on the November ballot. With each new Biden family revelation and new poll finding Donald Trump will beat Mr. Biden like a drum, the inevitability of Mr. Biden stepping aside grows,\" Navarro wrote in The Washington Times. \"Yet Mr. Biden will not step aside before the end of the Democratic primary season. Instead, without real opposition, Mr. Biden will be poised to accept his coronation at the Democratic National Convention in August in Chicago,\" he continued in his op-ed.\n\nMichelle Obama Absolutely Is Political. Upon hearing the notion that Michelle Obama may be the presidential candidate for Democrats in 2024, many Republicans reflexively recite the mantra that she is enjoying her life and is not political. Let me make one thing clear: Michelle Obama is a political animal. Republicans must quickly begin to prepare for her candidacy. [...] At Princeton University, Michelle was elected to the board of the Third World Center, a radical black activist fraternity. Michelle and Barack had a mutual professor at Harvard, though in different years, named Charles Ogletree. When Barack was elected president, Ogletree told TMZ that between Barack and Michelle, he would have thought Michelle more likely to run for president. In Chicago, Michelle befriended another political animal, the former head of the Weather Underground domestic terrorist group and accused cop-killer Bernardine Dohrn. Michelle worked with her for two years at the Sidley Austin law firm and had dinners at her home with Bill Ayers for years, right up until the time Barack ran for U.S. Senate in 2004. Dohrn was Michelle's first guest speaker at Public Allies, the community organizing group she ran. Yes, like Barack, Michelle was also a community organizer for three years.\n\nSpeculation about Michelle Obama Replacing Biden in 2024 Gets a Shot in the Arm. I'm not sure we've said this often enough for long enough, but Joe Biden will not be the Democrats' candidate come November 2024. Even the Democrat-Press is warming its' bony hands over that fire, so the conversation naturally turns to who the DNC will pick to displace Uncle Joe. Inevitable isn't too strong of a word for his departure, but does he even realize? Herr Biden wasn't fit in 2020, and it's been downhill since then (for him and us), but the list of potential replacements reads like a horror story you tell hard-working Americans if there are any left after what Democrats have done to the Economy. Hillary Clinton! She doesn't want to campaign or even do the work. It's just a check box on her bucket list. But rumor has it she'd take the bit in her cackling mouth and run the nation further into the ground. Michelle Obama is another name I hear a lot. It has been reported that she hated the Clintons, the Bidens, the White House, and Washington, DC. But she loved the prestige, the money, the access, the vacations, the entourage, and the fandom. Michelle-O wants to be queen, not President. The latter is way too much work.\n\nMichelle Obama: The Black Face of White Flight. Last weekend, former Obama campaign adviser David Axelrod kicked the Democrat barn doors open, suggesting on X that it may be time \"to change horses.\" [...] On Monday's Megyn Kelly show, Sen. Ted Cruz suggested a likely strategy for the Democrats going forward. \"The chances are rising dramatically that the Democrats at their convention next summer will dump Joe Biden and parachute in Michelle Obama as the nominee,\" said Cruz. He added, \"I don't want to see that happen, but... I think Axelrod has just increased the chances of that significantly.\" No one on the right wants to see Michelle run — too much potential for even more racial madness — but Los Angeles filmmaker Joel Gilbert may be an exception. In the summer of 2022, Gilbert released a prescient film and book, each titled Michelle Obama 2024: Her Real Life Story and Plan for Power. Having secured a copy of this doggedly researched book in manuscript form, I was able to incorporate relevant facts unearthed by Gilbert into the book on which I was then working. Of Michelle's many hypocrisies — Gilbert documents them all — none struck me as viscerally as her self-appointed role as the Torquemada of so-called \"white flight.\"\n\nLeave It to Believer. Based on recent polls, Democrat strategist David Axelrod believes Joe Biden would be \"wise\" to drop out of the 2024 presidential race. [...] The true believer now wants Joe Biden to pack it in, which invites consideration of the alternatives. Back in 2008, Christopher Hitchens said of Michelle Obama's college thesis that \"to describe it as hard to read would be a mistake; the thesis cannot be 'read' at all, in the strict sense of the verb. This is because it wasn't written in any known language.\" Ten years later, after two terms of her husband, Michelle's Becoming duly arrives. Readers meet David Axelrod, who would \"lead the messaging and media for Barack.\" Last November, Michelle came out with The Light We Carry, and as Joel Gilbert explains in Michelle Obama 2024, the narrative departs from her reality in substantial ways. In the style of her husband, with Dreams from My Father and The Audacity of Hope, Michelle now has two books in her corner. In all likelihood, David Axelrod is still \"Obama's narrator,\" and the believer's suggestion that Joe Biden step down makes perfect sense.\n\nMichelle Obama is neither interested in nor capable of running. There's a mounting symphony of prediction that to my sensitive ears sounds as enjoyable, i.e., tolerable, as fingernails being scraped on a chalkboard. That sonic unpleasantness is the growing number of prognosticators predicting the Democratic Party is preparing to parachute the Obama woman into the presidential race to replace Biden. [...] The Obama woman is enormously unlikeable. She's a humiliatingly uncouth harridan; she's lazy, contumelious, and if persons with firsthand knowledge are to be believed, a lush who imbibes more vodka than water; she's at best boorish. Additionally, she is without accomplishment. Her cheering section will claim otherwise, but apart from the perks associated with her husband, she in fact has accomplished nothing of merit on her own. Seriously, let's be honest: What has she done in her life? Exactly what was her professional career before cashing in on Barry's political ambitions? She was little more than a beard for her sexual-deviant pervert of a husband. Do we forget the alleged reasons for her mother moving into the White House, what amounted to a bribe to keep her from divorcing her perverted husband immediately after his first election?\n\nYou can't drain a swamp from a raft in the middle. All indications are the lady affectionately known as Big Mike will, at some point, open her $10,000 handbag and let the presidency of the United States drop into it. (Michelle Obama has never had to compete fairly or strive vigorously for anything.) Why would the Obamas stay in Washington, D.C. if not to claim her ultimate black privilege? Why would Michelle Obama condescend to the style-and-smile coaches, the image revisionists who have turned her into the new Betsy Ross, if not to collect her great expectations?\n\nHow Trump Beats Michelle Obama in 2024. For all the talk of a potential Michelle Obama 2024 presidential run, almost no one mentions Michelle's greatest political vulnerability: the terrible way she has treated the black community in Chicago. For Michelle, it began with her running away from all-black schools as a child, and it continued with her abuse of the black community in her professional career. Not surprisingly, Michelle Obama does not mention any of her outrageous behavior toward the Chicago black community in her two recent autobiographies, Becoming and The Light We Carry. But Donald Trump most definitely should. If Michelle Obama becomes the 2024 Democrat party nominee, here are four questions with which Trump should hammer Michelle: [...]\n\nTrump was a great president, but a looming Michelle Obama candidacy means we need a new plan. The saying goes that you prepare to fight the last war (or political campaign), not the next one, and now there is the real possibility that Joe Biden will drop out to be replaced by Michelle Obama. This would change the entire landscape of the election and serve as a convenient excuse to absolve the rest of the party for what Biden did, when we all know they are equally at fault. It's easy to see how this could have been the plan all along. Biden's installation meant four more Obama years of \"fundamental transformation\" with an unwitting scapegoat, the disposable bumbling puppet. Knowing the proclivities of the far left's identity politics, you can easily see how this kind of development could have been pre-planned for maximum effect.\n\nBiden, Menendez, And Michelle: Birds Of A Bribery Feather. [Scroll down] Think about Michelle's speech for a minute. According to the Daily Mail, she was paid $741,000, which means that by the time she was six minutes into her speech, she'd made more money than 50% of households in the United States make in a year. This reported fee is also more than three times the already criminally large amount she normally gets paid to read words someone else wrote for her. So, what makes Michelle suddenly three times more valuable? Did she discover a cure for cancer? A limitless, free, source of clean energy? An end to world hunger? Did she unlock the secrets of faster-than-light space travel? Or announce a plan to bring world peace? Hardly. She is a talentless woman who happens to be married to a former president. The organizers of the event and 5,000 people in attendance most likely have already forgotten whatever it was she said. The one and only reason she commanded that price is because of the current buzz that she might run for president next year, given that Biden seems unlikely to last until November 2024, let alone January 2029. The organizers of the event were buying political influence, not insights. How is this different from what Biden was doing when he was selling access through his drug-addled son?\n\nMichelle Obama got $750,000 for a single speech in Munich. Debate is raging about whether Michelle Obama will step in to save the day for Democrats if both Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are yanked from the top of the ticket. Meanwhile, though, Michelle isn't letting any grass grow under her feet. Instead, she jetted off to Munich to give a single speech, in exchange for which she collected 700,000 euros, which is equivalent to over $740,000. Given how rich the Obamas are, one has to wonder about her price tag... although I have some guesses. I'm not a Michelle Obama fan. She came from an affluent black Chicago family; got into the Ivy Leagues (probably through affirmative action, given the childishly poor quality of her bachelor's thesis); obtained jobs for which she was not qualified and that required no work but nevertheless paid her very, very well; and ended up as America's First Lady for eight years. Along the way, she and her husband amassed at least $70 million, a wealth package that includes three mansions, one in D.C., one in Martha's Vineyard, and one in Hawaii.\n\nThe Editor says...\n\nI do think at a certain point you've made enough money. [1] [2] [3]\n\nMichelle Obama to Rake in More Than $700,000 for One-Hour Lecture on \"Diversity and Inclusion\" in Munich. Former First Lady Michelle Obama will be paid more than $700,000 for a one-hour lecture on \"diversity and inclusion\" in Munich. Nothing to see here. Move along. According to reports, Michelle Obama traveled from Mallorca to Munich to deliver a one-hour speech on \"diversity and inclusion\" at the \"Britz & Pretzels\" conference. Michelle Obama will be paid 700,000 euros for her appearance. Sounds legit.\n\nSnopes makes a call on Michelle Obama pregnancy photos. For years now, conspiracy theorists have insisted that Michelle is a biological man. Internet sleuths pointed to a clip of comedian Joan Rivers taken shortly before her death, who dryly declared that \"Michelle is a tranny.\" She's \"a transgender,\" Rivers said. \"We all know it.\" [Tweet with video clip] Rivers' comments took on a new life in June, when Tucker Carlson, in his second episode of what was then known as \"Tucker on Twitter\" stated, \"By 2008, it was obvious to anybody who was paying attention that Barack Obama had a strange and highly creepy personal life, yet nobody ever asked him about it.\" \"By that point, a leader's behavior within his own marriage, the core relationship of his life, had been declared irrelevant,\" Carlson said. \"It was Barack Obama's business, not yours.\" [Tweet with video clip]\n\nThere's a Shift Afoot. [Joe] Biden was installed by the Obama network for a single four-year term with multiple intentions — the rapid escalation of far-left progressive objectives and policies, in combination with a need to control the outcomes of DC systems to protect the Obama network from scrutiny. This is the reason why the Lightbringer maintained an operational residence in DC that was more akin to a policy and control command center. The entire Biden administration is seeded with like-minded travelers from the tribe of Teh One. However, in/around the time Susan Rice was withdrawn from the Biden team in the White House, a shift was visible. Team Obama began a slow withdrawal of influence, and the shallower, less strategic, team of Biden became more autonomous. The shift was subtle, but people — even media — began to notice increased blunders and Biden contradictions. If my suspicions are correct, we are likely to see a gradual Obama team exit from DC, culminating in a sale of his Kalorama neighborhood \"residence.\"\n\nTed Cruz Has a Very Interesting Theory on Who Will Replace Joe Biden in 2024. [Scroll down] The former first lady would be able to enter the arena as the \"adult in the room,\" offering a break from the current political ranks, or at least that's what the narrative would be. After all, why put in an almost-sure loser when you've got an almost-sure winner sitting on the sidelines? Is it that simple for Democrats, though? I'd suggest it's not. Rather, you can't talk about political scenarios without taking into account the arrogance of your average politician. Would Harris simply step aside because the Obamas told her to? Would Pete Buttigieg sit on the sidelines while possibly losing another eight years toward his sky-high aspirations? Would Gavin Newsom, who desperately wants to be the president, put a smile on his face and remain in California? I just don't see any of that happening. In a vacuum, voters would like to think their party will do the smartest, most effective thing, but that's not how it works in practice. Instead, you usually have a bunch of self-aggrandizing figures who all believe only they can save the nation, and they will take everyone down with them rather than ensure victory.\n\nMichelle Obama 2024 Details Released — 'Replacement' plan underway! As President Joe Biden continues to slide in the polls, Democrat insiders are allegedly working to convince a former first lady to throw her hat in the ring. Sources reportedly told RadarOnline that the desperation is building up behind the scenes, with some \"begging\" Michelle Obama to consider running for the Oval Office. Their efforts are bolstered by a recent poll that shows an announcement by the wife of former President Barack Obama would immediately put her in a hefty lead above the incumbent president. The Center Square Voters' Voice Poll results indicate that Democrat voters favor Biden when paired up against long-shot candidates Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Marianne Williamson, but an insider says a matchup with Mrs. Obama would be a blowout.\n\nThe 2024 Michelle Obama Factor. The Biden presidency began with a slew of Obama-esque executive orders reversing many of Donald Trump's accomplishments, and exists with about 70% of staffers who are veterans of Obama's eight years in the White House. All evidence points to none other than Biden's old boss, Barack Obama. Recall that after leaving office, Obama strangely continued to live in Washington, D.C. [...] The Democrats have meanwhile set it up for Michelle to be their 2024 nominee by moving the first primary out of Iowa, where Michelle would have had to campaign in 99 counties, to South Carolina, where half of the Democrat party primary electorate are African-American. South Carolina is also the state Michelle claimed as her \"adopted home state\" back in 2008, when campaigning for Barack, because her grandparents are from there. And, if that weren't enough, the Democrats have placed their 2024 convention in, of all places, Chicago, Michelle's hometown, to set up what they believe will be a \"homegirl convention.\"\n\nHere comes Obama's fourth term:\n\nMichelle Obama Is A Top Contender For 2024 Democratic Presidential Nominee, Historian Says. For the better part of the entire year, people have made the case for why Biden could pull out of the race. Often cited reasons are his declining health and scandals related to alleged illicit business dealings with his family — activities that are now drawing increased congressional scrutiny. California Gov. Gavin Newsom is widely suspected to be planning a presidential run for 2024. However, Stanley writes that \"to replace Biden with the next Obama available, far from being revolutionary, would reinforce the line of political continuity that stretches from 2008-2024, with only [former President Donald] Trump's election as a temporary aberration.\" Former President Barack Obama has been suspected of having an outsized role in influencing the current government serving under the Biden administration, due to sheer proximity — Obama still lives in Washington D.C., breaking with long-held precedent whereby past presidents leave from inside the Beltway.\n\nDon't discount a Michelle Obama run for the presidency. Speaking at Turning Point USA's ACTCON convention this past weekend, Roger Stone predicted that Michelle Obama will be the Democrat party's nominee for president. He may be right. I certainly wouldn't discount her being on the ballot or actually winning. Here's Stone's tweet with the video showing him making that prediction: [Tweet with video clip] [...] The only way to save the Democrat party from RFK Jr. and Kamala is to put up someone black, female, and hugely popular. Beyonce and Oprah seem like unlikely candidates. That leaves only Michelle.\n\nMichelle Obama's Affirmative Action Adventure at Princeton. In the years prior to applying to Princeton University, Michelle and her brother Craig avoided the all-Black South Shore High School only a one block walk from their home. The Robinson family wanted their children to study with Whites. This was no surprise given that Michelle had been beaten up by the neighborhood kids for \"acting White\" and \"talking White\" during her childhood. Michelle writes in her memoir, Becoming, about getting into a fist fight with a girl who repeatedly called Michelle an \"oreo\" — a major insult meaning you are Black on the outside but really White on the inside. Michelle had no desire to study with \"those people\" for high school. Michelle's brother Craig was sent to an expensive private Catholic school, Mount Carmel (the Robinsons were not Catholic), while Michelle took two buses 90 minutes to attend Whitney Young magnet school. At Whitney Young, Michelle was able to keep up with her school work and get decent grades by spending twice as much time on homework as her peers. However, Michelle's shortcomings were exposed during testing. She admits to having done did poorly on standardized tests, including the SATs.\n\nMichelle Obama Takes Time From Opulent Greek Isles Vacation to Tweet About Oppression. Everyone in life faces disadvantages of one form or another. Almost all children get called an unpleasant name or two in grade school. Some are oppressed by a drunk, abusive, or absent parent. Others may be trapped in horrific schools or extreme poverty. Still others are simply not gifted with high IQs or the ambition to work hard and succeed. The list of reasons why most people don't go to Ivy League schools and then on to lucrative careers is long, and \"oppression\" comes in many forms. If you are the first black White House family, oppression takes the shape of having only two exclusive island waterfront mansions in which to spend your days. Sometimes, you simply must jet to the Greek isles to vacation with your Hollywood besties at their Aegean private island manse. People covered the former first family's sad exile these past few weeks: [...]\n\nMichelle Obama Releases Statement Following SCOTUS Ruling Against Affirmative Action. In a historic ruling, The Supreme Court on Thursday ruled that the Harvard and UNC race-based affirmative action programs are unconstitutional. Schools nationwide will no longer be able to discriminate against students on the basis of race. How outlandish were Harvard's affirmative action policies? An African American student placed within the 40th percentile of their academic index is more likely to gain admission than an Asian student who ranks in the topmost, 100th percentile. Similarly, Black students who fall within the 50th percentile have greater chances of acceptance than White students who are at the pinnacle of their academic performance.\n\nMichelle Obama's Exploitation of the Black Community. [Scroll down] Michelle's two most significant jobs in Chicago involved working on behalf of white liberal elites to deal with the problems that Black people were causing them. Chicago liberals couldn't hire a White person to make 20,000 Blacks homeless. Their answer was to hire Michelle Obama. She became Mayor Richard Daley's assistant planning commissioner. Her job was to facilitate the destruction of the low-income all-Black Cabrini Green housing project and cede the choice downtown real estate to Democrat party donors developers like Tony Rezko. Nor could the White liberal elites at the University of Chicago Medical Center hire a White person to deny access to health care to Blacks. Only a Black person could fill that job. For a cool $300,000 a year, Michelle was prepared to do all the denying that was needed.\n\nIs Michelle Obama going to replace Senator Feinstein to jump-start a presidential run? What are the odds Gavin Newsom will replace Dianne Feinstein with Michelle Obama to start Obama's real return to the White House? Barack Hussein Obama wants to finish off the country with a fraudulent fourth term with Michelle as the \"president,\" starting her run by being appointed to replace Dianne Feinstein. [...] We're presenting this case simply because it's better to be forewarned of danger and to pre-puncture this little party balloon they have planned. After all, they would love to spring this on everyone as a \"wonderful\" surprise. If we've already predicted and discussed this little trick, it'll take some wind out of their sails.\n\nMichelle Obama is peddling sugary drinks that don't meet the nutrition standards she advocated as first lady. According to this Bloomberg article, Michelle Obama is \"a co-founder and strategic partner at Plezi Nutrition, a maker of sweetened beverages for kids ages 6 and up,\" which I take to mean that she is profiting directly from the sale of these beverages. Her rationale: [\"]Obama says she's offering a lower-sugar alternative to steer them away from sugary drinks.[\"] So, are they healthy for kids? [\"]Plezi's first product is a flavored juice drink blend that, under the very standards Obama championed, could not be served in US schools.[\"] [...] Plezi (and Michelle) stand to make a lot of money from catering to children's sugar addiction: [\"]On Target.com, on a per-ounce basis, Plezi is 2-3 times more expensive than other non-soda drinks targeted at children, including Coca-Cola's Honest Kids and Kraft Heinz's Capri Sun drinks. It's also more expensive than soda.[\"]\n\nBrace yourself for Barack H. Obama's FOURTH term.\n\nIt sure looks like Michelle Obama is being pressured to run for president, forcing Biden out of the 2024 race. It's obvious to anyone in the Democrat camp not totally delusional that Joe Biden's declining mental faculties make him almost impossible to re-elect in 2024. Douglas Schoen and Andrew Stein are two Democrats that have a good grasp of reality, and so they are putting out a signal in the Wall Street Journal — which is read by virtually every media editor in the country — that it is time to push Michelle Obama into running. That is, if she has not already been convinced by her husband. [...] Unless Michelle claims an absolute lack of interest, then she is OK with it. Biden would withdraw before South Carolina if she challenged him since he would be humbled there, as Hillary was by Obama in 2008. Blacks may love the white candidate who kisses up to them, but only until there is a black challenger around. Our country is much more tribal than it has been since the Civil War.\n\nMichelle Obama Expected To Challenge Joe Biden For President. Following the resignation of Susan Rice from the Biden White House, reports indicate that Michelle Obama is running for president in 2024, according to Newt Gingrich who said that the former First Lady has already kicked off the soft launch of her presidential campaign and Roger Stone, advisor to President Donald J. Trump. [...] Michelle Obama was last seen on stage with Bruce Springsteen, playing the tambourine in front of thousands of adoring liberals. Days earlier she drew thousands of people to an event in Los Angeles with left-wing icon Oprah Winfrey. Gingrich explained that these appearances are out of character for Michelle Obama, explaining that she, \"recently had 9,000 people at an event with Oprah in Los Angeles,\" Gingrich added. \"I think Republicans had better pay significant attention to Michelle Obama.\" \"I hadn't believed that until I saw her on stage with Bruce Springsteen, and I thought, you know, 'this is not a person who's hiding.'\"\n\nMichelle Obama 2024? The first question that came to my mind was whether Michelle Obama would even give a thought to such a plan. She's already spent eight years in the White House and she and her husband became fabulously wealthy as a result (somehow). She's living in a mansion by the ocean and is pretty much a rock star in the media who can get an invitation to go on television any time she's feeling bored or in need of attention. Why put up with all of the hassle and scrutiny that comes with being the president? Particularly at a time when the wheels seem to be coming off of the national cart. I suppose it's possible that she's so addicted to power that she might consider it, though. And if she does, would she automatically be a winner by default? We can set aside the fact that she's never held any elected office and has no experience that would qualify her for the position whatsoever.\n\nNewt Gingrich warns GOP that Michelle Obama may run for president to avoid 'kamikaze' Biden re-election effort. Joe Biden's announcement that he is running for re-election has put the Democrats in a pickle. Not only is Biden visibly declining into senescence at an accelerating pace, he has re-upped his commitment to Kamal Harris as his running mate and likely replacement if elected to a second term, and obviously unable to complete it in all likelihood. But getting rid of an incumbent president is difficult, and replacing a black and female running mate is difficult, to say the east. Even worse, the only serious challenger within the party, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., is unacceptably hostile to the pharma and corporate interests that supply the endless money that buys victory for the Democrats. The need a deus ex machina: an outside actor with the kind of force that changes everything; and Newt Gingrich thinks they may have one in Michelle Obama.\n\nThe Michelle Obama Nightmare Scenario. [Scroll down] But the other barrier to entry is the fact that Michelle doesn't seem to want to do this. She's not a particularly driven woman. She's lazy and frivolous, and she enjoys floating around the Mediterranean off Nice with adoring zillionaires on huge, environmentally unsound yachts mocking the saps who buy into the climate change hoax. Being president is a lot of work, and she doesn't seem like somebody who really cares a lot about working. She just wants stuff, and right now she's got stuff. Nor does Barack Obama particularly seem interested in getting back into politics. He was the one president who never seemed to like the job, and he gave the impression that he felt being president was a painful duty, proving that there's something to like about everyone.\n\nMichelle Obama is not a fan of the Second Amendment and says Obama administration was scandal-free. Michelle Obama has a short memory. Or, at the least, a selective memory. She was interviewed by her real-life friend CBS morning show host Gayle King (Oprah's BFF) Thursday. The soft interview was to promote Michelle's latest projects which include a Netflix special based on her most recent book, \"The Light We Carry.\" She told Gayle King that \"unfettered\" access to guns is a bad thing. And she said that there were no scandals in the Obama administration. That level of gaslighting is what we've come to expect from Obama fans and King is in that camp. How nice that she allows her friend to re-write history and doesn't bother to challenge her narrative.\n\nAlso posted under A partial list of Obama scandals.\n\nMichelle Obama Looks Disheveled in Baggy Clothes in Australia. The Obamas took a private jet to Australia for Barack's two-week speaking tour. Apparently climate change mandates are only for the peasants. Barack Obama trashed Trump during his speaking tour Down Under. Michelle Obama spent most of her trip to Australia make-up free and looking disheveled in baggy clothes.\n\nMichelle Obama would be Democrats' best chance to win in 2024. There has been some recent media buzz, as well as hope, about the possibility that former First Lady Michelle Obama might be persuaded to enter the 2024 presidential race. While that prospect is very unlikely — she has always rebuffed any notion that she might run for office — the enthusiasm is understandable. As the Democratic presidential nominee, or even the vice-presidential nominee, she would give Democrats their best chance at retaining the White House. As it stands, President Biden's chances of winning reelection against a credible Republican presidential candidate (which excludes former President Trump) aren't great. The majority of voters don't want the 80-year-old Biden to run again, including a solid majority (57 percent) of Democratic voters. And that majority is likely to grow if voters become even more concerned about the president's health and ability to perform his duties as president.\n\nMichelle Obama Is Not Coming to Save the Democrats. My favorite new conspiracy theory goes like this: the Democrats know they are in big trouble for 2024. They have this addled, dementia-riddled, diaper-wearing octogenarian and his dreadful wife occupying the White House, and he's become an embarrassment. These days he makes three to four hair-curling, cringey gaffes per week, falls up the stairs to Air Force One every time he tries to trot up them to project American strength and vigor, and has been credibly accused of passing gas in front of the Queen Consort of England. But Democrats can't abandon him before the primaries because, well, Kamala. So Biden will announce he is running again but will withdraw sometime around the Democratic National Convention so as to clear the presidential field for ... Michelle Obama. The stench of desperation is hilarious, isn't it? That's how bad the field of Democratic presidential prospects is.\n\nRecent First Ladies and Their Academic Degrees. Given the acclaim Michelle Obama has enjoyed for her influential public voice, it behooves us to consider where and how her career acquired its impetus — her vaunted thesis. True, the thesis was written many years ago, but let us not forget that it served as Obama's ticket into the \"new elite,\" despite its being a gallimaufry of platitudes and pseudo-academic fustian. Indeed, there are so many verbal and grammatical gaffes peppering the study that one scarcely knows where to begin. [...] The only proper response to her thesis is embarrassment or, if one is feeling generous, a discreet indifference to so mawkish an undertaking. The document is marred by a complaining and self-justifying tone throughout and treatments of a subject nobody can object to in a social climate infected with white guilt, is filled with politically correct patois, is grammatically challenged, and is, in a word, superficial beyond belief. The jargon is either pleonastic or impenetrable, a veritable spaghetti code of applied language. Dinesh D'Souza was understandably unsparing when he wrote: \"Anyone who has read Michelle's college thesis — a document so illiterate and incoherent that it was written, as Christopher Hitchens put it, in 'no known language' — will chuckle heartily at this one.\"\n\nFox News: Are you ready for ... Obama 2024? No, not the term-limited former president. The other Obama. More accurately: Are you ready for another few months of [wild] speculation about the improbable? Fox News gives a hearty aye to the latter question, positing that former First Lady Michelle Obama could become a Democrat Deus ex machina in 2024. If Joe Biden stumbles or opts out — the latter highly unlikely, of course — Democrats will need someone spectacular to pull their chestnuts out of the general-election fire. And that someone ain't Kamala Harris.\n\nCould Michelle Obama run for president? In 2016, Hillary Clinton tried to become the first former First Lady — and in fact, first woman overall — to be elected President of the United States. Clinton, herself a former U.S. Senator, lost that Presidential race to Donald Trump, but could another former First Lady mount her own historic campaign in 2024 and win? [Video clip] Over the course of the past two Presidential elections, essentially ever since her husband was finishing up his own eight years in the Oval Office, Michelle Obama has been on the shortlist of dream candidates for the Democratic party.\n\nMichelle Admits She 'Couldn't Stand' Barry. Much to everyone's surprise, soft and embraceable Michelle admitted that for more than a decade, she \"couldn't stand\" her spouse. From 1992 until 2002, while Barry was strategizing his passage from a community activist to ruler of the world, Michelle was silently aiming her death stare at someone other than Trump. One must admit that it is impressive how Michelle manages to paint herself as the victim of whatever circumstance she happens to find herself in. Furthermore — not that this is a competition — it's been many years since Barack Obama graced the world stage with his awesomeness. Yet, unlike Michelle, there are hundreds of millions of Americans who still \"can't stand\" him.\n\nThe Obamas Despise Free Speech, and Show It. Michelle Obama warned America that a certain unnamed former president, who is questioning the results of the 2020 election, threatens her definition of democracy. Michelle and Barack pretend they support a peaceful transfer of power and the democratic tradition of \"moving on,\" when in fact it's the opposite. Barack has never \"moved on\" and is likely a \"third-term\" puppeteer, pulling Joe \"Marionette\" Biden's strings from the bunker of his $8.1-million Kalorama mansion. That's why, at the portrait début, Michelle exploited the occasion to vilify Trump while pretending she believes that \"our democracy is so much stronger than our differences.\" Does Michelle need to be reminded that both she and her husband have spent their entire political careers discrediting views different from their own and punishing rather than celebrating opposing points of view? Michelle and Barack Obama have never respected the differing views of the American people. The couple showed no respect for difference during Obama's presidency, and since Trump's election, they show even less.\n\nSo Michelle Obama was behind Twitter's ban of Trump all along. Michelle Obama, wife of President Obama, was one of the Democrat outsiders who pressed Twitter to make the unprecedented move to ban President Trump, then a sitting United States president, from that company's platform. That's the latest revelation from the latest installment of the Twitter files, done by independent journalist Michael Shellenberger.\n\nTwitter Files reveal Trump ban came after Michelle Obama, others pressured the company. Former President Donald Trump was banned from Twitter the day after former first lady Michelle Obama and others demanded the company \"permanently\" remove him, according to the newest \"Twitter Files\" installment. On Saturday, CEO Elon Musk and journalist Michael Shellenberger released the fourth batch of Twitter documents that show internal communications by the company's executives between Jan. 6-8, 2021, including and shortly after the riot at the Capitol Building. Among the files, Shellenberger reported \"internal and external pressure,\" including from the former first lady, fell onto the company calling for Trump to be banned from using Twitter.\n\nPlans are being made for Barack Obama's fourth term:\n\nMichelle Obama's Book Launch of her 2024 Campaign. Don't be fooled. In the promotional interviews for her new book, The Light We Carry, Michelle Obama insists that the book is simply her personal \"toolkit\" about how she deals with the challenges of \"uncertain times.\" No, The Light We Carry is not a self-help book. It is Michelle's crafty attempt to position herself to be the Democrat nominee for president in 2024. In fact, it is Michelle's second autobiography, a follow up to her wildly successful 2018 memoir, Becoming. As it would have been awkward for Michelle to write a second self-promotional autobiography entitled \"Becoming Part II,\" the new book is released under the ruse of a self-help guide. So why would Michelle release a second autobiography disguised as a self-help book? Michelle told an audience at the Obama Foundation in 2018, \"Barack and I don't do things incidentally, there's a strategy.\" I am convinced The Light We Carry is part of Michelle's strategy to become president in 2024.\n\nFawning NY Times' 'Review' of Michelle Obama's New Book Is an Embarrassment. Ben Shapiro was blunt on Twitter. He had discovered \"the most sycophantic book review ever written.\" The book was the second tome from multimillionaire author and advice guru Michelle Obama. The review appeared in The New York Times, from the paper's \"Help Desk\" columnist, Judith Newman. She's \"the help,\" all right. Ed Morrissey tweeted back to Shapiro: \"The secret to success in life: Find someone who loves you as unconditionally and fiercely as the mainstream media loves the Obamas.\" Except they're not \"mainstream\" at all. These \"objective newspapers\" are blatantly leftist partisan rags, as they demonstrate on a daily basis.\n\nMichelle Obama, please stop pretending we're all racists. [Scroll down] To be honest, I struggle to take her seriously and always have. I have no knowledge of her personal relationships, her heart, her example in the home, or any submission she may or may not render to Christ. That means I can only make judgments based on the fruits that evince themselves in her public character — fruits like her vocal lamentation over the Supreme Court's decision to allow the people to decide abortion law for themselves. Expressing her \"heartbreak\" that some states might forbid the practice of dismembering infants whose parents deem them inconvenient, Michelle fretted how the Court's ruling that ended judicially mandated abortion rights was a \"horrifying decision\" that would lead to \"devastating consequences.\" The hundreds of thousands of infants that will be given a chance at life might dispute that characterization. And now, peddling her newest book, Michelle is hitting the circuit to offer a less important, but equally bizarre take: how the racist American public wasn't ready for her hair when she was First Lady.\n\nMichelle Shines the 'The Light She Carries'. Six years out of office, and the Obamas still esteem themselves oracles of racial justice and authorities of truth concerning America's flaws. As witnessed at the recent unveiling of the Obamas' official White House portraits, in a photo taken in the Oval Office, both Barack and Michelle are positioned shamelessly front and center. Still smarting from the reproof of 2016, the Obamas take any opportunity to publicly defame the character of the political outsider who upset the collective vision Barack hoped Hillary Clinton would set in stone — as well as the people who voted for him. Quelling the pain of being rejected has spurred new and creative ways to tear down those who insulted the couple's ego.\n\nThere's Something Very Strange About The Obama Family. [No excerpt is presented here — read it for yourself if you like.]\n\nShowtime's 'The First Lady,' Starring Viola Davis as Michelle Obama, Is a One-Term Flop. There will be no second term for Showtime's The First Lady, which starred Viola Davis as Michelle Obama. The dramatic anthology series has been canceled after just one season following ridicule from viewers and widespread negative reviews. The series also failed to pick up any major Emmy Award nominations, though it did receive a few nods in technical categories.\n\nMichelle Obama's Changing Sexual Identity. [Scroll down] Two years ago, I decided to take a serious approach to learning about Michelle Obama's background. I started by reading her best-selling 2018 autobiography, Becoming. I could smell the calculation in Becoming from a mile away. This was a political document, meant to set Michelle up for a presidential run, and not an autobiography. Even before I had gotten in deep, I had seen enough of Michelle to distrust the poor little girl from the South Side who was held back in life because of her race shtick that Michelle had been spieling since she first emerged on the national scene. The real identity issue for Michelle Obama, I discovered, is not her gender — trust me, readers — it is that she is more White than she is Black. In fact, Michelle's upbringing and lifelong aspiration to whiteness is her greatest vulnerability. [...] So while Michelle is female, it is her Black authenticity, or lack thereof, that has been her major struggle throughout her life, one surprisingly similar to that of her husband Barack.\n\nWhy I pray that Michelle Obama runs in 2024. We all know that Barack Obama is having his third presidential term in the form of the senile presidency of Joe Biden. Just ask Valerie Jarrett. The transformation of America and its circling-the-bowl-descent to Venezuela is proceeding apace. But what is the Left to do when its sock puppet president can no longer walk or talk or when his family's criminal dealings become too large for even the corrupt media to conceal? How do you continue a shadow presidency then? Enter Michelle Obama. It is true that her hatred for the America of the Founding Fathers or even the \"Greatest Generation\" is almost embarrassingly palpable. Remember: \"For the first time in my adult lifetime, I am really proud of my country,\" all because her husband was nominated to run for president? But I have every confidence that a servile, corrupt mainstream media will be able to airbrush that blemish away.\n\nHere comes Barack Obama's fourth term:\n\nMichelle Obama Is Running for President in 2024. [Scroll down] The CPAC crowd, and conservatives in general, have failed to realize that the ever present Michelle Obama was a potential Democrat presidential candidate. This is largely because Michelle Obama launched a cover story for her intense political activity back in 2008 that goes like this: \"Michelle hates politics.\" The media have faithfully sustained the ruse — when they discuss likely Democrat contenders in 2024, they typically leave Michelle off the list. The Obamas needed this cover story to undo the damage that the increasingly shrill Michelle was doing to her husband's campaign in 2008. In February of that year, when she told a crowd in Madison, Wisconsin, \"For the first time in my adult lifetime I'm really proud of my country,\" Barack's advisers knew they had to reel her in. In the days following, the angry Chicago culture warrior mellowed into the amiable \"Mom in Chief.\"\n\nMichelle Obama leads furious criticism of SCOTUS overturning of Roe v. Wade. Michelle Obama and Amy Schumer are leading the furious public criticism of the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade today — with the former First Lady slamming the move as 'horrifying' while warning that it will have 'devastating consequences' for women across the US.\n\nMichelle Obama's Get Out the Vote Event in L.A. 'Sparsely Attended' Despite Selena Gomez Appearance. Actress, producer, and pop singer Selena Gomez touted Michelle Obama at the first-ever, but sparsely attended, When We All Vote Culture of Democracy Summit, in L.A. on Monday. \"This work is incredibly important to me, especially when I think about the people who sacrificed so we can all exercise our right to vote,\" Gomez said as she introduced the former first lady, according to PopSugar.\n\nMichelle Obama's brother and his wife sue $24,000-a-year Milwaukee school for kicking their nine and 11-year-old 'model student' children out. The brother of former first lady Michelle Obama and his wife are suing their children's private school alleging that administrators expelled their two sons after they complained of racist bias during virtual lessons. Craig and Kelly Robinson filed a lawsuit against the $24,000-a-year University School of Milwaukee Pre-K-12 school this week after alleging that the private institution used words like 'plantation' inappropriately during lessons. They also claim that teachers were inconsiderate to a wide variety of socio-economic backgrounds. The complaint alleges that the school retaliated against their family — whose kids are aged nine and 11 — after they submitted reports in January and March 2021 about concerns they had over racial and socio-economic bias they reportedly overheard during virtual learning last year.\n\n2024 chatter reveals Democratic nervousness. Speculation has begun about the 2024 Democratic presidential ticket, almost three years before the election. Some of the suggestions are blasted as risible. But the early chatter itself reveals the nervousness that permeates the party. [...] Straddling the line between reality and fantasy is a long-cherished notion for many Democrats: a Michelle Obama candidacy. The former first lady would be a formidable contender. But she has been crystal clear in statements stretching back years that she has no interest in elected office.\n\nObama Aims To Send Thousands Of Lawyers To \"Protect American Voters\". If there was a ranking of White House first ladies (and historians were honest about it), Hillary Clinton and Michelle Obama would most likely be ranked one and two in terms of least liked. Neither woman understood the role of first lady and it showed — and still shows. Instead of retiring on a beach house while counting all the millions she and Barack \"earned\" after leaving the White House, Michelle remains intent on staying in the public eye. But why? Who is begging for her to come back?\n\nConservatives Would Be Foolish to Not Take Michelle Obama Seriously. Former First Lady Michelle Obama recently indicated she would be getting her hands dirty in the 2022 midterm elections. On Monday, she announced her foundation, When We All Vote, in conjunction with 30 other organizations, plans to recruit and train at least 100,000 volunteers to register new voters. She also vowed to register one million new voters this year in the lead-up to the elections in November.\n\nJoe Rogan Predicts Michelle Obama Would Beat Trump In 2024: 'If She Runs She Wins'. Podcaster Joe Rogan believes that if Former First Lady Michelle Obama decides to run for President in 2024, she will win. \"Michelle Obama and they're going to bring in Harris,\" Rogan said on The Joe Rogan Experience podcast about who he thinks the Democrats will run in 2024. \"Harris comes back as the Vice President and Michelle Obama is the President. We get a double dose of diversity.\" Rogan continued that the Obama and Harris ticket will be going against former President Donald Trump and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis (R-FL.) \"Trump and DeSantis together,\" Rogan said. \"They have to make a super team. That's the only way they win.\"\n\n'Oprah in waiting': Michelle Obama could be eyeing rumored arch-enemy's job. Former first lady Michelle Obama's recent behavior has some speculating that she's either eye a job as a TV talk show host, eyeing an Emmy or eyeing trying to replace the one and only Oprah Winfrey. This week she made an appearance on \"The Rachael Ray Show,\" a syndicated cooking show starring celebrity cook Rachael Ray.\n\nThe Editor says...\n\nI had heard of Rachael Ray, but until this moment I didn't know why she's famous or why she has a TV show.\n\nPoll: Harris, Michelle Obama lead for 2024 if Biden doesn't run. Vice President Kamala Harris and former First Lady Michelle Obama are in the lead for a 2024 presidential run if President Biden decides not to try for a second term, a new Hill-HarrisX poll found. The poll found Harris in the lead among likely candidates, with 13 percent of respondents supporting her. Michelle Obama came in second at 10 percent.\n\nWho is really behind the attacks on Kamala Harris? Likely the other woman who would be queen. [Scroll down] They are not going to let Kamala Harris hold the title of \"first Black female President.\" That honor is to be bestowed upon another very high-profile woman whose family name and political values are more in keeping with those of Joe Biden. That woman is none other than Michelle Obama and I believe it is the Obama political machine, using Ron Klain as an anonymous director, who is behind the most recent attacks on our Vice President. Obama v. Harris; a female cage match for whom there is nobody to cheer.\n\nThe Disturbing And Shocking Plan To Replace Kamala Harris. [Scroll down] It begins with the premise that Harris must go before Biden does. Two names were mulled over. They see Pete Buttigieg as a malleable young figurehead, figurehead being the operative word. [...] The other name that is a constant is Hillary Clinton. [...] The answer is clear, the problem is solved, according to my source, by selecting Michelle Obama. Money, the machinery of power, the media will be behind her. The reason she could not be persuaded to run for President in 2020 was that she was afraid of being defeated. That problem is solved if she is eased into power in stages. First, she will be called upon to fill the vice-presidential vacancy a departing Kamala Harris would leave. And then, probably before the 2022 mid-term elections, Biden will be asked to step down gracefully by those pulling the strings, and by Jill Biden as well, to allow Michelle Obama to become the caretaker president leading up to 2024. This will, they hope, swing the polling in their favor for the Primaries. Race and gender will be an even louder drumbeat leading up to 2024 with Michelle Obama in the White House. By 2024, the propaganda will be so loud that it will be considered treasonous for the people to vote against a Black, female president in 2024.\n\nBezos gives $100 million to Obama Foundation, nonprofit's largest single gift. Former Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos donated $100 million to former President Barack Obama's private foundation, the nonprofit's biggest single gift to date, the Chicago-based foundation announced Monday [11/22/2021]. Mr. Bezos, who owns The Washington Post, made the donation in honor of the late Rep. John Lewis. The plaza where the Obama Presidential Center is located will be renamed for the civil rights activist. \"Freedom fighters deserve a special place in the pantheon of heroes, and I can't think of a more fitting person to honor with this gift than John Lewis, a great American leader and a man of extraordinary decency and courage,\" Mr. Bezos said in a statement released by the Obama Foundation. \"I'm thrilled to support President and Mrs. Obama and their foundation in its mission to train and inspire tomorrow's leaders.\" Mr. Bezos' fortune has been estimated at $210 billion.\n\nThe Editor says...\n\nAs I see it, this is a down payment on the influence Mr. Bezos hopes to buy in the upcoming Michelle Obama administration. At this point, it just looks like a charitable donation. Clever. Mr. Bezos must know something, because $100 million is a lot of money, even for him.\n\nCandace Owens dismantles Michelle Obama for acting like she's 'Oppressed'. Former first lady Michelle Obama was acting like she was oppressed in a recent video. Candace Owens just absolutely unloads on the rich and wealthy Obama family who is clearly doing better than many others. Owens points out several hilarious points and even Tucker started laughing, such as the Obama's having Secret Service around them and not even turning their own doorknobs. Owens slams Michelle Obama for using her skin color to act like she's oppressed and for her to send some of that rich and wealthy oppression to the rest of us. [Video clip]\n\nMichelle Obama: 'You wanna hang out with us? Get your vaccine'. Michelle Obama said Monday [5/10/2021] that her new rule for people visiting with her family is they have to be vaccinated against COVID-19. \"You wanna hang out with us? Get your vaccine,\" the former first lady told Gayle King during a wide-ranging interview on \"CBS This Morning.\" \"Get all of it. Finish it up. And then we can talk,\" she said. \"So I urge everybody out there, within the sound of our voices, please, please get the vaccine. It's time.\"\n\nThe Editor says...\n\n[#1] How many people are eagerly waiting to visit Michelle Obama? Is immunization the only reason we can't all come by and \"visit?\" [#2] Why is this a top priority? The vaccine isn't that good, and the disease isn't that bad. The more cheerleading I see for this vaccine — which I've never seen for any other vaccine — the more I consider my inference reasonable: There's something sinister about this vaccine (if that's what it is), and nobody really knows what the long-term side-effects are.\n\nMichelle Claims to 'Live in Fear,' Barack Actually Does. On Friday's [5/7/2021] broadcast of \"CBS This Morning,\" Michelle Obama made the delusional claim, one among several, that \"many of us still live in fear as we go to the grocery store, or walking our dogs, or allowing our children to get a license.\" Had Michelle attributed that fear to a wariness of black drive-by gang bangers or street muggers, it might have made some sense. But her fear, she implied, was of racist police. Barack Obama knows better, but he has lived in fear as well. [...] Not surprisingly, as I learned in researching my forthcoming book, Barack Obama's Promised Land: Deplorables Need Not Apply, there is no one Barack fears more than wife Michelle, his personal emissary from the world of authentic African-Americans.\n\nMichelle Obama says she fears for her daughters when they drive amid police shootings. Former first lady Michelle Obama fears for her daughters when they get behind the wheel of a car amid police use-of-force incidents, she said. Obama is \"breathing a sigh of relief\" after former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin was found guilty of unintentional second-degree murder, third-degree murder, and second-degree manslaughter in the death of George Floyd, though she said there's \"still work to be done.\" \"Many of us [black people] still live in fear as we go to the grocery store or walking our dogs or allowing our children to get a license. I mean, just imagine — [my daughters] are driving, but every time they get in a car by themselves, I worry about what assumption is being made by somebody who doesn't know everything about them,\" she said of her daughters, Malia and Sasha, in an interview with CBS News released Friday [5/7/2021].\n\nThe Editor says...\n\nI find that difficult to believe. Doesn't the entire Obama family have 24/7 Secret Service protection? Do the Obama daughters actually drive by themselves? Isn't that a liability issue?\n\nMichelle Obama: Black Lives Matter 'taking to the streets because they have to'. Michelle Obama said in a new interview that Black people live with a constant fear of discrimination and injustice and that Black Lives Matter activists are \"taking to the streets\" not because they want to, but \"because they have to.\" In an interview with \"CBS This Morning\" that will air Monday [5/10/2021], the former first lady said there's still a long road ahead after former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin was convicted last month in the murder of George Floyd. \"We know that while we're all breathing a sigh of relief over the verdict, there's still work to be done,\" Mrs. Obama said.\n\nMichelle Obama's on Coronavirus Quarantine: 'I'm Tired of My Husband' — Need Some 'Other Energy'. Former first lady Michelle Obama joked Monday [3/22/2021] on NBC's \"The Kelly Clarkson Show\" that she was \"tired\" of her husband, former President Barack Obama, during the coronavirus pandemic lockdown. Clarkson said, \"When I went to the White House, I asked Dr. Biden what is the first thing she would do post-pandemic. So we know you are knitting now. She said, 'get a martini and fries.' So what are you going to do after knitting?\" Obama said, \"I need to just remind Jill that they actually do have plenty of fries and martinis at the White House. You don't need to wait. They got it all there. But I think maybe what she meant is that she wanted to have fries and a martini with some makeup on out in a restaurant somewhere. I'm in that same place, too.\"\n\nMichelle Obama Launching Netflix Kids Show 'Waffles And Mochi' About Healthy Eating. Former first lady Michelle Obama is launching a new Netflix kids show titled Waffles and Mochi that will promote healthy eating and diverse foods from different cultures. Michelle Obama announced that the show will debut on Netflix on March 16. \"I'm excited for families and children everywhere to join us on our adventures as we discover, cook, and eat delicious food from all over the world,\" she tweeted.\n\nThe Editor says...\n\nPrograms of this sort could be hosted by any completely-unknown actor or actress, and the target audience wouldn't know the difference. The only purpose of having Michelle Obama narrate this production is to keep her face in public view, and soften up her image in preparation for a future presidential run. Since Biden's presidency is turning out to be Barack Obama's third term, Michelle's would be Obama's fourth term.\n\nCrazy 2020 Is Dead! Long Live Crazier 2021!. [Scroll down] Multimillionaire Michelle Obama, who seems seldom to allow a serious crisis to go to waste, was calling for the complete weaponization of social media and the permanent banning of Trump. A scared Mark Zuckerberg seemed to agree. The multibillionaire had infused $350 million of his own money into key preselected precincts to boost voting turnout in a way the Left in the old days would have called the dark money that undermines democracy. A day after Michelle Obama's call, Trump coincidentally was indeed banned from Twitter \"for life,\" along with a number of conservatives, and \"indefinitely\" canceled from Facebook.\n\nMichelle Obama Gave The Order for Big Tech to Delete President Trump From Social Media Platforms. It really is a thing to behold the Left's active effort to send all the riots, unrest, and fires of the past several years down the memory hole. When Ferguson, Missouri, was set on fire by Black Lives Matter and Lisa Fithian-trained shock troops, no one called for Barack Obama to be taken off Twitter, Facebook, or any other social media. However, his wife, Michelle Obama, this week called for the permanent removal of President Trump from all social media platforms because of Wednesday's siege at the Capitol Building. The next day he was.\n\nMichelle Obama calls on tech giants to permanently ban Trump. Former first lady Michelle Obama condemned what she said was President Trump's role in kindling dangerous and violent protests in D.C. on Wednesday, calling on the country's major technology companies to permanently ban the president from their respective platforms. Obama characterized the pro-Trump protesters as a \"gang\" who \"laid siege to the United States Capitol,\" adding that social media giants needed to take action to prevent this type of \"monstrous behavior.\" \"Now is the time for Silicon Valley companies to stop enabling this monstrous behavior — and go even further than they already have by permanently banning this man from their platforms and putting in place policies to prevent their technology from being used by the nation's leaders to fuel insurrection,\" Obama wrote in a statement.\n\nMichelle Obama Urges Social Media Companies To Permanently Ban Trump. Now that Congress has cleared the way for Joe Biden's return to the White House, it is payback time for the resistance and President Trump is at the top of the list. The final obstacle to the former vice president's media-assisted drive to retake power for the Democrats was removed when his successor Mike Pence turned on Trump and let the fraud that swung the election stand. Then following a march on the U.S. Capitol culminating in a brief occupation by a diverse mixture of Trump supporters and Antifa provocateurs that provided all the material that was needed to label the POTUS as a terrorist leader, Facebook and Twitter moved early and banned Trump from his accounts.\n\nMichelle Obama chastises 'infantile and unpatriotic' Trump over Capitol riots. Michelle Obama chastised President Donald Trump over Wednesday's riots at the Capitol, calling him \"infantile and unpatriotic\" before delivering an emotional critique of how police responded to the mob as compared to this summer's Black Lives Matter protests. In a statement posted to social media on Thursday, the former first lady said the riots were a \"fulfillment of the wishes of an infantile and unpatriotic president who can't handle the truth of his own failures.\" Trump supporters descended on the Capitol on Wednesday after the president delivered a speech at a rally against the election results, falsely claiming the election was stolen from him and encouraging the crowd to fight back.\n\nMichelle Obama calls for Trump to be 'permanently' banned as pressure mounts on Facebook, Twitter and YouTube. Pressure is mounting on the nation's leading social media companies to permanently ban Donald Trump from their platforms as former first lady Michelle Obama on Thursday joined the growing number of powerful voices calling for the president's ouster to prevent him from using Facebook, Twitter and YouTube to incite another wave of violence. Trump has been blocked from posting to Facebook and Instagram \"indefinitely and for at least the next two weeks until the peaceful transition of power is complete,\" Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said Thursday [1/7/2021].\n\nMichelle Obama Suggests GOP Should Accept Biden Victory Claim: 'This Isn't a Game'. Former first lady Michelle Obama on Monday [11/16/2020] appeared to urge Trump administration officials and Republican lawmakers to accept corporate media's declaration that former Vice President Joe Biden has won the 2020 presidential election. In an Instagram post, Obama blasted what she described as \"groundless conspiracy theories\" regarding the election and called for a \"smooth transition of power\" from President Donald Trump to Biden.\n\nMichelle Obama slams White House for refusing to start transition to Joe Biden. Former first lady Michelle Obama shamed President Donald Trump and his administration for refusing to start the transition to the Biden-Harris administration because some things are 'bigger than anybody's ego.' 'Donald Trump had spread racist lies about my husband that had put my family in danger. That wasn't something I was ready to forgive,' the former first lady wrote in an Instagram post Monday. 'But I knew that, for the sake of our country, I had to find the strength and maturity to put my anger aside.'\n\nThe Editor says...\n\n[#1] The election isn't over until the Electoral College votes. [#2] President Trump has hardly mentioned Barack H. Obama at all, as far as I know, and if he had \"spread [any] reacist lies\" about Mr. Obama, they would have made front-page news for weeks afterward. [#3] The Obama family has round-the-clock armed bodyguards, who have little or nothing to do, because none of them are in any danger.\n\nMichelle Obama comes out of the woodwork, feeling vindictive: 'Tens of millions' voted for 'lies, hate and chaos'. Joe Biden hasn't even been ratified as president and former first lady Michelle Obama had this to say about all that vaunted national unity he called for: [Tweet] She must have been boiling with hate for years, because last night she simply couldn't contain it. [...] The only thing the Obamas ever stood for was racial division and socialism. Whatever it is they want to connect with, it's not what unites us. It sounds like she wants to bludgeon us with socialist re-education camp force, so that beaten into submission, we will unite, pledging fealty to the permanently ruling party. Had enough? This is one bitter woman, seething for all four years of Trump's presidency, waiting for her moment of vindictive revenge. There's not a compassionate word in there in her explanation of what Joe Biden claims to be 'healing' and 'unity.'\n\nMichelle Obama Demonizes 70 Million Americans Who Voted For Trump. Former first lady Michelle Obama demonized tens of millions of Americans on Saturday after news organizations declared Democrat presidential nominee Joe Biden the winner of the 2020 election — despite the fact that ballots are still being counted and the Trump campaign has filed lawsuits in several states — claiming without evidence that those who voted for President Donald Trump voted to support \"lies, hate, chaos, and division.\"\n\nMichelle Obama Unleashes on the 70 Million Americans Who Voted For Trump. On Saturday [11/7/2020], former First Lady Michelle unleashed on the 70 million Americans who voted for President Donald Trump in the 2020 election. Obama stated that those who voted for President Trump support \"lies, hate, chaos, and division.\"\n\nExposing Liberals' 'Tiny Fraction' Lie. In a recent podcast, Michelle Obama, as she continues to shed her \"no red state nor blue state America but just United States of America\" skin to reveal a ruthless, myopic partisan looking to settle scores from fights unknown while making clear to those paying attention how America became so much more divided after the Obama presidency, complains that the opposition to the protesters is \"once again patently false, morally wrong, and racist.\" After all, she insists, the violence is committed by just a \"tiny fraction\" of the protesters. [...] First of all, the assertion of a tiny fraction is an absurdity. An estimated 570 riots were violent during the George Floyd protests, 19 people died during 14 days of those protests, and approximately 2 billion dollars of damage has accrued from all this peace. The magnitude of damage from a tiny fraction strains credulity, especially given the opportunity for live viewing of so many of these riots, in which looters and harassers are clearly more than small fractions, while the other participants, if any, cheerlead with venomous gusto.\n\nAre Americans Tired of Being Called 'Racist' Yet? What is \"racism,\" and why do Democrats so relentlessly accuse Americans of it? It is necessary to put scare-quotes around \"racism\" nowadays, because the word has been quite nearly stripped of meaning by its constant overuse as a political epithet. Depending on the context, sometimes \"racist\" is merely a synonym for white person (which seems to be the message of Robin DiAngelo and other proponents of Critical Race Theory), but during election season in the United States, it seems that \"racist\" is synonymous with Republican. It is this purely partisan definition of \"racist\" that former First Lady Michelle Obama demonstrated this week in a remarkable 26-minute video campaign ad for Joe Biden. Mrs. Obama heaped praise on the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement as \"an overwhelmingly peaceful movement for racial solidarity.\" In fact, BLM is an avowedly Marxist revolutionary organization that has inspired the murder of police officers and incited violent riots nationwide. Of course, anyone who points out this fact is immediately subject to denunciation as a \"racist,\" and the purpose of Mrs. Obama's video was to point the finger at President Trump.\n\nPresident Trump retweets Michelle Obama's 'world on fire' video. In case America didn't get the message during the Obamas eight years in the White House, former first lady Michelle Obama is above reproach. The mainstream media fawned over Mrs. Obama and went out of their way to ensure the country only saw her... ahem, best side. And when President Donald Trump dared to retweet a post mocking her, the reaction was swift. It all began with an over-the-top video Mrs. Obama released trying to spur her low information followers to vote. She called Trump a \"racist\" for talking about the rampant rioting that swept the country after the death of George Floyd. At best, the former first lady misled the country when she claimed that \"only a tiny fraction of demonstrations have had any violence at all.\" At worst, Obama blatantly lied.\n\nMichelle Obama Sidelines Rioting Facts To Play The Race Card Against Trump Again. In a misleading video Tuesday [10/6/2020] urging Americans to vote for former Vice President Joe Biden, Michelle Obama continued the left's false narrative about Black Lives Matter, saying the movement is based on \"racial solidarity\" and has been \"mostly peaceful.\" Concerning the riots that overtook many of America's cities beginning at the end of May, Obama said President Donald Trump has pinned the violence \"on what's been an overwhelmingly peaceful movement for racial solidarity. It's true,\" the former first lady said in the video, fraught with divisive language and hyperbole. \"Research backs it up. Only a tiny fraction of demonstrations have had any violence at all.\" While most of the protests remained peaceful during the day, many evolved into lawlessness after the "
