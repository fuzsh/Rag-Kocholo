Faced with a world in turmoil and fascism on the march, a small group of Antioch Col- lege faculty met to discuss the founding of a review. In 1941, they launched the Antioch Review, a quarterly publication. The Re- view’s first editorial began with: “It takes, perhaps, uncommon brashness to plunge into the intellectual struggle at a time which Max Lerner has so aptly described as that of ‘the breaking of nations.’ When values are everywhere toppling in the high winds of conflicting dogmas, there are those who would seek refuge in a quiet cloister or an ivory tower. Such an escape is not unattrac- tive; it is impossible.” More than 75 years later, the Antioch Review remains a publication of critical and creative thought that prints award-winning fiction, essays and poetry from prominent and promising authors and poets. The Review, published by Antioch College and headquartered on the Antioch campus, is identified variously as a literary journal, a scholarly quarterly and a little magazine and has attracted an international reader- ship who have an active interest in culture: the arts, politics and current affairs. Regardless of formal reputation, creative authors, poets and thinkers have found a friendly reception in the Review. Its authors are consistently included in Best American and Pushcart Prize anthologies. The Review was a finalist for the National Magazine Award in 2009 (Essays), 2010 (Fiction), 2011 (Essays & Criticism) and 2015 (Fiction). Subscriptions and single copies are avail- able online at review.antiochcollege.edu, on Antioch’s campus (call first, 937-769- 1365), or via mail order (P. O. Box 148). Single copies are also sold locally at Mills Park Hotel, Sam & Eddie’s Open Books, Tom’s Market and Town Drug.
