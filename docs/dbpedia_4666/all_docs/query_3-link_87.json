        "text": "AMONG MANY ACCOMPLISHMENTS IN HER LONG TENURE IN PUBLIC MEDIA AND RADIO, WALLACE WAS INTEGRAL IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF NPR’S WEEKEND EDITION SATURDAY AND SUNDAY, AS WELL AS SPEARHEADING THE DEVELOPMENT AND LAUNCH OF KQED’s FLAGSHIP PROGRAMS—FORUM AND THE CALIFORNIA REPORT\n\nSeptember 18, 2018, San Francisco, CA — Jo Anne Wallace, Vice President and General Manager of KQED Radio, has announced her retirement from her position at the station in late November 2018. In her distinguished career in radio and public media, Wallace has been a central figure in a number of critical moments in the development of NPR’s growth nationally and KQED Public Radio’s ascendance to one of the most-listened to radio stations in the country.\n\nAt KQED, Wallace shepherded KQED Public Radio’s massively successful transition of format from music to news and public affairs, and she led the development of KQED’s long-running and popular programs Forum and The California Report. Earlier at NPR, Wallace helped bring Car Talk and Fresh Air to the network for national distribution. They would become two of the network’s most iconic and listened-to programs.\n\nWallace’s radio career started out in 1969 as a volunteer at WYSO, a tiny experimental radio station at Antioch College in Yellow Springs, Ohio. She would become manager of the station in 1973, making her one of the first four women station managers in public radio at the time. From there Wallace left to briefly manage KPFA in Berkeley, the first listener-supported station in the country. And from 1978 to 1980, she was station program manager of WGBH Radio in Boston.\n\n“Jo Anne Wallace is one of the superstars of public radio and we are so fortunate that she dedicated 28 years of her career to KQED,” says KQED President and CEO John Boland. ”She built the most successful public radio station in the nation and the people of the Bay Area have been the beneficiaries. She has also been a generous and collaborative colleague to everyone at KQED and she will be missed.”\n\nIn 1981, she joined NPR as Director of Administrative and Planning Director in the network’s News Division, where she served for nine years. In this position, Wallace was engaged in program development, financial planning and partnerships with member stations. Under her leadership, the network launched Weekend Edition Saturday and Weekend Edition Sunday and participated in the acquisition of the interview program Fresh Air with Terry Gross, produced by WHYY in Philadelphia. She also would help persuade skeptical NPR execs to acquire and distribute a quirky and light-hearted program about car repair out of WBUR in Boston. Car Talk with Tom and Ray Magliozzi would eventually become NPR’s most listened-to program in the network after it was acquired in 1986.\n\nWallace joined KQED in 1990 as General Manager of KQED Public Radio. Three years before, KQED Public Radio had begun to transition from news and classical music to an all-news and information format. Under Wallace’s leadership, the station began building its news and public affairs broadcast service with more locally focused programming and acquired national programs.\n\nBy 1991, Wallace had expanded Forum to two hours, and moved it to 9am, following NPR’s Morning Edition. With host Michael Krasny joining the staff in 1993, the popular call-in program expanded its excellent, wide-ranging discussions of regional, national and international issues, as well as in-depth conversations with authors, celebrities and newsmakers. Over the years, Forum has become KQED’s most recognizable radio program among Bay Area audiences. In 1995, Wallace and the station’s editorial team launched The California Report, the only statewide daily news program focused on political and cultural issues, produced by highly respected journalists based in San Francisco and from all across California. Today the program reaches 45 stations in more than 80 communities across California and eastern Nevada with bureaus in San Francisco, San Jose, Sacramento, Fresno, and Los Angeles.\n\nFrom 1998 to 2004, and from 2015 to 2018, Wallace has served three terms as a member of the NPR Board of Directors, and she was elected Vice Chair in her second and third terms. She currently is a member of the Board of Directors of the Station Resource Group, a national organization of leading public radio stations, focusing on station-based strategic issues. She also is a member of the Board of EdSource, an Oakland-based organization which serves California public education administrators, teachers and parents with timely reporting and other information about public education issues.\n\n“All of us at NPR will miss Jo Anne,” says NPR President and CEO Jarl Mohn. “She built one of the most listened to and powerful member stations in America and has been one of our most influential Board of Directors. I always counted on Jo Anne to provide wise counsel and superb guidance, not just on programming but, on all matters of public radio! We look forward to her continued contribution to public radio.”\n\nWallace is a native of Tulsa, Oklahoma and is a graduate of Stanford University, where she earned a B.A. in English. For her contributions to broadcasting and journalism, Wallace has been recognized with an American Women in Radio and Television Award (Golden Gate Chapter), and the Public Radio News Directors' Leo C. Lee Award. After KQED, Wallace plans to consult with public radio stations and producers on audience building and content strategies.\n\nAbout KQED KQED serves the people of Northern California with a public-supported alternative to commercial media.
