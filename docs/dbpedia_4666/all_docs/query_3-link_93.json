There has been so much positive feedback and new business from the community! The experience is wonderful and we are so happy with the way this opportunity has worked out for our business.”\n\n“I once received a call from a guy who said Hey I’m so-and-so, and I own a small garage door company. I don’t need you right now, but I just wanted to let you know that if I ever needed computer help, I’d support you because you’e part of the WYSL family. I’ve been on the air since fall of 2012, and it took me about a year to see consistent results. From then on, I receive 1 new client per month on average from people who listen to my show, who trust and support me because I’m here. WYSL is a mom and pop station, a hidden gem in a cookie-cutter world. Its people are down-to earth people, my kind of people. It’s a place where the truth is still real.”\n\n“This has truly been THE most successful form of advertising we have ever done. Success for us is defined in two forms: 1. Hearing our current clients call us or email us to say that they heard the show and that they are dedicated WYSL listeners 2. Getting phone calls from new clients weekly that say that they have heard us on WYSL and want to schedule an appointment time with us. 3. The fan club,yes people want to meet me and tell their friends they met me! Do I see a return on our investment with WYSL? We calculated that we need to have a at least 5 clients each month to place insurance with us to cover the monthly cost of the show. Does that happen? Yes, it does. A slow week for us is getting only 1-3 new calls generated from the show. The calls are from individuals or couples wanting to have their insurance evaluated. That number grows to 4-12 new clients a month that are ready to switch their insurance or want to do so in the future.”"
