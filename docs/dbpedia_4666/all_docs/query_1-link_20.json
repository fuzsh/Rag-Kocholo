        "text": "I believe that we’re all wired to connect in one way or another. We see it in the teenagers meeting each other through social media despite living half way across the world and the old lady knitting a scarf with the radio playing in the background. Even the most introverted a man has sought connection through the words of an author from the 1600s.\n\nSo you may be asking, what does any of this have to do with co-op? Well, everything actually. For you see, these past few months, I have had the amazing opportunity of working at WYSO Public Radio in Yellow Springs, Ohio as a 2019 Miller Fellow. I’d very much like to share with ya’ll a little bit of what that experience has been like for me and what I’ve learned so far.\n\nI’d first like to start off by saying that working at WYSO has been an absolute dream. I find the people at the Radio Station to be genuine, hard-working, dedicated, kind, welcoming and above all, they aren’t afraid to have a sense of humor. I think that’s also why I have there is so much creative freedom tied to the job. Here’s a bit more about the station:\n\n“WYSO is the Greater Dayton area’s only NPR News station, and we carry their flagship programs, including Morning Edition and All Things Considered. Our own news department delivers local and state news plus public affairs programming and news specials. In addition to NPR, we carry programming from American Public Media and PRX.\n\nWe have thirteen different local music programs, hosted by knowledgeable and dedicated music lovers, most of them volunteers who present hand-selected music from songwriters and bands that reach across generations.\n\nWYSO began broadcasting in 1958, with 19 watts of powers, as a student-run station on the Antioch College campus, on the air for only 4 hours each day. Today, WYSO belongs to the community, with oversight from a seven-member board of directors comprised of community leaders. We broadcast 24/7 with 50,000 watts of power, reaching fourteen counties in southwest Ohio with a potential audience of nearly two million.” – https://www.wyso.org/about-wyso"
