        "text": "Classical music education: Retiring UW-Madison and Wisconsin Youth Symphony Orchestras maestro James Smith gets the monthly ‘Making a Difference’ award from NBC TV Channel 15 | December 29, 2016\n\nALERT: In yesterday’s post about the upcoming house concert of keyboard music by Trevor Stephenson, The Ear listed the wrong date in the headline. It was corrected, but The Ear apologizes and feels a correction is still needed for those who missed it: The concert is on Friday, Jan. 6, at 7 p.m. For more information, go to:\n\nhttps://welltempered.wordpress.com/2016/12/28/classical-music-trevor-stephenson-will-use-a-variety-of-period-keyboard-instruments-to-perform-a-house-concert-of-music-by-baroque-classical-romantic-and-impressionistic-composers-on-jan-7/\n\nBy Jacob Stockinger\n\nIt comes as welcome and heart-warming news at a time when so much news is negative, accusatory and depressing.\n\nMaestro James Smith (below, in a photo by Michael Anderson) — who has been conducting the UW-Madison Symphony Orchestra, the UW-Madison Chamber Orchestra and the University Opera as well as the Wisconsin Youth Symphony Orchestras for 32 years — has received a fine piece of community recognition.\n\nSmith has just received the monthly “Making a Difference” award from NBC TV Channel 15, which also broadcast once again three times WYSO’s traditional concert “Sounds of the Season” on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day.\n\nHere is the 3-1/2 minute video, which includes an interview with Smith as well as testimony from a former student who has gone on to have a professional career in music, about the NBC award:\n\nhttp://www.nbc15.com/content/news/Maestro-making-a-difference–408450735.html\n\nSuch recognition is nothing new for Smith, who has won many honors as well as the esteem of his colleagues, his students and his audiences.\n\nSix years ago, The Ear named Smith as ‘Musician of the Year’ for 2010:\n\nHere is that post:\n\nhttps://welltempered.wordpress.com/2010/12/31/classical-music-uw-and-wyso-conductor-james-smith-is-“musician-of-the-year”-for-2010/\n\nMore recently, The Ear talked about Smith’s upcoming retirement and his post-retirement plans in a post about four major people who will retire this spring from the UW-Madison School of Music:\n\nhttps://welltempered.wordpress.com/2016/12/19/classical-music-four-major-retirements-this-spring-will-put-the-uw-madison-school-of-music-in-a-staffing-bind-and-could-further-hurt-the-standing-of-the-uw-madison/\n\nThe Ear loves Smith’s reply when he was asked by anchor John Stofflet of NBC for advice to his successor:\n\n“Learn from the students,” said Smith, a trained professional and concertizing clarinetist who turned to conducting.\n\nThe Ear, who was a longtime teacher himself, knows the truth of that answer.\n\nThank you and bravo, Maestro Smith.\n\nBravissimo!!"
