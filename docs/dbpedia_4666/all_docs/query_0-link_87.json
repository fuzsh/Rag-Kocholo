Stuart Whitman, Carol Lynley, Roddy'' McDowall and Lauren Bacall .\n\nCommitted to an asylum so that he can investigate a patient who claims he burned the million dollars he stole, an investigator is subjected to numerous shock treatments by a woman psychiatrist who wants to snare the million for herself. DEATH SENTENCE' 8:30 33) 63 Premiere (made for TV, color). Cloris Leachman stars as a juror in a murder case who, discovering that the wrong man is on trial, finds her own life threatened by the real killer her husband. Also stars Laurence Luckinbill.

Dick Clark and Meredith MacRae are hosts. The pageant originates at Binghamton, N.Y .\n\n4:30 (S) Afterschool Special: \"Sara's Summer of the Swans.\" This Is a slow-moving, appealing study of the maturation of a teenage girl. Parents will approve, but this one-hour ABC pastoral drama is so devoid of significant peaks or valleys it may have trouble holding its intended audience. There are nice performances by Heather Totten as the ugly duckling and Reed Diamond as her younger brother. 9:00 (X) Lucas Tanner: Tanner (David Hartman) has a prodigy in his class, a 13-year-old genius (Alfred W.

Fantastique!\" The exercise was not without its faux pas .\n\nOne little boy's pilot light went out and so did his omelet.
