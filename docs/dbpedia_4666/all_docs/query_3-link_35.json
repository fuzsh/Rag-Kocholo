        "text": "For information on the Baltimore/Columbus area 101.1 MHz FCC-licensed broadcast facility prior to December 15, 2001 (i.e., before carrying the callsign WOSA), see article WWCD.\n\nNo Title [[File:WOSA logo.png|250px]]\n\n'\n\nNo Title\n\nNo information\n\nWOSA (101.1 FM) — branded Classical 101fm — is a public radio classical music radio station licensed to Grove City, Ohio and serving the Columbus metro area. It is owned by Ohio State University via \"WOSU Public Media.\" WOSA has multiple repeaters throughout the U.S. state of Ohio, making the station a multiple transmitter station.\n\nIt is the successor to a commercial modern rock station in WWCD; that station relocated to the Baltimore-licensed 102.5 MHz frequency as part of a three-way ownership transaction. Likewise, WOSA's \"Classical 101\" slogan is a reflection of WWCD's long identity as \"CD101.\"\n\nHistory[]\n\nWOSA signed on for the first time on December 15, 2010. However, WOSA's roots date back to WOSU-FM's long history as a classical outlet, airing the format on a full-time basis from 1980 until 2008 as a complement to WOSU-AM, which would air more traditional public radio fare.\n\nStarting on January 14, 2008, WOSU-FM switched to a mixed news/classical format, introducing NPR news magazines during morning and evening drive-times along with assorted NPR and PRI weekend programs. Many of these programs were simulcast with its AM sister station WOSU-AM, which still programmed a separate news/talk format. As a result, WOSU established a 24-hour all classical music service on its HD-2 HD Radio stream and on its web site.\n\nIn June of 2010, The Ohio State University announced that it would purchase the license to legendary commercial station WWCD from owner \"Fun With Radio, LLC,\" who entered into a local marketing agreement with WHIZ Media Group to take over operations and programming (and eventual purchase) of their 102.5 MHz facility.\n\nThe 101.1 facility was given the WOSA call letters, and assumed the 24-hour HD-2 and internet-only all classical music service full-time. In addition, WOSU-FM changed to a news/talk station, operating in tandem with WOSU-AM 820. WOSU Public Media operates the new classical station at 101.1 FM as a non-commercial station. WOSU also converted four of their repeater stations: WOSB in Marion, WOSE in Coshocton, WOSP in Portsmouth and WOSV in Mansfield to repeaters of WOSA. In particular, WOSB and WOSV serve areas north of Columbus that are not served well by the new 101.1 frequency.
