We were on the air four hours a day back then with local public affairs and music programming. Today we broadcast 24 hours a day, seven days a week with 50,000 watts of power and we reach twelve counties in Southwest Ohio with a potential audience of more than one million.\n\nWYSO also broadcasts in HD, we stream our programming live on our website, and our stories are available on NPR One. Many of our programs are also available as podcasts. WYSO is the Miami Valley’s only NPR News station, and we carry their flagship programs, including Morning Edition and All Things Considered."
