        "text": "Today from The Ohio Newsroom\n\nListen Online Here!\n\nTune in to FM 91 at 6:43 a.m. and 8:43 a.m for Today from The Ohio Newsroom!\n\nThe program's mission is to connect Ohioans to news and neighbors across the state, bringing untold stories from outside our metropolitan areas to light.Today from The Ohio Newsroom is the result of a robust collaboration between Ohio's public radio stations. The Ohio Newsroom connects the talent and resources of Ohio's public radio newsrooms to deliver original reporting that keeps Ohioans informed about their local communities and the state.\n\nFrom reporting about programs addressing critical shortages in healthcare services in Tuscarawas and Ross counties to stories covering land stewardship in Trumbull and Greene counties, Today from The Ohio Newsroom takes Ohioans on a journey around Ohio that reveals the complexity and diversity of our state and its people. Our talented reporting team includes Erin Gottsacker and Kendall Crawford, two dedicated reporters who travel the state in search of important stories that are relatable to all Ohioans.\n\nClare Roth is the Managing Editor and the guiding force behind Today from The Ohio Newsroom. Roth both leads The Ohio Newsroom team and facilitates collaboration between public radio stations across the state. With a clear vision and dedicated leadership, Roth successfully created and now manages the unique daily news series.\n\nToday from The Ohio Newsroom is a window to the underreported, the unexplored, and the meaningful stories that make us all Ohioans. Listen in, stay connected, and rediscover Ohio.\n\nPublic Media Is the Solution: 95% of Americans live within range of a public radio signal\n\nTo address the local news crisis and to help serve important local and regional news and information to Ohioans, public media organizations across Ohio have partnered to launch The Ohio Newsroom, a formal collaboration of Ohio’s existing network of public radio newsrooms that creates a sustainable model offering news coverage, including stories that may not have otherwise been told.\n\nAs the number of local media outlets continues to decline statewide, The Ohio Newsroom is committed to filling those information gaps and securing the funds needed to continue into the future. The Ohio Newsroom mission and structure are the result of research and modeling funded by The George Gund Foundation and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting for expanding local journalism in Ohio.\n\nPublic media organizations in Ohio have been collaborating for decades and have built strong partnerships. Every public radio station that broadcasts NPR in Ohio is invited to join The Ohio Newsroom, with the following Ohio-based stations already signed on to both participate and contribute:\n\nCincinnati Public Radio (Cincinnati)\n\nIdeastream Public Media (Cleveland/Akron/Canton)\n\nWCSU (Wilberforce, Ohio)\n\nWGTE (Toledo)\n\nWOSU Public Media (Columbus)\n\nWYSO (Yellow Springs)\n\nWYSU (Youngstown)\n\nDisconnected Democracy\n\nToday, three public media organizations in the Ohio Newsroom are teaming up, to bring you a special program as part of the Ohio Newsroom’s new collaborative project called Disconnected Democracy.\n\nWe know Ohioans’ views on the democratic process are polarized. So for the last few weeks, reporters across the state have sought out perspectives from everyday residents on the issues. Where is democracy working and where is it not? Where is the common ground?\n\nListen Now"
