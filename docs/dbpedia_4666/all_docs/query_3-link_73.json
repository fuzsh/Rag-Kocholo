        "text": "bio\n\nI'm an independent journalist based in Durham, NC. I’m the author and creator of The View from Somewhere, a book and podcast about the history of journalistic \"objectivity\" and how it has been used to uphold the status quo and exclude voices from oppressed communities. The book is now available from University of Chicago Press and the podcast is available, too! My new book project, Radical Unlearning, is focused on the relationship between information, interconnection, and social change and is forthcoming from Beacon Press.\n\nI am currently a Ford Global Fellow and the Abolition Journalism Fellow at Interrupting Criminalization, an initiative led by researchers Mariame Kaba and Andrea J. Ritchie. The project aims to interrupt and end the growing criminalization and incarceration of women, girls, trans, and gender nonconforming people of color for criminalized acts related to public order, poverty, child welfare, drug use, survival and self-defense, including criminalization and incarceration of survivors of violence. Through Interrupting Criminalization, I offer trainings, Office Hours for media-makers and communicators, and publications and guides for journalists. My work in this area emerges out of nearly two decades of abolitionist organizing with formations including the Transformative Justice Law Project, Project Nia, and Black and Pink.\n\nWhen I’m not writing and talking about journalism, I’m doing it: I am a regular contributor and former political editor at Scalawag Magazine, and I previously worked for public radio's Marketplace in the New York bureau. From 2013-2016, I was the economics reporter and managing editor at WYSO Public Radio in Yellow Springs, Ohio, and I got my start in radio as a Pritzker Journalism Fellow at WBEZ in Chicago. I focus on the voices of people who are geographically, economically and politically marginalized, and I love stories about water, place and collective action (here's one that touches on all three).\n\nI have a B.A. in religion from Northwestern University (summa cum laude), where I focused on gender variance in medieval Christianity. Before becoming a news hound, I spent many years as a community organizer around prison issues, a queer youth activist, a barista and a sex educator. I was born and raised in Michigan and have deep family roots in South Carolina and New York; in all places, I connect to rivers, estuaries, and the ocean through spiritual practice and a more recent exploration of SCUBA diving.\n\nMy audio work has aired on the Nancy Podcast, Scene on Radio, NPR, Marketplace, WBEZ, WYSO, WKAR, Ohio Public Radio, Michigan Radio and in the 2015 National Queer Arts Festival, and my written work has appeared in the Columbia Journalism Review, Environmental Health News, Scalawag, The Outline, Nieman Reports, Quill, and many others. I've published creative and academic non-fiction in a wide variety of magazines, journals and anthologies, including Obsidian: Literature and Arts in the African Diaspora (2015, issues 41.1-41.2), The Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion (2014, Vol. 30, Number 1), Disrupting the School-to-Prison Pipeline (2012, Harvard University Press), Why Are Faggots So Afraid Of Faggots (2012, AK Press), Unsquared; Ann Arbor Writers Unleash Their Edgiest Stories and Poems (2006, 826Michigan) and From the Inside Out; Radical Gender Transformation, FtM and Beyond (2004, Manic D Press).\n\nI value truth, rigor, curiosity and humility, and I believe we make journalism to make meaning, build community and transform our surroundings. I'm also a poet and an accordion player, and I write a lot of real letters that I send in the mail. Go figure. I'm white and transgender, and my pronouns are \"he,\" \"they\" or \"ze.\" I'm agnostic, even anarchistic, on the Oxford Comma, and believe it is a matter of personal choice.\n\nfellowships, awards and honors\n\nFord Global Fellow (2021-2022)\n\nMember of U.S. cohort for the Ford Global Fellowship, which supports leaders challenging the root causes of inequality internationally.\n\nNieman Visiting Journalism Fellow, Harvard University (2020)\n\nAttended a five-week residency at the Nieman Journalism Lab to study “movement journalism.”\n\nWilliam P.
