        "text": "This was published as “Radio’s Lost Critical History,” Australian Journalism Review Special Edition “Radio Reinvented: the enduring appeal of audio in the digital age,” 36:2, Spring 2015. For an art form to flourish, a sense of expressive continuity – a knowledge of aesthetic roots and a sense of how the new connects with the old – is vitally necessary, both for creative producers and for audiences. Yet, across the world but in the US in particular, soundwork’s critical history remains in a largely neglected state. Imagine the field of literature without access to the vast majority of books; imagine a contemporary cinema that cannot clearly recall what film was like before Star Wars, or Gone With the Wind. This is more or less the state of soundwork today. In this article I focus primarily on the United States, but most of what I say applies to other national contexts as well, with a few notable exceptions that I highlight.\n\nRadio's history has been one of survival, resilience, expansion and continuing re-invention. While in the present no less than in the past, radio's innate flexibility and adaptability to new technology will ensure its ongoing relevance as a medium, this article considers the particular significance of specialist traditions and production cultures unique to a public service broadcasting \" form \" such as ABC Radio National (RN). Drawing on rich seams of historical and comparative research, and on past investigations of \" cultural radio \" developments and forms since the 1930s, the article examines the particular ecology of RN, and the role and legacy of journalists, producer-broadcasters, \" creatives \" and engineers who contribute to re-invention and innovation in media forms, radiophonic expression and content. In doing so it also reveals the historical tensions between information and culture in the national broadcaster, and in the mix between creative and more narrowly defined journalistic practices.\n\nLocated in Mount Airy, North Carolina, WPAQ Radio aired its first broadcast in February 1948 and has since served its community by broadcasting the music of the region, specializing in old-time and bluegrass. By the late 1940s America had witnessed almost three decades of radio history, and many stations had become well known for their country barn dances. Radio helped to change the “hillbilly” music of the 1920s into mainstream country music, a lucrative industry since the 1940s controlled in large part by record companies and commercial advertisers. The music no longer retained its simple ensemble format, but rather evolved into a style dominated by stars. However, not all stations welcomed the change in the music so clearly identified with rural America. Since WPAQ’s first broadcast, Ralph Epperson, the station’s sole proprietor, has been using a mass medium to fight mass media in efforts to protect the regional heritage. In this thesis I will seek to explain the apparent anomaly of WPAQ as one of the few radio stations in America that have continued to broadcast old-time and bluegrass music in the face of commercial pressures to air more mainstream music. Though various articles have documented episodes within the extensive history of WPAQ, this research investigates and presents a more detailed and comprehensive account of the station. This will be achieved by combining documentation with interviews and archives. In addition, I will argue for WPAQ’s importance in ethnomusicology and American music as a preserver of one of America’s distinct musical cultures.\n\nFrom Kath Letch: \"There are various bits of information that I notice popping up around the starting points of community radio (or public radio as it was until 1992) and some of you would be aware that Radio Adelaide has been celebrating its 40th birthday this year as it first went to air in June 1972. This is at times taken as the starting point for the sector though in real terms there were a number of strands that led to the start of public radio in Australia that ran concurrently through the 60's and 70's including the fine music MBS stations, ethnic broadcasting, educational institutions, and a community based public access process that led to stations like 3CR in Melbourne. Some of these came out of various illegal broadcasts like draft resisters radio in the late 60's early 70's (basically pirate radio where a group of tech minded people with a small transmitter would hack into the broadcast band for a period - this occurred in Melbourne with some of the people that set up 3CR). Sadly there's not really any definitive history of community radio in Australia but there are bits and pieces that have been written that outline early developments and it makes the anniversary point a more nebulous concept than it's sometimes referred to in the sector. So it's sort of the 40th and sort of not. The full community broadcasting licensing structure as we now know it actually commenced in 1978/79 though quite a few stations had started broadcasting before then on various forms of temporary and experimental licences and most stations celebrate their anniversaries from their initial broadcast date which makes sense. Below is a summary from the Radio Adelaide website that's based on a PhD a woman called Phoebe Thornley wrote around the late 90's. Some of the information is now dated (ie refers to there now being 140 community radio stations which was correct around late 90's). Please take a glance through the article - it's not that long - and it will explain why I say 'um' a lot when people say it's the 40th anniversary of the whole sector - I guess we could say we're entering our 5th decade!\""
