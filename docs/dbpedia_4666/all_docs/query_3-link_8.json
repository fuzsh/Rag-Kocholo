        "text": "Madison, Wis (Cap Times) – For decades, the Wisconsin Youth Symphony Orchestras rehearsed in what Artistic Director Kyle Knox called “the bowels” of the UW-Madison humanities building.\n\nAfter the organization moved out four years ago, WYSO became scattered, with members practicing in schools, churches and even parking lots throughout Dane County.\n\nNow, for the first time in the nonprofit’s 58-year history, the regional orchestra for young musicians has its own home at 1118 East Washington Ave.\n\n“To go from that … to a building that is unique in the entire United States, it’s nothing short of a miracle,” Knox said. Read the article.\n\nMADISON, Wis. (WMTV) – From what started in the basement of the UW-Madison Humanities building, the Wisconsin Youth Symphony Orchestra has officially opened its doors to the WYSO Center for Music on Tuesday.\n\nWith over 40,000 square feet of rehearsal rooms, studios, and community spaces, WYSO staff say they have created a permanent home for generations of young musicians. They also acknowledged the importance of providing the space for the entire Madison community.\n\n“I don’t think I’d be that person today if WYSO hadn’t shown me the magic of playing in an orchestra,” WYSO Alumnus Flynn Ewer said. “It makes me so happy to see this new building and to know that so many other kids are gonna have their lives changed like WYSO changed mine.”"
