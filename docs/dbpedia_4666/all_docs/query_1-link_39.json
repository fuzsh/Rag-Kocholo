        "text": "While we only have 17 days till Opening Day, Charitable causes should always hold a special place in our hearts. They allow us to give back to the community and make a positive impact. What if we could make our contributions even more memorable? Look at a few ways Met Hospitality can add an exciting twist to our philanthropic efforts! üìå DAY 6: Charitable Causes üéÅ Consider giving tickets to charitable organizations as a feel-good donation. It's not just about the financial contribution; it's about providing an unforgettable experience that can bring joy and positivity to those involved in the organization. üè• Think about donating tickets to patients at a local hospital. A game can provide a much-needed break, a chance to relax, and an opportunity to enjoy a moment away from the hospital environment. It's a unique way to show you care and support their journey to recovery. üéâLet's not forget about our dedicated volunteers. Why not have a drawing to give tickets to a lucky volunteer? It's a fun and exciting way to engage your team and show your appreciation for their hard work. Ready to make your charitable contributions even more meaningful? Catch up with #CarlosMendoza! #MetHospitality #CharitableCauses #CommunityEngagement #EmployeeAppreciation #GiveBack Maximum Respect.\n\nPlease do consider donating to support REPREZENT. Donations are matched, not by a music business I note, but by Aviva, the insurance company, which has some kind of charitable arm. Anything you give will effectively be doubled, making this a great way to help. If you work in music here in the UK, if you have a nice job at a label, I‚Äôd argue you owe it to your conscience to give them some money, because we all make money when artists get successful, and it‚Äôs stations like this that support them when they‚Äôre nobody. Reprezent played Stormzy before anyone else, and look how much money that artist alone has now made for the UK music industry. Reprezent might have your respect, but only money pays the bills. We have to accept a collective responsibility here and step up, and on a wider level it is past time that we accept that the ecosystem is a network of interconnected dependencies. We can do so much better if we do. - Darren https://lnkd.in/eYiC7eAy #SAVEREPREZENT #musicindustry\n\nThis is the second article in a week about this. Look this is a problem wherever there is bureaucracies. People have pet issues then they think that they have unilateral authority to impose fees or create a revenue source on the backs of companies. Whenever you wonder why you pay extra as a business owner for something, this is it. Solution for people‚Äôs pet projects: if there is enough of you then donate or fund it. Ask the project to be a not for profit and give your hard earned money willingly. Campaign to others to give along side you. Create a movement to help contribute to the cause. Last thought: local news is slowly dying because it doesn‚Äôt capture the attentions like the big streaming services. Mostly because it isn‚Äôt entertaining and people don‚Äôt want to see adds every 6 minutes for 3 minutes. What people will watch is the weather. I suggest they go narrow and deflate their budget. Put the advertisers in the show. Sponsor the show. Make it shorter. Reduce the capital needs and capture the attention for limited time. If folks want to watch it ‚Äúat their convenience‚Äù then stream it and advertise the hell out of it or do a paid subscription.\n\nFor-Profit Radio Stations vs. Non-profit Radio Organizations My Thesis: The goal of any radio station, regardless of its profit structure, is to gain and maintain listeners. The station must provide what its audience wants, whether it is news, talk, classical music, or Top 40 programming. For-profit stations depend on advertising revenue to finance their operation, other than in-house promotions such as sponsored concerts or special live remote broadcasts. This requires a larger and more intensive sales effort and the staff to handle it. Non-profit stations rely on listener contributions, corporate sponsorship and funding from government agencies or private institutions. This type of station will have a staff specifically focused on fundraising, grant writing and community-based communication in order to maintain financial support to stay on the air. The question is; Is it likely to get any easier for radio stations to survive? #radiostrategy #radio #radiobrodcasting #radioprogramming #broadcasters #RadioNews #RadioConsultant #broadcastmedia #broadcasting #broadcastinglive #broadcaster\n\nI watched this movie üëá on Wednesday night. I don't watch movies on Wednesday nights. I save them for occasional weekends but when I heard about this movie on Wednesday afternoon I made sure I watched it that night - and I'm so glad I did. As someone who has 'grown up' in corporate and business settings, exposure to the NFP sector over the past few years has been an eye opener. The people who work in NFPs and associated organisations are passionate and hardworking and committed and sustained by such a strong sense of meaning and purpose. They are incredible in so many ways and their work is so necessary. But as someone once put it to me (and I wish I could remember who) 'You are out there doing everything in your power to change the world with $5 spread between you.' That's an impossible and unsustainable task. As a workplace psychologist I worry about the level of burnout I see in the NFP sector. I worry that the passion, hard work, commitment, vision and progress is thwarted by unsustainable business models. I worry that good people are lost and great initiatives stall because the focus is always on survival. The conditions for survival are very different to the conditions required for thriving. This is not the fault of those leading NFPs. It's structural. And if we're going to make positive change in the world we have to start doing things differently. That's why I loved this movie. It provokes us to think differently about how we do things in the NFP and charitable sector. If any of this ‚òùÔ∏è resonates with you, watch the movie - and let's talk about it. Thank you to Dan Pallotta, Stephen Gyllenhaal and your teams for bringing this to the world and to Social Impact Hub for sharing it with Aus/NZ."
