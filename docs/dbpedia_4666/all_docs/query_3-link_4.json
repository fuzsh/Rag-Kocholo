        "text": "WYSO is a listener-supported, community-owned public radio station serving Southwest Ohio with news, music, and storytelling. We produce over 40 hours of original local content each week. WYSO is the Greater Dayton area’s only NPR News station, and we carry their flagship programs, including Morning Edition and All Things Considered. Our own news department delivers local and state news plus public affairs programming and news specials. In addition to NPR, we carry programming from American Public Media and PRX. We have fourteen different local music programs, hosted by knowledgeable and dedicated music lovers, most of them volunteers who present hand-selected music from songwriters and bands that reach across generations. WYSO began broadcasting in 1958, with 19 watts of power, as a student-run station on the Antioch College campus, on the air for only 4 hours each day. Today, WYSO belongs to the community, with oversight from a seven-member board of directors comprised of community leaders. We broadcast 24/7 with 50,000 watts of power, reaching fourteen counties in southwest Ohio with a potential audience of nearly two million. WYSO listeners are engaged, educated, and appreciate excellence. Our listeners are the types of individuals that could be your ideal clients. Corporate support of WYSO will place your business, venue, or nonprofit organization in front of those most likely to become your best customers, subscribers and donors.\n\nWebsite\n\nhttp://www.wyso.org\n\nExternal link for WYSO Public Radio\n\nIndustry\n\nBroadcast Media Production and Distribution\n\nCompany size\n\n11-50 employees\n\nHeadquarters\n\nYellow Springs, OH\n\nType\n\nNonprofit\n\nFounded\n\n1958\n\nSpecialties\n\nmarketing, advertising, non-profit, public radio, reporting, broadcasting, news, interviewing, music, storytelling, and journalism"
