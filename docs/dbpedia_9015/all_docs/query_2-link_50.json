Today, all the internationally recognised countries of Africa are members of the AU, including the Saharan Arab Democratic Republic (Western Sahara). The organisation has its headquarters in Addis Ababa, the capital of Ethiopia.",

        "text": "Cooperation with African partner countries and organisations is a focus of Germany's development policy. The German government's policy on Africa concentrates on the opportunities and the potential of the continent and its people, and on their important role in global politics. The goal of Germany's policy is a close partnership – politically, economically, culturally and socially. This includes solidarity with Europe's neighbouring continent in times of crisis, and joint efforts for a global transformation to enable all people worldwide to enjoy safe and decent lives in an intact environment.\n\nIn that context, the African Union – as the continent's most significant regional organisation and the “voice of Africa” – is the main partner for Germany when it comes to its relations with Africa.\n\nThe AU represents 55 African countries in the international arena, coordinates frameworks and policies that apply to all of Africa, and serves as a platform for pan-African exchange.\n\nGermany has been supporting the AU since 2003 and is now one of its most significant donors. Germany wants to further intensify its relations with the AU and has been supporting the organisation in reaching the goals it has set for itself. Cooperation with the AU focuses mainly on the following core areas:\n\nPeaceful and inclusive societies\n\nAreas of intervention: good governance, peacebuilding and conflict prevention, and (labour) migration\n\nSustainable economic development, training and employment\n\nAreas of intervention: development of the African Continental Free Trade Area, digital technology, transboundary infrastructure programmes, and regional efforts to foster vocational training and employment\n\nHealth, social protection and population policy\n\nArea of intervention: pandemic prevention and control\n\nSince the beginning of its development cooperation with the AU, the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ) has committed a total of about 580 million euros for the organisation.\n\nThe most recent government negotiations with the AU Commission took place on 9 November 2022. On that occasion, the BMZ committed a total of 60 million euros. The two sides placed a new focus on the topics of feminist development cooperation, digital technology, and pandemic control.\n\nA politically stable, economically attractive African continent is not only in Africa's interest but also in Europe's and Germany's interest. A strong, effective African Union can play a key role in achieving that. Through its support for the AU, Germany is helping Africa to make significant progress on political and economic integration.\n\nThe overarching goal of the cooperation is to strengthen the relevance, visibility and efficiency of the AU for its member states and to assist it in reaching its political goals.\n\nThe AU has recognised a total of eight regional economic communities (RECs) in Africa. The RECs are considered as building blocks of the AU. They play an important role in realising the Agenda 2063. The BMZ has close cooperation with four of these RECs: the East African Community (EAC), the Southern African Development Community (SADC), the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) and the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS).\n\nThe outlook for the programme of cooperation is promising. However, positive developments are still being slowed down at present because the administrative and governance capacity of AU institutions is limited in some cases and because their financial resources are inadequate.\n\nPeaceful and inclusive societies\n\nThe focus is on good governance, peacebuilding and conflict prevention, and (labour) migration. Activities include, for example, cooperation with African human rights institutions such as the African Committee of Experts on the Rights and Welfare of the Child and the African Court on Human and Peoples' Rights.\n\nSustainable economic development, training and employment\n\nIn order to foster training and sustainable growth within Africa, Germany uses its development cooperation to support, among other things, the development of the African Continental Free Trade Area, transboundary infrastructure programmes, the development of digital technology, and regional efforts to promote employment and vocational training. One practical example of this type of cooperation is Germany's support for the development of a continent-wide regulatory framework for smart green infrastructure.\n\nHealth, social protection and population policy\n\nIn 2021, Germany and the AU agreed to increase their cooperation on pandemic prevention and control. Among other things, Germany provided the African Export-Import Bank (Afreximbank), a pan-African institution, with 250 million euros in the form of a promotional loan from KfW Development Bank for the procurement of vaccines and investments in local vaccine production."
