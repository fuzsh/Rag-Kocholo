        "text": "While most countries generally have one capital city where all major governmental decisions are made, South Africa has made an exception to this rule. Unlike the usual case, this country operates from three different capital cities.\n\nThe government is divided into three branches: legislative, executive and judicial. In this country, each branch has its capital city. Cape Town is where the legislative decisions are made. Pretoria is the administrative heart, housing the Cabinet and the President. Lastly, Bloemfontein is the judicial centre, hosting the Supreme Court of Appeal.\n\nCape Town\n\nCape Town has held significant importance. Dating back to the late 1500s, the region served as a crucial stop along the spice trade route. By the 1650s, the Dutch East India Company had set up a ship-way station in the area.\n\nIn 1814, Cape Town was under British rule after multiple British attempts to gain control. Then, in 1910, the Cape Colony was formed. It happened when two Boer republics and Natal, which was a British colony, came together to form the Union of South Africa.\n\nPretoria\n\nIn 1860, Pretoria, located in South Africa’s Gauteng Province, was designated as the capital of the South African Republic. This marked the beginning of its significant role as a governmental hub. Notably, Pretoria was the site where the peace treaty to conclude the First Boer War was signed. But during the Second Boer War in 1900, British forces seized control of the capital.\n\nIn 1910, Pretoria was assigned the role of the administrative capital. Nowadays, it hosts most of the foreign embassies in South Africa.\n\nBloemfontein\n\nIn 1846, the city of Bloemfontein was established as a fort by the British. Within two years, both the city and the surrounding area were recognised as the Orange River Sovereignty. By 1854, it turned into the Orange Free State, with Bloemfontein designated as its capital. It’s South Africa’s judicial capital today, even though the Constitutional Court was set up in Johannesburg in 1994.\n\nWhy there are three capitals?\n\nBloemfontein was selected as the location for the judicial branch of the South African government because of its central position. Pretoria became the hub for the Foreign Embassy and various government offices due to its historical importance and proximity to Johannesburg. Finally, Cape Town was chosen as the Parliament site as it previously housed Parliament during the British colonial era."
