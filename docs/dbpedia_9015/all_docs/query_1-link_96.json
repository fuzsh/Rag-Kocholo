Bloemfontein also holds the title of the judicial capital of South Africa and one of the three capital cities in the country, along with Cape Town and Pretoria.\n\nBloemfontein has quite a few names attached to it. With the direct translation of ‘flower fountain’ from Afrikaans, Bloemfontein is nicknamed the City of Roses. This is also due to the city’s abundance of flowers and the annual Rose Festival in October. Bloemfontein is also called Mangaung — the Sesotho name for the land of the cheetahs.\n\nWhile cheetahs once used to roam the plains that we now know as Bloemfontein, today, other cheetahs own the land — the local rugby team, the Toyota Free State Cheetahs! And as one of the most popular sports in Bloemfontein, the local sports lovers really know how to bring the gees!\n\nThe main languages spoken in Bloemfontein are:\n\nSesotho (65%)\n\nAfrikaans (13%)\n\nisiXhosa (7,5%)\n\nSetswana (5,2%)\n\nTop Areas in Bloemfontein\n\nCovering over 235 km2, Bloemfontein offers a range of beautiful suburbs — from the busy CBD and lively student centres to peaceful and family-filled homes outside of the hustle and bustle.\n\nHere’s the complete guide to some of the best areas in Bloemfontein to call home\n\nUniversitas\n\nUniversitas is a very popular area conveniently located near the centre of Bloemfontein but far enough away from the busy CBD to be a peaceful residential area.\n\nUniversitas is a favourite for many students and families as the home to Grey College, Eunice High School and the University of the Free State.
