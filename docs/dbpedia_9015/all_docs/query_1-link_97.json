        "text": "Find all the Free State Towns/Cities information you need.\n\nThe Free State lies in the heart of South Africa, with the Kingdom of Lesotho nestling in the hollow of its bean-like shape. Lying between the Vaal River in the north and the Orange River in the south, the region is one of flat, rolling grassland and crop fields, rising to lovely sandstone mountains in the northeast. The province is the granary of South Africa, with agriculture central to its economy, while mining on the rich goldfields reef is its largest employer.\n\nFree State Towns/Cities\n\nBethlehem\n\nBethulie\n\nBloemfontein\n\nBothaville\n\nBotshabelo\n\nBrandfort\n\nClarens\n\nClocolan\n\nDeneysville\n\nFicksburg\n\nFouriesburg\n\nGariep Dam\n\nHarrismith\n\nJagersfontein\n\nJacobsdal\n\nKoffiefontein\n\nKroonstad\n\nLadybrand\n\nMemel\n\nParys\n\nPhilippolis\n\nPhuthaditjhaba\n\nSasolburg\n\nThaba Nchu\n\nVentersburg\n\nVirginia\n\nVredefort\n\nWelkom\n\nWinburg\n\nFind all the information you need on Free State Towns/Cities.\n\nThe Free State is South Africa’s most centrally located province. It has borders with most other provinces and has Lesotho as its eastern neighbour. Important road and rail links traverse the province, including two of the busiest national highways, the N1 (Cape Town-Johannesburg) and the N3 (Durban- Johannesburg). Plans are in place to leverage this advantage through the creation of development corridors (Gauteng-Free State-KwaZulu-Natal and N8 Corridor), the bolstering of train services (freight and passenger) and the promotion of warehousing and storage opportunities. The Harrismith Logistics Hub (HLH) on the N3 is at the centre of these plans, and some success has already been achieved in persuading companies to locate their businesses there.\n\nvia: https://www.businessinsa.com/free-state/\n\nReturn to the Free State page or visit the Free State towns/Cities page."
