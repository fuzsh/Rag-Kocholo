        "text": "Bloemfontein (pron.: / ˈ b l ʊ m f ɒ n t eɪ n /, Afrikaans pronunciation: [ˈblum.fɔn.ˌtɛi̯n]; Dutch for \"fountain of flowers\") is the capital city of the Free State Province of South Africa; and, as the judicial capital of the nation, one of South Africa's three national capitals – the other two being Cape Town, the legislative capital, and Pretoria, the administrative capital.\n\nBloemfontein is popularly and poetically known as \"the city of roses\", owing to the abundance of these flowers and the annual rose festival held there. The city's Sesotho name is Mangaung, meaning \"place of cheetahs\" and it has been included in the Mangaung Local Municipality since 2000.\n\nBloemfontein is situated on dry grassland at , at an altitude of 1,395 m (4,577 ft) above sea level. The city is home to 369,568 residents, while the Mangaung Local Municipality has a population of 645,455.\n\nHistory\n\nThough historically a predominantly Afrikaner settlement, Bloemfontein was officially founded in 1846 as a fort by British army major Henry Douglas Warden as a British outpost in the Transoranje region, at that stage occupied by various groups of peoples including Cape Colony Trek Boers, Griqua and Basotho. Although modern day Bloemfontein has a reputation for its flowers in an otherwise arid region, the origin of the city's name is unclear. Popular legends include an ox named \"Bloem\" owned by one of the pioneer farmers that was taken by a lion near a fountain on his property, while another story names Jan Blom (1775–1858), a Korana KhoiKhoi leader who inhabited the area. Bloemfontein literally means fountain of flowers or flower spring in Dutch. With colonial policy shifts, the region changed into the Orange River Sovereignty (1848–1854) and eventually the Orange Free State Republic (1854–1902). From 1902–1910 it served as the capital of the Orange River Colony and since that time as the provincial capital of the Free State. In 1910 it became the Judicial capital of the Union of South Africa.\n\nFounding and early days\n\nWarden originally chose the site largely because of its proximity to the main route to Winburg, the spacious open country, and the absence of horse sickness. Bloemfontein was the original farm of Johannes Nicolaas Brits born 21 February 1790, owner and first inhabitant of Bloemfontein. Johann – as he was known – sold the farm to Maj Warden.\n\n1854–1898\n\nAs the capital of the Orange Free State Republic the growth and maturing of the Republic resulted in the growth of the town. Numerous public buildings that remain in use today were constructed. This was largely facilitated by the excellent governance of the Republic (which acquired the term model republic) and the compensation from the British for the loss of the diamond rich Griqualand area.\n\nA railway line was built in 1890 connecting Bloemfontein to Cape Town.\n\nThe writer J. R. R. Tolkien was born in the city on 3 January 1892, though his family left South Africa following the death of his father, Arthur Tolkien, while Tolkien was still a child (1895). He recorded that his earliest memories were of \"a hot country.\"\n\nSecond Anglo-Boer War/South African War\n\nIn 1899 the city was the site of the Bloemfontein Conference, which failed to prevent the outbreak of the Second Boer War. The conference was a final attempt to avert a war between Britain and the South African Republic. With its failure the stage was set for war, which broke out on 11 October 1899.\n\nThe rail line from Cape Town provided a centrally located railway station, and proved critical to the British in occupying the city later.\n\nOn 13 March 1900, following the Battle of Paardeberg, British forces captured the city and built a concentration camp nearby to house Boer women and children. The National Women's Monument, on the outskirts of the city, pays homage to the 26,370 women and children as well as 1,421 old men (Also 14,154 black people, though some sources feel that the records are unsatisfactory, and that this number could be as high as 20,000) who died in these camps in various parts of the country.\n\nRecent history\n\nUntil 1994 the city was the sole judicial capital of South Africa. It remains the seat for the Supreme Court Of Appeal (formerly the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court) and is therefore generally regarded as the judicial capital. It is also an administrative centre with many private hospitals and educational institutions.\n\nGovernment\n\nBloemfontein forms part of the Mangaung Metropolitan Municipality, which was upgraded from a Local Municipality in 2011.\n\nGeography and climate\n\nBloemfontein is located in central South Africa on the southern edge of the Highveld at an elevation of 1,400 metres (4,600 ft), bordering on the semi-arid region of the Karoo. The area is generally flat with occasional hills (koppies in Afrikaans) and the general vegetation is Highveld grassland. Bloemfontein experiences a semi-arid climate, with hot summer days (Jan: max:32 °C (90 °F) min:19 °C (66 °F); frequent afternoon thunderstorms) and cooler, dry winters, often with frosts (July: max:14 °C (57 °F) min:−3 °C (27 °F)). Snow is uncommon but as recently as August 2006 it snowed in the city, with snowfalls occurring again at the airport on 26 July 2007.\n\nClimate data for Bloemfontein Month Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Year Record high °C (°F) 39\n\n(102) 39\n\n(102) 35\n\n(95) 33\n\n(91) 30\n\n(86) 25\n\n(77) 24\n\n(75) 29\n\n(84) 34\n\n(93) 35\n\n(95) 37\n\n(99) 38\n\n(100) 39\n\n(102) Average high °C (°F) 31\n\n(88) 29\n\n(84) 27\n\n(81) 23\n\n(73) 20\n\n(68) 17\n\n(63) 17\n\n(63) 20\n\n(68) 24\n\n(75) 26\n\n(79) 28\n\n(82) 30\n\n(86) 24\n\n(75) Average low °C (°F) 15\n\n(59) 15\n\n(59) 12\n\n(54) 8\n\n(46) 3\n\n(37) −2\n\n(28) −2\n\n(28) 1\n\n(34) 5\n\n(41) 9\n\n(48) 12\n\n(54) 14\n\n(57) 8\n\n(46) Record low °C (°F) 6\n\n(43) 4\n\n(39) 1\n\n(34) −3\n\n(27) −9\n\n(16) −9\n\n(16) −10\n\n(14) −10\n\n(14) −7\n\n(19) −3\n\n(27) 0\n\n(32) 3\n\n(37) −10\n\n(14) Precipitation mm (inches) 83\n\n(3.27) 111\n\n(4.37) 72\n\n(2.83) 56\n\n(2.2) 17\n\n(0.67) 12\n\n(0.47) 8\n\n(0.31) 15\n\n(0.59) 24\n\n(0.94) 43\n\n(1.69) 58\n\n(2.28) 60\n\n(2.36) 559\n\n(22.01) Avg. precipitation days 11 11 11 9 4 3 2 3 4 7 9 10 84 Mean monthly sunshine hours 297.6 251.4 257.3 249.0 266.6 249.0 272.8 285.2 279.0 291.4 297.0 319.3 3,315.6 Source #1: South African Weather Service Source #2: Hong Kong Observatory (sun only 1961-1990).\n\nSuburbs\n\nBloemfontein suburbs include Heidedal to the east and southeast, Bainsvlei, Woodland Hills Wildlife Estate, Brandwag, Ehrlichpark, Fauna, Fichardtpark, Fleurdal, Gardeniapark, Generaal De Wet, Hospitaalpark, Kiepersol, Langenhoven Park, Lourierpark, Park West, Pellissier, Uitsig, Universitas, Westdene, Wilgehof and Willows to the south of the city.
