        "text": "Geography\n\nThe Republic of South Africa is a country at the southern tip of Africa. It borders the Atlantic and Indian Oceans on its southern and eastern coasts. Its neighboring countries are Namibia, Botswana and Zimbabwe to the north and Mozambique and Eswatini to the northeast. The Kingdom of Lesotho is an enclave within South Africa. The territorial state has an area of 1.22 million km² and a total coastline of 2,798 km. The land mass is approximately 3.4 times the size of Germany.\n\nWith a population of 60.41 million people, South Africa has a population density of 49.6 people per km². Around 68.3% of the population live within the cities.\n\nGeographically, South Africa is extremely diverse: in the west is the Namib Desert, in the north the Kalahari Desert. The country is also crossed by several mountain ranges, including the Drakensberg, which reaches its highest point at Mafadi (3,450 meters). The Great Escarpment is a striking geological formation that separates the coastal regions from the higher inland areas over a length of more than 5,000 km (including Namibia and Mozambique). Along the border with Mozambique, the Kruger National Park is one of the most famous and largest nature and game reserves in the world."
