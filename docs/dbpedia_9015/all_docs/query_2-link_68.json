        "text": "The countries of eastern and southern Africa host a vast variety and abundance of the world’s biological and natural resources, including seven of the world’s biodiversity hotspots.\n\nAbout Eastern & Southern Africa Region: Versatility in conserving nature\n\nThe countries of eastern and southern Africa host a vast variety and abundance of the world’s biological and natural resources, including seven of the world’s biodiversity hotspots. Across the 24 countries - From the Horn of Africa to the Cape and including the Western Indian Ocean Islands, the region contains several centres of endemism where species of birds, mammals and plans reside nowhere else in the world. The region is also incredibly socially diverse, with a rich mix of cultures, ethnicities, religions and languages and a colourful blend of traditional customs and beliefs with contemporary societal practices\n\nOur Work\n\nDescription\n\nRecognizing the interdependency of the three pillars of sustainable development - social, economic and environmental, IUCN’s work in Eastern and Southern Africa underscores the fact that sustainable economic development depends on sound environmental management in line with IUCN’s Global Programme goals.\n\nRead the Issues Brief\n\nOur Goal\n\nDescription\n\nIUCN ESARO’s programme of work is guided by core beliefs and principles. We believe that biodiversity and natural resources are central to development and well-being –for current and future generations.\n\nThematic Areas\n\nDescription\n\nCoastal and Ocean Resilience\n\nConservation Areas and Species\n\nDrylands Resilience Land Management\n\nForest Landscape & Livelihoods\n\nIntegrated water resources management\n\nOur Work in ESARO\n\nIUCN ESARO’s programme of work is guided by core beliefs and principles. We believe that biodiversity and natural resources are central to development and well-being –for current and future generations. At the heart of this lies governance –which can either ensure that natural resources contribute to the enjoyment of rights and opportunities for development or act as a driver of a number of challenges, including natural resource conflicts. We also recognise that the complexity of the challenges today are unlikely to be resolved by any one entity and we therefore strive to work in a manner that maximizes IUCN’s unique strength in being able to work in partnership across the different parts of the Union – Government and NGO Members, Commissions of experts and the Secretariat – in order to continue to build and strengthen a collaborative movement for conservation across the region and beyond.\n\nIUCN has been working in ESARO for several decades and officially opened its offices in the region in the 1980s, pioneering a number of conservation initiatives. IUCN ESARO works across 22 countries in the Horn of Africa, East Africa, Southern Africa and the Western Indian Ocean:\n\nIUCN’s offices in this region include: Kenya, Mozambique, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Rwanda\n\n© IUCN ESARO\n\nFeatured work\n\nBrochure\n\nAfrican Solutions for Nature and People: Creating transformative responses to the biodiversity and climate crisis in Africa.\n\nBrochure\n\nIUCN is the world’s oldest and largest global environment organisation that has been finding pragmatic solutions to the most pressing environment and development challenges in Eastern and Southern…\n\nBrochure\n\nThe “Great Blue Wall” (GBW) initiative, endorsed by the World Conservation Congress in 2021, and then subsequently launched at UNFCCC COP26 in Glasgow, is a major Africa-led effort toward a nature…\n\nBrochure\n\nThe SADC TFCA Financing Facility (TFCA FF) is a regional fund established to provide sustainable funding for conservation and management actions in Transfrontier Conservation Areas (TFCAs) in the…\n\nFeatured Projects\n\nProject\n\nBRIDGE promotes cooperation and water diplomacy in the 9 transboundary basins between Ecuador and Peru, and in the Titicaca basin, shared between Bolivia and Peru.\n\nESARO Publications\n\nBrochure\n\nThe “Great Blue Wall” (GBW) initiative, endorsed by the World Conservation Congress in 2021, and then subsequently launched at UNFCCC COP26 in Glasgow, is a major Africa-led effort toward a nature…\n\nBrochure\n\nIUCN is the world’s oldest and largest global environment organisation that has been finding pragmatic solutions to the most pressing environment and development challenges in Eastern and Southern…\n\nBrochure\n\nThe SADC TFCA Financing Facility (TFCA FF) is a regional fund established to provide sustainable funding for conservation and management actions in Transfrontier Conservation Areas (TFCAs) in the…\n\nEastern and Southern Africa Regional Office\n\nNews and resources"
