        "text": "South Africa has one of the continent's biggest and most developed economies.\n\nFor some 40 years it was ruled by a white minority government, when the National Party came to power in 1948 and imposed its policy of apartheid, which legally institutionalised previously existing racial segregation.\n\nAfter decades of international isolation, armed opposition and mass protests, the discriminatory laws began to be repealed from the late-1980s onwards. The country held its first universal elections in 1994.\n\nThe democratically-elected leadership encouraged reconciliation and set about redressing social imbalances, but the economy has struggled.\n\nIn 2022, the World Economic Forum, external warned that South Africa risked state collapse, with record unemployment levels, high crime rates, unsustainable state spending, mismanaged institutions and corruption.\n\nCyril Ramaphosa was sworn in for a second term as president in June 2024, even though his party, the African National Congress (ANC), failed to secure a majority in parliament in the May 2024 elections.\n\nThe ANC, which has governed since the end of the racist system of apartheid in 1994, lost its majority for the first time after the election produced no outright winner.\n\nThe ANC got 40% of the vote, a drop of 17 percentage points, and it lost 70 seats in parliament. However, the ANC subsequently made a deal with its long-time rival Democratic Alliance (DA) which came second with 22% and three smaller parties to form a coalition government.\n\nThe free-market DA, is ideologically at odds with the ANC's social welfare traditions, and seen by many as catering to the interests of the white minority, which it denies.\n\nBut the two political opponents have agreed a common agenda of fixing the country's infrastructure, providing basic services such as water and power, and creating jobs.\n\nThe coalition is a move to the political centre, because the ANC's left-wing and populist breakaway parties rejected the invitation to join a national unity government.\n\nAt his inauguration, President Ramaphosa told South Africans the coalition was committed to reversing inequalities and growing the economy.\n\nBut he also warned that unless it addressed deep inequalities, the country could become unstable, saying despite progress, \"our society remains deeply unequal and highly polarized\" and added \"there are toxic cleavages and an incipient social fragmentation that can easily turn into instability\".\n\nSome key events in South Africa's history:\n\n4th Century - Migrants from the north settle, joining the indigenous San and Khoikhoi people.\n\n1497 - Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama lands on Natal coast.\n\n1652 - Jan van Riebeeck, representing the Dutch East India Company, founds the Cape Colony at Table Bay.\n\n1795 - British forces seize Cape Colony from the Netherlands.
