        "text": "Bloemfontein is a city in central South Africa that serves as the capital of Free State province (formerly Orange Free State). The city is also the judicial capital of the Republic of South Africa. (Pretoria has been designated the country’s administrative capital, and Cape Town serves as the legislative capital.)\n\nBloemfontein, which means “Fountain of Flowers,” is known for its natural and man-made attractions, including the 300-acre (120-hectare) King’s Park and the Franklin Game Reserve. The city, which sprawls across spacious hills, contains the national Court of Appeal, the province’s oldest Dutch Reformed Church, the current seat of the provincial council, and the Old Raadsaal (1849), a one-room house that is now a national monument. Bloemfontein is the seat of the University of the Free State, which was founded in 1904.\n\nThe area’s economic development was spurred in the mid-20th century. After 1948 the nearby goldfields were exploited, and some 15 years later the Orange River irrigation and power project was developed. In the 20th century the city became a geographic hub of South Africa’s transportation systems."
