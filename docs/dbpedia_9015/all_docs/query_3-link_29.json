Here's all you need to know...\n\nWhat country has three capital cities?\n\nSouth Africa is the only country in the world to have three capital cities.\n\nThe three capitals are Pretoria, Cape Town and Bloemfontein.\n\nWhy does South Africa have three capital cities?\n\nSouth Africa’s unique arrangement was designed to ensure that power was shared equally across the country.\n\nCape Town was the capital of Britain’s Cape Colony.\n\nIt still remains as the legislative capital of the country.\n\nHowever a decision was made to divide up the remaining branches of government between Pretoria and Bloemfontein.\n\nThis helped to distribute power across the emerging Republic of South Africa.\n\nWhich other countries have more than one capital city?\n\nNetherlands - Amsterdam and The Hague\n\nMontenegro - Podgorica and Cetinje\n\nMalaysia - Kuala Lumpur and Putrajaya\n\nKingdom of eSwatini - Mbabane and Lobamba\n\nCzech Republic - Prague and Brno\n\nCôte D'Ivoire - Yamoussoukro and Abidjan\n\nChile - Santiago and Valparaíso\n\nBolivia - La Paz and Sucre\n\nSri Lanka - Colombo and Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte\n\nBenin - Porto-Novo and Cotonou\n\nTanzania - Dar es Salaam and Dodoma"
