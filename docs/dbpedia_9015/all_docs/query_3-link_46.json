        "text": "Bloemfontein is one of the three capital cites of South Africa. It is the judicial capital of South Africa, as the Supreme Court is there. In Afrikaans and Dutch, Bloemfontein means \"Spring of Bloem (Bloom)\". It is also known as the city of roses. There are a lot of flowers in Bloemfontein.\n\nHistory\n\nBloemfontein was founded by Major H. Douglas Warden in 1846. It was created as both a fort and a place to live. It became the center of government of the British-controlled Orange River Sovereignty (1848â€“54) and of the Orange Free State (later known as just Free State).\n\nBloemfontein became the judicial capital of South Africa in 1910. It is a place where the government works. It has a lot of hospitals and schools.\n\nGeography\n\nBloemfontein is in central South Africa. It is dry in this part of South Africa. There are a few hills around Bloemfontein. Grass mostly grows around Bloemfontein. The summers are hot, and the winters are cool, but it snowed in August 2006.\n\nEconomy\n\nMuch of the economy of the city is based on canned fruit, glass products, furniture, plastics, and railway engineering. The city saw a large economic growth in the mid-20th century because of the Free State goldfields 160 km (100 mi) northeast of the city. The Orange River project also helped the city grow economically. It is a major source both of hydroelectricity and of water for irrigation and human uses.\n\nSports\n\nThe most popular sports in Bloemfontein are football, rugby, and cricket. In 2010, Bloemfontein will host some FIFA World Cup matches, at Free State Stadium.\n\nFamous people from Bloemfontein\n\nZola Budd, a famous athlete\n\nJ. R. R.
