        "text": "South Africa has nine provinces, each with its own history, landscape, population, languages, economy, cities and government.\n\nSouth Africa’s nine provinces are the Eastern Cape, the Free State, Gauteng, KwaZulu-Natal, Limpopo, Mpumalanga, the Northern Cape, North West and the Western Cape.\n\nBefore 1994, South Africa had four provinces: the Transvaal and Orange Free State – previously Boer republics – and Natal and the Cape, once British colonies.\n\nIn 1910 these four states were united into a single country, the Union of South Africa, under British rule. This became the Republic of South Africa in 1960, under apartheid rule.\n\nIn the 1970s and eighties, under the apartheid doctrine of “separate development”, the map of South Africa was spattered with the odd outlines of the “homelands”.\n\nThese unsustainable states were set up on disjointed parcels of land with no economic value. Laws were passed to make black South Africans citizens of these barren regions, denying black people’s citizenship of South Africa as a whole.\n\nIn 1996, under South Africa’s new democratic constitution, the homelands were dismantled and South Africa consolidated into today’s nine provinces.\n\nJump to:\n\nLand area of the provinces\n\nThere are vast differences in the size of the provinces, from the small and crowded city region of Gauteng to the vast and empty Northern Cape.\n\nThe land area of South Africa’s nine provinces, from smallest to largest:\n\nGauteng: 18,178 square kilometres (1.5% of total)\n\nMpumalanga: 76,495 square kilometres (6.3%)\n\nKwaZulu-Natal: 94,361 square kilometres (7.7%)\n\nNorth West: 104,882 square kilometres (8.6%)\n\nLimpopo: 125,755 square kilometres (10.3%)\n\nWestern Cape: 129,462 square kilometres (10.6%)\n\nFree State: 129,825 square kilometres (10.6%)\n\nEastern Cape: 168,966 square kilometres (13.8%)\n\nNorthern Cape: 372,889 square kilometres (30.5%)\n\nSouth Africa: 1,220,813 square kilometres (100%)\n\nREAD MORE: How big is South Africa?\n\nPopulation of the provinces\n\nThe population of the provinces also varies considerably. Gauteng, the smallest province, has the largest number of people living there – over a quarter of South Africa’s population. The Northern Cape, which takes up nearly a third of the country’s land area, has the smallest population: just over 2% of the national total.\n\nThe population of South Africa’s nine provinces in 2017, from smallest to largest:\n\nNorthern Cape: 1.2 million people (2.1% of South Africa’s total population)\n\nFree State: 2.9 million people (5.1%)\n\nNorth West: 3.9 million people (6.8%)\n\nMpumalanga: 4.4 million people (7.9%)\n\nLimpopo: 5.8 million people (10.2%)\n\nEastern Cape: 6.5 million people (11.5%)\n\nWestern Cape : 6.5 million people (11.5%)\n\nKwaZulu-Natal: 11.1 million people (19.6%)\n\nGauteng: 14.3 million people (25.3%)\n\nREAD MORE: South Africa’s population\n\nCensus counts of provincial populations\n\nSouth Africa has held three censuses in its recent democratic history: in 1996, 2001 and 2011. Over those 15 years, the population of the provinces shifted.\n\nGauteng’s population grew dramatically, overtaking that of KwaZulu-Natal – which saw significant growth of its own. Limpopo, Mpumalanga, North West and the Western Cape also had notable increases in population. By contrast, the populations of the Eastern Cape, Free State and Northern Cape remained fairly static, as people migrated to other provinces.\n\nREAD MORE: Infographic: Census counts of South Africa’s population\n\nPopulation density in the provinces\n\nThe variation in land area and population among South Africa’s population translates into huge differences in population density. Gauteng has an average of 785 people per square kilometre, while the Northern Cape has only three people for each square kilometre.\n\nPopulation density in South Africa’s nine provinces in 2017, from smallest to largest:\n\nNorthern Cape: 3 people per square kilometre\n\nFree State: 22 people per square kilometre\n\nNorth West: 37 people per square kilometre\n\nEastern Cape: 38 people per square kilometre\n\nLimpopo: 46 people per square kilometre\n\nWestern Cape: 50 people per square kilometre\n\nMpumalanga: 58 people per square kilometre\n\nKwaZulu-Natal: 117 people per square kilometre\n\nGauteng: 785 people per square kilometre\n\nREAD MORE: South Africa’s population\n\nProvincial migration\n\nSouth Africans migrate away from poverty to where the jobs are, moving from poorer provinces to the richer ones.\n\nGauteng is South Africa’s wealthiest province, mostly a city region and the centre of the country’s economy. It has the largest population, constantly swelled by migration. The province’s net migration rate (the number of people moving in minus people moving out) was nearly a million between 2011 and 2016.\n\nThe Eastern Cape is the poorest province. Between 2011 and 2016 nearly half a million of its people migrated to other provinces, while only 170 000 or so moved into the province.\n\nREAD MORE: South Africa’s population\n\nProvince and race\n\nThere is also a wide variation in the racial composition of the different provinces’ populations. Census 2011 figures reveal that black South Africans are the majority population group in seven of the nine provinces, comprising from 75% to 97% of the provincial total. Yet they make up less than a third of the population in the Western Cape (26.7%) and under a half in the Northern Cape (46.5%).\n\nThe distribution of a population group can reflect that people’s history in the country.\n\nColoured South Africans are to be found mainly in the Western, Eastern and Northern Cape (respectively 61.1%, 12% and 10.7% of South Africa’s total coloured population) because they are descended from a mixture of slaves brought to what was then the Cape Colony, white immigrants to the colony, and indigenous Africans, particularly the Khoisan.\n\nThe majority (71.6%) of Indian South Africans live in KwaZulu-Natal because their ancestors were brought to Natal in the early 20th century to work on sugarcane plantations. And only 0.3% of Indians live in the Free State (0.1% of the total Free State population), as they were forbidden by law to enter what was then the Orange Free State during the apartheid era.\n\nProvincial distribution also reflects a group’s socioeconomic position. White South Africans, the beneficiaries of the apartheid system, are largely found in the more developed and urbanised provinces of Gauteng (40.4% of the total white population, and 18.9% of the total Gauteng population) and the Western Cape (19.4% of the total white population, and 18.4% of the Western Cape population).\n\nREAD MORE: South Africa’s population\n\nLanguages of the provinces\n\nThere’s considerable variation in home languages between the provinces, according to Census 2011.\n\nIsiXhosa, for instance, is spoken by almost 80% of people in the Eastern Cape, while around 78% of those in KwaZulu-Natal speak isiZulu. IsiZulu is also the most common home language in Gauteng, but at a much smaller percentage. In the Western Cape and Northern Cape, Afrikaans comes into its own.\n\nREAD MORE: The 11 languages of South Africa\n\nThe main languages in each province, according to Census 2011:\n\nEastern Cape: isiXhosa 78.8%, Afrikaans 10.6%\n\nFree State: Sesotho 64.2%, Afrikaans 12.7%\n\nGauteng: isiZulu 19.8%, English 13.3%, Afrikaans 12.4%, Sesotho 11.6%\n\nKwaZulu-Natal: isiZulu 77.8%, English 13.2%\n\nLimpopo: Sesotho 52.9%, Xitsonga 17%, Tshivenda 16.7%\n\nMpumalanga: siSwati 27.7%, isiZulu 24.1%, Xitsonga 10.4%, isiNdebele 10.1%\n\nNorthern Cape: Afrikaans 53.8%, Setswana 33.1%\n\nNorth West: Setswana 63.4%, Afrikaans 9%\n\nWestern Cape: Afrikaans 49.7%, isiXhosa 24.7%, English 20.3%\n\nEconomy of the provinces\n\nGauteng dominates almost all industries in South Africa, except agriculture and mining.\n\nIn 2016 the main industries in each province were:\n\nEastern Cape: government services 21%, trade, catering and accommodation 18%, finance 16%\n\nFree State: government services 15%, finance 14%, trade, catering and accommodation 13%\n\nGauteng: finance 23%, government services 19%, manufacturing 14%\n\nKwaZulu-Natal: manufacturing 16%, finance 15%, government services 15%\n\nLimpopo: mining 25%, government services 18%, trade, catering and accommodation 13%\n\nMpumalanga: mining 20%, trade, catering and accommodation 13%, manufacturing 13%\n\nNorthern Cape: mining 19%, government services 15%, finance 12%\n\nNorth West: mining 30%, government services 12%, finance 12%\n\nWestern Cape: finance 23%, trade, catering and accommodation 15%, manufacturing 14%\n\nThe province’s share of South Africa’s economy\n\nPopulation size correlates with each province’s contribution to the national economy, with Gauteng having the biggest.\n\nThe tiny province punches way above its weight, making up 33.8% of South Africa’s gross domestic product in 2016 and around 5% of the GDP of Africa as a whole. Next is KwaZulu-Natal with 16%, followed by the Western Cape with 13.7%. These three provinces together contribute nearly two-thirds to total economy of South Africa.\n\nIn 2016 the value of each province’s economy, and its share of the total GDP of South Africa, was:\n\nNorthern Cape: R91 billion (2.1% of South Africa’s GDP)\n\nFree State: R218 billion (5%)\n\nNorth West: R280 billion (6.4%)\n\nLimpopo: R312 billion (7.2%)\n\nMpumalanga: R324 billion (7.4%)\n\nEastern Cape: R331 billion (7.6%)\n\nWestern Cape: R596 billion (13.7%)\n\nKwaZulu-Natal: R692 billion (15.9%)\n\nGauteng: R1.5 trillion (34.6%)\n\nGovernment of the provinces\n\nSouth Africa’s provinces are governed, in different ways, on a national, provincial and local level.\n\nNational government\n\nOn the national level, South Africa has two houses of parliament: the National Assembly, and the National Council of Provinces. The second exists to ensure that the interests of each province are protected in the laws passed by the National Assembly.\n\nEach one of South Africa’s nine provinces sends 10 representatives to the National Council of Provinces. Six of these are permanent members of the council, and four are special delegates.\n\nProvincial government\n\nEach province has its own provincial government.\n\nThe provincial legislature has the power to pass laws in certain limited areas. The legislature has between 30 and 80 members depending on the province’s portion of the national voters’ roll.\n\nThe premier – the head of government in the province – governs the province together with other “members of the executive council”, known as MECs. Each MEC has a specific responsibility, such as health, education, tourism and transport.\n\nLocal government\n\nThe nine provinces are each further divided into municipalities. Metropolitan municipalities are densely populated urban areas with major cities – such as Johannesburg or Durban – at their core. District municipalities are larger, less urban regions centred on one or more town or small city. District municipalities are further divided into local municipalities.\n\nThe cities of the provinces\n\nEach of the nine provinces has a provincial capital, the seat of provincial government. These are usually the largest city in the province – Johannesburg in Gauteng, for example, or Mahikeng in North West.\n\nThe exceptions are the Eastern Cape (Bhisho) and KwaZulu-Natal (Pietermaritzburg), which have smaller cities as their capitals for reasons of history. Cape Town in the Western Cape and Bloemfontein in the Free State also stand out for being both provincial capitals and two of the three capital cities of South Africa.\n\nThe provincial capitals and major cities of South Africa’s nine provinces are:\n\nEastern Cape: Bhisho (capital) and Port Elizabeth (major city)\n\nFree State: Bloemfontein (capital and major city)\n\nGauteng: Johannesburg (capital and major city)\n\nKwaZulu-Natal: Pietermaritzburg (capital) and Durban (major city)\n\nLimpopo: Polokwane (capital and major city)\n\nMpumalanga: Mbombela (capital and major city) – also known as Nelspruit\n\nNorth West: Mahikeng (capital and major city) – formerly known as Mafeking, then as Mafikeng\n\nNorthern Cape: Kimberley (capital and major city)\n\nWestern Cape: Cape Town (capital and major city)\n\nSources\n\nCensus South Africa public database\n\nStatistics South Africa Census 2011\n\nStatistics South Africa Community Survey 2016\n\nStatistics South Africa mid-year population estimates 2017\n\nStatistics South Africa gross domestic product, fourth quarter 2017\n\nUnited Nations Statistics Division World Statistics Pocketbook 2017\n\nWorld Bank Open Data\n\nMedia Club South Africa"
