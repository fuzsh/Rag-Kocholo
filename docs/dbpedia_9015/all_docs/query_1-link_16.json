        "text": "Here are the top 10 cities to visit in South Africa, in alphabetical order:\n\nBloemfontein\n\nFondly known as “the city of roses” because of its beautiful blooms and the annual rose festival that is held here, Bloemfontein has numerous historical, cultural, and natural attractions that make it the ideal holiday destination. Bloemfontein is part of the Mangaung Local Municipality – “place where the Cheetahs dwell”. This municipality was formed at the end of 2000 by amalgamating the Transitional Local Councils of Bloemfontein, Botshabelo, Thaba Nchu and two Rural Councils.\n\nBloemfontein is the economic hub of Mangaung and also the commercial capital of the Free State.\n\nThe atmosphere that one feels in Bloemfontein is one based on an appreciation of family values, where quality of life is of prime importance. Business and family interests are combined, in a hand-in-glove way, with no reason for discord; cultures are intermingled, again with peaceable accord.\n\nCape Town\n\nHome to the iconic Table Mountain, Cape Town offers a myriad of activities and attractions for all. Enjoy sun drenched beaches, nature trails, water sports, gourmet dining, award-winning wine estates, and more in the “Mother City”.\n\nEconomic development\n\nInvestors can contact the City’s Economic and Human Development Department (EHD), its agencies and partners for investment opportunities.\n\nThe EHD Department is responsible for promoting economic growth, job creation, reducing poverty and monitoring inequalities in Cape Town, through a number of projects and programmes, such as Small Business Week, the Business Voucher Support Programme, and the Smart City Strategy. To read more about these, click here.\n\nWesgro\n\nWesgro is the official trade and investment promotion agency for the Western Cape. The City contributes R7-million to Wesgro’s R19-million annual budget, with the rest provided by the provincial government of the Western Cape. Wesgro’s strategy is aligned to the City’s Economic and Human Development Strategy, as well as the province’s Micro-Economic Development Strategy.\n\nOver the last five years, nearly 15 000 jobs have been created thanks to the agency. Most of these have been in the skilled sector. This last financial year saw 2 388 jobs created in Cape Town and 2 693 in the rest of the Western Cape (excluding call centres). Wesgro attracted R605-million in investment into the city’s R123.9-billion economy, attracted R5.45-billion in investment over the last five years.\n\nDurban\n\nOne of the most popular holiday destinations in South Africa, Durban boasts warm ocean waters, beautiful beaches, and great weather year-round.

We have a huge, expanding fibre optic system to really make Durban THE Smart City, etc. Durban has the lowest cost basket of rates and services levies across any of the major centres in South Africa.\n\nLifestyle of business and pleasure together\n\nThis is a place to live, work and play. You might have other centres that are dominated by the business side, but perhaps not as blessed as we are with the sustainable lifestyle and sense of pleasure. You might have other places that dominate on lifestyle and pleasure, but don’t have a huge business side to them, in terms of manufacturing or infrastructure profile. The emphasis for us is on the word ‘together’, it’s the two complementary halves, the business or career half and the social and lifestyle-family side.\n\nLarge Human Resources base\n\nAt the heart of the most populace Province of Kwa Zulu-Natal, Durban has large pools of skilled, semi-skilled and unskilled labour, plus some of the best and fastest Skills Development taking place amongst our 3,2M cosmopolitan population. E.G., Durban has Africa’s largest direct contact University based in Durban, the University of KwaZulu-Natal, with over 45,000 direct contact tertiary students of Black African, Asian and European decent.\n\nHighest growth rates\n\nDurbans growth rates are higher than the country’s average, and that of the other major centres, in the region of 6%-6.5 %. they’re targeting in the range of 7.5%-9%.

Durban leads the continent in terms of port infrastructure, with Africa’s busiest harbour.\n\nTourism Crown\n\nDurban is the largest domestic tourism destination in South Africa by a healthy margin, plus concrete projects in place to become one of the largest international tourism destinations.

Our International Convention Centre is rated by the global trade as Africa’s best convention centre for the last 6 years running. Durban just spent nearly half a Billion Rand in terms of further expanding it’s footprint.\n\nSubstantial, successful, growing business base already in place across the primary, secondary and tertiary sectors. It’s a case of functional magnetism – companies like to be located synergistically, with over 60% of the Provinces GGP produced in Durban.
