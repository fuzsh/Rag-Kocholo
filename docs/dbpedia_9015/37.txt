Bloemfontein (direct translation: flower fountain), was officially established as a fort by British army Major Henry Douglas Warden in 1846 as a British outpost in the area north of the Orange River. At that stage the area was occupied by groups such as Cape Colony Trek Boers, Griqua, and Basotho.

The region changed into the Orange River Sovereignty (1848- 1854) and the Orange Free State Republic (1854-1902). From 1902 to 1910 Bloemfontein was the capital of the Orange River Colony and it became the capital of the Free State, one of the provinces of the Union of South Africa in 1910.

Today known as the 'City of Roses', this vibrant city, with the heart, caring character, and tranquillity of a big town, is the economic, educational, and medical-care hub for a vast inland area in South Africa and neighbouring Lesotho. It is also known as the Judicial Capital of South Africa.

Bloemfontein is also a cultural melting pot where all forms of art have an opportunity to thrive. It was also a major link in the history and development of modern-day South Africa with the establishment of two major political organisations.

Since 2000, Bloemfontein has formed part of the Mangaung Local Municipality, an amalgamation of the transitional local councils of Bloemfontein, Botshabelo, Thaba â€˜Nchu, and two rural councils.
