Bloemfontein, city, capital of Free State province (formerly Orange Free State) and judicial capital of the Republic of South Africa.

Founded by Major H. Douglas Warden in 1846 as a fort and residency, it became the seat of the British-administered Orange River Sovereignty (1848–54) and of the Orange Free State (an independent Boer republic formed in 1854). The failure of the Bloemfontein Conference (May–June 1899) resulted in the outbreak of the South African War (1899–1902). In the 20th century the city became a geographic hub of South Africa’s transportation (particularly, railroad) systems. The area’s economic development was spurred after 1948 by exploitation of the Free State goldfields, lying 100 miles (160 km) northeast, and after 1962 by the Orange River multipurpose (irrigation and power) project.
