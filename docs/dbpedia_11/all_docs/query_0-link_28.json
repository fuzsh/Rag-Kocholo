        "text": "One of DYMM Sultan Yusuf Izzudin’s visit to Britain was when Tuanku attended the coronation of Elizabeth II which took place on 2 June 1953. During the coronation, the “colonial Rulers” were in the vanguard of the coronation procession from Buckingham Palace to Westminster Abbey. Respresenting the Malay states, the Malay rulers were led by Sultan Ibrahim IV of Kelantan[1], followed by Sultan Yusuf Izzudin, Sultan Ibrahim of Johor and finally Sultan Hisamuddin Alam Shah of Selangor.\n\nThe only problem on the coronation day was the typical British weather – it poured down with rain! Nevertheless, that did not stop people all over Britain holding parties in the decorated streets of their towns and cities. In London, the roads were packed with people waiting to see the procession that took place.\n\nSultan Yusuf Izzudin arrived in Malaya from Britain on 23 July 1953 on the Willem Ruys[2]. Upon reaching Tanjung Malim, where he was greeted by the Menteri Besar, Dato’ Panglima Bukit Gantang, there was a big welcome for Tuanku. He was given a royal salute of 21 guns.\n\nWhen asked by a reporter about the coronation, Sultan Yusuf Izzudin’s reply was that his visit to Britain was made all the more memorable by the knowledge that his rakyat were celebrating the same event at the same time. During the interview, Tuanku mentioned that he was particularly impressed with the orderliness of the London crowd. Tuanku also said,”I enjoyed every minute of the coronation. It was most impressive. I shall never forget it.” While in London, Tuanku also saw a good number of Malayan students and spoke to many from Perak.\n\nIn 1955, Tuanku went to Britain again for three months, of which he spent two weeks in a London clinic for recuperation. During the trip, Tuanku was accompanied by his physician, Dr. Megat Khas and his aide-de-camp, Captain Raja Amir. While in London, Tuanku, together with Sultan Ibrahim of Johor, attended a buka puasa at the Malaya Hall. Sultan Ibrahim was already in Britain for eleven months. Both Sultans returned to Malaya together on the Willem Ruys. Apparently, a 17-gun salute was shot as Sultan Ibrahim’s car crossed the causeway from Singapore.\n\nFootnote:\n\n[1] Click here to see a photo in LIFE magazine of Sultan Ibrahim IV of Kelantan at Westminster Abbey.\n\n[2] Willem Ruys was a passenger liner that was built between 1939 and 1947. In 1964, her name was changed to Achille Lauro. She is most remembered for her 1985 hijacking. However, in 1994, the ship caught fire and sank in the Indian Ocean off Somalia.\n\n_________________________________________\n\nReference:\n\n1. 4 Malay Sultans for crowning.

Bring on the good times!\n\n__________________________________\n\nKuala Kangsar now has a new bus terminal and supermarket where previously stood the famed Ghee Kheng restaurant. Along the same street is the Double Lion Restaurant still offering the best home-made sekaya that goes well with its own-baked Hainanese bread, especially charcoal toasted. Along this street too is the 100-year old Tsung Wah Chinese school, still standing proud today, with Sungai Kangsar flowing behind the school grounds. Spanning this part of the river was an old hanging bridge then only accessible to pedestrians, pedal cyclists and small motorcyclists. This was my short cut to school and the town when I was staying at Bukit Residen (Resident Hill), passing through small footpaths in this Chinese village. And being a river-boy this bypass became my haunting ground playing truant, irresistibly charmed by the river with its clear and swift flowing stream.\n\nThe only other landmark this part of Kuala then was the Grand Theater, besides Ghee Kheng. In the 70’s, no cinema theatre would thrive without its own food court, enticing cinemagoers for a bite before or after a show. Ghee Kheng would come alive after six in the evening, offering local Chinese and Malay cuisine – the favorites being its ais kacang and lin chi kang. For the young cinemagoers, it was not so much the food that attracted them but the chance to play the jukebox.\n\nRemember films when Elvis would enter a restaurant and get into a fist-fight over a girl? And he would then play the juke box and wooed the girl with his hip-swinging rocking song? Where else in Kuala could you find a juke box but at Ghee Kheng! School-going teenagers would starve themselves during morning breaks at school just to save their meagre pocket money to treat their girlfriends at Ghee Kheng. Chatting over a large bowl of ais kacang, they would dedicate songs from the juke box to their partners. There were no DJ’s, so they had to pluck the courage to ask, “mike suke lagu ape?” But to my recollection, no boy was brave enough to literally shake his hips singing to Elvis’s Jailhouse Rock in front of his lass, let alone in public!\n\nIf you watched the late shows at the cinema and spent late hours at Ghee Kheng, you would have missed the bus which stopped its services before nine. After nine, you had to make do with the prebet sapu, which were the unmetered illegal taxis. The choice we had of riding iin comfort were the Holdens and Peugeot 404’s!\n\nKuala Kangsar might not have its own leaning tower like Telok Anson (now Teluk Intan) but we Kuala Kangsarians took pride in our jam besor. During British rule, it must have been one of the biggest clock tower ever erected in a town centre for it to be called as such.\n\nNear the jam besor was the old bus station, located in a backstreet between two rows of shops. For the convenience of the commuters and the townsfolk, there were some hawker-stalls-on-wheels. We were not short of choices to whet our appetites.\n\nFor thirst quenchers, there was cendol Pak Talib, who was always wearing his kopiah. Pak Hassan popiah was all smiles when serving his regular customers. Clad only in his short-sleeved Pagoda T-shirt and kain pulicat, one cannot miss his big leather belt with its pouches. For the lovers of mee mamak, there was mee Pak Desa, a rather taciturn man whose son was my classmate at Clifford. And laksa Pak Ngah was a must, especially for the ladies and it remains popular till now. At that time, pau Ah Lok was not in contention, hardly popular at all like it is today.\n\nDespite the small size of their businesses, these food sellers were successful in providing for their families, schooled their children (many of whom went to school with me, like Pak Desa’s son), bought their own houses (the rumah murah Jalan Kenas) and performed their Hajj. Their subsequent success from hard work were an inspiration to me, and may Allah bless their souls! Amin.\n\nFollowing the signing of the Pangkor Treaty on 20 January 1874, two proclamations by Sir Andrew Clarke, Governor of the Straits Settlements, were published in the Straits Settlements Government Gazette on 15 July 1874, pertaining the appointment of Sultan Abdullah Muhammad Shah II as Sultan of Perak, and the retention of the title “Ex-Sultan” (Sultan Muda) for the deposed Sultan Ismail.
