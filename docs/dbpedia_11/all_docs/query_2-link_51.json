        "text": "In 1411 CE, Ahmad Shah replaced his grandfather Muzaffar Shah to the throne. He is regarded as the true founder of the Muzaffarid Dynasty in Gujarat. He controlled the nobility, established the administration, and consolidated and enlarged the realm. He fought against the Malwa and Khandesh sultans. In Gujarat, he imposed jizya for the first time. His two ministers, Manik Chand and Motichand, were both Hindus, and he appointed Hindus to prominent administrative positions. In 1413 CE, Ahmad Shah founded Ahmedabad and named it his capital. In this article, we will discuss the Important Ruler of the Muzaffarid Dynasty in Gujarat Ahmed Shah I (1411 – 1441 CE) which will be helpful for UPSC exam preparation.\n\nBackground\n\nAhmed Shah I - Background\n\nAhmad Shah I, also known as Ahmad Khan, was a Muzaffarid dynasty ruler who ruled over the Gujarat Sultanate from 1411 to 1441.\n\nHe was son of Muhammad Shah I (Tatar Khan) and grandson of Muzaffar Shah.\n\nHe made his grandfather Muzaffar Shah swallow poison to take the revenge of his father’s death and killed him.\n\nIn 1411, at the age of 19, Ahmad Shah succeeded to the throne with the title of Nasir-ud-dunya Wad-din Abul fateh Ahmad Shah.\n\nHe moved the capital from Patan to a new city of Ahmedabad in 1413 CE.\n\nHe is remembered for his valor, talent, and success as a military leader, as well as his piety and justice.\n\nReign\n\nReign of Ahmed Shah I\n\nAhmad Shah was met with a revolt by his uncles soon after his accession.\n\nFiruz Khan, his elder uncle, spearheaded the revolt and declared himself king. Firuz and his brothers eventually surrendered to him.\n\nAhmed Shah attempted to exert influence over the Rajputana states in the Saurashtra region, as well as the regions bordering Gujarat and Rajasthan (Bundi, Dungarpur, and Jhalawar).\n\nHe defeated and took the formidable fort of Girnar in Saurashtra, but returned it to the raja after he promised to pay tribute.\n\nHe stormed Sidhpur, a well-known Hindu pilgrimage site, and destroyed numerous exquisite structures.\n\nIn Gujarat, he enforced the levy of jizya on Hindus while also inducting Hindus into his government.\n\nHe was a just ruler who publicly executed his son-in-law for murder.\n\nHe adorned the city with numerous splendid mansions, mosques, bazaars, and madrasas.\n\nThe rich architectural traditions of Gujarat's Jains temple impacted him greatly.\n\nSlender turrets, stone carving, and intricate brackets are among the architectural highlights.\n\nThe Jami Masjid in Ahmedabad and the Teen Darwaza are excellent examples of his period's architectural style.\n\nThe Muslim monarchs of Malwa were his arch-rivals.\n\nThe two kingdoms' violent competition damaged them and made it harder for them to play a larger role in north Indian politics.\n\nAhmed died in 1442, in his fifty-third year and thirty-third year of reign, and was buried in the Badshah no Hajiro shrine near Manek Chowk in Ahmedabad.\n\nHis post-death title was Khudaigan-i-Maghfur the Forgiven lord.\n\nHis queens were buried next to his mausoleum at Rani no Hajiro.\n\nConclusion\n\nConclusion"
