        "text": "Mughal Empire\n\n(title Padshah, sometimes Padshah-e Hind = Emperor of India)\n\nEventually, Delhi and almost all the rest of India fell under a dynasty arising out of the far northwest, the Mughals [\"Mongols\", from the fact that Babur was a great-great-great grandson of Timur (Tamburlane)]. Capital: Agra 1526-1540, 1555-1570, 1616-1648; Fatehpur Sikri 1570-1585; Lahore 1585-1599; Delhi: 1599-1613, 1648-1858; Ajmer 1613-1616).\n\nZahir ud-Din Muhammad Babur Mirza S/o Umar Shaykh...27 May 1526 - 26 Dec 1530\n\nHe was the ruler of Samarqand briefly from 1497-1498 (AH 903) and again 1500 (AH 905-906), Eastern Khorasan and Transoxian 1500-1530. After the Battle of panipat on 21 Apr 1526, the Battle of Khanwa (Khanua) was the second in a series of three major battles, fought near the village of Khanwa, about 60 km west of Agra on March 17, 1527. Babur defeated a formidable army raised by Rana Sanga of Mewar in this ten hour battle and firmly established his rule over northern India. Battle of Ghaghra, which is the third and last battle, occurred on May 6, 1529 mainly Babur, Humayun and Askari on one side while Sultan Mahmud Lodi, Sultan Nusrat Shah, Sultan Jalal ud-Din Lohani and Sher Shah Suri on the other side. Mughal won this battle as well. Babur died at the age of 47 on December 26, 1530 of an unknown illness and was succeeded by his eldest son, Humayun. Babur's silver Tankas, also known as Shahrukhis were struck at Khorasanian and Transoxianan mints AH 906-933 (1500-1530). After invading India, this Tankas or Shahrukhis were struck principally at Kabul, Lahore, Agra, Jaunpur and Delhi. These first Mughal coins of India are considered reasonably common. See one of his Shahrukh minted at Qanadar AH 933 (1527).\n\nNaseer ud-din Muhammad Humayun S/o Babur (1st time).28 Dec 1530 - 17 May 1539 d. 1556\n\nHumayun silver shahrukis (4.7g) were struck at various Indian mints and are considered common. Humayun after 1539, was forced to seek Safavid protection as a vassal of the Safavid Tahmasp I at the end of AH 950 and returned with Safavid reinforcement to Qandahar late in AH 951. He had to produce extremely rare Shahruki and half Shahruki at Qandahar with Shiite Kalma. He abandoned the Safavid alliance early in AH 952. A scarce 1/4 gold Ashrafi were also struck at Badakhshan but without mint name AH 937-963 (1530-1556). Humayun lost his Indian territories to the Pashtun noble, Sher Shah Suri, and, with Persian aid, regained them fifteen years later.\n\nKamran Mirza S/o Babur [Kabul & Lahore]....................1530 - 1555\n\nAccording to the Mughal historian Abul Fazl, Baburs last words to Humayun were do nothing against your brothers, even though they may deserve it. His brother Kamran Mirza rebelled against him as he governor of Kabul and Qandahar. In 1538 Kamran first crossed into India, bringing with him 12,000 soldiers, while Humayun was away fighting in Bengal. He appeared to have come in order to put down the rebellion of his brother Hindal against Humayun. However, despite Humayuns calls for help, Kamran offered him no aid whatsoever. After Humayun returned from his defeat at the Battle of Chausa, Kamran refused to place his troops under Humayuns command as he was more interested in taking power for himself. Seeing no chance of furthering his ambition, Kamran withdrew back to Lahore. Following his success in the Battle of Kaunaj in 1540, the new ruler of northern India, Sher Shah, ordered Humayun to leave India and settle in Kabul. Kamran was unwilling to hand the city over to his brother though. At this point Kamran went behind Humayun's back and offered to support Sher Shah, if the latter would give him the Punjab in return. His offer was refused. At this point Humayun was urged by his advisors to put his brother to death, but he refused. After a series of disastrous attempts to retake his throne, Humayun crossed the Indus in 1543. Rather than welcoming him, Kamran sent his younger brother Askari out to catch him and bring him to Kabul. Humayun managed to escape his brothers clutches though and sought refuge in the court of the ruler of Persia, Shah Tahmasp I. When Humayun was in Persia, Kamran offered the Shah, the city of Kandahar if he would hand his brother over to him. Shah Tahmasp favoured Humayun in this fraternal squabble however, and provided him with troops with which he defeated Kamran. Humayun was able to enter Kabul in November 1545 in a bloodless takeover, as Kamrans rule had been oppressive, and the population of the city was keen to be rid of him. Although Humayun resisted the pressure to put his rebellious brother to death, he was persuaded that something needed to be done about him so he reluctantly had him blinded. Humayun then sent him off to perform the Hajj to Makkah, where he died in 1557. Other brothers of Humayun were Hindal and Askari. An extremely rare 1/4 gold Ashrafi were struck by Kamran Mirza at Badakhshan AH 937-962 (1530-1555). See one of his Shahrukhi minted at Kabul AH 937-962 (1530-1555).\n\nSuri Dynasty.........................................17 May 1539 - 1555\n\nMUGHAL EMPIRE (restored)\n\nNaseer ud-din Muhammad Humayun S/o Babur (2nd time)..22 Feb 1555 - 27 Jan 1556\n\nWhile Sikandar Shah was busy with his struggle against Ibrahim Shah, Humayun captured Lahore in February 1555. Another detachment of his forces captured Dipalpur. Next, the Mughal army occupied Jalandhar and their advanced division proceeded towards Sirhind. Sikandar sent a force of 30,000 horses but they were defeated by the Mughal army in a battle at Machhiwara and Sirhind was occupied by the Mughals. Sikandar, then led an army of 80,000 horses himself and met the Army at Sirhind. On June 22, 1555, Sikandar was defeated by the Mughal army and was compelled to retreat to the Sivalik Hills in northern Punjab. The victorious Mughals marched to Delhi and occupied it. Full title: Al-Sultan al-'Azam wal Khaqan al-Mukarram, Jam-i-Sultanat-i-haqiqi wa Majazi, Sayyid al-Salatin, Abu'l Muzaffar Nasir ud-din Muhammad Humayun Padshah Ghazi, Zillu'llah. Coronation on 30 December 1530 at Agra.\n\nHem Chandra Vikramaditya [Hemu] (Hindu Emperor).........Dec 1555 - 05 Nov 1556\n\nThe son of a food seller, and himself a vendor of saltpetre at Rewari, he rose to become Chief of Army and Prime Minister of Adil Shah Suri of the Suri Dynasty. He fought Afghan rebels across North India from the Punjab to Bengal and the Mughal forces of Akbar and Humayun in Agra and Delhi, winning 22 battles continuously, without a single setback. Hemu is known to struck coins bearing his title. After the victory of the Mughal ruler Humayun over Adil Shah's brother Sikander Suri, Mughals regained Punjab, Delhi and Agra after a gap of 15 years on July 23, 1555. At the battle of Chhapparghatta in December 1555, Hemu routed the Bengal forces under Muhammad Shah, who was killed in the battle. Hemu was in Bengal when Humayun died on January 27, 1556. Humayun's death gave Hemu an ideal opportunity to defeat the Mughals. He started a winning march from Bengal through present day Bihar, Eastern UP and Madhya Pradesh. The Mughal fauzdars evacuated their positions and fled in panic. In Agra, an important Mughal stronghold, the commander of Mughal forces Iskander Khan Uzbeg ran away from Agra hearing about Hemu's invasion without a fight. Etawah, Kalpi, Bayana, in the present day central and western UP, all came under Hemu's dominion. In the words of K. K. Bhardwaj in Hemu the Napoleon of Medieval India, if Vincent A Smith describes Samudragupta as Indian Napoleon, we can certainly call Hemu \"the Napoleon of Medieval India\" as the victor of 22 battles before dying fighting at Panipat due to sheer bad luck. Hemu won Delhi after a day's battle on October 06, 1556. Some 3000 soldiers died in this battle. However, Mughal forces led by Tardi Beg Khan vacated Delhi after a day's fight and Hemu entered Delhi victorious under a royal canopy. Hemu was crowned at Purana Qila, on 07 October 1556, in the presence of all Afghan Sardars and Hindu Senapatis (military commanders). On hearing about Hemu's continuous victories and fall of large territories like Agra and Delhi from Akbar's control, the Mughal army at Kalanaur lost heart and many commanders refused to fight Hemu. Most of the commanders advised Akbar to retreat to Kabul as he would be safer there. However, Bairam Khan, the guardian of Akbar and chief strategist for army matters, insisted on fighting Hemu in an effort to gain control of Delhi. On November 5, 1556, the Mughal army met Hemu's army at the historic battle field of Panipat. Bairam Khan motivated his army by a religious speech and ordered them to move for battle; Akbar and Bairam Khan stayed back eight miles from the battle ground. However, Hemu led his large army himself, sitting atop an elephant. He was poised to achieve victory, when he was wounded in the eye by an arrow, and collapsed unconscious. This led to extreme confusion in the soldiers, as no commander was able to make coordinated decisions. Thus a sure victory was converted by a stroke of chance into defeat. Unconscious, the almost dead Hemu was captured by Shah Qulin Khan and carried to the camp of Akbar and Bairam Khan to be executed. After Hemu's death, a massacre was ordered by Bairam Khan of the followers of Hemu. Thousands of persons were killed to create terror among Hindus.\n\nAbu'l Fath Jalaluddin Muhammad Akbar I S/o Humayun...14 Feb 1556 - 29 Oct 1605\n\nAkbar had three sons: Jahangir [Salim], Murad and Daniyal. Bairam Khan is known to be Akbar's regent 1556-1561. Akbar was a follower of Salim Chishti, a holy man who lived in the region of Sikri near Agra. Believing the area to be a lucky one for himself, he had a mosque constructed there for the use of the saint. Akbar celebrated the victory over Chittor and Ranthambore by laying the foundation of a new city, 23 miles (37 km) of Agra in 1569. It was called Fatehpur Sikri (city of victory), honoring the Saint. The Mughal army also conquered Kabul (1581), Kashmir (1586), and Kandesh (1601), among others. Akbar installed a governor over each of the conquered provinces. From the discussions he led there in 1575, Akbar concluded that no single religion could claim the monopoly of truth. Therefore inspired and interaction with various religious theologians had convinced him that despite their differences, all religions had several good practices, which he sought to combine into a new religious movement known as Din-i-Ilahi in 1581. On 03 October 1605, Akbar fell ill with an attack of dysentery, from which he never recovered. He is believed to have died on or about 29 October 1605, after which his body was buried at a mausoleum in Sikandra, Agra.\n\nHakim Mirza S/o Humayun (Kabul, Bihar and Bengal)...........1581 - 10 Aug 1581\n\nIn 1580, some prominent Muslim officers of Akbar, displeased with his liberal religious policies, started to conspire against him. Qazi Muhammad Yazdi declared it the duty of every Muslim to rebel against Akbar. In Bihar and Bengal they declared Mirza Hakim, Akbar's stepbrother and Governor of Kabul, to be the emperor. Akbar sent armies to Bihar and Bengal to crush this rebellion, while he himself started towards Kabul; Man Singh (Kacchwaha King of Amber, a state later known as Jaipur) with him. Akbar himself arrived at Kabul on August 10, 1581. Hakim was pardoned by Akbar, but his sister \"Bakhtunissa Begum\" was appointed Governor of Kabul. After Akbar returned to Fatehpur Sikri; Bakhtunissa remained as the nominal head of state, while Hakim acted as the Governor (Hakim died in July, 1582).\n\nNur-ud-din Jahangir [Salim] S/o Akbar [Rebel]................1600 - 1605\n\nIn 1600, when Akbar was away from the capital on an expedition, Salim broke into an open rebellion, and declared himself Emperor. Akbar had to hastily return to Agra and restore order. There was a time when Akbar thought of putting his eldest grandson Khusrau Mirza on the throne instead of Salim. Prince Khusrau Mirza, when he attempted to claim the throne based on Akbar's will to become his next heir. Khusrau Mirza was defeated in 1606 and confined in the fort of Agra. As punishment Khusrau Mirza was blinded, and the Sikh Guru Arjun (the religious fifth guru) tortured for five days until he had disappeared while taking a bath in a river. Coins were produced under Salim's name mainly at Ahmadabad, Kabul and Allahabad during Ilahi year (IE) 45-50 (1600-1605).\n\nNaseer ud-din Muhammad Humayun coinage: 1530 - 1539 and 1555 - 1556 [AH 937- 946 and 962-963].\n\nMM# 3014 Bahloli (½ Dam).

AH 937 are a problem as it is a year that covers both rulers. He has come to a conclusion that the coins of Humayun are those with the epithet Dar al Khilafat - seat of the capital. Babur's capital was Delhi and hence the coins of Agra during his rule were having epithet Dar al Darb or Qilla Agra for Agra.\n\nMM reference is taken from Michael Mitchiner's book \"Oriental Coins and their Values - The World of Islam\" by Hawkins Publications 1977 (ISBN 0904173151).\n\nSame as above coin, but...\n\nYear: AH 942 (1535).

Another story goes that Akbar, finding the Indus river impassable, named the fortress Atak, 'the obstacle,' and that when he effected a crossing he founded Khairabad, 'the abode of safety,' on the western bank of the river. Attock is located on the bank of the Indus, 80 km (50 mi) from Rawalpindi, 100 km (62 mi) from Peshawar, and 10 km (6 mi) from the Pakistan Aeronautical Complex, Kamra. The road and railway bridge at Attock over the Indus river were completed in 1883. KM#66.2 Half Rupee. Year: IE48 [1604]. Weight: 5.59g. Metal: Silver. Diameter: 18.00 mm. Edge: Plain.

Akbar's First Rupee issue from Kalpi.\n\nKalpi is a town and a municipal board in Jalaun district in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh. Kalpi is located at 26.12°N 79.73°E. It has an average elevation of 112 metres (367 feet). It is on the right bank of the Yamuna. It is situated 78 kilometer south-west of Kanpur from which it is connected by both road and rail.\n\nIt is believed that the city was known as Kalap dev ki kalpi in the ancient times, later abbreviated to Kalpi. Kalpi is also known as the birthplace of Maharishi Veda vyas, the writer of Mahabharata and Puranas. He collected the chants of Vedas and assembled them in an arranged manner. Kalpi is said to have been founded by King Vasudeva at the end of the 4th century.\n\nIn 1196 it fell to Qutb-ud-din Aybak, the viceroy of Mohammed Ghori, and during the subsequent Muslim period it played a significant part in the history of central India. During Akbar's reign, Kalpi was a governor's seat and had a mint for copper and silver coinage. The witty Birbal of Akbar's court is considered to be born near this city. About the middle of the 18th century it passed into the hands of the Marathas.\n\nThe town was captured by the British in 1803, and after 1806 remained in British possession until India's independence in 1947. Kalpi was a part of Bundelkhand Agency, formed in 1811, and also housed its headquarters from 1818 to 1824. During this period the political agent to Governor General of India was appointed and headquartered in Kalpi. The British East India Company made it one of their principal stations for providing \"commercial investment\". In May 1858 Hugh Rose (Lord Strathnairn) defeated here a force of Indian rebels led by the Rani of Jhansi. The fortified post of Kalpi, the former residence of the rulers of Jalaun State, was dismantled in 1860 by the British and its place was taken by a market known as Whiteganj. There are many places for visiting like Vyas temple, Lanka Meenar, 84 Gumbaj and lots of Dargah like Khankah the Dargah of Sayyad Meer Tirmiji. Kalpi is also birthplace of Ved Vyas ji. There is a Kali Haveli and Rang Mahal of Birbal. KM#80.12 Rupee. Year: AH 986 [1578]. Weight: 11.32g. Metal: Silver. Diameter: 24.00 mm. Edge: Plain. Alignment: Rotated (5 o'clock). Mint: Lahore.

In 1622, Khurram (Shah Jahan), younger brother of Khusrau Mirza, had Khusrau murdered in a conspiracy to eliminate all possible contenders to the throne. Taking advantage of this internal conflict, the Persians seized the city of Kandahar and as a result of this loss, the Mughals lost control over the trade routes to Afghanistan, Persian and Central Asia and also exposed India to invasions from the north-west. Jahangir opened first relations with the British East India Company.\n\nNur Jahan [wife of Jahangir]................................1624 - 28 Oct 1627\n\nCoins of Nur Jahan by authority of Jahangir were produced from AH 1034-1037 (1624-1627).

Ruler: Nur-ud-din Jahangir [Salim] S/o Akbar (1605-1627). Note: \"Inayat\" poetic couplet. Common type.\n\nIrresistible Note: The details of the life of Inayat Khan are obscure. In March, 1618, Jahangir mentions in his memoirs that he made Inayat Khan Bakhshi of the abadis, or paymaster of the imperial cavalrymen. Jahangir writes that Inayat Khan was \"one of my closest servants and subjects, when he begin the description of his death in Agra on October 10, 1618, but does not otherwise mention him anywhere in his diary (Jahangirnama). Jahangir's description of the death of Inayat Khan is as follows written at Ajmer: On this date news came of the death of Inayat Khan. He was one of my closest servants and subjects. In addition to eating opium he also drank wine when he had the chance. Little by little he became obsessed with wine, and since he had a weak frame, he drank more than his body could tolerate and was afflicted with diarrhea. While so weakened he was overcome two or three times by something like epileptic fits. By my order Kakim Rukna treated him, but no matter what he did it was to no avail. In addition, Inayat Khan developed a ravenous appetite, and although the doctor insisted that he not eat more than once a day, he couldnt restrain himself and raged like a madman. Finally he developed cachexia and dropsy and grew terribly thin and weak. Several days prior to this he requested that he be taken ahead to Agra. I ordered him brought to me to be given leave to depart. He was put in a palanquin and brought. He looked incredibly weak and thin. Skin stretched over bone. Even his bones had begun to disintegrate. Whereas painters employ great exaggeration when they depict skinny people, nothing remotely resembling him had ever been seen. Good God! How can a human being remain alive in this shape?... It was so strange I ordered the artist to draw his likeness. Apart from giving this detailed account, he ordered the court painter Balchand to draw the likeness of Inayat Khan. What emerged was a drawing, perhaps one of the best linear works of Mughal School, along with a painting in colour. In the painting , Inayat Khan rests on a charpoy. Large bolsters support his torso and ample pillows steady his head and hands. The loose jama that Inayat Khan wears falls open to reveal the courtiers sickly pallor, skeletal ribcage, and extraordinarily weakened condition. Although these rare images of death are routinely included in studies of Mughal painting, scholars fail to account for their place within the tradition of Mughal miniature painting, or for the motivations underlying their commission. This paper examines Dying Inayat Khans resonances with Jahangirs personal and political interests through three lenses. The first considers the images in light of Jahangirs scientific inquiries into nature and natural life-and-death processes, which are evident in Jahangirs commissions of depictions of flora and fauna. The second investigates ways in which Dying Inayat Khan abides by and challenges conventions and functions of traditional Mughal court portraiture. Finally, the third critical lens reveals how Dying Inayat Khan evokes spiritual concerns that resonate with an allegorical mode of Mughal portraiture and with Jahangirs spiritually-guided perceptions of his own mortality and political potency. Ultimately, the reality and representations of Inayat Khans death foretell formidable personal and political troubles for Jahangir and his reign. In the Jahangirnama, Jahangirs unmistakable fascination with Inayat Khans dying body likely arose in part from the emperors own experience with opium and alcohol addiction. Jahangir had a great love of wine and opium, and his memoirs include numerous accounts of large drinking parties where wine and opium were openly consumed. This miniature \"Dying Inayat Khan\" (Watercolour and gilt on paper Bodleian Library, Oxford) which has inspired many painters over centuries still enchants the artists.\n\nKM#141.1 Rupee.

Note: Common type.\n\nThe Safavids had territorial claims over Qandahar since the reign of Shah Tahmasp. The overthrow of Humayun, the Mughal Emperor, is known to have gained the support of Shah Tahmasp in return for his permission to allow the Safavids to capture Qandahar. Subsequently, conflicts emerged in the region during the reign of another Mughal emperor, Jahangir. In 1638, the Kurdish military leader and administrator of Safavid Empire Ali Mardan Khan handed over Qandahar to Shah Jahan. Both Kabul and Qandahar came under Mughal control. The Mughal often viewed Kabul and Qandahar as a painfully small compensation for the loss of their homeland, Samarkand  which they had been driven out of by the Uzbeks.\n\nThe MughalSafavid War of 1649-1653 was fought between the Mughal and Safavid empires in the territory of modern Afghanistan. While the Mughals were at war with the Janid Uzbeks, the Safavid army captured the fortress city of Qandahar and other strategic cities that controlled the region. The Mughals attempted unsuccessfully to regain Qandahar, despite repeated attempts. In 1653 Shah Jahan sent Dara Shikoh, with a large army and two of the heaviest artillery pieces of the empire, but after a five-month siege the Mughals couldn't manage to starve the city, and the attempt to breach their walls by cannon fire also failed. The Mughals finally gave up all attempts to recover Qandahar.\n\nKM#142.2 Rupee. Year: AH 1026 - RY 12 [1617]. Weight: 11.39g. Metal: Silver. Diameter: 21.00 mm. Edge: Plain. Alignment: Rotated.

Malik Ambar assisted Shah Jahan wrestle power in Delhi from his stepmother, Nur Jahan, who had ambitions of seating her son-in-law on the throne. Shah Jahan married Arjumanad Banu Mumtaz Mahaldep [Mumtaz Mahal] d/o Abdul Hassan Asaf Khan S/o Himad ud-Daula on 10 May 1612. Mumtaz Mahal married when she was 14 years old. Mumtaz Mahal died on 17 June 1731 and Shah Jahan order the construction of Taj Mahal. On September 6, 1657, the illness of emperor Shah Jahan triggered a desperate struggle for power among the four Mughal princes, though realistically only Dara Shikoh and Aurangzeb had a chance of emerging victorious. Dara Shikoh was favoured as a successor by his father and his sister Princess Jahanara Begum. Shah Shuja was the first to make his move, declaring himself emperor in Bengal and marching towards Agra while Murad Baksh allied himself with Aurangzeb. Despite strong support from Shah Jahan, who had recovered enough from his illness to remain a strong factor in the struggle for supremacy, and the victory of his army led by his eldest son Sulaiman Dara Shikoh over Shah Shuja in the battle of Bahadurpur on February 14, 1658, Dara was defeated by Aurangzeb and Murad at the battlefield of Samugarh, 13 km from Agra on May 30, 1658. Subsequently Aurangzeb took over Agra fort and deposed emperor Shah Jahan on June 08, 1658. After the defeat Dara Shikoh retreated from Agra to Delhi and thence to Lahore. His next destination was Multan and then to Thatta (Sindh). From Sindh, he crossed the Rann of Kachchh and reached Kathiawar, where he met Shah Nawaz Khan, the governor of the province of Gujarat who opened the treasury to Dara and helped him to recruit a new army. He occupied Surat and advanced towards Ajmer. Foiled in his hopes of persuading the fickle but powerful Rajput feudatory, Maharaja Jaswant Singh of Marwar, to support his cause, the luckless Dara decided to make a stand and fight Aurangzeb's relentless pursuers but was once again comprehensively routed in the battle of Deorai (near Ajmer) on March 11, 1659. After this defeat he fled to Sindh and sought refuge under Malik Jiwan, a Baluch chieftain whose life had on more than one occasion been saved by the Mughal prince from the wrath of Shah Jahan. However, Malik betrayed Dara and turned him (and his second son Sipihr Shikoh) over to Aurangzeb's army on June 10, 1659. Dara Shikoh was brought to Delhi, placed on a filthy elephant and paraded through the streets of the capital in chains. Dara's fate was decided by the political threat he posed as a prince popular with the common people - a convocation of nobles and clergy, called by Aurangzeb in response to the perceived danger of insurrection in Delhi, declared him a threat to the public peace and an apostate from Islam. Dara Shikoh was murdered by assassins on the night of August 30, 1659. Under Shah Jahan, Mughal art and architecture reached their zenith; constructed the Taj Mahal, Jama Masjid, Red Fort, Jahangir mausoleum, and Shalimar Gardens in Lahore. He was deposed and imprisoned by his son Aurangzeb.

Note: Scarce.\n\nSouthern Central Asia in the 17th century was dominated by the Khanate of Bukhara, ruled by the Janid dynasty (also known as the Ashtrakhanids, as they originated from Ashtrakhan). From 1611 to 1642, the Khanate was ruled by Imam Quli Khan, whose reign was generally a stable one. His younger brother, Nadr Mohammed, ruled the provinces of Balkh and Badakhshan in what is now northern Afghanistan as a de facto independent ruler.\n\nIn 1622, Imam Quli Khan sent an offer of alliance to Mughal emperor Jahangir, proposing a joint offensive against the Safavids in Khurasan. However, the Mughal Empire at the time was embroiled in campaigns in the Deccan, and was not particularly interested in diverting forces away from that front. That same year, Shah Abbas of Persia launched an invasion of Mughal Afghanistan, and succeeded in capturing Kandahar. The failure of the Mughals to retake Kandahar from the Persians was interpreted by the Uzbeks as an indicator of Mughal weakness, and they soon forgot about their alliance proposal, choosing instead to attack the Mughals and profit as the Persians had. The Uzbeks attacked in 1625 and again in 1626, but were repulsed on both occasions. On 19 May 1628, Nadr Mohammed launched a large-scale invasion of Mughal territory with the intention of capturing Kabul. The Uzbek army advanced up to Lamghan, ravaging the countryside along the way, and laid siege to Kabul in early June. The Mughal response to the invasion was swift; an army led by Mahabat Khan, the governor of Peshawar, and Rao Surat Singh was dispatched with 20,000 men to relieve the besieged city. The Uzbeks were routed and withdrew in defeat, with the Mughals holding a triumphal parade in Kabul on 14 September. This, coincidentally, was the first recorded military victory of Shah Jahan's reign, which began that same year.\n\nThe 1630s saw no further Uzbek invasions, and also saw the conclusion of the Mughal campaigns in the Deccan. Kandahar, which had been lost to the Persians the previous decade, came back under Mughal control in 1638. The Empire was at the peak of its power and prosperity, and the Mughal position in the northwest was as strong as it ever had been. Shah Jahan, at this point, became interested in pursuing his cherished dream and restoring Mughal rule to his ancestral homelands in Central Asia. The perfect opportunity to do so seemed to arise with the abdication of Imam Quli Khan in 1642, who had grown blind with age, and his succession by Nadr Mohammed. Unlike his older brother, who was content with letting the subordinate chiefs of Uzbekistan manage their own affairs with little interference, Nadr Mohammed was determined to strengthen his authority as Khan. He pursued a policy of transferring and redistributing the offices and titles of subordinate chiefs, leading to widespread discontent and rebellion among them The country fell into civil war, and Nadr Mohammed was ultimately overthrown by his son, Abdul Aziz, who was proclaimed Khan of Bukhara in April 1645. However, Nadr Mohammed managed to retain his territories in Balkh and Badakhshan, which were under his possession even before he became Khan.\n\nBy middle of 1647, both sides had suffered considerably from the back-and-forth fighting. Given the huge disparity in resources between the Indian empire of the Mughals and the Uzbeks, however, it is reasonable to assume that the latter were suffering much more than the former. The Uzbek armies, which had banded together largely because of the prospect of easy loot from the Mughals, began disintegrating when such financial rewards were not forthcoming. Some of the Uzbek cavalry were even said to have sold their horses to the Mughals (Central Asian horses were highly valued by Indians and fetched high prices), and then camped back across the Amu Darya! However, the Mughals for their part could not take advantage of this lack of discipline and organization among the Uzbeks and complete the conquest of Central Asia, for a couple pressing reasons. Firstly, there was a worry that, if the Mughals succeeded with the annexation of Central Asia, the Mughal troops and commanders would be permanently stationed there. Few of the Mughal commanders were interested in spending their careers in the region, as they all preferred the wealth, luxury, and familiarity of India. Indeed, some of the Mughal commanders, like Bahadur Khan, even secretly opposed Aurangzeb and the war effort, to avoid such a result. Secondly, and perhaps more pressingly, the Mughal army was faced with a serious shortage of food, caused by the ravaging effects of warfare on the countryside over the last couple years. There was great inflation in the prices of basic foodstuffs, with grain being sold at Rs.10 per maund at the Mughal camp. The Mughal difficulties were compounded by the fact that the country lacked proper winter accommodation for a large army, and that many of the Indian soldiers were not accustomed to the cold climate. In light of all these issues, the Mughals, as well as the Uzbeks, both sought to bring the war to a close.\n\nIn mid-June, shortly after Aurangzeb had returned to Balkh, negotiations were opened with Nadr Mohammed, the exiled ex-ruler of the territories occupied by the Mughals since 1645. The talks moved slowly, lasting over three months before a settlement was concluded by Nadr Mohammed's grandsons on 23 September 1647. On 01 October, Balkh was formally handed over to the grandsons, and the Mughals began the withdrawal to Kabul two days later, on 03 October. The Mughal army during the withdrawal was commanded in the following manner: the right wing under Ali Mardan Khan, the left wing under Raja Jai Singh, and the rear under Bahadur Khan. The Mughal army continued to be harassed by roving bands of Uzbeks during the retreat, with the crossing at Ghazniyak pass being particularly slow and painful. On 14 October, the Mughals reached Ghori fort. From there until Kabul, Hazara tribesmen replaced the Uzbeks in harassing the Mughal columns. An early and unusually severe winter added greatly to the suffering of the Mughal army. The Mughals were burdened by a load of 10 lakh rupees and a lack of pack animals, thousands of whom died during the winter passage through the Hindu Kush. Aurangzeb crossed the range on 24 October, and reached Kabul on 27 October. However, large components of the Mughal army were still several days behind, and were slowed down by the heavy sleet and snow in the mountain passes. The Mughal column under Raja Jai Singh, in particular, crossed the Hindu Kush in the midst of a brutal snowstorm, and suffered immensely. The last Mughal troops finally returned to Kabul on 10 November 1647, marking the end of the campaign.\n\nKM#213.2 Half Rupee. Year: ND [1632]. Weight: 5.63g. Metal: Silver. Diameter: 16.50 mm.

It is the fifth largest city in Madhya Pradesh by population and is the administrative centre of Ujjain district and Ujjain division. It is a known Hindu pilgrimage centre with the Kumbh Mela held here every 12 years.\n\nAn ancient city situated on the eastern bank of the Kshipra River, which flows into the nearby Chambal. Ujjain was the most prominent city on the Malwa plateau north of the upper limit of the Vindhya mountain ranges for much of its history. Ujjain's co-ordinates are 23°10′N 75°46′E with an average elevation of 494 m (1620 ft). The region is an extension of the Deccan Traps, formed between 60 and 68 million years ago at the end of the Cretaceous period. It emerged as the political centre of central India around 600 BCE. It was the capital of the ancient Avanti kingdom, one of the sixteen mahajanapadas. It remained an important political, commercial and cultural centre of central India until the early 19th century, when the British administrators decided to develop Indore as an alternative to it. Ujjain continues to be an important place of pilgrimage for Shaivites, Vaishnavites and followers of Shakta. The tropic of cancer also passes through a temple named Karkoteshwar, located near Harsiddhi Mandir in Ujjain.\n\nKM#224.5 Rupee. Year: AH 1040 - RY x [1630]. Weight: 11.13g. Metal: Silver.

It is located east of Betwa River and 56 kilometers north-east of Bhopal.\n\nIt became famous for the temple of Sun god Bhillasvanin. It was ruled by the Later Gupta king Devagupta and Rashtrakuta king Krishna III. The name is first noted in an inscription of 878 AD by a merchant Hatiaka of Paravada community. The 12th century Tri-shashthi-shalaka-purusha-charitra mentions an image of Bhillasvamin at Vidisa, along with a copy of Jivant Swami buried in the sand. Minhajuddin's Tabaqat-i-Nusiri states that the temple was destroyed by Iltutmish in A D. 1233-1234. In 1293, Alauddin Khalji of the Delhi Sultanate sacked the city as a general of Sultan Jalaluddin. It shows that Vidisha had an importance in the medieval era. In 1532 Bhilsa was sacked by Bahadur Shah of Gujarat Sultanate. It thus, passed on to the Malwa Sultans and then to the Mughals and the Scindias. Mughal coins at Bhilsa were minted by Shah Jahan and Aurangzeb.\n\nUdaygiri is less than 10 km from Vidisha town. It is a series of at least 20 caves, containing both Hindu and Jain sculptures from the Gupta Era, sometime between the 4th and 5th century AD. According to Jain texts Tirthnkar Sheetal Nath attained nirvana here. It is basically a small hill where intricate sculptures have but cut out of the rocks.\n\nMaladevi Temple is a grand Portal of Ninth century AD, situated on the eastern slope of a hill and built on a huge platform cut out of the hillside and strengthened by a massive retaining wall, Maladevi temple is in fact imposing and astonishing building, provides a panoramic valley view, in Gyaraspur, about 40 km from District Vidisha, Madhya Pradesh, India, which can be accessed through NH-86.\n\nKhamba Baba, also known as Heliodorus Pillar, is a stone column, which was constructed in 110 BC. This stone column was erected by the Greek ambassador of the Indo-Greek King Antialcidas, who came to the court of Bhagabhadra, the Sunga king. Dedicated to Lord Vasudeva, this column was constructed in front of the temple of Vasudeva.\n\nHindola Torana as Hindola means a swing and Torana is a arched gate, is a magnifi"
