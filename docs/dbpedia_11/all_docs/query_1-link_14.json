        "text": "Shahanshah Abul Muzaffar Muhy-ud-Din Muhammad Aurangzeb Bahadur Alamgir I, more commonly known as Aurangzeb (Persian: اورنگ‌زیب) (full official title Al-Sultan al-Azam wal Khaqan al-Mukarram Hazrat Abul Muzaffar Muhy-ud-Din Muhammad Aurangzeb Bahadur Alamgir I, Badshah Ghazi, Shahanshah-e-Sultanat-ul-Hindiya Wal Mughaliya) (4 November 1618 [O.S. 25 October 1618] – 3 March 1707 [O.S. 20 February 1707]), also known by his chosen imperial title Alamgir (\"Conquerer of the World\") (Persian: عالمگیر), was the 6th Mughal Emperor of India whose reign lasted from 1658 until his death in 1707..\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurangzeb\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurangzeb Muhi-ud-din Muhammad Aurangzeb اورنگ‌زیب محي الدين محمد Padishah of the Mughal Empire Muhi-ud-Din Muhammad[3] (Persian: محي الدين محمد‎) (3 November 1618 – 3 March 1707),[1] commonly known by the sobriquet Aurangzeb (Urdu: اَورنگزیب ‬‎), (Persian: اورنگ‌زیب‎ \"Ornament of the Throne\")[3] or by his regnal title Alamgir (Urdu: عالمگِیر ‬‎), (Persian: عالمگير‎ \"Conqueror of the World\"),[4] was the sixth Mughal emperor. Widely considered the last effective Mughal emperor, his reign lasted for 49 years from 1658 until his death in 1707.[5][6]\n\nAurangzeb was a notable expansionist during his reign, the Mughal Empire reached its greatest extent, ruling over nearly all of the Indian subcontinent.[7] During his lifetime, victories in the south expanded the Mughal Empire to 4 million square kilometres,[8] and he ruled over a population estimated to be over 158 million subjects,[7] with an annual yearly revenue of $450 million (more than ten times that of his contemporary Louis XIV of France),[9] or £38,624,680 (2,879,469,894 rupees) in 1690.[10] Under his reign, the Mughal Empire surpassed China to become the world's largest economy, worth over $90 billion, nearly a quarter of world GDP in 1700.[11]\n\nAurangzeb has been subject to controversy and criticism[12] for his policies that abandoned his predecessors' legacy of pluralism and religious tolerance, citing his introduction of the Jizya tax, destruction of Hindu temples, execution or forced conversion of his non-Muslim subjects to Islam and execution of the ninth Sikh guru, Guru Tegh Bahadur.[13][14][a] Various historians question the historicity of the claims of his critics, arguing that his destruction of temples has been exaggerated,[15][12] and noting that he also built temples,[16] paid for the maintenance of temples,[17] employed significantly more Hindus in his imperial bureaucracy than his predecessors did, and opposed bigotry against Hindus and Shia Muslims.[18]\n\nThe downfall of the Mughal Empire began near the end of his reign due to his political and religious intolerance.[19] Rebellions and wars eventually led to the exhaustion of the imperial Mughal treasury and army. The expansionary period of the Mughal Empire came to an end after his death despite him being an extraordinarily strong-handed authoritarian ruler. Nevertheless, the contiguous territory of the Mughal Empire still remained more or less intact until the reign of Muhammad Shah.[citation needed]\n\n..............\n\nHe had five sons:\n\nMuhammad Sultan- eldest son of Aurangzeb, born in 1638 of Nawab Bai and assisted Aurangzeb in the war of succession (1657–58) but later imprisoned by him in Gwalior Fort where he died in 1672.\n\nShah Alam/ future Bahadur Shah l(1707–12),born of Nawab Bai.\n\nAzam Shah-born of Dilras Banu Begum killed in the battle of Jajau(1708) with Bahadur Shah.\n\nAkbar- born of Dilras Banu Begum in 1657,rebelled in 1681 against his father and sought refuge in Persia where he died at Farah in 1708. (Mohammad Akbar of the House of the Timurid).\n\nKam Baksh- born 1667,youngest and dearest son of Aurangzeb,son of Udaipuri Begum, fought the war of succesion with Bahadur Shah l in 1709 and died of battle wounds in the same year at Hyderabad.\n\n[ref:Anuj Sah Gupta Anuj Sah Gupta, studied at Ramjas College, North Campus, Delhi University]"
