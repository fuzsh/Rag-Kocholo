Its monarchy was abolished after it was added to the Malayan Union but was restored and added to the Malayan Union's successor, the Federation of Malaya.\n\nQuick Facts Sultanate of Kedahكسلطانن قدح‎ (Malay)Kesultanan Kedah, Status ...\n\nClose\n\nThe information regarding the formation of this sultanate and the history before and after its creation comes from the \"Kedah Annals\". The annals were written in the 18th century, over a millennium after the formation of the supposed Kedah Kingdom. It describes the first king of Kedah as arriving on the shores of Kedah as a result of an attack by a mythical gigantic beast. It states that the nation was founded by the offspring of Alexander the Great. However, Thai chronicles mention that Kedah was a Thai city like Nakhon Si Thammarat and was a part of the Siamese kingdom but later was changed into a Malay state after invasion by Muslim kingdoms until today.[2]"
