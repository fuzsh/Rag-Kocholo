Why not look into that?\n\nThat is less likely to happen (road + rail) unless there is firm commitment to build rail system in the same time in the implementation of the tunnel. Otherwise it will end up destroying the business case for the tunnel.\n\nEven the tunnel itself is a huge undertaking for both the firm and even the state government. Of course, if the tunnel managed to be implemented (costly and without expense from the state government)......it will be a big milestone in Malaysia's history.\n\nszehoong\n\n· Moderator\n\nJoined Sep 11, 2002\n\n·\n\n16,331 Posts\n\nPerhaps things will settle down AFTER everybody got their turn driving on the said bridge?\n\nEveryone is a 'new toilet bowl' :lol:\n\nI think the bottle-next on the island landing would be very bad considering the road infrastructure there isn't too developed to divert the traffic. :yes:\n\nlohxy\n\n· Registered\n\nJoined Jun 4, 2009\n\n·\n\n1,058 Posts\n\n^^ It's toll free, why would ppl miss this opportunity. :lol:\n\nI guess it will continue for 1 month until toll is implemented.\n\nTheAmir259\n\n· Registered\n\nJoined Aug 11, 2013\n\n·\n\n478 Posts\n\n^^ It's toll free, why would ppl miss this opportunity. :lol:\n\nI guess it will continue for 1 month until toll is implemented.\n\nAgree.

Many road users still want to test drive on this bridge. But from my observation, express buses and lorries now use 2nd Bridge instead of 1st Bridge because near to industrial area both in island and mainland\n\nLeeighIam\n\n· Registered\n\nJoined Oct 7, 2008\n\n·\n\n1,181 Posts\n\n:cheers:\n\nIt's time to have a bridge that have rail track...\n\nBTW jambatan kedua Sdn Bhd Hahahaha didn't know they would use that name....\n\ntru that!!!! get people off the wheels! carpool or sumthin.\n\nAsHalt\n\n· Registered\n\nJoined Nov 8, 2013\n\n·\n\n1,512 Posts\n\nIs it me or all the new highways after EDL in JB, all used Jersey Barriers as the chosen median?\n\ntym11600\n\n· Registered\n\nJoined Nov 11, 2006\n\n·\n\n27 Posts\n\nMy drive video:"
