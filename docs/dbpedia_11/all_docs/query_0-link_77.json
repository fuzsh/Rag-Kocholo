        "text": "Alam Khan Lodi, son of Sultan Bahlol Lodi, was holding at the latter’s\n\ndeath in 1489 AD, the governorship of the pargana of Rapri (Mainpuri\n\ndistrict, U.P) and Chandwar (near Firuzabad town, Agra district, on the\n\nJamuna bank). The Bahluli nobles arraying themselves as supporters of\n\nprince Barbak Shah (son of Bahlul), governor of the Punjab and Delhi and\n\nprince Azam Humayun Khan (grandson of Bahlul), Nizam Khan seated\n\nhimself on the throne of Agra and Delhi, through the support of Umar\n\nKhan Sarwani, the Wazir. Prince Alam Khan being a partisan of prince\n\nAzam Humayun Khan, governor of Kalpi Sarkar (Jalaun district, U.P) was\n\nejected by Nizam Khan (who had taken the title of Sikander Shah) soon\n\nafter, from Rapri and Chandwar. He fled to his kinsman, Isa Khan Lodi,\n\ngovernor of Patiali (Etah district, U.P). Alam Khan, later on, submitted\n\nto Sikander, his powerful brother, who pardoned him and conferred on\n\nhim the governorship of Etawa district instead. Alam Khan’s son, Tatar\n\nKhan Lodi, was allowed to retain the governorship of Buksor, in the\n\npresent Unnao district of Awadh.\n\nWe do not hear any more of Alam Khan in the chronology of the sultanate\n\nof Delhi and Agra during the last of the reign of the Sultan Sikander\n\nLodior that of his son and successor Sultan Ibrahim, till we find him\n\nsuddenly in the kingdom of Gujarat during the reign of Qutbuddin\n\nMuzaffar Shah (1511-1524 AD). It can’t be definitely said whether he went\n\nthere during the reign of Sultan Sikander. On the other hand, if he had remained submissive to his brother, it is rather strange that he is not\n\nmentioned at all. He is not mentioned to have been implicated in the\n\nplot attempted by 22 nobles of his Kingdom in 1501, to dethrone him and\n\nplace in his stead prince Fateh Khan, his younger brother. The plot\n\nhaving been divulged to the Sultan, he deported or executed all of the\n\nparticipators. The deported nobles like Said Khan, Babo Khan, Rai\n\nGanesh, took refuge in the Gwalior where from they were expelled by Raja\n\nMansingh at the protest of the Sultan. Many of the conspirators\n\nincluding Tatar Khan Lodi of the Punjab seems to have made their way to\n\nthe kingdom of Gujarat. But it can’t be said whether Alam Khan was one of\n\nthem. Alam Khan according to the testimony of recorded history, came to\n\nthe kingdom of Gujarat during the reign of Ibrahim Lodi, and in 1523-24\n\nAD, he stated, one day to Muzaffar Shah, that he had been staying with\n\nhis majesty for a good time and asked for his permission to depart and\n\ncontest his paternal throne, in response to an invitation sent to him by\n\nthe nobles of the Punjab who had been tired of the right-handed and\n\noppressive poking of Sultan Ibrahim. Alam Khan got the permission to his\n\nfortune. The Sultan gave him, in addition, suitable amount for outfit\n\nand preparations. It is not unlikely that Alam Khan was a member of the\n\nconfederacy of the nobles of eastern districts, who under Islam Khan,\n\nson of Azam Humayun Khan Sarwani, rebelled against Sultan Ibrahim Lodi\n\nduring the early part of his reign. The league included Said Khan,\n\ngovernor of Lucknow Sarkar, Bahar Khan Nuhani of the Sarkar of Bihar and\n\nNasir Khan Nuhani, governor of Ghazipur.\n\nThe rebels were however defeated by Ibrahim after hard and contested\n\nbattles fought in Awadh. Daulat Khan Lodi, governor pf Punjab, revolted sometime later and had the support of his many sons who held districts\n\nin that province, and also officers and zamindars of the localities.\n\nDaulat Khan in order to strengthen his cause, invited Alam Khan from\n\nGujarat because the latter had a better claim to the sovereignty of the\n\ncountry. Alam Khan thus came away in the Punjab though his sons Bhikan\n\nKhan and Jalal Khan remained attached to Sultan Ibrahim, the latter up\n\nto the battle of Delhi, in 1525. the fourth Indian expedition of Babur\n\n(1525), resulting in the conquest of Punajb, was undertaken at the\n\nrequest of the party of Afghan nobles, headed by Alam Khan Lodi and\n\nGhazi Khan Lodi, sons of Daulat Khan Lodi, who went to Kabul with\n\npresents which included Indian Mangoes and ‘Pan’ (Betel-leaf). After the\n\nconquest of Punjab, Alam Khan was given by Babur the Jagir of Dipalpur\n\n(Montgomery district, Punjab, Pakistan) and Ghazi Khan was given\n\nSultanpur instead of Lahore which he coveted. Alam Khan could not retain\n\nhis jagir for long time, he was driven away by Daulat Khan. Alam sought\n\nBabur’s intervention against Daulat Khan who had meanwhile driven away\n\nthe Baburi officers from Punjab. While at Kabul, Alam Khan appears to\n\nhave entered into a pact with Babur to the effect that Babur would help\n\nAlam to regain his paternal throne, and that Babur would remain in the\n\noccupation of Punjab. After Babur’s departure to Kabul, Alam approached\n\nhis (Babur’s) officers in the Punjab for the promised help but they\n\nrefused to do so unless Ghazi Khan Lodi whom they distrusted had given\n\nhostages as pledge for good conduct. Upon this, Alam Khan entered into a\n\ntreaty with Daulat Khan, agreeing to transfer to Daulat the Punjab and\n\nretaining for himself, the rest of Lodi empire. It was perhaps on this\n\noccasion that he publicly assumed the title of Sultan Alauddin Alam\n\nShah, a name by which he is most often distinguished from his namesakes.\n\nAlauddin’s troops swelled to 40 thousand. He marched straight upon the\n\ncity of Delhi, being reinforced by Ismail Khan Jilawani and Jalal Khan\n\nJighat and nearly overwhelmed Sultan Ibrahim’s army in an organized\n\nnight-attack. The situation was retrieved by Sultan Ibrahim Lodi, who\n\nstood calmly at the center though the flanks had collapsed and delivered\n\nan attack on Alam’s troops engaged in collecting booty, as soon as the\n\nday dawned, Jalal Khan son of Sultan Alam fled towards the Doab and\n\nAlam Khan took the same way till he reached the fort of Gingata in the\n\nDooris. He later surrendered himself to Mir Khalifa, Babur’s\n\nWakil-us-sultana. He walked into Babur’s court naked and greatly\n\ndistressed. Babur condoned his treachery and didnt speak a word of\n\nreproach. On the other hand, everybody in the court stood up when Alam\n\nKhan was brought in.\n\nAlam Khan is next noticed as commanding the left center of Babur’s army\n\nat the battle of Khanwa in which his son Jalal Khan was also present.\n\nEarlier he held the nominated command of a section of Babur’s army at\n\nPanipat. Alam Khan is described in Babur’s memoirs as a “prince who has\n\nnear access to the Royal majesty”. He seems to have left Babur soon after, for, we learn from Babur. about the capture by the Mughals, of\n\none of Alam Khan Lodi in the battle of Dalman on the bank of Gumti.\n\nBadauni identifies him with Alam Khan Lodi. He was sent as a prisoner\n\nto Qila-i-Zafar in Badkhshan where from he escaped and reached Gujarat\n\nvia Baluchistan and Sindh, during the reign of Bahadur Shah. He became,\n\nalong with his sons, one of the principal instruments in stiffening the\n\nattitude of Sultan Bahadur towards Humayun. Humayun in his third letter\n\nto Sultan Bahadur complains of unfriendly act of the Gujarat in giving\n\nasylum to his rebel Kinsman Zaman Mirza and Alam Khan bin Bahlul Lodi\n\nand demanded Zaman’s surrender or expulsion from Gujarat. Bahadur\n\nrejected Humayun’s demand and at the suggestion of Tatar Khan bin Alam Khan, placed 20 lacs of tankas at the disposal of Tatar Khan for\n\nequipping an army. Tatar Khan boastingly marched towards Bayana with a\n\nview to capture Agra. His mercenary troops deserted him in large\n\nnumbers. He gave a fight to Mirza hindal with his remnants near Bayana\n\nand was defeated and slain."
