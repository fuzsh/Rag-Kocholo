        "text": "Maker of The Taj Mahal – Emperor Shah Jahan\n\nThe Fifth Mughal Emperor: Shah Jahan [1592 – 1666]\n\nReign 1628 – 1658 Full name Shahab-ud-din Muhammad Shah Jahan, also spelled Shah Jehan, Shahjehan Born 5 January 1592 Birthplace Lahore Died 22 January 1666 (aged 74) Place of death Agra Buried Taj Mahal Predecessor Jahangir Successor Aurangazeb Wives Akbarabadi Mahal (d. 1677), Kandahari Mahal (b. 1594, m. 1609) Mumtaz Mahal (b. 1593, m. 1612, d. 1631), Hasina Begum Sahiba (m. 1617), Muti Begum Sahiba, Qudsia Begum Sahiba, Fatehpuri Mahal, Sahiba (d. after 1666), Sarhindi Begum Sahiba (d. after 1650), Shrimati Manbhavathi Baiji Lal,Sahiba (m. 1626) Offspring Jahanara Begum, Dara Shukoh, Shah Shuja, Roshanara Begum, Aurangzeb, Murad Baksh, Gauhara Begum [Many more died at birth or at an early age] Dynasty Mughal Father Jahangir Mother Princess Manmati Religious beliefs Islam\n\nShahab Uddin Muhammad Shah Jahan (full title: Al-Sultan al-‘Azam wal Khaqan al-Mukarram, Abu’l-Muzaffar Shahab ud-din Muhammad, Sahib-i-Qiran-i-Sani, Shah Jahan I Padshah Ghazi Zillu’llah [Firdaus-Ashiyani]) ruled India from 1628 until 1658.\n\nFrom ‘Khurram’ to Shah Jahan: The blue-eyed of the Mughal Royals, the young ‘Khurram’ impressed his father the Emperor Jahangir with his intense military successes of 1617 against the Lodi in the Deccan, which effectively secured the southern border of the empire.The grateful father rewarded him with the prestigious title ‘Shah Jahan Bahadur ‘, which implicitly sealed his inheritance. The name Shah Jahan comes from Persian meaning “King of the World.”\n\nHis early years saw him receive a cultured, broad education and distinguish himself in the martial arts and as a commander of his father’s armies in numerous campaigns, where he became responsible for most of the territorial gains of his father’s reign. Khurrum also demonstrated a precocious talent for building, impressing his father at the age of 16 when he built his own quarters within Babur’s Kabul fort and redesigned several buildings within Agra fort.\n\nHe was the fifth Mughal ruler after Babur, Humayun, Akbar, and Jahangir. While young, he was a favourite of Akbar. Like Akbar, he was eager to expand his empire. Even while very young, he could be pointed out to be the successor to the Mughal throne after the death of Jahangir. He succeeded to the throne upon his father’s death in 1627. He is considered to be one of the greatest Mughals and his reign has been called the Golden Age of Mughals."
