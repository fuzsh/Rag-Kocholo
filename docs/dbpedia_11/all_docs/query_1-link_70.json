        "text": "History of Pahang. 35 Pahang thus contributed, on two sides, to the building up of the royal family of Perak. Sultan 'Abdu'l-Ghafur was succeeded in 1614 by his parrici- dal and piratical younger son whose name history does not disclose. An interesting account of the new ruler is given in the Tung Hsi Yang K'au: 1 \\\" This king, who killed his father and his brother, is reigning still. 2 He is in the habit of buying from Mau-su 3 pirates the men they have caught, and all the countries thereabout suffer severely from this. These Mau-su pirates are natives belonging to Bruni (Polo) ; they roam over the sea for the purpose of stealing men, whom they bring to Pahang and sell as slaves there. When one of them does r not obey his master, he is killed and used for the sacrifices. The price of a slave is about three pieces of gold. \\\" When a ship arrives there, it has to send fixed presents to the king. The latter has erected a number of shops, and the merchants can occupy in these as much as they want, paying accordingly. The people of the country come there to trade with them and the merchants live there also. These shops are not far from the ships ; when the watchmen on board cry out at night it can be heard by those who sleep on shore.\\\" In confirmation on their treaty with Johore at Malacca in August 1615, the Portuguese escorted \\\" the son of the king of Johore\\\" to Pahang to take possession of that State. The Portuguese-Johore treaty angered Iskandar Muda, ruler of Acheh, who having sacked Batu Sawar about September 1615, and put Sultan 'Abdu'llah to flight, wasted Pahang, in 1617, \\\"where a son of the brother of Sultan 'Abdu'llah Mammat of Johore ruled.\\\" 4 These statements seem at variance with the .Chinese accounts which say that the parricide prince, son of Sultan 'Abdu'l- Ghafur, who usurped the throne in 1614. was still ruling in 1618, but Pahang had become a piratical State in which revolts and disorder were rife; there were two competing princes, the scion of indigenous Pahang stock, son of Sultan 'Abdu'l-Ghafur, and Raja Bujang, (later Sultan 'Abdu'l-Jalil III), the nominee of Johore. When Iskandar Muda sacked Pahang in 1617 he carried off Sultan 'Abdu'l-Ghafur's younger brother Ahmad, the latter's son Iskandar Thani, and large numbers of the population. Peter van den Broeck relates that in Acheh he saw: 1Groeneveldt, foe. cit. IJn 1618. 3 ?Bajau. 'Bij . T . L. en V. Ser. 5, Vol. II, p . 246. 1936] Royal Asiatic Society. 36 W. Linehan. \\\" the king of Pahang 1 running in the train of the king of Acheh like a common person ; he (the ruler of Acheh) had conquered Pahang and carried off more than ten thousand of its inhabitants.\\\" Captain Best who visited Acheh in the early part of the seventeenth century, declared : \\\" The whole territory of Acheh was almost depopulated by wars, execution, and oppression. The king endeavoured to repeople the country by his conquests. Having ravage~ the kingdoms of Johor, Pahang, Kedah, Perak, and Deh, he transported the inhabitants from those place to Acheh to the number of twenty-two thousand persons. But this barbarous policy did not produce the effect he hoped ; for the unhappy people being brought naked to his dominions, and not allowed any kind of maintenance on their arrival, died of hunger in the streets.\\\" In 1629 the Portuguese were hard pressed by the Achinesc, but a fleet from Pahang helped Malacca. The Achinese were defeated and their commander the Laksamana was captured by the king of Pahang and handed over to the Portuguese. Barretto de Resende gives an account of Pahang about this period: \\\" The shortest voyages taken from Malacca are those to Pam, a port eighty leagues from Malacca. It belongs to the aforesaid king, who is very friendly to the Portuguese and is lord also of Jor and the maritime islands. Any ships may come to this port from Malacca without hindrance. They bring stuffs and opium in exchange for gold dust of the country and gold coin, bezoar stones, porcupine quills, a quantity of rice, agallochium from the coast, and also some wares which have been brought here by the southern natives who will not go to Malacca. In the same land there are two rivers belonging to the same king, where the Portuguese go to trade in the same merchandise. Facing th is place to the sea lies the small mountainous island of Pulo Timo thickly populated by Malays. Pigeons are plentiful, and there is a certain kind of animal called palandos which resembles a deer and is very good and fat. There arc very fine fresh water fish, rivers of excellent waler and an abu n- dance of figs and tar .... \\\"2 According to the Dagh-Register, on 10 December 1632 the Achinese suggested a sea-attack by the Dutch and themselves, 'Ahmad. 2\\\" Barretto de Resende's Account o{ Malacca,\\\" W.

Journal Mala)â€¢an Branch [Vol. XIV, Part II, History of Pahang. 37 with the king of Pahang as commander of the land force. But by 1634 Pahang and Johore were again siding with the friends of Portugal against the Dutch. On 9 November, 1634, the Dagh-Register records that fifty great galleons and five thousand men from Johore and Pahang had sailed to assist the rebel king of Patani in his war with Siam. The Dutch had espoused the cause of Siam against any force sent from Malacca, Johore, Pahang and other places. In November 1634 a Dutch fleet was instructed to sack Pahang where the Portuguese ships were harboured on their way to Malacca. In 1635 Iskandar Muda of Acheh again attacked Pahang in revenge for that country's assistance to Patani, and claimed the throne. On 25 November, 1635, Commander Coper of the yacht Cleijin Nassouw met an Achinese fleet coming from Pahang, and other places which it had ruined, taking many prisoners. Beau- lieu tells of a plot against the life of the Achinese Sultan which led to the execution of a son of the king of Pahang and a son of the ruler of Johore. In 1636 Iskandar Muda died, and was succeeded by Iskandar Thani, son of Ahmad of Pahang who had been led captive after the raid of 1617 and married to Iskandar Muda's daughter. The succession of a Pahang prince to the Achinese throne induced Pahang to make peace with Acheh at Bulang early in 1637, and in March of that year the \\\" Sultan and Laksamana of Pahang\\\" informed the Dutch that they desired an alliance against the Portuguese. The Sultan promised that he would make a strong fort in Johore to defend the country against the Portu- guese, and on 16 March, 1637 the treaty was signed in Pahang. The Dagh-Register here suggests that this Sultan was ruler of Pahang and Johore. In 1638-9, Sultan Iskandar Thani of Acheh sent gravestones to Pahang to commemorate his deceased relatives. The B1Jsian- al-Salaiin describes the event : \\\"Now His Highness.... said to the Orang Kaya-Kaya Maharaja and the Orang Kaya Laksamana and Seri Perdana Manteri and Orang Kaya Raja Lela Wangsa and all his warriors : ' Let us go to Pahang and place stones on the tombs of our illustrious relatives who are deceased.' They replied : 'God-willing, we shall carry out Your Highness' command.' They proceeded to fit out an expedition to proceed to Pahang. . . . . Then the Orang Kaya Maharaj a Seri Maharaja, and the warriors went into the presence of His Highness. Thereupon the Sultan .... proceeded to Kuala Nur Selawat escorting the tomb-stones for His Highness' deceased relatives. The stones were carried in procession accompanied by musical instruments, hundreds of umbrellas, standards, banners and pennons. 1936] Royal Asiatic Society. 38 W. Linehan. \\\" When Nur Selawat was reached, the stones were being put on board a large vessel when a boat unexpected!): arrive_d from Johore. Its captain, Tun Muhammad, went mto His Highness' presence and said : ' Your Highness, the ruler of Johore is at present attacking Pahang because he ha~ heard of the expedition which is being despatched by Your Highness with the object, he thinks, of spoiling him. The Orang Kaya Besar Penglima of Pahang 1 has fled into the interior; his son named Paduka Seri Maharaja and many warriors with him have been slain by the Raja of Johore and the ruler has gone to Patani.' When His Highness heard the news he kept silence for a moment and then said: 'What spell has been cast on Johore ? However anxious we are to improve the country it will not be improved ! We thought that the ruler of Johorc would receive the royal tomb-stones., \\\" His Highness forthwith commanded the Orang Kaya Maharaja Seri Maharaja, the Orang Kaya Laksamana, Seri Perdana Manteri, and Orang Kaya Raja Lela Wangsa and all the warriors to proceed to Pahang : ' Even if the Johore ruler will not receive the royal tomb-stones let us duly carry out the ceremony, but while we are on our way let us not ravage the bays and reaches of Johore.' All the afore- said (Chiefs and warriors) then made obeisance to His Highness, embarked and set sail. \\\" After some months they arrived at Pahang a nd the royal tomb-stones were taken ashore. The Orang Kaya- Kaya Seri Maharaja meticulously carried oul the ceremony in accordance with ancient custom; they kept vigil for forty days and forty nights, and many carriages and royal hearses (raja 'diraja) 2 were constructed, and the stones were taken in procession with all kinds of musical instruments, as was the custom when stones were placed on the tombs of great kings, and funeral feasts were given in honour of the illustrious deceased in exactly the same way as dead kings of yore were honoured .... \\\" The tomb-stones thus brought to Pahang were of the \\\" Chinese-lantern \\\" type of which specimens exist at Kota Raja, Acheh. The name of the grave-yard. in which they were placed is the \\\"Graves of the Leaning Tree,\\\" (Makam Chondong), or the \\\" Sepulchre of the Seven Brothers,\\\" (Makam Tujoh B eradek). 1We hear of a descendant of his in Pahang in 1740 when Sultan Sulaiman visited that country to repair the tomb of Sultan 'Abdu'l-J alil. He is described as\\\" Tun Dagang great grand-son of the Orang Kaya Besar.\\\" The rank was originally a military one and not hereditary. A holder of the title in the nineteenth century was Wan Ismail, a son of Bendahara Ali, a nd grand-father of the present Orang Kaya of Chl!nor. :In ancient Malay States the Chief known as Raja ' diraja was entrusted with the supervision of royal burials, hence his name came to be applied to the royal funeral bier (cf. the origin of the English words \\\" boycott \\\" and \\\"macadam.\\\") The Malay term is now obsolete. Journal Malayan Branch [Vol. XIV, Part II, History of Pahang. 39 Which of Iskandar Thani's relatives do the tomb-stones commemorate? The weather, and the ravages of elephants, have played havoc with the stones and their inscriptions. One tomb can definitely be identified: that of Marhum Muda 'Abrlu'l- lah, son of Sultan 'Abdu'l-Ghafur of Pahang and first cousin of the Achinese ruler, who was murdered in 1614. Another, a female grave, may be that of Puteri Bongsu Chendera Dewi, mother of Sultan Iskandar Thani, and grand-daughter of Sultan Mansur II. The ruler of Pahang at the time of the Johore attack in 1638 appears to have been the parricide son of Sultan Â·Abdu'I-Ghafur. The Sultan of Johore from 1623 onwards was 'Abdu'l-Jalil Shah III. He it was, apparently, who attempted to establish his rule in Pahang in 1615-1617, and his ambition to dominate the country, coupled with his jealousy of the Pahang-Achinese connection, led to his attack on that State in 1638. In 1617 Pahang was wasted by the Achinese for harbouring a Johore prince; in 1638 she s uffered at the hands of that same prince for her alliance with the Achinese. The raid by Johore in 1638 caused Iskandar Thani of Acheh, who regarded himself as the suzerain of Pahang, to break off negociations with the Dutch for a joint attack on Malacca. The Achinese ruler made a formal complaint to the Dutch and refused to assist them while they remained friends of Johore. Malacca fell to the Dutch on 14 January, 1641, and I skandar Thani died on 15 February. He was succeeded by a woman, Acheh's claim to Pahang was abandoned, and Johore was given a free hand. In European records, from 1623 onwards, we hear sometimes (particularly from the Portuguese) of a king of Pahang, again of a king of Pahang-Johore, and again of a king of Johore- the reference, in all cases, whatever was the actual position in Pahang, seems to have been to Sultan 'Abdu'l-Jalil III. The region of the Pahang river, depopulated by raids, massacres, and transportations had become a haunt of pirates ruled over by a descendant of the ill-fated 'Abdu'l-Ghafur. Sultan 'Ahdu'l-Jalil did not make his rule effective in the country till the death of I skandar Thani in 1641. From that date to 1673 Pahang was governed by the Yam Tuan Muda Raja Bajau, the son of Sultan 'Abdu'llah Ma'ayat Shah by a Pahang princess who was the half-sister of Iskandar Thani. According to Schouten, this prince of \\\" Sea-rovers,\\\" (a name probably derived from his Brunai connections), as early as 1641, had been designated heir to the Pahang-Johore Sultana te. The relics left by the Achinese in Pahang were few: tombs of the type known as \\\" Achinese Stones \\\" found here and there, the elaborate lantern tomb-stones at Makam Tujoh Beradek, Pekan Lama, brought to Pahang in 1638, the name of a locality Belukar Acheh. the name of a rapids in the Telom, J eram Musoh 1936] Royal Asiatic Society. 40 W. Linehan. Karam, which is said to commemorate the wreck of invading Achinese boats. Achinese gold coins known as dinar Acheh have been found in Pekan Lama. Malays of the present day use them as azimat or talismans. The practice, prevalent in Pahang up to comparatively recent years, of sending students of religion to Acheh for instruction, probably originated in the period of Achinese domination. The history of Pahang during the period of Achinese suzer- ainty provides melancholy reading. Invaded and ravaged by the Achinese, by Johore, by the Portuguese, and the Dutch, all within the space of half a century, large numbers of her popula- tion slain, or carried into captivity to die of starvation in the streets of the Achinese capital, distracted by revolts, Pahang, once a State of importance, had degenerated into a haunt of pirates. There was, however, in addition, an economic factor operating towards her decay. The unsettled conditions resulting from the struggle between the Dutch and the Portugese, and the wars of Acheh, had induced traders from the east to land their goods in Pahang for safety, and to send them by the old trade route up the Bera and the Serting, then by portage into the head-waters of the l\\\\luar and so to .Malacca, instead of venturing the journey hy sea around the Peninsula beset by rival fleets and infested by pirates. This land trade was naturally of benefit to Pahang. The defeat of the Portuguese in 1641 had the effect of freeing the sea-way for those traders whose destination was Malacca, and there was no longer any occasion to utilize the Pahang route. From about 1550 Menangkabau settlers had been pouring into Pahang through Ulu Muar, and had partly opened up the interior, mined gold in the Jelai and its tributaries, (a well-known gold-producing district in d'Eredia's day). dealt in jungle produce, elephant ivory and the like. Their trade was almost entirely with Malacca, and the bulk of it passed by the land-route to that city. The circumstances of their trade made the Menangkabaus side with the Portuguese rather than with the Dutch (though they helped Johore to blockade Malacca in 1586). The victory of the Dutch severely damaged the growing overland trade of the Pahang .Menangkabaus. In October 1644 the Dagh-Register records that, fearing treachery from the king of J ohore (now the ally of their enemies the Dutch), \\\"the Menangkabaus very bravely removed their property from Pahang.\\\" The reference was to a temporary and partial exodus. Let us try and picture a Pahang Malay of the period with which we have been dealing (the early part of the seventeeth century), by stock, a mixture of the Malacca Muslim Malay and of the pre-Malaccan inhabitants of the country; in his religion he tended towards animism tempered by Buddhism and Hinduism Journal Malayan Branclt [Vol. XIV, Part II, â€¢ History of Pahang. 41 I with a gradually increasing proclivity towards Islam. He had not yet abandoned the practice of making human sacrifices to Kali the Hindu goddess of death. Islam was introduced as the State religion about the middle of the fifteenth century. There may have been followers of Islam in Pahang, as there certainly were in Trengganu, before this period, but an important factor in the conversion to the new religion of the Pahang peasant living in the interior appears to have been the immigration of the Menangkabaus which began in the second half of the sixteenth century. The shrines of Saiyids, scattered here and there throughout the country, probably mark the resting- places of the original apostles of Islam. Islamic influence was naturally more marked at the capital but it had not filtered far into the interior until the advent of the Menangkabaus. The Pekan Malay, influencing his pagan predecessors, was himself influenced by the people whom he had conquered. His language, praised by Abdullah in the nineteenth r.entury for its purity, was in the 15th and 16th centuries full of strange provin- cialisms some of which must have been derived from the northern element in his stock; in the Hikayat Hang Tiiah the Pekan women modestly excuse themselves for the \\\"jargon \\\" which they spoke. The Malay of the seventeenth century, in his ways, was probably not far distant from his pre-Malaccan predecessors of whom Chinese chroniclers have left a description. The principles of his new religion had not yet been sufficiently inculcated into him to make him averse from toddy and arrack in the manufacture of which he was an expert. On 3 April 1641 the Dagh-Register set forth the dominions of the Johore kingdom: no part of Pahang was included but Rembau, the traditional boundary, on that side, of the old State of Pahang was mentioned. On 20 October, 1642, the Dutch made a treaty with Palembang whereby the people of Palembang were allowed to voyage with the Company's passes to Pahang and other places carrying merchan- dise not prejudical to the Company's interest but no pepper. On 6 July,'1643, the Dutch made a treaty with Jambi according to the terms of which all Jambi ships faring to Pahang and elsewhere were to be treated as enemies unless they had passes from the Dutch Resident at Jambi. In May 1644 the Sultan of Johore sent a letter to the Gover- nor-General of Batavia by Seri Maharaja Lela and Raja Lela Wangsa in which he explained that certain malfactors of Rembau and Tampin who had murdered some Dutchmen were not subject~ of his, but Menangkabaus, tenants of the Bendahara. On 27 July 1647 an Englishman named Wylde visited Johore in the Si,pply. He records that \\\"the chief commodities are tin, pepper, aggula and elephant's teeth .... \\\" These goods came from 1936] Royal Asiatic Society. 42 W.

The Sultan opposed the marriage and in the following year the engagement was broken off. The Yarn Tuan Muda joined the Laksamana in the numerous Johore attacks on Jarnbi. 1 In 1673 Johore was sacked by the Jambis, and the aged Sultan 'Abdu'l-Jalil III, with his subjects, fled to Pahang where he resided till his death in November, 1677. Bort records that : \\\" Songujongh and Calangh produce yearly about four hundred Chaers of tin whereof Malacca gets a very small share, since most of it is taken to Aatchin and Bencalis also to Pahangh and Riouw. The last is now beginning to come to an end, the people there being Manicabers who, since the conquest of Johor by the Jarnbinese and the flight of the king thence to Pahang, have not rendered their due obeisance to that Kingdom and do still less now, being suspected of siding with the rebellious people of Nanning and Rombouw.\\\" Bort mentions the visit to Malacca of vessels \\\" from Pahang where the king of Johor now holds his court.\\\" He refers to Bengkalis as a trading mart for boats from Pahang and elsewhere. In the year 1674 the Dagh-Register records that Seri Nara 'diraja of Johore had waylaid two notorious Jambi pirates, Lang- passir and Parnpouassa, captured the former and taken him to Pahang to the king of Johore who had his hands and feet cut off, his back-bone cut open, and the wounds smeared with salt and pepper. In the same year the Laksarnana and Yam Tuan Muda raided the Jambi river. In January 1678, Malay envoys reported at Malacca the death of their childless ninety-year old king. Sultan 'Abdu'l- . Jalil III came to the throne in 1623; he died in Pahang on 22 November, 1677, and was known posthumously as Markum M angkat di-Pahang, \\\" the late Sultan who died in Pahang.\\\" Â·Abdu'l-Jalil was succeeded by Sultan Ibrahim the son of the Yam Tuan Muda of Pahang (Raja Bajau) who had died in 1676. The Ti,i,Jifat-al-Nafis relates that in 1678 Sultan Ibrahim removed to Riau, the home of the Laksamana and a good base for opera- tions against Jambi. 'In the\\\" History of Johore,\\\" (J.M. B. R. A. S., Vol. X, Pt. III, 1932, pp. 43-46), this Yam Tuan Muda is confused with Marhum Muda 'Abdu'llah who was killed in 1614. Journal Malayan Branch [Vol. XIV, Part II. History of Pahang. 43 In June 1679 the Johore-Pahang ruler had three hundred well-armed vessels ready to surprise Jambi and had found a Bugis ally, Daeng Mengika, whose race was destined to play an important part in Peninsular history. After the defeat of Jambi, Daeng Mengika abandoned Johore for Palembang, and in January ,. 1681 the Paduka Raja of Johore and his son the young Laksa- mana helped Jambi to defeat Palembang and the Bugis. The old Laksamana or Paduka Raja had by this time become the most important personage in the land next to his royal son-in- law and, ingratiating himself with the nobles, had grown so bold that he no longer paid proper respect to the Sultan who had be- come jealous of his powerful and ambitious Chief. This, no doubt, was the Laksamana who had killed a Temenggong at Tanjong Batu in 1677. Two letters from Sultan Ibrahim and his father-in-law the Laksamana Paduka Raja arrived at Batavia on 2 April 1682, from their new capital. The Paduka Raja described his master as the first ruler of Johore-Pahang. The Sultan and his Chiefs were about to remove their head-quarters to Johor Lama. They sent the Governor-General, among other presents, Tioman mats. On 16 February 1685 Sultan Ibrahim died; poisoned, rumour said, by some of his wives. His son Sultan Mahmud was a minor. His mother was appointed regent and her father, the Paduka Raja, became the power behind the throne. Soon afterwards the Paduka Raja's enemies gained the upper hand, and he was forced to flee to Trengganu where he died in l 1688. He was succeeded by Bendahara Seri Maharaja, Tun ' Habib 'Abdu'l-Majid, who may have been the signatory to the Dutch treaty of 1685 described as \\\" Dato' Bendahara Maharaja, son of Dato' Seri Maharaja.\\\" He at once took Sultan Mahmud to Kota Tinggi. This Bendahara, who died in 1697, is claimed as an ancestor by the present royal families of Pahang and Johore. Sultan Mahmud, ruler of Johore-Pahang, the last and the ' most crazy of his line, was a degenerate pervert. His life has been described by Malay chroniclers, and by Hamilton a contemporary English visitor to Johore. According to the Malays, ever lenient to the sins of their princes, Sultan Mahmud was under the influence of the moon - a lunatic-and, being married to a fairy (berbini peri), could look with favour on no mortal woman. His Benda- hara was 'Abdu'l-J alil a son of Bendahara Habib 'Abdu'-1-Majid. These officers of State, always powerful, had further extended their influence in the seventeenth century, and in addition to their court dignities, had become territorial magnates. 'Abdu'l-Jalil profited by the Sultan's weakness to undermine his master's authority. In 1699 Mahmud wantonly murdered the wife of one of his captains. The victim's husband, Megat Seri Rama, with the 1936l Royal Asiatic Society. --- 44 W. Linehan. connivance of the Bendahara, plotted revenge. When the con- spirators' plans were ready, Mahmud's guards were attacked and killed; the Sultan himself, as he was being carried on the back of one of his attendants to bathe, was stabbed to death with a long creese. According to Malay tradition the dying ruler hurled a spear at his murderer which wounded him in the foot, and from that day onwards, grass grew in the wound because the murderer dared to shed the white blood of royalty ! The Tuhfat-al-Najis, records that the Temenggong, and Raja Indera Bongsu, as well as the Bendahara, were implicated in the murder.

On Mahmud's death, Bendahara 'Abdu'l-Jalil became Sultan, his supporters invoking the constitutional theory that if there were no heirs to a ruler, the Bendahara should succeed to the throne. If one Malay version is to be believed, 1 'Abdu'l-Jalil secured his position by killing all the wives of Mahmud who were pregnant, but one of them, Che Mi, escaped to Menangkabau, and had a son later styled Raja Kechil-the Menangkabau pre- tender to the throne. The title of 'Abdu'I-Jalil's children was raised from Tim to Tengku. Raja Indera Bongsu Tun Mahmud, a younger brother of 'Abdu'I-Jalil who, before the death of Sultan Mahmud, had demanded his price as a conspirator in the assassina- tion-plot, was made Yam Tuan Muda (or Raja Muda). According to the Salasilah Melayi, dan Bugis,2 when 'Abdu'I-Jalil was made Sultan, one of his brothers Temenggong Abdullah was appointed Bendahara to replace Tun Mas Anom who had died. We get a glimpse of conditions at Kuala Endau, Pahang' in 1703 from an English chronicler Vaughan who, with his com- pan ions, was cast ashore at that place early in the year. 3 The head-man gave the ship-wrecked mariners boiled yams, salt and fresh water. and demanded fifty dollars to take them to Johore. The inhabitants numbered only fifteen men, and the place was infested by tiger and wild pig. \\\" Captain De4uallo \\\" (Captain di-Kuala-the head-man) owned land \\\"on the banks of a small river' that runs from the Northward into the great one about half way from his house to the river's mouth.

'Abdu'l-Jalil was unfitted to control _h!s turbulent subje~ls; his people said of him that he was too reh_gious to be a ,9otohdankmh~is.

In 1708 the Sultan and the Raja Muda retired to Riau. Four years later a rebellion fostered by Menang- kabaus broke out in theRiau-JohoreState. 'Abdu'l-Jalil invoked the help of the Bugis Chief Upu Daing Parani. Tengku Mandak, one of 'Abdu'l-Jalil's daughters, slighted by Raja Kechi!, cast her ear-rings into Upu's lap, and offered to marry him if he would help to defeat the Menangkabaus.2 'Abdu'l-Jalil and the Yam Tuan Muda retreated to Johor Lama. The Sultan's brother was \\\"a clever and intelligent man \\\" who acquired great riches and surro- unded himself by a powerful force. He was said to have had 1,000 pieces of cannon mostly of bronze, 2,000 guns, and two large store-houses filled with arms and ammunitions, 5,000 men-al- arms, and large quantities of gold. 3 Fighting continued intermittently till 1718. In a sea- battle, owing to the treachery of some of his Chiefs, the majority of the king's fleet went over to Raja Kechi!. Early in 1718 Raja Muda encountering his Menangkabau enemies led by the pretender Raja Kechi!, who was supported by the Laksamana faction , and by Bugis mercenaries, fled. In his new place of refuge the Yam Tuan Muda was engaged in a game of chess when a follower rushed into his house, shouting \\\"The enemy Your Highness ! \\\" Tun Mahmud, absorbed in his game, thought the reference was to his opponent's moves on the chess-board, and said testily : \\\"What is all this talk about the enemy: the enemy move here and there!\\\" When at last he realized his peril he ran amuck, killed his wives and children, and was himself slain. This Raja Muda whose death occurred in 1718 was known posthumously as Yam Tuan Muda m~ngkat di-Kayu.

Civil stiife had broken out in Pahang in 1716 between two brothers of the Sultan, Bendahara Tun 'Abdu'llah and Temeng- gong Tun Mutahirwhoapparently supported 'Abdu'l-Jalil's cause. The two brothers fought and killed one another. This fact is not recorded in our histories, but other evidence bears it out. In a paper on \\\" An Eighteenth Century Tomb at Pekan Lama\\\" 1 are described graves which, according to tradition, are those of \\\" an Achinese Tengku Mutahir who killed his brotherTengku 'Abdullah in a fight and was himself slain. They were buried side by side.\\\" The inscription on Mutahir's tomb gives the date of his death as the 23rd Shaaban 1128 A.H. (12th September 1716 A.D.), but not his name. 'Abdu'llah's tomb-stone, which has disappeared, is said to have had inscribed thereon his name, and a similar date. It was natural for the sons of a Bendahara with Achinese connec- tions (Tun Habib 'Abdu'l-Majid) to have been described by the Pahang people, who had bitter cause to remember that nation, as Achinese. It appeared that another brother of Sultan 1'Abdu'l- J alil, Tun 'Abdu'l-Jamal, succeeded 'Abdu'llah as Bendahara. After visiting Trengganu, where he left his son Tun Husain 2 in charge, 'Abdu'l-Jalil proceeded to Pahang, and opened a settle- ment at Kuala Pahang. There he was joined by Raja Indera Bongsu who had taken refuge in Malacca. In 1720 Raja Kechi! sent his Laksamana, Nakhoda Che Sekam, to Kuala Pahang to bring the Sultan willy-nilly to Riau. 'Abdu'l-Jalil declined the invitation, so Che Sekam's forces attacked Kuala Pahang and captured it. Raja Kechil's emissary then renewed the invitation, offering the Sultan two vessels in which to make the journey with bis family and retinue. The Sultan had to agree. At this stage Che Sekam received a letter from Raja Kechil, cancelling former orders, and instructing him to kill the fugitive ruler. Che Sekam did not relish the task but had to obey. He sent four of his captains, clad in coats of mail, with their men to carry out his master's instructions. The Menangkabaus quietly boarded 'Abdu'l-Jalil's boat, and while he was on a praying mat, performing his devotions, they hacked at him with their swords. The Sultan jumped up, seized one of his enemies' weapons and he and his followers killed eight Menangkabaus before he succumbed. Tengku Tengah, one of his daughters, hearing of her father's death rushed on deck and attacked the murderers. As they were 1J. M. B. R. A. S., Vol. IV, No. III, p. 333. â€¢ He became kno_wn as Bendahara di-Tre11ggam1: Appendix II, infra. 1936] Royal Asiatic Society. ------------------~ ------ 48 W. Linehan. about to retaliate Che Sekam shouted : \\\" Let her be ; if you kill the princess Raja'Kechi! will slay you and your families ! \\\" The Menangkabaus then dropped overboard, and Tengku Jen_gah was taken to her cabin. Che Sekam came on board and, with tears in his eyes,\\\" prepared the Sultan's body for burial, and had it interred at Teluk Kandang 1 which, from that occurrence, became known as Kampong Marhmn. The Orang Kaya Na~a Wangsa, Tun Hamid, described in the Batavian Hikayat Negeri }ohor as a son of 'Abdu'l-Jalil, was killed with him. The dead Sultan was known to posterity by the name Marhum Ki,ala Pahang. The Hikayat }ohor serta Pahang (MS.), wrongly says that he was buried above the Sungai Pekan, mista- kenly identifying his tomb with that of \\\"'Abdu'l-Jalil\\\" who died in 1511. Now that the Sultan was dead, the Bendahara (? Tun 'Abdu'l-Jamal) claimed the throne, but Raja Kechi) refused to recognise his claim.2 Raja Sulaiman, who had been captured by the Menang- kabaus when his father was killed at Kuala Pahang, escaped from his captors and proceeded to Ulu Pahang where he solicited the help of \\\" the Deformed Bendahara,\\\" (Bendahara P ekok ), in the operations against the Menangkabau pretender. According to the TuJifat al-Nafis, this Bendahara was an uncle of Sulaiman. If so, he may have been Tun 'Abdu'I-Jamal. On the other hand a Pahang tradition makes mention of an Abbas (? one of the elder brothers of Sultan Sulaiman) who resided at Semantan in Pahang. The fact that Tun Abbas was passed over for the succession to the Sultanate gives colour to the view that he was the ' Deformed Bendahara,' though the reason given by Malay chron iclers was that he, and another brother Tun Hussain, were not considered as they had been born before their father Sultan 'Abdu'l-Jalil came to the throne. On 4 October 17 22 the Bugis, who by this time had recovered from Raja Kechil the Johore-Pahang state regalia, installed Raja Sulaiman as Sultan with the title of Sultan Sulaiman Badru'l- Alam Shah. The new ruler made a formal agreement with his protectors whereby the respective powers of the Malays and Bugis were defined. About the same time Tun Abbas was appointed Bendahara Seri Maharaja. There was a wholesale marrying, and giving in marriage between the Bugis Chiefs and ladies of the Malay noble families. One of these Chiefs, who afterwards became known as To' Tuan, founded a _settlement ~t Kampong Mengkasar near Pekan Lama. He w~s said to_ have improved _the _art of silk weaving in Pekan ~the village w~ich ~e founded is still the centre of t he weaving industry). This Chief was an ancestor, on the female side, of 1The Pasir Kandang oI the \\\"Malay Annals.\\\" 2Sejal'a Raja-Raja Riouw. Journal Malayan Branch [Vol, XIV, Part II, History of Pahang. 49 the Shahbandar family of Pahang. He was buried at Pekan Lama, and his grave is revered as a shrine to the present day. The eldest of the Bugis Chiefs, Upu Daing Marewah (son of Daing Parani), also known as Upu Kelana Jaya Putera, was appointed Yang di-pertuan Muda. An old Bugis Chief Daing Manompo took the title of Raja Tua, and married Tun Tipah an aunt of Sultan Sulaiman. It is uncertain whether Temenggong Tun Mutahir or Tun Abbas was the father of Tun 'Abdu'l-Majid (Bendahara of Pahang ca. 1770-1802) from whom the Pahang Sultans are descended. One writer, the author of the Hikayat Negeri Pahang (MS .), takes an easy way out of the difficulty by commencing with 'Abdu'l-Majid and ignoring all mention of this Chief's ancestors. There are genealogical trees in abundance : the Kampong Gelam, Johore and Pahang lists of descent, but family trees often erred in details, they were sometimes altered to suit political or family considerations, and compilers have been known to make mistakes even in the names of personages contemporary with them. The question of 'Abdu'l-Majid's descent is dealt with else- where in this history. 1 Suffice to say here that, on the evidence at present available, it is likely that this Chief's father was Tun 'Abbas, and that his ancestry was as follows : Bendahara Tun Habib 'Abdu'l-Majid (Mar/mm Padang Saujana ; died in 1697). I Sultan 'Abdu'l-Jalil IV (Marlium Kuala Pahang; killed in 1720). I I I Sultan lutaiman Bendahara Husain Bendahara Abbas. (Bendahara (reigned 1722-1760) . di-Trengganu). I I Tun Inah. Bcndahara 'Abdu'l-Majid (married (i) Tun Inah, (ii) a Bugis princess of Endau ; born ca. 1715 ; Bendahara ca. 1770 ; died ca. 1802). Between the year 1722 and the middle of the century there was intermittent fighting between the pretender Raja Kechil and the Bugis, backed by Sultan Sulaiman, but the Sultan and his Malays, after all danger from Raja Kechi! had disappeared-the Menangkabau pretender went mad, and died in 1746-got tired 1Appendix II, itifra. 1936] Ro-yal Asiatic Society. 50 W. Linehan. of their domineering allies, and in 1745, Sulaiman with Sultan Mansur of Trengganu, and the Raja Indera Bongsu Tun Hasan invoked Dutch assistance against the Bugis. In 1740 Sultan Sulaiman sailed to Pahang and built a wall around his father's tomb. Among the royal retinue were Dato' Bendahara Tun Husain (the Bendahara di-Trengganu) brother of His Highness, Tun 'Abdu'l-Rahman son of Dato' Temenggong Tun Mutahir, Tun 'Abdu'l-Majid, Raja Muhammad son of Raja Muda Mangkat di-Kayu Anak, Tun Sulong Muda s,m o( Dato' Paduka Maharaja, Tun Pasang son of Dato' SewaÂ· Raja, Tun Bayan, Tun Hasan son of Orang Kaya Seri Nara 'diraja grand-son of the Laksamana, and Tun Dagang great grand-son of Orang Kaya Besar. The Sultan summoned Indera Pahlawan from the interior and took him to Riau. Included in the prince's following were the Bendahara Tua of Pahang, and a son of Bendahara Tun Husain who, after bidding farewell to the Sultan, returned to Trengganu. The Orang Kaya Besar, whose great grand-son was Tun Dagang, we have met before. He was the Orang Kaya Besar Penglima of Pahang who fled to the interior when that State was sacked by Johore in 1638. lndera Pahlawan was the Orang Kaya Indera Pahlawan of Chenor, one of the four Major Chiefs, and this is the first mention in our Malay chronicles of the title in Pahang. In 1738 Sultan Sulaiman visited Kuala Endau. The head- men of the nine proto-Malay tribes (Suku Biduanda) came before him and he gave them titles. A memento of this royal visit was the mas manah or ambur-ambur (largesse) distri- buted by the Sultan among the people: octagonal, base gold coins which occasionally are still met with among the descendants of the tribes of Endau. The coin bears the legends, on the obverse, Sultan Sulaiman Shah, and on theÂ·reverse, Khalifat al-Muminin \\\" Lord of the Faithful.\\\" Raja Kechil ruled Siak which was nominally a part of the Riau-Johore-Pahang kingdom. When he became afflicted by a mental disease in 1736, both his sons claimed the Siak throne, one of them Raja Muhammad (Buang) a nephew of Sultan Sulaiman. As early as 1745, the Bugis Chiefs of Selangor had elected Daing Kemboja (Marhum Janggut) to succeed Daing Chelak as Yam Tuan Muda, but it was not till 1748 that he went to Riau to be installed by Sultan Sulaiman. According to the Sejarah Raja-Raja Riouw, in 1748 the oath between Bugis and Malays was renewed, the Yam Tuan Besar, Yam Tuan Muda and Raja Indera Bongsu Tun Hasan taking part. About the same time Tun Hassan was created Bendahara Seri Maharaja. On 6 January 1756 Sultan Sulaiman arrived at Malacca accompanied by his heir 'Abdu'l-Jalil (Raja di-Baroh), Sultan Jaurnal Malayan Branch [Vol. XIV, Part II, History of Pahang. 51 Mansur of Trengganu, and the Bendahara Seri Maharaja (Tun Hasan) and signed a treaty with the Dutch. In May 1757 Daing Kemboja was driven to Linggi but he was attacked by a strong combined fleet which captured the place in December. Sultan Sulaiman now tried to get the better of his insubordinate Bugis subjects by giving up Rembau and Linggi to the Dutch. This cession was signed on 12 December by Sultan Sulaiman, Sultan Mansur of Trengganu and Temenggong 'Abdu'l- Majid (later, Bendahara of Pa.hang). Sultan Sulaiman died in 1760, having before his death made friends with the Bugis. In January 1761 Sulaiman's successor Sultan 'Abdu'l-Jalil Muadzam Shah (Raja di-Baroh) died in Selangor, poisoned accord- ing to the Malays. In February Daing Kemboja brought the body to Riau and proclaimed himself guardian of Sultan Ahmad Riayat Shah, the young son of the deceased. This boy soon died, perhaps also from poison, and though the Malays pressed for a brother of Sultan Sulaiman as his successor, the Bugis forces overawed the Benda.hara and Temenggong and carried the election of Mahmud, an infant son of Raja di-Baroh, born in 1760. Hearing of the death of Daing Kemboja in 1777 his nephew the Yam Tuan Muda of Riau, Raja Haji, proceeded to Pahang. According to the Ti,hfat al-Najis, when Daing Kemboja fought the sea-fight at Singapore in 1764 Tun Hasan was Benda- hara. By 1770 Temenggong 'Abdu'l-Majid had become Benda- hara and in 1777 created Raja Haji, Yam Tuan Muda. Sultan Mahmud, accompanied by Raja 'Abdu'l-Samat of Selangor, a son of MarhumJanggut (Daing Kemboja}, sailed to Pabang to welcome Raja Haji to whom a son named Raja Pahang had been born. Raja Haji was killed in an unsuccessful attack on Malacca in 1784, and his ally Sultan Ibrahim of Selangor fled to Bernam and thence to Pa.hang. There, according to tradition, he married Tun Sela.mah, a daughter of the Benda.hara of Pa.hang, and it was after him that Tanjong Selangor near Pahang Tua was named. Aided by Pahang, the Sultan returned to Ulu Selangor. In October 1784 the Dutch attacked and captured Riau, driving out the Bugis. In November 1784 a formal treaty was made between the Dutch and the Malays whereby the Sultan and his Chiefs acknowledged that Riau had become by right of war the property of the Dutch, which the Malays would hold as a fief under certain conditions. The Sultan, because of his youth, would decide nothing except in consultation with the Raja Tua (the Dutch had driven out the Bugis Yam Tuan Muda), Raja Benda.hara ('Abdu'l-Majid), Raja Temenggong, and Raja Bongsu. All Bugis not born in Riau were to be expelled. All vessels from Johore, Pa.hang and other states that passed Malacca were com- pelled to take out a Dutch pass there. In February 1785 Raja Ali addressed a letter to Bengal asking for English assistance against the Dutch. In June 1785 1936] Royal Asiatic Societ,,. 52 W. Linehan. his brother-in-law Sultan Ibrahim of Selangor, with Bendahara 'Abdu'l-Majid of Pahang assisted Sultan M.ahmud in ?riving ~he Dutch out of Riau. After their victory the Malay Chiefs, feanng a counter-attack, fled, the Bendahara returning to Pahang with one hundred and fifty sail. Sultan Mahmud now asked Capt. Light for authority to hoist a British flag on his fort. In t~e same year Raja 'Ali had requested a passage through Rembau m order to attack Malacca from Pahang, but the Rembau Chiefs refused it. On 7 February, 1786 a treaty was signed between the Sultan and the Dutch whereby, among other matters, he was freed of the guardianship of the Raja Tua, Raja Bendahara, Raja Temenggong and Raja Indera Bongsu, and would consult them only on high matters of state. Among other provisions, Pahang was to admit no Chinese or other junks to its ports but to direct them to Riau for payment of customs dues ! In December 1786 Sultan Mahmud, accompanied by the Bendahara Tun 'Abdu'l-Majid, the Temenggong and the Raja Indera Bongsu visited Malacca. At the same time, it was said, he sent one Talib (probably the eldest son of Bendahara 'Abdu'l- Majid) to entreat the ruler of Tempasok and his Ilanun pirates to rid him of the Dutch. In 1788 Sultan Mahmud fled to Pahang where four soldiers captured at Riau heard that he had sent Raja Indera Bongsu to Solok to ask the Ilanuns to attack Malacca over-land from Pahang. On 20 May 1790 the Sultan of Trengganu, with whom the Riau- Johore ruler had taken refuge, wrote to the Dutch at Malacca enquiring whether they would prefer Sultan Mahmud to live at Riau under their eyes or in Pahang. In 1795 the Dutch made peace with Mahmud, and restored Lingga (Riau) to him. Except for some scraps of information collected here and there we know little about Pahang in the eighteenth century. It formed part of the Riau-Johore State and followed the politics of that kingdom. The Pahang Chiefs supported the Sultan in his wars against the pretender Raja Kechil. The Bugis made their appearance on the Malayan stage ; they allied themselves with the Sultan, became the dominant partner in the coalition and made and.unmade rulers. In the latter half of the century, the Pahang Bendahara grew tired of his over-powering friends and petitioned both Dutch and English for help to drive them out of Riau.1 In the same century Pahang became the special province of the Bendaharas. The first Bendahara of Pahang of whom we have authentic information was Tun 'Abdu'l-Majid who was elevated to that dignity about 1770. The allegiance of the Bendaharasto the Riau-Johore ruler continued, though it weakened in time. These potentates, as the senior Chiefs, had the privilege 1Scjarah Raja-Raja RioHw. Journal Malayan Branch [Vol. XIV, Part II, History of Pahang, 53 of installing Sultans, and were themselves installed by Sultans. They were the fully accredited representatives (wakil mutallak) of the sovereign in Pahang, and in fact assumed to themselves all their Sultan's prerogatives. They exercised the power of capital punishment, and occasionally even delegated that power to their head-men. In theory only the Sultan could shed blood, so when a criminal was being executed by the order of the Bendahara, the creese of execution (klris penyalang) was driven into his heart through a pad of cotton wool in order that no blood should drop on the ground, and due regard was thus paid to the constitutional theory ! After the Dutch had expelled the Bugis from Riau. in 1784, that island has been occupied by Engku Muda who styled himself \\\" Sultan of Riau.\\\" When the English removed the ban on the Bugis, Raja Ali captured the place. Engku Muda retorted by blockading Riau in May 1801. 'Abdul'l-Majid who was summoned from Pahang to effect a settlement could, at first, do nothing. In February 1802, he persuaded the warring Chiefs to go to Lingga where Sultan Mahmud made peace between the Malays and Bugis. In December 1804 Mahmud settled Raja Ali at Penyengat as Yam Tuan Muda. Bendahara 'Abdu'l-Majid had four sons, Tun 'Abdu'l Mutalib who resided at Pekan Sebrang, Tun Muhammad (\\\" Engku Sentul\\\") who lived at Chenor, Tun Koris who resided with his Bugis mother at Endau, and Deh (Da) whose home was at Pedah. On one occasion when the Bendahara's eldest son was on a visit to Riau the Sultan showed especial favour to 'Abdul'-Mutalib by inviting him to be his guest at table. The custom was that the son of the Bendahara to whom the Sultan paid that honour was tacitly recognized as Bendahara designate (Bendahara Muda). In the same way, a Temenggong's son so honoured was recognized as successor to his father. 'Abdu'l-Mutalib's uncle, Temenggong 'Abdu'l-Jamal, whose two sons were present but had received no such invitation, became jealous of his nephew and brooded over the slight. Some time afterwards, while the Sultan, accompanied by the Temenggong, was on a visit to Pahang 'Abdu'l-Jamal, one night, stole to the Bendahara's house, concealed himself behind a door, and as his nephew was passing, stabbed him to death. As 'Abdu'l-Mutalib lay dying, he gasped: \\\"Uncle, what wrong have I done you ! \\\" The murderer fled to Padang Buloh (Pekan Lama). A search party went in pursuit, captured him, and banded him over to 'Abdu'l-Maj id. The murdered boy's father ordered his men to extract thorns from the captive's feet. Tun Koris arrived and attempted to kill 'Abdu'l-Jamal but was restrained by his father : \\\" He is your uncle, and he is mad ! \\\" The Sultan ordered the murderer to be sent back to Riau. 'Abdu'l-Jamal was accordingly put on board a boat which set sail for Riau. As he passed the mouth of the Blackwater (Kuala 1936] Royal Asiatic Society. 54 W. Linehan. Ayer Hitam) he cast the fatal spear with which he had killed his nephew into the Pahang river. When the boat arrived near Kuala Rompin, Bernas, one of' Abdu'l-Jamal's concubines, was put ashore as her confinement was near, and the place where she gave birth to a child was called Pantai Bernas. Near Penyusok the demented 'Abdu'l-Jamal pirated a boat (sekochi} at anchor there killing many of its crew. He towed the captured vessel behind his junk (jongkong) to Riau. A topical rhymer celebrated the incident in verse : \\\" Great's the worm in bole of tree, The Dutch boy plays sekopong,1 Great's the king's Prosperity, The barque is towed by jongkong.\\\"2 At Riau the crazy Temenggong solved the difficulties of his position by taking a lighted torch into the hold where the gun- powder was stored. He and his two sons were killed in the explosion which followed. In the meantime, when the news of his brother's murder reached him, Tun Muhammad of Chenor hurried to Pekan with forty spearmen. In his anxiety to get there quickly he cast over- board his cooking stove at Kuala Lepar in order to lighten the boat. At Pekan he found that 'Abdu'l-Jamal had left for Riau. In spite of his father's attempt to restrain him he followed his uncle. On his arrival at Riau he found that the demented 'Abdu'l-Jamal was dead. Tun Muhammad settled at Riau, and when his father 'Abdu'l- Majid died in 1802, the Sultan installed him as Bendahara. The new Chief then set sail for Pahang. While he was crossing from Pulau Tioman to Endau his boat was wrecked in a storm, and he, and one of his wives, trapped in a cabin, perished. He was known posthumously as M arJ11um M angkat di-Lai,t : \\\" the late Chief who died at sea.\\\" Tun Muhammad's ship-mates, to the number of forty, escaped with their lives from the ship-wreck- only to meet a worse fate. When they arrived at Pekan all but two of them were slaughtered by Tun Koris who, on his brother's death, became Bendahara Paduka Raja, because they had not died with their prince. They were stabbed to death with a long creese. Koris' treatment of the ship-wrecked survivors earned him a well-merited reputation for cruelty. The new Bendahara had been reared at Endau by his Bugis mother. He made Tuan Jambul his chief Manteri or executive officer. Hi5 rule was short : he died about 1806 leaving two 1A card-game. â€¢Besar ulat di-buk\\\" kayu, Anak Belanda main sekopong, Besar daulat Raja Melayi,, Sekochi di-t1mda jongkong.

Tun Ali was installed Bendahara of Pahang in 1806 by Sultan Mahmud of Riau-Johore-Pahang, with the title of Bendahara Sewa Raja. He was about twenty-five years of age at the time of his accession. The Malay kingdom was now approaching its dis- memberment. In January 1812 Sultan Mahmud died leaving two sons Tengku Husain and Tengku 'Abdu'l-Rahman. The deceased ruler had married a daughter of Bendahara 'Abdu'l- Majid by Tun Besar, (the \\\" Tuanku Besar\\\" of Begbie), but the union was barren. This childless wife was buried in the royal cemetery at Kuala Pahang. The Bugis Yam Tuan Muda of Riau (Jaafar) supported the claim of 'Abdu'l-Rahman to the Sultanate, and succeeded in having him proclaimed ruler at Mahmud's grave-side. According to one account, Husain acquiesced in his brother's elevation to the throne; but Begbie states that he betook himself to Pahang where he enlisted the support of Benda- hara Ali who, with Husain's step-mother Tengku Puteri Hamidah of Pulau Penyengat (in whose custody was the regalia of the Riau-Johore kingdom), assembled forces to attack 'Abdu'l- Rahman. The Yam Tuan Muda, alarmed at the war-like pre- parations, made a complaint to the Resident of Malacca, and Adrian Koeck was sent to warn the Bendahara that intervention in Lingga would give offence to Great Britain, so Tun Ali took his forces, which had been mobilized at Bulang, back to Pahang. The British, after the restoration of Malacca to the Dutch in 1818, sought a station to off-set their European rivals in the Peninsula. In 1819 Raffles induced Husain to conclude a treaty (to which the Johore Temenggong was also a signatory) ceding Singapore to the English. In return, Raffles installed Husain as Sultan of Johore. According to the Hikayat Johor serla Pahang, Raffles desired to make Temenggong 'Abdu'l-Rahman, Sultan , but this potentate demurred : \\\" I cannot be made ruler because I am only third ; first comes my elder ' brother' in Pahang, second is the Yam Tuan Muda at Riau, and their sovereign is at Daik.\\\" On the Temenggong's suggestion, Tengku Husain was summoned to Singapore and installed Sultan. The Temenggong then wrote to the Bendahara explaining what had happened. Tun Ali replied that he did not propose to take any part in the pro- ceedings, that his allegiane lay to Daik, (Riau), and that, as far as Pahang affairs were concerned, he would ignore Singapore and refer to Daik. Bendahara Ali further wrote a letter to Timmerman Tbyssen, Governor of Malacca, expressing- amazement that the inscrutable creator had parted brother from brother, father from son, and friend from friend, and declaring the cryptic intention of being a friend to the friends of the Raja of Johore. The seal used by the diplomatic Ali described him as the representative Journal Malayan Branch [Vol. XIV, Part II, History of Pahang. 57 of Sultan Mahmud, now deceased, a description that would offend nobody. In the same year (1819), the Bendahara refused to allow the British to hoist the Union Jack in his country, and assured Sultan 'Abdu'l-Rahman of his allegiance, but he was soon to acknowledge Husain. In 1821, 'Abdu'l-Rahman, with his son Tengku Besar Muhammad, visited Pahang whence Bendahara Ali escorted his sovereign to Trengg~?u. Timmerman Thyssen, the Dutch Governor of Malacca, took the regalia of the old Riau-Johore-Pahang kingdom by force from Tengku Puteri Hamidah at Pulau Penyengat in October 1822. Sultan 'Abdu'l-Rahman, after his return from Pahang and Trengganu about the same time was invested with the regalia at Lingga. Raja Indera Bongsu had died in Pahang and this office was vacant. The Bendahara appointed the Yam Tuan Muda to represent him at the Sultan's investiture. On 17 March 1824 the Dutch and the British concluded a treaty whereby it was agreed that Singapore and the Peninsula should be the British sphere of influence, while the Dutch con- fined themselves to the islands south of Singapore. In 1827, an Englishman, Gray, visited Pahang to trade opium for gold-dust. He may have been the first European- he was almost certainly the first Englishman-to penetrate the interior. He chose for his visit the season of the north-east monsoon when the rivers were in flood. He left Malacca on 2 January 1827 for Pahang by the over-land route. Newbold published the diary of Gray's journey : \\\"9 January: Left Jompol with nine men well-armed for Pahang .... After going down-river Jompol for nearly one hour, I was obliged to cross overland with my boat and goods for nearly three hundred yards, to fall in with the river Sirting, which leads to the lake of Brah (Bera) and the river Brah . . ..

In some parts of the river Sirting and river Brah a brig might go up, and in other parts nothing but a small boat, on account of the water being above the fallen trees, so that the boat must be lifted over before it can proceed.

Sultan 'Abdu'l-Rahman died in 1832 and was succeeded ' by his son, the Tengku Besar, who was entitled Sultan Muhammad ' Shah (Marhwm Kadaton). The new ruler visited Pahang, and took Bendahara Ali to Lingga for the circumcision and installation of his son Yam Tuan Besar Mahmud The Hikayat Pahang (MS.) describes the Pahang magnate's visit. He brought a great following, prominent among whom were his two chief warriors Dato' Parit, a Chief of Bukit Sagumpal, and Dato' Tanggok Bingkal Tembaga. On his arrival he went into the Sultan's presence and uttered the sayings prescribed by custom and the law of Islam on such occasions ; and the ruler commanded that Lingga should be temporarily under the Bendahara in accordance with custom. With Tun Ali were present the Yam Tuan Muda, the Temenggong, and other Chiefs. For four months there was feasting, rejoicing and gambling, until finally the Pahang guests dissipated their property and became penniless. To' Tanggok t Bingkal Tembaga, and Dato' Parit went into the presence of their master, and craved permission to recoup their losses by piracy. At first the Bendahara refused, but on the second asking, he gave no reply, and taking his silence as consent, the Chiefs sallied forth on their buccaneering venture. They sailed for seven days and r lAt Gambang. 1936] Royal Asiatic Society. 60 W. Linehan. ' seven nights. One day, as their vessel rocked in the sw~ll, they were attacked by sevenÂ· pirate boat~, and the Pahang Ch1~fs an_d their barque were captured. Dato Tanggok, and Dato Pant were brought on board one of the enemy boats, and chained. A storm arose, the captive Chiefs broke their chains, ~nd o.vercam_e their captors. They regained their_ ves~el, loaded 1t. with spoil from their enemy, and went back m tnumph to Da1k ! That, at least, was the story which they related on their return. The installation of Tengku Besar Mahmud was duly accom- plished. Tun Mutahir, eldest son of Bendahara Ali, was made Engku Muda, and married Tengku Chik the Sultan's daughter. The Pahang potentate and his people then returned to their country. Tun Ali's son-in-law and chief Minister was Saiyid Omar, styled \\\" Engku Saiyid,\\\" whose wife was given the title of Inche Puan Engku Saiyid. Inche Long, popularly known as Inche Lingga, a wife of Bendahara Ali, on 23 May 1836 gave birth to a son Tun Ahmad, (later, Bendahara and Sultan), for whom an Arab, Habib 'Abdu'llah ibni Omar Al-Attas, foretold a great future. Engku Muda went to reside at Pulau Ganchong which place was presented to him by To' Ganchong (a pious Javanese head- man). At that time, in Pahang, were a Mufti and a Chief Kathi, Tuan Haji 'Abdu'l-Shukor, and Tuan Senggang, and many religious teachers of minor degree. Daily they interviewed the raja and expounded to him the precepts of his religion. Peace and prosperity reigned in the country. Twenty gantangs of rice cost only one dollar, and other food-stuffs were equally cheap. Many people became rich, and, the Malay chronicler proceeds, there was a great trade in gold. Pahang, with the exception of the rich tin-producing region of the river Kuantan which was kept as a private reserve by the Bendahara, was free from import or export duties. Ali's son, Tun Buang (Wan Ismail), was made Engku Pengli- ma Besar, (this title, in Pahang, dated at least as far back as the early part of the 17th century). Tun Long (Wan Koris), eldest son of Tun Mutahir, was made Penglima Perang; Tun Aman ~:-Van 'Abdu'l-Rahman, second son ofMutahir) of Kampong Mas- )ld, and Inche Wan Sulaiman, husband of Inche Engku Teh (a daughter of Tun Muhammad the brother of Bendahara Ali), were ranked as Manteri. Sulaiman is mentioned in the Pelayaran A~dullah where he is wrongly described as a son of Bendahara Ah. By Inche Puan, Engku Saiyid had two sons Tuan Embon~, and Tuan Ngah . Tun Ahmad was his father's most dearly beloved son, and a favourite with the people. An_ interesting description of the country in the early part of the eighteenth century is given by 'Abdu'llah in his Pelayaran. In 1838 Abdullah, on his way to Kelantan, landed at Kuala Pahang Journal Malayan Branch [Vol. XIV, Part II, History of Pahang. 61 for provisions. He sailed up the Pahang river to Kampong China (Pekan Baharu). There he found hundreds of Malays and Chinese, armed to the teeth, awaiting him on the bank. After parley with the Chiefs, he was allowed to land. The Bendahara, with the Chinese head-man, was away at the gold mines of Jelai. 'Abdu'llah was informed that the banks of the Pahang river as far as Jelai were inhabited. The country appeared very fertile, but he deplored the lack of shops, markets and roads and expressed amazement at the idleness, ignorance and poverty of the people. The men went armed with numerous weapons which they never laid aside. The houses were made of attap, built without method. Underneath the houses was filth undescribable. Plagues of mosquitoes were kept away by smoke. Many of the inhabitants were addicted to opium. Coconut and areca-nut trees were plentiful. Provisions were dear : eight coconuts cost a dollar. The country produced vegetables, yams, and tubers which came from the interior. The people lived by keeping buffaloes, cattle, goats and fowl. The most important articles of export were gold and tin. Silk weaving existed on a small scale. A certain amount of sandal wood, damar, and rattans was exported. Imports I included opium, silk, salt, and there was a small demand for 'Â· European cloth. Thousands of people were at work in the gold mines at Jelai which place had, in consequence, become an impor- tant trading centre. 'Abdu'llah heard of a considerable number ofJakunaborigines in Ulu Pahang. They dealt in jungle produce, agila wood, resin and rattans. Some Jakun worked in the gold mines with the Malays. Many of them kept orchards, and brought fruits from the jungle which they exchanged for tobacco or salt. The Chinese in Kampong China were of the Kheh race, and intermarried with Malays or Balinese slaves. Their children spoke Chinese rather than Malay. There was a populous Arab settlement in Pahang. The Arabs lived at Kampong Maulana opposite Kampong China, on the left bank of the Pahang river. The Malays stood in awe of them, and addressed them in the same respectful terms that they used towards their rajas. The Arabs were traders and many of them were in affluent circumstances. Abdullah remarked that the language of the people had all the elegance and purity of the Johore tongue. He commented on the pernicious system of slavery. Any criminal could escape the consequences of his crime if the protec- tion of a prince were extended to him. As the price of that protec- tion he lost his liberty and became the bondsman of the prince. Nobody would then dare to harm him: he was a hamba raja. The penalty for killing one of this class was the death of the aggressor and of six of his relatives. Hamba raja, unfettered by any res- traint on their conduct, could commit crimes with impunity.

In their original form tampang were solid slabs of tin, valued at their tin content, and were used as media of exchange in pre-Portuguese Malacca. D'Albuquerque suppressed all Malaycurrencywhenhe conquered Malacca in 1511, but this form of coinage persisted in some of the out-lying Malay States, particularly Pahang and Selangor. At the beginning of the nineteenth century the solid tin slabs began to be replaced by hollowed, inscribed pieces, still approximating in appearance to the original tampang, though their intrinsic value bore little rela- tion to their nominal worth. 'Abdu'llah, on his visit in 1838, objected to this form of coinage as the unit of value was too high : \\\"The system of currency in Pahang is, to my mind, inconvenient. Sixteen tampang are equivalent to one dollar. A tampang cannot be divided, for instance, into three-quarters, or a half, or a quarter. If it is desired to buy anything, however trifling, a tampang must be paid for it. I asked Tengku Sulaiman, the son of the Benda- hara, whether the system of currency could not be altered. He laughed and said ' I often wished to change it but man-eating tigers made their appearance and fierce crocodiles were seen in the rivers, and for that reason no change was made : from its very beginnings Pahang has had the same system of currency.' I smiled and said nothing, but attached no belief to the alleged portents.\\\" By 1847, ingot-money of the nominal value of one cent was being produced. Bendahara Ahmad, after his conquest of Pahang in 1863, called in some of the one-cent tampang, and had them re-minted and issued in the form of smaller, more debased and more imperfectly made pieces. In 1889, the Pahang Govern- ment proclaimed that ingot-money issued by the Sultan before 1 July 1889 should be accepted as legal tender, but intimated that no further issues would be made. The coins ceased to be legal tender in 1893 by which time the Pahang Treasury held tampang of the nominal value of $1,125/-. The Treasurer in his report mentioned that. they were of three sizes, the nominal value of the largest being four cents, and of the two smaller sizes one cent. An assay made about the same time by the Assayer of the Pahang Corporation revealed that the coins contained 86.75% of tin with a trace of zinc and iron, and 13.25% of scale (oxide of tin). 2 The monopoly of minting ingot-money was granted to Chinese who were permitted to mint only four times a year, and up to a 'Tavares, the Portuguese chronicler, wrote in 1718: \\\" There is in Gior a ce:tain typ~ of Malay called Bugis who being Royal captives \\\"-bamba raia-\\\" are msolent and oppress the people, robbing, wounding, and killing, and as they are surrounded by the shadow of the king no one dares to incur harm by resisting them.\\\" '\\\" Notes on Tampang\\\" (J.M.

During Ahmad's rule, the Imam Perang Indera Mahkota, and the Orang Kaya Bakti (an Indian) had the custody of moulds for tampang struck directly on behalf of the Bendahara. Che DoIJah supervised the minting at Lepar. Che Lambak of Benta, and Hassan, Penglima Perang Johan Perkasa, were in charge of the issues at Kuantan. Some details, additional to those given by Abdullah, are afforded by tradition regarding the execution of criminals in the time of the Bendaharas. Capital offences included treason, murder, amok (amuck), arson, and adultery on the part of a woman. The criminal was arrested by the Bendahara's police (juak-juak, budak raja, or hamba raja) who usually went armed with a short creese and a spear (keris pendek dan tombak sa-batang). He was then brought before the Bendahara, and, if convicted, lodged in a primitive gaol pending his execution. The old Malay prison was situated behind the present Estana Pantai at Pekan Lama. It measured about twenty-four by forty feet, and was provided with small barred windows. Prisoners had one foot enclosed in wooden stocks (pasong) which were designed to hold ~ . five people at a time. There was little attempt at sanitation though the Chinese gaoler cleaned the prison once a day. The head-man of the Chinese (Capitan China) was paid by the Raja to provide food. Every morning the prisoners were given small knives, and if they were adept, made bamboo flutes, and musical instruments shaped like a bird, which they sold to passers-by for a few cents. A prisoner sentenced to death was chained. There were different methods of execution. The most common way was death by the creese. For three days prior to the carrying out of the sentence the executioner (perlanda) paraded the to,vn, beating a drum and proclaiming the prisoner's fate. On the day of execution the condemned man was taken to Pulau Limin, a small island in the Pahang river opposite Pekan Baharu, .. (which has now disappeared). A chain called by the grimly humourous name \\\"the sun-shower chain,\\\" (rantai lmjan panas), was placed around his neck, his hands were bound, and he was stabbed with the long execution creese provided by the Bendahara -the famous keris penyalang of Koris (now a part of the Pahang State regalia). The executioner then made a tour of the to\\\\'111 and received three tampang from each shop for the expense of burying the corpse. Death by the creese was one of the most humane forms of execution. An amok (a person who ran amuck) was treated as a wild beast ; he could lawfully be killed by anybody. His fate was di-tikam tandang: to be stabbed by the hurling of javelins. A woman convicted of adultery was strangled (di-kuji1,t). One of the wives of Bendahara Ali met this fate (she was buried at Kuala Ayer Itam). A person convicted of a crime involving a heinous 1936] Royal Asiatic Society. 64 W. Linehan. I betrayal of trust was crucified (di-palong), and the body thrown into the sea. Another form of execution was to despatch an offender by weighting his body with a stone, and consigning him to the river (benum). A variation of this method was to enclose the nape of the criminal's neck in the cleft of a forked branch and tow him in the wake of a boat till he was drowned (chabang). Another form of torture was to impale the victim on a bamboo stick (sula). The murderer of a member o~ the royal f<1:mily was extirpated root and branch; he and all his near relatives were sought out and killed. Bendahara Sewa Raja Ali, in appearance a short, dark thick-set man, (whom his grand-son Sultan Mahmud was said to have closely resembled), was of a kindly disposition, and popular with his subjects. He enjoyed the advantage, inestimable in old Malay States, of having no surviving uncles, and only one brother, Muhammad (with whom he lived on friendly terms), and so had no intrigues to counter. He maintained amicable relations with the Straits Government, and availed himself of the trade facilities with Singapore. He exterminated a Bugis piratical settlement, founded by Wok Temusai, which had become established at Keratong in the river Rompin. He was the senior potentate of the old Pahang-Riau-Johore kingdom. He had taken a major part in the installation of the Sultan, but there were no longer any practical calls upon the ancient loyalty as the Anglo-Dutch treaty, and the creation of separate Sultans of Singapore and of Riau had, in effect, dismembered the Malay kingdom. Unendan- gered by potential rivals, he was in a position effectively to control his Chiefs over whom he ruled in the name of the Sultan, and as the sovereign's fully-accredited representative (wakil mutallak). Ali's major Chiefs were the Orang Kaya Indera Maharaja Perba of Jelai, the Orang Kaya Indera Segara of Temerloh, the Orang Kaya lndera Pahlawan of Chenor, and the Orang Kaya Indera Shahbandar. An account of these magnates and of the lesser Chiefs is given elsewhere in this history. 1 The Shahbandar, living near Pekan, tended to become one of the Bendahara's ministers. Ali's chief executive officer was his son-in-law Saiyid Omar (Engku Saiyid), later (in 1861) to be described by Governor Cavenagh as \\\"a very astute old gentleman.\\\" On 13 September 1841 the Governor wrote to the Bendahara tl:at \\\"Tengku Ali eldest son of the late Sultan of Johore arrived at Smgapore yeste~day desirous of being installed by my friend. I beg that my fnend will do what is proper on this occasion.\\\" 2 In 1844 Bendahara Ali appointed one Talib as head-man (Jena'!7'g) of the aboriginal tribes (51,ku Biduanda) in the region of the nver Anak Endau.

Long before his death he had retired from active participation in the government of the country, and removed ~is res.id_ence to L_ami on the river Pahang Tua where he spent his declmmg years m a vain endeavour to effect a reconciliation between his turbulent sons. On his retirement he had handed over the government to his eldest son Wan Mutahir. The heir took up his residence at Ganchong, hence the origin of the name Bendahara Ganchong by which he came to be known. On 25 May 1856 the old Bendahara had made a will whereby he left the revenues of the Kuantan and Endau Districts to his favourite son Tun Ahmad. Mutahir subsequently professed ignorance of this clause in the will, and failed to give effect to it. Ahmad claimed that his father had given him Kuantan and Endau to rule, so dividing the government of Pahang between himself and his brother. Mutahir failed to appear at his father's death-bed to receive the last solemn injunctions which, according to custom, a dying ruler laid upon his heir. The old Bendahara's wishes, in the absence of Mutahir, were communicated to Ahmad who was thus provided with a pretext for attacking the validity of his brother's succession, and claiming that he was the rightful successor to his father. At the funeral the two brothers appeared with bands of followers fully armed, but owing to the influence of the older Chiefs the obsequies were carried out without blood-shed. The dead ruler was buried in the royal cemetery at Kuala Pahang. Io sooner was their father in his grave than Ahmad proceeded to Singapore to make preparations for an attack upon Mutahir who had assumed the title of Bendahara Seri Maharaja. In July 1857 Temenggong Ibrahim of Johore asked the Governor to pre- vent Ahmad from fitting armed vessels at Pulau Tekong for an attack on Pahang. To understand the political alignments during the civil war, it is necessary to gain an idea of the Malayan politics of the day. By the Anglo-Dutch treaty of 1824. the Dutch and British spheres of influence were defined, the Dutch agreeing not to interfere in the Malay Peninsula, or in Singapore, while Great Britain undertook to refrain from intervention in the Kerimun Islands, Batam, Bintang (Riau), Lingga or other islands lying south of Singapore. This division, in effect, dismembered the old Pahang-Riau- Johore kingdom, and parted politically the representatives of the royal family : Sultan Husain of Singapore, and Sultan 'Abdu'l- Rahman of Lingga, sons of Sultan Mahmud Shah. The Benda- haras of Pahang, up to 1853, ruled nominally as vice-regents of the Sultans. In that year, it appeared, Bendahara Ali had declared Journal Malayan Branch [Vol. XIV, Part II, JOURNAL MALAYAN BRANCH, ROYAL ASIATIC Soc., VOL. XIV. 1936, PLATE II. â€¢ His Highness Sultan Ahmad al-Mtt'azam Shah ibni Bendahara, Ali. History of Pahang. 67 himself an independent ruler, but the fiction of the suzerainty of the old royal family continued in Pahang until 1864. In 1857, Sultan Mahmud Muzaffar Shah of Lingga, deposed by the Dutch, began intriguing to get himself recognised as Sultan of Pahang. He sounded the Bendahara, but meeting with no encouragement in that quarter, attached himself to Ahmad's side in furtherance of his own ends. The possession of Pahang by the ex-Sultan of Lingga, the head of the old Johore royal family, would have spelt danger to the Temenggong's rule in Johore: hence one of the reasons for Ibrahim's opposition to Ahmad. The other factors determining the Temenggong's attitude were that Mutahir had the best claim to the Bendahara- ship, and that he himself had visions of creating a Johore-Pahang State: Mutahir was no longer young, and his opium-smoking sons were of little account ; it would not be difficult to dominate them. To add to the political complications, Siam aspired to revive its ancient suzerainty over Pahang, and covertly supported the pretensions of the ex-Sultan of Lingga. Trengganu, too, was brought in as a pawn in the game; at one time it was suspected that there was a move instigated by Siam to make the deposed ruler of Lingga, Sultan of Trengganu, but it is hard to understand the existing Sultan's attitude if that were so; it was unlikely that he would support his own political extinction. Yet he harboured the ex-ruler of Lingga in face of the British Government's threats of attack, and supported Ahmad with men and arms. The posi- tion, then, briefly was that Siam quietly encouraged the ex-Sultan of Lingga who, with the Sultan of Trengganu, supported Ahmad. Bendahara l\\\\Iutahir was helped by the Temenggong of Johore. The British Government opposed the Siamese pretensions, and, for fear of offending the Dutch, countered the intrigues of the ex-Sultan of Lingga; it tried to prevent the interruption of the growing British trade with Pahang. Until the year 1862, when the Governor-General in Council approved of the Johore-Pahang treaty, it \\\" kept the ring\\\" between Mutahir and his brother, to the Temenggong's disgust. Ahmad played his cards well, and had all the honours of the game. He utilized the Siamese, the Sultan of Trengganu , and the deposed Sultan of Lingga to defeat his brother, and when he had succeeded, promptly made his peace with the British. When Ahmad was in Singapore, in July 1857, preparing for an invasion of Pahang, conflicts between his followers and those of the Temenggong were narrowly averted, and both parties went around with arms concealed on their person . After completing his preparations in Singapore, Ahmad then proceeded to Kema man in Trengganu where he recruited men for his venture. The Sultan of Trengganu gave Ahmad his full support even to the extent of issuing orders to the Kemaman Chiefs, under threat of punishment, to give every assistance to the Bendahara's enemy 1936] Royal Asiatic Society. 68 W. Linehan. In October 1857 the Bendahara received a letter purporting to come from Trengganu in which the ruler of that Stat~ ~enounce_d Ahmad's hostile intent against Pahang. The authenticity of this letter was doubtful, but it had the effect of putting the Bendahara and his supporters off their guard ; they had heard no news of the recent events at Kemaman. Confident of the security of the country, Mutahir sent his eldest son Engku Muda Koris (Wan Long) to Singapore for his marriage to Inche Engku Besar, daughter of Temenggong Ibrahim. The marriage took place in November 1857. Koris was accompanied by two of his brothers, Wan 'Abdu'l-Rahman (Wan Aman) and Wan Da, and their followers. Pahang was thus unprepared for the attack which Ahmad laun- ched by sea from Kemaman in November. The invasion was known to Pahang tradition as the \\\" War of the Kemaman Men.\\\" The Chiefs in charge of Ahmad's forces were Inche Koming Imam Perang Raja, Inche Endut Penglima Raja, Inche Talib Penglima Laut, Hitam Pengasoh Penglima Dalam, Penglima Kakap Bahman (afterwards the Orang Kaya Pahlawan of Seman tan), Penglima Tunggal, Pcnglima Hitam and Penglima Muda. The Kemaman contingent accom- panying the expedition were led by Saiyid ldrus, Raja Muda, Wan Dagang and others. The north-east monsoon had set in, but the invading boats arrived safely at Kuala Pahang. The invaders proceeded up- river to Kampong Marhum where they were joined by the local head-men. They then captured Pulau Jawa where they threw up a stockade and mounted guns. Engku Saiyid, brother-in-law of Bendahara Mutahir, and his son Tuan Embong (or Embok) who were in charge of the District between Pekan and the sea hastily threw up earth-works above Pulau Jawa to defend Pekan, and sent an urgent message for help to the Bendahara at Ganchong. Mutahir began to fortify the latter place and, the Hikayat Pahang records, produced boatfuls of warriors' clothes for his men to don preparatory to their meeting the enemy. The clothes did not appear to inspire them with much courage for the only Chief to come even within sight of cannon-smoke was Dato' Mata-mata. Engku Penglima Besar, (Ismail, a brother of Mutahir), Maharaja Perba Wan Idris, Tengku Ismail, and Tengku Uda ensconced themselves in a stockade above Pulau Keladi, and make no effort to help Engku Saiyid. The invading force crossed the river to Ketapang and burnt that village. After fighting which lasted five days Ahmad took Kampong China (Pekan Baharu). Engku Saiyid with his son and seven followers abandoned their stockade. and fled to Sungai Miang from which place they made their way over-land to Singapore. Th_e Kemaman followers of Ahmad spent seven precious days m lootmg Pekan, and loaded themselves with spoil. Ahmad Journal Malayan Branch [Vol. XIV, Part II, History of Pahang. 69 then proceeded up-river to attack Ganchong, the Bendahara's head-quarters. Mutahir fled incontinently at his brother's approach, and Ganchong was taken without resistance. Engku Penglima Besar and the Chiefs with him had in the meantime abandoned their fort above Pulau Keladi, and made their way through the jungle to the Bendahara who, after three days, poling night and day, reached Chenor with his following. Muta- hir was anxious to enter the Bera and place a still greater distance between himself and his pursuers, but he was induced to make a stand at Chenor. So much spoil wa.s obtained at Ganchong by the Kemaman men that they could not carry off any more. Ahmad now returned to Pekan to strengthen the defences there; while Wan Dagang of Kemaman, Che Lambak of Benta, and Saiyid Idrus with four hundred men proceeded to Kuala Luit where they halted to deliberate with Che WanChik bin Muhammad1 . Haji Hassan and other legitimist Chiefs soon arrived, suggested negotiations for peace, and begged the invaders not to press the pursuit too hard \\\" as the royal women in our party are very frightened ! \\\" The contending leaders were brothers, and every effort should be made to put an end to this fratricidal strife. \\\"An excellent idea ! \\\" (ini kira-kira yang sa-habis baik dunia akhirat) replied Che Lambak and his comrades. Haji Hassan then undertook that the Ben- dahara's forces would not take the offensive, and on his suggestion Che Lambak proceeded down the river to carry peace proposals to Ahmad. But neither side believed the other. No sooner had Haji Hassan left Kuala Luit than he conscripted all the inhabit- ants of the villages from that place to Ulu Pahang, and threw up stockades on the river-banks as far as Batu Gajah. At this stage Wan Embong and Wan Muhammad, the sons of Wan Idris, Maharaja Perba of Jelai, arrived with their men to assist the Bendahara. Wan Embong, also known as Wan Bong or Che Aki, was a typical Malay swash-buckler of the old days. A picture of him is given in Sir Hugh Clifford's \\\" Vaulting Ambi- tion \\\" : 2 \\\"The eldest, the most arrogant, the most warlike, the most ambitious and the most evil of these \\\"-the Maharaja Perba's sons-\\\" was Wan Bong .... He was a man of about thirty-five years of age, of a handsome presence and an aristocratic bearing. He wore his fine black hair long, so that it hung about his waist, and he dressed with the profusion of coloured silks, and went armed with the priceless weapons, that are only to be seen in perfection on the person of a Malay prince.\\\" The Hikayat Pahang describes his arrival at Chenor: \\\"After six days Wan Embong and Wan Muhammad, with their forces, arrived from the 'Muhammad, the ' Engku Tanjong' of Abdullah's Pelayara11, was the brother of Bendahara Ali. t\\\" In Court and I(ampong,\\\" by Sir Hugh Clifford. r 1936] Royal Asiatic Society. 70 W.

The Jelai contingent consisted of the two brothers, with forty spearmen all of the same age. Wan Embong was armed with five weapons, a long creese, a short creese, a broad-sword, a lawi ayani, 1 as it was called, stuck in his head-dress, and a dirk. He forthwith presented himself to the Raja. The Bendahara's retinue included Engku Penglima Besar, Maharaja Perba of Jelai the father of Wan Embong, Haji Hassan, and To'Tunggal of Bukit Sa-gumpal. Now Engku Penglima Besar and \\\\Van Embong were enemies, and were always at logger-heads. Wan Embongand Wan Muhammad made obeisance. After greetings, the Raja said ' I have been defeated and compelled to retire to Chenor.' Wan Embong exclaimed: 'It couldn't be helped because I was not here. Your Highness' followers are all women ! Shame that the Raia should be dethroned, without even one of his warriors losing his life ! If I had been there red blood would have flowed and Ganchong would not have been taken ! I will go down-stream at once and attack Pekan. My father will remain here with Your Highness; I can abide no longer for I have smelt blood ! ' The Raja replied: ' Not so, Wan Embong; I ask you to have patience till my sons return from the Straits ; they will not be long now.' Wan Embong retorted ' I will obey Your Highness ' command-but only for seven days. If they have not returned by then I will go down-stream.' On hearing these words, Engku Penglima Besar's face grew grim. Haji Hassan, To'Raja and To'Tunggal kept silence. Wan Embong took his leave of the Raja, and proceeded to an open plain where he danced a war-dance in the Bugis fashion to give vent to his feelings.\\\" On the night of Wan Embong's advent, Engku Muda Koris, Wan Aman and Wan Da arrived from Sngapore by the overland route through the Bera, and their father handed over to the three brothers the entire conduct of the war. Titles were conferred on many of the Chiefs: Wan Embong was styled Penglima Perang Kiri; Wan Muhammad, Dato' Setia Muda of Jelai; Tengku Acheh, Imam Perang; Che Buman (son of To'Tunggal), Penglima Perang Kanan; Ghe Buman's brother, Penglima Bebas. One Bajin, \\\" a great braggart,\\\" and other Chiefs were not forgotten in this wholesale distribution of honours ; Haji Hassan was created Imam Perang Hulubalang.

At this period Mutahir had on his side almost all the powerful Chiefs of Pahang. Ahmad in the meantime was not idle. He collected ammuni- tion, strengthened his forts, and prepared a plan of campaign with his Chiefs Saiyid Idrus and others. Several of his captains dis- played little enthusiasm for this war against their own people. When preparations were completed, Ahmad proceeded up the river Pahang, and met the Bendahara's forces at Pulau Manis. After an engagement which lasted a day, he was defeated, and forced to retire on Ganchong, and then on Tanjong Langgar. There he constructed stockades on both banks of the river. Fighting conlinued in this locality for about four months. A sm prise attack by a detachment of Bendahara's men under Sutan Garang on a fort garrisoned by Ahmad's Kemaman followers, its capture, and the slaughter of its garrison made Ahmad's posi- tion untenable, so he took boat and with the survivors of his force returned to Kemaman. Much spoil was brought back, but a goodly number of Kemaman men had been killed. Ahmad was not over-pleased at the achievements of his Trengganu following: if they had not been so intent on looting they would have beaten the enemy ; but he was not discouraged by the failure of his first attempt, and began making preparations for a fresh invasion of Pahang. According to the Hikayat Pahang, Engku Muda Koris and his Chiefs were so exultant at their victory, so over-bearing, and arrogant that they \\\"forgot their God.\\\" No sooner had the enemy been expelled than quarrels broke out among his captains. The turbulent Wan Embong (Penglima Perang Kiri) took the credit of the victory to himself; the Orang Kaya of Temerloh disputed his pretensions. Blood-shed was averted only by the intervention of Koris. In February 1858 Temenggong Ibrahim had written to the Governor complaining of the \\\" unfriendly sentiments\\\" which the Governor had shown towards him : the Temenggong was prevented from sending help to the Bendahara, while Ahmad was allowed to use Singapore as a base for his attack on Pahang. Ibrahim declared his intention to assist the Bendahara with a force from Johore, but the Governor forbade interference. Thr Temenggong retorted that the Bendahara represented a country at peace with Great Britain, and that Ahmad was attacking that country : the paramount power should maintain order in the Peninsula. Abu-Bakar, the Temenggong's son, married Che Engku Chik, a sister of Koris. The Bendahara's eldest son had in 1857 married Abu-Bakar's sister. These marriages, which had a political significance, strengthened the Bendahara's position, while he, in return for a promise of assistance, ceded to Johore 1936] Royal Asiatic Society. 72 W.

On 2 May 1858 the Governor refused the Bendahara's request for arms, and later in the month visited Pahang and Trengganu. On 17 May, during his stay at Kuala Trengganu, His Excellency extracted a promise from the Sultan that Ahmad should be removed from Kemaman. In pursuance of his promise the Trengganu ruler ordered Ahmad to leave Kemaman and reside at Kuala Trengganu. Ahmad complied, but no sooner had the Governor left for Singapore, than he returned and renewed his warlike preparations. In June 1858 the Temenggong sent his son Abu-Bakar to Pahang to watch events there, but by a blunder of the Resident Councillor of Singapore, Abu-Bakar was arrested at Kuala Sedili as a pirate for taking spears out of a Pahang boat. He ultimately succeeded in reaching Pahang. There he found Mahmud Muzaffar Shah, ex-Sultan of Lingga, with his family and retainers. Abu-Bakar wedd"
