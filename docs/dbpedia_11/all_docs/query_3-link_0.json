        "text": "An 84-year-old Malaysian state sultan has ascended the throne to become the oldest constitutional monarch in the country's history.\n\nAbdul Halim Mu'adzam Shah took his oath of office in a nationally televised ceremony attended by hundreds of dignitaries in Malaysia's new federal palace.\n\nUnder a unique system maintained since Malaysia's independence from Britain in 1957, nine hereditary state rulers take turns as the country's king for five-year terms.\n\nThe monarch's role is largely ceremonial, since administrative power is vested in the prime minister and parliament. But the position is highly regarded, particularly among the ethnic Malay Muslim majority, as the supreme upholder of Malay tradition and symbolic head of Islam.\n\n\"The king is the umbrella to the people and the people are the pillars of the king,\" Sultan Abdul Halim said in comments issued through the national news agency, Bernama. \"The king's greatest role is to ensure there will be no cruelty and destruction to the people and to the country.\"\n\nWearing black and yellow regalia, the king was sworn in after inspecting a military honour guard and receiving a 21-gun salute at parliament.\n\nHis roles include appointing cabinet ministers and senior judges on the advice of the prime minister. He also appoints top Islamic clerics and is considered the highest ranking figure in the armed forces.\n\nPublic criticism of the king and state sultans is more or less illegal. Under Malaysian sedition laws people who incite \"hatred or contempt\" towards the monarchy can be imprisoned for three years.\n\nAbdul Halim, an avid golfer and sports fan, is the constitutional ruler of Malaysia's northern Kedah state, nicknamed the country's rice bowl because of its vast paddy fields.\n\nBesides being Malaysia's 14th and oldest king, Abdul Halim is the first to ascend the throne twice. He was also king between 1970 and 1975, when the father of Malaysia's current prime minister, Najib Razak, was premier. He succeeds Sultan Mizan Zainal Abidin, 49, who was one of Malaysia's youngest kings.\n\nThe new king is in robust health for his age. In 2006 he walked more than a mile to a stadium to watch his state's football team in a tournament because his car was caught in traffic.\n\nAbdul Halim, who was installed as ruler of his state in 1958, has been described by his family as a caring leader and a fan of Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin and Nat King Cole.\n\nMalaysian media noted that when Abdul Halim became king in 1970 he had to travel by train from Kedah to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia's largest city.\n\nOn Tuesday he took a flight and was bid farewell by an estimated 30,000 people who thronged the roads to Kedah's airport."
