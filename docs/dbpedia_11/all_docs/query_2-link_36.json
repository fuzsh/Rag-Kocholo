        "text": "Bahram Shah was the son of Ghaznavid sultan Mas‘ud III (d. 1115/508 AH) and succeeded to the throne in 1117/511 AH reigning until 1152-1153/547 AH. After Mas‘ud’s death, there was a struggle for succession amongst his sons, where Shirzad (d. 1116/510 AH) and then Malik Arsalan (d. 1118/512 AH) ruled briefly [1]. Bahram Shah had to seek the help of the Seljuks in order to over-power his brother Arsalan [2].\n\nBahram Shah, during his whole reign, remained a vassal of the Seljuks, particularly their sultan Ahmed Sanjar (d. 1157/552 AH), except one instance of refractory behavior in 1135; this dependence is reflected in the coins of his era [3]. His reign was particularly notable for a flowering and growth of Persian literature with the outpouring of lyric poetry and epic [4]. Perhaps the most notable figure of his court was Abu l-Ma‘ālī Nasrullah who composed the Persian prose version of the collection of animal fables, The fables of Bidpai, that had been translated into Arabic as Kalīla wa-Dimna by Ibn al-Muqaffa‘ from a Middle Persian version of the Indian original [5].\n\nIn terms of architecture, Bahram Shah is known for one of the most famous minarets in Ghazni, the Manar-i Bahram Shah, which has inscription on it stating its patron’s name.\n\nNotes:\n\n1.
