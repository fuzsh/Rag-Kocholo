        "text": "MEDIEVAL Bengal (1204-1757)\n\nWe know that Bakhtiar Khilji defeated Laksmansena in 1204.\n\nNawab Sirajuddowla was defeated by the English in 1757 AD.\n\n Major sources of History:\n\n Tabaqat-i-Nasiri a medieval text by Minhaj-i-Siraj. It is an important source book for the reconstruction of the history of foundation of Muslim rule in Bengal. The history of the first fifty years of Muslim rule in Bengal is found only in this text.\n\n Riyaz-us-Salatin the first complete history of the Muslim rule in Bengal. Written in Persian language by Ghulam Husain Salim Zaidpuri, it covers the whole Muslim rule in Bengal from bakhtiyar’s conquest of Nadia in 1204-05 AD to the battle of palashi in 1757, though there are lacunae(gaps) in various places.\n\n tarikh-i-firuzshahis of Ziauddin Barani\n\n Abul Fazl’s ain-i-akbari and akbarnamah\n\n Badauni’s muntakhab-ut-tawarikh\n\n Nizamuddin Bakhshi’s tabaqat-i-akbari\n\nWe divided THE Medieval Bengal into Three phases:\n\n(a)Delhi Sultanate (1204-1342):\n\nThe Delhi Sultanate was a Muslim kingdom based mostly in Delhi that stretched over large parts of the Indian subcontinent for 320 years (1206–1526).Five dynasties ruled over Delhi Sultanate sequentially, the first four of which were of Turkic origin: the Mamluk dynasty (1206–90); the Khilji dynasty (1290–1320); the Tughlaq dynasty (1320–1414) the Sayyid dynasty (1414–51); and the Afghan Lodi dynasty (1451–1526).\n\nQutb-ud-din Aibak, a former slave of Muhammad Ghori, was the first sultan of Delhi and his dynasty conquered large areas of northern India. Afterwards the Khilji dynasty was also able to conquer most of central India, but both failed to unite the Indian subcontinent. This sultanate also is noted for being one of the few states to repel an attack from the Mongol Empire, and enthroned one of the few female rulers in Islamic history, Razia Sultana from 1236 to 1240.[11]\n\nThe Delhi Sultanate reached its peak in terms of geographical reach, during the Tughlaq dynasty, covering most of Indian subcontinent. The sultanate declined thereafter, with continuing Hindu-\n\nMuslim wars, and states such as Vijayanagara Empire asserting their independence as well as new Muslim sultanates such as Bengal Sultanate breaking off.\n\nThe Delhi Sultanate caused destruction and desecration of politically important temples of enemy states as was the tradition in Pre-Islamic India,] as well as led to the emergence of Indo- Islamic architecture. In 1526, it fell and was replaced by the Mughal Empire.\n\n (b) Independent Sultanate (1342-1538):\n\n Rule of the independent sultans in Bangal:\n\n Fakhruddin:\n\nFakhruddin was an independent Sultan of Sonargaon, Bengal experienced a period when independent Sultans ruled for nearly two centuries. During this time, significant developments took place in the art and culture of Bengal.\n\nFakhruddin had established himself as independent Sultan of Sonargaon and after his death in 1349 was succeeded by his son, Gazi Shah. However, more significant events were happening in Lakhnauti, where an army commander, Ali Mubrak, seized control and established an independent kingdom.\n\nIn 1342 he was overthrown and killed by his foster brother.\n\nHaji Iliyas, who established the Iliyas Shahi Dynasty which ruled Bengal for the next hundred years.\n\nThe Ilyas Shahi Dynasty\n\nThe King of Bengal\n\nHaji Ilyas, the founder of the Ilyas Shahi Dynasty, took control of Lakhnauti in 1342 and assumed the long title of Sultan Shamsuddin abul Muzaffar Iliyas Shah.\n\nSome historians think that Iliyas was the first ruler who brought the three major geographical units of Satgaon, Sonargaon and Lakhnauti under a single authority. It is probably because of this that he called himself Shah-i-Bangala or the king of Bengal.\n\nHaji Iliyas’s rise as an independent ruler in Bengal Offended the Sultan in Delhi. Sultan Firuz Tughluq invaded Bengal with an enormous army n 1353. Though Firuz had some temporary success, he could not crush Haji Iliyas who continued to rule freely.\n\nHowever, after Ibrahimn Sarki left Bengal, Ganesh reassumed power and reconverted his son to Hiduism. Only after Ganesh’s death in 1418 did Jalaluddin return to Islam.\n\nBengali and Persian court languages\n\nDuring Jalaluddin’s reign, Bengali became a court language alongside Persian. A New era of patronization of Bengali language and culture started and this process received momentum in the era of Hussian shahi Dynasty that followed.\n\nThe return of the Iliyas Shahi Dynasty\n\nJalaluddin’s son, Shamshuddin ahmad Shah, has been described by some historiean as a just ruler and by others oppressive. He was murdered by his slave, Nasir Khan, who ascended the throne. This made the nobles outraged and they killed him and restored the Iliyas Shahi Dynasty by installing Nasiruddin Mahmood Shah, grandson of Haji Iliyas (1442 AD).\n\nHe ruled for seventeen years (1433-1459), and during his reign the boundary of Bengal was greatly extended.\n\nNasiruddin was succeeded by his son, Rukhunuddin barbak Shah(1459-1574). Tuknuddin had brought a large number of slaves of Ethiopian origin who became politically powerful over the time. Soon after Ruknuddin’s death, the activities of some of these Slaves created political instability. Between 1487 and 1493, four of the slaves became Sultans and were killed by rivals.\n\nA period of unrest was finally brought to an end when a noble of Arab origin named said Hussain assumed power (1494) and entitiled himself as Aluddin Hussian Shah. Thus the Hussain Shahi Dynasty was established.\n\nArt and culture during the Iliyas Shahi Dynasty\n\nWith the establishment of Iliyas Shahi Dynasty, the initial unrest and political instability were brought to a minimum. Therefore the Sultans could pay more attention to the development of art and culture.\n\nIn the field of architecture, the most spectacular achievement was the famous Adina Mosque in Pandua, built by Sikandar Shah in 1375. The mosque was not only larger than the largest mosque of the Delhi Sultans of the time, but it was also the largerst mosque in the whole subcontinent of India.\n\nOther important monuments erected during the Iliyas Shahi period were the tomb of Ghiyasuddin Azam shah at sonargaon, the Kotwali Darwaza, the dakhil Darwaza, the Nim Darwaza, the Tantipara mosque, the Kadamrasul Masjid and the Darasbari Mosque of Gaur, and the Sona Masjid of Pandua.\n\nUnder the patronage of Ghiyasuddin Azam Shah, Shah Muhammad Sagir wrote his famous poem, Yusuf-Zulekha. It broght about a revolution in Bengali Literature, which was greatly\n\nenriched with the addition of the religious stories of Islam and the introduction of the romantic tale as a new theme for Bengali poets. Ghiyasuddin Azam Shah asked Krittivas to write the Ramayana in Bengali.\n\nRuknuddin Barbak Shah extended his patronage to muslim and Hindu scholars alike. During his reign, Zaynuddin composed the Resulbijay and Ibrahim Qayum Faruqi composed the Safarnamah. Ruknuddin Barbak Shah equally extended his patronage to Hindu scholars and poets-during his reign, Raimukuta Brhaspati acquired fame and glory, and Barbak Shah honored Maladhar Basu, the compiler of the Srikrishnavijay, with the title of ‘Gunaraj Khan’.\n\nThe Hussain Shahi Dynasty\n\nExtending the boundaries of Bengal\n\nAlauddin Hussain Shah Extend the boundaries of Bengal by conquering Kamarupa and Kamta, annexing collila and Chittagong to his kingdom and sending expeditioins to Orissa. He also repulsed an attack by Sikander Lodi, the Dultan of Delhi. He gave away some of his powers to his son, Prince Nusrat Shah, who was a skilled administrator.\n\nKeeping Bengal safe from Babur, the founder of the Mughal Empire\n\nAfter the death of Hussain Shah, Nusrat Shah (1519-1532) asended the throne of Bengal. He was an able ruler like his father. Nusrat clevcerly tried to avoid any confrontation with babur, founder of the Mughal Empire, who had appeared in the eastern Indian scene after his victory at Panipath (1526).\n\nNusrat prfessed neutrality and avoided having any connection with the anti-Mughal confederacy that was formed by Mahmud Lodi with Afghan Chiefs. When Babur sent an expedition to Bengal, Nusrat shah concluded a treaty which made Bengal safe.\n\nIndependence of Bengal lost to Sher Shah, Afghan leader\n\nNausrat shah was killed by an Assassin in 1532 and succeeded by Alauddin Feruz Shah and then Ghiasuddin Mahmud. But they could not reverse the trend of decline of the Husain Shahi Dynasty that had started after the death of nusrat Shah.\n\nMeanwhile, the Afghans grew stronger under the leadership so Sher Shah, who posed a great threat to the muhals in Delhi as well as the Sultans of Bengal and when he captured Gaur in 1538, the independent status of Bengal was finally lost.\n\nArt and culture during the Hussain Shahi Dynasty\n\nThe Hussain Shahi Dynasty was marked by a long spell of undisturbed peace, prosperity, communal harmony and the development of Bengali culture and literature. This is why the Hussain Shahi era is considered the golden age of the Bengal sultanate.\n\nThe local elements, which found expression in the architecture of the period, include the curvature of the cornice and the copy of the chauchala. The Hussain Shahi artists copied the terracotta art on stones. In its rich ornamentation, the Hussain Shahi style stands in strong contrast with the rather austere style of the previous phase.\n\n(C ) Mughal rule (1538-1757)\n\nMughal Empire\n\nBabur was the founder of Mughal Empire. He was related to Timur from his father’s side and Chengiz Khan to his mother’s side. His original name was Zahiruddin Muhammad. He defeated ibrahim lodhi in the first Battle of Panipat in 1526 and established Mughal rule in India.\n\nHe defeated Rana Sanga of Mewar in Battle of Khanua in 1527 near Agra. He then assumed the title of ‘Ghazi’. Babur also defeated the Afgans in battle of Gogra in Bihar.\n\nBabur wrote his memoirs in Tuzuk-i-Baburi in Turki language, describing the flora and fauna of India.\n\nHumayun(1530-1540 AD and 1555-56 AD)\n\nHe was the eldest son of Babur and ascended the throne in 1530. He fought two battles against Sher Shah, the afgan leader at Chausa and Kannauj, where he was completely defeated. Humayun then escaped to Iran for next fifteen years.\n\nSur Empire/ Interregenum(1540-1555AD)\n\nThe founder was Sher Shah. He waged wars with Rajputs expanding his empire to include Punjab, Sind, Multan, Bundelkhand. He ruled for five years but organized the administratin in a brillant manner. He began the system of local responsibility for local crimes. Land was measured and tax was collected to about 1/3rd ogf the produce. He built Purana Qila in Delhi. He introduced new coins called as ‘dams’ which remained in circulation til 1835.\n\nSher Shah built roads to strengthen communication, mainly 4 important highways. From Sonargaon to Sind, From Agra to Burhampur, from Jodhpur to Chittor and from Lahore to Multan.\n\nHe also built the Mosoleum at Sasaram, one of the asterpieces of indian Architecture. He also patronized learned men like Malik muhammad Jayasi who rote Padmavar under his reign.\n\nAfter Sher Shah, his successors ruled till Humayun invaded in 1555.\n\nHumayun conquered his lost empire back from Afghans. But he died in six months after falling from stairs of his library.\n\nAkbar(1556-1605 AD)\n\nHe is considered greatest monarchs of India. the Afghans marched on delhi soon after he assumed throne under Hemu. In 2nd Battle of panipat, Hemu was defeated and Mughals won. For initial five years, Bairam Khan consolidated the empire for him.\n\nthe Rajput Policy of Akbar is lauded by many historians. He married the daughter of Raja Bharmal, thus maintining friendly relations with them. Though the Ranas of Mewar remained defiantto Muslim rule. Rana Pratap was defeated by the Mughal army in 1576.\n\nAkbar proclaimed his own religion Din-i-Ilahi, against the bigotry of orthodox Ulemas. However, the new religion did not became popular. He allowed his Hindu wives to worship their own gods. He ordered the construction f ibadat khana(House of Worship) at his capital Fatehpur Sikri. He invited scholars of all religions for consultations.\n\nUnder Akbar, the Land revenue system was established known as Zabi / BAndobast systemThis sytem was further improved by Raja Todarmal. the land revenue was fixed on the average yield of land assessed based on past ten years records. The land was divided into 4 categories: Polaj(every year cultivation), Parauti(cultivated once in 2 years), Chachar(once in 3-4 years), and Banjar( once in 5-6 years).\n\nAurangzeb(1658-1707 AD)\n\nHe assumed the title of Almgir. In first ten years to his rule, he lead many military campaigns. The jats and Satnamis along with Sikhs revolted during his reign. These revolts were a result of his harsh religious policy. He had reintroduced Jaziya and pilgrim tax. He defeated the Shia Sultans of Bijapur, Golconda eliminatng the Kutb Shahi dynasty. This removed the barrier between the Maraths and the mughasl and confrontations began. His deccan policy ruined the treasury of the Mughal empire.\n\nAfter Auragzeb, the Mughal empire began to decline rapidly.\n\nLater Mughals were not very powerful or influential. Still the Mughal empire continued till the 1857 revolt. Under Bahadur Shah II, the mughal empire came to a formal end."
