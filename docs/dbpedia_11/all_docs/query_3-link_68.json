        "text": "The Sultan Haji Omar Ali Saifuddien (SOAS) Bridge opened to the public on March 17, 2020. This bridge spans 26.3 kilometres across Brunei Bay and connects the Temburong district to Bandar Seri Begawan.\n\nThanks to the bridge, those who live in the surrounding areas will be able to reach the nation’s capital in less than thirty minutes.\n\nBefore the bridge opened, people coming from Temburong needed to either take a boat ride across the bay (around 45 minutes) or drive for two hours through Sarawak’s Limbang and four border crossings in order to get to the capital.\n\nThe Second Penang Bridge is a bridge that spans a distance of 24 kilometres (14.9 miles) and connects Penang Island to the Malaysian Peninsula. It is also known as the Second Penang Bridge. It is the 20th century’s most significant civil engineering endeavour in this part of the world.\n\nThe project consists of building a 475-meter cast-in-situ cable-stayed bridge and 55-meter (180-foot) span precast segmental concrete marine viaduct modules (1,558 feet).\n\nThe Second Penang Bridge is vulnerable to the destructive forces of nature, including earthquakes, the possibility of tsunamis, and wind. It is also exposed to an unfriendly sea environment.\n\nDue to the meticulous planning and design that went into this endeavour, it is now considered one of the most successful sea crossing projects in recent history.\n\nGateway Structure Sdn Bhd (GSSB) is pleased to have contributed to the construction of the Second Penang Bridge in terms of PVD and geotextile, including vertical drains and PVD installation.\n\nThe Penang Bridge, which spans 13.5 kilometres (8.4 miles) in Malaysia’s state of Penang, is a toll bridge and controlled-access road. It spans 13.5 kilometres (8.4 miles).\n\nThe bridge extends across the Selatan Strait and links the city of Butterworth on the mainland to the town of Gelugor on the island. The bridge, which was opened for traffic on September 14, 1985, is the first traffic link that connects the peninsula and the island.\n\nThe bridge has a total length of 8.4 kilometres, making it the second-longest bridge in Malaysia and the fifth-longest bridge in Southeast Asia when measured by overall length (5.2 miles).\n\nThe Bhumibol Bridge, which also goes by the name “Industrial Ring Road Bridge,” is a section of the Industrial Ring Road that connects southern Bangkok with Samut Prakan Province. The entire length of the Industrial Ring Road is 13 kilometres.\n\nIt is a royal effort that was initiated by King Bhumibol Adulyadej to reduce the amount of traffic congestion in Bangkok and its surrounding areas, particularly in the industrial sector surrounding Khlong Toei Port in southern Bangkok and Samut Prakan Province.\n\nTwo extraordinary cable-stayed spans of 702 and 582 metres, respectively, are supported by two diamond-shaped pylons that are 173 and 164 metres in height on either side of the bridge. The bridge crosses the Chao Phraya River twice.\n\nAt a free-flowing junction that is suspended 50 metres above the ground, another road rises to connect the two bridges.\n\nThe Bali Mandara Toll Road was not only the first floating toll road in Indonesia, but it was also the first toll road on the island of Bali.\n\nThe highway, which is 12.7 kilometres above sea level and has been dubbed the most beautiful highway in the world, is unique because it is the only toll road that features bike lanes on both sides of the road. It has also been dubbed the longest highway in the world.\n\nThe toll road’s construction started in March 2012 and lasted until May 2013. A few words are all that are necessary to adequately describe the building of a toll road across the ocean.\n\nDue to the fact that the majority of the tolls are hung over the water, not much land should be released.\n\nThe Bali Mandara Toll Road connects Benoa, Ngurah Rai, Tuban, and Nusa Dua.\n\nTo put things into perspective, the length of the San Juanico Bridge is 2.1 kilometres, and it has held the title of longest bridge in the Philippines since 1973.\n\nThe length of the Cebu-Cordova bridge, which is sometimes referred to as the Cebu-Cordova Link Expressway or CCLEX, is 8.9 kilometres, making it significantly longer than the San Juanico Bridge.\n\nThe Cebu Cordova Link Expressway Corporation (CCLEC), a subsidiary of Metro Pacific Tollways (MPTC), granted the contract for this project in 2017.\n\nIt entails the design and construction of a 650-meter cable-stayed bridge as the main structure, with a main span of 390 metres between pylons situated over the entrance to the Port of Cebu.\n\nThe bridge includes a number of viaducts as well as a highway segment that is situated atop an embankment that is 5.2 kilometres in length.\n\nThanlwin Bridge (a.k.a. Mawlamyine), is located in Mon State in Myanmar’s south. It goes through the confluences of three different rivers. The names of the three rivers are the Thanlyin River, the Gyaing River, and the Attayan River.\n\nIt provides both a road and a rail connection between Mawlamyine City and Moke Ta Ma City. As a result of this development, transportation in southern Myanmar has improved, along with the social and economic conditions.\n\nThe overall length of the bridge is 4.1 miles (6.6 kilometres), with the main bridge measuring 1.5 miles (2.4 kilometres) and the length over water at 1.3 miles (2.1 kilometres) (2.1 km). After beginning construction on March 18, 2000, the bridge did not officially open until February 5, 2005.\n\nIt is a railroad bridge that crosses the Irrawaddy River and is located in the town of Pakokku in Myanmar. The bridge, which connects India, Myanmar, and Thailand, is the longest one in Myanmar and is a part of the Trilateral Highway.\n\nThe clearance area on this massive crested bridge measures 262 feet in width and 52 feet in height.\n\nThe Pakokku Bridge, which is located close to Bagan and spans the Ayeyarwady (Irrawaddy) River, is the longest bridge in all of Myanmar (Burma). It’s part of a route that connects India and Thailand through Mandalay.\n\nThe top ten longest bridges in Southeast Asia listed above are the result of the concerted efforts of engineers, architects, contractors, the government, construction companies, construction workers, logistics companies, and others.\n\nGateway Structure Sdn Bhd (GSSB), an established prefabricated vertical drain contractor in Malaysia, is grateful to have been involved in the Second Penang Bridge project by providing our expertise in PVD and geotextile, including PVD installation, vertical drains, and more."
