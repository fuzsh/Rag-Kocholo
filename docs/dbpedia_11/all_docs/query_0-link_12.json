Both electronic and non-electronic sources can provide a variety of information. Records pertaining to various sorts of photos, articles, and other materials are included in the list of materials that are readily available. This finding aids book seeks to make it simple for researchers to locate and get the needed information. All of the items are listed in accordance with the collection type, which includes a straightforward document inventory and descriptions of particular elements. This finding aid's information is based on papers found in Malaysia's National Archives.\n\nINTRODUCTION In the Malay Peninsula, there was a Muslim dynasty called the Kedah Sultanate. It was initially a sovereign state, but in 1909 it became a protectorate of the British Empire. Following its inclusion in the Malayan Union, its monarchy was dissolved; however, it was later reinstated and included in the Federation of Malaya, the Malayan Union's successor. The \"Kedah Annals\" provide information on this sultanate's history both before and after it was established. Over a millennium after the Kedah kingdom's founding, in the eighteenth century, the Kedah Annals were composed. It claims that the first monarch of Kedah arrived on the country's borders as a consequence of an attack by a legendary enormous beast. According to this, the country was created by an ancestor of Alexander the Great, who remained close to Rome during his rule (two centuries after the fall of the Western Roman Empire, but while the Eastern Roman Empire still existed).However, according to Thai history, Kedah was once a Thai city like Nakhon Si Thammarat and a member of the Siamese kingdom until becoming a Malay state following Muslim kingdom invasions up until the present day. The Kedah Annals also provide inaccurate information about the sultans of Kedah, naming Sultan Mudzafar Shah I as the first sultan of the state centuries before the division of the Abbasid Caliphate into separate sultanates and nearly three centuries before the Terengganu Inscription Stone's contradictory claims. This assertion also directly conflicts with the assertion that Kedah was under the direct rule of the Buddhist Srivijaya kingdom at the time Sultan Mudzafar Shah I reportedly transformed the area into a sultanate. Maybe Kedah was Hindu-Buddhist till the fifteenth century.\n\nThe state flag displays a green crescent under a yellow shield and is surrounded by a bouquet of yellow rice on a red background. Red is the traditional color of the state and also symbolizes luxury, while the crescent moon is a symbol of Islam. The shield symbolizes the Sultan of the state as the protector and guardian of his people.\n\nThe bouquet consisting of rice seeds symbolizes the state's main agricultural commodity - rice. The crescent moon symbolizes Islam while the shield symbolizes government power.\n\nEarly career Sultan Abdul Halim Mu'adzam Shah ibni Almarhum Sultan Badlishah Title : SULTAN KEDAH, SULTAN ABDUL HALIM MU'ADZAM SHAH IBNI ALMARHUM SULTAN BADLISHAH; 23.7.1970 Identifier Number : 2001/0039024W\n\nAl-Sultan Al-Mu’tassimu Billahi Muhibbuddin Tuanku Al-Haj Abdul Halim Mu'adzam Shah ibni Almarhum Sultan Badlishah ,November 1927 – 11 September 2017) was the 28th Sultan of Kedah, reigning from 1958 to 2017.
