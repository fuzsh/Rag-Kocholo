        "text": "Mujahid\n\nPlease provide the references for the word stated Mir Ghulam Ali as traitor, with few references and a play from girlish Karnak that he was loyal and a relative to tipu sultan from one of his wife and a prominent sayyid. For more clarification you can write to me on “muju09384@gmail.com”.\n\nMujahid\n\n@Maddy : thanks for an update, but this article has no source of determining him as an impostor. Though many of the gazetteers are showing him as a power of tipu and relative too.\n\nMujahid\n\n@Maddy : thanks for an update, but this article has no source of determining him as an impostor. Though many of the gazetteers are showing him as a power of tipu and relative too. Appreciate if you could share with me any source of him related to his lineage. Thanks\n\nMaddy\n\nCan’t help you there Mujahid, perhaps more of oral history as they call it , anyway I will check a bit more.\n\nMeanwhile another article provides another angle to his life, quite unbelievable\n\nhttps://www.therahnuma.com/mir-ghulam-ali-the-indian-who-ended-frances-1000-year-old-monarchy-for-tipu-sultan/\n\nMaddy\n\nMujahid,\n\nIf you read the Waqai-i- manzil by Mohibbul Haasan (pg1) and Irfan Habib's State & diplomacy (pg62) you will find that Ghulam Ali Langra was put in jail and then released after his return from Istanbul. Later on, after the fall of Seringapatanam, he was granted a pension in 1799 by the British and you will find many references to his pension, entreaties by his wife Sara Begum to the British for its reinstatement etc in the 'guide to the N Arcot records'. That he was provided a large and handsome pension by the British would have meant that Ali had helped the British somehow, and this led to the conjecture by his detractors that he was a traitor.\n\nMaddy\n\nFor exact details of the treachery, see page 320 of Mohibul Hasan's History of Tipu Sultan.Ed2, 1971, page 320 (earlier editions do not have this para)\n\nHarris informed Ghulam Ali Khan, mir sudur that if he helped the English in securing the surrender of Mysore forts, the Governor-General would confirm him in his jagir in perpetuity that he had held under Tipu and would also, in addition, grant him adequate compensation. Ghulam Ali Khan, thereupon, issued orders to the commandants to surrender their forts to the English. Gooty and Hulal alone resisted but were captured. Ref W.P., B.M. 13728, Harris to Wellesley, May 18, 1799, ff. 98a-b\n\nMujahid\n\nThanks Maddy was informative, appreciate if you could share the details of his lineage/descendants. As I believe there were 2 ghulam ali in tipus court and till the fall of tipu he was very much involved in their court matters.\n\nThanks\n\nMaddy\n\nSome other time, my friend- he is at the extreme periphery of my present interests, these studies take a lot of time, as you know! Maybe there is another Ghulam Ali, as you believe!"
