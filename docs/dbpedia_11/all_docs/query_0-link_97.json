        "text": "Dear friends around the world,\n\nI have lived in Malaysia for over 20 years. During this time, I have developed a great appreciation for the cultures and customs that exist in Malaysia, which has inspired me to write more about the aspects of Malaysia that enrich its culture. Here is another interesting post to give you more background and understanding of Malaysia.\n\nMalaysia adopts a constitutional monarchy system that is a mixture of hereditary and elected monarchs. Malaysia consists of several administrative regions across thirteen states and three federal territories. Nine states are ruled by monarchs, four states are supervised by a Yang di-Pertua Negeri or Governor, and the Federal Government controls the remaining three federal territories.\n\nFor the purpose of this article, we will focus on the office of the Yang di-Pertuan Agong or the Head of State of Malaysia, and the nine states that are ruled by either hereditary or elective monarchs. These states are:\n\nJohor Darul Ta’zim\n\nKedah Darul Aman\n\nKelantan Darul Naim\n\nNegeri Sembilan Darul Khusus\n\nPahang Darul Makmur\n\nPerak Darul Ridzuan\n\nPerlis Indera Kayangan\n\nSelangor Darul Ehsan\n\nTerengganu Darul Iman\n\nI am pleased to present to you the monarchy in Malaysia, its history, and how these unique systems have been implemented successfully for many years. I do so with the greatest respect to the rulers and monarchy of Malaysia.\n\nTsem Rinpoche\n\nOverview\n\nMalaysia consists of several Malay kingdoms and regions that were previously part of British Protectorates and Colonial territories. After the unsuccessful attempt to set up the Malayan Union between 1946 and 1948, the British Administrators established the Federation of Malaya in 1948, which acknowledged the symbolic status of Malay’s rulers.\n\nThe Federation of Malaya consisted of nine Malay kingdoms: Johor, Kedah, Kelantan, Negeri Sembilan, Perak, Perlis, Selangor, and Terengganu, and two British colonial territories, Penang and Malacca. The British High Commissioner, a senior British diplomat in charge of one Commonwealth region, presided over the Federation of Malaya, and was assisted by the Executive Council and the Legislative Council.\n\nOn 31 August 1957, the Federation of Malaya declared its independence from the British Empire. On 16 September 1963, the Federation of Malaysia, henceforth simply known as Malaysia, was established. Its members included the former members of the Federation of Malaya and three new members: North Borneo, Sarawak, and Singapore. Singapore exited the federation two years later.\n\nList of states in Malaysia:\n\nNo. State Capital City Head of State 1. State Johor Darul Ta’zim (“Johor”) Johor Bahru Sultan 2.

The Yang di-Pertuan Agong is Malaysia’s head of state, and is elected by the Majlis Raja-Raja (the Conference of Rulers). The members of the Conference of Rulers play important roles in amending constitutions, especially those related to the rulers’ status, the rights of indigenous citizens, the national language, and other related policies. The first person elected by the Conference of Rulers to be Yang di-Pertuan Agong was Sultan Ibrahim of Johor (1873 – 1959; r. 1895 – 1959). However, the 84 year old ruler declined the position due to his old age. The Conference of Rulers then elected Tuanku Abdul Rahman from Negeri Sembilan (1895 – 1960; r. 1933 – 1960) as the first Yang di-Pertuan Agong instead.\n\nThe Election Process\n\nThe Conference of Rulers is responsible for determining who will be Yang di-Pertuan Agong once every five years, or in the event the position is vacant either due to death or other reasons. The four state governors also attended the conference, but do not have the right to vote or stand for election for the office of Yang di-Pertuan Agong.\n\nThe following are the criteria of candidates to be eligible to become Yang di-Pertuan Agong:\n\nThe candidate is ruler of a sultanate or kingdom within Malaysia\n\nThe candidate has reached adulthood\n\nThe candidate has not previously notified the Keeper of the Rulers’ Seal that he does not wish to be considered for election to the office of Yang di-Pertuan Agong\n\nThe Conference of Rulers does not object to the candidate’s election for reasons that reflect reasonable doubt that the candidate is unsuitable to carry out the responsibilities of Yang di-Pertuan Agong.\n\nDuring the election process, the Keeper of the Rulers’ Seal distributes a ballot with a candidate’s name. Each ruler is to specify his thoughts on whether the candidate is suitable for the office of Yang di-Pertuan Agong. The Keeper of the Rulers’ Seal and the most junior ruler, who does not stand for election, count the ballots together. The office of Yang di-Pertuan Agong will be offered to a candidate who obtains at least five votes.\n\nIf the candidate declines the offer, or does not manage to secure the majority of available votes, the election process is repeated with the next ruler on the list of Seniority of States as a candidate.\n\nThe List of Seniority of States:\n\nThe Yamtuan Besar of Negeri Sembilan\n\nThe Sultan of Selangor\n\nThe Raja of Perlis\n\nThe Sultan of Terengganu\n\nThe Sultan of Kedah\n\nThe Sultan of Kelantan\n\nThe Sultan of Pahang\n\nThe Sultan of Johor\n\nThe Sultan of Perak\n\nAfter the Yang di-Pertuan Agong is elected, the holder of the office appoints a regent to help perform his responsibilities in his home state, except for the role of the Head of Islam. The Yang di-Pertuan Agong retains the rights to be the Head of Islam in his home state.\n\nThe List of Yang di-Pertuan Agong of Malaysia:\n\nNo. Name Term State 1. Tuanku Abdul Rahman 1957-1960 Negeri Sembilan 2. Sultan Hisamuddin Alam Shah 1960 Selangor 3. Raja Syed Putra 1960-1965 Perlis 4. Sultan Ismail Nasiruddin Shah 1965-1970 Terengganu 5.

Sultan Muhammad V Elected in October 2016 Kelantan\n\nPrivileges and Responsibilities of Yang di-Pertuan Agong\n\nThe Yang di-Pertuan Agong must carry out the following responsibilities:\n\nAppoint important government positions, including the Council of Ministers (i.e., Prime Minister, Deputy Prime Minister, Chief Secretary of the Government), commissions and committees (i.e., the Election Commission, the Judicial and Legal Service Commission, Malaysian Public Service Commission), judges (i.e., the Chief Justice of Malaysia, the Chief Judge of Malaya, and the Chief Judge of Sabah and Sarawak), senators, and governors\n\nBecome the Head of Islam in the four states governed by governors, the three Federal Territories, and his home state\n\nBe the Commander-in-Chief, the highest ranking office in military chain of command\n\nRemoval of Immunity\n\nIn 1993, the Malaysian constitution was amended to remove the immunity of Yang di-Pertuan Agong and the state rulers in their personal capacity. The constitution also states that Yang di-Pertuan Agong or any rulers cannot pardon himself or his immediate family members. However, it is possible for them to request a pardon from the Conference of Rulers.\n\nMonarchy Systems in various Malaysian states\n\nCurrently, there are nine states in Malaysia that adopt a constitutional monarchy system. The state constitutions specify that only men of royal descent and of Muslim faith are eligible to be the ruler of the state. Like other constitutional monarchies, the rulers are not involved in the day-to-day governance of their states. However, they retained the right to be the Head of Islam, and to appoint the Menteri Besar (Chief Minister), or the head of government of the state.\n\nKedah\n\nBrief History\n\nKedah sultanate is also known as Darul Aman or the ‘Abode of Peace’. Kedah was originally a Hindu kingdom founded in 630 BC by Maharaja Derbar Raja of Gemeron, also known as Bandar Abbas. A Persian King who was defeated in a battle, he escaped and was stranded in Kedah. Bandar Abbas developed a good rapport with the Kedah people, and they enthroned him as their king, Sri Paduka Maharaja Durbar Raja I.\n\nBy the end of the 11th century, Islam’s influence had reached Kedah. The 9th Maharaja of Kedah, Sri Paduka Maharaja Durbar Raja II converted to this new belief, and later changed his name and title into Sultan Mudzafar Shah I (r. 1136-1179). Since then, the Kedah kingdom became Kedah sultanate. Historically, Kedah has fallen under the control of the Srivijaya kingdom, Siam, Britain, and Japan. When Kedah was a tributary state of Siam, it had to regularly send Bunga Mas or Golden Flowers and other valuable gifts to the Siamese kingdom. In the 18th century, the Sultan of Kedah gave Penang and the Province of Wellesley to the British in exchange for their protection against Siam. However, the Siamese invaded Kedah in 1821 and regained control of that region. Siam also separated Perlis territory from Kedah sultanate. In 1909, the Anglo-Siamese Treaty was signed and Britain gained control over Kedah. Siam re-acquired control over Kedah briefly during the World War II as a reward for their alliance with Japan, but the state was returned to the British empire after the World War II. Kedah joined the Federation of Malaya in 1948 and later Malaysia in 1963.\n\nKedah Monarchy System\n\nKedah sultanate adopts a hereditary and constitutional monarchy system. The current Sultan of Kedah is Sultan Abdul Halim Mu’adzam Shah (1927 – present; r. 1958 – present). He inherited the throne from his father, Sultan Badlishah (1894 – 1958; r. 1943 – 1958).\n\nKelantan\n\nBrief History\n\nKelantan State has a colourful, if not turbulent history. Chinese, Indian and Siamese traders have done trading in Kelantan throughout history, which made it attractive for foreign power to gain control of this region. In the 13th and 14th century, Kelantan sultanate became a tributary state to the Majapahit and Srivijaya kingdom respectively. In the 15th century, Kelantan became a tributary state to Siam and later Malacca. When Kelantan was a tributary state of Siam, it had to regularly send Bunga Mas or Golden Flowers and other valuable gifts to the Siamese kingdom. During the Portuguese occupation of Malacca, Kelantan sultanate was divided into several smaller regions under the authority of feudal lords. The Siamese regained control over this area and subjected them to the authority of the Pattani kingdom.\n\nIn 1760, a lord from Kubang Labu named Long Muhammad or Long Pandak reunited the former Kelantan territories and established himself as ruler. Several years later, a Pattani warlord, Long Yunus deposed Long Pandak and declared himself as the king or Raja of Kelantan (1734 – 1794; r. 1775 – 1794). After the passing of Raja Yunus, the authority over Kelantan was transferred to Terengganu under the authority of Yang di-Pertuan Muda Tengku Muhammad, the son of Sultan Mansur of Terengganu (r. 1794 – 1800). In 1800, the son of Raja Yunus, Long Muhammad, declared himself as the ruler of Kelantan under the title of Sultan Muhammad I (r. 1800 – 1835). Kelantan joined the Federation of Malaya in 1948 and the Federation of Malaysia in 1963.\n\nKelantan Monarchy System\n\nKelantan State adopts a hereditary and constitutional monarchy system. The holder of Sultan of Kelantan office is the designated leader of Kelantan state and the Head of Islam. The current ruler of Kelantan is Sultan Muhammad V (1969 – present; r. 2010 – present). He inherited the throne from his father, Sultan Ismail Petra (r. 1979 – 2010).\n\nJohor\n\nBrief History\n\nJohor was originally part of Malaccan sultanate. In 1511, Portuguese conquered Malacca and Sultan Mahmud Shah had to flee his kingdom to Bintan. He had made several unsuccessful attempts to re-occupy his kingdom before the Portuguese finally raided Bintan in 1526 and forced him to escape to Kampar, Sumatra. Sultan Mahmud Shah passed away in 1528, and his two sons formed their own sultanates. Sultan Muzaffar Shah (r. 1528 – 1549) established Perak sultanate, while Sultan Alauddin Riayat Shah (1513 – 1564; r. 1528 – 1564) established Johor sultanate. For a period of time, the new Sultan and his descendants were harassed by both the Portuguese and the Acehnese, but they managed to retain his new territory.\n\nIn the early 17th century, the Dutch arrived in Southeast Asia and signed two treaties of alliance with Johor sultanate in 1606. The Dutch and Johor sultanate then joined forces to defeat the Portuguese in Malacca. After the war, the Dutch took control of Malacca, and as per the previously signed treaties, the Dutch agreed to not occupy Johor sultanate territories.\n\nBetween 1666 and 1673, Jambi, a part of Johor sultanate, became a prosperous region and tried to break free from Johor. This separatist intention created a civil war. During this time, Sultan of Johor strived to keep his sultanate together and was forced to shift his capital city several times. In the 17th century, Johor became a trading hub with more influence than Malacca. The Dutch were not happy about this, but they continued to honour the previously signed treaties. The last Sultan of the original Malaccan Dynasty was Sultan Mahmud Shah II (1675 – 1699; r. 1685 – 1699) of Johor. He died without a son, and therefore, the dominant faction of his court selected Bendahara Abdul Jalil (r. 1699 – 1720) to succeed him as Sultan Abdul Jalil IV.\n\nThe throne was later usurped by Raja Kecil, who claimed to be the son of Sultan Mahmud Shah II. Raja Kecil hired an assassin to kill Sultan Abdul Jalil IV and enthroned himself as Sultan of Johor. However, Raja Kecil’s reign was short lived, as Sultan Abdul Jalil’s son, Sultan Sulaiman (r. 1722 – 1760) reclaimed the throne with the help of the influential Bugis personality, Daeng Parani. After Sultan Sulaiman had been enthroned as the Sultan of Johor, Daeng Merewah, Daeng Parani’s brother, was appointed as the Yam Tuan Muda or the heir presumptive to the throne. In 1819, Johor sultanate was divided into Johor mainland and Riau-Lingga territory. Sultan of Johor maintained their control over Johor mainland, while Riau-Lingga territory was given to the Bugis clan.\n\nAfter the loss of Riau-Lingga, Johor continued to evolve into a modern sultanate. During the reign of Sultan Abu Bakar of Johor (1833 – 1895; r. 1862 – 1895), he established a British-style administration and a state constitution, and therefore was known as the Father of Modern Johor. Johor joined the Federation of Malaya in 1948 and the Federation of Malaysia in 1963.\n\nJohor Monarchy System\n\nJohor adopts a hereditary and constitutional monarchy system. The current Sultan of Johor is Sultan Ibrahim Ismail (1958 – present; r. 2010 – present). He inherited the throne from his father, Sultan Iskandar (1932 – 2010; r. 1981 – 2010).\n\nNegeri Sembilan\n\nBrief History\n\nNegeri Sembilan was a tributary state of Malaccan sultanate. After Malacca fell to Portuguese power, the state came under the protection of Johor sultanate. In the 14th century, citizens from Minangkabau in Sumatra migrated to Negeri Sembilan. Therefore, unlike other states, the majority of people in the Negeri Sembilan adopted a matrilineal system, which is a characteristic of Minangkabau society. In the 18th century, Johor sultanate had to deal with internal matters, and could not protect Negeri Sembilan from the Bugis attacks. Therefore, Negeri Sembilan sought protection from Sultan Abdul Jalil Pagar Ruyung in Minangkabau, who later sent his son Raja Melewar as his representative.\n\nHowever, when Raja Melewar arrived in Negeri Sembilan, he found that another party called Raja Khatib had declared himself as the ruler of Negeri Sembilan. Raja Melewar declared war on the new king, dethroned Raja Khatib, and enthroned himself as the ruler of Negeri Sembilan. Johor sultanate recognised Raja Melewar (r. 1773 – 1795) as Negeri Sembilan’s ruler and granted him the title Yamtuan Seri Menanti or ‘He Who is the Highest Lord of Seri Menanti’. After the passing of Raja Melewar, the selection of the subsequent rulers often resulted in civil war and instability, as there were competing interests and supports to various claimants to the throne. In 1873, the British decided to protect their interests in Negeri Sembilan by intervening in the civil war. Subsequently, the region fell under British occupation. Negeri Sembilan joined the Federation of Malaya in 1948 and the Federation of Malaysia in 1963.\n\nNegeri Sembilan Monarchy System\n\nNegeri Sembilan adopts an elective and constitutional monarchy system. The ruler of Negeri Sembilan is called Yang di-Pertuan Besar or ‘He Who Is Made Great’. He is elected by the Ruling Chiefs of Negeri Sembilan, also known as Undang, for life. The following are the list of Undang who have the right to vote, but do not have the right to stand for election:\n\nThe Undang of Sungai Ujong\n\nThe Undang of Jelebu\n\nThe Undang of Johol\n\nThe Undang of Rembau\n\nIn order for a candidate to be eligible for Yang di-Pertuan Besar office, the candidate must be male, Muslim, and recognised as the descendant of Raja Radin Ibni Raja Lenggang. The current Yang di-Pertuan Besar of Negeri Sembilan is Tuanku Muhriz (1948 – present; r. 2008 – present).\n\nPahang\n\nBrief History\n\nThe first Sultan of Pahang was Muhammad Shah (r. 1470 – 1475). He was the heir presumptive to the Malaccan throne before being banished to Pahang by his father, Sultan Mansyur Syah (r. 1459 – 1477) for committing a murder. Pahang was under the authority of several kingdoms, namely, Srivijaya, Majapahit, Siam, and Malacca. In the 16th century, Pahang became a subject of interest for the Portuguese, Dutch, Johor, and Aceh. In the 17th century, Pahang became one of Johor sultanate’s territories. However, considering that the rulers of Pahang are descended from the Malaccan and Johor royal families, they managed to gain some degree of autonomy from Johor sultanate. During the reign of Bendahara Tun Ali of Pahang (r. 1806-1847), peace and stability were maintained. Unfortunately, after he passed away, his sons, Tun Mutahir (r. 1858 – 1863) and Tun Ahmad argued about who had the right to inherit the throne and initiated a civil war. Tun Ahmad (r. 1863 – 1881) was later enthroned as the new sultan, but his authority was significantly reduced because he was forced to submit to the British administration.\n\nAfter Johor sultanate lost the Riau-Lingga region to the Bugis, Temenggung Ibrahim of Johor signed a treaty with Bendahara Tun Mutahir of Pahang (r. 1858 – 1863), which stated that Temenggung Ibrahim and his descendants reserved the rights to rule over the state of Johor, while Bendahara Tun Mutahir and his descendants reserved the rights to rule over the state of Pahang. After the treaty was signed, Pahang became independent of Johor. Pahang joined the Federation of Malaya in 1948 and the Federation of Malaysia in 1963.\n\nPahang Monarchy System\n\nPahang is currently the 3rd largest state in Malaysia. Pahang adopts a hereditary and constitutional monarchy system. The current ruler of Pahang state is Sultan Ahmad Shah (r. 1974 – present). He inherited the throne from his father, the late Sultan Abu Bakar of Pahang (1904 – 1974; r. 1932 – 1974).\n\nPerlis\n\nBrief History\n\nPerlis was originally part of Kedah sultanate. In the 19th century, when Kedah was under Siamese rule, Siam separated Perlis from Kedah and installed its governor and deputy governor. On 20th May 1843, the Siamese enthroned Sayyid Hussain Jamalulail as Raja of Perlis (r. 1843 – 1873), an equivalent of a king or ruler. The new Raja was the maternal grandson of the Sultan of Kedah. Similar to Kedah sultanate, in the early 20th century, Siam was forced to give up some of its territories to the British’s authority, including Perlis. Perlis was returned to Siamese rule temporarily during the World War II as a reward for Siam’s alliance with Japan. After Japan lost the war, Perlis was returned to Britain. Perlis joined the Federation of Malaya in 1948 and the Federation of Malaysia in 1963.\n\nPerlis Monarchy System\n\nPerlis adopts a hereditary and constitutional monarchy system. Unlike most the other Malaysian states, the monarchs of Perlis are called Raja instead of Sultan. The current Raja of Perlis is Tuanku Syed Sirajuddin Jamalullail (1943 – present; r. 2000 – present). He inherited the throne from his father, the late Tuanku Syed Putra Jamalullail (1920 – 2000; r. 1945 – 2000).\n\nPerak\n\nBrief History\n\nAfter Malacca had fallen into Portuguese control in 1511, the son of the Malaccan Sultan Mahmud Syah I, Sultan Alauddin Riayat Shah II, established Perak sultanate in 1528, and enthroned himself as the first Sultan of Perak. The Dutch arrived in Perak in the mid-17th century and used their connection with Aceh to force the Sultan of Perak to sign a treaty that would allow the Dutch to build plants and trade in Perak. However, since the Dutch failed to establish a good rapport with the Perak residents, the people of Perak destroyed the plant and forced the Dutch to leave. In 1670, the Dutch managed to gain the Perak ruler’s permission to build a Fortress on Pangkor Island known as Kota Belanda. However, 15 years later, the people of Perak attacked the fortress and forced the Dutch to close their operations in Perak once again.\n\nIn the 19th century, the British forced Perak to submit to its authority and installed Sultan Abdullah as the new king of Perak, and a British official, James W. W. Birch was commissioned to administer the sultanate. Unfortunately for Mr. Birch, he was murdered by the Perak people. The British, unhappy with the incident, exiled Sultan Abdullah to Seychelles, and installed a new king, Sultan Yusuf Sharifudin Mudzaffar Shah in 1877. The British installed a new official who was proficient in the Malay language and familiar with local culture, Sir Hugh Low. He was more successful as the administrator of Perak than his predecessor. Perak joined the Federation of Malaya in 1948 and the Federation of Malaysia in 1963.\n\nPerak Monarchy System\n\nPerak adopts an elective and constitutional monarchy system. The ruler is elected among the most senior princes who are the descendants of Sultan Ahmaddin (r. 1786- 1806), the 18th Sultan of Pahang. Therefore, the male descendants from the previous Sultan are also eligible to be the reigning monarch of Perak. The current Sultan is Nazrin Muizzuddin Shah of Perak (1956 – present; r. 2014 – present).\n\nSelangor\n\nBrief History\n\nSelangor was part of the Malaccan kingdom. After the Portuguese annexed Malacca, Johor, Aceh and Siam attempted to claim Selangor territory, but they were unsuccessful. When the Dutch arrived in Malacca, they invited Bugis settlers to come to Selangor, and the newcomers displaced the existing Minangkabau settlers. The rulers of Selangor sultanate were descended from the Bugis settlers who claimed to be related to the Luwu rulers in Sulawesi. The first Sultan of Selangor was Sultan Sallehuddin Shah, also known as Raja Lumu (1705 – 1778; r. 1756 – 1778), the son of a Bugis warrior, Daeng Chelak. The rulers of Perak and Johor initially challenged the enthronement of Sultan Sallehuddin Shah, but he managed to gain some level of legitimacy through the marriage with a member of the Perak royal family. In the 19th century, the exploitation of tin resources in Selangor resulted in economic prosperity. During the reign of Sultan Muhammad Shah (r. 1826 – 1857), Selangor was divided into five territories: Bernam, Kuala Selangor, Kelang, Langat, and Lukut, each with their individual leaders.\n\nIn 1866, Sultan Abdul Samad, also known as Raja Abdul Samad (1804 – 1898; r. 1857 – 1898), favoured Raja Abdulah as the ruler of Klang instead of Raja Mahadi, the son of the previous ruler. This appointment triggered the Klang War. Sultan Abdul Samad’s son-in-law, Tengku Kudin, was given the task to manage the situation. Tengku Kudin enlisted the help of mercenaries, Pahang sultanate, and Sir Andrew Clarke from Britain. Because of this, unlike other states, Selangor invited and welcomed British involvement. Sultan Abdul Samad also accepted a British resident, Frank Swettenham, as his adviser. The stability that followed under the British administration resulted in prosperity for the state of Selangor. Selangor joined the Federation of Malaya in 1948 and the Federation of Malaysia 1963. Sultan Salahuddin of Selangor (1926 – 2001; r. 1960 – 2001) consented to hand over Kuala Lumpur to the Federal Government in 1974, and Putrajaya in 2001.\n\nSelangor Monarchy system\n\nSelangor state adopts a hereditary and constitutional monarchy system. The current Sultan is Sharafuddin of Selangor (1945 – present; r. 2001 – present). He inherited the throne from his father, the late Sultan Salahuddin of Selangor.\n\nTerengganu\n\nBrief History\n\nTerengganu was originally a vassal state of Malaccan sultanate and later of Johor sultanate. It also stood out as the first state in the Malay region to accept Islam as its religion, as recorded in the Terengganu Inscription Stone. In 1725, Terengganu became an independent sultanate under Tun Zainal Abidin (r. 1725 – 1733), a relative of Sultan of Johor. In the 19th century, the political power shifted, and Terengganu became a tributary state of Siam and had to regularly send Bunga Mas or Golden Flowers and other valuable gifts to the Siamese kingdom. Terengganu prospered during this period, since the Siamese gave them considerable autonomy to govern themselves. In the 20th century, Terengganu became a tributary state of Britain. The British empire forced Terengganu sultanate to accept a British adviser. However, this manoeuvre was unpopular amongst the locals. Siam re-acquired control over Terengganu briefly during the Japanese occupation, but the state was returned to the British empire after World War II. Terengganu joined the Federation of Malaya in 1948 and later Malaysia in 1963.\n\nTerengganu Monarchy System\n\nTerengganu adopts a hereditary and constitutional monarchy system. The current Sultan is Tuanku Mizan Zainal Abidin of Terengganu (1962 – present; r. 1998 – present). He inherited the throne upon the death of his father, the late Sultan Mahmud (1930 – 1998; r. 1979 – 1998).\n\nSources:\n\nhttp://thecommonwealth.org/our-member-countries/malaysia/history\n\nhttp://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/malaysia.htm\n\nhttp://www.countryreports.org/country/Malaysia.htm\n\nhttp://www.countryreports.org/country/Malaysia/government.htm\n\nhttp://www.countryreports.org/country/Malaysia.htm\n\nhttp://www.wonderfulmalaysia.com/malaysia-history-and-historical-facts.htm\n\nhttp://www.kln.gov.my/web/guest/history\n\nhttp://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2016/10/11/rulers-to-choose-next-yang-dipertuan-agong/\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yang_di-Pertuan_Agong\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchies_of_Malaysia\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kedah_Sultanate\n\nhttp://factsanddetails.com/southeast-asia/Malaysia/sub5_4c/entry-3672.html\n\nhttp://www.malaysianbar.org.my/constitutional_law/powers_and_functions_of_state_rulers.html\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johor_Sultanate\\\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johor\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kedah_Sultanate\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/notes/dravidian-keyboard-warriors/kesultanan-negeri-kedah-kedah-sultanate-invasion-of-chola-kadaram-kondan-conquer/1085195028161653/\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Kedah\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelantan\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sultan_of_Kelantan\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negeri_Sembilan\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pahang\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sultan_of_Pahang\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Bakar_of_Pahang\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmad_Shah_of_Pahang\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perak\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdul_Samad_of_Selangor\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salahuddin_of_Selangor\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahmud_of_Terengganu\n\nhttp://www.terengganu.gov.my\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elective_monarchy\n\nFor more interesting information:\n\nThe Buddhist Kingdoms of Indonesia\n\nThe Crown Prince of Johor Urges Muslims to Respect Other Beliefs\n\nEmperor Ashoka The Great\n\nEmperor Kangxi\n\nKing Milindu (Menader I) & Arahanth Nagasena (Part 1)\n\nThe Sixteen Dreams of King Pasenadi Kosol and Their Interpretations by The Buddha\n\nBritain Should Stop Trying to Pretend That Its Empire Was Benevolent\n\n5 Atrocities of the British Empire"
