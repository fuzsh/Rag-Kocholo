        "text": "Sultan Abdullah took the oath at 11.16am on Tuesday (Jan 15).\n\nWith three hails of \"Allahuakhbar\" and another three of \"Daulat Tuanku\", Sultan Abdullah was proclaimed the sixth modern Sultan of Pahang.\n\nHe would henceforth rule under the name of Sultan Abdullah Al-Haj Ibni Sultan Haji Ahmad Shah.\n\nSultan Abdullah succeeded his ailing father, Paduka Ayahanda Sultan Ahmad Shah, who abdicated the throne after reigning for nearly 45 years.\n\nArticle 9A of the amended state constitution empowered the royal council to conduct the abdication of a ruler due to ill health.\n\nThe proclamation ceremony was attended by members of the Pahang royal family, state excos, assemblymen and heads of departments.\n\nAlso at the event were Economic Affairs Minister Datuk Seri Mohamed Azmin Ali, Foreign Minister Datuk Saifuddin Abdullah, Sembrong MP Datuk Seri Hishammuddin Hussein and Pekan MP Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak, who is a Orang Besar Berempat.\n\nSultan Ahmad Shah was not present at the ceremony held at Istana Abu Bakar here.\n\nThe modern era of the Pahang sultanate can be traced back to 1882 when a Raja Bendahara, known as Wan Ahmad, took upon the title of Sultan Ahmad Al-Muadzam Shah after defeating his brother in a civil war.\n\nTwo of his sons ruled the state successively as Sultan Mahmud and Sultan Abdullah Al-Mu'tassim Billah.\n\nThe dynastic sultanate was continued by Sultan Abu Bakar and, from 1974 onward, Sultan Ahmad Shah."
