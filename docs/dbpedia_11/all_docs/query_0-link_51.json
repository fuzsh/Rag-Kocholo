Jalaluddin Muhammad Shah was a 15th century Sultan of Bengal who converted from Hinduism to Islam. Born as a Hindu named Yadu or Jadu, he was the son of Raja Ganesha, a Hindu aristocrat who seized control of Bengal after the death of the previous Muslim ruler. Under pressure to convert to Islam, Jalaluddin did so and adopted the name Jalaluddin Muhammad Shah. He ruled Bengal for 16 years as a Muslim king, expanding its territory and consolidating administrative centers while also maintaining relations with other Muslim rulers. During his reign, Bengal grew in wealth and population as he combined Bengali and Islamic cultural influences.",
