        "text": "My maid’s agent told me that I need to get my maid to undergo FOMEMA medical check-up and the renewal should be completed by 14th October 2010. Since today is 14th October , then it is too obvious that I won’t make it on time. The agent then advised that I need to get a Special Pass from the Immigration Department for my maid to complete her medical check-up within an extended 1 month period. So today I took a day off to settle her immigration issues.\n\nAt 8.30am, I entered the Immigration Dept building at Putrajaya. The guard at the entrance was very helpful by showing me the way to the area for foreign maid matters. The place was at the 2nd floor of that building. There was an information counter at the very corner near the elevator. I approached the uniformed personnel at the counter and asked him to whom should I speak to for my problem. He took my maid’s passport from me and shortly after inspecting the passport, he gave me my waiting number. I was instructed to wait at the sofa area to be called to meet the officer at room 12.\n\nThe sofa area was very cozy. I looked at room 12, there’s an officer there but she has a guest / her staff talking to her. So I waited at the sofa. At about 8.55am, the staff who was talking to the officer left the room. I approached the room and to my surprise, the officer went out and shut the door! I told her I need to see her and she replied, “sila tunggu kejap, ye!” Well, I said to myself, maybe she has a meeting or was summoned by her superior urgently. Whatever her reason was, the door of her room indicates that she is available and not attending any meeting. So, I decided to wait again at the sofa.\n\nAt 9.05am, one man came to the sofa area asking around about the officer at room 12. He said, he had an appointment with the officer at 9.00am! I said to myself again, I’m waiting to see the same officer since 8.40am but the time now has exceeded 9.00am. With this new-comer claiming an appointment fixed for him at 9.00am, I might end up waiting longer to meet the officer.\n\nThank God, the officer came back at 9.40am. The officer addressed the old man waiting at the sofa as a Dato’. She politely told the Dato’ to wait for a while as I came first. And there I was, in her office. I told her my problems and she took my maid’s passport from me for further inspection. To my surprise, she said that although she can approve the appllication for an extended Special Pass, she needs 2 hours for data entry. She explained that since my agent was in Kelantan and my maid was initially registered at Kelantan’s Immigration Office, their system has no record whatsoever about my maid. Because of this, she needs her staff to key-in the information into their system. I thought that most government agencies are on-line nowadays and it doesn’t make any sense for the HQ of the Immigration Dept to have no information on particulars initiated by their branches in other states. Without arguing, I agreed to wait for another 2 hours – allowing them to do the necessary data entry.\n\nTo kill the time, I had nasi lemak at their cafeteria. After the 2 hours, the officer called me on my mobile and she said my documents are ready. I went to see her at her room and I was instructed to pay at the cashier a sum of RM 100 for the special pass. Once payment is made, I was channeled to the counter for Pass Issuance. At this counter, the Special Pass was given to me. The cute officer named Intan Azura told me that I need to go to FOMEMA, get the forms printed and go to my selected clinic for my maid’s medical check-up. She further explained that once the medical results are known, I need to come back to the Immigration to finalise the renewal process.\n\nAs mentioned by Intan Azura, I need to get the FOMEMA form printed. So I headed to the nearest FOMEMA office at Wisma PKNS, Shah Alam. I was very lucky to get a parking box exactly in front of the main entrance to PKNS building. I headed straight to the 3rd floor. I was entertained by another hot chick (I didn’t get her name though…). It took me only 5 minutes to settle everything at FOMEMA.\n\nSo, my conclusion based on my experience above – the Immigration Department has improved its service in general, but keeping a client waiting for a long time is not a good practice for a government agency. But then again, it’s beyond the officer’s power to change what has happened today. The only thing that I think the Immigration Department should consider seriously to upgrade their system whereby it can enable them to capture all information relating to Immigration regardless of the office location. By having this upgrade, people having similar cases as mine will not have to wait for hours just to allow the department to do redundant data entry.\n\nAnd of course, the best part of today is they have good-looking ladies working there – especially the one at FOMEMA (which is not an agency / branch / related to the Immigration Department).\n\nThis would be my first entry on genealogy from a state other than Perak. Since the most senior ruler in Malaysia today is from Kedah, I will be writing about the Ruling House of Kedah as the first non-Perak entry on this blog.\n\nI will start with the first Muslim Ruler of Kedah who reigned under the name of Sultan Muzaffar Shah. According to the Salasilah Kedah, this Sultan Muzaffar Shah had 3 sons – the eldest succeeded to the Kedah Throne as Sultan Muazzam Shah on 13th Safar 575H, the second son was Tunku Mahmud who became the Raja Muda of Kedah and the third son was Tunku Sulaiman who became the Tunku Laksamana of Kedah. Sultan Muazzam had issue 3 children – one son and two daughters. The two daughters were Tunku Maheran and Tunku Puteri. The son succeeded Sultan Muazzam Shah on 8th Syaaban 598H and reigned under the name of Sultan Muhammad Shah.\n\nSultan Muhammad Shah of Kedah had issue two children – a daughter named Tunku Noraishah and a son who later succeeded as Sultan Mathal Shah of Kedah on 13th Jamadil Awal 634H. This Sultan Mathal Shah had two sons. The first was to succeed him on 18th Jamadil Akhir 679H as Sultan of Kedah under the name of Sultan Mahmud Shah. The other son of Sultan Mathal Shah was Tunku Ahmad. Sultan Mahmud Shah was married to one Tunku Aishah. From this union, they were blessed with two sons – Tunku Ibrahim who will later succeed Sultan Mahmud Shah on 15th Jamadil Akhir 721H as Sultan of Kedah reigning as Sultan Ibrahim Shah and Tunku Azlin who was made Raja Bendahara of Kedah. The late Sultan Mahmud was interred at Sungai Emas.\n\nSultan Ibrahim Shah had two sons – the eldest was Tunku Sulaiman and the younger was Tunku Abdul Rahman. Upon the death of Sultan Ibrahim Shah on 11th Rejab 775H, Tunku Sulaiman ascended the Kedah Throne reigning as Sultan Sulaiman Shah. Upon the death of Sultan Sulaiman Shah on 15 Jamadil Akhir 826H, he was succeded by his eldest son reigning as Sultan Attaullah Shah. The younger son – Tunku Mansor was made Raja Muda of Kedah.\n\nSultan Attaullah Shah married firstly with one Che Puan and begot Tunku Pok, Tunku Puteri and a son who will later succeed him as Sultan of Kedah reigining as Sultan Muhammad Jiwa. Sultan Attaullah married secondly to one Tunku Permaisuri and had one issue – Tunku Osman the Tunku Temenggong of Kedah. Sultan Attaullah died on 15 Jamadil Akhir 877H. Sultan Muhammad Jiwa married one Tunku Mariam and begot a son who will later succeed him as Sultan of Kedah reigining as Sultan Mahmud Shah II. The union between Sultan Muhammad Jiwa and Tunku Mariam too were blessed with another child – Tunku Kutam who later married Tunku Muhammad Saad – son of Tunku Temenggong Osman mentioned earlier.\n\nSultan Mahmud Shah II married one Che Larasari begot two children – the eldest succeeded him on 13th Zulkaedah 953H under the name of Sultan Muzaffar Shah II. The younger child was Tunku Noraishah. This Tunku Noraishah will later marry one Tunku Ismail – a great-grandson of Raja Muda Tunku Mansor mentioned earlier. Sultan Muzaffar Shah II married one Che Tempawan and begot one daughter – Tunku Jahara and one son – Tunku Sulaiman who will later ascend the throne of Kedah as Sultan Sulaiman II. This Sultan Sulaiman II married one Che Ranamala and begot a son who sill succeed him as Sultan of Kedah reigning as Sultan Rijaluddin Shah.\n\nSultan Rijaluddin Shah was married to a daughter of a nobleman and her name was Wan Timah. They were blessed with 3 children – the future Sultan Mahayuddin Mansur Shah, the Tunku Pengiran who was later made the Raja Muda of Kedah, and Tunku Rahimah who became the wife of Tunku Muhammad Akib the Raja Bendahara of Kedah. On 13 Jamadil Awal 1072H, Sultan Mahayuddin Mansur Shah died and was succeeded by his son reigning as Sultan Dhiauddin Shah.\n\nSultan Dhiauddin was married to one Che Spachendra and begot the future Sultan Attaullah Muhammad Shah. This Sultan Attaullah Muhammad Shah was married to one Tunku Maheran and begot three children – Tunku Latifah (wife of one Tunku Temenggong Ishak), the future Sultan Abdullah Muazzam Shah and Raja Muda Tunku Ibrahim. The Sultan Attaullah Muhammad Shah died on 13th Jamadil Awal 1110H and was interred at Bukit Pinang. He was suceeded by his son – Sultan Abdullah Muazzam Shah.\n\nSultan Abdullah Muazzam Shah had 3 children – Tunku Aishah, and two other sons who both succeeded to the throne of Kedah. Upon the death of Sultan Abdullah Muazzam Shah on 13th Jamadil Akhir 1118, he was succeeded by his eldest son – Sultan Ahmad Tajuddin Halim Shah who reigned until 15th Zulhijjah 1122. He was then succeeded by his younger brother – Sultan Muhammad Jiwa II.\n\nSultan Muhammad Jiwa II married one Tunku Puteri and begot firstly – Tunku Rahmah who later married Tunku Abdul Rahman (a grandson of Raja Muda Tunku Ibrahim Ibni Almarhum Sultan Attaullah Muhammad Shah mentioned earlier). From this union, they were blessed with a son named Tunku Anum (if I’m not mistaken – the Ruler of Kubang Pasu?). Next, Sultan Muhammad Jiwa II had a son who will later succeed to the Kedah throne as Sultan Abdullah Mukarram Shah. Another son of Sultan Muhammad Jiwa II was one Tunku Dhiauddin who later became the Raja Muda of Kedah.\n\nSultan Abdullah Mukarram Shah was the Sultan of Kedah who signed the 1786 treaty with Francis Light which leads to one of Kedah’s territory – Pulau Pinang to be annexed by the British and subsquently became the first Crown Colony in Malaya. This Sultan Abdullah Mukarram Shah had several children. The eldest is his successor as Sultan of Kedah – Sultan Ahmad Tajuddin Halim Shah II. Second is Tunku Yaakob who later became the Raja Muda of Kedah. Other sons of Sultan Abdullah Mukarram Shah are Tunku Zamzam and Tunku Bisnu. Raja Muda Tunku Yaakob had one issue – Tunku Sulaiman. Tunku Zamzam married one Tunku Long Putih and begot a daughter named Tunku Aishah. This Tunku Aisha will later be the wife of one Syed Hussein. As for Tunku Bisnu, he had one issue – Tunku Muhammad Akib.\n\nSultan Ahmad Tajuddin Halim Shah II married firstly to one Wan Fatimah and begot Tunku Abdullah. This Tunku Abdullah is later made Raja Muda of Kedah. Sultan Ahmad Tajudin Halim Shah II then married secondly to one Che Arshid. From this union, they were blessed with two children. The eldest was the Sultan’s successor – Sultan Zainal Rashid and second was a daughter named Tunku Chik. This Tunku Chik later married the Bendahara of Pahang – Tun Mutahir Bendahara Seri Maharaja. [see the Genealogy of Pahang Rulers].\n\nSultan Zainal Rashid married one Wan Maheran and was blessed with several children namely – the future Sultan Ahmad Tajuddin III, Tunku Dziauddin, Tunku Yusuf, Tunku Yaakob, Tunku Rahimah, Tunku Zamzam, Tunku Sofiah, Tunku Puteri, Tunku Aishah and Tunku Jahara. Tunku Dziauddin married to Raja Arfah – daughter of Sultan Abdul Samad of Selangor. Through this marriage, he gained the trust of his father-in-law which subsequently led to his appointment as the Viceroy of Selangor. Practically, he is acting as ruler on his father-in-law’s behalf. This appointment was not widely accepted by the Royal Selangor kinsmen as they considered Tunku Dziauddin or Tunku Kudin an outsider.\n\nTunku Kudin had several issue. Two of them are Tunku Maharum and Tunku Mariam. Tunku Maharum is later married to Raja Sulaiman who later ascended the Selangor throne as Sultan Alaeddin Sulaiman Shah. In Selangor, Tunku Maharum was granted the title Tengku Ampuan Paduka Seri Negara of Selangor. From this marriage, they were blessed with several children of which the eldest will become the future Sultan of Selangor reigning as Sultan Musa Ghiayatuddin Shah. However, after the Japanese surrendered, the returning British Military Administration deposed him in favour of his younger brother. As an ex-Sultan of Selangor, he was given an ancient Bugis Title – Tengku Kelana Jaya Putera.\n\nThe elder brother of Tunku Dziauddin, was the Sultan Ahmad Tajuddin III. This Sultan Ahmad Tajuddin III had two wives. The first wife was Wan Tan – a daughter of Luang Nik Abidin – a prince from Reman / Pattani. The second wife was Wan Hajar (also known as Wan Besar). This Wan Hajar is the elder sister to Wan Mat Saman – Prime Minister of Kedah who was known as the name-sake of the Wan Mat Saman Canal in Kedah. From the union with Wan Tan, the eldest became the successor of Sultan Ahmad Tajuddin III reigining as Sultan Zainal Rashid Muazzam Shah II. This Sultan Zainal Rashid is married to Tunku Mariam – daughter of Tunku Dziauddin Viceroy of Selangor mentioned earlier. Sultan Ahmad Tajuddin III was also blessed with several children from his partnership with Wan Hajar – which includes the successor to Sultan Zainal Rashid II as Sultan of Kedah – Sultan Abdul Hamid Halim Shah.\n\nA separate entry will later be written specifically for the descendants of Sultan Abdul Hamid Halim Shah.\n\nIt has been quite some time since my last entry in this blog. Every now and then, I do check the stats report on this blog and I am amazed that people still visit this website – mostly directed by search engines based on Malay Genealogy-related keywords.\n\nFor this entry, I’d like to share my Hari Raya vacation for this year. At first, I was still undecided whether to celebrate Hari Raya in Kelantan or Perak. My suggestion was to celebrate the 1st day of Eid in Perak and travel to Kelantan on the 2nd day of Eid. That was only a suggestion. Due to unforeseen financial circumstances, we’ve decided to just celebrate Eid in Putrajaya.\n\nBut, on Wednesday evening, at about 9pm, someone who owes me unexpectedly paid-up their debt (though not all) and the funds are more than enough to cover our Eid expenses.Within the hour, we’ve decided to travel to Kelantan that very evening. We started our journey from Putrajaya at about 3am. Traffic was rather smooth from Putrajaya to the toll at Gombak. From Gombak, we took the Karak highway and to our surprise, we were stucked in a very long queue which began from the entrance of the Genting Sempah tunnel. Imagine traveling from Genting Sempah to the Petronas station just before the Bentong exit at 20km per hour!\n\nFrom that particular Petronas, traffic was surprisingly clear. We stopped at Temerloh for Subuh prayers and continued our journey to Kemaman via the East Coast Highway. Oh by the way, we did not want to use the Gua Musang route to Kelantan – just to avoid the long queue in a trunk road. We arrived in Kemaman at about 8am and we switched drivers just after the KSB junction. From there we continued our journey to Kota Bharu via Kuala Terengganu.\n\nWe reached Kuala Terengganu at about 11am and spent an hour walking down the memory lane. Not long before, we used to stay in Kuala Terengganu from 2003 – 2007. My son Idris spent his early months in Terengganu. We had the opportunity to see our old house in Gong Badak which is now converted into a homestay. We also went to Universiti Malaysia Terengganu where my wife and I first met in 2003. We went on to the coastal road near UMT to continue our journey to Kota Bharu.\n\nTraffic was also smooth here. In fact the next long queue we encountered was in Jelawat! We arrived at my mother-in-law’s house in Bukit Marak at about 1.30pm. My wife’s siblings were already there the day before except for Puteri Azlian who celebrates her first 3 days of Eid in Kuala Kelawang, Negeri Sembilan. She joined us in Kelantan in the evening of the 3rd Eid.\n\nHere I would like to share several pictures taken during the Hari Raya celebrations in Kelantan. First day pictures, family dinner on the 2nd day – sponsored by Ayah Ngah, Ayah Su’s open house and visiting distant relatives on the 3rd day and of course, the Megat Ramli’s Family Photo-Shoot on the 4th day.\n\nWe intend to go to Perak on Wednesday but due to my laziness – I extended one more day in Kelantan. On Thursday, as we plan to make our move at about 3pm, my wife convinced me that we would waste one whole day traveling today. She suggested that we travel at about 4am the following morning and I agreed. But, at about 6pm, I just realized that if I were to travel tomorrow morning and spend the night in Perak, I will be traveling to KL on Saturday. On Sunday, we had to wake up early as Ayah Ngah called for a meeting to discuss the itinerary of his daughter’s wedding. So, it came to my mind that if I were to travel the following morning, I won’t have a full-day’s rest as I start working on Monday.\n\nReluctantly, we began our journey to Perak on Thursday night departing from Bukit Marak at about 9.30pm. Traffic was again smooth. We reached Kuala Kangsar at about 1am and spent the night there. We were told that Yong arrived in KL at about 2am that day (she began her journey from Bukit Marak at about 2pm). In Perak, we visited our relatives in Kota Lama and Bukit Chandan before making our way to Beruas. In Beruas, we visited my late mother’s, grandmother’s and uncle’s grave. After the cemetery, we visited my aunt Enda Wan Mazenah and later her eldest sister – Wan Nyah.\n\nOn our way back to KL, we’ve decided to take the coastal road via Kuala Selangor. Traffic was once again, smooth. When we reached Kuala Selangor, it was about 9pm and we’ve decided to have our dinner at the Muara Seafood Restaurant in Port Klang. After dinner, we head back to Putrajaya. That was our Hari Raya trip for 2010.\n\nFor those of you out there who are not familiar with the Perak titles, the Orang Kaya Temenggong Paduka Raja is one of the Orang Besar Empat. Originally, the office of Temenggong was bestowed upon the descendants of Tun Undan – son of Tun Saban. The earliest recorded Temenggong of Perak was one Tun Bantan who is also known as Toh Fajar. He is the son of one Tun Abdul Kahar who was granted the title Toh Permai Diwangsa. This Tun Abdul Kahar is the son of Tun Pasak Jalak – son of Tun Undan mentioned earlier. This Tun Pasak Jalak is said to be the acting ruler of Perak during the Acheh invasion in 1619. However, I can’t find any historical documents to support this claim.\n\nIf this is true, then it was Tun Pasak Jalak who instructed the remaining chiefs of Perak to find the heir to the Perak throne so that person can be installed as the new Sultan of Perak. The Seri Nara Diraja went to Johor to bring back Raja Mansur, son of Raja Inu (Raja Kecil Lasa) who is also the fiance’ to Puteri Limau Purut – daughter to the captured Sultan of Perak – Sultan Mukaddam Shah. To make matters worse, Raja Mansur’s fiance’ was amongst those who were captured by Acheh. Besides the Seri Nara Diraja, the Seri Maharaja Lela was also instructed by Tun Pasak Jalak the Acting Ruler of Perak but this time, to Acheh – hoping for the Sultan of Acheh to release one of the Royal Perak captives to be installed as the new Sultan of Perak. To know the rest of the story, one can easily search the internet as the story will deviate us further from our topic – about the Orang Kaya Temenggong of Perak.\n\nOver the years, the Temenggongship then was granted to the Megats. One known Megat who was appointed a Temenggong was Megat Mutabar – son of Bendahara Megat Pendia (Bendahara Hilang di Padang). This Megat Mutabar was later promoted to the title Orang Kaya Besar Maharaja Diraja. Some years later, we have one Ishak who was also known as Toh Pasai Acheh appointed as the Orang Kaya Temenggong. Not much is known about this Toh Pasai Acheh’s genealogy. From his personal title, it suggests an Acheh origin and perhaps some Pasai origin too. Wherever he was from, this Temenggong had a son named Mustafa who in turn became the Temenggong of Perak.\n\nThis Mustafa was married to one Sharifah Lipat. From this union, they had several children – Wan Emas, Meor Shuib, Meor Johar, Wan Chik Uteh and Wan Chik Chu. Meor Shuib succeeded his father as the Temenggong and Meor Johar was granted the title Toh Paduka Raja. Their eldest – Wan Emas was married to one Syed Muhammad – son of Syed Hitam Besar and Puteri Long Jelusul. This Puteri Long Jelusul is a daughter of Orang Kaya Besar Megat Mentaha Lambat Makan and Puteri Hitam Sayong. This Puteri Hitam Sayong is a daughter of Megat Mutabar – the former Temenggong mentioned earlier. So, in other words, Wan Emas is married to the great-grand daughter of Temenggong Megat Mutabar.\n\nAfter Temenggong Meor Shuib, there’s no record about any appointments to the office. But, after the war against the Siamese (Kedah/Ligor), the Sultan of Perak then granted the office of Temenggong to the Bugis warrior Anjang Talib. This Anjang Talib is a descendant of the famous Bugis warrior-prince who came to Perak and was appointed the Mufti and Orang Kaya-Kaya Maharaja Lela Tan Jana Putera Pancung Tak Bertanya. It is from this lineage, the present-day Temenggongs are descended from.\n\nOrang Kaya Temenggong Paduka Raja: The Daeng Selili ‘Dynasty’\n\nAs mentioned earlier, Daeng Selili is a Bugis Prince who came to Perak and subsquently appointed by the Sultan of Perak as the state’s Mufti and as head of the Orang Besar Lapan with the title Orang Kaya-Kaya Maharaja Lela Tan Jana Putera Pancung Tak Bertanya. According to the official genealogical records, Daeng Selili is married to Raja Su – daughter of Yang Dipertuan Muda Mansur. However, a historian from the Daeng Selili Clan, claims that it was not Raja Su but one Raja Ngah. Whatever the real name of this female raja, she was indeed a daughter of Yang Dipertuan Muda Mansur – younger brother to Sultan Mahmud Iskandar Shah of Perak.\n\nFrom this union, Daeng Selili was blessed with several children namely – Long Siah, Daeng Usman, Daeng Tongkat, Daeng Anjang, Tok Nor Jelinsing and Tok Su Bakul. In this posting, I will only concentrate on the descendants relevant to the Orang Kaya Temenggong. Other branches of the family will be discussed in later postings. Daeng Usman – son of Daeng Selili was granted the title Seri Maharaja Lela. It should be highlighted here that the titles Orang Kaya-Kaya Maharaja Lela and Seri Maharaja Lela are two different titles. The former is the head of Orang Besar Lapan and the latter is the head of Orang Besar Enam Belas. As a rule of thumb, the one with the word ‘Seri’ is the junior title.\n\nThe Seri Maharaja Lela Daeng Usman was blessed with 8 children – Long Luya, Ngah Abdul Manan, Alang Maimunah, Andak Radziah, Che Mah Anjang, Uda Tahir, Nutin and Busu Ala. The eldest – Long Luya was firstly married to Megat Abu Kassim – the last Orang Kaya Bendahara of Perak before the Bendaharaship was made a Royal Title. This Bendahara Megat Abu Kassim is alson known as Bendahara Hilang Di Teluk. From this union, they were blessed with a son named Megat Mansur who was granted the title Seri Maharaja. Later on, this Megat Mansur was appointed as Orang Kaya Besar – hence, the people would refer to him as Orang Kaya Besar Seri Maharaja.\n\nAfter the death of Bendahara Megat Abu Kassim, Long Luya later married to another Megat who himself an heir to the Perak Bendaharaship. His name is Megat Mentaha who was widely known as Megat Lambat Makan. This Megat Mentaha held the title Orang Kaya Besar Maharaja Diraja. From this union with Megat Mentaha, Long Luya was blessed with three children – Megat Zainal, Megat Ahmad and Puteri Terai. Megat Zainal was later appointed as Toh Muda Orang Kaya Besar. Megat Ahmad was given the title Toh Raja Amat Bongsu. As for Puteri Terai, she was given the title Toh Tun Busu. The rest of Long Luya’s descendants shall be discussed later under the topic of Megat Terawis Clan.\n\nAlang Maimunah – daughter of Daeng Usman was married to one Kanda Adam. This couple is the common ancestor of one of the sub-branch for the hereditary office of Orang Kaya Besar Maharaja Diraja. The present Orang Kaya Besar – Dato’ Abdul Rahman Bin Zainuddin hails from this branch. Next, Che Mah Anjang – another daughter of Daeng Usman was married to Raja Chulan Bin Raja Abdul Hamid – the author of Misa Melayu. This Raja Chulan was the Raja Muda of Perak and when he died, he was post-humously given the title Marhum Pulau Juar. From this union, they were blessed with 3 children – Raja Long Irang, Raja Kassim and Raja Chu.\n\nRaja Long Irang was also known within the family circle as Raja Jumat. This Raja Long Irang married one Raja Abdul Rahim – son of Raja Bendahara Inu (Marhum Tengah). According to Maxwell 24, this couple had a child. One day, their maid / the child’s nanny was careless which led to the child crying in pain. Raja Abdul Rahim – the father to the child took out his keris and stabbed the nanny. Unfortunately, the keris stab passed through the nanny’s body and accidentally injured the child. Both the nanny and the child died instantly. Raja Long Irang was stunned with the incident which happened in front of her very eyes. Raja Abdul Rahim then ran amok and killed Raja Long Irang and several other villagers nearby. This incident was reported to the Raja Bendahara – father to Raja Abdul Rahim. The Raja Bendahara ordered his men to capture Raja Abdul Rahim and once captured, the Raja Bendahara executed his son with his own keris. What a tragic ending…\n\nRaja Kassim – son of Raja Muda Chulan mentioned earlier was married to Raja Andak – daughter of Sultan Ahmaddin Shah of Perak. From this union, they were blessed with a daughter named Raja Noteh Mai Salamah. This Raja Noteh Mai Salamah then married Raja Chulan who later ascended the Perak Throne as Sultan Shahabuddin Shah. This couple were childless for quite sometime which resulted the couple to adopt their nephew (Raja Andak’s sister’s child). This adopted son was Raja Ismail Itam. This Raja Ismail Itam will later ascend the Perak Throne as Sultan Ismail Muabiddin Riayat Shah. A few years later, Raja Noteh and Raja Chulan (Sultan Shahabuddin) were blessed with one son – named Raja Ngah Ali – who will later ascend the Perak Throne as Sultan Ali Al-Mukammal Inayat Shah. After the death of Sultan Shahabuddin, Raja Noteh later married Raja Ngah Putra – son of Raja Bendahara Radin. From this union, they were blessed with two children – Raja Tipah and Raja Hussain. This Raja Tipah will later marry Raja Abdullah (later became Sultan Abdullah Muhammad Shah II). She is the mother of Raja Mansur and Raja Sir Chulan.\n\nThe youngest child of Raja Muda Chulan and Che Mah Anjang was Raja Chu. This Raja Chu was married to Raja Radin who later became the Raja Muda of Perak. This Raja Radin died in office and was post-humously given the title Marhum Shahidallah. This couple were blessed with two children – Raja Omar and Raja Busu. Raja Omar was known post-humously as Marhum Salleh. Raja Busu later married Raja Yusuf. This Raja Yusuf will later be granted the title Raja Kecil Tengah. For the details of this family’s lineage, one should consult the Royal Perak section.\n\nUda Tahir – another son of Seri Maharaja Lela Daeng Usman, inherited his father’s title of Seri Maharaja Lela. It is from this individual that the present-day Temenggongs are descended from. The details of this lineage will be published in the second part of this article. So, stay tuned.\n\nFirstly, I must admit that I am new to golf. Last Sunday (20th of June 2010), my batch mates from STAR organised a golfing session at Sime Darby’s Carey Islands Golf Course. Credit should be given to Sdr Opec for hosting the event. Initially, 8 people confirmed to join but towards the 20th of June, we had two casualties. The first was acceptable as our friend was invited to attend his cousin’s wedding (family comes first right?). But, in the early hours of 20th June – 4.30 am to be exact, we had one ‘hamba Allah’ messaging the whole group saying that he just came back from site visit and he might not make it as we intend to tee-off at 8.30am sharp. We were still wondering – which ‘site’ did he visited….\n\nAnyway, after Subuh prayers, I drove to Telok Panglima Garang via Jenjarom to have breakfast with Sdr Tonggek. Then, about 8.20am, Opec, Efi and Bodent arrived at the meeting point. Opec leads the way to the club and to my surprise, it was quite a loooooong journey through the plantation estates. Shortly, after arrival, we saw Balau arriving in his black Vios.\n\nAll set, flights were divided, Yellow House and the Rest of The World. Opec (White), Tonggek (Blue) and myself (Green) in the first flight and the Yellow Dragons – Efi, Bodent and Balau in the 2nd flight. We were too ambitious to complete 18 holes on that day as the weather turned out to be TOO SUNNY! Most of us (I think it is safe to say all of us) were dehydrated as early as the 3rd hole! After completing the 5th hole, there was a hut for the golfers to freshen up. We took the opportunity to rest under the hut – away from the burning sun whilst waiting the flight from Yellow House to complete the 5th hole. Balau and Efi – both are seasoned golfers, showed a nice example to us how a shot is taken. It was indeed beautiful!\n\nAnother 4 holes to go, we decided to combine flights (although it’s against the golfing etiquette). It was at the 7th hole that we were entertained by Balau’s splendid chip-in. At this stage, most of us are hoping to end the session as soon as possible. It’ a no-no to play 18 holes for the day. At the last hole, all of us performed well – especially Bodent. As for me, I too had my personal best score at the last hole. I managed to get a bogey. For Bodent – who is a beginner (a real beginner with no driving range experience), for a Par 4, he was already on the green after the 2nd shot. Unfortunately, he missed the birdie putt but managed end the game with a par! Congrats to Bodent….\n\nAlthough we played only 9 holes, with burning sun, it is still worth it. There’s always a first time for everyone. One would not learn without doing mistakes. It’s what one learns from one’s mistakes that determines the improvement of one’s game in the future. After the game, we had lunch at Nasi Padang Restaurant at Teluk Panglima Garang.\n\nWe adjourned at about 3pm. We are looking forward to our next golfing session – don’t know where, and when. Our dear friend who’s working in Kerteh, Terengganu is willing to be the host (I was told). We’ll see how it goes. All in all, it was a good father’s day outing.\n\nPhotos by Mohd Farid Abu Bakar\n\nThis would be my first posting under the Arts Appreciation category and this entry is about a movie I went to last night with my wife. According to my wife, this film is based on a best-selling novel way-back in the 1990s. In general, just like any other films which were based on novels, they lack the details. I won’t go further in commenting the lack of details as I haven’t read the book myself. What I am going to comment is about the movie itself – or to be exact, what flaws occurred in the movie.\n\nLegenda or Lagenda?\n\nOfficially, the movie’s spelling is Lagenda. However, if I’m not mistaken, according to DBP, the correct spelling is legenda. The producers of movies should check the proper spellings with DBP as mispelling in our own language is equivalent to an insult to the language itself!\n\nThe role of a Vice-Chancellor\n\nIn the movie, there’s a scene about Kasyah being called by one college officer reminding him to behave. In that scene, the officer gave a letter of warning in relation to Kasyah’s behaviour. Surprisingly, the officer said “…saya sebagai Naib Canselor…” Does the film-maker know what’s the level of a Naib Canselor? The VC or NC is THE BOSS for the whole university – like the CEO. It is not logical for such a senior person to pass a warning letter to a student. Unless he has no other job in the office and passing a warning letter to one particular student would make him look very busy.\n\nAddressing a Lecturer\n\nThere’s a scene where a nerd girl went to the library to bring a book entitled ‘International Marketing’ for her lecturer. When the lecturer enters the lecture hall and about to begin the class, the students greeted him (like a high school student greeting a teacher) and addressed the lecturer with the title ‘Cikgu’. As far as I know, the title Cikgu was never accorded for a lecturer. Did the film-maker ever attended tertiary education!?\n\nKampung Trip: Battery Supply\n\nOk, Kasyah is on a Kampung Trip where the village has no electricity, no internet – no civilisation. Just wondering, how can he charge his Digital Camera battery in a place with no electricity!? Did he bring LOTS OF BATTERIES? I don’t think so – not practical.\n\nProfessional Photographer’s image\n\nKasyah is said to be a professional photographer. But, in my opnion, at least show him using a different set of lenses because a professional photographer normally has more than one and these lenses are longer than the basic one. Maybe shooting a scene to show this professional image of him as a photographer might be too redundant to the film-maker.\n\nAyu’s Mother\n\nWhat kind of a mother is she? She listens to her ex-son-in-law? And then what happened? Her daughter lost her memory. Not logical for a mother to believe in her ex-son-in-law than her own daughter.\n\nWhere’s the Iqamah?\n\nWhen Ayu delivered her child, the scene showed a nurse calling Kasyah to meet for the first time his daughter. In Islam, a new born should be greeted with an Azan or an Iqamah for boy or girl respectively. To my shocking, Kaysah did not recited the Iqamah for his daughter at all. Either the movie makers are ignorant about the Islamic custom in reciting Azans and Iqamah for newly-borns or they purposely potray Kasyah as a non-practicing Muslim?\n\nMy overall rating out of 5 is 2.5. Let’s see what will the film-maker be doing for the second part of this movie.\n\nThe title Laksamana is basically the Malay equivalent of an Admiral. Since the glory days of the Sultanate of Melaka, the Laksamana played an important role in the government. In Melaka, the Laksamana is one of the Orang Besar Empat and one of the famous Melakan Laksamana was none other than the legendary Silat Master – Hang Tuah. We know that Perak inherits its government system from Melaka and indeed the titles of Orang Besar Empat, Orang Besar Lapan, Orang Besar Enam Belas and Orang Besar Tiga Puluh Dua were created similar to the structure used in Melaka. However, the Laksamana in Perak was placed as a member of the Orang Besar Lapan as opposed to Orang Besar Empat during the Melakan days.\n\nThe full title of the Laksamana in Perak is Orang Kaya-Kaya Laksamana Raja Mahkota. According to MS 40332 – Miscellaneous Papers kept at the School of Oriental & African Studies and later further elaborated by Wilkinson and Winstedt, the forefather of the Perak Laksamana was a Bugis Prince known as Nakhoda Hitam. In some records, he was alson known as Nakhod Hitam Toh Kuala Bidor. According to a genealogist from the Daeng Selili clan, this Nakhoda Hitam is said to be a younger brother of Daeng Selili.\n\nOne Megat Halim Azizi Bin Megat Noh – a descendant of Daeng Selili himself, quoted from Silsilah Wajo and Lontarak Sukunna Wajo that Nakhoda Hitam was a step-brother of Daeng Selili. It is said that the mother of Nakhoda Hitam was one We Camba – a raja from Camba (nearby the province of Wajo and Bone). Whatever the origin of this Nakhoda Hitam, in Perak History, he is considered as the forefather to the title holders of the Laksamana of Perak.\n\nNakhoda Hitam had two wives – Toh Epok and Puteri Puasa (a daughter of a Megat, but her ancestry is not known). Nakhoda Hitam was succeeded as Laksamana by his son Toh Chik (unfortunately, we don’t know Toh Chik’s real name). When Toh Chik died, he had one issue – Toh Rejab. Since Toh Rejab was very young during the death of Laksamana Toh Chik, the office of Laksamana was passed on to Nakhoda Hitam’s son-in-law – Toh Jambu who was also known as Keramat Tanjung Medan. Not long after taking office, Toh Jambu died and was succeeded by another son-in-law of Nakhoda Hitam – Tun Abu Esama.\n\nLater, when Laksamana Tun Abu Esama died, he was succeded by the son of Laksamana Toh Chik – Toh Rejab. When Laksamana Toh Rejab died, he was succeeded by Toh Bongkok Lahab – son of Laksamana Tun Abu Esama. Laksamana Toh Bongkok Lahab had daughter named Long Telar. This Long Telar later married to Wan Abdul Rahman (Toh Muda Laksamana), son of Maharaja Lela Ngah Hassan. From this union, they were blessed with a daughter named Wan Ngah Mahtra.\n\nAs for Laksamana Toh Jambu, he had three children – Ngah Hassan, Che Uda Kechil Terkukor and Che Puteh. Ngah Hassan later became the Orang Kaya-Kaya Maharaja Lela Tanjana Putera Pancung Tak Bertanya – commonly known as the Maharaja Lela. We know that the title of Maharaja Lela is bestowed upon descendants of the Bugis Prince – Daeng Selili. Since Nakhoda Hitam is said to be a younger brother of Daeng Selili, then the appointment of Ngah Hassan as Maharaja Lela is justified as he belongs to the same clan as other Maharaja Lelas. His son – Wan Abdul Rahman married to Long Telar, daughter of Laksmaana Toh Bongkok Lahab as mentioned earlier.\n\nAnother son of Laksmana Toh Jambu is Che Uda Kechil Terkukor. His name suggests that during his childhood, he suffered an accident – ‘terkukor’ which resulted him to be physically handicapped. Che Uda had two sons – Alang Muhammad and Tok Chu Abdul Rahim. Alang Muhammad had an issue – Che Alang Abdul Wakaf who is also known as Alang Duakap. As for Tok Chu Abdul Rahim, he had 2 sons – Muhammad Salleh and Muhammad Taha; and one daughter named Ngah Majnun. The youngest child of Laksamana Tok Jambu is Che Puteh and this Che Puteh married the 18th Sultan of Perak – Sultan Ahmaddin Shah Ibni Almarhum Sultan Muhammad Shah. From this union, one Raja Abdul Malik was born. This Raja Abdul Malik will later be the 19th Sultan of Perak reigning as Sultan Abdul Malik Mansur Shah Ibni Almarhum Sultan Ahmaddin Shah.\n\nWhen Laksamana Toh Bongkok Lahab died, he was succeded by Toh Janggut – a son of the late Laksamana Toh Rejab. This Laksamana Toh Janggut is married to Ngah Majnun – daughter of Toh Chu Abdul Rahim mentioned earlier. When Laksamana Toh Janggut died, the office of Laksamana was passed to the son-in-law of Toh Muda Wan Abdul Rahman i.e the husband to Wan Ngah Mahtra mentioned earlier. This new Laksamana’s name is Pandak Ibrahim. Later, Pandak Ibrahim was succeeded as Laksamana by Hj Sulaiman – son of Muammad Taha Bin Toh Chu Abdul Rahim. Wan Ngah Mahtra later married to Raja Ngah Jaafar (who later became the Sultan of Perak reigning as Sultan Jaafar Muazzam Shah). From this union, they were blessed with two children – Raja Nandak and Raja Abdullah. This Raja Abdullah later became the Sultan of Perak reigning as Sultan Abdullah Muhammad Shah II. After the Perak War, this Sultan Abdullah was banished to the Seychelles. The Sultan’s mother – Wan Ngah Mahtra accompanied him to the Seychelles.\n\nWhen Laksamana Hj Sulaiman died, he was succeeded by Muhammad Amin – son of Alang Abdul Wakaf bin Alang Muhammad Bin Che Uda Kechil Terkukor. During this time, the late Laksamana Hj Sulaiman’s cousin was made the Raja Mahkota – an Orang Besar Enam Belas and heir to the Laksamana. This new Raja Mahkota was Hj Hussain. Laksamana Muhammad Amin had several children. A daughter of his – Halimah married the mining tycoon Orang Kaya Menteri Ngah Ibrahim Bin Long Jaafar. Another daughter of his – Hjh Mariam was married to the Orang Kaya-Kaya Shahbandar Uda Maamor. Laksamana Muhamad Amin had issue several sons namely Muhammad Arshad, Hj Muhammad Noh and Muhammad Ali Akbar.\n\nAfter the Perak War, the British banished the Sultan Ismail to Johor, and Sultan Abdullah, Laksamana Muhammad Amin, Shahbandar Uda Maamor and Menteri Ngah Ibrahim to the Seychelles. After the banishment of Laksamana Muhammad Amin, the Raja Mahkota – Hj Hussain was made Laksamana by the British. The eldest son of Laksamana Muhammad Amin, Muhammad Arshad was made Toh Muda. This Muhammad Arshad is commonly known to the British as Orang Kaya Mat Arshad.\n\nAfter the death of Laksamana Hussain (who died and burried in Ipoh), Orang Kaya Mat Arshad succeded him as the new Laksamana. However, Laksamana Mat Arshad’s term in office was not that long. He died in the mid 1920s and was succeeded by his son Muhammad Ali Wasi. Later, upon the death of Laksamana Ali Wasi, he was succeded by his cousin – Che Lope Bahauddin Bin Hj Muhammad Noh. This Laksamana Lope Bahauddin is married to the eldest child of Tengku Menteri Wan Muhammad Isa – Wan Aishah. Unfortunately, they had no issue.\n\nThe Laksamana Lope Bahauddin died on 4th December 1947 and was burried at Masjid Lama, Taiping, Perak. He was succeded as Laksamana by the son of Laksamana Ali Wasi – Dato’ Seri Mohd Razalli (former Menteri Besar of Perlis). The Toh Muda during Dato’ Laksamana Razalli’s term in office was Dato’ Muhammad Ali Akbar – the youngest son of the banished Laksamana Muhammad Amin. According to his personal documents, Ali Akbar was born in 1900 in Singapore and Laksamana Muhammad Amin died in Singapore in the year 1908.\n\nDato’ Seri Laksamana Mohd Razalli died in 1981 and was burried at Masjid Laksamana, Batak Rabit, Teluk Intan. He was succeeded by Dato’ Muhammad Ali Akbar as Laksamana. The late Laksamana Razalli’s son was made the Toh Muda and this Toh Muda’s name is Mohd Hamidi. In 1993, Dato’ Muhammad Ali Akbar died and was burried at Masjid Lama Taiping, Perak. He was succeded by Dato’ Seri Mohd Hamidi as Laksamana. Dato’ Ali Akbar’s son – Muhammad Amin Shukeri was made the Toh Muda in 1993.\n\nHowever, in 1997, Laksamana Hamidi died and Toh Muda Amin Shukeri succeded him as the new Laksamana. Dato’ Seri Mohd Amin Shukeri is the present Orang Kaya-Kaya Laksamana Raja Mahkota of Perak. He is married to Datin Seri Wan Norniah Binti Dato’ Wan Salaiddin – a member of the Temenggong Clan of Perak. To date, there were two Toh Muda’s serving during Dato’ Seri Amin Shukeri’s term in office as Laksamana. Mohd Khairi Bin Ahmad Tazalli – nephew to Dato’ Seri Laksamana Razalli was made Toh Muda in 1997. However in 2010, following the death of Toh Muda Khairi in 2009, one Meor Redzuan Bin Mahayuddin was appointed as Toh Muda Laksamana. Unfortunately, I have no info on the ancestry of Toh Muda Meor Redzuan.\n\nThe holders of the title Seri Adika Raja are descendants of Tun Saban through his son – Tun Kelalang. Tun Kelalang had three sons – Toh Pasir Panjang, Toh Lintang and Toh Hilang di Pilih. Unfortunately, there’s no historical text that mention the real names of these three individuals.\n\nToh Pasir Panjang is the forefather of the Seri Narawangsa holders. The Seri Narawangsa is a senior title within the Perak Royal Court but declined over the years. But their descendants still exist till this very day. Through marriage, members of this lineage inherited the post of the Kinta Chief – the Orang Kaya-Kaya Panglima Kinta Seri Amar Bangsa Diraja. (a separate article shall be written about the lineage of Panglima Kinta)\n\nTun Kelalang’s second son – Toh Lintang had a son named Alang Idris. This Alang Idris was also known as Toh Jawang. This Toh Jawang Alang Idris was the first person to be appointed as the Seri Adika Raja of Perak.\n\nThe third son of Tun Kelalang was Toh Hilang di Pilih. This Toh Hilang di Pilih had four children – Toh Berolak, Toh Jabut, Toh Tupai of Bota and the wife of one Tun Pekerma. As for the last two, they are both females. According to Tun Hamzah’s version of the Seri Adika Raja Ancestry, Toh Berolak’s real name was Tun Abdullah and Toh Jabut’s real name was Tun Ismail. Tun Ismail became the first Shahbandar of Perak and the ancestor of present day Shahbandar holders.\n\nAs for Toh Berolak Tun Abdullah, he was appointed as the 2nd Seri Adika Raja succeeding Toh Jawang Alang Idris. The makam of Toh Jawang Alang Idris is in Chegar Galah. The Seri Adika Raja Toh Berolak had 2 sons and a daughter. The sons are Toh Lalang and Toh Senalu. The daughter of Toh Berolak is Che Tanjong who later married Orang Kaya Menteri Paduka Tuan Syed Shamsuddin Jamalullail.\n\nWhen Toh Berolak died, Toh Lalang became the 3rd Seri Adika Raja. Toh Senalu later succeeded his brother as the 4th Seri Adika Raja. The makams of both Toh Lalang and Toh Senalu are at Kampung Luat, Lenggong.\n\nToh Senalu had 4 sons – Toh Lambok Itam Petot, Toh Terosor, Toh Indera Bijaya and Toh Berjambul. Itam Petot succeded Toh Senalu as the 5th Seri Adika Raja. According to the RAS Journals, he had nine children and the youngest was one Busu Sega.\n\nUpon the death of Seri Adika Raja Toh Lambok Itam Petot, his younger brother – Toh Terosor was appointed as the 6th Seri Adika Raja. This Toh Terosor was married to one Che Kuman. From this union, they were blessed with 3 sons and two daughters. The eldest of the five was the daughter named Long Mariam. Long Mariam married Syed Mentaha Bin Syed Alang Muhammad Kecil of Jawang. This Syed Mentaha is the grandson of Orang Kaya Menteri Syed Shamsuddin and Che Tanjong mentioned earlier. The younger daughter of Toh Terosor – named Teh Kewi married to Syed Pandak Ahmad Jamalullail who was later appointed as Orang Kaya Besar Maharaja Diraja by Sultan Ismail Muabidin Riayat Shah (Sultan of Perak: 1871-1874)\n\nThe sons of Toh Terosor are Alang Juah, Abdul Ghani and Hj Harun. Alang Juah succeeded Toh Terosor as the 7th Seri Adika Raja. Alang Juah married Siti Hawa Binti Syed Alang Muhammad Kecil of Jawang – younger sister of Syed Mentaha mentioned earlier. From this union, they had two children – Meor Abdullah. The third child of Toh Terosor – Abdul Ghani was bestowed the title of Toh Shahbandar Ulu.\n\nThe Seri Adika Raja Alang Juah died while performing the Haj Pilgrimage and was post-humously titled Alang Juah Hilang di Mekah. He was succeeded by his son – Meor Abdullah who was also known as Toh Changkat as the 8th Seri Adika Raja. Toh Changkat Meor Abdullah was married to Che Jura Binti Kanda Abdul Majid. Che Jura is the daughter of Orang Kaya Besar Maharaja Diraja Kanda Abdul Majid – immediate predecessor to Orang Kaya Besar Syed Pandak Ahmad Jamalullail mentioned earlier. From the union between Meor Abdullah and Che Jura, they were blessed with 11 children namely:\n\nLong Tijah\n\nYong Kebun\n\nMeor Abdul Raof\n\nMeor Alang Abbas\n\nMeor Ahmad\n\nMeor Tarom\n\nAlang Meriah\n\nChe Itam\n\nHjh Ensah\n\nMeor Pandak Zainal\n\nBusu Atikah\n\nThe exact date of death for Seri Adika Raja Meor Abdullah is not known – whether he died during the reign of Sultan Ali or Sultan Jaafar. Historical records have shown that during the funeral of Sultan Ali in 1871, Meor Abdullah’s eldest son was already the Toh Muda Seri Adika Raja. Historical records too have shown that Meor Abdullah was succeeded by Busu Sega (son of Seri Adika Raja Itam Petot) as the 9th Seri Adika Raja.\n\nThis Seri Adika Raja Busu Sega was later killed by the British during the Perak War. When Sultan Ismail fled to Upper Perak, Seri Adika Raja Busu Sega was the one responsible for the Sultan’s safety as Upper Perak is the Seri Adika Raja’s territory. A group of Malays hired by the British were sent to hunt-down Sultan Ismail. Since the Seri Adika Raja was too powerful and command the locals there, the locals were reluctant to help the British-hired Malays. One day, at about Asar, while the Seri Adika Raja Busu Sega was relaxing in front of his house in Batu Berdinding, he was shot dead by the British-hired Malays. Hence, Busu Sega was styled post-humously as Seri Adika Raja Toh Shahid Busu Sega.\n\nHistorical records have shown that after the death of Seri Adika Raja Busu Sega, the Toh Muda Meor Abdul Raof was not appointed as Seri Adika Raja. The successor to Busu Sega was appointed only in the 1880s (a period of almost 10 years) and the successor was not Meor Abdul Raof but his nephew – Wan Muhammad Salleh Bin Wan Abu Bakar. Wan Muhammad Salleh is a son of Toh Muda Meor Abdul Raof’s youngest sister – Busu Atikah. This Wan Muhamad Salleh became so popular and he became the first Malay to receive the Imperial Service Order (I.S.O.). The next Malay to receive the I.S.O. was the Tengku Menteri Wan Muhammad Isa Bin Ngah Ibrahim. As the 10th Seri Adika Raja, he played an important role in the government. He was one of the pioneer members of the Federal Council (after the formation of the Federated Malay States 1897). He went to the United Kingdom accompanying Sultan Idris Shah for the coronation of King Edward VII in 1902 and King George V in 1911. He died while accompanying Sultan Abdul Jalil visiting the tomb of Sultan Tajul Arifin in Pulau Semat following the Sultan’s Installation in 1917. His body was laid to rest in the compound of Masjid Paloh, Jalan Dato’, Ipoh.\n\nDuring his lifetime, Wan Muhammad Salleh had 3 wives – one Toh Puan Sharifah Rodziah Binti Alang Duakap (half-sister to Laksamana Muhammad Amin), Wan Teh Rafeah Binti Wan Abbas (niece to Temenggong Wan Hussain) and Teh Sariah (daughter of his cousin – Meor Yeop Mohd Jawi bin Meor Alang Abbas). Wan Muhammad Salleh was succeeded by his cousin cum father-in-law – Meor Yeop Mohd Jawi as the 11th Seri Adika Raja. Not much is known about this Seri Adika Raja (perhaps if there are readers from his family could enlighten us with his story).\n\nLater, upon the death of Meor Yeop Mohd Jawi, he was succeeded by his nephew’s son – Meor Yahya Bin Ngah Muhammad Amin as the 12th Seri Adika Raja. This Meor Yahya is the grandson of Long Tijah – eldest child of Seri Adika Raja Toh Changkat Meor Abdullah. Seri Adika Raja Meor Yahya was the founder of Maahad Yahyawiyah in Padang Rengas, Kuala Kangsar. He was also the main contributor to the construction of Masjid Ubudiah Lenggong. He was laid to rest in the compounds of Masjid Ubudiah Lenggong.\n\nUpon the death of Seri Adika Raja Meor Yahya, he was succeeded by Wan Mohamad Ali Bin Wan Omar (nephew to Seri Adika Raja Wan Muhammad Salleh) as the 13th Seri Adika Raja. Not much is known about Wan Mohamad Ali. One of his daughters – Wan Fatimah, later married the Orang Kaya-Kaya Setia Bijaya Diraja Abdul Wahab. He died in 1950 on the same day as the death of Laksamana Lope Bahauddin. The Laksamana was laid to rest in Taiping and Wan Mohamad Ali was laid to rest in Bukit Chandan.\n\nWan Mohamad Ali was succeeded by Meor Abdullah (son of Seri Adika Raja Meor Yeop Mohd Jawi) as the 14th Seri Adika Raja. As his Toh Muda, Meor Shamsuddin Bin Meor Yahya was appointed. This Meor Shamsuddin is the co-author of the Sejarah Hulu Perak. Unfortunately, Meor Shamsuddin died while in office and was replaced by the grandson of Meor Yang Hashim (younger brother to Seri Adika Raja Meor Yeop Mohd Jawi) – Meor Sulaiman Bin Meor Abdul Rahman as Toh Muda).\n\nIn 1984 (i think?), the Seri Adika Raja Meor Abdullah died. He was succeeded by Meor Ahmad Rashidi Bin Meor Burhanuddin (a nephew to the late Toh Muda Meor Shamsuddin) as the 15th Seri Adika Raja. As for the Toh Muda post, Meor Sulaiman remained as Toh Muda until his death in 2002. Following the death of Toh Muda Meor Sulaiman, the post of Toh Muda was filled by Dato’ Ir Mohamad Othman Bin Zainal Azim. This new Toh Muda’s father – Zainal Azim Bin Ahmad is a grandson of Seri Adika Raja Meor Yeop Mohd Jawi through his daughter (Yang Atikah).\n\nIn February 2011, the Seri Adika Raja Dato’ Seri Meor Ahmad Rashidi passed away. Pending appointment by the Sultan and the Dewan Negara of Perak, it is safe to assume that the present Toh Muda shall be promoted to the vacant post of Seri Adika Raja and one of the many eligible candidates amongst the Seri Adika Raja clan shall be appointed to the Toh Muda post in due course."
