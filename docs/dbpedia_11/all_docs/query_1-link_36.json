        "text": "Dawn rose on Sultan Muhammad Shah II Muzaffarid of Gujarat after a sleepless night. His Kingdom, such as it was, consisted of several territories in north western India, but his situation was somewhat precarious. Whilst he had a loyal vassal in Kandesh, he had many rivals in Vijayanagar, Malwa and the Bahmanis, all of whom were considered to be more powerful than him. He would surely need allies to survive the coming years, as his rivals would be inclined to declare war on him if an opportunity presented itself. The surrounding tribes offered many chances for both alliances and conquest alike, but Muhammad would need to choose his allies, and his moments, carefully. The Kingdom of Gujarat could claim rightful ownership of provinces now owned by Mewar and Kutch, whilst the princedom of Palitana seemed like a tempting target for Gujarat to expand into, so spies were dispatched to forge claims on the province. Muhammad also sent his diplomats west to the Sultanate in Sindh, hoping that his proposals for an alliance would be accepted, he was relieved to receive a swift reply from Sindh accepting his offer.\n\nStill feeling uneasy at his situation - militarily Gujarat was still inferior to its rivals, Muhammad continued to search for allies. The kingdoms of Multan and Jaunpur were both of comparable size to Gujarat, so fresh from their journeys to Sindh, diplomats were once more dispatched to improve relations with both kingdoms. With no further diplomats in court, the Sultan was able to take a moment to look at his own kingdom. His merchant divisions had already been sent away to Coromandel, Deccan and Punjab, with instructions to steer money to Gujarat. The merchants were contributing a significant amount of money to the income of the kingdom, money which could be used to fund an army. The Sultan had an army of 10,000 men, which was enough to take on the tribes and princedoms surrounding Gujarat, but no match for the southern neighbours in Vijayanagar and Bahmanis. Fresh from ordering the recruitment of 3,000 new soldiers, Muhammad returned to court and noticed the man waiting there, he approached with trepidation, fearing a declaration of war from the east or the south. Far from it, however, as the diplomat introduced himself as being from Porbandar on the western coast, the man came offering an alliance, which the Sultan accepted on the spot.\n\nWith his diplomatic power base growing, Muhammad continued to look inwards at his land. He had noticed the missionaries in his court and had wondered what to do with them for several days now, he decided to take an afternoon wandering around his state capital to decide if he was going to act upon the religious differences in his country. Whilst the Sultan himself practiced the Sunni faith, there seemed to be a vast percentage of the populace who practiced Hinduism. Fearing an uprising if he tried to spread the word of Islam around Gujarat, the sultan decided that for now, the best place for the imams and scholars gathered in his court would be within the palace.\n\nThe Sultan went to bed that night feeling had had done much for the populace of Gujarat, but still feeling like there was still much to do to secure the future of his kingdom. In his prayers that night, he wished for the strength to continue to do all he could to outlast his foes. As always he emerged in court the following morning hoping for as little to deal with as possible, and to carry on ruling as he saw fit. The first people to enter court that morning were a man and a woman, the man bearing an offer from the Sultan of Sindh, offering a wife, Noor Samna, for Muhammad. The Sultan had been unmarried since the death of his previous wife, and saw now as an ideal time to accept the marriage to Noor, further improving relations with Sindh in the process. He was also pleased to receive two friendly diplomats from his allies in Kandesh and Pobandar, both of whom offered Royal Marriages to courtiers in Gujarat.\n\nThe feeling of security in his newfound partners, and alliances, was tempered by news brought by Gujarati scouts from further south. Bahmani soldiers had been spotted advancing towards the Gujarati border, with a numerically superior force to their own. To make matters worse, the news from Vijayanagar was little better, with the news that Vijayanagar was influencing their neighbours in Andhra and Jaffna to their way of thinking. With two of his rivals exercising their powers, the Sultan decided to seek one more alliance to deter the attackers. Thanks to the work of his diplomats, the kingdoms of Multan and Jaunpur would both accept an alliance. Looking at potential military targets before deciding which of these two kingdoms he would ally, Muhammad was dismayed to see that Palitana had allied Mewar, and feared that an attack on this tribe would draw in a larger power he could ill afford to deal with. Of the neighbouring tribes, it was Idar who seemed to have the weakest alliances for the time being, as they were only allied to the tribe of Khandesh. Not wishing to war with Mewar, the Sultan recalled his spies from Palitana and sent them away to Kutch, in the hope of being able to lay a claim to more than just the province of Kutch itself, which had once belonged to Gujarat. News that Bahmani troops were leaving the Gujarati border eased the Sultans mind, with an attack feeling less imminent, the Sultan left the palace that evening and went for a walk around Ahmedabad, watching the sun setting over the ocean before retiring to bed.\n\nHe awoke the following morning to news that Multan was preparing to attack Kashmir, and that this was common knowledge around north India due to the loose lips of the Multani leadership. Muhammad had still not made a decision over whether to ally Multan or Jaunpur, but his hand was now somewhat forced. He had no desire to waste resources fighting Kashmir, so the alliance offer was sent to Jaunpur, which was soon accepted. With little more the Sultan could do to secure more defensive alliances, he now pondered how best to go on the attack. Before retiring for the night, the Sultan learned that Idar were now claiming themselves to be the rightful owners of the Gujarati province of Patan. This amused the Sultan no end, as surely the Idar tribe would not be foolish enough to attack a Gujarati army three times its size.\n\nMuhammad had more entertainment during the upcoming days, as neighbouring tribes continued to claim Gujarati land, Rewa Kantha claimed Baroda for themselves, and Jahlavad declared they were should rule the harbour of Khambat. Mercifully for the Sultan, the first diplomat bringing serious news to him was offering a marriage with a Jaunpuri noble, which the Sultan was happy to accept. He was just about to sit down to lunch with his courtiers when a messenger burst in with news that Vijayanagar had gone to war with Mysore, relieved that it was not Gujarat that had been the target, Muhammad carried on with his lunch, only to be interrupted again with news that the Bahmanis were also at war, this time with Chandar. Once again the Sultan sat relieved and continued with his lunch, only for a third messenger to bring news that Malwa had also gone to war, this time with Rewa Kantha. Thanking Allah for his good fortune, the Sultan was finally able to finish his lunch. A return to court that afternoon saw the unwelcome claim that the house of Muzaffarid, far from being from a long line of nobles, was in fact descended from a farm not too far from Baroda. As he had done all his life, Muhammad denied this fact. He was relieved to hear the news of Burhadan Quaid-e-Azam, who far from speaking out against Muhammad, as had been feared to be the case, was actually speaking positively about his ruler. The Sultan was grateful for this, and hoped it may continue.\n\nWith his rivals at war, Muhammad felt that his own troops would surely be spoiling for a battle themselves, but who would they attack? The answer was shortly presented in the form of a claim on the province of Mahikantha, giving Gujarat a reason to attack Idar. Idar had themselves declared a war on Rewa Kantha, and would surely be unprepared for the Gujarati attack.\n\nWith the only ally to Idar being the tribe of Baglana, Muhammad chose to promote a general for the army, Bhenji Haji, skilled in the art of combat, and issued a declaration of war on Idar. Idar would present little challenge to the Gujarati army, but the territory gained from the war would surely come in handy against would be attackers.\n\nThe Gujarati army advanced directly into Mahikantha, catching the outnumbered Idari force and wiping them out to a man. The Sultan wished he could be at the siege of Mahikantha, but had matters to deal with in court. A diplomat from Rewa Kantha was asking for military access, which the Sultan refused. He also noticed that Jahlavad had laid a claim to Ahmedabad, which again the Sultan dismissed as laughable, hopefully after he had dealt with Idar and opportunity would arise to attack Jahlavad. With his affairs in order in court, Muhammad turned again to the ongoing war. The defenders were beginning to desert from Mahikantha, but the army of Khandesh was struggling against Baglana. The defeat of the Khandeshi army was however tempered by news that the province of Mahikanthi had surrendered to Gujarat. The Sultan decided to take the attack to the armies of Baglana that had given Kandesh so much trouble, catching them at Baglana and dispensing them with ease. As it had done in Mahikantha, the Gujarati army began to occupy the province of Baglana, hoping to force a surrender.\n\nWith the war almost won, Muhammad turned his attention to his rivals once again. Bahmanis had won their war against Chandar, and Mewar had successfully conquered Rewa Kantha, but Vijayanagar had yet to defeat Mysore. Whilst he still feared an attack from Bahmanis, he was pleased with the work his spies had done in giving Gujarat cause to attack Idar. After congratulating them for their work, he sent them to Jahlavad to forge a claim for Gujarat.\n\nWith Idar and Baglana refusing to accept the surrender of Idar, the siege continued in Baglana. The Sultan had declared the war in March of 1447 hoping for a swift victory, yet his terms would still not be accepted in March of 1448. Another month went by, and with it came another declaration of war from Bahmanis, this time against Bastar. The Sultan was starting to get anxious, with Bahmanis on the attack like this, it would only be a matter of time before they would attack Gujarat. Muhammad was therefore most grateful to receive news of the surrender of Baglana to Gujarat. After they had proved such a thorn in his side for the past year, the Sultan decided to annex both provinces for Gujarat, sending his administrators into both provinces immediately to bring his rule. With the administrators sent away, the Muhammad now received two bickering merchant factions, and after listening to both men for a matter of minutes, decided it would not be worth getting involved in their squabble, and sent them away before retiring to his bedchamber for the night.\n\nThe Sultan awoke the following morning and went to court, seeing one of his spies eagerly awaiting with news that he had forged legitimate Gujarati claims on the provinces of Halar and Rajkot, that both belonged to Kutch. Muhammad congratulated the spy and sent him on his way, before receiving the news that Mysore had been conquered by Vijayanagar. Of interest to the Sultan was the news that Garha, a vassal of Mewar, was disloyal and gaining support for its independence from Bahmanis. Dismissing the news that Venad would attack Kochin in a war in the south west of India, Muhammad looked further to the defence of Gujarat, and was alarmed to see there were no forts in his country that would take as long to siege as the one in Baglana had taken. He began at once to take action to fortify Ahmedabad, and began a tour of Gujarat to see where a second fort might be built once the necessary funds were in place.\n\nTo the east of Gujarat, Bastar was firmly under control of the Bahmanis, which was causing neighbouring states to attack Bastar, including the state of Patna. Patna was the only ally of Jahlavad, something that Muhammad made sure he would keep an eye on, as once isolated, Jahlavad would surely fall. The current peace, however, would be used to restore the manpower of the Gujarati provinces, and continue with the construction of the fort in Ahmedabad. In addition, celebrations were planned for the completion of the newly added provinces of Mehikantha and Baglana, which took place all over Gujarat. The following day saw mixed fortune for the Sultan, with news that Palitana had allied Vijayanagar, in addition to its existing alliance with Mewar. Despite this disappointment, the Sultan was pleased to hear of a claim that had been made on Rewa Kantha by Gujarat. With Mewar at war with Malwa, the chance could arise for Gujarat to attack Palitana, or Mewar itself. Already Mewar was weakened to the point where it would not defend Junagarh, a princedom on the coast of Gujarat. Spies were diverted from Mewar to Junagarh in the hope of forging a claim and gaining more territory for Gujarat.\n\nAs the armies all over the vast Indian lands fought in various wars against one another, some of the armies were starting to develop new tactics, and the formation that was becoming to be known as the Pike Square. Try as they may, the Gujarati armies had yet to master the formation, although it was common knowledge in Mewar and Bahmanis. The sultan offered fervent prayers, hoping his men could grasp this new tactic before encountering a superior army from Bahmanis or Mewar, his mood not helped by the news that Jahlavad had laid a claim to the province of Patan. Mixed fortunes continued to befall Muhammad, as news that an agricultural revolution in ??? Had resulted in more recruits for the army was offset by news that Mewar would now defend Junagarh if an attack was made. In his prayers that evening, the Sultan wished for better fortune in future months.\n\nAttachments\n\nimage.png\n\nupload_2018-11-21_20-9-22.png\n\nupload_2018-11-21_20-9-33.png\n\nupload_2018-11-21_20-9-50.png\n\nimage.png\n\nupload_2018-11-21_20-10-36.png\n\nupload_2018-11-21_20-10-48.png\n\nimage.png\n\nWith the summer of 1450 presenting little opportunity to attack his enemies, but also seeing nobody wishing to attack Gujarat, Muhammad decided to take a tour of the country. His fort in Ahmedabad was still under construction, and he had secured the funding for a further fort to be constructed. With the tour concluded, the Sultan decided that Daman would be the best place, and ordered its construction. As he returned to court, Muhammad came face to face with a local landowner who was causing a problem through his overtaxing of the peasants in Baroda. Wishing not to upset the peasantry, he chastised the landowner and sent him on his way. As the afternoon wore on, he heard that his actions had upset the Amirs, which had turned them against him. He called a military diet to appease the Amirs, only to realise as he had done so that this action had upset the Marathas. He now promoted the case of the Marathas, which in turn caused more upset amongst the Amirs! This really annoyed Muhammad, who was only trying to appease the estates in his courtroom, and in making one faction happy had annoyed the other, and had spent several days pleasing and displeasing each faction in turn. He had little choice but to keep the Marathas happy, and hope that in time the Amirs would forgive him.\n\nWith the Sultan once again unwilling to attack any of the surrounding tribes, but equally nobody attacking Gujarat, the construction of the fortifications in Ahmedabad neared their completion. The month of June saw the forts finally complete, a ceremony taking place in the capital to commemorate their completion. At the ceremony a man approached Muhammad, in his hand he held a piece of paper, something he had discovered when digging the foundations for the fort. Muhammad wondered what the paper could possibly be, as he was not expecting any communications from either his enemies or his spies. Upon reading the documents, Muhammad was shocked to discover that a wealthy man from Gujarat had once owned all of the areas of Rajkot and Halar, including the territories owned by Kutch, and his ally, Porbandar! Cursing himself for not having ordered construction of the fort earlier, and the man for not having presented these documents sooner, Muhammad found himself distracted from the rest of the celebrations as thoughts whirred through his mind. How and why had the knowledge of this landowner escaped him and Gujarati historians?\n\nHe set to work the following morning with renewed fervour, as these new claims would surely give him cause for war, the question was against whom. However, after a morning surveying the scene, he realised the only state he could possibly attack would be Porbandar. With Multan still interested in accepting an alliance, the Sultan sent his diplomats to dismiss his alliance with Porbandar and ally Multan. The fact that he still had a royal marriage with Porbandar was still concerning, as the population of Gujarat would be unhappy with this attack.\n\nAs the winter of 1451 took hold in India, Bahmanis declared war with Ratanpur. This brought fresh unease to Muhammad, who felt that whilst smaller and weaker enemies existed, Bahmanis would go on the attack, but it would not be too long before the weaker states no longer existed, and Bahmanis would be coming for Gujarat. The new year saw a new attempt to master the Pike Square, which was successfully achieved by the Gujarati army in February 1452. The Sultan looked for enemies to test his new formation on, and soon discovered that Patna, the only ally of Jahlavad, would not come to their aid. Sensing a golden opportunity, Muhammad declared the Gujarati conquest of Jahlavad. The Jahlavadi army, fearing that Gujarat would march straight for its capital, began to occupy the territory of Patan. Eager to test the military prowess of his army, the Sultan ordered his general to divert his armies course to Patan, catching and wiping out the retreating army before moving to occupy Jahlavad and commence the siege. Acknowledging that the siege would take some time, Muhammad once again looked to the affairs within his own country. He was disgusted to discover that his absence had caused bribes to grow more accepted within Ahmedabad, but also encouraged to hear that the building of marketplaces and mosques could bring additional income to Gujarat, as well as a royal marriage between Gujarat and Multan. The happy news was once again tempered by the rumours that a claim had been fabricated by Bahmanis on the province of Baglana. Mercifully, the Bahmanis had decided not to attack, despite having cause for war, which gave Gujarati troops the winter to continue with the siege of Jahlavad. The coming of the new year brought the surrender of Jahlavad in February 1453, with Gujarati administration coming into immediate effect. To celebrate this conquest, the building of a marketplace in the Khambat was ordered, this would further increase the trade power of Gujarat, and therefore its income.\n\nThe administration of Jahlavad was progressing nicely, when court was rudely interrupted by a man being dragged in by several courtiers, who all alleged to have heard the man try to build a network of Bahmani spies in Gujarat. Ordering his swift banishment from the country, Muhammad sent his diplomats to improve relations with his allies in Sindh and Multan. Bahmanis were surely looking for any excuse to attack Gujarat now, and Muhammad wanted nothing more than strong, reliable allies who would see off the threat. More distressing news came for the Sultan with the death of Ahmed Kata, who had been a great supporter of the Sultan and his family. Muhammad ordered a day of mourning for the passing of the great man, and the construction of a mausoleum in Ahmedabad in his memory. The coming summer of 1454 brought some much more cheerful news for Gujarat, with the province of Jahlavad now having been successfully brought under Gujarati rule, and the marketplace in Khambat being completed. Muhammad thought it best to commemorate the opening of the marketplace and organised a ceremony to take place there, at which he would personally deliver a speech thanking the people who had given their lives for the Sultan and their country over the past decade. Muhammad stood and addressed the gathered crowd, intending to tell them of the new trade routes and good fortunes this marketplace would bring. As he began his speech, the words he intended to say deserted him, and in front of the masses he appeared a blundering buffoon. The assembled courtiers hung their heads in shame as the Sultan concluded his speech, knowing it would take much work to stabilise the mood of the peasantry.\n\nThe Sultan understandably chose to take a low profile during the upcoming months, hoping the damage he had done to his reputation at the opening of the marketplace would pass. The news that Dehli was about to attack Kangra seemed trivial to him, but he was cheered by the thought that this recent transgression had made the Amirs forget that he had wronged them in the past, and they would no longer be disloyal to him. Rumours of an uprising by Gujarati nobles thankfully turned out to be little more than rumours, as the Amirs had decided not to revolt against Muhammad. The Sultan longed for a chance to prove he could rule the country effectively again as he arrived at court the following morning, and thanked Allah that not one but two spies had been caught and exiled, at least there would be less threat from the spies of Kalpi and Teligana. No sooner had Muhammad offered his thanks than a diplomat from Mewar burst into the court room, declaring that they too would rival Gujarat. The Sultan took the letter from the Mewari diplomat which announced the rivalry, and looked the diplomat in the eye. He continued to meet his gaze as he tore the letter to shreds without bothering to read it. Muhammad had decided that the best way to tackle the problem of having all of these rivals would be to fight fire with fire, he would need to pick his moments carefully however, but his antics in court that morning had been designed to show that he would not back down from confrontation with his rivals. Feeling satisfied has he lunched with his courtiers, the news that afternoon that Baglani separatists had begun to mass made him feel uneasy. He now had even more rivals to deal with, and the last thing he needed was to appear weak enough that they might attack.\n\nThe winter of 1455 saw the need to intervene in the affairs of the Jains once more, with the Sultan having to step in to prevent the slaughter of animals for Parayusha, an important date in the Jain calendar. This pleased the Jains but upset the Ulema, thankfully not enough to make them disloyal to Muhammad. With the Baglani separatists readying for uprising, and no viable targets for Gujarat, 1456 began rather uneventfully. The Sultan sent his diplomats to improve relations with his vassal in Kandesh, as they had proved of vital use in previous wars, and surely would do so again. The only thing that troubled the Sultan were reports of religious extremists in Ahmedabad, which he decided to put an end to by enforcing religious orthodoxy in the city. Of dismay to the Sultan was the news from Patan, where the demand for chintz had regrettably declined, slowing their economy. With little else occupying his mind in the capital, the Sultan chose to go on another tour of his country, perhaps stopping in Patan to purchase some chintz. Unlike previous tours, which he had gone on alone, this time he would take his wife, the Sultana Noor with him. As they visited towns and villages far away from Ahmedabad, the Sultan was struck by just how well the Sultana was received wherever she went by the populace, who saw her as one of their own. Muhammad felt especially blessed to have married Noor, and her status as a consort of the people seemed only fitting. The conclusion of the tour saw military matters come to the forefront of the Sultans mind once again, he had hoped to attack Porbandar, having no longer considered them a useful ally, so the news that Porbandar had allied themselves with Vijayanagar was most frustrating, as he did not want to have to fight such a powerful enemy as them. The news from Kutch was much more promising, however, as the only nation who would come to their aid was Porbandar. In the construction of the fort at Ahmedabad, the Sultan had discovered that Gujarat actually had legitimate claim to Kutch, and their relative weakness to Gujarat presented him with an opportunity to go to war.\n\nAttachments\n\nupload_2018-12-2_21-0-52.png\n\nupload_2018-12-2_21-1-2.png\n\nupload_2018-12-2_21-1-17.png\n\nupload_2018-12-2_21-1-57.png\n\nPreparations for war began in secret, the Sultan not wishing to attack until what he deemed would be the right moment. The initial plans were disrupted almost immediately with the news that the Gujarati ally, Multan, was about to attack Baluchistan. Muhammad had not wished to bring Multan into what he hoped would be an easy opportunity to show Gujarati might over Kutch, but the Sultan hoped that Multan would still come to his aid in defence of Gujarat if required. A wet season early in 1457 was welcomed by the population of Kotlan, who had been able to gather a better harvest than in previous years, resulting in extra taxes available for the war preparations. Less pleasing was the news that another diplomat from Kalpi had been expelled from Ahmedabad, and that Mewar was now declaring themselves to have a claim on the province of Malikanthi. The Sultan prayed that neither the Kalpi or Mewari spies had any idea of the Gujarati plans to attack Kutch, or his preparations would be for nought.\n\nAugust of 1457 saw the Gujarati plans threatened once again as the separatists from Baglana had chosen to rise up against Muhammad, wishing to be an independent nation once again. Thankfully the Gujarati army had been stationed nearby for just such an uprising, and marched upon Baglana. Despite unwanted losses for the army of Gujarat, the army commanded by Bhenji Haji put down the uprising. The loss of manpower worried the Sultan, but an opportunity to strengthen the privileges of the nobles in November of 1457 gave a boost to the manpower of the nation of Gujarat. With many challenges ahead for the country, the manpower boost was welcomed by all in court, as a stronger standing army would hopefully deter any would be attackers. This extra manpower lead to the recruitment of two additional regiments in Ahmedabad over the winter, bringing the Gujarati army up to a total of 15,000 men. Enough to take on Kutch and Porbandar, but notably weaker than the forces of his rivals. These units would soon have a chance to test their mettle it would seem, as the populace of Idar and Jahlavad seemed to be readying themselves for an uprising, trying to win independence for themselves once again. Having put down the rebels in Baglana with ease, Muhammad wished for nothing more than to see the separatists try their luck against his army, feeling confident of a Gujarati victory. News that Oman was preparing to attack Yas in a war amused the Sultan, as these tidings had travelled across the sea to reach Gujarat, surely the Omani neighbours would therefore be aware. Once again Muhammad gave thanks that none of his diplomats would leak news of impending attacks like this, and returned to the war preparations.\n\nThe summer of 1458 saw a rich and bountiful harvest, which brought more money into Gujarati coffers. Wishing to be seen as a man of the people, Muhammad chose to invest the money back into the lands, in the hope that it would result in more and better harvests in future years. The Sultan was also entertained by the diplomats from Junagarh, who were claiming Thana was their land, dismissing the idea of an attack from Junagarh from his mind almost as quickly as he dismissed the diplomat. In the autumn Muhammad faced a difficult decision on the purification of tax laws, not wishing to upset the people of Gujarat, he eventually rejected the proposal.\n\nWith 1458 having been relatively uneventful, Muhammad hoped that 1459 would finally be the year that Gujarat would assert their dominance on Kutch. However, the Sultan discovered one January morning that Jaunpur had gone to war alongside their allies, the Timurids, who were attempting to put down Transoxianian independence fighters. With Multan still fighting Baluchistan, this left Muhammad rather anxious about what would happen if any of his numerous rivals declared war against Gujarat, as he would need his allies to come to his aid in defence. Muhammad went to his armies to check that his men would be ready in case of war, and that his generals were up to date with the latest in military innovation. He was displeased to find that whilst the pike formation had been common knowledge for several years, all over India warriors were standardising the size of these pikes, in order that the infantry cold be deployed in full force against a cavalry charge. Whilst the majority of the Gujarati army had seen the logic in this, and had made sure their pikes were of the same length, there were numerous soldiers who still had not done so. Muhammad chastised the men and hoped soon all of his infantry would be fighting with standardised pikes, he felt sure his rivals were already doing so, and would laugh in the face of such inferior military tactics in Gujarat. As he returned to court following the inspection, the Sultan was surprised once again to hear of more loose lipped diplomacy, this time from across the Pacific Ocean, where Warsangali was preparing to attack Adal. Surely if Muhammad knew from several thousand miles across an ocean, then how the neighbouring Sheikhdom would be caught by surprise would be anyones guess.\n\nThe winter of 1459 came, much colder than that of previous years. Muhammad felt a chill through his bones unlike any that had come before. He had given many years of service to the people of Gujarat, and had hoped to see his realm prosper against its rivals, but he feared that he may not live to see this. He called on Ahmad, his son, preparing him for rulership, and offered prayers to Allah that Ahmad would be able to succeed in furthering the nations cause. The Sultans health grew worse through the winter, and in December 1459, Muhammad passed away. His death was mourned across Gujarat, as a ruler who had struggled against his rivals, but had looked after his people and done what he could for his country. The nation now looked to Ahmad II Muzaffarid to continue the path taken by Muhammad. They were relieved for the succession of their throne, with another young man called Ahmad who was next in line, but had been shaken by the death of Muhammad Shah II Muzaffarid.\n\nAs he took to the throne in Ahmedabad, Ahmad knew he had little time to waste. The stability of his country had been shaken by the death of Muhammad, and the new Sultan set to work immediately to assure the people of Gujarat that nothing would be different with him in charge. Ahmad would need time to settle in to the rulership of the country, however, and so the plans for war against Kutch were temporarily postponed until Ahmad was ready. He had only just taken charge but had to very quickly come to terms with the intense rivalries with Bahmanis, Mewar, Malwa and Vijayanagar, as well as the threat of separatists in Idar and Jahlavad. So engrossed was Ahmad in rulership that news that Dehli was about to attack Ladakh almost passed him by, but he took the chance to expel a Vijayanagari diplomat who had been caught spying in Ahmedabad with eagerness. Like his predecessor he was grateful that nobody in his court had such a careless tongue, as he was keen to carry on with his fathers plan to attack Kutch, and would not want this to become common knowledge.\n\n1460 had passed by in a flash to Ahmad, but after a year of ruling he felt that 1461 would be an opportunity to show his qualities as a ruler of a nation. His inexperience unfortunately showed through in the early part of the year as reports came to his court that Shammar was ready to attack Hormuz, and Majpahit was ready to attack Luwu. Ahmad spent several days studying these reports, and was unfortunately too caught up in working out exactly how these reports had come about, and of what significance they were to Gujarat. When he emerged from studying these reports, he began to hear rumours that bribes and corruption had become apparent in his court. Having not come across any such bribes or offers himself, he dismissed this as merely a saying and went about his business. As the weeks passed he realised the error of his ways, as this corruption would hinder the country in the long term. Cursing himself and his inexperience, he vowed to be more careful with such matters in future.\n\nAhmad’s newfound vigilance was soon to come to fruition with the capture and expulsion of more diplomats from Mewar and Junagar, the Sultan feeling pleased that his court continued to be efficient at rooting out people who were trying to hinder Gujarat. The Mewari spy gave cause for concern, however, as before his exile he was seen looking contemptuously at the Gujarati infantry and their pikes, which were still all not of equal length, whereas in Mewar the infantry all had standardised pikes. The Sultan was therefore pleased to receive a report not long after the expulsion of the Mewari spy, explaining that the soldiers involved in manoeuvres that day were using some out of date equipment, and the Gujarati army were in fact about to make the switch to the standardised pikes as of March 1461. Feeling pleased that this was the case, the Sultan decided that perhaps it was time to send spies of his own to Mewar and see what troubles he might be able to cause there. Further afield it appeared that Bahmanis may be about to turn their attentions elsewhere, having sent a warning to Orissa that they would defend any nation that the Orissans attacked. The Sultan made note of this, and wondered how he might be able to use this to his advantage. After all, the preparations for war with Kutch had resumed, and he hoped the opportunity for attack would arise. Despite wanting to go to war, he would however have to deal with matters inside Gujarat for the time being. Extremists similar to the ones his predecessor had dealt with in Ahmedabad were causing trouble in Konkan, Ahmad wished to take the same stance on the extremists as Muhammad had done, and issued orders to clamp down on the movement. No sooner than these orders had been carried out than news of an upcoming war between Mong Kawng and Mong Yang filtered into court. Having been distracted by such rumours in the past, the Sultan afforded himself a brief chuckle, before turning back to matters of his own state.\n\nOver the past eighteen summers, and possibly for numerous ones before that, the army of Gujarat would sit idle and await instructions from its general. Although they were an efficient fighting unit who had won several battles in the recent past, the Sultan thought they would be more efficient still if they would drill themselves when not fighting battles. After giving instructions to Bhenji Haji on how to drill his army, he retired to his chambers, pensively deciding what to do next. News from around India filtered into court and it appeared that a new Sultanate in Delhi had reformed from the ashes of the empire that had existed during the time of Muhammad. Ahmad decided that befriending the new Sultan may prove useful, and sent his diplomats forth to improve relations.\n\nA quiet meeting in court on an April afternoon was suddenly interrupted with news of another war of aggression from the Bahmanis, this time they were attacking the state of Orissa on the eastern coast of India. Sensing that this would tie up the Bahmani armies, the Sultan ordered Bhenji Haji to cease drilling at once, and make ready for war. A unit of mercenaries was assembled in Ahmedabad, their first order being to escort a recently caught diplomat from Vijayanagar out of the Gujarati capital. The Sultan longed to go to war and continue what Muhammad had started, but first of all had to settle some urgent matters in court. His first action was to clamp down on corruption within the ranks of the Ulema, which upset them somewhat. The second action to support some merchants acting in Coromandel was approved by all in court. Ahmad was starting to adapt to rulership, it seemed. With Bahmanis seemingly out of the picture, the final preparations for war took place, briefly disrupted by the expulsion of another diplomat from Junagarh. These Junagarhi diplomats were becoming a nuisance to the Sultan, who thought of turning his armies towards them instead. Seeing the alliance between Junagarh and Mewar stopped the Sultan, for the time being at least.\n\nOn the 1st of August 1462, the Sultan awoke and went to court, striding purposefully through the streets of Ahmedabad. The assembled courtiers turned to face the Sultan as he marched in through the entrance gates and took his usual seat. Once sat there, the Sultan declared that now was the time to strike at Kutch and Porbandar, to retake what was rightfully Gujarati land. It was time, he said, to finish what Muhammad had planned for. A cheer erupted around the courtroom as a messenger was sent at once to the general Bhenji Haji, who was given orders to march into Kutch. Haji nodded, and the invasion began at once. Rather than send his armies to Kutch, the general first directed his forces to Halar, where an army merely half the size of the Gujarati force had assembled. As with previous battles, the sheer numbers of the Gujarati army, combined with the recently standardised pikes, led to a solid victory. With the army of Kutch having been wiped out, the generals next orders were to occupy Halar and Rajkot before turning for the war goal, Kutch. The loyal subject of Gujarat, Khandesh, had sent a contingent of 4,000 men to help with the Gujarati conquest. They passed through Rajkot, informing the Gujaratis that an army of 6,000 men from Porbandar was attempting to assault Ahmedabad, the Khandeshi force then made its way to Porbandar itself, cutting off any potential reinforcements. The winter of 1462 saw the sieges begin slowly, which made the news that Vijayanagar had declared war on Calicut a boost to the morale of the Gujarati army, which now had little to worry about other than winning the sieges, and the war.\n\nWith little resistance remaining from either Porbandar or Kutch, General Bhenji Haji divided his forces, and ordered the recruitment of a mercenary unit in Jahlavad. The forces under the General marched for Ahmedabad, seeking to put an end to the attempted blockade by the army of Porbandar. With the additional mercenaries from Jahlavad, the Gujarati army now numbering 8,000 caught the smaller Porbandari force and drove them out of Ahmedabad with ease, killing all who sided with the enemy.\n\nWith Bhenji Haji proving effective in controlling the war, Ahmad had been able to focus more on rulership, assisting his administrative team in progressing with formulating national ideas. With many rivals and enemies surrounding Gujarat, the Sultan decided that his initial focus should be the defence of his country. With some defensive ideas beginning to formulate, Ahmad turned his attention to Bhenji Haji and the war effort. When he had divided his forces, the half that Bhenji Haji had not assumed control of was sent to occupy the fort at Kutch, whilst Generals army remained in Ahmedabad. Reports from Kutch were that the siege was making slow progress, whilst in Porbandar the armies of Khandesh lacked the manpower to effectively sustain a siege. General Haji therefore took a unit of men with him to assume control of Kutch, whilst the remaining Gujarati force was sent to bolster the siege of Porbandar.\n\nWith the reinforcement of both sieges, Ahmad was confident that the war would soon be won, even if it lasted into the following year. His return to court saw him receive news that loose lipped diplomacy remained rife in the region, with reports that Bengal was about to attack Orissa, and the state of U would shortly declare war on Koch. The Sultan also had to deal with news that more nations were declaring themselves the rightful owners of Gujarati land. Mewar claimed Patan, whilst Palitana claimed Koch. The Sultan dismissed the claim of Palitana, and retaliated against Mewar with a claim of his own on the province of Barmer. From around India, the news was that Vijayanagar had already beaten Calicut, whilst Bahmanis were still fighting for victory against Orissa and their allies.\n\nThe new year of 1464 saw the defenders desert the fort at Kutch, with Bhenji Haji acknowledging their surrender at the beginning of February. No sooner had Kutch surrendered than the separatists who had been threatening to uprise in Jahlavad announced their independence and would fight anyone who would oppose them. With no trouble from Kutch or Porbandar, Bhenji Haji turned his army for Jahlavad, and as he had done with the Baglani separatists before, put the upstarts to the sword. There were reports of separatists massing in Idar, but these could wait for now. The siege of Porbandar was proving troublesome, with Ahmad deciding it would be worth taking Porbandar as well as annexing Kutch. Reports were that the morale of the defenders was evaporating and that Porbandar would soon belong to Gujarat.\n\nWith the war all but won, Ahmad felt a sense of accomplishment, after all, he was about to finish what his predecessor had started. He hoped that the Mewari spy who had been recently caught and expelled had heard nothing of the imminent surrender of Kutch and Porbandar, or that he was unaware of the monument to Muhammad II Muzaffarid that would be unveiled in Ahmedabad to commemorate the Gujarati victory. The timing of the construction of the monument turned out to be ideal, with Porbandar surrendering on the day that the monument was completed. Ahmad accepted the surrender of both Kutch and Porbandar, declaring that all of their lands would now be ruled by Gujarat, and dedicating the victory to Muhammad. For all of the struggles that his nation had experienced, the first of June 1464 would hopefully be a day long remembered in the history of Gujarat. The celebrations continued long into the night, with the following days seeing little take place in the capital, with the exception of the news that Oman was preparing to attack Hormuz. The Sultan wondered how this may turn out, after all, if the news had reached Gujarat, then surely someone on the island of Hormuz would be aware of an impending attack. As Muhammad had done before him, Ahmad offered a prayer of thanks for his diplomats having not let loose any of his plans.\n\nAttachments\n\nupload_2018-12-8_12-35-30.png\n\nupload_2018-12-8_12-35-44.png\n\nimage.png\n\nimage.png\n\nupload_2018-12-8_12-37-6.png\n\nThe remainder of 1464 saw little happen in Gujarat, with the army earning some respite from their recent endeavours, and the mercenaries having been thanked and sent away. There was a small disturbance in the capital, with the populace wanting to move against the Sufis in the city. The Sultan saw little reason for the uprising, and chose to clamp down upon this movement. Meanwhile, the spy network in Mewar produced another claim, this time on the province of Vagad. It seemed as though Mewar was experiencing problems with a pretender, who was revolting against the current ruler, but this apparent weakness may not be reason enough to attack them. The Sultan would want to be sure of victory before attacking one of his rivals, as defeat would surely be catastrophic.\n\nThe year 1465 began with the Sultan having to reenact a taxation policy that had worked before, that of land acquisition. After all, the policy had been successful for the last two decades, so Ahmad saw little reason to change it. After a quiet January, it was announced that Vijayanagar had gone to war again, this time with Kotte. This war seemed uneventful, other than Kolathund would join in the war, trying to defend Kotte. If Vijayanagar began to occupy Kolathund, then it would make a war against Junagarh all the more easy, although Gujarat would still have to fight Mewar which would still be an issue. That Mewar was still dealing with their pretender made it really tempting for Ahmad to strike now, but with rumours the Idari separatists would soon rise up in revolt, the Sultan chose instead to bide his time. He would see the year overseeing the construction of a mosque in Ahmedabad for now, and pray that a moment would come.\n\nThe Sultans prayers were not immediately answered, in fact quite the reverse, as in May of 1465 the separatists in Idar saw their moment and rose up in revolt against him. The rebels presented little challenge for the Gujarati army, who marched into Mahikantha and wiped them out to a man. The third rebel uprising in two decades was of some concern for the Sultan, on the whole there seemed to be unrest across most of Gujarat. Ahmad dedicated the rest of the year to touring his country and trying to better understand the situation. After visiting much of the realm, the problem appeared to lie with the growing religious tensions. As Gujarat expanded, more Hindu peasantry were becoming disagreeable to the Sunni rulership. Religious unity may well be something the Sultan needed to address in the future. The Sultan also learned of the Bahmani victory against Orissa, in which they had taken a vast swathe of land for themselves. As he concluded his tour, his experience of the national unrest became somewhat firsthand. In the Sultans absence, efforts had been made to improve the fortifications in Ahmedabad, with the peasant labourers working exhaustedly. It seemed the peasantry had had enough of their labours, and rose in a revolt against their Sultan. Fortunately the numbers of the Gujarati army were still vastly superior to any disorganised rabble, and the peasant uprising was crushed. It seemed as though this year had been a troublesome one for the Sultan, but the expulsion of a Vijayanagar spy brought with it the news that Kolathund would not join in a war due to being heavily occupied by the army of Vijayanagar. This, Ahmad realised, could be his moment. Mewar had finally crushed its pretender rebels, but had depleted its reserves doing so. Whilst 1465 had been a quiet year for Gujarat, the year to come would see them in a position to take on Junagarh once and for all.\n\nWith manpower reserves in Gujarat seemingly healthy, and some wealth in the treasury, all that was left to do was march the army to Porbandar and await for the declaration of war from the Sultan. With Sindh and Multan both also keen to join the war, the Sultan had a choice to make. Not wishing to exhaust both of his allies reserves, he decided that Sindh would make the better ally in the upcoming war. With Sindh promising their support, the Sultan declared the Gujarati conquest of Dir, with Sindh and Khandesh supporting Gujarat, whilst Mewar joined in on the side of Junagarh.\n\nSomewhat disappointingly for the Sultan, the army of Junagarh escaped before the Gujaratis arrival at Diu, fleeing in the direction of Rajkot. Pausing briefly to occupy the province of Diu, Bhenji Haji then turned his army for Halar, where he was able to catch the army of Junagarh. The general gave the order to charge at the vastly outnumbered enemy, fighting alongside his men. In the chaos of battle, general Haji was surrounded by a group of enemy infantry. Despite putting up a valiant resistance, Bhenji Haji fell in battle, and the victory won by the Gujaratis was a hollow one. A new leader was chosen from amongst the best fighting men in all of Gujarat, a man by the name of Nasir Begada. His first action was to return to Junagarh, with the majority of his army occupying the fort at Girnar, whilst a smaller contingent reoccupied the province of Diu, which had fallen back into enemy hands when the Gujarati army had left the province.\n\nFate, it seemed, had not been kind to Gujarat during the war so far, and the news that rains had failed in Konkan, damaging the local economy there, did little to ease the Sultans mind. The occupation of the province of Diu had made the Junagarhi navy flee the port there, where they had engaged the navy of Sindh. Despite having lost all control of their land, it appeared the navy of Junagarh would not go down without a fight, and were winning against the Sindh fleet. At the declaration of war, all of the Gujarati ships had returned to port, and it occurred to the Sultan that sending the navy to assist Sindh in the battle may prove decisive, which it did. The victory at sea seemed to spur the forces on land, and the fort of Girnar soon fell to the rejuvenated army of Gujarat. With Junagarh now firmly under control, Mewar now became the focus of Gujarati attention. It appeared Mewar had allied Bahmanis, which was troubling to the Sultan. He would need to see if there was any way to weaken Mewar when the opportunity arose to sue for peace. Mewar had been steadily coming under occupation from the armies of Sindh and Khandesh, but Mewar had taken the opportunity to escape into Sindh, and was now attempting to siege the fort at Thatta. With the defenders apparently ready to surrender, Nasir Begada marched the Gujarati army to drive out the besiegers, feeling confident of victory. The encounter did not go as planned, with the outnumbered Mewari still able to rally and secure victory against Gujarat. On the retreat to Ahmedabad, the general wondered exactly how Mewar had won such a victory. He did not have to wait long for an answer as scouting reports soon filtered back to both General Nasir and the Sultan Ahmad that Mewar had recently discovered superior military tactics as a result of the development of the Arquebus, and that Vijayanagar had also been using these new technologies. This report sent both men into a panic, Gujarat was now outgunned by Mewar, and no longer would sheer numbers win a battle.\n\nFortunately for Gujarat, minor skirmishes were the only military encounters to follow in the war, save for a victory at Kutch against 6,000 Mewari soldiers, although this was a struggle for the Gujarati army. The victory in battle was enough to demand the surrender of Diu and Girnar, and the Sultan gleefully sent the peace deal, which was agreed to by the Mewari diplomats, who left at once. It was only once they had left the Gujarati court that the Sultan realised that he had forgotten to dictate any terms to Mewar.\n\nThis diplomatic faux pas was the source of much discomfort for the Sultan and all in the Gujarati court. Whilst the war had been a victory on paper, it had come at a great cost to Gujarati manpower. Indeed, Gujarat could no longer support an army of 14 regiments, so the decision was chosen to consolidate the survivors into 12 new units. The army would still take months to reinforce, as would the reserves of Gujarati manpower. In addition, there were separatist rebels threatening to rise up in several provinces, and the Arquebus was now common knowledge across the subcontinent, save for Bahmanis and Gujarat. What the Sultan did have was money, which he could potentially invest in reinforcements to bolster the beleaguered army, or fortify the defences. Hoping the recently expelled diplomat from Telingara had learned nothing of the Gujarati troubles, the Sultan ordered the trade fleet to return to protect trade in Coromandel, whilst also building a few new ships to help with future naval engagements. Recognising the need to boost his military skill in an attempt to learn of the Arquebus, an advisor, Muhammad Latif was hired. Troubles, however, continued to plague Gujarat, as a lack of demand for chintz was now being experienced in Daman. Feeling more vulnerable than he had done in his brief reign, the Sultan decided that improving relations with his allies would be a prudent course of action. He spent the early part of 1469 improving relations with Sindh and Jaunpur, and spent the second half of the year improving Gujarati relations with Multan. Whilst the administrators finished their work in Diu and Girnar, problems continued to amount for the Sultan in the form of spies. In addition to the spy from Telingara, 1469 saw a spy from Palitana, and two from Mewar caught and expelled from Gujarat. The 1460s had begun favourably for Gujarat, but their fortunes had take a turn for the worse in the second half of the decade. The war against Junagarh had left the country in a rather perilous position, and the Sultan offered prayers to Allah that the 1470s would be kinder to both himself, and the people of Gujarat.\n\nAttachments\n\nupload_2018-12-12_10-37-34.png\n\nupload_2018-12-12_10-37-44.png\n\nupload_2018-12-12_10-38-33.png\n\nupload_2018-12-12_10-38-51.png\n\nAs the 1470s dawned, the Sultan realised that he would need to reinforce the army, so three mercenary units were hired, hoping they would not be instantly pressed into action. Further afield, news was coming in of the misfortunes of Orissa. They had once been a strong presence across the eastern coast, but had been utterly decimated by Bahmanis and Bengal, so that now Orissa only owned one solitary province. The Sultan could only hope that such a misfortune would not befall his kingdom, however it was bad news that came his way with the peasants of Porbandar revolting for their independence. Fortunately, despite its recent losses the Gujarati army was still well equipped to deal with these rebels, who were put down with ease. Meanwhile, further afield the Sultan had been forced to step in and save a merchant in Coromandel who had been struggling against the fierce competition.\n\nWith much troubling both the Sultan and the nation, Ahmad decided that it was time for action. In October of 1470, he organised a ceremony to celebrate the nations recent military efforts. Many had given their lives for the Gujarati cause in the past decade, so a ceremony was organised to honour their sacrifice, and to show the nation that they could take confidence in their army. The ceremony was a huge success, with many new men stepping forward as potential recruits to the Gujarati force. Whilst it would still take years for Gujarat to recover, Ahmad felt that as well as putting the losses in the recent wars behind him, the ceremony was also a way of looking forward. With the subjugation of Saurashtra complete, the Sultan could now look to new goals, and a brighter future.\n\nThe Sultans recent deeds had started to make the population of Gujarat believe in him again, unfortunately however his next decision to chastise a rowdy noble upset most of the local population. The Sultan realised he needed to act quickly to rectify this situation, and sent his loyal supporters to reassure the peasants that this action was not going to happen frequently, and hereby restore some order to the country. From his allies news reached the Sultan of the death of the ruler of Sindh, and so a new royal marriage was arranged between the countries to keep relations firm.\n\nWith money and manpower reserves still being restored from the conquest of Junagarh, the Sultan had little to do for the foreseeable future, and chose to spend the rest of 1471 on a tour of Gujarat, seeing how the rest of the country was faring. The tour progressed smoothly until it was interrupted in October by the news that Marwar was attempting to gain independence from Mewar. The Sultan returned to Ahmedabad to see how the Marwari independence war would fare, and if there was any way Gujarat might benefit from it. By the time Ahmad returned to court, however, the news from Marwar was that nobody had joined them in their cause, whilst Mewar was being defended by several of its allies, including the Bahmanis. Feeling sure that this spelt certain failure for the Marwari uprising, the Sultan chose to continue with the tour of his country.\n\nThe summer of 1472 brought the news of the end of the royal marriage with Multan, with the unfortunate death of its ruler. Ahmad proposed a new marriage between the two nations, offering himself as the eligible husband, which Multan accepted. Ahmad married the new Sultana Khanwal Dhaliwala at a lavish ceremony, with the celebrations lasting long into the night. Ahmad was keen to show his new Sultana around the nation of Gujarat, and planned a tour of the country. Preparations for the tour were postponed, firstly by the Sultans decree that some of the newly acquired manpower for the Gujarati army would be used to help improve the tax situation in Ahmedabad, and secondly by a revolt for independence by the separatist faction in Kutch. Offering thanks to Allah that neither he nor his wife had been present in Rajkot when the separatists had declared their war, the Sultan ordered general Nasir Begada in to deal with the uprising. Despite a rather large separatist army being present in Rajkot, the Gujarati forces put down the rabble with ease, much to the gratitude of the Sultan and the population of Gujarat.\n\nFrom the south of India the news was less promising. Vijayanagar had declared war on Venad, which left them with very few military targets once this war was over. Ahmad hoped that Vijayanagar would not move to attack Gujarat any time soon, as his country was still recovering from the recent war. The expulsion of a Vijayanagari spy, as well as one from Mewar did little to ease the Sultans mood, and the news that Palitana had forged a claim on another Gujarati province was also troubling. If Palitana could bring its allies, Mewar and Vijayanagar into a war with Gujarat it would cause severe problems for Ahmad and his country. Fearing that his nation was under threat from all sides, Ahmad sent spies into Bahmanis. If an attack was coming, he would wish to know who would be the enemy to attack first.\n\nThe summer of 1473 came, and it still felt like problems were mounting for Gujarat. Separatists were still threatening in several Gujarati provinces, and enemies were still aplenty, although mercifully none of them seemed to want to attack Gujarat for now. The Sultan sat in court one morning, distracted from the ongoing meeting by the thoughts that had been going around his mind about how best to defend and secure his nation when a diplomat came bursting into the courtroom. Those assembled listened to the news that Vijayanagar had gone to war with Madurai, the Sultan, seeing no immediate threat to Gujarat in this news, dismissed the messenger. He had heard many times that Vijayanagar had gone to war with a small state in the south of India and felt that this news was no different to any other war that his rival had fought in the last three decades, and besides, he still had separatists within his borders that could rise up at any moment.\n\nAs the summer months wore on, life was still not becoming much easier for Ahmad. He found himself more and more distracted as the meetings wore on, seemingly unable to do anything to motivate himself, or his people, to boost Gujarat. Reserves of manpower and money were still recovering, technological progress had seemingly stalled and his rivals still loomed. At least his allies were still loyal and no rebels had troubled him, but on the whole things did not feel promising. As another meeting wore on, the Sultan found himself distanced from the voices of the assembled courtiers, indeed he had almost forgotten the purpose of the meeting he had called, as recently all of the meetings had seemingly blurred into one. As he watched the birds flying outside of the courtroom window, he became less focused on the chatter around him and found himself more and more interested in the flight of the birds, envying them for how little they must have to worry about in comparison to him. Unfortunately for the Sultan, his dreams were suddenly interrupted by a loud thump on the courtroom door. He shook in his seat at once as the doors opened and a diplomat from Palitana entered, flanked by several of his warriors. Fearing the worst as the diplomat advanced upon the gathering, Ahmad opened his mouth, but no words were there. He was relieved that nobody noticed this as the Palitana diplomat began to address the Sultan, asking him for military access through Gujarat. The Sultan sat in confusion and asked why Palitana would need military access though his country, to which the diplomat replied that they were at war with Madurai and the Bahmanis. Ahmad had been in such a haze for the last few months that he had not been aware of Palitana ever declaring a war with either Madurai or the Bahmanis. Suddenly it came to him in a flash. Bahmanis were an ally of Madurai, and Vijayanagar had gone to war with Madurai, which must mean that Vijayanagar were at war with the Bahmanis! He looked at the diplomat, who had stood impatiently awaiting an answer, and gave permission for Palitana troops to march through Gujarat. As the diplomat and his warriors left, the Sultan made a note to start paying more attention at meetings, and to look for the opportunity to strike at Palitana.\n\nThe news that Vijayanagar and Bahmanis were at war was a relief to Ahmad, who no longer felt the need to fear an attack from either of these rivals. He was grateful not to have been attacked by either nation as the news came from Girnar that the Junagarhi separatists had revolted against Ahmad, wanting to be independent again. Once more the Gujarati army was called upon to put down the uprising, and under the command of Nasir Begada the Junagarh separatists were put down with disdain. No sooner had the Gujarati army won its victory at Girnar than the separatist faction in Navanagar chose to revolt for their independence. Thankfully the Gujarati army was fresh from their victory against the Junagarh separatists, and relished the opportunity to defend their nation once again. Their march from Girnar to Halar was swift, and the crushing of the separatist revolt was ruthless. 1473 had begun with the future for Gujarat looking uncertain, but the end of the year saw some optimism brewing amongst the populace. The threat of war had seemingly dissipated, whilst Gujarati spies had forged a claim on Palitana, who were now being invaded by the Bahmanis. Ahmad prayed that an opportunity may come to strike at his troublesome neighbours.\n\nFrom within Gujarat, news of the improvement of docking facilities became prominent along the countries coastline, with improved trade income resulting from this development. Also encouragingly, news also came of a talented Qadi in the Tapati region of Gujarat, with the people of the area feeling a sense of ease at the man. The end of 1474 saw a ceremony taking place in Gujarat, to acknowledge the ties between Gujarat and Multan. This celebration affirmed a strong sense of kinship between the two peoples, which hopefully would last long into the future.\n\nAttachments\n\nupload_2018-12-14_17-12-44.png\n\nupload_2018-12-14_17-13-15.png\n\nupload_2018-12-14_17-13-21.png\n\nupload_2018-12-14_17-13-42.png\n\nupload_2018-12-14_17-14-4.png\n\nupload_2018-12-14_17-14-13.png\n\n1475 began with Bahmani armies marching through Gujarat, returning to Bahmani territory having sued Palitana for peace, whilst Palitana were no longer fighting Bahmanis, they were still protected by their alliance with Vijayanagar, much to the annoyance of the Sultan. Thankfully for Gujarat, during the summer the Arquebus was rolled out across the Gujarati army, thus bringing Gujarat onto equal footing with its rivals once again. Meanwhile, the spy networks in Palitana and Bahmanis had served their country well, with Gujarati claims being laid on the provinces of Gohlivad and Daulatabad respectively. The Sultan recalled these spies and thanked them for their services to Gujarat, before sending some of the spies away to Malwa. The web of alliances surrounding Gujarat left little to no opportunities for the Sultan to expand his territory, so the remainder of 1475 was spent beginning construction of a marketplace in Thana, and drilling his armies in Halar.\n\nThe impasse that had befallen Gujarat at the end of 1475 would continue into the following year, with the only really concerning news coming from Malwa, where the newly developed limber was being unveiled for the first time. It was less than a year since Gujarat had caught up with the rest of the subcontinent in deployment of the Arquebus, and now their rivals had surged ahead again with the limber, seemingly a large cast bronze shell that fired projectiles at the enemy. The summer came, and with it came an unexpected diplomat, this time from Nagaur to the north, who were asking for military access through Gujarat as they were at war with Palitana, Kalinjar and also Mewar. The Sultan wished the diplomats luck in their war, hoping this could play a significant hand in eliminating one of his rivals. Further south the Bahmanis had lost heavily to Vijayanagar, ceding a number of territories to their enemy. Bahmanis had also been left with no allies after this war, but still had the resources to begin rebuilding their nation. With the only Gujarati ally who would join them in a war being Jaunpur, the Sultan decided that although it was tempting to attack the Bahmanis. If the move backfired it could cripple Gujarat for years to come, and therefore it was decreed that Gujarat would not attack at this time. The thought of Gujarat going to war seemed highly unlikely to the Sultan, so he was surprised one afternoon by a visit from his neighbours in Sindh. The Sultan stood and listened as the diplomat invited Ahmad and the army of Gujarat to join with the Sindh conquest of Barmer against Mewar. Dumbstruck by the invitation, the Sultan hesitated for a moment before realising that of course the best thing to do would be to accept the call to arms. Once the diplomat had left the room Ahmad stood in shock for a moment, here he was at war with a rival, with the strong chance to inflict defeat on one of his many rivals and show that Gujarat could be a force to be reckoned with.\n\nThe army of Nasir Begada marched into Venad, whilst Khandesh began to occupy the Mewari capital at Chittor. With no reinforcements coming to relieve Venad, the Gujarati army occupied several further provinces in Mewar whilst the army of Sindh assisted Khandesh in the siege of Chittor. With the war between Mewar and Nagaur still ongoing, the progress in the Sindh conquest was swift and met little resistance. Within months of the war being declared, all of the provinces owned by Mewar were now being occupied or besieged by an enemy. The Gujarati army retreated to Patan, and lay in wait for any attempt from Mewar to relieve the occupied territories. Occupying the province of Mewar had also brought the local gold mine under Gujarati control, with its income being appreciated by the Sultan. With the extra funds going into the treasury, the Sultan was able to order the construction of a barracks in Baglana to boost reserves of manpower, whilst also learning of the Workshop, which would increase production in his provinces. With the fall of the Mewari capital at Chittor in October 1478, the war would soon be at an end, with Mewar now completely occupied by its enemies, and the armies of Sindh now heading to siege the remaining enemies in Kalingar.\n\nWith Mewar unable to continue fighting, a surrender came in the early weeks of the new year. As Sindh had been unable to wrest control of Barmer, which had been occupied by Nagaur, Mewar had therefore been forced to surrender Mewar and Vagad to Gujarat, with Sindh unable to take any territory for itself. This came as a surprise to the Sultan, who had not been sure exactly how Gujarat would gain benefits from the war with Mewar, but he was nevertheless grateful to the Sindh diplomats who had secured the peace deal. His administrators were set to work immediately in the newly gained provinces. The celebrations for the end of the war and a Gujarati victory took place shortly after, with the construction of a marketplace in Bharuch being a more lasting memorial to the successful conquest. As the celebrations died down, the decision was taken in government to centralise the bureaucracy in Ahmedabad, allowing for more effective control within the states controlled by Gujarat. With the new territories Gujarat had taken, the Sultan once again had to step in and take care to prevent extremism in his country, and as Muhammad had done before him, prevent the slaughter of animals for the Jain festival of Paruyana, celebrated at the turn of the year 1480.\n\nThe new year saw the Sultan undertake a tour of Gujarat with his wife Khanwal. As the peasants had been impressed with Muhammads consort, so they were with Khanwal, who proved herself to be a consort of the people. As Ahmad returned to court, he received the welcome news that the administrators sent to bring Mewar and Vanad into line with Gujarati laws had been successful, but the biggest news concerned the nation of Mewar, who after surrendering to Nagaur had been left with merely the provinces of Barmar and Gornar to its name. Whilst there were many in the recently lost provinces who would attempt to see them returned to Mewari rule, and these would have to be monitored closely, it seemed that Mewar was no longer a threat to Gujarat for the time being. Local affairs came to the fore in the later part of the summer, with the local Jains in Diu being upset by the Tarh that the Sultan had put upon their goods, with the upset causing a drop in production. More disastrous was the rumours of treason against Gujarat which had come from within the army. Whilst the rumours, and the dissenters, were quelled, this treason would compromise the army for some time. Worse was to come from Mewar, where the Gujarati spy network appeared to have been compromised. Seeing that there was little need for the spies to be in Mewar for the time being, the Sultan recalled the remaining spies, but not before the discovery that the limber had also spread to Mewar, giving them a small advantage over Gujarat once again.\n\nHowever, the news from the newly acquired provinces of Mewar and Vanad was most concerning to the Sultan. Members of the separatist faction in the provinces were keen to rise against Ahmad, and were also proclaiming that Mewar had allied Vijayanagar, which would make taking on Mewar much harder. Within the court, the loss of Sidhraj Naru was felt deeply by many. He had done much to ensure the progression of the Gujarati navy and trade income, and he would be missed. After a brief period of mourning, the naval reformer Fath Jurjani was chosen as a replacement.\n\nAfter the appointment of Fath Jurjani, the Sultan Ahmad’s health took a turn for the worse. He had hoped to be able to recover from his illness rather swiftly, but unfortunately this was not the case. The threat of an uprising by Mewari separatists caused Ahmad's health to deteriorate once again, and prayers were offered for his survival. With the Sultan unable to carry out the full extent of his duties, the council of Gujarat were given more powers to ensure the smooth running of the country. The winter saw little change in the health of the Sultan, or the willingness of the separatists to disperse, with relations improved with Multan, Ahmad recalled his diplomats as the separatists revolted in March of 1483. Nasir Begada ordered his army to charge into the hills to disperse the dissenters, a decision which whilst ultimately successful caused heavy losses for the Gujarati army. With Gujarati alliances seemingly firm, spies were sent to Mewar and Malwa, and construction of a fort in the gold mines of Mewar, now owned by Gujarat, began. The operations soon produced a claim on the province of Mandsaur, owned by Malwa. Although the chance to go to war with them was slim, at least Gujarat now had a reason to go to war, should the chance arise.\n\nAttachments\n\nupload_2018-12-18_20-6-38.png\n\nupload_2018-12-18_20-7-56.png"
