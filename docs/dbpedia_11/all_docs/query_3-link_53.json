        "text": "AFP, KUALA LUMPUR\n\nMalaysia’s new king called for equality for all in the multi-ethnic Asian nation as he was enthroned yesterday in a lavish ceremony steeped in centuries-old royal traditions.\n\nSultan Abdul Halim Mu’adzam Shah, 84, who was king previously in the 1970s, became the first person to hold the position twice under Malaysia’s unique rotating monarchy.\n\nThe Oxford-educated king is a lover of jazz, soccer, polo and golf.\n\nThe king, known as Yang di-Pertuan Agong, or “He Who Is Made Lord,” formally took office in a televised ceremony in the yellow carpet throne room of the new hilltop palace in the capital, Kuala Lumpur.\n\nMalaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak proclaimed Sultan Abdul Halim the 14th king, before an audience of other Malaysian sultans, government ministers and foreign dignitaries.\n\nThe monarch, dressed in black and yellow royal regalia, made of wool and embroidered with gold threads, was presented with a Koran and then with the royal long dagger — a symbol of power and authority — which the king drew and kissed.\n\nHe then took an oath of office to rule Malaysia in a fair manner, uphold the Islamic faith and ensure a just government.\n\nIn his speech, Sultan Abdul Halim praised Najib’s leadership and reminded the government to ensure prosperity for all Malaysians.\n\n“All Malaysians have equal rights ... It is my wish to see all Malaysians gain from the country’s development,” he said.\n\nDespite his merely ceremonial role, Malaysia’s king commands great respect from the public, especially majority Malays. The country’s sultans trace a lineage back to Malay sultanates of the 15th century.\n\nPortraits of the king and queen adorn government buildings throughout the country. The king is also the symbolic head of Islam in the nation, as well as the nominal chief of the military.\n\nAbdul Majid Puteh, 85, who knew the king when he was 12 years old while they were studying together, described him as a “friendly” person, adding that he once saw the king washing his own clothes.\n\nIn December last year, after being installed as the new king, Sultan Abdul Halim called for unity amid rising racial tension in the multi-ethnic country as the country heads for possible snap elections.\n\nThe sultan, who stunned many in 2007 by walking 2km to a soccer stadium after his official car got stuck in traffic, had urged Malaysians never to repeat deadly 1969 race riots that still haunt the country.\n\nThe violence occurred just months before he took the throne as Malaysia’s fifth king for a five-year term starting in 1970.\n\nHowever, tensions have increased recently amid rising resentment over a range of racial disputes.\n\nNajib’s Malay-dominated ruling coalition is seeking to stave off a rising opposition alliance led by Malay and Chinese parties.\n\nRace and religion are intertwined in politics in Malaysia, where Muslim Malays make up about 60 percent of the 28 million population, followed by large -Chinese and Indian minorities.\n\nThe country has had an elected monarchy since independence from Britain in 1957. In a unique arrangement, the throne rotates every five years among the rulers of the nine Malaysian states still headed by royalty.\n\nSultan Abdul Halim is the ruler of Kedah state in the north.\n\nThe sultan is a lover of jazz, particularly Nat King Cole, Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin.\n\nHe succeeded Tuanku Mizan Zainal Abidin, 49, who was one of Malaysia’s youngest kings."
