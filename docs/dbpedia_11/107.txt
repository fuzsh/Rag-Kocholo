The Sultan of Perak was the heir of Sultan of Malacca after Perak State was ruled by Sultan Muzaffar who was the son of Sultan Mahmud Shah. The administration of Sultan of Perak grew along Sungai Perak and this can be seen from the tombs located along the Perak River basin from the Lower Perak River to Kuala Kangsar. Due to modernization and environmental changes, most of the graveyards are located at remote places and are difficult to access. This study was conducted to solve the problem of looking for the graveyards’ location by using ICT applications. This paper also discusses the application and procedure for mapping of the point of the graveyards’ coordinates for the tomb sites which were visited during the conduct of this study. The findings of this study will help the heirs of the Sultanate of Perak, the local authorities and the public to find and access the late Sultans of Perak’s graveyards easily and systematically.
