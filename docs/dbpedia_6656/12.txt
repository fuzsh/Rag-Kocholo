I guess John Gilling really wanted to make this picture, since he wrote it, directed it, and produced it under his own production company. That's a lot of effort to realize a personal vision on the big screen but it's just a low-key adventure story about some pirates and smugglers. Peter Cushing is the stern and taciturn squire of the village, being blackmailed by a a wild and rough Bernard Lee, quite a different role than the one he is best known for as "M" in the original Bond series. The beautiful Michèle Mercier is the love interest for the Squire's son, but none of the characters really drew me in. Instead there's a romantic highwayman who feels somewhat peripheral…

Nowhere near as good as Captain Clegg, Fury at Smuggler's Bay is a little too stuffy to be entertaining. Sure, some swash is buckled and Cushing is dependable as always, but Bernard Lee seems woefully miscast. This one scrapes by on the action alone. It was clearly a passion project for the director, who also wrote and produced, but he lacks the vision to make this a more adventurous night at the pictures.

I'm now struggling as I want to watch more previously unseen Peter Cushing but having difficulty finding his films online. YouTube is a mixed bag and streaming is hopeless.

Watched Online.

I'm sort of disappointed with this because it promised a lot.

You've got Peter Cushing, but he's barely used.

You've also got Bernard (M) Lee as the villain, which is fun to see him play against type, yet somehow is very boring.

Finally, you've got the beautiful Michèle Mercier and she too is terribly wasted in this.

I love pirate/smuggler movies, so believe me when I say this isn't worth your time.
