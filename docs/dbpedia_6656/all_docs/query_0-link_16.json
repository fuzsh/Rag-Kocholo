The plot revolves around smuggling in Cornwall. Studio sequences were filmed at Twickenham Film Studios in west London with the external sequences representing the coast of Cornwall actually being shot at Abereiddy on the north Pembrokeshire coast in south-west Wales.\n\nContents\n\nCast\n\nCritical reception\n\nReferences\n\nCast\n\nPeter Cushing as Squire Trevenyan\n\nBernard Lee as Black John\n\nMichèle Mercier as Louise Lejeune\n\nJohn Fraser as Christopher Trevenyan\n\nWilliam Franklyn as The Captain\n\nGeorge Coulouris as François Lejeune\n\nLiz Fraser as Betty\n\nJune Thorburn as Jenny Trevenyan\n\nKatherine Kath as Maman\n\nMaitland Moss as Tom, the butler\n\nTommy Duggan as Red Friars\n\nChristopher Carlos as The Tiger, a pirate\n\nMiles Malleson as Duke of Avon\n\nAlan Browning as 2nd Highwayman\n\nCritical reception\n\nIn the Radio Times, David Parkinson gave the film three out of five stars, and noted, \"as Cushing suggested in his memoirs, this 1790s adventure is tantamount to an English western, with a saloon brawl, sword-wielding showdowns and a last-minute rescue. However, the peripheral characters are more subtly shaded, with Miles Malleson's comic nobleman and George Coulouris's abused outsider being particularly well realised.\"\n\nReferences\n\nFury at Smugglers' Bay Wikipedia\n\n(Text) CC BY-SA\n\nFury at Smugglers Bay IMDb Fury at Smugglers Bay themoviedb.org\n\nSimilar Topics"
