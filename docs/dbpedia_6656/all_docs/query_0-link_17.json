        "text": "Critical reception\n\nIn the Radio Times, David Parkinson gave the film three out of five stars, and noted, \"as Cushing suggested in his memoirs, this 1790s adventure is tantamount to an English western, with a saloon brawl, sword-wielding showdowns and a last-minute rescue. However, the peripheral characters are more subtly shaded, with Miles Malleson's comic nobleman and George Coulouris's abused outsider being particularly well realised.\" [3]"
