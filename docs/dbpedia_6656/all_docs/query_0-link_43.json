        "text": "Joseph Rearden is an American agent who is assigned to work with British intelligence. He travels to London and meets at the undercover offices of MI5 chief Mackintosh. Rearden is briefed on his assignment by Mackintosh and his secretary Mrs Smith, a young French woman who has Mackintosh's complete trust. Rearden is to intercept a consignment of diamonds being sent incognito via the regular mail. His job is to waylay the postman and make it seem like a mugging then pass the package discreetly to Mrs Smith.\n\nRearden achieves his objectives and is getting ready to return home when the police come to arrest him after receiving an anonymous tip off. Rearden has false papers for his cover identity and cannot prove who he really is. He is tried in the courts and sentenced to twenty years imprisonment for robbery with violence.\n\nChelmsford Prison is a high security institution and included amongst its many inmates is Ronald Slade, a communist sympathiser who spied for the Russians. After many months of incarceration Rearden is approached by an inmate named Soames-Trevelyan who informs Rearden he represents a network known as the Scarpers who can break anyone out of prison for a suitably large fee. They will guarantee to get that person out of the country and to a place of safety and have a 100% record of successes. Ronald Slade is going to be liberated by the Scarpers very soon and Rearden is offered a place too. Rearden agrees and arranges the payment from his secret bank account. The operation is meticulously planned and during an arranged diversion in the courtyard, Rearden and Slade are hoisted over the wall on a crane and sped away by motorbikes and into a van. They are rendered unconscious with drugs so that they don't learn of the secret destination where they will be held for several weeks until the police search dies down. When Rearden next wakes he finds himself in a country manor house at an unknown location. He meets country squire Brown who masterminds the operation.\n\nThe escape of the traitor Slade is big news and very embarrassing for the government. Rearden's simultaneous escape is just a minor footnote to the story. Opposition MP Sir George Wheeler is a fierce opponent of the government's security policies and makes plenty of reactionary political capital over their latest appalling blunder. Sir George and Mackintosh are old friends who served in the war together. Mackintosh takes Sir George discreetly aside and tells him that for the sake of their friendship he is breaking security and advising him that the recent escape was a planned operation and Slade's co-escapee is a planted agent whose assignment is to penetrate the organisation arranging the prison escapes. Mackintosh wishes to avoid Sir George the embarrassment of having to later retract his harsh criticisms when it is revealed that whole affair was orchestrated. Mackintosh confirms the operation is highly secret and no one besides himself knows that Rearden is really an undercover agent.\n\nVery soon after that Rearden finds that his cover has been unaccountably blown and Squire Brown holds him prisoner and tortures him for information on who else knows about the operation. Rearden confirms that only Mackintosh knows the truth. Soon afterwards Mackintosh is the victim of a hit-and-run driver and is rushed to hospital where he remains unconscious in a coma. Rearden manages to escape from the manor house and discovers he is in Ireland. He phones Mackintosh's office and speaks to Mrs Smith who tells him about Mackintosh's accident. Mrs Smith knows all about the operation too and tells Rearden she will fly to Ireland and meet him. When she arrives she tells Rearden that Mackintosh has left a letter to be opened in the event of his death which will tell the prime minister of Rearden's innocence and the full details of the operation. She also reveals that Mackintosh is her father who had met her French mother during the war and that is why he trusts her so implicitly. She cannot figure out how Rearden's cover was blown because security was watertight with only the three of them knowing about it. She knows that on the day of his accident Mackintosh had been to see his old friend Sir George Wheeler at the Houses of Parliament but there was nothing remarkable about that.\n\nThe worst thing about the failed operation is that now Slade is at large and the plan had always been for him to be recaptured or killed. Then they discover that the very same Sir George Wheeler is holidaying in Ireland on his yacht and they realise with a shock that he must be part of the lucrative Scarper gang with his yacht used to pick up the escapees and ferry them to a safe haven - Slade is probably currently secretly on board pending transportation to Wheeler's next destination. It becomes obvious that Mackintosh must have suspected his friend of being corrupt and deliberately broken security to prove it - although Mackintosh clearly didn't reckon on being targeted himself.\n\nRearden and Mrs Smith follow Sir George to Malta where he is supposedly reviewing the British troops and holding a gala party on his yacht. Rearden tries to convince the local Maltese police to search Sir George's boat for the convict, but Sir George is such a well-respected, regular visitor to these parts that the police laugh off the crazy allegations.\n\nMrs Smith joins the party and goes aboard the yacht herself to try to confirm Slade is present - but she is captured by Sir George who still believes he can contain the situation if he disposes of her and Rearden. Then word comes through that Mackintosh has died and Sir George knows that the incriminating letter will be released and there is no way back for him other than into prison. So he will have to avail himself of his own escape route to a foreign clime.\n\nRearden comes to rescue Mrs Smith and there is a standoff with Sir George holding Mrs Smith hostage. Sir George negotiates with Rearden that he will release Mrs Smith if he and Slade are allowed to leave. Rearden agrees and is a man of his word. But as soon as Mrs Smith is free she picks up a gun and cold-bloodedly shoots Sir George and Slade dead as they are leaving as avengement for the death of her father. Valerie Marshall is an unmarried single mother with a young baby. She lives in a flat with her mother who is housebound with multiple sclerosis and increasingly dependent on Valerie. Valerie also holds down a job as a telephone exchange operator where she works with her friend June. Valerie takes her responsibilities seriously but has little joy in her life.\n\nA newly appointed parish priest called Father Dyson with a proactive approach to his pastoral duties pays her a visit to see how she and her mother are coping. He offers to arrange some care help for Mrs Marshall and to give Valerie a break he invites her to accompany him as a supervisor on an organised trip of the church youth club to Brighton.\n\nValerie and baby Scott have their day out in Brighton and while walking around she sees a outdoor event where a pop star is being interviewed for a radio show. His name is Mike Preston a hippy singer known for some outspoken views on society and his disbelief in any kind of god. She finds herself in agreement with some of the things he says. Later on while she is sitting on the beach Mike happens to be walking by and they get talking and find they have an empathy on their viewpoints on relationships - she is touched by his caring nature and he remarks on her love for her little baby saying she should be happy because the baby's happiness depends on hers. They go back to his hotel room and sleep together and she feels she has found in him a kindred emotional spirit. But Mike's busy promotional tour means has to move on and she returns home to her dull life.\n\nOnce she gets home she finds her mother has taken a turn for the worse and has been taken to hospital. Valerie feels trapped by her circumstances and her mother makes her feel guilty for trying to have a life of her own and not being there for her.\n\nDuring this period of hospitalisation tragedy strikes when Valerie's friend June is caught up in a football supporter's riot while looking after Valerie's baby whilst she is at the hospital - the rioters accidentally tip baby Scott's pram and he is killed. Valerie tries to carry on with her traumatised life and sometime soon after Mike the pop star comes back into her life when he is nearby on a local leg of his tour. His compassionate and sympathetic nature is comforting for her. She gets a call from the reverend to come to the hospital to be with her mother but she delays going to be with Mike for longer as she knows her mother always seems to be at death's door and pulls through. But this time her mother does die while she was having fun with Mike and she feels terrible.\n\nMike soon has to go away again and she has no idea if he will ever come into her life again. She now has no one to care for and responsible to no one but herself but seems unable to snap out of her reverie and change her humdrum life in any way. Some time later she is doing some ironing and the new song by Mike Preston is played. It is called \"The Social Casualty\" and as the lyrics progress they touch a sad melancholy chord with her and then the chorus mentions her by name with sentiments like \"Valerie's future left her behind\" and lines about a baby's tragic death and death of a mother and she realises the song is about her - he has totally captured the sadness and desperation of her life and she breaks down into floods of tears. As the film end we leave her contemplating the lyrics.

Eric and Ernie are two travelling salesmen who specialise in toy soldiers. They are on their way by train to the small town of Camp Grande in the South American state of Parazvellia where they hope to try their luck selling their merchandise. Unbeknown to them also on the train is a revolutionary hero of Parazvellia called Fernando Torres returning home after a long absence in England to help free his country from the current president's corruption. Torres' mode of dress and general appearance are flukishly similar to Eric's. Government forces learn that Torres is trying to return and start searching the train and whilst trying to evade them Torres falls from the train to his death.\n\nWhen Eric and Ernie arrive in Camp Grande the revolutionary bandit waiting for Torres assumes that Eric is their man and is a bit puzzled by his strange behaviour and his unexpected companion. Eric and Ernie are equally puzzled why a complete stranger keeps saying the word \"Torres\" to them and assume it must be a local form of greeting. Eric and Ernie soon find themselves in the middle of a firefight between police and bandits and when it is over the police arrest the hapless pair on suspicion of being possible rebel collaborators.\n\nMeanwhile the Red Star Rebel's military commander, Carillo, and his deputy, General Carla Marin, discover Torres' dead body by the railway tracks. This is a devastating blow to their movement because Torres was the son of a former great president and was therefore an inspirational figure whose return was going to signal the birth of a new era. But then they receive a bizarre report from their man at the railway station that Torres has been arrested by the police. It seems clear that the arrested man is a dead ringer for the real Torres and Carillo figures that he may be of use to them.\n\nSo Carillo organises a raid on the police station and liberates Eric and Ernie. Only Carillo and Carla know the truth and they allow everyone else to think Eric is the real Torres home at last. Carillo offers Eric a large fee for impersonating Torres and performing certain presidential duties once they have taken over. Eric thinks it all sounds a bit dangerous and is ready to decline until he meets the gorgeous Carla and suddenly he is all keen to do it to impress her. Eric and Ernie are both wowed by the women in the revolutionary camp who share all facilities with the men including the showers. Carla is the commander of the women's army and does not see why the women should get any special treatment because they are all in the struggle for freedom together.\n\nThe rebels launch their surprise attack on the city and take over. President Diaz goes into hiding and his location is unknown. His three young children are captured by the rebels but they refuse to say where their father has gone.\n\nIn his role as the new \"president\", Eric is asked to make a live television broadcast announcing the intentions of the new republic and Carillo supplies an autocue with the exact script he must follow. But during the broadcast the autocue fails and in panic Eric begins improvising and makes generous pledges that delight the citizens but flabbergast Carillo and his cabinet. The rash promises made by \"Torres\" cannot be afforded and would bankrupt the country and Carillo realises that Eric has become a liability and it would be best if he were disposed of. But Carillo knows Carla is fond of Eric and he still needs the support of her and the forces she commands, so he devises a convoluted plan to trick them both.\n\nThusly Carillo persuades Carla to seduce Eric into agreeing to help stage his own fake assassination at a public event. Carla tells Eric that once \"dead\" he will be secretly smuggled away and can return home with his promised fee. Eric agrees to go along with it because it is Carla asking him. He is told the assassin's bullet will be a blank and Eric should fall to the ground and play possum when he hears the noise. But what Carillo has not told Carla is that the bullet will actually be deadly real.\n\nEric is formally dressed by Juan who was once dresser to Torres' father and he outfits Eric in the same formal attire that the great President always wore in public. Eric attend the public event and when the shot comes Eric goes down hard from the impact of a real bullet. He is pronounced dead by a stooge doctor as planned but it seems to his puzzled friends that he is not faking it when he cannot later be roused. Carla realises that Carillo tricked her and knows that he has become dangerous and they have replaced corruption with tyranny. Ernie privately mourns his friend's death until he discovers that Eric is not dead after all because Juan had dressed him in a bulletproof vest as he always routinely did for Torres' father. Instead the impact had merely knocked Eric out cold for a time.\n\nCarla helps Eric and Ernie get away from the presidential palace and asks them to take with them the ex-President Diaz's children who are themselves due to be executed. But their car breaks down on the way and the children decide to lead them to a place of safety. It is an old army museum in the country where their father is secretly hiding with a small number of his trusted men. But Carillo is able to track them and sends his forces in pursuit triumphant that soon he will be able to capture the ex-president too.\n\nErnie puts to good use the tactics he has picked up playing toy soldiers and organises a defence using the old museum equipment. This holds Carillo's forces off for a while but they eventually storm the museum and take everyone prisoner. Meanwhile Carla has been alerted that the president's children are in danger and sends her women's forces to engage Carillo's men. The men are more heavily armed and in a better defensive position and Carillo scoffs at Carla's defiance knowing his men can mow Carla's forces down with ease. But Carla knows this too and decides to employ a highly atypical tactic. She orders all her women to strip off and march upon the museum dressed only in their skimpy underwear. The male soldiers whoop and holler as they ogle the fantastic display of female flesh and refuse to shoot at sexy half-naked women despite Carillo's increasingly frenzied orders that they do so.\n\nBy exploiting this male weakness Carla's women quickly take over and arrest Carillo and save Eric, Ernie and the children. Carla is installed as the new president and vows to her people that she will oversee a new age of peace and justice for all - most especially for women in the newly-named Women's' Republic of Parazvellia. Eric and Ernie decide to stick around and join the women's army knowing when they are on to a good thing! Nicholas Urfe is a teacher who has come to the Greek island of Phraxos to take up a teaching post at a small local school. He has just ended a relationship with a French air stewardess called Anne because she wanted a greater commitment than he could bring himself to offer. He is escaping from the responsibilities he does not feel ready to assume in an effort to try and rediscover himself.\n\nWhilst out walking in the woodlands Nicholas comes across a villa that at first seems deserted but then he is greeted by the white-haired owner who introduces himself as Maurice Conchis and tells Nicholas he has been expecting him. Conchis claims to be a psychic and everything about him is mysterious. He invites Nicholas to stay the following weekend and Nicholas is intrigued enough to agree.\n\nBefore his return to the villa Nicholas does some research on Conchis only to discover that the man is listed as having died in 1944. When Nicholas quizzes Conchis about this he only gets vague answers. Conchis tells Nicholas about his first sweetheart called Lily who died during the First World War while working as a nurse. Soon after that Nicholas begins to see a mysterious woman whom Conchis tells him is Lily's ghost keeping an eye on him although Nicholas finds this claim far-fetched.\n\nNicholas soon discovers that in this villa things are never as they appear and Conchis' ghostly tales were just a small deception for some harmless amusement. Conchis now reveals he is in fact a psychiatrist and \"Lily\" is his patient whose real name is Julie and the playacting is part of her treatment.\n\nHowever when Nicholas speaks to Julie alone she tells him an entirely different story. She is an actress who was hired by Conchis to be in a movie which would be made in a unique way with all the cameras hidden whilst she improvised her way through a loose storyline. Nicholas finds himself attracted to Julie and wants to see more of her. When Nicholas asks Conchis to tell him the real truth about what is going on the older man tells him that Julie's actress story is one of the many delusions for which she is receiving treatment.\n\nConchis tells Nicholas about a key incident in his life when his island was occupied by a Nazi garrison during the Second World War and Conchis found himself being appointed as town mayor. When some partisans killed a group of German soldiers the garrison commandant rounded up eighty local Greeks to kill in retribution even though the culprits were caught. Conchis was forced to help interrogate the partisans in an attempt to save his innocent brethren. But it was to no avail and the eighty men were killed anyway and Conchis was branded a German collaborator. This incident shaped Conchis and was the reason he had to fake his death and start anew all those years ago.\n\nEventually Nicholas is forcefully drugged by Conchis and finds himself in a kind of courtroom where he discovers that everything that has been happening to him and all the people he has met on the island are actors playing a role. Conchis is a millionaire and for the amusement of himself and his friends they regularly put on real-life dramas in which there is one central player who does not know the truth of what is going on. There is no set plot or dialogue and no audience except the performers for whose benefit it is undertaken. Nicholas is irked at being an unpaid puppet and refuses to cooperate any further.\n\nNicholas wakes up in a hospital bed with Conchis by his side. Nicholas asks for how long his life has been manipulated like this - but as ever he gets no proper reply from the enigmatic man. Conchis departs and when Nicholas leaves the room he finds he is not in a hospital at all but on an unfinished set. He is still on the island where he sees his ex-girlfriend Anne. Was she in on it too - does it all go back to before he met her? He gets no further answers because the villa is now deserted with all the fixtures and fittings removed leaving just an empty shell. Set in a France of the recent past. Solange and Claire Le Mercier are sisters who work as maidservants to a rich and glamorous middle-aged woman referred to only as Madame. The two sisters are resentful of the luxurious lifestyle of their mistress and hold a secret yearning to live in her accustomed manner without a care in the world and escape the drudgery they despise. Whenever Madame is present they are dutiful and courteous, mindful of their subservient positions. However when Madame is out for the evening Solange and Claire tangibly act out their bitterness with one of them dressing in Madame's finest attire and playacting an exaggerated interpretation of a haughtily eccentric mistress, whilst the other behaves insolently towards her in the manner they would wish to in real life. These scenarios always conclude with the maid gaining natural justice by \"murdering\" the mistress.\n\nRecently however their joint resentment has boiled up to a point where they are actively considering punitive action against their subjugator. Madame has a younger lover (known only as Monsieur) and to take a delicious revenge on Madame, Claire has written an anonymous letter of denunciation regarding Monsieur's conduct which she has sent to the police. This has resulted in the police taking Monsieur away in handcuffs in an early morning raid. The sisters are gleeful of the distress this causes Madame and believe anything that sullies her perfect world is justified. While Madame is out trying to have her lover freed, the sisters play their wish fulfilment \"game\" yet again. But this time they decide that they should take their reprisals a stage further and later will poison Madame's tea.\n\nMadame returns full of woe at the terrible situation into which her lover has been cast and she wonders who could have written such a horrible letter. We discover that the sisters' hatred of their mistress is staggeringly unjustified. Madame treats her two maids with kindness and thinks of them as part of the family like the daughters she never had. They are both generously allowed the pick of Madame's discarded clothing and are allowed dispensations unthinkable in other households. Madame is so agitated by the current state of affairs that she leaves her poisoned tea undrunk. When Madame learns that Monsieur has been released on bail she heads off out again to be with him.\n\nThe sisters are severely downcast that their efforts to kill Madame failed but their hatred of her remains along with the immeasurable shame they feel at being so lowly in status. Morose overwhelms them and Claire wants to play the \"game\" again straight away. Claire adopts the role of Madame and Solange the murderous maid. Solange becomes so immersed in her deliverance of justice that once she starts strangling Claire she does not stop until she believes she has really killed her. Solange's reason has deserted her and reality and fantasy merge. She soliloquises her exalted triumph at Madame's death and considers how she will become legendary and she will be rewarded with the riches and power she craves for her infamous act of defiance.\n\nBut Claire is not dead and hears her raving sister's fantastical self-aggrandising notions effecting from her imagined death, that Claire decides to administer herself with the poison from the abandoned tea. Claire lays down into a deep sleep and dies and Solange feels joyfully free ensnared in her belief that it is Madame who is dead. Solange celebrates her freedom on the second floor balcony ledge raising her arms in surrender to the fates - and as the film ends we are unsure whether or not she has hurled herself to her own death. Eddie is an American drifter who is wandering Europe on his way to nowhere in particular. He has a talent for singing and along the way he takes jobs in bars and restaurants performing for the customers. He is a bit of a hot-head and usually ends up getting the sack and being forced to move on.\n\nCurrently Eddie is working in an Italian restaurant and gets into a fight with a boisterous customer. The owner fires him but a patron called Gina takes a shine to his looks and his talent and offers him a job with the circus she works at. Gina is in her forties and has a hankering for younger men who can make her feel as if she still young and vital. Part of the arrangement is that Eddie will share her trailer and her bed and in return he will get paid work at the circus helping her in her ventriloquism act as a dashing minstrel that her cheeky manikin \"Godiva\" takes a liking to for the audience's entertainment.\n\nAnother circus act is the equestrian Moreno Trio who perform daring horse-riding stunts. The trio consist of husband and wife Ricco and Elenora Moreno and also Tessa who is Elenora's younger sister. Tessa is young and pretty and takes quite a shine to Eddie who likes her in return. However Gina is very possessive and dislikes Eddie being around the younger woman. Ricco too is not keen on Tessa finding romance because he secretly fancies her himself although his desire is not reciprocated by Tessa who is respectful of her sister.\n\nGina's jealousy eventually gets out of hand and she wields a knife which Eddie wrestles from her grasp - but Gina's ex-husband Bozo the clown is nearby and hears the commotion and jumps to the wrong conclusion that Eddie is attacking Gina (whom he still adores). The two men fight and Bozo ends up being stabbed in the stomach and falls down seemingly dead. Eddie knows he cannot stick around because no one will believe it was an accident and he quickly departs town on the next bus to escape whatever justice might be forthcoming. He is surprised to find Tessa on the same bus - she too is running away so that her presence will not ruin her sister's marriage.\n\nThe bus is heading for Innsbruck over a snowy mountain road. When they come to a police checkpoint Eddie assumes it is for him and gets off the bus and starts making his way on foot across country - Tessa decides to go with him. They walk for ages and eventually find an isolated log cabin in a snowy mountain pass. The cabin shows signs of recent habitation but seems to have been mysteriously abandoned so they make themselves comfortable for the night.\n\nHowever what they do not know is that the real reason for the roadblock was to turn vehicles back because of the danger of an avalanche which this area is prone to at this time of the year. The next morning the army are due to be firing cannons into the mountains to force the accumulated snow to dislodge before it builds to dangerous levels and so the area has been evacuated as a precaution.\n\nEddie and Tessa spend a blissful night together falling in love and next morning set out early unaware of the army's plans. When the cannon's are fired they are almost caught by the tide of avalanching snow but just manage to find cover. Tessa decides to return to the circus after Elenora and Ricco persuade her that there is no need for her to run away. Eddie also decides he must return and face whatever punishment is in store for him for Bozo's death. Upon his return he finds he had been running for nothing because Bozo is not dead after all and is on the road to recovery from the knife wound. Eddie is ever so happy and rejoins the circus act and he and Tessa soon decide to get married. In a previous century in Holland a ship makes port and the sailors have a day of shore leave. For one handsome sailor called Jan it is his home port from which he has been away for many years. What Jan does not know is that he is being observed by a couple of shifty characters who seem very interested in his arrival. Jan travels to his home but finds it has gone, collapsed, and abandoned long ago. He knows not what has become of his family, especially his dear sister Nancy and looks desperately around town for her. He thinks he sees her go into a tavern and follows but it is someone else. He gets into a fight that one of the shifty men stage-managed and comes off the worse losing consciousness.\n\nWhen he comes to he is in a bed and being looked after by Nancy. She tells him he has been brought to their Uncle Cassavius' home of Malpertuis where she now lives. Jan is horrified at this for he believes Malpertuis to be an evil place. It is a huge house full of labyrinthine corridors with locked doors and many unfathomable secrets. It is occupied by all manner of strange people - family and servants who all have a healthy fear of the head of the household Quentin Cassavius even though he is bedridden and close to death. They are just waiting for him to die so they can be free of this place.\n\nBefore his death Cassavius gathers his family and household servants around his bedside for his will to be read to them. He has gathered an extraordinary fortune and has generously bequeathed an equal share of it to each and every beneficiary. However he has a codicil - each beneficiary must from this moment on live at Malpertuis and never leave the grounds. They must stay until they die and the last remaining man and woman should marry and inherit everything. Cassavius hopes that will be Jan and his cousin Euryale.\n\nAfter Cassavius has died Jan is determined to discover the house's secrets and embarks on a systematic search of all the rooms. He finds that Cassavius was a schooner captain and had been a keen scientific experimenter in the area of genetic engineering of strange new life forms looking to create some sort of perfect being - but always meeting with failure. Jan's quest is held up by a manipulative cousin called Alice who wants him to become her lover and she succeeds although his main interest is in the mysterious and enigmatic Euryale\n\nEventually as most of the rest of the household seem to be turning dangerously against Jan, Euryale decides it is time he learnt the real secret of Malpertuis. She and the others are the gods of Ancient Greece who, having been forgotten by the world, were living in solitude on an island of the Ionian sea waiting to die of neglect. But Cassavius had captured them and herded them like cattle in his ship to these shores and into this house. He saw the gods as the perfect specimens he was so keen to recreate in his experiments and his intention was to create a new master race of demi-gods. All the other gods are now dead because people no longer believe in them and only she, Euryale, remains immortal - or to give her her proper name The Gorgon. She looks directly into Jan's eyes and he turns to stone.\n\nEpilogue. Jan is in the present day in a psychiatric hospital and the doctor has declared him fit to leave. During his stay he had written an incredible story fuelled by his deranged fertile imagination of the kidnapped Greek gods - and his story is what we have been watching. His wife Jane is waiting to take him home and she leads him down the brightly lit hospital corridor and through a door which leads into a dark corridor - he recognises it instantly as one of the gloomy corridors of Malpertuis, he turns to go back but all that is behind him now is a brick wall. In the 1500s during the reign of King Henry VIII, Sir Thomas More lives a privileged life as a High Council judge after a career as a skilled lawyer. Sir Thomas is a deeply religious man whose fairness and incorruptibility are legendary. He is also a friend of the King.\n\nKing Henry is married to Catherine of Aragon who has borne him no sons to continue his line - she has only borne a daughter. Henry's frustration has brought him to the point where he has instructed his chancellor Cardinal Wolsey to find a way to end his current marriage so he can marry again. His marriage to Catherine, his late brother's widow, needed a special dispensation from the Pope and Wolsey knows the likelihood of the Pope now rescinding that exemption is nil. Wolsey goes through the motions to placate the King but knows he is not going get anywhere.\n\nWhen Wolsey dies, the King appoints his friend Sir Thomas as his new chancellor believing that he will now have an ally in his endeavours who also possesses an intimate knowledge of the law. But Sir Thomas now finds himself in a terrible dilemma because he holds steadfast the complete authority of the Pope to rule on such matters. However he is wise enough to keep his opinions private for he knows how injudicious words can be used to condemn a man.\n\nThe King becomes impatient and forces a bill through parliament disconnecting England from Rome and making himself leader of the church in England. He proceeds to institute a full-scale reformation of religious practices and thus grants himself approval for a divorce from Catherine. Sir Thomas expresses no disapproval, but because he is such a publicly admired figure his failure to express approval is viewed as a damning indictment. Sir Thomas gives up his position of office and retires. He is careful to make no inflammatory statements to anyone - not even his wife or daughter in private.\n\nHenry orders that an Oath of Allegiance be drawn up that must be signed by all men of importance to signify their approval of the King's new status and that they accept that only his new wife's children have right of succession. Sir Thomas declines to sign but makes it clear that no significance can be drawn from that refusal. His family urge him to sign and pretend he approves but his high principles won't allow him to lie because God would know. The King orders his new chancellor Thomas Cromwell to find a way to discredit More. Cromwell has Sir Thomas arrested and put into the dungeons where he stays for years. Every couple of months he is brought before a board to give him the chance to sign the oath. But each time he steadfastly refuses to sign or make any sort of statement giving his reasons. Sir Thomas's legal training enables him to avoid the various verbal ploys Cromwell uses to attempt to entice an opinion from him.\n\nEventually Cromwell is forced to resort to using the false testimony of a former friend of Sir Thomas who is willing to put his ambition before friendship and describe to the court a damning conversation he claims to have had with Sir Thomas concerning his disapproval of the King's actions.\n\nThis evidence although stringently denied by Sir Thomas is enough to condemn him. With his death now decreed Sir Thomas uses the opportunity to at last give voice to his opinion on the travesty that he thinks has befallen England's religious system because of the King's presumptions of authority over the Holy Church which he considers to be based on an act of parliament which is contrary to the law of God. His words are heard and then he is taken to the Tower of London and executed. Set in Paris in 1890. Dr Georges Bonnet is a surgeon who runs a private clinic and is also an artist and sculptor. He sculpts nudes and with his charming manner has no difficulty having relationships with beautiful woman who are only to happy to pose for him.\n\nGeorges holds a private party to display his latest paintings for sale - however he never sells his sculptures. An ex-lover of his called Janine DuBois turns up unexpectedly whom he knew in Italy and was sad when he suddenly left her without warning. She is with a new man now called Dr Pierre Gerard who is also a surgeon. Georges still loves Janine and has done a sculpture of her for his collection.\n\nGeorges is very edgy as he notices the time and quickly ushers his guests away. He goes to his laboratory where his skin starts turning green and he urgently takes a dose from a beaker of steaming fluid that he keeps locked in his safe. This returns him to normal. He must take a dose every six hours lest something awful happen to him. He is desperately awaiting the arrival of an elderly friend of his called Professor Ludwig Weiss who will be able to perform an operation that will end his dependency on the potion.\n\nLudwig eventually arrives. He is a well-respected scientist in his late eighties and the only man who knows how to perform the life-saving operation Georges needs. He and Ludwig were once working colleagues and their research led to an astonishing medical discovery - the secret to eternal life! Georges decided to undergo the experimental procedure himself. This was 70 years ago and at the time Georges was Ludwig's senior by fifteen years. Now Ludwig is 89 and Georges still looks 35 although he is in fact 104-years-old. They have never published their findings because immortality for everyone would upset the balance of nature - so their long-term experiment has continued in secret.\n\nThe only shortcoming is that Georges needs an operation every ten years to renew his uter-parathyroid gland in a transplant operation. After ten years have elapsed he can survive for a further six weeks by taking a special fluid every six hours. After that (or if he misses a dosage) he would die. The other downside is that every ten years Georges must abandon his life and friends and start a new life in another country so that his agelessness does not arouse suspicion. That is why he creates the sculptures to remind himself of the beauty of the women he has loved through the ages.\n\nLudwig has performed the operation many times but now in his advanced years his hands have developed the shakes and he is unable to do it. Ludwig uses the influence of his reputation to persuade Janine's friend Pierre to carry out the operation under his supervision without telling him the real purpose. Pierre agrees to do it the next day.\n\nIn the meantime however Ludwig learns that Georges has been murdering people to harvest the transplant glands and has not been using revitalised organs from dead cadavers as he had believed. Ludwig says the experiment must end and smashes Georges supply of fluid making the urgency of the operation paramount. In his rage Georges kills Ludwig and manages to scoop only enough fluid from the floor for one final six-hour dosage.\n\nGeorges tells Pierre that Ludwig was called away suddenly - but without the revered professor's supervision Pierre refuses to do the operation even when Georges confides in him the real reason it needs to be done. So Georges abducts Janine and holds her hostage at a secret location to force Pierre to cooperate. Pierre needs Georges to tell him where Janine is being held so he must go through with it. Georges is anaesthetised and Pierre makes the necessary incision - but then he stitches it back up without doing the transplant. Georges recovers believing he is good for another ten years and goes to release Janine. However when the six-hour effectiveness of his last fluid dose runs out he begins to age and realises that the operation was not done. He falls into a murderous rage as he starts to turn green and age. Pierre rescues Janine as Georges dies a painful death as all the years finally catch up with him. Harold Pelham is a smart efficient business executive working for a Marine Engineering company where he is highly respected and regarded for his good judgement. He lives his life in perfect order as a family man with a wife called Eve and two young sons. Although successful he has allowed his life to fall into a dependable but drab routine and his wife fears for the future of their marriage that has no excitement left in it for her.\n\nOne evening while driving home and strictly observing, as always, the speed limit, a kind of madness comes over him and he starts speeding in a reckless manner, abandoning any sense of safety as he revels in the sheer thrill of weaving through the traffic. Eventually he crashes and is rushed to hospital for a life or death operation. During the operation his heart stops and he has to be revived - and for a few moments the surgeons are puzzled by an anomalous reading of two heartbeats showing on the monitor until it reverts to normal.\n\nThe operation is successful and after a period of recuperation and a foreign holiday he returns to work. The topic up for discussion in the boardroom is the proposed takeover offer from a rival electronics company EGO (Electronics Group). Harold is against the deal and feels it may have been prompted by EGO getting wind of an exciting technical innovation his company have secretly been developing. If true then this would mean there was a high-level leak of sensitive commercial information.\n\nAround this time Pelham has some strange exchanges with various colleagues who refer to conversations he never had with them or social gatherings he knows he didn't attend. He begins to wonder if some elaborate practical joke is being played upon him. He meets a woman called Julie who claims to be having an affair with him and he is later contacted by a representative of EGO wondering why the deal is not going as smoothly as he had promised. Pelham cannot understand why all these people seem so convinced it was him since he knows full well it wasn't.\n\nPelham fears he might be going mad and consults a psychiatrist who books him into a clinic for a few days of complete bed rest to cure him of this psychosis in which he seems to be unknowingly acting out another life. Meanwhile WE see another Pelham carrying on with Pelham's life. With supreme confidence he conducts secret negotiations with EGO to smooth through the deal in return for an executive position in the new merged company and then successfully convinces his own board on what a good deal it is. He wines and dines his wife giving a new zest to their stale marriage and generally enjoys the lifestyle that his position and wealth permits him.\n\nWhen the real Pelham comes out of the clinic he hopes his \"double-life\" is over. But of course it is not and once he returns to work he discovers all the changes that \"he\" has supposedly made. Increasingly agitated about his own state of mind he phones home and is amazed to find he is talking to \"himself\". He rushes home to confront the impostor. But Pelham is now a nervous wreck and when the two Pelham's meet face to face in front of friends and family it is the new confident self-assured Pelham whom everyone believes and the overwrought original is decried as the impostor as he hurls hysterical accusations around.\n\nLeft alone together the new Pelham explains to his counterpart that when Pelham died on the operating table the new persona emerged and when the old Pelham was revived it left both of them in existence with two sides of their personality split. The old Pelham rushes out of the house and into his car determined to fetch the police and the new Pelham gives chase with a steely determination to run the unwanted original off the road. Eventually he succeeds and old Pelham's car crashes off of a bridge into a river - but as he does so he vanishes from the driver's seat. And as the new Pelham triumphantly surveys the wreckage below he feels a heart flutter with a few moments of a double heartbeat as his counterpart's spirit re-merges with him and the original combined Pelham personality comes back. Set in the American Wild West in the 1800s. Catherine Crocker is a refined lady of dainty bearing who is aimlessly riding her gelding looking very out of place in the vast deserted Great Plains punctuated only by a railroad track. She is hoping to board a train when she comes across a gang of outlaws who blow up the track with dynamite and hold up the train. The gang of four outlaws get away with $100,000 in cash and Catherine witnesses the whole thing. Their leader is a man called Jay Wesley Growbart and he realises they must take the woman with them so she cannot describe them to the authorities.\n\nThey ride out into the desert region taking Catherine with them despite her protestations. Two of the outlaws, Dawes and Bowen, relish the presence of a woman whom they feel they have a right to enjoy as they see fit. But their leader Growbart has a gracious manner and keeps the others' lecherous appetites in check. It soon becomes clear to Catherine that Growbart is made of a different mettle to the others and his influence is all that is protecting her from unpleasant treatment. It is unclear to her what Growbart is doing associating with such ruffians and it seems he must have his own undisclosed reasons from embarking on this course of action.\n\nCatherine admits to Growbart that she had been running away. Her betrothal to rich mining executive Willard Crocker was a marriage of convenience to help save her father from financial ruin. But she never loved him and is trying to escape his possessive and controlling ways.\n\nMeanwhile a Wells Fargo agent called Harvey Lapchance organises a posse to try and recover the stolen money and capture the culprits. Lapchance knows Growbart from old and is surprised he has stooped to this level of lawlessness. He used to be in the army and had an immaculate record. Several years ago he fell in love with an Indian Squaw called Cat Dancing who is now dead. Growbart had two children with her and was living a happy and contented life. One day he killed a man whom he discovered laying with Cat Dancing and he consequently served time in prison. Willard Crocker joins the posse determined to get vengeance on the men that abducted his wife and inflicted who knows what indignities upon her.\n\nThe outlaws are attacked by a small group of Indians who kill two of them and try to rape Catherine - the other outlaw Dawes runs off. Growbart saves Catherine and the two of them head off together on Growbart's personal mission. Growbart wants to take custody of his two children who are currently being cared for by the tribe of Cat Dancing's brother. Growbart stole the money so he would have funds to look after them properly.\n\nLittle by little Catherine grows to trust Growbart and see in him noble qualities that allow her to believe that he won't turn on her like an animal should she lower her defences. During the days of their journey across the plains and Rockies she starts to fall in love with him and they become lovers.\n\nEventually they reach the village of the peaceful Shoshoni tribe where the tribal chief allows Growbart to state his case. Cat Dancing's brother Iron Knife speaks against Growbart's request. He reveals that his late sister Cat Dancing was killed by Growbart in his blind fury at finding her with another man. But Cat Dancing had been innocent for the man had been raping her but Growbart had been too enraged to listen and killed them both. As Growbart listens to this truth it comes back to him and he realises he had been in denial and accepts his guilt. He knows he does not deserve his children since he was the one that killed their mother. He no longer needs the money so he leaves it behind and rides off. Catherine is sad he has left her and wishes she could have gone with him.\n\nLapchance and the posse arrive in the village and find Catherine safe and well. Lapchance is prepared to let matters rest now he has recovered the stolen money but Willard Crocker has a bloodlust to get vengeance on the man with the audacity to take his wife. Lapchance agrees to continue the search for another day.\n\nGrowbart's young son Dream Speaker sees how much Catherine loves his father and offers to use his tracking skills to take her to him. Catherine is reunited with Growbart and stays with him overnight in a mountainside cave where they start making plans for their future.\n\nNext morning the posse catch up and Willard shoots Growbart with his long-range rifle. Catherine is bereft not knowing how badly injured her lover is. In her fury she picks up Growbart's revolver and shoots her husband dead as he rushes to the scene to jubilantly celebrate his marksmanship. Lapchance disliked Willard's manner towards his wife and decides to overlook her actions and allow her and Growbart their freedom. As the story ends it seems that Growbart may recover from his wound and he and Catherine will continue with a life together. Set in the 1800s. Peachy Carnehan and Daniel Dravot are two English ex-soldiers who have remained in India as civilians after their tour of duty ended. Both are swindling rogues who apply their skills of duplicity to their own financial advantage. Now they have conceived their most audacious venture yet and seek the counsel of Northern Star journalist Rudyard Kipling for some advice. Their scheme is to travel to the backward country Kafiristan and provide their soldiering skills to a tribal leader. They will train the locals with advanced warfare techniques to help them vanquish their enemies and capture its territories. Then the English duo will depose the local leader and become the country's kings and make off with all its wealth. Kipling cautions them that the journey to Kafiristan is treacherous and no white man since Alexander the Great in 300BC has ever returned. But they are determined to go so Kipling gives Daniel a pendant bearing Alexander's emblem for good luck.\n\nPeachy and Daniel persevere across the hundreds of miles of hazardous terrain through Afghanistan and across snow covered Himalayan mountains enduring harsh freezing conditions. Their trek is almost halted by an impassable crevasse until a fortuitous avalanche fills it in with snow and they are able to cross.\n\nThey reach Kafiristan and come upon the village of Urheb where they are fortunate to find an ex-Indian army comrade of theirs called Billy Fish, the only survivor of an ill-fated geographical expedition. He acts as their translator and they are introduced to the ruler Ootah. Their offer to train his men and supply them with rifles with which to conquer his people's many enemies is heartily accepted by Ootah.\n\nThe two Englishmen teach Ootah's men the skills of warcraft and battlefield discipline and eventually they are ready to begin their campaign. The new skills and equipment outclass their opponents whose resistance crumples and the Urheb people conquer many villages. At one point Daniel leads his recruits into battle and charges the enemy. He is hit by an enemy arrow but does not bleed because it struck a thick belt he was wearing under his tunic. But the people do not know this and are awestruck - they believe he is a god and fall into subservient worship of him. Peachy and Daniel realise that this unexpected turn of events can be put to their advantage and is an even better outcome than they had envisioned. So they play along with the notion that Daniel is a god.\n\nSoon the country's most holy man Kafu Selim bids Daniel come to his city populated by monks. Kafu has reservations about Daniel's claim to be a god and is intending to stab him to test whether he bleeds - but when he sees Daniel's pendant all his doubts evaporate because the pendant displays their city's holy symbol. Daniel is exalted as the son of Alexander with the official sanction of Kafu Selim.\n\nDaniel is given access to the stored treasures of Alexander which are now his to do with as he pleases. With their objective achieved beyond their wildest expectations Peachy wants to leave with as much as they can carry while their luck is still in. But Daniel has become accustomed to the godlike reverence to which he is treated. He now believes it was his destiny to come here and lead these people and does not want to abandon them now. He has even selected a bride, although this causes disquiet since the people believe a mortal woman will suffer immediate conflagration should she be intimate with a god. Daniel uses his divine authority to override their concerns. Peachy agrees to stay for his friend's wedding ceremony and then leave afterwards with his share of the treasure.\n\nBut at the wedding ceremony his bride Roxanne is so terrified of her anticipated fate that she bites Daniel when he kisses her and everyone sees Daniel bleed. They know therefore that he is no god and rise up in anger against him for deceiving them. He and Peachy flee but they are caught. Daniel is executed and Peachy is horribly tortured.\n\nPeachy is freed after surviving his torture against the odds although it leaves him a broken man. Three years later he returns to Rudyard Kipling's office to recount the tale and gives Kipling a gift of the golden crown of Alexander that Daniel had also worn. In the mid-1800s in the Southern United States the ownership of black slaves is a way of life for rich white landowners. They believe that black people are a lower species without souls and that enslavement of them is a right ordained by God. The treatment that black slaves receive varies considerably by owner - some treat them no better than animals whilst others allow them a modicum of dignity and welfare consideration. Hammond Maxwell of the Falconhurst plantation is such an owner. He never treats his black workers with unnecessary cruelty although he can be harsh if the need to quash troublemakers arises. Hammond enjoys the company of young black women as his bed wenches and treats them kindly.\n\nHammond's father Warren wants an heir and urges Hammond to get himself a white wife. Warren suggests Hammond's cousin Blanche would be an ideal candidate - and she would agree because her father is looking to borrow some money. Hammond and Blanche get married and almost immediately their relationship is on rocky ground - he suspects her of not being a virgin and she becomes resentful of his continued use of black wenches to whom he shows what she considers undue affection. Hammond sees nothing wrong in his own actions but finds her undisclosed loss of maidenhood to be a vile betrayal and refuses to sleep with her again until she reveals who it was.\n\nMeanwhile Hammond buys himself a strong black slave called Mede from the African Mandingo tribe. Hammond intends to train Mede as a prize-fighter and enter him into bare knuckle fighting contests against other owners' slaves.\n\nBlanche becomes increasingly contentious about Hammond's continued obstinacy and eventually admits it was her own brother with whom she had sex when she had been very young. Warren becomes impatient for a grandchild and decides to force the couple to be man and wife together and locks them in their bedroom until they have been intimate - and this they do.\n\nSoon Hammond has to go away for a few weeks to sell some slaves and while he is gone Blanche decides she will make use of slave fighter Bede in the same way that Hammond uses the black girls. She commands Bede to come to her bedchamber on several occasions threatening to claim he raped her if he does not obey.\n\nWhen Hammond returns nothing is said to him of this illicit dalliance. Blanche soon announces she is with child and Hammond is pleased at the prospect of having a son. Blanche clearly hopes that the child is his and not the result of her unions with Bede.\n\nBut unfortunately for her the baby is black and her shocking disgrace is exposed. The baby is allowed to die. What she has done is considered by everyone as an unforgivable sin even though she tries to assert that her conduct was no different to her husband's. Hammond disguises his fury long enough to calmly administer to the unsuspecting Blanche a beverage mixed with a potion normally used to humanely euthanize old black slaves who can no longer work, thereby sending her into a sleep from which she will never wake.\n\nHammond then vents his full fury on Bede, killing the valuable slave in the most painful way he can devise, despite Bede's futile protests that Blanche gave him no choice in the matter and he was only obeying her orders. Another slave is so furious at this injustice that he picks up a discarded rifle and is about to shoot Hammond when Warren tries to intervene and gets shot instead. The film ends there with Hammond's father and wife both dead. Jeff Farrell is an American who has ended up in a provincial town in Southern France after splitting with his girlfriend. He stays at an off-season hotel run by Eve Beynat and her 19-year-old stepdaughter Annette. Four years ago Annette's father Georges was committed to an insane asylum after using a blowtorch to kill a man who had raped Annette. Eve continues to visit her husband Georges every two weeks.\n\nJeff is attracted to both Annette and Eve and although he initially favours the company of the younger Annette, it is Eve who makes the stronger play for him. Jeff falls in love with Eve and they end up as a couple. Eve tells Jeff more about Georges and how he is actually no longer insane and that it was a temporary madness that overcame him in the wake of what was done to Annette. She tells Jeff that Georges has a plan to escape so he can be with his daughter again and she persuades Jeff to help by driving the getaway transport. After that Eve says she will be free of him forever with no ties or responsibility to look after Annette and she and Jeff can move away together.\n\nJeff agrees to help and after Georges escapes they help drive him to the port. Later on however Jeff discovers a body in the boot of the car which seems to be that of a prison guard that Georges killed during his escape. To cover up their involvement Eve and Jeff dispose of the body into a river. It turns out the prison guard had been Georges' accomplice in the escape.\n\nA few days later Jeff notices some activity in Georges' old workshop. He investigates and is knocked out. When he regains consciousness he finds himself tied up and the prisoner of Georges who has returned along with the retrieved body of the dead guard. Georges says that he does not want to be forever on the run so he is going to blowtorch the guard's dead face in the manner of his previous crime and then set the acetylene tanks to explode. Jeff will be killed and when his body is found with the dead and mutilated guard the police will be forced to conclude from the \"signature\" methodology that it was Georges who died in an accident whilst carrying out a mad atrocity - and they will stop looking for him. (The action then skips forward a few hours so we miss seeing what happens next)\n\n(When we return) The explosion has happened and Georges' plan seems to have worked. Eve spreads the word that Jeff suddenly left to go back to America before the incident. But Annette guesses the truth and says she will tell the police that she thinks it was Jeff who died in the explosion and not Georges. Eve says she will drive her stepdaughter to the police station to report it but instead takes a detour to a derelict warehouse where Georges is waiting. However (in a twist) it turns out that this man is not Georges at all but the prison guard. Eve hated her husband and during her fortnightly visits had fallen in love with the guard and planned this whole deception with him using Jeff as a convenient unwitting pawn. Georges was in fact the dead man believed to be the guard. Eve and the guard plan to run away together once both he and \"Georges\" were considered to be officially dead. Now the only loose end is for \"Georges\" to kill Annette because she knows too much.\n\nHowever what Eve did not know was that Jeff is actually still alive after being pulled to safety by a hotel handyman before the explosion. The police suspected Eve and therefore told her a lie that two men had died in the explosion so she would think the plan had worked. Jeff has since been staying out of sight while the police played along with the deception waiting for Eve to make her move and rendezvous with \"Georges\".\n\nAnnette flees in terror onto to a high balcony shelf pursued by \"Georges\" - luckily he loses his footing and she pushes him to his death. The police then arrive to arrest Eve, and Jeff comforts Annette. Steve Ventura is the senior officer for law enforcement at the US Embassy in Paris. Several of his officers have been killed while investigating the activities of a drug baron named Jacques Brizard who masquerades as a distinguished citizen and remains seemingly untouchable by the French authorities. Ventura takes his case to Inspector Briac of the Paris police but the French detective's hands are tied by orders from on high and he is unable to take any action to curtail Brizard's activities. Ventura is stymied and comes to the conclusion the only way to stop the drug lord's activities is to kill him. Briac unofficially provides Ventura with the contact details of a professional hitman called John Deray whom they have previously investigated.\n\nVentura meets with Deray whom it turns out he already happens to know and had no idea he was a hitman. Deray conducts himself in an amiable manner and has no traits that betray his ruthless streak. He treats his line of work in a very business-like way and for the right price will kill anyone his client wishes. When Ventura gives him Brizard's name as the intended target Deray knows how tough it will be. Brizard is one of the best-protected men in the country living in a well-guarded mansion in Marseilles with his grown-up daughter Lucienne.\n\nDeray realises he must work his way into Brizard's clique in order to get close enough to dispose of him. Deray therefore proceeds to wile himself into the company of Brizard's voracious daughter by posturing himself as an endearing thrill-seeker calculated to appeal to her similar disposition. Deray thereby gains an invite to the Brizard Mansion as her companion.\n\nBrizard accepts Deray at face-value as his daughter's latest conquest but nevertheless makes some enquiries and finds out he works as a killer-for-hire. Brizard of course has no idea Deray is currently on-the-job and assumes he is in off-duty mode. Brizard decides to put him on his own payroll and Deray accepts the offer in order to remain close to his target while waiting for an opportunity to discharge his commission.\n\nBut Brizard has his own reasons for hiring Deray. He has fed bogus intelligence to the police about a shipment of drugs into the country and he sends Deray off to act as a fall guy to be caught by the police. Deray manages to evade capture and knows he cannot afford to underestimate Brizard again.\n\nMeanwhile Steve Ventura has been having second thoughts about the wisdom of hiring a hitman and realises he should have done the job himself rather than trusting a third-party. He heads to Marseille to make contact with Deray in order to call him off. But Deray refuses to cancel the contract out of professional pride although he does permit Ventura to accompany him. Brizard is staging a charity gala and Deray has learnt that Brizard has arranged to slip away from the event to personally supervise the arrival of a drug shipment.\n\nVentura and Deray observe the meeting in a rundown alley and Ventura is astonished to see Paris detective Inspector Briac present. Briac is heavily involved in the drugs operation and as events unfold he pulls a gun on Brizard intending to kill him in a double-cross and take the shipment for himself. He figures that Brizard's death will be blamed on the hitman Deray whom Briac sent his way via the fortuitous folly of the American Ventura. A gunfight ensues in which Deray and Ventura also become involved. Briac and Deray are both killed and Brizard gets away and returns to his gala.\n\nVentura is the only other survivor and he is determined not to let the drug kingpin get away scot-free yet again. He takes one of the fallen guns with a silencer attachment and heads off to gala venue. He asks a lone woman for a dance and manoeuvres them over to where Brizard is dancing with his daughter. Ventura then fires the gun from inside his pocket directly into the crimelord's back without providing any warning. No one notices the slight noise of the silenced weapon over the music and Ventura makes a quick exit as Brizard slumps to the ground dead in his daughter's arms. Ventura leaves town to head back to Paris feeling satisfied that an evil man is now out of the picture. Prologue: In 17th century Moldavia a high inquisition sentences Princess Asa of the House of Vajda to death for practicing witchcraft. Her own brother is her accuser. She and her accomplice Igor Javutich are branded as servants of the devil and now their vile deeds are to be punished by gruesome death. Ornate bronze devil masks studded on the inside with sharp spikes are to be hammered onto their faces and then their bodies burnt at the stake to cleanse the earth of their foulness. Before the sentence is carried out Asa curses her brother and all his future bloodline vowing that one day she will rise again and destroy his kin. The death sentence is carried out and the evildoers are executed by placement of the Masks of Satan. But just as their lifeless bodies are to be burnt a sudden eerie rainstorm extinguishes the flames. The full decree is never carried out and the still masked bodies of the abominable evildoers are instead interred - Javutich is buried in unconsecrated ground and Asa placed in a casket in the family crypt. As caution against any mystical resurrection the casket lid incorporates a glass window above her face through which she would see an anathematic stone cross standing sentinel over her, thwarting any would-be resurrection with its sacred power. End of prologue\n\nExactly two centuries later in the 1800s two doctors are travelling to a medical conference in Moscow by coach. They are medical professor Dr Thomas Kruvajan and his younger assistant Dr Andre Gorobec. As they are passing through some Moldavian woods, on their way to a local stopover inn, their coach throws a wheel. Whilst the coachman carries out repairs the two men wander off to explore a nearby ruined chapel. They find its underground crypt and discover to their amazement that it is the resting place of the witch Asa who is still part of local folklore. Through the intact casket glass window they see the mask still fastened to her head. Suddenly a bat flies around and as the professor lashes out to defend himself he hits the now ancient stone cross which collapses and shatters the glass. The professor inquisitively removes the mask from the corpse's face to find that the flesh underneath remains remarkably preserved with her pockmarked and eyeless face still recognisably human - he accidentally cuts his finger on some broken glass and a few drops of his blood fall onto Asa's face. Elsewhere in the coffin Andre finds a pictograph which contains strange pictures and writings which he keeps. Then the coachman tells them the wagon is repaired and they can continue their journey.\n\nOutside they meet a woman walking her dogs. She is the Princess Katia Vajda and this chapel is on her father's land. They assure her they meant no harm and were just looking around before they went on to the local inn. Andre is spellbound by Katia's compelling beauty and amazed by how much family resemblance she has to the dead witch in the coffin. The two men continue on their way to stay overnight at the inn. Meanwhile in the crypt the witch's body is beginning to reverse its decay with her eyes reforming!\n\nIn the castle Katia rejoins her brother Prince Constantine and their father Prince Vajda. Strange unexplained howling noises are heard from outside and above the fireplace the portrait of their notorious ancestor Princess Asa seems somehow to have changed as if it is no longer as it was painted. Katia has always felt unnerved by the picture and her own uncanny resemblance to the woman accused of being a witch two centuries afore. Prince Vajda has his own private concerns about this portentous day - the two hundredth anniversary of Asa's unholy demise when she had been but 21 years of age. The same age as is now attained by his beautiful and innocent daughter Katia. Vajda believes in the curse and thinks it is the reason that his family have fallen into decline over the years. His only comfort, as he makes his way to his bed, is a belief that the power of Christ's sacred cross will protect them from any stirring evil.\n\nIn the crypt Asa's body continues its restitution to the extent that the professor's drop of life-renewing blood will allow. She is still immotile but able to utter words to invoke the dark powers at her disposal. And in response to her call, life returns to the body of her former lover Igor Javutich and he rises from his grave and walks the Earth once more to do her bidding. Javutich enters the castle intent on killing Price Vajda. The old man is terrified by the deathly intruder but holds the attacker at bay with his cross. Javutich is forced to depart with his task unaccomplished leaving the old man merely in a state of shock when Katia rushes in to see why he cried out. Javutich listens in as he hears Katia send the house servant Boris to the local inn to fetch one of the doctors she met earlier.\n\nJavutich disposes of Boris and finds Professor Kruvajan who is taking a midnight stroll alone. Javutich represents himself as a servant of the royal family communicating the urgent summons for medical assistance. Kruvajan is easily lured into Javutich's carriage not suspecting anything amiss. Javutich takes the professor to the castle but instead of taking him to the prince's bedchamber leads him down a passage into the witch's crypt where her power overwhelmingly besets him and turns him into her dutiful undead minion.\n\nProfessor Kruvajan, now in the grip of his new evil mistress, presents himself to the royal family in answer to their medical summons. He declares that the elderly prince is merely in shock and needs rest and undertakes to sit with him through the night to ensure his wellbeing. But once alone the professor looks upon the prince with sinister intent...\n\nNext morning Katia and Constantine are shocked to find their father dead and the doctor nowhere to be seen. At the inn Andre looks for the professor and is surprised to be told by the innkeeper's daughter Sonja that she saw him being summonsed to the castle to attend the prince. Andre goes up to the castle and finds out the tragic overnight news but is perplexed by the strange unprofessional behaviour of his mentor in abandoning a patient and then vanishing in the night. Andre is worried for Professor Kruvajan's welfare. Then the villagers come up to the castle having found the body of Boris. Sonja is amongst them and when she looks at the various portraits hanging on the walls she announces with complete conviction that the man who fetched Professor Kruvajan from the village was the image of Igor Javutich. Andre finds it hard to believe her because the man shown in the painting has been dead for centuries.\n\nThe local priest begins preparations for Prince Vajda's funeral. Andre shows him the pictograph he took from the witch's casket and the priest says he will try to decipher the Cyrillic writings. Andre tries to comfort Katia to whom he feels a strong attraction. He tries to persuade her to leave this place with such unhappy memories but she tells him she is bound here by forces she does not understand to live out this purposeless existence.\n\nPrince Constantine accidentally discovers the entrance to a series of secret passageways behind the fireplace in the main hall. He and Andre go in to explore and find it leads to the same witch's crypt which Andre entered the previous night through the front entrance. The witch is still lying in state but her face is now fresh and reformed and they see she is not dead anymore but sleeping with breathing evident. Something clearly unnatural has occurred and Andre decides to go back and summon a priest to deal with it leaving Constantine to watch over the body. But after Andre has gone Constantine is attacked by Javutich and seemingly killed after a titanic struggle.\n\nAndre finds the priest who has now translated the inscriptions which give the method by which slaves of the devil may be released from their torment - by piercing the left eyeball with a knife and giving them eternal rest. This theory is soon tested when they encounter the undead resting body of Andre's colleague Professor Kruvajan and despatch him to a restful peace.\n\nAndre and the priest work out that the witch's power is growing stronger but her centuries' dead body cannot sustain her life for long - in order to completely renew her life she must possess the body of her look-alike descendant Katia. To stop that happening Andre must re-enter the witch's crypt and pierce her left eye while there is still time.\n\nMeanwhile back at the castle Javutich abducts Katia and brings her into the tomb so the witch can take over her perfect body and live once again to practice her evil. The witch considers the life of Katia to be hers by rights consecrated to her by Satan. That demonic bind was what prevented Katia from ever leaving the castle grounds. But then as Asa begins to assimilate Katia's life she is thwarted part way through the process when she finds the girl is wearing a crucifix which she cannot touch or her skin will burn. The half-completed transfer gives Asa more freedom of movement but she is unable to finalise it.\n\nWhen Andre enters the passages he is accosted by the witch's protector Javutich and almost killed until the badly injured Constantine manages to push the witch's evil accomplice to his death down a pit. The effort is too much for Constantine and he dies but in doing so he has given Andre a chance to save his sister's soul.\n\nWhen Andre arrives in the crypt he finds the witch prone in her coffin and Katia sitting nearby urging Andre to kill the witch quickly. But as Andre raises a knife to the left eye of the body lying there he sees it is wearing a crucifix which should burn her flesh were she really the profane witch. Andre realises that Asa has placed Katia in the casket hoping that Andre would mistakenly kill her. Now that the full body swap cannot take place Asa wanted the consolation of fulfilling her age-old edict of eradicating the Vajda bloodline. Now that too has failed the witch tries to subdue Andre with her hypnotic powers - but then she is overcome when a mob of villagers led by the priest rush in and drag her to a stake where they proceed to burn her - properly this time with no intervention from bad weather.\n\nWith the witch finally irrevocably dead and the curse lifted, Katia recovers to full health and no longer has any phobic fears about leaving as she and Andre kiss to cement their growing love for one another. Set in Italy in a previous century (1800s?). Leonardo is a rich Italian nobleman in his early 30s who finds ordinary life very dull and can only enliven his existence through pleasure seeking, drinking and gambling. He is a successful gambler and many of his neighbours are in debt to him, but despite the urging of his bookkeeper Viola he can never be bothered to collect. His latest winnings include the services of a troupe of travelling players that a local duke had hired for his son's birthday and put up as collateral in a losing bet.\n\nLeonardo lets the performance go ahead on his grounds since they have already encamped but finds the act dreary. That is until the leading lady comes on - she is called Iris and is 17-years-old. Leonardo finds her beauty remarkable and after she has finished he attempts to woo her expecting her to be easily overawed by the attentions of a man of his nobility. But instead she is wilful and speaks her mind telling him that she finds him an arrogant oaf who lacks even the good grace to have invited the boy whose birthday their show had been originally intended.\n\nNext day the travellers depart. Leonardo is reeling at her rebuff but cannot shake the feeling of attraction he felt towards her - however he knows that he has firmly squandered any chance of penetrating her negative judgement of his character. Leonardo decides his only hope is to resort to artifice and present himself in a different guise.\n\nHe visits a master craftsman called Elia whose trade is the making of disguises for masked balls. Leonardo purchases some of Elia's unique creations and then begins his pursuit of the fair Iris. He follows the trail of the travelling players' wagon and at their camp makes contact with Iris in the woods wearing the mask of a woodland elf. He represents himself as a mysterious and enigmatic denizen of the forest who speaks in serenely elegant tones. Iris is fascinated by the charismatic stranger who does not give his name and whose face she cannot see. Over the next few weeks he adopts various guises and although she knows it is always the same intriguing man she has no inkling it is Leonardo.\n\nShe falls in love with him despite never having seen his face and eventually they consummate their love in a gazebo by a lake. Then in the morning he has gone. Iris does not understand why he has abandoned her so unexpectedly.\n\nLeonardo has returned home disgusted at himself for taking advantage of the girl and blames the masks for corrupting him. He descends into a pit of despair and remains in bed wallowing in his shame. He eventually sees himself for what he has become and decides to reform and live up to his responsibilities as a nobleman and stop neglecting the upkeep of his estate. He writes a letter to Iris confessing to being the masked man and explaining why he did it. He says he loves her but knows that she finds him repulsive.\n\nAfter reading the letter Iris realises her initial judgement had been hasty and a soulful man lay beneath that brash exterior. She returns to his estate and forgives him for everything and as the film ends they kiss passionately. (In a prologue an old woman is seen walking through a forest and chancing upon a mysterious cowled figure in red robes who tells her that the time of their deliverance is at hand. This prophecy is passed on to her villagers as a hopeful sign that the days of misery under their evil ruler may be close to an end, however as the story progresses it is soon clear the man in red meant something entirely different ... )\n\nIt is medieval Europe and a feared ruler called Prince Prospero governs his province with a cruel lack of compassion taking pleasure in toying with his subjects' emotions as he wields life and death decisions over them on a whim. In the village of Catana (where the old woman from the prologue lives) wedding preparations are underway between a young woman called Francesca and her lover Gino when the Prince turns up wishing to feast among the villagers. Francesca's father and Gino speak out defiantly against his unwelcome presence and for their insolence Prospero orders them garrotted. Francesca begs for mercy and so the Prince, with an eye for some creative sadism, tells her that he will allow one of the men to live but she must decide which is to die. Francesca is frozen in a quandary for she dearly loves both men - one as her father and the other as her lover. To hopefully divert Prospero's focus away from playing out this particular cruel whim Gino goads him about the deliverance prophecy just as a scream is heard from a tent where the old woman lives - inside they discover the old woman's face has become crimson - a symptom which everyone recognises and fears as the scourge of the incurable Red Death! It is a disease which is deadly but fortunately only communicable by touch. The Prince orders the village burnt to the ground and, after establishing that they did not touch the woman, takes Francesca, Gino and Ludovico (Francesca's father) with him to his castle so he can continue his cruel games with them. He orders a quarantine lock-down of the castle such that no one may enter or leave until the plague has passed.\n\nOnce at the castle the two men are sent to the dungeons but Francesca is given the royal treatment and provided with grand quarters and fine dresses to wear although she is forbidden to wear her Christian crucifix - for the Prince considers God to be a long dead deity and worships instead a new master - The Devil. He believes his association with Satan will protect his castle from the pestilence of the Red Death. The Prince finds pleasure in his mastery over all and enjoys humiliating the noble men and women in his court forcing them to make abase fools of themselves at his whim. The Prince decides that there will be a Masque costume ball the following day although forbids the wearing of red.\n\nIn the dungeons Gino and Ludovico have been trained to fight each other to the death - but they refuse to fight and the matter is decided when Ludovico makes a lunge for the Prince and is killed. The surviving Gino is then ejected from the castle to survive amidst the devastated communities hit by the Red Death. Later, under cover of darkness, Gino climbs back into the castle intent on rescuing Francesca - but on the parapet he meets the stranger in the red robes who tells him to wait there.\n\nThe Masque is in full swing and the Prince is pleased with the entertainment until he sees the stranger dressed in crimson and believes it to be a guest who is wearing red against his express command. He follows the stranger into a side room and confronts him but soon realises that he is addressing a supernatural being and believes his Lord Satan has come to personally speak to him. But when the stranger shows his face it is that of Prince Prospero himself and the stranger reveals he is a Messenger of Death who bears the face of the one about to die. Prospero becomes infected with the Red Death as do all the partygoers in the grand hall and everybody dies except for Francesca and Gino who are spared the pestilence because their souls were not corrupt.\n\nThe Red Stranger makes his way back to the forest and rejoins his brethren - other Messengers of Death similarly dressed in various different coloured robes as they swap notes on how many they have killed and then move on to another area to harvest. Set in 1944 in German-occupied Rome during the Second World War. The Germans have a measured military presence in Rome which is under their military control although they allow the Italian politicians to remain in nominal charge of day-to-day governance. General Kurt Maelzer is in overall charge of the German occupation although he is rankled by the need to negotiate compromises with the Italians when he would much prefer to rule with an iron fist. Unfortunately he does not have the manpower at his disposal to enforce such a crackdown because the best troops are needed on the frontline in a war that is going badly. So the best he can do is have a platoon of men march through the streets every day as a show of force.\n\nHowever, the Italian partisans find any level of German presence provocative and do everything they can to make life difficult for the occupying forces. Their latest deed is to decimate the German platoon by exploding a bomb as the soldiers march past. Thirty-two German soldiers are killed and General Maelzer is incandescent with fury at this outrage. He wants to take immediate retaliatory action by laying waste to a whole city block but he finds that his officers and superiors are wary of taking such disproportionate action. The SS head of security Lt Col Herbert Kappler is mindful that such a response would be viewed as a war crime if Germany were to lose the war which he believes is seeming likely. He counsels that they should adhere to the rules of the Haig Convention which allows fair reprisals to be carried out for actions against occupying forces. Maelzer reluctantly agrees and settles on a figure of 10 Italian executions for every dead German. He gives Kappler the task of compiling the list of the 320 who are to die and then carrying out the executions.\n\nKappler finds the nature of his task utterly repellent but he has no choice but to accede. In an effort to assuage his guilt he wants to be sure that the list should only contain the names of contemptible men who are already the dregs of Italian society including those in prison convicted of serious crimes. Even then it is hard to find enough names to fill the quota and Kappler is forced to resort to filling up the shortfall with Jews.\n\nAn Italian priest called Father Pietro Antonelli becomes involved when the partisans seek sanctuary in his institute. Antonelli goes to see Kappler to try and persuade him to cancel the planned slaughter while he makes an appeal to the Pope to intervene. But Kappler can do nothing - the decision has been made and he is merely a cog in the machine carrying out the orders of his superiors.\n\nKappler briefs his officers and men about the heinous task they have been handed. The site selected for the executions is in some caves where the limestone will quickly help with the decomposition of the bodies. The executions will be done in an efficient production line manner with each officer being obliged to personally pull the trigger at least once using a handgun to the back of the prisoner's head as they kneel.\n\nFather Antonelli fails to get the Pope to intervene because the Holy Father is concerned about jeopardising ongoing negotiations for the salvation of Rome when the Germans pull out. Father Antonelli feels powerless at his inability to stop the massacre and so he joins the line of condemned men being led into the caves and disposes himself for execution. As it happens Kappler is the one set to deliver the fatal bullet to Antonelli. The priest turns and gives Kappler a long judgemental stare daring him to examine his conscience and refuse to kill him. But Kappler has been put into an impossible situation and has no choice but to pull the trigger and kill the honourable priest. Set in Turkey in 1923 where Abdi Aga is the owner of a small peasant village that he rules as his own personal kingdom, collecting taxes and dishing out his own brand of justice. He is a hated man although none will openly defy him for he has the militia under his command.\n\nCurrently Abdi Aga's concern is with a young local man called Memed who is causing him grief on a number of fronts. Memed is disdainful of his leadership and even worse he is the sweetheart of beautiful village girl Hatche whom Abdi has decided will be wed to his imbecilic slob of a nephew.\n\nMemed and Hatche have been friends and then sweethearts all their lives and they decide to run off together to avoid the differing fates Abdi has in mind for them both. But Abdi is not about to let them go so easily and employs a tracker called Lame Ali to follow them. Memed and Hatche are eventually pinned down on a mountainside and Memed's only option is to shoot it out as Abdi and his nephew approach mistakenly thinking their quarry are weaponless and surrendered. Abdi's nephew is killed and Memed escapes - but Hatche surrenders herself unable to cope with the pressure of being on the run.\n\nMemed has previously made contact with a band of brigands in the mountain region led by a man called Mad Durdu. Meanwhile Abdi decides that since he did not capture Memed he will instead place Hatche on trial for his nephew's murder and swears to a magistrate that he personally saw her fire the gun that killed him. No one dares dispute his evidence and so Hatche is held in custody pending a full murder trial. Memed does not yet know of this development as he joins in the banditry and thieving activities associated with being a brigand. However he soon finds Mad Durdu's barbaric ways too much to bear and leaves the rebel group.\n\nMemed blames Abdi for all his troubles vows to kill him. He makes an unsuccessful attempt on Abdi's life whilst he is staying in a nearby town and Abdi consequently seeks sanctuary with a powerful and wealthy landowner called Ali Safa. Abdi suggests that they move Hatche to a more secure location lest Memed attempt to liberate her. Although ironically her transfer under inadequate armed escort provides Memed with the ideal opportunity to act and Hatche is rescued.\n\nThe Turkish government has declared a general amnesty towards brigands because of the mounting cost of countering their resistance. Locally however, area governors seize upon this as an opportunity to arrest the rebel ringleaders and they have drawn up their own secret \"exception\" list should those individuals come forward during the amnesty. Memed is considering utilising the amnesty but he is fortunately forewarned it is a trap by a police sergeant called Asim who has decided to join with him. Together they hunt down the location of Abdi Ali in town and Memed shoots him decisively dead. The villagers who had been subject to Abdi's harsh rule celebrate his demise and the freedom they believe they now have. The story breaks off here with things appearing to have reached a positive note for all - although it is unclear whether their happiness is misplaced or will be short-lived as they will soon have a new more powerful ruler to deal with in the shape of Ali Safa who is quick to appropriate Abdi's properties into his own small but burgeoning empire. Set in an English city in the aftermath of some sort of war that has devastated the normal infrastructure of society. City dwellers are left to fend for themselves with utility services suspended or sporadic. Rubbish is piled up in the streets and food is scarce leading to scavenging. Looting is rife and law and order is virtually non-existent. Most people nevertheless maintain themselves according to the responsible good order they once knew and continue with their everyday lives as best as they can as they readjust to the diminished amenities. This includes a woman known as \"D\" who lives in a block of flats. She lives alone and conducts herself in an ordered fashion as she goes about her daily routine of collecting standpipe water and maintaining her day-to-day existence. She is one of the few who still remain in her tower as many other city dwellers have abandoned the area.\n\nOne day D hears voices from one of her walls and finds that she can pass through it into a large Victorian mansion which is unoccupied and being decorated. (It is unclear if her transportation is real or just in her imagination - perhaps a sign of encroaching madness?)\n\nBack in the real world D finds herself billeted an evacuee called Emily Cartwright when she and her escort mysteriously turn up out of the blue in her living room. D is given no chance to question the man who delivers her before he is just as mysteriously gone. Emily is a bright and cheerful teenage schoolgirl who is eager to help D around the house.\n\nMeanwhile D continues to explore the mansion (in her mind's eye it sometimes seems) and each time she visits things seems to have moved on a bit until it is furnished and occupied by a family. The young daughter of the family is a 7(ish) year old girl called Emily who always looks a bit sad and appears to be neglected by her parents for being so difficult and demanding. On later visits D finds the house unoccupied and neglected with the place trashed and weeds encroaching into the house.\n\nMeanwhile back in the present Emily takes up with a group of youths and children who have started a commune at an ex-old people's home and live off the land. Their leader is a young man called Gerald who has a kind heart with a willingness to see good in everybody and take them into his small community. Emily joins and becomes his girlfriend and soon finds herself as the mother figure of the group whom all the little ones respect and look up to as she finds herself having to take a firm hand. In contrast, respect for Gerald's authority begins to wane as he starts to make poor choices. His well-meaning open door policy starts to cause problems with more mouths to feed than the community can support.\n\nSeveral times Emily leaves the group in despair and returns to the security of D's flat and each time she is persuaded back by her new friends to give the community another chance because they need her. Finally Gerald goes too far and brings home a group of ragamuffin young kids that have become like savages living in the underground stations. With no one to look after them they have turned wild and feral but Gerald believes that if they are shown kindness and generosity they can be tamed - but instead they run amok and destroy everything the community has worked so hard to build up.\n\nEmily returns to D's flat with her optimism shattered. Meanwhile D's dreamlike explorations have shown her the idyllic mansion gardens and inside the house a huge egg around which she sees lots of young children playing. She takes this as some sort of sign and shows Emily and Gerald how to get through. Gerald fetches the ragamuffin children and leads them back into the simpler past era where they can live in the bountiful garden - and finally D follows them. Set in the dukedom of Theseus in Athens in times past in the run up to a wedding between Theseus and his bride-to-be Hippolyta. Nobleman Egeus wishes his daughter Hermia to marry Demetrius and he is keen to do so. However Hermia is not so keen for she loves Lysander. But Egeus insists it must be Demetrius and so Hermia and Lysander plan to run off together. Hermia's friend Helena has strong feelings for Demetrius too but feels jaded that he only has eyes for her prettier friend. Helena decides to tell Demetrius about Hermia and Lysander's secret plans to elope hoping he will be grateful to her. This results in all four making their way to the forest grove that night.\n\nThe forest is inhabited by the fairy folk on a plane of existence not visible to humans and they use their magic to help the humans with good deeds. Currently fairy king Oberon and fairy queen Titania have fallen out over who should have guardianship of a particular servant boy. Oberon decides to enspell Titania with a potion that will make her fall in love with the first person she sees upon waking - he believes with her attention diverted thus he can appropriate the boy from her.\n\nOberon's servant Puck sees some actors rehearsing for a play in the woods and is so appalled at the oafish Bottom's performance that he turns the man's head into an ass. Bottom's friends run off in fear and Bottom wanders off. He stumbles across sleeping Titania who awakens and the enchantment makes her fall in love with him. She becomes totally infatuated with Bottom and finds his every utterance enthralling as she dotes upon his every need.\n\nMeanwhile Oberon sees the plight of the four humans and decides to lend a hand by making Demetrius fall in love with Helena using some of the potion. He gives this task to his servant Puck who gets it wrong and makes Lysander fall for Helena instead. Later Demetrius too is enchanted and both men become infatuated by Helena and ignore their previous preference to Hermia. Helena thinks they are all treating her with derision by playing a scornful jest upon her. Hermia too cannot understand the behaviour of either men and the whole situation becomes unbearable with everyone falling out with one another.\n\nEventually Oberon sees what a mess his servant has made of his good intentions and sends the foursome to sleep so they will wake and believe it was all a dream. When they awaken remnants of the night before remain. Lysander and Hermia love one another once again, but Demetrius now sees Helena in a new light and relinquishes his claim upon Hermia in preference to Helena. The duke decrees"
