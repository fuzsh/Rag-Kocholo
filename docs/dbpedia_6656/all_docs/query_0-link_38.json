        "text": "Wilbur Gray is an author who specialises in writing books that uncover fantastical unsuspected theories about unexplained events. He has just completed the research on his latest book and the implications of his discovery have made him very nervous and jumpy. He takes his manuscript to his publisher Frank Richards who is very sceptical and asks him to talk him through the details of three of his case studies ...\n\nCase 1 - London 1912\n\nElderly Miss Malkin has decided to change her will to disinherit her ungrateful nephew Michael and leave her fortune to her dozens of beloved cats instead. The maid Janet overhears her new arrangement and tells Michael with whom she is having a relationship. Michael persuades Janet to steal the new will from the safe. But Miss Malkin catches Janet in the act and Janet has to kill the old woman when she threatens to call the police. But before Janet can destroy the new will the cats turn on her and eventually kill her after subjecting her to several days of terror. Days later Michael and the police find the two bodies which have been half-eaten by the cats. Michael sees the new will and tries to destroy it but the cats kill him as well. (It is believed the cats became murderous because they were so hungry).\n\nCase 2 - Quebec Province 1975\n\nNewly orphaned youngster Lucy comes to live with her aunt Joan's family. She brings her beloved pet cat Wellington, much to Aunt Joan's annoyance because she dislikes cats. Joan's own daughter Angela is a bit older than Lucy and mercilessly bullies her believing it's not fair that Lucy is allowed to have a cat when she is not. Lucy's mother was into witchcraft and the distressed girl uses her old books to cast a spell that shrinks Angela to mouse size so that Wellington can terrorise her instead. Then Lucy steps on little-Angela and squashes her dead like a bug. (Angela's disappearance is never solved).\n\nCase 3 - Hollywood 1936\n\nValentine De'ath is movie actor in horror films. His wife is the leading lady but she is tragically killed when a medieval torture stunt goes wrong. In fact Valentine had rigged the accident so that he could replace his wife with his new young mistress Edina in both the film and his personal life. At home Valentine tries to get rid of his wife's cat Scat but the cat proves elusive and a battle of wills commences. The cat seems to haunt Valentine who becomes obsessed with its destruction until eventually whether by accident or design the cat's actions cause the death of Edina and Valentine. (The deaths go unexplained).\n\nBack in the present - Wilbur's conclusion is that the common factor in all these unsolved cases is the cats. Wilbur adamantly believes that man has been fooled by these seemingly aloof and innocent creatures who are welcomed into homes as pets where they listen and observe without really being noticed. It is Wilbur's postulation that cats are the true masters who always get their way in the end with patience, cunning and guile. Wilbur leaves his documents with Richards to read and on his way home he is attacked and killed by a mob of cats (evidently to make sure he doesn't reveal to the world the secret truth he has discovered). And back at Richards' house the publisher decides it's all nonsense and puts the manuscript on the fire under the watchful gaze of his own pet cat whom Richards dotes upon. A young high-class prostitute called Nicole is abducted from her house by some masked intruders whose faces are covered because underneath they have grotesque deformities. This leads to a retired operative called Roy Bain being recalled by his former crime boss Hugo Motherskille who now claims to be working legitimately as an industrialist. Although Bain is reluctant to resume his former line of work, Nicole is a former friend of his and Motherskille uses this connection to persuade him to apply his considerable skills in trying and find her.\n\nBain checks the girl's bedroom and discovers a vial of white powder beneath her pillow - he follows a lead to a Doctor Savary but meets with a dead end when the doctor refuses to discuss the matter. Meanwhile we see Nicole has been captured by a group of people who all have facial abnormalities and among them is a scientist called Nygaard. They are all addicted to a drug they call \"White Man\" which gives one a euphoric feeling and provides incredible dreams but has the side effect of over time creating gruesome deformities. Nicole is also an addict and Nygaard is running tests on her to try and establish why she is uniquely immune to the ravages that the others have all fallen victim to.\n\nBain sneaks into Savary's office at night and finds a file explaining more about the drug. Savary catches him at it and holds him at gunpoint while he explains that the drug called Lactrus Iozinine which he invented is powerfully hallucinogenic but is also highly addictive and has unpredictable side effects. By the time this deficiency was identified it was too late for those already addicted and they are now totally reliant on him for more supplies. He was obsessed by the prostitute Nicole who had the ability to make dreams seem real and so he made her an addict so she would become dependant on him but curiously she remained untouched by the side effects. Savary intends to now inject Bain to make him reliant on him too but Bain manages to get away.\n\nBain sees one of the \"creatures\" flee down a manhole and follows discovering that they live underground - he is soon captured by the other Underworlders who are not pleased that their lair has been discovered - but Nicole speaks up for him and prevents him from harm although he remains as their prisoner.\n\nOne of Motherskille's flunkeys called Fluke who was following Bain reports back to his boss that the lair has been found. Motherskille had not been interested in Nicole and had wanted Bain to find the Underworlders' lair for him so he could annihilate them. The Underworlders are running out of the drug and they go to Savary to get some more - but Motherskille's men are laying in wait to ambush them and a gunfight ensues. Bain manages to free himself and joins the fight on the side of the Underworlders.\n\nMotherskille and his villains are eventually all killed including Savary within whom Nicole induces a dream so powerful that it causes him to self-combust. Bain wants her to come with him back to the surface but she tells him her work here has only just begun and with one surviving Underworlder she takes her leave and returns into the maze of tunnels and Bain returns alone to the surface. Ryker is a military consultant who in his recent past has worked as a mercenary in war torn trouble spots around the world and has seen a lot of action. Two years ago he retired from the profession but has been lured back for another job with the promise of a large pay-day by an exiled black African leader called Mbote living in the UK who wants to arm the revolutionaries in his county. Ryker's task will be to advise on the weaponry to buy and then go out and train Mbote's men in their use with his team of white mercenaries including his good friend Jesse Jones.\n\nRyker completes the first part of his job as they visit the UK's largest arms manufacturer and purchase guns and military equipment. As for the export licence Mbote says he has that \"in hand\" and the lorry loads of arms are driven to the docks awaiting shipment. But the experience of being around and testing weaponry again has brought back deep scarred memories for Ryker and reminded him just why he retired in the first place - he no longer has the stomach for the butchery of war and the horrors that he's seen done on innocents in the pursuit of a war leader's political aims. So without telling anyone his plans Ryker departs the scene and rents a small suburban flat in London determined to live a normal life. He goes to a party with his landlady and there he meets a young girl called Chrissie and they start a relationship in which he begins to be content and happy and seems to have found the sort of life that he really wants.\n\nBut his friend Jesse has no idea what's happened to him and is having problems with Mbote's people - they are demanding Ryker complete on the deal he agreed to and won't tolerate any excuses. Jesse manages to track down Ryker's whereabouts and warns him that Mbote's men will be able to do the same if he doesn't show up for a meeting the next day when the arms shipments are ready to leave.\n\nSo that night Ryker and Jesse take pre-emptive action and hijack the lorries from the docks and hold them to ransom to firmly indicate to Mbote that they are no longer interested in dealing with him. Mbote \"buys\" back the arms for a ransom and the two friends depart. But Mbote's men have tracked them down and later as they are walking by a roadside a limousine pulls up and two shots are fired at them. (This is the final moment and the shots are heard over a freeze frame of the two men and then the end credits roll - so it is not clear if they are hit/killed or not). John Ebony is a young married man who has decided to change careers and become a schoolteacher. His first position is at the Chantry Boys Boarding School where he is filling in for the remainder of the current term following the tragic death of a schoolmaster called Mr Pellam. The school is situated near the sea and Mr Pellam had accidentally fallen down the cliff while out hill walking.\n\nJohn moves into a nearby cottage with his wife Silvia as he prepares to take over Pellam's class of fifth form boys which he is told is one of the most difficult in the school. John is determined to make a good impression and bring them to order. However whilst being superficially good-mannered, the boys display a staunch group solidarity when he tries to lay down any new rules or punishments. Their defiance takes a sinister turn when they tell John that if he doesn't do things their way he will suffer a similar fate to the late Mr Pellam whom they claim to have murdered. John thinks they are making it up and are just wickedly exploiting an unfortunate accident to try and spook him - but the boys supply sufficient detail that he starts to believe them and he falls into line with how they want the lessons to be conducted along with other such requirements such as putting bets on for them at the bookmakers.\n\nHowever he is just playing along whilst he tries to find out who the ringleader was. He attempts to put pressure on individuals into telling him more but he finds it impossible to penetrate their inscrutability. When he is told by the headmaster that his contract won't be extended into the next term he decides they are not worth it and gives up on the boys completely letting them run riot during lessons as he reads his newspaper and refuses to do their errands.\n\nThe boys decide to teach him a lesson by threatening his wife and they put her through a terrifying ordeal with the horrifying prospect of a gang rape which she only narrowly averts. Only one boy called Wittering seems appalled at what was being contemplated. He is the weakest boy in the class who is a bit backward academically and subject to bullying by the other boys.\n\nThe next day Wittering has gone missing and the remaining boys appeal to John to help them find him. John is furious at them for what they put his wife through but they seem to be so dolefully desperate for his help and full of concern that Wittering will tell someone about Pellam's murder that John agrees to help them search because he still wants to learn the truth of whose idea the murder was. Wittering's body is found at the foot of the cliffs with a suicide note explaining that it was he who had proposed the idea to kill the strict and sarcastic Mr Pellam. He did this as a way of impressing his classmates and gaining their respect and although they all carried it out he takes full responsibility for giving them the idea to do it. This is where the film ends with John finding that knowing who suggested the murder has actually gained him no greater understanding of what actually made them do it. Dave Kelly is a clean-cut Australian singer who arrives in England on a passenger liner hoping to make it big. He also has ambitions to meet and marry the famous poster model Melissa who is \"Everybody's Dream Girl\". His first task is to find an agent and he goes to the offices of Wilkinson, Doherty and Lever telling them he would like to become a rich and successful entertainer. Dave sings for Mr Lever who assesses his pop star potential using an array of scientific measuring gadgets and a teenage girl whose level of scream is a vital indicator. The results show that Dave's singing was passable but he needs to come up with a new sound. Mr Lever tells Dave he will call him if something comes up.\n\nWhile he is waiting for the call Dave looks for somewhere to live. He finds a letting agent called Harry King who tasks his beautiful daughter Patsy with showing Dave around the possible accommodation flats in his portfolio. Unknown to his daughter, Harry is criminally inclined and he and his associates are preparing for a robbery. One of King's empty properties is situated above a jeweller's shop and while it is closed on a Saturday their plan is to break into it from the floor above and steal £2million pounds worth of diamonds from the safe.\n\nBut just as they are ready to begin they realise that Pasty has let that very flat to Dave Kelly. And Dave is staying in all day so he won't miss any calls from Mr Lever. King thinks fast and tells his daughter to persuade Dave to go out with her and see the sights. And big-hearted King tells Dave he will flat-sit for him and take any phone messages. Dave and Patsy enjoy a pleasant afternoon out together and a romantic association develops. The only thing coming between them is Dave's highly motivated ambition to be a star which for him is more important than any other consideration.\n\nMeanwhile King and his men break through the floorboards into the shop below and start trying to crack the safe. Dave and Patsy come back before they are finished and to get rid of them again King pretends Dave's agent Mr Lever called and offered Dave a gig at a rich debutante's coming out ball (which he had just read about in the newspaper). Dave rushes to attend and discovers the debutante is none other than dream girl Melissa Smythe-Fury. Because Dave is not expected he is considered a gatecrasher and made to wash the dishes but afterwards he dances with Melissa. Unfortunately he finds her to be very toffee-nosed with no interest in him whatsoever. Back at the shop Dave and his gang eventually find out the safe contained only an old library book and the shopkeeper always took his entire stock home with him every night.\n\nThen it gets surreal:- Dave returns home and finds the hole in his floor. He climbs down and is arrested by the police as a suspect. He runs for it and is shot and wounded. He then staggers into a house which turns out to be a court presided over by Mr Lever. Dave is accused of being arrogantly self-centred without a single redeeming feature - although Dave claims that isn't true because he's got good teeth. Dave is found guilty and when asked if he has anything to say before sentence is passed he sings a song. He is sent to prison until he gets a message from Pasty and he is let out and they get married. Dave is now a member of the King family and he leads a market singsong of Waltzing Matilda as the film ends. Lurcio is a slave in ancient Pompeii of 79AD who works in the household of Senator Ludicrus Sextus and his wife Ammonia. As the story begins Lurcio is at the market purchasing supplies for Ludicrus' orgy that evening when he has a run in with a newly arrived Roman centurion called Captain Bilius and certain belongings of the two men get mixed up. When Lurcio gets back to his kitchens he finds a scroll amongst his shopping and puts it to one side not knowing what it is.\n\nBilius is an emissary of Emperor Nero but is secretly plotting against him and meets with his ally, the pro-consul of Pompeii Prosperus Maximus. Bilius says he has a scroll containing a list of 100 important Romans who will support a revolt and proclaim Maximus as the new emperor once Nero is dead. But as Bilius gets out his scroll it turns out instead to be a cucumber! Bilius realises what happened and organises a hunt for the slave he bumped into in the market who must have the scroll which if it were to fall into the wrong hands would make all the conspirators' lives forfeit.\n\nMeanwhile Lurcio's master Ludicrous is to give an important speech at the senate and before leaving he comes to the kitchens to talk to his slave and puts down the scroll containing his speech and then inadvertently takes the unopened Bilius' scroll instead when he departs. Bilius soon tracks Lurcio down and recovers his scroll until he realises it is the wrong one. He hopes to get it back from Ludicrous but the senator has already read it and realises there is a conspiracy afoot involving the pro-consul.\n\nLudicrous visits Maximus to insist he resign but the pro-consul has anticipated this move and has asked his glamorous wife to seduce Ludicrous when he arrives so that Maximus can catch them \"at it\" and kill Ludicrous on the pretext of protecting his wife's honour. But Lurcio has discovered this plan to kill his master and substitutes himself at the critical moment and the angry Maximus throws him into prison slated for execution.\n\nEmperor Nero arrives at Pompeii and for some entertainment suggests that Maximus pit a fighter against his ferocious champion, Gorgo. Not wishing to anger Nero by beating him Maximus selects the weedy condemned slave Lurcio to fight on his behalf. But against the odds Lurcio wins and becomes Nero's new champion. Nero sends Lurcio to some steam baths to pre-emptively assassinate Maximus whom he knows is plotting his downfall. At the same time Lurcio is told to assassinate Nero by Maximus on pain of death if he refuses. And both parties plan that their henchmen should murder Lurcio as a political assassin once he has done the deed. But the henchmen end up accidentally killing each other in the hazy obscurity of the steam room.\n\nFinally as Ludicrous is about to expose Maximus in a senate speech the nearby mount Vesuvius erupts and everyone in Pompeii is killed forever frozen by death in their final actions as witnessed many centuries later when a tour guide is showing some visitors around the historical site. In the middle of the 12th century a baby boy is born to good Queen Anne. But a wicked and ambitious baron called Sir Braggart de Bombast opposes the succession and quickly orders the baby be taken from its nurse and abandoned in the forest to die. However the queen unexpectedly has twins and the baron is unable to repeat the deed with the second child. This baby grows up the become King Richard I known as the Lionheart. The forsaken baby did not die however and was found by a sow pig who sustained him until he was found and adopted into the household of Sir Coward De Custard where he was named Lurkalot. No one, not even himself, knew his royal origins and Lurkalot grew up to be a serf in Sir Coward's castle.\n\nIt is now 40 years later in 1197. King Richard is away in the Holy Lands fighting in the Crusades where he has been ever since he turned from boy to man. Lurkalot remains a lowly servant whose background remains a mystery to him. Lurkalot has an inventive mind and one of his most useful and marketable inventions is a line of chastity belts worn by women to ensure they remain chaste while their menfolk are away at the Crusades. Sir Coward allows Lurkalot certain latitude because the income from his products is the only thing that keeps the castle going. But even that is not enough and Sir Coward is in a financial pickle.\n\nSir Braggart wants to buy Sir Coward's castle and land to increase his own power and influence but Sir Coward proudly refuses to sell. The two noblemen then come to blows over the matter of their respective royal allegiances - Coward is loyal to absent King Richard, but Braggart is a supporter of the king's upstart brother Prince John. A joust is held between their respective champions to settle a matter of honour and although Sir Coward's champion Lurkalot is victorious using his new invention of a magnet, Sir Braggart claims victory because Lurkalot was an ineligible competitor not being of noble birth. Sir Braggart takes possession of Sir Coward's beautiful daughter Lobelia for his letch, but before she is handed over Lurkalot makes sure she is fitted with his most impregnable chastity belt for which he has the only key.\n\nWhen Sir Braggart finds out how he has been fettered he lays siege to Castle Coward to get the key from Lurkalot. But the wily serf uses his new invention of flying wings to soar over the soldiers and escape. Lurkalot decides he must go to the Holy Land and persuade King Richard to return and restore order. But when he arrives in the hot desert land he discovers the reason why the Crusades are so popular with noblemen. The Saracen leader Saladin has set up a paradise centre where every vice imaginable can be satisfied. The brave English knights live it up in a pleasure den of wine and women whilst sending back to England made-up reports of all the fierce fighting that is going on. Lurkalot finds King Richard and is struck by how similar in appearance are he and the king. He tries to tell the king how important it is he return immediately to England. But the king is an ardent hedonist who has been enjoying the pleasures of the flesh for the last twenty years and has no desire to return to England whilst an inexhaustible supply of pretty girls are on hand. Lurkalot decides he must do something drastic to frustrate Richard's complacent contentment, so he manufactures a batch of his impregnable chastity belts and gets all the harem women to wear them. With his fun sequestered King Richard reluctantly agrees to accompany Lurkalot back to England. But it is slow going because Richard cannot resist gallivanting with all the local European lasses along the way and in Germany their journey comes to a lusty halt when Richard finds an irresistible fräulein and stymies Lurkalot's efforts to move on. Richard tells Lurkalot that since they look uncannily alike Lurkalot should go back to England alone and pretend to be him if he thinks it is so important for the king to return.\n\nSo Lurkalot assumes Richard's identity and accoutrements and arrives back in England full of grandiose expectations of welcome. But unfortunately Richard has been away so long no one remembers what he looks like and no one believes Lurkalot is the king. Instead he is accused of being a witch and put to the flame in a burning. Fortunately he is rescued by the famous outlaw Robin Hood and his Merrie Men.\n\nRobin Hood and his men are not the indomitable men of legend but a fay assortment more interested in their immaculate appearances than rough and tumble activities - although they occasionally practice a bit of do-gooding on the side. Robin agrees to help Lurkalot take back Castle Coward from the evil Sir Braggart who has still not managed to overcome Lobelia's chastity belt despite engaging countless locksmiths. Lurkalot is joined by the exiled Sir Coward and together they manage to sneak into the castle and get to Lurkalot's laboratory. Whilst seeking inspiration on how to open the portcullis for Robin's men to storm the castle, Lurkalot accidentally invents gunpowder. This wondrous powder proves decisive in achieving victory over the evil baron who finally reveals to Lurkalot the truth about his royal heritage and that he is the king's older twin brother.\n\nOrder is established and the real King Richard returns after his fräulein's angry husband arrived back home in Germany and Richard was forced to flee. King Richard bestows a knighthood on Lurkalot and awards himself the hand of fair Lobelia. On their wedding night Lobelia regrets she is still wearing the unconquerable chastity belt. But all is well because King Richard is actually Lurkalot and he has the key. The real King Richard was happy to secretly exchange places with his brother, who is in any event the rightful king, so he can return to the Holy Land and continue having fun. Polly Dean is a young woman from the rich side of London who has decided that she wants nothing to do with the privileged lifestyle she was brought up in and wants instead to live an \"ordinary\" life. She goes to Battersea and gets a job in a sweet packing factory where she finds the no-holds barred gossip and banter among the working class women workers a delight. Her cultured accent immediately marks her out as someone out of place and her co-workers find it hard to figure out what she could possibly be doing here. But she does make some friends in two sisters called Rube and Sylvie who show her the ropes and accept her into their circle of friends.\n\nPolly decides to move to the area and gets a small flat and buys some furniture from a second hand shop where she meets Peter the shopkeeper's assistant who helps take her purchases home. He is a pleasant and genuine young man with a nice, easygoing manner and when he tentatively asks her out, fully expecting her to decline since he realises she's way out of his league, she accepts. She shows off her new apartment to Rube and Sylvie and they can hardly believe how dingy it is - even they live better than that although they try to be polite.\n\nShe goes out with Peter, but rather than let him take her somewhere up in town she just wants to wander around the streets looking at the views which she thinks are beautiful but he just sees as dirty rows of old houses that no one really wants to live in. She explains to him she wants to be happy with the simple things in life with no pre-decided life all set out for her in advance by rich parents. She finds the lives of the rich hypocritical and disgusting and no longer wants any part of it and from now on will spend only what she earns.\n\nTheir relationship progresses and they become more serious and Peter asks Polly away for the weekend. He wants to impress her and hires an expensive sports car and takes her to the finest hotel and restaurant and really pampers her although she tells him she'd much rather have kept things cheap and simple. They spend the night together and declare their love for each other.\n\nNext morning they have a row when they discuss marriage and although delighted by the prospect she tells him he would have to get a better job if they did. He finds her comments strange because he knows she must have money behind her and when they are married she can stop this pretending and they can go and live somewhere nice. But she tells him she means it about wanting to live an ordinary life - it is not some sort of game she's playing and she has no wish to live like a parasite or to marry one - she believes money destroys people and she wants no part of it. He just cannot understand her attitude because the lifestyle she has turned her back on is the very thing he aspires to - there is no suggestion that he's a money-grabbing opportunist but he wants to be comfortable enough to take the sweat out of life and move away from the slums of London. He thinks she is selfish to do nothing with her money when she could be spending it to help people and make them happy. He storms out and drives off in the sports car.\n\nOn the way home he is stopped by the police for speeding and it turns out he stole the car and did not hire it after all. He is given six months in prison for motor theft. Polly attends court for she still loves him and after he is sentenced she asks him why he did it for she'd have much rather have gone by bus - and he tells her that that's her trouble - and we leave the story as she is crying, watching the prison van taking him away. Set in the United States starting at about 1919. Rudolph Valentino had come to the United States as an Italian immigrant with ambitions of becoming a landscape gardener after getting the necessary diplomas. However his handsome good looks and skill at dancing made him ideal in the role of a ballroom gigolo working at establishments where matronly women paid to dance with and be flattered by a good-looking young man.\n\nRulpolph Valentino (Rudi) falls in love with a young woman called Bianca De Saulles who had been an immigrant like himself and they want to get married. Unfortunately she is already married to a powerful and violent man called Jack De Saulles who is insanely jealous if she talks to other men although he himself has many mistresses. Rudi tries to help her get proof of his infidelity so she can sue him for divorce. But Jack sends his hoodlums round to beat Rudi up and show his conniving wife that she cannot hope to defy him. Bianca is so distraught that she shoots Jack dead.\n\nRudi loses his job over the ensuing scandal and moves on to work in a dance hall cabaret act where he and his female-impersonating male partner perform a comic dance routine where \"she\" is an intentionally poor dancer. It is at one of these performances that Rudi meets Jean Acker who is a starlet in the newfangled movie business. She tells Rudi how she was plucked from obscurity and now lives a champagne lifestyle for acting in movies where they can't even hear your voice. The glitz and glamour appeal to Rudi's sense of showmanship. Jean and Rudi get married and she introduces him to the movie business and he gets a few small parts in some films at an independent studio. The marriage proves a disaster and the couple soon go their separate ways but Rudi's screen performances come to the attention of June Mathis who is a producer at a big Hollywood studio. She recognises his potential and offers him a contract.\n\nValentino quickly becomes a huge star of romantic melodramas with women everywhere idolising his smouldering screen presence. Rudi is not grandiose about his success and is just placidly grateful to be doing something he likes. But then he meets and falls in love with set designer Natasha Rambova who pushes him to become more ambitious. She thinks he is wasting his talent working for a studio and should have a greater say in his own films. Rudi therefore asks the studio head for a huge pay rise and script approval. This is steadfastly refused so Rudi and Natasha walk out and refuse to work. The studio boss in turn refuses to release Rudi from his contract and takes out an injunction to prevent him acting for anyone but him. So Rudi and Natasha take an enforced break from the business intending to wait until the contract has expired.\n\nBut after a year living a carefree lifestyle out of the limelight, their money is running low. Rudi is also concerned that perhaps the public will have forgotten him. So he and Natasha start making personal appearances in music halls where they perform a dance act which does not break the injunction because he is not acting. The tour is a massive success because everyone wants to see the great Valentino in the flesh. The publicity convinces the studio head to ask Valentino to return to work giving him and Natasha the pay rise and script approval they demanded.\n\nWhen the contract ends Rudi and Natasha decide not to renew but instead enter into negotiations with United Artists. The famous studio wants to sign up Rudi but make it absolutely clear they do not want Natasha in any capacity because it is perceived she is a disrupting influence. For the sake of his career Rudi and Natasha agree to split up and go their separate ways.\n\nIt is now 1926 and Valentino's movie career continues to be successful. But now in his early 30s he has started to have some health problems with a stomach pain. Also he has been getting some bad press with one reporter mocking his aloof air and questioning his masculinity. Rudi takes great exception to this and publicly demands to fight the journalist in a boxing ring and prove he is a real man. The said journalist is not fit enough but another called Rory O'Neil takes up the challenge. Unfortunately O'Neil is an ex-navy heavyweight champion who takes great relish in the prospect of humbling such a pretentious upstart.\n\nValentino is not a fighter and cannot throw a proper punch and in the first two rounds he is roundly thrashed as O'Neil treats him like a punching bag. The bout only lasts that long because O'Neil is holding back to make it last by playing up to the baying crowd who are thoroughly enjoying the humiliating rout. But then in the third round Rudi lets rip with a last gasp effort and catches O'Neil with a lucky pile driver. O'Neil is stunned and goes down for the count and unexpectedly Valentino is the winner. The crowd cheer him, as if they had known all along that he would win in the end, and he is their hero again.\n\nO'Neil expresses no hard feelings and instead challenges Rudi to a rematch in the pub to see who can down the most shots of liquor. And again Rudi wins but only after imbibing an excessive amount of alcohol. He staggers home with his body suffering from the punishing beating and the alcohol abuse. His stomach complaint flares up and he collapses and dies. He was only 31 years old. In Mexico in the early 1900s TJ Breckenridge is the female star and owner of a touring Wild West show which combines rodeo with circus acts. But the popularity of the galas is waning and TJ knows she needs something new to pull in the crowds and fortuitously she has been gifted a miniature wonder that might just achieve that ...\n\nElsewhere Tuck Kirby, TJ's former partner and lover who walked out on her some years ago to pursue other opportunities, is heading back her way. He is returning to try and persuade TJ to sell out and settle down with him. On the way Tuck meets an English palaeontologist called Professor Horace Bromley who is conducting research in the desert area. He shows Tuck a fossilised footprint he has found that was made by an extinct Eohippus. The Eohippus, or Dawn Horse, was a miniature one-foot high horse, the ancestor of the modern horse which died out 50 million years ago.\n\nTJ is angry with Tuck at first for deserting her but his charm soon works its magic on her and she welcomes him back. She shows him her new acquisition which one of her employees found at the mouth of the Forbidden Valley in the desert a few miles away, although the exact location is unknown. It is a miniature horse and Tuck realises straight away that it must be an Eohippus which the English professor was recently telling him about - but this one is very much alive! Tuck brings the professor in to examine it and the Englishman shows great excitement at the kudos he will gain for this amazing scientific discovery. The professor wants to take it away and study it, but to his chagrin TJ refuses because she plans to use it in her show as a crowd-pleasing wonder.\n\nMeanwhile a superstitious old gypsy woman warns of terrible calamity if the creature is not returned to where it belongs. The professor reasons to himself that where there is one Eohippus there must be others so in an act of cunning he tells the gypsy woman where the Eohippus is kept knowing that she will steal it to return it home. He then plans to follow her and find the location of the Forbidden Valley and capture others of its kind. That way, he rationalises, TJ can have her attraction and he can have his specimen and everyone will be happy.\n\nThe old woman and her kin steal the Eohippus and ride out into the desert. The professor follows pleased that his ruse seems to be working. Tuck realises what is going on and gives chases followed shortly afterwards by TJ and her men who believe Tuck has betrayed them and helped the professor steal their attraction.\n\nAt the mouth of a valley the gypsies release the Eohippus back into the wild and it scampers off. The other parties arrive and begin efforts to recapture it. They find their way to a narrow crevice through a rock wall and on the other side find an undiscovered valley where all manner of strange and thought-to-be extinct prehistoric creatures roam.\n\nOne particularly fearsome creature is the gigantic carnivorous Allosaur whom the gypsies call Gwangi. The cowboys realise that if they could capture it the creature would eclipse the appeal of the tiny horse and be the greatest attraction ever exhibited. They use all their corralling skills to try and bring the beast under their control. But its belligerence and strength prove too much and they have to flee for their lives. However the Gwangi chases them as they exit through the narrow fissure and using brute strength forces its way through. But this activity dislodges some large boulders which fall onto the beast and render it unconscious. The cowboys seize their chance and transport the Gwangi back to their rodeo arena. They lock the creature in a large metal cage and begin making preparations for the public unveiling of their astounding new attraction. They ignore the gypsy woman's warnings that the Gwangi is an evil creature.\n\nThe public's interest in seeing the Gwangi is huge and TJ knows she is onto a money-spinner. Tuck is disappointed that TJ has rejected his appeal to sell out while she's doing well. As the big moment of the unveiling approaches one of the Gypsy woman's men sneaks into the cage and releases the restraining bolts. As the veil around the cage is removed to the audience's awed gasps, Gwangi becomes enraged and breaks out of the cage - the professor is crushed to death by the falling bars. Gwangi rampages around the arena as the crowd flee in utter panic. Gwangi chases the people out into the town square and into the cathedral where they thought they would be safe. Tuck manages to trap it in the cathedral as the people rush out of the rear exit. A fire is started and takes hold and Gwangi is caught in it, roaring its fury at the painful flames it cannot defeat. The crowds gather outside as they watch their cathedral burn down and hear the agonised death roars of the Gwangi as it eventually succumbs to the inferno. In the present day Castle Dracula in Transylvania is run as a tourist attraction hotel with the guests being offered themed dinners with a tour guide Dracula as their host. To the public at large Dracula is a legend and no one knows if he ever really existed - but he does exist and the real Count Dracula is the one behind the scenes running the whole enterprise and cashing in on his own name. His faithful human butler Maltravers acts as the tour-Dracula and they employ actresses to be the vampire waitresses. However Dracula has set up this tourist \"trap\" with one specific purpose in mind - he is desperately searching for someone with the rarest blood group in the world which can be used to provide the catalyst that will re-energise his beloved wife Vampira who has been in an undead coma for the past fifty years after drinking some poisoned peasant blood. Guests are routinely drugged and during their sleep have some blood extracted and analysed for that elusive group before they leave - remaining completely unaware of what happened to them.\n\nThe next guests expected at the castle are a party from Playboy magazine UK whose award winning article writer, Marc Williams, is doing a feature on the Dracula legend. He has brought along four models to photograph - there are three white models and one who is black. After dinner the models retire to bed and fall into a drugged sleep. Dracula and his servant take blood samples and when they analyse them they find they have at last found that elusive match! As long as the special blood catalyst is present then any other blood type will do to bulk-out the quantity and so all the samples taken are combined and used to give Vampira a transfusion. The process seems to be working and Dracula's wife awakens from her long slumber - but then a strange thing happens and her white skin turns black. Dracula is appalled at this development and can't imagine what people would think - although Vampira herself kind of likes it and thinks it suits her. Maltravers speculates it may be like mixing colours in the wash and the \"black\" blood contained in the batch has somehow affected her pigmentation.\n\nThey know the special blood did not come from the black model but due to a label mix-up Dracula and Maltravers aren't sure which of the three white girls the special blood came from - and now the models have returned to England. So Dracula, Vampira and Maltravers head off to London in pursuit to get more samples and discover which of them had the special blood. They are then anticipating that if they give Vampira another transfusion to clean out her system she will turn back to her normal colour.\n\nOnce in England Dracula rents a suitably gothic mansion and invites Marc Williams to visit knowing that he will have access to all the models. He hypnotises Marc into acting as his agent and commands him to take blood samples whenever he hears the codeword \"Vampira\". Marc then has dates with the models and in a trance is forced to extract blood from them for analysis. After a time Marc begins to become suspicious that he is under some from of control and tries to fight it but Dracula exerts his will forcing him to obey.\n\nThings culminate at a Playboy party where the final model to be tested is present and she is confirmed to be the match after the first two girls' results were negative. Dracula mixes the white-only blood up and gives Vampira another transfusion - but it doesn't work as expected - instead she stays black and feels such a surge of need that she bites into her husband's neck. This has an unforeseen effect on him as he too turns into a black person. Dracula is most embarrassed by this and decides to head back to Transylvania as quickly as possible before he is seen. In the village of Stetl in a European country during the nineteenth century the villagers live in fear of the mysterious Count Mitterhaus who resides in his fortified castle nearby. Several villagers' children have gone missing and although the Count is suspected they are unwilling to confront him afraid of the supernatural legends that surround him. But when a schoolteacher called Albert Mueller spots his own wife Anna leading a young innocent little girl into the castle he cannot understand what she is doing and assumes she must be under some unholy influence. He bands together the villagers and persuades them that they should at last take some action against the evil Count and save both his wife and the young girl Jenny. They enter the castle and soon discover Jenny dead from a vampire's bite - but Anna is in the Count's bedchamber as his willing lover. Count Mitterhaus is a vampire and Anna is his human concubine who has been luring innocent victims for him to feed upon. The villager's angrily attack the Count determined to rid themselves of his evil - they fight hard but the Count is supernaturally strong and cannot be harmed by conventional means - several villagers die but eventually the Count is subdued with a stake to his heart. As the Count lays dying he issues a curse on the assembled head villagers declaring that their children will suffer - that at some point in the future their offspring will die to restore his life. Anna is dragged from the castle and flogged for her treachery and the castle is set ablaze. Anna pulls free, and grieving for her lover she runs back into the burning castle and drags his body down into the cellar caves and into his coffin where in his dying moments he tells her to find his cousin Emil who will know what to do. She departs down an underground passageway and escapes to carry out his dying wishes...\n\nFifteen years later the same village is in the grip of an unknown plague that has caused the neighbouring villages to forcibly blockade access in or out to maintain it in quarantine. The head villagers are at a loss to know what to do and morale is very low. Then a circus troupe arrives in town mysteriously breaking the cordon without any difficulty. The circus is named \"The Circus of Nights\" and is run by an unnamed Gypsy Woman whose right hand man is Emil. He is secretly a vampire and has the ability to transmute into a black panther. Other circus performers are also vampires and they have arrived to put into motion the curse of Emil's cousin Mitterhaus from fifteen years previously.\n\nThe village folk are delighted at first with the distraction that the entertainment of the circus brings to their miserable situation. But when children of some of the elder villagers go missing and are found dead memories of the Count's curse come flooding back. The villagers band together once more to destroy the circus vampires and attempt to prevent the Count's resurrection from being fulfilled. But the situation is too far gone and the Count is reborn - but only temporarily as he is finally destroyed for good while still in a weakened state. Set in the early 1800s in a European country. General Von Spielsdorf is holding a grand celebratory ball for his young niece's birthday when some newcomers to the area arrive to introduce themselves. They are a Countess and her daughter Marcilla and are warmly welcomed. The Countess then receives an urgent message and is called away to visit a sick relative and she asks if she could impose upon the General to allow Marcilla to stay with him whilst she is away. The General agrees knowing that the young woman would be good company for his niece Laura. Over the days that follow the two young women make friends and become close - but then Laura begins to get ill, becoming tired and listless. The doctor can do nothing for her and after a couple of days she simply dies for no good reason, although the doctor discovers two odd puncture marks above her left breast. The General is grief stricken and goes away intent on finding some answers to his niece's sudden decline.\n\nNearby live the rich Morton family, they had been at the General's ball as well but had left the party early and so never met Marcilla - but they are all very sad at the death of Laura. Roger Morton lives with daughter Emma and the girl's governess Mademoiselle Perrodot. While out riding Roger Morton comes across a matronly damsel in distress whose stagecoach has had a mishap. The lady is travelling with her niece and because of the delay she asks if her charge could possibly stay with Morton whilst she continues on alone to visit a sick relative and Morton agrees thinking it would be excellent company for Emma. Her niece is called Carmilla (when we see her on screen we know she is Marcilla, although none of the Morton household know of her involvement in the nearby events at the General's house).\n\nMorton soon has to depart on business to Vienna and whilst he is away a similar pattern of events play out in this household as seen before and the mysteriously enigmatic Carmilla becomes good friends with Emma making overtures of something more than just friends when opportunity presents itself although Emma is too naïve to understand her close intimate contact is anything other than special friendship. Emma becomes listless during the day and her governess becomes increasingly concerned as to her well-being. Emma has strange puncture marks above her left breast which Carmilla explains away to the Governess as being made by a broach - but the Governess is only partly convinced and so Carmilla weaves her alluring spell on the woman who feels compelled to follow her to her room where a romantic liaison ensues.\n\nAfter this the Governess is a changed woman - she is no longer concerned about Emma's wellbeing and puts obstacles in the path of the worried butler Renton who thinks they should send for the Doctor. But Renton is anxious enough to go against the Governess' instructions and send for the doctor anyway. With suspicions of a vampiric predator around because of several mysterious deaths in the area, the doctor puts a crucifix around Emma's neck and has her room garnished with garlic flowers - Renton is given instructions by the doctor to make sure these safeguards are kept in place. Then on his way home the suspicious doctor is attacked by Carmilla and her vampiric nature is openly seen displayed (if there was any doubt) as she kills him with a bite to his neck before he can report anything of his findings in the village.\n\nBack at the house again Carmilla is thwarted from entering Emma's room by the defensive measures but she needs the girl to snack upon to satiate her cravings. Then Renton makes a fatal mistake when he confides in Carmilla that he thinks the Governess might be a vampire because of the way she has been trying to undermine the precautions made to keep Emma safe. Carmilla extorts her powers of mesmeric seduction over him and in her thrall he removes the charms for her and then she kills him.\n\nRoger Morton returns from his business trip and, terrified at his daughter's weak condition, he heads to the village to try and find the doctor (not knowing he is dead). On the way he meets the General who has just returned from his time away and has with him a man he found who knows all about the dangers of this area. His name is Baron Hartog and he has a story to tell ...\n\n(His story - some of which is seen in the film's prologue) Several years beforehand back in 1794 Baron Hartog's sister Isabella had been killed by a vampire of the Karnstein clan. The Karnsteins were a family who were evil both in life and in un-death and Hartog is determined to avenge his sister's death. He goes to the Karnstein castle where the vampires sleep buried in their coffins to occasionally rise when they need sustenance. He finds each coffin and stakes the occupants as they sleep. He only misses one whose tomb he could not locate and he was too overwrought by the horror of it all to continue searching any longer.\n\nSo now Morton, the General and the Baron return to the castle to complete the task. They search around and in an overgrown area find the missed tomb bearing the name of Mircalla Karnstein (1527 - 1545) and when they see her portrait both local men recognise her as the woman they recently allowed into their homes to befriend their young ones. However they discover that the tomb is empty of the actual coffin which has evidently been hidden elsewhere.\n\nBack at the Morton house Carmilla has become thwarted in her efforts to further feed from Emma by a local estate manager Carl Ebhardt (who was the beau of Laura) and she decides to give up and return to her coffin since she is reasonably sated as she has recently fed from the Governess whom she has just killed. Back at the castle the three men see her come back and discover the hidden location of her coffin and the General proceeds to stake her sleeping form and then beheads her to finally destroy her evil menace. Five men get into an elevator at separate floors on their way down to the ground floor of an office building - but the lift oddly bypasses the ground floor and goes to the basement where they get out and find food and refreshments laid out. The lift doors close and there is no recall button so they decide to wait it out and make the best of it until someone comes for them and soon get around to telling one another about some strange dreams they've each recently had. Their dreams are the stories we then see ...\n\nStory 1 - Midnight Mess\n\nHarold Rogers is searching for his sister Donna whom he has not seen for a long time. He hires a private detective whom he promptly strangles to death once he has discovered her address. He goes to her village and finds everyone is strangely afraid of the approaching dark. He knocks on his sister's door and she tells him that there are killers who roam at night. Then he tells her the reason for his visit - their father died four weeks beforehand and she is the sole-named heir - for as long as she lives! - and he proceeds to stab her to death. It is now dark outside and he goes to a nearby restaurant which seems to be doing a bustling trade despite the locals' supposed fear. But the menu is strange in that all the items are blood related and then in the mirror he sees that he is the only person in the packed dining room who has a reflection. His sister then walks in still alive and they all reveal themselves as vampires as they proceed to have him for dinner.\n\nStory 2 - The Neat Job\n\nAgeing Arthur Critchit has taken a new young wife called Eleanor to share in all the fortune and luxury he has accumulated in his life. Arthur is an obsessively neat and tidy person and needs everything to be in the right place and although she tries her best Eleanor finds it very hard to conform to the rigid system of order he has come to live by over the years and she keeps getting things wrong. When he comes home one day to find that her clumsiness has ruined the meticulous arrangements in his workroom she snaps and kills him with a hammer. But she preserves him as he would want to be by placing all his body parts in separate jars all neatly labelled and placed on a shelf.\n\nStory 3 - This Trick'll Kill You\n\nSebastian is a stage magician who is holidaying in India with his wife Inez who is also his stage assistant and together they are looking for new ideas for their act. They are watching a fakir and his daughter perform street magic and Sebastian takes great pleasure in exposing his \"magic\" as mere trickery in front of the assembled crowd. Sebastian prides himself in his ability to work out how any trick is done and so he is intrigued when later on he sees the daughter performing an Indian rope trick which even though she lets him examine it closely he cannot fathom the secret of. He offers to buy the secret of the trick from her but she refuses saying it a magic rope that has been handed down through the generations. So Sebastian tricks her into coming to his hotel room on the ruse of demonstrating the trick to Inez who he says is ill in bed - then he kills the young woman and tries the trick himself. He plays the music that she played and the rope rises and Inez practices climbing up it - but at the top she screams and vanishes and then the rope takes of a life of its own and attacks and kills Sebastian. And in the market place the Fakir and his still-alive daughter carry on their act having taken revenge on Sebastian for earlier humiliating them.\n\nStory 4 - Bargain In Death\n\nMaitland has devised an insurance scam with his friend Alex. Maitland takes a drug that will slow down his metabolism so much it will fool any doctor into believing him to be dead of a sudden heart attack. The plan is that soon after he is buried Alex will dig him up and together they will share the Life Assurance money. But Maitland plans to double cross Alex by killing him after the money has been collected - and Alex intends to double cross Maitland by not even digging him up. Meanwhile two medical students are bemoaning the fact that they have so little chance to practice on real dead bodies that they decide to get one themselves. Maitland is now underground buried in his coffin wondering what is taking Alex so long when at last he is dug up - it is not Alex though, but the two students, and they get a nasty shock when the \"corpse\" sits up gasping for air. But the gravedigger they have hired responds by slicing Maitland's head off with his shovel.\n\nStory 5 - Drawn and Quartered\n\nA painter called Moore has gone to live in seclusion on the island of Haiti after his artwork was strongly condemned by an art critic and considered worthless by a gallery owner. He is shocked therefore to discover that his art is now selling for record amounts back in London. He realises he has been conned by three people he trusted - the critic, art dealer and a friend called Lawrence Diltant who had bought up his work from him at rock bottom prices before he emigrated. Moore decides to have his revenge and visits a voodoo witch doctor and buys some magic to give his painting hand special powers and upon his return to London he paints portraits of the three men. He then defaces them and the men suffer similar injuries to those he has depicted for them. But Moore has also completed a self-portrait with his special painting hand and when that gets accidentally damaged a nasty death befalls him.\n\nBack to framing sequence - The lift doors open again onto a graveyard and the men file out and we learn that this storytelling is a regular occurrence that these dead men are compelled throughout all eternity to repeat - every night retelling the terrible things they did while they were alive. Set in the 1920s(?). In China, Fu Manchu and his daughter Lin Tang return to their ancestral homeland in the Northern Province of Kwang-su. Once ensconced in his palace Fu Manchu begins plotting his vengeance on the man who is forever thwarting his plans - Nayland Smith of Scotland Yard. To do this he sends his agents to kidnap a world-renowned plastic surgeon called Dr Lieberson and his daughter Maria. By means of the threat of harm to Maria, the doctor is forced to operate on a hypnotised prisoner and change his features into an exact double of Nayland Smith.\n\nMeanwhile Nayland Smith himself has just helped found an international organisation of police chiefs called INTERPOL with which to combat the growing threat of world-wide criminal networks. After this he goes on a well-earned holiday to Ireland with his good friend Dr Petrie. Whilst on holiday Fu Manchu's men make the switch - kidnapping the real Smith and leaving the double in his stead. The impostor is gaunt, silent and Petrie thinks his friend has been struck down by a sudden illness that has turned him into a virtual living zombie so he quickly takes him home. Once home in England the fake Smith murders the household maid and is arrested. Smith's great reputation is publicly ruined - he is put on trial for murder, found guilty, and condemned to death by hanging in four weeks time.\n\nThe real Smith has been crated up and shipped to China to be delivered to Fu Manchu's palace so that the criminal mastermind can revel in his vengeance by murdering his adversary, the real Smith, at the same time as the double is executed. Meanwhile Smith's loyal police chief friends (still unaware of the switch) plan a mission to Fu Manchu's palace believing that their colleague's massive fall from grace is the work of the evil Chinese criminal and hope to find evidence that will exonerate Smith and save him from the hangman's noose.\n\nJourney times to the remote Chinese province are long and by the time they arrive it is only a few hours until the execution. They infiltrate the palace and join up with the real Smith who has managed to free himself from a cell and begin to organise his own escape attempt. In London the fake Smith is executed and Fu Manchu calls for the real Smith to be brought before him. But unknown to Fu Manchu the guards accompanying Smith are now Smith's associates and they turn the tables on the criminal. A dynamite truck is set alight in the ensuing battle and the heroes flee leaving Fu Manchu and his daughter in stunned shock at the sudden downturn of events. The palace explodes and no one knows if Fu Manchu survived or not but Nayland Smith has the feeling that the world shall hear from him again. (We don't see Smith return to England and clear his name but must assume that once he explains what happened his reputation is quickly restored in time for the next film). {Comment] There is a secondary interwoven plot in which the major criminal organisations of the world decide to unite and ask Fu Manchu to be their leader if he can help them defeat the threat posed by the world's law enforcement agencies. This dovetails into the specific plot to discredit Nayland Smith but doesn't expand much beyond the basic premise. Fu Manchu's extended plan was to repeat the same replacement-double tactic with all of the world's major police chiefs until they were all discredited and confidence in law enforcement was eroded so much that the criminal gangs could operate more freely. A beautiful young girl called Carol swims out to a private yacht about to weigh anchor and stows-away. The vessel is owned by George Carter who is holidaying with his wife Sheila and their friend Philip. When they discover Carol they are well on their way to their next destination and too late to turn back so she is treated as a guest. Carol is unable or unwilling to explain why she is there and Philip in particular finds her intriguing. At night Carol has bad dreams and calls out a name \"Ayesha\". Philip hears her and she tells him that in her dreams people call her this but she doesn't know what it means.\n\nStill on route George receives a radio telegram with some disturbing news which causes him to change his destination. As the boat steers away Carol is racked with severe head pains and implores George to turn back to the original heading and when he refuses she jumps into the sea. George dives in to save her but his strenuous efforts give rise to a heart attack and he dies. With Carol safely back on board the boat heads to the nearest port at North Africa for an inquest.\n\nElsewhere in a secret society of ancient scholars called the Maji we see how the destiny of the woman called Carol is being manipulated from afar. They believe her to be the reincarnation of their once-queen Ayesha, and her former lover Killikrates wants her back. Killikrates is immortal - he was made undying by the eternal flame that burns only once in a lifetime - at the same time as the once-immortal Ayesha perished in the same flames. His adviser Men-Hari is adept at mind control powers and has been influencing Carol from afar - using pain to guide her direction so she will find her way to them when she follows the route that causes her least discomfort. Killikrates intends to make Ayesha immortal once again and has promised he will do the same for Men-Hari if he succeeds in bringing Ayesha to him - but the time of the flame approaches soon with the correct alignment of the stars and they anxiously await Ayesha's arrival. Another adviser named Za-Tor is suspicious of Men-Hari's true motives and believes he has a secret agenda of his own to take control once he gains immortality.\n\nAfter the shipmates have reached port Carol heads off on her own into the desert. When Philip finds her gone he follows fearing for her life or her sanity. Eventually, after some run-ins with Arab slave traders they are reunited and Carol's unwavering course leads them to a hidden pass within a mountain that comes out into a temple of the lost city of Kuma where time and tradition has stood still and the people dress like ancient Romans. Carol is welcomed as Ayesha and treated as royalty and taken to see Killikrates whilst Philip is shut away in imprisoned luxury. The mind powers of Men-Hari still influence Carol and she raises little objections to the assertions of her true identity.\n\nAs the moment of the flame's renewal draws close Za-Tor speaks with Philip about his concerns and Philip advises him to organise an uprising amongst his people who fear the return of Ayesha who is remembered as a ruthless ruler, and Za-Tor fears even more the immortality of Men-Hari whom he believes will try and take over the world. Philip is released by a female servant jealous of the returning Ayesha as she has her own secret love for Killikrates, and he goes looking for Carol.\n\nKillikrates takes Carol to a hidden chamber as the starlight hits the mystical crystal from which the eternal flame springs. They must wait for the flame to turn cold and then Carol can walk through it to become immortal. The flame's powers have some rules:- the person must enter of their own volition and with the consent of another immortal, and the only way an existing immortal can die is to enter the flame a second time. Philip finds them and tries to talk Carol out of it - he plants doubt in her mind that cause her to waver and Killikrates tells Men-Hari to walk her through the flame giving himself immortality too. This is what Men-Hari wanted all along and has been building to this point. Za-Tor tells Killikrates that Carol is not the true Ayesha and Men-Hari has found someone who resembles her using his mind powers to make it appear she was SHE so that he could gain immortality with Killikrates' consent. Devastated at this deception Killikrates rescinds his permission to Men-Hari and tells Carol and Philip they are free to leave. Then after a fight in which Men-Hari and Za-Tor are both mortally wounded, Killikrates feeling unfulfilled without his true Queen Ayesha walks the eternal flame once more to end his lonely existence. A dying Za-Tor then calls on the flame to destroy the accursed city whose people have taken the dark path and it obeys bringing the temple crumbling to the ground with Carol and Philip only just managing to escape in time. Philip Hopkins is a 10-year-old American boy living in a London townhouse with his mother Ruth and grandfather Howard who was an ex-big game hunter. They are well-off and have a live-in maid called Louise and a chauffeur called Dave. Philip is asthmatic and the house is centrally heated to keep the temperature at a constant 75°F which is also ideal for some of the exotic pets Philip keeps. Ruth is going away to Rome for a visit with her husband and is leaving Philip in the care of Howard and Louise.\n\nHowever Louise is not the innocent and trustworthy employee she seems and she is in league with her German boyfriend Jacques Müller waiting for the right opportunity to carry out a plan. She has recruited the gruff and brutish chauffeur Dave with sexual favours and the three of them are now ready to act. Their plan is to abduct Philip and receive a ransom for his safe return. With Ruth now away the ideal time to put their plan into operation has arrived.\n\nThe intention is that Jacques will pose as a taxi-driver to take Philip on a treat and instead take him to their pre-prepared safe house. But unexpectedly Philip leaves on an errand of his own to pick up an African house-snake from a nearby exotic pet importer. The shopkeeper's short-sighted wife is on duty and gives Philip his boxed-up order.\n\nMeanwhile at the London Institute of Toxicology Dr Marion Stowe is expecting a dangerous Black Mamba snake to study but instead her delivery turns out to be a harmless African house-snake. She contacts the importer and it is soon clear there has been a mix-up. Dr Stowe contacts the police to tell them that a young boy has taken delivery of the most deadly and ferocious snake in the world. Its venom can kill in minutes if no anti-toxin is on hand.\n\nPhilip returns home and an agitated Louise tries to persuade him to get into Jacques' taxi but the boy is insistent that he must unpack his new snake and put it in its warm serpentarium first. Louise reluctantly agrees and to hurry him up she helps him open the snake's travel box. The deadly Black Mamba leaps out and attacks her injecting her with its lethal venom and then scurries away. Louise quickly feels weak and goes into spasms and soon dies. Jacques and Dave have come into the house to see what is going on and Dave arms himself with a shotgun. Then there is a knock at the door which Dave answers. It is a policeman following up the report of the mixed up snakes but Dave panics thinking the police know about the kidnapping and shoots the policeman in the chest killing him.\n\nJacques is appalled that Dave's impetuous stupidity has placed them in a much more serious situation than they were planning - but he is prepared to use his hostages to negotiate their escape. The police soon arrive and cordon off the street and Commander William Bulloch takes charge. Jacques tells him they want a fast car and lots of money.\n\nDr Stowe arrives on the scene and briefs Bulloch on the situation with the mamba. Bulloch has no choice but to inform the kidnappers of the danger the snake poses to them and their hostages. The Black Mamba is an aggressively ferocious snake that attacks without reason and its venom is deadly. Dr Stowe has a quantity of anti-venom and Jacques tricks her into coming into the house to treat Louise not mentioning she is already dead. Once inside he takes Dr Stowe hostage as well.\n\nThe mamba has found a comfortable environment in the central heating ducts through which it can make its way to any room in the house. Jacques sends Howard to try to catch it with his safari skills but Howard fails to locate it. Dr Stowe mentions that if they were to turn off the sweltering central heating the snake might naturally go to sleep. Dave is sent to the basement to switch it off but the mamba is there and it attacks him and he dies.\n\nBulloch has stationed snipers on the opposite building to try to take the kidnappers out if the opportunity arises. Jacques ups the stakes by seemingly cutting off one of Dr Stowe's fingers and throwing it out to Bulloch telling him more will follow if their demands are not quickly met (in fact it is a finger from dead Louise although this isn't revealed to Bulloch or the viewer for some time).\n\nWhilst Jacques is speaking at the window the stalking mamba attacks him and Jacques is drawn into a battle for his life as he tries to kill the powerful serpent by whipping it around the room. Jacques eventually gets it into a position where he can shoot the mamba's head off with his handgun but in doing so he has become exposed to the police sniper's sights and he is shot dead in a hail of gunfire.\n\nAll the kidnappers and the snake are dead and the danger is seemingly over with Philip, Howard and Dr Stowe unharmed. Philip's mother Ruth returns and it looks as though life can return to normal. But unbeknown to anyone the black mamba had laid an egg in the warm ventilation ducts and now it has started to hatch ... This is a literary adaptation of the classic novel by Mary Shelley. It begins in the 1820s on an ice flow in the Artic where an ice-stranded schooner takes aboard a lone wanderer called Victor Frankenstein who is near to death from the exposure and tells the captain of the fantastic tale that led him here.\n\nIt began a few years before in Geneva when the academically bright Victor went off to university full of ambition to solve the mystery of life. He experimented on a recently deceased cadaver to try and revive it with the use of electrical power harnessed from a storm. His efforts are met with a resounding success and the corpse comes back to life. Faced with this reality Victor suddenly becomes appalled at his own handiwork and rejects the creature realising what an abomination against nature he has created. He leaves it to fend for itself as he is taken home to be with his family who are concerned about his state of mind.\n\nThe creature is a reasonably normal looking man with some facial scarring but possesses a full intelligence and ability to talk - but wherever he goes he is met by fear, rejection and hatred with no one willing to accept him into their community. He feels immense anger towards his creator Victor and heads off to his family home to seek his revenge. He kills Victor's young brother and tells Victor that he will do the same for the rest of his family if he does not create for him a female companion. Victor starts to comply but then reconsiders that he does not want to be responsible for spawning a new race of monsters of indeterminate ethics who might wish to destroy humanity. The creature therefore vows to carry out its threat.\n\nOn the night of Victor's wedding to his childhood sweetheart Elizabeth, despite Victor's precautions, the creature gets into the house and murders her. The creature tells Victor that he is now satisfied with his revenge and that he is now headed to the ends of the Earth to live alone. For Victor this is no longer good enough and he vows to track him down and kill him.\n\nThis quest eventually leads him to the Arctic where the story began and as he lays weak on the ship the creature comes to see him for one final time. Victor's heart gives out and he dies and the creature heads off into the desolate wilderness wishing to also die so that he will be a monster no more. Set in the early years of Anno Domini when Britain was under Roman occupation. The many small kingdoms of Britain were placed under the rule of a handful of Roman governor-generals each overseeing several kingdoms and in command of legions of battle-weary soldiers who despised the inclement climate. The Roman Emperor Nero issued instructions that his governors should be as accommodating as possible to the wishes of the local kings to avoid rebellion. One such kingdom was Iceni where the ageing and dying king had written a will that his land shall be jointly owned by Nero and the king's heir. Governor Justinian is temperate and agrees to honour the will to the letter imposing Roman rule in a tolerant and flexible manner. His headstrong first centurion Octavian is at odds with his commander's approach and feels that the might of the Roman sword should rule supreme and hold no quarter to these ignorant peasant people.\n\nThe old king passes the throne onto his daughter Salina whom he feels best able to take his place even though she is not the natural heir. The kingdom is still dominated by the druid religion despite all practice of this having been forbidden by the Romans. Salina has forsaken that old religion but others in her family still hold it devout. The chief druid Maelgan is particularly loathe to relinquish his power and influence and hopes to turn events so that the Romans can be driven out.\n\nOver the coming months Governor Justinian and Queen Salina fall in love and decide they wish to marry but there is little enthusiasm for this idea from their respective advisers. Also Justinian's fair-minded policy of taxing the rich more and the poor less angers the rich merchants and brings about a desire to have Justinian replaced. So Octavian and a merchant called Osiris plot together to turn events to their mutual advantage. Osiris has Maelgan organise a druid uprising in far off Anglesey forcing Justinian, who has jurisdiction, to leave Iceni to take command of the Roman response. Meanwhile Octavian, left in charge of Iceni, begins running the kingdom with the uncompromising iron fist he has always advocated. He restores the former tax policy rescinding all of Justinian's reforms. He also ceases to honour the terms of the old king's will and has Queen Salina publicly flogged when she tries to stand up to him. This action however has the effect of creating hatred towards the Romans where previously there had been grudging acceptance and thus fuels a mass rebellion. Queen Salina bears armour and sword and leads her people against Octavian and in an ambush of his convoy captures him and prepares him for execution on the next full moon according to the druid way.\n\nJustinian receives word of this and although he despairs of Octavian's ruthless hard-line attitudes which have precipitated these events he cannot ignore the flagrant insurrection of Roman law. He heads back to Iceni hoping to calm matters down but it has gone too far and a full-scale battle ensues. Although the Britons fight with fury and determination the superior Roman weaponry proves decisive and Justinian regrettably has to order that Queen Salina, whom he loves, is arrested to be taken to Rome for trial. But the Queen knows that this will mean she will end up as a slave and takes her own life rather than suffer that indignity. Army Major Alan Bernard is talking on the phone to his brother-in-law Professor Gordon Zellaby who lives in the village of Midwich. When things suddenly fall silent at Zellaby's end and Alan is unable to get any sort of reply from any Midwich numbers he becomes concerned and drives down to investigate. (As the camera looks around the village for us we see that everyone has mysteriously collapsed with no warning in the middle of whatever they were doing). When Major Bernard reaches the outskirts of the village he discovers that there is a kind of boundary point surrounding the village inside of which any living thing immediately passes out.\n\nThis situation lasts for several hours and then suddenly it is lifted as swiftly as it began and all the villagers come around with seemingly no adverse affects. But after a few months it becomes clear that all the village women of childbearing age have become pregnant, including Professor Zellaby's wife Anthea. The babies are all born within a short time of each other and as they grow up they mature much faster than normal children and show signs of high intelligence. They seem to share a group mind and once something is learned by one they all know it. They are able to read the thoughts and intentions of the \"normal\" humans and have the ability to control their actions and force them to commit suicide. The children behave politely towards their \"parents\" but show no signs of emotion or love. They are feared by the villagers who are wary of angering them and becoming victim to their eerie mind powers.\n\nThe military are aware of a similar group of children who were born in Russia on the same day and the authorities there eventually felt it was necessary to deal with them by blanket bombing their entire hometown in order to kill them. Professor Zellaby hopes that they will not have to act so drastically over here and can teach their children a set of moral values that will enable their huge intellects to be of use to all mankind - he persuades the government to allow him time to study the children more.\n\nThe boy born to the professor's wife is called David and is the leader of the children. Because of this they allow Professor Zellaby a special status as their teacher as they live together in the schoolhouse while they learn and grow until they are ready to disperse into the wider world. The children are aware of what happened to the Russian children and tell Zellaby they will not allow that to happen to them - they will survive no matter what the cost.\n\nThe professor realises he has misjudged the situation and there is no choice but to kill them - but now any military attempts to act against them will be detected and prevented by remote mind powers before it is started. So the professor decides he must act alone and he prepares a bomb which he puts in his briefcase on a short timer. He then blanks his mind and concentrates as hard as he can on a brick wall blocking out thoughts of anything else. When he enters the schoolroom the children realise he is deliberately keeping something important hidden and they surround his desk breaking away at his mind. The imagined brick wall slowly cracks and crumbles as it yields to their unrelenting power - but as the children at last reveal the image of the bomb behind the professor's mental wall it is too late and the briefcase explodes killing all the children and the professor.\n\nAs the schoolhouse burns there is a visual depiction of the children's disembodied glowing eyes seeming to fly away from the destroyed building as if to suggest that some part of their quintessence survives. Vic Dakin is a violent London gangster who runs a protection racket with the local night-clubs. He rewards loyalty but comes down hard on anyone who is suspected of talking to the police. He has a sadistic streak and enjoys personally dishing out beatings to anyone he suspects of disloyalty. He is also a homosexual and he likes to rough his partners up as a prelude to sex. His one tender spot is his elderly mother whom he dotes upon and couldn't be kinder or more considerate towards.\n\nA night-club owner hoping for a small reward gives Dakin some information he has heard about a disgruntled employee at a nearby factory who is willing to supply details of his company's wage delivery. Dakin and his gang (his \"firm\") check out the route and the prospects of a hold-up and things seem favourable. The factory is on the patch of another gangster called Frank Fletcher so Dakin brings him in on the job as well and Fletcher involves his brother-in-law Edgar Lowis who suffers from gastric ulcers.\n\nThe robbery of the wage couriers on route from bank to factory is successful although goes less smoothly than hoped and Fletcher is injured. But they get away with the money and once at a safer point decide they should split up to appear less conspicuous - Dakin and his henchman make off on foot and Fletcher and Lowis continue on with the haul with arrangements made to rendezvous and divide the cash later on.\n\nBut the police investigating the robbery find clues that lead them to Fletcher and he and Lowis are soon arrested. The money is not recovered as the pair of them had managed to hide it somewhere safe. Dakin realises he will be arrested soon so he sends for a former-partner of his called Wolfe Lissner. Wolfe has distanced himself from Dakin to go it alone as a small-time con man but Dakin still wields a strong intimidating influence over him and he has little choice but to agree to manufacture a strong alibi for Dakin for the time of the robbery. Wolfe has previously provided girls for an MP he knows called Gerald Draycott who frequents a certain type of party at a mutual friend's home in the country for which Draycott is always very grateful. Wolfe supplies him with a new girl but this time secretly photographs their bedroom activities. He then confronts Draycott with the evidence and threatens to expose his shameful proclivities unless he provides Vic Dakin with an alibi.\n\nDakin is arrested on suspicion of involvement in the wage robbery but has to be released when no less than Gerald Draycott MP tells the police that the man was with him at the time. Once released Dakin is determined to get to Fletcher or Lowis to divulge the location of the unrecovered money. The night-club owner from earlier gives Dakin a new snippet he has overheard from a punter that Edgar Lowis is to be transferred to a hospital for an operation. What Dakin doesn't know is that the night-club owner is now working as a police informant and has been told to pass on this information. Posing as doctors Dakin's men enter the hospital and abduct Lowis from under the police's very noses not realising that security had intentionally been kept minimal. When Dakin has been informed of the successful capture he and Wolfe drive to an abandoned factory where his men have taken Lowis and Dakin beats the location of the money out of the man. They go to that location but the police have been tailing them and they are all arrested although Dakin in his utter contempt for the police and the judiciary has delusions that no jury will ever convict him for fear of his reputation for reprisal violence. Irishman Sean Rogan is an IRA member serving a term in an English prison for crimes committed while acting in pursuit of his political beliefs. He is an explosives expert and by day he is put to work mining rocks from a quarry. Sean has done eight years of a fifteen-year sentence but is expectant of an imminent early remission for good behaviour. But then a message is conveyed to him via unofficial channels from his good friend and mentor Colum O'More that his remission is going to be declined. Sean is appalled at the prospect of another seven years of incarceration. Colum's message also indicated that if Sean can make it out of the prison then a fast car will be waiting for him every night at 7:30pm at a set rendezvous point.\n\nSean's specialist skill as an IRA operative was his ability to successfully infiltrate secure facilities to make political statements with explosives. He puts that expertise to use in reverse by working out a way of escaping using some explosives he managed to purloin from the quarry site. He makes it out and finds the car waiting for him as promised. It is driven by Hannah Costello who is Colum's secretary and sympathetic to the cause.\n\nShe hands him over to two English mercenaries called Austin and Fletcher whom Colum has hired to get Sean out of England and back to Ireland. Undercover of being Austin's chauffeur Sean makes it onto the ferry and returns to Ireland. He is delighted to be reunited with Colum and pleased to be free at last. In Ireland he cannot be extradited back to England for political crimes and he has decided to give up the struggle and settle down.\n\nHowever the fiercely patriotic Colum has other ideas and tells Sean that he needs him to do one last job for him in return for organising his escape route. Colum warns that it would be easy to have Sean delivered to the police in Northern Ireland from where he can be extradited to complete his sentence. Sean feels he therefore has little choice but to cooperate. Colum wants to reignite the struggle for Irish independence by making a big political statement. Nearby is an important electronics factory that Colum feels is betraying the nation by working on contracts for the British army. He wants Sean to infiltrate the security there and plant a bomb that will destroy their control mechanisms and put the plant out of commission for a long time. He has hired Austin and Fletcher who have expressed willingness to help even though they are not IRA members.\n\nSean goes to the site to check out the locale and notices a weakness in the way the plant receives its electricity from a sub-station on the lip of an escarpment. A carefully placed explosive charge on the escarpment face will cause the sub-station to slip and cut power enabling the infiltrators to get in and plant some timed explosives in the control area.\n\nMeanwhile Inspector Sullivan of the Irish police is suspicious of why Rogan is here. He speaks to Colum wondering what was so urgent that Rogan needed to escape only a few months away from his remission which would have been forthcoming because Sullivan saw the release papers. Colum gives nothing away but is privately devastated because he was told the news of the refused remission by Austin and Fletcher and was passing on what he thought was correct information. Colum wonders why the two Englishmen lied to him.\n\nThe operation begins and the escarpment explosive successfully outages the power. Rogan and the two English mercenaries cut their way in to the factory whilst the guards are all off investigating the sub-station explosion. The trio enter the unmanned control area and Rogan tells them where to plant the explosives for the maximum effect. But when the English pair start placing the explosives against the wrong wall Rogan realises they have another agenda entirely. The plant also has a vault that holds vast quantities of cash and Austin and Fletcher have planned all along to steal that and have no interest in political struggles. But they had needed Rogan's unique expertise to gain entry and that is why they lied about the remission so that he would be provoked to escape. They knock Rogan out so that he will be found at the scene and the IRA will be blamed for the robbery - then they make their escape. They head for the coast where they plan to hire a boat and travel back to England with the stolen money.\n\nFortunately Rogan quickly comes around and makes his exit before the guards return. Rogan does not think of himself as a criminal and wants no part in common larceny and also knows he could be arrested and extradited for non-political crimes. He sends Hannah to fetch Inspector Sullivan while he follows after the pair of criminals to try and catch them before they leave the country.\n\nFletcher and Austin hire a trawlerman's boat although they have to wait a few hours for the tide to turn. This gives Rogan time to find them and as the trawler is making its way out of the harbour he intercepts it with a small bomb-laden rowing boat timed to explode. The trawler is sunk and the villains have to swim for it and are arrested when Inspector Sullivan arrives. Rogan is also arrested but Sullivan believes he will only get a suspended sentence for catching the crooks and helping to recover the money. In the 1920s sisters Yvette and Lucille return home from a French finishing school as young ladies ready to start adult life. Home is in the North of England in a small rural community where they are the daughters of the local Rector. They live in the rectory with their brother's sister Cissie and her husband Fred, and their grandmother.\n\nLucille is content to fit in with the rural way of life and soon finds a job. But Yvette is discontented, she finds living here in sleepy Colgrave a dreary prospect with no likelihood of excitement or joy. Things that the family enjoy contentment with, like sitting around the hearth of an evening, she finds unbearable and the family have no understanding of why she is always being so contrary. Her mother abandoned her father, and therefore the entire family, many years before by divorcing him and is held in such disgrace that her name is forbidden to be mentioned. But Yvette begins to understand what she must have felt like and shares her mother's urge for excitement which she knows she will never find here where nothing ever happens. She feels she may need to fall in love but there is no one amongst the local lads that give her that special feeling.\n\nA group of friends take Yvette and Lucille on a day out. Leo Wetherell has a motor car and he takes them for a spin down the country roads. They stop to admire the magnificent dam which has been built to hold a water reservoir upstream from them where some workers are carrying out some routine maintenance. Next they come across a Gypsy encampment and stop so the girls can have their fortunes told by the Gypsy wife. While waiting her turn Yvette can't help but be intrigued by the ruggedly handsome Gypsy man whose piercingly penetrating eyes bore into her like she's the only woman he desires and she feels an immense sense of attraction towards him.\n\nNext day the Gypsy man comes round to the Rectory to sell some of his produce and he confirms their unspoken attraction by saying she should come back to his encampment alone soon. The next day she cycles over and while alone with him in his wagon as she washes her hands after a campfire side meal she feels an electrifying pull towards him and they almost kiss but are broken from it by the arrival of some new neighbours.\n\nThe newcomers are Mrs Fawcett and Major Eastwood who are a couple - although Mrs Fawcett is still married and awaiting a divorce from her rich husband. She is friendly and perennially cheerful and the couple are clearly very much in love. They take to Yvette who finds them a fascinating pair who have done what they want against the will of society. They have rented a nearby cottage to live together and Yvette takes to visiting them regularly - for to her they are the only \"normal\" people she knows whose company she really enjoys. But as far as her stodgy family are concerned they are monstrous inhuman pariahs who are living in sin and are therefore considered shameful outcasts from society. The rector finds her association with them disgraceful and tells her she's like a mad stray dog who has to sniff around indecent people because no decent folk will have her. She knows her father will never understand her because he finds her too like his own wife of whom he will never speak.\n\nThe film approaches its conclusion when one day Yvette is left alone in the house to mind grandmother while the rest of the family are out at work or socialising. She idly walks the grounds and looks down into the stream. She cannot understand why suddenly the current flow seems to increase and the level curiously and noticeably rises, but then she hears the Gypsy man galloping towards her on his horse shouting out an urgent call for her to run. The nearby dam has burst and a destructive tidal surge of water is fast approaching which she hadn't noticed. The Gypsy takes charge and gets her into the Rectory and upstairs to safety as the water surges through the downstairs rooms causing horrendous damage and destruction in its wake and demolishing the wooden staircase mere moments after they'd climbed it. They are unable to save the grandmother.\n\nThe house is sturdy and the water not powerful enough to flatten it but the flood waters take many hours to recede and Yvette and the Gypsy, who had been soaked through, undress and get into a bed to keep warm and they share a tender night of sexual passion.\n\nNext morning Yvette awakes and finds he has gone. The waters have receded and her cut-off family have come back desperately hoping she is safe and are immensely relieved when they find she is well. But as she climbs down a ladder they are astonished that she barely acknowledges them and instead walks past them and gets into a car with Mrs Fawcett and Major Eastwood and drives off with them on their way to pastures new. The End. Set in Singapore in 1951 in an army camp where a group of conscripted men are undertaking their two year period of national service. Amongst them is Private Brigg who in civilian life is a desk clerk in Kilburn and is not happy at being stuck out here without any girls and with the distinct possibility of being killed before he has a chance to really make his mark as a man. He and his buddies frequent the local town bar where oriental prostitutes are willing to oblige but Brigg hankers after a proper relationship with a homegrown girl.\n\nPhillipa Raskin is the daughter of the company sergeant major who lives in the fenced-off marriage quarters which is off-limits to the men. Phillipa hates the camp life which prevents her having a normal life for a girl of her age and despises her father's job that means she is forced to live here. She has a low opinion of young soldiers who are forever pestering her for dates and she refuses to participate in camp activities such as dances in which the men let their hair down and dance with the small number of servicewomen and officers wives in the area. Phillipa's father is frustrated by his daughter's attitude and wishes he could order her around as he can his men. When she once again refuses to attend the next dance evening he tries to imply there is a rumour going around that she is a lesbian and she reacts strongly to that and decides she'll show him. And after making a token appearance at the dance she leaves and impulsively sleeps with Sergeant Driscoll to whom she loses her virginity.\n\nMoving on:- when the locals begin to riot Brigg volunteers to protect the married quarters and takes Phillipa and her mother into the surrounding jungle to hide out from the bandits and overnight the two young people find comfort together while the mother sleeps off her exhaustion. After the immediate danger of civil disturbance has passed the conscripts are transferred by train to a safer place to continue their training and administrative duties. On route they are accompanied by Sgt Wellbeloved who boasts of his military jungle prowess and his bravery in the face of danger. When the train is ambushed and crashes on the track sabotaged by jungle bandits the men find themselves pinned down by enemy forces firing from the jungle. Sgt Driscoll takes command and organises a response as the inexperienced British soldiers fire back to hold their position against overwhelming odds. Sgt Wellbeloved turns out to be a coward and hides away in the train toilet. Private Brigg sees some of his squaddie friends around him die and becomes too paralysed with fright to fight back and wanders off into the jungle fortunately avoiding any enemy forces.\n\nDaylight comes and still wandering around in a state of shock Brigg finds himself further down the train line where he flags down another troop train and warns them of the ambush - the commander of those troops immediately heads for the attack area and with the arrival of these reinforcements the bandits flee and the soldiers in Brigg's company who are still stoically defending their position are saved. Sgt Driscoll realises that Brigg deserted in the face of danger but lets his cowardice pass since he ended up saving them by bring back reinforcements - but he is not so understanding with Wellbeloved whom he beats to a pulp for his cowardice.\n\nWhen the two year period of service is at last over the men pack their kit bags happy and ready to resume their normal lives back home while remembering those of their squad-mates who did not make it - and we see them leaving the compound in the troop lorry. Special Spoiler Alert for twist ending\n\n(prologue) Robert and Claire are a couple with a young 6-year-old son called David. Whilst on a boating holiday on a river they moor near a weir and while the couple have a bit of quality time together below decks they let David go off and play. Later on David is nowhere to be found and after a desperate and frantic search in the local surrounds and by the river patrol it is assumed he must have fallen in the water and drowned.\n\nSome unspecified amount of time later (possibly several years) Robert and Claire are travelling by car on a cold foggy evening to spend time together at an old isolated house in the country that she inherited. Claire floundered in her grief following David's death - wracked with guilt she was driven to attempt suicide and was eventually committed to a hospital for psychiatric help. She is now better and has just been discharged from hospital and this trip is an attempt at a renewal of their strained relationship. The car journey is difficult because of the dense fog and hazardous with the oncoming traffic hard to see resulting in several close calls.\n\nEventually they have decided it would be safer to walk and they arrive at the house on foot with most of their luggage left behind in the car. The house is large, cold, and empty with no power and no running water and Robert lights the fireplace to help keep them warm. After a short time there Claire begins to hear strange chuckles and eventually clear voices coming from nowhere. Robert can hear nothing and begins to fear she is losing her mind again. He becomes angry with her and their relationship becomes ever more strained but since they cannot leave due to the fog and onset of darkness they have to make the most of it and spend the night. Claire has a problem being intimate with Robert because she is forever reminded of what they were doing on that boat when their son went missing.\n\nAs the night progresses the voices continue and then Claire begins to see people too - a family group of a mother and her two children - dressed in period clothing, ghosts of a bygone era - although they are oblivious to her as they continue their play and merriment. As morning approaches Robert starts to see and hear the family as well and realises Claire has been telling the truth all along. They decide to leave the haunted house as quickly as possible and Robert goes to fetch the car now that it is daylight and the fog has lifted. Left alone with the ghosts Claire shouts at them infuriated and suddenly they hear her - but think she is a ghost haunting them. Claire then runs out of the house and through the woods after Robert and finds him standing at the roadside looking at the wreck of a car. Inside the car they see their own dead bodies. They come to the realisation that in the fog the previous night they did have an accident and died in the crash and have been ghosts ever since without even knowing. In May 1939 a few months prior to the eventual start of World War II a passenger liner full of 937 oppressed German Jews are allowed to leave Germany to start a new life in South America. Their exile is called a humanitarian gesture of goodwill by the Nazi authorities but secretly the German High Comma"
