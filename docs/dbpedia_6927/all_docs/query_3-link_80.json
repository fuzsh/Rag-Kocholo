These unique experiences have been occurring since MWTM was founded in 2010, and they have reportedly changed the careers of so many who greatly benefited from attending.\n\nMore information can be found here\n\nMasterclasses are held at various locations, typically at a large recording studio in a music industry capital city. Previous masterclasses have taken place in Los Angeles, New York, and London. Each masterclass includes lunch, however other meals, transport, and accommodation are to be arranged by the participants.\n\nMore information can be found here\n\nOur simple application process involves letting us know of your experience with audio and including some examples of projects you’ve worked on.\n\nFor week-long seminars in the South of France, please apply here.\n\nFor Masterclasses in various locations, please apply here.\n\nApplications are welcome from everybody!\n\nThe MWTM programme was launched in 2010 after the first ever week-long seminar was conducted at Studios La Fabrique. At the time, it was intended to be a one-off event and the company did not exist. After the astonishing success and positive feedback following the debut seminar, MWTM was formed and further seminars were hosted featuring different guest speakers. To date, over one hundred and twenty seminars have taken place!\n\nAside from hosting an average of twelve week-long seminars per year, MWTM has also run a number of Masterclasses and exclusive recording studio gatherings in the United States, typically coinciding with pro audio conventions by NAMM and AES. Our presence at these conventions has involved hundreds of live hour-long workshops given by A-list producers and engineers using a large-format console on stage!\n\nIn the United Kingdom, Mix with the Masters has conducted Masterclasses in London, exhibited at conferences, and curated a number of special guest appearances at Abbey Road Studios for its 90th anniversary festival in 2021."
