        "text": "The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes (Original Motion Picture Score) by award-winning composer James Newton Howard is out now. The album features original score music written by Howard for the new prequel to the massively popular dystopian film franchise. Howard makes his return to the world of Panem after scoring the franchise’s original four films, part of the composer’s longstanding creative relationship with director Francis Lawrence. Featured throughout the album’s 40 tracks is pianist Yuja Wang, infusing the score with her extraordinary musicality and lyricism. The soundtrack is also set to be released in vinyl format, arriving on colored discs enclosed in a 2-LP gatefold set alongside liner notes and stills from the film.\n\nListen to the album here."
