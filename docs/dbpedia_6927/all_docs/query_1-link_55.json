        "text": "Hearing his story with King Kong during the masterclass I attended, made me respect him so much. With that little time to write so much music, and still produce so amazing music, thats just unbelievable.\n\nI agree 100%.\n\nThe \"making of\" video about the score is fascinating. I think I may have it on the original DVD of the movie (which I bought partly for that alone). Not only did he have hardly any time, it appears that Peter Jackson, the director, reviewed every cue. Can't tell for sure but the video shows them going over the music together by some kind of video link.\n\nMaleficent. And all of them.\n\nI made a mockup from Maleficent some time ago, just because I like it so much. Gives me chills in a good way!\n\nTHE MOST underrated composer of our age. Just when you think you have him figured out - he up and surprises all of us. Unending reservoir of talent and dare I say genius.\n\nCouldn't have said it better. He's second only to Williams, IMO. A never-ending fountain of superb, sublime music.\n\nIt's a pity that he never won an academy award.\n\nYeah, He is so great and yet it seems like Hollywood now is kind of passing him by or maybe he just doesn't want to work as much any more.\n\nYeah, He is so great and yet it seems like Hollywood now is kind of passing him by or maybe he just doesn't want to work as much any more.\n\nThe later isn't impossible, but I'd say he's probably being careful with his calendar now that he's working on the Fantastic Beasts, with three more films to come at least.\n\nThe later isn't impossible, but I'd say he's probably being careful with his calendar now that he's working on the Fantastic Beasts, with three more films to come at least.\n\nSweet! Looking forward to hearing some real music in the movies next year.\n\nSo I went back today to listen to some new James Newton Howard Music. I heard this piece, it really resonated with me. So lovely and elegant. Hes really something else Whats your favorite score of his?\n\nMichael Clayton, especially the last cue at the end.\n\nI've been a fan ever since I listened to \"Amuseum\" (with Jeff Porcaro on drums!) on a Keyboard magazine soundpage - anyone else remember those?\n\nI couldn't be more pleased with his success as a soundtrack composer.\n\nI've been a fan ever since I listened to \"Amuseum\" (with Jeff Porcaro on drums!) on a Keyboard magazine soundpage - anyone else remember those?\n\nI couldn't be more pleased with his success as a soundtrack composer.\n\ni still have myplastic disc that used to come with Keyboard magazine. Lol. It Has some synth pieces on it from JNH&F era. That’s what hooked me. Damn, when the hell was that? ‘83? Favorite piece was e mi shuffle.\n\nYes, it has a similar vibe. Maybe JNH also used a Prophet 5 for the pads....\n\nMuch of the opening chords are actually wordless choir. I can see the similarity in mood but Howard’s chords move very differently. It was what attracted me to his music back in the 90s- atypical progressions."
