        "text": "Gustavo Dudamel\n\nHOLLYWOOD CHAMBER OF COMMERCE HONORS GUSTAVO DUDAMEL WITH\n\nSTAR ON THE HOLLYWOOD WALK OF FAME\n\nDudamel Celebrates His Tenth Anniversary with the Los Angeles Philharmonic\n\nThe Hollywood Chamber of Commerce proudly honored distinguished conductor Gustavo Dudamel with the 2,654th star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on Tuesday, January 22, 2019, at 11:30 a.m. PST in a year when Gustavo Dudamel celebrates his tenth anniversary as Music & Artistic Director of the Los Angeles Philharmonic during the orchestra’s centennial season. The star was dedicated in the category of Live Performance at 6752 Hollywood Boulevard in front the Musicians Institute. Celebrity guests attending the ceremony included Cold Play’s Chris Martin and actor Christoph Waltz.\n\n“Gustavo Dudamel is one of world’s premiere conductors of today’s world of classical music. He evokes the sounds of the great classical musicians and seamlessly serves it to new and renewed fans around the world,” said Ana Martinez, Producer of the Hollywood Walk of Fame. “We celebrate Gustavo Dudamel’s accomplishments and welcome his classic shine to our Walk of Fame.”\n\nJoining Emcee Rana Ghadban, the new President & CEO of the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce to unveil the star will be Helen Hunt and John Williams.\n\nThe Hollywood Chamber of Commerce which administers the popular star ceremonies encourages people who are unable to attend and fans around the world to watch the event exclusively on www.walkoffame.com.\n\nDriven by an unwavering belief in the power of music to heal, unite, and inspire, Gustavo Dudamel is one of the most distinguished conductors of our day. From the great concert halls to classrooms, video screens and movie theaters, Dudamel’s remarkable career of musical achievements and championing of access to the arts for young people around the world demonstrates music’s extraordinary capacity to transform lives.\n\nDudamel’s 2018/19 season will center around the centennial celebration of the Los Angeles Philharmonic and his tenth year as their Music & Artistic Director. Other highlights of the season include his debut at the Metropolitan Opera conducting Verdi’s Otello; tours with the Berlin Philharmonic, Munich Philharmonic, and Mahler Chamber Orchestra; and his first extended academic residency at Princeton University. The Los Angeles Philharmonic, led by Dudamel, will also be featured on 2019’s live Oscar® broadcast.\n\nA lifelong advocate for music education and social development through art, Dudamel himself was shaped by his childhood experience with El Sistema, the immersive musical training program initiated in 1975 by José Antonio Abreu. Entering his 19th year as Music Director of the Simón Bolívar Symphony Orchestra, Dudamel also carries on the work of his late mentor with his ongoing commitment to El Sistema in Venezuela, and by supporting numerous Sistema-inspired projects around the world. With the LA Phil he also continues to expand the reach of his signature Youth Orchestra Los Angeles (YOLA) initiative, including the 2019 opening of a new Frank Gehry-designed facility in Inglewood, California.\n\nOne of the few classical musicians to truly reach mainstream audiences, Gustavo Dudamel has been featured three times on CBS’ 60 Minutes and was the subject of a PBS special, Dudamel: Conducting a Life. He has been interviewed on CNN, Conan, The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, and Sesame Street. Gustavo was the inspiration For Amazon Studio’s Award-Winning Series “Mozart In The Jungle” in which he also appears and, together with members of YOLA, became the first classical musician to participate in the Super Bowl Halftime Show. At John Williams’ personal request, Dudamel guest-conducted on the soundtrack for Star Wars: The Force Awakens; he also recorded James Newton Howard’s soundtrack to Disney’s holiday blockbuster The Nutcracker, in which he makes an on-screen cameo.\n\nGustavo Dudamel was born in 1981 in Barquisimeto, Venezuela. The Gustavo Dudamel Foundation, a registered charity, was created in 2012 with the goal of promoting access to music as a human right and a catalyst for learning, integration, and social change.\n\nFor more information about Gustavo Dudamel, visit: gustavodudamel.com.
