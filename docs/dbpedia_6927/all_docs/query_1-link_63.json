        "text": "I've been mostly listening to modern orchestral works for the last few months but lately I've gone back to some older soundtracks from James Newton Howard like UNBREAKABLE. First, I loved the film. Second, the thought process behind the music was terrific. The Arvo Part type string theme, the distant plaintive trumpet underscoring David Dunn's ultimate calling, the melancholic piano theme for Mr Glass. It's a terrific score.\n\nThen I went further back to Wyatt Earp. Man, what a ballsy score. I listened to that a million times in the '90s. What a great amalgam of themes. The track \"It All Ends Now\" with its driving 5/4 meter and bold brass statement still resonates today.\n\nFalling Down is another stellar score. A crazy mash up of modern orchestral, pop, rock, and music concrete in places. Hopefully some record label releases the soundtrack to it along with Flatliners.\n\nA big +1 for Wyeth Earp and Unbreakable. Wyatt Earp in particular is a consistently fantastic score... for a pretty long film I might add.\n\nSpeaking of Shyamalan, Signs is also a wonderful score, imo, and I'm not ashamed to say that I even really liked The Village. What I loved about The Village is Hilary Hahn's playing, which spoke wonderfully to the female lead, and I think JNH did a great job of creating something that sounded perfectly anachronistic, so that the music did exactly what the film called for (again, imo).\n\nAnastasia, Dinosaur, and Atlantis have many wonderful moments as well.\n\nYes, at the time it came out it seemed to be taboo on some of the forums and liking it was not at all the \"in\" thing.\n\n....and I'm not ashamed to say that I even really liked The Village.\n\nIs liking The Village score taboo or something?\n\nYesterday I watched \"Falling Down\" again. I thin most of the scores of James Newton Howard are very good examples how you can make a super fitting soundtrack for a movie with small setups.\n\nJust because it's not mentioned here: The Hunger Games was a great score too.\n\n+1\n\nAnother great score. So much so that I was seriously tempted to go see the film.\n\nThough I suppose I should still make an effort to watch it sometime. Just to hear the music in context.\n\nI implore you all to check out the \"Snow White and the Huntsman\" soundtrack. Disregarding the film, the music is incredible. Easily in my top 5.\n\nLex @ 31st December 2012 said:\n\nI love The Village, and you know what....I love The Happening score too...and I Am Legend....worship the King Kong score...so much to enjoy so much to learn from this man.\n\nalex\n\nAll true. The animated movies are overlooked all the time -- Atlantis, Dinosaur (one mention I see), and Treasure Planet are amazing.\n\nJNH is the category killer; whether it's \"Dave\" or \"Huntsman\" or \"Treasure Planet\" or Michael Clayton, whatever style / palette he uses, he creates the definitive writing in that area.\n\n@ Christian, I wasn't skilled enough to tell the difference when the two were up for comparison and now I really can't even remember where that originated. Was that from Keyboard magazine or something? Anyway, I'd love to hear the mock-up again myself.\n\nI didn't like the King Kong score too much because it lacked a theme I can remember.\n\nHowever, +1 for Wyatt Earp, great score and theme!\n\nBut Costner' didn't have the cojones to rock the handlebar mustache like Kurt Russell did in Tombstone!! You gotta be a real man to wear that stache! lol\n\nHey on another subject...\n\nHAPPY NEW YEARS EVERYONE!!! o-[][]-o\n\nWhat a great year for sample libraries\n\nTotally weird! I was walking around SF the other day and randomly saw JNH. I don't know him but it occurred to me right after that he's directly responsible for a lot of how I view music to picture, scoring, etc. (Signs was a revelation to me at the time; still love it). I wanted to tell him I was a fan but felt awkward about it. Then I see this thread.\n\nHere's to JNH!!!\n\nI didn't like the King Kong score too much because it lacked a theme I can remember.\n\nI think that JNH did quite well with King Kong even he had only 5 weeks to write and record the score to the movie"
