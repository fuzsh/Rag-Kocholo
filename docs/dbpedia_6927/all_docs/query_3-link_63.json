        "text": "Having new sounds at my fingertips is always an inspiration and these EastWest virtual instruments have plenty of great sounds to choose from.\n\nJames Newton Howard\n\nThe Hunger Games, Fantastic Beasts, The Bourne Legacy, A Series of Unfortunate Events\n\nIf you're lucky, the tools themselves will inspire you. It looks - and sounds - like EastWest does just that with every new virtual instrument they release.\n\nJ.J. Abrams\n\nDirector: Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, Star Trek, Lost\n\nEastWest virtual instruments have become an important part of my sonic template. I am using EastWest Pianos and Silk in my scores and I am using Stormdrum right now!\n\nDanny Elfman\n\nDumbo, The Grinch, Fifty Shades of Grey, Justice League, Alice Through the Looking Glass\n\nThe entire line of EastWest virtual instruments are an essential part of my composing rig. The sounds are impeccably captured while the ease of use of the software makes the instruments top of their field.\n\nBrian Tyler\n\nThor, Iron Man, The Fast and the Furious, Crazy Rich Asians\n\nEastWest virtual instruments have that rare ability to inspire creative thinking. Always something I want out of sounds to lead me somewhere, to let myself go.\n\nThomas Newman\n\nCastle Rock, Passengers, Spectre, Bridge of Spies, Finding Dory, Skyfall, The Help\n\nEastWest Pianos are the best virtual instruments available today. The recording quality and playability are fantastic, faithfully reproducing the resonances of a well tuned piano.\n\nDavid Newman\n\nGreen Eggs and Ham, West Side Story, Girls Trip, Night School, Tarzan, Ice Age\n\nEastWest's SPACES II is my new go to reverb, it's absolutely the best reverb plug-in on the market, and I use it in most of my mixes.\n\nMark \"Spike\" Stent\n\nMix Engineer of the Year: Ed Sheeran, Coldplay, Lady Gaga, Muse\n\nI am a big fan of EastWest virtual instruments. Their collections contain generous sound palettes with great attention to detail.\n\nJohn Powell\n\nHow to Train Your Dragon, Solo: A Star Wars Story, Jason Bourne, Rio 2, Shrek\n\nI depend on the quality of these instruments to finalize the ideas with directors and producers. Sometimes a client will ask, “when did you record this orchestra?” - after hearing a mockup using EastWest orchestral instruments.\n\nDavid Campbell\n\nJoy, World War Z, Adele's 21, Muse's 2nd Law, Pearl Harbor, Armageddon\n\nEastWest's wide range of instruments allow absolute control over the emotive elements of my music. Each instrument is cleverly made to complement another making it an essential arsenal in any composer's collection.\n\nMac Quayle\n\nMr. Robot, American Horror Story, Pose, Feud, The People v. OJ Simpson\n\nInspiration hits you the moment that you begin to look through the EastWest collection. Every instrument has a polish to its production that makes it evident how much care has gone into its creation. They set the bar high.\n\nAlex Lacamoire\n\nHamilton, The Greatest Showman, Dear Evan Hansen, In The Heights\n\nThe attention to detail in the scripting and recording of the sounds make all of their instruments extremely playable and accurate sounding. I’m using them on a \"Star Trek Discovery\" cue right now!\n\nJeff Russo\n\nStar Trek: Discovery, Fargo, Legion, The Night Of, Altered Carbon\n\nEastWest's ComposerCloud subscription has become the solution I've always dreamed of. The combination of its world-class virtual instruments and stunning software makes the platform an absolute dream to use.\n\nEthan Popp\n\nGrammy & Tony Award Nominated Producer: School of Rock on Broadway, Hedwig, Motown the Music, Rock of Ages\n\nThis is not just a virtual piano collection, it's a masterpiece. It's love at first touch. When I first heard it, I had to play it, and I fell in love - WOW!!\n\nTeddy Riley\n\nProducer: Michael Jackson \"Dangerous\" and \"Invincible\"\n\nAs musical director/keyboard player for Paul McCartney, I need the best sounds available, EastWest virtual instruments give me that and are an essential part of my set-up.\n\nPaul \"Wix\" Wickens\n\nMusical Director/Keyboards: Paul McCartney\n\nEastWest's The Dark Side is exactly what I've been looking for in a moody, expertly distorted virtual instrument. I'm using it everyday in my video games music scores.\n\nRod Abernethy\n\nRage, Dead Space, The Hobbit\n\nHollywood Orchestra is easily the most versatile orchestral collection out there, from sweeping melodies to aggressive passages. I use it on all my orchestral productions!\n\nWilbert Roget II\n\nCall of Duty: WWII, Mortal Kombat 11, Lara Croft and the Temple of Osiris"
