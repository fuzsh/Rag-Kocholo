        "text": "1. When M. Night Shyamalan's script began making the rounds, it came with a few stipulations: \"I have to be attached as director, and we're going to have [a] $1 million minimum bid,\" he told The Hollywood Reporter of his demands. \"If they want to read it, they have to know that this is going to start at $1 million.\"\n\nWhen then-president of production of The Walt Disney Studios David Vogel read the script, he bought the rights to for $2.25 million without corporate approval to avoid a bidding war. Disney did not respond so favorably to his rogue decision-making. They asked him to restructure his contract and give up some of his presidential power. He refused and was fired in July of 1999.\n\nDisney had so little faith in the film that they sold production rights to Spyglass Entertainment, while retaining distribution rights and only 12.5 percent of the movie's box office receipts.\n\n2. A few years prior to playing Malcolm Crowe, Bruce Willis was attached to both star in and produce another Disney film, Broadway Baller. Only 20 days into the ill-fated production, he fired the director and much of the crew, leaving the production to be shelved indefinitely.\n\nFacing a lawsuit and a bill for the $17.5 million already spent on the scrapped film, Willis signed a three-picture contract with the studio in which a portion of his salary would go back to cover the losses. The first was Armageddon, followed by The Sixth Sense and The Kid.\n\n3. Michael Cera revealed that he'd auditioned for the role of Cole, telling Esquire in 2009 that he didn't know the movie \"was about seeing dead people. They didn't mention that in the breakdown.\"\n\nAfter seeing the movie, he thought back to the scene he'd read for his audition. \"Bruce Willis is saying, 'I can't be your doctor anymore,' and Haley Joel Osment starts crying and slides the penny over to him. It's a very emotional scene. And I did not do it that way,\" the Arrested Development star recalled. \"I did it upbeat. I said 'Some magic's real' very optimistically.\"\n\n4. Though he's only in the film for about 10 minutes, Donnie Wahlberg underwent a massive transformation to play Malcolm's tortured former patient Vincent, losing 43 pounds in just five weeks.\n\n\"I remember Night saying, 'This scene really has to kickstart the movie,'\" the New Kids on the Block singer told THR. \"I tried not to think about that burden and that responsibility and just try to honor the script and stay in tune with what I needed to play this part. I thought if I was in that room standing across from Bruce Willis and Olivia Williams and haven't suffered and really gone through some really dramatic situations before I do this scene, how am I going to bare my clothes, never mind bare my soul? So that's just where I went.\"\n\nAs he explained, he went rather method to prepare for the production, moving to New York and staying in a friend's apartment, \"but with no money, no credit cards. I would fast for a couple of days at a time and then just eat vegetables, chew gum all day and then walk the streets. When I got to Philadelphia, I slept in the park one night and was going through this really crazy process.\"\n\nHe couldn't, however, go the full monty for his big moment, as he'd hoped, having to settle for appearing in his \"tighty-whities\" to ensure the film was rated PG-13.\n\n10. While great care went into protecting the major twist ending, less care was taken when it came to the soundtrack's track listing.\n\nThe final track of the James Newton Howard score was originally called \"Malcolm is Dead.\"\n\nWhile the soundtrack wasn't available until a few weeks after the film's release, it still would have spoiled the film for anyone who happened to check out the CD in a record store (remember those?) before getting to the theater to see it.\n\n11. While Willis may have been obligated to make The Sixth Sense, he was apparently determined to make sure production was a good time for all involved, going so far as to deejay parties for the adult members of the crew at night.\n\n\"Bruce definitely introduced me to the notion of partying and letting loose. Back in those days, he was a big DJ and the parties were super fun,\" Shyamalan told Variety. \"He definitely gave me my first hangover. He'd always keep giving me shots that he kept calling 'candy': 'Here's candy, here's candy.' And then the next morning I could not get off the sofa. And I didn't know what this throbbing pain in my head was. He was just laughing his butt off.\"\n\n12. While much of the terror of the film lies in what you don't see, Osment revealed in a Reddit AMA years later that there was one scene left on the cutting-room floor that might've pushed the movie over the line.\n\n\"There is a deleted scene from The Sixth Sense where I look out the window of the hospital and see an entire wing with horribly disfigured and mutilated people standing in each of the dozens of windows,\" he wrote. \"I think Night wisely cut that out because we end up having a movie that isn't too gory and your imagination (the most terrifying force at work) takes over.\"\n\n13. In the two decades since the film was released, much of the cast has admitted that it wasn't until they saw the thing that they realized how scary it was.\n\nFor Mischa Barton, seen in the pivotal role of a young girl who'd been poisoned by her mother, that moment came when she stepped into the ADR booth during post-production.\n\n\"I actually had my little sister in the room because we went into this studio in New York to do the ADR and she just, like, literally flipped,\" the future star of The O.C. told Variety. \"You know how you're not supposed to make any noise in ADR? She screamed at the top of her lungs. My mom was like, 'Oh, my God.' She had to take her outside. My sister's like, 'That's the scariest thing I've seen.'\"\n\n14. Cole's visible breath whenever a ghost was near? That was achieved the old-fashioned way: By making the actor as cold as possible.\n\n\"What they did was they would drape this huge plastic sheeting over the sets and then pump in freezing cold air so that it would be below freezing, and you could see our breath,\" Osment told Variety. \"There was a limited time that we could be in there because it was so cold and most of the scenes I'm in my underwear or something.\"\n\nShyamalan explained, \"CGI at that time was not perfected to the place where I felt comfortable that it could do breaths. [Osment] wasn't acting, it was cold, and you could see the physicality on his skin and the way he's shivering. And even now, with CGI, I might do it the same way because of what it makes the actors do.\"\n\n15. The production used the old convention center in Shyamalan's hometown of Philadelphia for many of the film's interior scenes.\n\n\"Big, empty marble hallways, kind of a [The] Shining feel around the set itself. I believe JFK did a speech there during a campaign in 1960,\" Osment recalled to Variety. \"It was very old and ornate and had these cavernous, marble stairways that went really deep down.\"\n\nAnd not everyone was convinced they were there alone. \"I don't know if it's just kids who make up that everything's haunted, but I'm pretty sure that place was haunted. Like, actually haunted,\" Barton remembered. \"I don't really want to speak for Night, but I really think he kind of enjoyed it because it had this creepy air to it that made it even more fun.\"\n\n16. When Toni Collette came in to read for the role of Cole's mom Lynn, she'd altered her appearance in such a way that Shyamalan was worried he'd never be able to convince Disney to cast her.\n\n\"I had seen Muriel's Wedding and Toni came in and her head was shaved, and I forget if it was for fun or if it was for a movie. She did such a beautiful job,\" the director recalled to Variety. \"I didn't want to show the video to the studio for fear that they would be concerned with her appearance, and I said 'I want to cast the woman from Muriel's Wedding' and then Bruce backed me and said 'Oh, I love Muriel's Wedding,' so we kind of got it without the studio seeing the audition, and I was so lucky.\"\n\nAs for the hairdo she has in the film?\n\n\"Toni is actually wearing a wig throughout all of The Sixth Sense, and I think it's a wig from Velvet Goldmine,\" Shyamalan added. \"We didn't even have the wig!\"\n\n18. To achieve the horrific moment when Barton's Kyra is vomiting in front of poor Cole, she was not only kept in the freezing cold—the better to see everyone's breath with, naturally—but given a very specific mixture to hold in her mouth until the time was right.\n\n\"We would make a mixture to put in my mouth. They gave me options between cereals and bananas,\" Barton told Variety, noting that the experience didn't really fazed her. \"Everybody just asks, 'Was it traumatizing?' It really wasn't. I was already 13 and I could handle it.\""
