        "text": "Today in History\n\nToday is Sunday, June 9, the 161st day of 2024. There are 205 days left in the year.\n\nToday’s Highlight in History:\n\nOn June 9, 2023, a felony indictment said Donald Trump improperly stored in his Florida estate sensitive documents on nuclear capabilities, repeatedly enlisted aides and lawyers to help him hide records demanded by investigators and cavalierly showed off a Pentagon “plan of attack” and classified map.\n\nOn this date:\n\nIn 1732, James Oglethorpe received a charter from Britain’s King George II to found the colony of Georgia.\n\nIn 1870, author Charles Dickens died in Gad’s Hill Place, England.\n\nIn 1915, guitarist, songwriter and inventor Les Paul was born in Waukesha, Wisconsin.\n\nIn 1940, during World War II, Norway decided to surrender to the Nazis, effective at midnight.\n\nIn 1954, during the Senate Army-McCarthy hearings, Army special counsel Joseph N. Welch berated Sen. Joseph R. McCarthy, R-Wis., asking: “Have you no sense of decency, sir? At long last, have you left no sense of decency?”\n\nIn 1969, the Senate confirmed Warren Burger to be the new chief justice of the United States, succeeding Earl Warren.\n\nIn 1972, heavy rains triggered record flooding in the Black Hills of South Dakota; the resulting disaster left at least 238 people dead and $164 million in damage.\n\nIn 1978, leaders of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints struck down a 148-year-old policy of excluding Black men from the Mormon priesthood.\n\nIn 1983, Britain’s Conservatives, led by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, won a decisive election victory.\n\nIn 1986, the Rogers Commission released its report on the Challenger disaster, criticizing NASA and rocket-builder Morton Thiokol for management problems leading to the explosion that claimed the lives of seven astronauts.\n\nIn 1993, the science-fiction film “Jurassic Park,” directed by Steven Spielberg, had its world premiere in Washington, D.C.\n\nIn 2004, the body of Ronald Reagan arrived in Washington to lie in state in the U.S. Capitol Rotunda before the 40th president’s funeral.\n\nIn 2013, Rafael Nadal became the first man to win eight titles at the same Grand Slam tournament after beating fellow Spaniard David Ferrer in the French Open final.\n\nIn 2017, actor Adam West, TV’s “Batman,” died in Los Angeles at age 88.\n\nIn 2018, Justify, ridden by Mike Smith and trained by Bob Baffert, won the Belmont Stakes to become horse racing’s 13th Triple Crown winner and the second in four years.\n\nIn 2020, hundreds of mourners packed a Houston church for the funeral of George Floyd, a Black man whose death during a Minneapolis arrest inspired a worldwide reckoning over racial injustice.\n\nIn 2022, at its first public hearing on the matter, the House panel investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol laid the blame firmly on Donald Trump, saying the assault was not spontaneous but an “attempted coup” and a direct result of the defeated president’s effort to overturn the 2020 election.\n\nToday’s Birthdays: Media analyst Marvin Kalb is 94. Sports commentator Dick Vitale is 85. Author Letty Cottin Pogrebin is 85. Rock musician Mick Box (Uriah Heep) is 77. Retired MLB All-Star Dave Parker is 73. Film composer James Newton Howard is 73.
