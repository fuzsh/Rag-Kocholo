        "text": "The Carbon Grey Tabletop Role Playing Game is live right now on KICKSTARTER. I’m the creative director of this new game by Magnetic Press Play. Carbon Grey utilizes the time honored D6 System in a licensing partnership with West End Games.\n\nWe are on day 23, and were funded within the first 24 hours. Lots of cool stuff here, and lots of epic stretch goals to announce as we progress.\n\nPlease check it out here! CARBON GREY KICKSTARTER PAGE\n\nYou can also download the FREE Quickstart for the game here: Carbon Grey Quickstart\n\nThe RPG team is headed up by ENnie and UKGE award-winner and creative director Andrew E Gaska (Alien RPG, Terminator RPG) (that’s me) and game designer Eric Thomas (Rolled and Told, Choose your Own Adventure).ENnie award-winner and editor Mike Olson (Fate Core RPG, Atomic Robo RPG), wrangles writers Kim Perrone (Based on a Dream), Jay Africa (Geek and Sundry), Emmett Furey (New Adventures of Peter and Wendy), and Jameson McDaniel (Quest of Yore).\n\nOn the visual side, the original Carbon Grey art and design is supplemented by the work of artists Chandra Free (God Machine) and Miguel Angel Abad (Iron Sky) plus graphic designer Jared Earle (SLA Industries) and digital sculptors David Arberas Recondo (Zombicide 2nd Edition), Keiran Russell (Ninja Dice), and the team at Draco Studios (Dragonbond, Eldrich Century).Magnetic Press Play is run by Mike Kennedy (Star Wars, Superman).\n\nCarbon Grey was created by Hoang Nguyen, Paul Gardner, Khari Evans, and Kinsun Loh for their creator-owned comic series of the same name originally published by Image Comics.\n\nTHE D6 SYSTEM: RETRO RPG ROOTS\n\nThe D6 System is a tabletop role-playing game system created by West End Games (WEG). Best known as the basis for movie-based tabletop games such as the original Star Wars and Ghostbusters RPGs, the D6 System has provided the tabletop foundation for many popular role-playing games since. Widely beloved for its ease of play, the D6 System is the perfect ruleset for introducing new players to tabletop gaming. The system is named after the many 6-sided dice rolls used to determine success and failure in the game.\n\nI’ve always loved the West End Games D6 System–their Star Wars and Ghostbusters games were a big part of my high school years. I was happy to secure a licensing partnership between Magnetic Press and West End Games to utilize this epic ruleset.\n\nThe game uses the new Magnetic Variant of the classic West End Games D6 System–the system we all know and love from the 1980s Ghostbusters and Star Wars RPGs. The Magnetic Variant rewinds the D6 system back to its classic roots and streamlines it for a forward-thinking modern audience.\n\n…and here’s a look at one of the period specific pre-generated character sheets!\n\nPODCASTS:\n\nThe Dark Orb\n\nVCG Chaotic Good Cast Episode 116\n\nNEWS:\n\nGeek Native Free to Download: Carbon Grey RPG and D6MV quickstart\n\nCarbon Grey Quickstart\n\nCarbon Grey RPG Kickstarter LIVE right now!\n\nSettings Primer on DriveThruRPG\n\nI’ll gather any news items and related info and add them here as the campaign progresses, so stay tuned–and please pledge!\n\n—Andrew E.C.
