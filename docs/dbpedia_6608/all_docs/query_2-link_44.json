Why? Well, that's because Alix has finally defined the relationship.\n\nDuring a live event with Alex Cooper for Call Her Daddy on Nov. 12, the podcast mogul brought up Alix and Braxton's recent trip to the Bahamas earlier this month and asked the 22-year-old, \"This trip feels like—we've gotta ask the question and get the tea right here in the building tonight. Alix, do you have a boyfriend?\"\n\nThe room filled with cheers and clapping as the social media star smiled and turned around in her chair for a moment, before revealing with a laugh, \"I mean... yes.\""
