        "text": "Demon Dog\n\nDemon Dog is an ode to the awesome MÖRK BORG by Free League Publishing: The multi-award winning MÖRK BORG is a rules-lite doom metal album of a game in the OSR genre. Demon Dog takes the same thesis and applies it to the Punk aesthetic, being both inspired by it and a standalone roleplaying game. You can smash together the ideas in both books or pull ideas from one into the other. What's it about? So glad you asked.\n\nYou died. It's very sad. Get over it.\n\nLuckily for you, you negotiated with one of the six Demon Barons and you get to finish your unfinished business. Go get revenge, seek redemption, and...um, oh yeah, you made a pact. You'd better do what the demon wants too. As a 'Demon Dog', you get to wander the world, dealing with all those people who deserve a bit of a shoeing. There's the Clergy and their Inquisitors that could do with tasting a head butt, and they've got churches to burn. There's the press that peddle lies to the gullible with an open ear and they might not like it if their scriveners get a wee bit stabbed. What about the toffee-nosed monarchy and their loud-mouthed guards, they might want to go home in an ambulance wagon. Give it some welly. But don't forget your Demon Baron needs stuff doing. Sometimes that's a bit less fun; other times, it's right up your street. Wayhey!\n\nSound fun? Great. Just one last thing to conclude our business...which version of the book would ya like? All the guts inside are the same, but the covers...oh...the covers are magnificent. Take a look:"
