        "text": "Nightfall Games has announced the release of their latest role-playing game, “Maggot Machine.” Set in an alternative version of 1994, the game features a world where time has stopped, and monstrous entities known as Maggot Machines dominate the landscape. Humanity has retreated underground to avoid these threats.\n\nIn “Maggot Machine,” players assume the roles of Guild Knights, tasked with venturing above ground to retrieve lost artifacts from before the Great Maggot era. Rewards for these dangerous missions include essential supplies and survival necessities.\n\nThe game was developed by Dave Allsop, known for “SLA Industries,” with additional contributions from Jared Earle and Benn Greybeaton. To accommodate the unique setting, Nightfall Games has introduced the V6 system, a simplified rule set designed to enhance gameplay without overwhelming players with complexity.\n\nThe Kickstarter campaign for “Maggot Machine” began on April 16, 2024, and will continue for 21 days. It offers backers the chance to receive the rule book and additional content as part of their support.\n\nAhead of the full game release, Nightfall Games has made a 32-page Quickstart guide available on DriveThruRPG, giving potential players a preview of the system and setting.\n\nMark Rapson, Managing Director of Nightfall Games, is overseeing the Kickstarter campaign. He emphasized the company’s focus on maintaining clear and consistent communication with backers throughout the campaign process.\n\n“Maggot Machine” features over fifty new artworks by Dave Allsop and a design layout by Allsop and Jared Earle. The final product is a 128-page A5 book, which continues Nightfall Games’ tradition of high-quality game production.\n\nFrom its beginnings as Scotland’s first RPG publisher, Nightfall Games has developed a variety of games, both licensed and original, known for their strong narratives and high production values."
