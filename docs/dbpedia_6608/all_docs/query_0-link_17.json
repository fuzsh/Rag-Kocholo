        "text": "The Terminator RPG\n\nMany of The Terminator RPG: Campaign Book's missions are based on the Terminator graphic novel series and can be played as standalone scenarios. Combined, they form the framework for a Terminator campaign that starts in the future and ends in the past.\n\nCampaign Book\n\nThe Campaign provides information on the overall arc of the campaign, as well as the links between scenarios.\n\nMissions come next, and there are 15 in total. Many are based on various Dark Horse graphic novels, and a few are original concepts for The Terminator RPG. The scenarios are listed below.\n\nTwo Short Stories are mixed in with the missions.\n\nAppendix 1: Player Characters contains seven characters designed for the mission Flatline, and they may be used as pre-generated characters or as NPCs.\n\nAppendix 2: Non-Player Characters includes six unique non-player characters (NPCs) and lists what mission they are featured in.\n\nThe Missions\n\nHot Potato\n\nA scenario inspired by the Graphic Novel: Suicide Run.\n\nThis post-Judgment Day mission, circa 2020s, is designed for 3-6 players.\n\nMission Briefing: A Terminator complex has suffered a fatal accident and the Player Characters (PCs) are sent on a recon/recovery mission to discover what caused the incident at the facility as well as to download any and all data they can.\n\nArms Race\n\nA scenario inspired by the Graphic Novel: Hunters and Killers.\n\nThis post-Judgment Day mission, circa 2020s-2030s, is designed for 4-6 players. It is set in Eastern Europe and is designed to give players a look at the other side of the post-Judgment Day world.\n\nMission Briefing: Skynet's Russian equivalent is abducting key Resistance members and replacing them with nearly undetectable Terminator duplicates. The PCs must work to expose this new threat and forge an alliance between former enemies in the name of all humankind.\n\nKill/Switch\n\nA scenario inspired by the Graphic Novel: Enemy of My Enemy.\n\nThis post-Judgment Day mission, circa 2020s-2030s, is designed for 3-6 players, including at least one with hacking skills.\n\nMission Briefing: The PCs are sent by Tech-Com to upstate New York, in search of a pre-war weapons research facility. Their mission: secure something from the old mainframes called the 'Fong Report,' which contains information on the Terminators' flesh farms.\n\nFuture Tense\n\nA scenario inspired by the Graphic Novel: Terminator 2029.\n\nThis post-Judgment Day mission, circa 2029, is designed for 3-6 players, including at least one with hacking skills.\n\nMission Briefing: Pasadena One, a Resistance stronghold and the PCs' home, has been breached.

The PCs will need to head back to the 1980s and stop E0656.T before it can cause irreparable harm to the timeline.\n\nBad Block\n\nA scenario inspired by the Graphic Novel: Sector War.\n\nThis post-Judgment Day mission, circa 1980s, is designed for 3-6 players.\n\nMission Briefing: For reasons unknown, one or more of the PCs have been targeted for termination—which one or how many is unclear. What is clear, is that a terminator has been sent back in time to eliminate them before they can affect the coming war.\n\nFlatline\n\nA scenario inspired by the Graphic Novel: The Dark Years.\n\nThis post-Judgment Day mission, circa 1980s, is designed for 3-6 players.\n\nMission Briefing: The Senate Armed Services Committee (SASC) is due to vote on the upcoming Bellerophon Bill after the holiday break. Bellerophon is the project that eventually culminates in the creation of Skynet, and a newly elected Senator from Washington, Daron Summers, is expected to vote in favor of the bill. The PCs are tasked with seeing that things go differently.\n\nSkynet Bytes Forward\n\nAn Original Concept Scenario.\n\nThis post-Judgment Day mission, circa 1980s, is designed for 3-6 players.\n\nMission Briefing: Skynet has a massive gap in its databases, lost during Judgment Day due to an over-reliance on centralized military systems. Skynet, with the aid of its time displacement technology, aims to correct this error by sending a pair of Terminators back on an intelligence-gathering mission. The PCs aim to stop them.\n\nThe Centurion\n\nAn Original Concept Scenario.\n\nThis post-Judgment Day mission, circa 1980s, is designed for 3-6 players. It is designed as a follow-up to any successful mission set in the past, and not as a stand-alone scenario.\n\nMission Briefing: The PCs have beaten Skynet's threat from their last mission and are now chilling at a bar, wearing colorful shirts and throwing back cold ones. And in walks a man dressed a bit too warmly for the weather....\n\nPast Tense\n\nA scenario inspired by the Graphic Novel: Terminator 1984.\n\nThis post-Judgment Day mission, circa 1980s, is designed for 3-6 players. The events of Future Tense should be played pior to running this adventure.\n\nMission Briefing: Kyle Reese has gone back in time to save Sarah Connor from the Terminator, however, he's been captured by and the Resistance doesn't know who has him or where.\n\nDeath in the Valley\n\nA scenario inspired by the Graphic Novel: Death Valley.\n\nThis post-Judgment Day mission, circa 1980s, is designed for 3-6 players.\n\nMission Briefing: The PCs learn of a biker gang operating out of Death Valley. The gang is said to be loaded with guns and led by a tough young woman who sounds a lot like Sarah Connor. Unfortunately, the gang has drawn the attention of the police (and possibly some Terminators) and the PCs may need to intervene to protect her in preparing for humankind's future.\n\nTertiary Objective\n\nA scenario inspired by the Graphic Novel: Secondary Objectives.\n\nThis post-Judgment Day mission, circa 1985, is designed for 3-6 players, including at least one with hacking skills.\n\nMission Briefing: While looking to join up with Sarah Connor in Mexico, the PCs cross paths with two of her allies who seem to have a Terminator problem. It's not the first Terminator who's come looking for them, and the PCs will need to figure out why.\n\nFool's Mate\n\nA scenario inspired by the Graphic Novel: Endgame.\n\nThis post-Judgment Day mission, circa 1980s, is designed for 3-6 players.\n\nMission Briefing: To save the future, the PCs have to impersonate the Connors during John's formative years, strike at assets believed to be essential to Skynet's development, and then lead the Terminators as far away from the real Connors as possible so that the Resistance leader has a chance to grow up.\n\nPast Planning\n\nAn Original Concept Scenario.\n\nThis post-Judgment Day mission, circa 1980s, is designed for 3-6 players.\n\nMission Briefing: Vital future information leads the PCs to one of Skynet's assets in the past—a seemingly innocent, small company in South America. But the key to disrupting Skynet's plan must be subtle sabotage, because if the PCs just blow it up, Skynet will simply start again somewhere else.\n\nEpilogue: Tense Past\n\nA scenario inspired by the Graphic Novel: Terminator 1984.\n\nThis post-Judgment Day mission, circa 1980s, is designed for 3-6 players.\n\nMission Briefing: The PCs have searched for Sarah Connor, stayed one step ahead of the law and Skynet, and reunited her with Kyle Reese. Maybe they've even faced down Terminators and crippled Skynet for months or even years, across a variety of time periods. And now...the PCs are safe. Kyle Reese is safe. Sarah Connor is safe, and, as a result of all their efforts, John Connor is safe, too. Or are they?"
