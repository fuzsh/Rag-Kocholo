        "text": "2017-18 Men's Ice Hockey Roster\n\nChoose a Player:\n\nNed Dykes/Cornell Athletics\n\n18 Jared Fiegl\n\nPosition Forward\n\nHeight 6-1\n\nWeight 215\n\nClass Senior\n\nHometown Parker, Colo.\n\nBio\n\nStats\n\nHistorical\n\nBiography\n\nSenior Season — 2017-18\n\nMaking the shift to the wing, Fiegl posted eight points on four goals and four assists with a plus-13 rating in 28 games while serving as an alternate captain. After scoring just four goals in the first 107 games of his career, Fiegl led the Big Red with four goals in the month of Feburary alone. That included the lone strike in a 1-0 victory Feb. 10 at St. Lawrence. Fiegl was the only member of the squad to earn three team postseason awards. He won the Ironman Award for a second straight year. Fiegl was presented the Cornell Hockey Association award, given annually to the player whose contributions to the team don't show up in the box score, but rather are in the form of energy, heart and hustle. He was also given the Wendall and Francelia Earle Award for Outstanding Academic Achievement. The annual award is presented to the member in each class who has achieved the highest cumulative grade point average. Fiegl was also nominated for the Hockey Commissioners' Association Derek Hines Unsung Hero Award.\n\nJunior Season — 2016-17\n\nFiegl was presented with the team's Iron Man Award after a season in which he fought through injuries to make his way into the lineup for all of the team's 35 games and provide valuable depth at center. He scored twice and added four assists for six points, including a helper on the team's first goal of the season Oct. 28 at Merrimack. His first goal was a big one, getting the Big Red on the board Nov. 18 against Princeton to set the stage for a 4-2 comeback victory. His second goal also came at home, opening the scoring Jan. 21 against St. Lawrence in what would eventually be a 3-2 victory.\n\nSophomore Season — 2015-16\n\nFiegl played in 30 games for the Big Red, spending significant time both on the wing and at center. His only assist of the season came on the team's biggest stage, when he helped set up Holden Anderson's goal on a redirection on Nov. 28 against Boston University at the biennial Red Hot Hockey event at Madison Square Garden. Fiegl then scored his lone goal of the campaign on Dec. 28, cashing in on a two-on-one rush against Providence in the Big Red's overtime victory against a Friars team which was the defending national champion, and both undefeated and ranked No. 1 in the country at the time.\n\nFreshman Season — 2014-15\n\nFiegl appeared in 26 games, which was the most among freshmen forwards. He established himself as one of the Big Red's four regular centers, where he often pivoted an energetic trio with Madison Dias on his left. Fiegl's first collegiate goal was particularly memorable in that it not only came at Harvard, but it also tied the game with less than four minutes remaining in the third period on Feb. 14. Fiegl drove the net to convert a rebound of a Teemu Tiitinen shot, and the Big Red went on to tie the game and win the season series against the eventual ECAC Hockey champions.\n\nPrior to Cornell\n\nFiegl’s arrival (along with that of Ryan Bliss) marks the fifth straight season the Big Red has added a player directly from the esteemed U.S. National Team Development Program, following in the footsteps of Andy Iles, Cole Bardreau, Gavin Stoick and Clint Lewis. Fiegl played in 45 games for the USNTDP, scoring two goals to go with four assists for six points and plus-1 rating. He helped the U.S. win the IIHF Under-18 world championship in 2014, and the Four Nations U-17 title in 2013. He also represented the U.S. squad at the 2012 Youth Olympic Winter Games in Innsbruck, Austria. Fiegl was ranked 142nd among North American skaters in the final rankings for the NHL Central Scouting Service’s 2014 draft watch list. He was then drafted by the Arizona Coyotes with the 191st overall pick in the seventh round of the 2014 NHL Entry Draft.\n\nPersonal\n\nJared Lane Fiegl is the son of Dan Fiegl and Tammy Hawley, and he has two brothers. He is enrolled in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences.\n\nStatistics\n\nSeason Statistics\n\nSeason Statistics\n\nNo statistics available for this season.\n\nCareer Statistics\n\nThere are no statistics available for this player.\n\nHistorical Player Information\n\n18\n\n2014-15Freshman\n\nForward\n\n6'1\" 213 lbs\n\n18\n\n18\n\n2015-16Sophomore\n\nForward\n\n6'1\" 221 lbs\n\n18\n\n18\n\n2016-17Junior\n\nForward\n\n6'1\" 217 lbs\n\n18\n\n18\n\n2017-18Senior\n\nForward\n\n6'1\" 215 lbs\n\n18"
