        "text": "Statement from Word Forge Games regarding Daruma stock.\n\nWord Forge Limited acquired the ‘SLA CS1 stock’, which we were informed was the entirety of the available ‘SLA CS1 Stock’, at the beginning of June 2018. This was made up of stock produced and sold by Word Forge to Daruma but recovered under a retention of title for non-payment along with stock which was purchased by Word Forge from Daruma in full agreement between the Daruma and Word Forge Limited representatives. WFG obtained both inventories with the intention of fulfilling this Kickstarter and further developing the SLA franchise with its creators.\n\nDue to more recent developments, these inventories are currently quarantined within Word Forge Limited’s warehouse until there is clarity on the legal ownership of this stock. Once this is clarified, Word Forge Limited will either continue with its plans or follow the directions of Daruma’s representatives.\n\nThis just gets funkier\n\nI was with Mark Rapson last week. He is fully aware that the KS must be fulfilled and he is trying to work out how to do that. He seems to have more integrity than the daruma directors, so we should wait and see.\n\nIt is good to hear that WFG want to see the KS delivered. From what we have seen so far I am unsure how or why this is the case.\n\nNFG licenced/created Daruma to do the KS project. This raised £45k funds which have all gone.\n\nWFG were not paid for work they did and have taken back stock in lieu of payment.\n\nSo where is the money coming from for WFG to fulfill the KS? They are going to do this on the basis that it will create good will and the SLA IP is worth enough that they will recover the initial loss?\n\nThis all seems odd to me.\n\nIt would be interesting to see the Daruma accounts which are overdue being filed according to the Companies House listing.\n\nDust seems to be settling on this one. Did anyone here on BoW lose money in this project?\n\nLooks like a very iffy project from the very start. Same folks involved with company A then license IP to company B and run a KS. Raise £50k.\n\nMoney gone, and yet they jump ship back to company A and claim they own all the stuff produced with the KS money that was raised by company B.\n\nNow company C comes along, takes a load of inventory, and buys a big stake in company A.\n\nSomething smells off.\n\nI for one have been a harsh critic of this game from when I saw the writing on the wall that it was going pants up. This was a pity as I love the background,the idea and actually the SLA: Cannibal Sector One skirmish game, was deeply involved in the development and help play test it.\n\nHowever, having read through and played the new PDF of the rules I am really happy for the future of the kickstarter, which is in the last stages of fulfilment and the future of the game. Do I regret backing the game? the answer is yes I do, but hindsight is a wonderful thing, do I think that the future for the game is good? well yes I do and I wish all involved great success, do I think I will get all my kickstarter? Yes I do but it will not be all I wanted but I am getting the ability to swap out parts to the valve of my pledge.\n\n511 backers pledged £46,743 to help bring this project to life.\n\nAnd Finally…\n\nWe are now able to better understand the entire cost to Word Forge Games and Nightfall Games to complete this Kickstarter. We will have spent £20k across the initial investment and of our own money and thousands of unpaid hours on making this happen. We did not see any money from this Kickstarter since we took over (or for the entire year before). We did this because we believe it is the right thing to do and also believe in SLA Industries and its future. – Cheers Mark, Shep, Dave and Jared\n\nNice to see pledges getting delivered. So what did happen to the £46,743? As Daruma had that money, and some of the Nightfall folks were Daruma folks, then was it the case that they got paid by Daruma out of the £46,743?\n\nI suspect that will/may become clear after the liquidation process, but as I commented on your comments in the other BoW post, you need to understand the difference between an executive director and a director. As said there the two Nightfall and Daruma Directors /shareholders were not executive directors of Daruma and hence not responsible for the spending of money nor had any control over it. Now they do with Nightfall, the KS is happening.\n\nI have been a long time dissenter of SLA as what they are going for wasnt what I saw SLA to be. That and the fact Daruma were running into difficulties and the reading was on the wall for those to read, long before the liquidation. Now Word Forge Games and Nightfall have picked it up it is going to see the light of day and for that I am chuffed, good on them.\n\nThe only thing this and Hysterical Games have done, regardless to how well meaning they are is to kill my trust in Kickstarters, I have back about ten KS and four have failed."
