NFG took the licence back\n\nI think it's still reasonable to say that WOTC were no longer interested in SLA because they were no longer interested in RPGs full stop, but I have amended it to say \"no longer interested in the game (or in RPGs in general, in one case)\", and to rephrase \"dropped by\" to \"only for Nightfall Games to reclaim the licence\".\n\nI don't think it is unfair to characterise Cubicle 7 as losing interest in the game because... well, look at how long they had the licence, look at how much in the way of actual new product (rather than reprints) they got around to making. If there is information to the effect that Cubicle 7 were genuinely interested in actually pulling their finger out and stepping up support for the game, but NFG yanked the licence anyway, I'm happy to amend further.\n\nFor this new edition, Nightfall are now putting the products out all by themselves again, after spending almost a quarter of a century trying to make variations on a \"we do the development, you publish the books\" arrangement work.\n\nAs is stated further down this essay: Between Cubicle 7 and Daruma, NFG published their own products and have also done so since 2018.\n\nAdded clarification that some products came out between C7 and Daruma, but the general point stands that for nearly a quarter of a century up to 2018 there were repeated attempts to work with external publishers.\n\n'It wasn't enough to keep Daruma alive'\n\nDaruma's failure was down to mismanagement by the managing and finance (executive) directors.\n\nAdded clarification here.\n\n'and had a dedicated line developer (first Dave Allsop, then James Desborough)'\n\nNeither were given a budget to do the job they were titled with, hence were not able to do their job. To be fair Cubicle 7 of now is very different to the same of yesteryear.\n\nThat's genuinely interesting! I've added this clarification but I don't think it really changes the general thrust of my point that Cubicle 7 talked a good talk about the game but didn't really put that much weight behind it - after all, if they really cared, they'd have given Dave/James a budget to actually, yaknow, do something.\n\nBy my reckoning, the SLA Industries canon of official products now looks like this\n\nThe 2nd Edition core rulebook.\n\nThe 2nd Edition quickstart.\n\nCannibal Sector 1 – the one released in 2019, specifically. (Yes, there's two totally different supplements in the game line with the same title, one canonical and one non-canonical.)\n\nHunter Sheets Issue 1.\n\nHunter Sheets Issue 2.\n\nData Packet: Klick's End.\n\nThe 2nd Edition GM Screen and the booklet that comes with it.\n\nIncorrect:\n\nThe list above should also include:\n\nProgress Report 0\n\nProgress Report 1\n\nProgress Report 2\n\nProgress Report 3\n\nKarma\n\nData Packet: Momic.\n\nData Packet: Gator\n\nData Packet: Boomer\n\nData Packet: Titter\n\nData Packet: Puddle Hermit\n\nData Packet: The Dream.\n\nData Packet: Hominid.\n\nHunter Sheets: Red Alert.\n\nGM Pack: 1st Edition\n\nOK, I see what's happened here: I assumed, when you guys yanked a ton of products from sale, that those products were no longer considered canonical, because I thought it'd be totally wild to just make chunks of your game's canon unavailable for purchase when you could just leave it up, maybe slap on a \"buyer beware\" warning for products where (like Karma) you believe the PDF is not particularly good (and maybe drop the price to something you consider fair for a rather crap PDF), and keep the long tail going.\n\nI have amended to clarify that the list is \"of officially-purchasable products now looks like this (excluding brief magazine-type releases like the Progress Report series and other very brief releases)\", so it's not just the list of canonical products, it's the list of canonical products which can still be bought from Nightfall.\n\nhere is the list of products which have been declared uncanonical\n\nThe original Cannibal Sector 1 sourcebook from when Cubicle 7 was selling the game.\n\nKarma.\n\nMort Sourcebook.\n\nThe Key of Delhyread.\n\nThe Contract Directory.\n\nData Packet: Ursa Carrien.\n\nData Packet: Momic.\n\nData Packet: The Dream.\n\nData Packet: Hominid.\n\nHunter Sheets: Red Alert.\n\nIncorrect:\n\nhere is the list of products which have been declared non-canon:\n\nCS1.\n\nMort Sourcebook.\n\nThe Key of Delhyread.\n\nThe Contract Directory.\n\nData Packet: Ursa Carrien.\n\nI have likewise amended to clarify that this list consists of \"products which have been declared uncanonical and/or been yanked from sale\", to make it clear that some of these products have been hard-decanonised, some of them have simply been yanked from purchase (even as PDFs). I have made some other amendments elsewhere in line with that.\n\nIn short, a clear majority of the products that have been put out for SLA Industries at this point are now uncanonical. etc.. - Full paragraph and therefore following 3 paragraphs of supposition and for that matter, most of the rest of the section.\n\nIncorrect\n\nOf course, they may feel that some of their older products are very significantly flawed in ways beyond simply not matching current canon\n\nnot the case:\n\nAs stated when the FIVE products we announced as non-canon: they have content that is incorrect vs the newer canon, or were no longer in keeping with current canon.\n\nCS1 - superceded by Cannibal Sector 1\n\nMort Sourcebook. - large sections superseded by Cannibal Sector 1 and subsequent publications (shivers world maps etc)\n\nThe Key of Delhyread. - not in keeping with current product\n\nThe Contract Directory. - large sections superseded by Cannibal Sector 1 and subsequent publications\n\nData Packet: Ursa Carrien. - not in keeping with current canon\n\n\"This doesn't represent our ideals\" is the sort of phrasing people use when they want to say \"this had really offensive implications and we don't really stand by it any more\" without directly saying that\n\nincorrect in this case.\n\nOK, edited to reflect this statement from you.\n\nRegarding Desborough: We no longer work with him, in the same we don't with many other prior contributors (for a plethora of different reasons). His writing being present in a book was not the reason for deleting the product from canon.\n\nOK, edited to reflect this.\n\nNightfall freelancer Tim Dedopulos\n\nTim was not a freelancer, he was a company director and shareholder of Nightfall Games and was tasked with 'managing director' roles\n\nI have corrected this.\n\nThis is largely to be expected – it's essentially the same game, designed by many of the same people (Dave Allsop and Jared Earle in particular)\n\nDave Allsop and Jared Earle are the only people on both 1st and 2nd Ed design team\n\nI have reworded to take this into account.\n\n'The Truth' vs 'the Truth document'.\n\nthe essay writer appears to have missed the difference between a 'concept' and a 'document', even though they quote this:\n\n'The Truth was a word document guide supplied to commissioned writers back in the 1990s'.\n\nAll supposition and statements beyond and build on this error should be re-presented with this error fixed.\n\nOK, this is a stretch. I think it's completely reasonable to take the approach of using \"The Truth\" sometimes to refer to that document, and sometimes to refer to the general concepts outlined in that document - especially since that document was where most of the SLA fanbase encountered those concepts for the first time anyway. (Was the name \"Dr. Crantham\" ever used in any officially-released 1st edition product? I can't remember it if so.)\n\nI have included a paragraph to note that I am using it in both senses but beyond that I don't really think this is a correction of fact.\n\nI am going to be frank here: given the struggles they've had to maintain a small, small trickle of new SLA Industries products issuing forth over the quarter century of the game's existence, I think any approach which says \"We'll save that until the next product\" represents astonishing hubris.\n\nBy the essay writers own comments higher in their essay and including documents they overlooked: NFG either directly or with partners has produced: 20 documents (books and PDFs). In total well over 1500 pages of product. The driest spell was with Cubicle 7 and in the time since Daruma there have been over 10 releases and 2 more significant books announced.\n\nRight, but you gotta admit a lot of those pages come out in chunks. That Cubicle 7 dry spell was a doozy, and the biggest new releases since then are the new CS1 book and the 2nd edition core book. If you add up the 2nd edition core, the new CS1, the 1st edition core, and the major Wizards-era-and-earlier supplements (Karma and Mort Directory), you're already most of the way there.\n\nIn addition, over 1500 pages of product between 20 documents might be a bunch of work... but the game debuted in 1993. If we take the 27 years from then to 2020 into account, we're looking at less than one release per year, or an average of only 56-ish pages a year. I don't think it's unfair to characterise that as a \"trickle\". It's been a trickle with the occasional burst of activity, sure, but it's far from a consistent pace of output.\n\nSorry, this just isn't a correction of fact.\n\nwhilst the absolutely badass term \"Brain Waster\" has been replaced with with the drably generic \"Eban\",\n\nIncorrect: Eban is the species name, Brain Waster/Waster is the common name\n\nClarified.\n\nsome setting features have been removed as a result of this – Rust Alley,\n\nRust Alley is mentioned\n\nAnd mentioned as kind of no longer being a big deal. I have clarified but again, not really a correction of fact.\n\nI have tried to implement such corrections of fact as outline above, and I've put in a link to your correction post at the end of the review so that people don't have to take my word for it.\n\nI have amended to clarify that the list is \"of officially-purchasable products now looks like this (excluding brief magazine-type releases like the Progress Report series and other very brief releases)\", so it's not just the list of canonical products, it's the list of canonical products which can still be bought from Nightfall.\n\nIts very interesting that you chose to exclude the Progress Reports from your narrative due to size of document, yet make a big thing about the removal of, for example, Key of Delhyread, Ursa Carrien and Hominid. Both Ursa Carrien and Hominid are 6 page documents and Key is 36 pages. The Progress Reports vary from 8-40 pages.\n\nAdditionally mixing de-canonised and removed from sales products in your narrative is misleading to the reader.\n\n5 products have been de-canonised, yet your presentation mixes that with the recently removed from sale ('yanked') items - your 'in depth' discussion further down does not include Ursa Carrien, so again the reader can not define which is which.\n\nThe combination of these points suggest at best, a laziness and at worst a hatchet job - don't let the truth get in the way of a good story hay?\n\nIn short, a clear majority of the major products that have been put out for SLA Industries at this point (not counting brief little releases like Progress Report) are now either outright uncanonical, or simply not available for sale.\n\nThis statement is 100% incorrect given the above.\n\nHere is the list of products which have been declared non-canon:\n\nCS1.- PDF removed from sale 2 years ago. Book has been out of print for approx 10 years.\n\nMort Sourcebook. - PDF removed from sale 2 years ago. Book has been out of print for approx 15 years.\n\nThe Key of Delhyread. - PDF removed from sale 2 years ago. Book has been out of print for approx 20 years.\n\nThe Contract Directory. - PDF removed from sale 2 years ago. Book has been out of print for approx 20 years.\n\nData Packet: Ursa Carrien. - PDF removed from sale 2 years ago.\n\nHere is a list of products still Canon and available as either PDF, PDF and book form or just 'actual':\n\nThe 1st Edition core rulebook - PDF and book\n\nThe 2nd Edition core rulebook - PDF and book.\n\nThe 2nd Edition quickstart - PDF and book.\n\nCannibal Sector 1 - PDF and book\n\nHunter Sheets Issue 1. - PDF only, book long out of print\n\nHunter Sheets Issue 2. - PDF and book\n\nData Packet: Klick's End. - PDF only\n\nThe 2nd Edition GM Screen and the booklet that comes with it. - not available in PDF form\n\nProgress Report 0 - PDF only\n\nProgress Report 1 - PDF only\n\nProgress Report 2 - PDF only\n\nProgress Report 3 - PDF only\n\nCannibal Sector 1 miniatures rulebook - PDF and book\n\nCanon and not for sale:\n\nGM Pack: 1st Edition - no longer sold in any form by NFG, nor has it been for many years\n\nData Packet: Gator - no longer sold in any form by NFG, nor has it been for many years\n\nData Packet: Boomer - no longer sold in any form by NFG, nor has it been for many years\n\nData Packet: Titter - no longer sold in any form by NFG, nor has it been for many years\n\nData Packet: Puddle Hermit - no longer sold in any form by NFG, nor has it been for many years\n\nData Packet: Croak - no longer sold in any form by NFG, nor has it been for many years\n\nKarma - as explained readily available in book form on resale sites. PDF was not of a quality we were happy with. PDF recently 'yanked' from sale. Book has been out of print for approx 20 years.\n\nData Packet: The Dream. - superseded by 2nd Ed and Collateral (June 2021). PDF recently 'yanked' from sale. Book has been out of print for approx 10 years.\n\nData Packet: Hominid. - completely superseded in 2nd Ed, PDF recently 'yanked' from sale.\n\nHunter Sheets: Red Alert. PDF recently 'yanked' from sale. Book has been out of print for approx 10 years.\n\nData Packet: Momic. PDF recently 'yanked' from sale. Book has been out of print for approx 10 years.\n\nyanked from sale\n\nwe gave over 1 months notice\n\nMarkRapson said:\n\n'The Truth' vs 'the Truth document'.\n\nthe essay writer appears to have missed the difference between a 'concept' and a 'document', even though they quote this:\n\n'The Truth was a word document guide supplied to commissioned writers back in the 1990s'.\n\nAll supposition and statements beyond and build on this error should be re-presented with this error fixed.\n\nOK, this is a stretch. I think it's completely reasonable to take the approach of using \"The Truth\" sometimes to refer to that document, and sometimes to refer to the general concepts outlined in that document - especially since that document was where most of the SLA fanbase encountered those concepts for the first time anyway. (Was the name \"Dr. Crantham\" ever used in any officially-released 1st edition product? I can't remember it if so.)\n\nI have included a paragraph to note that I am using it in both senses but beyond that I don't really think this is a correction of fact.\n\nAgain it seems here that even with evidence your original assumptions were wrong you choose to ignore said evidence. Again this is either pure laziness or further evidence of a hatchet job in action.\n\nInclusion of a paragraph noting you are using it in both senses, doesn't counter that doing so is wrong. You quote NFG saying 'The Truth was a word document guide supplied to commissioned writers back in the 1990s', yet completely ignore that fact leaving the subsequent writing in place even though that is incorrect.\n\nADDITIONAL:\n\nMort Sourcebook, the final product of the Wizards of the Coast run. Morton Smith is credited as a co-author, and Smith had been onboard from the start of the game line, but he was one of many hands contributing to that project and all the others don't seem to have written for the line before.\n\nMorton wrote a significant part of the 16 page Progress Report 1 and is credited as a writer in it.\n\nA good swathe of the books that have been decanonised simply can't be disavowed as not really reflecting the creators' intentions – Nightfall themselves wrote and published them! Apparently, in their view the Karma book is now so broken that it isn't worth selling to people any more – but they haven't provided an exact explanation of why that is the case. Perhaps in the case of some material there has been a genuine falling-out between at least one of the Nightfall prime movers and former contributors, as James Desborough has hinted at, which would make it unprofessional to comment on the specific books involved in that bad feeling – but surely that isn't the case for stuff like Karma, which was written by the exact same people who wrote the original core book.\n\nIs 4 books and a small PDF really a good swathe of the books?\n\nKarma is not de-canonised. I did not say it was broken...no one at NFG has said it was broken. The PDF is not of a quality we are happy to offer. - that is the explanation from us.\n\nJames is either the sole writer or a co-writer in at least 2 items that are still canon (HS2 and Gator) and two items that are not (CS1 and Ursa Carrien)\n\nI have amended to clarify that the list is \"of officially-purchasable products now looks like this (excluding brief magazine-type releases like the Progress Report series and other very brief releases)\", so it's not just the list of canonical products, it's the list of canonical products which can still be bought from Nightfall.\n\nIts very interesting that you chose to exclude the Progress Reports from your narrative due to size of document, yet make a big thing about the removal of, for example, Key of Delhyread, Ursa Carrien and Hominid. Both Ursa Carrien and Hominid are 6 page documents and Key is 36 pages. The Progress Reports vary from 8-40 pages.\n\nI make a thing about them because they were explicitly mentioned as being decanonised/removed from sale but I didn't go into that much more depth on them. I didn't want to add in little details about piddly little 2 page PDF supplements I didn't notice on the RPGGeek listings when I originally did the article because who could possibly care? Apparently you, so I've amended the lists.\n\nAdditionally mixing de-canonised and removed from sales products in your narrative is misleading to the reader.\n\n5 products have been de-canonised, yet your presentation mixes that with the recently removed from sale ('yanked') items - your 'in depth' discussion further down does not include Ursa Carrien, so again the reader can not define which is which.\n\nOK, I have edited one more time to make it explicit which 5 are officially uncanonical.\n\nThe combination of these points suggest at best, a laziness and at worst a hatchet job - don't let the truth get in the way of a good story hay?\n\nIn short, a clear majority of the major products that have been put out for SLA Industries at this point (not counting brief little releases like Progress Report) are now either outright uncanonical, or simply not available for sale.\n\nThis statement is 100% incorrect given the above.\n\nHere is the list of products which have been declared non-canon:\n\nCS1.- PDF removed from sale 2 years ago. Book has been out of print for approx 10 years.\n\nMort Sourcebook. - PDF removed from sale 2 years ago. Book has been out of print for approx 15 years.\n\nThe Key of Delhyread. - PDF removed from sale 2 years ago. Book has been out of print for approx 20 years.\n\nThe Contract Directory. - PDF removed from sale 2 years ago. Book has been out of print for approx 20 years.\n\nData Packet: Ursa Carrien. - PDF removed from sale 2 years ago.\n\nOK, so that's 5 products in the \"outright uncanonical\" category.\n\nHere is a list of products still Canon and available as either PDF, PDF and book form or just 'actual':\n\nThe 1st Edition core rulebook - PDF and book\n\nThe 2nd Edition core rulebook - PDF and book.\n\nThe 2nd Edition quickstart - PDF and book.\n\nCannibal Sector 1 - PDF and book\n\nHunter Sheets Issue 1. - PDF only, book long out of print\n\nHunter Sheets Issue 2. - PDF and book\n\nData Packet: Klick's End. - PDF only\n\nThe 2nd Edition GM Screen and the booklet that comes with it. - not available in PDF form\n\nProgress Report 0 - PDF only\n\nProgress Report 1 - PDF only\n\nProgress Report 2 - PDF only\n\nProgress Report 3 - PDF only\n\nCannibal Sector 1 miniatures rulebook - PDF and book\n\nThat's 13 products in the \"canonical and available for sale\" category.\n\nCanon and not for sale:\n\nGM Pack: 1st Edition - no longer sold in any form by NFG, nor has it been for many years\n\nData Packet: Gator - no longer sold in any form by NFG, nor has it been for many years\n\nData Packet: Boomer - no longer sold in any form by NFG, nor has it been for many years\n\nData Packet: Titter - no longer sold in any form by NFG, nor has it been for many years\n\nData Packet: Puddle Hermit - no longer sold in any form by NFG, nor has it been for many years\n\nData Packet: Croak - no longer sold in any form by NFG, nor has it been for many years\n\nKarma - as explained readily available in book form on resale sites. PDF was not of a quality we were happy with. PDF recently 'yanked' from sale. Book has been out of print for approx 20 years.\n\nData Packet: The Dream. - superseded by 2nd Ed and Collateral (June 2021). PDF recently 'yanked' from sale. Book has been out of print for approx 10 years.\n\nData Packet: Hominid. - completely superseded in 2nd Ed, PDF recently 'yanked' from sale.\n\nHunter Sheets: Red Alert. PDF recently 'yanked' from sale. Book has been out of print for approx 10 years.\n\nData Packet: Momic. PDF recently 'yanked' from sale. Book has been out of print for approx 10 years.\n\nThat's 11 products in the \"simply not available for sale\" category. (I've updated the article to note that by that I mean \"sale of first-hand hard copies or PDFs from Nightfall\", not the second-hand market).\n\nNow, let's count shall we?\n\n13 products canon and officially available for sale.\n\n5 products uncanonical.\n\n11 products which are simply not available for sale (but still canonical).\n\nThat means our total for the category of \"either outright uncanonical, or simply not available for sale\" is 16.\n\n13 is less than 16. 55% of a product line constitutes a clear majority.\n\nSorry buddy, but the facts are on my side on this one.\n\nyanked from sale\n\nwe gave over 1 months notice\n\nPulling it from sale is still pulling it from sale if you give notice. Not a correction of fact.\n\nOK, this is a stretch. I think it's completely reasonable to take the approach of using \"The Truth\" sometimes to refer to that document, and sometimes to refer to the general concepts outlined in that document - especially since that document was where most of the SLA fanbase encountered those concepts for the first time anyway. (Was the name \"Dr. Crantham\" ever used in any officially-released 1st edition product? I can't remember it if so.)\n\nI have included a paragraph to note that I am using it in both senses but beyond that I don't really think this is a correction of fact.\n\nAgain it seems here that even with evidence your original assumptions were wrong you choose to ignore said evidence. Again this is either pure laziness or further evidence of a hatchet job in action.\n\nInclusion of a paragraph noting you are using it in both senses, doesn't counter that doing so is wrong. You quote NFG saying 'The Truth was a word document guide supplied to commissioned writers back in the 1990s', yet completely ignore that fact leaving the subsequent writing in place even though that is incorrect.\n\nPlease specifically outline the error of fact here, if you can.\n\nIs it not true that The Truth was a word document guide issued to writers in the 1990s? If that isn't true, why did you guys say it?\n\nIs it not true that fans generally use \"the Truth\" to refer to setting secrets referred to in that guide? If you don't believe it's true I consider that a difference of opinion, not fact.\n\nIs it not true that some of those setting secrets are still central to 2nd edition? If that's the case, would you mind double-checking the intro fiction to 2nd edition and reconsidering your answer?\n\nI can only work with the facts in front of me. If you can cite a fact which I have missed above which would massively change my general assessment, please disclose that fact. Otherwise, based on the facts I have, I don't see what the problem is and also can't quite understand what you are getting at because you are expressing yourself incredibly poorly on this point.\n\nADDITIONAL:\n\nMort Sourcebook, the final product of the Wizards of the Coast run. Morton Smith is credited as a co-author, and Smith had been onboard from the start of the game line, but he was one of many hands contributing to that project and all the others don't seem to have written for the line before.\n\nMorton wrote a significant part of the 16 page Progress Report 1 and is credited as a writer in it.\n\nI don't see how that fact has any bearing on the cited text.\n\nA good swathe of the books that have been decanonised simply can't be disavowed as not really reflecting the creators' intentions – Nightfall themselves wrote and published them! Apparently, in their view the Karma book is now so broken that it isn't worth selling to people any more – but they haven't provided an exact explanation of why that is the case.

I did not say it was broken...no one at NFG has said it was broken. The PDF is not of a quality we are happy to offer. - that is the explanation from us.\n\nJames is either the sole writer or a co-writer in at least 2 items that are still canon (HS2 and Gator) and two items that are not (CS1 and Ursa Carrien)\n\nFine, tweaked."
