        "text": "Alix Earle spilled on her love life after a year full of relationship drama.\n\nThe 23-year-old TikTok star was linked to Tyler Wade in late 2022 before she started dating her current boyfriend Braxton Berrios.\n\nBoth relationships sparked drama online, and she decided to share her side of the story during the newest episode of her Hot Mess podcast.\n\nRead more for Alix Earle’s side of the story…\n\nAccording to Alix, the drama started when she confirmed that she and Tyler, who she referred to as “baseball boy,” were no longer an item during a live stream. The news went viral after it was reposted online with reports suggesting that the breakup was because Tyler wasn’t posting Alix on Instagram.\n\nThat wasn’t the case: “It was such a toxic relationship, which is why I kind of got to the point where I was like, ‘Oh he didn’t post me. We broke up.’ That was just one of the things we would fight about,” she said. “We only dated for three months so it really didn’t get too serious.”\n\nAlix continued, saying, “Everything that I did, he s-it on. He did not support me at all, especially when it came to social media stuff.”\n\nThere were other issues in the relationship, with Alix alleging that he didn’t want to have a relationship with her friends and that he was liking photos of models and more on social media.\n\nThe relationship ended, though they sparked reunion rumors a few times after the fact, and Tyler reportedly tried to rekindle things at various points.\n\nIn February 2023, Alix met Braxton, who she referred to as “NFL man.”\n\nThey wound up hanging out at a Super Bowl party. Alix stressed that nothing happened between them during the party. However, Braxton unfollowed Alix on Instagram after the night, prompting her to ask him why.\n\nHe explained that he needed to go get closure with his ex Sophia Culpo, who found out that they were spotted together at the party.\n\nIn March, Braxton and Alix went out on a date. At the same time, she noticed that Tyler had followed Sophia on Instagram and was interacting with her content.\n\nThe following month, Alix and Braxton were spotted at lunch together, leading to her being called a “homewrecker.”\n\n“I was like wait, what? It turns out that Braxton‘s ex had been posting on her story, even had a highlight up on her Instagram, saying that basically she was cheated on by NFL man with me,” Alix recalled.\n\nAlix said, “I was so down bad and sad about these comments because for personal reasons and stuff I’ve gone through, being called a homewrecker is probably the most triggering thing you could say to me.”\n\nAfter gaining some perspective, she realized she didn’t do anything wrong and opted not to comment on the allegations, which seemingly stemmed from her night with Braxton at the Super Bowl party.\n\nHer relationship with Braxton continued to grow, so she shared him on her TikTok, prompting more drama. Alix said that Sophia “comes out and basically starts talking her s-it online, basically going along with this narrative that I was a homewrecker in their relationship.”\n\n“I am one for, listen: You want to air your stuff out online, go for it. I clearly do that myself, but this was my first time where I feel like I had been pulled into this huge scandal. Like it’s all over my TikTok, all the little gossip pages, all the press is picking this up,” she said.\n\nDespite knowing the truth, she said that the drama sent her to “a bad place” and left her considering if they should take a break.\n\nAlix added that Sophia reached out via DM to apologize, leaving her thinking that they had moved on.\n\nHowever, a few months later, Sophia brought up her relationship with Braxton again while on the Barely Filtered podcast. The episode alluded to him cheating with Alix, and it aired the same day that Alix‘s Call Her Daddy interview premiered.\n\n“I kept quiet. I was like, ‘You know what? It’s not worth it,’” she recalled, opting instead “to take the mature route.”\n\nWith the benefit of perspective, Alix decided to tell her side of the story on her own podcast. She stressed that she was in a good place with them and that she felt respected and heard by him.\n\n“I really do appreciate NFL man, and he is the best and is so respectful of me and I’m trying to be my best self,” she said.\n\nWe’ll update you if either Tyler or Sophia have anything to say about the episode.\n\nIf you missed it, earlier this month Braxton spilled on his relationship with Alix and if he plans to marry her."
