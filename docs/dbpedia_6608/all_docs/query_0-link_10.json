        "text": "The Terminator RPG Campaign Book is a campaign book of fifteen interlinked missions for The Terminator RPG.\n\nPublisher Summary[]\n\nIn the Dark Future, the Resistance stands on the cusp of victory. Skynet’s defense grid is vulnerable and John Connor has a plan to smash it and win the war. But the insidious AI has decided to play dirty, experimenting with time displacement technology in an attempt to shear the Resistance from its roots and murder its leader before he’s even born. The mission to save John Connor has already begun, but it isn’t the only battle that must play out in the past. The Resistance may start with Connor, but it ends with you.\n\nPart of Nightfall Games’ Signature Series, this work contains original missions as well as scenarios inspired by the Terminator graphic novels. Designed for 3 to 6 players, the fifteen missions presented here form the framework of a series campaign that can start in the future and end in the past.\n\nCurated by Andrew E.C. Gaska and E.L. Thomas, The Terminator Campaign Book features the talents of a wide variety of creators who offer points of view as varied as the ever-shifting timelines you struggle through in your war against the machines. While all of the missions in this book can form a campaign, each is written in a format unique to the author and embellished with their signature touches.\n\nThe future may seem set, but second chances lie in the past. Now more than ever, there is no fate but what you make for yourself.\n\nDescription[]\n\nThe Campaign Book includes:\n\nAn Introduction with tips on how to link the various missions.\n\n15 Missions\n\n2 Short Stories\n\n7 Pre-Generated Characters\n\n6 Unique Non-Player Characters\n\nCampaign Book[]\n\nThe Campaign provides information on the overall arc of the campaign, as well as the links between scenarios.\n\nMissions come next, and there are 15 in total.

The scenarios are listed below.\n\nTwo Short Stories are mixed in with the missions.\n\nAppendix 1: Player Characters contains seven characters designed for the mission Flatline, and they may be used as pre-generated characters or as NPCs.\n\nAppendix 2: Non-Player Characters includes six unique non-player characters (NPCs) and lists what mission they are featured in.\n\nContents[]\n\nHot Potato by Mark Rapson[1]\n\nArms Race by Richard August[2]\n\nKill//Switch by Paul Baldowski[3]\n\nFuture Tense by Richard August[4]\n\nThe Devil’s Night Murders by Matt John\n\nBad Block by Jon Hodgson[5]\n\nShort Story: Infiltration by Chris Mcauley\n\nFlatline by Jason Durall[6]\n\nSkynet Bytes Forward by Benn Graybeaton\n\nThe Centurion by Mark Rapson\n\nPast Tense by Richard August[7]\n\nDeath In The Valley by Jared Earle[8]\n\nTertiary Objectives by Matt John[9]\n\nShort Story: Words by E.L.
