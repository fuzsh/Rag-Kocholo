        "text": "North Texas held an open football practice and the Mean Green Kickoff event at the HUB Club at DATCU Stadium on Saturday. The event, which followed practice, included North Texas Athletic Director Jared Mosley and several Mean Green athletics head coaches, including Eric Morris, who addressed the challenges faced by the North Texas defense in 2023.\n\nDuring the previous season, North Texas underwent major shifts, such as transitioning to a new conference, appointing a new football coach, and introducing a new defensive scheme, among other changes. The challenges of the new defensive strategy became evident in its inaugural year, as the team ranked last in the FBS, allowing an average of 476.4 yards per game.\n\nMorris expressed his anticipation of defensive growth as the team enters its second year in the scheme. Drawing from his experiences, he likened the current defensive challenges to his initial introduction of the air raid offense at Washington State under his former head coach at Texas Tech, Mike Leach. He noted that it was initially challenging to acclimate Leach and the team to the new system.\n\n\"We were in his place and his offense and we ran it every single day until they perfected it. Now, it took two years to get where we felt like we could drop them up front and if people didn't want to do it our way we'd find guys that would come in and play for our program, for us,\" Morris said. \"So, I kind of went back to that memory of mine and remembered how bad we were the first year at Washington State. We got a little bit better in year two. Year three through seven, we were a bowl team competing for Pac 12 championships, and so there's always a process to this, especially when you put in a unique and new schematic.\"\n\nMorris stated that he never lost faith in the defensive scheme and appreciates how the defense has been aggressive during the summer and the first few days of fall camp.\n\nSenior receiver Damon Ward Jr. is a player Morris mentioned shed 15 pounds to gain agility for the offense. He has quickly adapted to the role that Ja'Mori Maclin excelled in during the 2023 season. During the open practice, true freshman quarterback Cash McCollum connected with Ward on a deep route near the sideline. Ward kept his foot in bounds while diving across the sideline, resulting in a solid gain.\n\nMorris labeled junior tight end Oscar Hammond as a \"superstar\" for the team in 2024. He continued to be heavily involved in plays on Saturday. Hammond transferred to North Texas after spending two years at Central Oklahoma, where he amassed 33 receptions for 463 yards and four touchdowns in 2023.\n\nJunior quarterback Chandler Morris was absent from practice due to a personal matter. As a result, freshmen Drew Mestemaker, McCollum and senior Grant Tisdale took turns getting reps. The training session encompassed seven-on-seven drills, special teams return exercises and 11-on-11 action.\n\nAfter graduating early from China Spring High School, McCollum joined the team at the start of the spring semester. This provided him ample time to familiarize himself with the team's scheme and playbook. As a true freshman, standing at six-foot-four and weighing 210 pounds, McCollum made a strong impression during Saturday's open practice and emerged as the standout quarterback of the day despite making some rookie mistakes.\n\nIn the 11-on-11 drills, senior cornerback Ridge Texada intercepted a pass from McCollum meant for sophomore receiver Dalton Carnes. Carnes appeared to slip while running his route, allowing Texada to make the interception. Texada remains a standout as the top cornerback for the Mean Green defense. Noteworthy defensive back performances during camp include redshirt freshman Brian Nelson II and sophomore Texas transfer X'Avion Brice.\n\nDuring practice, there was a noteworthy moment when McCollum threw a long touchdown pass to junior wide receiver Jeremiah Aaron along the sideline. Aaron had played four games with West Virginia last season before getting injured and deciding to take a redshirt.\n\nMcCollum has a real opportunity to secure the backup quarterback position behind Chandler Morris because every quarterback from the 2023 season with experience in the offense left the program. During the 2024 spring game, former quarterback Stone Earle played for the \"Green\" team, while Reese Mooney and McCollum played for the \"White\" team. Since then, both Earle and Mooney have left, leaving McCollum with the most experience in terms of reading the playbook.\n\nDuring the special teams drills, junior wide receiver DT Sheffield stood out as the first returner, demonstrating his agility as he evaded pursuing defenders with nimble footwork. Following him, Aaron also showed great dynamism in the return game, smoothly dodging tackles and gaining yardage. Some other participants included senior Blair Conwright, sophomore Landon Sides, and freshman Wyatt Young, who also took some reps.\n\nNotable standouts were Sheffield and Aaron, who had previous experience in returning punts and kickoffs at JUCO. Aaron, in particular, had a solid track record from his time at Navarro College in 2021 and 2022, with 29 kickoff returns for 720 yards, averaging 24.8 yards per return and securing a touchdown.\n\nPreparations are underway for the second week of fall camp as North Texas gears up for the upcoming season opener in Mobile, Alabama, against South Alabama on August 31. The game will kick off at 4 p.m., and Eric Morris has begun acclimating the players to the heat with Saturday afternoon's practice at DATCU Stadium.\n\n\"It was pretty spicy out there,\" Eric Morris said. \"We're trying to take it slow, especially right now in the afternoon, but seeing the first couple of games that we have, it's going to be played in the heat. Especially South Alabama, it's going to be a kick at 4 p.m. So, we're trying to acclimate the guys slowly here to the heat and think it will be a big advantage for us once we get out playing in it.\""
