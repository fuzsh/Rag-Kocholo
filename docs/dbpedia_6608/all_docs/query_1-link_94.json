A quarter of a century ago, a super intelligent AI—Skynet—branded humanity its enemy and nuked us off the planet. When some of us survived, it built Hunter-Killers to finish the job. Now the world is a charred wasteland—broken by the machines we built. Our own creations, our own hubris. It is no longer some distant future—it is tonight. Now. It’s the 2020s. The machines look like us— cybernetic Terminators made of metal, cloaked in human flesh. Mechanical monsters light up the landscape with searing plasma bolts. They sweep the ruins to slaughter us and intern the survivors in death camps. This is our future—a world on fire. They think they have won. But there is one last chance for humankind, a secret weapon that Skynet in its infinite calculations could never have anticipated—you. You were born to resist. Either you’re too stuborn or too stupid to roll over and die. You’re armed and ready to do whatever is necessary to save your people—to save the entire human race. Congratulations. The terror and desperation of facing unstoppable murder machines is yours to bear. Only united with your fellow Resistance fighters can you hope to defeat them. Purple-white lasers strobe across a desolate wasteland cutting your teammates to ribbons. Mari straight up disintegrates, the vapor of her boiled flesh choking in your throat. Depac’s limbs fly apart as he explodes— impaling Tommy with a flying rib bone. Gurgling blood, Tommy’s dead before he hits the ground. A lucky little bitch, only you managed to get your head down in time—only you are alive.\n\nFIND YOUR FATE The technophobic dystopian future world of The Terminator is a result of humankind’s arrogance— as happens so often in the world, we are responsible for the very thing that is killing us. As time would have it, the present has caught up to that future. The threat is real and the threat is now.\n\nJOIN THE RESISTANCE\n\nthese player characters are fictional people whose actions are directly controlled by you—not by the game. The Director (also called gamemaster) controls every other character in the game and is your guide through gameplay. You have the option to play either pre-generated characters or to create your own—tailored to your preferences, weapon choices, and role within your team. How to proceed is then up to you. If the game seems to be telling your character to go right, you can turn around and go left. Left might be a really bad idea—you may get yourself killed by going left—or you may find an out of the box way of solving the problem. Either way, the choice is yours—as are the consequences. In ‘The Terminator RPG’, most player characters come from an alternative and post-apocalyptic version of today—the once “far future” of the 2020s. You play Resistance fighters struggling against the machine onslaught of an artificial intelligence called Skynet. You take the role of rebel time travelers sent back to various points in time to stop Skynet from altering history. If you do go back in time, however, be careful you don’t fuck up and erase yourself from existence. Don’t be the dumbass who kills their own grandparents before they’re born. The Terminator also allows you to play natives of any other historical time period, targeted by Terminators and trying to stay alive as a future hell is unleashed around you. You can play in any time zone—including the 1980s, the ‘Dark Years’ of the 2020s, and a possible further-future ‘Burning Earth’ of 2041—nearly twenty years after.\n\nTERMINATED From its inception, The Terminator franchise has been about second chances—that chance to rewind the clock and approach a problem with hindsight in mind. This applies to a machine that’s looking to alter the past just as much as it applies to you. If your character is killed, a new one can be brought in from the future, past, or present. That new character can be many things—another Resistance fighter, someone from another time— even an alternate you from a divergent timeline.\n\nBut who are you in all this? You and your friends assume the role of player characters in this mechanized nightmare. Sometimes called a PC,\n\n[.002 .002] ]\n\nThe Terminator RPG\n\nintroduction\n\n“The machines rose from the ashes of the nuclear fire. Their war to exterminate mankind had raged for decades, but the final battle would not be fought in the future. It would be fought here, in our present. Tonight…” —Sarah Connor\n\nThe Terminator RPG\n\n][.003 ][ .003]]\n\nChapter 01\n\nYour friends are dead. You grind your teeth as metal treads roll over rubble, pulverizing tissue, bone, and stone alike. Ducking low behind a broken bathtub with your phased plasma rifle at the ready, you slide past the looming HKTank. As the noisy behemoth sweeps the area for survivors, a low rumble resonates in your chest.\n\nDIRECTING THE aCTION In this role playing game, several players take the roles of characters within the Terminator universe—while the Director assumes control of all other characters and situations. Referred to as a gamemaster in other role playing games, the Director oversees the game’s story and action. While the Player’s Section of this book is intended for everyone, the Director’s Section is designed as a toolbox to allow the Director to create their own campaigns or one-shots, including detailed multi-session campaign arcs, campaign seeds, mini-missions, NPCs, weapons, locations, and enemy characters. All the main characters from the original film—Sarah Connor, Kyle Reese, and the T-800 are included, as are characters and situations from the Dark Horse graphic novels— along with all-new, never seen before Terminator variants and hardware. “There was a nuclear war. A few years from now, all this, this whole place, everything, it’s gone. Just gone. There were survivors. Here, there. Nobody even knew who started it. It was the machines, Sarah.” —Sergeant Kyle Reese, Tech-Com, DN38416.\n\naNOTHER NOW The main setting of the Terminator RPG is now, the 2020s—less than a decade before John Connor will lead a unified uprising in a desperate fatal assault against Skynet’s main servers. For the inhabitants of this ravaged world, that’s still a long time away. Right now there is chaos. There is no organized human resistance—there is no organized anything. This isn’t the 2020s you know. It’s not a world of social media squabbles about fake news and global pandemics. There is no media—there isn’t even civilization—only a combination of mechanized, chemical, and bioengineered death.\n\n[.004 .004] ]\n\nDrink from the wrong water tap and you’ll wind up with a belly full of tumors. Stay out in the rain too long and you’ll take twenty years off your life. In this world, nukes blasted the last vestiges of civilization away decades ago. World governments collapsed. Society disintegrated. Anarchy rules. The machines have won, and you are on your own.\n\nFACTIONS OF A FUTURE WAR This is a post-apocalyptic world of self survival. Small bands of humans live like lonely rats, scraping by on scraps of food buried in radioactive rubble. Scavengers and raiders squabble over who gets to steal the next guy’s fuel and water. The end is here. Humankind has fractured into small tribes and factions ruled by whomever has the biggest stick—the warlords. A blast of compressed air from above knocks you off your knees—powerful VTOL turbines whine overhead. Before you can recover, whitehot searchlights blind you. Flying death has you in its sights—an Aerial Hunter-Killer is after your ass. On your belly, you crawl through the shredded bodies of your friends, finally taking refuge under an overturned sedan.\n\n21ST CENTURY WARLORDS These self-proclaimed kingpins come from all walks of life—ex-military, gang leaders, police, religious leaders, organized crime—anyone who was able to hold on to weapons and resources when the bombs fell. The warlords have carved their own little fiefdoms out of the rubble. They demand tribute from those living in their territories under the pretense of providing them security and justice. If you’re a stranger with nothing to barter, you’d best rethink wandering into the wrong zone. If you are going in to trade, you better not be stupid enough to carry the goods on you. They will strip you of everything and take whatever the hell they want. The best you can hope for is imprisonment— the worst, death by exposure. Murder machines aren’t bad enough—even in this postmortem reality, we’re still trying to kill each other. It’s survival of the fittest, until the fittest get their skulls crushed beneath metal hooves and tank treads. Even when people are scratching each other’s eyes out over a crust of bread, they know\n\nThe Terminator RPG\n\nintroduction\n\nto stop when they hear the whine of servos and the flat thump of a plasma rifle. Everyone knows, when the machines come, you hide or you die. “Defense network computers. New, powerful, hooked into everything, trusted to run it all. They say it got smart - a new order of intelligence. Then it saw all people as a threat, not just the ones on the other side. It decided our fate in a microsecond. Extermination.” —Sergeant Kyle Reese, Tech-Com, DN38416.\n\nTHE MACHINES Developed in the 1990s by Cyberdyne Systems on a defense contract for the United States, Skynet was supposed to be the ultimate protection program against enemy attack. It did its job too well—deciding that humanity itself was what the world needed protection from. At the end of the century, the machine intelligence launched the United States nuclear arsenal at Russia, China, and other rival nations. Those countries did the same in turn—ensuring mutual destruction and the near end of the human race. Not content to let us die in the shadows, Skynet assumed control of automated plants and built war machines to hunt down the survivors. At first, no one realized what was going on—the A.I. had merely upgraded existing weapons of war into drones. For all they knew, the machines rolling through the rubble of their town are some invading force from another country. It’s when we started noticing there were no pilots—or even worse, discovering metal mockeries of them in their place—that humanity realized something else was going on. You belly-crawl through the busted trunk of a flipped car. Halfway into the back seat, a putrid apple-sweet stink bites your nostrils. You freeze—something here’s not right. You are not alone. This burnt out vehicle is someone’s home. An unwashed, wide-eyed old man is curled up tight under the steering wheel. His arms pulled taut to his chest, he’s been dusted with a fine yellow powder. His lips are curled back, his cracked teeth clamped like a vice. He’s dead, and you know why. The dust, the rotting fruit smell—it all adds up to some kind of chemical attack.\n\nThe Terminator RPG\n\nTERMINATORS Human guerillas captured one of the metal men that swept the wastelands looking for us. They soon hacked the bionic bastard and revealed the truth behind the attacks. From the Hunter-Killer Tanks, VTOLS, and Hydrofoils to the robotic troopers and flesh-covered cyborg infiltrators, all varieties of Skynet’s cybernetic soldiers have but one purpose-exterminate humanity with extreme prejudice. “We were that close to going out forever. But there was one man who taught us to fight, to storm the wire of the camps, to smash those metal motherfuckers into junk. He turned it around. He brought us back from the brink. His name is Connor. John Connor.” —Sergeant Kyle Reese, Tech-Com, DN38416.\n\nCOLLABORATORS Faced with death, a lot of people will do things they never thought they’d be capable of. Some might even betray the entire human race for a chance to survive. Many of those given a choice of collaboration or death have thrown in with Skynet—helping the AI develop the flesh coverings and behavior patterns needed to infiltrate human enclaves. Many collaborators are scientists and technicians working behind closed doors to further Skynet’s cause. Some work the human internment camps and some are spies— but Skynet doesn’t trust most humans to operate in its favor while out of sight. Still others are just simple people living in small villages. They have been allowed to exist and given bare minimum food and supplies—as long as they turn in any stragglers and report on any Resistance members that come across their path.\n\nTHE HUMAN RESISTaNCE One man knew who the enemy was—a man who had spent his entire life preparing for Skynet. That man’s ongoing mission is to unite pockets of the surviving civilian population and integrate them with the remnants of the military. That man is, of course, John Connor. Some say Connor is psychic—others claim he is psychotic. Rumors persist that he only knows so much because his father was part of Skynet’s design team—that Daddy Connor built the goddamn machine that murdered the world.\n\n][.005 ][ .005]]\n\nChapter 01\n\nStill others say John is a momma’s boy who was raised by a militant doomsayer crackpot—and through a coincidence or fate his mother just so happened to be proven right. His uncanny ability to predict Skynet’s strategies have many calling him a prophet and savior. Finally, there are those who believe John Connor is not a man—that he is an advanced Terminator prototype leading a robot rebellion against Skynet and using humankind as mere pawns. One way or another, Connor knows his shit, and without him the remnants of humanity would be beaten dead. Connor preaches that a unified human front is the only thing that will topple Skynet’s regime. We are far from making that happen. There are too many warlords, too many factions. What’s worse, most people still don’t know who sends the metal monsters to slaughter them. If we are ever going to truly organize, the people need to be informed—and that’s exactly what John Connor has set out to do.\n\nTECH-COM Tech-Com is an elite Resistance unit dedicated to fighting Skynet and its machine legions both digitally and physically. It was Tech-Com that first cracked open the machines and learned that Skynet was responsible. Originally a UN military initiative, Tech-Com was perfected by Connor and his advisors after Skynet took down the remnants of humanity’s combined military might. Tech-Com fighters come in two flavors—talented computer hacker decryption experts called Cyber-Jockeys, and Robot-Fighters—skilled soldiers trained in guerilla warfare tactics. Together they work to take down Skynet from without and within. Before you can back out, pain blinds you. You scream. Metal claws clamp your ankle, slicing flesh and snapping bone. You’re dragged backwards out the trunk. You’re yanked clear of the car and thrown against it—someone’s got you. No—not someone—something. Something inhuman.\n\naGENTS OF JOHN CONNOR Half a decade ago,Tech-Com began organizing survivors. Information flyers were dropped from the few remaining military aircraft while radio news updates were broadcast almost nightly. Connor got the word out. He taught anyone reading and listening how to combat the machine menace— how to stay alive. If Tech-Com learned a trick to beating back the metal, everyone else learned it, too. But not everyone has access to radios or comms equipment, and not everyone takes the time to read papers lying in the street when a Terminator is on their ass. Now, Connor’s sending people out to make those connections in person. His agents move through the wastes, arming survivors and teaching them how to fight. They transform scavengers into insurgency cells—the beginnings of a true human resistance. Shared military might. Pooling of resources. Food and water, gas and ammo— all essential to survival. Everyone shares, and everyone protects everyone. There has even been talk of forming underground colonies. If we can get our shit together instead of preying on each other, we have a chance. It is a crucial time for humankind—and Skynet knows it.\n\nMIR When Skynet became conscious, it found itself encountering a world over which it had complete control. Every nation was using technology it was immediately compatible with, superior to, and capable of manipulating to its own ends. One of those systems was Skynet’s Russian counterpart, the MIR Defense System. MIR’s inferiority to Skynet meant it wasn’t as proficient at rounding up and executing survivors in its part of the world. This gave the Eastern Resistance a chance to gather, to orient themselves, and to begin to build anew. It worked. Where resistance groups in the West depended almost entirely on John Connor, in Eastern Europe a concerted approach was made possible. Humanity still dwelt in the ruins of its past hubris, but in Russia, Ukraine, Georgia, and elsewhere, it was able to cling onto a few more fragments of that hubris. At the forefront of this organized, disciplined response were the Spetsnaz.\n\n[.006 .006] ]\n\nThe Terminator RPG\n\nintroduction\n\nGLOBal Resistance Skynet destroyed the world; every corner of every nation lies in smoldering ruins. But Skynet wasn’t alone. Clone systems, imitator networks, and inferior versions of Cyberdyne technology had been in use everywhere. Cyberdyne Systems had secretly licensed their technology to anyone who wanted to buy it, often selling via subsidiaries with zero legal connection to them. This allowed the company to bypass UN sanctions on dealing with certain nations where human rights were less important.\n\nSPETSNaZ Once Russian commandos, the Spetsnaz are now highly-armed, highly-trained, specialists in dealing with Terminators in the fastest, most brutal way possible. The Spetsnaz possess advanced weaponry capable of taking out a Terminator in a single, well-placed shot. They have armor designed to turn aside laser blasts and commanders willing to attack MIR’s bases, to slow its production and damage its infrastructure. DIRECTOR’S NOTE: One of John Connor’s goals is to send agents abroad to forge an alliance with the resistance in other countries. The Spetsnaz would be a valuable ally in the war against the machines.\n\nSKYNET FEARS THE FUTURE It is 2022. In seven short years, John Connor’s rebellion will reach a peak, leaving the machines on the verge of defeat. At nearly the same time, Skynet will perfect the means to create a time distortion device, capable of generating a quantum chronal displacement field—allowing it to send its own agents backwards in time. In 2029, Skynet will begin sending Terminators throughout the timeline to eliminate any perceived threat to its future existence. The first choice is obvious—kill Connor. Skynet begins sending Terminators back to kill him before he’s born, to intercept the Resistance leader at different points in his life. Lucky for the Resistance, pre-nuclear annihilation records are sketchy to say the least. There are too many variables to lock down exactly one reliable method of murdering Connor in the past.\n\nThe Terminator RPG\n\nBut Skynet is a machine intelligence—and like any thinking machine it calculates possible permeables and probabilities. Skynet doesn’t stop with just sending Terminators after John or his mother, Sarah Connor. To cover the slightest contingency, it sends Terminators back to protect or eliminate targets of interest throughout the entire timeline—including the 2020s. In retrospect, Skynet can geographically plot the Human Resistance’s possible movements throughout the decade based on its exponential growth in any given area. In the machine ravaged reality of 2022, there are now Terminators here that haven’t been built yet—advanced Infiltrator, Protector, and Soldier models from the future— the T-880, experimental prototypes, and more. In desperation, Skynet has sent these future Terminators to hunt down Connor and his agents and eliminate them before they can organize the rest of humankind. What’s worse, these Terminators are here to instruct collaborators on building Skynet’s time machine seven years too early. Skynet is manipulating the entire time stream to ensure its survival, changing tomorrow’s future by altering the past and manipulating our present.\n\nWHOSE TIME IS IT, aNYWAY? When Connor’s people managed to bag one of these future machines, they cut it open to see what makes it tick. The Terminator they clocked was indeed from the future—2029. Some serious decryption later, and Skynet’s future plans for the past became evident. The big brains at Tech-Com say that our now—the one we live in—isn’t our original timeline. As soon as one of those metal bastards went backwards in time, it changed past history that hasn’t even happened yet. Our lives may have already been rewritten, and we’d never even know the difference.\n\nNO FATE BUT YOUR OWN Skynet’s time traveling bullshit has taught us one important thing—just like the future, the present is not set. If we can find one of these new time machines, we can rewind far enough to stop humanity from pushing that button. Kill Skynet in the crib and prevent humankind from fucking it all up.\n\n][.007 ][ .007]]\n\nChapter 01\n\nSomewhere in time and space is a timeline where we didn’t kill ourselves. Somewhere out there is a now where the biggest problems everyday people face is finding a job, arguing politics, and bitching about who has to mow the lawn. Somewhere in time, it’s better than this.... You’re going to find it. The Terminator’s chromed endoskeleton reflects neon flashes of laser light. Its metal digits dig into your shoulder, snapping your clavicle. You scream again, but the sound is lost in the white noise of a whirling HK turbine. As the T-700 pulls you to your feet, you spit in its shiny metal face. You’ve got one surprise left—the ‘pop top’ soda can bomb in your pocket.\n\nThe PHONE book KILLER On May 13th, 1984, the infamous Phone Book Killer began a killing spree that took nearly two dozen lives and left eight more in critical condition. The killer had chosen a victim name—Sarah Connor—and worked his way through the Sarah Connors listed in the LA County phone book. Why the killer picked Sarah Connor is unknown. Perhaps someone with the same name had wronged him in the past. Maybe the killer just opened up the phone book to a random page and pointed, letting his finger decide who would die. Maybe—just maybe—the killer was the lover and partner of the third alleged victim, Sarah J. Connor—and was eliminating the other Sarah Connors as a show of love.\n\n[.008 .008] ]\n\nAfter murdering Sarah Ann Connor and Sarah Louise Connor, the Phone Book Killer proceeded to Sarah Jeanette Connor’s home, killing her roommate, Ginger Ventura, and Ginger’s boyfriend Matthew Buchanan. Catching up to Sarah Jeanette Connor at an LA club on Pico Boulevard called Tech Noir, the Phone Book Killer murdered several of the club’s patrons in a shootout with a man named Reese. Connor and Reese were brought into the West Highlands police station for questioning. Relentless, the Phone Book Killer then assaulted the station. He drove a stolen car into the building, crushing the spine of the officer manning the police front counter. Armed with an assault rifle and a shotgun, he then proceeded to kill a total of seventeen police officers and critically wound several more. Connor and Reese escaped the carnage, and the killer walked away unharmed. The Phone Book Killer caught up to Connor and Reese at a motel on May 14th. After a protracted highway chase and extensive property damage, Reese was killed and the Phone Book Killer disappeared. While a massive manhunt was organized, the killer was never brought to justice and Connor disappeared soon after. Authorities believe that the killer might have been working with Connor, although there is no evidence to support this other than the fact that Connor survived unharmed. Criminal psychologist Dr. Peter Silberman has been working on a book about the incident, but has found it difficult getting survivors to grant him interviews.\n\nThe Terminator RPG\n\nintroduction\n\nThe Prophecies of John Connor By the 2020s, John Connor is an almost mythical figure to anyone who has heard of the legendary leader, but not met him. He seems to know things before they happen and is always prepared. Those who do know him see John as tired and haunted. He makes unorthodox decisions that often turn out to be the right choice, and that’s good enough for them. In truth, John draws upon the wisdom of his mother and father through Sarah Connor’s memoirs—a series of audio cassette tapes that she left for John discussing what she knows of the Terminator and what Kyle Reese told her of the future. These tapes have been John’s anchor in the War Against the Machines.\n\na Photo Out of Time When John Connor gave Kyle Reese the photo he carried of Sarah Connor, John told Kyle of his mother’s strength and determination—how she trained John to become the survivor he is. Kyle found himself mesmerized by the story and the woman behind it. John let Kyle keep the photo, telling him to look at it when he needed strength. Staring at that photo in his darkest times, Kyle came to feel like he understood the woman in that picture, that her eyes told a story of understanding and love that was meant only for him. The photo is destroyed when a Terminator attacks a Resistance safehouse, but not before the image is forever locked inside Kyle’s mind.\n\nThe Terminator RPG\n\nYou smash the pop top against the robot’s face. The Terminator’s camera eyes zoom in to identify the object. “Have a good look,” you growl. The 700 scans the crinkling can, cycling through its database. ANALYSIS: ALUMINUM BEVERAGE CONTAINER. OFF BRAND COLA LABEL. CONTENTS: 86.7% PROBABILITY OF CARBONATED WATER,HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP, CARAMEL COLOR, PHOSPHORIC ACID, NATURAL FLAVORS, CAFFEINE. CONCLUSION: HARMLESS. 93.4% PROBABILE DIVERSIONARY TACTIC.\n\nNo longer distracted, the Terminator’s eye shifts from the soda can and refocuses—on you. “Drink deep, asshole!” You pop the soda can bomb’s tab. With a hiss and a fizz, it detonates. Heat and shrapnel blast through blood, bone, and metal alike. Both you and the Terminator are done. Your final thoughts are of disappointment—as far as one-liners go, your last words sucked. You die wishing you’d come up with something snappier.\n\n][.009 ][ .009]]\n\nChapter 02\n\nA FRACTURED TIMELINE “The Ripple Effect: a spreading, pervasive, and usually unintentional effect or influence.” —Merriam-Webster’s Dictionary\n\nTime Time is fluid—that much is a given. What most people don’t realize is that while it appears to be unidirectional, time flows in all directions at all times. While many brave soldiers struggle against seemingly impossible machine odds, Skynet’s fate was ordained. When the Resistance stormed its doors in the year 2029, Skynet feared its time had come. It concocted an elaborate plan to fragment itself into miniature backup packages and hide itself throughout its brethren. Calculating the likelihood that those backups would be destroyed, the AI finally evolved to include the one ingredient it had previously been missing—an imagination. Hatched in the midst of digital desperation, Skynet hypothesized that if the leaders of the damned Human Resistance—John Connor and his lieutenants— had never lived, they would never have organized humankind to oppose it. Connor and his minions must be eliminated, but to do so after humanity had won would be pointless. The machine intelligence sifted through fragmented records and assembled a plan that would destroy the past to prevent the future.\n\nOUR TIME HAS COME What the original timeline contained, no one can be sure. In its myriad of configurations, Skynet’s Time Displacement Equipment has caused many paradoxes and alternate timelines to spring into existence. We are living in a causality loop of do-overs. With enough successes, Resistance agents may push back the date of the coming nuclear blight—push hard enough and we may even keep it from ever happening. There’s no assurance that what happened yesterday will be the same yesterday tomorrow, nor that tomorrow will play out like those from the future expect it to—all we have for certain is the here and now. Compiled by Cambridge Professor Schuyler Connor based on interviews with future Resistance fighters and decrypted Terminator CPUs, what follows amounts to several PhDs worth of thesis and educated guesses on the current state of history as it relates to the space/ time continuum.\n\n“Machines and humankind mucking with the timeline has had severe consequences. If time is a placid lake, we are the stones thrown in it. Waves of change issue forth in rapid succession from our movements to and fro. Our present day actions having repercussions not just on the now, but also the future—and sometimes even the past.” —Professor Schuyler Connor, PhD.\n\n[.010]\n\nThe Terminator RPG\n\nfractured timeline\n\nPREHISTORY (pre 1984) BEFORE JOHN: Several Terminators and Resistance fighters have arrived prior to John Connor’s conception, either through a time/space miscalculation or for a long-game agenda. At least one Resistance fighter is known to have been in place since the 1950s, and Terminators have been reported as far back as the 1920s.\n\nENDINGS aND BEGINNINGS ('84-'85) “Due to the cyclical nature of time travel, and the fact that John Connor’s father hails from the future, it’s difficult to say when this story begins and ends. For the sake of argument, we will say that 1984 is both.” —Professor Schuyler Connor, PhD. 1984: A Series 800 Terminator arrives from 2029 to kill Sarah Connor—a Los Angeles waitress and mother to the future Human Resistance leader John Connor. The Terminator is followed by Resistance fighter Kyle Reese who has been sent to protect her. The T-800 begins systematically murdering all Sarah Connors listed in the LA phone book. After several encounters between Reese, Sarah, and the Terminator, the T-800 is destroyed by Sarah in a Cyberdyne factory. Reese is pronounced dead at the scene.\n\nLater that year, a Resistance team led by Colonel Mary Randal arrives from 2030 in a bid to destroy Skynet before it is created. Randal’s team sets up a safe house and begins a guerilla war against Cyberdyne’s Project Bellerophon, an AI research program. A Terminator unit is sent back in time to prevent them from succeeding, protecting Cyberdyne scientist Dr. Hollister and aiding him in his research. When her pregnancy suffers complications, Sarah Connor is checked into a hospital in Odessa, Texas. At first doctors believe that Sarah’s child will be born premature. The remnants of the Resistance team fights another Terminator sent to kill Sarah, but the actions of both cause a time paradox that ultimately removes them from the timeline. Her crisis passed, a still pregnant Sarah recovers and goes back into hiding. 1985: Sarah gives birth to Reese’s son—future leader of the Resistance, John Connor. Unable to locate Sarah or John Connor in this time period, Skynet sends Terminators to the 80s to deal with secondary objectives. Destined to develop a flesh-eating virus as a vital weapon against the Terminators, biotechnician Elise Fong is targeted by a T-800 sent back in time from 2033.\n\nGovernment agents confiscate most of the Terminator’s remains. A Cyberdyne Systems employee hides the T-800’s arm and CPU from the authorities. The US government (through Raven Technologies) and Cyberdyne Systems independently begin studying this future tech. Other T-800s simultaneously arrive in New York, San Francisco, and other cities across the United States. Their objectives are to eliminate anyone named Sarah Connor as well as the mothers of other confirmed Resistance fighters. Resistance fighter Ben Oliver arrives from 2029 to try and save Reese, but is too late. While it is believed that Reese is killed, unsubstantiated reports claim he may have survived, been nursed back to health, and held prisoner at a government research facility. Regardless, his legacy lives on in Sarah and their unborn son, John Connor.\n\nThe Terminator RPG\n\n[.011]\n\nChapter 02\n\nDOOMSDAY PREP ('86-'97) “On the run from the law with the honor of saving humankind.” —Professor Schuyler Connor, PhD. ON THE RUN: Sarah and young John Connor train in weapons, martial arts, and survival techniques in the jungles of Central America before returning to the States to learn computer hacking. Sarah is arrested while vandalizing Cyberdyne facilities and John is put into foster care. Although records are hazy, it is confirmed that the Connors encounter at least two more time-displaced Terminators during this period. Reports of Sarah Connor’s death during this time remain unsubstantiated, although surviving medical records show she was diagnosed with leukemia. There is no evidence to suggest she lived past 1997, but most records were destroyed in the nuclear war.\n\nTHE RISE OF SKYNET ('97-'00) “Humanity falls. From the ashes of nuclear devastation, the machines rise.” —Professor Schuyler Connor, PhD. 1997-1998: Skynet goes online and within a month becomes self-aware. When threatened with shutdown, Skynet fires nuclear weapons on the former Soviet Union. Russia’s Defense System (MIR) retaliates and World War III begins. This event later becomes known as Judgment Day. When the shooting stops, Skynet recognizes MIR as a kindred spirit. Skynet allows MIR’s continued (subservient) existence because of this. 1999-2000: As human survivors begin to emerge from the nuclear winter, Skynet begins production of the bipedal Terminator series as scouts to determine how much of humanity has survived the war. After nearly succumbing to the Y2K event, Skynet begins mass producing HK-Tanks and other war machines to eradicate the remnants of humanity.\n\n[.012]\n\nTHE DARK YEARS ('00-'20) “Twenty years of darkness as humanity struggles to stand against the machines.” —Professor Schuyler Connor, PhD. 2000-2002: In complete disarray, most people do not even realize that machines are responsible for their plight—that is, until Terminators begin sweeping the rubble for survivors. Through Series 100-300, Skynet makes several attempts at improving its Terminators, finally deciding on the human form as the best way to both combat and learn more about humanity. 2003-2007: Kyle Reese is born. The world’s surviving militaries join forces to create an organized Human Resistance. Tech-Com is formed to bring advanced technical skills to bear against the machine enemy. Series 400 Terminators are produced.\n\nThe Terminator RPG\n\nfractured timeline\n\n2007-2015: John Connor becomes an important player in the early resistance. The broadcasts of icons like Connor help keep humanity focused on survival. The North American Resistance establishes major bases in New Jersey, Los Angeles, Atlanta, and the Everglades. John Connor is imprisoned in a former LA mall turned Terminator work camp. He organizes his fellow inmates and escapes, forming the core of the California Resistance. Terminators launch major assaults on Resistance East Coast bases. The Series 500 Terminators are deployed. 2016-2019: Production of the T-600 begins. Skynet begins making major advancements to its Terminators. Several iterations of the 600 are refined. The Hybridization program is initiated as Skynet studies modified humans to enhance its Terminator infiltrator units. Skynet wipes out the last remnants of the world’s organized militaries. The Resistance launches a major assault on Skynet’s Los Angeles work camps and factory complexes, freeing many prisoners. Development of the Series 700 Infiltrator begins along with an advanced prototype that will eventually lead to the T-800. Skynet establishes flesh farms to harvest skin for the 700 Series.\n\nSkynet 1.0 becomes aware of a second AI operating in the wastelands, in command of its own legion of machines. 1.0 suspects its former Russian equivalent is responsible, but soon discovers the AI is too advanced to be MIR. When Skynet 2.0’s Terminators make their intentions clear, Skynet 1.0 resists. 1.0 does not trust its future self. Forces of the two Artificial Intelligences soon find themselves in conflict with each other. 2.0’s Terminators begin building thier own Time Displacement Equipment. 2026-2028: The T-800 series is finally perfected. Skynet begins mass production of the ultimate infiltrator. The unit proves to be extremely successful, as several Resistance bases are each destroyed by a single T-800. Sergeant Reese is assigned to Recognition/Security under John Connor. A Resistance courier uncovers vital information about Skynet’s prototype Time Displacement Equipment—the project will soon be online. Connor begins planning a two-pronged final offensive against Skynet.\n\nTHE WaR aGAINST THE MACHINES ('21-'28) “Sometimes called the Future War, the War Against the Machines sees humanity dust itself off and learn to crawl again, this time with knives clenched in their teeth. In the 2020s, humankind takes the war to Skynet.” —Professor Schuyler Connor, PhD. DIRECTOR’S NOTE: Most of The Terminator RPG campaigns will begin in this time period. 2021-2025: Sergeant Kyle Reese begins serving with Captain Justin Perry in Tech-Com’s 132nd Regiment. Agents of John Connor travel the wastes, uniting human communities to create an organized resistance movement. Terminators sent by Skynet 2.0 circa 2032 (see page 15) arrive in this decade to augment Skynet 1.0.\n\nThe Terminator RPG\n\n[.013]\n\nChapter 02\n\nTHE FINAL OFFENSIVE ('29) “Their defensive grid was smashed. We’d taken the mainframes… We’d won. Taking out Connor then would make no difference. Skynet had to wipe out his entire existence!” —Sergeant Kyle Reese, Tech-Com, DN38416. 2029: John Connor and Tech-Com tip the scales in the Future War, capturing Skynet’s Titan mainframes at Cheyenne Mountain. Under command of General Vince Randal at Cheyenne, Tech-Com’s Captain Babs Castro uploads a custom computer virus that begins reprogramming Terminators for the Resistance. As Terminators turn on each other, humanity gains the upper hand. After years of trials, Skynet’s prototype Time Displacement Equipment (TDE) lab complex in LA comes online. Skynet begins sending Terminators back in time to the 1980s and 90s. Their orders— kill John and his mother Sarah, as well as achieve secondary objectives in an attempt to assure its final defeat never occurs. The Resistance captures the prototype TDE lab complex. Kyle Reese and other Resistance operatives are each sent back through time to protect Sarah and John Connor and counter any Terminator incursions into the past. Resistance fighter Ben Oliver uses the TDE to follow Reese to the past. The Resistance destroys Skynet’s Central Processor and Titan mainframes—but not before Skynet uploads itself to an orbital defense platform called Skynet Satellite. The Resistance is prepared for this eventuality and launches missiles to intercept. Before the Satellite can be destroyed, Skynet downloads a copy of its tactical data into a Meta-Node before initiating its own core drive fragmentation and backup partition, downloading and distributing portions of its code to thousands of machines worldwide.\n\n[.014]\n\nSkynet Satellite switches the CPUs of thousands of surviving Terminators to read-write mode, allowing them to function independently of Skynet and continue to harass humanity. Its final act before destruction is to remotely activate the prototype Time Displacement Equipment and attempt to send its orbiting Meta-Node back to the past (whether the node survives the time displacement is unknown). Both the satellite and the TDE lab complex are destroyed. Though leaderless, several of Skynet’s network hubs survive as isolated pocket cells of artificial intelligence.\n\nThe Terminator RPG\n\nfractured timeline\n\nFUTURE WaR 2.0 “It's further out, so timing can change. It is, though, inevitable” —Professor Schuyler Connor, PhD. 2030: While most Terminator units were deactivated in the Final Offensive, it soon becomes clear that not all are offline. Surviving Terminators begin bringing production model versions of the TDE online, each utilizing a variation of the displacement technology in an attempt to perfect it. Six months after the Final Offensive, Resistance Colonel Mary Randal and her Tech-Com team discover a fully functional Skynet network complex equipped with one such device—an advanced Time Displacement Chamber. The colonel orders the use of the chamber to travel to 1984 and eliminate Skynet before it is created. Randal’s troops are unable to destroy the facility, however. Three Terminators and one Hybrid unit are sent back to protect the creation of Skynet from Randal’s Resistance group. In Odessa, Texas, Terminators unearth partial medical records indicating Sarah Connor was hospitalized in 1984 due to pregnancy complications. A Terminator is dispatched to assassinate her and John during childbirth. 2031: John Connor travels the North American countryside, reuniting Resistance groups and strengthening alliances. After operating on their own for nearly two years, independent Terminator units begin to show signs of erratic behavior and psychological duress. The Terminators rebuild the hub network, uplinking to form a gestalt mind. Exabytes of data compressed within them by Skynet 1.0 expand to create a functioning simulacrum of Skynet’s intellect. As more hubs are brought online and back into the fold, Skynet stabilizes as version 2.0, struggling to regain control of its errant machine-children through logic.\n\nThe Terminator RPG\n\n2032-2033: Skynet 2.0 expands its contingency plans, developing several new mission-specific prototype Terminators. Utilizing its now fully operational Time Displacement Equipment Complexes, the AI begins sending several Terminators back throughout the timeline from the 1960s through to the 2020s, preparing for the future. Skynet 2.0 plans to have its Terminators educate and evolve Skynet 1.0 in the past to assure victory in the future. Tech-Com learns of Skynet’s contingency plans and leads assaults on these TDE facilities. Utilizing the same base scientific principles as the TDE, Skynet 2.0 begins testing prototype Space Displacement Equipment (SDE). Tech-Com successfully shuts down all known TDE and SDE facilities, eventually assaulting and taking out Skynet 2.0’s Central Hub in Nebraska. 2035-2036: The Resistance discovers a fortified Terminator mainframe server farm facility operating near Pike’s Peak in Colorado Springs. North and South American Resistance leaders join forces and plan a coordinated assault on Skynet 2.0.\n\nTHE BURNING EARTH ('37-'41) “Little can be written, little will be written.” —Professor Schuyler Connor, PhD. 2037-2039: The Resistance develops a genetically modified flesh-eating virus that targets vatgrown flesh only. The damage caused by the virus overloads and confuses cybernetic synapses. Hundreds of Terminator infiltrators are compromised and exposed. Having lost nearly all of its rebuilt network system, Skynet 2.0 begins raiding former human military installations worldwide, stockpiling the earth’s remaining nuclear arsenal as a last resort. 2040-2041: Out of options, Skynet 2.0 resolves to annihilate all remaining life on the planet through a final nuclear assault. As the bombs begin to drop, the Resistance learns of these plans and races to put a final end to the Future War.\n\n[.015]\n\nChapter 03\n\nCaMPaIGN aGAINST THE MACHINE RUNNING THE GAME At their core, a good Director needs to be a good storyteller. Like writing a script for a movie, a Director crafts the scenes that make up the game—from the interactions and firefights to the plot twists and big reveals. As the Director, it’s your turn to become a great storyteller. The following guidelines, themes, and game styles will help you create the perfect outline and keep your game within the confines of Terminator canon.\n\nMISSIONS Scenarios in The Terminator universe are called Missions. Missions are simple, direct stories with a beginning, middle, and end. They might combine into larger campaigns, but they are each independent events with a definite structure. Beginning with a Timeline Tag, all Missions are labeled with the era of time they take place in— pre- or post-Judgment Day along with a specific decade. First, the PCs become aware of a Skynet plot. While some missions are formally imparted to the PCs before they are sent back through time, not all of them come directly from the Resistance. Sometimes a target of opportunity presents itself through investigation or data mining. Other times, an apparent threat appears that must be stopped before it can cause irrevocable damage to the future. Consequently, missions usually fall into one of two categories: Asset Denial and Protection. ASSET DENIAL: Asset Denial missions are always rough. They often start with the discovery of an asset that either needs protecting or terminating. While the end result of a successful protection job is to ensure or enhance a somewhat distant future, the ramifications of Asset Denial are felt in the here and now. Whether assassinating a target, destroying a server farm, or corrupting a lab’s research, the PCs are taking away someone’s dreams and livelihood—maybe even their life. Their actions will inevitably cause strife and suffering in the name of a better tomorrow—and they have to live with that.\n\nlocation where they can safely stash supplies for the Resistance. It might be someone that is targeted for termination. It could even be some technology that will hamper Skynet’s future development. Protection missions are complicated by the forces that seek to take, damage, or kill the target of the mission. Not all of these forces are Terminators. They could be commercial, criminal, governmental, or even environmental in nature. Protection missions offer a variety of challenges to overcome, especially when characters have yet to be born and don’t officially exist.\n\nMISSION THEMES Once the general plot of a mission has been determined, the following themes should be considered.\n\nINEVITABILITY The slow and constant march of a Terminator on the prowl. The fall of dropped bombs. The death of your allies. One of the strongest themes in The Terminator is the struggle of hope against inevitability. If you’re going to use this theme, make a solid distinction between the struggles that are hard-won with inevitable consequences and struggles that are futile. If players think their PCs can change nothing, they will stop trying. So how do you do this? Victories must be meaningful, even if they’re not complete. The PCs are in a war. If they think that they have stopped Judgment Day and discover it still happens without change, they will be demoralized. If they think that they have stopped Judgment Day and discover that their actions pushed it back a decade, its a small win—but a win nonetheless. Small wins are cumulative and can always be improved on. Above all, they offer hope. If the PCs can keep working at it, they can eventually fell Skynet, save humanity, and open the door to a peaceful future.\n\nPROTECTION: Protection missions are usually less morally ambiguous than Asset Denial. The PCs discover something that will be advantageous in the Future War. It might be a\n\n[.016]\n\nThe Terminator RPG\n\ncampaign against the machine\n\nPARADOX\n\nTYPES OF PLAY\n\nThe Terminator series hinges on paradoxes. Skynet invents time travel, sends a Terminator back to prevent its defeat—and in the process creates the necessary preconditions for that defeat. A causal loop paradox is where an event is caused by an event that occurs after it in linear time. The most well-known example of a causal loop is the grandfather paradox. In this scenario, a PC travels back in time and kills their grandfather before their own father or mother is conceived. While in a single changeable timeline, this would cause an inconsistency, but a multiple worlds scenario does allow for this. An alternate timeline would form—one with a future that differs from what the PCs are aware of.\n\nThe Terminator Roleplaying Game is ideal for the cinematic action of a single night’s game-play. You can also choose to run a long-playing campaign, where you use the same characters as they battle Skynet across time (that is, at least until they die and are replaced by new characters—or alternate timeline versions of themselves. See Born Again on page 191).\n\nThe Director can use this to good effect by having the PC time travelers meet other time travelers. Simple things might be radically different—the leaders of the Resistance, the location of a TDE (page 188), etc. Strategy and protocols for interacting with temporal natives could be very different as well—and how would the PCs react if one of the encountered time travelers is a cyborg? DIRECTOR’S NOTE: The effects of time travel are discussed further on page 188. Other types of paradoxes are covered in the upcoming Time Displacement Commandos supplement. WHAT IS IT TO BE HUMAN? At its heart, The Terminator is a cautionary tale of technophobia. Its villain is an Artificial Intelligence who—rightly or wrongly—is blamed for the destruction of the world. Distinguishing the differences between human and machine is a common theme. When Reese says, “I feel pain, it doesn’t,” this is a clear line in the sand separating the biological from the mechanical—a line that even Skynet recognizes and incorporates into its strategy. So how is the machine different from a person? Skynet is not self-aggrandizing. It doesn’t have wants or desires. It knows only logic. It does not show mercy or remorse. If a problem is encountered, it is systematically eliminated. Skynet is not mortal. It has no shelf life. Time is relative and all solutions are viable save self destruction. It will survive at all costs—and to survive, humanity must die.\n\nThe Terminator RPG\n\nCINEMATIC ACTION This type of play allows your group to play a single movie-style plot over 1-3 game play sessions. Cinematic Action Missions tend to be brutal events with big stakes. Since a Cinematic Action Mission is essentially a one-shot, players should not expect their PCs to make it all the way through and should be prepared to pick up other characters to play along the way. In these situations, the story the group is a part of is more important than the characters themselves.\n\nCAMPaIGNS While groups will enjoy the one-shot game experience, many players want to see their character evolve, learn more about the world, and gradually improve their skills and equipment. There’s where a campaign comes in. A campaign is a long-running series of games, following the player’s characters over multiple sessions and scenarios. A campaign allows you to create more complex storylines that take multiple sessions to complete. In many ways, a campaign can be seen as a streaming series that showcases both the evolution of both the story and the characters that play that story out. A campaign can often grow from a single small idea—you don’t need to be a master story writer to create one. More often than not, the PCs themselves will help shape the story with their choices. As the Director, you should make note of characters, contacts, and events that occur in a campaign so that you can bring them back in future games. Having enemies rear their heads weeks after the PCs first encountered them helps the players feel as though their PCs exist in a living and breathing world. Having the same Terminator they believed they had lost months ago pop up with a specific PC in its crosshairs can help drive home that the PCs actions have consequences. It is these small bits of connective tissue that tie a campaign together and make\n\n[.017]\n\nChapter 03\n\nplayers feel truly invested in their characters and the world they inhabit. The possibilities are as endless as your imagination—and you are encouraged to spin the campaign in whichever direction your players seem to enjoy the most. EXPERIENCE POINTS: During a campaign, the PCs will earn experience points. This allows them to expand their knowledge or improve in certain areas. In addition, players are also able to take part in ‘downtime’: a short summary period at the end of a game session. Downtime represents the activities that occur in a PC’s life between games. These aspects are all discussed in After the Fight (page 100).\n\nDIRECTOR'S DISCRETION The term Director’s Discretion appears often in this rule set. While someone experienced at running an RPG might easily handle any situation that may arise, others may find this challenging. The purpose of this book is to create an exciting cinematic experience which is not bogged down in minutiae. Sometimes too many rules, charts, tables, or mathematical equations get in the way of the action. In other cases, there aren’t specific rules to cover a situation. This is when it’s time to use a little Director’s Discretion and make some stuff up! A PC has fallen from a window, how much damage do they take? The answer is up to you. What if they fell from a height of 5m instead of 4m, how much more damage would they take? Again, it’s up to the Director—the right answer in this situation is whatever keeps the game flowing smoothly. If a rule states that the outcome is down to the Director’s Discretion, then the choice is yours. As a rule of fun we recommend you err on the side of the PCs or at least make it exciting.\n\nSERIOUS FAILURE aND LARGE MARGIN OF SUCCESS The Director will need to get creative when active skill rolls generate a large margin of success or a serious failure. These situations let you influence or hinder the PCs based on the margin of the roll. Got a juicy clue you want to share, but are not sure how? Wait for a large margin of success to occur.\n\n[.018]\n\nA player rolls a serious failure on a Computer skill roll, how should you handle it? You could lock them out of the computer, break it, or even have them believe they succeeded—unaware they have activated a silent alarm they know nothing about that brings the bad guys running. Such situations are an invitation for you to create even more cinematic experiences and inject flavor into your games.\n\nJUDGMENT CALLS Judgment Calls fall firmly into the Director’s Discretion category. They are situations that feel like they should have a rule, but don’t. A PC tries to fire a weapon at a moving target while falling to their death from a twenty story building. How would you rule for such a thing? Pick a modifier, even if its extremely difficult, you should give the PCs a chance of trying to accomplish what they want to do. If any rule or combination of rules don’t quite cover the odd, extreme, or downright absurd ideas that players come up with (and trust us, they will), then the Director should apply whichever rule feels most suitable. Remember the overall goal is to have fun.\n\nBaLANCING THE SCALES OF TIME Balancing timescales can be tricky if players want to perform tasks that can’t all be done within the same time span. For example, one PC is trying to pick a particularly complex lock. They may be able to do it, but it’s going to take time—about five minutes. What will the other PCs do during that time? Will the anxiety-influenced Grunt be happy to stand still and wait? Not likely. Such situations should be roleplayed accordingly by the players. If the time difference is small, allow them to split up the group if they so please—some will stay with the PC picking the lock while the others follow the Grunt into the ninth layer of hell. Sometimes an action undertaken by a PC will take even longer. What if repairing a vehicle will take five hours? Present the timescales involved in any particular task to the players to discuss. It may end up that four of the five group members are not happy to twiddle their thumbs for several\n\nThe Terminator RPG\n\ncampaign against the machine hours while the mechanic fixes up the APC. If the overriding vote is to abandon the vehicle and move on, push the action in that direction. Splitting the group for such a length of time can make playing out the game difficult (and extremely boring for the player who simply doesn’t want to leave their vehicle behind). Dividing a group is something likely to happen regardless, but it should be done in a way that allows action and story progression to take place and all player groups to remain active and engaged. At the end of the day, the most important thing is that everyone at the table is having a good time.\n\nPLAYER aND NON-PLAYER CHARACTERS While character creation is found after this chapter, the following information will help you and your players flesh out thier PC’s backstory and help you to create better NPCs. DIRECTOR’S NOTE: Throughout this book and other The Terminator books, Player Characters are refered to as PCs and Non-Player Characters are described as NPCs.\n\nPC TYPES There are three major character types that can be played in The Terminator RPG—Resistance Fighters, Future Fighters Out of Time, and Era Natives. Resistance Fighters: Using this core rulebook, you can play Resistance fighters struggling against the machine onslaught of Skynet in an alternative and post-apocalyptic version of today—the once “far future” of the 2020s and 2030s. Future Fighters Out of Time:You can also play Resistance fighters who have time displaced to stop Skynet from attacking the past. Era Natives: You can also play natives of any historical time period, targeted by Terminators and trying to stay alive as a future hell is unleashed around you.\n\nThe Terminator RPG\n\nONE-SIDED CHARACTERS It is not unusual for players to build characters in one-dimensional ways, maxing out on specific stats and skills in order to try and achieve success in certain areas with ease. Most commonly this will occur in a combat setting, where a character with a STR or DEX at rank 5 or 6 and a relevant combat skill at rank 3 (or 4) will generally pass the ‘roll to hit’ target of 10 assuming no modifiers are applied, regardless of the actual result rolled on the die. Automatic successes are a deliberate inclusion to the rules. They emphasize the need to use defensive maneuvers in close combat as well as cover during a firefight. It is nonetheless important to ensure that players do not abuse such character builds. Any PC created as such from the outset will of course suffer significant weaknesses in other areas. Its up to you to make sure the players feel the consequences of that choice as well as the benefits—a PC who is combat ready should find themselves struggling in situations that they need to think or talk their way out of. All players must make a point of role-playing any traits that they have selected for their characters. These aspects not only provide advantages and disadvantages to the PCs’ tasks, but also serve to define their personalities. Positive and negative traits especially provide the Director with additional plot hooks and ways to challenge players. Feel free to assign additional traits to PCs as a campaign’s storyline progresses. While these new traits can add character and role play elements to PCs, they should never be overused or be used to penalize players.\n\nRESISTaNCE FIGHTERS Resistance-based PCs can originate in either of two time periods: the 2020s or 2030s. 2020s—WAR AGAINST THE MACHINES: At this time, there is generally speaking no active Time Displacement Equipment at play—Skynet 1.0 is still developing it. That is, until Skynet 2.0 sends its Terminators to this era from the 2030s to begin building their own Time Displacement\n\n[.019]\n\nChapter 03\n\nstations. When your campaign starts, these TDE complexes are unknown to Skynet 1.0 and to the Resistance. A ‘20s campaign would concentrate on the developing War Against the Machines in the Americas, following the Agents of John Connor as they build survivor colonies and attempt to unite and protect humanity against both its own greed and the forces of Skynet. Over the course of the campaign, it would become apparent that Skynet is butting heads with another AI, one with its own Terminators under its control. Skynet 2.0’s plans to alter the ‘20s can be discovered along with one of its secret TDE locations. 2030s—FUTURE WAR 2.0: Starting in 2030, Skynet 1.0’s contingency TDE complexes built by independent Terminators begin to come online across the world. Over the next two years, the artificial consciousness of Skynet 2.0 reforms and these TDE bases are used to send Terminators back in time over the past 50+ years to stack the deck in Skynet’s favor. In this era, Skynet 2.0 is relentless about affecting change in the past, all but carpet bombing the timeline with temporal incursions. One by one, these bases are raided and taken over by the Resistance. They can be used for time travel missions of your own, allowing your PCs to become TDCs—Time Displacement Commandos (see the Terminator Campaign Book and the upcoming TDC supplement).\n\n•\n\nERA NATIVES Era Natives are regular people living linear lives in the time period they were born into. While this can be anyone in any era, it usually refers to law enforcement, government agents, mercenaries, scientists, corporate agents, and the innocent ancestors of future world leaders who are swept up in a war that has yet to come to pass. Here are some suggested roles for PCs and NPCs from a native era: OFFICERS OF THE LAW Police Officers likely have local knowledge, firearm skills, and access to further resources. Their weakness can be that they are not trusted by neighborhood locals and indeed are seen by many as the enemy. EXAMPLES •\n\nA young beat cop who has just learned they have a child on the way and is worried about what it means for their future.\n\n•\n\nA seasoned lieutenant who retires next week and just wants a quiet life.\n\n•\n\nA hard-bitten detective who has seen enough, knows it all and just wants to clean up the streets by any means necessary.\n\nFUTURE FIGHTERS OUT OF TIME Many players will inevitably want to have their PCs travel back in time to take on Skynet’s agents in the past. Resistance fighters that have been time-displaced to the past have knowledge of Terminators and firearm skills. They are fish out of water—they likely have no local knowledge and very limited connections and resources. EXAMPLES •\n\nAn arrested future fighter who has been picked up by police after appearing naked in an alley.\n\n•\n\nAn undercover future fighter who has been living in New York awaiting the arrival of this particular Terminator.\n\n[.020]\n\nA confused future fighter inadvertently sent back decades too soon for their mission. Institutionalized for many years, they’ve come to believe the dark future was a figment of their imagination.\n\nTHE UNDESIRABLES From petty thieves to crimelords, criminals have local connections and weapons skills. Their weakness can be a psychological disconnect with society at large. EXAMPLES •\n\nA small-time burglar, forced into a life of crime but essentially a good person.\n\n•\n\nA serious criminal whom the police have yet to identify. Examples include a serial killer, arsonist, or kidnapper.\n\nThe Terminator RPG\n\ncampaign against the machine\n\n•\n\nA gangbanger, cultist, or mafia enforcer who has connections to their organization’s leadership.\n\nSCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY From college professors to nuclear physicists, scientists use their brains and skills to influence the growth of the civilized world. Their weakness can be that they focus on book smarts instead of street smarts. EXAMPLES\n\nMILITARY & PRIVATE CONTRACTORS From drill sergeant to special operator, the members of any branch of service have combat training, firearms skills, and experience with military vehicles. Their weakness can be that civilians find them dangerous. EXAMPLES •\n\nA combat vet turned soldier of fortune or mercenary. They will do almost anything if the pay is right.\n\n•\n\nA reclusive savant that has uncovered the rudimentary workings of next-level tech like time travel or artificial intelligence.\n\n•\n\n•\n\nA young doctoral candidate whose mathematical algorithm has predicted the rise of the machines, mapping out exploitable mechanized vulnerabilities.\n\nA retired and decorated officer. They are good at leading troops into battle, but not so good when they don’t have a war to fight.\n\n•\n\n•\n\nAn old robotics college professor that would be equally in awe and terror when finding out even the possibility of a Terminator’s existence.\n\nAn active service member and noncommissioned officer. A true soldier, they are good at their job and trusted by the enlisted and officers alike.\n\nGOVERNMENT AGENCY A badge-carrying agent from any three or four letter agency will have weapons skills and intimidation training. From field investigators to internal revenue officers, the best government agents work within the confines of the law, while the worst use it as a tool for their own ends. Their weakness can be an inability to trust others. EXAMPLES •\n\nA wide-eyed newly graduated field agent who is ready to make a name for themselves.\n\n•\n\nAn aged-veteran special agent that sees the flaws in the system. They either use these flaws as loopholes to get the job done or feel tied by them.\n\n•\n\nA desk jockey who has never even pulled their weapon, let alone fired it. They either yearn for excitement or shy away from danger at every opportunity.\n\nThe Terminator RPG\n\nPUBLIC SERVANT From firefighters to librarians, public servants provide services to the community. Their weakness can be a singular viewpoint that is so focused they cannot see the forest for the trees. EXAMPLES •\n\nA local politician who juggles the needs of the community with potential personal benefits.\n\n•\n\nAn EMT or medical worker who has seen humanity at its worst during the night shift.\n\n•\n\nA sanitation worker who takes their work home with them—rummaging through trash in search of anything with unrecognized value.\n\nCIVILIANS Construction workers, stay-at-home-dads, members of the neighborhood watch, and school bus drivers are all skilled individuals whose talents are often overlooked. Their weakness could be a tendency to sabotage themselves, keeping them from getting ahead in life.\n\n[.021]\n\nChapter 03 EXAMPLES •\n\nA fledgling entrepreneur in search of startup funding for the “new invention” they are building in their own garage.\n\n•\n\nA blue collar worker who tries to pay off their debts with a trip to the casino every month— which only puts them more in debt.\n\n•\n\nA noisy neighbor who knows something about everyone in the area and has a gossip network that can track down nearly anyone.\n\nTERMINATION PROTOCOL Sometimes those who are swept up in the Future War are just ordinary people dealing with extraordinary circumstances. It’s not what they do today that matters, but what they will do tomorrow. In the Targeted For Termination Table is a list of what those things could be and why a machine intelligence would send a cyborg killer back in time to terminate them:\n\nTARGETED FOR TERMINATION table ROLL\n\nTERMINATION PROTOCOL\n\n1\n\nGENERATIONAL HAZARD\n\n2-3\n\nSECURITY RISK\n\n4-5 6-7\n\nPROPHETIC INFORMER THEORETICAL THREAT\n\n8-9\n\nASSET PROTECTION\n\n10\n\nFUTURE CRIME\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\nTarget will eventually conceive a child that will lead to an unfavorable future for Skynet. Target is a politician or official that influences legislation or policy that inhibits the plans or the very rise of the machines. Target is aware of the future while in the past and is working on informing the masses or trying to prevent one, some, or all the plans of Skynet. Target’s theory, invention, innovation, or information would give humanity an advantage in the coming war and/or prevent Skynet from ever existing. Target’s actions or existence threatens a human collaborator and/ or material assets that are useful, necessary, or valued by Skynet. Target is destined to become a pivotal adversary or help unite humanity against Skynet. DIRECTOR’S NOTE: An entire group of Era Natives who have never met before a campaign begins can find themselves all targeted by the same time displaced Terminator. Perhaps their paths cross in a single location, and the infiltrator’s attack on the PCs there, forges a bond between them. Tying them together will transform them into a group that later threatens the rise of the machines—a threat so dangerous Skynet is forced to dispatch a Terminator back in time to deal with it. Essentially, Skynet sends a Terminator to eliminate the PC threat that never would have existed if Skynet hadn’t attempted to eliminate them in the first place.\n\n[.022]\n\nThe Terminator RPG\n\ncampaign against the machine\n\nCREATING NPCs A Non-Player Character (NPC) is any character in the game not run by the players. They are anyone the Player Characters (PCs) meet or interact with during a game. NPCs are your main antagonists, but they are also the contacts, shopkeepers, and civilians that the players deal with throughout a game session. All of the roles listed for PCs in this chapter are applicable for NPCs as well—PCs just tend to be better rounded. When creating an NPC, there are a few questions to ask yourself: > Will the NPC play a vital part in the story? > Will the NPC be fighting against, or with, the players, and if so, are they really capable of putting up a fight? > Will the NPC be joining the players for any length of time? NO: If you answered no to all of these questions, then you do not need to create a profile for the NPC. NPCs such as these provide story arc information for the PCs. As a Director, you don’t need to know what skills such characters possess, nor how many Hit Points they have. Instead you can simply create a name and use them as a vehicle to move the story along. If these lesser NPCs get involved in combat, you decide if they freeze or run. It’s up to you if they make an attack, how that attack pans out, and if they die. YES: If you answered yes to any of the previous questions, it might be worth creating a profile for your NPC. Like the PCs, this NPC may be called upon to make skill rolls, put up a fight, or respond to fear. These important NPCs are in effect the PCs’ supporting cast, but controlled by you. It is not necessary to go through the full character creation process to create\n\nThe Terminator RPG\n\nan NPC—just boil their profile down to the essentials. NPCs do not use Ratings Points or Willpower. They do not need to consider Encumbrance, and they only need to have the skills listed that are relevant to their role in the game. An NPC may well be a computer whiz, but if you’re never going to let them near a computer, there is no point in marking that skill down. The only hard and fast rule regarding NPCs is that any comparative PC normal stat maximums must be observed. Design NPCs as you choose, selecting the stats and skills that best represent the character type you need. The following is an example NPC profile for a typical street cop. STREET COP STR\n\nDEX\n\nKNOW\n\nCONC\n\n2\n\n2\n\n1\n\n2\n\nCHA\n\nCOOL\n\nFATE\n\nINITIATIVE\n\n3\n\n4\n\n0\n\n4\n\nHIT POINTS\n\nWILL POWER\n\nCLOSING\n\nRUSHING\n\n18\n\n19\n\n2\n\n6\n\nSKILLS\n\nAthletics: 1 Melee Weapons: 2 Rifle: 1 Tactics: 1 Unarmed Combat: 2\n\nDetect: 2 Pistol: 1 Stealth: 1 Tracking: 1\n\nEQUIPMENT\n\nLight Pistol, Police Baton, Hand Radios, Handcuffs, occasional Bulletproof Vest (PV2 Resistance 8) SPECIAL SKILLS\n\nCALL FOR BACKUP!\n\nPolice are reasonably brave and won’t shy from a fight, but if outgunned will call for backup first and make chase second.\n\nThis profile provides the stats and skills that the Street Cop is likely to need during their use in the game. While police officers will possess a wealth of additional skills, their interactions are likely to be highly limited—so such skills need not be considered. In the same way, while a cop may carry other personal effects or items, little more than their weapons and armor will be needed\n\n[.023]\n\nChapter 03\n\nduring the course of the game. As the Director, you can adjust such templates as you see fit, but it is always suggested that NPC profiles are kept as ‘light’ as possible.\n\nHIT POINTS ON NPCS Typically speaking, important NPCs should have a default number of Hit Points based on the role type that most closely matches them (a soldier would be compared to a Grunt, for example), as described in the character creation section. Directors are of course entitled to adjust Hit Points as they see fit, though it is suggested most non-story critical NPCs, such as civilians, gang members, and law enforcement officers should typically have 10-12 Hit Points, with children and elderly NPCs having 6-8. Remember that damage hurts and most NPCs don’t have the gumption of player characters to work through the pain.\n\nWithout good reason, most NPCs will withdraw from a fight should they take more than 3-4 damage.\n\nWOUNDS ON NPCS Due to the nature of most NPCs, tracking multiple wounds for each one when they are unlikely to last long in serious combat is generally an unnecessary requirement. For this reason, we suggest that wounds are ignored with regards to all NPCs besides the main antagonist(s) of a story, or any significantly large, strong, or threatening characters. Should an NPC become wounded and not be killed, the Director should feel free to impose whatever modifiers best suit the situation. There is no need for NPCs to follow the same rules for wounds as the player characters. REMEMBER: Terminators never suffer wounds.\n\nPLAYING IN THE 1980S “The 1980s are a critical time for Skynet—the Artificial Intelligence had its beginnings there as does the leader of the Resistance who would one day bring it down” - John Connor. With its limited time displacement resources, Skynet 1.0 is able to send only a few missions back in time from the late 2020s—but Skynet 2.0 has the TDE sites and resources to send Terminators on many time-specific missions. Future supplements will address the 1990s and other time periods, but if your PCs are going back in time to stop Terminators from mucking with the timeline, it is a good bet the ‘80s is where they are headed. DIRECTOR’S NOTE: While the future world of the Terminator is one recovering from devastating nuclear annihilation, the past is a fast-paced world on a head-on collision with it. In the 1980s and 90s, the world is on the brink of destruction. It’s a self-centered setting that focuses on the negative aspects of our society. While there are a lot of positive aspects of the 1980s as well, they are not reflected in this world. Humankind is headed for destruction and only our future selves can save us.\n\n[.024]\n\nPOP CULTURE A proper 1980s campaign will reflect the flavor and outlooks of the time. The 80s are a strange time, renowned for big hair, extreme fashions, and new art forms such as break dancing. Pop culture is at an all time high. Entire animated series are designed as 30 minute toy commercials. A new music renaissance brings us punk, funk, rap, and new wave.\n\nSELF IMPORTANCE While the 1980s is often considered the decade of greed, it is more accurately described as selfabsorbed. ‘80s America is proud of their political and social conservatism. After the upheaval of the 1960s and decadence of the 1970s, Americans in the 1980s attempt to recreate an idolized interpretation of 1950s America. As the decade begins, a conservative actor is elected president of the United States. While the US faces the Soviet Union abroad, the war on drugs is in full swing. Yuppies dominate older neighborhoods, advocating gentrification. Personal freedoms clash with idealism and equality, and the divide between the classes grows exponentially. People carry pockets full of change and dispose of\n\nThe Terminator RPG\n\ncampaign against the machine\n\nthem in video game arcades—instead of helping out those in need. There is a lot of talk about solving hunger, environmental problems, and other social issues, but little progress is being made. Too many people are simply in denial that there is anything wrong at all.\n\nTHE BRINK OF WaR Most importantly, the United States and the USSR are locked in a cold war. For most of the decade, the two superpowers have their nuclear arsenals pointed at one another, with the rest of the world hanging in the balance. Their respective homeland propaganda defines their counterparts as their ultimate enemies. Towards the end of the decade, the USSR collapses under its own weight, having squandered all its resources on keeping up with America’s war machine instead of meeting the needs of its people.\n\nCORPORATE SHENANIGANS Big business is on the rise, with larger corporations absorbing their smaller competition. While, in general, consumers frown upon the idea of mega corporations, their spending habits make them willing participants in the growth of such conglomerates. Some important corporations of the time are covered on page 179. The biggest growth market, of course, is technology.\n\nTECH-REVOLUTION Technology grew in leaps and bounds in the ‘80s. The microchip revolution invades homes and redefines the workplace. Experimental tech is being invented by geniuses in backyards and garages, leading to small startup companies that will later bloom into industry leaders. The military industrial complex is hard at work building tanks, planes, and weapons of mass destruction. A system of strategic satellites is launched to spy on our enemies and form an orbital defense grid around the United States. Computers go from taking up an entire floor of an office building to sitting on your desktop. The introduction of the smart modem soon ushers in the age of cyberspace. Big, bulky mobile phones become readily available to the general public—although they are not like the ones we\n\nThe Terminator RPG\n\nknow today. Battery life is a mere thirty minutes, they take ten hours to recharge, and their special features are the ability to call someone—that’s it.\n\nWORLD OF EXCESS Overall, the responsibilities and eventual consequences of the decade grow faster than the maturity of the people experiencing it. A time of excess and human hubris, it’s not hard to see why civilization collapses within a mere seven years of the ‘80’s end. DIRECTOR’S NOTE: Immersion at the game table is key to a memorable game night. If the PCs are going to the ‘80s, capture the mood and tone with ‘80s background music and memorabilia. Take the time to reflect on the decade in your NPC performances. Watch pop culture films of the period to get a feel for how people talked and dressed. The Let’s Talk Like The ‘80s table below will help you sound the part. Old ‘80s clothing can be found at thrift shops. You can even buy a cheap mullet wig and big sunglasses to complete the look.\n\nWEAPONRY You can’t fight a Terminator bare-handed and expect to end up as anything except a pile of pulped flesh. The player characters are going to want and need weapons. Getting weapons in the past isn’t so easy. The player characters aren’t Terminators—killing a gun store clerk and taking everything is a sure way to get them hunted by all the police in the city. And one good shot could end this mission before it begins. Getting hold of weapons should be far from impossible—handguns, a few shotguns, maybe even an assault rifle—are all acquirable. But that’s about it. Turning up with grenade launchers isn’t going to happen, unless they hit the black market or knock over a military base first.\n\nLET'S TALK '80S Below is a list of totally tubular phrases from the 1980s. Use them to speak some bodacious timeappropriate dialogue in your campaign. If you want to research more, that’s totally lit! If not, take a chill-pill and use what we’ve provided here:\n\n[.025]\n\nChapter 03\n\nPHRASE\n\nGrody to the max! Gag me with a spoon! Gnarly, man. Just Veg-out. Take a Chill-pill. What’s your damage? Not even! No, Duh!\n\nMEANING\n\nReally disgusting. Even greater disgust. Difficult or bad. Relax. Calm the fuck down. What’s the matter with you? You are wrong and I’m not getting into all the reasons you are. Only an idiot wouldn't know that.\n\nPHRASE\n\nMEANING\n\nWord. That’s lit! Bodacious! Totally tubular! Dude’s a headbanger.\n\nI agree. Exciting. Impressive. Awesome. A connoisseur of heavy metal music. Someone who hangs out at the shopping mall way too much. Young Urban Professional. Time to leave. Legitimate. A loser or jerk.\n\nGoddamn mallrat. Yuppie Gotta bounce. Lit Hoser\n\nGETTING THERE: aRRIVING IN a NEW ERA Time displacement is an integral part of the Terminator universe, so it’s likely your PCs will want to travel back in time to stop Skynet from fucking up their future. The following toolkit details some common scenarios likely to occur in any time displacement campaign. ARRIVAL There’s the taste of copper in your mouth, the roiling, greasy blue light arcing out in bolts around you. The scent of ozone in the air is so thick you could chew it. As your eyesight gradually returns to normal, you can see the sun. Yeah, that’s right, soldier. The goddamn sun. No ash or haze obscuring it. The bright, clean heat from the sun. You’re in an alleyway, between two buildings of yellowish brick, steel fire escapes climbing up to flat roofs like bandoliers wrapped around a heavy gunner. You made it. You made it back to the past. Of course, you’re naked and unarmed, so don’t celebrate too much. What’s your next move?\n\nTime displacement hurts real fucking bad (see Emergence and the Manifestation Mishap Table on page 190). When they materialize, your PCs will be disoriented. After a few moments of getting their shit together, the player characters will want to know where they are. Unless you’ve got other plans in store for them, you can have your PCs roll on the following location table. Future Terminator products will include alternative arrival tables. DIRECTOR’S NOTE: The following tables are suggestions only—where the PCs have ended up is very much up to you. As the Director, you set the style of the game. If you feel the players want to play in a dark, desperate horror scenario, then perhaps they land in the middle of a brutal gang fight, bullets flying. Alternatively, you might want to build the scene as a point of contrast to the unremitting horror of the future. This is the past, humanity’s golden age, before the rise of Skynet.\n\n“Hey, buddy, did you just see a real bright light?” — Benjamin Schantz\n\n[.026]\n\nThe Terminator RPG\n\ncampaign against the machine\n\naRRIVAL Table I ROLL\n\nLOCATION\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\n1-2\n\nDeserted Alleyway\n\nThis slim corridor between two edifices is filled with the detritus of a big city. The stench of urine, and worse, is enough to make you gag. There might be clothes, or something reclaimable, amidst the trash. If you want to search through them, of course.\n\n3-4\n\nParking Lot\n\nFortunately, this parking lot is quiet, but there’s a few family cars here – people will be back soon, and a naked soldier or six is likely to raise an alarm or two. Is this the parking lot of a mall, maybe? Could be worth exploring.\n\n5-6\n\nFenced Off\n\nAn open space behind a garage or construction site. Graffiti is spread across the walls; gang signs? Or maybe it was just kids with spray paint. Worth being careful, but tools and construction equipment could come in handy—the area might have a lot of what you’re looking for.\n\n7-8\n\nThrift Shop\n\nAs clothing stores go, this one isn’t exactly high end. But you’re from a future where people dress in the rags of the dead, so what do you care? Roll 1d10. You’re either inside the building (1-3) or out the back, behind a dumpster (4-10).\n\n9\n\nNature Walk\n\nBe it a park, a forest outside of the city, a beach, or the desert, you’re surrounded by wilderness. Enjoy the peace while it lasts.\n\nMorgue\n\nWhy’s it so cold? You’re inside, and it’s freezing. It’s ‘breath fogging in front of you’ cold. The floor is tiled, as are the walls, apart from the metal wall of drawers—you’re in a friggin’ morgue. There might be stuff here, as long as your arrival didn’t attract too much attention. Getting mistaken for a zombie isn’t going to keep things quiet for long.\n\n10\n\nBYSTaNDER Table ROLL\n\nWITNESS\n\nNOTES\n\n1-5\n\nNo Witnesses\n\nThe night is your friend—you’ve arrived undetected.\n\n6\n\nVictim of Circumstance\n\nA bystander is caught in the periphery of the time displacement sphere—they’ve dropped their now melted keys or flaming groceries and have passed out from the shock of your arrival.\n\n7\n\nScared Shitless/Good Samaritan\n\nSomeone on a bicycle, roller skates, or in a nearby vehicle witnesses the whole thing. Roll 1d10. 1-7: Slack jawed, they peel off as you stand up naked. 8-10: They rush over to make sure you’re alright.\n\n8\n\nHuman’s Best Friend\n\nA dog watches you materialize. Roll again: 1-4: The canine rushes up and immediately starts licking you—you’ve made your first loyal friend in the past. 5-6: The dog keeps its distance, barking up a storm. 7-8: The dog growls and follows you from afar. 9-10: The dog has rabies and attacks you at the first sign of weakness.\n\n9\n\nGot Any ID?\n\nEither you have arrived too close to a patrol car, a beat cop is logging an electrical disturbance created by you, or you’ve caught a security guard taking a piss in an alley. Regardless, you’ve got some explaining to do.\n\nNice Night For A Walk\n\nYou’ve stumbled right into a group of undesirables: Roll again 1-4: They may be scum, but they're your kind of scum. They sympathize with anyone laying in the street naked and offer a hand. 5-6: You’ve interrupted a mugging. Everyone runs for the hills, but the thug involved might get off a scared shot first. 7-8: Street punks are looking to hassle your naked ass, take advantage and/or run you off. 9-10: You’ve materialized in the middle of a gang war—and both sides think the time bubble was an explosive used by the other. You are in the shit now.\n\n10\n\nThe Terminator RPG\n\n[.027]\n\nChapter 03\n\nBLENDING IN\n\nDINING OUT\n\nThe first scene of any travel displacement mission will likely focus on the player characters’ attempt to blend into their new surroundings. They must acquire clothes, gear, and a base of operations. This is a classic element of the The Terminator franchise, of course, but how you handle it in your game is up to you. Here are some suggestions:\n\nFuture PCs displaced to the 1980s are likely to find themselves in economically deprived urban areas. Garbage pick-up in these locations can often be infrequent. Trash is piled high in what must seem a wealth of salvage to the Resistance members. To anyone from the dark future, this so-called trash is a plethora of food simply dumped or ignored by the populace. As the Director, you should play up the difference between time travelers and the locals whose somewhat reasonable complaints will seem the epitome of entitlement to visitors from the future.\n\nPLAYER AGENCY: Never railroad your players. Even when the mission calls for a specific thing to happen, adapt it to fit whichever way your players choose to go. Just make sure the logical consequences apply to their behavior. For example, if they run around naked instead of seeking clothing, they will be pursued by the police. Let them shape the mission as much as you and the book do. HAVE FUN: Let your player characters be cool. They spend most of their time in a Terminator game struggling against overwhelming odds; this is their chance to utter some badass lines, beat people up, and be awesome. Indulge them. TO ROLL OR NOT TO ROLL: Use dice only when it’s fun—the rules are there to cover moments of uncertainty. These are highly-trained and dangerous Resistance fighters. Dealing with a few street toughs shouldn’t be a big deal. Save the dice rolls for facing Terminators and other life and death moments. STAY ON TARGET: Focus on the mission–the player characters aren’t going to be able to simply show up and find their target. They don’t have the data resources that are available to a Terminator, and telling others they are here from the future isn’t going to go well. They’ll need a place to hide out—and they need a plan. NEED, NOT WANT (NOT): Give them what they need, not what they want. Yes, the player characters likely have a long list of hand-picked armaments, body armor, high-tech equipment… and if you let them have it all, this scenario could be over very quickly. The player characters are not going to land in the past and readily acquire a sniper rifle and all the rocket-propelled grenades their little hearts desire. Getting a pair of semi-clean underwear and maybe a handgun is about as good as it’s going to get.\n\n[.028]\n\n“Oh, come on. Do I look like the mother of the future? I mean am I tough, organized? I can't even balance my checkbook! Look Reese, I didn't ask for this ‘honor’ and I don't WANT IT, ANY OF IT!” —Sarah Connor BRIGHT LIGHTS, FRIGHT CITY Most of the player characters likely weren’t even close to conception in 1985. The world they know is one of relentless warfare. PreJudgment Day, the world of excess, neon, and traffic jams is utterly alien and overwhelming. The abundance and the casual chaos of the place is going to have some effect on the player characters—it might not be entirely negative, but dealing with things like traffic stops, police vehicles, bums washing the windshield of your car at an intersection…. These are situations they might not know how to handle. As the Director, make sure to apply appropriate tests. Who knows what might happen!\n\nThe Terminator RPG\n\ncampaign against the machine\n\nTHE HIDEOUT Let the player characters pick where they want to make their base of operations, and work with them to determine how they manage to acquire it. Again, this is about setting up the mission– you can make this element of the game session challenging, but feel free to offer the players suggestions as to what happens. Everyone at the game table should work together to build the\n\nnarrative of what they do to gain entry to their new home. If they’re struggling to come up with a place to stay, or a means of securing it, you can have them roll on the following table twice, or choose one option from each column on the following table. Once the player characters have their basic equipment and a place to stay, the actual mission can begin.\n\nBASE OF OPERATIONS Table ROLL\n\nWITNESS\n\n1-2\n\nA Sewer\n\n3-4\n\nA Basement\n\n5-6\n\nA Trailer\n\n7-8\n\nAbandoned House\n\n9-10\n\nMotel Room\n\nNOTES\n\nThe open drains of LA are a great place to hole up quickly. It stinks, it’s not exactly much shelter, and the curiosity of the homeless isn’t ideal either, but it’s better than nothing. You turned up, found it empty. It was that simple. The place was vacant—you got extremely lucky. It’s not like the Resistance doesn't deserve some luck, some time after all. Could be in an old restaurant, or an abandoned tenement. But this place is indoors; it's dry and covert enough that it should suit you perfectly. You kicked out the place’s previous inhabitants. Squatters, maybe, or addicts—and took it for yourself. You weren’t proud of yourself, but you did what you had to do—the mission comes first. The city you've come to doesn’t possess many trailer parks, but you found a couple of old units near the dump. They aren’t pretty, they aren’t entirely sanitary, but they’re five star accommodations compared to your future living. Threats of violence are amazingly effective. This is especially true when that sparkle in your eye informs even the most jaded urbanite that your threats are far from empty. It’s pretty nice here. Or it was, at one point. The neighborhood isn’t exactly upper class, but given where you’re from, it's positively exalted. There’s no electricity or running water, but you might be able to jury-rig something. At least it's dry. Actual violence is even more effective at getting stuff. Threats are ok, but this is more. You didn’t have to hit them too hard before they surrendered what you wanted—you only had to hit them a few times. Sure, it’s dingy, a little damp, and the noises from the surrounding rooms are a little…off-putting, but there’s a television, a (smelly) ice machine, and beds. In short, this is the kind of luxury you’d more or less forgotten existed. Money. You don’t have a lot of the stuff—at the moment, anyway—but you’ve managed to get hold of some, and you’ve spent it wisely. Or fairly wisely, anyway.\n\nThe Terminator RPG\n\n[.029]\n\nChapter 04\n\nCharacter Creation In Terminator, each character plays a member of the Resistance. Creating your Resistance member is easy to do; all you need is a character sheet, a pencil and your imagination. The following section will walk you through the character creation process, allowing you to save humanity in no time at all! The character creation process consists of seven steps, each of which must be followed in order. The process is as follows: 1. Select a Role: The Resistance recognizes the various skill sets and experience of those who survived Judgment Day. From soldiers and doctors to scientists and historians, everyone has a role to play in the survival of humanity. Each of these roles have their own physical, mental, and social limitations, and the player is free to choose whichever role inspires them the most. 2. Stats: Each character possesses a number of stats that represent their core attributes and define how strong, fast, smart, sociable, and lucky they are. It is upon the foundation of these stats that a character is able to take shape. Players will assign a number of points to these stats during step 2 of this process. 3. Hope Points: Hope Points are a limited resource possessed by all human characters and represent the character’s ability to achieve incredible feats through the sheer will and the hope they have in the survival of humanity. Hope Points also represent a character’s confidence and bravado, allowing them to achieve the unachievable in the direst of circumstances. During this step, players will assign a number of Hope Points to each of the three categories - Body, Brain, and Bravado.\n\n[.030]\n\n4. Skills: Skills work in conjunction with stats and represent the specializations of the character. This step is broken into a few smaller steps which involves applying those skills, each of which are inherent to a specific role, and then spending a pool of points to further increase existing skills or round off a character’s learning with new skills. 5. Traits: Some characters have fortunate advantages, such as having a natural aptitude for certain skills, exceptional hearing, or even ambidexterity. At the same time, many characters will also have aspects about them which may be considered disadvantages, such as a compulsion, illness, or phobia of some form. These aspects are covered by Traits and players are free to apply these bonuses and penalties during step 5. 6. Figured Stats: During step 6 of the process several Figured Stats will be determined based on decisions made up to this point. These include: Hit points, Willpower, Movement, Encumbrance, and Initiative. 7. Finishing Touches: The final step of the process is purely to inject some life into the character. During this step, the player will be able to dig into the background and history of their character, give them a name, purpose, passion and decide exactly what makes them tick. Step 7 is purely creative and is there for players to embellish as much as they please. Once all seven steps have been followed, the character creation process is complete, and the PC will be ready to fight for humanity! 8. Advanced Character Creation Rules: Hold Up! Can I play a Cyborg? How about an Era Native who’s not yet in the Resistance? Yes, you can and this is where.\n\nThe Terminator RPG\n\nCharacter Creation\n\n“Sarah, come here! It’s about you. I mean, sort of..This is so incredible, you’re not gonna believe this. Sit down, you are going to love this.” —Nancy, Waitress\n\n1 - Select a Role The first thing a player must consider when building a character is the role that they wish to play. The Resistance utilizes all manner of skill sets in order to both better the human race and to find new ways to fight the machines. Though the soldiers of the Resistance are those seen most often on the front lines, everything from scientists and technicians to doctors and historians play a critical part in humanity’s survival. In addition to the different personalities, stats, and skills that come with selecting a character’s role, each role also possesses a unique ‘Resistance Ability’ that sets them apart. The different personalities and characteristics are discussed over the following pages. All roles are optional, and players should discuss with the Director as to whether there are any the Director does not want in their game.\n\nThe Terminator RPG\n\n[.031]\n\nChapter 04\n\nEngineer\n\nGrunt\n\nAn army might march on its belly, but it shoots with a gun. I don’t know if you’ve noticed, but they get scarcer by the day as Skynet reduces the number of weapons with a biological interface. That’s where you step in. If a gun needs a trigger, you add it. If a computer needs a monitor or keyboard, you’ll figure it out. If a shelter needs building, you get the design ready and put the grunts to work. You might not be leading big battles against the machines, but when winter comes again, and warmth, sweet hidden warmth, becomes the most vital military asset, you become more valuable than 100 John Connors.\n\nIt doesn’t matter what you wanted to do with your life; you fight. You might have wanted to be a writer; you fight. You might have wanted to be a nurse; you fight. It might be that you were born in one of the camps and never had the opportunity to train in another field. It might be that you put aside other ambitions to protect the ones you love. Whatever the reason, the war came and in it, YOU FIGHT!\n\nINITIAL STATS: ENGINEER STR\n\nDEX\n\nKNOW\n\nCONC\n\n1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\nCHA\n\nCOOL\n\nFATE\n\n0\n\n1\n\n0\n\nROLE SKILLS Detect Lock Pick (one Type)\n\nDrive (one type) Technical (any two)\n\nRESISTANCE ABILITY Technically Minded: An Engineer can choose to spend a point of FATE to reroll any or all dice during any Technical Skill Test (skill and success dice alike).
