Perhaps there’s no fate but what we make.\n\nIn ‘The Terminator RPG’, you were The Resistance, fighters struggling against Terminators sent back in time to ensure the rise of the nuclear singularity. But it's all different now. In the 'Terminator 2' movie, the resistance has grown bolder and the battle lines between humanity and the machines got blurred. Now the Resistance is reprogramming T-800s and sending them back to guard key assets. But Skynet is not prepared to go quietly into the night and with new advances in polymimetic alloy, is ever evolving its arsenal and its strategies. Will humanity be able to stop its ascension or will it triumph in a Judgment Day more thorough than ever imagined?\n\nThe 'Terminator 2, Judgment Day' source book features 200 pages of all new content including:\n\nT-1000s and all all-new, never seen before Terminator variants and hardware.\n\nPlayable Terminators reprogrammed to fight for the Human Resistance - just like in the T2 movie.

As such, it only contains material derived from both the original film and its sequel, as well the Dark Horse Comics included in the license.\n\nAs this book focuses on the events from the second film in the franchise, the timeline expands to cover events leading up to and beyond the original Judgment Day. Whilst the license may have allowed access to more than just the movie, the sourcebook makes no direct references to events of associated comics or novels but does include mentions of events and characters from sources outside of T1 and T2, such as Elizabeth Anderson, who is assassinated by the T-X as seen in Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines.\n\nGallery[]\n\n[]\n\nT2 RPG Sourcebook - Official Trailer (YouTube)\n\nT2 RPG Sourcebook - Kickstarter Campaign (Kickstarter)\n\nThe Terminator RPG: T2 Judgment Day Preorder (Backerkit)\n\nThe Terminator RPG Rulebooks The Terminator RPG • The Terminator RPG Quickstart • The Terminator RPG Quickstart Part II • The Terminator RPG Campaign Book • The Terminator RPG Director's Pack Sourcebooks The T2 RPG Sourcebook • The Terminator RPG: Resist!
