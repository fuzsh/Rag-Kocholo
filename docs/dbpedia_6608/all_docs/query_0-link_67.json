        "text": "Like the scion of a once-great dynasty, Quest is the last magazine devoted to Society with a capital S, covering the socially prominent in New York, Greenwich, The Hamptons, Palm Beach, and Miami. In print for more than 30 years and with a readership of over 500,000, Quest is the monthly journal of New York’s new “400,” covering their causes and careers, the passions that drive them, and the unions that unite them. It is a family magazine devoted equally to shining a light on the glamour of past generations as it is to admiring the sun rising over the Upper East Side on a new generation. Our readers turn to us for our extensive coverage of today’s social scene, and are always delighted to stroll down memory lane with our collection of snapshots portraying their family and friends from yesteryear."
