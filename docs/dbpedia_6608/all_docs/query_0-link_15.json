        "text": "AN INFINITE HIGHWAY WITH INFINITE POSSIBILITIES\n\n“Time is like a freeway with an infinite number of lanes, all leading from the past into the future, however, not unto the same future. A driver in lane ‘A’ may crash while a driver in lane ‘B’ survives. It follows that a driver, by changing lanes can change his future…”\n\n—­­Dr. Otto Victor Hasslein, Escape from the Planet of the Apes\n\n“You remember the old motorways? l believe that time is like an endless motorway, with an infinite number of lanes all running from the past into the future. lt follows that a driver would try to change his lanes and change his future. lf you left this room right now, you might wind up shot. Dead. lf you left a minute later, you might survive. It’s a blind choice, but you can change lanes.”\n\n­­—Virgil, Battle for the Planet of the Apes\n\nSOURCES\n\nWith the pre-order now entering its final week on Kickstarter for The Role-Playing Game of the Planet of the Apes, I thought it a good time to post some of the sources I compiled as a freelance franchise consultant for an internal POTA bible at 20th Century Studios circa 2016. These sources and my previous Planet of the Apes novels were then used when setting up the RPG.\n\nCONSPIRACIES\n\nIn 2011 I wrote a now-out-of-print illustrated novel called Conspiracy of the Planet of the Apes. Crafted by my studio BLAM! Ventures and published by Archaia Entertainment, the story was set concurrent with the first film and followed the path of Landon—an astronaut in the movie who was captured at the same time as Charlton Heston’s character, Taylor. The novel revealed that while Cornelius, Zira, and Zaius were dealing with one talking human, characters such as Dr. Milo, General Ursus, and others were dealing with another.\n\nDEATHS\n\nWhile a series of books were planned, only the first one was released before the license ended. The second, Death of the Planet of the Apes, would ultimately be released by Titan Publishing as a 460-page paperback novel in 2018.\n\nCONSULTATIONS\n\nIn December of 2015, I received an unexpected call from the then-new franchise director at 20th Century Studios. He explained that they were compiling an internal POTA bible and were having difficulty figuring out the franchise’s convoluted timeline. He had read my novel, and thought I was knowledgeable enough to be brought in as a franchise consultant.\n\nEXPANSIONS\n\nThe work was freelance, but I was happy to once again officially contribute to a world turned upside down. The job led to me consulting not only on the Planet of the Apes but on Alien and Predator as well.\n\nI worked on various parts of the POTA bible from 2015-2018. When I came on, the decision was made by the department to find a way to make everything fit into a cohesive timeline. That meant an extended universe that included films, novels, comics, games, and more. How could I make that work? I had to take a long hard look at some beloved stories from the franchise and try to figure out how something contradictory could still fit into the canon. If I couldn’t, I was told to recommend it be tossed. I looked for a third option. The theories of Dr. Hasslein and Virgil—quoted at the top of this page—were key to making it work.\n\nINFINITIES\n\nThe chronology I crafted at the behest of 20th Century Studios in 2016 is divided into five key lanes of the highway that is time. These five lanes incorporate all major plot points from the Planet of the Apes movies, television series, animated series, comics, novels, and video games that have been released over the past five decades. Together, they would define the canon of the expanded Classic Planet of the Apes universe.\n\nCAMPFIRE CANON\n\nDone right, RPGs make excellent sourcebooks for an entire franchise. Collating data from several diverse sources into a living, breathing, universe creates a guide for more than not only a role-playing game. Like the old West End Games Star Wars RPG, the Alien RPG books I worked on have since been given to new licensors as a guide when crafting games, comics, and more. The key to making this work was to include as much of everything as possible in a logical way, and transform what didn’t work into rumors, myths, and legends.\n\nSimilar to what has become known as Barroom Canon in the Alien RPG, there is Campfire Canon for POTA. These are stories overheard fireside that may or may not have some truth to them. This allows canon to have some flex in regards to including stories that otherwise could no longer count in a franchise’s development.\n\nUsing this philosophy, some version of every POTA story you’ve ever read has happened in-universe. If it strays too much from established canon by contradicting in-filmed events instead of explaining them, then that version of the story was told over a campfire by a cousin of the ape who overheard two ape soldiers whispering while they rode their horses past his farm. In the end, they become myths, legends, and events that form other timelines.\n\nFUTURES\n\nNew stories told moving forward were to be included within the five lanes of this timeline whenever possible. Anything not incorporated within these lanes was to be considered apocryphal myth, legend, and folklore on the Planet of the Apes. That is, of course, only within these five lanes. As Dr. Hasslein and Virgil’s theories suggest, there are an infinite number of other lanes. The incalculable permutations of these other avenues of time are left to the imagination. This meant that anything could be deemed canon for any of the other infinite number of lanes that make up time—including your role-playing campaign!\n\nI will stress again that this list is a guideline based on my 2015-2018 franchise consultant work at 20th Century Studios. I do not decide canon. Instead, I curate lore for coherency and continuity. Paul Dehn—the man responsible for the scripts and lore of the second through fifth films, said in 1972 that he intended the series as a closed loop. Unfortunately, the numerous contradictions made within the series as well as in subsequent offerings created beyond his involvement make that difficult to reconcile when crafting a viable expanded universe. Thus, when creating the backstory/lore/history of the Role-Playing Game of the Planet of the Apes, I drew upon Dehn’s in-film dialogue for Virgil and Hasslein about time having infinite possibilities (see the quotes at the top of this page).\n\nSeveral fans have asked for the list of what went into the game. It’s okay if my list doesn’t fit your personal headcanon, I am in no way suggesting it should. The game lore is designed to reject what you don’t like and use what you do.\n\nThe notes below about the rebooted film series are guidelines I was given when I was brought on board as a consultant. Remember that canon in any franchise is always fluid—no RPG or novel will stop headlining producers and directors from taking a series in any direction they want to try. In the case of classic POTA, the original film and TV series are long since retired, so it is not likely that will happen. Never say never, however. This list stands only until it doesn’t.\n\nA NOTE ABOUT THE REBOOT SERIES\n\nDespite some fan theories to the contrary, the reboot series is not designed as a prequel to the original films. The earlier films of the new series simply contradict the final three films of the original saga. They may cover similar territory and offer many easter eggs, but they are telling their own story that will lead to their own climax. The separation of franchises was handed to me as a perimeter to follow when I first worked on the POTA Bible for them.\n\nTHE TRUTH ABOUT EASTER EGGS\n\nAs I originally mentioned on my Alien Canon page, Easter Eggs are never an indicator of canon, they are surprise homages and nothing more.\n\nYOUR UNIVERSE\n\nAll that being said, the POTA RPG is a guide to YOUR POTA universe, official or not. Make your game universe your own. What you want in your campaign is absolutely what should be in there, no matter what. As for what I used, this is the list I stick to. It is based on my discussions and work with the Studio as a franchise consultant, and I’ve laid out the setting and whatnot accordingly.\n\nTHE TIERS\n\nAs the creative director, lead writer, and canon consultant on the POTA RPG by Magnetic Press Play, I developed the following Canon Tier guidelines for working out the POTA universe.\n\nTIER I CANON\n\nDefinitive and authorized canon to the first two lanes of the Planet of the Apes timeline:\n\nFilm Series (1968-1973)\n\nPlanet of the Apes\n\nBeneath the Planet of the Apes\n\nEscape from the Planet of the Apes\n\nConquest of the Planet of the Apes Theatrical and/or Director’s Cut\n\nBattle for the Planet of the Apes Theatrical and/or Extended Cut\n\nTIER II CANON\n\nThese sources are absolutely canon for those first two lanes of the Infinite Highway until a producer throws a curveball—unlikely since the classic saga came to a close some five decades ago:\n\nTV Series (Set in the year 3085, some 900 years before Taylor and Landon crash in the first film)\n\nPlanet of the Apes (1974)\n\nEscape from Tomorrow\n\nThe Gladiator\n\nThe Trap\n\nThe Good Seeds\n\nThe Legacy\n\nTomorrow’s Tide\n\nThe Surgeon\n\nThe Deception\n\nThe Horse Race\n\nThe Interrogation\n\nThe Tyrant\n\nThe Cure\n\nThe Liberator\n\nUp Above the World So High\n\nAnimated Series (The future of the timeline started in the third film, Escape.
