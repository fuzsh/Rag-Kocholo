        "text": "World Champion Jonathan Rea made the best out of a tricky weekend.\n\nThe MV Agusta is challenging the Ducati Panigale in the beauty pageant.\n\nKyle Smith was one of a few riders to get his elbow down in World Supersport.\n\nWith the season about to start, Phillip Island will soon be home to World Superbikes. Testing is getting underway and line-ups have been finalised, so what can we expect from the series now it’s owned by Dorna? So far, it looks very familiar, with the promised 17” wheels and headlight stickers, but the reigning champion has left while Ducati have a new bike to unleash upon the grid. The six kilos that plagued the 1098R have been consigned to history as Ducati bring back their factory team to challenge for the title with the new Panigale 1199R.\n\nChamp\n\nTom Sykes has been the revelation of 2012\n\nChaz Davies' progress has been slow on the Aprilia. But it's been progress\n\nCan we lift it? Yes we can!"
