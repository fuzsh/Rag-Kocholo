        "text": "'SLA Industries' from Nightfall Games\n\nRomark Entertainment has acquired the film and television rights to the SLA Industries role-playing game from Nightfall Games. Romark is also joining forces with SLA Industries creators David Allsop and Jared Earle to focus on expanding the 20 year-old property into the comic book, video game, and art worlds.\n\nIndependently published in 1993, SLA Industries is a fast-paced RPG set in a future dystopia where players wielding advanced weapons and arcane abilities take on the roles of operatives for the gamesâ€™ eponymous ruthless corporation, which is determined to take over the universe. Wizards of the Coast acquired the rights to SLA Industries in the 1990s, before selling it back to its creators in 1997 when WotC decided to concentrate its efforts on trading card games.\n\nRomark, which produced the film Broken in 2007, is currently developing the comic book series Grunts for Dark Horse Entertainment."
