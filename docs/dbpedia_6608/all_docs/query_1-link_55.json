        "text": "I have a friend who looks just like Cherry Hinton. No, not the town. The character Jared Earle used to play in SLA Industries who was nicely illustrated by Dave Allsop. The really weird thing is that she even calls herself “Cherry”. SLA Industries was the game and Nightfall were the people that inspired me…\n\nBack in 1998/99, we played my WatchTower campaign with Aidan, Gavin, John, Alan (and Iain briefly). The team took over an Avengers-style franchise in San Francisco and fought several implacable foes, befriended some, lost others and rid the world of a nasty piece of work (Bloodrage). They also discovered that they culd traverse time using…\n\nLast night’s effort consisted of a rather fun 3D game of Connect 4 called Gizeh. And then we played the Zombies!!! boardgame. Gizeh really is quite brain tiring as it’s a race to win all the 4s and you keep score of them, unlike Connect 4 where you spend all your time trying to link…\n\nThis is kinda reminiscent of the “Six Word Stories” posting from a while back and also acts as a reminder for you to go read Story-Games. Just do it. It’s the right thing to do. Anyway, the concept is a formula: A (feeling) (genre/place/time) where (struggle/theme). Much like many Story-Games discussions, the fun is in…\n\nFrom the National Archives, a tutorial on paleography. Fascinating subject and with a little work you can use it to construct some fairly classy looking props for games. I was first introduced to it by my friend Paul and found I was quite proficient at the stuff he was working on. Anyway, it’s a fun…\n\nGaming resumes next week with both KinnyGraham’s DG game and my own Zombi game. It’s been a dry couple of weeks.\n\nThis humourous post Itâ€™s almost like this Wicca shit doesnâ€™t even work really made me chuckle. It runs core to the magic system in Qabal – almost identical. And of course the punchline is o so ironic\n\nI’ve read a fabulous article about Opium which dictates why we should blame the British Government for the modern drug cartels. Not to mention toe futility of the War on Drugs. Hypocrisy at it’s best. Also an interesting one about Onanism and how it relates to the general pessimism in Christianity from the New Testament…\n\n“Forthwith the six guns which, unknown to anyone on the right bank, had been hidden behind the outskirts of that village, fired simultaneously. The sudden near concussion, the last close upon the first, made my heart jump. The monster was already raising the case generating the Heat-Ray as the first shell burst six yards above…"
