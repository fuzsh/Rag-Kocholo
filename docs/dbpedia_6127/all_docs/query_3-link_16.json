        "text": "Postmodernism started to appear as a broad movement in the literary world after 1980s. It has been applied to various fields as well as cinema studies. The rise of postmodernist cinema brought many examples of cinematic productions to the contemporary literature. However, the idea to apply postmodernist film theories to musical film genre is not thoroughly fulfilled.\n\nAn extraordinary constellation of biographical films about American entertainers and songwriters released between 1935 and 1959 suggests the extent to which Americans defined their nationalism in terms of popular culture, specifically music. The cinematic celebration of the creators of music over the course of a century fostered a crucial alliance between the ideals of democracy and modernity, while ostensibly transcending internal divisions by ethnicity, region, and race."
