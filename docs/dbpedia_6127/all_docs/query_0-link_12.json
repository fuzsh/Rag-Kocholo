        "text": "One of television's premier African-American series stars, elegant actress, singer and recording artist Diahann Carroll was born Carol Diann (or Diahann) Johnson on July 17, 1935, in the Bronx, New York. The first child of John Johnson, a subway conductor, and Mabel Faulk Johnson, a nurse; music was an important part of her life as a child, singing at age six with her Harlem church choir. While taking voice and piano lessons, she contemplated an operatic career after becoming the 10-year-old recipient of a Metropolitan Opera scholarship for studies at New York's High School of Music and Art. As a teenager she sought modeling work but it was her voice, in addition to her beauty, that provided the magic and the allure.\n\nWhen she was 16, she teamed up with a girlfriend from school and auditioned for Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts show using the more exotic sounding name of Diahann Carroll. She alone was invited to appear and won the contest. She subsequently performed on the daily radio show for three weeks. In her late teens, she began focusing on a nightclub career and it was here that she began formulating a chic, glamorous image. Another TV talent show appearance earned her a week's engagement at the Latin Quarter.\n\nBroadway roles for black singers were rare but at age nineteen, Diahann was cast in the Harold Arlen/Truman Capote musical \"House of Flowers\". Starring the indomitable Pearl Bailey, Diahann held her own quite nicely in the ing√©nue role. While the show itself was poorly received, the score was heralded and Diahann managed to introduce two song standards, \"A Sleepin' Bee\" and \"I Never Has Seen Snow\", both later recorded by Barbra Streisand.\n\nIn 1954 she and Ms. Bailey supported a riveting Dorothy Dandridge as femme fatale Carmen Jones (1954) in an all-black, updated movie version of the Georges Bizet opera \"Carmen.\" Diahann later supported Ms. Dandridge again in Otto Preminger's cinematic retelling of Porgy und Bess (1959). During this time she also grew into a singing personality on TV while visiting such late-nite hosts as Jack Paar and Steve Allen and performing.\n\nUnable to break through into the top ranks in film (she appeared in a secondary role once again in Paris Blues (1961), a Paul Newman/Joanne Woodward vehicle), Diahann returned to Broadway. She was rewarded with a Tony Award for her exceptional performance as a fashion model in the 1962 musical \"No Strings,\" a bold, interracial love story that co-starred Richard Kiley. Richard Rodgers, whose first musical this was after the death of partner Oscar Hammerstein, wrote the part specifically for Diahann, which included her lovely rendition of the song standard \"The Sweetest Sounds.\" By this time she had already begun to record albums (\"Diahann Carroll Sings Harold Arlen\" (1957), \"Diahann Carroll and Andre Previn\" (1960), \"The Fabulous Diahann Carroll\" (1962). Nightclub entertaining filled up a bulk of her time during the early-to-mid 1960s, along with TV guest appearances on Carol Burnett, Judy Garland, Andy Williams, Dean Martin and Danny Kaye's musical variety shows.\n\nLittle did Diahann know that in the late 1960s she would break a major ethnic barrier on the small screen. Though it was nearly impossible to suppress the natural glamour and sophistication of Diahann, she touchingly portrayed an ordinary nurse and widow struggling to raise a small son in the series Julia (1968). Despite other Black American actresses starring in a TV series (i.e., Hattie McDaniel in \"Beulah\"), Diahann became the first full-fledged African-American female \"star\" -- top billed, in which the show centered around her lead character. The show gradually rose in ratings and Diahann won a Golden Globe award for \"Best Newcomer\" and an Emmy nomination. The show lasted only two seasons, at her request.\n\nA renewed interest in film led Diahann to the dressed-down title role of Claudine (1974), as a Harlem woman raising six children on her own. She was nominated for an Oscar in 1975, but her acting career would become more and more erratic after this period. She did return, however, to the stage with productions of \"Same Time, Next Year\" and \"Agnes of God\". While much ado was made about her return to series work as a fashionplate nemesis to Joan Collins' ultra-vixen character on the glitzy primetime soap Der Denver-Clan (1981), it became much about nothing as the juicy pairing failed to ignite. Diahann's character was also a part of the short-lived \"Dynasty\" spin-off Die Colbys - Das Imperium (1985).\n\nThroughout the late 1980s and early 90s she toured with her fourth husband, singer Vic Damone, with occasional acting appearances to fill in the gaps. Some of her finest work came with TV-movies, notably her century-old Sadie Delany in Essig und Melasse - Das schwarze Amerika erwacht (1999) and as troubled singer Natalie Cole's mother in Livin' for Love: The Natalie Cole Story (2000). She also portrayed silent screen diva Norma Desmond in the musical version of \"Sunset Blvd.\" and toured America performing classic Broadway standards in the concert show \"Almost Like Being in Love: The Lerner and Loewe Songbook.\" She then had recurring roles on Grey's Anatomy: Die jungen √Ñrzte (2005) and White Collar (2009).\n\nDiahann Carroll died on October 4, 2019, in Los Angeles, California.\n\nDorothy Jean Dandridge was born on November 9, 1922 in Cleveland, Ohio, to Ruby Dandridge (n√©e Ruby Jean Butler), an entertainer, and Cyril H. Dandridge, a cabinet maker and minister. Under the prodding of her mother, Dorothy and her sister Vivian Dandridge began performing publicly, usually in black Baptist churches throughout the country. Her mother would often join her daughters on stage. As the depression worsened, Dorothy and her family picked up and moved to Los Angeles where they had hopes of finding better work, perhaps in film. Her first film was in the Marx Brothers comedy, Das Gro√üe Rennen (1937). It was only a bit part but Dandridge hoped it would blossom into something better. She only appeared in another film in 1940, in Four Shall Die (1940).\n\nMeanwhile, she dropped out of high school and became part of a musical trio which performed with the orchestra of Jimmie Lunceford. During the late 30s, she dated music composer Phil Moore, who was instrumental in launching her career as a nightclub singer and big band vocalist.\n\nHer next few screen roles in the early 1940s tended to be small stereotypical roles of black girls or princesses - such as Bahama Passage (1941) and Drums of the Congo (1942), She was the singing star of the western themed all-black-cast \"soundie\" (short musical) Cow-Cow Boogie (1942) and appeared in movies that showcased her talents as actress and singer, like Hit Parade of 1943 (1943) as the vocalist of Count Basie's Band, and twice as the vocalist of Louis Armstrong's Band in Pillow to Post (1945) and Atlantic City (1944).\n\nThose brought her headline acts in the nation's finest hotel nightclubs in New York, Miami, Chicago and Las Vegas. She may have been allowed to sing in these fine hotels but, because of racism, she couldn't have a room in any of them. It was reported that one hotel drained its swimming pool to keep her from enjoying that amenity.\n\nIn 1954, she appeared in the all-black production of Carmen Jones (1954) in the title role. She was so superb in that picture that she garnered an Academy Award nomination but lost to Grace Kelly in Ein M√§dchen vom Lande (1954). She did not get another movie role until Tamango (1958), an Italian film. She did six more films, including, most notably, Hei√üe Erde (1957) and Porgy und Bess (1959). The last movie in which she would ever appear was The Murder Men (1962) (1961).\n\nDandridge faded quickly after that, due to an ill-considered marriage to Jack Dennison (her first husband was Harold Nicholas), poor investments, financial woes, and alcoholism.\n\nShe was found dead in her apartment at 8495 Fountain Avenue, West Hollywood, on September 8, 1965, aged 42, from barbiturate poisoning. She left $2.14 in her bank account, and a handwritten letter: \"In case of my death - whoever discovers it - Don't remove anything I have on - scarf, gown, or underwear. Cremate me right away - if I have any money, furniture, give it to my mother, Ruby Dandridge - She will know what to do.\". She was cremated and her ashes were interred in the Freedom Mausoleum at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California.\n\nShe was posthumously awarded a Star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6719 Hollywood Blvd. on January 18, 1983.\n\nWith roots leading back to Louisiana southern aristocracy, lovely leading lady Lynn Whitfield was born in 1953, the eldest of four children and a third-generation BFA graduate from Howard University. Her dentist father was instrumental in developing Lynn's initial interest in acting as he was a prime figure in forming community theater in her native Baton Rouge. She is of African American and Native American descent, specifically Cherokee.\n\nFirst garnering attention on the stage by studying and performing with the Black Repertory Company in Washington, D.C, she married one of the company's co-founders and pioneers of black theatre, playwright/director/actor Vantile Whitfield in 1974. She eventually moved to New York and appeared off-Broadway in such shows as \"The Great Macdaddy\" and \"Showdown\" before earning acclaim in the 1977 Los Angeles production of the landmark black play \"For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide...When the Rainbow Is Enuf\" co-starring Alfre Woodard. Lynn eventually became a force to be reckoned with intelligent and principled roles on quality film and TV as well\n\nLynn's Hollywood career unfolded under a talent development program at Columbia Pictures in 1979. Appearing on such established TV shows as \"Hill Street Blues\" and in a 1982 PBS version of her \"For Colored Girls...\" stage hit, she made her film debut with Dr. Detroit (1983) and doled out a number of support roles in other popular films as well such as Silverado (1985), Die Frau des Profis (1985), Der wei√üe Hai IV - Die Abrechnung (1987), and Dead Aim (1987). It was TV, however, that garnered her the most attention, working her way into top lead and co-star roles. The topical social dramas In der Hitze der Gewalt (1986) co-starring Denzel Washington, Johnnie Mae Gibson: FBI (1986) opposite Howard E. Rollins Jr. and Oprah Winfrey's historical miniseries The Women of Brewster Place (1989) were her early highlights. In addition, she found some steadier work on series TV playing classy professionals, including two for ABC (a doctor in Herzschlag des Lebens - G√∂ttinnen in Wei√ü (1988) and a news anchorwoman in Equal Justice (1990).)\n\nThe peak of her acclaimed career arguably came in the form of highly popular but deeply troubled Follies Bergere headliner-turned civil rights activist Josephine Baker. In the HBO biopic The Josephine Baker Story (1991), Lynn played the legendary entertainer with Emmy-winning gusto, a role that stretched her to the limits as she played the role from age 18 to 68. Earning an NAACP Image Award in 1992 for her role in the miniseries Eine Nacht im Savoy (1992), she later appeared in Pauly Shore's comedy In the Army Now - Die Trottel der Kompanie (1994) and went back to series TV alongside Bill Cosby in the short-lived The Cosby Mysteries (1994).\n\nLynn had an upsurge in the late 90s with roles in the films Mr. Bombastic (1996) with Martin Lawrence and Der $100.000 Fisch (1997) with \"Silverado\" co-star Danny Glover. She also earned excellent reviews for her supporting work in Eve's Bayou (1997), a role that drew on her Louisiana heritage. More quality TV came her way when she starred as Sophie in Sophie & the Moonhanger (1996), a mini-movie that focused on the relationship of the wife of a Klansman and her longtime black housekeeper. She kept up the momentum with an unsympathetic role in the Oprah Winfrey miniseries The Wedding (1998), where she again had to cover a long life span, this time from 19 to 47.\n\nInto the millennium, Lynn has continued to find prolific work both on film and TV. Big screen credits include a co-starring role as a party advisor in the Chris Rock/Bernie Mac political comedy Das Wei√üe Haus sieht schwarz (2003), written and directed by Rock; star/writer/director Tyler Perry's romantic comedy Das verr√ºckte Familienfest (2006); the urban film Redemption (2004) starring Jamie Foxx that chronicles the turbulent life of (now) imprisoned L.A. Crips gang founder Stan \"Tookie\" Williams; a featured part in an updated version of Clare Boothe Luce's The Women - Von gro√üen und kleinen Aff√§ren (2008) headed by Meg Ryan and Annette Bening; a co-starring role opposite singer/songwriter Ciara in the family musical drama Mama I Want to Sing (2011); another co-star role opposite another musical artist, rapper/songwriter 50 Cent, in the sports drama Come Back or Die Tryin (2011); a starring role as a woman who loses her police officer son and takes in a young parolee Crawford Wilson in the social drama Der Preis des Glaubens (2013); and the Sean Astin action comedy Espionage Tonight (2017).\n\nOn the TV front, Lynne has made guest appearances in such regular programs as \"Boston Public,\" \"Strong Medicine,\" a recurring role in \"Without a Trace,\" \"Shark,\" \"Flash Forward,\" How to Get Away with Murder,\" \"Hit the Floor,\" \"Mistresses\" and, more recently, as Lady Belle Greenleaf, the matriarch of a rich, unscrupulous Southern Baptist, mega-church family in the dramatic series Greenleaf (2016).\n\nDivorced from Vantile Whitfield in the late 70s, Lynn later married British director Brian Gibson in 1990, by whom she has a daughter, Grace. They parted ways in 1992.\n\nSophie Okonedo is a British actress. She was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her role as Tatiana Rusesabagina in Hotel Ruanda (2004).\n\nOkonedo was born within London in 1968. Her parents were Henry Okonedo (1939-2009) and Joan Allman. Her father was British Nigerian employed as a government worker. Her mother was a British Jew employed as a Pilates teacher. Sophie's maternal grandparents were Yiddish-speaking emigrants to the United Kingdom, one from Poland and the other from Russia.\n\nHenry Okonedo abandoned his family around 1973, when Sophie was 5. Joan raised her daughter as a single mother in the Chalkhill Estate, a large council estate within the Wembley Park district of the London Borough of Brent. The Chalkhill Estate consisted of \"about 1900 houses and flats\" and was located at a short distance from the Wembley Stadium. The Chalkhill Estate was often vandalized by football hooligans during during the 1970s and suffered from high crime rates from the 1970s to the 1990s. The Estate's buildings were eventually demolished in 2000.\n\nSophie was raised as a practicing Jew, and always had access to books despite her family's relative poverty. She chose to follow acting as a profession, and was trained at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, one of the oldest and most prestigious drama schools in the United Kingdom.\n\nOkonedo made her film debut at 23, in the coming-of-age film \"Young Soul Rebels\" (1991). The film was a historical fiction work, examining the youth culture of London in the late 1970s, and the interactions between different culture movements: the skinheads, the punks, and the soul-boys. Sophie Okonedo played Tracy, the girlfriend of the main character Chris (Valentine Nonyela).\n\nIn 1995, Okonedo gained the role of Moira Levitt in the first season of the prison drama \"The Governor\" (1995-1996).

She was nominated for a \"Royal Television Society Award for Best Actor - Female\", for her role in the film. In 2002, Okonedo played the role of the prostitute Juliette in the social thriller film \"Dirty Pretty Things\", which depicted the lives of impoverished immigrants in London.\n\nIn 2003, Okonedo voiced the role of Alison Cheney in the flash-animated series \"Scream of the Shalka\", a spin-off of \"Doctor Who\".
