        "text": "THE MOVIE:\n\nShe had a \"heart of glass\"—and it looked like 1980s pop icon Deborah Harry of Blondie fame had hair of glass as well. Her 'do in Hairspray definitely required of gallons of the title product. She carries off the insane wave of blond on her head without a trace of irony, which makes it all the more hilarious.\n\nTHE MUSICAL:\n\nIt sweeps up into a mega-blond bouffant with curls cascading from the top, while surrounding straight hair flows from around the perimeter to modernize a Madame de Pompadour look. Question: What can top the ludicrously elevated 'do that Amber sports for the Miss Teenage Hairspray contest that caps the show? Answer: Nothing. This one-of-a-kind creation is likely of the biggest wigs Broadway has ever seen.\n\nTHE MOVIE MUSICAL:\n\nIt's campy, whimsical and has many exits for the hair to spill from the head. That's Amanda Bynes' 1960s period 'do, which may inspire a few multiple pony-tail wearing gals to come out of the woodwork and hold their heads up high. A mini-bouffant on top, the 'do has just enough woman in it to counter-balance its child-like pixieness—not a bad inspiration for trendsetting Tinseltown movie stylists. THE MOVIE:\n\nPia Zadora, wherefore art thou? Having been out of the public eye for a good minute, petite one-time Golden Globe winner (look it up) Pia Zadora pumped out a cute comeback back in 1988 playing a slick-haired beatnik drug chick. These days, Pia is working on... Pia.\n\nTHE MUSICAL:\n\nIn its six years on Broadway, Hairspray has welcomed many a musical guest star including Diana DeGarmo, Haylie Duff and the upcoming Lance Bass. These days former \"Round and Round\" R&B wonder kid Tevin Campbell is groovin' and movin' as Seaweed Stubbs.\n\nTHE MOVIE MUSICAL:\n\nBlink and you'll miss it: After playing the harried dancer wrangler in the orignal movie, Mink Stole, a well-loved featured performer in just about every John Waters film, pops up as a shocked Baltimore lady in the new film's opening minutes. THE MOVIE:\n\nIn her first televised modeling gig for the local plus-size gal store, not only does our hero girl Tracy walk the walk with bounce and style... she also daintily nibbles on bright pink Hostess SnoBalls while doing so! Go Tracy!\n\nTHE MUSICAL:\n\nIn a scene unique to the stage version, the ever-rhyming Motormouth boosts Edna's self-confidence in being an \"ample American\" by saying things like \"You can't let weight restrict your fate!\" and \"The bigger the girth, the more you're worth!\"\n\nTHE MOVIE MUSICAL:\n\nThe screenplay for the new movie adds the element of Edna, ashamed by how she looks, not having left the Turnblad home for over a decade. When her daughter yanks her out with the song \"Welcome to the ླྀs,\" the pleasantly plump mama gains new self-confidence. THE MOVIE:\n\nUpon first seeing the Turnblads—Jerry Stiller and Divine—at home in their hilariously banal life, it's clear that Waters is skewering suburban stereotypes. But in portraying the relationship more as a sexless friendship, the actors nail the long-term married couple dynamic to a tee…while still making it clear that their love mingles in deep waters. We even get a jolt of physical chemistry between the two in Act Three—although it may come a bit late for us to remember that Divine is not the woman we think he is.\n\nTHE MUSICAL:\n\nIn the stage musical, joke shop owner Wilbur (originally played by Broadway old-timer Dick Latessa, who walked off with a Tony) is a goofy loon who loves whoopie cushions, exploding bubble gum and his larger-than-life wife. Edna lights up when he walks in a room--they're clearly made for each other. The chemistry is further exploited in the Act Two duet \"Timeless to Me,\" which turns the working-class regulars into amorous old-time vaudevillian hoofers. The show's authors had Steve Lawrence and Eydie Gorme in their heads when they penned the tune.\n\nTHE MOVIE MUSICAL:\n\nIt's all about the movie close-up. Getting to be the third party to the deliciously risky lack of space between demure Edna and frisky Wilbur is nothing short of exciting—maybe because under all those prosthetics, the fact remains: we're watching John Travolta and Christopher Walken tango, waltz and canoodle and the chemistry is palpable. Adding jealousy and a third wheel to the mix is Michelle Pfeiffer, which only serves to heighten the kinetics. It's believable that this couple could actually be intimate after the credits roll—and that's what counts. THE MOVIE:\n\nWho can resist the sight of Ricki Lake and Divine side-by-side in matching, beflowered outré outfits, bottomed-off with a straight-cut, pea-green skirt? Not us! It's a known fact that when a genetic girl hangs with a trannie, the latter is afforded even more realness. You couldn't get a more real mother-daughter visual moment if you tried!\n\nTHE MUSICAL:\n\nFor \"Welcome to the ླྀs,\" Edna and Tracy emerge from Mr. Pinky's Hefty Hideaway in vibrant Pucci-flavored silk and chiffon get-ups trimmed in aqua ostrich feathers. The vibrantly colored purple and blue hues seem to blend together and dance right off of Edna and Tracy's dresses and into the audience's laps. It's no wonder costume designer William Ivey Long won a Tony.\n\nTHE MOVIE MUSICAL:\n\nThe 2007 Turnblad ladies have far more realistic fashion transformations than did their predecessors, spending a dreamy, let's-get-dolled-up session that results in John Travolta and Nicki Blonsky heading home in oh-so-girly, scallop-necked, pink sequined dresses that could've doubled for Jackie-O-esque, White House, gala affair attire. THE MOVIE:\n\nGreat wigs on fire! When her wig-planted bomb shoots off in the film's final moments, Velma Von Tussle's alabaster face is charred black…a masterful Waters moment that shows just how far a nasty racist will go to impede equality and progress!\n\nTHE MUSICAL:\n\nOnstage, a bunch of the main characters head to prison with Tracy following the protest on the TV station. Spotted in lockdown: Edna, Velma, Amber, Penny and Motormouth. They also sing a song called \"Big Dollhouse.\"\n\nTHE MOVIE MUSICAL:\n\nIn a brand-new scene (with a sexy new reprise of \"Big, Blonde and Beautiful\"), a scheming Velma seduces a befuddled Wilbur during a late night visit to his gag shop, the Har-De-Har Hut, while Edna gets dolled up for her man a la Anita in West Side Story."
