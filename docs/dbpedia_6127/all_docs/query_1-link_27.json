        "text": "Hairspray is a 2007 musical film based on a Broadway musical, set in 1960s Baltimore, Maryland. It follows the \"pleasantly plump\" teenager Tracy Turnblad as she pursues stardom as a dancer on a local TV show and rallies against racial segregation. Both the film and the musical are based on the 1988 film of the same name by John Waters.\n\nDirected by Adam Shankman.\n\nBeing invited places by colored people - it feels so hip!\n\nMa, it's changing out there! You'll like it. People who are different, their time is coming!\n\nfrom “Good Morning Baltimore”\n\nThe rats on the street\n\nAll dance ’round my feet,\n\nThey seem to say\n\n“Tracy, it’s up to you!”\n\nSo, oh, oh,\n\nDon’t hold me back,\n\n’Cause today, all my dreams will come true!\n\nGood morning Baltimore!\n\nThere’s the flasher who lives next door,\n\nThere’s the bum on his barroom stool,\n\nThey wish me luck on my way to school.\n\nGood morning Baltimore,\n\nAnd some day when I take to the floor,\n\nThe world’s gonna wake up and see\n\nBaltimore and me.\n\nfrom “You Can’t Stop the Beat”\n\nYou can’t stop an avalanche\n\nAs it races down the hill;\n\nYou can try to stop the seasons, girl\n\nBut ya know you never will.\n\nAnd you can try to stop my dancin' feet,\n\nBut I just cannot stand still.\n\nMy mom says I’m not allowed to perspire!\n\nfrom “Without Love”\n\nIn my ivory tower\n\nLife was just a Hostess snack\n\nBut now I’ve tasted chocolate\n\nAnd I'm never going back\n\nI am now a checkerboard chick!\n\nSorry, little darlin'. Hope I didn’t dent your 'do.\n\nFrom \"Ladies Choice\"\n\nHey little girl lookin' for a sale,\n\nTest drive this American male\n\nIt's gonna take cash to fill my tank,\n\nSo let's crack open your piggy bank!\n\nFrom \"Without Love\"\n\nOnce I was a selfish fool who never understood\n\nI never looked inside myself,\n\nBut on the outside, I looked good!\n\n(crying after Link has gone with Tracy and the Detention Kids) He just danced on that bus with that Great White Whale and those Negroes!\n\nfrom “The New Girl in Town”\n\nHey look out for that moving van\n\nDriving down our street!\n\nYou better lock up your man\n\nBefore he meets\n\nfrom “Run Tell That”\n\nThe blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice.\n\nI could say it ain’t so, but darling, what’s the use?\n\nThe darker the chocolate, the richer the taste,\n\nAnd that’s where it’s at\n\nNow run tell that!\n\nfrom “Without Love”\n\nGirl, if I can’t touch you\n\nThen I’m gonna lose control\n\nfrom “Run Tell That”\n\nI’m tired of coverin’ up all my pride!\n\n(So give me five on the black-hand side)\n\nI’ve got a new way of movin’\n\nAnd I've got my own voice!\n\n(So how can I help,\n\nBut to shout and rejoice?)\n\nThe people ’round here\n\nCan barely pay their rent\n\nThey're try'n to make dollar\n\nOutta fifteen cent!\n\nBut we got a spirit\n\nMoney just can’t buy!\n\nIt’s deep as a river\n\nAnd soars to the sky!!!\n\nI risked communicable diseases, she’ll certainly risk jail.\n\nLet me guess, brand-new dress? Well, you’ll stop traffic!\n\nI could do a fan dance with a lettuce leaf and you would remain completely obtuse!\n\nYou know what your demographic is? Cleaning ladies and lawn jockeys.\n\nMy husband, he accidentally suffocated.\n\nfrom “Big, Blonde, and Beautiful (Reprise)”\n\nI bet you’re tired of heavy lifting\n\nGet your hands on something small\n\nfrom “Welcome to the Sixties”\n\nDon’tcha let nobody try to steal your fun,\n\n’Cause a little touch of lipstick never hurt no one\n\nThe future’s got a million roads for you to choose,\n\nBut you’ll walk a little taller in some high heel shoes\n\nAnd once you find a style that makes you feel like you,\n\nSomething fresh, something new\n\nEdna: Will you turn that racket down? I'm trying to iron here.\n\nTracy: Ma, its not racket, its the Corny Collins Show!\n\nEdna: Well, it's turning your brains into mud!\n\nPenny: Without that show I have nothing!\n\nMrs. Pingleton: Having nothing builds character!\n\nAmber: [to one of the dancers] Do that again, and there'll be stumps where your feet are, you got that? You little who- [Link walks up] -Holy moly.\n\nLink: [presents Amber with a ring] It’s time.\n\n[Amber squeals with delight, and kisses Link]\n\nVelma: Amber! [they break apart] Save your personal life for the camera, sweetie! Ooh, shiny! [sends Amber off to makeup for more powder]\n\nCorny: And now it’s time to say goodbye to our very own fun-lovin’, free-wheelin’ little Brenda. Come on up here, Brenda! [Brenda does so] Brenda will be taking a little leave of absence from the show. How long are you gonna be gone, Brenda?\n\nBrenda: [smiling nervously] Just nine months.\n\nVelma: Detroit sound? What’s that, the cries of people being mugged?\n\nVelma: They’re kids, Corny, that’s why we have to steer them in the white direction.\n\nCorny: The right direction?\n\nVelma: Didn’t I say that?\n\nCorny: Gee, Velma, how do you fire Corny Collins from The Corny Collins Show? [walks off]\n\nVelma: [starts to speak and then pauses, frustrated] They do it all the time on “Lassie”!\n\nEdna: No one is auditioning for anything in this household!\n\nTracy: But why not? Why not?\n\nEdna: Because dancing is not your future. One day, you’re going to own \"Edna’s Occidental Laundry\".\n\nTracy: I don’t want to be a laundress, I want to be famous!\n\nEdna: If you want to be famous, learn how to take blood out of car upholstery; That’s a skill you can take right to the bank!\n\nWilbur: [to Tracy] This is America, babe, you gotta think big to be big.\n\nEdna: Big ain’t the problem in this family, Wilbur...\n\nTracy: I can’t believe I’m really here auditioning [for The Corny Collins Show]!\n\nPenny: I can’t believe I’m really here watching you audition.\n\nTracy: Negro Day’s the best! I wish every day were “Negro Day”!\n\nSeaweed: At our house, it is.\n\n[Everyone laughs]\n\nAmber: You have to vote for a person, Corny, not one of the Himalayas.\n\nCorny: [tightly] Always the charmer, Amber!\n\nVelma: [after The Dynamites perform “The New Girl in Town”] How dare you pick the same song!\n\nMaybelle: They wrote it.\n\nMr. Flak: Oh, and Mr. Larkin, perhaps you’d like to share with the rest of the class Patrick Henry’s immortal last words?\n\nLink: [pause] Kiss my ass?\n\n[Amber gasps in shock]\n\nPenny: I’m very pleased and scared to be here.\n\nMaybelle: Now, honey, we got more reason to be scared on your street.\n\nAmber: I’m calling because I have some information about your daughter’s whereabouts.\n\nEdna: What?\n\nAmber: Right now, as we speak, your daughter has entered a hotbed of moral... !urpentine.\n\nMaybelle: [watching Edna walk in] Boy, if we get any more white people in here, this is gonna be a suburb.\n\nMaybelle: Miz Edna, is it? Hi, I mean, you don’t have to rush off, you know.\n\nEdna: Well, I do. I left my iron on.\n\nMaybelle: Oh, your iron? Well, before you go, are you sure you wouldn't like to have a little something to eat? [shows Edna the soul food spread on the table]\n\nEdna: [after a long moment] Is that braised?\n\nVelma Von Tussle: Incredible! I could do a fan dance with a lettuce leaf and you would remain completely obtuse!\n\nWilbur: Obtuse?\n\nVelma: Yes, obtuse!\n\nWilbur: I flunked geometry-\n\nVelma: Yeah, well, and biology too, no doubt!\n\nWilbur: [to a sobbing Edna, who thinks that he has been cheating on her with Velma] Honey, it took me five years to figure out you were flirting! How could I ever?\n\nLink: I was just at home, practising my new twist on “The Twist”, when I overheard it on the news. I can’t believe Tracy savagely bludgeoned an Eagle Scout! That’s just not like her!\n\nEdna: But it’s not true! I was there! He didn't even bleed!\n\n[Seaweed attempts to untie the rope binding Penny]\n\nPenny: Oh, Seaweed, you do care! I was afraid the colors of our skin would keep us apart!\n\nSeaweed: No, but these knots might. [still trying to untie her] Was your mom in the Navy?\n\nInez: [singing] Seaweed’s got a girlfriend!\n\nSeaweed: Shut up!\n\nInez: You.\n\nMaybelle: [to Seaweed and Penny] Oh, so this is love? [pauses, then smiles] Well, love is a gift; a lot of people don’t remember that. So you two better brace yourselves for a whole lotta ugly comin’ at you from a never-ending parade of stupid.\n\nPenny: [deadpan] Oh, you've met my mother?\n\nPolice Chief: [while on the lookout for Tracy] Velma, I seriously doubt she’ll risk incarceration to win a pageant.\n\nVelma: [to herself] I risked communicable diseases. She’ll certainly risk jail.\n\nPenny: I am now a checkerboard chick! [kisses Seaweed]\n\nMrs. Pingleton: [sees this on TV, and screams in horror] Penny, no! [tumbles over the coffee table]\n\nAmber: I lost, Mom, Let’s just deal with it!\n\nVelma: No, you did not lose! [as she pulls the tallies out of her brassiere] You cannot have lost because I switched the damn tallies!\n\nEdna: Smile, Ms. Crab Meat! [camera pans to reveal her and Wilbur standing behind a live television camera] You’re on Candid Camera!\n\nWilbur: That was a good shot, don’t you think?\n\nCameraman: Not bad!\n\nVelma: Corny, do something! This show is turning to gumbo!\n\nCorny: Not a chance, Velma - this is the future.\n\nFor anyone who wanted something bigger, there comes a time to break all the rules.\n\nGet ready for something big July 20!\n\nIn July 2007, are you ready for something big?\n\nIt was a time of tradition, a time of values, and a time…to shake things up.\n\nOn July 20, the summer blockbuster is getting a whole new look.\n\nRemember when a movie can make you dream, make you dance, and make you feel on top of the world?\n\nThis Summer, when you follow your own beat, there is no limit to how far you can go.\n\nWhen you follow your own beat, the world will follow you.\n\nYou Can’t Stop The Beat…July 2007\n\nMain characters\n\nNikki Blonsky as Tracy Turnblad\n\nJohn Travolta as Edna Turnblad\n\nMichelle Pfeiffer as Velma Von Tussle\n\nChristopher Walken as Wilbur Turnblad\n\nAmanda Bynes as Penny Pingleton\n\nJames Marsden as Corny Collins\n\nQueen Latifah as \"Motormouth\" Maybelle\n\nBrittany Snow as Amber Von Tussle\n\nZac Efron as Link Larkin\n\nElijah Kelley as Seaweed J. Stubbs\n\nAllison Janney as Prudy Pingleton\n\nMinor roles\n\nPaul Dooley as Mr. Harriman F. Spritzer\n\nJayne Eastwood as Miss Wimsey\n\nJerry Stiller as Mr. Pinky\n\nTaylor Parks as Little Inez Stubbs\n\nGeorge King as Mr. Flak\n\nThe irony of casting John Travolta (Danny Zuko from Grease) as Edna Turnblad and Michelle Pfeiffer (Stephanie Zinone from Grease 2) as Velma Von Tussle was not lost on anyone, not to mention casting Zac Efron (Troy Bolton from the High School Musical movies).\n\nNikki Blonsky's film début. She was chosen out of a nationwide talent search and was actually surprised by director/choreographer Adam Shankman via a live video feed at Cold Stone Creamery where she worked.\n\nOn an episode of The Oprah Winfrey Show Nikki Blonsky revealed that the first thing that John Travolta told her on the set was \"Come to Momma!\"\n\nZac Efron (Link Larkin) commuted back and forth from Toronto to Los Angeles to do the soundtrack for High School Musical 2. However, some of the Hairspray soundtrack was recorded in the same studio.\n\nLink's signature \"wink-and-click\" gesture was something that Zac came up with on his own. Shankman liked it so much that he asked him to do it often on the film. Zac even did it on at least one occasion in High School Musical 2.\n\nIt took four hours of makeup daily to put John Travolta into the thirty-pound body suit to play Edna Turnblad.\n\nThe hairstyles and bunches for the cast members took an average of three hours to do.\n\nAmanda Bynes (Penny Pingleton) constantly sucked on lollipops. Her father, a dentist, expressed concern about it. She assured him that she was not really eating them when in reality she ate them all.\n\nSeveral deleted scenes included: Edna being arrested at the protest, Tracy singing \"I Can Wait\" in the bomb shelter of Penny's basement, and Velma being arrested near the end of \"You Can't Stop the Beat\". They can all be seen on the DVD.\n\nThe song \"The New Girl in Town\" was originally written for the Broadway show and it was cut during its pre-Broadway run but it was included in the film version. This was done to give Brittany Snow (Amber Von Tussle) a chance to sing and to show Negro Day, something that the other adaptations never did.\n\nThe song \"You Can't Stop the Beat\" was nicknamed \"You Can't Stop to Breathe\" by the cast due to the song's length, the near-nonstop dancing, and the large amount of words sung.\n\nThe songs \"It Takes Two\" and \"Ladies' Choice\", both sung by Link, were written for the stage and film respectively, even though the coda for the first song was only heard on film. It can be heard on the CD soundtrack.\n\nBecause Zac's voice was blended with Drew Seeley's in High School Musical, he got the chance to show his talents on his own with Hairspray. In High School Musical 2 he was the singing voice of Troy Bolton.\n\nDuring a break in the filming, John Travolta led the cast in \"Summer Loving\" and \"Greased Lightning\" from Grease. Amanda and Zac were so excited that they texted all of their friends. Zac sent pages and pictures to his High School Musical cast mates who were on tour at that time.\n\nThe added reprise of \"Big, Blonde, and Beautiful\" was done at Michelle Pfeiffer's suggestion to replace a scripted scene so that she could have another chance to sing.\n\nUnlike the Broadway show, neither Amber nor Velma take active parts in \"You Can't Stop the Beat.”\n\nFor \"Run Tell That”, a 1959 GMC school bus was cut into nine pieces to facilitate the dance number. Ironically, the white kids sat at the back of the bus.\n\nThe Broadway song \"Mama I'm a Big Girl Now\" was reluctantly cut from the movie. It was set to be a three-way song involving Tracy, Penny, and Amber with their mothers. The producers felt that it could not be done without a three-way split screen and it would deviate from the movie. The song, however, was recorded featuring Nikki Blonsky, Ricki Lake (the original Tracy in the 1988 film), and Marissa Jaret Winokur from the Broadway show.\n\nThe dress that Penny wears in \"You Can't Stop the Beat\" was made from the curtains in her room. It was homage to Disney films where dresses were made from curtains and blankets.\n\nPulp Fiction Reference:\n\nJust before going out onto the floor in \"You Can't Stop the Beat\" Edna gives Velma the Batusi. She also does that to a cop in the deleted scenes portion of the DVD.\n\nWhen Edna says, \"If you want to be famous, learn how to take blood out of car upholstery\", it is a reference to the Harvey Keitel character. (Although - as this line was used in the Broadway musical - it is most unlikely to be an actual reference - merely coincidental as the Broadway musical was written way before any John Travolta involvement in the 2007 film musical)\n\nJohn Waters, director and writer of the original Hairspray and executive producer of the 2007 remake, was \"the flasher who lives next door\".\n\nMink Stole, Tammy in the 1988 film, was one of the women flashed by John Waters.\n\nChoreographers Anne Fletcher, Zach Woodlee, and Joey Pizzi were the nurse, the teacher in the smoking lounge (whose doughnut Tracy takes), and the Driver's Ed teacher respectively in \"I Can Hear the Bells\".\n\nChoreographer Jamal Sims was one of the protesters in \"I Know Where I've Been\". He was the one on Edna's left.\n\nSet director Joey O'Brien was The Corny Collins Show director.\n\nDirector/Choreographer Adam Shankman, Ricki Lake (the original Tracy in the 1988 film), and composer Mark Shaiman were the William Morris talent agents. Note Shaiman's out-of-time beard and hair.\n\nShawn Thompson, Corny Collins in the original 1988 film, was the reporter outside of the studio.\n\nJerry Stiller, Wilbur Turnblad in the original 1988 film, was Mr. Pinky, from Mr. Pinky’s Hefty Hideaway.\n\nWikipedia has an article about:"
